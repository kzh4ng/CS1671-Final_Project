It is connected to Club Downtown which has two other floors that play latin pop/rock/hip hop and reggaeton. The cover is $10. They are open til at least 3 am (and the other floors stay open even later I think) so that is an advantage over the clubs that close at 2pm. To get to the Palazzo floor, you go in through Club Downtown's main entrance and then go out on the front patio and then back in to Palazzo's dance floor. Ask if you get lost and the security or bartenders will point you there. I like the size of the floor, which is tile. It is not as hot and crowded as other salsa places like Pepins on Saturday. Drinks vary from great to weak (mainly the mixed drinks) depending on the bartender, they do have specials sometimes. As a long time salsa dancer who goes with friends (male and female) but no set partner for the night, it can be hard to find a good salsa dancer here if  you don't already know one. So salseros/salsaholics if you will be going without a partner you might want to try to find at least one good dancer to go with you so you will have fun.  Or if you look on www.azsalsa.net or www.meetup.com (check for Scottsdale or Phoenix salsa groups) there are plenty of socials and lessons where you can meet others if you are new and want to meet other dancers or go out with a group. The music is good but since I go a lot,  I start to hear the same songs over and over. I think they should bring in different djs, rotate them or make sure the music gets mixed up to keep people coming back.  Also note there is a strict dress code - it is posted outside. I know several guys who had to go back home to change cause they couldn't get in. I don't remember all the specifics but I believe some things to note are no hats/sunglasses, tennis shoes, tee shirts, baggy pants, bandanas, etc. I'd say collared shirt (tucked in), nice slacks/pants and shoes and you'd be okay. They do have metal detectors going in. However, I have rarely seen any fights and I feel safe here.

I had the chicken and potato dish with yellow curry with some cucumber and pepper veggies on the side.  While the presentation was very nice, the dish itself was just okay.  Almost everyone in the group I was with also had a currie dish and agreed the presentation was more impressive than the taste itself.  The one gal who got a noodle dish however said hers was terrific.\n\nMost of us got dessert to finish things off.  I got a slice of the mango cheesecake (very tasty).  Another person got the lemon ginger cheesecake and was very happy.  Everyone else got slices of the chocolate cake (which were HUGE by the way).\n\nThey also have drink specials on Monday and Wednesdays.  We went on Wednesday for $4 wine glass night.  I was gung ho to try a sip of the red Thai wine, but strangely the waiter strongly recommended against it.  I has a Shiraz instead which was fine.  Most everyone else got a white wine.\n\nOverall, the service was a little bit slow (especially getting us our check), but it was adequate.  The waiter was knowledgable about the nuances of each dish (which was good because two people in our group never had Thai food before).  Amazingly, when we originally sat down, the restaurant was just about dead.  But after 8:30pm the place was packed!  Not sure if this is normal, but seems like alot of the folks who live in and around the downtown area needed a late Thai fix.\n\nBottomline, good, but I've had better.  I commend Wild Thaiger and their people for surviving the onslaught of light rail construction that no doubt crippled their business.  Based on what we've seen, this place had a pretty solid local following so clearly they've done something right.  This place is okay if you're looking to go out with a group, but I'd probably enjoy this place more if it was just me and my girlfriend.", "business_id": "KPoTixdjoJxSqRSEApSAGg", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-08-07", "type": "review"}

All were prepared very well.  The beef panang was a little different than I have had at many places here in town.  More curry & creamy coconut milk than the light broth based panang we have settled for at other places.  It was by far the best panang we have in Phoenix to date.  The beef was fork tender and the sauce flavor was over the top.  \n\nThe restaurant is very cozy and energetic.  It was 7:30 on a Thursday night and the inside was full, with only 1 table on the patio brave enough to weather the 100 degree heat.  Server was very friendly and attentive.  NA beverages were always kept full and she was all over refilling our glasses from the bottle of wine that had been ordered.  Big bonus points for the kitchen design.  It will not blow you away with tons of polished stainless steel and creative wall decor, but it is an open exhibition kitchen with about 10-12 seats at the bar that look in on the action.

As such, it's wonderfully convenient to go here for a bite then wander down to see some American Indian history and artwork.  This was exactly what brought me there last night.\n\nI was seated immediately upon arrival.  The server cheerily came over and, when my first beer selection was out, suggested a few options that I might also enjoy.

Unsurprisingly, much better than the standard American swill.\n\nBeing that this was my first time here, I had to order something from the house specials section.  I decided on the Jungle Love (insert 70s funk music here).  A dish of primarily \"exotic\" vegetables and thin sliced wild boar in a very spicy red broth.  It was superb.  The boar, which I'd never had before, was not the core of the dish but still quite flavorful.  It added a great contrast to the mass of vegetables in the pot.  I'll be honest, I'm not sure half of what I ate in there, but it was all good.  Good, and spicy.

I don't typically like eggplant), squash, and green beans). I usually add chicken and have more than enough food for two meals. Wild Thaiger has decent specials on some nights of the week for drinks (Mondays feature 5$ martinis). My only complaint about the Thaiger is that, unlike other Thai restaurants, they do not allow you to choose your spiciness level.

The flavors and preparation is just not authentic. I am reviewing the food with the background of having traveled to Thailand and having lived most of my life in larger culturally diverse cities (NY, Chicago, DC) with close authentic thai food. Here are some critiques:\n\nPad Kee Mao - My favorite noodle dish of all time is supposed to be prepared with thick rice noodles sauteed to a variety of textures, and infused with a dizzying array of spice. Instead, the dish here is made with thin vermacilli noodles and tasted like a lump of wet ricey dough. I even explicitly asked for it to be extra spicy, but there was barely any.\n\nPad thai - This basic Thai staple was presented as a soggy clump of noodles with a watery sauce pooling at the bottom of the plate. The worse part was that despite all of that sauce, it was tasteless except for the peanuts sprinkled on top. There was no hint of tamarind or fish sauce or chili. Disgrace.\n\nTom Yum (chicken) - Again, what we received was a flavorless broth. There was no taste of lemongrass, no curry, and the chicken was dry.\n\nNeedless to say, this was very disappointing. For a large restaurant in a prominent location, the food served up here was worse than some of the shacks I've eaten out of in other cities.\n\nTwo stars for service and cleanliness alone, none for food.", "business_id": "KPoTixdjoJxSqRSEApSAGg", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-07-25", "type": "review"}

I was a little baffled when the scheduler told me the next available appointment was not until a few weeks, seeing as I clearly stated I need to get my lump on my breast examined. I may only be 22 years old, and it may be rare for a 22 year old to have a malignant lump, but I do have a family history of breast cancer that was conceived early in their 20's. \n\nAs for my appointment, I had it scheduled at 7pm and I wasn't seen by the NP until 7:45. When the NP (nurse practitioner) came in, she checked out my lump and told me we need to get an ultrasound right away to make sure it isn't anything we need to worry about. When I had my pap smear she told me it looks like I have a yeast infection too. \n\nShe also gave me \"tips\" about keeping your vagina healthy such as Douching. First of all, this is HORRIBLE advice. Douching is the worst thing you can do for vaginal flora. This is the main reason why women get vaginal infections and bacterial vaginosis. I had to laugh at her but she is a NP, she knows what she is talking about...\n\nThere were two things that really bothered me about my appointment. The scheduler after my appointment told me she would call me the very next day to let me know the time of my ultrasound at Good Sam. I never heard from her the next day. This is very frustrating for me because I had to wait a while to even get in to see someone and now that I have a suspicious lump, I feel like we are just taking our time for something that needs to be a priority! Second thing is that I was clearly told I have a yeast infection and was not given any prescriptions to take care of it. \n\nI really feel like the office just does not care about my health or concerns and didn't do anything to make me feel comfortable. It was just a waiting game; wait for your appointment, when your appointment finally comes wait an hour for the doctor and wait some more to have an ultrasound scheduled. \n\nI will NOT go back here again.\n\n*update--I called to see why they hadn't called me back to schedule my ultrasound and they acted like I was dumb--saying that they gave me the order to schedule it somewhere else.

I haven't been here since September 2012, so bare with me. \n\nThe building that this office is in is a bit outdated, as are the decorations inside. Do not let that scare you away! Although I do appreciate the \"breastfeeding acceptance\" posters. I loved seeing the babies names posted in their lobby with weights and such. It made me feel like they enjoy delivering babies. They have pictures of babies EVERYWHERE!  When you get to your appointment you have to pee in a cup, so come ready with a bladder ready to go. The front desk staff isn't that outgoing, but the ladies who took my weight and blood pressure were always sweet.  I felt bad about my weight gain during pregnancy, and they didn't come down on me about it. (which was a relief.) \n\nI came into this office when I was 30 weeks along. They took me in, to my surprise because I heard that women have issues with getting a doctor that late in their pregnancy. My doctor was Dr. Sharon Thompson. She's super sweet and down to earth. I picked a female doctor because I just don't feel like a man would understand what I was going through. She basically sat me down when I came in and was like \"We try to do things as naturally as possible around here. No pushing you to do one thing or another.\" AH! What a sigh of relief! I was in love with the office already. I was sad that they wouldn't give me an ultrasound when I wanted one, but I understand it was insurance reasons. Appointments were quick which was nice because it was mid summer and I was super pregnant and wanted to be home. Just a lot of \" do you have any questions?\" and responses. I felt a lot of reassurance in my answers to my questions. I swore I was dying because my feet were swollen. She reminded me it was just a part of my pregnancy and once the baby was out I'd be fine! And guess what? I am fine. \n\nOkay, labor talk. I went into her office for my once a week appointment when I was informed that I was 6cm dilated. She asked if I wanted my membranes stripped, and did. It wasn't that bad, and told me what to expect over the next few hours to day. She said \"tomorrow you'll be meeting your baby\" and I did! She let me push when I wanted to and gave me three different ways to push. I pushed for about an hour to an hour and a half.  She wasn't even mad that my water broke on her shoes. We TALKED the whole time I was in labor. The whole room was laughing at one point because people were cracking jokes. (I did have an epidural) I also had an extremely attractive resident guy there to witness his first birth. Super cool.  \nI never imagined my labor experience would be so amazing.

I will drive 15-20 miles to my nearest Sprouts or the Fancy Fry's in Scottsdale before I ever drive 1 mile to get to Safeway.\nIt's that bad.\nNot only is the parking lot notoriously sketchy with inconsiderate drivers abounding, but there are numerous problems inside the store, as well:\n1) You walk in to a rather dimly-lighted store, usually with a sour-faced security guard blocking your access to the carts.\n2) What carts you ask? That's a good question. Several times I have had to grab a handbasket because there were no carts in stock, even though I had a long grocery list to fulfill. I actually saw the cartboys leaning against the cartrails, laughing and having a heck of a time. Look, I get it, it's hot outside and you don't want to get get the carts, but C'MON!\n3) The first thing you see upon walking in may or may not be a ghetto display of moldy-looking fruit, or on  the 4th of July, a teenage employee roasting hot dogs on a bunsen burner with open containers of ketchup and mustard on a rickety table.\n4) Venture into the produce section, and you will meander through very difficult twists and turns that your cart may not even fit through. Please, managers, make sure that the spaces between fruit stands are at least cart-width!!!\n5) The line for the pharmacy extends into the produce area. Enough said.\n6) Expect for the aisles to have large space-blocking cardboard displays and/or fallen down merchandise and/or an employee restocking items right in the middle of the day. I would say half of the aisles are blocked at any given time.\n7) Once you have completed your hazardous journey of finding everything on your list, you must enter one of the two checkout lines, which are so long that they become another force blocking the aisleways. Two checkout lines, you say? Yes, only two, despite there being 5 or 6 total checkout lanes. If you are a young lady with any shred of fashion or hygiene, expect to be \"checked out\" by creepy older men whilst standing innocently in line.\n8) Your cashier will either be a surly teenage boy or a pregnant teenage girl who does a poor job managing the line and barely gives you the time of day and/or forgets to give you the receipt when you are done. But you are so eager to get out of there, you simply don't care to go back and ask for it.\n\nOh, and there may or may not be trash on the floor.\nIf Safeway as a nationwide brand prides themselves on safety or service, they need to get their corporate people in here to take a look at this store, and either condemn it or fire everyone who works here.\nIt's even more pitiful because they are the closest store to everyone who lives downtown, so they could easily be the most popular.\nPlease, downtown, replace this disgraceful store with a Whole Foods or a Sprouts or a place with a shred of human decency.", "business_id": "7Z7IkR_-94AjUuDw0fbI7g", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-07-09", "type": "review"}

And I love it. The servers are friendly, the place is beautiful, the best part is the outside patio. The only two negative things are the small bar area (happy hour is only in the bar) and the birds. The birds are cute, very chatty and will join you at your table to try and share your chips.\n\nThe food was great, I got the enchiladas which were tasty and I asked to change the side and the waiter was more then happy to let me do that. A friend got the Tuna salad which she enjoyed. I am not a fish person but she let me try her tuna and it was actually pretty good. The chips that come to your table are okay, I'm not a fan of the sweet potato chips, the texture and taste just do not work for me. So when I go I ask if I can just get corn tortilla chips, and they are happy to do that too. The salsa is a red smokey salsa which is good, but you can ask for green salsa which is just as good.. maybe better\n\nThe best part of this place is the Happy hour. The drinks are cheap and tasty. The best is the Grand Canyon Margarita which a mixture of orange, cranberry and prickly pear juices, its strong and only 3 bucks. The regular margaritas are excellent, on mondays that have a 10 dollar pitcher deal, a friend and I were able to get three each out of the pitcher. Good thing she lives in walking distance to the place. \n\nAnother good thing about the happy hour is the food. The bar has its own list of items in addition to the restaurants main menu. The best thing on that list is the chicken nachos, so good, best nachos I've had in a long time. Another is the cheese crisp with carnitas, very tasty.  Most of the items on this menu are around five dollars, and for five dollars you get a lot of food enough for two. \n\nI would highly recommend this place.", "business_id": "e5kc0CQ4R-PCCDgb274gSg", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-06-14", "type": "review"}

If we ever return for dinner, I will update, but for now, I'll just say this place is really unremarkable and disappointing and that there are *way* better places to go for happy hour. \n\nWe went for happy hour on Friday around 5:45 pm and sat in the bar at one of the high tables. There were only 3-4 other people in the bar area, (and maybe 6-8 in the rest of the restaurant) but it still took the bartender about 5 minutes to come over and take our drink order. I got the Grand Canyon Margarita (featuring cranberry and citrus juices), and my husband got the Cactus Margarita (basically the house margarita). Both were $3. We wanted to order some bar food as well, but again, it took him about 10 minutes to return with our drinks and take our food order, even though the bar was still quite empty. After already being irritable with the slow service (having both worked in restaurants, we are very understanding of how stressful it is to handle a lot of tables or drink orders, but the restaurant was so empty that there was just no excuse), the slow service was not the only bad part of our first experience at Sam's Cafe. \n\nThe next negative was that the margaritas were so sweet and weak, they might as well just have charged us $3 each for juice. Then, it took another 15-20 minutes for us to get our bar food (carnitas cheese crisp, jalapeno poppers, and southwestern bruschetta) and when it finally came, it was all cold! We noticed that no one else in the bar area had gotten food, but all of a sudden, the bartender emerged from the back with an enormous tray of food and served everyone who had been waiting for food at once. Having worked in many restaurants, I know that one of the main rules of good service is that someone should take food out as soon as it's ready so that it doesn't get cold, and that as a server, I was responsible for doing so even if the food wasn't for my table. Either the bartender should have been checking in the back more frequently for food that was ready or someone else (like the manager, who kept wandering around in a daze but never appeared to be doing much) should have done him a favor (if he was really that busy) and brought it out. \n\nThe third negative was that most of the food was not good at all. I know not to expect too much from bar food, especially when it was seriously discounted for happy hour, but two of the things we ordered were just bad. The carnitas cheese crisp was not light and crispy with gooey cheese; instead, it was a heavy and greasy flour tortillas covered in congealed cheese and dry shredded pork. Not good. The jalapeno poppers and boneless chicken wings were also terrible - Jack in the Box has better poppers and the chicken wings were straight out of a Tyson resealable bag. The Southwestern Bruschetta was fine, although it was very oily, and I have a hard time understanding how merely adding a ton of cilantro to a tomato mix makes something \"southwestern.\" None of the food items was more than $5, but I have been to *many* other happy hours where you can get solid, flavorful appetizers for between $2 - $5. Kincaid's and McCormick & Schmick's are two great examples. \n\nThe final kicker of our bad happy hour experience was when we asked the bartender for a check and he tried to pressure us to order more even though we said several times that we were finished. I believe the exact line was, \"Are you sure you don't want anything else? More drinks? More food? Some shots?\" Maybe I'm crazy, but I don't think you should order more to *make* your experience somewhere better; rather, you should order more *because* you're having such a good time. As persuasive as his \"selling techniques\" were, we weren't (having a good time), so we didn't (order more).", "business_id": "e5kc0CQ4R-PCCDgb274gSg", "stars": 2, "date": "2008-06-29", "type": "review"}

Cheese on top was a sort of creamy cheese sauce, nothing to write home about.  Served on rice, it was sort of dry and not really hot...thus my thinking that they were sort of held warm until served.

I was blissfully unaware of it until my wife decided to dedicate the rest of her life to studying indigenous cultures and schooled me on the following - For 200 years, Native Americans were seen as uncivilized beasts in need of strict re-education to meet the white man's version of civility.  Not until the 1960's (and as recently as 1990 with the passage of several federal laws including the Native American Languages Act) has the United States finally reversed course and decided to protect the various Native American cultures.  Sad, but true, and something your average American probably doesn't know and likely doesn't want to know or care to know.\n\nThankfully there are places like the Heard Museum which does a brilliant job of telling the story of many of the tribes that were located in the Southwest.  I feel it is unduly categorized as an \"Art Museum\" by many instead of an \"American History\" museum.  Yes, you get the art - in the form of pottery and jewelry and Kachina - but you also get the traditional clothing, the traditional cooking, the language component, and most importantly the history lesson.  If you leave here thinking, \"that was just a bunch of pottery and dolls\" then you've totally missed the point.\n\nThe first floor of the museum has a great flow to it with each section dedicated to a different tribe.  Obviously there are many similarities, but the most interesting things are the subtle differences between the tribes.  It also has changing exhibits on the second floor - when I was there it featured a wonderful exhibit on modern Native American art (sculpture and paintings and jewelry).  There is also a heart-wrenching exhibit on the horrific boarding schools the children were forced to attend, often far from their homes and at extremely young ages, to strip them of their cultural heritage.  My favorite part has to be the hands-on exhibit, likely meant for children but I couldn't keep away from it.  So what if I'm pushing over a 5 year old to get a pipe cleaner and tissue paper to make a flower?  There is even a section of the museum dedicated to other non-American indigenous art and garb.\n\nWhat an excellent excellent museum.

This private, nonprofit museum has earned an international reputation for its thorough and sensitive portrayal and presentation of Native cultures, heritage and lifestyle, in particular, those in the Southwest.  The Hopi Katsina doll collection must be one of the largest and most complete in the nation. These dolls, or \"visible prayers\", are as beautiful to see as they are complex in description. The 1910-1945 Goldwater-Kibbey Collection is a must-see for its historical importance and cultural representation. For more information, as well as collecting tips, visit: www.heard.org/katsinadolls\n\nIn addition to providing residents and visitors an unparalleled source of Southwest American Indian cultural information, this museum offers a learning center, shops specializing in Native gifts and books, student art shows, a library and archives, a pleasingly cool courtyard, two gardens and a very decent caf\u00e9 where I had one of the tastiest chicken quesedillas I've found anywhere.\n\n\nP.S., there is no need to correct my use of the term Katsina over \"Kachina\".

Well cancel your flight to NYC for the Smithsonian because believe it or not, we have some cultural options right here in the desert's playground. \n\nI went to the Heard Museum many a day when I was a little girl visiting Phoenix (a much less populated city at the time). From the crafts to the history, the Heard Museum entertained even an 8 year old who really just wanted to play in the pool all day long. Fast forward a \"couple\" of years and I decided it was time to give this historical haven the grownup test. My friends, I was more than impressed. You know how sometimes you visit someplace as a kid and then you go back as an adult and everything seems smaller and just cheaper looking? Don't worry about this being the case with the Heard Museum. They have done a fabulous job of keeping the museum up-to-date, clean and full of great ways for all ages to learn about the Native American culture in Arizona. \n\nSome highlights include:\n\n1. Interactive. The Heard created great displays with information and an interactive game for children...or children at heart. \n\n2. Visual dessert for the eyes. They don't cheat you on historical artifact exhibits which shows that they have a nice group of donors who are eager to keep the museum alive and visually stimulating. \n\n3. Family-fun for everyone. I saw a brochure marketing family-fun days every Saturday in July. Activities include, interactive games, crafts, live performances, etc. \n\n4. AZ Resident Friendly. The admission price was $12 and I cringed a little, but then as if I was meant to get a little cultured that day, they told me that AZ residents receive free admission every second Sunday of the month. Not a bad way to take care of the residents melting in the heat! \n\n5. Cafe food you actually want to eat. To make the most of the day, I ate at the cafe and took advantage of the 85 degree weather while it still lasted. The food...was good. I had a warm turkey and brie sandwich on homemade cranberry bread with the corn pasta salad. Just writing that down made me hungry and want to go back for more. \n\nSo now that I've spread the good word on the Heard, it's time to check it out for yourself.", "business_id": "SG_gEmEXL4ID6RAEinC5Bg", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-06-14", "type": "review"}

I work in Education and I talk to Teachers, Curriculum Directors, and Principals from all over the West Coast.  And,I am married to a former teacher at ASA.

Really?  \n\nMy son started school with all the aprehensions of a 5th Grade student who knew very little about music, was active in sports and was very sad about leaving his friends behind.  We (even he) chose this school because they had a strong emphasis on education and we expected the school to offer my son the opportunity to learn in an environment that was strict, supportive and creative.  \n\nWe were not disappointed. ASA was all that - and MORE! The academic teachers are inventive, collaborative, and very supportive.  The arts teachers are music professionals and perform with and for the students and move them along in the curriculum with such finesse it's like they have private music lessons every day.\n\nAnd, the year was a success.  My son was delighted with all his classes, especially his music classes with Monica Sauer Anthony.  What a surprise to find him begging us to play his clarinet every evening before we had dinner or before we participted in a famly event.  \n\nHe loved the Science Curriculum, the hands-on activity and his teacher's passion  for education.  He worked hard in Language Arts and Social Studies and really showed off his new found maturity and knowledge during Presentation Week.  And the lessons he learned in Life Skills class were really applicable and life changing.\n\nThen the performances at the end of the year were very remarkable and telling. I saw kids excelling in their musical expertise and showing off this success with such poise and confidence that I couldn't believe these were the same kids I met just 10 months prior at our summer welcome parties.\n\nThe school does have a rigorous application process that leaves you on edge just wondering if your son or daughter will be permitted entry into this prestigious, blue ribbon school.  The school doesn't tolerate any bullying and supports all types of students. And, the school is near Downtown Phoenix, so there are issues with the campus being spread across some streets, but those are being addressed quickly as they are building and expanding into new facilities that will offer a number of benefits for the ever-growing school.\n\nThis school is really a dream.

And while the food is typical of most sports grills (burgers, sandwiches, and fried appetizers, for example), it's a great place to unwind or to escape the Phoenix heat.  There are the requisite large televisions tuned to the day's sporting events and plenty of memorabilia lining the walls.  Despite these sports bar staples, the place is actually quite cozy and quaint.\n\nBut while Majerle's is good in the afternoons, it absolutely rocks after Suns or D-Backs games.  The place is typically packed and it's not uncommon to find local or visiting athletes sipping beers on the narrow sidewalk patio.  The bartenders are personable and charming and it's not unusual for one of them to grab the mic and wander the restaurant singing karaoke (and singing it well).

Such was the case last night at Majerle's, former Phoenix Suns player Dan Marjerle's sports bar. With the Beyonce concert across the street at the arena AND a D-backs game at the ball park, Phoenix was a hoppin'.\n\nMy friend and I stopped into Majerle's, which I've been to a few times before, for dinner and drinks before going to see Beyonce. I had a cheeseburger and Cesar Salad. While I realize it's hard to mess up a Cesar Salad, my salad was seriously the best Cesar I've ever had. And my burger was packed with flavor. No wonder AOL  named them Best Burgers two years in a row. We also had a wonderful chocolate martini (with Vanilla Vodka, not creme based) here. And on Fridays if you're in the mood to really start the night, the bar offers a Corona or Pacifico with a shot of tequila for $7 as part of their Sizzlin' Friday special.\n\nMy only complaint was that our waitress suddenly went M.I.A for about 15 minutes when we were trying to close our tab so we could go to the show.  But I'm still going to cut them some slack because this is one of a few fun places to drink in the downtown area.\n\nHOT TIP: A second Majerle's will be opening in Chandler in the fall.", "business_id": "45puCRQ6Vh_IIAy7kkfFDQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-08-25", "type": "review"}

First I totally agree with previous reviews that complain about the location of the TVs. They are in such awkward spots and are only tuned to like two different things, which is semi-annoying. However I can't complain too much when one of them is tuned to Sportscenter which is all I really need as I eat my lunch. My major complaint about Majerle's is that it is a very awkward space. There is a hostess stand out front on the sidewalk but no one is ever there, so you have to walk in and then BAM you are like on top of the bar. So you're in the way while waiting for a hostess which I hate.\n\nOther than that main complaint, I'm not going to hate too much on the food. It's a freaking sports bar. They serve sports bar food. I am not expecting five star cuisine...I just fried goodness that will clog up my ateries and beer on tap. If they have a salad or two so I can feel better about myself, great. For the most part everything I have tried has been good, including the potato skins, grilled chicken caesar wrap, fried chicken salad, kids grilled cheese meal (hey I wasn't hungry that day!) and the house salad. The french fries are really good especially dipped in ranch. The only thing I didn't really like that I have tried has been the chicken tenders. Something about them was just a bit off to me.  Prices are decent considering the proximity to US Airways Arena and Chase Field.\n\nOverall a good lunch spot to grab a beer and get my sports fix, but not somewhere that warrants a special trip. I'll have to check it out before a game sometime to get the full effect.", "business_id": "45puCRQ6Vh_IIAy7kkfFDQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-06-06", "type": "review"}

First of all, it was July and for people like us who live in Arizona, the heat is here to stay and we learn to deal with it. However, for visitors from all around, the 110 degree weather means that they will not eat outside. So we had the choice to wait for an indoor table or take the patio seating that had immediate seating -- and I mean, every seat was available on the patio.

Now, contrary to common belief, just because a sports bar is named after an athlete, doesn't mean that athlete frequents there every day.

They have plenty of TVs inside so even if you don't go to the game, it's still a fun atmosphere to sit and watch the game on the TV. \n\nI wouldn't drive to Downtown Phoenix just to visit Marjeles, but this is definitely one of my choices when I'm looking for a sports bar before or after the game in Downtown Phoenix.", "business_id": "45puCRQ6Vh_IIAy7kkfFDQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-08-11", "type": "review"}

When looking for a historic hotel I usually want something that is historic inside too, and this delivers.  So often hotels are victim to insensitive remodels that remove or cover up charm - not the San Carlos!\n\nThis place's glory days are behind it, but there's still tons to love.  Old molding, original bathroom fixtures and tile (original pipes too, the water pressure can sometimes be an adventure).  Anyone from Phoenix knows that faucets with Cold and hot knobs deliver hot and warm water, respectively.  No longer functional but still present, there is a knob in each room for refrigerated water - something I'm sure travelers appreciated in decades past.  There are no individual room air conditioners - but this is typical for hotels of this era.  Instead the ventilation system uses central air with manual louvers controlling the air flow.  \n\nThe roof top pool was a fun find, and the surroundings seemed to be well preserved '50s vintage.\n\nThere was no parking garage, but the hotel valet parks your car in the garage of the bank across the street.

Depends on your taste and budget. Some would find it gross, others would find it enchanting. It's more enchanting than gross. It is an old hotel. It's not decrepit. My room was clean and nice. Maid service was very good. The staff was polite and attentive and gave some good advice on eating nearby that checked out. Many eateries close by. The rooms are small by todays standards. I was a single, a double might feel pinched if in it much of the day. Bathrooms are old fashioned and simple, but OK. No granite counters, in fact, no counters, which, when you don't have one, you realize is pretty important. A/C was good, but you don't control it except to open/close the vent. That worked OK for me to my pleasant surprise. The room was cool on a 110 day. My biggest complaint was the WiFi. Yes, wireless, but it is \"turtle-slow\" ... dial up slow. Pages were slow to load. If you plan to work online, this wouldn't be the place for you. Otherwise, Internet access worked, but 1 star for that. The restaurant downstairs was very good. Modern. Pleasant. Vietnamese menu. I enjoyed 3 meals there. Fresh and well presented. Ahi tuna salad was very good. Healthy food for travelers. Yes, overall, the place is a little tired, but the room was AOK. It's a little adventuresome, which will fit some well. Kind of a 40's-50's feel. Nothing gross or dangerous or dirty. Convenient location downtown and clean. If you want a decent place  to stay downtown in PHX it meets a traveler's needs. I'd recommend it. I'll come back. The neighborhood is OK for downtown.

Most other hotels in the area go for $120-300, so finding this deal was awesome. My boyfriend and I live in AZ and he wanted to celebrate his birthday by having a staycation downtown so we could have fun with family and friends without worrying about a way to get home at the end of the night. Originally, we were going to book a night at Hotel Palomar but like I said, we weren't looking to spend a lot of money.\n\nI started reading reviews before we checked in and was feeling nervous that I hadn't made a good decision because there were more bad than good things being said. From the moment we got to the hotel to the time we checked out, our stay was anything from dissappointing. The staff was nice and let us check In early. Before we parked we talked to the valet service and asked for advice on parking. They could have given us excuses to use their service but instead, they pointed across the street and let us know that on the weekends, parking in those spots were free. Awesome! Free parking. \n\nOnce we got to our room, everything was clean and the room was a nice temperature. The rooms are small and the bathroom is even smaller but I didn't expect anything else. Its a little ridiculous how many people complained about the raised up part of the floor you have to step over to get in the shower. Wahhh. I barely noticed it, and anyone with a brain should have no problems stepping over it. Also, the shower does fluctuate in temperature when someone flushes a toilet, but it was never an unbearable cold or heat. Once we got settled in we went to the pool, its a cute little pool but by the time we got out there the sun was covered by the building surrounding it, so that was a bummer. \n\nFor lunch, we went next door to McCaffery's. They have great food and our bartender was great. \n\nHonestly, I have no complaints about our stay. Its a cute little hotel and for staying on a Saturday night, there were no dramatic noises going on and I didn't hear anyone talking in another room, having sex, or going to the bathroom. I heard a couple of door slams but I think at any hotel its typical. All the bad reviews are obviously from people who have a case of first world problems. Wahhh, \"no room service\", Wahhh \"the rooms are too small\", Wahhh \"I couldn't control the room temperature\", Wahhh \"there's something I have to lift my foot up 5 inches from the ground to get over in to the shower\", Wahhh,  Wahhh,  Wahhh.

I saw they had Happy Hour deals so i went there a little early to have a drink in their bar or cantina except for they don't have one.  Bummer.  We had 7 people in our party and they don't take reservations so I put our name in ahead of time and just sat in the waiting area.  Another member of our party arrived too with the same thought I had to have a drink in the bar while waiting for the others to arrive.  The owner or manager was in the front at the hostess table and he was nice enough to let us go ahead and get seated while we waited for the rest of our party.  This was smart because my friend and I and ultimately a 3rd guest arrived and we had washed down 5 beers until the rest arrived.  You don't make money with people waiting to be seated.\n\nWe started off with appetizers of a couple of orders of cheese crisps and a side of guacamole.  wow were these good.  I totally recommend these to anybody for starters.  For dinner I ordered the Carne Asada Tampeque\u00f1a.  It was Carne Asada, a cheese enchilada, rice, beans, tortillas and a side garnish of lettuce, tomatoes and guacamole.  Great meal at a great price.  i could barely finish it.  I love horchata and noticed they had it on the menu so I ordered a glass of it and it came in HUGE cup served over ice.  Tastiest horchata I've had in a long time.  For dessert I heard the Churros & Ice Cream was to die for so I tried it.  Holy hell is that good and a great idea.  if I can't have my fried ice cream, this definately ranks right up there.  The churros were hot and crispy and along with the vanilla flavored ice cream I wanted with it, I will be definitely getting that again!\n\nI would give CG 5 stars but I have to take a star off for location.  It is in a dicey part of town but there were security guards watching the parking lot and parking when I left the restaurant at around 8 was a zoo so if you come in during prime dinner time you might have a hard time finding a spot.  While CG is very good unless I'm going to downtown for something, I probably wouldn't go back just for dinner and find something closer to me and in a better location.", "business_id": "BESmH-lmMm34_EefL8X9fQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-08-10", "type": "review"}

Please keep in mind that my experience is only a reflection of a typical \"lunch rush\" Chico's environment - the atmosphere is probably different most other times of the day, but I imagine that my observations on the food will hold true regardless of the hour.\n\nA quick-talking girl at the counter will hustle and bustle you into making your order as speedily as possible, and will then hand you a slip of paper with your order number on it. We all know how this game goes - hang out, and wait for said number to be called. \n\nIf you need to be in-and-out quickly, this is a good time to fill up a few little plastic cups with salsa for the road - there is a salsa bar with probably 5 or 6 salsas to choose from, and there will be no salsa already included with your to-go order. I like the salsa bar...it's always clean and well-stocked, and all of the salsas have a good flavor.  Your order will include a meager serving of restaurant-made (but not quite warm and delicious) tortilla chips.\n\nI have ordered many things at Chico's, and, okay, I understand - it's a Mexican \"grilled\" platter, or the entree includes \"grilled' chicken, but does everything need to be blackened and charred and dry to the point of an unusual \"crunch\"?

Not only do I find the teriyaki sauce that Japanese places typically use to be too sweet, but there is always so much - sushi, edamame, seaweed salads - at good Japanese places that I would rather spend my money on and fill my stomach with. Going forward, Blue Fin will be an exception to this no-teriyaki rule of mine. In fact, I may even go there *because* of the teriyaki. \n\nMy husband and I stopped in for lunch. We both ordered the teriyaki combos (served with salad and rice) - he got beef and I got the white-meat chicken. Both were priced around $6. The food took a while to come out, and there were no seats left inside, so we had to sit outside, but the owner/manager was super nice, offering to re-seat us inside when tables became available and to bring us our food when it was ready. \n\nWhen she brought our plates, we were shocked at how huge the portions were. Yes, there was tons of salad (with a delicious sesame dressing) and white rice, but there was also a *lot* of meat. My husband and I believe ourselves to have larger-than-average appetites, but we could barely finish one plate and vowed to split one next time. So, the portions were huge, but the teriyaki flavor was also amazing. It was subtle and flavorful but not too sweet, serving to bring out the flavor of the meat and not just provide a sticky and overwhelming glaze. The black sesame seeds and spicy powder they put on the table were nice add-ons but weren't even necessary since the sauce was so flavorful. I am, however, docking The Blue Fin a star because the quality of my husband's beef wasn't as high as that of the chicken; it was fatty and hard to chew. \n\nAfter years of avoiding teriyaki, The Blue Fin makes me actually crave it. Plus, it's affordable and has a super-friendly staff. I will definitely be back.", "business_id": "kaIue7GRCmkPzDeHDBTttQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-08-27", "type": "review"}

The spring rolls were very good, although a little greasy. The salad was good, although a little warm. The chicken teriyaki was great, but not your traditional teriyaki. Unlike most places, it seems like they cook the chicken in the sauce so that it's coated with the teriyaki flavor, rather tossing the chicken with the sauce or pouring sauce on top before serving it. That makes it a little more dry than I'm used to, but it also gives it a nice smokiness.

I saw the salad on top of warm rice and my mind wasn't too excited, but there is something about the way they make it where it just mixes together well.  The dressing really makes it all come together.  The shrimp is hot, fresh, and isn't overly greasy; no oil splotches on the plate.  The dipping sauce is, like the dressing, a really good compliment to the shrimp.  Everything on the plate was good and a nice change of pace.\n\nReally friendly workers, nice mix of guests, very convenient parking.

You will be waiting forever for your food and it will be cold. Then when you complain they blame it on being busy and make you feel like an idiot. The owner sits drinking instead of helping out and basically tells customers to shut up and stop whining!\n\n***Reply to \"owners\" comment****\n\nJason, \nMaybe you should get YOUR facts straight before posting a reply.  We waited for over 45 minutes for our COLD food to arrive, only after we asked the bartender where our food was.  Your manager walked over with our ticket and said \" I see you've been waiting for over 45 minutes for your food\" When we responded that we had never waited that long, she replied \" well we're busy and short-handed\" There was no upfront apology to the fact that our food was late, making us in turn late for the game.  Your bartender is not a pleasant person as she would ask what we wanted and not wait for the answer before turning and getting another customer a drink.  Unfortunately, we were seated behind one of the beer taps to begin the afternoon and seemed to be forgotten as we sat with empty glasses.  We did NOT demand to speak to the owner.  He had said hello about 20 min earlier and when the manager came over, my mom asked to speak to the owner.  She said he's not working today, and my mom replied,\" I just saw him\", your manager then said \" I'll go get the owner for you.\" There was no demanding there.  Also please learn to read before posting replies as I stated the owner BASICALLY said to shut up and stop whining.  The way he spoke to us is the reason why we would never come back.  Also you posted in my mom's review that our food and drinks were comped.  We sent the food back as it was cold, so it wasn't comped, and we only had 3 beers between the two of us, the last two were just poured and left undranken.   Get your facts straight before coming on here and calling people LIARS.... Maybe if your bartender would have been a little more personable and offered an apology or something in the first place this whole situation would have been remedied.", "business_id": "j8nyAaN_w5t6wYv-ni23sg", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-06-24", "type": "review"}

We had a group of out of state friends in town for a tattoo expo which ran til 11pm and then of course they had to pack up for the night. So hungry and determined to find food we landed here after deciding it was just to close to cut off for food service at The Duce where we had orginally plan for and then being turn down at two other places. \nNeedless to say we strolled up and joined other displaced expo vendors looking for the same thing...FOOD! Even then the place was packed and we promtly order some food. Warning to the wise if your hungry do not order a pizza! The guy who took our order never happened to mention that the rest of our party of 8 we all be finished with their plates long before our pizza would even arrive. My hubby who is never a blunt one made it pretty clear he was straving and when the server offered to bring out a side of fries for him we should have taken that as our hint. Which fries would have been great if those ever arrived which they did not. \nEveryone else is our party that had got the wings argeed they were good, the one who order the lobster bisque had to send it back to be reheated though the second one was just as cold. They tease you with a picture of sliders on the late night menu even though they are only served on I believe Monday they had said. Others had the flauntas and just said they were OK. When our pizza arrived I think we were past the point of even caring if it was good or not. \nOn the positive side I would say this place is fairly priced for what you get and they seemed to have some good specials going for locals on certain days and thankfully on that night for us still serve food late night. Just next time it would be nice for them to actually mention the delay in the pizza when ordering if they would have been done we would have been fine and probably order something else to hold us over. Or even possibly following thru on bring out items when they say they will.

The outdoor area was filled with people sipping drinks and waiting to be seated and the vibe felt really hip and urban, just like the artwalk taking place in the surrounding streets. \n\nThere was a wait for a table, so we put our name down. As many reviewers have already mentioned, the hostess isn't particularly warm and is actually a bit snippy. I don't think it makes the place seem more desirable if the staff is aloof and plays hard to get, but hey, maybe some people fall for that. We then walked over to get a drink at the bar. I tried the Pad Thai martini (a mix of lemongrass and basil, I think it was). It was strong, for sure, but for $12, I expected a slightly larger portion. The flavor was also really strong (very herbal) and not particularly tasty. \n\nWe were seated inside after about 20 minutes of waiting, which wasn't too bad given how busy the area was for First Friday. Unfortunately, however, we were seated at this high, communal table - across from each other, but sandwiched (literally) between two other parties. We didn't necessarily have a problem with this arrangement, but what did piss us off was how *ridiculously* uncomfortable the bar stools were. They were made out of this hard metal criss-cross material and literally dug into the backs of our thighs. My husband commented that they should have sat on them before they decided they would make sense for seating during a meal. On a positive note, the inside was decorated in this really cool urban-loft style and being so close to the kitchen created a really homey feel (although on this 110-degree night, we couldn't \"stand the heat\" but couldn't really \"get out of\" or away from the kitchen). \n\nOur server was friendly enough and the food was definitely decent. For our appetizer, we tried the Thai spring rolls - the rice paper was the right softness and the dipping sauce was awesome, but the rolls were literally stuffed with vermicelli and contained just one miniscule shrimp each. The entrees - the shrimp sesame salad and chicken Xa ho Fun noodles - were definitely good but nothing mindblowing. The veggie selection in the noodles seemed random and not necesarily well-thought-out. The sauce on the noodles was tasty and perfectly spicy, but there was too much of it, so the noodles got kind of soggy. The salad was also overdressed, and the dressing was too salty. However, the shrimp in the salad was amazing quality - we've had a lot of bad shrimp here in Phoenix, so this was a huge plus. To sum it up, for every positive we encountered in our food, there was a drawback. \n \nActually, now that I stop and think about it, the whole negative-for-every-positive thing kind of describes our whole experience at Fate. We loved the bar area but weren't big fans of the drinks. We appreciated the cool vibe of waiting outside a house to be seated but weren't thrilled with how inhospitable the hostess was. We thought the inside of the restaurant was well-presented but hated the imprints those horrible stools left on our thighs. We thought some aspects of the food were great but that others were sub-par. Didn't love all of it, but didn't hate all of it.

So that being said, this review pertains only the bar. This bar is AWESOME- it reminds me of all the outdoor bars in Patong Beach in Thailand. Big circular bar outdoors-we checked it out during this past First. Awesome, chill feel with red mood lighting. If you can't sit at the bar, there are other tables and chairs on the patio as well as a sofa. Good selection of drinks, and the DJ was playing some righteous chill tunes. Really made for a nice atmosphere that makes me want to go back for more. I think it will be PERFECT in a few months when the weather cools down a bit-the fan and outdoor coolers make it bearable, but it's still a little. That still did nothing to detract from the awesome atmosphere that the bar has. During First Friday, it feels like the center piece of an awesome black party. The only reason I'm giving 4 instead of 5 stars is that it takes forever to be served. These bartenders are justifiably busy, but to wait and have no one acknowledge that I'd been waiting is costing them a star on this rating.

Their hummus was so delicious, full of flavor but not overwhelming, that I had to thank our server for her wonderful service and the amazing food. My only complaint would be that they do not offer wheat pitas (though they can substitute for multi grain bread, focaccia, or sour-dough).\n\nMy sister always enjoys ordering their Tuna Slam Sand-which (excellent mix of albacore tuna, mayo and greens without the overly intense mayo flavor), and my husband tried their Panini Cubano. Both enjoyed their orders, and my husband raved about his panini. \n\nI love Paisley's atmosphere, choice of music and unique decor. The service can be a bit slow, but you can't rush delicious food.

I love the chips & salsa and 2. They have my all time favorite chile relleno.\n\nThe Chips & Salsa\nMi Amigos gives you some of the largest chips I've come across.  They are little half tortillas that are crisp and simple.  The salsa is heavy on the cilantro, but its chunky with good flavor.  I'm all about the big chunks of tomato in my salsa.\n\nMY FAVORITE CHILE RELLENO\nI've been ordering this big beast of a relleno stuffed full of chicken for years.  The chicken inside is simply grilled chicken and its covered in some gooey cheese.  The pepper is a little bit random in heat - sometimes I sweat like a B while shoveling away, and sometimes it's rather mild. The batter they cook it in is different than most rellenos, its sort of crumby and dark, but delicious.  The sauce is some simple looking orange sauce with some sour cream in it - sorry, I can't cook so my skills in ingredient identification suck - I just know it's delicious!  My favorite.  I order it every time I'm there.\n\nI visit this Mi Amigos every time I'm in the area looking for food.  I can't remember the last Arizona Center place I ate at other than Mi Amigos.  I have to have the relleno any time I'm near.", "business_id": "-lOSaCuBRAvX5JBifx-EMw", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-07-08", "type": "review"}

No ogling, no rude comments, none of that immature bullshit.\n\nWe went here last night from 7pm until a little after 10pm, and didn't get a refill on water until just before we left, even though I'd downed the first cup within ten minutes of arriving and also ordered \"hot\" wings (the Daytona, which is hot sauce and bbq sauce mixed together, I guess.  Not hot at all).  The wings are tiny and completely overcooked.  I do not recommend these at all.\n\nFriend #1 ordered the boneless wings, which are a joke.  I ordered them last time and assumed it was just a fluke when they brought out a plate of ten tiny (smaller than Chicken McNuggets) hardened pieces of overcooked chicken.  I'm not the type to send things back at restaurants, so I just tried to pretend that I was eating some sort of food, and not little pieces of rubber.  However, Friend #1 received the same thing this time.  Tiny pieces of very chewy....chicken?  Maybe.  I do not recommend these at all.\n\nFriend #2 ordered a dozen hot wings.  Took just shy of an hour for them to arrive.  The waitress would pop up every fifteen minutes or so, and say something like, \"Oh my gosh, they haven't brought those yet?\"  When they did come out, they were tiny and overcooked, and also quite cold.  I do not recommend these at all.\n\nOverall, the worst restaurant in Phoenix, I think.  If they didn't offer the fight with no cover, they'd have literally no redeeming value.  I'm just going to Buffalo Wild Wings next time (they have a $5 cover and a drink minimum, but it has to be worth it).  This place needs to close down for a few months and reevaluate, or just go away entirely, like every other business in the AZ Center.\n\nOh, PS, they have never brought out our correct bill.  Always has a bunch of random crap that no one ordered on it, and the girls act all put out when we point out that no one ordered half of the bill that they're trying to charge us for.  Keep an eye out on that receipt.", "business_id": "qsWxbgQwuomXvMseg23DGg", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-08-08", "type": "review"}

There hasn't been a time where I have had a bad experience here. The food has always been on point, customer service was not bad, and really nothing to complain about. I've always ordered the medium/hot wings along with the curly fries with cheese and a side salad. I've brought friends with me on several occasions, and they never had anything negative to say.\n\nIt's been a month or so that I've been here and decided to try the take out. Same order same expectations. Now I know every business will have their bad days but this is the first time here that has probably made me decide I will not return.\nI open the to go boxes and let's just say I was surprised. The fries looked extremely dull and I picked one up to try it; cold. Cold, dull fries that had an old taste to them. Not like they were sitting around but old as if they were out for a long time. Super soggy and just absolutely terrible. The wings were undercooked and the hot sauce that I usually get tasted bland and cold. It was as if they just battered them up with canned sauce. No flavor, and not the amazing wings I usually get there. I am thinking is this really the place I talk so good about?\nI read the negative reviews thinking this is not true. I now believe the \"hype\" regarding the issues they are having here. It's amazing how down under it has gotten since I've last been here. It's not like the food was waiting for a long time, I got there before it was even ready.\n\nHonestly, I am extremely disappointed. The manager was not much help and that just comes to show how down under this business is heading to. I don't know what else to say, 30$ that has gone to waste. Ate a few of the fries and maybe half of a wing that was disgusting.\n\nTo simply put it, it is very unlikely that I will return anytime soon.

Back then (about 30 years ago) it was one of the few restaurants in town, so the wait was considerable. That lobby is still there with the same stand-up video games and circa 20s sofas (reupholstered of course) and the restaurant still seems to be a place for an adventurous child to find hidden secrets and exotic places. Back then the wait to sit in the trolley (since removed and replaced with a replica) was over an hour. As a child the mystique of its cavernous faux Tiffany-style glass-enclosed \"rooms\" was a wondrous delight that could now only be matched in adult scale by the extravagance of the Winchester mansion of California.\n\nI've been back 4 or 5 times in recent months and am consistently surprised that for a restaurant that could seat a thousand, I must wait 10 to 15 minutes for a table. Tonight I was making my way back across the cavernous lobby to leave when I was called to be seated. I should have just left.\n\nOnce inside I discover why the wait is so long. Every table as far as the eye can see is covered with dirty dishes and glasses, but no one is sitting at any of them. How long they have been in such a state is anyone's guess, but tonight I was able to sit in the fake trolley and so was afforded the opportunity to see that only 2 of them were cleared throughout my entire meal. What a disgrace! You all should be ashamed of yourselves!\n\nOur server was extremely attentive and did his job with careful precision and punctuality. The only major error was when he kicked a piece of trash in the small walkway between trolley tables to a nearby corner. Oh my God; I just wanted to get up and go over and pick it up. Was that a crust of bread??!?!?! When he first arrived at our table, I asked if he needed some help clearing all these tables. What a disgrace! He told me that when he walked in, there were 130 people waiting in the lobby.\n\nThe food was exactly as expected -- somewhere below the quality of an Olive Garden. I think someone else here may have made the same comparison. Pasta overcooked to the point it can just barely hold its form anymore; meat sauce so gritty you wonder if this is what Manwich tastes like. Meatballs well formed and of overall good taste, but spiced with powdered everything, and old powder at that. Parmesan passed my test with little recognizable filler and of good body. Didn't taste like sawdust.\n\nBread obviously ordered by the hundred thousand, and obviously arrived frozen and partially cooked, Shamrock style, with the finish in a quick-heat just before serving. The cutting boards still have a second indentation for the garlic butter, but none was served. The butter that arrived was nothing like butter, but instead a whipped watery creamy colored stuff that should be the last straw that finally convinces you to throw down your napkin and sue \"I can't believe it's not butter\" for false advertising.\n\nThe salad was mostly dismal. The only redeeming ingredient in the entire meal was the olive oil used in the \"balsamic\" vinaigrette. I had to take several concentrated bites to try to convince myself that the red-wine vinegar they were trying to pass off as Balsamic was not actually cleaning-grade white vinegar, but the olive oil was really nice. Never mind  the basil or parsley or the whatever-name-you-can-come-up-with tasteless flakes in the dressing that had to be at least 20 years old. Ew.\n\nThere are times when I wish I could go back. I wish I hadn't dined under the artistry of chefs who celebrate the creation of cuisine. I used to be able to enjoy this crap, oblivious to the talent that's out there. Unfortunately Phoenix is slowly but surely returning to its roots. Where is our talent?

Money was tight back then and TOSF soon became one of our favorite eats.  I hate to compare this place to a fast food restaurant, but this place is like the \"McDonald's\" of Italian food.  Now let me explain that.  When you go to McDonald's, it doesn't matter where in the country, or in the world, you are, when you order a cheeseburger, you know what you are going to get.  It's consistent and it's inexpensive.  The same can be said for TOSF.   It's decent quality Italian food, at very fair prices.  \n\nI've sampled many things on the menu over the years, but lately I always get the same thing when we go out for dinner; Spaghetti and Meatballs.  I know most people wouldn't think to order something that you can make at home out, but I like a good meat sauce and my wife would rather have marinara.  So, for me, it's a treat.  She adores the spaghetti with mizithra cheese and brown butter, although, last night she ordered the meatloaf and said she found a new favorite dish.  I'll have to try it next time.  I'm usually the one that goes for the \"soul food\".  Dinner is usually served with a salad, and their creamy pesto dressing (similar to a ranch) is really amazing.  Remember to save a little room for desert, because you always get your choice of a scoop of ice cream, spumoni, or sherbet afterwards.\n\nTOSF is definitely kid friendly.  It is a true family restaurant.  The trolley car in the middle of the restaurant is always a draw with the little ones.  There can be a wait sometimes.

I was excited we might eat at one of my favorites along Central (Postino, Fez, Windsor).  But, since it was really my friend's day, when she asked about restaurants, I deferred, \"What did you have in mind?\"  She said \"How about The Old Spaghetti Factory\".  I tried not to let my lip curl in disgust (I dislike all chain Italian restaurants).  But, again, deferring to her, I said \"Sure, I always like to try new places.\" \n\nWe were seated fairly promptly.  The decor was kitschy, but we had a nice table with comfy chairs.  Our waiter brought bread and took our drink order.  I asked if their iced tea was caffeine free, he said \"Oh yes, we brew it ourselves.\"  WHAT?!?.  Just because they brew it instead of taking it from a soda gun doesn't guarantee it's caffeine free.\n\nHaving been there before, my friend knew she wanted the lasagna.  Being Italian, I never order lasagna in restaurants as I know mine is better ( I make 2 kinds of lasagna, regular that just takes a few hours, and then the grand dame,  lasagna bolognese, which takes 2 days, with all the braising and creating 2 separate sauces).  I had a bad vibe theirs wouldn't hold a candle to even my \"lazy\" lasagna.  I chose spaghetti with mizithra and brown butter, supposedly their signature dish.  All entrees come with bread, soup or salad, and tea or coffee.\n\nOur waiter took our order.  My friend asked for the lunch portion of lasagna.  The waiter replied \"Oh, we don't have lunch portions of the lasagna, just dinner size.\".  My first thought: it's FROZEN.  My second thought: nice way to up-sell buddy.  She had cream of broccoli soup and I had salad with pesto ranch on the side.  Our waiter delivered the soup and salad, but forgot the dressing.  He said he'd be right back with it.  When we flagged him down 5 minutes later, he was surprised I had no dressing, saying \"I told the busboy to bring it to you.\"  This must have been the same busboy who was so busy doing anything but his job that a nearby table remained uncleared during our entire meal.  Soon, he dropped off a small silver dish containing a pesto ranch popsicle.  Yes, the dressing was FROZEN.  I had to stir it so it would thaw enough to pour.  The salad was a big plate of pedestrian iceberg, cabbage and carrots with packaged croutons that appeared as if they had been chopped in half to stretch them.\n\nMy friend was sorely disappointed with her lasagna, saying it didn't taste like she remembered from past visits.  I told her it was probably because it was frozen pre-packaged, which was why they couldn't cut it into lunch portions.  My spaghetti with mizithra was so bland, I'm sure any finicky toddler or nursing home patient with a digestive disorder could have tolerated it (and I'm not insulting seniors or anyone with digestive issues, as my husband suffers from one, I'm just commenting on the utter lack of flavor in this dish).  Where's the garlic?  Where's the nutty goodness of brown butter?  I don't think what they used ever came from a cow, I'm quite sure it was industrial grade margarine.  \n\nSadly, even their bread wasn't all that flavorful.  It looked and smelled good when it first arrived hot to the table, but shortly after, it seemed extremely flavorless and the \"butter\" added nothing.\n\nAll I could think was \"Robert Irvine would have a field day trying to fix this place on Restaurant:  Impossible!\", then I remembered he doesn't work with chains.  As Daniel D alluded, Olive Garden would have been a better choice.", "business_id": "DlCtdbceo4YNSI53cCL2lg", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-06-12", "type": "review"}

So my wife, our two foster kids, and myself met our daughter and her boyfriend here. We had a 6:30 reservation, we were actually there early. This is were I had the only problem of the evening. When we first arrived, I told them who I was and we are early. The hostess said that we were going to need to wait for our reservation time. While I was in shock, I asked her. So if we just walked in now and asked for a table, we would be seated now? This is when she said one moment so she can talked to her supervisor. She sat us when she came back and apologized. I told her there was no apology needed. She asked us if we needed them to keep the birthday cake Denise baked in storage which was very helpful.\nNatalie the birthday girl was in awe on the decor of the restaurant and very excited that we ate in the trolley. I ordered the gluten free baked chicken and pasta. It was better then I thought it was going to be. At my age, I am trying healthier food options. Although the chicken was a little dry, pasta was very good. The two girls had spaghetti and meat sauce and had no complaints from them. Not going into detail on what everyone else had, but there was no complaints from them either. When we were finished, they came out with the cake, ice cream, and sang Natalie the birthday song. I believe this is going to be a great memory for her. I know that Natalie never had the chance to experience things like this. Something that myself and very many people take for granted! \n\nThe food here is good, I have had better. \nThe service here was great, even with the little issue.\nThe reason why I gave this place the 5-star, because it gave Natalie a time of her life!", "business_id": "DlCtdbceo4YNSI53cCL2lg", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-06-12", "type": "review"}

We ordered the ravioli, spaghetti with Italian sausage and 2 kid's macaroni and cheeses.  I love that their meals are served \"complete\" with a salad, bread, and ice cream or spumoni.  Even the kids got milk, applesauce, and dessert as well.  \n\nThe kids loved the train, and the staff encouraged us to explore and ring the bell.  We quietly tip-toed through the car (between other eating patrons) to the front and rang the bell while both were over the moon with excitement.  \n\nTasty lunch with great customer service - thanks OSF Phoenix!", "business_id": "DlCtdbceo4YNSI53cCL2lg", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-07-24", "type": "review"}

So, I was sorely disappointed with the Phoenix branch. I had the spaghetti squash with spicy marinara, it came with soup/salad, bread and spumoni. The bread is a sourdough loaf, not my preference so I didn't eat it. I can't eat lettuce/cabbage and they only had minestrone soup with cabbage and salad as the side choices...they offered me a child's applesauce as the only possible alternative; I opted out. I was very hungry by the time the spaghetti squash arrived, but it was over-cooked and dried out plus a significant lack of sauce. The waiter was nice enough but barely saw him and when I did he was pretty rushed and frantic...there really weren't that many people there.

It's not horrible, but its not the greatest either.\n\nFor starters, they are tucked away in a really weird spot.  Its in the ASU center, and if you did not know it was there, I really don't know how you would find it.  It's also a rather small location, so there is actually no seating inside the place.  All you can really do is place an order, and take it to go.\n\nThe few times I have been in there, the service has been pleasant, but not great.  There is a guy who has waited on me before, and I believe he is either the owner, or a manager.  He's friendly and nice, but always involved in a conversation with someone else.  It seemed like the people that he was talking to were his friends, and I had to wait for him to finish talking to them before I could get any service.  Plus, its not like hes neccesarily \"waiting\" on them.  He's \"shooting the breeze\" so to say.  Can you say annoying?  Im on lunch hour here people, I don't have time to play games.  I just want to eat my lunch and be done with it, ya know?\n\nAnyways, they seem to have a decent menu of items, but the prices are ridiculously expensive.  I can't believe how much this guy charges for his sandwiches.  like $7 for a cheapo sandwich.  The food is good, and the portions are good, but I just find that its not worth the $7-$10 at all...plus you have no seating, and you ignore me when I come in?  yyyeeeaaa.", "business_id": "kR5i58Pcse1FD9tk-yYLlA", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-07-01", "type": "review"}

My only complaint is the punch cards, I cant keep track of them, wish they would just keep track of my license plate.\n\nAlso important if you have an expensive car - there are NO brushes or automated things touching your paint.

They missed several bugs on the front and grill and they also left some water spots from not drying right away. I brought it up to a guy who seemed to be supervising and they quickly went over those spots and made it look much better. \nCONS: 1. A bit slow, even for a Tuesday afternoon (12:20 pm to be exact). Waited for about 45 minutes before my truck was finished and it was not even that busy so you better have some time to spare. 2. A bit too much shine in the interior. I love the smell, look, etc., but not when it is still dripping and running on and down my dash board and door handles. They also went over the speakers so hopefully it did not drip in there. It seems they only went over the areas where they can reach. I have a Crew Cab truck and some of the deeper areas were not shined as the rest of the interior. 3. Missed several spots. If I wouldn't have inspected the truck before driving off, I would have had an average clean. I had to point out the areas missed so more attention to detail would be nice. \nOverall, I will definitely return here!! I love that they are approachable and honored my requests and suggestions right away. I'm not super picky but I do expect a good job for a $25 wash.

I am probably one of very few people who will order it when I see it on a menu. Having only been to the Downtown Deli once before, I did recall them having one on the menu.\n\nSo doooown the 8 floors of stairs I go ( I have to earn the egg salad). \nAs I walk in (just before 2pm) it was relatively empty.   I stopped and stared at the menu. One of the guys working there highly recommended the pastrami, even giving me a sample over the counter. Now I was torn....until I saw my answer.  The best of both worlds...the Vic's Madness!  Egg salad AND Pastrami.....I chose the marble rye as my base. First an egg salad layer topped with another piece of marble rye then a generous stack of pastrami a couple slices of Swiss cheese and topped with another slice of rye. \nNever enough mustard, I added extra deli mustard to both layers of the sandwich. Choosing the french fries in a rush, I wish I had gone for the potato salad or the fruit cup. Don't get me wrong the fries are very good, extra crispy and seasoned just wish now I had taken that option. At $9ish without a drink it can seem a little pricey relative to Subway (which is just another block or so up the street), I can assure you that this is MUCH better!! \nNow I have \"half\" a sandwich (technically a whole) left for later....", "business_id": "9BH18avE46LlHMvJn67MaA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-08-12", "type": "review"}

(Note if you buy a big cup you can bring it back for a deal on the limeade.)  Also note that if you check in on your Yelp phone app, Zoe's gives 10% off; every 3 check-ins gets you a free piece of chocolate cake.

I can just order the side of Greek salad, which is like $2.80 and I feel pretty full after that.  But I usually also get a side pasta salad or side of hummus also.  The other stuff on the menu is not that great, nothing spectacular -- oh except for the chocolate cake!

The management toted that this place is quiet, we both work from home and usually don't mind the noise during the day, it's usually not to bad. Its the loud music, people running up and down the stairs, and coeds throwing up in front of your door from the second story that we're not big on...from 2-4 am. The floors between the apartments are poorly insulated. We could hear every step our neighbors made above us and even the squeaks of the springs in their couch or chair or whatever they sat on in the living room. \n\nThe Apartment:\nNow i will say that they are in the middle of renovated apartments, they are supposed to have new flooring and appliances. But that's all smoke and mirrors. if you are going to rent an apartment facing west, and work from home or are home a lot during the day, expect your summer AC bill to be anywhere from 200-300 a month we hear the studios are even worse. We were moving out this month and haven't gotten our bill yet; there is  no telling what it's going to be. The AC units in the apartments are as old as the Apartments themselves. Which is about 20 years. \n\nThe fridge we had (pre reno) was insanely small for two people. we often had to go grocery shopping every couple days. The washer and dryer were full size which is nice, but they were just cheap generic units. The dryer was extremely loud and had to have the door to the laundry room closed while it was running. The dishwasher broke down within a week of us being there and maintence was quickly on it. they fixed it but it broke again.\n\nManagement:\nWe found it kind of irritating that management was in a hurry to get us into an outdated apartment with really gross carpet and then announced they would start renovating a week or so after our move in: new flooring, granite countertops, stainless steel appliances, fresh paint; Not for us apparently. They informed us that if we wanted to move back out for two weeks and pay 120 more a month they would updat our apartment as well...How about just telling us to hold off on moving in for 2 weeks and redo the lease? \n\nThere are two ladies that work there. Kathy and Heidi. Kathy is very friendly and approachable. A request or concern can be noted and she will handle it accordingly and is rather easy to work with. Heidi on the other hand seems kind of stand offish. We would try to go through Kathy whenever possible. Heidi would sometimes become very standoffish if you made a claim or had an issue with something such as parking. \n\nManagement is also somewhat lackadaisical about the stray cat population in the complex. There were about 4-5 stray cats, including one that looked like its tail was either ripped off or fell off due to infection. Instead of calling animal control to grab the cats they kept telling everyone they were trying to do something about it and decided to actually give the tailless cat a name: \"Nubs\".\n\nParking:\nAt the time of the lease signing they mentioned that parking was tight but they didn't go into too much detail, so im going to spell it out now. \n\nLet me start by saying that we rented a two bedroom apartment and got two parking spots. One guaranteed shaded spot and the other had  free range to park anywhere that wasn't shaded and had a number. This is rather annoying because even though my roommate and i both had stickers showing our cars belonged there, and payed 35/mo for parking. one of us wasn't always guaranteed a spot. There were times where I would pull in at night and have nowhere to park in the entire complex....\n\nThey combat this with a Parking pass system that i feel they just made up this last year. Parking passes are first come first serve. ONE pass per apartment, understandable. If you and your roommate needed passes, only one of you is getting one. This was very frustrating because sometimes you would catch them not playing by their own rules they made up. You would try and go on friday to get a pass for that night but other people  had already claimed passes since wednesday... it was just a pain. no pass and you WILL get towed\n\nSecurity:\nThe area isn't bad and the entire place is gated. However last month i had a homeless man knock on my door around 2am asking for a cigarette. About 2-3 months into our lease there was apparently a break in. I bring this up because The Met DOES NOT have any security guards on the premise. As much money as people spend on these apartments you'd think they would hire a security guard to walk around at night to prevent things like this from happening. I feel like this would also curb the patio parties and the vomiting on people's front doors. They told us at signing that if there are issues with noisy neighbors to either ask them to turn it down to call the police. You shouldnt have to police the complex for them.", "business_id": "dgOqz4wODimYiQJcE8Uvdg", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-07-01", "type": "review"}

Its hard to believe that I'm downgrading them now that they have liquor available, but it's happening. \n\nThey normally have local draft brews at this place for 2 dollars, but apparently when they have a show they don't sell it at all. Only bottles for 3 or 4 dollars. What's worse is that every bottle I ordered wasn't cold, tasted like they just threw it in the ice bin 30 minutes before. AND they kept running out of beers. What's even worse is that the mixed drinks run 6 DOLLARS for a really tiny glass. This place needs to get its act together. I'll be drinking beforehand and elsewhere in between sets from now on. I don't get why the music venues in Phoenix don't understand how much more money they can make at a show with drink specials.\n\nThey also apparently haven't invested in air conditioning which makes summer shows not even worth it. Okkervil River still put on a great show to my surprise, which is the only thing (along with the other great shows i've seen there) that kept me downgrading this place to 3 stars or lower.\n\nThey are also in the middle of remodeling so the place looks kindof like crap right now.", "business_id": "4WcxnNv_lzCIG2eb8O5Mlg", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-07-26", "type": "review"}

Downtown following another amazing Mercury victory.  Hungry.  Group includes toddler. We'd like to walk to food but it's warm so we can't walk far.  It's sad how few options actually presented themselves.  We tried Coach and Willy's first, but as of 6:10 their kitchen was closed.  So, we were led back to Hard Rock Cafe.\n\nI've been here several times after games and all for the same reasons.  It's close. We didn't feel like parking again. The food is ok.  Think Apple-bee's for a few bucks more.  But service unfortunately has been a regular issue.\n\nOne of the last times we were there we advised our server that we needed to be out the door in 45 minutes.  We asked what food we could order to ensure that it would be fast.  To his credit he checked in the kitchen.  After immediately ordering a sandwich and salad, the food arrived 5 minutes before we were supposed to walk out the door with no apology (and a server who hid from us for most of that time). We were 15 minutes late leaving just trying to get to-go containers and our bill.  \n\nThis time - our service was actually wonderful.  Our server was great.  Happy, conversational, refilled drinks much more than usual though the place was quite busy with post-game activity.  The problem came when she had to leave to move her car. You see, with D-Back and Merc games, parking was expensive and full so she had to park several blocks away where the gate closed promptly at 8pm, which we totally understood.  And even though we all saw her handing us off to the manager after handing us the check (she pointed to our table several times) no one came to our table.  Well, after flagging down a hostess, a bus boy and another server who all said they would look for the manager, and we did see them scurrying around looking for the manager, it took 25 minutes to find her and have her walk over to the table.  That's 25 extra minutes with a toddler who was getting tired. How much did we love that? Finally, as our waitress walked back into the building 30 minutes after she left, we were finally paying our bill and leaving the table.  She was so apologetic.   She was wonderful.  The fact that we heard from several folks there that waiting 20 minutes to FIND the manager was not out of the norm was scary. \n\nThey have such an amazing location in the heart of the action after events.  Their food is decent enough that I'd be willing to grab something there again purely for convenience if only I knew what to expect when it came to the service.

Their menu selections has something for just about anyone (they now started carrying gluten free bread) , sandwiches, soups, salads and pastries.  They also have a convenient online ordering system so you can place your order and pick up when you are ready.  \n\nTheir sandwiches are fresh made to order with exactly what you want.  Try one of their signature sandwiches, YUM! Or keep it simple...it's your choice. If you are not that hungry they offer a mini version of most sandwiches (using one slice of bread but super generous fillings)  I personally prefer to keep it simple, generally going for one of the following, ham sandwich on dark rye with everything, egg salad on dark rye (no cheese) with everything or peanut butter (house made) with honey on whole grain. \n\nThey offer a variety of beverages including beer, wine and fresh brewed iced tea. You can feed your sweet tooth here with a variety of pastries or select candies they offer.  A happy hour is offered in the evenings, sometimes with live music.  \n\nThe service is quick , friendly and the ingredients fresh.  Crisp leaf lettuce and tomato on your sandwich are not treated as an afterthought here.

This is exactly 'why' I think many of their rating suffer because everyone has undoubtedly had better BBQ elsewhere, wherever you may hail from, and it takes a stringent push from one's own natural reflexes to resist matching HBs up to 'local awesome BBQ joint'.  BBQ connoisseurs are funny like that.\n\nSo, overall, HB's earns a 3-star based on the following:\n\nPork Ribs - I'm more of a beef rib expert, but these ribs were generous and plentiful in their combo plate.  I was surprised that there was very likely a whole half-rack on my plate.  They are very tasty even without the sauce, with a nice peppery rub that did not dry out the meat.\n\nSmoked Chicken - Juicy but slightly greasy.  This is amongst the most difficult smoked meat to pull off due to the propensity for it to become a stringy, dehydrated mess.  I don't think I would order it again, but the flavor was pretty decent and I don't regret trying it.\n\nPulled Pork - I got a 1/2 lb of pulled pork as a side meat, along with a couple of extra buns to make as a half-sandwich (a glob of meat on a half bun, folded over like a taco).  This is the only time I typically use sauce to counterbalance the white bread, whether its pork, brisket, or sausage.  I was surprised by how dry the pork was, particularly because pork is fatty and juicy, but here at HB's it was extra lean.  I thought I would hate the pork bc of this fact, but the sauce saves it from being a choking bolus of pig and flour.  Now I understand why they typically put this on a full bun and drown it in sauce.  As the 'specialty' of this restaurant, its kind of a gaffe that the quality is poor, but as a consumer, I'd order it again in limited amounts, and only as a 'side'.  Why?  Because I can provide my own perfect ratio of bread:pork:sauce.  Otherwise, I don't think that HB's could build me a pulled pork sandwich I could be happy with.\n\nSauce - If you don't know any better you'd think it was tip-top.  Sure, its 'pretty good', but its most-definitely a one-note mixture.  Too sweet for their peppery rubs.  A spicier sauce would do the trick better, IMO.\n\nCorn on the Cob - Serviceable, but soggy and strangely devoid of spices typical of southern cuisine.\n\nCowbro Beans - Awesome.  Smokey flavor, thick sauce, and chunks of their smoked sausage.  Great compliment to a BBQ dinner.\n\nSoda Fountain - The city's best.  BBQ restaurant staples such as 1a) Dr Pepper 1b) Big Red.  Their 'cola' is RC and they have Hines Rootbeer, Sunkist, Country Time Lemonade, and 7-Up.  They did some solid research on the fluid necessities of BBQ palates.  They also have a fridge of beer.\n\nPrice -  All that, which I described above came out to $33 with a large tip because the guy behind the counter was very cool.  It fed two hungry people during the season finale of LOST, with plenty extra for leftovers.  Very pleased in this area.\n\nOverall - Hey, its PHX, and here we are better adapted to 'fill-ins' for our favorite spots back home.  It happens in every culinary category, from philly cheesesteaks to fish n chips; gnocchi to Q.

At least the outside and inside exterior merited one star. What a waste of 90 minutes of my life. \n\nI have been in the food industry on and off for several years, nationally and internationally. I have been in both managerial roles as well as a server. I also worked as an assistant food editor for Cuisine Magazine in New Zealand. \n\nI was excited to try Cheuvronts as it supposedly had received accolades years before. This was absouletly not only one the worst meals I have ever eaten, but also, the reason I joined YELP. Whenever I experience substandard service or food, I attempt to speak to the manager or chef in order to give them my concerns, in order for them to thoughtfully consider my critiques. In this instance, when I attempted to voice my concerns, I was met with an inept and apathetic attitude from a manager who was skilled at giving excuses and apathy versus solutions. \n\nI am happy to explain my meal in detail. Firstly, one of my pet peeves is when you are seated to a table and a server asks you what you would like to drink as you are being handed the menu. REALLY? This is a \"wine bar\". Am I supposed to know every wine and which one I would like before viewing the menu? Or would you like me to just order a water???? \n\nWhen I stated to the waitress that I would like to view the menu before deciding on wine or a cocktail, she asked if I wanted water, to which I felt compelled to accept as I was being prompted to comply with ordering at least something before my bottom hit the chair. At this point, my niece and I were given waters before the waitress disappeared to continue her conversation with a patron at the bar. \n\nApproximately 12 minutes later (being an ex food critic, restaurateur, server, etc...I notice such things as time) I tracked down another server (where was he hiding?) and asked if he would mind taking our order. As the menu looked appetizing, I asked for recommendations. (Something I relished doing for my customers,but hey, that is just me). He annoyingly responded that he could not recommend anything, it depended on what I liked (really, wow Einstein. Does your chef not have a specialty? Is there not anything you are aware of that is commonly ordered? Are you not aware of your customers comments regarding their meal? Do you not eat there? What do you like to eat? HOW DO YOU NOT KNOW?) \n\nCurious, I asked the server about the Muffalata sandwich, which I have had in New Orleans and enjoyed... for its abundance of meats and lovely olive spread which soaks into its bread. On the menu, it specified 3 meats, provolone, olive spread and pepper-dews. The server had no comment, only to say it was a new item on the menu which people had ordered. It was $9.50. Thinking it was perhaps popular, I ordered it along with a fillet blue cheese salad, which I ordered medium rare ($12.00.) Of notable mention was a basil sangria, $8.00...the only thing I enjoyed besides the decor. \n\nIt took 17 minutes to get our lunch, and the steak was well done. I promptly gave this to our waitress who sent it back to the kitchen. My niece and I then attempted to eat the muffalata sandwich, which Sheriff Joe Arpaio could serve in the jail, as it probably cost only a fraction more than the bologna Ladmo sandwich's he serves in Tent City. The sandwich consisted of one piece of salami, a piece of prosciutto, half a piece of provolone and a smattering of olive spread (not tempanade) on stale dry foccaccia bread. The bread was so stale, we could not eat it, and besides, with the poverty of filling, we wanted our meat (where was the peppedews?). The bread was brick like and more suited to being a construction material versus a food item. \n\nI asked our waitress if we could please speak to a manager, to which she sent over the unhelpful server from previously. I explained I wanted to pass along my comments as it was better that someone told the chef and owner versus going on YELP. He offered nothing but excuses and more apathy...stating he did not know what was going on in the kitchen (as manager shouldn't you KNOW????????) further stating he only manages the lunch hour every 5 weeks (excuses are not professional)! He offered me no solutions, care or even concern....instead he acted as if he was put out and equipped to deal with critiques. \n\nSoon after our medium (still not medium rare) 2 oz fillet (really for $12.00?) appeared on the salad and I no more portioned out a spoonful on my plate when the waitress asked if I was finished and if she could remove my salad. I am sorry but there was no napkin in my plate, my silverware were not placed to indicate I had finished and there was still a full (small and expensively overpriced) portion of salad left. What would indicate I was done??? Hello? \n\nAt the end of the meal, I noticed our salad was removed off of the bill, but I am sorry, this was not good enough!

I'll be honest, I love my wine and I love my cheese. Bonus points if its melted over mac.\n\nAnd they do great mac and cheese. Some better than others- my favorite so far has actually been the spinach and pesto. If you want the chorizo, I say pass. The spinach or the bacon is much better. If you're into bleu cheese, the bleu cheese mac is VERY bleu. Take that for what it's worth. \n\nThat's not all they do either. Their entrees are consistently great. My boyfriend got some scallops that were incredible, though I don't think it's on their menu now.\n\nTheir wines are great too. I'll be honest, I'm no connoisseur, but they had a moscato from Israel that the bf still drools over. It's enough that the next time I was there I picked up a whole bottle, just for him. I've also had one of their mojitos and that was great as well.\n\nAs a note- if you're in for happy hour and get a cheese plate... I really do think its better to splurge and get a regular cheese plate. I got a happy hour cheese plate, and it's... miniscule. All of the stuff that made their non happy hour cheese plate awesome was diminished. 1 cheese instead of 3. No boursin. Fewer crackers. Less of that fantastic orange blossom honey and apples.

It's too bright for sexy-eye wine induced staring and there's some 'art' on the walls that reminds me of a Friends episode. Other than that, the ambiance is nice- but no panties dropped on this date.\n\nThe service was good, and the waiter seemed like a nice guy and was polite. The wine I ordered was pretty good as well, but when I asked my server about 2 different wines, he didn't seem to know how to describe their nuances very well. It was more like- this one tastes good that one tastes better. Well, thanks for that articulate recap... blind leading the blind.\n\nWe ordered some bruschetta- Not good. The fig was way too sweet. It tasted like overly sweet fig jam had been used. When I've ordered this dish in restaurants before- it has come with fresh fig, and for the price- that's what I expected. They could at least put that in the description, because I wouldn't have ordered this if I had known. I choked it down to be polite to my date. It may have been more edible if there was actually some brie on it to counter the insane sweetness. All I could find was a little smear of brie rind, but no actual cheese. If it's brie and fig- put some brie on it.\n\nThe bread used for the bruschetta is very thick- as far as bread is concerned, it does taste good, but it is so thick that each bite of the bruschetta is incredibly dry and I  just felt awful after eating it- too much bread for an app. The other bruschetta we tried was ok. I can't even remember what it was, maybe it had red pepper and goat cheese... it wasn't memorable at all, but compared to the fig one that actually was hurting my teeth due to the sugar level- it was a welcome palate cleanser.\n\nMy date also ordered the cheese plate (cheese on cheese- what was he thinking?). The cheeses were good, but I've had better and more interesting selections. I love cheese! I used to visit my local cheese counter everyday in LA- I have little reservations. It would've been nice to see some Cypress Grove selections, or Sea Stack or Epoisses or Barely Buzzed... something actually interesting- maybe less mild. Phoenix demo may not be into that though.\n\nI guess the point is, it's okay, but I've had better. I wouldn't write the place off entirely- I haven't even tried their entrees, so maybe that's where they kick ass, but the bruschetta is a miss and the cheese plate is what it is.", "business_id": "muCl5p-9ut1sY0aKeUeRhw", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-07-29", "type": "review"}

So I said let's roll!! \n\nOne of the things that Copperstown boast is that it's a one-of-a-kind sports bar, when we walked in I 1st thought eh Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 feeling,,,the guitars  on the wall, other rock banks & Alice's memorabilia on the walls and a store for those would like to buy Copperstown related items (sounds like Hard Rock right?). So that one of the kind feeling was lost on me but he does also have sport related memorabilia hanging on the walls as well and I have to say I was digging the blue glass behind the bar.\n\n All the staff has the \"Alice Eyes\" which I though was kinda cool, our waiter was very nice and friendly, when we got to Copperstown I checked in on Facebook and got 10% off our bill, which I thought was pretty cool too.  \n\nThe menu items are named after people, and I did catch a glance of the \"Big Unit\" hot dog, yes it is 22 inches, if I was with  a bigger party I wouldn't mind trying it, it looks loaded with everything and its 18 bucks, but if you split that between 3 or 4, that's really not bad,,,unless you're the type that can eat the entire dog, Im a Man Vs Food fan and I know Adam had his turn with the Big Unit,,,but anyways back to my trip to Coopertowns.  \n\nSo after scanning the menu, I was ready to try one of the bbq sandwiches, because it said messy but good , and I'm all about a messy bbq. I ordered the Gonzo's BBQ Beef which is beef brisket that had been slow smoked all day then shredded & tossed with bbq sauce and the sides were the nightmare chili and fries. I noticed they had drink specials so I ordered a drink or 2 lol. \n\nWhen I ordered I asked the waiter if the chili was spicy hot, he said yes, because something called nightmare chili gotta hurt right?? And I'm a fan of heat, so bring it on! Well sorry to disappoint yall, it hot at all, and maybe the name nightmare is from one of Alice's song and not for the heat it could have had, it but it was very favorable with a smoky taste to it, I wasn't let down by the absence of heat because I did enjoy the chili, in fact I wish I had more of it. Ok now the fries, I wasn't too keen on the fries they were deep fried and like had been dipped in batter or something because it had little nuggets on them, but cover them in bbq sauce and it's all ok, but I'll try the slaw next time. \n\nThe sandwich which I had been yearning for since ordering it came and I removed the top bun and expected to see a saucy meat mess and was let down I saw shredded beef and little sauce,,,,how is this messy? But the beef tasted so dang good; I just asked the waiter for more bbq sauce and got messy! Over all my experience at Cooperstown was enjoyable, was watching the NBA playoffs on all the screens except 2 screens had the Diamondback game on, the staff was friendly and fun and that right their makes a place Great! I do plan on going back and getting some more BBQ 4sure!", "business_id": "oCA2OZcd_Jo_ggVmUx3WVw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-06-10", "type": "review"}

We never were given any utensils and had to swipe them off another table. My son was starving by this point so I asked that they put the child's order in immediately, which never happened. We ordered an appetizer of salsa and chips which never came out. People seated after us were receiving their food and we had not received our appetizer! Our waitress noticed we hadn't received anything yet and went to go check. Magically our whole order was done and our appetizer came out WITH our order therefore it went to waste by that point. A little too late. My mashed potatoes came out luke-warm and were cold after a few bites. My husband didn't receive his beverage he ordered til asked about it after everyone else received their drinks. The food was nothing special but not the worst I've had.

Great atmosphere, interesting staff and good food.  This is the type of place that the Hard Rock forgot it should be.\n\nJust a few minutes walk from Chase Field in downtown Phoenix, A.C. is a great pre or post game stop.  Plenty of seating both indoor and out makes this restaurant manageable even during high traffic.  Staff is courteous and knowledgeable (even with the required eye makeup).  The staff was quick, attentive and appropriately chatty.  Many will share stories of Alice himself and all actually seem happy to be there.  Plenty of fantastic memorabilia adorns the walls from Alice's career and industry buddies so that even if there is a wait to be seated, you can kill the time by ogling your surroundings.\n\nThe food is above average with solid wings and bbq selections mostly named after music or sports stars.  However,  the real attraction is The Big Unit a 22 inch 1 pound hot dog personification of the former Diamondback pitching great (and A.C. partner) Randy Johnson.  Yes, that's right, a 22 inch hot dog on its own baguette.  This thing is so impressive that bell tolls and the staff shouts its name every time one leaves the kitchen.  You can get yours naked or piled with everything they've got in the back from jalapenos and bacon to chili and cheese whiz.  Definitely worth the trip just to see one of these monsters emerge from the back.  \n\nWhat could easily have been a run of the mill celebrity owned restaurant tourist trap is actually a fun, lively and must see staple of downtown Phoenix.", "business_id": "oCA2OZcd_Jo_ggVmUx3WVw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-07-28", "type": "review"}

This was on their to do list of local experiences. It was also my first time here since moving to the valley. Nobody was disappointed.\n   We came for lunch on a Thursday around noon. We were able to get metered parking right in front of the place. There is a lot in back that charges $5.00 as well.They were about 30% full. We were seated right away and greeted by our waitress immediately. They brought a highchair for the baby too.\n   I loved the d\u00e9cor. Classic rock and roll memorabilia was the theme. Many of Alice Cooper's own items decorated the wall from tour posters to guitars. There were several large screen TVs and classic rock and roll music was playing as well. The waitresses were dresses in attire that also supported the theme.\n   The menu feature's items with a celebrity theme. I ordered the \"Adam Richman's bases loaded big unit\" and a local micro brew. The food was brought out in a reasonable amount of time. This was a 1 lb., 22\" loaded hotdog with a good order of fries. The hot dog was an all beef hotdog on a bun loaded with sauerkraut, \"nightmare\" chili, onions, tomatoes, jalapeno peppers, and shredded cheddar cheese. It was more than I could hope to eat, but I did do serious damage. After I got a to go box, we browsed the gift shop. Everything Alice was available.\n  This place isn't for everybody who is not into the genre. We did enjoy it and will return on special occasions. If you go make it a week day for lunch.

That makes it a fun and exciting place to go to which is good.  On the bad side - the music is way too loud for a diner.  But still it is a cool place to say you have been to.  It is fun to explore the various pictures and props throughout the store and even in the restrooms.  \n\nWe have been there and have been quickly greeted by a friendly hostess staff.  Servers tend to be knowledgeable, friendly, efficient and ever so adequate at their jobs.  I have nothing bad to say about the service staff but then I have nothing remarkable to say about them either.\n\nNow for the reason to dine out: The Food!\nWe have been here more than once and have tried several appetizers and sandwiches.  This is better than standard bar food.  It is somewhere between good and great.  A 3.5 if you will.  I doubt that you could go wrong with any of the appetizers or sandwiches.  The prices are very reasonable.  A lot of people go here for the loaded bases big unit.  Now I have to say that they make a to do about delivering a loaded bases - this is fun!  This 2 foot long hot dog is an excellent hot dog and the toppings are delicious.  I would suggest that anyone in town for a while try the big unit at least once.  It is so big that it can serve for dinner tonight and lunch tomorrow.  Plus it makes for a good story latter.  If you get it ask to have the toppings on the side that way you only put one those that you want.  I don't like sauerkraut, jalapenos, or relish on my dogs but M & J do so I give those toppings to them.  I also eat the chili as a small side.  \n\nI want to give this place 4 for the food but the food is just shy of a 4.  The ambiance and service is middle of the road 3 so in the end this is a high 3 place with a recommendation that it is a must see experience!\n\n\nOh one more thing parking is not easy.", "business_id": "oCA2OZcd_Jo_ggVmUx3WVw", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-08-06", "type": "review"}

I was staying just a few blocks away and needed quick dinner so went to Cooperstown.  Had burgers there in the past and was very happy.  The Following is a quote from their menu, word for word:\n\n\"\"Rusty Wallace\" St Louis Ribs.  St. Louis cut pork ribs smothered in dry rub and slow smoked to perfection, then lightly sauced with Cattlemen's BBQ sauce, and flashed on the flame broiler.\"\n\nI was hungry and came in about 20 minutes before close and was waited on by Matt.  I ordered ice tea and asked Matt if the ribs had been cooked recent or a long time ago and reheated.  And told him that if it was the latter that I wouldn't be having them.  He said he would ask the chef, came back and proceeded to say \"the bartender had them and said they were good\".  Hmmmm, that wasn't what I asked, but noted his answer in my mind and proceeded to order......Yes the ribs with two sides.\n\nThe food comes and it was exactly what I was afraid of, Ribs that had been boiled, then cooked in a oven and braised in marginal bbq sauce.  I ate them and it filled my stomach.  When he came by with the check, he asked \"so how were the ribs\".  I made him go get a menu and read the above quote. And then nicely without being a jerk told him that the establishment was falsely advertising the ribs.  I explained that I have smoked all meats in a wood fired barrel smoker for over 20 years and I would welcome the opportunity to go in the back and see where the ribs were slow smoked, if what I was saying was wrong.  I also explained that I had been out of tea for 10 minutes and I was a big boy and could handle the truth of how old the ribs were.  He then said that he didn't know how old they were.  Then without apologizing, asked how I was going to pay?  Really?????\n\nThe check was $20.45, and Matt got NO tip.  I had breakfast yesterday at a very popular, very busy establishment...No Relation....Matts BB, Great service and added a $5 tip to a $13 bill...no I'm not a cheapskate.\n\nI would welcome a management response to the ribs and the service!!!!!!\n\nSean Gast", "business_id": "oCA2OZcd_Jo_ggVmUx3WVw", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-06-05", "type": "review"}

Jefferson Street\nPhoenix, 85004\n\nIs there a difference between TGI Fridays restaurants? You bet!!\nSome are Franchises and some are corporate owned. Front Row Sports Grill is the only corporate owned TGI Fridays in the Phoenix area.\n\nI arrived at the Front Row at 3:30 in the afternoon - half an hour earlier than I was supposed to. Having never been to Chase Field before I wasn't sure how easily I would be able to park or even it's exact location. That turned out to be a non sequitur.\n\nAs I walked into the building a small paper sign stuck to one of the doors directed me to use the elevator to go to Front Row. The sign said to go upstairs, but since there was no downstairs, it seemed a bit redundant.\n\nThe restaurant overlooks the entire stadium with a magnificent view. Had I been a true sports fan, I'm sure I would have probably drooled, but I was here to sample the fare and to meet companion. I was promptly seated at one of the tables. This was probably the only thing that I did find fault with. The tables not at the windows are very high as are the seats that accompany them. I was so high up that my feet couldn't touch the floor, which made me feel a bit uncomfortable. When I asked for a shorter table, the hostess told me that the waiter's/waitress's for those tables hadn't come in yet.\n\nMy drink arrived quickly, and unlike many other diet drinks I've had before, had enough syrup in it to actually taste good. The waiter didn't even trip up when I asked him for some lemons to squeeze into my drink. He promptly brought a dish of lemon slices, nicely arranged to the table.\n\nWhile waiting for companion to arrive, I had time to study the menu. My first thoughts were that this was a place taking advantage of their location and charging for it. Fortunately, I was proven wrong again and again.\n\nCompanion arrived at 4:00, and we set about ordering appetizers. We shared an order of Buffalo wings which we asked for undressed but with assorted sauces to try with them. They were done to perfection, with stalks of celery and lots of dipping sauces. Companion had asked for the boneless wings, and the traditional were brought out by mistake. No problem for our server, who left the traditional wings at no charge and brought out the boneless ones. Again, while the boneless wings were of a different nature than the traditional ones, they were, non the less tasty and hot.\n\nSince companion was a member of their stripes club (kind of like a frequent flier club), they brought us a complimentary order of house made potato chips. Thick cut, crunchy, non-oily, loaded with Parmesan cheese, they were terrific! I'd eat another order of those any day even though they aren't on my diet.\n\nNext was main courses. The menu covers the gamut from simple fare to ribs and steaks. I ordered their Dragonfire chicken. A nicely cooked chicken breast with a kung pao glaze covered with pineapple pico de gallo and mandarin oranges on a bed of rice with fresh broccoli. The rice was the only weak part of this dish. It seemed over cooked and mushy, and I left some of it on my plate.\n\nOn the plus side, and a really big plus was the broccoli. Having eaten more than my share of the brassica family, most places tend to greatly over cook it, and usually serve it limp and dark green. My usual response is to leave it untouched on my plate. Yet here, in a relatively modest place, I found broccoli nirvana! Bright green, still crispy, and full of flavor.\n\nCompanion originally thought of ordering the ribs, but was so full from the appetizers that they ordered the Cheeseburger instead. Companion pronounced it to be perfectly cooked and nicely oozing with melted cheese. The burger was served on a brioche bun with all the proper accouterments. On the side were seasoned fries that were truly delicious.\n\nService was never rushed and our waiter came back to check on our needs often, but without being intrusive. Sanitation was good in the restaurant and the restroom, when I used it was nice and clean and fully supplied.\n\nAs followers of my writing are aware, I never let a restaurant know that I am reviewing them unlike some other reviewers. I made my first exception at the conclusion of this meal and complimented the kitchen manager. One has to wonder why, if a place like this can serve outstanding food, can't the rest of food service places follow suit? This was one of the most flavorful and excellent non-fancy meals that I have had the pleasure of enjoying in Phoenix.\n\nI rate this 4 stars for excellent food, great service, and general cleanliness.", "business_id": "1-1VcGTL3GyCqUpXZLFTZA", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-07-19", "type": "review"}

You can also access the restaurant with your regular Dbacks game ticket and either sit at the bar or at one of the available tables set aside for walk-ins, all with views of the field.

I always have a couple of beers before a game and really enjoy the experience, specially if you want to see your favorite players during the pre-game batting practice.

That is all this place has going for it. We are season ticket holders and rather than going to our usual pre-game happy hour place we decided to try out this Fridays.. We won't be back. The host/hostess' were awesome. They seemed organized and were friendly. Once we got seated we saw the table tent that stated there is a 1 hour time limit so we got down to business. We all ordered a beer as soon as we were greeted by our server in which we waited 10 minutes for. We ordered an appetizer (the pretzels, which were hot and really pretty good) then ordered our food. I asked for the servers opinion between two dishes in which she replied she hadn't tried either. So I went with the pulled pork( usually a safe bet) then we waited.. And waited and waited some more.. Watched 4 or 5 tables that had sat after us get their food then we waited a little more. After about 35 minutes we finally had our food. It was Luke warm.. And I had asked for fresh jalape\u00f1os in which I was given fried.. I am a waitress at another restaurant and I'm not one to complain but if there is going to be a time limit on the tables I'd hope the food would come out in a timely matter and would have hoped the server would seem to care. She often disappeared and when we finally were finished waiting she informed us that we had about 10 minutes left on our hour limit. We took our check and I noticed the receipt had a survey on it. When she brought me my check back the receipt with the survey was gone. I asked where it went and she wasn't sure. She went and pulled it out of the garbage and gave it back to us nice and crumpled.

I just began going to the Symphony on a general basis this year...already three times! All have been a great experience, and now I will pass off to you what I think about the Phoenix Symphony...\n\n~What To Do~\nListen to sweet sweet music. The business model for the symphony is interesting. I want to quickly point out in this section that they hold concerts at numerous venues in the valley, the prime and good 80% of them being at Symphony Hall. The variety of performances is fresh, not too much of either genre or historical music eras.\n\n~The Good~\n They offer other types of events that you simply don't expect. I saw South Pacific in both a significantly stripped down play format, accompanied by the Symphony itself, was truly exciting to see such a different performance. It makes me into a real music buff, and I truly enjoy sitting back and listening to the great vibes and sounds these amazing musicians provide. The site itself is very pretty and classically done up, and as always, the location is perfectly situated right by numerous restaurants you can stop by at. But once again, before I go further, they are a complete symphony offering all the different types of music, including newer acts which you would usually see in other formats. Its comprehensive music viewing!\n\n~The Bad~\nNot too much. The prices are as is, can't whine about them when the music is top notch quality. They have to make their money somehow. But being as is, prices do scare me away a bit. That's OK. The drink stations are also a bit expensive, and they barely give you anything. I always thought they could extend the food options further to light o'dourves and such...nothing too much. Honestly I am being picky at this point, really not much to be upset about.\n\n~The Down Low~\nIf you are interested in having a sweet date night or simply looking to tickle your eardrums with outstanding ear vibes, come here. Its a chance to get dressed up as well. They get 4 stars for variety of acts, a wonderful facility, proximity to restaurants, and the unique special events they put on.

I cannot recommend highly enough the Pops series for a bit of fun with the family or friends. The orchestra plays almost 200 concerts every year, so there is always a ton of concerts to choose from. They offer a regular series of Classics, Symphony Pops, Chamber Orchestra, and Family offerings. They also celebrate the holidays with special events and community celebrations. \n\nI get tickets for free from my honors program, but they offer a college club program where you can attend unlimited Classic concerts for only $30!

Do not do business with these liars and thieves.)\n\nI was offered a loan modification, were misinformed about process and our payment was increased instead of reduced. Caused us to file for bankruptcy.\n\nOne year after I bought my house, I received a notification that there was a mistake with escrow the way my mortgage was written, and that my payment was increasing by nearly $200. This was not something I was capable of doing, I signed a specific mortgage to make a specific payment. So, in 2010 I applied for and was considered for a loan modification, after signing on with a third party agent who failed to perform any of his duties and forced us to file a lawsuit, we contacted BofA directly who finally claimed to get the unfinished paperwork processed and started the modification process.\n\nThe first packet we receive for our three month \"trial\" period stated a new payment that was an INCREASE of approximately $300. I called specifically about this and arranged an in-person meeting with one of their loan modification specialists at one of their corporate centers in my home city of Phoenix. I was assured every time that this increase in payment would not be permanent and it was a direct result of being behind on my payments. I reluctantly accepted this, and forced my way through the further burden on my finances. \n\nAfter my three month trial period, I received my final paperwork. Contrary to everything I was assured by every level of employee at Bank of America I could contact, the $300 increase was, in fact, permanent. Managers I contacted to complain behaved as if they were doing me a favor because despite the $300 increase, the months I was behind were being forgiven.\n\nSo, they were basically telling me I could accept the new payment and be forced to file for bankruptcy, or deny the new payment program and face foreclosure instead.\n\nIn doing this, Bank of America caused me to file for Bankruptcy in order to keep my house. And were thoroughly unapologetic and unwilling to correct this injustice.\n\nIt has been over a year now, and we have just completed our Bankruptcy and had the case closed. What do I receive in the mail? A statement from Bank of America saying I owe late fees on my mortgage payment (approximately $250) that they refuse to correct, which was a direct result of removing our mortgage from their Bankruptcy department and failing to inform us of doing so. Then, I was sent (via overnight FedEx) a packet that they claimed I requested for a Loan Modification.\n\nWhen we called to complain, we were told that this was just \"mass mail\". Not only is overnight FedEx not mass mail and clearly a lie, their records should show more than clearly that I had been thoroughly through a \"Loan Modification\" program with them previously. This is a gross misappropriation of funds and just further evidence of their negligence and abuse toward their customers.\n\nA letter of complaint was written onto their Facebook page. It was deleted with no response. Bank of America agents are unwilling to correct their own errors and rectify the abuse I have suffered by their actions. I have been mistreated time and time again by this organization and they do not care. I have finally had enough. I can provide any paperwork necessary to substantiate my claims, but it is nothing that Bank of America does not have on record.\n\nWe have filed a complaint with the BBB (CASE#: 438356), and will continue to complain to every organization we can until this is rectified. I have been abused by this organization quite enough, thank you very much.", "business_id": "I3AF57q9EyNALE9rA37o6A", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-07-24", "type": "review"}

Yes, the night before, a breakfast bowl from Jimmy Dean sounds like an excellent lunch selection, but all that pushing of buttons and watching your meal spin in the microwave? Forget it; one \"What are you doing for lunch\" from a buddy and I was out of there.\n\nAthenian was a prime lunch spot for me for awhile, and just fell out of favor. No time like the present to return, plus SB had never been there before today. We took the 2 minute drive to Central and rolled in to a 1/3 filled Athenian Express. Happy to have missed the rush, I immediately ordered my favorite dish, the gyro feta (no tomatoes/onions, add lettuce) with fries, and SB got a chicken sub and potato salad.\n\nFirst issue, no fountain soda? If I can't destroy myself with aspartame in my free refills, it's not a great lunch. Plus, I don't like drinking out of cans unless its a more adult beverage. Fix yo machine, Athenian!\n\nOutside of the $1.50 soda, the meal was as good as always. It was a bit lighter on the feta than usual (and LOVE me some feta goodness), but still had quite a pile. The meat was thick and cooked through, definitely filled up the pita to an overflowing Greek party. The french fries weren't overcooked, which is good because burned fries suck fully. Add in a side of tzatziki sauce to poor over everything, and times were well spent. It's a ton of food for what you pay, and one of the best deals downtown.\n\nMy coworker didn't fair quite as well, but it was more his preferences than issues with the meal. His chicken sub came with a huge breast, which I would think is a good thing, but for him caused the sandwich to be overstuffed (like I said, weird preferences). He demolished the entire thing, so it must have not been too bad, along with the potato salad, which he was a fan of as well.\n\nAll in all, very good lunch experience. I usually get take-out, but the Greek team had their World Cup game, so it seemed appropriate to hang out and watch the \"exciting\" 0-0 match-up.

For those of you who don't speak science, that's the human body and how it works. Love the Brain/Neuro exhibit, explaining how the brain works. One of the exhibits shows how the brain gets addicted to something. One of them was a test to see if you're predisposed (I'm a potential gambling addict). Keep me away from casinos!\n\n2) The Immersion Theatre, where you get rained at, shook, blown and stuck inside a toaster oven, all to simulate how nature bombards the Earth with its raw strength of the elements. You will get wet! Dont' say I didn't warn you! Plays every 15 mins so make sure you time your trip to this awesome exhibit!\n\n3) The exhibits on the topmost floor discussing energy conservation and how alternative forms of energy, and how it trumps the traditional petroleum sources of energy.

While waiting for the show to start, there was fun trivia with buttons on the chairs available so you could answer the trivia. It was fun being able to have that interaction.

I was wondering what Van Gogh \"live\" entailed, because I wasn't sure if I'd be seeing some of the actual Van Gogh paintings that I've seen while I visited Europe when I was younger. (I guess I should've researched the exhibit more prior to last night). All of his art work was projected onto large screens all over the exhibit hall. There were benches, couches, and chairs available so you can sit in one location and being totally immersed in Van Gogh's art. The woman who had given the presentation inside the planetarium had also stopped by upstairs, and she emphasized the importance of reading the projected quotes, because the quotes fully embodied all the emotions and thoughts of Van Gogh, who was deeply troubled, yet full of so much passion he didn't know how to handle himself. You had to enter another room to get the history behind Van Gogh's paintings, since the \"projection\" room wasonly films of the paintings themselves. Interesting take though. I never would've thought of displaying art that way. \nI am grateful for Yelp for sponsoring the after-hours event last night, because it gave us a chance to enjoy the Van Gogh exhibit, the planetarium, and the entire science center in a relaxed setting.

What a fantastic experience!\n\nThe Van Gogh exhibit was amazing.  Kudos to Sensory4 (the organization that created it) for doing a great job of telling the story of Vincent Van Gogh's life through only his paintings, quotes from his letters to his brother Theo, and music.  It was very moving.  Van Gogh was further cemented in my heart as my favorite painter.\n\nIn addition to seeing Van Gogh, Yelp provided some light snacks, a scavenger hunt, and entrance to most of the museum and the Planetarium.

The science center itself was fun and the Egypt exhibit was cool, I did feel as though it was a little small but I did learn some great facts and got to see some amazing artifacts so all in all it was fun. The cost is a little high but what isn't these days? The price for admission to the science center is $16.95 plus an additional $10 for the Lost Egypt exhibit as well as if you want to see any planetarium shows which are an additional cost as well. We decided to see one planetarium show which was called Cosmic Coasters. It was pretty good but be aware that the seats in the planetarium do not recline which I felt was a let down in comparison to other planetariums I have been to. It's difficult to get the entire view without reclining chairs. The show itself was okay but the guy who was our host answered some questions in the end and took us on a virtual tour of space which was the coolest thing about the whole show. If it would have not been for him doing the Q&A I don't think the planetarium would have been worth the extra $8 a person. \n\nThe science center does have three floors with different learning platforms. The first floor has a human body type of exhibit with various interactive booths and displays about the human body. For me this was the coolest part of the science center. On the second floor they have various experiments on energy and inertia including laying on a bed of nails and a centrifugal force spinner, both which are cool and especially entertaining for the little ones. The third floor has a weather exhibit which I really enjoyed and a platform which plays a short video called forces of nature and it simulates various weather conditions.\n\nOverall I think the Arizona Science Center is a great way to spend the day.

My perinatologists said that my pregnancy was very complicated and because I was a HUGE hemorrhage risk, and in too perilous a position to go home, I HAD to stay there night and day, even though I only lived a couple of miles away.  They said I could be compared to a water balloon resting on a bed of nails.  Scary stuff!\n\nIt was the most challenging and depressing time of my life.  I couldn't go home to my 3 kids and husband (even though I could *almost* see my home from the parking garage roof), I couldn't prepare for my new baby because I didn't know if either one of us were even gonna make it.  I couldn't be home to prepare a nursery, plan a baby shower, get lunch with my girlfriends, go to work, NONE of that stuff.  It was SO depressing and scary for me.  \n\nThankfully my team of doctors and surgeons and the wonderful OB (and later the ICU) nurses made my experience as pleasant as possible.   They took care of me physically, mentally and emotionally.  The nurses there are all sweethearts and I adored them, they went out of the way to make me at home.   They treated my husband and children like valued guests, and make the process of my kids visiting me as 'normal' as possible.  That was important to me since my kids were very concerned that I wasn't going to come home to them, and were utterly convinced that their baby sister definitely wasn't going to live.  Thankfully, we BOTH made it home alive thanks to the skilled doctors, surgeons and nursing staff that took care of us both at Good Sam and at the Phoenix Children's Hospital NICU inside of Good Sam that cared for the baby once she was born.\n\nAlso, I have to mention that my bedrest room in the OB Axillary wing was HUGE, and that is no exaggeration, it was seriously the biggest hospital room I have ever seen and would easily, comfortably hold a dozen or more visitors.    WOW!!\n\n\n\nNow for the cons:\n\nThe food was really NOT very good, and I think this is where the hospital truly falls down on service.  I would routinely get bizarre, disgusting meals delivered to me, like a plain dry hamburger with a double helping of steamed carrots, no condiments at all.  WTF?   Or once they sent me a slab of dried up cold meatloaf (no gravy) and two plain baked potatoes, again no condiments.  Again, WTF?   And sadly the cafeteria food is NO better.  The food was greasy, mushy and /or tasteless and WAY, WAY, WAY overpriced.  (My mom spent 4 weeks at St. Joe's a few weeks before I was sent to Good Sam and I could see firsthand that St. Joe's cafeteria is SO much cheaper in comparison.)   Because of the dismal food options my family routinely brought me yummytastic meals from the outside, like Long Wong Hot Wings, Pink Champagne cupcakes from Barb's Bakery, hummus and pitas from Pita Jungle, Mexican food from Juliobertos...you know, yummy stuff.  :)   So for this alone I am deducting one star.\n\nAlso there is a VAST difference between the quality of rooms in the old part of the hospital and the newer OB rooms over in the axillary wing.  The difference is night and day, in fact.  The old rooms are minuscule in comparison to the new rooms.  In fact the old tower rooms practically require you to step outside to change your mind.   \n\nBut the crappy food and tiny, old tower rooms aside, the hospital is GREAT.  The nursing staff is wonderful and the doctors are all top notch.  I wouldn't have gone anywhere else for the level of care and observation that I needed.

I see people complaining about the empty ED waiting room and how they still have to wait hours to be seen. You may be sitting there with your broken hand or with an upset stomach or itchy because of an allergen. But what you don't know is that behind doors physicians and nurses are in the middle of saving the lives of people who need priority care... people who will most likely die if not cared for first. 20 physicians and nurses could be working on that 2 year old who stopped breathing after being pulled out from underwater as she fights to live, or they could be caring for that family who were slammed into by a semi while hoping that the parents don't die so their children won't grow up as orphans. Some people may complain about how their physician is stuck up or how their nurse doesn't give them enough attention. Sure those behaviors are not acceptable, but sometimes you need to be empathetic. You are not the only patient the physician has to care for. He/she may have over 50 patients they're responsible for that day. That nurse may be busy resuscitating that critical patient whose condition is tanking fast. It is not easy being responsible for so many people's lives. My point is that Banner University Medical Center is a great hospital with amazing physicians and nurses who work hard to develop their skills and knowledge.

Now if you're a fan of Mexican food from chain restaurants like manuel's or ajo al's, this is not the place for you. this is AUTHENTIC Mexican food. Probably the best in the valley. I was a die-hard via delosantos fan and shouted from the rooftops about how great that place is. I will still say that. But there's a new numero uno on my list! \n\nThe green salsa is nice and spicy the way I like it. I don't like having to pay for chips. They should be complementary. But paying the $1 for these is worth it. They are fried to order so they come out crisp and hot. The guacamole is creamy with nice chunks of avocado throughout. \n\nI ordered the chicharones because I was feeling adventurous and had never tried it before. Looking it up on Google described it as fried pork rinds so that's what I was expecting. Unfortunately I got soggy pieces of skin. Maybe that's the way they are supposed to be. I don't know. The flavor wad good but the texture wasn't appealing. The menu also states that this dish is \"very hot.\" It was the complete opposite with hardly any spice to it at all. I won't be ordering that again. The bites I had of my nephew's carne asada chimichanga was to die for though! \n\nEveryone raved about the beans here being the best ever... and they got it right! Delicious flavor. Probably made the authentic way with lard, but does it really matter at this point? I'm eating pig skin anyway! \n\nService was great! We were waited on by a lovely older Hispanic woman that has been there for over 20 years. She was so pleasant she kept bringing a smile to my face. \n\nThis is definitely my new favorite Mexican joint, not just for trips to and from the airport.

And the menu offers quite a bit of variety for a wrap shop.  They have some fairly straightforward wraps, and some that are quite interesting (Very Brady Clubster, anyone?).  \n\nI always look forward to seeing the weekly specials.  Sometimes they do not sound intriguing in any way.  Other times they are the best thing on the menu.  I wish a couple of them would turn into regular menu items, but oh well.\n\nAs for sides, I haven't gone wrong yet.  Their soups are always good.  The chips and salsa are quite tasty as well.  But the Pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance is the pasta salad (in my humble opinion, of course).  It's so simple, so tasty and just a bit unique.  \n\nAnd the service, while sometimes slow is always friendly.  They work HARD there and do quite a bit of business.   The girl up front with the pineapple tattoo on the back of her arm - she's a sweetheart and always in a good mood despite how busy they are.  \n\nMy *only* complaint is the parking, which is minimal.  If you can, go early (11:30 or earlier if possible) for lunch so you can be sure to get a spot and not have to wait too long.  There have been a few times where I've driven through and couldn't get a spot and had to either go someplace else or be creative in my parking.  And when it's 110 out, I'm not so fond of parking a street or two over and walking.  Call me lazy.  \n\nOn a personal note, I'm trying to make my way through the entire menu, and so far my favorite wrap: Turk-182.  I was surprised at how much I enjoyed that one.

Even better is their cooking tools section (where you can buy huge tamale steamers, and mortar and pestles for making chile) and the catering menu which starts at $5 per person.  Holy crap.  What a steal.  \n\nUpon entrance you'll see the deep pit outside where some man is grilling all the carne you'll find served inside.

I always opt for the veggie (rice, beans, cheese and guacamole) burrito and am always impressed - the best part being the freshly made tortillas.  I even bought some on my way out to take home.\n\nThe tacos are a good choice too.  The combo plates start at $5.  The carne asada (a little overcooked) was pretty good and delicious in a flavorful marinade, and the shrimp taco was really good - a much better choice I would add.  Paired with some tamarind, strawberry agua fresca or horchata and you'll be in heaven.\n\nI find the bakery to be the highlight regarding the food.

I'll have to agree with some of the below reviewers that this place isn't dead-on authentic Mexican food.  That being said, I love it!  The place is huge, sporting a bakery (said many times before) with unbelievably dirt cheap pastries (not said as many times before), a little carniceria (not as good as Carniceria Sonora) and a huge dining area.  \n\nThe dining area with all its painted mural glory is so goddamn cool that I find myself wanting to just hang out there for hours watching La Primera Division de Mexico on TV and enjoying a nice $2 Dos Equis.  \n\nThe food - that's probably the only tougher part.  Keep in mind it's still pretty good, but there are better places in the area for getting your Mexican on food wise.  The potato taco is worth getting because it's fairly unique, but it came out so soggy that I had to eat it with a fork.  I grabbed a couple of the Yelp-Advertised taquitos as well - keep in mind these are not the Circle K, rolling taquitos.  They are literally just smaller tacos, but they were damn good.\n\nI guess when it comes down to it, I'm an atmosphere buff.  There were so many cool things to check out in this multi-plex, and the atmosphere was so warm that I'd love to head back again soon.", "business_id": "apCfJVnRyaw6oVUBKujpUQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-08-03", "type": "review"}

The staff is friendly and remembered me the 2nd time I ever came in, and every time since.  The ambiance and decor is fun and the food - oh the food is amazing!  I have brought several people here who doubted my claim of \"best in Phoenix\" and they all left agreeing with me.\n\nI confess that I tend to stick to a few favorites and always over-order, but it's all so tasty!  Their super nachos are much more \"super\" if you put carne asada on them instead of the standard ground beef.  I had never had elotes con todos (corn with everything) before coming here, but somehow, steamed corn on a stick with mayo, chili powder and cheese is a winning combination. Who knew?  There is no way to eat this corn daintily but it's so good that I don't care.  I can floss later.\n\nThe carne asada or carnitas soft tacos are consistently high quality but the real reason I pilgrimage here from clear across town is the fish tacos.  The mahi mahi is perfectly seasoned and flaky, with homemade tartar sauce and queso fresco.  I personally skip the rice and beans because they do use lard in the beans and that doesn't always sit well with me.  The salsa verde from the always well stocked salsa bar is noteworthy and good on nearly everything and just a few drops of habanero salsa on my fish taco is enough for great flavor and a little kick without totally setting my insides on fire. If you like ceviche, try the tostada de ceviche - a great little value for the price - shrimp, avocado, onion, tomato and lime for under $3?  I couldn't make it for that cheap!\n\nThe latest development at La Tolteca is the construction of an outdoor BBQ grill just outside the entrance closest to the parking lot. Perhaps this will reduce smokiness inside from the somewhat poorly ventilated indoor grill.  That would be great.\n\nBefore you leave, be sure to pick up some churros and a fruit empanada or two, or even some arroz con leche (rice pudding) at the panaderia (bakery). Even if you (like me) ordered too much and don't have any room left for sweets, they're just as good as a late-night snack once you get home.", "business_id": "apCfJVnRyaw6oVUBKujpUQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-06-22", "type": "review"}

The menu selection is HUGE. My favorites are: The Shrimp Tacos.. SO GOOD. Big hot corn tortillas, with gigantic grilled spicy shrimp, red & green bell pepper, and onions. Their Chile Rellenos are simply the best I've ever had.. They are egg dipped, stuffed with perfectly melted cheese, and the peppers are huge, spicy and ROASTED. *dies* YES. None of that soggy baby food tasting relleno you may find elsewhere. This is the real deal! Papas taco is great, Elotes are awesome, etc etc.. The only let down has been the Fish taco.. it's just kinda dull.. but why eat that when there are the OMFG FALL OVER SO GOOD shrimp tacos. Also the environment is unique, festive, and cheery, and the staff are great too.. the owner is a doll.. I just love her :D Before I forget.. THE SALSA BAR.. Absolutely the best salsa in Phoenix, and if you can't deal with heat, then go cry about it somewhere else.. There are several types and styles ranging from mild to BURN YER TONGUE OFF, and there are also roasted chiles and that marinated trio of carrots, cauliflour and something else I can't remember right now :P  I'm not even going to start about the desserts, cuz they speak for themselves..", "business_id": "apCfJVnRyaw6oVUBKujpUQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-07-14", "type": "review"}

WELL NO MORE!!\n\nMy friend had a Groupon (or something similar) for this place so we went. \nWhen you walk in, you're smacked with the delicious smoke from the FIRE-GRILLED meats they use for your meal! When I smelled that, my anticipation was amplified. You wander past the breads, pastries and cakes, and order from the board and take a seat. Your order number is announced bilingually when ready. Spartan seating, nice colorful tablecloths covered with plastic. Worn floor tile that can take centuries of traffic. You'll see what I mean.\n\nI had the pastor (pork) taco plate with refried beans (slightly runny) and Mexican rice (clumpy), and I accented with selections from the free salsa bar. The salsa bar has whole roasted jalape\u00f1os (you might need to peel some skin off) with onion slices (interesting roasted flavor), another section of veggies, then chopped onions, then cilantro, then salsas in descending heat to the right, begining with haba\u00f1ero red salsa on the left! Made me sweat! WATCH OUT, tell your friends, this is no ordinary salsa that you randomly grab and dump on your stuff. Pico de gallo is at the right end, and the MILD red salsa is next to it. The green salsa is DELICIOUS and mild as well.\n\nSin piedad por gringo: Habanero shot challenge! 2 people or more AFTER your meal. Have ice cream ready. Beer or water won't help.\n\nMy friend ordered two tamales, one chicken one pork, both wrapped in different leaves. Definite authentic flavor. We also got Jamaica (\"ha-MAI-ca\") which is a super sweet red hibiscus juice. You can also get bottled Mexican beers for $1.99. DEAL!! \n\nWater is located on the left side of the ordering counter in a self-serve container. \nExtra napkins (you WILL need them) are not readily available, you must ask for your plush paper napkins. Makes sense, they're more expensive, not cheap fiber napkins recycled from cardboard. \nThere's also a small grocery area. You can get fresh warm tortillas, a few veggies, some pork ($3.99/lb), authentic chicharones.\n\nSuper Inside Skinny: That's freshly made mol\u00e9 in bags at the grocery counter.\n\nCool Inside Skinny: 24 pack of Mexican sodas (Coke, Pepsi, Sprite I saw, but there might be others, maybe Fanta?) in glass bottles for $16. \nI usually buy them for a buck each at the gas station on the fly, but there's the real deal right there. Works out to 66.66 cents each as you can see!\n\nSo overall I'm sold and pleased with La Tolteca. \nTHIS is where you want to take your tourist friends when they come.", "business_id": "apCfJVnRyaw6oVUBKujpUQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-08-28", "type": "review"}

The tripe taco was fantastic - great texture and flavor - and I'd come back just for that.  I'm not sure I'd do the same for the carne asada, which was good but not as flavorful as it could be, cabeza, which was similarly less flavorful than I'd hoped and more reliant on texture for its kudos, and the fish taco, which was buried in sauce and otherwise not worth mentioning.  The tortillas are a little dense and also a little lacking in the flavor department - again, there's better to be found in the Valley (and, despite La Tolteca's extremely reasonable prices, for cheaper).  \n\nThe chilaquiles, however, are a dish to behold.  A giant platter of still crispy but sauce-laden tortilla chips, egg, meat, queso, avocado, sour cream, onion, and cilantro - it's full of flavor, heavy on texture, well-balanced on spice and hearty as all hell.  Paired with an ice cold bottled beer, it's great any time of day.

For lunch I set out to find a restaurant on McDowell. The neighborhood looked a little sketchy and the parking was minimal. I pulled in a lot which turned out to be the incorrect parking for the place I was visiting. Maybe it was a sign because the other place appeared to be closed, so I headed back toward the car and noticed I was in the parking lot for The Gourmet House of Hong Kong. I was hungry and I like Chinese, so why not? \n\nThe place didn't look that big on the outside, but it was very spacious inside. You walk in through the kitchen and the staff takes you into a large dining room. I also liked the chairs- a wooden chair with a cut-out design of a steaming cup of coffee...or maybe that is hot tea...either way it was cool. Speaking of large, the menu was expansive. A lunch time menu had a good selection of food for about $4.50 each. The regular menu was over 10 pages and as I flipped through and saw squid, live lobster, duck, frog legs and other things I didn't want, I became worried again that it might in fact be more than I hoped for.\n\nI settled with the Kung Pao Chicken which came with steam rice. I added egg drop soup and the waitress asked if I wanted an egg roll. I then bumped up to the lunch plate that included the entr\u00e9e, rice, egg roll and to my surprise a hidden fried rangoon. The soup came out almost immediately. First sight told me this was a hearty soup - I took a sample and YUM! Good broth, good egg and a ton of veggies - celery, mushrooms, onion and snow peas filled the bowl making it filling even for a small. \n\nThe food came less than 5 minutes later. The Kung Pao was loaded down with onions, green peppers and lots of peanuts. The sauce was sweet and not overpowering, but there was a subtle kick to it. The egg roll was good, as was the sweet and sour sauce. The mustard sauce was very strong and one taste opened my nostrils. The total was $6.08 for the plate, $1.69 for the small soup. \n\nI stumbled upon this place by accident, but I am glad I found it. That and the sign on the inside proclaiming an award for Best Chinese by New Times Magazine (couldn't see the year) said I will be back next time I am looking for some Chinese close to the office.", "business_id": "ykfTh6HI219NoMsWBxulxw", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-07-27", "type": "review"}

This is one of the first places I drag out-of-towners... usually for brunch. And when I have brunch at Welcome Diner, I usually cannot resist ordering the same thing, the Holy Puerco. Pulled pork, cheesy grit cake, pure heaven.\n\nThe best thing about this place, especially if you get one of the rare seats inside the luncheonette, is that it feels like you own the place. The staff cooking and carrying on are an arm's length away. I love the communal \"Hurricane!\" cheer that resounds whenever somebody orders one of these fresh-squeezed fruit cocktails. Welcome Diner is one of those places that the ambiance overwhelms you so suddenly that you are drawn in to the fun atmosphere... and though you may not be a morning drinker, you can easily be convinced that it's time for a beer or cocktail with breakfast.\n\nI can't say enough about the wonderful poutine here. Other places may just smother their fries in brown gravy, but this place used the white breakfast sausage gravy. Although the cheese curds get a little lost, this is a great way to eat poutine! I also like their choice of either sausage gravy or mushroom gravy if you order the biscuits and gravy (or, do half-and-half, if you must).\n\nThe crowd that dines here is cool, the staff is righteous, and the food is spot on.

Solid food and solid service make this a favorite. Just had the PB&B burger with real deal THICK cut bacon, bread and butter pickles and my favorite chunky peanut butter. Cooked to perfection and delivered promptly, it went down quick with an ice cold PBR. Before dinner I had their version of Sazerac, made with a rye whiskey in lieu of cognac. Delish. Probably my new favorite summer whiskey drink! Also to die for is the bumblebee, imagine an amazing chicken sandwich on a top notch biscuit drizzled with honey. Yum! I'm full as I write this waiting on beignets that were comped because our side of fries didn't make it out, but I could eat a bumblebee because it's that good. So great food, great drinks and a great al fresco dining experience make Welcome Diner one of my favorite spots in Phoenix.

However, the food is AMAZING. We came here on a Friday night at around 7 and it was decently busy. The thing about this restaurant is they make you tip before you get your food. I made the mistake of tipping 17%. While the food came out pretty fast, the staff forgot my boyfriend's drink, and left a whole entree off of our order (which we paid for!). All we got was a \"sorry\". After finishing our meal, we had to wait a whole 15 min for the side of fries we ordered to be brought with our sandwiches. No offer to make up for their mistakes. Being in the service industry for over 10 years, I have to say that that is no way to treat a first time customer whos experience was ruined due to lack of attention to detail. I would have expected a free drink or dessert, but it seems like the staff could care less about keeping patrons satisfied. I can't blame them though, they are super understaffed. I feel bad for any bartender who also has to wear the hat of a food runner AND a busser. Be weary of tipping over 10%, you don't want to regret it like I did.

Fat, old, bored, and heinous looking moms and meth-heads giving not-so-discreet handjobs to shifty patrons... nobody tipping at all (which begs the question, \"why do they come to work?\")... and an overwhelming cloud of depression and angst looming over the whole nasty parade.\n\nThe place was surprisingly active for a Wednesday afternoon. It took several minutes for my eyes to adjust to the darkness - I imagine keeping it so dark can only help given the sorry state of the girls. There's no VIP room that I could tell (unless you count the shabby bathrooms), but that didn't stop the shenanigans going on out in the open for my virgin eyes to see. There were definitely men being \"gotten off\" here which disgusted me to no end. I have no idea how much it costs, but it can't be terribly expensive (and yet it's surely too much). \n\nAnother possible \"up-side\" to this place (depending on your perspective) is that they will serve you an illegal amount of alcohol... the law be damned. This is perhaps another aid to help make the beasts on stage easier to stomach. \n\nSpeaking of stomachs, Eric was right - there were definitely some very pregnant ladies here. Kinda disturbing. My friend decided she wanted to get a dance from either the oldest girl or the fattest girl in the joint. The girl she picked put her mouth on my friend's vagina through her pants and did some sort of heavy breathing and moaning... my friend looked mortified and all she could do was let out some uncomfortable  panicked laughter. She was also groped and molested beyond her comfort levels. \n\nNothing in here was sexy at all - it's basically a really dark and moderately scary dive bar with a bunch of whores walking around with their ugly boobs out willing to do whatever for a few bucks. These girls clearly don't make much money (unless the special services pay well)... my friend and I would tip 5 bucks to the stage dancers (and their center stage is a joke) and they would thank us with a surprised look as though it had never happened before. \n\nThe seating looked like it was purchased from a conference hall at the Ramada Inn that was shut down 10 years ago and the girls looked like they wandered in off Van Buren 10 years ago. I suggest you stay away, however I can attest (as Eric P pointed out) that this was a source of some amazing comedy and laughter... hence the extra star.\n\nEdit Dec 2014 - \n\nI feel bad about saying \"whores,\" \"fat,\" \"ugly boobs,\" \"heinous looking,\" and \"beasts.\" Those are ugly words and I wasn't raised to talk like that - I was just trying to be funny. Also, I regret not mentioning that someone brought in some shrimp cocktails in styrofoam cups to sell. Like, where the hell did they come from? He came in through the front door. The regulars and bartender acted like it was a normal thing for a dude to walk in off the street selling seafood in a dark, dank strip club.", "business_id": "q9B1h5eGBvHjQLF10puUkQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2008-06-04", "type": "review"}

Shoppers here are mostly Hispanic with a few adventurous gringos thrown in here and there.  But workers there are friendly and know English - some better than others.\n\nHoly crap!  I can't believe it's taken me so long to review this place.  I only go here ALL the time for cheap delicious down-home Mexican food, cheap produce, and Spanish rice like Grandma used to make.

I'm addicted!\n\nThe food here is no-frills authentic and seats inside are picnic bench style.  It's not uppity Mexican fare like Barrio Cafe, but it's not Filiberto's diarrhea fare either.  Everything from chile colorado, chile verde, calabasitas, sopes, mole,  tortas, carnitas, chicharrones, tamales, ceviche.  You name it, they have it.   And that's just in the deli.  They have a panaderia with all kinds of cakes, flans and pandulce (sweet bread).  I LOOOVE pandulce.  They even have a jugeria (juice bar) tortilleria, and a counter for fresh cheeses and cremas. \n\nAnd the produce?  Cheap and abundant.  I got some bananas and tomatoes just a little over one dollar.  Don't think about getting any organic veggies here.  This isn't the place.  This is also not the place for low-fat shopping either.  But it is so many other great things that the other stores aren't.\n\nBest of all is the atmosphere inside - it is REALLY festive - like you're at Tia and Tio's fiesta.

The atmosphere is fun and inviting and everyone is friendly. This store has inspired me to create new dishes at home, like my homemade beans and chorizo. \n\nGo here, eat some of their prepared foods that are inexpensive and delicious OR get some fresh ingredients and make something yummy at home.\n\nSee ya soon Ranch Market.", "business_id": "VXIkI9_EbDbYHeO9IzKjJg", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-08-02", "type": "review"}

Certainly one of our famous triple digit days, and as I sat in the passenger seat, bumming a ride from mi amigo, Vicente, I couldnt shake my contempt for his leather seats.\n We drove down Roosevelt in the Garfield district towards Ranch Market, on the way discussing the Alwun house, Rito's, and some colourful housing that we both agreed leant to the overall gentrification of the neighborhood.\n The grounds of this place are sprawling, palatial in fact. I was completely ripped and had on a pair of imitation wayfarers that had a broken arm and kept sliding off my face with the least possible movement of my head. \n Endeavoring not to break them further I held my head at rigid attention my back was grammar school like in posture. I then realized how arrogant and white I must've looked, in my mind I fantasized I was a conquistador with a local Toltec guide showing me the ins and outs of the Aztec village we were entering, then I kinda got sick of that phantasy and pictured myself as a balmy Harrison Ford intrepidly following Albert Molina through an alternate ruinous Mayan temple, all the while expecting danger and betrayal at every corner.\n I probably looked half insane as some of the patrons looked at me oddly, giving me a wide birth. Entering the place it's just as big inside. It's like costco and food city had a wild passionate tequila filled tryst and gave birth to the Eva Longoria of grocery stores.\n Vicente and I immediately split up, probably not the best of ideas, but I wanted to explore and he was eager to do the same. I quickly snatched up the worst shopping cart in the store (you know the one with a bad front wheel and sticky grip) and let my stomach guide me.\n Two gallons of horchata. check. Exotic mozzarella style cheese from Oaxaca and  some delicious salty Cotija. check. A lb. of plantains. check. Mango's, apples, dried pinto beans, sugar snap peas, string beans, potato's, roma tomato's- check! \n Grocery shopping while intoxicated can get a little quixotic, and confusing to say the least. I hadnt the slightest clue what I was going to make, but the colors of the produce were certainly alluring.\n Finally Vicente caught up with me and laughed gutturally upon seeing my hodge podge of a shopping cart. I stared thru him with glazed eyes as I espied the \"cafeteria\". I abandoned my shopping cart and slowly walked over, intriguiged, literally beguiled by the aroma of cooked meats. \n I hadnt the slightest clue what most of it was, and what broken Spanish I know certainly wasnt helping with most of the dishes behind the glass, until bingo; Carnitas.\n There was a word I knew and loved, I stared at the \"meat\" not quite convinced I knew what I was looking at. Sure it said carnitas, but this was...well...it resembled a tamarind bean, but was much longer, and had a color ruddy and blackish, certainly most unappealing. The tube like meat sat coiled amongst itself like tentacles in a brackish water. I stared at it hypnotized, until a young Mexican attendant came to take my order. \n \"Hey man what you want?\" he asked, breaking the glamour that held me entranced.\n \"...a half a pound of this...\" I said unsteadily. He looked at me almost impressed, and half cautiously. As he deflty grasped a pair of tongs and started sloshing the meat back and forth in it's brackish juices, attempting a better grip, it looked more alien to me than ever. I was beginning to come to my senses out of a stupor, and it was slowly dawning on me what this was.\n In a slightly horrified and hoarse whisper I leaned over the counter and looked him in the eyes and asked, \"Wait, wait......what is this...stuff!?\"\n Then he said, grinning a knowing, mocking grin, \"Yoo don' know whad tis is and yoo wanna poun' of eet man?\" \n Just then Vicente strolled up casually behind me and saw what I was doing, the two exchanged a brief chuckle as apparently Vin had overheard the attendant's query.\n \"Trrrriiipa!\" Vicente exclaimed, using his dormant mexican accent that usually only comes out when drunk or speaking with his parents, to which the attendant grinned and nodded enthusiatically.\n Aghast, I stepped back in revulsion, I'd nearly ordered a pound of pigs intestines.I felt profoundly embarassed, never more had I shown off the \"pinche gringo\" side of my personality than in that moment. \n I ended up just ordering some pork ribs that'd been marinated in a chile sauce, along with the ubiquitous spanish rice and refried beans.\n I love ranch market, but I'm certainly not going back until the raspberry of embarassment lightens.", "business_id": "VXIkI9_EbDbYHeO9IzKjJg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-06-27", "type": "review"}

It's huge and has every Mexican delicacy you can think of. Awesome bakery, tortilleria, hot foods, huge cheese section, random pig body parts in the cheese section. \n\nMy tummy was growling so I decided to get a bean burrito before I shopped. The people working there were quite disorganized. There were 2 people ahead of me. I person ordered a cup of green chili and the other person ordered a side of rice. Between 3 employees it took 5 minutes to get our three orders out. After getting my burrito, I turn around and my cart with a couple items in it was gone! I seriously turned my back just for 30 seconds. It was obvious it was mine... hmmmm.\n\nLuckily the burrito was delicious. Do not underestimate the power of a good, simple bean burrito. The tortilla was puffy, the beans creamy, the cheese gooey. Yum.\n\nI go get myself another cart and by the time I get to the produce section I realize the handle of my cart is quite sticky. Yuck. Thank God for hand sanitizer in my purse.\n\nYes, the produce section is huge and has great variety. I saw some childhood favorites there... nopales, jicama, etc. The sale prices on produce were very good. However, the quality of some items were bad. The tomatoes were on sale, but they weren't even ripe. They were pale pink. I didn't even bother. The lemons were mushy and infested with flies. \n\nThe condition of the store in general was run down and dirty. A cooler holding frozen fruit was filthy. The lack of sanitation made me a bit nervous.\n\nAlso making me nervous were the many unsupervised children running amok, pulling things off shelves and just creating chaos. I almost accidentally hit a few with my cart. \n\nStill, I came out of Ranch Market with lots of produce, lots of pork for carnitas, fresh cheeses, fresh tortillas all for under $30.

I mean good lord, I didn't even know they made facial scrub products for dogs and had no clue that they had specialty shampoos for red heads, blondes, and brunettes!!!\n\nBut let's take a tour of my cart:\ntennis ball squeaky bone - check\nchicken jerky  - check\nchicken rice balls - check\nodor eliminator candles - check\nhappy bunny buffs - check (oh yeah these rock)\nwindow kitty bed - check\ncase of greenie things - check\nremote controlled citronella training collar - check\nhorribly embarrassing foo foo collar decoration - check\n\nHere are few things you should know before you go:\n1) There is a $25 minimum purchase (not sure if that is the same on line).\n2) Every single one of their products is on their website or in their catalog and that is where you will find pricing info.\n3) They have tiered pricing, so if you are buying one of an item, you will pay the highest amount. Each item has a \"bulk\" price which kicks in when you buy 3 to 12 of that item (depending on the product).\n4) Prices ROCK, even the highest price is about 20% less than the big box pet stores and as much as 50% less than the boutiques. I went to look for a spray training collar (the non-shock kind) for my youngest dog and it was literally 60% less than the best price I could find anywhere else.\n5) You have to put it together... if you are buying a crate or carrier, they will get it to your car, but  you have to assemble it yourself.\n6) They have two full walls covered with clearance items that you will never see on line or in a catalogue.\n7) This place is only open Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., but phone and web orders can be picked up until 5:00 p.m.\n8) The warehouse is cooled by coolers and was hotter than a son of a bitch when I was there. Industrial fans be damned... nothing is going to make you cooler - but a deal is a deal. Go in the cooler months and stock up, or shop on line.  http://www.ryanspet.com/ryanspet/default.asp?\n\nThe staff is INCREDIBLY nice (especially considering that they must be rattled by the heat during the summer). As you are wandering the aisles, they make sure you know they are there to answer questions, pull box, help you find a specific item, etc.\n\nThey also have a sharpening service in their sister building, where you can get your shears spiffed up for a reasonable price.\n\nSeriously this place is a must go for anyone that feels compelled to spoil their four-footed companions. Let's just say that I was almost crushed when I broke out the bags and I didn't have to have a good cry on the way home for spending too much!", "business_id": "Dj3i6a_vboALYTRKTmBABQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-07-21", "type": "review"}

But don't fill up on chips alone, the best is yet to come. My mom tried the grilled fish in a spicy yet creamy red sauce, the flavor was amazing. And she is a very tough critic to please. My favorite dish is Aguachile De Camar\u00f3n, do yourself a favor and ask for fresh avocado on top. This dish has such a perfect balance of flavor, heat, and acidity. It has that wonderful taste of the ocean without even a hint of fishiness. The addition of avocado is just a bonus and not necessary but it does add a silky almost sweet flair. I've eaten this elsewhere and it's always been lacking flavor in one area or another, but not here! It's so delicious that I find myself craving it the very next day and wanting go back. Paired with a Michelada, and you're set. It takes me back to eating Mariscos in Mexico overlooking the ocean.

I asked if they were as good as Rainbow, but she had never tried Rainbow.\n\nSo - we decided to do a taste test.  Three of us in the house - so we would get 3 different (but like) donuts from each.  The plan was to bring them back home, cut to sample size, and note flavor, texture and overall preference.\n\nThe guy roommate's favorite is glazed raised.  The gal leans to sugar raised and I figured glazed old fashioned is a safe baseline for taste testing.\n\nWe went to Rainbow first.  No problem getting the donuts we wanted.  I also picked up a half dozen donut holes.  Was not thrilled to be charged $0.50 for the box, but c'est la vie.  Girl roommate also got a watermelon frappe type of drink.  A bit sweet for my tastes, but very, very watermelony.\n\nNext stop Bosa.  They didn't have regular sugar raised - used powdered sugar instead.  (I have a hard time trusting that the regular sugar didn't stick - somehow they managed to make it work at Rainbow!)  So the granulated vs. powdered sugar raised would not be as scientific a comparison, but we'd make do.  No problem with the glzed and old fashioned.  We also picked up ham and swiss croissants.  One can never have too much pastry, right? :)\n\nResults - \n     Glazed raised - Bosa was slightly denser and chewier - more mouth satisfaction.  Rainbow was cloudlike fluffy and light.  Great texture, but we didn't feel satisfied from chewing.  Rainbow was slightly sweeter.\n          ~Votes - 3 for Bosa.~\n     Old Fashioned - textures were identical.  Rainbow had a slight lemon (or maybe aspatrame?) flavor in the back end of the tasting.\n          ~Votes - 1 slight lean to Bosa, 2 Draw~\n     Sugar raised - texture of donut was identical to glazed raised above.  (duh - same donut, different topping.)  The gal roomie likes granulated.  The guy roomie preferred the powdered.  I liked both.\n          ~Votes - 1 Bosa, 1 Rainbow, 1 Draw.\n\nSo, Bosa comes out with a slight edge.  And we came out with a slight sugar rush.

I still feel a bit guilty, as I've been with Eliana's for years, but when Guanaquito does it better in almost every way, how can you fault me? \n\nIf you blink, you'll miss it- on McDowell, between the Gourmet House of Hong Kong and Arizona Endoscopy Services. You need to park in back, accessible from a driveway before you pass by the dully colored sign for Guanaquito.\n\nLike Eliana's, it's Salvadoran cuisine, but there are so many more options at Guanaquito. They serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and based on tonight's sampling, Hubby and I will be back often to work our way through the menu. I had the ensalada drink and Hubby had the Horchata, which the waitress patiently explained was different from Mexican Horchata. It sure was- maybe it was the morrow seed that made it so unique. \n\nFor his entree, Hubby had the equivalent of the sampler platter- a tamale (again, quite different from a Mexican tamale- softer and creamier), 2 pastales (meat pies) and 2 pupusas (stuffed, grilled tortillas). Guanaquito had a far greater variety of pupusas than Elaina's, and they were every bit as good. The one that I had that was most unique was made with cheese and loroco plant (which to me had an asparagus-y taste). Definitely delicious. At both Salvadoran places, we were served a bowl of cabbage salad, but at Eliana's we had never been told how to eat it. Guanaquito's was far less astringent and we were instructed to eat it with our pupusas. I was skeptical at first, but became quickly hooked. It did not overwhelm the taste of the pupusas, and added a nice crunch and zing. \n\nThe only thing I found that Eliana's did better than Guanaquito was the flan. Guanaquito's texture was off, but the flavor was acceptable.\n\nI suppose I'm willing to share my new love with all of you- but be forewarned- she's a saucy mistress you'll be compelled to visit again and again.

The papusa has been a fascination of mine ever since I first sampled it.  There was just something about the texture of the dough and the variety of different stuffings in the middle.  Not at all like a quesadilla.  Salvadorans basically do this magic trick where the filling almost tastes like it's been part of the dough all along.  I've craved that texture since but in Phoenix papusas aren't easy to find.  But living Downtown has once again enabled me to satisfy another ethnic food hankering as Guanaquito has apparently been hiding in plain sight all along.  On a Friday at lunch, I made my move.\n\nGuanaquito is a place that might intimidate a gringo coming here for the first time.  The building is old and (at least on the exterior) uninviting looking.  First know that both the parking and entrance are in the back.  When I entered the place was pretty busy, and low and behold I was the only English speaking gringo in the place.  Don't worry though, the staff is super friendly and speaks perfectly good English.  The restaurant interior itself is fairly divvy, but the aroma and happy vibes were more than enough to sooth any doubt in my mind.  Other than Papusas, I knew basically jack squat about Salvadoran food going into my visit here.  I did some light research on Salvadoran Food on Wikipedia and settled on what I thought would be the most authentic experience.\n\nFor starters I went with a large Tamarindo.  Basically a citrus punch using a tropical fruit called tamarind.  Not nearly as tangy as a fruit punch, but still very refreshing.  They brought out a small chips and salsa bowl along with it.  For the main event, I went with what seems to be Salvadoran cuisine 101 at this place.  The Plato Tipico.  Oddly the items in this dish are not described on the menu (and I forgot to ask the waitress), but I pretty much figured it out.  Of course there's the papusas which come with your choice of fillings (I went with cheese and pork for both), two small beef & potato empanadas, a tamale wrapped in banana leaf with what (I think) was pork and cheese filling, and what I believe were fried fingerling plantains.  The dish also came with a vinegar coleslaw which you can add to pretty much anything on your plate.  First off, the papusas.  As good as I remember.  Hot, soft, and despite being thin were packed full of that cheese and pork I was hoping for.  The dough was cooked perfectly and was perfect with or without the coleslaw.   The beef empanadas were also delicious (and piping hot).  Plenty of meat along with some potato and a hint of veggie in each.  The crust of the empanadas was firm but flaky and not greasy at all.  The tamale was fantastic in large part because of the texture of the masa.  Maybe it was the way it was cooked in the banana leaf, but that was some of the best masa I've ever had on a tamale.  The super tender meat and cheese filling inside the tamale was equally up to the task.  The fingerlings had a tasty subtle sweetness note that rounded out the dish quite nicely.  \n\nFeeling bullish about dessert, I ordered a quesadilla.  Now this is not a quesadilla like a Mexican quesadilla would be.  This is basically a Salvadoran version of a cheesecake (or at least that's how it's described).  Two mistakes I made on this.  First off, when I ordered it, I didn't get just a slice or a sample of the quesadilla.  I literally got the entire quesadilla.  Great value for the price, but that was a bit of a shocker.  Second mistake was that I didn't realize the quesadilla was effectively a dry cake.  Picture a cheesecake in cornbread form and that's basically what it was.  It wasn't bad, but the portion was way too large to be consumed by one.  Plus I was expecting something more closely resembling an American cheesecake.  Rookie mistake on my part, and to be clear I didn't ask the waitress for a description.  I just made a guess based on limited information and I guessed wrong.  Plain and simple.\n\nTotal price for the Tamarindo, Plato Tipico, Quesadilla, tax and tip came to about $25.  Tremendous value for the amount of food (and the quality) you get.  As mentioned earlier, the service was friendly and I felt perfectly at home here despite my (obvious) lack of familiarity with the cuisine.  Next time I'm here I'll dive deeper into the menu for their seafood and other desserts.  All in all, really good first impression.

Of course they have all of the important imported beer, but the best part about this is that they are cheap!!! Almost half the prices of most places, which will definitely keep me coming back.  I have always said you can determine how good the Mexican food is by the salsa and the rice.  The salsa was just the way I like it, tasty while eating it and spicy when you're done.

They even give you an extra bowl to mix both the red and the green together.  \n\nNow onto my meal, chile verde burrito with a side of rice.  I love to try this dish at different places since most green salsas all taste different depending on who makes it, so different places meet my craving needs.  My burrito was ok, but I wouldn't rank it up there with the best.  It needed more flavor and definitely more spice.  Adding the salsa for the chips made it a little more enjoyable.  The rice to me was disappointing.  Mexican rice should be juicy and fluffy, but instead it was fried and had no flavor.  I'm not too much of a shrimp person, but my brother got shrimp colorado, which was surprisingly (to me the non-shrimp eater) good.

We also took some Horchata and a Mansanita glass bottle to go mmmm. This place was clean and reminded me of Mexico inside, if I am in the area I would not hesitate to stop in here for a bite.\n\nShout out to Danny S for recommending!

We live mere blocks from here, so we felt it was about time we tried it. \n\nThe chips and tostada base tasted off, as if the oil they were fried in was a little rancid. The cheese on the cheese crisp was plentiful- and pretty oily. My husband called the cheese in his chile relleno the most tasteless he had ever had, as was the relleno batter. \n\nI ordered a #1, but wanted to substitute a hard taco for the cheese enchilada. I checked the a la carte prices, and knew that the taco was actually less expensive, so I was sure I wasn't going to be screwing them over. I can't tell you how long it took me to try and explain what I wanted to our server. I'm sure there are those who would say it's my fault for not speaking Spanish. Anyway, I ended up getting my tostada and the hard taco, but no taquito, and no rice and beans. Then another 10 minutes of my life went by as I tried to explain again what I had ordered when the server asked if everything was alright, but that really, no one needed to bring me out any more food. I had had enough by that point and knew it would already be a Pepcid AC kind of night. The cook and the server argued and finally the server understood that she had gotten my order wrong. They comped my food, which wasn't necessary, but they insisted. My taco and tostada were just alright. The beans in the tostada were cold, which I am not used to.\n\nWe've had everything better somewhere else, and feel no need to return.", "business_id": "cgNIBHS2mLdbTRiodAT6EQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-06-11", "type": "review"}

The beans were re-fried to perfection, and not overly covered with cheese. The taco and flauta were perfectly crisp.

The green was definitely spicy but had absolutely no flavor to it whatsoever, I think I could have accomplished the same thing by mixing cayenne with a corn starch slurry.

I had been craving a grilled fish taco, and was stoked they had them on the menu. The halibut was tasty and delicate, topped with an almost too mild chipotle slaw, nestled in grilled flour tortillas. I felt it needed a little something, so I added a squeeze of lime, and a touch of salt.\n\nFor dessert, I had the creme brulee. The texture was the perfect combination of creamy and firm, and it was swimming with the tiny grains of vanilla bean.\n\nDinner was also reasonably priced.

I briefly considered the chili dog but that too was made with turkey ... what kind of throw back retro diner was this?? Damn. I got the cheeseburger and potato chips, which came out pretty quick and the burger was hot as all get out, fresh off the skillet ... definitely not a grill and that was just about the worst patty I've paid for in my life.

Worth the visit, no.\n\nProblem 1: Hosting a political event without warning during the Saturday lunch hour.  No signs on the outside, no warning until we're in and heading for the table, and we realize, \"There's a guy, stumping for Mayor of Phoenix, and he's going to just talk the entire lunch hour.\"  So this means we can either enjoy conversation with our friends or we can sit and eat quietly while an unelected politician tells us why we shouldn't trust elected politicians.\n\nProblem 2: Very dry chicken.  Seriously, I think they stuck a frozen Wal-Mart chicken breast in the microwave and nuked it for 8 minutes or something.  How hard is it to make a chicken sandwich taste good?  So now I get to try to choke down dry chicken and terrible political speeches at the same time.\n\nProblem 3:  The candidate finally quits talking.  Then he takes a photo standing between the waitresses and says, \"It's like beauty on the outside, and beast on the inside.\"  No one laughs.  But then the owner comes up to our table as we're finally getting the chance to talk to each other, and she spends another 15 minutes telling us why we should vote for a certain party and why she wants to move into Phoenix from her home in Fountain Hills.  My favorite line: \"We need to make it harder for folks to drive so that they start using public transportation.\"  But of course, she's not using the light rail on her way in from Fountain Hills.  She just wants the people off her streets when she's trying to drive in and out of the city.\n\nThe only good thing about the whole trip--apart from our friends, who are awesome--was that the waitresses were professional and competent.

My husband and I are both into oldies music, so naturally we had to check it out! Initially the place caused confusion, as there were several entrances in a row, but we figured out we had to enter through an antique store. We loved all of the old stuff on display in the diner. The waitress was friendly and dressed for the era, albeit not in a poodle skirt. We asked for time to peruse the menu, as there were a mind-boggling amount of shake flavors to choose from. I opted to mix two flavors for my shake: passionfruit and black cherry, which turned out to be a scrumptious blend. My husband got coffee, but it tasted so weak that he swapped it out for blackberry. We were told it was weak because it had just been made with coffee ice cream rather than using their coffee syrup. Why? We don't know. The music wasn't 100% consistent with the theme. Part of the time it was oldies, and the other part was 80s. For our lunch, we both ordered the same thing-pastrami on rye with potato salad. The reviewers are spot-on about the potato salad, it's quite good. The sandwich was pretty good as well. After eating, we browsed the antique shop on the other side.

Really good. Beerbutter? Also really good. Mixed together? MAGIC. Stick two straws in your mouth and have at it!\nThe Lucky Leprechaun was also wonderful - but admittedly, I was never a fan of mint ice creams... despite that, I still drank this lovely float and enjoyed it wonderfully~\nI can't say for sure how it tasted when mixed with BOTH the King Kong and Beer Butter, mostly because by then my stomach, tongue, and throat had been sweetened to the point of no return.\nI also ordered a Yin & Yang on the side as my main meal (Did I mention that I *love* ice cream?), which was absolutely delicious.\nAnd my partner ordered a sloppy joe, which was surprisingly sweet! That was also delicious.\n\nI will say, as someone who's eaten tons of ice cream from various restaurants, bars, stores, and hole-in-the-walls: Their ice cream quality isn't perfectly amazing. Their toppings and syrups aren't top-notch.\nAs I'm not a soda-expert, I can't account for the quality of the sodas.\nWhat makes this place earn five stars, however, is the overall, combined experience.\n\nThe flavor choices, with their fun names and creative combinations... The customizations you can add that seem infinite... The warm, homey environment... The interesting bits and bobs to stare at... And the smiling service...?

It's every bit as good and may be more convenient for you.  It's at 51st Ave. and Orangewood - Rito's Burritos in the little strip mall.  Naturally I tested the green chile burro enchilada style and it was exactly the same, right down to the oversized pie plate.  Ahhh...\n\nDon't worry, for those that are concerned Rito's is going corporate, the new place still has those stylish iron bars between you and the kitchen, and although it has bathrooms, they are perpetually \"under repair,\" according to the glossy, pre-printed sign they've mounted on the wall.  And of course it's still cash-only.  So they have preserved that special charm. \n\nI know this will make the line longer at the new place, but it would be unfair not to share the good news, especially when I learned about the original from here.

The sauce is divine and words cannot describe it properly.  \n\nThe perfect accompaniments to these dishes were Mexican Coca-Colas (Yay!), creamy beans topped with cheese, and white rice with vegetables.

This place did not disappoint. \nThe decor inside MPH is colorful and welcoming. Nothing to special, but nice. We were sat immediately and our drink orders taken. The reviews of the chips and salsa have not been exaggerated. The chips are thicker, almost softer and deliciously warm and salty. The red salsa has a nice rich, spicy flavor, but the green salsa, oh, the green salsa. The green salsa is avocado and cilantro based. It has a wonderful fresh, almost tangy flavor that is complimented well by the creaminess the avocado brings to the dish. When our drinks arrived my husband was delighted by the icy mexican coca-cola, as was I. Our waiter also brought out a fish ceviche tostada. Though it was a surprising treat the ceviche was not a flavorful as we had hoped. \n\nWhile we enjoyed the chips and salsa we could hear and smell our entree being freshly prepared. With out waiter suggestion we ordered the Molcajete. Which is essentially a sampler of grilled sea bass, shrimp, chicken, beef and octopus all swimming and sizzling in a tasty tomatillo based sauce. All the meats were fresh, tender and very flavorful. The rich green sauce was delightful. The bubbling cauldron of flavor was accompanied by flour tortillas that were tasty, but most importantly had a great texture for sopping up all the sauce, yum. Also included were some decent creamy pinto beans and fluffly white rice with what seemed to be veg-all mixed in. Mu husband loved the rice, I was less impressed and opted to fill up on everything else. \nI can not leave this review with out mentioning the amazing guacamole. Freshly made, and the perfect amount of chunkiness. Some of the best gauc I have had recently. \n\nOur bill was an even 40 after tax and tip and we left with some delicious left overs. \n\nOverall this place is great, delicious, fresh, and affordable with very friendly service.", "business_id": "Cp6JGY5YIRncTV_My9nf9g", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-06-21", "type": "review"}

Prices are reasonable I'd say the average plate price runs about $13.00. Most of the menu is seafood so plan on having seafood if you come here. \n\nI've been here several times over the years and I'd say most of the time but not always they start you off with a complimentary mini fish tostada that delicious with your chips and salsas.\n\nI can vouch for the Fish Veracruzana and the Fish Poblano plates because I had them before and the fish was light ,fresh tasting and flaky. The sauce and toppings  is really what made these dishes good to me. They come with your usual rice and beans and tortillas. They have many choices in this kind of dish.\n\nLast time I was here the place was packed and we were the only table in the place that didn't order the Molcajete so I wanted to order it this time.\n\nThe Molcajete is a boiling hot caldron filled with your choice of Diablo Hot Chipotle sauce or Tomatillo Sauce. The menu that we had reads Fish, Shrimp, and Beef. But what we received was Battered Fish, Shrimp, Beef, Chicken and Octopus. The Diablo sauce is very hot and spicy but also very tasty and I found myself adding it everything I ate. Over all I thought it was good and fun to share. It cost $22.00 and feeds at least two people. It also comes with rice , beans and tortillas. If you get the Molcajete you should eat the shrimp first because they get over cooked just sitting on the hot Molcajete as ours did.

HAVE YOU?!\n\nThis is THE place to have that experience. I say \"experience\" because molcajete is more like a witch's bubbling brew than a meal. Mariscos is a cozy little restaurant in an area a lot of people won't flock to, but it stays busy. All the good stuff applies here... friendly service, great food, Mexican beers, Mariachis (on Fridays, I believe). It's just a great place. And, now that the formalities are out of the way, I can talk about the molcajete. \n\nMolcajete is actually the name of the stone bowl that is used more traditionally as a mortar for salsas and such. As a dish though, it's a beautiful mixture of spicy/tangy sauce, grilled meats, grilled veggies, and cheese. It's one of my favorite Mexican dishes, period. Mariscos serves theirs with tons of fixins (beans, tortillas, salsas, etc.) that could probably fill two people up on their own, but their generous serving is much appreciated when ordering this dish for a small group. It's definitely one of those meals that'll impress people when it gets served. Order one for the table, and you're going to have a good time.\n\nI could spout on all day about molcajete... But, would ya look at that, I have a decent size review already, and I haven't even talked about the restaurant's specialty, seafood. Well, I'll let you read some other reviews for that.

This is no easy badge to earn, because, unlike most other cities, there aren't good neighborhood separated from bad ones:  Phoenix is one of the few cities I've ever been to, where you can have a million dollar home and two doors down from it is a crack house.  Bizarre, but true.  Having said that, I personally would not want to come here when the sun is down, but when we arrived at 6pm, it was quiet and I didn't feel uneasy about the surroundings.\n\nPARKING LOT:  The entrance to the restaurant is off of Garfield and not 16th Street, which you'll be taking to get here.  This is important, because you'd think it would have an entrance to the parking lot from the main road; it doesn't.  The parking lot, like the restaurant, is small and they share it with a barber shop, which threatens to tow if you park in their spots.  Obviously, this is no problem after they close; but during business hours, I imagine it can be hard to find spots which \"belong\" to the restaurant.\n\nTHE RESTAURANT:  And, like the parking lot, the restaurant is small inside.  There aren't a lot of tables, so it wouldn't take much to fill up the place.  The decor is typical \"Mexican\":  lots of colors, nature motifs, sombreros, etc.  It may be jarring for some conservative Anglo types, but they more than likely wouldn't come here anyway.  The pinks, blues, greens, yellows and other colors so typical of the Mexican Pacific seem to blend nicely and don't seem garrish at all.  Now, as I said, the place is small.  So, for example, someone sitting at the table behind me actually had to pass next to my table to get to their seat.  Not a big deal and she politely excused herself twice.  This might be unacceptable in a 3 or 4 star restaurant or even something simply \"formal\".  But the atmosphere in this place is far from formal.  It's friendly, loud, noisy and familiar.  If you don't like people and if you're uptight about someone walking past you while you're eating, you won't like this place.  If you're there to enjoy the food, have a good time with friends, or don't mind a lively atmosphere, you'll do fine here.  That being said, I believe, I read somewhere that they have live Mariachi music on Fridays.  I'm not a fan of the genre, but even if I were, as small as that place is, I have a strong feeling it would be very LOUD while the music was being performed.  There are two TVs in the place, which, typical for this kind of venue, were playing soccer.  They were not loud and did not intrude on personal conversations.  The place also seems to have a full bar and a number of beer specials.\n\nTHE FOOD:  Being older and having to bring in my reading glasses, one of the things I very much appreciated about the menu was each item being listed in Spanish and English, with Spanish written in blue and English in yellow ink.  This made it much easier to separate the two and quickly see what was what.  I ordered a fish combo which was supposed to come with octopus and shrimp and with a creamy mushroom sauce.  It was not a \"combo\" in the sense that most Americans would be used to.  I expected there to be some fish filet, some shrimp and some octopus.  What came was a fish filet covered in mushroom sauce with some shrimp and very tiny pieces of octopus mixed in.  My companion had a less expensive fish filet with garlic sauce.  Outside of the different price and the cream sauce, they looked exactly the same.  Nevertheless, while this might sound negative, I was not at all disappointed with my plate.  My companion thought his fish greasy; I think it was the garlic sauce.  My fish was not at all greasy and tasted wonderful.  The food was served hot, but not so hot as to burn you.  The rice served with the fish was plain and nothing exciting; and yet, it complimented the fish perfectly.  The portions look huge and they are; but I didn't feel stuffed when I was done; just contented.  It was just the right amount of food.  I had oysters as an appetizer.  If you like oysters, they were good with the lime juice I squeezed on them.  If you don't, well, then it doesn't matter, does it?  The ceviche was okay; a lot of reviewers made a big deal about them in their reviews.  There was nothing bad about them; just nothing special.  Overall, we were both VERY happy with the food, the portion size, the temperature they were served at, and the taste ... and my partner usually complains about everything!  So this is a BIG endorsement!\n\nTHE SERVICE:  *sigh* ... Not everything can be perfect and this was the pebble amidst the pearls in the evening.  The service staff is friendly.  But the place is too small, has too many people  (on a Thursday night, no less ... can you imagine it on a Friday?!?); and not enough servers to be as attentive as they have to be.  Food and drinks were served promptly.  But when it came time to pay, I had to track them down.", "business_id": "Cp6JGY5YIRncTV_My9nf9g", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-06-27", "type": "review"}

If anything there was mostly bell pepper as filler, I didn't dam order fajita style so what's with so much bell pepper and onion???  Rice and beans were good, but just a doppling of both, really??!!  I also ordered the shrimp ceviche as an appetizer, again it was just meh.  Nothing really stood out, other than the limey juice and again, it was more of pico de gallo all mixed in that was another filler.  Maybe it was just an off day, but nothing special.

My daughter ordered a shrimp cocktail, hoping it would taste similar to those in Rocky Point, she told me that it was nothing special.  My niece ordered chicken enchiladas and nothing seafood, but said they were the best enchiladas she's had.

The pathways are winding and wonderful, but not so rugged that a person in a wheelchair could not navigate the terrain. Some of the inclines lead you to remarkable views of the cityscape and the surrounding mountains.

This was back in the 90's - it was amazingly beautiful; walkways lined with several luminaries, acoustic holiday music, lights everywhere - extremely festive and all the perfect touches to put you in the holiday mood. My only complaint was how crowded the event got...but, they keep all moving along...and it wasn't anywhere near as bad as Zoo Lights.\n\nSince moving to the Valley permanently, we purchased a seasonal pass for the family.

Bring 'em to the butterfly exhibit in the spring or on a flashlight tour over the summer. We've been to the flashlight tours three times already and are always in awe at how friendly and knowledgeable the garden volunteers are. And what a well-organized affair! They set up about 10 informative stations. Some have desert critters, others educate about desert plants and the night sky, another with a craft and activities for the kids. If you can, bring a hand-held blacklight and you may find an extra treat along the paths (great for spotting scorpions). I don't think I've ever met one volunteer that wasn't in a good mood...but, it's hard to be aggravated or stressed when walking around such a beautiful place. It has it all; something for every season....OH, and what GORGEOUS blooms in the spring! Do not forget your camera...and don't miss Gertrude's or the gift shop (if you buy a membership, you get 10% off at the shop!)!\n\nHands down: our family's favorite place to unwind in the city!

I cannot be sure, but my review is mostly based on the manager on the clock at about 12:15pm, right during the lunch rush.  I can understand being new at a job, we have all been there, but why make the newest person on the team (and if he isn't the newest he is just the slowest) run the bread/start station?  There were clearly faster workers further down the line who would regularly go out to the dining room and clean up.  Also, the entire time we were there (more than 30 minutes) she, the manager, was sitting at a table by herself, earbuds plugged into her phone and text book open.  This was the lunch rush!  Not only wasn't she helping, but she was taking up one of a few available tables.  When she was needed she would shake her head unapprovingly and walk over to help.  At any given time there were anywhere from 3-6 people waiting in line to give their order, terrible managerial skills in my opinion.  She was focused on herself and would only take time to help when absolutely needed, or she would take a break to bark orders to the employees who were working their tails off.  We went to this location because it was slighly closer to where we work, but will not again return.  In addition, it would seem their toaster is on too high, both our subs came out hard and crispy.

The courtyard and all of their facilities here are first class. The room that I got was a nice suite. It had two rooms, a sitting/dinning area/work area and the bedroom. The rooms were very spacious, clean, and modern, and each room had it's own hi-def TVs with all the channels plus HBO. \n\nThe bathroom is also nice with the sink, toilet, and shower all in the same room. The bed are nice and soft and clean. I did get a comfortable night sleep here. They also have a very nice court yard with orange trees, a nice pool area, and work out room. \n\nThey also have on site dinning and bar area called the Belvedere. Me an my coworker had both drinks, dinner, and breakfast there. It's american style grill and prices are reasonable for a hotel (you're looking at around $10 for sandwiches & pizza and $18 - $25 for entrees). \n\nThe food here was good and the free breakfast that came with it was also very good. It was one of the better complimentary breakfast I've been to. Not only did they have fresh cooked pastries, but they also had eggs, bacon, hashbrowns, and fresh squeezed juice. \n\nAs to rating, while the hotel is nice, it's expense. How expensive, try $179 on a Week Night when I was here (granted it was during spring training). Also you get all these things BUT free internet. This is the one thing I hate about these high end hotels, they penny pinch the hell out of you. \n\nWould I come back, yes I would.

A quick Yelp search turned up Eliana's and since it was on my way home from the airport, I decided to stop in to get my fix. Initially, I only planned on getting the combo platter and ensalada drink. Then I started thinking back on my fond memories of pupaserias (sp?) in the Mission district of SF so I flagged down the waiter to have that added on to my order. \n\nMy ensalada drink arrived w/ a little cup of chicken & potato soup which instantly made my stomach do a little churn. I'm not sure if it was because the ensalada drink looked like a liquid highlighter or the fact that an ice cold beverage was served with a hot soup, but being the starving beast that I was, I took a sip of the glow-stick and devoured the tasty chicken soup. I couldn't really figure out if the drink tasted like anything other than sweet water w/ a few pieces of fruits & carrot, but it was interesting to order nonetheless.  \n\nNot sure what to say about the pupusa and combo platter other than, it was very MOIST. I'm sure you're thinking, \"WTH how could she describe a pupusa, empanada, pasteles and tamale as moist?,\" but trust me, it was a lot odder for me to taste these unexpectedly moist items. I'm not sure it was moist from the meat juices or grease but I ate a few bites of each item and left the rest. Feeling rather unfulfilled from everything, I decided to order the quesadilla dessert. As the other reviewers have already mentioned, it's not the quesadilla that most of us are accustomed to. I'd describe it as corn bread (minus the gritty corn texture) with a cream cheese flavor. Kinda strange.. not my thang. \n\nSo 3 stars to Eliana's for the MOIST items. I'd give it an extra .5 star for the soup, but unfortunately that's not an option and I didn't think it'd merit a whole extra star on its own.", "business_id": "q2SZa5g85758iW1L9sSL1g", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-07-19", "type": "review"}

Our food was served all at once and was accompanied by tortillas and refried beans. These are NOT your mother's refried beans. They have an unbelievably smooth texture and are full of amazing flavor. We dipped our tortilla's [which in this case are 1/2 inch thick masa harina-esque mixed with shortening - am guessing] in the beans and just revelled in the great mix of flavor and texture. Between that and our other fave, the papusa's, we could have died happy at that moment. The papusa's are everything everyone says they are: warm, delicious, with meat, potato and cheese. Must be El Salvadoran for 'comfort food'. Its simple, flavorful and delightful. Although I was less of a fan of the shrimp/chicken/rice entree, it was still very fine. \n\nThe servers were extremely kind and friendly and when we asked about the refried bean prep, we were basically given the 411 on how they prep the beans, what they cook them with and how they get the texture [blender].

It's close to my work, and it sounded like such a nice departure from my usual lunchtime rounds. This past weekend, my boyfriend and I went to dinner there, because I thought it deserved a second try. I'll tell you a little about both experiences. \n\nAfter perusing all of the (mostly) helpful and honest reviews here, I really psyched myself out about giving it a try and just HAD to go there for takeout that VERY SAME DAY - I'm not a delayed gratification kind of person, despite my best efforts. I ended up at the restaurant at around 11:00, and it was empty. The lady behind the counter seemed a little frosty at first, but then she started in with calling me \"mija,\" and I was a goner. I'm not sure why, but some little, older lady calling me a term of motherly endearment always softens me right up. \n\nI ordered the Pollo Encebollado, described in the menu only as \"chicken with onions.\" Hm. Well, I like chicken, and I like onions...so...that sounded pretty good! I was imagining something akin to an El Salvadorian fajita. As I picked up my order and drove back to work to enjoy it at my desk, visions of chunks of seasoned chicken and sauteed onions danced through my head. I settled down at my desk, took a deep breath, opened the nicely wrapped Styrofoam container, and...chicken on the bone? What? Who said anything about chicken on the bone? With some reddish, tomatoey-looking sauce? What is this? Where are the delicious, unauthentic strips of white meat chicken? The browned onions, all oily and slippery? THIS ISN'T FAJITAS! \n\nWell, no. It isn't fajitas...fajitas are somewhere else on the menu. This is Pollo Encebollado, and I didn't know what I was ordering. Pollo Encebollado, at Eliana's, is two drumsticks covered in a flavorful, tomato-based sauce, paired with a few cooked onion slices. The meal includes rice, beans, and tortillas, but I went for double rice, which is kind of yellow in color and studded with chopped carrots and onions. The tortillas are like fat little pancakes that taste like tortillas, if that's not a completely ignorant description. \n\nI don't generally eat chicken on the bone, but, hey. I ordered it, I was really wanting to try it, so I broke a personal rule and dove in. While it wasn't quite what I had imagined, I liked it well enough and was able to finish it. \n\nI wasn't sure what to think. I wasn't too into it...definitely not enough to order that same thing again, but I didn't want to write Eliana's off completely, based merely on some weird, prissy, arbitrary issue I have with chicken on the bone. \n\nI told my boyfriend about the restaurant, and suggested that we go try it out together. He had actually heard of it before from a Salvadorian coworker who raves about it frequently.\n\nWe went on a Friday evening at around 5:00...the restaurant was, again, nearly empty. A very friendly man seated us and took our drink orders.\n\n I first tried the Orchata, which was very different from the Mexican variety I'm sure most of us are familiar with. It was actually a milky brown in color, rather than white...it looked, to me, like a glass of chocolate milk. The color, I found out later, comes from the addition of an ingredient called Morrow Seed. It also tastes a little different, in a way that is hard to explain...I'd also probably chalk that up to the Morrow Seed. \n\nFor our entrees, my boyfriend had the Chile Relleno, and I ordered the Arroz a la Valenciana...mostly because it is painted on the outside of the restaurant, and seems to be their \"hallmark\" dish. \n\nNote: before your order arrives, you receive a salty little cup of chicken soup. I wasn't too into the soup itself, but I was oddly touched by the effort to add a little something extra and a little something nice to the dining experience. Maybe I'm a sappy weirdo. Well, not maybe, I definitely am, but between the \"mija\"s and the cute little soups, I felt very charmed by the man and woman working there, and really, really wanted to enjoy my food so I could write a big, long review on Yelp about how wonderful their restaurant is. \n\nNeither my boyfriend or I really enjoyed either of our dishes. My dish was served cold, which I wasn't expecting, and seemed very flavorless to me...other than the unusual taste of bananas I seemed to pick up from the rice. The man helping us suggested that I pour the bean substance on my dish to \"create a new flavor.\" I thought this was also a really cute thing to say, but, unfortunately, I followed his advice and did not enjoy the \"new flavor\" I created. All in all, I enjoyed the Arroz a la Valenciana much less than the Pollo Encebollado.\n\nAnnnnd I'm out of characters.

We went there pretty early, around 4:15pm on a Thursday.  No one was there except us, I hope it's because of the time. My friend commented it must be a front for some South American drug cartel.  Har har.   I ordered the Ensalada (fresh fruit drink) while FFF ordered the Tamarindo ( tamarind citrus drink).  The ensalada is a very sweet drink with thin slices of pear and another fruit I can't seem to tell from the taste.  FFF thought her Tamarindo was sweet at first, then agreed with me it sucked.  It was too sour for my taste buds. \n\n After 2 or 3 minutes, our appetizers came.  My Pupusa ( tortilla stuffed with cheese, pork, refried beans and green bell peppers) came flaming hot.  It was very crispy and tasty, but hardly any traces of pork..  FFF's first reaction to the tamal ( Salvadorian style chicken tamales with vegetables) was a fake cheerful smile.  After 2 more bites, her real opinion surfaced.  Two thumbs down.  I tried it and thought it was ok.  I wouldn't order it, but would eat it if someone offer them to me for free.   Mama Carmen's tamales are still the best.  \nAfter the appetizers, our waitress brought us some soup and what looks like a cole slaw or salad.  It was hard to tell.  We both agreed the cole slaw wasn't good.  I'm not a fan of cole slaw so i can't  really compare it to others.  Our soup was served in a cup the size of a shot glass, the short shot glass.  It was similar to chicken noodle soup.  It was their best dish out of the whole meal.  This shouldn't have been their best dish.  \n\nThe main course finally came and the first thing FFF said was 'the rice is uncle bens'.  I gave her a weird smirk.  Her fish was really small.  They brought out the Filete de Pescado a la Plancha ( fish fillet on the grill)  for her, but she really ordered the Mojarra Frita con Chimo ( fried fish and refried beans).  She was really excited to eat the fish eyes.  The fish was really disappointed,  It was dry and there wasn't any sauce.   I could have cooked better fish.  My Fajitas de Camaron con Pollo o con carne ( fajitas of shrimp and chicken with refried beans. My chicken was dry and the shrimp didn't have any flavor to them.  Applebee's fajitas was definitely better and that's not saying much.  The total bill came out to $32.39 which isn't bad.  We were disappointed with the food.  There wasn't much flavor to the food. The only nice compliment my friend had about the meal was it was a healthy.  Screw that!  If I wanted healthy, I'll go to subway or cypress pita grill.

Since my parents instantly bond with anyone from Central, South America or that speaks Spanish, our service was very good. Although, the owner is very nice and would be cordial to anyone I am sure. My dad used to be a chef in his country but he doesn't cook anymore. When he does it is to die for, but you know men I guess, do something once and you love them for it only for them to never do it again. So it was with that retrospect that he ordered for the both of us. \n\nThe cuisines are somewhat similar to what we are used to and it is the use of yuca (aka cassava, manioc root) that stands out the most to me. (Yucca is an ornamental plant that does not have the root of the yuca and is commonly confused with Yuca.) On the menu for appetizers is Yuca frita o sancochada-which is basically the root fried or boiled. There is also the delicious papusas (thick, hand-made tortilla made from masa de ma\u00edz that is stuffed with cheese, pork, beans, and green bell peppers or you can get it vegetarian style without pork) that she brought to the table with the traditional curtido- pickled cabbage relish that you eat the papusas with. Then there is the tomato salsa that you can top that off with.\n\nAltogether you could probably make a meal out of these papusas which are a pretty good post bar food if you ask me, but then you would be cheating yourself out of more food! Their fried plantains (starchy fruit) come with sour cream and beans but I like them the way I grew up with; eating them with just sugar sprinkled on both sides. \n\nSome other meals for you meat eaters include: \n\nFilete de Pescado a la Plancha (fish fillet on the grill) that comes with rice, salad and tortillas. Chicken breast on the grill, fajitas, chile relleno and of course quesadillas for dessert. Salvadorian quesadillas are not the same as Mexican quesadillas, it is a cheese pound cake. They also have plantanos fritos con crema y frijoles o con sorbet (fried plantain, beans and whipped cream or with ice cream), flan, or a banana burrito with ice cream.  \n\nTheir fresh fruit drinks were really tasty as was the Tamarindo. Altogether a small menu but I felt like I was at home, so I will return and bring my gringo boyfriend with me.", "business_id": "q2SZa5g85758iW1L9sSL1g", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-06-12", "type": "review"}

They said they had one in stock that they could put on, so I agreed to this and was on may way after about an hour and a half. That was good. What wasn't so good was that they failed to let me know that the tire they put on is not a run-flat tire. That's not a good thing for my car - an '06 BMW 330i. This car requires run-flat tires as it has neither a spare tire nor a place to put one. (BMW has received many earfuls of complaints on this, BTW.) I didn't quiz them on this, so some of it is my own fault, but I do expect a place that sells tires to understand which tires do and do not go with specific car models. The upshot of this is that had that tire picked up a nail somewhere in the desert between Barstow and Needles, I'd have been forced to have someone tow me in, at great expense. I can't begin to emphaize how much that would have pissed me off, so I guess we're all fortunate that didn't happen.

No window to hand them your cash, and - most distressing of all - no window where they can hand me my humongous frosty beverage.  Well, okay, I did eventually receive my beverage as one of their servers walked out the front door and handed it to me where I tentatively pulled up to the edge of the curb.  Now, I know what you're thinking - Sonic is basically a drive up restaurant where they park and bring your food TO YOU, so why would I insist on driving through?  None of your beeswax, buster, I just do.  \n\nIn addition to driving up and parking to order, there are plenty of outdoor tables, most with shade, where you can also sit, order, and enjoy your food or beverages.\n\nSo, do whatever your little heart desires: park and sit in your car, park and sit at the tables, or order at the drive through and act really confused when you can't find the drive through window.  Just make sure you try the cherry limeade - trust me on this one.", "business_id": "po5FyERB4lUZNnBIwnhFlg", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-08-02", "type": "review"}

If you have some time please read this as I would be as detailed as I can because this has reached a tipping point. \nFirst Incident:\nThe first incident occurred the first week I moved in here while I was still offloading my property from my car to move into my new apartment. A security guy approached me and asked if I lived here and to identify myself/apartment number. I identified my self/residence and proceeded to ask if there were any issues. He said there was no issues except some kids were throwing rocks at cars and he just wanted to verify that the correct people live here. Ok I am a black man in mid 30's and don't fit the profile of kids throwing rocks at cars. Also he saw me moving my furniture from my car so If I don't live here I am not sure I will be moving my properties in a random apartment.\n\nSecond Incident:\nI had a guest visiting from out of town and I took my guest to the swimming pool of the apartment complex. Before you enter or exit the swimming pool area you will need a key to open the gate. After spending some time at the pool we decided to leave. On our way out a security guy walked ahead of us and was about to open the gate but decided to put his keys back in his pocket. He asked if we had the keys and I said yes. I brought out my key and opened the gate; he then asked if I lived here which again I identified myself and residence. I asked him if there was any issues, he said there was no issues except he was only trying to get acquainted with the neighbors.  Ok I have the key to the pool as a resident and I am sure he meant getting acquainted only with the minority neighbors.\n\nThird Incident:\nA friend (a black man) was dropping me off in his car last night and we were having a conversation quietly in the car when the apartment security guy started to flash the flash light on us rudely from a distance. He approached us and asked if we lived here. I told him that I am a resident and he asked for some identification. I refused to identify myself this time because I have been asked several times in the past and I asked if there were any issues. He said that he wants to make sure there are no suspicious activities going on. He asked if we had any weapons or drugs and that he wants to make sure that the vehicle was not stolen. We told him that we had no drugs, weapons and it was not a stolen vehicle. I showed him my gate clicker and asked if he knew what it was and he said that he has never seen that before which is  ridiculous and embarrassing coming from a security officer that is supposed to be protecting the apartment residents. He then told us that we need to carry our conversation to our apartment or his will call the police. We reminded him that we have the right to have our conversation privately in our car as long as we are not playing any loud music or disturbing the residence in any way and that he is welcome to run our plate number if he wants. He then got on his radio and started to dispatch the police describing us as two suspicious black men in a suspicious vehicle.  Sounds like a typical description that would attract the police faster as he continued to rudely flash the light on our eyes even after we told him several times to kindly stop harassing us. He continued to interrupt our conversation and  threatening that he can either do this the easy way of he can get the police involved. His supervisor officer Crosby eventually showed up and told us that we can carry our conversation in the car conflicting what his predecessor told us earlier. He was also able to verify my residency through my drivers' license as well as the gate clicker which the other officer didn't know what it was. Even after identifying myself to officer Crosby, they both decided to park next to us for few more minutes until our conversation was over in the car and I went back to my apartment then they left. WOW!!\n\nTo cut the story short, if you are a minority or someone against racism and residents harassment, you should run as far as you can away from Arcadia Cove Apartment. No one should EVER experience this type of humiliation at any residence in America and Arcadia Cove Apartments (MEB management services) have crossed the line this time.", "business_id": "T9p5rNXbxOYYIbdUOznXyQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-07-27", "type": "review"}

The office staff is decent at times, mostly rude.  When I go to pay rent they don't greet you or anything in the office, they just say \"yes?\" as if to say what do you want. They also never greet you in passing around the complex, I know it may seem minor but for the type of rent you pay its not too much to ask. \n\nSpeaking of paying, this is a nickle and dime operation.  Aside from high rent that keeps going up, they keep adding on charges, first for gas, then for pest control, that should be included in rent not added on as extra. For all this money what do you get? you get to hear rap music all hours of the day and night, trip over beer cans and smell weed and dog shit every time you step outside. If I wanted to live like that, I could just move to one of the shady places down the street for half the rent.\n\nTL:DR: If you want to live in a slum, there are much cheaper options in the area, if your looking for a nice place, spend a little more and go elsewhere.", "business_id": "T9p5rNXbxOYYIbdUOznXyQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-08-15", "type": "review"}

The parking spaces are VERY close so it can be a problem if people DON'T know how to park.\n\nThe problem came in when my apartment flooded... because the apartment above me flooded. She has about 2-3 inches of water and RIGHT before I went to bed one night it started... my smoke detector kept going off, and it was super annoying so I told my BF to take it down and we can call Frank in the morning. As soon as he took it down water started to come through it... that was already a huge sign and I no longer felt comfortable sleeping that night... but I was still going to try because I had to work the next morning. Soon after others started going off around the house and actually started to leak... I then called the hotline to get Frank out because something was seriously wrong and I didn't feel safe. No one would answer the hotline, I got nervous because by this time my whole apartment was leaking through whatever it could get through everything except my room and bathroom was leaking. It was so bad that bubbles started forming in my walls... anyway I called the fire department and they saw it said there was nothing they could do but we should try to call the hotline like we didn't do that before... the went upstairs to check the apartment above because we all figured it was something upstairs. They banged on the door and she came to the door, apparently she was sleeping but her living room was a mess! The fire department told me it wasn't safe to stay in my apartment that night. I knew by this time I wasn't going to get any sleep nor work tomorrow. Frank FINALLY came with some big vaccum and basically tried to blame her for the problem and vaccumed her apartment. I asked him to call the manager Joyce and he basically WOULDN'T! We then decided that we will stay at a hotel until tomorrow which is what we did. The next day she basically tried to refuse to give me another apartment saying that we needed to wait til ours was fixed again, but we went back before we talked to her and it was horrible the smell was bad and I started reading reviews online saying that the whole complex has leakage problems! I even read deeper and it just turned into a nightmare. I had to threaten to call the state before she gave me a new apartment. And get this it's smaller! But I STILL paid the same rent! She made me sign another lease for my last month and that was that. I was never late with rent, always kept to myself no problems and this is what I get.

It was our first concert here -- and we had a blast.  \n\nEven pushing 60, Heart puts on a great show.  The 'theater in the round' concept made it all the more awesome.  \n\nThere are a few things I wish somebody had told me ahead of time, so I'm going to share them with you now:\n\nMoney:\nPlan on having cash on hand for parking, concessions, etc.  Tickets can be picked up / purchased from the box office with a credit card.\n\nParking:\nParking at the theater is $5.  Cash.  Get there an hour ahead of time to get a good spot.  Pull through in the parking spot so that you can put your car in 'drive' when exiting the spot.  Choose a spot that is well lit if you're going to an evening event -- you're not in the greatest part of Phoenix.\n\nFood:\nI'm not sure if it's entirely obvious from the 'show nearby businesses' in Yelp, but there are NO RESTURANTS nearby.  When you get down there, it will be fairly obvious why -- you're in an industrial part of town.  Plan on eating ahead of time, or bringing your dinner with you.  \n\nGear:\nThe theater doesn't let you bring backpacks in, but will let you bring a purse in.  (I personally think it's a double standard).  I was a little disappointed that I had to pack my backpack in the trunk -- I would have left it at home.  \n\nSeating:\nI'm a big guy -- about 6'4\" -- and the seating IS NOT FRIENDLY TO LARGE PEOPLE.  At all.  Seriously.   I literally could not fit into my seat -- my legs would not fit.  Luckily I talked with an usher, who directed me to a red-shirted supervisor, who made a spot for my wife and I in the handicapped section.  The people who made this accommodation for me were very friendly about it.  I was told that in the future, I should actually instruct the box office to give me tickets in this section, or in the front row of the rear section (there is only a bar in this row -- so it would be more friendly to my legs).\n\nFood at the venue:\nThey have a full bar with premium brands, Coke, wine, Budweiser, Bud Light and many imported beers. Also, pizza, hot dogs, popcorn and other snacks are also available before and during shows.  So if the line is long before the show (and you can stand stepping out quickly during part of the event) you'll get a MUCH shorter line during the show.  You might even get no line (like I did).\n\nWhat I liked best:\nThe best part about this place is its intimate setting.  I know people have mentioned that before -- but it really can't be overstated.  You might have seen an act before -- but not 40ft away on a rotating stage.  \n\nThis place will definitely give you a night to remember.", "business_id": "BcBxTyj09Wu-w0KA1QvKTA", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-08-02", "type": "review"}

After almost 50 years of playing, you can bet he has his act perfected. He may not pack the show with that squealing guitar or technically complicated rifts that some bands feel they need to impress.  Of coarse, that doesn't mean he doesn't have his moments.  It's just that there is more to performing music than just playing technically difficult music and Bob, as well as his fans, figured this out a long time ago.  As a one-time musician, I know the magic of jamming freestyle with friends. There are moments when the emergency broadcast system sounds better. And there there are moments when you make magic you can't ever repeat. Every show Bob puts on is unique and will never be repeated. Every show has its own moments of magic. This is the beauty of watching true jam bands.  The reason I love the Blues is because you can't auto tune the Blues.  Just like the Blues, Bobs music has an emotion and feeling that many strive for but few achieve. There is a honesty and purity that some have and some don't. Bob had it...and still does.  Combine that with some of the nicest and most open minded fans around and you have yourself a good evening. Where else can you get a 20 year old hippy who doesn't know what day of the week it is with a 35 year old wasp and a 75 year old holding onto old glory days and everyone not only gets along but are friends for a few hours. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars, and I feel bad because it's not the bands fault, but some of their fans don't bath themselves.

I have been to good concerts and walked away feeling like this was a five star venue.  I have been to others and I hated it and vowed I would never be back.  \n\nPros\n-not a bad seat in the house and since the stage rotates you always have a good view\n-drinks are pretty reasonable for a venue (not reasonable in general, but compare it to say US Airways Center)\n-There are plenty of places to get concessions for such a small venue so the lines for them are never too bad.\n-The downstairs lounge is pretty cool before the show and it is fun to look around at the stuff displayed on the walls.\n-security does a great job here.  I never feel harassed, but at the same time I have seen situations break out and they handle them ASAP.\n\nCons\n-Parking.  The last two times I went they had increased to $10 for parking.  At this point I think they have the highest priced parking I pay for any venue in the valley and they have their own lot, so it is not even necessary.\n-Will call lines are ridiculous.  If you have tickets at will call, plan to get there an hour early.\n-Security lines to get in take forever as well.  My advice for this though is walk around a bit.  They have quite a few entrances and you may be able to find a short line at one.  People tend to follow the crowd.\n-The seats are small and uncomfortable.  If I have general admission tickets I tend to go to the back to have more space, but sometimes it is unavoidable.\n-I wish they were in a better location where there were near by bars to have a drink and a bite to eat before or after the show close by.\n\nThe last thing I wanted to include, but don't want to put it as a con, is there sound system is very inconsistent.  I don't know if it is the sound men touring with the artists or what, but I have been to shows that have had great sound and pulled me out of my seat.  Then I have been to others where I knew the artist and their songs and liked them, but left early because of how bad the sound was.

Do not hesitate, just go to them!!\n\nMy Apple iPhone4's battery has been on its last legs the past few months (the fact that Apple cannot put a battery in their $400 phones that can last more than a year is another debate for another review). Fortunately, a friend gave me an unused spare, so I was prepared to just do the work myself.  I had the proper tools but when it came to removing the battery to replace it with a new one, I was stymied trying to remove the one stupid 2.5 mm screw that kept the battery connection in place.\n\nConcerned that I might \"strip\" the screw completely if I tried to keep muscle-ing it, I sought expert help to see how much it would cost just to take the stupid screw out for me. That's it. Nothing more. I'll take it from there.  As a self-employed professional myself, I don't expect anyone to work or put in their time for free and I was prepared to pay a reasonable amount for whoever did the work's time and trouble.  I did a Google search and came up with three establishments in my immediate area.  The first one did not answer the phone(in fairness, it was lunch time), and the third one, rather dismissively, came up with some lamea*s excuse about the screw being stripped and maybe needing a new connector and said, I quote:  \"I can't help you, man\".  I won't mention this establishment by name, but suffice to say they are located at the NE corner of 7th St. and Union Hills and their number is 480-559-9694.  My 2nd call was to Sun Cellular and the phone was answered by a young fellow named Issac.  I explained my problem to him and what I needed done and, after listening and confirming all I needed was the screw taken out, he invited me to come on down.\n\nAbout an hour later, when I came in to their shop off Bell Rd., a young man behind the counter was the first to greet me.  Turns out it was Issac.  I re-introduced myself and my problem and he kindly took my phone in back to take a look.  I had barely had the chance to sit down in their comfortable waiting area when he popped out of the back smiling, holding the tiny screw in one hand and my iPhone and back cover (I had pre-removed the pentalobe screws so as to take up less of his time) in the other.  Hallelujah!   I then asked if I could pay some sort of \"diagnostic\" or other j*rkoff fee for their labor and trouble, but Issac said that it was no big deal.  I asked him if he was sure, as I had no problem paying something for their assistance, and Issac kindly declined again.  In fact, a slightly older fellow who was also behind the counter (who, I'm guessing, may be the owner/proprietor) chimed in with, \"Anyone who would charge you for that should be shot...\"  Wow.\n\nIn this day and age, it is so rare to find such friendly and service-oriented professionals--particularly when it comes to repair of consumer electronics.  The reviews you read on this Yelp listing are clearly no joke.  These guys are the real deal, and iPhone repair shops throughout the Valley (including the last crew that fixed my phone) could learn a lot from them.  I can't speak to their experience with any other brands, but in terms of plain honesty, customer service, and sheer professionalism, you owe it to yourself and your smartphone to visit Sun Cellular.  I know I will, and will send everyone I know of there, as well.", "business_id": "4anyLAWqWVZh5BFpol9czQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-08-29", "type": "review"}

Since none of us have ever lived here before, we did not know that the website was filled with lies and illusions. Though on the outside the complex appears cheery, the people in the office are less then subpar. hey have the customer service skills of a rock. Upon moving in, my roommate and I began to experience loud noises and fighting coming from our neighbors on the 3rd floor. The fight literally lasted from 1:00AM -5:00AM. I woke up for work (tired from the lack of sleep) and they were STILL fighting. It sounded like a girl and a guy were really having some relationship issues. I let it go and continued on to work. \n\nThe next night  the fighting continued. Now it sounded like it was getting violent with shouts like \"YOU HIT ME FIRST,\" and \"I WILL PUNCH YOU IN THE FACE.\" I could not take it anymore and decided to call the police. At 2:45AM on a Wednesday I called the police to file a noise complaint. The operator was extremely nice for the early hour and sent 2 officers out. After about 20-30 minutes I hear loud knocking on the door above me. Finally the yelling stopped and I was able to get some sleep (Thanks to Phoenix's Finest). The next night the fighting continued and so did the loud bangs and booms. When I say loud noises, I am talking about \"booms\" so loud that our windows shook in the bedrooms. It sounded like bowling balls were being thrown around...or bodies. My roommate came into my room to see if I was awake and to no surprise I was already staring at the ceiling seeing red. We decided to call the police again at around the usual 2:45AM time. This time we requested for the cop to come down to our place and report what they discussed with the inconsiderate neighbors. After dozing in and out trying to stay awake about an hour and a half later we decided that we couldnt wait for the police any longer and fell asleep. I was jolted awake when i heard a loud knock on our front door. I hopped out of bed and walked towards the front, my roommate quickly stopped me and said that was not the cop. She said that the knock did not sound like a cop's knock. Before I could look through the peep hole we then heard through the door \"OPEN UP, WE KNOW YOU CALLED THE COPS.\" it was our lovely neighbors paying us a visit. Again they continued on saying \"IF YOU HAVE THE BALLS TO CALL THE COPS YOU SHOULD HAVE THE BALLS TO OPEN THE DOOR.\" The knocking continued for another 7-10 minutes and progressively became louder and louder. We then heard one of the guys run  up and down the stairs screaming and banging on other tenants doors in a fit of rage that the police were called on them. My roommate and I never went back to sleep and drove around from 6:00AM-9:00AM to wait for the office to open. When the office opened we went in to let them know about the insane madness that went on during the night. Let's not forget I had to call out of work and miss out on an opportunity to make money. The office could care less and did absolutely nothing. With the exception of one employee, CJ, the office employees have no sense of how to treat a person. The manager, Lisa,  was the worst of all. She spoke over me, made me seem like i was blowing things out of proportion and when I stated how upset it made me feel she followed by stating \"we have all gone through difficult things in our life.\" \n\nCurrently as it stands my roommate and I have been here for about 4 months and are still dealing with the horrible neighbors. I have been called a \"bitch\" by one of them while walking to my car, the noise will not stop and is still causing us sleepless nights, our complaints are left unheard and unnoticed, it is flat out miserable. The 2 of the neighbors have moved out but now the one left has his friends staying with him and they make more noise then ever. Our place is absolutely miserable. Our door is constantly being knocked on and just tonight the neighbors jiggled the handle while we were sitting in the living room watching TV. We have become a joke to them because they know the office will not do anything. they could care less about the people who live here and I have never lived in a place that was so disrespectful to their tenants. We have gone to everyone working in there and they all act like their hands are tied. It's pathetic. The last person I spoke with today stated that if we wait a week \"things should work out themselves.\" when i asked for the number to the customer relations to file a complaint, she basically told me that it would not do any good and refused to give it to me. \n\nWhatever you do DO NOT LIVE HERE!!! It is not worth it. They make you sign a 15 month lease and trap you in with unpleasant people both in the office and living around you. This is also in a crap neighborhood.

Actually, yeah, you really do. I gotta respect honey bears for becoming somewhat of an icon in the valley, but the pulled pork leaves a little room for improvement. My opinion is that it's cooked at too high of a temp. (note to honeybear: aim for 225 degrees - get staff in earlier if necessary)  Too high temp results in not enough time in it's early cooking stages to absorb that smoke flavor, which is also evidenced by an absence of color.   Slower cook time will also take some of the bite out of the meat.  But hey, it seems to be selling, so why change?  Maybe they should change the slogan though.  It is tasty, but all of the pork sandwich's flavor comes from the sauce, which is pretty unique - give me 100 sauces and i guarantee i can pick out honeybears.", "business_id": "xfk9eY8gmwn8qsbyd-W6lQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-06-09", "type": "review"}

We have had two birthday parties there and the kids loved it. \n\nThe kids wanted a ride on the tram which was nice in the evening , we learned new facts from the guide and a little about the Zoo's work on keeping many animals from becoming extinct.\n\nMy 9 year old and my best friends 10 year old have been coming here since they were 2 and 3 .

I've been to this zoo almost every other year since I was 4 years old. I'm 23 now.\n\nI'm planning another \"back to Arizona\" trip, since I moved away from AZ for about 5 years, and missed AZ so much that I just HAD to come back. I went to the Kansas Zoo, and wow, was it HORRIBLE! There was next to nothing compared to the Phoenix Zoo. I remember going and hearing people say how Amazing it was, then after actually going to it, it made me miss and appreciate the Phoenix Zoo even more. \n\nThis place is huge, and has a really cute lay out. I don't know why so many people said it was a bad lay out, or not a good zoo. Everytime I've went, the animals were out and about. We even saw bear cubs wrestling with each other while the mother/father watched. A white bird kept saying \"hello pretty\" to me, and \"no!\" to my brother, hahaha.  \n\nThey now have the up close giraffe exhibit, as someone else mentioned. They never had that when I was growing up, so I'm really excited to go and see how that is.\n\nI give this zoo a 5/5 stars, because I've never once had a problem. For the people complaining about strollers, I completely agree but it's expected when people have so many kids now a days :( Makes it sort of hard for the ones that don't have kids to enjoy stuff when you have 5 kids and 3 strollers in front of you, or on your toes. \n\nThe gift shops are great! Sure, they may be a tad overpriced, but when are gift shops not over priced? Exactly.\n\nDon't forget zoo lights. I don't know of any other Zoo's that have it, but if you have a zoo with zoo lights, consider yourself lucky, and go to one immediately . If you don't have one, come to the Phoenix Zoo around Christmas time, and see the zoo lights. It's so pretty, and puts you in such a great Christmas mood. It definitely brings out the Christmas now a days, since most people don't seem to decorate or celebrate it as much, anymore =(", "business_id": "1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-06-24", "type": "review"}

Having worked at a zoo in the past I can say that the board of directors at Phoenix Zoo must be very progressive.  The zoo is very focused on it's main target audience: kids.  The displays are well done to allow small ones excellent views of the animals.  A couple good examples are the Komodo Dragon exhibit and the new Orangutan exhibit.  The open monkey exhibit is wonderful too.  So much effort has gone into developing interactive and exciting ways to see the animals here.  They put a lot of effort into showing animals together, the big savanna exhibit is well done with many animals allowed to free roam the large area.  \nIt is a big departure from some of the more urban zoos and they have tried very hard to move away from the traditional concrete boxes that are more often seen in many of the older zoos.  One disadvantage of this is that the animals have places to hide and sometimes are not in view.   While this might suck a little for the humans, it is something that lends the animals a respite from the stresses of being in captivity even if just a little.  One workaround is to come early, this also keeps one from dissolving into a puddle of heated goo as the temperatures climb (if you're coming in summer).  We fixed this problem by getting a membership and coming during the member hour in the morning when we can.  The animals are more active and so are we.  I have had many wonderful conversations with keepers and docents alike here, we plan on keeping a membership for quite some time to support this wonderful zoo.", "business_id": "1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-08-19", "type": "review"}

I had no expectations (I prefer going without others interpretations). I was pleasantly surprised. The parking is super easy and ticketing is too. You will have choices if you want just an entrance fee, the \"wild\" (all inclusive) price or a membership. We chose the \"wild\" so that we could experience everything. I found the extra's to not be very special for us, especially since we are adults, it might be more beneficial if you are traveling with children.\n\nThe zoo is very easy to navigate and has a natural flow with the trails. You can easily see all the attractions without even referencing the zoo map. What I loved the most about this zoo is that many of their attractions are the kind in which you walk into the attraction. Meaning that quite often you are literally face to face with the animal life. At one point I was only a foot away from a free flying Turkey Buzzard, who found us amusing and followed us around the enclosure. The opportunity to photograph these amazing animals with nothing to impede your camera is AWESOME. \n\nThe negatives are that you are in the desert and are subject to high temperatures. The day we were there the temperature was in the low 100's and when you are walking in the areas that have no shading you start to really feel it. Then you will come across an exhibit like the Orangutan's and you are in a perfectly air conditioned environment. I also found the train ride to be absolutely a waste of time. It is a guided tour through the park that takes 25 minutes, but I have to warn you, it doesn't go a route that you can't walk on your own and it NEVER stops. As the guide tells you to look for an animal under a tree, behind a bush or whatever, you are lucky if you spot it before he has moved onto the next exhibit. For you photographers, don't even bother, it was useless. Also if there are loud people or kids in your section of the train you will not be able to hear a bloody thing the guide is saying. Halfway through I put down my camera and just looked around, usually for the wildlife that was not in an exhibit.\n\nSpeaking of the wildlife, the grounds at this zoo are beautiful. It is for the most part natural desert landscaping, with water moving throughout the park. There are many picturesque spots to stop in and get out of the heat and enjoy the natural environment. There are TONS of indiginous wildlife running around you in these areas. I took equal amounts of photos between the exhibited animals and the ones that have chosen to make the zoo their home.\n\nI love LOVE that the majority of the exhibits are large and in a natural state for the animal they are housing. They have given the animals the choice on whether they want to be seen or not. And even though this may upset some guests, I love that it is in the animals favor. A must see is The Monkey Village, it is a very rare opportunity to be in a monkey enclosure with nothing between you and the Squirrel Monkey. One more area that merits special attention is the Stingray area. It is included in the \"wild\" purchase price or you can pay extra to go into it. Here you will have the opportunity to pet and feed stingrays. They were fun to watch and pet. \nThere are other one on one opportunities in the park, like feeding giraffes. If you've always wanted to get up close and personal this is your chance.\n\nDefinitely would recommend visiting the Phoenix Zoo, make sure you check their schedule because their hours change depending on the season.", "business_id": "1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-06-02", "type": "review"}

It was overcast most of the morning until about 11:30 when the sun decided to break through and then it admittedly became more and more brutal to be there. The zoo closes at 2pm during the summer because of the heat.

The exhibits are natural looking so it mentally takes you out of the city for a while. They also utilize the mountain and desert landscape for some of the exhibits. The Bighorn Sheep exhibit particularly comes to mind. It's well done, and cool to see some of the sheep climbing around the natural existing Phoenix mountain crevasses for shelter and shade.  \n\nThe only thing I would complain about are the crazy prices of food and drinks. I don't mind spending money to support the zoo, but I don't want to feel like I'm getting ripped off in the process.

I guess I'll start from the beginning. \n\nMy husband and I stayed here the night before we departed for our honeymoon. The front desk staff was so nice and helpful. \n\nOnce we finished the check in process which was super easy and NOT PAINFUL, we went up to our room and started to get comfortable. After about 15 minutes, we heard a knock on the door. It was the concierge with a bottle of champagne and gourmet chocolate cake and ice-cream. We were confused (yet excited) as to why they brought this to our room. We did not order it. They just wanted to congratulate us on our honeymoon! How thoughtful is that?! \n\nThe food and champagne was so delicious and they really made us feel so valued and welcomed. I have never experienced that before (without having to pre-order).\n\nAlso, I'd like the driver, Carlos to get recognition. He was always on top of it. He got us to and from the airport on time and in style. When he picked us up from the airport, he even brought us refreshments. He was also very friendly, yet professional. If you're lucky enough to stay here, I hope you also get to experience Carlos.

The pet fee is only $25 and they have a designated pet relief area, super pet friendly hotel!  I was impressed, I'm sure Duncan was as well!  Our room was one of the larger suites I've seen at a Residence Inn and the closets were also noticeably larger.   Also the pool was a nice size and not busy at all on the weekend!  The gym isnt large, but the equipment was new and there wasnt ever more than one other person each time I went in.

Super close to the airport and the price was right. \nStayed here for one night on 6/14. My friend had already checked in earlier than I did since my flight was coming in later that evening. \nThe property was clean,  the room was nice and comfy, the shuttle driver that evening was sooo very polite/nice/helpful &  the breakfast was perfect for our road trip up to Sedona.\nMy huge complaint and the reason for a 2 star. I called a few days before my arrival asking about the airport shuttle:\n1.) What do I do when I get into Phoenix Airport to notify I need a pick up? The clerk says just call when you get in and we'll pick you up\n2.) Is there any fee? She said no \"complementary for guest\" but, tip is not included. \nOkay great that's super easy. \nI get in around 10pm and I did exactly what the clerk told me.  I called the front desk but,  at first no answer.  I called my girlfriend having to see if anyone is at the front desk and I call again then Sam, front desk answers.. I'm super happy someone picked up and I told him I need a shuttle pick up and I'm at Terminal 3. Now,  this is my first time here at Phoenix Airport.  Sam tells me I need to get my luggage and figure out how to get to Terminal 4, door 1. So Of Course I asked where is Terminal 4, I'm at Terminal 3. He said I have to ask and figure that part out. But, I'm sending my driver now over to Terminal 4, door 1. Ok,  I asked one of the airport workers if they could help me find Terminal 4. They told me it's about 20 minutes from here. I have to walk up to the 2nd floor, catch a Tran that'll take me to Terminal 4. Walk down this long hallway and I'll be at my destination. \nI finally get to terminal 4, door 1 took me about 20-30minutes. I see the shuttle bus and wave him down,  I'm exhausted coming from a 6 hr flight,  my legs are tired,  and I'm happy to see the driver.  I apologized to him telling him so sorry I was at Terminal 3 and this is my first time here at the airport.  Sam told me to go to Terminal 4 and the driver was questioning why?  And I had no clue just thought it was the standard pick up area. The driver told me he could of picked me up at Terminal 3 and not have me walk/Tran this long. \nSo I checked in with Sam and we (the driver/I) asked Sam why didn't he have the pick up at Terminal 3. No remorse on his face,  no apologies only a straight face saying \"well you friend called and said to have the shuttle pick you up at baggage claim\" so I was in no mood in complaining super exhausted, it's about 11-11:15pm already,  and just wanted to crash, deal with this later.\nHowever,  when we woke up the next morning to have breakfast I did let the front desk know about my experience. \nNow,  this is what should of took place prior to my Phone call\n1.) They should of asked if this is my first time to the Phoenix area?\nIf so,  they should of explained more details of where to go and they should of inquired more details of my flight to see what terminal I would be coming in\n2.) Sam should of accommodate me as soon as I said \"I'm at Terminal 3\" and not make it difficult for me to go out of my way to accommodate him. \n3.) Professionally Sam should of apologized to me and the driver for his inconsistency information\n4.) Being that it was dark and late Sam should of at least escorted me to the building instead of having me tryna find my way in a dark alley... no lights to direct your path and kinda scary for females in an unknown area\n\nWould I stay here again if ever travel back to Phoenix probably not", "business_id": "LO3uvzhh3fUtEQD3AJUxWw", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-06-26", "type": "review"}

This partly because my interest is not piqued by fire or fire trucks, and partly because it is well-hidden in the shrubs of Papago Park.  But, I must say, it was a pleasantly surprising treat - and surprisingly large.  First, beware that the large bell by the front door does indeed work, very loudly, so resist the urge to bang it.\n\nThe museum has everything from antique fire trucks, to pictures and medals, to a kids' play area.  It even has a fire pole that you can slide down. The only thing sadly missing is the firemen.\n\nThe first gallery is filled with historic fire trucks that are so old, they are not even trucks.  They are carriages!  That were once pulled by horses!  The second gallery is filled with old fire trucks, including a large truck that kids (and adults) are allowed to climb on.  The third gallery is filled with more trucks and includes a child's play area. My kids really enjoyed playing in this area, we had to tear them away after nearly two hours.  The air conditioning is not stellar, so its humid and stuffy in there, but it still beats the 110-degree temperature outside.\n\nThe last gallery includes (yup - you guessed it!) MORE fire trucks. It also shows a 70s equipped dispatch center. Even though the computers and switchboard are decades old, the calls coming in are very real, as they are the real calls currently going to dispatch.\n\nAnd then there are also lots of photos and medals displayed on the walls, fire safety videos and information, clothing and hats for the kids to wear, among either trinkets and visuals.\n\nHaving never been a 7-year old boy, my interest in fire trucks can only be stretched so far, but for $6, this was definitely worth the excursion, and my kids and husband loved it.", "business_id": "fKwCjTBOmwcbl4XtYRZToQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-06-09", "type": "review"}

Close to Loop 202 and SR-143, the Peaks are in a convenient location to the downtown areas in Tempe, Scottsdale and Phoenix. The complex is massive and it can be a bit confusing to navigate. Papago Park is easily accessible from the complex, as there is a gated fence on the east side leading into the park. The complex is clean, modern and safe, has lush landscaping and multiple amenities. The Peaks is home to several swimming pools, volleyball courts, a car wash, gym, grills, racquetball courts, a convenience store and more. The rent is quite reasonable as well. On the downside, it does tend to attract some of the ASU crowd and for that reason can get noisy during the Fall or Spring semesters. Although it's in a pretty convenient location, it isn't in a walkable neighborhood, as you will still need to drive to get to the nearest grocery store, pharmacy, restaurant or entertainment facilities. The light rail line is nearby, but the nearest stop is roughly a 20-minute walk to 44th Street and Washington. \n\nIn sum, I would recommend living here as it is very cozy, set in a convenient location and many of the complaints I've read about these apartments seem rather antiquated.

It's not great, but it also hasn't been awful.  This complex does try to do a lot for its residents in the way of social events.  Last year we had food trucks come by in the late afternoon, had a free professional picture taken for the holidays, movie nights by the pool, and other social gatherings.  They do a yearly apartment inspection/fire alarm inspection, and usually change the battery.  I personally enjoy seeing the water features throughout the property.\n\nWe moved into one of their upgraded apartments while my cousin had moved into an older unit the year before us.  She told me that, as a perk of being a long time member, she had a choice between a few unit upgrades.  She chose free carpet cleaning which, having a rambunctious cat, was really helpful.\n\nWe've had our fair share of 'communal living' issues--gates getting stuck form time to time, being able to hear the water and some noises from above neighbors (but not from the ones next to us or behind us), dishwasher doesn't clean dishes properly, stove light and oven light weren't working when we moved in, vent in bathroom was squeaking and blowing chunks of dust onto our towels (ended up getting a towel rack to hang on the door), chain inside the toilet broke a year later, back screen door has always been a hassle to deal with, ceiling fan squeaks when it is on high.  The lights in front of my apartment and parking lot have gone out during several storms since we've been here... which I actually don't mind, since I don't like the light that's pretty much beaming right into our window at night.\n\nALL requests have been fixed promptly by maintenance.\n\nMy two biggest issues with maintenance were when there was a leak coming from the ceiling above my shower.  At one point, the water had formed a huge bubble, held up by paint.  It finally popped and water was leaking out of it by the time maintance came to fix it.  Their idea of fixing seemed to be smoothing some plaster over it.  It was such a poor job, hardened points of the stuff were sticking out from the wall.  There was even an air pocket in it, which made me worry about getting mold in the bathroom.  I had called them out twice for the issue before it was finally resolved, which makes me think that having my bathroom rug tossed out and not replaced, along with leaving flecks of dried plaster all over the place had something to do with it.\n\nOur other issue was the water heater.  I had called them out 2-3 times before it was resolved. First the heater itself was checked, but the found the breakers needed switching back.  This happened two times before someone finally went in to check on it.  Turns out the element had corroded far beyond replacing and the whole thing needed to be replaced.  It would take a day or two for the whole process, (the water needed to be drained from the old unit to lighten it (and eventually get over my balcony), and the second one was put in (having a cousin the same complex is really helpful).  The maintenance guys were really nice about the whole thing and explained to me what was going on during the process.  I'm just upset that it took that many times rather than have it checked the first time (it wasn't the first time we'd had a problem with it).\n\nOverall, I like living here.  We don't have any indoor pest problems (aside from the fungus gnats that come up from the drain if we leave our dishes out for too long).  No roaches, no scorpions, haven't seen any spiders, and no ant invasion in the summer.  My boyfriend composts on the patio and it's been a pretty decent experience.\n\nWe're pretty much kept to ourselves, so any neighbor drama is beyond me.  Occasionally there will be an argument heard in the corridors, but we can't hear it from our room.  Cops have been called here, some people let their dogs crap out by our apartment (which we ended up getting an email saying we had pets), and once got an email about some weirdo creeping about the complex (though we never came across him.)  The parking lot in my area is pretty quiet for the most part, enough to where I can stay in my parked car with the windows rolled down if it's a nice evening.\n\nThe only thing I have a small gripe about is the convenience store that was supposed to be opening in our complex next to the car wash port.  That would be super, since the Circle K down the street seems to attract a lot of nearby junkies.", "business_id": "MfqEPdcw0UYVdDoV3p77tQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-06-04", "type": "review"}

It was pretty tasty. \nThey also serve home made baklava, which I haven't tried, but it looks very yummy. \nThis place is great for eatin' cheap and a tasty slice of pizza.", "business_id": "ZAgPh4v-oOb1g6cdlkKI0g", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-06-18", "type": "review"}

Yeah, so I moved into a modest studio apartment at 52nd Street and Van Buren. It builds character. Sure, it was western exposure and I couldn't afford to run the AC. Shows endurance. And I learned to spend what little money I made wisely. Fiscal conservatism rocks! Well, part of that meant finding a cheap and nearby place to wash my chonies and other clothes. Finding good eats was coincidental. Every Saturday morning, I'd set my VCR to record X-Men Generation, loaded up my Sportage with a week's worth of dirty clothes and headed to the laundromat at 48th and VB. Initially, I'd stroll on over to the Circle K during the wash cycle, get something that was certain to introduce me to my toilet after the spin cycle and that was about normal. One day, I bravely headed north and stumbled upon Phx House of Pizza and Subs. Like a mirage in the desert, it called out to me with intriguing smells of delishness. It was lust at first sight. The 2 slices of pizza would keep me filled until afternoon and were amazingly tasty. Truly, I found happiness.\n\nAnd so it was, a Saturday ritual whilest my clothing was being laundered I succumbed to the garlicky goodness that is PHOPS. Sadly, I found love and moved to the other side of town and it seemed I was watching an endearing lover grow smaller in my rear view mirror as I drove on. :sigh: I did know what good, economically-friendly dining was. I shall never forget you.\n\nOh, and honey, if you're reading this: You're way better than pizza.

I have played this course many, many times. However it has a few years since I have been there and I had yet to play the new renovated course.  I have used the practice range a few times since the course reopened and like the new additions so I was excited to play the course again and see the new changes.  I was a little disappointed.  The carts are new Club Car's and they are equipped with a GPS featured that disables the golf cart if the driver takes the cart into an area where it should not be. I can certain understand how this is a good idea. However I think they have the settings a little too high.  If you approach the green from the wrong side the disable feature engages.  The cart paths are for the most part gone.  They are still in a temporary club house from 2 years ago.  I read in the paper that the management company that was awarded the contract to run the course is having some challenges.   That is an understatement. \n\nSo I guess this course will go down in my memory similar to the other Phoenix landmarks that are now gone.  Similar to the old Cine Capri Movie theater on 24th street.

There are several different stores and restaurants located within the center that anyone may go and explore when they want to. On my first journey here I parked outside of the supermarket called Ranch Market. On the outside and on the inside it looks like a typical grocery store that you would find in Arizona, such as a Safeway of Fry's; the only main difference is the produce and items that they sell. Each aisle is stocked with unique foods, candies, drinks... Their fresh produce section, along with their \"deli\" section was the most interesting thing to me personally.  You can find crazy colored and shaped produce that you typically would never see at a Safeway. The \"deli\" section was filled with baby octopus to fresh fish. Ranch Market offers many Chinese cultural foods. The only main down side is that it smelled strongly of seafood, because of their foods they offer in the market. \n\nVisiting the market, my friend and I walked around the rest of the center. We found the Chinese Cultural Botanical Garden. This was my favorite part of the whole center, because it is a beautiful garden set up around a large pond filled with lily pads, fountains, statues, and koi fish. Around the pond you could walk along a path that had interesting marble statues that you could read, observe, and touch if you wanted to. The statues had plaques in English and Chinese that you could read, in order to learn the history of what it is that you were looking at. The Botanical Garden is nicely set up as a little journey pathway. The architecture is extremely interesting and vibrant. I did not think that there was a single down side but I would suggest that you go the the botanical garden when it is nice and cool outside. Because it is all outside, you would not want to be walking around trying to enjoy it in 100 degree weather. \n\nLastly my friend and I decided to walk into a small shop called The Oriental Factory Direct. This was a shop filled to the brim with Chinese cultural artifacts, clothing, weapons, pieces of art, jewelery, stationary... You could find almost anything in this shop. The atmosphere was extremely welcoming and calming. My favorite part of this shop was looking around at everything they offered for me to buy. The shop keeper was also tremendously friendly; she was eager to answer any of our questions and teach us anything we wanted to learn about. I loved the atmosphere and the people here.\n\nI gave the COFCO Chinese Cultural Center  a good rating, because I completely enjoyed the new experience. It can be a good drive for some people, but if you live near it, it is extremely convenient. The only thing I would have done differently was given myself more time to enjoy the other restaurants and shops. And i definitely would have gone when it was cooler outside.

But then again, most people really only write bad reviews for rental car companies.  I booked through Priceline and got an awesome deal for a compact car; the amount I paid for 6 days was equivalent to the amount previously paid for a 3 day airport car rental.  Enterprise had no problems with my reservation and they had a driver pick me up from my apartment (providing an hour window) and straight to the rental car location.  \n\nThe actual location is very clean so they apparently really stepped up their game.  Its definitely not as chaotic as a airport rental company and the car they selected was clean and pretty impressive for a Hyundai.  The attendant also reviewed the entire exterior of the car with me before sending me on my merry way.  Returning the vehicle was also straight-forward.  Since I had to catch a flight immediately after returning my rental, they gave me 2 options: (1) Call earlier that day and schedule someone to drive me to Skytrain for free, (2) Call 10 minutes beforehand and they arrange to have a taxi waiting.  Since I did not want to risk taking the Skytrain for the first time, I opted for the taxi and they gave me an agreement slip which made the cab ride a $12 flat rate (the meter read around $12.60 so I saved some spare change).\n\nOverall, everyone was professional and friendly and I would highly recommend renting a car from this location.  As corny as this may sound, this is truly one of the best rental car companies I have come across.\n\nOne tip: I believe the hours listed on Yelp indicate that they open at 7:30 AM.

I had Helen Y. with me (Jason W. was along for the culinary experience as well), and she helped us navigate the Chinese menu, explaining about Szechwan cuisine and selecting some different dishes for us to try. I don't remember everything we tried, but the two standout dishes were definitely the fish filets and the water-boiled beef. The fish was cooked perfectly, with a creamy texture and a simple, sweet flavor. The water-boiled beef was spicy and so satisfying - my sinuses totally felt clearer as I ate it! I also enjoyed the soup buns. I'm not a big lamb fan, but the lamb riblets that Helen described in her review were good and would probably be a big hit with anyone who doesn't mind the gamier taste. \n\nThe restaurant's atmosphere isn't anything to write home about, but the service was decent and the prices (about $15 a person) were definitely really reasonable for the amount and quality of the food we tried.

It was also the first time I saw any Chinese people in Phoenix. Located in the Chinese Cultural Center of Phoenix, Szechwan Palace has delicious Chinese food (reminds me of home), and is located close to the airport if you're looking for a quick and delicious meal. \n\nMy mom's friend took me here for a quick dinner before dropping me off at the airport. She goes there often so the waitstaff already knew her favorite dish and bantered a bit, teasing me because of my Taiwanese accented Mandarin and because I can't read Simplified Chinese (it's so confusing though, with all the straight lines and boxiness...). The food was great, the inside clean (light wood floors and tables and white painted walls, making it feel very spacious and airy).  \n\nWe ordered: \n\n1. Wu Gen Chang Wan - I don't know the English name of this, but it's a stew of pigs intestine, pig's blood, leek, white cabbage (the one in kimchi), and red peppers. It was the perfect kind of spice, that warms your mouth, but didn't distract from the flavor of the pickled vegetables, the lightly textured blood, and the flavor of the intestine. The intestines were extremely tender without any chew to them, so you could bite right through and taste the fat and the flavor. It wasn't even stinky at all. \n\n2. Yi Xiang Eggplant - Your usual eggplant from a Chinese restaurant, but with a Szechwan kick. Japanese eggplant sliced and lightly fried in a sauce that was mildly spicy with a hint of sweetness. It had small pieces of minced pork as well. The eggplant was not too fried or burnt on the outside, but well-done and soft on the inside. \n\n3. Hong Shao Pai Gu - This is like a braised pork ribs, served with whole shiitake mushrooms and sliced bamboo shoots. Some of the meat was a little tough, but the overall flavor was great (mostly soy sauce, maybe a little tamarind). This dish was NOT spicy, so it was a good break for my mouth in between the other dishes. \n\n4. Bo Cai - Sauteed spinach with garlic. Fairly typical, the kind of spinach that makes your teeth feel like they've been scraped. Good to get a little green in  there. \n\nThe atmosphere was pretty nice and conducive to a conversation. Apparently you can request more spice; I didn't know that or I would have. I guess this is the usual mild level that they give to new customers. \n\nIt seemed the place was very popular; there were constantly people coming in and out, and several families with small children, which the staff was very accommodating to (with booster seats and high chairs). There were also many Chinese patrons, which is always a good sign. It was also nice to hear conversational Mandarin around me after so long...\n\nIf I ever return to Phoenix, I'm coming straight here to get a real Chinese food fix!", "business_id": "yQONzVpX-DEpGSuKMIov6A", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-07-18", "type": "review"}

The sesame chicken was only bits of fried chicken in batter covered with very little brown very thick and gooey sweet sauce.  Some of the chicken pieces didn't even have sauce on it and grossed me out because it was hard and bland.

Good rendition.\n\n-Chongqing Spicy Chicken (Chongqing lazi ji): Ask for \"with  bones\". The meat comes from the chicken wing and drumette portion.

The owner could have mentioned that i could have gotten all veggies, but she didn't when I questioned her and I didn't figure out on the long menu that i could have gotten the same dish for $7.95 with no disgusting beef on the American side of the menu instead of paying a buck more.

Often these menus are not even in English (or Dutch as it were).\n\nWell, my looking in Phoenix has come to an end.  Szechwan Palance has such a menu.  Granted, theirs is not so seret, they share the same menu, but in different sections.\n\nI have been here twice and I have found the food to be quite good.  there are some edgier dishes that we have not braved yet (i.e. kidney, brains, intestines, odd seafood etc.) but the ones we have tried have been quite tasty.  \n\nDan Dan Noodle, simple and right on, small bowl, but rather cheap.\nChinese egglplant in spicy bean sauce - very good, ordered it twice, and I do not even like eggplant.\nBeef boiled soup - I have grown to love this dish over the last few years (starting in netherlands),  There are so many flavors and interesting items included.

Most would never be able to spot the store manager at the Arcadia store because more often than not you will see him stocking shelves. You just have to know that's the boss. That fits with my idea of management. When the boss is that hands-on, he's interfacing with customers and employees and knows what they have to deal with and can make better decisions. That's what makes Costco work so well. They work out great deals with vendors but they deliver a good shopping experience also.", "business_id": "XLqnjlLYt0_q_NG7l_BpMA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-08-29", "type": "review"}

Alcohol selection is great, and the Kirkland brand is generally quite good for a house label.  \n\nGas is also up to 30 cents cheaper per gallon. Very convenient for those of us who live nearby. I don't drive a fancy car so I'm not concerned about it possibly not having additives like the \"top tier\" brands. My family has been getting Costco gas for years and our vehicles are going strong with 215,000+ miles.  The rewards of the AMEX card pays for my membership so it's basically free and then some.  \n\nCosto has everything: food, clothes, jewelry, electronics, housewares, liquor, wine, beer, sugar, salt, toys, towels, juicers, movie tickets, drugs, vacations, coffins (save a family member some trouble later on?).  Do your research and find out what's worth buying or not.  \n\nI dream of the $1.50 polish sausage and soda.

What the heck are you doing to the bananas???  I mean, I know the sign says, \"Control Ripening Technology\" but this so-called \"technology\" is making your bags of bananas turn into bags of banana mush.\n\nBasically, I buy the bananas. I leave them in the bag. The bag assures me that moisture in the bag is good for my bananas.  But, THE BAG IS WRONG.  My bananas get soggy. The peel falls off. The banana turns brown.  \n\nIf I try to eat the bananas immediately, when I break one off, it breaks away the peel from the other bananas because the moisture has made the skin weak and useless. So now I have a bunch of partly unpeeled bananas.  It is madness.  \n\nI will cut you slack because they are insanely cheap and you give me free samples of tuna fish on fancy crackers, but Costco, it is time to reject that stupid technology and put the holes back in the bag. Or, just stop selling bananas because as of right now you are reeking havoc on our local garbage men who are forced to deal with garbage cans full of bananas mush.  I know, in the realm of trash, banana mush is seemingly innocent, but that stuff LEAKS.  Then you step in it and your shoe becomes squeaky. The mush leaks onto other bags  and then you have banana mush laden trash that attracts fruit flies.  Nothing annoys me more than fruit flies. (And, apparently I speak for all trash men.)

Plenty of living room furniture to sit on and kill time.)\n\nMeandering inside to the Tire Department I was greeted by a lovely chap. (I believe his name is Rene.)\n\nRene: [Sprinting across the floor] Have you been helped? Can I help?\nMe: [Still mentally sluggish] Uh...yes. My tire is ...\n\n[I stare around looking for a word.]\n\nMe: Flat. \n[It's not my fault I like Guinness.]\n\nRene: Ok! Let's go look. \n[Starts a walk so fast thru the parking lot I struggle to keep up.]\n\nRene examines my tire visually. As there is no visible signs of damage my tire is then misted with a soap spray. Still, nada. I head inside to start a work order. I meet Mari, cute as a button, who has more energy than a tween. [I suspect Marie was not out drinking Guinness like a champ six hours prior.]\n\nAs Mari enters my information my mind wanders to the cost of a new tire. Despondent over the fashion things that will be affected by this un-planned cost I inquire on tire pricing.\n\nMari did not laugh at me. \nNo, I don't know the kind of tires on my car.\nNo, I don't really know the year of my car.\nNo, I don't know if my Ford Escape is an xlt.

Mari did laugh, but *with* me.\nYes, I am a fool as to all things car.\n\nApproximately two hours later Mari rang me and I headed back. First Mari, then Rene, explained the steps taken to test my tire. In English. Not a damn thing wrong with it. Highly probable a rapscallion LET THE AIR OUT on purpose. (Thanks to whomever for that.) Just in case, Rene replaced the air valve stem.\n\nTen minutes later my tire is plopped back onto my car.

However this location does not deserve your business.\n\nHere was my experience...\n\nI walked in and a small lady was to take my order(mind you, you cannot even see your sandwich being made because they've blocked their sandwich window with a metal cover.) So don't be anticipating seeing if you want more or less of something on your sandwich because they've decided you shouldn't have that privilege.....\n\n--As I was trying to order a man in back was clearly in a argument and raising his voice with someone on the phone. (Found out he was the owner, and that's about as unprofessional as it gets for someone running a business)--\n\nBack to the sandwich... I simply ordered a veggie and cheese. Asked for all the veggies on it but like two things. (They have probably 8-10 toppings.) What I later found out I received: cheese, lettuce, tomato and a couple olives. WHAT?!!?  ......... The owner proceeds to end his argument on the phone to ring up my sandwich, attempts to charge me $2 more for the cheese on it(mind you, the same amount I get at my other location). When I tell him 'no' (instead of honoring it and giving good customer service) he has the lady remove two slices of cheese(that certainly he'll throw away) and takes the $2 charge off! He also tells me that he is going to report the other location I went to for years to CORPORATE because they don't do things the way he does. WHO DOES THAT??\n\n......END RESULT.....\nI received a very empty sandwich at a regular price. Poor service. And a bad energy and taste in my mouth for a place the doesn't deserve your business!!

Applebees is typically our ideal location for nights we plan out, due to their awesome happy hour. We usually go to one particular location but on occasion we will go to this one (44st and Thomas). I've been to this location maybe 8 times. Every single time, we leave incredibly dissatisfied. The food is cold or tastes old. The drinks are always watered down.\n\nThe last time we went was a few weeks ago. My boyfriend had just got off work and wanted to have some drinks after a long day. We decided to go to Applebees, once again, for some food and drinks. Since this location was nearer, we decided to give it a shot.\n\nI ordered the nachos. Because I'm a vegetarian, I ordered it without the chili cheese sauce. How hard is it to get nachos wrong? My boyfriend ordered the two for $11.99 meal and got the blackened steak and chicken parmesan pasta. To drink, I ordered a strawberry daiquiri and he ordered a Dos Equis beer. The drinks sat at the bar for ages as we waited for the waitress to deliver it. By the time we received them, they tasted watered down- even the beer. \n\nFinally our food arrived. The nachos looked great, as did his food. However, looks can be deceiving. Everything about the nachos was disgusting. The cheese (queso blanco sauce) was cold, as if the nachos had been sitting around. The chips tasted old and stale. My boyfriend's steak was tough and very small. And the chicken pasta was cold as well.\n\nThe waitress (I believe her name was Taylor), wasn't very attentive. I don't blame her for the quality of the food, but the service could have been better. When we asked for the check (after I could only manage to eat some of the nachos) my boyfriend decided to inform her about the old taste of the chips. The waitress informed us that we needed to tell her earlier, which was understandable. She went on to explain the old taste could have come from the fact that the fresh batch of chips were just currently being fried, so my batch was most likely older, which obviously did not sit well with me. \n\nWe paid, and even tipped decently (15%), left quietly, and vowed to never ever go there again. We will drive out of our way to go to a different Applebees if need be.", "business_id": "hzUOqxpcnYYBgLlrgvjQYQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-08-16", "type": "review"}

I dunno why I ordered the wings or why I thought that'd be a good idea at a Mexican restaurant.  They were only OK, with no real kick or anything to make them unique in any way. The tacos were great, though.  All I can remember is the caramelized onions going so well with the sweet fish.  It was really a great dish.\nSecond time around I got a carne asada chimichanga.  \nWow.  \nThere was a spinach queso sauce all on top with melted cheese.  I could've put that sauce on the drink coasters and enjoyed myself.  Unbelievably delicious!  The meat in the chimi was seasoned well and quite tender.  It wasn't a crispy chimi due to the smothering of it in that wonderful sauce, but it all came together to make an incredible meal.  Even the beans were good, and I don't like beans.  Oh and their guacamole...so fresh.  I slathered it on top of the chimi and it impossibly made it even better.  This was honestly the best chimichanga I've ever had.\nWe went during happy hour and sat in a happenin' spot with a DJ and all.  Music was loud but varied and he was taking requests.

I ordered the mini chimies. 15 mins later I was greeted with dark brown on a plate and looked like they were fried in 10 day old dirty cooking oil or even possibly \"refried\" (wouldn't surprise me with all the watered down stuff) so because i had other stuff to do I decided not to complain and attempt to eat what they had given me and there are 6 which I ate 3 and I was tapped out on burnt grease...so he gives ME the bill which he watches me pull out my card and pay but when he comes back he hands my card and receipt to my guest.\n\nWell I thought last night was a mistake but it didn't end there.

This place has gone downhill. I used to dine here regularly, but will definitely not go back again as my most recent visit left me irritated and hungry. My family, a coworker and I arrived for an early lunch so the restaurant had plenty of seating. I requested a table below a fan because they keep this place too warm. My daughter requested a high chair for my grandson. These two requests caused such an issue that we ultimately decided to put my grandson on my lap. The server we were seated with was one who had waited on me before and I knew she had a lousy personality, but I opted not to request a different server so not to cause a problem. That was a mistake. When she brought chips & salsa to the table,  1 bowl for 5 people, I requested my own chips & salsa - it's an OCD thing. I was nice about it, but she was rude anyway. Oh well, I chose to ignore it and play with my grandsons. Then time to order...I was trying to get a ground beef taco with the shell the way I like, instead of the way they usually serve it. She was so rude about it that I finally said, \"just ask the kitchen and if they can't do it then let me know.\" She made so many excuses that I'm still not sure which shell I should have requested when they finally changed our server. After all this, my coworker gets a dirty soup spoon. She requests another and ends up with another dirty one. She requests another spoon - again - and my daughter requests one as well. My friend ended up eating her cold soup with a fork - as much as she could. After several more issues I finally go to speak with a manager. While I was gone, the server made a nasty comment about our party to a nearby table . Unbelievable! We get a new server, but still no spoons, who tells us we cannot have the separate checks we requested because the manager took 50% off our bill. The only issue then was that instead of any discount at all, we had been over- charged. At this point my daughter, who never complains, actually went to the manager herself. I was given my remade meal to go - which ended up in the garbage. We ended up with a full comp, but would still never go back.

Bar/banquet manager said he and the server standing next to him loved fox news.  Not sure if they were joking,  but then he said,  we can put it on Sesame Street.

A few Lettuce pieces drenched in white sour sauce. (that I didn't mind being pregnant) Only 4 shrimp.  (I ate one before I realized first picture didn't take.

Um,  maybe before laid on the soup.  more like thin waffle fry chips reduced to soggy mess.

They deliver further than that for a five dollar fee.

I explained the situation to him (Peter) and he said he'd send out another sandwich and apologized for the poor service and incorrect orders.  Guess who delivered it?  Monica!  Apparently she volunteered to drop it off to me.  After handing me the sandwich and telling me to check it, she storms off and says \"Next time, you aren't to talk to me like that\".  No problem, I'll just speak to your manager.  The receptionist heard the entire thing and was on the phone to her manager again.  The manager (this time Jerry) said she bagged my order and Monica volunteered to drive it over herself.  We informed Jerry that it wasn't bagged and Monica just handed us the sandwich.

Marty was incredibly helpful and friendly to little old me who had no clue what to buy for dinner let alone how to prepare it!\n\nMarty chose 3 perfect pieces of halibut, and I could tell he was excited when I asked his opinion on how to prepare it.  I knew I could trust him when he asked me all of the important questions including the following:\n-Who was I cooking for?\n-What was I planning on serving with the fish?\n-How did I plan on cooking the fish?\nI knew I was in good hands when he revealed to me that he has experience as a chef...\n\nSo, I followed Marty's advice, and my brother, BF, and I enjoyed a marvelous, home cooked meal!  We had baked sweet potatoes, asparagus, and halibut... and I know you are curious how I prepared the halibut.  \n\nOk - below is what Marty told me and it came out perfectly!\nI lightly drizzled olive oil onto the fish and put it in the oven on 350 for approximately 8 minutes alongside the asparagus which I drizzled with olive oil and salt also.  While in the oven, I concocted a tomato/calamata olive relish that I put on top of the fish while it baked for the final few minutes.\n\nThe boys enjoyed it immensely.  We had a nice bottle of Cakebread Chardonnay to go along with it.  Perfection!  \n\nThanks again, Marty - you rock!", "business_id": "Mng1FUcW-xRSdsDkowQm2Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-08-05", "type": "review"}

GREAT PIZZA!! there is always 2 to 3 pizza available by slice, but if you call ahead they can make you any specialty pizza you want. Next up is the butchers corner. Fresh seafood, beautiful cuts of meat, and some already done up wings, twice baked potatoes, ribs, the lists goes on. next big section is the booze. A whole wall of specialty beers, rows on fabulous wines and a great aisle of liquor and yummy choices to mix that with. As far as i know, AJs can order anything you want, but they don't have. Keep walking and you will find delicious cheese's and olives. Moving on to the salad bar and you have found lunch!! very fresh lettuces,romaine and mixed greens,  spinish,turkey, chicken. peppers, the list goes on. If its a chili outside AJs always has at least 1 daily soup available. Plus a deli with hot food and every kind of sandwich you want. almost to checkout and you will be stopped by the beautiful display of baked goods. From just a slice of cheesecake, to cookies. Go in before work and you will be taken away by the Illy coffee, and pastries. Enough said.\nPS there are 5-6 rows of specialty barbecue sauces,rubs,anything you want to bake with yadda yadda yadda.", "business_id": "Mng1FUcW-xRSdsDkowQm2Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-08-02", "type": "review"}

They NEVER responded,  and now I can no longer, in good conscience,  shop there because of their apathy.\n\n\"I'm writing, because I had an experience at your store that I just can't stop thinking about. I visited last Sunday, Oct. 30th- close to closing time. As I was checking out, the cashier (a younger man- he looked like he might be of Latino decent) was incredibly polite and professional. However, I had a very negative/offensive experience with another employee of your store that appeared to have just finished her shift and was waiting in line behind me to make a purchase (she was a middle aged woman, with dyed blond hair and heavy eye make-up). As my friend and I were making our purchase, we briefly chatted with the kind cashier. I, in error, went to the wrong place to check out. Your cashier made a friendly comment about how at Costco they have arrows to guide people and that it was an easy mistake for me to go to the wrong spot. It was just friendly rapport. I suppose he was trying to ease my mind in case I felt embarrassed, which I appreciated the gesture. \n\nAnyhow, while he was talking with my friend and myself, the woman interrupts and starts loudly saying to the cashier helping us, and I am QUOTING her, \"Not MY Costco, you live with 'needy' people! You go to the 'needy' people Costco. My Costco is beautiful because there aren't any 'needy' people there. I live in a different city than YOU. I don't live amongst 'needy' people. We're not needy where I live like YOUR city\". \n\nSadly, I am not exaggerating this in anyway. I was completely appalled by the lack of  basic manners. \n\nThis woman is completely unprofessional. Regardless of her personal feelings towards wherever the young man lives or her delusional superiority over \"needy\" people... laughable, since she is working at a grocery store but that's beside the point. I can not believe she would have the audacity to speak to this young man in this manner in front of CUSTOMERS. \n\nDespite her rude, insensitive and unprofessional comments, the young man remained gracious and kind and never said and unkind word or even gave an unkind glance while this woman was attempting to belittle and humiliate him in front of customers. She is lucky that I was too shocked by her behavior to say something at the time, because I am and was completely disgusted. This has left a lasting impression, a negative one to say the least, and I certainly hope that you have a talk with this woman about basic manners and conduct- even if I wasn't present- her behavior is basically harassment and no person should have to deal with such ignorance and insensitivity.\"", "business_id": "Mng1FUcW-xRSdsDkowQm2Q", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-07-04", "type": "review"}

The wedges were also excellent, and as I said, three of them were almost an entire half potato.\n\nBut the chicken was the star. The outer coating was crispy, not as puffy as KFC or other fried chicken, and somewhat reminiscent of home cooked chicken. The inside had more of that roasted taste with very little if any grease. It's like getting rotisserie chicken with a fried coating.\n\nJust writing this review has me considering going to get some broasted tastiness later today.\n\nOh ya, service, etc. It was fine.

We just moved to Anthem from Dallas Texas and were looking for a great pizza/Italian place to eat at, but this is NOT the place.  We entered and there were only two other  dinners in the place, one was a family of 5 and the other was a family of 3, we were a party of 2.  We were seated and told that are waitress would be with us in just a minute.  Well, that minute turned out to be about 10 minutes.  Having had time to read the menu about a dozen times while we waited, when our waitress finally did show up we were ready to order but she ask us if we wanted to put in a drink order?  Really???  So we did put in an order for 2 glasses of wine and asked for water as well.  About 10 minutes later we received our wine (very small pour indeed) and no water?  As we were waiting for our food order (I'll get to that train wreck in just a minute) we noticed that the other two occupied tables were having issues with their orders and all we could hear was the waitress consistently apologizing, we also watch as the other tables food was delivered, ONE freaken plate at a time, first one child got some breadsticks, then about 4 minutes later the other child got a salad, then about 10 minutes later the father got his order, then they apparently asked for water and it was delivered ONE glass at a time by the same server (not waiter???) then we experienced the same absolutely mind numbing food delivery, with the exception that I had ordered the 10\" pizza (which was pretty good after a 20 minuet wait) but my wife had ordered a chicken pasta dish, which we never received.  The waitress brought the pizza and two plates and started to walk away and I ask where my wife's meal was and she looked stunned, walked away and came back and told us that she had turned in the order but the \"kitchen\" must have misread it, but she would re-enter the order, well that was about 2 glasses of wine each and one very small pizza later, which had already taken about 55 minutes....duh!  So we simply told her to cancel the order and we would just pay for the pizza and wine and be happy to leave.  It was one of the worst dinning experiences we have ever had.  The \"manager\" was there, tending a small bar, at which NO ONE was sitting, but he did manage to go and clean the back door glass while all of his customers were waiting for service.  It was a totally dysfunctional, totally unacceptable experience and I doubt that we will ever return, unless my wife bets me that it couldn't possible be that bad on a second visit and I might be willing to accept that \"sure bet\"!!!  Unfortunately in Anthem the dinning options are very limited and even the Legend Sports Bar (well, sort of a sports bar) is failing as it changes management???  I ordered a pizza there last  week and was told after a 15 minute wait that they had no cheese for the pizza because the whole kitchen/management team just weren't ordering any food?  Wow, what a way to make a transition in business ownership!!!

Was I disappointed.   \n\nMy $8 tuna sandwich, straight off the menu, was supposed to come with fancy olives and red onion and came with neither - just tuna and copious arugula on spongy flatbread.  I was surprised, considering they make the same three or four items over and over, and disappointed, since I was craving a richly texured, crunchy construction. The tuna tasted fine - I think they put some lemon in it and maybe there's an olive or two pulverized beyond recognition into the paste - but it's no better than when I open a can of albacore at home and add a little horseradish or curry or what have you and slap some water chestnuts on top - or when I go to Subway and pile black olives, tomato and cheese on a larger, cheaper sub ( on admittedly inferior bread).  The bread here was round and chewy, spongy, but not crunchy at all - reminded me of the bread at Schlotsky's - the whole thing was just kind of flat.  \n\nMy son had the salami and provelone and said it was \"good\". Not great or amazing. Just \"good\".  We spent $21.62 on two smallish sandwiches and creme sodas to go. No sides. Meh.  \n\nThe girls in front were friendly and efficient and the food came out incredibly fast - so quick I wondered if (dare I say it?) my sandwich was PRE-MADE. Mine tasted like it could have been. I dont know if the bread was intended to be warm or not, but after a 10 min drive home, it wasnt.  They use nice heavy paper to wrap up the food and a cute paper \"to-go\" bag with a handle. \n\nThe waiting area is small and there's one (1) metal folding chair for people to sit on. I guess the idea is to walk around and peruse the tiny $16 bottles of imported capers instead, and since it's 110 outside I really wouldnt expect more air conditioned seating from the guy who makes folks wait hours for pizza across town instead of simply taking reservations. \n\nSomeday, I'll come back to try the mozzarella and tomato cuz I still remember how good his cheese tasted a decade earlier, and Chris B's track record has certainly earned him a second chance, but I wont be burning my gas or wallet on return trips this hot summer, based on today's experience.", "business_id": "-AAig9FG0s8gYE4f8GfowQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-07-22", "type": "review"}

Oh, so close!\n\nI've stopped in to Pane Bianco a couple of times and have enoyed the non-commercial sandwiches here.

PB is known for its mozzarella, so I wasn't surprised by its goodness, but I swear the sprig of basil must have been just picked that day...so flavorful and fragant.  It really made the sammy!  The price was about $8.50.  If I would have stopped there, PB would have have five stars.\n\nOn my second visit I had the Market Sandwich (mortadella, peach relish, pecorino and greens).  The mortadella seemed a bit flavorless.  It was sliced thin (which I love) but could have used an extra layer.  It just seemed as though the pecorino (perhaps due to the saltiness) and sweetness of the peach relish (a slight departure from the website description) overpowered the mortadella.  In fact, the sandwich was a bit on the dry side and could have used a bit more of the relish for moisture, especially in light of the fact this type of bread tends to be on the dry side.  The relish really shouldn't be any sweeter as, it too, runs the risk of overpowering the flavor of the meat.  If Chris Bianco can find a way to add greater volume to the relish without adding any additional sweetness, I'd give PB five stars!  Now, if only something can be done about the $11 price tag, this could be an \"A+\" sandwich!\n\nFeel like getting experiemntal at home?  Be sure to grab a freshly baked loaf before you leave.  A bargain at just $3.\n\nMy only real disappointment is that PB isn't open on Sunday.  Hopefully, they'll expand once Lux moves from the space they occupy next door and Pane Bianco will have reason to expand both their space AND their hours of operation.

Having made my pilgrimage to the eponymous pizzeria during my first trip to Phoenix, Pane had been on my radar since the day I moved to town but given the lunch-only hours and my office location in North Scottsdale I knew a weekend would be best and as luck would have it a new website (http://www.pizzeriabianco.com/) and seven day 11a-3p schedule had been rolled out just the week prior.\n\nArriving at the surprisingly large space (especially when compared to Matt's and JoBot from earlier that day - and compared to Pizzeria Bianco as well) shortly after 11:30 and allocating parking in the free lot juxtaposing the Light Rail I debated for a moment whether dine-in or to-go was best and opting for the former made my way into the restaurant where two couples already sat.  Greeted by one of two servers it was suggested I could take \"any seat I wanted\" and opting for a bench in the center of the room where a menu awaited I sat down to browse the menu as well as the daily specials listed on the chalkboard - almost all sounding appealing, but a bit different than the Saturday special listed on the website.  With a small list of beverages available I was asked soon if I was ready to order or if I needed a few minutes I deferred and requested a glass of water that would never reach even half-empty despite me drinking from it consistently and the restaurant soon filling to capacity.\n\nHaving debated the specials but eventually undeterred from the reason I'd come in the first place I soon placed my order for a sandwich and an 'appetizer' which I was told would be 'just a few minutes' and as while I waited I checked out the small market at the Take Away section featuring the famous focaccia, cans of tomatoes, dried pasta, and apparel before returning to my seat where my items would arrive shortly - the first a Manchego and Tomato Sauce Focaccia del Giorno featuring Bianco's delectable wood fired focaccia in all of its spongy glory topped with sweet, ripe tomatoes and an ample layer of briny Manchego; at $4.50 probably the most expensive \"Grandma Slice\" I've ever had yet at the same time also probably the best...or at least on par with that at DiFara in Brooklyn for best of its genre.\n\nMoving next to the original target of my desire, a sandwich of Bianco's House Made Mozzarella, Tomatoes, and Basil on Wood Fired Focaccia my first thought was \"wow - that is a lot of cheese\" while my second, after a bite, was \"wow - that is a lot of flavor.\"  Perhaps as pure of a sandwich as you can find and the result of exquisite ingredients on top quality bread there is really nothing 'special' about the composition of this sandwich aside from the fact that it simply works - a largely unmanipulated masterpiece only improved by a touch of sea salt and cracked black pepper.\n\nLargely unaware on entering that Pane serves dessert it was with much delight that I realized soon after sitting down that three options were available that day and while the flourless chocolate cake I saw emerge from the kitchen to the table next to me looked quite nice there was simply no way I was passing up the Organic Vanilla Bean Rice Pudding with Candied Pecans - another simplistic stunner with creamy Arborio rice imbued with a rich vanilla custard flicked with whole vanilla beans and a few pecans for crunch.  Delicate and smooth, flavorful without being overly sweet, and *almost* thick enough to stand a spoon up straight it was not quite the best rice pudding I've ever had - but a top five contender without a shadow of a doubt - a reason in and of itself to return to Pane Bianco...though to be fair, if I returned it would take pretty spectacular daily specials to prevent me from ordering the exact same trio of items once again.  With Chris and his team now two for two it is only a matter of time before I make my way to Italian Restaurant... and honestly, that time is likely measured in hours and days as opposed to weeks and months.", "business_id": "-AAig9FG0s8gYE4f8GfowQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-08-13", "type": "review"}

Also the sandwich was super big so the 2 if us easily shared and were satisfied. \n\nService from the bartender was very good and polite. I'd love to come back and try more. I'm giving it 5 stars because I know Bianco put a lot of his heart and soul in his businesses and they have never I disappointed me.

Seriously...this is one of the few spots on Central not open late!\n\nI made it at 7-ish, not realizing they closed at 8. I didn't want to be THAT GUY, but staff was definitely still eager to serve a first timer. We kicked off supper with bread and olive oil. Theirs was the best olive oil I've enjoyed on this side of the Atlantic. Delicious, even if the thick, fresh bread was a tad sweet for my taste. \n\nIn mere minutes, I was delightfully presented with the \"Sonny Boy\", a simple pizza with soppressata + kalamata, or in painfully layman terms, pepperoni and olive. I usually hate olives, even kalamata, but these were good. There are limits to any desirable quality in a pizza. We don't want it to be too salty, and surprisingly this was not. We don't want the sauce, crust, or any singular element to overpower another aspect, and for the most part, it was all well balanced. I was able to appreciate it all. \n\nMy only criticism is the cheese itself, which would be refreshing in a caprese or on a white pie, but was just not BOLD enough. It was too milky. Too fatty, even. After doing the most extensive research that has ever gone into a review, perhaps this is from using a more local product rather than the rare Mozarella Di Bufala variety that's hard to get your hands on, but has an unforgettable taste. \n\nIt was so, so close to perfection. Or perhaps I've got some leveling up to do before reaching the status of a true cheese aficionado. Feel free to give your input. \n\nOverall, this is very VERY good pizza, decent bread, and great service. As they closed, they even gave us a complementary loaf to-go.  I was honestly hoping to just grab a sandwich, which I will return to do on the rare occasion I'm not on Central for the nightlife. I wish I could give a 4.5, but since they were nice, a full 5 stars it is. That's what being nice gets ya. =) \n\nPS--I still can't believe my Yelp friends bragged about waiting in line for 3 hours to get a Bianco pie back in the day.

Even though I'm a regular, I've only had the food here a handful of times, so I can't really offer too much insight in that aspect. However, I can tell you that the experience you get at G&D is superb. From the time I first started coming up until now, I've had several different waitresses--all of whom are super friendly and provide great service. Our current waitress, Ashley, have already memorized our regular drink orders. I always get a hot tea with lots of extra lemons and some extra napkins, and she never fails to get all of that to me as soon as we are seated. Trivia nights are amazingly fun. Even though we're a group of young girls competing against 40 or 50-year old men who knows every obscure fact on the face of this planet, it's still great to test your knowledge and learn some random new information you might not have known before. For example, I now have it ingrained in my brain that \"Nights in White Satin\" is by The Moody Blues (as they've asked that question more than a couple times in past trivia nights...).\n\nDavid, the owner of G&D is a great guy who's very personable. He comes around to each table and chats with different groups, and sometimes offers hints to questions if he doesn't consider you to be a \"wanker\" (a term he often uses to call out the really obnoxious customers). He also tells a couple of dirty or \"offensive\" jokes every Thursday, all in good fun!\n\nOne more thing...the bathroom toilet seat covers have the British flag on them! It's pretty cool. Also I heard that the women's bathroom in the back is haunted, but the scariest thing I've ever seen in there so far was only a cockroach, so I'm not sure how accurate that rumor is.\n\nI love G&D because it's not at all pretentious. It's just a comfortable place where you can come hang out, relax, enjoy a few drinks with friends, chat and play games. It's got its little quirks, but that's what I love about it, and when I walk in I feel completely at home. :)", "business_id": "3xEB9FyFXolq1b_Qn_BFtg", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-06-07", "type": "review"}

The menu offers several different beer, wine, and liquor options, from several different regions of the world. Food options are a mix of American, Irish, and British pub type foods.\n\nWe started with the medium hot wing drumettes as an appetizer. They were the right amount of heat level- not too hot, not too mild. The sauce itself was very vinegary and the meat tasted a little on the dry side.\n\nAs for entrees, I decided on the fish and chips, and tried some of the shepherd's pie. The fish and chips came as 2 sizable pieces of battered fillets, with a heap of fries. Although I ordered it with peas, it came with an extra side of coleslaw. The batter was excellent on the fish: A beautiful golden brown, and very crisp. The fish though, tasted dry. The coleslaw was crisp, but had no flavor. \n\nService was somewhat lackluster. Although our server would take away plates, he did not bother to check on our table to refill drinks (Sodas). Even when asked if we could get a refill he forgot to go to our table until we were done with our meal, and by that time it didn't matter to us if we had refills. In addition, it took a long time to get our check.\n\nI wasn't too impressed with the fish and chips, but I did like the shepherd's pie better. The mashed potatoes, ground meat, and veggies meshed well together with the gravy. \n\nWhile I wasn't very impressed with the fish and chips, I'd like to give George and Dragon another shot.

I heard of Estique from a friend of mine. I always admired her hairstyle and, seeing that her hair is similar to mine in texture, I asked her who her stylist was.  I figured since our hair texture was similar, if she was able to give my friend a great cut, then she would be able to do the same for me.  Her stylist was Alicia at Estique.\n\nWhen I came in for my appointment I was immediately greeted and offered a beverage and a tour of the salon.  Interesting, I thought.  It was the first time in my life that I ever got a tour of a salon.  It was nice, but not something I expected. There were some other unexpected, somewhat interesting things, that threw me a bit.  For example, I was offered referral cards with a $20 discount, frequent customer card, menu of services, etc. in a very large, although beautiful, bag.  I thought it was a nice gesture but felt that the bag was a bit much.  IDK...could just be me.  I think I would have preferred that all of the stuff, which were basically various pieces of paper, was given to me tucked into a nice, small, elegant folder that I can just slide into my purse.  \n\nAlicia was awesome and so was her assistant.  I was totally on the mark about her being able to cut my hair in a way that was appropriate for my texture. I am Korean and I have the typical straight, course, thick \"Asian hair.\" I have also discovered that many stylist in PHX do not know how to  properly cut my type of hair.  So, I was thrilled to find that Alicia knew what techniques were best.  Yes, razor please. \n\nI had brought in several pictures of different styles I liked and she helped me decide on one that would work with what I currently had.  She was honest about her opinion and I totally appreciated it.   The cut was one of the best I have gotten in PHX so far, very close to the style that I wanted.  The only difference was that mine was a slightly shorter version since my hair was initially shorter than the length in the picture to begin with.  So, it was to be expected and not anyone's fault.  But I think it will come to look more and more like the style in the photo as my hair grows out. Yay!  You can tell how well a style has been cut by how well it grows out.  If it grows out beautifully, then there was a significant amount of skill and attention involved. I think this will grow out very nicely.  I also appreciated the fact that she finished my cut after blow drying it.  I think dry cutting is one of the best techniques for making sure the hairstyle will look great even without any \"styling.\"  If your stylists needs to do too much to your hair to make it look good after the cut, then you did not get a good cut.\n\nHer assistant was great too.  I received a wonderful head/scalp massage while she washed my hair.  Then, she massaged my arms and hands while I got my hair cut.  Very relaxing.\n\nI also received a follow-up phone call from Adrianne a few days after my visit.  At the time, I was not quite sure if there was a slight problem with my cut. It was slightly asymmetrical; one side being slightly longer and fuller than the other. I'm kind of finicky about my cut and I didn't know if it was just me, but I mentioned it to Adrianne and she promptly made a follow-up appointment for me to see Alicia about the issue I had/possibly had.  She also informed me that they offer all there clients a free follow-up appointment to make any adjustments to their cuts within two weeks of the date of the cut.  Good to know.  But, later I came to the conclusion that it was just me and that the slight asymmetry suited me better, so I canceled my follow-up.  I tried to simulate a more symmetrical style in front of a mirror and realized that it didn't look that good.  LOL.  I guess it makes sense, our faces are not very symmetrical to begin with, so having a symmetrical hair style might not be the best for everyone.    \n\nAll-in-all, I had a great experience with Alicia at Estique.  I will be seeing her again next time I need a cut.  Five stars for a great cut, awesome customer service, and a very reasonable price! I paid a total of $67, which included a $20 tip for Alicia, $10 tip for her assistant, plus a $20 new client discount.  I don't normally tip that extravagantly, but since I got a discount, I figured why not after the great experience I received.\n\nI am definitely looking forward to my next visit!", "business_id": "VAHiEHdVPlG2DVG3YO6C7A", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-07-26", "type": "review"}

I've been going to Salon Estique for almost 15 years now - yes, that includes through college and graduate school, when I lived in other states. I purposefully flew back to go to Salon Estique, that's how great it is! (Don't worry, I also flew back to see family too!)\n\nI've had nearly every service done at Salon Estique, but my favorites are the facials and waxing by Liz or Faye, as well as the haircuts and color.\n\nFor facials and waxing, you cannot do better than either Liz or Faye. Both are excellent, dedicated professionals who will NOT up-sell you on unnecessary products (ladies, you know what I'm talking about). There are several types of facial options available: one for teens, an Express Facial (~45 min.), and a full facial, which is ~90 minutes long.\n\nI've done both, although the full facial is a better deal because not only do you get the facial, but you also get an eyebrow wax for the same price. Taking care of 2 things at once? Yes, please!\n\nLiz and Faye do other types of waxing, which I won't go into detail about here, but let's just say... all the waxing they do is NOT painful, they do NOT re-use sticks (so, no infections or gross things, hooray!), and they're very aware of your pain tolerance and preferences. \n\nAs for haircut and color... I admit, I have had my hair cut and colored at other salons. The haircuts were okay, but no one can color like the Salon Estique ladies. Peggy, Laurie, and Eva are my favorites! They thoroughly listen to what you want, bring over color swatches to make sure you both are on the same page, and they provide ideas if you are unsure. \n\nThe ladies (and gents!) work with your face shape for haircuts, as well as the amount of time you'd like to spend on your hair. I've never been up-sold any products, and everyone I've worked with for hair coloring has always made sure I LOVE my color before I leave. They will re-do it for you if you don't like it! Just say something!\n\nI love how everyone remembers your name here, and everyone on staff checks in with you to make sure everything is okay (ex. when you're waiting for your color to dry - staff checks in, brings you a magazine if you need it, and will bring you refreshments if you request it). Eva and Laurie always give me advice on hairstyles when I'm at a loss, and of course, they're fun and make a long day (I've got long hair--takes a while to color!) go much faster.\n\nMessage me if you have any questions-- as a 15 year customer (and I'm still in my 20s, so that says something!), there's much more about the salon and services that I don't mention here, but that I've had done, and I'd be happy to answer any other questions.", "business_id": "VAHiEHdVPlG2DVG3YO6C7A", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-07-14", "type": "review"}

It was close to home which was a plus. I have been looking for a regular nail salon since we moved from the east valley, my son found this place had great reviews. I scheduled a pedicure online. It was easy. In the notes section requested an earlier day that was not on an option on the calendar. It looks like their online scheduler schedules two days out regardless of their actual appointments. If you want something sooner, I'd recommend calling. A human replied to my request within an hour and offered me an appointment for the next day. I was very happy they could accommodate me- all through email.\nTheir suite is light and bright. It has a great feel even amongst the construction in the bleak, old strip plaza. There's open stations with happy faces getting haircuts, fresh color and new styles. There's a sincere and friendly receptionist offering ice cold refreshments. The music is quietly playing something lively. But nowhere did I see nail stations...? In general the place had a great feel to it. \nI didn't wait more than 5 minutes for my appointment. Meanwhile, I perused the nice selection of Bumble & Bumble products and beautiful handmade jewelry. My nail technician introduced herself, offered me a beverage then led me to a hallway in the back of the building. There was a large overstuffed faux leather chair in the middle of the hallway with a small foot bath bubbling on the floor. The foot bath reminded me of an upgraded version of the ones they sell at big box stores around the Holidays. I was asked to pick a color - from their rather limited selection of choices. About 20 colors. I settled on a peacock green color. The foot bath was surprisingly nice. She left me to soak for a bit and came back to give me a very mediocre pedicure. The results were very equivalent to something I could have done at home. Sadly. I was really hoping for a much better experience. Truly. It's close to my work and home. I wanted this place to be my \"go-to\" place for nails. I was very unimpressed with the afterthought of nail salon that was shoved into the back hallway. \nThe result: My feet didn't feel moisturized and refreshed like they usually do after a pedicure. They felt dry and sticky. I was actually afraid to walk outside as I was fearful the dust in the parking lot would stick to my feet. Oh and it did!  Gross. My nail technician hurried me out of the chair. She didn't even allow time for my nails to dry. So before I even left the building I had smudges on my polish. My heels felt smooth for a day - but not moisturized at all. By the next day my feet were rough and dry more so than before. Pretty equivalent to my home pedicures- meh- I could have done it myself for free and I have twice the selection of nail polish. Usually I can have nice soft feet for at least two weeks after a pedicure at my usual place in Ahwatukee. Not this one. Dry as soon as I left (and sticky)- the next day my rough calluses were back. A week later my heels look really bad. They actually hurt to walk on them. The polish is still on but its smudgy in places. \nBottom line from my experience, this place is NOT a nail salon. If I had hair that could be cut and styled (I have dreads) I'd give them a try for hair services. I have $35 left on my gift card but I will let my son use it for a haircut. I won't be back for nail services. My feet hurt from the cracking and calluses  never again.", "business_id": "VAHiEHdVPlG2DVG3YO6C7A", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-08-08", "type": "review"}

I've done yoga in the past on a regular basis - and those were the times I felt spiritually and physically lighter. \n\nIf you're not familiar with Bikram, he's this Indian yogi who came up with a series of asanas, or poses, which are designed to increase blood flow to all the organs and muscles and tissues. The focus required is very mind clearing. The poses, performed in a 107 or so degree room, are designed to compress and stretch muscles and organs - compressing to push out blood, and stretching to fill them with fresh blood. Your body will eliminate many stored toxins. You'll lose weight and develop better muscle tone and you will feel mentally wonderful. The closest thing i can describe the feeling I have after 90 minutes of Bikram is to being high on drugs. Only you aren't - you've done something wonderful for yourself. \n\nThis particular studio is a Bikram franchise run by a lovely woman named Brooke. She has been practicing Yoga for years and when you meet her you'll see how it's effects radiate outward from her. There's a very inspirational story in an old New Times about her and how she came to do yoga. Literally - it saved her life. \n\nThe studio is at Central and Camelback, near AJ's, way way in the back corner and very easy to miss. Just to to the corner, past the fountain, and look to your left. \n\nAll the instructors are superb - they all have to be officially certified to teach Bikram. The studio is very clean. It is a very comfortable and peaceful environment. The instructors and other students are very friendly. The mens and womens dressing rooms are equipped with showers. You will sweat like you have never sweated before.\n\nThey have all kinds of specials for new members, and a number of different membership types ranging from blocks of classes to unlimited monthly membership. If you're starting out I suggest reading about Bikram Yoga first so you're prepared. Bring water, bring a large towel, bring a small towel. Dress comfortably. Take your shoes off at the door. You can rent a yoga mat if you're just trying it out for a couple dollars. \n\nI've been to a few other studios around town and this one is my absolute favorite.", "business_id": "5EyT-ZbhJR6LwtVaPyE3bg", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-07-07", "type": "review"}

Just kidding, but not really.\n\nThe process of signing in as a first timer was so painlessly simply I thought sure I was skipping something, but nope.  Even as a Groupon customer, there was only a slight upsell mention of how purchasing an additional block of time during the first week would mean a better price than getting it afterwards.  \n\nThe price of 'renting' a towel must be designed to be purposely prohibitive so that they can avoid too much volume with their commercial towel cleaning service, because I don't think $2 is a very fair price at all for what you're getting (NOT getting, just borrowing), and they'd much rather have everyone bring their own towel.  Nice that it's available though.\n\nThe facility is clean and seems spacious from the lobby, but the limited square footage of the studio room itself filled up very quickly with bodies.\nA shower/restroom/not-lockers-but-cubby-holes room is decent, and apparently kept stocked with soap/shampoo by volunteer donations.\n\nTwo instructors on different days gave a similar, but varied class.  Each having a slightly different style, both being competent and thorough in their directions -- I just felt that I could do without hearing about chakras and such related subject matter (i know it's part of the territory, but i think the lack of focus on the spiritual side is why i like joe pilates so much)\n\nThe class itself it pretty butt-kicking.  The advice to sit, but at least stay in the room, is good for when you feel the need to rest.  A newbie surely will need to sit for some of the standing balancing poses.  \nI did, but in only two classes, I showed a marked improvement in that i only sat down twice the second class -- meaning a 3x improvement over the virgin visit!  \n\nMORE NEWBIE ADVICE:\n~drink a lot of water beforehand, and do not eat too much greasy food - you will sweat it out and it will give an odor like french fries, believe me.\n\nwhich brings us to:\n~take a shower IMMEDIATELY prior to class, or as close as possible, because you will sweat about 2.3 buckets, and as the wonderful instructor mentioned, the skin is an organ of elimination and this sweating is about releasing toxins, and toxins are stinky\n\n~sniff your towel first, if you rent one - some of them, although clean, still have a lingering french fry odor permeating the cotton ( i wasn't the only one oozing grease, i guess)\n\n~prepare to be sore.  this is a real workout, not some tai chi, ol' lady smooth flow stretch yoga crap.  put effort into a program like this and you won't need weight training.\n\nI absolutely got a lot out of just these two visits, and plan to detox more during the next 3 weeks.\nConsidering the price of this place (outside of the groupon), I don't think the excessive charges for the towels or the BYOsoap is very appropriate.   That would have to be figured in when I decide if I want to continue with the membership after the initial period expires.\n\nFor now, I'll just keep stinking up my corner of the studio with french fry and chinese food sweat (beer, too!), and hope it doesn't disturb the folks on the neighboring mats all that much by harshing their mellow with fantasies of grease and carbs. \n8^ )\nI love being healthy.", "business_id": "5EyT-ZbhJR6LwtVaPyE3bg", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-08-05", "type": "review"}

I was very apprehensive about trying yoga this \"hardcore\" since I have always used yoga as a gentle/restorative compliment to my running & weightlifting. I loved it. The instructors I had (Kevin, Leah, and Stella) were VERY good at explaining everything and I felt encouraged in each of the poses during the classes. They made a point to learn your name which goes a long way (I think). I think the teachers make the class and I felt encouraged and successful enough to keep coming back (about 3 times a week for a few weeks). Even during the 2nd class, I found myself improving in the poses and it just got better and better. The Friday afternoon 4:30 pm class was packed both times I went , but I wasn't really surprised. The office staff was always very friendly and helpful.\n\nThe only bad thing I noticed (as did other Yelpers on here) is the carpet in the studio. It reeks.

Also, some of the poses have you stand (to start) off of your towel and so....everyone's dripping all over the already nasty carpet...gross. If the class is crowded...even worse.

I laid out my mat, got situated, and relaxed before the class started. Being slightly self conscious I of course started out with my shirt on... that lasted about 3.2 seconds into the workout. Our instructor lead us through all the poses over the 1.5 hour session. She was informative, helpful, and encouraging. As it was my first time, I had no idea what to expect but I can tell you that I didn't expect to sweat THAT much or to have that great of a workout! I felt comfortable just sitting down when I was getting overheated or unable to do a pose and enjoyed watching all of the skill throughout the room.\n\nWhile it sounds like a really unpleasant time (or maybe it doesn't and I'm actually convincing you to try it out) it was seriously one of the most challenging AND relaxing workout I had ever done. You don't need to be super in shape as there were people of all different body types and fitness levels.\n\nI'm excited to go back on a more regular basis when I move closer to the studio.\n\nTip: make sure you bring a LARGE towel to place over your yoga mat.

When I stepped in to the studio it was very obviously unlike any yoga studio I'd been to.  The place is wall-to-wall carpet (gross), even in the practice room (triple gross), and the decor leaves something to be desired.  Determined to live up to my \"I'll Try Anything Once\" mantra, I sucked it up, kicked my sandals aside and made my way into the practice room after a brief tour from the very pleasant desk attendant.\n\nIt was an awesome, life-changing experience!  \n\nIf you're familiar with the world of yoga at all you know that Bikram gets a little bit of a bad rap for some of its rules and techniques.  My perception was that it was very strict, which I suppose it is in some ways, but the instructors quickly dispelled the myth.  I had this image in my head of this super svelte instructor slapping me with a ruler to deepen my experience in trikonasana. This is not at all accurate.  The instructors here are all so genuine,  understanding, helpful (not corrective or punishing as I'd thought) and I always feel like I'm doing a great job, even if I'm not really.  \n\nThe classes are so peaceful and meditative but also physically and mentally challenging.  I find myself relaxed and happy in class and I know a lot of that is due to the instructors and how wonderful they are.  While I'm sure some of the euphoria I felt during the class was due to the 5000 degree temperature, there is something to be said for the collective energy of the other students and the instructors that makes it so amazing.\n\nAs other Yelpers have noted, the smell is something wicked but you get used to it once you start moving around. Take one class and you'll understand the smell and how it is seriously unavoidable! You can't really mark them down for that, it's just the way it is.  \n\nOne word of warning if you're new to Bikram.  I made the unfortunate error of signing up for the Silent Bikram Yoga class as my first.  To me, \"silent\" meant there was no music but I couldn't have been more wrong! SILENT means there's no instruction.  So there I was, slipping around in my own sweat trying to keep my eye on the other students so I could keep up.  Thankfully I've done so much yoga that I knew the poses, I just didn't know the sequence.  Learn from my mistake: do not take the silent class as your first.\n\nAll-in-all, this is a great studio to try out Bikram.  The people are very helpful, the environment is friendly, location is perfect, and they offer lots of classes at times that can accommodate anyone's schedule.  Give it a whirl, if for no other reason than it's the only thing you can do in Phoenix in the summer that makes the weather outside seem \"cold.\"", "business_id": "5EyT-ZbhJR6LwtVaPyE3bg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-07-23", "type": "review"}

There are a few things I totally expected: carpeted floors (not uncommon), sweltering heat (fully expected), and the smell of sweat (you can't avoid it). I'm familiar with the odor that permeates the Bikram studios but the stench at this particular studio was AWFUL! When was the last time they cleaned the carpets? Why are there tiny bugs crawling on the floor? My former studio definitely had a smell but it was nothing like this. \n\nA few other things I was disappointed with - I know people are afraid of the strictness that's associated with Bikram but there are definitely a few \"ground rules\" that I appreciate. This particular studio didn't set those rules and I was really disappointed by that. 1. students new to Bikram were allowed to practice in the front row. When I first started Bikram, I was politely asked to stand at the back of the room so I could learn from someone in the front row with more experience and so my wiggling and moving wouldn't distract everyone else. Now I understand the importance of this. 2. they didn't explain at the start of class the importance of following ONLY the poses that the teacher instructed. Some guy was doing sit-ups?? 3. They didn't ask people to sit silently through class if they were tired. People were walking in and out of the room throughout class. This is NOT one of those easy, relaxing yoga classes that one might expect. It's often referred to as \"Bikram's torture chamber\" and for good reason.  I just want to practice in a studio where everyone has the same goal in mind (to heal the body and to build an energy with everyone else in the room). \n\nWhat I did like about the studio - there was plenty of seating outside the room to relax and prepare your mind for class. The teacher was great. She was calm and encouraging. The class was actually less crowded than some I've been to although I'm sure that won't always be true. And most of the people in class were very respectful and focused which definitely helped the energy.\n\nI bought the LivingSocial deal and so I'll complete my 20 classes but I may try another studio at the end of it. I was really excited to start Bikram in a new city, as I just moved to Phoenix, but I'm just disappointed with my experience at this studio.", "business_id": "5EyT-ZbhJR6LwtVaPyE3bg", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-08-24", "type": "review"}

Being that we all could use a little more exercise in our lives, I bought the coupon and started going to classes.\n\nThe Yoga studio is tucked away in a shopping center off Central and Camelback behind AJ's fine foods, and next to a hair salon.  \n\nThe basis of \"hot\" yoga is to do 26 yoga positions in a room held at 105 degrees with 40% humidity for 90 minutes.  This allows you to flush all the toxins from your body, speeds up your metabolism, reduces stress levels and basically cleanses your whole body while you get a good healthy workout. Intense? Yes, but not impossible.  You will sweat everything out, literally. I admit, like others here, you feel like quitting 15 minutes in because you think your going to die from the heat and your sweaty as hell, but KEEP GOING. IT GETS EASIER/BETTER. I cannot begin to tell you how awesome I felt after my first class. Just amazing!\n\nFor starters, even if your a beginner, like me, do not be intimidated! The class is welcoming to students of ALL levels. I've only been to one other yoga class before in my life, and that was 4 years ago.  Here are a few pointers to help you out and tell you more about the studio itself.\n\nA) drink an enourmous amount of water before, during and after class! Especially  the day before class. The day before drink, drink drink! You will sweat like no other during class, and you need to stay hydrated.  Drink a lot of water after class, as your body is going to be dehydrated and you will be flushing toxins out of your body.  Also, when you bring water to class, make sure its frozen before hand.  If you don't, it'll be warm in 5 minutes and useless.  The studio does sell water bottles, but its like $3 a bottle.  You can go to Circle K and get one for a dollar, throw it in your freezer, and take it to class with you.\n\nB) bring a big towel to put over your mat.  Your going to need it to collect the sweat, and to wipe your face and body periodically during class.  It also allows you not to slip on your mat when you do the standing poses for the first half of class.  The studio does rent towels, but it costs a few bucks. I bring a beach towel with me and it gets soaked by the end of class from sweating!\n\nThe studio itself is spacious, but fills up quickly.  You want to make sure you get a spot where you can see yourself in the mirror while you work out.  It allows you to perfect your poses as the instructor talks you through the class, helps you become more limber and stay focused.  I personally like to sit off to the right side because during class while the instructor is walking through the studio, they will open the doors and you can get a blast of cool air.  This my friends, is the most refreshing thing ever.  Sit off to the side near the door! You will thank me later!\n\nThe instructors themselves are really positive and encouraging.  My first class ever was with this girl Melissa, and she made me feel right at home, explaining everything! Each pose has a benefit for your body, and she (along with the other instructors) will tell you what its for. For example, there's one where you lay on your back and pull your legs to your chest- that's great for digestion, another for reducing anxiety, others for expanding your lungs and so on.  They also tell you to work at your own pace. Don't kill yourself! There's skill levels of all kinds here, and you'll notice it in class. \n\nI would go to classes with my friend Nicolle from work, and we had a blast. Each instructor brings their own personality to class, but you follow the same routine every single time. Some will work you harder then others, but again, go at your own pace.  If you feel like you need a break, lay down on your mat, or do the downward dog position like I do and pick up at the next position after you regain your composure.\n\nThe only downside to the studio is the studio itself smells funky! I wish they would spray some febreeze in here or something, because I think it smells! Aside from that, I really enjoyed my time here, and would love to go back in a heartbeat. Staff was awesome, positive and encouraging.  Plenty of class times available, and a great way to get back in shape.", "business_id": "5EyT-ZbhJR6LwtVaPyE3bg", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-08-24", "type": "review"}

To jump straight into Bikram was a bit scary! And I have to admit the first session was brutal as I kept glancing at the clock and wondering why it was taking so long for 90 minutes to pass!\n\nI have to say it gets better though as you go on, I only managed to go three times I believe and by the three time the class passed by in a whirl as I was already getting the hang of it down!\n\nThe nice thing about this studio is that Bikram is the only thing they offer and their classes are always the same so eventually you can get into a rhythm and know what moves you have coming up without having to glance around the room wondering what everyone is doing next. Not that the direction isn't good, it's great! I experienced three different teachers and each of them was very informative, informing us what the position was called and how to move into it. I just have mild right-left confusion so I had to spy on my classmates to make sure I was doing everything right.\n\nThe thing I liked the most is that these classes attract a variety of people so you don't have to feel like you're the newbie slinking in to a class of yoga masters in great shape. To say that that would have been intimidating is an understatement. They're very encouraging of newcomers and actually the first time we went the instructor overheard we were new and had everyone give us a round of applause for surviving the class. \n\nClasses are available daily at different times to suit those of you who don't work during the day and those who do. There is only one room since there's only one class going at a time but it's spacious and there's room for a lot of people. The room does smell but with everyone sweating in there constantly I'm not too surprised. They provide some sprays to wipe your mat down with after class and the instructor usually hangs out at the front desk if you want to have a quick chat or say thanks. \n\nEven though my coupon is up I can see myself coming back here if I'm ever wanting a Bikram fix. The nice thing is that they have class packages you can purchase through their site that you don't have to worry about using up in a certain time. I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a great Bikram only studio.", "business_id": "5EyT-ZbhJR6LwtVaPyE3bg", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-08-24", "type": "review"}

This is a wonderful deal! So a couple friends and I bought the Groupon and started going. The studio is ok, but has carpet on the floor which I find sort of disgusting. I have heard that this is the way Bikram is 'supposed' to be....but to me, that doesn't seem sanitary. The room had a distinct smell, but it wasn't 'bad,' certainly better than expected due to the carpet and the sweat. The room is large and they cram a lot of people in there. At times, there were more than 50 people in a class (so many that a couple times I got someone else's sweaty foot on my head which made me not thrilled to say the least). I suppose the Hatha or Bikram yoga styles are not really my favorite as I didn't love it at Yogini's and, although it was better here than there, I still didn't love it here. It is a lot more of the spiritual yoga and deep breathing that I know a lot of people love, but it always makes me feel odd. Also, the room at the 5:15 pm class is extremely humid, more so than other hot yoga places I have been to (which actually isn't necessarily a bad thing, but don't go thinking you won't be soaked at the end). Anyway, the teachers and employees of this location were friendly, the bathrooms were small, but clean enough, and they offer a lot of class times which makes it easy to attend around your work schedule. I would go back here if I had a deal of some sort, but I don't think I would pay 17$ a class for it.", "business_id": "5EyT-ZbhJR6LwtVaPyE3bg", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-06-13", "type": "review"}

I waited until the last moment to utilize it, but finally dragged myself to the depths of Phoenix. My dad warned me to bring mace as it's quite tucked in to a little shopping center. To be honest I was a bit scared because the shops nearby are that of pawn shops and a funky little lightbulb shop. The directions on my iPhone were a little funky as this place wasn't popping up. \n\nI walked in and the lady at the front desk was very nice. I said I was new to bikram but had been practicing other forms of yoga for quite some time. She told me where I could put my stuff and that I could buy towels/water. When it came time to enter the class, I felt really lost. I eventually came back to her to ask her to kind of guide me. \n\nThe class smelled awful. I sort of expected that, since you are supposed to have carpet for bikram yoga, but it just smelled like they took 20 football players and stuffed them into a car in AZ without heat and a bowl of garlic shrimp. \n\nI ended up feeling uncomfortable in the class. She singled out the newbies to not do certain poses when I was actually familiar with one of the poses that she told us not to do and was particularly excited to do. But I didn't. She even said my name in front of the entire class and I would have appreciated her coming over to me and quietly talking to me rather than stating my name in front of the whole class. \n\nI will not give up hope though, it was very relaxing. I will just try another teacher. And get used to the stench. \n\nWays it could have been better: Possibly have the room refreshed somehow between classes.\n\nWays it was awesome: The schedule was very flexible.", "business_id": "5EyT-ZbhJR6LwtVaPyE3bg", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-06-25", "type": "review"}

Only one is worth avoiding. 3 I would adjust my schedule to practice with.\n- Great Central location.\n-Friendly staff\n\nCons\n- The hot room needs to have the carpet replaced more frequently. I have practiced at several studios, and this one is just a little \"funkier\" than necessary.\n- Only 1 shower?  You MUST be kidding. The \"locker room\" for women is terrible.  I would prefer to be able to rinse off before leaving.  If there were more showers, I would have the option of practicing and showering before work.\n- I would really like another wall of mirrors, or reflective tint on the wall of windows.  A ballet bar for pre-class stretching would also be great. \n-The hot room is small. Get there EARLY.

The next weekend I decided to take the bike out to some flat dirt and ride for a few miles. About a mile in both tires went flat, as a matter of fact, the front tire \"stem\" completely tore off the tube, leaving me stranded to walk a few miles back to my car.. Gave me time to calm my nerves.\nThe third time I decided to go for a real ride was last weekend in Sedona. I picked a nice basic trail, loaded up on breakfast and rolled out to have some fun. About 40 minutes in to my cruise, I noticed the bike wasn't shifting well. I decided to hop off the bike and visually inspect some things (don't know much about bikes) to see if I could find something wrong, nope! So I kept riding, stuck to switching gears as little as possible, sticking on the flat terrain when I go to switch down a gear to make it easier to pedal and POP! SNAP! BANG BANG BANG BANG!\nI look down, and to my dismay, I see pieces of metal completely sheered off the bike frame (derailleur hanger) with the derailleur stuck in the spokes of the bike, marred up significantly. Thinking to myself now... Well shit, now I'm stuck in the desert, 4 miles in on this trail, now I have to carry my bike back. In order to roll my bike back I had to remove the back tire and sort of drape the chain around my pedal. When I finally got back to the car, to my dismay realized the chain had married up the crank so badly it was more silver than it was it's nice original black color.\nNow I'm back in Phx, drive done, called the bike shop (Slippery Pig), they informed me to bring the bike in. The distance from my work to home to the bike shop is significant, and after stewing over the fact I just dropped almost $800.00 on a bike that ultimately failed on me, I was not inclined to return quickly, therefor I contacted Cannondale.\nCannondale referred me to another bike shop (Biker's Edge) in Peoria, much closer to home, that was and still is a licensed Cannondale repair shop. After chatting with them over the phone, very nice people by the way, I brought my bike down for a full inspection. According to the technicians at Biker's Edge, the bike was not shifting correctly because it had not been adjusted properly, an adjustment that should've been made before I was sold the bike at Slippery Pig. They continued on with saying that things like this \"just don't happen\", and that \"they happen so infrequently for basic riders there is no need to carry spare derailleurs\" because \"they just don't break\".\nAt this point, I am disheartened and filled with anger towards Slippery Pig for selling me a bike that was adjusted incorrectly from the beginning leading to an incredible amount of damage (haven't seen my bike in two weeks), and had two faulty tires that blew out the first time I road (front tire was on backwards according to tire tread writing). Needless to say, Biker's Edge got the hanger replaced when they noticed some additional parts that make up the actual derailleur were loose. The parts total was about $45.00 plus $15.00 to put them on plus another $30.00 to work on the chain and cover the exorbitant amount of scratches with magic marker(not kidding), total costs ending up at $90.00. Before I moved forward with the additional repairs aside from the hanger, I decided to contact Slippery Pig to see if they could do anything for me. According to the staff at the Slippery Pig, they will cover the $20 additional part that needs replaced if I pay $10 for labor, that's all, and a sorry (which doesn't really help).\nTakeaway from this:\nI would not recommend purchasing a used bike from the Slippery Pig bike shop, nor rely on their maintenance/shop services on your personal bike. Based on my own personal experience, I have found their services to be VERY poor (except for a very nice gentlemen that went out of his way that tried to get me assistance, his name was Troy).\n\nHowever, Biker's Edge in Peoria, AZ is an incredible, Cannondale certified bike shop run by a staff of 3 people, all whom are extremely knowledge, communicate effectively, establish and resolve issues deadlines efficiently, and most importantly, they devote their attention all on you when you call for help, it's a bike shop that truly cares and isn't just worried about making sales.\n\nOut the door, $130.00 for repairs. Needed a derailleur hanger, new derailleur pulleys, brakes readjusted (overfilled) and a brand new chain because the chain was a link too short causing shift issues.", "business_id": "42Ai9wcFPE2HZ_aADGXI9Q", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-08-20", "type": "review"}

However, I was mostly pleasantly surprised, a feat which isn't hard since the bar was set somewhere below sea level.   I had a bacon, egg and cheese sandwich.

I was surprised that they had finally gotten rid of that name and changed the signage to The Good Egg (not sure if this is recent or not, I haven't been down this part of Camelback in a bit of time).  Upon seeing the new signage, I thought perhaps there would be a better experience to be had.... no, nope, not at all.\n\nI met my party that was already seated in the WAAAAAAY outdated restaurant... I mean seriously people, the bakery cases that haven't been used in decades, the wood, the wallpaper, the metal chairs, and all the BRASS... oh my goodness all the brass....YUCK!..... Give this place a little attention Good Egg.\n\nWhen I sat down I found half of the table wet and no napkins, a little puzzled I asked what the deal was.  Apparently the waiter had spilled the water all over the table and used our napkins to try and wipe it up.... I repeat TRY to clean it up, he didn't succeed. Perhaps if he had went to get a towel he could of gotten all the water up, but apparently he never did (as this happened 10 min. before I got there and there was still puddles all over the table.  Nor did he come back with fresh napkins...nice buddy, nice.\n\nAfter being there for about 5 minutes the guy came to ask if I wanted anything to drink... Coffee and cream please. And walks away before we can say that we are ready to order... Now I am the ding dong who was a half hour late because my ass slept in, so friends were huunnngggry.....He comes back with coffee (lukewarm at best), no cream, and walks away...AGAIN.  We sit, and sit, and sit.  He finally comes and ask if we are ready to order, umm.. we had been there 45 minutes and 15 minutes...yeah, I think we've got it.   We order and remind him again of the cream and napkins.\n\nHe comes back with cream, no napkins.  sigh.\n\nFood finally comes, order is right, but haphazardly prepared.  Maybe the kitchen guy overslept too?  \n\nI have the Monterrey, it is missing tomatoes and you can tell that it was almost forgotten about because the eggs were starting to brown, my english muffin is nearly burnt and looks like it was toasted on a grill that needs some scrubbing, the cook compensated by soaking it in butter. Dollar Pancakes were shaped like road kill, and the side plate they came on was placed on my main plate.  That's no big deal, I don't care.  But as I am going fork to plate the server takes the side plate off the main plate...umm...eew, don't touch my food once it has hit the table.  I worked my way through high school and college waiting tables, I have a high tolerance for eew, but some things just bug me right away... this is one of them.  Dude, if you touch my food while it is in the kitchen, ignorance is bliss, but if you do it in front of me once the food is ON THE TABLE for goodness sake then that shit just be NASTY yo!  I know damn well there is a good chance your hands aren't clean.  Practically no food workers wash their hands as much as they are supposed to unless the health inspector is there....sorry people, its true.\n\nFriend 1 had an even more crispy looking omelet.  Friend 2 got a turkey sandwich.  It was dry, and lacking in well... turkey! It looked as if they had folded up one piece of lunch meat to make it look more substantial.  Her salad was pretty lame looking and had the runniest ranch dressing I had ever seen.  What was even worse is that there was one sad runaway strawberry in her sandwich... wtf? Check your cold storage bins people!  If Friend 1 had been the one to order the sandwich instead of Friend 2 then I wouldn't be writing this review right now because I would be supporting Friend 1 in the HOSPITAL!! Friend 1 has a major strawberry allergy.  i understand shit happens, but how does a STRAWBERRY get put on a TURKEY sandwich and the cook doesn't notice?!??!!!\n\nWe could of said something if our server wasn't practicing his disappearing act again. Only time we saw him after he dropped off the food was when he dropped the check, and kindly paused out of his busy day to say \"Everything ok?\" ...kind of waited for a response and walked away.. no \"thank you\" \"have a good day\" \"come again\" \"bugger off\" nothing....  Mind you I use the word \"busy\" lightly, there was about 6 tables in the whole place full at 10am, and at least 4 other servers that I saw.\n\n\nThis was the third time I had been to this location... shitty experience as always, you know what that means people.... three strikes you're out!

In the case of Fry's, they typically ignore you when you come to the window, take 40-minutes to fill any prescription - even something that's in a box and all they have to do is pull it off the shelf. I've even had them take 40-minutes and then tell me that they were out of the medicine and I needed to go to another store.\n\nEnough about Fry's - eventually I'll write a review of them - and back to today's tremendous experience at Walgreen's.\n\nBecause my in-law's are currently out of town, I agreed to pick up a prescription for my wife's grandmother and deliver it to her nursing home. My mother-in-law told me that I could just go through the drive-through and get it. Unfortunately, when I got there it turned out the refill had never been ordered. \n\nLuckily, the pharmacist looked in the computer, determined the needed medication, put in the refill and told me it would be ready in 20-minutes.\n\nI took my kids to run another errand and then came back to the store. When we came back to the drive-through, the first pharmacist still couldn't find the prescription in the system. However, instead of giving me the brush-off, as the would have at Fry's, she went and found the pharmacist I had talked with 20-minutes earlier. As it so happened, that pharmacist was in the midst of filling the prescription and they had the medication to me in less than 5-minutes.\n\nDespite the fact that Fry's is just around the corner, I may be transferring the family prescriptions to Walgreen's.

If you are (were) like me and had no idea how it works or if it's legit, here you go:\n\nAbout once a year I find myself in need of minor medical attention and without a primary care physician. I usually skirt the issue by having plenty of family in the medical profession that can call me in a prescription for whatever ailment I have self-diagnosed (ear infection, sinus infection, worse than usual allergies, etc.) \n\nIt's not that I wouldn't love a primary care physician to call my own - he would be old, gentle and white haired (not hasty, distracted, a bad listener or curt, like most doctors). But I am a generally healthy procrastinator, so when I had a cold that I suspected was turning into a sinus infection, I couldn't wait three weeks to six months for an opening at an office -- that is, of course, if they're accepting new patients at all. \n\nSo this Walgreens business - though strange, I admit - appealed to my urgency. It's an urgent care, basically, with a nurse practitioner on staff at more reasonable hours than a doctor's office, slightly less convenient hours than an ER or UC. It seems like a good bet when you pretty much already know what's wrong and you just need the appropriate signature to get the drugs you need to get better faster.\nI called to make sure they took my insurance and was told the copayment would be the same as a specialist. The deal is you walk in - no appointments, ever - and sign yourself in at the kiosk. Basic info only: name, number, zip, and check from list of typical maladies and then it gives you a wait time. In my case - 1 hour, 20 minutes. So at this point I'm at the same wait and cost as Urgent Care. Bummer.\nLuckily I work just across the street, so go back to the office for an hour and come back. Of course, my name was called while I was gone. So I re-enter at the kiosk (frustrating that there is no actual person to address concerns) and am given no wait time this go round. So I just sit and wait. About 10 minutes later the nurse emerges and bc there was no one ahead of me this time, I'm taken to a back room where we go thru the rigmarole that front desk admin usually takes care of before hand, so that took another 10 minutes.\nWe finally get to the medical assessment, which was taking my temp., checking my lungs and heartbeat and looking in my ears, nose and throat. That took about three minutes and my self diagnosis was confirmed. She entered my prescriptions into the computer which is automatically sent right out to the pharmacy outside and I'm done. Oh, turns out my copay was less than I was told, which was nice. (If you don't have insurance it's like $70 - yowza!)\n\nAll in all, it was convenient in a pinch and got my drugs same day. The nurse was nice enough. But I'll still put \"find a primary care physician\" on my to-do list.\n\nAlso, as someone noted, this location attracts a lot of crazies and weirdos - perhaps bc of its proximity to the LR station and Central Ave in general.", "business_id": "HfWkdqxegjiGEXzI8j7Wwg", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-08-25", "type": "review"}

The pharmacy can be EXTREMELY SLOWWWW. Especially if you come here at night since they are located near the hospitals so there is usually a small line of people filling prescriptions. \nI had one experience probably 6 months ago where I decided to go inside the store one night so I could pick up a soda or something with my prescription. There were maybe 3 or 4 people in line in front of me. I waited in line for over half an hour. During this time, any car that went through the drive thru was being served more promptly than the people standing there in line. When I finally got to the counter, the staff member was very apologetic that I had to wait so long, although I know it was not her fault, they were just severely understaffed. \nI do have to say though, that in recent months, they have been more efficient with their operations whenever I have come through here.", "business_id": "HfWkdqxegjiGEXzI8j7Wwg", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-07-29", "type": "review"}

I'll try to be as detailed as possible, as this review may be used in court one day. First, let me say I have a chronic condition and I am a polite and easy-to-get-along-with \"regular\" of this pharmacy. I've never had an issue before tonight. Efran, who I normally deal with in the pharmacy, is a great guy- super friendly and always smiling. Monica, the manager, was very responsive and polite when I called her tonight. Hopefully, she will resolve the pharmacist's problem.\n\nHowever:\n\nI badly injured my finger and it became infected. It is swollen to triple size and a doctor had to slice it open today to drain the puss. The doctor used zero anesthetic, but he had good reason. That's another story.\n\nSo he gave me a prescription for 15 Vicodin and 20 antibiotics. I wasn't picking up 200 Oxycontin tablets or doing anything weird. It was a small amount of pain pills and antibiotics to match. My injury was also very visible on my right hand.\n\nI was asked for ID, which is understandable, because I was picking up a regulated narcotic. I get that.\n\nSo I hand the pharmacist a government issued photo ID. The government ID had a matching address to my prescription. In addition to that, I had an ASU student ID, a credit card (that I was paying for the prescriptions with), and my insurance card ...and I also had a visible injury. A visibly infected injury on my hand, and I was picking up the exact prescription that would match the physical evidence.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that it was crystal clear that I was who I claimed to be.\n\nHowever, the photo ID that I showed was unique. Only certain people get to carry it. I am not saying my ID was a green card (and I'm not saying it wasn't), but a green card would be an example of a government photo ID that is not commonly shown.\n\nBut if you are visiting from a foreign country, for example, and you are here legally, you should be able to get prescriptions that you need. I know that Arizonans aren't fond of illegal aliens, but people that are here legally should be able to get medication if they are sick.\n\nNot at this Walgreens. The pharmacist declared, in front of witnesses, that they won't serve everyone. If you are visiting this country, go elsewhere. The pharmacist at this Walgreens will not help you.\n\nUpon inspecting my government issued, legal photo ID (that the bank accepts by the way), the pharmacist said, \"I'll take it this time, but next time, you'll need an ID from the DMV.\"\n\nFrom the DMV! Can you believe it? She actually said \"from the DMV.\" \n\nI said: \"That's a legal government-issued photo ID. You can't deny me.\"\n\nShe then arrogantly proclaimed: \"I am the pharmacist and that is our policy! We need an ID from the DMV!\"\n\nI protested, because, since I don't drive, just going to the DMV is a tremendous pain in the butt. And what law says that you need DMV ID? Who says that you are required to visit the DMV ever? As far as I know, you just need to be able to prove that you are here legally. My ID proved I was here legally. And again, it was government issued photo ID.\n\nUpon me protesting, she snatched my prescriptions from the cashier (all on videotape) and said, \"Then I won't give them to you if you want to argue!\"\n\nOkay, so this girl has a power-struggle issue. I get it. \n\nI'm in agony, and I know when I am dealing with a nut-job, so I satisfied her narcissism and agreed that yes, she was the pharmacist and no, my ID wasn't good enough. And she handed me my prescriptions. Thank God. You see, it was never about the ID. Otherwise, I wouldn't have my Vicodin right now. It was about exerting control over a customer. A regular customer that has spent over a thousand dollars in that store, in 2012.\n\nShe actually held pain medication over my head, until I agreed to her illegal, discriminatory policy.\n\nSo, in a state of duress, desperate, I relented. I said, \"Okay. I agree.\" (clenching my teeth in agony)\n\nAs I was walking out, I turned to her and said, \"I am now going to write a review online.\"\n\nShe replied: \"Good! Go ahead. And now we will never serve you again.\" She went over to the computer and publicly announced that she will make a note on my account and that I can't get prescriptions from there anymore. Again, humiliating me in public.\n\nAnd what did I do? Absolutely nothing. I did nothing wrong. I never even swore or called her a bad name. All on videotape.\n\nI am contacting an attorney first thing Monday morning. Good luck Walgreens.", "business_id": "HfWkdqxegjiGEXzI8j7Wwg", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-06-29", "type": "review"}

I was than greeted by someone (I have no idea if he was a doctor, a nurse or the receptionist). This person never introduced himself, walked me into a room with someone else's stuff. He was a young guy in his 20s with clearly very little professional experience. When I told him I wanted a physical, he let out a big sigh as if I was causing him an inconvenience. He asked me why I hasn't filled out paperwork (which were nowhere to be seen) and grabbed the papers I had brought (for the physical). He stared at the papers and  looked at them as if they were written in a foreign language. He let out another sigh. It was at this point that he wanted to start the exam, but it was also at this point that I decided I wasn't comfortable with this person ( who was frazzled, unprofessional and still hadn't introduced himself to me).

The staff who used to be nice are long gone, replaced by kids who think it's funny to allow line jumpers and staff who move at the speed of slow and look resentful at doing their jobs.\n\nPrices are up dramatically, while the fresh fruit is gone, many of the fresh foods are gone, the housewares section has lost its verve. You can still get bargains in the beauty section, but otherwise you will be paying through the nose for convenience (plus the privilege of being treated rudely).\n\nQuality has also generally declined. The house brand cat litter, which used to be great, is now as useless as beach sand and exists solely so you remember how the box stank all week and pay double the going rate for Tidy Cat. The $15 rayon dresses -- wonderful for summer around the house -- are now so skimpy that I can barely get my arms through the arm holes (they used to err the other direction). \n\nAs the place has declined, the clientele has gotten sketchier, too.

I was in Class of 2009\nThe good:\nI got the best education you can get in this city, the school has great teachers that are reasonable, and understanding and actually become your friends. If you are struggling there are many people you can go to for help. I would HIGHLY recommend taking honors classes; the coursework is the same as the non hrns courses without being AP level and you get better teachers. The coursework was very light compared to my grade school, teachers are understanding and will work with you if you need help, they understand that you have football/robotics/job and will work with you so you can achieve a good grade. Freshmen year is made hardest for a reason, the drop rate is high to get rid of lazy misguided students, I have never seen anyone leave because of excessive course load. \n\nThere's many many clubs on campus, I would recommend the robotics club for anyone's that's looking to go into engineering , I was president synr yr, we had 30 members had over 20K of sponsorship money, engineering mentors and we traveled out of state to Las Vegas for competition, no cost paid by club members. \n\nStudents range from the typical rich parented white east-sider driving a new BMW bought and insured by mommy-daddy to the poorest poor smart-driven Mexican American living in the south west valley taking the bus to school! I loved the eclectic mix of people! \n\nThe buildings are mostly new and extremely well designed, and the old ones are nostalgic and cool. Their rooms are up to date, technology filled and awesome! \n\nBeing in an all boys school THERE'S NO DRAMA which is really nice! You get to focus on hanging out with your friends, SCHOOL and having a really good time!  The all girls' school Xavier is only a block away, it's not hard to hang with girls at all!\n\nParking for students is good, you need to carpool one other person and pay ~$25 for a permit. \n\nThe atmosphere is really relaxed (chill), teachers are not strict, and some will even let you chill on their own classroom couches during class (paying attention of course).\n\nI was the last class year without the \"laptops\" so I can't vouch for what it's like to have one, but every student now has a swivel touchscreen laptop which they take notes on, have textbooks on and do their homework with. You can goof around on the laptop during class or take notes; the final decision is up to you and the grade you wish to revive. \n\nThe bad:\nThe management has replaced the school run \"corral\" with the HORRID Michaels catering service in the \"new\" great hall, which serves much, much more expensive, less tasteful and less filling meals. \n\nThe cost is excessive, around 11k a yr! But there's plenty of financial aid for the family with limited income, single parents and many other reasons.  If your parents can't make tuition payments, the schools has a work study program so you can WORK for your education, it's not that hard to do.

They have always made any dish that I have asked for if they didn't have it ready without unreasonable delay. Today I had my favorite made fresh for lunch in about 10 minutes, and I had enough to enjoy for dinner too. \n\nJust so you know, I have absolutely no affiliation to Fusilli's, just a big fan!", "business_id": "OkXpdUozVS3vjSRtCoSIvw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-06-27", "type": "review"}

Unfortunately, I went through the motions of ordering, waiting, paying (in that order), before I reached to my Droid and asked what it thought. The two stars should tell you everything. The pizza I had didn't taste bad it was just flavorless and boring with not enough toppings. It also cost more than it should. I never order a drink, so when my tab came close to 7 bucks for two slices of less than mediocre pie, I was shocked. The staff was friendly, I mean at least they smiled. So for that they get an extra star. With limited choices for lunch in a mall with a large corporate business presence it looks like Fusilli's has gotten by by offering options not quality.

We both order the same meal, steak and shrimp with broccoli. My girlfriend asked to substitute the broccoli with mushrooms and add grilled onions. I want to add more shrimp to my order.

She takes it out and it looks like a piece of toilet paper or some kind of white paper. (We had brown paper napkins only, not a single white napkin or paper on the table.) The bad part is, this was one of her last bites and didn't think of returning the food at that point.

That dilemma is: How authentic are we going to make this restaurant? Basically, this question is answered by looking at the bottom line. If you are in an area with a relatively low conentration of that ethnicity then in order for your business to stay alive, you need to cater to the tastes of the local majority. The beauty of China Chili is that they walk this line and do it successfully. Restaurants that lean towards authenticity typically tend to alienate the majority of people because its simply intimidating. On the other side, a restaurant that caters to American tastes is hated on for the watered down ethnic experience. What China Chili has managed to do is make Chinese food accessible to the demographic around them. The Asian population in the Phoenix metro area is concentrated in the East Valley and Northwest Valley. There are very few Chinese downtown and that is shown by the lack of Chinese restaurants in the downtown area. China Chili has understood this and has beautifully adapted their menu to reflect the area they are in. In response to the people who commented on the lack of authenticity of the food here, I would say that I agree with that in part. However, being Chinese, I know that if you go into any Chinese restaurant that has Chinese people working there and you ask them, you'll find that there are additional items that the kitchen can make for people who are looking for that authentic experience. China Chili is no different. Just ask for something more authentic and in most cases they can tell you what they have available. I can tell you from first hand experience that they have ALL Chinese cooks in the kitchen. Its not like they don't know how to make authentic Chinese food, but like any good restaurant, they know their audience. \n\nNow to the food. Most of the things on the menu are pretty tasty. One thing that they do that most other places don't is tailor the food to your exact specifications. They can make it spicy, or less spicy, or omit veggies, msg, meat, or add basically anything you want. Some favorites of mines are the House Special Chicken, Salt and Pepper Pork Chops, Chicken Corn Chowder, and Spicy Garlic Eggplant. During lunch, they serve hearty lunch specials that after make you wish you were going to nap time rather than work(to some that may be synonymous). They have even more dishes that they can make for lunch specials than the ones they have listed so make sure you ask. \n\nAs for the decor....lets be honest. Chinese decor is tacky. I'm Chinese, I admit it. If the decor of a restaurant causes you to not eat there, then sadly you have probably missed the most amazing meals of your life because some of the biggest holes create some of the tastiest food. Its not dirty or messy, its just tacky, so please get over it. The Chinese are prone to gaudy, extravagant presentations, or did you miss the opening ceremonies of the Olympics?\n\nIn any case, I love China Chili because it allows people who would never walk into a more authentic Chinese restaurant to put a foot in the door of an enormous culinary world. And at China Chili they can venture in as far as they would want. .", "business_id": "-3WVw1TNQbPBzaKCaQQ1AQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-08-18", "type": "review"}

The key to China Chili is taking the exotic route, ordering that item you wouldn't normally order, shooting at a risk.

There was none of that resistance crap. That food was in my belly fast! The pillow chicken was chicken mixed with onion, bamboo shoot and I believe something else and breaded into little pillow sized wonder. It was laid on top of steamed broccoli and then covered in a black pepper sauce. I wish it was spiced with something more than pepper, but other than that I have no complaints. It was so filling (in the good way, not the I'm gonna get sick way like most Chinese I have) I was only able to eat half. \n\nI loved the huge round tables in the center with the lazy susans.

I started working on Central and Indian School just around the time China Chili closed prior to the lightrail construction, so my first experience was at the new place.  I wish had gotten the opportunity to eat at the original location just to see if the experience was any better.\n\nI have ordered two things at China Chili: the orange chicken and the sesame chicken.  I only order the former now.  I have never had to wait longer than five minutes for an order.  This is good yet slightly unnerving.  It makes me feel as though everything is ready-to-serve in the back, even though the freshness and temperature of the food says otherwise.  The orange chicken is out of this world.  An entire breast fillet is battered, deep-fried, sliced, and covered with a really delicious orange sauce.  If you ask for it extra spicy, be prepared to feel your face melt off.  The consistency of the heat level is a bit hit-or-miss, but when they get it right, you'll be simultaneously pleased and in pain.\n\nMy biggest beef with this place is the wait staff.  Very rarely is service pleasant.  Most of the waitresses are brusque and a bit too efficient for my liking.  When the dining room isn't full, they tend to huddle up near the kitchen and watch the patrons as they eat, usually talking quietly amongst themselves.  It is quite unsettling and makes me feel as though I'm not welcome.  The one exception is one of the very sweet older women who reminds me a bit of my grandma in that she always has a smile and is always so quick to ask if I need a refill.  I don't know her name, but I always hope she's there when I go.\n\nSo, visit China Chili when you're in a hurry and craving the best darn orange chicken you'll ever have.

The best part is the food is relatively inexpensive, our meal was $32 for the 3 of us, you can't go wrong with that.", "business_id": "-3WVw1TNQbPBzaKCaQQ1AQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-06-23", "type": "review"}

It has been a staple for us going back 15 years to their location on Central. We have visitors from SF, Vancouver, NY, LA who are consistently amazed to find Chinese food of this quality in Phoenix. Even if they are the best of Phoenix on a good day, they are not rivals for the 5 stars in those towns though. \nHere's a few tips for getting the most out of China Chile. Don't do take out. Always get a soup, hot n sour is our favorite. Chicken Salad is special. They never miss on spring rolls and pot stickers. Honey walnut prawns get my luv one Jonesing to go there. Orange chicken and orange beef have not disappointed. Noodles have. Chow fun or chow mein should be on your order. They do shell fish superbly, especially scallops. Whole fish is a mixed bag some great, some not so. The pork chops and chashu are a bit dry for my taste. Special menus on the whole have been disappointing. It's boom or bust, but if they offer seared beef tenderloin take the risk. One night I'm raving to fiends about how good it is, at the same time a guy at an adjacent table is complaining to the manager about the very same dish. That's China Chile.", "business_id": "-3WVw1TNQbPBzaKCaQQ1AQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-06-07", "type": "review"}

True, their appetizers are decent and the Hot and Sour soup tasty.  But the main dishes we had -- Garlic Eggplant and a half duck -- both very highly recommended by other reviewers, were mediocre at best.  I suspect most Americans wouldn't know \"real\" Chinese if they saw it  and this restaurant perpetuates the myth, that what they serve is actual Chinese food  (after bringing a friend to a Chinese restaurant off of Northern (Wahsun), which makes real Chinese food, he was shocked to taste what real Chinese food is).  Most of the dishes at China Chili are overly salty and/or sweet  (to be fair though, as a diabetic, I usually avoid both, so I might be overly sensitive on that point).  The service is indeed excellent and friendly.  My biggest complaint was the party of 15 Latinos sitting next to us celebrating a birthday, who apparently think it's okay to have screaming children ruin everyone else's night.  But that's not the restaurant's fault, since machine gunning guests is (still) illegal and there was nothing they could do about it.\n\nIn summary, the food here is okay, with the appetizers being their strong suit.  I've tasted much better in the Valley and don't really think this place deserves all the hype it gets.  Then again, there ARE a lot worse Chinese restaurants out here, so this may be your best bet.  It doesn't hurt either, that they're open till 10pm; a remarkable exception in a city, where the norm is to close at 8pm or 9, even on weekends and which, of course, is ridiculous for a \"major\" city.\n\nI truly recommend \"Wahsun\" in Phoenix, if you want to try real Chinese food.  I think most people would be surprised to discover how very different it is from what they're used to.  The food takes some getting used to, but once you get into it, you'll never go back to China Chili or their colleagues.", "business_id": "-3WVw1TNQbPBzaKCaQQ1AQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-07-08", "type": "review"}

Some of the guys also had beers and sake.  I can't think of one dish that I did not like.  This place does NOT disappoint.

When we walked in, we noticed the restaurant was much larger than it appeared from the outside & was pretty busy - a good first sign.\n\nWe were promptly seated & brought our drinks. We ordered the Fried Golden Prawns for an appetizer and the Chicken in Phoenix Nest & Sesame Chicken for our meal. The prawns were good but nothing special. There were sweet & sour and horseradish sauces on the table which were the only reason that the prawns had any taste. As for our meal, the Chicken in Phoenix Nest was in an interesting tasting sauce - the first couple of bites were good but left a weird after taste. I only ate 3 or 4 bites. The Sesame Chicken was the same way. I understand that it's a different preparation than the sweet American version but this plate just had a bunch of slices of fried chicken with a gravy tasting sauce poured on top. I only ended up eating about 4 or 5 bites of this as well & was done.\n\nAdditionally, one of the things we noticed was that our waiter was really nice. We had a few questions about the menu & he was more than happy and nice, answered everything. Some of the ladies who were waitresses there, however, were not friendly. They glared at people when walking around picking up plates & dropping off meals. It was a little un-comforting / intimidating to get these looks while eating.

The boiled wanton soup is so good! You must try the boiled wanton and its spicy, peanut goodness! This is great shared before your meal. The Honey Walnut Prawns here are amongst the best I've ever had. The orange chicken is overly fried, pick around the fried chicken and enjoy a mildly spicy orange sauce. The Mongolian Beef is also a favorite. The restaurant does use an abundant amount of onion scallions, I often ask to omit them.

I preferred to use cash, so I stopped by to settle the bill that weekend.  Huge shop plus: Shop Cat!  This black and white sweet little thing stole my heart and the florist had her eye on me to make sure I didn't steal him.  He sat on my shoulder as I paid my bill, and I reluctantly returned him to a nearby stool.  My third encounter was when I picked up the flowers, ready right on time as promised.  I had a ton of carnations, some green trix, buplerum, and a few hydrangeas.  Shop Cat again proved to be the highlight of the experience, but the service was great as well.  She sold me a stem-ripper (to remove thorns and leaves) even though I hadn't purchased the roses from her.  \n\nAll of the flowers held up marvelously, with the exception of a few user-error calamities.  We trimmed and arranged everything in my centerpieces with a little water, and stashed them in a cool (but not cold) spare room so they would wake up.  The next morning, we used plant food in the water to top off the water levels.  Day 3 was go time, and they all looked perfect - healthy, full, colorful, and beautiful.\n\nGoing in to the \"I'll do my own wedding flowers\" plan, I knew there were several details that could make or break the experience.

The menu has gotten a whole lot bigger since then but it was nice to see they still have a lot of the classics.

In my experience the employees here have not necessarily been rude, but just unpleasant. The pleasantries go a long way with costumer satisfaction. I have already mentioned how I feel about the smoothie menu above and now its time to tackle the baked goods. Wow. These are just plan bad.

Try as I may, I just can't get excited about it. \n\nAAB&C has everything a good comic store should have; in-depth yet intuitive store lay-out, boxes upon boxes of back issues, nice tidy displays of action figures and busts, a big sign on the front of the store  professing their accolades...\n\nAnd that's it.\n\nThere's no playing or reading space of any kind. No television. The radio usually plays smooth jazz or some other music substitute.\n\nAnd unless you're willing to strike up a conversation with the guy in the Amoeba Music t-shirt who so looks like he's already judged your worth as a person by the time you've made it to the graphic novels section, there's really no one to strike up any conversation with. Unless you need help looking for something (here's a hint...alphabetization).\n\nYes, AAB&C is a good \"comic book store\"...by standards set ten or twenty years ago. These days I expect more from my comic book store. \n\nMaybe it's because of the integration of trading card players into geek culture. Or maybe it's because the internet has replaced basic human interaction and I crave more face to face time with other nerds like myself. \n\nOr maybe it's because it's 114 fucking degrees outside and I need a place to go.\n\nBut me personally, I like a comic book store with some atmosphere and hospitality.\n\nSure, not having any playing space to play or read cuts back on the \"Yeah, I think I can get it one more game in before my mom comes to pick me up\" crowd, but let's call a spade a spade; you used to be that fucking kid. And so did I. \n\nMaybe it wasn't our local comic shop, but it was the mall, the movie theater, perhaps even La Biblioteca. We've all been there, we all had parents who didn't want to spend the weekend with us, and as annoying as the spectacle of sad and fail is to behold, we have no real place to pass judgment. \n\nAfter all, we're the ones buying comic books and action figures we'll never take out of the box. And the shops can afford to carry such ridiculous fare from all the income they get hosting Magi-Yugi-Mon events.\n\nBut wait, if AAB&C doesn't cater to such a crowd...how do they...wait what?\n\nIn my reviews of other comic book outlets, I've referred to AAB&C to \"All About Crooks & Comics\". \n\nThis is not a mere clever nickname given by the fund-deprived; AAB&C has a reputation for ripping off those poor and unfortunate few who come across a rare or vintage back issue/piece of memorabilia and bring it in hoping to get a reasonable price for it. \n\nI can't prove from first-hand experience, as I'm not a \"collector\", I'm a reader. I don't keep my books in bags, and with the exception of a set of JTHM I got for Christmas from Misty S, I don't even have any recent single issues. I just wait for them to come out on trade paperback. \n\nI know. The horror. The horror.\n\nBut I have had a lot of friends who've griped to me about going back to AAB&C and finding the same book they sold them a few weeks ago on sale for 3, 4, or perhaps even 5 times the amount it was bought. \n\nGranted, this is a common occurrence in all \"Used & New\" businesses; remember that commercial for Gamestop where the guy mentions that he's selling his copy of [Random First Person Shooter] for 15 bucks? Yeah, that never fucking happens. That guy would be lucky if he got 10, and that's including the 10% extra that his Gamestop card would give him, if he was smart enough to sign up for one in the first place. \n\nBut if AAB&C doesn't really buy into the whole \"trading card/clicking miniature figures\" craze, it makes you wonder where the profit comes from. Especially when there's a Samurai on Indian School & 7th St, an Atomic Comics at 28th Dr and Peoria, Stalking Moon on Greenway and Hero Comics on T-Bird.\n\nMaybe AAB&C primarily services \"serious buyers\" who do not have the time or patience for all the hub-bub and tomfoolery to be had at the other, trendier locations. Maybe it's those same people who gave this place all 5's (except the one who admits they only come in to buy gift certificates). \n\nMaybe that's where AAB&C's niche lies, and we should accept that certain people want certain things out of the places they give their patronage.\n\nWho knows? You've probably stopped giving a shit about what I say ever since I admitted I only buy trades. \n\nBut don't lie, you've got a friend who spouts nothing but quotes from Plato and Socrates, and every time he walks away everyone in your group is all \"I just want to kick that guy in the fucking balls!\"  \n\nUnless that friend is you.\n\nYou ass.", "business_id": "y9cQ0DBC0qFNgkpTXHzokA", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-07-05", "type": "review"}

Each time I called the pharmacy assuming the vet tech had already called in the prescription the day or two before like they had called to tell me they did, the pharmacy told me the prescription had not been called in. The end result was another phone call being made to EMAH to get the vet techs to call in the prescription that should have already been called in.

I would have appreciated a little more honesty rather than being given false hope that my cat's condition was more treatable than it was. The oncologist laughed at the negative results of the almost $500 needle biopsy test and said that the test was ABSOLUTELY WORTHLESS (\"I could draw negative needle biopsy tests almost all day from a cat I'm absolutely positive has cancer\"-she said)/ The ultrasound results and the blood work was enough for anyone to tell it was cancer, likely lymphoma. I felt so horrible walking out of the specialist's office ($175 appointment) on top of the hundreds already wasted on the useless lab test. I also had to take about 4 hours off of work to accommodate this worthless appointment where I was presented with the option to gamble 10k on chemo that only had a 25% chance of helping my cat for a couple years or put him through an equally expensive, incredibly invasive surgical procedure he might not even survive, let alone recover from.

When I reviewed some of the reviews before going to SunUp for dinner - I was a little confused.  I had been there and the food was good, service good, beer sampler - good.  So why the bad reviews from other yelpers.  Tonight I learned. \n\nWe went with my mom, brother, and my boyfriend.  We sat down and were greeted by a blond waitress.  Not extremely friendly but nice enough, service was decent for the first part of dinner, she was good about filling up drinks etc.  Then she brought the check, at the same time my brother ordered a second beer, so she took the check with her to update.  And then disappeared.  And disappeared . . . Brother's beer was half gone . . . and still she was not around.  I had actually thought we had paid the check and we were just hanging with my brother while he finished the beer - but no - mom had not in fact paid the bill and we waited.  So I look up - and there is our waitress flirting with a group of guys at the bar.  Now I get it - when you are kinda cute and serving beer - a group of guys is likely to tip better and more fun to hang with.  But that does not make it acceptable to neglect a table of four waiting to pay - tip and leave.  \n\nSo I will return - but I will be looking for our prior waitress - she was a sporty brunette - fun - and very good. \n\n(disclaimer in no way am I saying that because she was blond it made her bad - it is the only way for me to identify the waitress, should have gotten her name)", "business_id": "3UMcsN9IjoeV8JZvC4apag", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-06-21", "type": "review"}

I'm always on the lookout for a local joint that is special, a place I can take out-of-towners and say, \"This is one more thing I love about Phoenix.\" I had high expectations for SunUp since it is in my neighborhood, a short ride or healthy walk away from home\n\nBut after several visits over the last couple of months and as many disappointments, SunUp Brewing is on my list of places I might go if I'm desperate, not as a destination, and certainly not a place I want representing my city to friends from elsewhere.\n\nI'm no beer aficionado, but I know what I like, and for the most part I like the brews at SunUp. I particularly enjoy the Light Rail Pale Ale as a mild-bodied thirst-quencher, and the Vanilla Porter, which is rich without being too sweet or heavy. I also like seeing what seasonal offerings they have, many of which I enjoyed.\n\nOne constant on my many visits, however, is the truly bad customer service. I don't care if you make minimum wage or six figures; if your job is to take orders and serve people, then do it. Many other Yelp reviewers indicate they have suffered lackadaisical customer service at SunUp, and my experience is that this is the rule, not the exception.\n\nTake today, for example: At 1 p.m. on a Sunday, the place was virtually empty save for about three tables and a couple in the main bar area. The last problem I thought I'd have would be getting attention, but my disinterested server/bartender pulled a disappearing act after pouring my beer and plopping my burger in front of me. She was more interested in sitting in a booth in the adjacent room with a paper in front of her, watching TV.\n\nIf she had bothered to follow up with her customer, she would've learned my burger was the opposite of the medium-rare burger I ordered. Even more aggravating was when she did walk quickly past me (including one time when she told the other server she as heading out back, presumably for a break), she looked directly at my barely touched meal but didn't inquire as to why I wasn't eating it. I'm not going to chase down a server, especially if it involves going room to room to find her. All she had to do was notice I hadn't touched my meal for 20 minutes and ask if everything was OK.\n\nI've had similar experiences with the staff at SunUp before although this example was the most egregious. Like other reviewers, I've waited at the bar either with a growler ready to be filled or a bill I'm trying to pay while the bartender chatted with friends even after acknowledging me.\n\nIt shouldn't be this hard to find a place that wants to sell me something, but evidently the folks at SunUp have more cash than they need, so I see no reason to spend mine there again.", "business_id": "3UMcsN9IjoeV8JZvC4apag", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-06-27", "type": "review"}

None of us had ever been there before so we were excited to see what this place was all about.\n\nSituated about a 10ish minute walk from the light rail station, it is a nice walk through a part of town where I wouldn't normally be.  You wouldn't think this place is a brewery because of its small size but it is.  The inside is very quaint and taverny.  It has a very relaxed vibe going on.\n\nI ordered the sampler and all their beers are pretty decent.  I decided on the Amber for my pint, but they were all good so it was a difficult decision.  Not bad for a little local brewery at all.  For a quick bite before we moved on we ordered the calamari and the bratwurst splitter.  The calamari was pretty standard and the aioli had a nice kick to it.  The bratwurst was excellent and unique.  Each was perfect to split among 4 people.  The rest of their menu looked good but is pretty much typical bar food.  Well probably a bit better than average bar food.  Anyway, it is perfect food for the place and looking back we should have probably eaten dinner there instead of only an appetizer.\n\nPro Tip:  Cross over to the north side of the street at the light as soon as you exit the light rail station.  Otherwise you will be dodging traffic as you try to cross because the place is located on the other side of the street far from another crosswalk.\n\nAnyway, I would like to come back for a few beers and food.  I would also like to do the brewery tour.", "business_id": "3UMcsN9IjoeV8JZvC4apag", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-06-28", "type": "review"}

I was a fan when it was still Sonora Brewhouse, and I was a fan after the name change/change of ownership/whatever.  The waitstaff was always sort of iffy, but the patio was comfortable (when smokers weren't around), and the food was pretty consistent.  I was particularly in love with a new addition to the menu - the spicy pulled pork sandwich.\n\nIn search of a good place open on July 4th, I stopped in with a friend, already craving that delicious sandwich.  After waiting a couple minutes to be seated (and not even being acknowledged by anyone when we entered), we were led to a table by an older woman.  She took our drink orders and left us with menus to look over.  It took me a minute to realize they'd changed their menu.  Instead of one with appetizers, salads, sandwiches/burgers, entrees, and desserts, they instead now have a lunch and dinner menu.  And, sadly, the pulled pork sandwich had been discontinued.  I settled on the green chile chicken sandwich of some sort and an iced tea.  The waitress wasn't very friendly and seemed to be uninterested in being pleasant.  Our meals arrived but without the chipotle ketchup we requested.  A few minutes later, the waitress brought it to our table.  There was nothing impressive about my sandwich.  It was fairly blah and unseasoned, and the sweet potato fries were crispy on the outside but tough and hard on the inside.  Shame I paid $1 to upgrade from regular fries.\n\nOnce it came time to pay, the waitress took an exceptionally long time to return our cards and receipts to us.  My companion saw she was just standing around in the back not doing anything.  The place was pretty empty, so I don't really know why service was so bad.  I do know that the new menu leaves a lot to be desired, and unfortunately, I'll be hard-pressed to return in the future.", "business_id": "3UMcsN9IjoeV8JZvC4apag", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-07-06", "type": "review"}

I have had a battery of treatments (surgery, rashes, dry scalp, mole removal, laser hair removal, botox, aesthetic treatments and on and on...) there and every single experience has far exceeded my expectations.\n\nDr. Laris' bedside manner is second to none. A couple of years ago, Dr. Laris performed an otoplasty procedure on me. He took the time to explain the process and technique and answered all of my questions with the utmost of care. The outcome was not only natural results, but a boost in confidence after a weight that I had carried around my entire life had finally been lifted. From surgical procedures to botox injections (shhh...), Dr. Laris' skillful hands deliver tasteful, natural enhancements that make you feel like a better version of yourself.\n\nHis staff are equally amazing, which is no small feat! From the front desk staff to the nurses and PAs, everyone treats you with the utmost respect. I've been seeing their aesthetician, McKenzie, for laser hair removal treatments for a while now and I can't stop going back for more once I finish an area. McKenzie is very attentive and has a bubbly personality. She's helped me clear my \"bacne\" through a series of peels and treatments. Her services have also improved my quality of life immensely!\n\nLastly, I recommend Phoenix Skin to all of my friends and family. My mother had skin cancer removed from her lip by Dr. Laris and countless friends of mine (including my husband) have been getting their once-thought-it-was-the-best-idea-ever tattoo removal done by Caitlin and their state-of-the-art PicoSure laser.

We have the large 2 bedroom and it doesn't feel cramped like most apartments. The location is close to a light rail stop (Central & Indian School) and across the street from Steele Indian Park which holds a lot of great local events & even has a dog park. Great pools and the gym is ok. \n\nNow with the bad. The management here is completely unhelpful. They actually changed management a few months ago but from what I have experienced they are no more helpful than the last. \n\nThe previous management never did an actual walk-through with us, just had us fill out the form and drop it off. They never gave us the key to our patio storage and we still do not have it (we tried 2-3 times to inquire and just gave up after that). They would take weeks to complete maintenance orders (simple or complicated), obviously a sign of bad management. It even took them months to get us copies of the gate keys.\n\nRight as they switched over management there was for some reason a large pool of white paint in one of the parking garage spots. My toddler almost slipped in it, getting paint all over herself and I. I spoke to someone now under the new management and they said they would look into it. Who knows if they did. \n\nIt seems they've tried to employ \"fun\" things with iliveheretoo.com and a meet & greet with management staff. I feel as though they should have improved their basic customer service and maintenance before even thinking about those things. They sent out a letter for Fourth of July stating that they would be providing security for our parking garage and to ensure no reserved spots would be taken by event attendees. The park holds a large fireworks event, so there is a lot of traffic. Well as we pull in we see the hired security and think \"Awesome!\" but we pull in to our space and there is someone in it! So I don't know what kind of process the management relayed to this hired security but it was obviously not thought through. The security let us know that they could tow, but we would need the tow card--which they ALSO NEVER GAVE US. They also promised the top floor of the garage would be reserved and blocked off for residents to bring chairs and watch the show. They didn't come through on that either. There were tons of cars parked and even more that were still trying to drive through the loads of pedestrians (including children) making it very dangerous. \n\nThey scheduled the apartment above me to be turned over on an early Saturday morning with the banging and noise continuing well on into the afternoon. After calling in and asking why they would do this on a weekend the explanation was \"well if they don't do it today the people can't move in.\" Which to my reaction is great, what about the people who pay and already live here?! You mean to tell me they couldn't schedule themselves correctly and move it 2 days to a Monday? Another mis-management of their maintenance scheduling. \n\nOther issues include overflowing garbage that's right inside the garage,  pigeon/cat/dog waste, big security gate breaks often (defeating the 'security') part. When it rains you can just smell all the dog and cat pee. I love animals--but they should really work on controlling this issue. They could probably benefit from working with a shelter or a trap-neuter-return organization for all the stray cats. They could also pay more attention to which residents are not cleaning up after their pets. There are several areas in the complex and in the garage as well that are caked with pigeon feces. \n\nI know this is long and I probably sounds like a grump, but just don't want anyone to be sold alone on the units aesthetics like I was. I think \"The Station\" just down the street might be owned by the same company? I've been there and its SO much cleaner and nice--but I think that's because they cater to a higher price point, sadly.\n\nAlso--I had ignored the bad reviews I found online of this place, big mistake.", "business_id": "leFRt1SBYL4ZHalLLTlbsQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-08-11", "type": "review"}

The chairs and carpet match and not in a good way- the exact same pattern!. The chairs are cushiony and kind of scare me thinking what might be on them or embedded in the fabric.

I don't know if the recession is having the girls working harder for dances or what, but they have been MUCH more lax. Touchy, touch , almost to a point of discomfort. Bare touching to the client, under shirts, bras, underwear... I'm sure most people dig it, but if you don't want to get that \"personal\" I would advise skipping the dances. \nOverall, not bad for a strip club! How about a little decor upgrade? A \npatio cleanup? And maybe someone to Windex the mirrors because they are covered all throughout the club with streaky hand prints. I'm sure this place can afford it based on those hefty drink prices. \nEnjoy and try not to get kicked in the head with a giant plastic heel. \n*TIP- go on-line to print free admission passes, then you can save that 10 bucks for a groping and pretty X rated lap dance!", "business_id": "wnOQw4nazfglLxwLogTlng", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-06-05", "type": "review"}

There were many waitresses fighting over our table, we were so incredibly uncomfortable. The first waitress was an older woman who was so rude and wouldn't give us napkins to wipe our wet chairs, until we paid for our drinks.  The dancer next to us was performing a sexual favor, right there in the middle of the club, not even in the VIP area. The owner of this place is probably clueless of what goes on here.

Its to the point when someone from work brings it for lunch, I can tell just from the salsa smell they went to Juans. LoL. The chips and salsa are always a listed item when we order to go from here, for about $1.30, you get a small (which isn't small) bag of chips and salsa. Always ask for extra salsa.\n\nThe shredded beef or chicken hard tacos are always fantastic, the fluatas (rolled tacos) are good here as well. You can get them in a combo with rice and beans at a very reasonable price $7.00-$8.00.\n\nWhen you're sick? Go for the albondigas soup (meatball rice soup). It is soooo good and soothing to aching throats and it just makes me feel better when I'm under the weather. The broth is light but flavorful, with rice on the side, you can add or leave. It comes with flour or corn tortilla.\n\nThe have red and green chili corn tamales. Both are fantastic but I go for the green chili corn, extra sauce $2.00.\n\nThe service is always nice and professional when we stay in. They're quick to ask if we want a refil on soda, chips, salsa - check back a couple times to make sure you have everything you could want. Sometimes we'll call our order in and decide to sit and eat instead of coming right back to work. Their so easy about letting us do so.\nWhen dining in, I get my order quickly. If we're calling in for lunch, we call about 1035AM, since our lunch is at 11AM and before their rush hour begins. So in all, there hasn't been a problem with getting out food.\n\nWhen you first walk in for lunch, the sitting area looks small. But when it gets busy, they open the back area which has quite a few more booths back there. They have a flat screen going in the corner and also \"bar\" seating. The only thing that bothered me about this place is the Specials board is always under the t.v. at the far end of the dining area. You'll see it if you happen to go to the bathroom or know to look over there.\n\nOh yea, a large drink is extra large and medium is large.

The food is just good enough. One or two steps above fast food Mexican.

The service was 100 percent completely horrendous. I will break it down nice and easy for ya:\n\nThe boy and I took our friend Brittany S. for a birthday lunch.\nBrittany and I were seated, while the boy finished a phone call outside.\nBrittany and I placed our orders. I, a slice of pizza from their lunch menu, and she a house salad with chicken. We informed the server the boy would be in and would also be ordering something.\nThe boy finally arrived and we placed his order - a Bollo Pasta from the lunch menu, and a toasted ravioli appetizer. \nBrittany and I's food arrived first. Mine was fine, or rather, correct (the pizza tasted horrible), while hers was missing the chicken. She called the server over and asked if she could have a side of chicken and he looked at her like it was the most ridiculous request he's ever had. He looked at her strangely for a minute or so, until finally he said \"oh, did you want chicken on that?\". DUH. \nAt this point, Brittany had gotten up to make a phone call, so Mike and I requested a birthday pizzookie for her. You know, they would embarrass her with the whole singing cheesiness bit. We specifically explain this to the server and he nods his head and asks what kind of pizzookie we want. Great! Or so we thought.\nSo after that Brittany and I slowly eat our food, thinking the boy's would be out at any moment. 10 minutes.. 15 minutes... 20 minutes... 25 minutes passed by and still no food. The joint wasn't busy so we were a little confused. Our server must have noticed our confusion because he came over and asked us if we wanted to order some more food. REALLY?! \"We already ordered his food - 25 minutes ago\". \"OOOOH, ok, I'll put that in for you\" was his dumb-ass remark. OK, thanks, bud! \n15 minutes later the rest of the food arrives, and our server says \"oh, now that wasn't too bad!\" - yeah, except we waited a total of 40 minutes for a goddamned bowl of angel hair with marinara. \n\nSo Mike ate his food and we chatted, when the server came over, gave me a look, and pointed his fingers at me, and said \"oooh, gotcha\". I'm assuming he forgot about our pizzookie as well, and quickly remembered upon the \"I'm going to kill you\" look I gave him. \n\n10 minutes later we see him coming with the pizzookie. Here we are, expecting some big embarrassing birthday song (because they DO do birthdays at Oregano's), and all he does is set the cookie down on the table, looks at Brittany, and says \"so, it's your birthday?\", then awkwardly looks at Mike and I like we are supposed to know what to do. WHAT?! NO BIRTHDAY SONG?! He smiles awkwardly and walks away. \n\nBy this point Mike and I are so furious that we are ready to stand up and scream in this guys face. We eat the cookie and he brings us our bill. Hell no did he charge us for EVERY single little thing he forgot. He also didn't give us the lunch special prices (we ordered before the cut off) Come on, we weren't expecting you to comp our entire bill, but seriously. Don't charge us the $2.50 for the chicken you forgot, or the two dishes you forgot, or the birthday cookie that you totally screwed up and still had the nerve to ring in as \"birthday\" and charge us for it, or overcharge us for the lunch plates. SERIOUSLY?! \n\nWe threw down and left. Pissed. Pissed that our server forgot every single thing we ordered. Pissed that we spent almost two hours on lunch because of it. And pissed that he didn't even once acknowledge our frustrations. I won't be coming back here again.

Good things come to those who wait.\n\nI like the big rig pasta with chicken or there is a massive salad with shrimp that I love. Best part? The cosmos! My husband loves the lasagna (order as soon as you get there - it takes 45 mins to cook). My kids like the dough they give you to play with (they will even bake your dinosaur shape for you). The kids meals are dirt cheap. If you can handle the extra calories, get the cookie!! \n\nGreat place to go with the kids, to hang out with friends or for a date night. We always take out of town family and they love it! \n\nThe staff is always great, especially since they are usually packed.

There is always a ridiculous wait time here. It doesn't matter when you come, it is ALWAYS busy. Always. \n\n2.) I love the food. It's definitely a bang for your buck and man, is it good. \n\n3.) PIZZOOKIE. Nuff said.\n\n4.) Gibbilinni Bellini. Again, nuff said. \n\nThe service is usually great...perhaps to make up for the outrageous wait times? Anyway, my last visit here was rather hectic; my mother was in town so we planned a dinner here for her with most of our extended family (a 20 person group). I understood this might be difficult considering the size of the place, so I called a couple of days prior to see if they could in fact accommodate us. Sure, they said. Because they don't take reservations over the phone, I would need to go to the restaurant the day of to put our name on the list. They assured me \"no worries, we'll take care of you and have everything ready.\"\n\nSo I head to the restaurant around 1 pm to put our names on the list for 6 pm. We get there at 550 and are told it's going to be a 45 - 60 minute wait. Wait, seriously? So then why did I make a trip several hours prior because that's what you told me would ensure we're seated on time? \n\nSo our party of twenty is waiting outside in the hot parking lot (because of course there wasn't enough room in the waiting area) for nearly an hour. They were very accommodating with water and drinks while we waited, which was nice. The only thing that was really irritating about the wait was the whole time thing: we were constantly being told, oh, it'll be just a minute, or oh, they're bussing it now. When all we needed to do was step is side and see that nothing was actually happening, so we felt like we were being jerked around so we wouldn't leave. What's with restaurants not telling it like it is with wait times? So annoying, especially in the heat. \n\nAnyway, so we're finally seated in the only area that can hold us, and we're totally cramped. But we're a close family, so lucky for us! Our server was really great with filling our orders and accommodating our needs. Like I said, he totally made up for our outrageous wait with good service...and what was at first a hectic, stressful evening, turned out to be an entertaining one. \n\nOf course I'll come back to Oregano's time and time again..there is that something that constantly draws us back.", "business_id": "ML1RJdeZ7bbfMrHvJ7m99A", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-07-15", "type": "review"}

We love eating here and we've got it down to a science.  Here's your gameplan for a fantastic Oregano's experience in under 90 minutes.  Print it out and take it with you (yes, you can laminate it if you want).\n\nINSIDER'S GUIDE TO OREGANO'S:\n\n1) Make plans for dinner (lunch is an impossibility unless you have two-hour lunch breaks ... you lucky dog).\n\n2) Get some fun friends together (Oregano's is great in groups of about six - keeps all seating options open)\n\n3) Grab a deck of cards or two (you'll see)\n\n4) Get the whole group to show up at 6 (they won't put your name on the list unless you're all there)\n\n5) Hang out and talk or play cards with your friends for forty minutes or so (now you see why they need to be FUN friends)\n\n6) About 20 minutes before your scheduled seating, order two things: DEEP DISH PIZZA and GUACA-TONY.  These both take a while but the waitstaff will put the order in and have it cook while you wait.\n\n7) After you get seated and get drinks, put in any SALAD OR ENTREE orders.  As you do, the guaca-tony will show up right on cue.  Your friends will admire both your foresight and your appetizer selection.  It's an amazing Italian guacamole with a thin-crust pizza for dipping.  Unforgettable, as Old Blue-eyes would say.\n\n8) The guaca-tony will be mostly gone in a hurry, so have the obligatory \"no, you take the last slice\" discussion, and reluctantly gobble down the rest of it (way to take one for the team, champ).  Just as the pan is cleared, here comes the pizza and other entrees.  Perfect!  But don't let that waiter escape - order your PIZZOOKIES now! (ideally chocolate chip, but I won't judge if you go for peanut butter or white chocolate macadamia nut).\n\n9) Devour the pizza.  Their deep dish is so very good.  It's extremely filling, so it's best to calculate about 1-2 slices per person.  Don't worry, it's tasty reheated.\n\n10) Just when you decide you can't eat another bite, the pizzookies show up ... and, well, you might as well have a little.  Generous scoops of vanilla ice cream on top of a half-baked cookie in a pizza pan, and drizzed with chocolate syrup.  The best.\n\n11) Grab the check.  Your friends will think you are very generous, but it turns out eating at Oregano's is really affordable in groups, since you split most things.  Without alcohol, it usually works out to about $10 per person, including tax and tip.  Of course, you can just ask everyone for the 10 bucks or, if you're feeling unscrupulous, ask them all for 15 bucks.  For the awesome meal they just had, they'll probably pay it!", "business_id": "ML1RJdeZ7bbfMrHvJ7m99A", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-08-27", "type": "review"}

It was thick strips that tasted very very fishy. I understand that calamari is seafood, but this tasted like bad fish, plus it was way over coated and salty. We sent it back and ordered fried ravioli. When it arrived, it too, was way over salted and tasted stale. We ate a few but didn't send it back. Next came our pizza. We ordered the lunch slices.

I mean it, silly.  We ordered a pizza and the waiter immediately asked us if we knew it was at least 45 minutes for a thin crust and an hour for a deep dish?  Huh?  What in the name of God takes that long to assemble a pizza?  I can *almost* understand the long wait on a deep dish simply because of the cooking time, almost.  But 45 minutes for a thin crust (we're talking a crust so thin it's almost like a huge circular Saltine cracker) is friggen ridiculous.  Sorry, Oregano's, but that is just too long.\n\nSo rant about the ridiculous wait time aside, the food here is actually pretty good, and they can make a side of calamari like nobody's business.  It's delicious.  My toddler and I mowed through a serving of calamari and had enough to take home to snack on the next night.  I also had a mojito and it was very good, crisp, refreshing and yummy.  And as far as the pizza goes it was very good, and my husband throughly enjoyed it.  It was just the right amount of cheese and the crust was perfect.  Good pizza, awful wait.   \n\nLike my last sit-down dining experience this waiter also somehow managed to completely ignore the presense of my toddler and I finally had to ask him to get us a cup of water for her.  Rant Alert!  I seriously do NOT understand why wait staff ignore the babies and small children of paying patrons.  Yes, it's true that my two year old won't be tipping you, or placing a food order, or even mentioning her experience on Yelp, but her mommy sure as hell will, so at least acknowledge that when you take drink orders every living, breathing human being at the table probably needs their own beverage and may need to order their own food too. \n\nKnowing the wait on the pizza I got clever and called over our waiter and asked him to put in an order for a pizzokie (sp?) for us, to go.  I explained that I couldn't make my toddler behave much longer and he graciously told me that he didn't mind noisy babies, which was great, except I bet all the patrons around us WOULD mind it if my daughter decided she was done being nice and was ready to start banging the salt shaker on the table while bellowing out 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star' at the stop of her tiny lungs.  ;)  So after some puzzlement at my (apparently odd) request to take dessert to go he finally got it sorted out and we were able to pay and leave with our delicious dessert before the impending meltdown.\n\nSo all in all this was a nice visit, but that wait time on the pizza needs to be shortened.

The Big 'Ole Vedge sandwich sounds amazing but tastes totally bland, no flavor whatsoever. My husband has given the Italian Wedding soup a few different tries, but finds it is always way too salty. He gives their pasta the general description of \"bland\"; no matter which one he ordered, they all tasted the same. \n\nThe only awesome food here is the pizookie cookie. A decadent, AMAZING dessert that, now that I think about it, I can easily make at home for half the cost and none of the hassle. \n\nOh and the wait. An hour, minimum. No exceptions. You will always wait at Oregano's.

For starters, I recommend a small Simple House Salad - it is plenty to split between two people.\n\nLast night the Wings of Fire (medium) were not up to par. Previous orders of the wings have been outstanding, but last night was quite a disappointment. The sauce seemed different (runnier), the wings were small, and there was a rubbery texture on a few of them. I am hoping that it was just an off night for the quality of the wings and will be trying them one more time. Also, if you are a fan of the taste of calamari and traditional preparation of it, do not order the Bistro Calamari. The fried coating was way too thick and took away from the texture and taste of the calamari. \n\nBack to the positives! The Brussels Sprouts are delicious (note that they take about 20 minutes to cook). Both the Alfredo the Dark and the Big Rig Pasta (with meatballs) are delightful. They have a slight spice to them and the pasta is cooked perfectly (to my standards at least). The bread that accompanies the pastas adds a nice touch to the meal. \n\nIf you have room, I suggest ending your meal with The Original Pizza Cookie - Chocolate Chip! My only complaint is that there is not an option of regular peanut butter flavor. Ask for a refill of your beverage in a to-go cup, it is refreshing for the drive home.\n\nOf course I suggest trying Oregano's! :)", "business_id": "ML1RJdeZ7bbfMrHvJ7m99A", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-06-16", "type": "review"}

Now the food is where they fell short we ordered the calamari way before the meal and our salads arrived before the calamari which my salad was not a garden salad but romaine and two very thinly sliced tomatoes and two pieces of thinly sliced red onion with ranch . When the calamari arrived it was over cooked and rubbery with a fish flavor I have only had calamari two other places and they were really good so I was disappointed in the flavor and rubbery calamari. The pizza arrived and I was told the next time I had to get both slices with the same toppings I looked at my pizza and to my disappointment I received Canadian bacon instead if bacon as I specified as bacon bacon. Then as I was eating my sausage and onion slice I noticed the fork I was using had a huge piece of dried shaved Parmesan cheese on the handle it went from the end of the fork to half way to the prongs of the fork. I lost my appetite after that and I didn't ask for the manager but jukes had him come out he did apologize for it and said he was embarrassed and because of the service I give them 3 stars .

Friendship is a place to go before it gets to the point.  They offer in hospital treatment  where a person can still go home at night.  Transportation is not a problem if you are at a place where you don't drive, or don't drive.  Meals are also provided.  And, while, Friendship is a not program for detox, but if you are clean and want to stay that way they can work with you,  A dual diagnosis does not mean there is no hope for you at Friendship.\n\nFriendship offers two types of treament programs.  One is a program that starts in the morning and last until the afternoon.  It is really designed for a person who just doesn't have a clue as to where to start on their recovery from mental illness, or someone who functions but never has had a chance to actually learn how to do it.  For people who are higher functioning, there is an afternoon program that really focuses on the processes you have already learned and how to use them more successfully.\n\nI am not going to begin to say what you do is easy at Friendship.  It requires work on the part of the individual.  What is unique about Friendship is even if you have no desire to do the work it takes to recover, they will teach you through group work that you are capable of doing it.  I am proof of the fact that it works.  An added advantage of the program is you are always welcome back.  I'd like to say that anyone who graduates from Friendship is going to handle things from there on out with no problems.  That is never the case. There will always be problems.  If at some time in the future you recognize you are becoming overwhelmed, you can go back.\n\nFriendship's staff is really a dedicated group that truthfully want to assist someone who is dealing with emotional or mental health issues to achieve a happier more effective life.  If that wasn't their goal I guarantee you they would not last.  From Gus who will first contact you, (I remember thinking Gus, sounds like a moron's name, before I met him-but at that point in my life, I would have thought the same of Mother Theresa) to Erika and Shawn in the front office, to the staff, everyone is there to help you regain your health.  They work with you on everything including dealing with your insurance company.  While they can't do everything for You, you will have their support along the way!\n\nI simply can not say how much Friendship means to me personally.

The unassuming strip mall exterior and the fact that it shares a wall partition with a blech sister restaurant (Tokyo Express) had me fooled.  Even the overwhelmingly positive reviews didn't inspire me to go.  But make no mistake, this place is fantastic. \n\nI am embarrassed to say that I only ended up here because Lola and Padres (Oregano's was too long of a wait) were both closed on Sunday night -- and I pass by this place all the time.\n\nReally good noodles and pasta done Asian Fusion style and totally cheap.  The noodle dishes here are eight or nine dollars and have huge portions.  I ordered the haruki yakisoba noodle stirfry with pork and shrimp - which came to me in a large bowl and steaming with soy and ginger flavors.  The Korean spicy noodle bowl also outdid itself with sliced beef strips and a wonderfully hot hot hot taste.  If that's not your thang, they have rice bowls, sushi, salads, about 20 Italian/Med dishes and several vegetarian and tofu dishes.\n\nYou'll find that they have an open kitchen so if you're close to it you can spy and  salivate over everyone else's food.  The servers were all very prompt and courteous after a slow start.  A solo diner next to us was raving about the place and how much he loves it. \n\nMy favorite part of the food was definitely the complimentary cinammon bread crisps and bread basket that came with BANANA BREAD?!?  Wtf, whew, that came out of left field.  An awesome and delicious surprise that was.\n\nThey had a small wine list that was half off for that night -- as a nightly special.  Did you hear that?  HALF OFF!!  All the sudden that $30 bottle of pinot looked pretty damn good.  So for $15 we had four glasses of wine on the cheap.  The owners know the one way to my heart -- wine specials!!  Yes, it's official.  I'm easy.\n\nWhen I got the tab did I realize that dinner here (with the wine) was CHEAPER than breakfast earlier that day at Orange Table.  Only then, did everything in life make sense.  Lesson:  Sketchy looking strip mall restaurant does not equal dump. \n\nP.S.

Even if you did, you'd never know it was so damn good.\n\nAny how, a friend introduced me, and I am in love with this place for the following reasons:\n\n1. QUALITY.\nThe food is ALWAYS excellent.  I've never had anything bad here and it's always fresh and tasty.  \n\n2. VARIETY.\nMy boyfriend and I love this place because he can get REAL Chinese and I don't have to eat forture cookies and water.  The theme is noodles, so we encompass all Asian varieties and Italian as well.  They also have other Asian options such as a Japanese bento-box, sushi, edemame, etc.  It's weird that they come to your table with bread and they latter on you're eating tempura...but that's the appeal.  Great desserts too!\n\n3. AMBIANCE.\nI always describe it as Tokyo Disneyland.  It's like a Japanese take on European provincial.  There's a nice brick facade inside, nice fixtures, big, solid-hunk-of wood rustic tables, filagree metal light fixtures, etc.  It's just pleasant and romantic.\n\n4. STAFF\nThey've got that perky-Japanese thing down, even the non-Asian wait staff.  They're always smiling and helpful.  The girls are cute and perky. They're always just really nice people.\n\nSo, come to the Cherry Blossom.

I have never seen a restaurant that is so eclectic... you have traditional noodle dishes, both hot and cold, from Japan, along with Sushi; pasta dishes from Italy, and some items from SouthEast Asia! There is more than enough diversity in their menu to satisfy the most discriminating palate. Despite their diversity, CherryBlossom Noodle Cafe does not stray from the basic tenant of Japanese Cuisine: food items are never too salty or too sweet, and are never bland; you can call it cooking subtlety.\n\nFor starters I ordered a California Summer Roll (Vietnamese) for my friend and myself. Unlike the Vietnamese Summer Roll spiced with mint, and usually accompanied by a lime dipping sauce; CherryBlossom's version was accompanied by a sauce comprised of sweet Sesame Seed / Soy Sauce dip. A Summer Roll contents include Shrimp, Rice Vermicelli, Crab strips, and Cabbage wrapped with a thin Rice Paper \"tortilla\". Anyone used to the Vietnamese version will see CherryBlossom's as probably a little bland... but you have to remember the philosophy behind Japanese cooking.\n\nMy friend also had Miso Soup with his meal. Unlike the soup yesterday evening, he said the Miso Soup was very good.\n\nWith every meal, you will also receive a bread basket ( http://cherryblossom-az.com/cherry-bread.gif ). The basket contains three types of breads: a soft and warm French Roll; a slice from a dark and sweet Blueberry bread; and a crispy Butter Biscuit. There is enough variety in texture from all the breads to satisfy anyone.\n\nMain dishes...\n\nI ordered for my friend Grilled Orange Roughy. The Orange Roughy was grilled to perfection and was accompanied by a sweet and salty dipping sauce concoction. Sides consisted of Japanese sticky rice.\n\nI ordered for myself the Beef Nanban Soup with thin Soba (Wheat) Noodles, rather than the Udon Noodles, accompanied by a bowl of Japanese Sticky Rice. \n\nMy friend does not drink, but I ordered the Rasperry Fruit Punch, a very good drink made from Raspberry Wine with Fruit Punch... essentially a Raspberry Wine Cooler (but stronger). This drink also had an umbrella \"thing\" spearing a whole strawberry! Very good and refreshing!\n\nI had my usual coffee after the meal which surprised me a little... an Amaretto laced coffee was brought out. The aroma was very enticing! Would make a coffee drinker out of anyone!\n\n100% of capacity, with 30% Asian; 20% Hispanic; rest Caucasian. First time I've been to a restaurant that was packed with NO seats left! A very popular spot!\n\nCherryBlossom is very heartily recommended so long as you remember the tenets of Japanese Cuisine... no extreme flavors... nothing will be extremely spicy, salty or sweet. This makes it easy to grab a little from this dish, and something from that dish without disrupting the flavor of either.\n\nThere was something that was a little disconcerting, though... The state of the men's room. For such a highly rated establishment, it seemed like no one had checked on the men's room for about two to three hours... toilet paper thrown around, stains around the wash basin. Nothing really objectionable, but a little surprising considering the number of staff for such a small establishment. This establishment has to be aware that a restaurant is judged by it's back-room as well as it's front room. Won't take anything off... but it is highly noticeable considering...\n\nAnd the diners of CherryBlossom has to share the same restrooms with Tokyo Express (right next door), both of the businesses are probably owned by the same management group. \n\nThe interesting tidbit is that we both spent MORE for a worse meal last night at Bamboo House... AMAZING! My friend said his dishes from the Summer Roll to the Grilled Fish was some of the freshest tasting dishes he ever had; good compliment from him. In fact, he wanted to go back to CherryBlossom the next evening... but this is my last night here in the Phoenix area.... sigh....\n\n(I really think everyone is reviewing CherryBlossom under the wrong spelling.... It's CherryBlossom, not \"Cherry Blossom\". Take a look at their sign or their website.)", "business_id": "AkOruz5CrCxUmXe1p_WoRg", "stars": 5, "date": "2007-08-15", "type": "review"}

I would have preferred, buttery or white wine or other flavors, but there were only green scallions to fight for dominance. The clams were ok, but some were gritty. I ordered a spicy salmon roll and that was very good. I liked the roe on the outside of the roll and the roll stayed intact as I brought it to my mouth. My partner got the Ahi with glaze and it was prepared perfectly, although the glaze was heavy handed. The tea was nice. My Raspberry Spritzer had a flavor I couldn't determine and I didn't like it as much as I thought I would. I actually added water to it, to soften the flavor and that's not something I've done often anywhere. The dessert case didn't have all the selections, but from my partners perspective the cheesecake looked nice, but when it was delivered it looked like the flan selection. oops.

We shared a dessert despite saying we wouldn't try one again. I got a pineapple cooler despite saying I wasn't going to try the drinks again. Listening to myself next time on both desserts and drinks. Promise.\nFood: The Penne Marinara was not spicy, but it was good said the daughter. It was $7 and the serving was plenty.

I added my sushi soy/wasabi sauce to it and the red pickled things from my partners curry dish and that livened it up. The sauce consistency was a bit ew at the end, so I didn't finish.

After looking around on Yelp I chose to take the queens to CBNC... \n\n\"So where is this place?\"\n\"ummm... between 7th street &amp; 10th street off of Camel\"\n\"Okaaay? The left or right side of the road?\"\n\"I unno\"\n\"What do you MEAN you don't know? Haven't you been here before?!\"\n\"Ummm... no.\"\n\"oh HELL to the no!\"\n*the car then becomes filled with laughter*\n\nWe passed right by it and then flipped a bitch out of no where and it made us fear for our lives! and then screams filled the car. Soon we were parked infront of a soon to be Domino's Pizza and headed to the cafe of my lil yelp dreams... Only to be met with a 20 minute wait. We were then outside and I was left to fight off the queens who seriously considered going to Tokyo express instead! And then FINALLY our names were called and we were seated.\n\nOur waitress was very nice. I want to say that it's the little touches that make CBNC great. The fresh  thick lemon wedge and fresh sprig of mint in the water pitchers. The way the servers are so friendly. She even complimented on my Japanese pronunciation! :) I didn't want to tell her the origin of my great accent...  watching Kill Bill a thousand times. \n\nShe helped us order sushi. I wanted nigiri and they didn't have it. I was disappointed but still went with her suggested crispy rolls and alaskan rolls. They were AMAZING! I loved the crunch and the flavor. With the soy sauce was scrumptious. We wanted to cancel our orders and just get more sushi! The alaskan was great as well. I loved it. Even the queen who never had sushi before liked it. \n\nAfter devouring the sushi our food came. I ordered the beef soba noodle soup with tempura. It came with chicken instead. (boo!) but the tempura was perfect! (yay!) and I never had soba noodles, I usually get udon or chinese noodles. but I really liked the flavor and the fresh spniach that was wilting more and more as time went on. The slight flavor of the sliced green onions really made the dish something special. I loved it. I am just so sad that I couldn't finish it all! :(\n\nOne queen devoured the beef yakisoba noodles at once! I was able to sneak my chopsticks inbetween his bites and I got a taste. it was CRAZY yummy! each of the veggies had a great difinitive flavor and yet melded together amazingly. I loved it. \n\nThe other queen was pleasantly surprised at the taste of his Spicy beef rice plate. He couldn't finish his eaither but it was really. A lil too spicy for my tastes, but it was still awesome. \n\nWe then ordered a bottle of wine and a sip here and a sip there and we were all in heaven! Talking to our waitress about the Navajo sushi chef behind the sushi bar who she was trying to hook up with one of us... but we couldn't tell WHO she was trying to hook him up with! One of the queens or me?! Said chef never made it to our table - and it's just as well... we were in food heaven savoring our delights and wishing we had bigger stomachs to take it all in! I'm a big fan of this place now and am VOWING to take several people with me next time! :)", "business_id": "AkOruz5CrCxUmXe1p_WoRg", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-08-26", "type": "review"}

The parking is plentiful and the interior is very contemporary/kawaii.  We totally expected a place similar to Spoon House in Torrence, CA but it is more Italian than Japanese atmosphere wise.  The banana bread was not as good as everyone raved to be but it was good.  \n\nWe first tried the tataki and a salmon roll.  Tataki was beautifully presented on the plate and both tasted pretty good.  Hiyashi Chuka was ok...not my fav and the portion was pretty small.  Champon was full of seafood and thick noodles which was a total plus :)  \n\nThe dessert...oh my, that was the best part of dinner...well, at least to me.  My bf's fav was the tiramisu.  I tried the flan and it was GREAT.  It's kinda hard to explain but it was like a mix of custard and cheesecake with a sauce that has a hint of bitterness to go with the sweet fran.

There was no one in the place yet he waited on us like they were full to capacity and he was the only server. He couldn't have been less concerned about serving us. \n\n2.

It was basically shrimp tempura in rice with some kind of sweet honey type of sauce over it. It was pretty tasty. I also got a rainbow sushi roll that took a very long time for them to prepare.

I'd forgotten about my one glorious trip to the Noodle Cafe until tonight, so it got my vote. (The Noodle Cafe is not forgettable - it's just that we're always trying new places so sometimes we forget to go back to places we love.)  \n\nJust like last time there were people waiting outside and we were told it'd be 20 minutes before we got a table.  It was really only about 15, but the food is SO worth the wait.\n\nTonight we ordered 3 sushi rolls: the crispy California, double crispy shrimp and the caterpillar roll.  All were super tasty! I love that they roll some of their rolls (the \"crispy\" ones) in panko crumbs - you seriously have to try one.  I think we may have ordered the same rolls last time because they're just that good! \n\nLast time we went I enjoyed the Spicy Korean Beef dish SO MUCH that it was really difficult for me to try something new this time.  I made a last minute decision to try the TanTan-Men Ramen dish which is a \"Sichuan Style Very Spicy Noodle Soup with Minced Pork.\"  I was worried about the \"very spicy\" part only because I'm not usually that tough when it comes to Asian spices.  However, since the Spicy Korean Beef had been that perfect amount of spicy - the kind that makes your lips numb but isn't painful - I decided to be brave.  I am not kidding you - this is the best Asian dish I've ever eaten!!!  Don't get me wrong, kids - it's SPICY.  My lips were numb, my tongue was tingly and my nose got a little runny.  At one point I may have told The Boy my stomach was on fire.  But I loved every minute of it!  And the best part is they gave me an enormous bowl full - so I had plenty to take home for a second round of yumminess!\n\nThe Boy has ordered the Pad Thai and Hakata Ramen - both tasty, but neither as tasty as my dishes! :) :)\n\nIn short - HA too late - DEFINITELY try  CherryBlossom Noodle Cafe.

Yakisoba noodle was burned.\n\nWell, I used to go this place alot, but I will never go back again. What happened to Japanese culture - Being fast , efficent and respectful ?\n\nI will never come back, there are lots of nice places in nort phoenix. just go check it out like Tokyo lobby, yen sushi. It will worth a drive, and \n\nSAYANORA Cherry Blossom", "business_id": "AkOruz5CrCxUmXe1p_WoRg", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-08-03", "type": "review"}

So you can order Italian or Asian food. They also have Sushi if that's your thing but I have no opinion on how that would taste since I don't indulge. I have eaten here many times in the past and have always liked the food (especially the Thai Beef Salad) and the price.Today I realized I had not been in a few years so I took an out of town friend here who loves ethnic food. I made the mistake to do a weekday lunch during normal lunch time. I think that  might have been the first time I did that and probably my last. (live and learn I guess)\n   The food was just OK, not great, not bad. They usually have unique and wonderfully tasty desserts but the carrot cake was just average. Maybe they had run out of their cool tarts and ethic fun treats. In the past they had always given out their wonderfully delicious banana bread free with their bread baskets( worth the trip alone) but not today. I did get their little cinnamon toasts though. YEAH!) My Chicken Slaw Salad was fine, good, but again not great. So I guess I am not sure if they have changed the way they do things or maybe it was just an off day. I just wasn't as wowed as I used to be and the place was ridiculously packed. \n   The thing that always gets to me in an annoying way here is how surprisingly bad the service is. It has always been terrible and continues to be so. Sad. I waited ten minutes to even be acknowledged when I walked through the door. The food service wasn't great either. They have always needed more help so it confused me when they expanded several years back. I see they still don't get it. If you are a busy, popular establishment please staff accordingly.  \n   If you want to try dining here there are still some positives. I would just go off hours and somehow get them to give you a slice of their Banana Bread. lol!

There are few noodle dishes out there that can satisfy the palate as well as a solid bowl of ramen. The key to good ramen is the excelling of three primary ingredients: the noodles, the broth, and the protein. \n\nThe noodles here are very well made with good consistency, texture, and fantastic compatibility with the broth. The broth itself has that signature creaminess, saltiness, and thickened smoothness that ramen broth should have. It gives the noodles a fine delicious dressing.\n\nAlas, the cha-shu pork is where the dish fails to amaze. While the BBQ flavor of the pork is adequate, CherryBlossom chooses to go the lean route in the preparation. The result is a piece of pork that is thick and devoid of fat. This flaw is a fatal one. Ramen noodles were designed in such a way that its fullest potential can only be achieved with fatty pieces of meat. In a true ramen dish, one seeks out the fatty piece of meat and treasures every bite as it enhances the richness of the broth and is counterbalanced by the starchiness of the noodles. CherryBlossom foregoes this authentic vision and opts for a healthier alternative. While it still delivers on most fronts, my inner samurai still desires that extra reach of flavor.\n\nOther reviews on Yelp also recommend their banana bread. However, I must condemn their banana bread and anybody else on Yelp who sponsors it. Their banana bread is incredibly dry and has a grainy texture quality to it. The flavor itself is very bland and the banana element is barely detectable. A shame.\n\nHowever, the dinner rolls that do come with your meal are quite good! They have a softness and fluffiness about them that nearly rivals Hawaiian rolls. Freshly baked and packed with flavor. An unexpected surprise!\n\nAt the end of the day, the entire experience was pretty good but far from great. CherryBlossom offers an eclectic mix of different cuisines and dishes. Though the ramen could not satiate, I am willing to return to test the other dishes. To be continued...", "business_id": "AkOruz5CrCxUmXe1p_WoRg", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-06-30", "type": "review"}

I was trying to find a good ramen place (so spoiled by Orenchi in the bay area... that's the golden standard). Walked in and saw some Asian people so thought it was a good sign. \n\nThe bad: Ordered chicken karage and ramen - chicken karage looked straight outta the freezer section at your local supermarket! \n\nIf you haven't had good chicken karage, it's fried (chicken, duh) with a batter similar to tempura (lighter than traditional American batters). Nope, this was your standard frozen, then warmed chicken with a rubbery-coating-that-passes-as-real-fried-food. If I wanted frozen food, I would have just made it myself (no I wouldn't, that shit tastes terrible). \n\nThe sauce was uninspiring, but hey, does it matter if the chicken isn't worth it? \n\nThe ugly:  The ramen I ordered came out... and disappointment abounds. First, the noodles looked like what you buy at the supermarket. So... yeah, if I want supermarket food, I'll just go to the supermarket. Am I wrong to expect restaurants to actually prepare food from scratch? Oh but it's so hard to make noodles by hand/machine you say? THAT'S WHY I SPEND MONEY IN A RESTAURANT!!!!\n\nWhat about the broth? The life-sustaining broth that is cooked for hours if not days and ties the entire dish together ... well let's not get too excited because once again, it tastes more like powdered mix. \n\nAre we sensing a theme here? Lots of supermarket stuff, at a premium price. Sorry, that's not why I go to a restaurant.\n\nSo why did I even bother trying this place? Because Yelp had promised me a grand culinary experience (okay maybe not grand, but good at least). This was really sub-par at best; the nicest servers or prettiest backdrop cannot make up for low-quality food. But I am a temporary tourist in Phoenix (4 months for work, normally in SF), so take my ran with a grain of salt.

We finally had a chance to go in the not-too-distant past, and we were not disappointed.\n\nI had heard that this is one of the few places in AZ that serves authentic Japanese food, primarily Japanese-style Ramen. Since being back in America after living in Japan, Japanese Ramen is probably the thing I miss the most. Well, after the wonderful people, of course! I know it is not originally a Japanese dish, but the Japanese style of Ramen is just the best! :) Oh, and GYOZA!! Of course!\n\nOf course, when we went to Cherryblossom, I definitely had to have some Ramen. It was excellent, as promised! My husband had some sushi since he loves the stuff, and it was pretty similar to decent Japanese sushi. I think they had \"American sushi\" choices as well, which is pretty different. :)\n\nOverall, it was a lovely experience. The environment was very nice as well. It was great to see some Japanese stuff on the walls and around the restaurant. It was pretty busy in there as well. My only complaint is that we didn't get to interact with any Japanese employees, so we could not practice our Japanese! :( There is always next time... :) Maybe we will have to sit at the sushi bar!", "business_id": "AkOruz5CrCxUmXe1p_WoRg", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-06-30", "type": "review"}

If their Asian food was really that amazing, wouldn't they just eschew serving the Italian in the same place, and focus on Asian? Or vice-versa? \n\nSo, while their noodles were good, they were missing all the other things that I like about Asian spots...namely, the hot sauces, diced chili in vinegar, asian drinks, maybe some coconut drink/dessert, and other non-noodle things that make an asian noodle place amazing. This is a place for old Phoenicians that think they are going outside of their comfort zone. For them, they are, and it is great.

I searched local places and I managed to try this place with some friends. I love this place and crave it all the time!\n\nIt's always busy in the evenings so I would definitely plan on a 20 minute or so wait, as it is a smaller restaurant. It's a slower paced-service, waiters are attentive but occupied with various customer, not to a point where it's annoying though, they're just not always on top of you like at other places. You get bread with your meal and it's very good.\n\nRamen: So far I've only had the Cha-shu Ramen which includes extra BBQ pork. The first thing I did when I tried this dish was taste the broth and I was actually in awe at how delicious it was. I don't know what they make it with but the broth was perfect in my opinion. The noodles are the sale point though; they are just right in thickness and have such a nice soft texture to them. I end up almost inhaling my bowl.\n\nGyoza: I love this appetizer, I've had dumplings at various places, these are definitely well flavored and prepared. The dipping sauce they come with is also nice and tangy and blends well with the spices. Definitely recommend it.\n\nKatsu-don: This rice bowl is topped with pork cutlets and egg. It's a great portion and balance with the steamed rice.

The food portions of this restaurant are *slightly* smaller than I'm used to, but for the price they're just right.\nOur waiters and waitresses tended to us quickly and neatly. They were servicing more than one table almost at a time, and yet they moved perfectly like clockwork. Not once did we feel as if we had to wait for another table to be finished being served before we could ask for another order.\n\nAh, and I must say, their Sake Float... I'm not normally a fan of sake, or for most alcohol really... but this was definitely an exception for me. Then again, I'm a huge fan of ice cream, malts, shakes, floats, a la modes, and etc. I'm just surprised that it worked so well with sake.\nOther than that, their green tea milk is delicious - it reminds me of an old green tea dessert drink I used to buy in a bottle... they stopped selling those things in all stores I used to buy them at, so to have a similarly-sweet and smooth tasting green tea liquid treat in this restaurant was a wonderful surprise.\nAnd last, but not least, I just ordered their vanilla ice cream for dessert. Which complemented the foods I had that night wonderfully~\n\nAll-in-all, this restaurant was a lovely experience.

I was not disappointed!  Finally, a place that serves the egg soft boiled/poached with a liquid yolk perfect for adding richness to the noodles.\n\nI do wish they had a shoyu or bonito-type broth besides the pork broth they use, but that's just me preferring saimin.\n\nI do feel that service has improved over the past couple years (they had a blonde waiter a couple years back who was pretty rude).

Just recently, I had an experience that pleasantly surprised me.  I'd purchased a Promaster CF card from them in January.  I used it for a while, but then it got corrupted somehow.  I switched to another brand that I had on hand, and took the Promaster back to FF.  They exchanged it for another after verifying that it was a bad card with no problems.  I stuck the new one in my camera case and forgot about it until a couple weeks ago. (I may have formatted the new one in my camera, I don't remember at this point)  I pulled it out to use it for a firmware update, and found that neither my camera or computer would recognize it.  So, I took it back to FF.  They tried to format it in one of their cameras, and it wouldn't function for them either.  With no questions asked, they not only exchanged this CF card for a new one, but they also upgraded it to the new \"Extreme\" CF that Promaster makes.  In other words, they exchanged a $60 CF card for a $140 card without any hassle or paperwork.  That's the kind of customer service I really like.  \n\nOne side comment:  The people behind the counter at FF are photo geeks (and I don't think they'd be offended by that) who happen to work in a camera shop.  Meaning they're incredibly knowledgable, and more than happy to help, but maybe not overwhelmingly polished and \"salesman-like\".  I've dealt with all of the gentlemen working there currently, and can't think of a single negative thing to say about any of them.\n\nRegarding pricing:  I research everything I buy before I make a purchase.  I know that I can beat the prices at FF on many items by ordering online.  The difference is generally fairly small though, and I feel that it's worth the extra 1-2% to purchase locally, and have the access to such an incredible knowledge base that the folks at FF have to offer.", "business_id": "VilxIfmahfOhMcIaGK8Www", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-08-19", "type": "review"}

We don't want to lose your business and you're not going to have to come see me again until your brakes truly have to be replaced. I'll cover everything including labor except the rotors, which I'll still cover the labor on.

That said, there's a few things that have been amiss at this place pretty much every time I come here.  The food has been average at best and the atmosphere isn't quite my thing.  Tonight exemplified this feeling for me during a dinner with family members.\n\nFor starters, this restaurant has been around forever.  Even many of the staff members have been here forever (our waiter had worked there for decades).  Between the long time staff and the decor, the feeling of this place is old school all the way.  It has some of the feel of an old school italian restaurant, though not so fancy that you have to be super dressy here.  In fact much of the clientele here is quite casual.  The customer crowd here has also typically been much older as I suspect many of their customers have been coming here for years.  I rarely see anyone younger than their forties or fifties in there, so interpret that however you want.\n\nThe food is old school classic italian from the pastas, the seafood dishes, the chicken and veal plates, and the steaks.  Tonight I went with the chicken francese.  Essentially a breaded chicken covered in a lemon butter sauce and topped with mushrooms.  First off, I'm not a mushroom guy so thats my fault.  But the chicken and breaded tasted pretty bland even with the sauce (which was way more butter than lemon by the way).  It was edible, but not that great.  I've had similar experiences with a couple of their pasta and veal dishes as well.  Each dish gets soup and a salad to start.  As usual both were okay, but again nothing special.  The prices are actually pretty reasonable so even if the flavors don't impress you, you can count on leaving full.\n\nIt may well be that I'm not the target audience of this restaurant.  Its an old school restaurant with old school grub, so maybe they're just looking to appeal to the old school crowd.  I'm not opposed to old world recipes as long as they're done well.  From my multiple visits here I find their cuisine adequate, but not much better than that.  There's plenty of italian joints in the Phoenix area.  This one falls somewhere in the middle of pack, at best.", "business_id": "3CSaqRNvYg7ZdN2zwxwzVw", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-06-11", "type": "review"}

And they do the most amazing wrap jobs, making gift giving even easier.\n\nThe final bonus is their annual Clearance sale. For three days each year they basically blow out their stock to make way for new finds.

When I got there she right away told me it was the apricot i ordered. i told her it did not taste like apricot (and neither did the other 8 people in our party) she tasted it and said its apricot. i said well maybe its a bad batch because it did not taste like the usual apricot we order or eat on their cookies. after thinking i was going to say okay and go home, i told her to take it to the owner so i could get my money back. they had me waiting for 10 minutes before this emormous man (6'6 and 340)comes out from the back room. He said with his deep voice  \"i tasted MY cake and its fine\". i could not believe this man actually tasted the cake. this just set me off. i told him you think your a big man and your going to imitimidate me by your size? he got sassy and said do you want me to get down to your level? i am 5'4. what a complete idiot. now remember i have been buying items at this place and their prior location for over 30 years. he argued with me for over 5 minutes and believe me i arged right back with him, he wasnt going to try to intimidate me (which i am sure he is use to because all of the employees couldnt believe i wasnt backing down to him).\ni am soooo disappointed with the actions of the owner and the manager that we will NEVER go back.

That meant I was going to miss my little sister's baby shower! :(  That made me incredibly sad.  What made me even sadder was her tearfully explaining to me that the baby shower her (bossy) mother in law was organizing for her was a hot-ass mess, AND that her mother in law was refusing to provide a cake for the shower!\n\n\"Ah ha\" I thought!  \"I can save the day from my hospital bed AND provide a kick ass cake for her baby shower!  Yay!!\"  \n\nSo I called Karsh's because they have some of the most YUMMYTASTIC cakes I've ever tasted...  Well, my first call to Karsh's didn't go so well because the first employee I spoke to didn't seem too interested in helping me AT ALL (it was close to closing time apparently) so I decided to call back the next day.  On my second call to Karsh's I reached an employee who said he was a manager, so I explained to him that I was stuck in the hospital, but that I would like to order a baby shower cake for my little sister's baby shower in a couple of weeks and that I would pay for it over the phone with my credit card and that my husband would pick it up for me the day of the shower.  He said he would be happy to help me with this order.  I told him what size I needed and what flavors we'd like for the cake and then he asked me about a decoration for the cake and I told him that her baby shower theme was baby turtles and baby owls, and maybe could they do something with that theme in mind...?  He said 'sure' and I assumed that dealing with a professional bakery and all, that they'd do something nice within those parameters.  \n\nHoly Mary, Mother of God, was I dead wrong about THAT.\n\n\nYou see the day of the shower arrived and my husband ran over to Karsh's Bakery and picked up the cake (and trust me, it wasn't a cheap cake) and then he brought that big, pink bakery box over to my hospital room so that when my little sister popped in to see me before going to her shower, I could surprise her with a beautiful cake to take to her party.\n\nWell, let me tell you what, my husband opened the tape sealing the edges of that pink bakery box so I could get a sneak peek and my face just froze in an expression of utter horror...  The idiots who decorated her cake over at Karsh's Bakery went and printed out an ugly black and green edible image of a giant sea turtle and plastered that monstrosity across the front of my sister's baby shower cake!!  And then in teeny tiny pink letters at the bottom of the photograph wrote \"Welcome Baby Emma\".\n\nI have never cried so hard in my LIFE!!  I think my nurses were worried I was going to go into labor I was so upset and sobbing.  Seriously, I was a wreck.\n\n\nI was crushed.  It was the ugliest, MOST disastrous mess you've ever seen.  I seriously cried for hours and I couldn't even look at my little sister when she came to my room to see what the \"big surprise\" was that I had for her that day.  I hid my face in my pillow quietly sobbing and pretended to be sleeping when she came by.\n\nIt was the most unprofessional thing you've EVER seen.  :(  \n\nWe should have taken a picture of it for the cake wrecks blog, but I was so distraught that I didn't want to look at it anymore.\n\nMy family still put on a brave face and took that monstrosity to her baby shower, while I hid in my hospital room and sobbed, and while everyone who saw it all agreed it was hideous, they also said it was quite delicious.  \n\nThankfully my sister was quite a good sport about it and thanked me profusely for the gesture.  I think she knew my intentions were good.\n\nSo there you have it; take it for what it's worth.  Karsh's makes delicious cakes, as long as you don't mind your 'adorable' baby shower cake looking like some Jacques Cousteau nature photograph out of a dusty old circa. 1960's textbook with some tiny, unprofessional greeting piped out frosting at the bottom of the ridiculous photograph.", "business_id": "vaqmESluryt5i4Wbkb6KRA", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-06-25", "type": "review"}

Hidden from plain view off of 7th St., and across from The Yard, Pomeroy's is as divey as it gets. I only stepped foot into this place because I was with friends who insisted on going inside, even against my wishes. So I at least knew what I was getting myself into. \n\nThat being said, it's almost not even fair I'm writing a review for this place, because some dives can be great hidden gems, but I have to take action with this place by giving my two cents. I live and the neighborhood and this establishment always comes up on my Yelp mobile app and I'm not sure why. \n\nHere's the thing: I really like dive bars. Just not ones that take it to an apathetic extreme. That's the vibe you get when you walk into Pomeroy's. I'm really not one for bars with dim lighting and prehistoric decor. Strike 1. \n\nService wasn't that good either. As I said, the place is so crappy looking it's reflected in the attitudes of the people that work here. You have to order everything from the bar. Even food. My friends wanted to have a quick bite to eat here and the waitress saw us once. Granted they were a little busy, but c'mon. Strike 2.\n\nI won't continue on with this, but I can promise that if you're looking for a drink, or even a good place for happy hour, there are just too many other options in the vicinity that are 100 times better than the ambiance of this place: Zipps, The Yard, The Vig, and Z Tejas to name a few.", "business_id": "_GS1R0LTwr6h8rMWY_8U9Q", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-08-13", "type": "review"}

Needless to say, my hopes were let down. \n\nWhen it was my turn, the barber sort of made a grunt and I guess that was my cue to sit in the chair. Really friendly. I told him exactly what I wanted and was very specific, even showed him a PICTURE and told him what I did not want. \n\nThis did not matter. He proceeded to give me a taper (what I asked him not to do- it wasn't even pictured in the image I showed him) and basically butchered my hair and the end result was nothing like the picture. This is not a very hard haircut, mind you. I'm not even able to say it was a language barrier that prevented him from giving me the haircut that I asked for considering I put it right in front of his face. It's just a simple case of being incompetent. \n\nHe used no scissors on my hair (I am white and I do not have short hair). I'm sorry, but any barber that does not feel comfortable using scissors should not call themselves a barber. The whole time, I was faced AWAY from the mirror. I was faced towards a TV that was drowned out by another TV playing Russian programming. Thanks. Didn't really appreciate that.\n\nBest part- he CUT my neck with the clippers (in the middle of giving me this super sweet taper that I asked him not to do). I am still left with cut marks 2 days later.\n\n\n\nI beg any of you that is reading this review to avoid this shop.

Assumably it's to divide up the 21 on under crowds but i wouldnt know, maybe when it was designed in the early 70's or whenever these sort of 1/4 walls were all the rage, personally i'd just as soon knock it down and open up the space. meh no big.\nIf you are a music fan, and enjoy cheap stiff drinks, i'd say this is one of the many great venues in phx that can provide both in heavy doses.", "business_id": "JZJqJadk9pSoCGT7VTwBvg", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-08-19", "type": "review"}

There is no way to navigate the bar without getting bumped, bruised and spilling your drink on people. Largely because there are two barriers between the dance floor/seating area and the bar. This sets up an intersection between the server station, the dance floor, the bathrooms/patio and the bar. It sucks. I have witnessed creepy guys molesting women as they walk through this gauntlet.

It holds a total capacity of about 300 people and separates all ages (under 21 crowd) from the 21+ crowd. To a person under the age of 21, it seems like a awful place because they rope off that tiny section at the side of the stage. For someone over 21, it can be fun to watch a show because you have the entire front view of the stage, which is very low to the ground. Often times there is no use of barricades which allows for maximum interaction between the audience and performer. The drink selection at the full bar is awesome and they have great prices so you can afford to buy a drink after buying your ticket. For such a small venue, the parking lot is adequate. The acoustics aren't very good, but such an intimate venue creates and electrified environment. There are nearby bars and gas stations within walking distance if you don't want to drive home immediately after the show.

The next morning I called to check on my car and it was already fixed under warranty.  It was a worry free experience for me and I greatly appreciate it.  Since my service contract ran out I have taken it there previous to this visit for a 45,000 mile service and they fixed my daytime running lamp, oil change + tire rotation for free because they wanted to be as close to the estimate that they stated on the phone.
