The two of them kept me entertained all night long! I don't know which one was the funniest. Well, BJ wins hands down. \n\nWe pondered the wine bible for a bit, but BJ is a beer dude (they have a somewhat limited selection) and I am more of a cocktail girl. Loved the cosmopolitans there. Very delicious. \n\nWe bypassed the appetizers, we both got Morton's salads, which were huge. I had a single cut filet and a crab cake, BJ also got a filet and bacon wrapped scallops. Both our steaks were very flavorful and cooked to perfection. For our sides, we shared asparagus and a loaded baked potato. \n\nWe could not pass on dessert. I had to have Morton's Legendary Hot Chocolate Cake and BJ had the Key Lime Pie. The chocolate cake was amazing, I love it. So did BJ.  He ate it instead of his pie.  We got the pie to go and it was also very, very good. \n\nGreat place for a special occasion.

The host took our picture and it is hanging on our fridge right now, (which was never asked, he actually asked us if we wanted it.). Boom, girlfriend is happy. We start by splitting a salad which had a nice balsamic drizzle. Salad portions are nice and not that expensive. I chose the Cajun Rubbed Ribeye. Unbelievable. Changed everything I had previously thought of steak. She chose the filet mignon and I really couldn't decide who had the better steak. Except mine was bigger, so I chose mine. We had the Mac and cheese side, (which I devoured for lunch the following day) mushrooms (whaaaat? I need more) and gigantic asparagus. All amazing. To top off the night they sent out a molten chocolate cake which might have been the most magical thing in my life. What do you guys even put inside that? Unicorn blood? Come on.

For our entrees, we ordered the porterhouse steak with peppercorn rub and the 6 oz. filet mignon with shrimp and scallops.

The legendary steakhouse is supposedly the final word in steak outside of NYC and Texas. If this is the case then my oh my how the mighty have fallen. I have been to several Ruth's Chris locations around the PA, NY, and NJ area, but the one here in Market Square is truly a disappointment. \n\nWhen I go to a real steakhouse, like Peter Luger's, or the Old Homestead, or any other Ruth's Chris location I have visited, I expect to pay top dollar for top dollar steaks. I will never complain about the price so long as I feel as if the quality and quantity of food as well as the dining experience I recieve is fair in proportion to what I pay. The cheapest steak in the M2 Ruth's Chris will run you about thirty dollars. Normally, this would not be a problem had the establishment lived up to its reputation. Sadly, however, they did not.\n\nFirst, let's start with the decor. Ruth's Chris is a chain, first and foremost. That being said all locations are going to have the same basic look: old wood, magnum wine bottles, white tableclothes and red walls. I expect this sort of thing in a steakhouse. They are the last holdouts from the old industrial capitalist era. I feel as if I were to walk in, I might see Andrew Carneghie or John Rockefeller sitting at the bar discussing how unffair anti-trust legislation is.\n\nContinuing with the bar, Ruth's Chris offers a fantastic wine selection that has a pleasant mixture of affordable, yet quality, choices as well as a few that would cost me six months' rent. They also have a decent coctail menu, no doubt created by a corporate mixologist, that I must say is good. My girlfriend is not a fan because she can actually taste the alcohol in the majority of the concoctions, but I think that is a good thing. The bar is about the only place where you get the quality for the money you are spending.\n\nThe most dissappointing aspect about my last few visits have been the steaks. Ruth's Chris is known for basting their steaks in butter, which I do like. Fat is deliscious and that is proof enough for me that we are meant to eat it. This is where the goodness ends. On my second to last visit, a member of my party was served a rancid steak. The server tried to say it was dry-aged, but dry-aging does not produce a metallic, green beef. On my most recent visit, I was served a filet mignon that was tough. I have no idea how they were able to serve a tough portion of the least used muscle on the cow, but they did.\n\nAll of this brings me back to the service. I understand you are working in a fine dining, expensive steakhouse. I get that you throw down $300 plust dollar checks thirty or so times a night. I get that you are on first name basis with the Pens, Bucs, and Steelers that call themselves your regulars. That does not make me chop liver. I feel that if you are not wearing at least $3,000 worth of clothes or accessories, the staff will basically ignore you.\n\nThe saving grace to the place would be the bar and decor I already mentioned, and the sides. Ruth's Chris, like most fine dining establishments runs an a la carte menu. The sides are usually very very good. I like the sauteed mushrooms, sauteed spinache, lyonaise potatoes, macaroni and cheese, and the wedge salad.\n\nAll in all, this place gets a two in my book. I think that this is kind of sad given the fact that I was hoping to give them a five, but the quality of the food compared to what you pay just is not up to standard. For $250 I can feed and booze six friends at my house instead of me and my girlfriend at Ruth's Chris.", "business_id": "0FgwBx7pgmNdUtsd_T8UYQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-05-17", "type": "review"}

Ruth's Chris is nice, but still a steakhouse chain.  It's \"Pittsburgh fancy\".  As a non-eater of cow, everyone is slightly confused on why this place is one of my favorites, but between the service, the bar, and the dessert, it's difficult to find something you don't like.\n\nI usually opt for a bottle of moscato, but last opportunity, I ordered the peach pear martini.  It was light, but had a real pear flavor--not that perfume one that happens way too often.  You receive the entire shaker which is exciting (or sad that it excites me), almost always there is little bonus drink left.  The +1 had an \"In Fashion\":  pretty much an old fashioned with an orange liquor.  For a glass of mostly spirits, it was made well.\n\nAgain, I cannot vouch for the steak. 95% of those in my party cleared their steak plates (with only one slight complaint from Mr. N who had a little tiff that his butter did not sizzle for long enough, but that's a whole different issue).  They apparently do it well, with LOTS of butter.  Speaking of butter, they also cook their chicken (my main go to) in these heaps of fat, and it is the best thing that has ever happened to that bird.  I've never had chicken elsewhere as tender as this.  A bird with the consistency of a beef filet (at least what I remember) is only found at Ruth's Chris.  Don't forget you order the sides separately, and that is where they get you.  Do not order a side for every person.  You will have multiple boxes of mashed potatoes and an extra forty bucks on your bill.\n\nMost importantly, you gotta order dessert here.  It may look lame  with basic berries and cream, cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9e, ice cream, etc. \"Where is the bourbon salted caramel and hibiscus pate de fruits?\" In Lawrenceville, probably.  But that doesn't mean the staples here aren't just as rich and delicious.  To be totally honest, I come here for the cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9e. Vanilla bean custard under that torched sugar top and a side of berries is all I need.\n\nTo prove the real reason this place is great, a tidbit of the N family being a total mess.  Last visit we managed to break two wine glasses and spill a water (it was my sister, I swear), causing a commotion which required two servers, a busboy, tablecloths, and a new cocktail to help us get our lives together.  And the service remained great for the rest of the meal. I know most places of this old man meat club genre would not have appreciated this to the point of scorn for our table.  But no, this isn't stuffy enough for that somehow.  Good drinks, incredible desserts, and not nearly as much frou frou as other similar spots.

The smoked flavor is okay and the meat seems fresh, but where the hell is the flavor?  I can go as far as saying that I don't believe that they even season the burger with salt and pepper.  If I closed my eyes, it is possible that I wouldn't even know that it was a hamburger.  That is embarrassing.  Maybe if you're used to eating 99 cent burgers, Sysco \"meat,\" or at chain restaurants, then you would find this to be \"amazing.\"  I've had some of the best burgers at many cities in the US and this is an embarrassment to Pittsburgh.  Go to BRGR if you want a tasty burger near Bloomfield.  On the other end of the spectrum were the sides. The sides were classics, but definitely above average, especially the home fries.  I would consider a 1 star rating if it weren't for them.  Additionally, the place is overly crowded and had a long wait during the weekend. The decor is old school and seems satisfied in it's current state.  Just like the food itself.  File this one under Legacy restaurant still living on it's past accolades.", "business_id": "vgXE1I7c9ElcfYyZfQiN1Q", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-04-30", "type": "review"}

Bland would be an understatement. \n\nPoints for using fresh hand formed beef and consistently preparing it at the requested level of done-ness, but I don't know how the burger here even enter any debate regarding the best burger in the 'Burgh.

Parking is horrendous around here, so it might be better to take the bus anyways and do a bit of walking.\n\nAfter hearing so much about it, my friends and I came here to celebrate a birthday. Did it meet all the hype? Not so sure. The burgers good, but it wasn't anything spectacular as I thought it would be. Honestly, I like Burgatory a lot better. I ordered the Bacon Bleu Cheeseburger with dry bleu cheese. Probably mistake on my part. I thought the dry bleu cheese would be more crumbly and less creamy, but the heat of the burger melted it and it became creamy anyways (I dislike creamy things in general). Didn't enjoy the burger half as much because of that, but again mistake on my part. The home fries that came with it could have used some more seasoning, but with lots of ketchup it was tasty enough.\n\nThe service was up to par.

Delicious.\n\nFor the entree, I temporarily suspended my usual vegetarian-pescatarian diet for a Filet Oscar (filet with crab served on top).  Medium rare as requested, as was my fiance's delmonico.  Again, delicious.  I should also mention here that the potatoes au gratin side dish were phenomenal and highly recommended.\n\nAt the end of the meal, we were presented with a complimentary champagne toast and four mini \"pot o' creme\" desserts.

After about 15 minutes the host said he could seat us - we should have been suspicious at this point. We went outside to our table that had trash and leaves around the edges of the patio (hey, wait they didn't just blow there last night).  Our tablecloth had stains and spots on the silverware. \n\nIt took a good 15-20 minutes for our server to come take an order after bread and water were dropped. We asked to start with the fresh mozzarella, tomato, and basil with 12-year aged balsamic. When it arrived it was two neat stacks on one plate and one empty plate. When we asked the server why it was not split his response was \"we can't split this salad.\" Ok - not as if we asked to split an escargot- the salad was almost perfectly portioned for two. Not to bother we just shared. The sliced tomatoes were mealy and flavorless and only one leaf of basil per stack. There was a nice marinated grape tomato as a garnish but I didn't pay for a tasty garnish. \n\nThe main course we tried the grouper special. I've had better. The grouper was ok (notice the theme) but the shrimp that came with the special was overlooked and tough. Our sides - saut\u00e9ed spinach and the wild mushrooms were good. We ordered a 1/2 order of both which is just perfect for two people. My only comment is we pulled eight whole cloves of garlic out of the spinach before eating it. Vampires beware ,,,\n\nOur drinks were never tended too and the front server never bothered to follow up on the salad. I hope everyone inside had a better experience.", "business_id": "CChwRoYVXA3QZulS8a6xOQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-03-20", "type": "review"}

After a brief conversation with a foodie friend, I was directed to CG over Ruths Chris for a good steak experience. \n\nFood: 1 Star \n\nFor fancy steakhouses, I only have Flemings and Mortons to compare to. I also have the wise words of my father who always told me that only poorly cooked steaks need steak sauce. \n\nI've been to Flemings several times and every time it's always come seasoned perfectly. At Capital Grille in Charlotte, to my surprise and disappointment, I got a $60 bill and an unseasoned, tasteless steak to show for it.

I ended up using the bleu for my mashed potatoes which made those a total hit! \n\nBut to goto a fancy shmancy steakhouse where you (or your company) is charged an arm and a leg and they can't even properly cook your steak for you is just criminal.

But when you're on corporate account and/or just need to impress your lunch or dinner companions, it is very hard to go wrong here both in the wine and food departments.  And the jacketed dinner service?  Well, I always feel extremely well taken care of here.  \n\nAside from one of the best looking bars in all of uptown, the space is amazing, with a partially open kitchen with adjacent wine room and plenty of dark wood and rich, dense carpet.  It very much has that \"country club\" look and feel to it.  \n\nThat ambiance easily carries over to the menu, which is small but that just belies how big the typical portions are.  The same should be said for the calorie count of most offerings.  Friends, leave the diet at the door and prepare to splurge, it's just about impossible not to.  From the decadent lobster bisque soup to the crunchy, earthy goodness of truffled french fries, you simply can't stay within a reasonable calorie count for a proper meal here.  So just forget it, and enjoy.\n\nStandouts for me include the calamari, served with peppers which are not too hot but add a perfect tang to the rich savoriness of the batter than surrounds the actual rings and other bits of delicious seafood.  This could be a meal unto itself, yet it's just their most popular starter.  \n\nSteaks do reign on the entree menu, and I recommend going with the options which include the large chunks of fresh crab meat on top.  Why not take good to great?  But I am currently obsessing over the seared tuna with tri-dipping sauces and gingered rice.  Maybe it's the wasabi oil alone, with the palette cleansing bite that comes with every taste?  Whatever it is, I call it insane and it's a struggle not to order it again and again.\n\nBut you mustn't stop there, as dessert is just as over the top as everything else in the meal.  Mile-high cheesecake, a decadent chocolate layer cake, creme burulee, and more seasonal offerings.  One is typically plenty to share, or try a few and let the staff box it up for take-home enjoyment afterward.\n\nThe staff really cater to your special birthday and anniversary events, so long as you let them know ahead of time, so do share that at the time of reservation.  During late summer, they also have a wine event called The Generous Pour.  It's a fantastic deal that I highly recommend- wine all night long for a very reasonable beverage surcharge.  \n\nSo, chain or not, this place is great for putting on the swag and showing your guests or yourself a fancy meal out.  Something of a Charlotte staple now, these guys are setting a standard.", "business_id": "CChwRoYVXA3QZulS8a6xOQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-04-27", "type": "review"}

This has become something of a problem recently, as the Hereford Barn has closed down, and even several of the chain restaurants (Lone Star, Longhorn) have started closing too.  So I started looking about to find somewhere new to try.\n\nI finally settled on the Ranch House after reading some favorable reviews on the Internet.  I'm always a little leery about somewhere that I've never even seen, but I figured if we didn't like it, we could always turn around and go somewhere else.\n\nOnce inside, it's like you're transported back to a different time.  The dimly-lit interior could be from the 1950s (I'm guessing here).  The menu is relatively simple, with mostly steaks, and a bit of chicken and some seafood as well.  Steaks come with onion rings, salad, and your choice of baked potato or vegetable medley.\n\nIt is clear that the place makes their living cooking steaks, as there really isn't a lot of thought to the rest of the menu, so we decided to go that route.  One of the more intriguing options is the \"Dinner for 2\", which gives you a 22 ounce (sirloin) steak and all the fixings for two people, for a very reasonable price.  I also had a sirloin, the 10-ounce Ranch House Special.\n\nThe salads came out first - very quickly, I might add.  I chose the homemade blue cheese dressing, and it was awesome.  Easily the best blue cheese dressing I can ever remember having.  That really isn't saying much, as I can't remember ever having any other blue cheese dressing before, but it was really good.  I'd suggest going just for the dressing.\n\nThe steaks came out shortly after - really fast, in fact.  It seems that the fast cooking time is a direct relationship to the thickness of the steaks (they are very thin).  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, as a thin piece of meat can be good.  And it wasn't bad, exactly, but it didn't have a lot of flavor, either.  In fact, the steak from Upstream was better.  Odd.\n\nEven the service was great.  It was just that the steak wasn't, which was a shame.", "business_id": "OigTHfCur-D8Ne-bV1ngOg", "stars": 3, "date": "2007-04-08", "type": "review"}

Palm has been on my list for quite some time and C and I finally pulled the trigger last night.  Happy camper would describe us both, oh yeah, full would also work.\n\nStarted with the calamari just to see if it would be better than Del Frisco's.  Apples and oranges in terms of preparation but, it was crisply breaded, still tender and served with lemon and some awesome Marinara sauce.  Unless you have 4 - 6 people dining with you, get the small portion.  I didn't realize there was a small and goodness, the plate we got was huge and piled high.  Sounds good for lunch today though!\n\nWe both had salads, her's the mixed greens with garlic vinagrette and mine a Caesar.  Mine was good, her's was really good with the dressing being a star.\n\nFor dinner, I went all out with the surf and turf.  A NY Strip, medium rare and half a 3lb lobster.  This was as good or perhaps even better than any other strip I've had in town.  Almost butter knife tender, juicy, flavorful and cooked to the perfect temp.  Lobster was good just cause lobster IS good but there was nothing overly remarkable here.  Sweetie opted for the chicken parmigiana which was also a huge portion so there is half of that in the fridge too.  It was delicious and the marinara makes the dish.\n\nDessert was a shared fresh berries and creme anglais.  5 stars here for the perfectly chilled raspberries, blackberries and strawberries and a just sweet enough creme to dip them in.\n\nService was friendly, professional and not too stuffy the way it can feel at some other high end steakhouses in town.  She recommended a very good bottle of Pinot Noir at a reasonable price point which was a nice addition to the meal.\n\nExpensive?  Ummmmm, yes.  If you eat as described above you will be closing in on 3 bills, pre-tip.  BUT.... There are other options to choose that are much less expensive should you want to not blow up the Visa too badly and I am quite sure they are prepared just as well.

I had happy dreams for days....sigh....  \n\nThe app we got was the bacon-wrapped scallops - perfectly cooked and served on a bed of spinach.  Just fantastic.

A friend and I decided to give this place a try during the CIAA tournament, since it's away from uptown.\n\nWe arrived around 7:30 pm for our 8 pm reservations and we were seated just a little after 8.  Before being seated we had a few drinks at the bar and took in some of the decor.  The walls  were covered with various caricatures of celebrities, I thought that was a pretty cool thing to decorate the walls with.  The overall decor is very inviting, I think they may have outdone Morton's and Ruth Chris.\n\nThe food was excellent.  I ordered an 18 oz new york strip and I must say it's one of the best cooked steaks I've had in Charlotte.  The seasoning was perfect and they got the temperature perfect for a medium-rare steak. The potato and cream of spinach sides were really awesome and I just couldn't get enough of the flour-less chocolate cake.\n\nService was great.  Our waitress was very friendly, attentive and patient.  She had no problems with answering our questions about the various cuts of meat, the sauces or the lobster sizes.\n\nI don't have any negatives to report for this establishment and I will be returning many times in the future.

I had the caprese salad to start - it was $15 and consisted of two tomato slices (big, but flavorless) and buffala mozzarella (good not great).  My daughter had the bisque - flour-y and flavorless.  we had two NY strips and the prime rib.  The prime rib was HUGE and good.  The strips were okay - one was cooked medium well when ordered medium rare and one cooked correctly, but nothing much to it.

I have only eaten here twice and will base my review on the bar service/dining experience alone. I sat at the bar on a Sunday night with Shannon the best bartender. She is so personable and just great at her job.  If you go before 7 any day of the week the bar food is discounted to a very reasonable rate. I tried the lobster roll and the steak sliders. Both pretty delicious. We also tried the beer carpaccio off the regular menu because I love beef carpaccio. A lot. A whole lot. The regular diner menu is a bit pricey but that's to be expected with these types of establishments. The carpaccio was amazing and the arugala salad on top of it was delicious. With the carpaccio I wish they didn't put grated parm on it (I felt it cheapened it-just go with the shaved fresh parm and call it done!) and there were no capers. I am used to having capers on carpaccio but to each his own. \n\nFor dessert (which I usually skip) I went with Shannon's glowing recommendation of the doughnuts. Oh. My. God. They are hot and fresh and delicious. Rolled in cinnamon sugar they come with two dipping sauces and some whipped cream. These are made for splitting I would assume because there were a lot of holes.

It comes with a shrimp appetizer, soup, salad, vegetables (broccoli, zucchini, carrots, and mushrooms), and white rice (you can get an order of fried rice for $1.75 extra). \n\nI thought the shrimp was good, and the chef did a little trick flipping the shrimp tails into a used bowl, one into his pocket, and one into his hat.

The food also seemed to take a really long time to come out, about 45 mins for a steak with fries and riblets with fries, it may have actually been closer to an hour.\n\nIf you're in the area and in a bind to find something to eat, I recommend that you either find somewhere else to go or just save your money and hit one of the local grocery stores.  Since Applebee's is a chain, I don't think Kitchen Nightmares will be coming to save them :)", "business_id": "98hOHm56D0Boz2LCg0-irg", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-03-26", "type": "review"}

The portions were small and the peppers, mushrooms and onions that were with my tips were overcooked and soggy and the steak was overcooked.  I was bummed.

We originally tried Buck and Honey's, but they were packed and the hostess was kind of rude. So we drove around, hoping for inspiration to strike. I'd eaten at McGovern's years before but couldn't finish my dish that time because it was too salty for human consumption. I don't hold that against them at all since I was pregnant at the time and my tastebuds were unreliable witnesses. \n\nThis visit I had the haddock ($13 or very close to it). My friends both had steaks, and they both were very pleased. My piece of fish was enormous. I'm a good eater, but I had to take some home (it heated up very nicely for lunch the next day). I also had a very nice baked potato, and we all had a trip to the salad bar. \n\nThe salad bar was 100% true to its supper club environment. Sliced eggs, cheese, mushrooms, iceberg lettuce, cottage cheese, packaged crackers, things that might have been Bac-Os (remember those?). It also had some more interesting items like peas and sliced beets. It was stuck over in this weird little alcove and seemed like it might be difficult if there were multiple people trying to hit it at the same time, but it definitely offered quite a bit. \n\nI'd eat here again. That fish made me happy, and I loved the open kitchen with its 70s-era wall covering (total cross between industrial kitchen and grandma's place from your childhood).", "business_id": "zgxNUxS8eIyhkrXegDLtjQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-04-06", "type": "review"}

We knew what we were getting ourselves into, going to an Applebee's and whatnot, but what transpired was so ridiculous, I expected Ashton Kutcher (or at least the host of \"How to Catch a Predator\") to pop out and we all LOL about how horrible the experience was.  Instead, I left the restaurant with an empty feeling in my heart, as a wave of sadness washed over me knowing I had just lost two hours of my life inside a low-rate Applebee's.\n\nWe were first greeted by a host who didn't greet us. He showed us to our table, set down the menus, and sidled back over to the host stand without making a sound.  In fact, I can't be positive he wasn't a ghost sentenced to life in purgatory as an Applebee's host. However I forgot to check if his feet were floating or walking, so we'll never be sure.\n\nThe waitress seemed nice enough, but it soon became evident that this woman was about to have a serious breakdown and that we were about to be her therapists, whether we liked it or not (we didn't).\n\nShe came back with our drinks after a bit of a wait saying, \"it's like pulling teeth to get that bartender to make us drinks, we even have to have the manager back there making them too!\".  Very professional.  As she was taking our order, I asked her if she knew whether or not a particular menu item had red dye, as I have an allergy. She was going to check in the kitchen. \"Be right back!\" she said, and we believed her.  Five minutes later, we see her emerge from the kitchen, taking food out to other tables, filling waters, and taking more drink orders to the surly bartender.  She returned to our table in a huff, her response to my red dye inquiry was severely alarming.  \"The chef says there's no way for us to know if it has dye it in or not.  We'd have to go look it up somewhere, so he said you just shouldn't order it.\"  Now I'm not under any sort of delusion that Applebee's is the kind of restaurant where the produce comes in fresh every morning, and the chefs have been trained in the French Alps.  However, I would expect at least *some* transparency, or you know, maybe just go look it up.  \n\nAs we started to order our food (maybe without red dye, who knows?!), the day started to really fall apart.  First of all they were out of mozzarella sticks.  As we all know, mozzarella sticks are among the top 3 reasons to go to Applebee's, along with $2 long islands and 1/2 priced apps after 10 pm.  The waitress tried to explain to us their newly revamped appetizer menu (albeit without mozzarella sticks) but had no clue what she was talking about.  Somehow she walked away after telling us the particular items we ordered could not come out simultaneously, and whatever was ready first was going to come out.  This came down to me getting my entree before my friends' appetizers came, and my friends' entrees coming out about 45 minutes after everyone else had finished their meal.\n\nThroughout the whole meal, and I use \"meal\" loosely because we had nothing to eat for the majority of the time, we could hear the waitstaff going around to every table apologizing for something.  It was complete disarray.  \"Sorry for the wait, we are so busy!\" (as we're surrounded by empty tables), \"There's a 15 minute wait for drinks, because we only have 1 blender!\" (like, what?)  Not to mention they were spilling drinks, precious 15-minute wait drinks, everywhere.  The manager dumped an smoothie on someone's lap, a waiter spilled a drink all over an empty booth (which the mute host then sat a family at before it was cleaned, and a woman sat directly in the puddle), and another waitress was dribbling Bloody Marys across the restaurant at a rate so fast, you'd have thought it was a scene from Dexter. We were being patient, but other tables weren't as gracious.  One man walked up to the bar to get his table's drinks after they sat untouched for 10 minutes.  That guy was cool: he really tore into the manager for being so unorganized and they had to get another waitress.\n\nWe put in an order for another round of drinks, and hunkered down for the extreme wait that was likely to follow.  10 minutes later (we got lucky!) she came back with one too many margaritas.  \"Oh gosh!  You only ordered two of those right? Oh okay... well, this one is on me!\" which was nice enough, except she went on to complain about what a horrible day she was having, and how her whole life was ruined because another waitress made her switch sections.  \n\nBy the time the final entrees surfaced, we had them boxed up immediately to leave.  It took 30 minutes from the time we asked for the check to the time she brought it out, after being there for 2 hours.  The cherry on top was when she took $3 out of her own tips and laid it on the table for the extra margarita. That had to have been one of the most absurd things I'd ever seen.  Couldn't she just take it off our bill? Like we're really going to take your $3 off the table.\n\nAnyway, food was", "business_id": "JdCFcgw4yk4M1ZRhAhBIag", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-03-02", "type": "review"}

When living in Madison years ago, we used to hit all the great fish fries on the lakes around town. And while spending 10 years in Hayward, we used to live for Fridays at Lost Land Lake Lodge and later The Waterfront. Living in Utah for over 20 years, my opportunities are few and far between. So I was excited to have a free Friday in Madison to try the very best. Reading online reviews, going off my past knowledge and talking to friends, I made the tough call between the Avenue Bar (one of my favorite lunch spots) and the Esquire Club. We chose the Esquire.\n\nI hadn't been in the club in probably 30-35 years. Overall, it was a good experience. But it wasn't close to the level to which I'm accustomed to in Hayward on our three or four trips out there a year. We had a great time and I highly recommend it, but we would make another choice next time.\n\nThe bar at Kavanaugh's Esquire Club is great - a full horseshoe with plenty of seating. We arrived around 5:30 p.m. on a Friday in Lent. It was packed already, as was every spot in the parking lot. We put our name in and were told it would be 20 minutes for our party of two. We were seated in just ten.\n\nOne of the challenges with the Esquire is it just doesn't have a lot of natural atmosphere. The main room with the bar is fabulous. But the other dining rooms are really plain with not a single thing on the wall. The table settings are nice. And outside, it's a totally blah building. Out the back door to the parking lot was an attractive collection of a few hundred cigarette butts sitting on the sidewalk and snowbank.\n\nThe tables are pre-set with great, fresh rye bread and fabulous cole slaw. And we had quick attention from our waitress. The host gave us menus - actually three stapled, photocopied sheets - pretty tacky (I noticed others did get regular menus). It's a full supper club menu with multiple choices for fish fry. We opted for the $9.95 all-you-can-eat ocean perch. What was notable to me as that the current Web page for Esquire lists the price at $8.95. Not good. Cod was also available at a slightly higher price.\n\nThe bread and slaw kept us entertained and both were world class. A heaping plate of fish and crinkle fries arrived in good time (beating the Coke our grandson ordered 15 minutes earlier). We had to ask for lemons.\n\nThe fish was very good - I love perch. But as good as it was, it simply wasn't at the presentation and taste level of what we traditionally get at The Waterfront in Hayward, for example. It was a simple cornbread-type breading that was good, but somewhat uninteresting - not the flamboyant texture of the beer battered fish we have grown to expect.\n\nNonetheless, we polished off the fish, got a few more fries and a chocolate mousse desert. The bill for two with a few beers and desert was just under $40.\n\nLater that night, we also hit the Beachhouse in McFarland, another popular local spot. My wife had dinner there with a friend. This is an awesome place with a ton of atmosphere and great fish.\n\nEsquire Club Summary (five point scale)\nExterior: 2 - Pretty plain building; cigarette butts not pretty\nInterior atmosphere: 3 - Main bar room is great\nFood: 4 - Good was great, not overally thrilled with fish batter\nService: 3 - Generally good, but shouldn't have to wait for main course to get a Coke\nValue: 5 - $9.95 for an all-you-can-eat fish fry at this level is outstanding", "business_id": "68JsiWNLKs8NDCrBCxIWMA", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-03-06", "type": "review"}

I've had 15 minute waits even with a reservation, and 45 minutes plus without. I don't believe they take any reservations on Saturday, so expect a wait.\n \nAmbiance/decor isn't the best, sure, but it serves its purpose. The clientele is comprised largely of older Illini fans, so it works for the Ribeye to have pictures of Illini teams from their glory days. \n\nThe service here is fantastic. The servers are professional, polite, friendly, and attentive without being overbearing. \n\nAbout the food... Well, when you go to a place called \"The Ribeye,\" you should probably be in the market for a ribeye. Sure, there's chicken and shrimp, but the ribeye is their pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance. Honestly, when I started going to the Ribeye around 5 years ago, I feel like the steaks used to be higher quality, which is what keeps me from giving them a 5. Still, the ribeye is brought out on a hot cast-iron skillet/plate, and that sizzle alone can make my mouth water. I recommend either ordering one degree of cooking lower than your normal preference (i.e., if you like medium-rare steaks, order rare) to compensate, or eat your steak as soon as it's served. The highlight for me, however, is the salad bar. There's iceburg lettuce and the standard salad toppings to make your own,  or an array of pasta, bean and potato salads (most of which are, indeed, covered in mayonnaise). My personal favorite is comprised of green peas, peanuts, cheddar cheese, bacon and ranch dressing. Is it haute cuisine? No. But it is solid, simple, and delicious. Also awesome - the croutons, made from the leftovers from the fresh French or wheat bread brought to your table.\n\nThe price isn't terrible. Two people with soft drinks and before tip comes out to $42. The Ribeye isn't world-class, five-star dining, but it does offer good steaks, great salad options, and pleasant service.", "business_id": "SoyigEmlt4JYwnOqR_cqUw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-03-16", "type": "review"}

Harsh but true. I feed my dog steak once a year for his birthday and the low grade steak I get from my butcher for him is better than this. Also I am glad that I read some reviews on here before I went because they serve the steak on a frying pan that is cast iron and very, very hot. The result I ordered my steak rare expecting it to come out medium rare it was closer to medium and by the time I was finished with a 12 oz. it was going towards medium well. \n\nThe salad bar was the only redeeming quality. It had a fairly decent selection of different salads; such as pasta salad, potato salad and so forth. The basic salad is a kind of build your own house salad with a few simple dressings and a large variety of toppings that are typical in the Midwest.

However, the restaurant itself is very clean. \n\nThe salad bar is my favorite -- always fresh, crisp and cold. I can't overstate the freshness -- you constantly see employees changing the salads.

I'm a huge fan of everything on that salad bar, especially the cucumber salad and the herring salad (but you just might have to be Eastern European to appreciate pickled herring with onions in mayo). \n\nFor being a Ribeye lover, I actually don't like the steaks at the Ribeye. I really like thick-cut steaks cooked med rare, and you will never get anything below a med well steak at this place. However, the steaks are always juicy and full of flavor. They're served on a hot skillet (which I find questionable, but again, it's part of the experience). I always get the grilled chicken with extra barbecue sauce.

Over time I've began to realize that some people don't know what good food is...now without calling me an A-hole, hear me out. Everything is bland and unseasoned here; steaks are traditionally brought out with the texture of shoe leather, God forbid there be any juice left in the steak. Salad bar is eh, it's big and if big means good then I guess it's great. As one person posted before it will probably be gone in 10-15 years when a majority of their patrons have passed away, though I would like to say they are probably right, there is a new crop right around the corner that will still view the ribeye as a special treat. You don't have to reinvent the wheel but for Petes sake if you are going to specialize in steak serve a great steak (I'm looking at you, Beef House, as well).

This is not that kind of place, although it thinks it is. The menu offers three options: ribeye, chicken, or shrimp. Seeing as they specialize in ribeyes, I would think they would know how to cook one. I ordered mine medium, expecting a juicy, pink center. I ended up with a very well done steak that was mostly devoid of flavor. Part of the problem is due to the fact that the steaks are served on a hot skillet-plate, which obviously continues to cook the steak as it comes out to you. If you plan on ordering a steak here, I recommend asking for it rare so that by the time it arrives at the table, it's not completely over-cooked.\n\nI understand that the salad bar is a big draw for some people. There is a huge selections of different \"salads\" that you might find at a church potluck (i.e., all sorts of salads that involves pasta, mayo, and other things that are not lettuce). If you want a lettuce salad, there is a large bowl of crisp iceberg with tomato slices carefully arranged in a cylinder, stacked like citrusy bricks. \n\nI imagine the baked potato is fine, because you can't really do a whole lot to mess it up. I ordered the steak fries, which weren't seasoned at all. One of my dinner companions commented that they tasted a lot like the frozen french fries that you bake in your oven at home. \n\nThe decor was hilarious incongruous with the prices. From the look of the place, you'd think you were at a small town seniors restaurant that served plain chicken with a side of canned corn. Then you look at the menu and the three dinners cost between $16-23. It didn't bother me a lot, but it was amusingly awful in terms of ambience.\n\nI don't mean to trash this place too much though. The service was great, and the staff were very accommodating. I was there for a graduation party, and I called in advance to see if they would allow me to bring in cupcakes. I've seen other Champaign-Urbana restaurants add a plating charge for any outside food, if they allow it at all. The Ribeye said it was no problem. I have to give them props for being cool about everything.\n\nOverall, I can't really recommend this. You can get a mediocre steak for a lot less. If you do end up going, just make sure you either order the steak less done that you want it, or be very clear with the waitress as to what medium or medium rare means to you (and be prepared to send it back).

I had brain freeze and forgot the local spots I love so much that grill a mean meat (i.e. Phoenix City Grill), so the first restaurant past Target that fit the bill was our local Applebee's on Camelback and Central. Mind you, I don't expect a decor marvel or a hostess so hip it hurts. I know what i'm getting myself into. For the most part.

Once our iced teas and the new appetizer (tuscan cheese bread extravangza) arrived we sipped and dipped.

The asparagus was limp like, well, let's just say it reminded me of a Vietmanese gymnast I once dated who didn't take the little blue pill. Sides included mashed potatoes (loaded) which means bacon, cheese and sour cream. Ok, Ok, Ok, too much of the extras. What ladle in the kitchen did they pick to put these extras on my mashed potatoes? All in all, I had low expectations at this venue, and they were met. Shout out to Mo the server, a good gal!

My partner loves some of that! I really shouldn't eat it and it's where?\nClose to home. How much do we have to pay for it? $7 maybe less.  Really? \n\nThe place does look divey and we might not have tried it without Yelp. Got a parking place right up near the door, sauntered into the Texaz . Noted the armadillos and horned toads scaling the ceiling, the hats, the bric a brac, the country music, the beer signs. More condiments on the table than I'm used to. Lea and Perrins, Heinz 57 Steak Sauce, A-1, Ketchup, mustard, Tabasco, another hot sauce, jar of chili's, Sugar pourer, salt, pepper, and a caddy of pink sugar packets. \n\nThe waitress was right on cue, with menu and kid menu, a cup of crayons and no rush. Drinks came immediately. We ordered some chili frito's (in the bag) a chicken fried chicken, a chicken fried steak and a pork chop all with mashed potatoes, corn and white gravy and totally tasty biscuit.  Frito-bag chili came out first and was yummy, we all shared. Dinner came just as our bag o' chili was gone. It was hot and ready. My partner absolutely loved the gigantic chicken fried steak, my chicken was moist and all white meat juicy. The corn had that roasted buttery flavor I adore. The drinks never languished. The server was always available but never invading our space. Pacing and food and price couldn't be beat. Those were very good mashed potatoes! No one had any leftovers to take home. My daughter even ate almost every bite and she had ordered an adult meal!\n\nIt was too late when I noticed the oyster po'boy special... shoot! I'll have to come back. And then I'll have to come back again because with three steak sauce choices maybe I should have bought a steak? There is an ad on the table that they serve the cheapest steak for your money. I have to know if it's tasty and not just cheap.\n\nCouldn't leave without  a dessert. We also couldn't pick between pecan pie and bread pudding so we left it up to our server. She brought us out  a 3 1/2 inch square of very hot sweet, drenched in sauce bread pudding. Very Yummy!\n\nOur bill was light and our tummies were heavy and we left with a five star feeling. However I had to remove a star because an hour after we ate we both suffered some gastric distress and frequent visits to our private bathroom. I still will return, because it can happen anywhere and there was a lot of dairy in that gravy and in the potatoes, so it's partly our fault, but I had to mention it to be fair in the review.\n\nStill...If what you are seeking is down home food, not counting the calories or concerned about the cholesterol, just come on in and eat it up! It's some tasty Texaz.\n\nUpdate: Went for dinner this time, and the service wasn't near as good, prices were much higher than food value and as such it wasn't worth the bill price. We know now that you should order the specials, those are generally good deals and come at lunch. The mashed potato was still stellar but the gravy was too thick to move. My Prime Rib was +30% fat and that left me with a much smaller portion than I expected. My partners steak DID need the steak sauces, so it's not that they have fabulous NY strip. Docked one star off my original 4 star rating. Come if you want hearty lunch foods though, then it's worth it.", "business_id": "18TUn9oiW0k0yB6lheiOvw", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-05-20", "type": "review"}

Not just music, but people talking loudly as well. The walls beyond covered in \"stuff\", things like dollar bills, stuffed dead animals, panties, pictures, license plates, I guess the closest thing you could guess in theme would be \"trailer park\". \n\nThe waitress was not accommodating to the noise, and spoke mostly in a whisper. She spent most of the time looking annoyed, speaking in a low voice that we could barely hear, and acting spastic (not taking our orders in an orderly way, bringing some food but not all that we had ordered, refilling some drinks but not others, etc). \n\nI ordered the Prime Rib, rare, with mashed potatoes. It came with a side salad consisting of iceberg lettuce, diced tomatoes, and minced green olives. An odd combination. The prime rib was overly marinated in \"smoke flavor\" and had more flavor reminiscent of ham than of prime rib. It was a good portion. The mashed potatoes were dry and partially cold, not very flavorful. I requested no gravy, yet my mashed potatoes still had that dip in them where you would normally put gravy, meaning I had a very small portion of mashed potatoes (that you probably don't notice when you get gravy). \n\nMy girlfriend had the same thing I did but medium instead of rare like I did, everyone else in the party had the chicken fried steak. My girlfriend was as disappointed in her food as I was. Everyone who ordered chicken fried steak loved it. It really is a giant portion, two, three servings really. Most everyone took some of theirs home. Though the two people from texas said it wasn't the best chicken fried steak they'd ever had, and I'd take that recommendation into consideration. Texas people know their chicken fried steak. \n\nFor dessert my girlfriend and I shared the peach cobbler. This menu description is inaccurate, its more akin to yellow cake with peach filling. Tasty, but not what we expected. They do use blue bunny ice cream though, which is awesome. \n\nAbout an hour after dinner my girlfriend and I both felt a little sick from dinner.

They even brought us out some sour cream because they didn't have horseradish sauce.\n\nGood stuff, I really liked their gravy.", "business_id": "18TUn9oiW0k0yB6lheiOvw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-03-02", "type": "review"}

Our actual waitress was nice enough, thankfully. Desserts were consumed in spite of being stuffed from the nice entrees.\n\nWhen we finished we sat a bit and talked. The hostess approached and brought a bag for the leftover boxes. It was clear she wanted us OUT. My friend asked for water and the hostess said hotly, \"To GO?\" My friend said no, and that hostess was preeeeetty huffy about it. I don't know if she's the owner's wife, or what, but someone who thinks she can behave that way to customers needs to be spoken to.", "business_id": "18TUn9oiW0k0yB6lheiOvw", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-03-16", "type": "review"}

I have been enjoying their CFS since they were Lone Star (over 20 years).  \n\nMy wife and I stopped in this past Saturday (03/22/2014) for an early lunch.  We were immediately \"greeted and seated\".\n\nOur server came by for our drink order and I also ordered a cup of the \"Sopa de Fidello\" (my main reason for this visit).  The soup came and was very, very good.   I normally get a cup of their wonderful chili, but I really wanted to try this soup after reading the description on line.  I wasn't disappointed in the least.  Chunks of ham, vegetables, and the video noodles; all in a spicy, savory broth.  I would love a big bowl of this soup and some wonderful chewy, crusty bread on a cold winters night (yes, I know I'm in Phoenix, but I can dream...).\n\nBoth my wife and I had a salad w/ the house dressing and the lunch sized Chicken Fried Steak.  I love the house dressing at TEXAZ.  My wife (a former ranch dressing girl) now orders the house dressing, it's so good. The salad is evenly coated w/ dressing, and there is never a glob of it on the plate when you're done.\n\nWhat can I say about the CFS, that hasn't been said many times before...it was perfect as usual.  The CFS came w/ mashed potatoes, corn, and a biscuit.  The steaks were hanging over the sides of the plate.  Fresh, hot and perfectly seasoned.  I have tried this dish at other restaurants, only to be disappointed w/ the food. \n\nI didn't get the name of our server, but she was great.  She came and checked on us regularly and was pleasant and quick w/ the tea refills.\n\nYet another great meal at one of my favorite restaurants...\n\nI think there are many restaurants here in the valley that could learn something from TEXAZ and their longevity here in a place known for \"here today and gone tomorrow\".\nQuality and consistency.  Start w/ quality ingredients and quality people; and keep it consistent.", "business_id": "18TUn9oiW0k0yB6lheiOvw", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-03-25", "type": "review"}

We were lucky enough to get a spot in the back after a minute's wait (otherwise it would have been very hard to get out of there). But once we were inside, the food was exactly as promised. We started with a side of fried okra. Yum. Awesome breading, everything fresh and hot.\n\nMy husband ordered the lunch version of chicken-fried steak. He was in heaven. I tried a small bite. I'm not usually a fan of chicken fried steak, but it was fabulous.\n\nMy options were a little limited because I can't do really heavy fried stuff. I had the Dallas Tacos. They were good. Nothing spectacular but still satisfying. Let's face it--no one is coming here for tacos! Check out the Yelp photo gallery to see my plate.\n\nI usually don't do dessert out, but bread pudding is my Kryptonite. Too many people on Yelp praised this dessert dish, and with reason. My word. The bread pudding was sweet, firm, and delicious. We ordered it with the scoop of ice cream, which ended up being HUGE. Texas-sized. The whiskey sauce on top is luscious.\n\nIn the rare event that we're back in this part of Phoenix, we will definitely stop here.

I enjoy this place but just can't come here to often. TEXAZ is an unassuming place on the outside and settled in a very tight corner of the shopping center. Like I said very unassuming. Once you walk in then BOOM. It's like a time warp taking you back to Texas in the 1970's. Place is decorated with old pictures related to Texas, road signs, animal heads, caps, and old license places. Very interesting and very loud. Everyone talking, eating, and having a good time. \n\nWe started out with our usual fries okra. This is the only place I can find fried okra in AZ. Nice change of pace. Love the okra. Nice and crisp. Love it. So I ordered their famous Chicken Fried Steak. They say it's the best in AZ and I can't disagree. All meals comes with a side salad. Salad doesn't look that appetizing but it's not bad. House dressing is pretty good. Anyways, the CFS comes with two huge pieces hanging off the plate smothered with gravy and comes with mash potatoes. Very crispy and fresh. Not greasy at all. Really good. Best in AZ hands down. Only problem is that it's too much food. I couldn't even come close to to finishing it. I saw two guys at a table across from us share an order of CFS. Very smart and would probably recommend sharing this huge meal. My wife ordered the Fried Catfish. Two large pieces of fish with a side of mash potatoes. Wife loved it. Not greasy at all. Fresh and moist but again a lot of food. So good. Everyone's ordering the CFS and fried catfish. There's a reason. \n\nMy son ordered the prime rib regular cut. Really big piece of meat with a side of mash potatoes. My son really liked the prime rib. He's a fussy eater and he really like the prime rib. So when he likes it then I know it's really good. Looked juicy and fresh. \n\nWe were stuffed with all this food. Packed up our leftovers but you can't leave this place without dessert. We shared the pecan pie. Oh my gosh. Your probably laughing right now but this is the best pecan pie. Had pecan pie from Texas and all over and this is the best I've had. It had a hard topping that most pecan pies don't have. A little chewy and not as sweet as most pecan pie. Crust is outstanding. Hands down yummy. \n\nSo the food was really really good. The service was also outstanding. Once we sat down our server was there for our drink orders. Food was brought to our table really fast and they cleaned off our dirty dishes very quickly. We also had our server and owner check on us to make sure everything is okay. Everyone makes you feel at home just like in Texas. \n\nSo good food (aka little too much), good service, and good dessert. Enjoy and bring a wheel barrow to roll you out.

We started with fried okra & beer battered shrimp and for our main course we had the chicken fried steak, chicken fried chicken and brisket sandwich. From the kids menu, we ordered  smoked prime rib. And for dessert we ordered the peach cobbler.\n\nFor starters, the biscuits and rolls we got didn't taste fresh, in fact, they tasted like they'd been warmed up in a microwave. Already a terrible start. But it did get better with our apps. The fried okra was very good, the okra was ripe, not at all bitter. The beer battered shrimp was also very good, light batter, fresh shrimp, our meal was looking better.\n\nThen dinner came, the chicken fried chicken was delicious, the chicken was juicy and battered very nicely. My chicken fried steak however, was very bland and there was so much more batter than meat. The gravy was very good and sort of made up for the steak. The brisket sandwich was very dry so we ordered a side of BBQ sauce, without it, it wasn't very appetizing, with it, it was pretty darn good, nothing fancy, just a lot of brisket and bread. The smoked prime rib from the kids menu was OK. It had a lot of fatty parts, I may be biased as I'm not a prime rib fan though. We could definitely taste the smoky flavor. We ordered a side salad with both steak dinners and they both tasted like bagged salad. Nothing great about the dressings either. The mashed potatoes that came with the steaks were pretty good, they had skin pieces which I personally love. No gravy, but I prefer mashed potatoes without so I was happy there.\n\nMy favorite dish of the evening was the peach cobbler. The peaches weren't fresh, they were frozen so I was slightly disappointed but the crust part made up for it. The crust, made from their biscuit batter, was slightly sweet and tasted just right with the peaches and vanilla ice cream, (adding ice cream is $1 extra).\n\nOverall, I didn't hate this place but I certainly didn't love it.

We were given a fabulous booth with a lovely girl named Desiree.  She brought our drinks right away and took our order with no delay. She even asked if we had questions about the menu or anything else. Which my friend did and she knew all the answers. How wonderful to get such great service!

It is a very nice restaurant and is very tastefully decorated. Was not sure of the food when we sat down to order.\n\nI looked at the Menu and decided to have the \"Lobster & Crab Burger\".

We looked a each other and thought that at $19 a pop for a burger it better be good.\n\nFirst the fries came. Not sure if it was the hunger that was clouding the judgement but the fries were presented very nicely and were cut thin and crispy as I like it. So far so good.\n\nThe the well dressed butler (yes) served the burger with a bow and whispered \" Enjoy you meal sir\" lightly into my ears. \n\nThe burger was open faced with one half of the burger bread outside and the other half had this nice looking chunk of lobster and crab cake blended with Old Bay seasoning with a side of freshly prepared tartar sauce. \n\nI tell you this was the best tasting crab & lobster cake I have ever had.

Now let me start on the food. I ordered the clam chowder followed by the Mini tenderloin sliders with green beans. The clam chowder was mediocre nothing to write home about, the sirloin sliders were ok. While one of my sliders was cooked to the perfect medium rare as I had asked the other one was closer to medium well and a little charred. The green beans while they did have great flavor they were unfortunately not very hot. John ordered the clam chowder followed by the Wagyu Cheeseburger and truffle Fries. The cheeseburger was overcooked he has asked for a medium and it came out well, the fried egg on top was not cooked nearly enough if it were mine I wouldn't of been able to eat it because it looked way to slimey, the truffle fries were about the only thing that was tasty on his plate.

I feel under charged. \n\nI love the location, the Biltmore is my fave! Easy parking, lovely staff and valet, just great. We parked in the metered lot, but you get 2 hours free with validation, easy. The hostess was just adorable, took us on the scenic route to our table; it was very busy at the time so we were avoiding a large party receiving their entrees. \n\nThe wine list is extensive, anyone can find something they will love. The prices are very good! We got a bottle of the of an Italian red wine $30, it was great! We each started with a salad, a Cesar and a field green salad. I loved the field greens, the dressing on it was just perfect, peppery and light! He loved his Cesar. Then we both picked the fillet for our entree; to die for. First is was cooked exactly as we asked, and practically melted in my mouth. Delish! They came with mashed potatoes and green beans. Both excellent! Couldn't have made them better!\n\nThen..... my favorite part.... dessert! We got one of each to share; Creme Brule and Flour-less Espresso Chocolate Cake. I could literally eat that Creme Brule everyday of my life and it still wouldn't be enough. Amazeballs! The cake was very tasty, but being a flour-less cake is was incredibly rich, very good though!\n\nThe service was excellent!

After my visit, why did I wait so long to try here?\n\nThey have complimentary valet, and I recommend using this service.  Parking across is $2 or free with validated ticket for up to two hours, or park so far away and walk... or just pull up by the entrance and enjoy great valet service.  When we finished dining, the server suggested to give the valet ticket to him so by the time we were outside, the car was already ready waiting and we didn't have to wait for a few mins.  Very nice service, especially when I didn't want to walk more than 10 steps with my heels.\n\nWe arrived a few mins before our reservation time. It was Saturday peak dinner and they were busy.  We found two stools in the bar area and started enjoying our drink. The bartender was very nice and offered complimentary bar nuts.  They were sweet and spicy, so yummy I thought I could get addicted to this nuts.\n\nThey had our table ready 20 mins after our original reservation time, and apologized for the delay.  They offer black or white linen cloth napkins depending on the colors of your clothes.\n\nFor the restaurant week 2015 menu, they have a choice of salad (wedge or caesar) or soup. Entree of two types of steak, fish, and can't remember the last one. Entree comes with two side dishes of mushed potato and sauteed green beans.  To finish the meal, they had three different choice of desert.\n\nWedge salad I had was very good, creamy dressing complimented lettuces and crispy bacon.  I actually became full just after finishing the salad. (Must be the bar nuts? or could be large lunch I had earlier).  I ate about 1/3 of my steak. Too bad I wasn't hungry enough to finish it. They used very good beef. I could taste a very good beef.  I asked them to put my desert to go as I couldn't even eat my steak, but I tasted my friend's desert, Cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e.

The ambiance is great, the location ideal, and the food and service are, well, ok. To be brutally honest, I've only dined at a Darden restaurant twice in the past few years, and when my experience concluded, I understood why I won't again--there are better steakhouses in the Valley that out-compete The Capital Grille.\n\nThe experience wasn't as crisp and exacting as it should be for a higher-end restaurant. With the prices and reputation The Capital Grille has garnered since first opening its doors in 1990, my minimum expectation is perfection. Anything above perfection earns my loyalty. \n\nWe waited a bit too long for our table at 8:30 on a Saturday night, and we would have enjoyed sitting on the patio, but the offer wasn't extended. The restaurant didn't appear to be too busy as there were plenty of open tables, and I doubt there were many reservations after us, so why make your guests wait? Is the need to convenience your staff more important than to convenience your patrons? Food for thought. \n\nAgain, the fifteen minute wait for our bottle of Malbec to hit the table was just unnecessary. Maybe they had to stomp some grapes in the back. Maybe there's a lack of urgency. Whatever it is, it detracts from the experience. \n\nThe bone-in sirloin left much to be desired. Though cooked properly, the lack of seasoning and flavor were disappointing. Why I ordered a sirloin, I do not know. I think my mind saw 'bone-in' and equivocated it with a rib-eye. I had a couple bites of my girlfriend's filet, which was excellent. \n\nIn conclusion, if you have money for the finer things in life, go with the finest.

It's all about the beef here, and if that's not what you are seeking, you'll be left wondering what the fuss is about. \n\nI know, it's a chain, it's as un-hip as it comes, but some days the dark \"good ol' boys\" atmosphere is perfect for tucking oneself away in a booth and devouring a hunk of beef and bottle of wine.

Overall, we had an excellent meal. \n\nHubby had the gumbo as a starter. It was very flavorful, but had a little less heat than he would have preferred- maybe with the addition of a couple of dashes of Tabasco, he said, it would have been awesome. I had the Caprese salad with thick slices of beautifully ripe and flavorful beefsteak tomato, buffalo mozzarella, fresh basil, and a nice balsamic vinaigrette dressing. I appreciated that they let the tomato and mozzarella be the star by not drowning it in dressing. I absolutely loved the addition of a big piece of flash fried basil, which is something I have seen done a few times on cooking shows recently. Unexpectedly scrumptious.\n\nBoth our steaks were perfectly cooked (but you need to be aware that Ruth's Chris tends to under-cook slightly, so a medium-rare is just barely so, flirting with rare). Hubby had the buffalo rib-eye Chef's special which was farm-raised, our server told us, so the meat was not very gamey. It was firmer than a standard rib-eye, but less fatty, and very flavorful. He got it with a mustard crust, which was overkill. I had the regular rib-eye, and it was wonderful. We shared a sauteed mushroom side. \n\nNeither of us came close to finishing the huge portions, especially because we were saving some room to share the creme brulee. It came just slightly warmed with a perfect sugar crust and beautiful fresh berry garnish. It is one of the best brulees I have ever had- even better than I can make myself! :) The coffee was mediocre.\n\nIs Ruth's Chris the best steak we have ever had? No- that would be Craftsteak in Vegas, but it's still worth the money. Our biggest complaint was our garrulous server- just this side of arrogant and annoying. He must have spent a half-hour loudly waxing poetic about wine, his grandparents, and Chicago to the people behind us, while we sat neglected. And we were amused to note that some of what he said was inaccurate. Oh well, don't know the answer?

Superior service by our waiter largely contributed to this.\n\nCost to worth it rating: 3 (standard steak prices)\n\nHighlights:\n- Ruth's classics: set menu for $40 for choice of entr\u00e9e (6oz filet and shrimp was one), salad or gumbo, personal sized side, and small dessert. Filet itself is mid-30's, so excellent deal.\n- Waiter: We got a certified pro here. Sean not only far surpassed my expectations for a place like this, but was fit to work at any highly rated fine dining establishment. He topped our experience at many a places like this (most recently Charlie Trotter's) by doing the secret waiter hyper observant eavesdropping thing as a tool to anticipate our tastes and needs. After minutes at the table, he already deduced we were wine fans and on his own initiative delved into giving us a taste of one of his new favorites that was coincidentally already one of ours too. Immediately we knew this guy will be cool. He was gymnast-level flexible accommodating modifications to the set menu (swapping out sides, giving blue cheese crumbles, doubling up on mousse for the non-berry lovers, etc.), telling us whatever the question, the answer would be yes--the level of service I'm always hoping for. Also chummy friendly sharing info about how many kids he had and talking iPhone apps with me when I pulled out my phone. And this treatment just wasn't for us--I saw him doing the same for all of his tables near us.\n- Wine: pretty good choices across price ranges and with the help of Sean we ended up with a great one. He shared one of his preferred wines we weren't aware of, saying if we didn't smile after a taste, we could choose something else. Of course we were happy with that Shiraz. When ordering sparkling, he wisely let us know they had a muscato di asti which the hub loves after his 6 month living stint in Italy.\n- Filet: cooked perfectly and served on a sizzling hot plate of butter which doubled as presentation flair and sears in flavor. I'm picky about my steaks and this fit the bill. The shrimp were nicely intertwined together and placed on top of the steak.\n- Dessert: mini berries and cream and chocolate mousse in a chocolate shell. Perfectly small proportions after a hearty meal like we had.\n\nLowlights:\n- I've patronized many a Ruth Chris over the years and even though their steaks are relatively consistent, their service has never been this good. Thanks Sean for that and tell your wife you're doing great, but now the bar us set high for my return visits and I doubt they'll live up to this. \n\nThoroughly enjoyed our meal here and will be back if not to this location another one for sure.

Both the assistant manager on duty the night of our dining and the managing director, Kevin Hommert, called to discuss the disappointing service. Kevin was very open and non-defensive. He's made a few changes already to the table cleaning process and seemed very committed to improving the service level through better staff training.  I wasn't asked to change my review, but I moved it up from 2 to 3 stars to reflect the outreach and positive attitude.\n\n\nOK Food -  Combined with the Staff Training of an Average Fast Food Restaurant .\n\nOften, I think the host position in restaurants sets the stage for the entire meal. How many times have you walked into a restaurant, only to find the hostess staring at the seating map? Hello? Hum, maybe I'll check my phone for messages..... 'Oh Hi!'\nThat's how our dining experience started at Outback. It's not a big deal, but if I ran a restaurant, I'd have a greeter and someone working the table map. It's an easy way to differentiate your restaurant in a crowded market. \n\nAnyway, we were asked to wait a couple minutes while they bussed a table. \n\nWell a couple minutes turned into 10 or more minutes, so I got to watch the table busing process at work. At this Outback, table busing is done by the assistant hostesses. Behind the hostess stand, there's a napkin on the floor with a bucket of disinfectant solution. Once the assistant host is done busing the table they drop the cleaning rag near the bucket, grab menus and seat the party.  Sometimes the rag  lands on the edge of the napkin, sometimes partly on the floor. Doesn't seem to bother anyone doing it, but I doubt it would meet with the approval of a health inspector. It certainly can't impress any customers who notice.\n\nAnyway, back to our wait. Several new parties walk in and are seated, so I approach the hostess and ask if she's forgotten about us. She looks confused and surprised. It's obvious she has - and we were quickly seated on the other side of the restaurant. Our table hadn't been cleaned properly, so my wife had to wait another 7-8 minutes or so until our waitress arrived, as she had been getting drinks for a large party. We asked to have the table cleaned. She immediately asked the hostess stand to send someone over. They grab the rag off the floor and head over --somewhere else in a big hurry. Meanwhile she takes our drink order and food order - still no table cleaning. We ask again. She asks again. An assistant host heads over with the rag from the floor. I ask for a clean rag, not one off the floor - or  'off the napkin on the floor' -  as they put it, and eventually we have a clean table - well at least it's not sticky any more.\n\nFood was OK. Waitress did a great job trying to make things right. The hostess came over at the end of the meal to apologize for the rocky start, and offer desert. I told her that was very nice. I don't think I've ever had a hostess come over and apologize, so I thanked her. She offered desert again. We declined again. (We can't have it for health reasons.)  Nice service recovery until she got up to leave. As she walks away, she has the oddest expression. I think it was something between wanting to roll her eyes, (but she didn't) to being frustrated by us not accepting the 'peace offering', to confusion as how someone could possibly turn down desert.  \n\nI wish restaurants moved beyond 'free desert' as the solution to all problems. Not everyone is looking for a freebie. Most people just want great food, and good service from a well trained staff. Where was the manager in all this? I don't know. I didn't ask to speak with one, but a good one would have come over early in the dinner. I don't know, maybe the hostess was the manager, but she seemed a bit young and running the host stand certainly doesn't leave time to make sure things are running smoothly.\n\nI sent Outback a similar review, but they haven't acknowledged it or responded to me, which tells me the lack of customer engagement is probably systemic. Outback is part of the Blooming Brands chain of restaurants. Other brands include Carrabba's, Bonefish Grill, Flemings and Roy's. Flemings has good food and excellent service. But, I guess I just don't get the Outback, Carrabba, Bonefish Grill model of moderately expensive food paired with mediocre, inexperienced service. \n\nIf you're going to drop $100 on a steak dinner do yourselves a favor and avoid chain restaurants, especially those with inconsistent management.  Food was OK, but with the exception of the nice waitress, the staff was about as well trained as your average fast food restaurant. Not a good situation when your bill comes in near $100. Find a good independent steak house and pay the extra bucks. It'll be worth it.", "business_id": "4mZ__NR8jLD1k0rYpSbplA", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-03-10", "type": "review"}

The waitstaff is friendly, a manager always asks how things are. I stick with Outback because the food is consistently delicious. \n\nToday I ordered an 8 oz filet, classic cooked, medium. When my steak came out it was...just not what I pictured it normally looking like. It didn't have the dark crusty seared outside. It was thin. It was cooked about medium well/close to well, and probably due to this it was tough. The texture was the worst part because I get the filet for the texture. Despite the fact that it's not usually the MOST flavorful cut, it's worth the sliiiiiight loss in flavor for the tenderness. The classic seasoning & sort of crunchy seared outside completely makes up for the lack of flavor compared with other cuts. \n\nI am NOT the type of person who sends things back, however, my boyfriend confirmed my concerns by telling me that he didn't think it looked like a filet. So, when Andrew the manager came by and asked how things were, I quizzed him about what cut he thought it was. He got it right...8 oz filet. I told him I only asked because it wasn't what I was used to a filet looking/feeling/tasting like. He agreed that it wasn't ideal and insisted on getting me a new one. I told him it wasn't necessary, and if it was the filet I'd eat it despite the lack of the usual Outback perfection. Nope...Andrew wouldn't have that. He brought a new one. The new one was undercooked, but since Andrew waited to see the inside before leaving it with me, he promptly took it back to be fixed.  \n\nThis time it was PERFECT. It was thick like a filet should be, and was cooked exactly medium...red in the center but not bloody. The searing was precisely what I always look forward to at Outback. It was the best steak I've had in a long time.\n\nI was very happy with the way Andrew and our server Shelby made me feel like a valued guest and made me feel like it was OKAY to let them make my order perfect. I don't think I'll become one of those picky sender backer types, but it was nice to know that at this Outback location I don't ever have to settle for anything less than perfect. \n\nBetween Andrew and Shelby, this location has secured me as a customer and I will be back next time I want a fantastic steak!", "business_id": "4mZ__NR8jLD1k0rYpSbplA", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-05-04", "type": "review"}

It wasn't very busy and now I see why. Our server name was Sabrina, she was nice but was a complete ditz. We both ordered hamburgers with no mustard. When the order came one came with mustard. When we told the waitress that the burger had mustard on it she said maybe the other burger has mustard on it? Like she got our orders mixed up and she had a look on her face like it was our fault. Never admitted that they screwed up. So she went back and got another bun. After that she never came back, she never offered us drink refills or asked how our meals were, in fact we were the only customers on that side of the restuarant and probably her only table. She might have been new but seemed to have hardly any customer service skills or serving skills. \n\nSo if you want good service I recommend not going to Outback for lunch because the service is slow, unless it was just our server who lacked skills. I don't think I will ever go back there for lunch just dinner but I hope the waiters at night are more skilled then the day servers.", "business_id": "4mZ__NR8jLD1k0rYpSbplA", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-03-12", "type": "review"}

We came in to use up a gift card, and I wish we hadn't! I usually avoid going here, and this experience reinforced that. \n\nWe were seated right away, and given the option of a table or half booth, which was appreciated as I despise their table set up! More on that later. The hostess was friendly and engaging.\n\nOur server, Brandon, came over right away and got us settled. When asked about one of the dishes, the Teriyaki Medallions, he gave an adequate description which helped my companion make his selection. \n\nThe bread smelled off to me -- kind of like a hot, wet sponge -- so I didn't eat it. My companions did not notice anything, but they are admittedly easy to please.\n\nThe wait for the food was about normal -- the restaurant was neither packed nor slow, and the kitchen turned out the food in good time.\n\nWhen the food arrived, it looked and smelled wonderful. The broccoli and aussie fries were tasty, and my companien's entrees were cooked as ordered. Mine however, was not.  We each asked for our steaks to be cooked medium well, but mine came out rare plus, at best. The center and outside were only warm -- not even approaching something that could be considered \"hot\" -- and bright, vivid red. \n\nI understand that mix ups and mistakes can and do happen, and while I was not offered an explaination, Brandon was kind and accomodating about the error and took the steak back to the kitchen be \"cooked-up\". Something must have been awry in the kitchen this evening, as both tables next to us and one in front also had food issues. \n\nDuring the wait, my companions finished eating, leaving an awkward end of the meal when my new steak was delivered. The manager, Megan, brought it over and apologized profusely.. For whatever reason, there was now rice with my steak which I had not previously ordered. Odd, but fine. \n\nAs I finished my meal, Megan came back to our table and once again apologized, offering dessert on the house for the trouble. We declined since not only had  the last half of our time there had been so awkward with only one of us eating, but I cannot eat most desserts, and certainly none that they had available. \n\nOverall, the service recovery skills the staff showed were great. When the check arrived, I was disappointed. We were charged full price for everything. I did not ask for any kind of compensation, but I hoped the gesture would be made since they seemed so dedicated to making the experience better. \n\n I will close with a note regarding the safety of the customers here: This location, as the three other Outbacks I have been to over the last ten years, is cramped. The way the tables are situated makes for some close calls with *very* hot food being precariously raised above the heads of patrons sitting at their tables.", "business_id": "4mZ__NR8jLD1k0rYpSbplA", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-03-24", "type": "review"}

A co-worker kept raving about it, reminding me over and over to be SURE to hit \"Cattleman's\" for a steak if/when I'm in Phoenix.  Whoops, he had the name wrong, for like 2 years.  I was out here on business at one point and tried to find it.  Not surprisingly, the wrong name made it, uh, impossible to locate.\n\nFast forward a couple more years, and suddenly I'm a Valley resident.  Somewhere along the line, I'd figured out that the target joint was actually Stockyards, not \"Cattleman's\".  I've had dinner here a handful of times since, and have always enjoyed it immensely.\n\nThe beef here is to die for.  Probably the best steak you can find anywhere in the Phoenix area.  Lots of other choices on the menu, but you're really missing out if you don't order steak here.  Lots of side order choices, all of which I've tried I've loved.  Beware the \"calf fries\", they are actually a certain body part that you might not want to eat.  Let's just say that Beavis and Butthead would be amused by the fact that they're on the menu.\n\nThe light rail construction along Washington dealt a severe blow to business, and now that it's done, the economy apparently isn't helping either.  All of my recent visits have found the joint sadly semi-empty.  The location is odd.  They could use some sort of marketing boost via the local hotels.  Nobody I've dined with here has ever been the least bit disappointed with either the food or the experience.\n\nStockyards rates a solid 4.25 stars on the Brak-o-Meter.  It's quite expensive, and that keeps me from giving it the coveted 5-star endorsement, as the value factor is just \"ok\".  But if the stiff tab doesn't deter you, I can virtually assure you that you will find your steak to be top shelf, comparable to any snobby steak joint in the land.

I don't want to drive back toward work and try a pricey restaurant that might not be worth the trip. Rachael Ray recommends trying a place for lunch when it is cheaper and less of a wait - so that is what I did today. One area where Rachael's advice was incorrect was the wait - Friday during lunch was very busy. When I entered the host recommended that I go to the bar because the dining area was already full. The bar contains seating as well as seats at the bar itself.  With the available seating taken, I bellied up to the bar at looked over the lunch menu. A positive note is that the menu is the same in the bar as the dining room. Being during work hours I could not enjoy items from the behind the bar, but the guys just down the bar from me were ordering and I was excited to learn the Stockyard has Moose Drool on tap. Instead, I had the diet Pepsi.\n\nWhen the waitress asked if I was ready and I indicated not yet, I didn't realize that might be my only opportunity. I imagined she would only serve those at the bar; however, she also worked the room behind the bar and was constantly running back and forth. It took about 15-20 minutes, but eventually she returned to take my order. I went with the Grilled New York Strip Steak Sandwich. I don't know if the recession has caused a bread shortage, it is homage to Dr. Atkins or Webster has changed the definition of \"sandwich\", but typically I picture two pieces of bread surrounding the integral ingredient. Last week @ Robbie Fox's I was surprised that a sandwich came open faced. With the Stockyard menu providing a heading of \"Sandwiches\" and the brisket sandwich being called \"Open Faced BBQ Beef Brisket\", I foolishly assumed the other items not named \"Open Faced\" would have two pieces of bread. Not so. The sandwich arrived in about 10 minutes and was served on a single piece of bread with a side order of fries. Hmmm. That said, it was a regular sized steak - and for $15 a descent price. The steak itself was among the best I have ever tried. Tender, juicy and flavorful. The fries were crisp and tasty. \n\nAlthough I am not a fan of Westerns, the bar had a nice feel. A copper cash register in the back corner with a picture of John Wayne to the waitress' attire and appearance screamed Old West. It had a nice feel. I don't blame the waitress for slow service because she was hustling the entire time. I think management needs to monitor customer flow and if it is busy on a Friday afternoon, there should be a server working that room and letting the bartender focus on  the bar and the libations. \n\nThe dinner menu escalates in price, but given what I had for lunch, the history and the atmosphere, I would like to come back and experience dinner in the dining room or maybe spend a quiet evening at the bar enjoying a Moose Drool or two.", "business_id": "7U8TYNW4Mvx6m3zexsO0sg", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-03-26", "type": "review"}

My BF had read about it here on Yelp and decided it would be the \"fancy dinner\" for this trip.  There were plenty of casually-dressed patrons, so don't think dressing up is a requirement, tho'.\n\nWe arrived a little earlier than our reservation, so hung out in the bar for a bit after checking in with the hostess,  When we returned to the hostess station about 20 minutes later, we were pleased that the gal remembered who we were and sat us immediately.  Our server, Bob, was jovial and very helpful with the menu choices.  Scott had the baseball cut steak (essentially a huge lump of beef -- very very tasty), and opted for the \"Wild West Mix Grill\" - elk, pike and wild boar & venison sausage.  The plate was enormous!  It was the first time I'd ever eaten elk, so I wasn't sure what to expect... I wasn't crazy about the first bite, but it grew on me.  The pike was well cooked and flaky, and the sausage was tasty as well.  I thought the chutney that came with the sausage was a little too strong in flavor, but others might like it.  My dish did not come with the whiskey sweet potato mash, but I wanted to try it so our server brought me a sample of it - YUMMY!  For dessert we shared the warm chocolate brownie with ice cream.  We were both stuffed.\n\nTable service was really good.  My water glass was never empty (one of my personal measurements of a good restaurant).  The waiter was very attentive, but not invasive.  It's not the quietest of restaurant - sound and voices really bounce around in there - but the atmosphere and decor are quite nice, and worth seeing.  Prices were a little high, but it's a high-end restaurant so you'd expect it.  The final tab for two entrees, a couple glasses of wine and dessert were still notably cheaper than a comparable dinner in Las Vegas.

When we quickly decided that a \"petite filet and a baked potato\" sounded like a winner, we hit the Verizon GPS. We only saw the name come up on our Verizon GPS, and we followed the instructions from the hotel, around the West side of the airport, and then East on Washington to the restaurant. I joked that if it had turned out to be like a Black Angus, or an Outback, I'd still be OK with making that our destination. We didn't want to go wandering all over Phoenix looking for a steakhouse.\n\nIt's a historical landmark building, and we saw both business people and locals doing dinner. I really think it's what many of you guys call \"a hidden gem.\" I say that because the location is in a sorta' bleak, industrial portion of Washington, just North of the airport.

For the most part, steaks run around $30 to $45, depending on cut and size, and unless someone's cut out your tongue, I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy, or probably love your food! With a great bar and wine inventory, you'll probably float around $50 per person with one drink. Add app's and, well, the tab climbs a bit.

For lunch you could have a burger or orgasmic BBQ beef sandwich to die for; for dinner you could surf and turf and enjoy yourself more than you could at the high rent district places.

Stockyards is an absolute SH*TSHOW of a restaurant.  There, I guess that's as good a start as any.  I've been to restaurants where I spent double what I spent at Stockyards ($130 including tax+tip) and thought the meal was worth every penny.  I don't mind paying good money for dinner, as long as I get a good meal and a quality experience.  Obviously by the 1-star rating, you'll get neither/nor at Stockyards.\n\nFirst, let me commend the service.  From the hostess to the server to the assistants, the entire staff was first-rate -- polite and welcoming, attentive without being intrusive.  They were awesome, which is why I almost hate to write such a negative review.\n\nAs nice as everyone was, in the end you go to a restaurant for the food, and the sh*tshow came from the kitchen.  First the munchies, bread & butter and a crudit\u00e9 plate.  The bread basket contained biscuits and jalapeno corn bread.  Both were OK, maybe a bit dry, but I get that it's the desert and baked goods dry out quickly - dry doesn't mean stale in places like Arizona.  The veggies in the crudit\u00e9 were a bit tired looking.  The ranch dressing that came with it had to have come from a bottle.  I splurged a bit and got the most expensive appetizer, the seafood gratin -- lobster (although I couldn't find any), shrimp and scallops baked in a garlic cream sauce, served with garlic toast.  The shrimp and scallops (and the ever elusive lobster) had to be frozen.  I could almost see the sous-chef cutting open a plastic bag and dumping frozen chunks of seafood into the microwave to thaw.  If the garlic cream sauce wasn't Prego, then it was a remarkably close approximation.  Frozen seafood and sauce out of a jar for 24 bucks.  Can you understand why I'm pissed off??\n\nI ordered the elk medallions because I love good venison, and an elk aficionado once told me that elk was even better.  The elk wasn't gamey, but it wasn't much of anything, really.  On its own, it didn't have much flavor.  The kitchen did try to drown it in a ghastly juniper-something sauce, which tasted like brown gravy out of a jar (again with the jars!) plus a few spices thrown in.  They were served with chive potato cakes that were so salty that one bite easily doubled my BP.  It also came with carrots and string beans, and in all fairness, the string beans actually tasted fresh.  They were probably the only part of the meal that did not come out of  a plastic bag, a can, or a jar.  I asked for the salad (included with the entr\u00e9e) after the meal, dressing on the side.  It came out drowning in dressing.  There was so much Thousand Island in my salad bowl I half-expected to see a little plastic Titanic capsized and adrift.\n\nI tried to redeem the meal with dessert, which can often salvage, at least in part, a bad meal because I have a wicked sweet tooth.  The pecan pie was decent, but no better than the little pecan tarts at Starbucks.  The Starbucks pecan tarts actually have a better crust.  The Stockyards' pie crust tasted like they bought it frozen (like every other bleepin' ingredient on the menu).\n\nI don't eat at places like Friday's, Bennigan's, or Applebee's because it's all reheated frozen food.  But in fairness to those establishments, the fare is priced accordingly.  My problem with Stockyards is that it's far pricier than Friday's et al, yet it's still cuisine from a freezer bag, a can, or a jar.  Save your money and go to a REAL steakhouse (I went to J&G's the next night, spent far more, and LOVED it), or go to Outback, where you'll get the same out-of-a-jar/can/freezer bag sh*tshow, but at least the check is half what you'd spend at Stockyards.\n\nPS: I almost never click the link to share my reviews on Facebook (not what I use Facebook for), but I will with this review because as many people as possible need to be warned about what a complete waste of time and money Stockyards is.", "business_id": "7U8TYNW4Mvx6m3zexsO0sg", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-05-06", "type": "review"}

New York Strip as part of a $40 prix fixe meal for Phoenix Restaurant Week.  I started with the steak soup.  Good flavor, plenty of meat in it, but they sure skimped on the portion size.  It was a tiny cup (I'd hope and assume that for the non-Restaurant Week patrons a larger bowl would be on offer).  As for the main course, it was a really good steak, cooked a perfect medium rare per my order, but there was nothing truly special about it.  Seasoned with peppercorn and served with--if I recall (it was pretty forgettable)--a fairly generic barbecue sauce. It was served with a choice of potato.  I opted for the scalloped potatoes and they were really good.  The pecan pie I had for desert tasted good but was crumblier than I'd prefer.  It fell apart after the first couple of bites.

Ultimately, I'd probably eat here again if friends invited me, but I'd likely try to sway them towards somewhere with a more creative menu that perhaps offered a bit more bang for my buck.", "business_id": "7U8TYNW4Mvx6m3zexsO0sg", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-05-23", "type": "review"}

My dinner came out looking like it had been through an assembly line.  The mashed potatoes were extremely bland and unappealing and were plopped on the plate in a long egg shaped pile with the zucchini thrown on next to it and in it. The Filet looked like a postage stamp on the side of the plate. There were no rolls, salad or anything else to accompany the lunch . Price, $26.00. I wanted to call the manager and ask their opinion but because it was our date day I didn't want to ruin it. Even though we were there for lunch I would have to expect a much better plating. At least put the potatoes in a heap with butter and put separation from the veggies. Maybe a little parsley for color. The meat was exceptional.

I have eaten at just about every top steak house in phoenix and I would put this meal on par with an Outback steakhouse at best but almost top steakhouse prices. \n$440 for 6 people and one had meatloaf and one had a chicken dish. \n\nThe atmosphere is warm and presents a very Arizona flavor to it. I enjoyed the decor. However, we were put in a back room in a corner which I am sure is the overflow room and is not as nice as the front. \n\nThe wait staff was very attentive and did a good job. Not a problem there.\n\nMy brother and sister in law were in town from Baton Rouge and we wanted to go to a local place of history. We picked this place after we could not get in to Don &Charlie's based on yelp reviews. Yikes, bad call.\n\n3 people had the clam chowder (soup of the day) and it came out cold and sent back which I am sure they microwaved it hot.\n\n4 of us had prime rib and I have had more flavorful at Outback or Charleston's\n. It was just ok. They do not advertise prime meat but grass fed which can be graded as choice which I assume it is. For the price is should be prime beef.\n\nThe mashed potatoes were just average mashed potatoes you can make at home with no thought of enhancing them....garlic cheese, something, etc??\n\nThe creamed spinach came out bairly warm. After the clam chowder we did not want to cause any more trouble by sending it back. I just chalked it up to not having the kitchen equipment of the top steak houses to serve pipping hot food.\n\n It is not quite as expensive as Ruths Chris, Mortons, Durants, Capital grill, Donovan's, Mastros, City Hall or Flemings. However, I would suggest spending the extra and having a far superior meal.\n\nThe place was just average but at top prices.

An AMAZING steakhouse ! The Stockyards has a rich history and that makes it even more special. Upon arriving at Stockyards, I am a little taken aback about where it is. Here's the deal though, this place started in 1919 as a packing house and eventually grew to a huge feedlot with more than 40,000 head of cattle. \nIn 1947, the Stockyards Restaurant opened on the feedlots property and was THE place for cattle baron, politicians and bankers to meet. With beef 'homegrown' , fed and plated right on property, the Stockyards Restaurant was THE original Arizona steakhouse. Much of the glory of the cattle days has since gone, but the history in the building still exists. \nThe bar was bustling and a standing room only when I arrived on a Wednesday night to meet up with a few other people. There are ample premium liquors and an extensive wine list to be enjoyed.\nWe were seated promptly at our reservation time and given an overview of the restaurants history by our great waitress. A small silver terrine of fresh veggies are left for pre-dining munching. Reminds me of old school parental type restaurants. Love that! \nMany of the steaks are cut on order and are aged on property. They even have Chateaubriand for two! \nI had a 5 oz. filet and it was like slicing warm butter. So thick and amazing flavor! I highly recommend the Parmesan Potato Gratin Stack to go with your choice of meat. I started with the very ample Green Goddess salad and that can be split. Our waitress paired a wonderful Cabernet with my filet; ON her game! For dessert, we all ordered many things and sampled each other's. I personally loved the Burnt Creme .. Rich like a br\u00fbl\u00e9e , yet with enough of a citrus finish to not be too, TOO sweet. I paired that with a Frangelico on the rocks and I left, NOT finishing any of one thing I ordered ! I was stuffed! No worries , it was nicely boxed up for the next day :) \nI did not find this steakhouse to be pretentious, as some can be, or snooty. People dressed from casual to dressy and no one batted an eye at that. You will need a reservation. The Stockyards was busy from the time I arrived just after 6pm to almost 10pm , when I left. \nThis is a great steakhouse with amazing food and history and service to go along with great prices for hand cut and seasoned/aged steaks and meats. A awesome dinner for about $50-80 p person with wine .. Best thing, is , it's local!", "business_id": "7U8TYNW4Mvx6m3zexsO0sg", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-04-02", "type": "review"}

I am an arizona native and personally have never seen the place I call home look so pretty and almost big! I personally enjoyed the food we had a set menu and the food just kept coming out everything from their biscuts to the cotton candy was excellent. I thought it was never gonna end, everything was served family style but out of the 27 of us there not one of us had a single complaint, all of our main courses came out at the exact same time no complaints, we got the kids meals first which I found nice since kids can get restless in a place were your trying to actually dine! The casual attire is nice, kids love the slide, my daughter loved looking at the city lights also, workers are very hospitable all in all one of the nicest places I've been to and I would love to go again whether its for another family outing or just my husband and i. The only thing I would have a complaint about is the steep walking if you don't do valet and its defanitly not easy if you have to carry a seven month baby up hill so I recomend getting a babysitter for the tiny ones but two and older I would say your good to go!", "business_id": "wZwZcte4lcbu51NOzCjWbQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-04-18", "type": "review"}

Nice view today, neglible smog impediment. Misters, and a nice occasional breeze, kept us quite comfortable.\n\nThe buffet had a decent selection of items, including roast beef, roast ham, waffles, eggs, bacon, sausage, Eggs Diablo, fajitas, spanish rice, etc.\n\nLet me just say that the Eggs Diablo was delicious!\n\nMoving on to everything else;\nThe bacon was overcooked, to the point of being almost black\nThe biscuits for the biscuits and gravy were a bit dry, and the gravy was sweet. I have no idea whose idea that was, but it most certainly doesn't work.\nThe wafflse station had cream cheese, strawberries, I believe cherries, and cinammon-backed apples. The apples were superb! Perfect consistency of slightly tender but not mushy, and VERY flavorful. The strawberries should have been capped, or at least cored, but they were tasty, and did not appear to have been sitting for a long period of time.\nThe beef fajitas had no spiciness at all. It was the blandest fajitas I have ever tasted.\nThe roast beef was cooked properly but was also bland\nThe selection of desserts looked visually appealing, but all those I tasted gave the impression that they were purchased off-site and delivered, not prepared fresh on-site. Of the desserts and the entree selections, nothing stood out, except the oatmeal cranberry cookies, which stood out for being hockey-puck hard.\n\nThe server was attentive, if only barely. I gave her a bit of a break, however, as it seemed that we were the only table she had on the patio. (Not the only people sitting on the patio, only people she was responsible for)\n\nGiven the price, I expect better quality, but I suppose perhaps I shouldn't, given the reality that rustlers is a cowboy steakhouse. Having eaten there in the past, I can attest to the quality of the western/cowboy type meals they serve.\n\nI will visit Rustler's Rooste again, if only for the joy of seeing my daughters enjoy the slide, and the view, and some good cofort food.\n\nBut I will not likely return for their buffets, and I would not likely recommend anyone visit them for a buffet.", "business_id": "wZwZcte4lcbu51NOzCjWbQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-05-09", "type": "review"}

THEN we ordered... among my whole family, we were able to try a lot of foods.. I got the grilled chicken and I loved it! bbq'd to perfection with great sauce. the corn was great, and my family was all very happy with their meals too (ribs, shrimp, etc). overall awesome food. \n4. finally they brought out complimentary cotton candy! it was funny to get, and you can't go wrong with cotton candy. \n\njust remember..\n- Come early or make reservations!

Not sure how everyone elses food was, but from viewing it i was less than impressed... Oh and talk about cheap...you can't get the normal sides for steak with out paying extra money.

The following review is based on the group meal we had in which I brought my 1yr old daughter.\n\n-First of all, not matter what the reviews say, this restaurant is best for large groups or family gatherings.  It is quite loud and I would find it difficult to have an intimate dinner.  However, it is perfect for family and kids and should warrant a visit if you are vacationing with family/friends.  \n\n-For the kids they have a live steer as you are walking in (just warrants a quick look), a slide (kids absolutely love it) and some old fashioned video games.  \n\n-For the adults there is a dance floor with live country music, and REALLY GOOD FOOD!  Everyone in our party loved their food, even the vegetarian (I know how cruel can we be to bring a vegetarian to a BBQ joint).  I shared one of those GIGANTIC meals for 2 or more with a friend, and each item (ribs, chicken, shrimp, etc) was somehow falling off the bone with amazing flavor.\n\n-The only compliant I had was the service was a little off the longer we stayed.  When we first got there the service was amazing, someone stopped by our table every 5-10 minutes.  But after a couple hours of eating and drinking the server couldn't be found.\n\n-Overall, if you are visting the Tempe area for a couple days (like going to Spring Training) with a group of friends or family, you really should try it out you will not be disappointed.", "business_id": "wZwZcte4lcbu51NOzCjWbQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-03-13", "type": "review"}

Sounds like a great plan right!\n\nMom came into town, I told her my plan of taking her out to eat, so Sunday came and we are ready to go!  Oh let me give you guys a little insight too, my mom had a stroke when she was in her 30's so walking is hard for her. \n\nWe got to Rustler's Rooste around 4:25, I never bothered to looked at what times the place was opened, but found out they didn't open till 5, I dropped mom off at valet parking, and they were sweet and showed mom in through the exit so she didn't have to walk the steps. So when I parked the car, the valet told me where my mom went, for a slow walker, she sure did disappear fast , now it's about 4:35, one of the servers saw my mom and told her that when the place opens at 5 someone will seat us by the window if that would be ok with her, it was close to the exit and she was ok with that.\n\nWell 5pm came and nothing was happening, so I went up to the stairs and found the hostess and explained that my mom was handicapped and unable to walk up the stairs and where we were told we could wait to be seated, she said did you have reservations? I said no, again didn't think ahead, maybe I should I have, she said well, I have people upstairs that have been waiting for tables and left.   Walked back to mom and told her I didn't get very far.    From my impression from the hostess, only way I was going to get a table was if I walked upstairs to get it for us, and this left me with a bad impression, that maybe the RR isn't handicap friendly. Like only those who can get up the stairs can have tables, hurray for the walking!   My mom, who is more even tempered then me and is ok with just waiting, said just be still, so I waited. Another lady showed up about 6 mins later and asked if we had be helped and I said no we haven't, and she must have been someone important cuz she made it happened.   \n\nWe were showed to our table, our waitress was Jennifer, very nice and very sweet, she explained the menu to us, since it was both our 1st time there we ordered the Cowboy Stuff, which was bbq ribs & chicken, crispy shrimp, steak & seafood kabobs, beans, veggies, potatoes wedges and some other stuff, I have to say the one thing that stood out was the ribs, omg they are fall off the bone melt in your mouth good! RR knows how to make some ribs! Going to have to come back from some more of them!\n\nI have to say Jennifer and the nice man at valet parking showed get customer service, but the hostess left me with a bad impression and she is where the dining experience starts.", "business_id": "wZwZcte4lcbu51NOzCjWbQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-04-17", "type": "review"}

I substituted sweet potato fries which were good, but not spectacular.  The rest of the table ordered steaks, mostly filets which came with green beans.  The salad the comes with the entrees is a house salad and they have one dressing, a house-made ranch. I'd have to say they definitely save the best part for last...

If not, you might want to re-think heading to this joint.  \n\nAs you walk in, you have a big ol steer in a pen right outside the restaurant.  The kiddies like it so its worth the smells.  Checking in with the hostess has always been an issue and it was no different this time around.  It was about a 30 minute wait for a table and a bit unorganized to get your name in with the waitress.  \n\nIf you can get a table along the windows, you will get a fantastic view of the valley, sunset and the air traffic into Sky Harbor.  Worth the trip just for the views.\n\nOnce you get buzzed that your table is ready,  you get to walk down steps or take the slide to the dining level.  The slide is a zoo with lots of kids...and some adults who act like kids...so that is part of the fun.  \n\nLive country music and a smallish dance floor and sawdust, a classic touch.  This is not your new country music. You will get your Johnny, Willie and Waylan which is the way I like it.\n\nDecent menu with options for the kids.  I ordered the 16 oz. Prime Rib (Marshall), medium rare.  The meal comes with bread/butter before hand.  Family style salad and cowboy beans as the first course.  And corn on the cob & green beans with the entree.  The prime rib was every bit of 16 oz, but it was over cooked.  More toward medium than MR.  That was disappointing, especially since 1/4 of the front page of the menu was taken up describing how they cook their meat.\n\nThe sides were OK.  I think they are making a mistake by serving the meal on a plate with a metal cover.  Condensation builds up on the inside of the lid and drips onto to the entree.  It just make everything soggy.\n\nThe service was good, although I had so many plates at my smallish table, that i ran out of room to put things.  For a table of four, (two of which were kids under 3) I had 9 small plates.  We had a stack of them left on the end of the table for about 10 minutes before someone stopped by to pick them up.  Just a weird experience.\n\nThere is also at least two people walking around making balloon animals, for a small fee.  These guys/gals are fun and kids certainly got a kick out of it.  \n\nLastly, we were offered cotton candy as we left.   Definitely something my 3yr didn't need, but it was a nice touch.   \n\nOverall, the food was a 2, but the experience was a 4 especially for the kids....so they get a 3 from me.", "business_id": "wZwZcte4lcbu51NOzCjWbQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-05-29", "type": "review"}

There is a pretty sweet slide that takes you down into the main dining area, live music in the evening, and beautiful views of the valley. So, the ambiance is fun.\n\nNegatives: In my opinion, the food is NOT worth the price. First of all, you have to pay extra for sides like baked potato. This kind of a side is typically included at most steakhouses. They do serve bread which is super yummy. However,  the salad is a bagged salad,  not at all fresh and tastes horrible. I ordered the prime rib, I liked the seasoning but it was not medium rare as ordered. Like my vegetables, it was overcooked.  The veggies were not fresh and again, overcooked. When you pay$20 for a plate, you expect much more. Our waitress was inattentive and disappeared for a significant amount of time. There is a magician that comes around to the tables which I find annoying and uncomfortable.  I never carry cash, so I just sat there hoping he would skip us which he did.  As he passed by I got a huge whiff of cologne...nothing goes together like Old Spice and steak.  \n\nI will say that my son enjoyed the fried chicken and my husband liked his enchilada and steak plate.  However,  we could have had better food for less at Outback. Bottom Line: you are paying for the experience, not the food. Fun to do once, but $75 was a hefty price tag for subpar food.

However, I decided I'd go it alone (I was traveling for business), make my order, get a to go box and be on my way.  This is the kind of place you don't want to go it alone. Not because it's scary but because it is TOTALLY lame when you're alone.  I had no idea it would be so, hmmm, country and lively?  \n\nThe building sits atop the city on a hill.  Would love to have seen it during the daylight as well.  And it's big! As soon as you get to the entrance you're greeted by a longhorn steer named Horney.  When you enter you climb your way into the restaurant through a wooden path that looks like an old mine.  Think amusement park ride.  Then when you get in it is BUSY! People everywhere. Floors are uneven. Loud, live music.  It would have been a 45 minute wait so I opted for a seat at the bar.  However, the woman who sat me didn't explain that if you sit at the bar you can only order appetizers. Well she was in luck because that's all I wanted, but it would have been nice to know that was my option!\n\nI came for the rattlesnake bites and cactus fries, but ended up also ordering some wings because you only get about an ounce of meat with the rattlesnake bites.  The bartender, though busy, did find the time to take my order and tried to accommodate me. Looking around at the sea of bodies, I completely understood why he wasn't super attentive.  The food was ok. I just wanted to add another unique food to my list.  The rattlesnake was heavily breaded, chewy and kind of like chicken. Not much meat in those bites, though. The accompanying sauce...ick.  There were plenty of cactus fries and they reminded me of fried pickles.  The wings were delicious!  So glad I got those because I wasn't a big fan of the fries after the first few bites.  \n\nIf I make it back to Phoenix, I might give it another go (but will try a steak or something else). Like I said, it's better with company.  If you're looking for a quick to go order on a business trip on a night where you're dead tired, I'd just avoid it.  It sounds like this place could be quite an adventure. From the website:\n\nRustler's Rooste has it all.  Our critter out front, an enormous long horn steer named Horney greets you upon arrival.  Open the door and enter part of an old mine shaft to the top floor to our Mountaintop Saloon.  Saunter over the indoor waterfall and take our Famous \"Tin\" Slide into the dining room. (for the faint of heart, there's a staircase).   Enjoy the live country western band and our strolling cardshark/magician.  The building is bordered on the north side by plate glass windows so there is a view form every seat in the house. Rustler's Rooste was founded in 1971 and is still family owned and operated.  The legend goes that the original site, atop a butte in the foothills of South Mountain, was a hideout for cattle rustlers.  Today it is firmly established as the valley's highest and brightest beacon of the total cowboy western experience.", "business_id": "wZwZcte4lcbu51NOzCjWbQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-04-08", "type": "review"}

I selected the location primarily for the view and a solid menu. The website indicated that the restaurant takes reservations but when I called, I was informed that there is a \"call ahead\" list rather than an actual reservation option. The purpose of the call ahead list is to shorten your wait time.  \n\nI arrived and the restaurant was extremely busy. I was given a buzzer to notify me when our table was ready and told the wait would be 20-30 minutes. I think our wait was around the 30 minute mark.\n\nWhen we were seated, we had a decent view but the restaurant was so amazingly loud, we had to practically scream at each other to be heard during the entire meal. We were competing with what felt/sounded like thousands of other diners who were all doing the same. There were a number of birthdays being celebrated while we were there and for each one the staff would come through with an insanely loud dinner triangle, accompanied by a shouted announcement and singing. It was impossible to have a conversation when this happened.\n\nOur waiter was clearly run ragged. He did what he could to keep up with the drink refils but that's about it. Ordering was a chore because he wasn't able to hear us over the din. The food was pretty basic. I had the salmon, which was good. My  husband had the ribs, which were good and our guests each had steak. Neither of the steaks were cooked as ordered. \n\nAlong with being loud, the restaurant was very dark and our table lantern was out. We inquired about getting it lit and that took our overworked waiter almost the entire duration of the meal to manage. Once we got it lit, it was still very dark. \n\nMy husband and I had been to Rustler's Rooste once before for Easter Brunch and we were pleased with the service and food. Last night, however, was a less than enjoyable experience.", "business_id": "wZwZcte4lcbu51NOzCjWbQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-03-22", "type": "review"}

I tried to talk him out of it - but it *was* his birthday, and sometimes, it can be fun to be a hokey tourist in your own town.\nWe had no delusions about what we were in for. This is not a great restaurant. This is a cheesy, cowboy themed resort restaurant that caters to tourists and happens to have a great view. To make sure we did it right, we changed clothes prior to going - to ensure we could enjoy the slide down into the dining room. (Without offending parents of innocent children or risking chafing to dangly bits.)\nWe started with a cocktail in the bar while waiting for a table. Did we each order the sickly-sweet tropical nonsense in a glass cowboy boot and served while on fire? You bet your ass we did! (Now, to figure out what to do with my glass cowboy boot souvenir...)\nThere's sawdust on the floor, and the d\u00e9cor screams \"Disney Design Company.\" All the clich\u00e9s of an old West steakhouse/saloon are represented - down to the raised stage where the live band performs all the safe, upbeat Country standards.\nWhen we were seated, a basket of fry bread was delivered with both regular and honey butter. Do you know what's wrong with fried bread and butter? Not a damn thing!\nThis is not a menu for the health conscious. And based on the prices, there's no possible way it's great quality meat. ($24.95 for a bone in rib-eye - with salad, carrots and corn??) The portions are ginormous, there's a decent variety of options, and rotating monthly specials.\nI had discreetly mentioned it was my friend's birthday (because I put the \"B\" in subtle!) I wasn't down with spending the extra money for the birthday package...and really, who needs an \u00e9clair sundae that must weigh in at five pounds - so we were both pleased when the waiter brought my friend cotton candy with a candle.\nWe went in with expectations of touristy cheesiness and set the bar very, very low for dinner service. And we were both pleasantly surprised. The food was completely satisfactory. The service was completely decent. And when it came down to it - we had an absolute blast.\nRustler's Rooste is not a great restaurant by any stretch, and it's not trying to be - but it can be great fun if you let it...and that makes it a great place!", "business_id": "wZwZcte4lcbu51NOzCjWbQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-04-01", "type": "review"}

They have pretty standard, average food, and lots of gimmicks.  First, the place is huge. It is two stories, and each floor has a bar. Downstairs, they also have a little stage where a live band plays and there's a dance floor. After you are seated, you are given a basket of complimentary fry bread and biscuits, which are pretty delicious. They have lots of choices on the menu, so even the pickiest eater should be able to find something. That being said, there's lots of meat and potato type dishes. You get a family-style premade salad with your meal which is a pretty standard lettuce/tomato/onion/crouton/ranch salad. Ours was cold and the lettuce was crisp so I really liked it.  The portion sizes are pretty generous. We ended up not being able to finish our meals.  We had a couple of cocktails from the bar, and they have alcohol versions of limeade which are pretty delicious and reasonably priced, for alcohol. When you get the check, you will receive a complimentary spool of cotton candy.  The restaurant sits up on a hill, so it has pretty good views of the valley and if you get there at the right time, you'll see a nice sunset.  I wasn't expecting anything truly extraordinary from this place, because I had read the reviews beforehand, but we went, it was packed, we had pretty decent service and decent food so I have no complaints.  If you're expecting a fancy schmancy steakhouse, this is not your place. It is a family-friendly, loud, casual joint which I think a lot of people would get a kick out of.  Oh! Also. If you are staying at the Arizona grand resort, there is a shuttle which will run you up to the restaurant and will pick you up after.

Come here occasionally and about every fourth visit, they go from an acceptable value to absolutely awful.\n\nTonight was one of those nights.\n\nHad a craving for sirloin, so I ordered that with baked potato and house salad. We already had onion rings and fried pickles the table that were difficult to eat because they were so salty. Got my salad - this was good with bleu cheese dressing. Ate it all, then came the entree. All I asked for was sour cream and butter on the potato. I added black pepper. Was only able to eat a third of it because someone in the kitchen must own stock in Morton's Salt. The skin was worse, since they roll the taters in salt before cooking. \n\nOkay... could they screw up a steak that I asked to be cooked rare? I know they aren't equipped to do black and blue, but rare is hard to mess up. Cooked unevenly, one side of the steak was medium rare, the other was medium well. I think there was some medium pink in the middle. Overall, the meat was lukewarm, temperature-wise. Again, it was me having a little food with my salt.\n\nNo one got their steaks cooked correctly. One asked for medium well and got hers bloody. Different cut, or I'd think they mixed the steaks up. She sent gets back. What she got back looked like it might have been thrown in the microwave. It wasn't gone long enough to have been grilled longer.\n\nIf not for the usual nice servers, I'd be upset over not giving this place a double zero for stars.\n\nI ate a third of my main plate because of the extra generous portions of salt. This restaurant must have stock in blood pressure meds.\n\n\nTo their credit, they took my meal off the tab and offered me something else because they \"don't want customers leaving hungry.\" I wouldn't have left hungry if they could cook better than a five year old left alone in the kitchen. But I'd rather force a crappy fast food burger down my throat than eat anything more from that kitchen tonight. Already on my fourth glass of water, trying to dilute the salt.\n\nThe only thing that would have made me happy would have been a future comped meal on a day they had someone cooking who knew what they were doing. Had I taken them up on the offer tonight, I'd not have been able to eat it, no matter how hungry I still was - for all I know, my replacement meal might have been spit in.\n\nOverall, I've had better meals at Golden Corral - and most of us know how bad that can be.\n\nThe kids were happy - young people are more salt tolerant, plus their big brownies didn't seem to be loaded with salt.\n\nSorry, Texas Roadhouse. You'd already lost most of my family and friends. Tonight, even with as tolerant as I am, you finally accomplished losing me, too.\n\nOne word summary for those skimming this review: YUCK!", "business_id": "Mm8x_jzeLrWlvDEnqhuCBQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-05-27", "type": "review"}

Mainly because for about ten or twenty dollars more, you can get a perfect meal at a real steakhouse. Had the day off today and after a 1.5 hour massage, Jen and I went looking for a place to eat. We wanted something new but settled on Texas Roadhouse after driving around aimlessly for fifteen minutes. \n\nWe got there just after opening and I remember telling Jen, since we both have restaurant backgrounds, that the worst time to eat at a restaurant is when it's slow. Two or three in the afternoon they are running on a skeleton crew until the night shift gets there and they are trying to cook, prep, and stock up all at the same time. Throw a steak on the grill or cheese sticks in the fryer and go grab some veggies out of the cooler to keep stocking for the dinner rush. Whoops! Oh man, I forgot the cheese sticks and they exploded or I forgot to flip the steak so one side is way over cooked and the other not so much. Yes, anyone who had worked back of the house will say that this or similar situations has happened to them. \n\nWe were sat right away with fresh rolls and cinnamon butter. Yummy!  Ordered the app sampler with boneless wings mixed sauce which were great. The potato skins were drowning in cheese and bacon and were probably the best I've ever had. Jen's chicken salad could have fed three more people. Massive. My steak was edible. I jinxed myself as you can see by the pictures. Burned on one side and barely marked on the other. Should not have been sent out but they probably had chicken to thaw or mushrooms to portion out. Our waitress was very fast and efficient and she did ask how everything was an I said it was fine. Just wanted to be done and get to our movie. It wasn't her fault the steak was cooked horribly. Typical reason though as to why I am willing to spend the extra money to get what I want.

Where to begin. \n\nWe happened upon this place mostly by accident. It shares a parking lot with Texas Roadhouse which is a great steakhouse but because of that fact, at any given time it's extremely crowded. We had planned on hitting Texas Roadhouse for dinner before catching a movie at the nearby Mesa Grand AMC Theater. However, as is always the case it was packed, and we were told it was a 45 minute wait. Seeing Charleston's across the way, we said why not? \n\nUpon entering the place we were surprised to see how well done the interior was. Classy, with dark wood and stone accents and lit just well enough to maintain an intimate atmosphere. Each table is lit by candles and soft overhead lighting. Up until recently it had some real smooth Jazz playing in the background (which has regrettably been replaced with easy listening/pop fare in an effort to attract a younger crowd).\n\nAll of the wait staff male or female is dressed in black slacks and black shirts which may sound pretentious but only adds to the ambiance in practice. They are, in general, extraordinarily attentive and quick to serve. On most weekends, the management helps bring out food, refill drinks and make sure everything is satisfactory. Nice touch. \n\nNow on to the food... oh the food! I have yet to eat a meal that was less than excellent no matter what I order but my favorite is the Baby Back Ribs and Herb Chicken combo. It's a huge plate of food, and it comes complete with garlic mashed potatoes and I opt out on the bbq beans in exchange for the glazed carrots. You MUST eat the glazed carrots if nothing else... I do not like carrots at all mind you, but these I could eat all day until my skin turned orange.\n\nAside from the carrots, the herb chicken is actually a half a chicken seasoned perfectly and very succulent. I've scoured the internets trying to find the recipe for this bird and it's nowhere to be found. I'm considering a part time stint at this place just long enough to poach the recipe or at least watch the chef do it. Delicious. Sub out the potatoes for the fries (they're crispy, and salt & peppered) and you won't be disappointed either. \n\nIt's never as crowded as the neighboring Roadhouse, but to me that's a good reason to check it out. It's great.\n\nTip: Check out their menu on the web before you go. It'll give you an idea of the kind of food they have in store for you.", "business_id": "Rus-ewyqLj2D1RlqK-je4w", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-04-08", "type": "review"}

I won't go into detail about the problem with my entree , because the evening manager came over to us, apologized, and the kitchen made me a new (and improved) entree right away.  The issue that I had trouble with, and I would think the higher management would to, is this;   As we were eating our dinners (at the bar) one of the bartenders, who had been working, helping us all night, clocked out, and took a seat next to us at the bar. The manager, who had respectfully introduced himself to us earlier, and apologized for my meal, was standing behind the bar counting a register, or something, I really don't know what he was doing, but the bartender , who in my eye, is still an employee and who just waited on us (along with a really good blonde bartender) began throwing ice (from her drink) at the face of the manager. The first ice block hit him in the ear and he looked up at her and said. \"Ouch. That hurt\".  She giggled and proceeded to throw more ice at him and giggle.  One chunk of ice hit him in the eye.  He seemed like he was upset, but just walked away.  Makes me wonder what kind of manager he is to A) allow an employee to throw ice at him, on the dining floor, in front of customers and B) Why was she so comfortable doing it.   It totally made me disrespect him and feel sorry for him, and he was the manager on duty.  If he would have approached me about my meal after that scenario played out, not sure I would have taken him seriously.

It's been on the map for as long as I can remember and it's been the same icky, weird staff and \"just okay\" Japanese food for just as long. \n\nIn any case, it makes a compelling case as as nicer than average restaurant. It's a large building and has all the hallmarks of a great Japanese eatery. Sushi bar, live seafood you can choose yourself, and management that hires native Japanese to serve you. All signs point to greatness!\n\nSomewhere between the Greatness road sign and the arrival at actual Greatness, someone seems to have taken Mr. Potential and kicked his teeth in before repeatedly punching his groin and laughing as he robbed him of his money. \n\nLet me explain:\n\nI have give this place repeated chances to show me that it's worth the real estate it's planted on and repeatedly I have felt like Mr. Potential must have felt after his beating. \n\nI've been there with groups, alone, on dates and each time it's either inattentive or rude wait staff and middling food that isn't anywhere near the price of admission.\n\nThe last (and final) time I went to Ichi Ban (ironically meaning Number 1 in Japanese HA!) I took my girlfriend of a year as a treat for both of us. Why did I go here? You ask a good question and I have no acceptable answer other than I may have subconsiously wanted to break it off with Sandie (I now have nick-named her \"The Sand Demon\" - say it out loud. It makes sense... seriously. Sand Demon... Sandie... but I digress) and this was a perfect way to do it. \n\nThe food was once again quite bad and to add insult to injury, after delivering our food our waiter began his assault. \n\nUpon finding out I speak fluent Japanese, he switched entirely over to speaking Japanese. Leaving me to translate everything into English for the Sand Demon. As if that weren't bad enough, he began asking me if she was \"a dirty girl\" because she sure looked like one to him. \n\nI couldn't believe what he was asking me and definitely wasn't going to translate it for Sand Demon, but just in case I misunderstood him, I asked him to explain what he meant. He went on about how she had a nice rack and long legs and that she just looks like a good time in the sack. \n\nSome people might view this as a compliment in some way, but I usually don't have kind words for a guy who tells me my girlfriend looks whorish and a good lay. I told him in my most polite Japanese that he'd never get the chance to find out since he most likely couldn't get laid in a brothel and we left. \n\nAt the time it wasn't funny, but it's pretty funny now. Sure, he was being rude but in retrospect she was kind of a whore. But there's no review area for ex's by the name of Sand Demon so that's all I'll say about that... for now.", "business_id": "rHFWPJML2WlGbad0Tqevxw", "stars": 1, "date": "2008-04-07", "type": "review"}

Other than being a good worker there was no incentive or him to do that. Are they supposed to? Yes. Do they? Heck no. Anyone who has spent anytime as a restaurant employee can tell you, most people are too worried about their own tables and thus their pocket book to bother to help out another server during a rush. Just look at the fake smiles next time you make a group of reluctant servers sing your brat Happy Birthday. I wanted to offer the guy a job right then and there. Doesn't matter what his skills or training is, I can turn anybody with a good work ethic into a superstar where I work. The surprise helper's name was Eric by the way. Ask for him by name. \n\nMy prime rib was melt in your mouth. Seriously was that good. I ordered it rare because of too many recent bad experiences of overcooked steaks. The au jus was seasoned just right. Recently the brown mud water most places tries to pass off as au jus has the flavor profile of rusty tap water with less enjoyment. Jen's sirloin, cooked perfectly. And if that wedge salad she had was a quarter head, then the whole thing must have been the size of a basketball. Huge!  \n\nI don't want to forget Elijah.

But just because you're job as spinning signage on a corner street isn't as glamorous as you thought it would be, don't treat the person who is bringing you your food like a subhuman being. I think every person should have to wait tables for at least six months before they are allowed to go out to eat. I watched Elijah run at least four tables flawlessly. Carrying trays towering with plates and food. The kids at one table were served right away and got their drinks so they didn't whine (they still did). Sitter? Anyone heard of a sitter? And each of the three tables next to us cried around about their food. Elijah smiled and apologized and handled it like a trooper. Great job. He was a stud at multi-tasking.

Our waitress was VERY forgetful. Forgot 3 or 4 times on stuff we wanted. Other than that, great place to eat.

Then to top the meal off you get to choose a dessert, I am personally a sucker for their chocolate cake but the cheesecake is very good as well.

With that said, it was possibly a foolish decision to pick the 9oz. lobster tail but at $30.99 the assumption it would be edible was made. This was a poor assumption. It was extremely tough, completely tasteless and in some parts raw. It's clear the chef was not qualified in any way to prepare this dish as a cursory glance would have told him it wasn't cooked evenly. The discovery of raw shellfish was enough to stop me in my tracks and just not bother with it anymore. But the poor quality of this was the least of my complaints come 2am. My understanding is that foodborne illness is most commonly linked to poorly washed lettuce/vegetables which I had in the form of a distinctly average Caesar salad as a starter. Perhaps I am inclined to automatically point the finger at the lobster due to its general awfulness and the overwhelming resentment of having paid close to $80 for two meals that were simply terrible. Or maybe it was the vomit streaming out of my nose for six hours. Could be a mix of both. Regardless, this was not an experience I'd ever want to repeat and despite the manager's inevitable defense, \"You may not have gotten it from here, could have been incubating\", I'm pretty sure had I bagged and tagged a sample of regurgitated Lobster, it would've been conclusive. Having not had food poisoning for a very long time, I was reminded of how grabbing a sample of puke at the time of its production is not at the forefront of your mind. Perhaps, had I'd gone to law school this would have been my first action.  Regardless of my failure to apply to and complete law school, I won't be stepping foot back in this place. In fairness, the manager did offer us a gift card as compensation. I briefly thought about giving it to someone I dislike but came to the conclusion there's no one I despise that much and so declined the offer.", "business_id": "OjNTZTZ6HYQghJN-3jmwnA", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-03-22", "type": "review"}

We always sit at the bar because we really enjoy the interaction of a bartender.\n\nHowever, last night, we went on a date to celebrate...and something went wrong right from the beginning.  While the bartender said hello, she left us sitting there with no drink menu and no offer to get us something to drink for about five minutes.  The well was NOT slammed and there were a total of three bartenders, a bar back, and a manager behind the bar during that entire time.  I'm not usually that picky, but I felt very dismissed from the very beginning.\n\nThe bartender came back and asked if we would like something to drink and introduced herself as Katie.  She took our order and brought my husband's beer while I waited another few minutes for my glass of wine.  When she came back, she asked if we wanted appetizers.  I asked for a full menu and she went off for another five minutes, making drinks, talking with another server, and in search of menus.  \n\nNow, I know that I have higher expectations of many places (especially restaurants that charge an average of $26 a plate) and while I understand we were there at eight pm on a Saturday night, I felt really unappreciated and unwelcome.  Our food arrived in a timely manner and it was good - not great.  I took her recommendation on the steak and was disappointed - the steak had a fat marble running through it (one thing they point out not having on the front page of their menu) and they took away hubby's lobster butter before he was finished eating.  He used the bread butter for his lobster!  I mean, come on.  For an $80 meal?\n\nKatie really redeemed herself at the end of the night.  I mentioned that I didn't care for her particular recommendation.  She offered to replace it but I really don't like to send food back unless it is awful.  She bought our two drinks to make up for it, which earned her a 30% tip.  \n\nI am usually so happy at the Keg...but this one merited a review of distaste.", "business_id": "xMK01ZbVUYLLoyqoeWAIVw", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-05-02", "type": "review"}

We went to the Keg with their birthday club coupon (see instructions below) and had a great meal for a steal of a price. I feel like I got away with something to good to be true, so much so, that I want to go back to make a deposit in my karma bank. \n\nFirst of all, Keg has a great happy hour that I always seem to forget about until I go there for dinner. This time, we remembered right as we were walking in and decided to sit in the bar for dinner (good decision #2, #1 was going there in the first place). \n\nBriana was our server and she was great! Very friendly, the perfect balance of attentive but not overly so. Never seemed like we were annoying her with our \"one more minute\" or \"on the side\" requests. Nor, did she seemed bothered by the fact that we had the email birthday coupon for a free prime rib dinner ($23 value). The best part is you don't even have to get the prime rib, you can get anything you want want and they credit your check for the $23. \n\nHappy hour is M-F 4-7 with a few $5 appetizers, half price wines by the glass, draft beers, and $3.75 Orange Crush Martinis (one of the best martinis ever!). The only thing is that HH is only in the bar or the patio. So, if you'll take a moment to connect the dots with me, I can have dinner in the dining area and pay full price for glass of wine, or I can eat dinner in the bar and get the wine for half price. Um, I think the answer is obvious. \n\nDinner was great. We both ordered from the seasonal crab menu. I got the mushroom and crab crusted sirloin and the birthday boy got the sirloin topped with crab and roasted red pepper sauce. Both came with a potato side (baked for me, mashed for him). Everything was cooked perfectly to our request and so delish! \n\nToward the end of my meal, I reached what I like to call the \"point of no return.\" This is where there is not enough to take home, but just enough to push me over the edge of way too full if I eat it all. While I was just about to go in for it and stuff myself, Briana showed up to check on us. She easily made the decision for me and said \"Take it home!\" Maybe three to four bites of my sirloin left and she not only didn't make me feel like an idiot for wanting to save it, but she encouraged it. I heart her! Added half of the baked potato, a piece of the delicious soft bread, and the thick tomato slice garnish from the boys plate.  Plenty for lunch tomorrow!\n\nOh, and one more thing I love about the Keg; Keg size glasses of wine. A nine ounce pour at a great price. Perfect for two people to each get one when they want a little more than one glass, but not quite enough to finish a whole bottle! And with the 1/2 price wines by the glass during happy hour, it's AMAZING!! \n\nOK, here is what I think you need to do. \n1 - go to kegsteakhouse.com and sign up for their newsletter (birthday club). \n2 - check your email at the beginning of the month of your birthday. \n3 - go to the Keg (with the coupon, if you can wait that long, or when ever you just want a good meal) \n4 - sit in the bar, M-F, from 4-7, for happy hour drinks and appetizers. \n5 - if you're still hungry, order dinner and eat in the bar area, getting the best of both worlds! \n6 - don't forget about the draft beers for $3, the Keg size wine pours, and the ultimate Orange Crush Martini!!! \n7 - rinse and repeat, I mean go back again and again . . . \n\nI'm going to!", "business_id": "xMK01ZbVUYLLoyqoeWAIVw", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-05-26", "type": "review"}

Very good value in just oz per dollar; however they also age the beef and offer 2 infrequent choices for how you would like it cooked: blue rare on one end of the spectrum and Chicago style as an oddball.  Chicago means the outside will be charred and the inside will be whatever temp you want it.  I went for Chicago rare, and it was so amazing I didn't use the onion straws or saut\u00e9ed mushrooms that come with it.  I also only had a tiny bite of my twice baked which was very good, but I couldn't spare the room since its a 20 oz cut.  The tempura snap peas and asparagus were light crisp and wonderful.  The bartender was great and did well with a basil gimlet that was sweeter than I usually allow, but the agave and elderberry went really well with the citrus.\nAlso, this place looks to require headshots from all staff when applying, but in addition to all being very attractive they all had their hustle on and were keepin the place moving.\n\nUpdate: 2nd showing?  Still a mighty good steak, but much worse service.  The bartender was very concerned about closing and not so much serving me.

The staff was very accommodating and friendly.  The server was excellent.  He checked in often, presented himself very well and was attentive to our needs.  We had a bottle of Ridge that was delicious.  The brie appetizer was very good.  Now onto the steak:  Each of us ordered a bacon wrapped filet medium rare.  Unfortunately, the steak came wrapped in bacon fat and was cooked closer to rare vs medium rare.  At times I'll order my steak rare or rare + so this wasn't a problem for me, but the bacon grizzle was unappetizing.  We had the creme brulee for dessert and it was average.  The Keg does a good job, but if the could pay a little more attention to detail with respect to the food.  I think they try and turn out the food too fast and it just doesn't compare to other steak houses.  Definitely a AAA club.

We have eaten at The Keg before and loved it, which is why we chose to return.  We were seated at a  wonderful corner table with round seating just for the two of us.  The waitress and all other staff were efficient, courteous and friendly, yet professional.  Our issue was with the food, and specifically with our entrees.  First off, The Keg had a weird menu that night, and I think it's temporary, where the only choices were crab and steak.  I chose the Dungeness Crab ($31) and my husband had New York Steak embellished with crab and other seafood ($33).  My crab was a lot of work to crack open and all, which for some reason I just didn't remember I'd be doing that when I ordered it.  So I was up to the task, but the crab meat inside was just very mediocre and a bit discolored....measly, not plump and luscious.  The garlic potatoes accompanying my crab were dry, and I had to keep taking drinks of water between each bite.   My husband's steak was the worst.  It was tough to chew (even though it was medium rare) and seemed to be fettered with some kind of gristly meshing.  We purchase our beef from a frozen foods delivery truck to eat at home.  Our beef is at least 50 times better than what we ate at The Keg.  The Keg was aware it was our anniversary, as was our waitress, yet nothing special was done as it normally is when we go out to celebrate something special.  Usually restaurants (like Flemings, Va Bene, and Lon's) will bring a special little dessert or chocolates for us to share to commemorate the occasion.  I don't think we'll be returning to The Keg for quite awhile now.

They were also nice and crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, served with a nice caper mayo with a hint of spicy.  The squirt of lemon added the right touch.  \n\nNice restaurant, a bit pricey but a good place for a romantic dinner.  The decor needs some work since the paintings/wall art had pictures of women's legs and people talking intimately.

Unfortunately, I was not impressed.\nI guess I expected a waiter like SpongeBob when he cleared his mind of everything but fine dining and breathing.  But what I got was just a regularly decent wait staff.  Nothing wrong with that, but I thought there'd be an \"experience\" to go along with the price here.  Nope.\n\nWe had a party of about 18 for a couple grads in the family.  I will say that we were all given good attention by our waiter, and he did a fine job earning his tip.  Its just that there wasn't anything special about the service that you wouldn't find at Applebee's or something.\n\nThe food was an experience, though.\nI had plenty of time to look the menu over a thousand times (late people, I swear).  The cheapest thing on the menu was in fact on the kids' menu.  But we were there for a special occasion, and it was a steak house that featured....steak.  So I would've kicked myself for ordering anything other than steak.\n\nI may have paid $50 for it, but good lord that rib-eye was the best steak I ever had.  No exaggeration. \nLike I said, I've never been to a restaurant like this, so maybe that's why I've never had a steak that good.  And I know there are probably competitors for the best steak in Chandler and the surrounding cities.  But for me, this is as good as its ever gotten.  If there is a steak that tastes better than this, I don't know if I could handle it emotionally.  I'd probably start crying.\n\nI don't have to describe it.  If you eat steak, then you know what a good steak tastes like.  This one tasted like tha; probably better.  Flawless.\n\nOf course, all sides are extra.  I ordered nothing but the meat, as I guess I'm a little too budget-minded for this place.  The pop I ordered took the place of potatos or a salad.  \n\nPeople ordered the lambchops, chicken, sliced filet mignon, crab cakes, and some other stuff.  The only complaint was about the french fries haha.  I didn't try them.  I will say that the wedge salads looked great and were very big.  Also, as far as the amount of food you get, the chicken seemed to offer the biggest portion size.  Honestly though, everybody paid so much for their food that I didn't want to ask anyone if i could try their stuff.\n\nIt really is a nice place, too...at least I think so.  The lights are dim so people won't see you frown at the prices.  The napkins are fancy...and so are the ones in the bathroom apparently, as my cuz brought one out to show me.  It is not quiet - but not louder than any other restaurant.  From what I read and hear people say, a fine dining place is supposed to be quiet and stuff.  If that matters to you, perhaps this isn't fine enough for you, because its just like any place else volume-wise.\n\nPerhaps 3 stars is stiffing them a bit.  I mean, my meal was perfect...the service was good...and the ambiance was nice.  Am I just too much of a cheapo?  Did I expect too much of an experience for the price?  Maybe.  But I still feel that everything except the steak could have been just a tad better.  If there is ever another reason to go fine-dining, I'm sure I would suggest some place else instead of coming here again.  I saw what they have to offer...and despite the awesome steak, it just wasn't enough to bring me back.", "business_id": "0ONypOKIhttBz9IJzBE8jg", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-05-29", "type": "review"}

I took my fiance for his birthday dinner - and from start to finish - every employee we encountered wished him a happy birthday! At the end, the waitress brought over a box of chocolates and a giftcard to come back for $25 off.  It was truly a good experience.  The food was delicious - expensive but very nice for a special occasion. The steak was absolutely delicious - melts in your mouth. He had the ribeye and he said it was the best steak he has ever had.  I had the chef's featured  entree - 2 four ouce bacon wrapped filets, 2 scallops, and 2 shrimps.  I asked for all shrimps and this was no problem at all!! Mine came with some asparagus as well.  Both entrees came out perfect - from the cook temperature to the specific personalizations to each dish!  The complimentary bread and calamari appetizer  we started with was sooooOOO yummy and the portion size was great! The sides left a little to be desired - we tried the Fleming's potatoes and the macarroni and cheese - both were only okay and did not stand out.  I would invest some money and time into revamping those sides - they did not compliment or stand out like the steaks did!! Similarly...the desserts were only okay for us. We had the donuts and the cheesecake. Overall, a great experience. I would definitely come back - especially on a special occasion - this place knows how to make that person feel good and recongized! I would pass on the desserts and would consider trying other side dishes or passing on them altogether. $10-$13 per side dish is too expensive to be mediocre.", "business_id": "0ONypOKIhttBz9IJzBE8jg", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-03-24", "type": "review"}

I've gone to the Scottsdale and Lincoln location quite a few times, and have received nothing but stellar service each of those visits. Tonight, I cannot say the same about the Chandler location. \n\nLet's begin by Brittany (our server) coming to take our drink orders... It took close to 20 minutes (18 to be exact) to receive our drinks. We hadn't seen our server and was wondering where she had went, so we had asked a near by server if he can find out where Brittany was because our table was ready to order. Long story longer... A girlfriend of mine had ordered a $155 bottle of Caymus, the server had her sample it, and my girlfriend told the server the wine needed to be filtered. Brittany disregard what we had requested and poured it into a glass pitcher (can't think of the name for container she poured the wine in) and never came back. We finally had to tell the young gal that was helping Brittany serve the table we wanted the wine to be filtered because of the sediment. This gal kept challenging us... Stating why didn't we tell Brittany this in the beginning... And we told her we did, but she never came back to do it. Mind you, there was 3/4 of the bottle left, it was not like anyone drank the bottle and demanded anything for free. My boyfriend who is in the restaurant industry... A GM of a restaurant in North Scottsdale would not have let something like this slip without touching the table. No manager came to touch on the table as this was an on-going challenge of the night. This went on for the majority part of our visit until we watched the manager  go into the wine cellar with our other server to grab another bottle we had requested. \n\nPoint is, no one touched the table. Despite of the challenge for the night with the wine, you would've at least expect a manager to come by because no one had taken responsibility for such poor service we left quite disappointed... Can't expect a decent tip if you do not receive decent service. I think holding yourself ACCOUNTABLE is a major issue at tonight's visit. No accountability whatsoever. I highly suggest someone in charge reading, 'Leaders Eat Last'. It's a great read on leadership. \n\nTonight's visit left a really bad taste in my mouth. Very poor service! Brittany did not return to our table as she left it for the other gal to take care of us. I know how intimidating and frustrating it can be to serve, because I myself have served for 5 years while going through college, but at a place like Fleming's I don't see why you cannot be successful when all the tools you need are right in front of you. Being in the service industry isn't for everyone, it takes a lot of patience, and customer service skills. You work in this industry to be of at service to people no matter how bad a night is going.\n\nDo not have any reasons to return.", "business_id": "0ONypOKIhttBz9IJzBE8jg", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-05-17", "type": "review"}

However, for the high price of everything (not just the steaks) on the menu, we would've expected the place to feel more exclusive, more fancy, not so loud. It felt like a nice bar rather than a fine dining establishment. We had to shout over the noise and the place wasn't even totally full (Sunday evening). The plates were also nothing special to look at. Again because of the price, we expected a few frills. The meat and separate sides came out just plainly put onto plates. No effort was put into the presentation. Even casual restaurants throw some greens or garnishes on the dish for a little extra aesthetic. Probably won't return.

I ordered it medium rare, but it was probably closer to medium, but still very flavorful, tender, and juicy.  They season only with salt and pepper to really let the true beef flavor come through.  This reminded me of the rib eye at Delmonico's (Emeril Lagasse's restaurant) inside Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas, which is also an excellent steak house.\n\nMy girlfriend got the fillet mignon (medium plus) with stuffed flounder.  Maybe because the fillet was medium plus, I really couldn't appreciate it as much.  The flounder was excellent.\n\nEverything is a la carte, so it can get kind of pricey.  We got the lobster chowder (one of the best I've had), creamed corn (very good), sauteed spinach (excellent alternative to creamed spinach, surprisingly very good), and chocolate lava souffle for dessert (which is a must).\n\nThe bread is also really good.

I thought it would be packed, but it wasn't.  Since I hadn't had Meat for a while, I was looking forward to this dinner.\n\nAfter browsing the menu, I decided to go for the Porcini Rubbed Filet Mignon (center cut, grilled high country Asparagus\nspears, Gorgonzola Cream Sauce).  For a side dish, I selected the Chipotle Mac & Cheese.  My friends ordered a bottle of Wine and we were good to go!\n\nThe Filet was soooo good!  The Gorgonzola Cream Sauce added a rich, creamy flavor to the succulent center cut Filet.  I requested it Medium and it was cooked to perfection.  The Chipotle Mac & Cheese was a perfect complement to the Filet.....I highly recommend it.\n\nThe service was pretty good to.  Our glasses of Wine were never empty and we ordered a Chocolate Lava Cake w/Vanilla Ice Cream & Whipped Cream and split it between the 3 of us.  It was awesome!\n\nOverall, it was a great dinner with good friends.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%", "business_id": "9AbyBqGWHYZC73GlyAuTrQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-05-04", "type": "review"}

Also, the seafood tower; it had some pretty excellent items  like the jumbo shrimp and the king crab leg, but it was extremely light on the lobster and the lump crab salad was bland and subpar.\n\nA couple other notes: They have some really tasty homemade butter spreads they serve with the breadbasket.  The place looks great inside, and the service was excellent with the only hiccup being a long wait for our first cocktail.  My only other complaint would be the wine list; there are plenty of bottles in the $30-40 range but most of them are from the cheap aisle at your grocery store.

The main course came out shortly after and my steak was cooked perfectly to my order. My boyfriend's steak was a little undercooked but it was no big deal. Lobster was also fantastic, our server de shelled our lobsters for us. Perfect. I couldn't finish my steak but I did manage to snatch the rest of my boyfriend's lobster, yay! Then came the desert of my dreams. I had the deconstructed s'mores and it was to die for. The marshmallow was perfectly fluffy and with the scotch in the chocolate, it wasn't overwhelmingly sweet. I would actually come back every day just to get this for my sweets fix. \n\nPrice: We had an amazing deal, but seriously, don't come here if you're not willing to put your wallet to work. \n\nOverall, great service, ambiance, and food. \n\nP.S. Writing this as I finish the rest of my s'mores.", "business_id": "9AbyBqGWHYZC73GlyAuTrQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-04-29", "type": "review"}
