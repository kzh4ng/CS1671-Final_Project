Great they were, with superb steaks, outstanding service and old club style ambiance. This was always a top place for business and special occasion dining.

Landry's, who are owners of over 35 restaurants and chains many you would be familiar with now own Morton's too. Morton's no longer has a focus on their original identity, meaning and purpose but are being changed in a modernized way. On my last visit changes were visible. Some changes and cost cutting and commercializing has begun. The menu is changed to include items which will appeal to a broader clientele. Now profits and growth are a bigger part of the strategy. \nGone is the famous GM Bill. Bill was as much an institution as the restaurant he ran. Changed too seem to be the quality of the steaks. Our ribeyes were not a recognizable ribeye cut and the taste was not there as we remembered.

FAIL OPEN TABLE REVIEWS!\n\nMorton's The Steakhouse, to the average joe, is a special occasion treat. It's prices are out of this world, especially when everything is a la carte. The restaurant-going public at large has gotten used to dining where choosing an entree entitles you to choose soup or salad, a vegetable and a starch. I've been here before, so I know not to expect anything with my steak besides a plate and flatware. Oh, and a napkin (and to be totally honest, bread and a glass, complete with water).\n\nHowever, since the star of the show here is steak, it's almost sacrilege to choose anything else. C'mon, the speciality of the house is right there in the restaurant's name! I went with the \"Signature Cut New York Strip.\" To be totally frank, it is quite possibly the best steak on the face of the planet. It comes with a beautiful char, perfectly cooked to perfection, with nary a blemish to be found. You will be using your knife, but never to cut away grizzle or fat. How does a steak taste this good, chew this well, and not have any fat vein? Not quite sure, but Morty seems to have it down to a science. My companion had the \"Center Cut Prime Ribeye\" and she agreed with my assessment of perfection.\n\nI saw many of the apps and sides being delivered to other tables, but after a soup (which I will describe in a moment) and steak, who could eat so much. The Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail app looked tantalizing, old-school style on a wide-rimmed glass, complete with dry-iced fog effects. The mashed potatoes and mac & cheese looked tempting, and were large enough to feed a group, but I can't attest to the flavor.\n\nWe started with a loaf of exceptional warm bread with flecks of toasted onion on the crust. It had a wonderful crumb, and I'd buy it from a bakery in a heartbeat. To begin I started with the Lobster Bisque, and my companion began with a Center-Cut Iceberg, or wedge salad. The wedge seemed perfectly adequate, inspire of it's Flintstones size. We both agreed that the Lobster Bisque was sublime! It had an incredible depth of lobster stock flavor. Speaking only for myself, though the bisque is the main attraction, the lobster island usually found floating in the middle is akin to the cherry topping an ice cream sundae. And I save it for the final sayonara spoonfuls. And in this case, it actually took down with it what went before. It was so overcooked as to be inedible, and rarely is ANYTHING inedible to moi. It had the mouthfeel of an underdone sponge, or perhaps soggy cotton balls. What a disappointment! I really couldn't tell if it was over or underdone.\n\nSo that last payoff, combined with the waiter's never-ending push to inflate the bill with dining accoutrements, were the only demerits from an otherwise exceptional meal!", "business_id": "90Fqfzd8zD9AuuNBSv9lAg", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-01-18", "type": "review"}

From the valet service to dessert everything was fantastic-you of course are paying for it.  It was a wintery night and $9 for valet parking was fine by us.  The valet was very concerned about my heels getting caught in the grates on the sidewalk! We used Opentable to make reservations although it wasn't as crowded as I expected for a Saturday night. We were seated right away at a side booth which was perfect for two. Our waiter was fantastic and I started off with one of the specialty cocktails and my date ordered red wine. The drinks are pricey so beware-$15 each for the glass of nothing fancy red wine and the specialty cocktails are also $15 each.  It was Pittsburgh restaurant week so I went with the $35 3 course meal which I thought was a fantastic deal.  You had your choice of any salad. I went with the cob salad which was a smaller portion but just right for me. With 4 entrees to choose from I went with the 6 oz filet and mashed potatoes (choice of one side).  They were both fantastic. I ordered the chocolate moose for dessert thinking it was cake rather than a small bowl of rich dark chocolate moose but it was still pretty good. My date went with the $59.99 3 course option that included seafood. I believe they have this option anytime.  He started out with a full size caesar salad which included very tasty homemade croutons. Along with the 6 oz filet you also were able to choose a seafood side. He went with the bacon wrapped scallops (they give you 2 huge ones) and baked potato for his side. What I loved about the baked potato option is they bring out a topping bars complete with butter, sour cream and bacon.  For dessert he went with the chocolate molten cake with a side of vanilla ice cream which was to die for!!

Usually when I go to restaurant weeks I don't expect the same quality if I came in any other week. I also am skeptical of how much I would enjoy expensive chain restaurants. I was pleasantly surprised when I came to Morton's. I thought everything was pretty good, so I think I want to try when it's not restaurant week to see how much better it is. \n\nStarted off with a tuna tartar and it was delicious. The tuna and avocado with their sauce as a garnish was great. The tuna seemed very fresh. For my entree I opted for the steak. It was tender and not chewy at all. It was perfectly cooked (medium rare) and required no other sauces besides how it was prepared. My friend got the pork chop which was also very well cooked. I can't pick which I preferred more. For the sides the mash potatoes were great. Creamy and buttery. But the broccoli side I got was pretty lack luster. It stated bland and as if they just boiled it for a few minutes. I would not recommend unless bland is what you're going for. For dessert we got a chocolate mouse which was way too rich in my opinion. We could only have a few bites each before it got to be too much. Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e left a bit to the imagination. The caramelization on top was mediocre and the creme was a very faint in taste. Plating of the dishes seemed very minimal, but I'm not sure if it was because of restaurant week or not. If not, there is improvement to be had. \n\nI enjoyed the entrees and the appetizer so I struggled between a 3 and 4 but gave the higher score because of service.

It's got a very casual atmosphere. The food service is almost \"cafeteria style\" meaning you get in line, place your order and by the time you get to the register your sandwich is either wrapped for takeout or in a basket ready to be paid for. You can then seat yourself at either the bar or at one of the tables. It's unique in the fact that it could be classified as either a deli a restaurant or a bar. As a deli you can purchase corned beef and other lunch meats and deli items by the pound. As a restaurant you can get a good sandwich, salad, and/or side for lunch. But then again, it's a full service bar with a few craft beers on tap and you could get a cocktail or beer and also enjoy some grub.\n\nI was in the mood for a quality sandwich today so I stopped in and had the \"Famous Special\" -- a sandwich that sports a generous portion of corned beef with your choice of slaw or kraut (I got the kraut), a slice of Swiss cheese and Russian dressing all between two slices of fresh bread from a local North Side bakery called the Breadworks (I got the marble although I could have chosen rye, wheat, white, Russian rye, a Kaiser roll or an onion roll). A pickle wedge on the side compliments the sandwich nicely. Although there was a line of about ten people in front of me, I don't think it took more than three minutes to get my sandwich. The staff behind the counter don't do much chatting with the customers and its clear efficiency (without being rude) is the rule. \n\nI had wanted a quality sandwich in and a quality sandwich is what I got.

It's one of my favorite weekday after-work places to visit and I come here often.\n\nThe restaurant has a real hardwood grill that is is located in full view of the main dining room and baths the neighborhood with the smokey sweet smell of grilled meats that makes you salivate and your stomach ache for food.  It's one of those things that makes you feel that this place is going to be great - you cannot wait to get inside and order.\n\nThe interior always has a great vibe.  High tin-covered ceilings, old-school wood bar, exposed red brick, and denim tablecloths cover tables that are closely-spaced and nearly always full with patrons happily eating and drinking.  Arrive at a peak time, any weekday or weekend evening, and you'll likely be getting a drink at that nice bar while you wait for a table.  That's OK - the bar is fully stocked, with local Penn Pilsner on tap (along with other good beers), and service is attentive and efficient.  Don't forget to take a look at the chalkboard on the wall to see today's specials.\n\nWhat to order:  You must try a burger here - I virtually guarantee that it will be one of the best you've ever had.  Tessaro's grinds their beef for their burgers fresh daily, and they rely on their own recipe for their ground beef that mixes different cuts of beef in a predetermined proportion to achieve a balance of taste and the right amount of succulent fat - both for taste and for the right amount of drippings onto that hardwood fire which flares and sears the outside of the burger with tasty good stuff.  The burger is nicely-sized, with a great selection of cheeses and toppings, and grilled to your desired level of doneness.  This is the only restaurant where I frequently order a burger without any trimmings - just so I can taste the beef in all of its smokey goodness.\n\nA wish:  I wish they made better side dishes to accompany their burgers.  They offer some good side dishes: potato salad, steamed fresh vegetables; and some side dishes that could be better, especially the home fries, which tend to be soggy, greasy, and/or burnt.  They don't offer french fries.  I think offering a proper french fry - made with freshly-cut potatoes, first par-fried at a lower temperature and then flash-fried at a very high temperature to order would go a very long way toward perfection.\n\nTheir soups are OK, and, strangely, a good portion of their menu is listed as \"Mexican\" fare.  They don't need it, and would be better off limiting that fantastic hardwood grill to burgers, steaks, and fish specials.\n\nIf you haven't visited yet, you will not be disappointed.

Considering I'm a vegetarian and this is a steakhouse, it was strange that I had lunch at Morton's yesterday.

It feels even stranger to say that they did and it was good! \n\nMorton's exceeded my expectations by quite a lot. \n\nFirst of all, Krista, their Sales & Mktng Manager, was incredibly accommodating. I emailed her ahead of time to see if they had a meatless option, and she was great about writing back quickly and gave me the alternative course, which was fully vegetarian, and even asked for confirmation if it would work. I said yes, and it did. \n\nThe fist plate they served was a delicious deviled egg salad (they made sure I wasn't vegan before bringing this out). It was HUGE and very good. The serving size was actually enough to split between four people! The deviled eggs were diced into mini cubes and really nicely evenly spread throughout the salad. I loved the dressing too, though I'm not sure exactly what it was. I think it was ranch. \n\nThe main course was another gigantic plate. It was filled with broccoli, sauteed spinach, mushrooms, and grilled tomatoes. To look at, it was not that special, but the sauce that was added to all the vegetables was mouthwatering and made a plate of vegetables taste amazing. I also was served a ginormous bowl of mashed potatoes (also yummilious!). \n\nBy the time dessert was ready, I was absolutely stuffed. I asked for my cheesecake to go and shared it with my parents when we had dinner. The portion was so large and it was soo rich that even though we split it three ways, it was still filling! \n\nThe staff was very professional and the place was nice.

Oh the food.  I was unsure what cut of steak to go with and my server recommended his favorite cut.  To be honest, I can't tell you what it was, but it was beautiful and perfectly cooked.

In other words, this place oozes of old money, but you don't have to dress to the nines in order to enjoy service here; as long as you don't dress like you're about to attend a GWAR concert, you won't be denied service.\n\nOur attentive waitress, Beth, could not have been more instrumental in helping us decide what to eat. I was jonesing for a good red wine, but I wasn't much in the mood to down an entire bottle on my own (my wife doesn't like red wine, and I don't like white, so that negates our wine choosing); she recommended a rich and full-bodied Rioja by the glass, so smooth and elegant that I would have enjoyed another glass were I more inclined to do so.\n\nWe started with the prosciutto-wrapped mozzarella, lightly sauteed and garnished with fresh basil and vine tomatoes. Absolutely lovely, and the prosciutto is from Parma, and not the poser variety most restaurants and delis try to pawn off on you. The crostinis were a delight as well. My wife also enjoyed a wedge salad with a tangy blue cheese dressing.\n\nAs for the main event, my wife chose the lobster and crab-stuffed shrimp; think of this as looking akin to a stuffed tomato, lightly glazed and very delicious. I went for the steak Au Poivre, rubbed with peppercorns and served with a cognac (Courvoisier?) sauce. Oh. My. GOODNESS! Tender, with a swift bite to it, thanks to the peppercorns. We shared a neatly-prepped side of sauteed spinach, and the parmesan truffle fries; this was perhaps the only disappointment, as the fries seemed to lack the prerequisite amount of parmesan so as to not make the fries taste like, well, fries.\n\nWe topped off our gastric orgy with an off-the-menu layered carrot cake, large enough for two. There was no way we could finish it, but, man, we gave it our best.\n\n$180 for dinner? Yeah, so what?

The other was a basic chef's with a champagne vinaigrette.  Was good, nothing to write home about.\n\nThen came the steaks.  We both ordered medium rare(as YOU should)  The tournedos with morel crust were raw in the middle but still pretty tasty.  Very subtle on the morel.  My kona rubbed sirloin was a little past medium.  $42 steak that wasn't even cooked right, WOW!  Decent flavor, but I could easily cook a better steak with a good beef an iron skillet and above average salt.  The sides lacked luster.  Just had some potatoes and greens.\n\nThen came desert, SO GOOD.  We had a cheesecake and a flan of sorts.  Both were amazing.  They were pretty much the only reason that I didn't complain about the meal.\n\nAll in all, it was restaurant week and I know they just push people through, but I was thoroughly disappointed.", "business_id": "CChwRoYVXA3QZulS8a6xOQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-02-09", "type": "review"}

In December a friend brought my sister and I here for our Xmas present.  LeeAnn D's review summs up that experience perfectly except she left out the bread basket.

As a thank you for the meal in Dec, the manager gave my friend a $50 gift card for a return visit that had to be used by beginning of Feb, so we decided to eat here again.  Mixed green salad was good, dressing on the side though otherwise it drowns the lettuce.  Porcini rubbed tournedos of beef were excellent, and I actually couldn't finish both.  The mashed potatos were probably the best I have ever had anywhere.  You just knew there was 3 sticks of butter and a ton of heavy cream in there, but they were simply amazing.  The creamed spinach however, tasted like soap, bleh.  Our server replaced them when we told her they tasted funny, but the 2nd batch just had a milder soapy flavor.  Still this was not enough to ruin an otherwise perfect meal.  Creme brulee to finish up and the chocolate espresso cake to go since my friend doesn't care for dessert, was a great ending to the meal.\n\nWith the gift card and the restaurant week pricing it made this meal with 4 glasses of wine and 2 cocktail about $43 pre tip.  Tip on the pre discounted amount and we still walked away paying $60 for a meal that could have been A LOT more expensive.

This place blew my mind and I have thought about it every week since New Years, plotting the next location I intend to visit. If we have a trip coming up, the first thing I do is consult the internet to see if there is one of these restaurants there. \n\nI lust over the on-line menu when I am at work; it is food porn. I relive the sensation of that buttery yet crunchy black/blue filet in my mouth. It was the best thing I have ever put in my mouth. I just closed my eyes and chewed slowly. We shared asparagus and out-of-this-world mushrooms. But I was so wrapped up in that filet I can't really recall what my husband had, lobster and tenderloin I think.\n\nI am not ashamed to say that I fully intend to (eventually) try everything on the menu. I do not care how much it costs or how much weight I may gain as a result! That is what running is for. And a paycheck. Worth every penny. \n\nService was beyond reproach. No one hovered or rushed us or disappeared at inopportune times. They took away our dirty plates with perfect timing. We did not have reservations far in advance; we got lucky and were able to eat within one hr of calling. Will have to remember that so I don't risk getting shut out on all of my future visits. \n\nAll this from a chain restaurant!?

My honey decided to surprise me for restaurant week and this was the place of choice. I was actually a bit disappointed when he told me since my first idea of their selection was initially incorrect. \n\nHe told me to dress up, and I was thinking he was crazy or something... dress up for bar food?? What? Ok... I have to admit, I'm pretty stubborn, so uttering the words, \"You were right\" as we walked in the door of this beautiful place wasn't easy. I felt as if I were an actress in the silver screen era with the beautiful artwork, and almost royal looking furnishings. The lights were set to a low romantic level and the place was buzzing with a sophisticated crowd. \n\nWhen we walked in and I got over the romantic candle lights flickering lazily in the dining area. The hosts and hostess were super attentive and We told them we had reservations. We were told there was still going to be a wait.,which I figured may be the case for restaurant week. They had some chairs to the side so we sat to the wayside, and watched a couple people get sat before us who came in after us. I went up and asked them for a menu and they realized we had been there for a bit. The hostess was great, and she put us at the top of the list to be sat. She apologized and we were fine. After we sat down we ordered, and the food came out in great time. \n\nHe ordered the 8 oz Kona Parmesan steak for his meal and I had the Salmon. The sides that came with these meals were spinach and mashed potatoes. Now, I've said that many places were good, and I've given many 5 star reviews, but MY GOD I think they should make an exception for even more stars for some places. \n\nWhen I took that first taste of my salmon... time stopped as my taste buds exploded. I thought it couldn't get any better, and then I tried the potatoes... If foodgasms were real. This is it folks. I'm serious... Capital Grill has the BEST food I have ever eaten in my entire life. I could have wept from the amazingness on my palate. The salmon was so juicy and perfect. The potatoes... oh those potatoes... I could write an entire review on those alone. Perfect. \n\nNow the most amazing part and quite possibly the best customer service I have ever experienced in my life. We got our bill and my honey had ordered an All American and then changed his mind and switched to a B&B, both drinks ended up being on the bill. We weren't upset by it at all, but a manager came over when he saw us looking around for our waitress. \n\nHe asked if everything was ok, and when we explained the mix up, he apologized profusely and told us he would take both drinks off of our bill!! We told him he didn't have to do that because we did have the one drink, but he insisted and said it would make his night to make this right for us. WOW!!! We were amazed!!\n\nThere is seriously nothing negative I can say about this place, and I think it'll be a great place for any special occasion.

This time around we made reservations to partake in their Restaurant Week menu, and it is the most affordable way to experience one of the better restaurants in the area.\n\nThe Capital Grill may be a chain, but it definitely doesn't feel like it. From the interior decor to the service to the actual food, everything screams upscale fancy-smancy...not something that is usually associated with a chain. We made reservations (highly recommended) and were seated almost immediately.\n\nOur server was very friendly and brutally honest. I guess she was forced to try to upsell us a $17 glass of wine but then told us how ridiculous it is and we shouldn't bother with it. When we did choose a bottle of wine she detoured us to a different bottle that was the same price but was more well-received. I'm glad we went with her recommendation because it ended up being an awesome bottle that we would have overlooked otherwise. \n\nFor the first course of the Restaurant Week menu I had the New England Clam Chowder. I am a sucker for clam chowda and this stuff was great. It wasn't overly heavy with cream and had a ridiculous amount of succulent clam chunks in it. This chowda definitely didn't skimp on the seafood, and the clams, potatoes and bacon were all melded nicely for some of the best I've had in awhile. The missus got the field green salad which was very nice, and came with an excellent champagne dressing that worked very well with the veggies. I was almost a little jealous of her salad, but I had chowder in front of me, so that feeling didn't last long.\n\nThe Restaurant Week menu was decent for entrees, with a few steak options as well as a chicken and salmon. I ordered the 14oz bone-in sirloin and this was one of the most magnificent steaks I've had in the Queen City. It was cooked to a perfect medium rare just as I ordered it, and it was a tender, juicy, tasty steak with an excellent beef flavor. It was such a huge steak that I only ate half and saved the rest for a leftover dinner the next night! \n\nThe missus had the Citrus Glazed Seared Salmon. It was a very nice piece of salmon that wasn't overpowering, and the glaze was really tasty. Her plate also came with some roasted asparagus that were cooked perfectly and had a nice sauce drizzled on top. Our table was also served shared side dishes of mashed potatoes and green beans. The potatoes were crazy rich, creamy and delicious, and there were still a few nice lumps mixed within the majority of the velvety mass, making these potatoes freaking awesome. The green beans were also tasty, and were tossed with tomatoes to give it a little extra pop.\n\nFor dessert we both shared the Cheesecake and Flourless Chocolate Espresso Cake. The cheesecake was actually more like a mousse, and so it was light as opposed to dense. It tasted wonderful and the top is caramelized to give it a crisp bite. It was served alongside a few berries and strawberry glaze, which made one delicious mouthful. The chocolate cake was just as good, if not slightly better. The espresso flavor is very light so if you're not a coffee fan don't be afraid to give this a whirl. The consistency of the cake was more like a chewy fudge, making it extremely decadent. \n\nThe Capital Grill is the place to go, so long as you have to cash. The food is all excellent and I would love to go back and try some other stuff out. The ambiance, service and food all scream swank, and it definitely feels like it warrants the extravagant price tag.", "business_id": "CChwRoYVXA3QZulS8a6xOQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-01-19", "type": "review"}

In spite of the clear flaws, if one has a party to host and a strong budget, then this place is definitely recommended.", "business_id": "CChwRoYVXA3QZulS8a6xOQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-01-02", "type": "review"}

There were 5 of us. Let me just say, it was incredible. I've done the Restaurant Week thing before on numerous occasions and, it's very easy to come across servers and restaurants that are focused on getting you in and out as quickly as possible. This was absolutely not the case here.\n\nBeing that it was Restaurant Week, there was a set menu for us to choose from. Unfortunately, there was not a vegetarian option (my fiancee is vegetarian), however the server spoke with the chef and they were able to come up with an incredible vegetarian pasta that she loved. The server was very conscious to avoid any soups that had a meat broth as well. In addition, at no point were any of our water glasses ever empty, every interaction with the server was met with a smile, and what's more important, we never felt rushed. The server found out that it was my dad's birthday, and brought him a cheesecake with a candle for dessert (complementary). \n\nAs for the food, I can say that this was without a doubt the best steak I've ever had. The filet was so tender and cooked perfectly! For some perspective, I've eaten at Ruth's Chris, Del Friscos, and several other high-end steakhouses in addition to working at a very high-end country club. Capital Grille blew all of them out of the water. \n\nI truly can't say enough about our experience. My dad said that it was the best birthday he'd had in a very long time, and attributed it to his experience at Capital Grille.

They are about half the price, but more importantly the quality of the meat is superior. Fresh Market filets are tender, almost buttery (not to mention consistent, we've grilled a good half dozen times with similar results). It's nice to have someone cook for you once in awhile, but really I'd choose quality every time over being served something that's just OK while being overcharged.  My husband enjoyed his lobster bisque and the lobster mac and cheese had several large chunks of lobster that were tender and perfect. My tomato salad came with underripe overly thick slices of tomato on top (which generally made the whole thing look unnappetizing). I'd say it's a reasonable request that if a tomato salad is offered you'd better have ripe tomato, otherwise perhaps not bother offering as a menu item. Under the thick slices there were some very tasty red, gold, and chocolate colored grape tomatoes that had marinated in the balsamic nicely- those were really good and I did enjoy that part. Overall the reason we went to Capital Grille in the first place was to enjoy some steak, they fell squarely in the category of mediocre. There are better places for the price point, we won't be going back unless my husband has a craving for the lobster mac and cheese . . .", "business_id": "CChwRoYVXA3QZulS8a6xOQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-02-19", "type": "review"}

I wanted to leave when we were not received for about 10 minutes, but we gave them some time to realize there were customers up front. After someone in the kitchen finally noticed us, we were seated at a table, with no menus... Then, our waiter introduced himself, took away extra silverware, and gave us no menus. We asked... Should we get out own menus? He said he would get us some. He then proceeded to chat with some waiter buddies in plain view. Since the restaurant was almost completely empty, it looked like we were interrupting a break. After several minutes of chit-chat, the waiter finally delivered some menus (how hard is that?). Perusing the menu, it was clear the Palm doesn't believe in meals, which I guess is because meals are... gauche. You can order a steak for $45, but you won't get a salad or a side unless you buy a separate $8 plate of veggies or $8 salad. I just couldn't believe a 9 oz. piece of meat would be worth that much (plus, I'd rather a 6 oz. filet). So, we ordered the Veal and Chicken Parm. (~$35), which do not come with any noodles unless you pay $4 extra (thus bringing the Parms. up to ~$40). I also ordered a coffee, which was just OK, and asked for a bread basket, which was room temperature and less enjoyable than the Mimi's bread basket. On the plus side, the entrees were excellent, and had there been half as much Chicken Parm., a vegetable, and some well-prepared noodles or potatoes, I wouldn't have felt so ripped off. As is, two chicken breasts was way too much chicken and too little fine dining. In addition, the lighting in the restaurant was not very romantic/intimate, and there was a noticeable lack of ambiance. We managed to escape from the restaurant for $110 total (no salads, no desserts, no alcohol), for a meal that was less enjoyable than many $60 meals ($30 per person) we've enjoyed at other restaurants (with at least 1 salad, 1 dessert, and 1 glass of wine). If someone else had been paying the bill, I had ordered the lacking sides, and I had never seen the price, I may have had a better experience, but the service and ambiance still were nothing to write home about.

There are just too many other choices out there for this kind of money and even less.  Not quite sure what the target market is for this place.  Pricing, menu, and wait staff lean toward fine dining, but the place has the look and feel of theme joint.  We sat in a room with 6 tables, no less than 4 wait staff attending.  Five tables were dressed and well-mannered and one table, parents with what could have been twin girls late 20's early 30's, definitely sisters sitting with dad in a t-shirt, all loud, and I'm fairly certain, all drunk.  None of the staff said a word to these people even after the table behind us dropped a subtle hint to the waiter. \n\nSure, the food is better than most restaurants per-se, but for that amount of dinner bill, comparatively it isn't good at all.  I can name five places off the top of my head that are 3 times the food and 10 times the dining experience for the same or less.  \n\nI went specifically for the swordfish which l read on the trip advisor menu but wasn't on the actual menu.  No bother to update that menu to reflect current menu omissions.  I am however contributory to that since a little more research on my account would have turned up the online menu from their site which is up to date.  \n\nI settled for the veal martini which was fairly flavorful but over kill on the basil.  The veal was tough also.  My daughter had the filet.  She was struggling cutting it in which our waiter literally came over and cut it for her and he struggled a bit himself.   It was daughter's night out so I just let it go with a soft smile.   I'm not a filet person, but it is the only cut my wife and younger son order.   We were at Sullivan's and she just about cut her filet with her fork.  Capital Grille two weeks ago, my son, same thing.  \n\nI gave it a poor rating based on the demographics of the market.

We rarely eat at hibachi grills, but decided it sounded good tonight. The food was okay. Life's too short and there are way too many good things to eat to settle for okay!\n\nI think one thing that makes it tricky when reviewing a hibachi experience is that they all basically have the same menu - right down to the salad dressing!  Therefore, comparisons are natural. \n\nI found the soup salty. The salad dressing was okay, but missing something. Rice was good, noodles had a nice garlic flavor and veggies were standard. I ordered the teriyaki steak and it had zero teriyaki flavor. Had the sauce not been visible I would have sworn I got the wrong item. The meat itself did not taste good. It wasn't spoiled tasting, more like a really cheap cut of meat. I only ate about three bites.  In another environment I would have gone so far as to complain, but not here.  The shrimp were good. Maybe most disappointing was the ubitiqous white shrimp sauce. It was very watery and bland:(. Major disappointment as that stuff is the highlight of a hibachi visit!  In sum, the food was filling, but not good enough to come here again.  \n\nThe positives are that the staff were friendly and worked quickly.

Armed with this knowledge I was bracing myself for an... interesting experience. Hibachi is generally standard across the board for me. It's not a hit or miss type of cuisine. In terms of the actual hibachi, everyone does the same exact thing with some minor twists here and there, so it's all about the quality of ingredients and service. Lets just say I held my toungue when asked how I liked my meal at the end of the day.\n\nThe Service:\n- A little slow honestly, it took them forever to get my beer (not cool bro) and even longer to come get my order. Friendly people as per the usual, but for some reason they are on asian standard time when it comes to serving you.\n\nThe Food:\n- Standard hibachi food, solid but nothing special. A big plus for me are the portions. They tend to give you larger portions than other restaurants along with the traditional soup, salad, shrimp, and veggies. In fact, this is the only place I've seen that gives you noodles with your dish at no extra cost. Well played Nakato. \n\nThe Ambiance\n- Gotta love the ambiance. My cook was playful and had fun with the kids (which is a must, they love attention). The decor was great, modern with a little rustic feel to make you ease into your surroundings. \n\nOverall, wouldn't jump the gun saying its the best hibachi I've ever had, but I also won't be coming here regularly.", "business_id": "xLZilmaLXY0r-dBFaiLxww", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-12-03", "type": "review"}

I didn't think the staff would be amenable to giving me an updated set of eggs, and I figured the rest of my food would get cold in the process, so I went with it, and my soft drink went empty in the process.\n\nIt's definitely possible that I hit them on a bad day, but I'd much rather brave traffic to get across the street to Sugar's - or even across the bridge to McDonald's or Wendy's (if they start serving breakfast) than go through that again.", "business_id": "-f5xy4PY0DV-9FyIM6-M6A", "stars": 1, "date": "2008-12-10", "type": "review"}

Their STEAK and SERVICE are just flat-out better in my mind than Outback.  I am not an Outback hater or anything, its just than when I tell people about Longhorn, the response I usually get is, \"Why don't you just go to Outback??\"  Well here's what keep's me coming back to Longhorn instead...\n\n*Steaks are always juicy, tender and cooked to perfection.  I've never had a bad or less than satisfactory steak at Longhorn.  I usually order the 7oz. Flo's Filet.  Don't worry, 7oz. of quality steak is more than what you think, and is more than enough for most people (see pics).  \n\n*I love the Crab and Lobster dip (see pics).  I order this almost every time I go here.  I don't know if the crab and lobster are imitation or not, and to be honest, I really don't care.  All I know, is that it is a stellar appetizer and puts the overrated Blooming onion to shame as far as appetizers go.\n\n*I love the mash-potatoes.  I just wish they would cut back on the butter a little bit.  I mean we all love butter, but no one's trying to sacrifice their life for it.  I recommend asking for lite butter on the mash-potatoes if you choose to order them as a side to go with your entree.\n\n*I love the brown bread that they serve before the meal.  It's good, but it's better when its warm and fresh, and I've had some non-fresh bread before.  I can't say that the bread is consistently better than Outback's.\n\n*The service is always top-notch.  Everyone from the hostess, to the manger to the servers are extremely friendly and polite.  Drinks are always promptly refilled and orders are always correct.  \n\n*They do serve a few select beers on draft such as Bud Light and Blue Moon, but beware, they aren't cheap and can turn a reasonably priced dinner into an expensive one very quickly.  In recent visits, I have tried to stay away from the alcoholic beverages while there.  \n\nThere's nothing NOT to like about Longhorn.

We headed off down Harris Boulevard in search of something else to satisfy a desire for steak. Since I-85 is such a hassle with rush-hour traffic and now all that construction, we decided not to endure more of that and not trek further for a Texas Roadhouse steak. Passing the highway on-ramp, we remembered Longhorn's existed. I used to live in the area and had been a there a few times before, years and years ago.\n\nWe both ordered steaks, my friend the NY Strip and I -- my preferred cut -- the ribeye. We got our drinks and bread the same time as the side salads. My tea was a bit bitter, the side salad was decent but bland. I prefer other place's blue cheese dressing to Longhorn's. This place's was a bit watered down.\n\nThe steak and potato arrived after we finished the salads. My friend enjoyed his, and I thought mine was fine. It was a bit tough and chewy, but not enough to send back. I finished it all and was fairly satisfied and definitely full.\n\nEveryone has their preferences, and for about the same price, I prefer Texas Roadhouse. They are more tender and juicy in my opinion, as well as thicker and more marbled. I like their tea much better (less bitter and more sweet) and their side salads (dressing there is thicker with less iceberg lettuce). They serve rolls instead of sliced bread, which i also prefer. So, I guess maybe is all down to preference, and I prefer Texas Roadhouse.\n\nAs for the service, that was a-okay. No problems there, minus the urge to up-sell, which I find quite annoying, but I accept it is a part of eating out. Our server was quick on the refills and checked in to make sure the meals was (as she put it), \"okay.\"\n\nAs the star rating and the server said, it was all \"okay.\" Not a place I would return to unless it was someone else's idea and they had the desire for it. Also, my friend paid, so it's tough to beat that.", "business_id": "i3HfmM-evIOLpJ2wuTZVKA", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-02-25", "type": "review"}

Great food and great service at prices you can't beat. No wonder the Old Mallard Creek LongHorn Steakhouse is currently no. 2 in customer satisfaction in the country. And I wouldn't be surprised if they take the top spot by the end of this month to be the best in 2014!\n\nLet me start off by saying that there are people who say you have to wait long but no, we just walked right in on a Saturday night even though the place looked packed. They took me and my wife to a nice, comfy booth in the back where I like it, and it looked like it was just cleaned, which means the staff are quite diligent.\n\nThen we met Tim, who helped us out that night. He was awesome! He was quick, smooth, knowledgeable, friendly in a non-creepy-guy way, all throughout the night. He knew when to come to us exactly when we wanted him to, and he took our orders like a pro. By that I mean filling in the gaps like when I said Ribeye, he asked the Outlaw Ribeye. And when I said no, I'm not that hungry tonight, he backed off immediately and said yeah, you need an empty stomach for that. I don't like people who push it with comments like 'you sure?', 'come on buddy!' I want to eat what I want to eat. And I did have the Outlaw Ribeye last time so I wanted to try the regular.\n\nLet me tell you, the price is right! We ordered the Sampler, a Ribeye and a Renegade Sirloin that both came with a side and a salad, and a OMB Southend. All that cost us a little over fifty! You know LongHorn is in the same family as Capital Grille. I say the steak is just as good and the price is half! How about that.\n\nNow the last thing I want to mention is the excellence of the entire staff. The manager who stopped by was friendly, the receptionist, the kitchen staff was obvious good at what they do, and Tim F. were all super. He even got us a desert to make our experience more awesome. So that was our Saturday night dinner that made up for a bad Thanksgiving lunch at Nan & Byron's.

I ordered the Outlaw Ribeye, rare, and it wasn't my favorite steak.  It was cooked rare, but it was full if sinews.  This steak had more sinews than the ones you get from Food Lion.  I am thoroughly disappointed because this is a steakhouse - paying $25 for 18oz ($18.80/lbs) should guarantee you get a great steak, or at the very last a fair quality steak.  My wife had the prime rib, she enjoyed it despite the overabundance of pepper.  She puts A1 sauce on steak, and being a steak snob I don't weight her opinions as heavily.  I really wanted to like this steak but now I just really want my money back (along with my time and a chance to do this all over again somewhere else).  The Outlaw Ribeye should be outlawed if they keep serving  up so much sinew.  The sinew so dominated my review that the lack of marbling (flecks of fat) and abundance of large globs of fat (large gobs don't count as marbling) were secondary.  I am able to chew and eat fat with some meat, but I had to spit out so many bites of steak because I couldn't even chew them.

I received a personal call and an apology.  On top of that Chris invited me to give the restaurant a second try, compliments of him.\n\nI decided that after writing such a harsh, but accurate, review I should give Longhorn Steakhouse another try.  I went there and it was night and day.\n\nI ordered the same steak again: the Outlaw Ribeye.  This time I was more conservative and went medium rare instead of rare - I love rare steak but un-melted beef fat coats the mouth and isn't toothsome.   It was delicious.  Marbling was great, there was almost no connective tissue, and what little there was happened to be so slight you could eat it without considerable trouble.  The bone was much smaller - and there were very few chunks of fat (as opposed to marbled) on this steak.  I took pictures!\n\nMy wife ordered the ribeye.  She thought it was fine but a bit thin, one bite of my Outlaw Ribeye and she was jealous.  After I initially wrote this review I called the manager and he said you can request a thicker steak and you will be accommodated.  For $5 more I can't recommend you go directly to the Outlaw Ribeye - it is thicker and bigger, even though there is a bone there is 18oz vs 11oz.  I have a picture with a fork in front of each of the steaks to try and give you perspective on the relative thickness.\n\nThere are some cons to the evening: our appetizer (shrimp and lobster dip) arrived before out complimentary bread (the bread arrived with our entrees).  We were half-done eating it when our salads arrived.  We had just gotten to our salads after finishing off the appetizer (ran out of chips before dip) when our steaks arrived.  I like fast service but our courses came out too close together, but not so close together as to have all three courses out at once.\n\nI ordered the mashed potatoes and asked if I could get those loaded.  I received the standard mashed potatoes, when I got the attention of our waitress she quickly brought out more mashed potatoes on a separate plate and these were loaded.  There is no additional charge to get your mashed potatoes loaded, and we were allowed to keep both sets of mashed potatoes.  Ordering the potatoes this way was the recommendation of our waitress: I always like it when waitstaff know the food on the menu from experience.\n\nThese were only minor inconveniences.

This is my humble opinion.  I do a thought experiment whenever I get appetizers or dessert: would I come to this place and order only this appetizer or only this dessert?  Would I get an entree somewhere else and stop off here to pickup dessert?  If the answer is no, and it usually is, then they aren't worth ordering.\n\nThe entrees are what bring me to many restaurants and I think that is how they get you in the door.  Outback really pushes the blooming onion as a draw, which is sad, a steakhouse isn't an onion house, the steak should be the draw and not the onions.\n\nLongHorn has achieved this - the steak is the draw.  Come here and eat steak.  I can't review any other entrees that aren't steak because I don't think about coming to LongHorn when I am not eating steak.  That isn't anything against LongHorn - when I got to a steakhouse it is 100% because I am in the mood for steak.  I am normal that way.  I don't go to Bonefish grill and order steak - I order fish (although not bonefish).\n\nLoaded mashed potatoes are what I skirt my steak with.  I recommend them - but ask them to ixna the melted butter.

Skip the buffet fish - definitely subpar.  Perhaps \"menu\" options are better?  \n\nDetailed review: Went here for Friday night fish fry, as we'd heard their cod and haddock were some of the best around.  \n\nWandered in to the bar area, which is actually quite nice and very large.  Found two seats at the bar, ordered a Rocky's Revenge (on tap) and a Whiskey Old Fashioned Sour.  The bartender seemed confused by the old fashioned request - she didn't know if she should muddle it with oranges or cherries or both... we coached her and she got it done, but I'm sad to report the Old Fashioned was average at best.\n\nThe bar features bowls of free snacks - Gardetto's and freshly popped corn.  Drink prices were reasonable, and the other folks sitting around us were friendly and personable.\n\nOur table became ready at around 6pm, and after browsing the menu options we decided to go with the buffet.  In hindsight, this was probably a mistake.\n\nThe buffet features broasted chicken, two types of baked haddock (seasoned/buttered and plain), deep fried cod, several casseroles, some veggies, and several potato options (baked, broasted, or steak fries).

I really appreciated this - it showed to me that they care about what people are saying and trying to improve. \n\nSo we went to Fitzgerald's again last Sunday for dinner. Upon entering we noticed some changes. Looks like the remodeled some and I liked the changes. Some things were still a bit old, so maybe this is still in progress (but heading in the right direction). \n\nWe were greeted right away and sat at a nice table away from the door. Our waitress was excellent, very nice and did a great job. 4 or 5 stars for service which is always good. \n\nOur group ordered steak and ribs for dinner. I got a Filet Mignon - the petite size for $24.99. It was good and cooked properly. Came with a cup of Au Jus for some reason which I'm not used to getting with a filet. (and later spilt everywhere). To be honest the steak was a bit small for the price. It did come with salad bar and a side, both of which were quite good. My wife got a Ribeye (I think) and she wasn't as happy. Better size for the price, but she said it was kind of tough. My mom got the ribs and although a bit lathered in sauce for me, she loved it. \n\nI did enjoy the salad bar, for a day that was probably not so busy - it was well kept and everything seemed very fresh. The waitress also brought out a loaf of hot fresh baked (or at least warmed) bread. Call me old fashioned, but I loved this. Very good bread and a nice touch to a meal. \n\nOverall, everything was decent even if the portions were a bit small for the price. I was wavering between 3 and 4 stars because the server did such an excellent job.

What about garbanzo beans or sprouts or candied walnuts or jicama or edamame or anything remotely interesting?

While I cooked my steak I enjoyed the salad bar. It was fairly small in terms of length, but they packed a lot of goodies onto it, including real bacon crumbles and many other special toppings. Fries were thin in one direction and broad in another. They were clearly cut from whole potatoes and were fried perfectly for crunchy skins, crispy fries, and moist interiors.\n\nThe bar tender, Hali, was patient with me, explaining how the place works, attentive to my needs (bringing the french fries at the right moment, making sure my drink was in good condition, and that I had everything I was supposed to have), and pleasant.\n\nIts sad there aren't many places like this anymore. Its great that there is Alexander's.", "business_id": "562AuYjOuZwtTbS1UYhY6Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-02-07", "type": "review"}

And I'm not even a fan of chicken fried steak but I know a good one when I eat one and it's definitely a true test of a \"Texas\" style restaurant. So I order the chicken fried steak. It was very good, just what you would find at your favorite down home restaurant anywhere in Texas. It came with what they call steak fries, but they were really just big cubes of potatoes. I thought they were kinda weird and bland. You get a large portion of food, very large actually. But it seemed a bit steep, maybe I'm just cheap. Either way, I did enjoy a bottle of Shiner and the place was decent and novel enough that I will go back, if for no other reason than to sit at the bar and have a beverage.

We got the LAST piece of prime rib (it's limited every day, apparently).\n\nThe smoked prime rib was a bit fatty, but the flavor was very good.  The chicken-fried steak seemed to be a lot more breading than steak.  Believe it or not Denny's has a better breading/steak ratio.  The breading itself didn't seem to have any flavor or seasoning to it.  Usually I go very light on the cream sauce when I order a chicken-fried steak, but here you need to go heavier to give it more flavor.  Now to be fair it was really good when I did that, but I think that was much more the sauce than the steak.  Which just seems wrong to me.  The sauce should enhance the flavor, not embody all the flavor.  That's why I can't bring myself to go to four stars.  I could have put the sauce on a piece of bread and probably gotten about the same flavor experience.\n\nPortions were pretty generous, and the sides were basic but good.", "business_id": "18TUn9oiW0k0yB6lheiOvw", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-12-04", "type": "review"}

Two out of our party of three ordered that right up. The third was an order of chicken fingers from the kids menu.  The kids menu has a nice selection of choices that are sure to please even the pickiest of palattes (prime rib!), and the chicken fingers were really delicious - tender, juicy and seasoned well.

Anyone who knows anything about chicken fried steak knows there is an art to the fork tender meat and that perfect crust-to-meat ratio.  Well, they nailed it.  Each bite of the \"skin-on little bit lumpy like your momma would make\" mashed potatoes was a heavenly little vehicle for their yummy country gravy.  The corn was corn.  Even the corn knows it's not the star of this dish, so it's there for support.  Biscuits were hot and tasty.

I was really looking forward to lunch here.  Parking at this location is beyond ridiculous, no, I didn't valet cause I wanted to shop after wards.  But who cares?  I was here for a great meal!  Things started off well, great folks at the hostess desk.  Attractive interior, beautiful dark rich woods, attractive lighting, dark plantation blinds, very nice table.  My server Paula was extremely nice and had the cutest accent.  I liked a lot of the choices on the menu, but on an impulse, decided on the salad with filet medallions and onions straws.  The first bite of steak was extraordinary, perfectly cooked, wonderful seasonings and flavor.  Fresh pieces of asparagus in the salad was a nice surprise.  Then the shocker.  The next medallion was under cooked, the next was over cooked and the rest were grisley.  Needless to say, I could not eat it.  My server was very apologetic.  And then the manager immediately appeared as if he had been shot out of a canon.  He apologized profusely.  I was very understanding, I mean everyone has a bad day, right?   And of course he offered another dish, but I declined.  I mean, the mood was gone.  But then again, this is why I don't eat at home. The salad was taken off my check, as should be expected.  I did have dessert, hell yes, I was still hungry!  I got the hazelnut chocolate cake, which was totally awesome and even pretty to look at.  It was big enough to feed an army, don't know if it was a regular slice or if they were trying to make up for the salad.  So, a really mixed review.  I will try Capital Grill, again.  And I hope to have much better results.", "business_id": "QdbZyl-LWFS54u93Vjd5SA", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-01-13", "type": "review"}

But while going through a pile of mail I had set aside as junk, I found a $50 off postcard from AM-EX to Capital Grille. We decided to give it a try and save Mastro's for another time.\n\nThe service was fantastic. Our waiter, Reuben, was just the right amount of attentive (I hate being asked after practically every bite if everything is ok), and the other staff was also excellent.\n\nWe got a basket of bread to start, which also held some matzo-like crackers. Don't pass by the dark bread- I thought it was regular pumpernickel at first, but it had a wonderful crust with a soft and slightly fruity center- totally unexpected and delicious. We also received an amuse- a great little bruchetta topped with micro greens.\n\nI ordered the caprese salad which was good, especially the yellow tomato slice, but I have had better mozzarella at Cibo. Hubby had the French Onion soup which came with a ridiculous amount of torch-melted cheese on top. The soup itself had great flavor (one of the best I've had), but could have been a little hotter for my taste. Hubby liked it the way it was.\n\nFor our entrees, Hubby got the Kona crusted sirloin (which was rubbed with a blend of decaf coffee powder, cocoa, and cinnamon) with shallot butter. He really enjoyed the flavor, although about half of his steak was really much more medium than medium rare. To me, the flavor was unexpected- I thought I would taste any one of the rub flavors before I tasted the steak, as they are all strong flavors. That was not the case, however- it was a subtle yet complex addition to the beef. I had the classic Delmonico rib-eye. Mine was perfectly done and quite tasty, although I must say that I have enjoyed my rib-eye at Bobby Q's every bit as much. The sides were fine- we tried the mushroom mix and the lobster mac n' cheese. We have been spoiled by our CraftSteak hen-of-the-woods mushroom ecstasy experience, so all else pales in comparison. I expected more from the mac- it was sort of mild and bland. I'm not sure what it needed- something that wouldn't overwhelm the lobster, but something nonetheless. Because we wanted to try a dessert, we took home plenty of food (the sides are large, and all share-able by 2-4 people).\n\nWe shared the coconut cream pie, which again was more than enough for two. It was in a tart style with a sugar cookie type crust, topped with a layer that we felt had cream cheese in it, then a layer of custard cream, covered by a mountain of fresh whipped barely sweetened cream and toasted coconut flakes. It was really delicious. The house blend coffee was truly outstanding, without even a hint of acidity. Hubby added Frangelico to his, and it was so good and rich that it did not need the cream he would have otherwise added. \n\nAll in all, Capital Grille gave us a very pleasant dining experience (aside from a couple of wasted chicks who were way too loud), and very good food.", "business_id": "QdbZyl-LWFS54u93Vjd5SA", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-01-19", "type": "review"}

It's my favorite spot for a great steak and large selection of wines. I judge a steakhouse by trying the Rib-Eye. Capital Grill only serves \"Prime\" and yes, you do pay the price. This is not a \"cheap date\", and has become one of special occasion spots...anniversary, birthday etc. \n\nThe Rib-Eye here has the perfect marbleization and has always been cooked to perfection. Sandra K usually has the Filet, and has never been disappointed.\n\nBut I better mention the Lobster Bisque soup before detailing the steaks and sides. It is like a special sunset. Dazzling light, luminescent colors and a special moment. Not sure how's it's made...but to die for flavor.\nSalads are exceptional, except I usually go for the soup, but when I'm thinking healthy, I have the wedge or Caesar, or on occasion the bacon spinach. All worth mentioning.\n\nBack to the steaks, again, I am a Rib-Eye fan but I have had The Dry Aged Steak Au Poivre with a Courvasier Cream Sauce. This steak is rubbed with crushed peppercorns and \"seared\" to lock in the juices. The cream sauce is such a delight. Don't mix the Lobster Bisque and this steak unless you want a decadent evening. \n\nBy the way, don't lke beef? Try the Double Cut Lambchops...fabulous! Seafood, I can't get myself to order seafood at a Steak House, unless I have Steak and Lobster/Crab. Then again, I get my Lobster fix with the soup or the appetizers.\n\nSides....This is why I like to take a group here. The sides are all \"shareable\" although there are several here that I don't want my companions to take too much. Parmesan Truffle Fries....ouch on the flavor scale (and other scales). Lobster and Mac N Cheese, again, I get my seafood on the side, this one is decadent to the power of 10 and one of my all time favorites are the AuGratin potatoes. To impress my guests, I will order a vegetable to share and it's usually the creamed spinach or asparagus. But sliding into decadence here means I throw out the rules of engagement and if I going to sin....here I am going to sin big, and that means dessert as well.\n\nCoconut Cream Pie or Key Lime Pie at a fine dining spot contrast the other offerings of Flourless Chocolate Expresso Cake and Berries and Cream. Go for it.\n\nI have had intimate dining here with Sandra K and most recently, hosted a luncheon for 60 persons in a private setting.

I cannot even begin to tell you!! ARGH!

What ever homesick girl needs to feel better. :)\n\nWe entered the very clean and classy and dare i say it - swanky setting with their hostesses who ware blazers and they were very welcoming and were very glad to seat a yelper. (they asked how I heard about Resturant Week when I called for reservations) Our waiter - dang I can't remember his name! he was so attentative and had one of those table sweeper type thingies and he recommended I try the best drink of the night - the Stoli Doli. Fresh pineapple stewed with Stoli vodka for atleast a WEEK before it's dispensed for sweet drink lovers (like me) smooth, delicious and slightly sweet. I was in love. \n\nWe had standard salads, nothing to write yelp about. I had the Filet Mingon and she had this steak that was sliced in half (if I remember) it came with veggies, again nothing to really write yelp about but everything was so yummy. The steak was well rested and cooked perfectly. I was very impressed.  \n\nOne slight issue: we saw creme brulee on the menu on  the resturant week's website but when we got to the resturant, it wasn't there - boo... but our ever amazing waiter worked it out for us! YAY!! Thank Goodness he did because it was insanely good.\n\nIf you want a place that is swank, seriously fancy (I'm from the rez okay - so this is crazy fancy in my world)  and has GREAT service and even better steak... this is the place for you! But you better have the cash to pay for it all! lol but if you have the money honey and a need to wine and dine then trust me sweetie Capital Grille has the time!

So the fact that I ended up at Capital Grille for Valentine's day is actually a little embarrassing. But the combination of a $100 gift card that was about to expire, a fond memory of steak tar tar and homemade potato chips at their bar, and a failure to make any other sort of reservation landed us there at about 8pm on Sunday night. I really wasn't feeling like anything fancy, so we decided to sit at the bar, nosh, and watch the Olympics.\n\nFirst, cocktails. Mine: an expertly made Manhattan that was approximately the size of my head (hurray for oversized martini glasses!) My husbands: Hendricks, rocks, cucumber. Our bartender offered to go get cucumber slices from the kitchen as it was a garnish they typically had at the bar. Score 1 for Kevin the bartender. \n\nNext, food order. This had the potential to be the low point of the evening when they informed me they no longer had the steak tar tar on the menu. Or the ketlle chips. I now wanted to cry. We settled for a caprese salad, beef carpaccio, and the lobster crab cakes. Salad came out promptly, was very tasty and nice presentation. And then...nothing. The other apps lagged for like 15 minutes and the bartender was visibly irritated at the kitchen and wait staff. Luckily I had a full drink in front of me and it was the skating pairs short program on TV so I really wasn't complaining. When the food did show up it was actually worth the wait. Nothing I would have changed about it at all.\n\nFor the dessert portion of the evening we decided to try a Colheita port, which the bartender described as a single vintage tawny port. My husband loves tawny port and they had one that was fairly reasonable but still in the Colheita category. Rounded it out with the flourless chocolate espresso cake. Sadly, we were informed they no longer carried our port selection. And then, not so sadly, they poured us a much more expensive version for the price of the other one! Oh, and the dessert itself - freaking amazing. Best chocolate torte I've had in a while. \n\nThe actual shocker of the evening was that they took the appetizers off the bill without us saying anything about it. This really wasn't necessary but I think it shows that this place really does have class and that they wanted us to know that wasn't up to their standard of service. Well played.\n\nOh, and, right before we left the bartender leaned over and said \"Come back on a day when it isn't a holiday and we'll get the kitchen to make you some steak tar tar.  They do it for me all the time.\" Bless you, sweet bartender man. And thank you for a lovely Valentine's day.", "business_id": "QdbZyl-LWFS54u93Vjd5SA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-02-15", "type": "review"}

Had a 5:00 reservation.  Arrived about 10 minutes early and we were greeted by young hostesses with heavy make-up and just okay.

Ordered martinis straight up, with GREAT blue cheese olives.  Good service at bar.  Got served some cold bread in a basket.  Nice variety.  But cold!  We sat there for over 20 minutes though.  Wished to be seated at table on time.\n\nTable was nice.  Servers and bussers do shuffle around and don't seem happy.  Our server was fine.  We dine at Ruth's a lot so we were happy to try a bone-in rib-eye here.  We were told that we'd find the steaks at PCG better.  Didn't turn out that way and not just because of overdone. \n\nAnother bread basket but this time it was hot.  Love the pretzle bread with big salt crystals.  \n\nInteresting that we didn't even open the menu.  What the server sugggested was what my hus. decided sounded great.  I agreed.  Nice red wine.  Lobster bisque came out pretty fast.  It was tepid.  Yuck!  Flavor was nice, lobster morsles good.  Temperature - awful!  The giant crouton it came with (same kind as bread basket) made it better.  Not enough flavor.  Just seemed to be creamy for creamy's sake.  Just a bowl of heavy cream.\n\nHeirloom tomato salad was good but the dressing was just alright.  Nice variety of tomatoes.  Was hoping for more pizazz.  \n\nPotato Au Gratin were heavily salted.  Sliced thinkly, good texture, but I like the simplicity of Ruth's potatoes better.  They were very tasty, but maybe just a little too salty.  I like to salt my own.  Neat, but not necessay to have an extra server scoop out a serving of potatoes.  No personality when doing it.  \n\nOur steaks were ordered meduim-rare.  They came out meduim.  The server asked, noticed, took out flashlight and agreed that they were both overdone.  My hus. kept his.  Hungry is his name (not really).  My new one came out pretty fast.  With my new one, came manager.  Man, was he stuffy!  He had his flashlight too and said for me to cut into it so that HE could be sure that I'd be happy with this one.  Well, it was rare, but I, too was hungry so I kept it.  I was happy to warm it up later in the broiler and then it'd be perfect.  \n\nThe meat itself was great.  Not salted or peppered at all.  Not much butter.  I love Ruth's WAY better.  I like the butter, salt and sizzle.\n\nServer comped steaks and gave us desset to go.  Overall, all our needs met.  Happy time!  Just prob. won't go back for steaks.

Last minute anniversary idea totally worked in our favor, as we were greeted with a \"Happy anniversary!\", and led to a seemingly huge booth decorated with rose petals & cheap plastic heart pieces, which was a nice touch. \n\nThe drink selection consisted of standards like martini's and a massive wine list. We went for the basic. Dry gin martini, 3 olives. They pulled it off wonderfully, and it was shaken/poured tableside, as it should be.\n\nWe started with the calamari. They fry them up in a bready, salty batter. Almost too salty. Then, they do something awesome, and toss in chopped cherry peppers. The result is this concoction of spicy bready perfectly fried calamari. The peppers add this crazy flavor to the overall dish, which is completely unexpected and delicious. Great ratio of head vs body too. I hate it when restaurants just give me heads. I'm not afraid of tentacles! \n\nI had the sliced filet migon with cippolini onions and wild mushrooms, finished with a 12 year balsamiq reduction. Perfect crust on the steak. The saltyness of the crust brought out the juices of the meat, when combined with the reduction, resulted in a fantastic melt-in-the mouth feel.  That being said, I wish it was a little more rare.\n\nShe had the special, which was a lamb roulade filled with an herb cream cheese and wrapped in bacon. While this proved to be a winning combination of flavors, the lamb was slightly overcooked from medium rare. \n\nWe got the lobster mac and cheese, which had huge chunks of lobster. The cheese was mascarpone, which resulted in a soupier mac, but it worked well with the lobster. We also got the french green beans with heirloom tomatoes, which while tasty, wasn't anything special. \n\nFor dessert, we were brought an espresso chocolate flourless cake, finished with raspberry sauce & fresh raspberries. Rich and delicious.\n\nIn the end, it was a fantastic meal. The Capital Grille is not the best steakhouse I've ever been to though, it is a very close second. I recommend in a heartbeat.\n\nAs a p.s: The service was top notch. I even got a phone call the next day, wanting to know how the experience was. I have never gotten that kind of attention from a restaurant before, and I doubt it will happen again.", "business_id": "QdbZyl-LWFS54u93Vjd5SA", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-02-26", "type": "review"}

The boyfriend and I celebrated Valentine's Day there last weekend and we could not have had a better experience.\n\nWe saw on their website that they are running a special -$99 dinner for two. What an amazing deal. You get salad, steak, seafood, 2 sides and dessert! You cannot beat it.\n\nWe each started with a caesar salad, which was huge! It was very good - not too heavy on the dressing. But I didn't want to eat too much because I knew we had so much more coming.\nThe deal comes with a half filet mignon for each person which is still a good size portion and your choice of seafood on the side. I ordered the bacon wrapped scallops and boyfriend ordered the shrimp. Each came in an order of three so we shared. The steak was done just right, it was so tender and tasty. And the seafood was amazing. The shrimp was in this buttery sauce that I just loved. It was almost better than the steak. \nFor our sides we chose potatoes lyonaisse (sp?) and sauteed mushrooms. The potatoes were tasty and the mushrooms were a great compliment to the steak - a really nice combo.\nFor dessert we each got a piece of their chocolate lava cake with a scoop of ice cream - very rich and very good. The cake was moist and the ice cream helped cut the richness of the fudge.\n\nI think some of the servings may have been smaller (like if you ordered the shrimp as an appetizer I think you get more than 3) but it was still more food than we could finish. We took a good portion of it all home and ate it as part of a meal the next day.\n\nThe service was excellent, and the atmosphere pleasant.  The only thing I didn't think was up to par was the bread. It's a big loaf of onion bread that was a little hard to cut and it just wasn't that great. Rolls would be better but hey, you don't want to fill up on bread anyway right?

Shirley Temples are so nice.  \n\nI've always had excellent service at the Camelback location.

We expect that when we go.  I think it is VERY much worth it though.  They have the right to serve ala carte.  The prices aren't outrageous.  The food is very, very good.  The sides are the perfect size.  \n\nI also like the way they wrap the leftovers to go in nice boxes and bags.   \n\nTo comment on a few of the other postings here...the servers tell you the plate is sizzling hot.  They even ask you to raise your napkin over your chest as they set it down.  The guy who burned his hand should have been warned.  Sorry if he wasn't.  And the butter is what makes it so special and wonderful.  The servers tell you that it comes with the butter.  It is not swimming.  They put a little pad on the top at the last moment and that hot plate keeps your steak hot.  As for people who have had bad service and wrong steaks, that is not the norm.  \n\nI have never had a better rib eye.  We try to do it like Ruth's at home, but it's never quite the same.

I could have received better service at Applebee's if you ask me,.

This trip the only thing satisfying was the food. Joann had the nerve to let dishes pile up on table,( had a stack of dishes on table she walked past 2 times without removing dishes, when asked to remove them she only moved a few) had to ask several times for refills on soda, bread ( usually waiters sweep in without being asked to refill those items), every time we asked for something she would say OK and rush off without waiting to see if anyone else at table needed anything. \n Manager came and asked if everything was OK, we of course said no, Joann comes back after our talk with Manager and says she will give my Mother in law a free glass of wine, fills bad that everyone had refills on pop and she was drinking wine with no refills (WTH).\n The food was outstanding as usual i had seafood trio (scallops,lobster tails, shrimp), our moms did the stuffed chicken( blew me away stuffing inside  chicken is to die for, and enough for two people to eat), and hubby had lamb( to gamey but for people who like gamey food i suppose its a win mother in law enjoyed it).\n\nI will never come back the location in the Biltmore area ever again, But Ruth Chris in Scottsdale area has wonderfull service, atmosphere, and food , worth every penny.", "business_id": "iDoigI3605ixHl_qHly3Tg", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-01-08", "type": "review"}

I took the wife there for dinner because I received a 25 dollar gift card from my employer....so I decided what the heck. There are so many great restaurants located within walking distance of where we live that we have not visited....well now I can take this one off of my list. We went for an early dinner around 5:30pm or so and Tiffany....who was just simply wonderful....was our hostess. If your ever visit this establishment don't hesitate to ask for her....she is very knowledgeable and so very friendly and attentive to all of your needs.\n\nSo I was pretty hungry and since I have not been to the Outback in years I didn't know what I really wanted. Back in the day I would have ordered the steak with the blooming onion....but since I don't eat red meat now steak was out of the question. Right now they are featuring a Red White and Bloomin menu and 5% of the proceeds go to the soldiers overseas....so I had to order something off of this menu to support them. I had the Chicken and avocado Flatbread which was simply delicious and can be quite filling enough if you don't have a real appetite. I followed that with some New England Clam chowder which was well seasoned.....and I have to tell you I was shocked they were serving it.....because most restaurants only serve it on Friday's, so the fact they had it on a Saturday...was a pleasant surprise.\n\nI then had the Chicken and swiss  burger....which was ummmm....ummmmm.....ummmmmm....good. I mean that chicken breast was juicy....... smoked..... and fire grilled to perfection people....wohooo!!!!\nI then finished off my meal with a stack of waffles with the strawberries....almond cream....and almond shavings sprinkled on top.....DELICIOUS....and this coming from someone who doesn't like nuts of any kind. \n\nNow let me mention again I ordered only the Flatbread dish and the Waffle desert off of the Red, White, and Bloomin menu....but they do have more on it....and I encourage you all that visit to PLEASE show some love to our soldiers risking, fighting and dying to protect our nation by ordering at least one item off this special menu that by the way has only been out for 3 days now. My experience at this Outback was truly eye opening I will definitely return and I hope all you visit very soon as well.

This would have been an easy 4+ rating but I repeatedly got jabbed in the back by a food server's tray three times so I'm steamed and have downgraded this to two stars.\n\nAfter reading Yelp'ers reviews and talking to my co-workers who were very positive about Stockyards Restaurant, I really had a desire to go.  Thanks to Erica's Yelp review she turned me onto the happy hour and recommended seating at the bar.  I found it easy to find two center bar seats at 5PM on a Friday night.\n\nBartender Tom was great; touted the Happy Hour prices, made sure I knew about the Happy Hour snacks and whipped up a mean 'tini ($8).   The Happy Hour sliders were made from a very good grade of Beef.  When it came time for dinner, I stayed at the Bar and had a great meal of The Cattle Baron's 18oz Prime Rib ($36).  Tom also recommended a great Cab by the glass ($5) to go with it.  Prime Rib was done exactly how I like it, medium rare, and well seasoned with salt/pepper.  Along with the meal, starters included a nice Caesar Salad, veggies and bread. I left an 18% tip.\n\nThe problem which reduced this experience to two stars was that I stayed at the Bar to eat.  There were two other food servers in the bar; a lady and a man.  The lady blazed through customers walking to the bathroom with complete disregard, pushing us out of the way.  The male server came to deposit his tables' empties at center of the bar right where we sat, so that we had to stare at dirty glassware.  Each time he did so, he leaned between us and rammed his tray into my back.  I leaned as far forward over the bar that I could but each of the three times he still jabbed his tray in my back.  We were so upset that we abandoned the coupon's for free dessert that we got when signing up on their website.\n\nThis should never happen at any high end restaurant.  \n\nI look forward to returning, having another great meal but being seated in the dining area so I can upgrade this rating.\nSee photos I've attached.", "business_id": "7U8TYNW4Mvx6m3zexsO0sg", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-01-22", "type": "review"}

First of all, the door's are copper, a fact I find amazing due to my new-found love of this material in Arizona. I can't help it, it just always looks perfect out here. \nSo we headed straight back to the bar area, through the dark wood with brass accents, dimly lit area of the restaurant.

A huge, ornate, wood carved saloon style behemoth (that puts Prescott Whiskey Row's The Palace to shame even!). In this magical place, Four Peaks 8th Street Ale was just $3. I will repeat that: Three Dollars. And they offered FREE happy hour snacks, and good ones at that. Sliders with condiments and chips and salsa. \nJust. Wow.

It didn't start off bad, we made reservations and the hostess was friendly. She seated us promptly in a nice comfy booth and we received a breadbasket with crudit\u00e9s to munch on. When our waiter came to take our orders, we informed him we'd be ordering off the Restaurant Week menu and he made this face of dismay and haughty superiority. Apparently Restaurant Week offended our waiter? This is where it went downhill as from here on out, our waiter had an attitude. \n\nAs a first course, we had the option of salad or soup. We asked if we could have Caesar dressing on our salad and at first the waiter looked upset that we'd make such a request and looked ready to refuse but relented and said yes. However we found out later that this was an additional charge that he did not mention to us. (Extra $10, really?) The salad was average, nothing to write home about. \n\nFor our second course, both of us ordered the prime rib with creamed horseradish, which was disappointing. (Again, when placing our order, the waiter seemed really upset - like we were asking him to butcher the cow and then cook us the meal himself.) The prime rib was average thickness, about half an inch and a rather large portion, but the flavor was lackluster. Even the horseradish, which my husband loves, didn't help. \n\nFor dessert, I ordered the chocolate mousse and my husband ordered the cheesecake. I wasn't very impressed with the mousse as it had a citrusy flavor - which was not mentioned on the menu and ruined it for me. (I like my mousse decadent - a deep chocolate flavor. This wasn't.) The cheesecake was good, but my husband would eat any cheesecake.\n\nThen, we waited. And we waited. The waiter had disappeared on us! We waited for a good 20 minutes before we saw him anywhere near our table. My husband had to flag him down and request our bill. Again, the waiter looked like we were asking him to chop down a tree, make both the paper and ink, and then write our receipt in calligraphy. After a few minutes, he came back with our bill and promptly disappeared again. We were shocked to see the extra fee for our salads, as it wasn't explained to us (we would have been fine if it was expressed to us) but unfortunately we couldn't find our waiter. Obviously we couldn't use our credit card (no waiter to process the card) and we had enough cash to pay for the meal plus tip. This is the first time we ever did not want to leave a tip but lucky for this waiter we felt so unwanted that we just dropped our cash and left.\n\nWe won't be back.", "business_id": "7U8TYNW4Mvx6m3zexsO0sg", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-01-08", "type": "review"}

I ordered a half slab of ribs with garlic potatoes and a salad. So- my ribs were just \"okay\" and my potatoes were SUPER SUPER garlic-ey and it was weird how they were plated.  They came out like in a square shaped form of scalloped potatoes.  Like my mom makes potatoes and squares my piece out for me sort of square.  The square was small, but actually I didn't even like the potatoes so that did not bother me too much.  OH! and \"cole-slaw\" my other side I ordered was \"cole-slaw\".

Service was phenomenal - prompt, courteous, just attentive enough without getting overwhelming.  I am still not sure whether the complimentary veggie plate or the awesome cornbread were on our table when we sat down or if they were brought out later but they were already there when I wanted them at just the right temperature.  Now on to the chateaubriand - to me this is their staple as I have not seen this cut in Arizona yet.  This is basically a large cut of tenderloin, too large for one person, hence offered on a large plate cut for two with different veggies, potatoes and mushrooms.  To me this was the best non-Kobe steak I've head in a long time - tender as a filet mignon but with more meat flavor.  My wife and I were barely able to finish it just because of the sheer amount of food - but it was so amazing that we did.

This is a fancy, adult place.  Be sure to turn off your ringtones and use your indoor voice - this place deserves it!\n\nMy only detraction is the decor, which is dated.  I'd love to see the art be rotated out with some local art - photographs and paintings from local artists in the southwestern theme.  It'd be nice to see the art rotate in and out with the seasons perhaps.  Otherwise, there is nothing bad I can say about this place, and that is more a personal preference anyway.  \n\nTL:DR - go here.  Celebrate.  Eat delicious food and enjoy!

In a world full of exotic, overpriced, over the top frilly steakhouses, Stockyard's keeps things the way they should be. Can you go somewhere else and pay more for a steak that may or may not have been blessed by a Japanese Rabbi? Probably. But why would you?\n\nIf you appreciate the old school, high quality steakhouse this is the place. Not the least bit pretentious, walking in you will immediately realize that Stockyard's is a true Arizona experience, and pays homage to it's own wild west heritage throughout the restaurant. \n\nNow, let's not misconstrue this: it's still a damn nice restaurant. What Stockyard's does so well, however, is be true to Arizona in that while the place feels like a special experience, you won't feel out of place whether you are wearing a jacket, your golf outfit or your cowboy boots. \n\nI suppose you aren't reading these reviews to find out if you can wear your boots, so let's talk about the food. I have tried at least 1/2 of the menu, and can't say a single bad thing about it. When they run the baseball cut on special, do NOT pass it up! I am a huge fan of baseball cut steak, and this one is the best there is. I am not a big fan of filet, so if I am going off the regular menu I usually go with the NY or the prime rib if I m feeling like prime rib.\n\nThe best thing about Stockyards hands down is the value for the food and service you receive. It's not cheap, so don't expect to walk out with a $20 steak, but for what they do charge you are getting far more for your money than the other allegedly \"esteemed\" steakhouses in town. Your dinner includes fresh veggies and dip as an appetizer, fresh bread (which is superb), a salad, and a starch of your choice on top of your choice of meat. How many places even offer that anymore? And did I mention that their steaks easily rival the more expensive guys in town? \n\nTo top it off, their wine and drink selection is top notch. Service has always been excellent, and their servers and bartenders extremely knowledgeable and helpful.\n\nIf you are looking to spend some money on a steak, and want the best quality, value and experience for your money, this is the only choice in Phoenix.", "business_id": "7U8TYNW4Mvx6m3zexsO0sg", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-01-09", "type": "review"}

It was just not a time to dine. Today my wife and I decided on an early dinner. Our son had given us a holiday gift of a top-of-the-line steak house. Funny...we were looking for it and passed it right by about 4:10pm. A U-turn and a very slow speed did the trick. However we thought it was out of business. The parking lot was void of cars and not a human was in sight. I decided to call because so many restaurants have closed all over the area. Bingo! They just do happen to open at 5pm. No biggie. We ran an errand and the few moments didn't seem that long. The staff was friendly and the decor was perfect. Our meals were served as ordered. And a great 5stars was awarded because they serve milk....real regular milk for the great coffee after the meal, not the watered down 1%, 2%, skim, fat free stuff. Ugh. The mashed sweet potatoes and the mushroom side were absolutely mouth watering. Be careful of the pecan pie, though. I don't mean taste wise. It was served hellish hot and almost burned my tongue. We always chill our pecan pie. Notwithstanding that hit surprise, it was one of the best we have ever had. We highly recommend the Stockyards. It is a bit overpriced, though.

Hey, I'm coming, let me get my purse (for decoration only tonight). \n\nWell, after we driver to the end of the universe, we finally arrive. There are three in our party, including my crazy BGF co-worker. For those of you in the hotel biz, he's a night auditor, 'nuff said, you get the picture. \n\nOnce we are seated (and the view is spectacular), we peruse the menu (oh, I ix nayed the slide. After seeing a heavy set lady with a dress on slide down and leave her booty juice.... again, nuff said). We looked over the menu and boss lady decides that we should try the fried rattlesnake and the Cowboy Platter. I'm game, remember, she's paying. \n\nFried rattlesnake. What the he!! was I thinking? Must have been that quart sized drink I inhaled (remember, she's paying). Ok, what does it taste like? Popcorn chicken from KFC, over cooked. Again, nuff said. \n\nWe're discussing the merits of Fried rattlesnake (that darn drink again) when we hear a commotion. Running across the restaurant like the kitchen is on fire, come 3 waiters. One has a triangle and is screaming at the top of their lungs. And the other two have this massive metal platter between them, held above their heads. They are all screaming and heading for us. I'm looking like an intoxicated (drink, boss, paying) deer in headlights as my auditory system catches up and sends the signal to my brain. \"COWBOY SPECIAL, COWBOY SPECIAL, COWBOY SPECIAL\" \n\nOh great, now everyone in the restaurant is looking at our eclectic little group. My little Asian boss, dressed in flowers from head to toe with her $350 pumps, my BGF who is about 6\"5, 400# and bald as an egg, and me, the fully intoxicated (Drink, Boss, Free) Korean American in her business suit. \n\nThis platter had like 1/2 a cow, a chicken family and the 3 little pigs on it. I couldn't even begin to do it justice. It should have come with a warning. DO not eat for a week before ordering this special. Needless to say, I had an elephant bag to take with me after dinner (too much for a mere doggie). \n\nOh and the piece de resistance? Why my boss convinced me (Booze. Free. Boss) that the free country line dancing on the patio for everyone to see would be just the thing. WRONG! No rhythm when I'm sober, so you know how this looked. Two left feet when I'm not drinking.

I had never been. Had heard the name many times over the years when I had previously lived in Tempe. \n\nBeen intimidated that by where it set that it was expensive and swanky. That's all a lie! It sets up high and has a wonderful view. It's not located where you are just strolling down the street and decided to pop in that is true. You wind through these grounds to the back of the property pass beautiful fountains and buildings until you come to the lite up restaurant. You can self park but why bother go for the valet. \n\nYou pass a smelly ranch steer at the entry that is probably wondering why the hell its there as much as I was. Inside the door the smell escapes you immediately, thank goodness. You see some young sap making cotton candy and wonder what the heck have I arrived at. A few more steps and you see you are in a western theme establishment, by the overwhelming amount of raw wood beams and flooring. \nFirst stop the bar. It's a limited full bar and for this it losses a star. \nFrom the bar the view outside is great and you can look down and see the country music band playing (it was a band but I wouldn't book 'em) but hey they gave the place a little extra pulse. You see the staff in casual western gear also and you instantly know you're welcome in your jeans. \n\nMoments later our table was ready and half of us choose to take the slide down to the dining floor and the others took the steps. Hey I went for the slide! It was short and fast and another reason to come casually dressed. \n\nOur waitperson was a delightful and articulate young woman. We skipped the appetizers to leave room for dessert (next time I'll reverse that decision). The menu was very good. Several steak cuts, enchiladas, fried chicken, BBQ beef & pork ribs, Seafood, a burger, pork chops, most plates $15 - $20. \n\nWhile waiting for the salad course a magician name Flash comes up and asks if we'd like some magic that night (he works for tips). He went about his tricks and blew our minds! THIS GUY I WOULD HIGHER for an event. Never figured out how he did what he did but would love to see him doing it again and again. So if he comes by your table take him up on his offer of magic. \n\nThe food arrives, the salad is good and fresh the main courses come and all are cooked to perfection. My medium rare T-Bone was actually medium rare for once! My steak was tender and taste fabulous. The food didn't hold it's heat well and they serve sweet potatoes or rice with the dishes rather than standard baked/mashed or fried Idaho's (extra charge for a standard potato - why? - Minus another 1/2 star). But over all it was a good meal. We barely had room for the dessert so we split a 9 layer chocolate fudge cake and another dessert among us. And we still had four or so layers of cake left to go home! It was so rich and such a huge slice no 3 people could have eaten the entire thing following a meal if they tried... 4 of us dug into this slice. \n\nAll in all it its a great steakhouse. Prices lower than Lonestar and Steak portions (ounces) bigger for your money, plus a better all over food and appetizer menu by far. Oh yeah I'm a fan and will be returning again and again when I want a steakhouse to fill my steak cravings and a bit of entertaining to accompany the meal. \n\nI highly recommend Rustlers Rooste.", "business_id": "wZwZcte4lcbu51NOzCjWbQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-12-27", "type": "review"}

We walk up and pass a huge stinky cow or ginormous something in the front. Kids were loving it. We walk up to the hostess stand and there are 3 hostesses and a manager standing there. One of them is blowing her nose into a napkin very loudly the whole time we stand there. Um.....aren't there bathrooms for that? My stomach did tiny somersaults of protest. We sit down and our server just sucked. She completely ruined my experience. The view is freaking amazing,. You can see the whole valley. It could have been my little hidden date gem but even that is not enough to lure me back. The server was rude to both my mother and I. She never told us about the specials, she never asked if I wanted my soft drink refilled, she never asked if I wanted dessert....she just plain sucked. Bland, slow, no personality. Then I had to hear her complain that the manager wouldn't give her Christmas off and how some other guy got it off claiming he was visiting family but his family is here etc................Dude! Take it to the kitchen! \nThe food was good......I had the Fillet, mom - T-Bone. The steaks were cooked perfectly.....the bread was good with the pumpkin butter, not a big fan of the green beans and beans.

I even studied it after the trick and it really was the opposite coin. Crazy!\n\nOur server was Kevin and he was really attentive and down to earth.

I forget which cut my boyfriend got but he did enjoy his as well.  We got green beans and a corn on the cob on the side and we ordered a side of mashed taters which for the 1.79 it cost, was way larger than expected.

Bull, before walking up the ramp to the hostess stand.  Another staple is the slide to get down ground floor, hours (OK, minutes) of fun for children and adults alike.

Tasted like chicken, yet a little chewy like calamari.  The mini fry breads they brought out before the entree were one of my favorite parts of the meal.  The salad came pre-dressed with a ton ranch, but c'mon this is Cowboy food, what do you expect.  I ordered the Mixed Grill with fillet medallions and saut\u00e9ed shrimp.  The portion wasn't huge, but it was enough to fill me up, and it tasted good, so I was happy.\n\nI have also been to the Rooste for happy hour more times than I can count (way before \"check-ins\" were around, so I don't have the stats to prove it).  This is for sure an Arizona classic and will always have a special place in my heart.  From childhood fun, to family gatherings, drunken sliding during happy hour and Yelp events, I've had a blast!\n\nThanks again to Yelp for the $50 gift certificate I won at the Hoe Down and thanks to the Rooste for providing that cowboy atmosphere when we need it!

I was not favorably impressed.\n\nThe drive to the restaurant after dark is confusing and we got turned around more than once trying to get to the parking lot.  The upper lot with the handicapped spaces is much too cramped, especially when the trolley/bus is there.  A negative.\n\nHaving the bull in a pen just outside the front entrance door was a turn-off for me.  Smelling bull s---- before I walked in the door did nothing to whet my appetite.  A real negative.\n\nThe stairs are somewhat steep and I felt very vulnerable going down the stairs (no slide for this old lady).  A negative.  We were lucky enough to be seated at a table over looking the city.  The view is spectacular.  That was a positive.\n\nWe waited for our server to arrive to take our orders.  We waited for our beverages to arrive.  We waited.  When our entrees were finally delivered to our table, they were put on a tray and left to sit for about 5 minutes before yet another server came to serve us.  It was pretty obvious that the plates had been allowed to sit for more than a minute under the lights in the kitchen, and adding the 5 minutes on the tray made for a steak that was only lukewarm.  A negative.\n\nMy filet was tough and had a lot of gristle in it.   A negative. The beans were good, but I can't say I was impressed by the meal.  I took the largest part of my steak home for the next day, and when I got it into good light to slice for a sandwich, I found a thick streak of gristle through the middle, which pretty-much negated the idea of making a decent sandwich.  \n\nWe had trouble finding someone to refill beverages, and we didn't see the same server at our table but twice--when she took our order and when she brought our check.  It was somewhat confusing to have to repeat our drink orders every time someone came to the table.  A negative.\n\nMy feeling is that a restaurant of this calibre, at the prices they charge, shouldn't have to entertain its patrons with someone who is making balloon animals.

The establishment sits near South Mountain here in phoenix and I must tell you the view is simply breathtaking.

My wife's company IKON office solutions hosted there annual party for the employees here and it was first class all the way. The gave away tons of prizes....check the photos I posted.....and everyone was so friendly.\n\nThis establishment is huge, which makes it great for hosting huge office parties like these. We had our own venue out back large enough to hold about 300 people or more and we still could move around. We didn't have to worry about disturbing other customers....because they were in the main dining hall of this establishment which is a throwback to the western days. There is live music and even an old school slide that you can ride down from the second level to the main eating level. There is also a huge steer out front as you come into the establishment....that's right a real life Texas steer....maybe not from Texas though....LOL.\n\nNow as for the food....well they served us BBQ chicken and ribs and I must say the Chicken was great....didn't try the ribs however....sorry....but my wife liked them. There were also baked beans...while not great...were not bad either. They also served homemade biscuits....corn on the cob...and there was a great garden salad as well. There was an open bar  for everyone to enjoy.....and I must say again the service....atmosphere...staff....food presentation....and ambience of this establishment were top notch.\n\nWARNING......WARNING.....WARNING....be advised that the parking here can be very bad. There is very limited parking on the \"Main Hill\" i will call it....right in front of the restaurant. There is plenty of parking \"Down Hill\"....which means you have to walk back up to reach the establishment....and trust me that is more than a notion folks. If your not in fairly good shape I recommend letting them valet park your car which is free....but tips are accepted....and you may have to wait awhile for you car when your ready to leave because they are pretty busy.\n\nThe other option is taking there shuttle bus....but you may be waiting for it as well. Since I am in pretty good shape I just walked back up the hill...but I would not advise that. Just wanted to put that out there because this city and state has a lot of elderly people and I would hate for them to come to this establishment and face this problem.

Should preface with the fact that we are vegetarian and were meeting a friend here who has wanted to check it out for a while. \n\nDrove up on a Saturday night at 7pm (apparently can't make reservations until after 8pm) and couldn't find any parking by the restaurant, weren't feeling in the mood for valet, so went down a decently sized hill to the extra parking lot. This resulted in us basically hiking to dinner, up a steep sidewalk with no stairs. Not sure how a family with any disabled or elderlies would handle this. Would have to pay for valet, I suppose. Walked to front door, hit with wall of \"cow smell\", and sure enough there was a HUGE longhorn just chillin out about ten feet away. Walked in, more ramps to hike up, finally made it to level ground at the front desk area. All the hostesses were basically wearing American flags for shirts and the servers were decked out in cowboy gear. We had a hard time getting the attention of the hostess taking names which was a little frustrating. We were surprised to be seated immediately having no reservation on Saturday night, but I suppose this place is SO HUGE that it isn't much of a problem for smaller parties. It took a couple minutes to get through the labyrinth and find our table, on the way passing the oh-so-popular slide that you can take from floor 2 to floor 1. \n\nSat down and tried to start a conversation, and were immediately interrupted by the triangle-wielding server army that came to the table next to us to sing Happy Birthday. Lots of banging and clanging served for a poor conversation atmosphere, and this was only the first of several birthday celebrations throughout our meal! We ordered a pitcher of the Arizona margarita to split between two people, and it was pretty darn huge. However the margarita was quite disappointing - all sugar and no alcohol. We finished the whole pitcher and felt nothing except slightly ill at the sugar content.\n\nWe ordered the one veggie menu item, the veggie burger. Our friends got the prime rib. The meal started with a large basket of fry bread and biscuits with regular and cinnamon butter, pretty standard but yummy. Then the server brought a huge salad for the table to share, tossed with ranch dressing. That was a nice touch that we didn't realize was included. The meal came, and we were pretty shocked to see that it included green beans, corn on the cob, steak fries, veggie chili, AND the burger!! We couldn't finish one meal between two people, and we are good eaters. Everything was good, but nothing special. The green beans seemed fresh though the corn did not. The steak fries were yummy. The burger was good (housemade I believe) but nothing special. Our friend really liked his prime rib. It looked well-prepared and gigantic, just like everything else in the joint. The meal ended with the server bringing a tin can full of cotton candy. Man, they just don't want you to live past 40 around here!!!\n\nFor vegetarians who never go to places like this, I'd say we had close to the best experience we could have expected. It is a loud atmosphere and everything is pretty pricy - however, you are paying for a MASSIVE amount of food, so I suppose it works out. Our takeaways: Definitely split a meal, do NOT get the margaritas, and don't come here for a classy place and intimate conversation. You are coming for the experience (and the pretty spectacular view!).

I went with a large group as part of a conference but I can't even imagine going here as a regular dinner table of 4 people. The place is huge & loud. \nWhen we arrived we went in the door marked handicap access with my elderly mom. There was what looked like a hostess stand right there, but the young woman assigned there was not only clueless but she made zero attempt to be helpful. Initially telling us we had to go back outside & proceed upstairs to the main hostess. I said we'd entered via the marked handicap entrance intentionally but she looked at us with oblivion. I then explained we were with a large group that was sitting outside with picnic tables & without asking which group, pointed ahead & said to keep going \"past the slide\" & we'd come to a doorway where a host could show us the way. We walked through a maze which included a dance floor & found no one, but we proceeded outside to where we saw groups. Eventually, a nice waiter was gracious enough to look up our group name & show us to our groups very nice private dining area. Once we arrived, we learned there had been at least 2 more direct and far closer routes. \nThe area our group had was really very nice. We had our own fire pit which was lit & of course the famous view of the entire Phoenix area. It was a really nice evening to be outside. \nThe food was set up in our own buffet & is served in cowboy style metal pie pans. The food was average, but portions were quite generous, with everyone getting a full half of chicken, beans, corn, salad & biscuits. They even brought more fresh, warm biscuits to our table. There was also large slices of what was probably the worse apple pie I've ever tasted on a separate buffet. \nOne of our guests learned that folks sitting inside got free cotton candy, so she got that ball rolling--a fun addition. \nWould I go back on a return to Phoenix? Likely not...this is more of a one stop novelty for me.", "business_id": "wZwZcte4lcbu51NOzCjWbQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-02-15", "type": "review"}

It would have been awesome if we could have sat on the patio all night but there was private party down there.. Darn. The people looked to be having a great time down there and it was decorated festively and the grub was looking good :)\nThe way the tables are arranged inside allows everyone to have a wonderful view and that's how it should be. \nOk, the restaurant is a steakhouse so for non meat eaters the selection is sparse but I found cheese enchiladas that are a side dish and you get salad and rolls served family style. We ordered the dressing on the side as others have suggested. \nMy other half splurged on the porterhouse steak (he was dying for!) and when it arrived it was cooked as ordered. No complaints from his side of the table, lol. My side dish was 2 small enchiladas, so if you are a bit more hungry order 3. They were all right . I will try the veggie burger with veg chili next time.\nDessert? Wowsa! I ordered an eclair since it was for my birthday and that guy is HUGE!  We cut into it  for about \"small\" size servings and still had almost all of it on the plate! Order when you have a large party or eaters. Great part is you can take it home.\nThere is a band that plays at 6 p.m. and they were pretty good  There's a small dance floor that some people chose to use.  Mostly Mom's and kids and the occasional couple. \nThe music is County and on the mellow side , not too wild, not too loud, so I suspect that's to let you enjoy your meal leisurely. \nCotton Candy.. last had this when I was a teen so we both decided to try it and it was better than we thought it would be when it was delivered when we finished our meal.

False.  Pick 1.  You can't have both.\nBeyond this trickery, the place is pretty cool.  The slide is fun, and it's neat to do some dancing by the live band.

Also, I really did not like the tri-tip pieces slathered in red-hot spicy sauce.  The beef tasted like tough chunks of chuck roast, and the sauce tasted like burning.  That's it.

Coming into this place, I had great expectations for the food. Sadly, the food wasn't as good as I expected it to be. I ordered the steak, which came with beans and corn. It was alright, but tasted like any other meal. The steak was a bit too chewy, the corn was... well, corn, and the beans were just 'okay'. Something was amiss. Also, it was difficult to have a conversation because it was quite loud. I'm not sure if this was because of the location of the table.  The restaurant didn't have a sit-and-dine kind of atmosphere, but rather a louder, rowdy wild wild west kind of atmosphere (which could be a good thing or a bad thing, depending). \n\nBottom line:\n-I would recommend checking out this restaurant if you want a new experience and a fun atmosphere, especially if you're new to Phoenix or Arizona.

I have heard about many times over the years as it is somewhat of a tourist landmark restaurant but never had the opportunity to try it.  The perfect opportunity arose last night when we had family in town and decided to give it a try.\n\nThis restaurant is situated at the top of a hill at the Arizona Grand Hotel.  The views are incredible and the feel and theme are really fun especially since we are right of the I-10.  It feels like you are in a small cowboy area in the middle of the city.  This is a family friendly place that is actually really good for kids as it is loud and your little ones won't be bothering anyone.  There is music 7 nights a week and it can be very crowded, despite the fact that the restaurant seats at least 500 not including the patio.  We were able to get a reservation as we were a larger group of 10 so that was nice.  The restaurant is very dim and we needed our smartphone flashlights in order to read them.  Thank goodness for technology.\n\nThe menu is what you would expect from a theme steak house.  The usual fare; steaks, chicken and some seafood with the typical side dishes.  I decided on the mixed grill which was very tender filet medallions and you had a choice of another meat and I chose the ribs.  They were also very good and tender.  The side veggie were carrots that were tasty but some were not cooked enough so they were tough.  We also all got cowboy beans (eh) and salad for the table as well as rolls that were kind of yucky.  For dessert, we opted to try the cowpie (how could you not?) which was basically chocolate covered coffee ice cream.  The description definitely sounded better than it tasted but it was ok to satisfy our sweet tooths.  The meals that my family had they enjoyed as well.  \n\nThis is definitely a place that I would come back to.

My boyfriend and I had the steak (chicken was the other option) and the sides were beans, corn a roll and salad. The steak looked good until we cut into it...man was it DRY and COLD! I love a good steak but I could barely cut into it much less eat it. I was so hungry I managed to eat 1/2 of it before I was so tired of chewing this tasteless piece of meat. What also wasn't good was that we couldn't get more sides so we were both hungry and after paying $70 each it was very disappointing. \n\nOne good thing was the great view from the restaurant!!", "business_id": "wZwZcte4lcbu51NOzCjWbQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-12-01", "type": "review"}

The rolls are good but I personally think that Logans Roadhouse has better ones (Logans are always soft and never overbaked, Texas's have been the last few times). Am I the only one that has noticed though that almost everything is wayyyy too salty? Every time I order fries here, they are doused in salt. The husband got the chicken fried sirloin last night with fries and both were super salty. The green beans have boatloads of salt too. Additionally, the ranch dressing tastes like crappy bottled Kraft dressing. One final thing that was a no go for me is that their fresh steamed vegis were terrible. Last night, their broccoli was not trimmed enough the ends of it were very hard and fibrous and the carrots were not cooked enough so they were still hard. Booooo. I am not a fan of vegis as it is but when eaten this way, I really despise them.\nNow what has been good is their chili although it is a bit rich. Its very meaty so if I ever have to go here (with a group of people, I wont come here on my own), I would just get a bowl of this and have some rolls. The husband also says that the ribs are great. They are always fall of the bone tender. Aside from that, we are unimpressed with everything else. One other thing is that their portions are fairly large. However, the food, as mentioned is kinda crappy so if you like eating lots of crappy uninspired food, this is your place. I have nothing against chain restaurants but this is one of those that I don't get what the hype is about (see my list of overhyped places). This place is always busy and the wait is at least an hour each time I have been to this location. They don't take reservations or call ahead.\nI would advise to try Logans instead. Not only do they have better rolls but their menu is better and has more selections. Logan's food is always better as well and they have sweet potato fries which is one of my weaknesses. Also, their wait is never bad. Sorry Texass but in my opinion, you kinda suck.\n\nPS: If you hate kids, DO NOT COME HERE. They are everywhere! The staff also seems to have a hard time accommodating large groups and there is not enough space in the area where they pile the large groups.

What they fail to realize is that Texas RH offers Call Ahead seating.  They'll put you on the list, and give you a window of time in which to show up, so your wait can be done comfortably at home (which is why later parties seem to be seated first).   Any halfway decent restaurant is going to have a wait, at least this one gives you a convenient way to work  around it.  Short of turning business away for your personal wait-time convenience, that's really all they can do.  \n\nI've been here countless times, and the food is consistently amazing.  Rolls are hot and buttery, meals are made fresh to order.  All of the steaks are wonderful, tender, and juicy, but I'd also highly recommend the pulled pork.  \n\nThe staff is great.  They keep our drinks full, and check in like clockwork.  Because it's so busy, servers usually stick to the priorities (seating, food, refill checks), but they always make time to ensure our food is cooked right after bringing it to us.  They're polite, but they don't have a lot of time to linger and chit-chat (For me, that's actually a plus).\n\nThe one downside is that Texas RH is always packed, and usually pretty loud.  If you're looking for a quiet dinner, with a lot of personal one on one time with your server, this probably isn't the place for you.  But if you want consistently great food, speedy service, and a fun atmosphere, you can't go wrong.", "business_id": "Mm8x_jzeLrWlvDEnqhuCBQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-02-14", "type": "review"}

Restaurants know this too and I think often they create a false perception by making people wait. When a customer walks in, sees a full lobby, and is given a short wait the expectations are increased. When I arrived I noticed the parking lot was not that full. Multiple parking places up front and on each side. I walked in to see 5 people waiting; I gave my name (table for 1) and was told maybe 3 minutes. A couple of other people came in behind me and were added to the list. As I looked around between the row of tables on the right side of the restaurant, the main dining section, and the area on the left there were 8 empty tables I could see, plus half of the bar was empty. So what's with the wait? My 3 minutes turned into closer to 10. \n\nThe hostess sat me at a table and said the server would be right with me.  A few minutes later and he wasn't there yet, so she came back and took my drink order. She returned (still no server) and she asked if I was ready to order. I asked about the soup and she had to check (which is fine since she isn't a server and doesn't need to know what the soup of the day is currently). I ordered the soup and a salad - which normally would be the $6.99 lunch special, but only until 3pm. Finally the server showed up with the soup and he said he thought the salad was almost finished. It's a salad - the smallest one of the menu and shouldn't take that long. The soup and salad are also on the 13 minute lunch menu so it should be quick. He returned one other time with a refill on the drink\n\nI finished the soup and salad, yet the server was not around. The empty plates and drink cups sat there for nearly 10 minutes. He when he came back I asked for the check and it was another wait. All in all it was an hour dining experience for a cup of soup and a small salad. As I left, the lobby was full with people waiting for a table - but once again there were several open tables. \n\nIt wasn't that busy, especially for a Saturday night, yet the lobby was full when there were plenty of seats available and the server was very slow.  The one redeeming factor was that it wasn't karaoke night. That usually is a horrible experience.", "business_id": "bNGR0iQTx8hXRmQv4hV5gw", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-02-04", "type": "review"}

I have seen the commercials on TV but never connected that this was the place I was seeing advertised. It was the girlfriends idea to come here on NYE before we hopefully went to a show at Gammage. So I called and made the reservations. Now I called sometime in November for the reservations and the person on the phone took all of my info and said \"it was down in the book\" but then I called the day of to confirm the reservation and the time and they didn't have a reservation for me. Uh oh. This might have been a problem but they took all of my info again and honored the lost reservation at the time I wanted. Nice save.\nWhen we arrived they had a booth all set for us. It is a very nice place. A little dark inside and old school but not old. Everything was well maintained and very clean. No holes in anything or dust anywhere. The booth was very nice. Plenty of room for two.\nThere were a lot of people there, hey it is NYE. At first I joked with my girlfriend that we weren't old enough to get into this place given the average age of everyone inside was well over 65. But although it was busy the service did not suffer at all.\nOur waitress was very nice. Our water glasses never even got close to empty and we were checked on just enough. Not too much to be pushy and not completely ignored.\nMy girlfriend, who had been here before, made all of the recommendations. We started out with their Cream Spinach Artichoke Dip. Wow was this good. So creamy. I could have eaten a whole other bowl of it. I think I am ruined on spinach artichoke dip from now on. Then on to the main course which of course had to be prime rib. This was cooked perfectly. Just the way I like it. It comes with creamy horseradish sauce which was good but I almost think the beef au jus they also give you was just a little better with it. I also got the mashed potatoes, on recommendation, and they were very good as well.\nEverything was just excellent. Service, food, everything. It may not be a five star restaurant but it deserves a five star review. Sure it is a little pricey but it was actually a little cheaper than I thought it would be. Plus it is worth it the price. You don't feel overcharged at all. The food is so good it is worth the price. We will definitely be back. Maybe not very frequently but we will be back.", "business_id": "Rus-ewyqLj2D1RlqK-je4w", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-01-06", "type": "review"}

Awesome!\n\nThe food was outstanding as ever, 10 oz Strips are delicious and the perfect size.  And to top it off with a chocolate thunder from down under was the icing on the cake!

My husband loves steak. usually I am not a huge fan of going to a steakhouse but it was my husbands turn to choose so I insisted we go. It is not that I do not like steak only that I often find I prefer the steaks I grill at home to the ones served  out. I do however lloooove the fried onions alot of the steak places have but this one did not have one. BOO! Anyhoo......we decided to order what was supposed to be garlic-peppered fried zucchinn. It was fried nicely and not too oily, but I did not taste garlic or any pepper in the seasoning. It came oddly with a cucumber dip (I think it was creamy cucumber dressing) we asked for ranch instead. It just tasted off. I ordered  a grilled chicken breast that was supposed to be seasoned with rosemary and spices well again, no rosemary. My chicken was dry and boring. I ate maybe half of it.It came with a side of broccoli and what was supposed to be GARLIC MASHED POTATOES also another popular side item at most steakhouses. AGAIN, nothing but bad to say about both these items. FIRST. Frozen cut broccoli should never be served  at any restaurant. I only eat fresh steamed broccoli.When you list on the menu fresh seasoned veg of the day I think it will be just that fresh. Next, garlic mashed potatoes. Anyone that loves these knows they are made with cream and garlic and should be creamy comforting goodness. These potatoes were like I nuked a potato dumped the  insides on my plate and smashed it with some butter and garlic salt. When I  asksed the server about them because I refused to eat them , she said \"oh yes no we don't make them that way here we leave out cream because people have allergies\" OMG! What a joke! CREAM is the best thing about em! what would be the point otherwise?I told them they should tell people this before they order. She asked me if I wanted a baked potato instead. I looked at her and said\" that is what I have all I need is to add sourcream\".(I don't think she liked me)  Oh but wait my husbands was no better. He ordered prime rib. They brought it out fully cooked! The server acted annoyed we complained about it.They brought out another piece- we waited another 20 for that and then they did not even offer to dicount our meal. In fact a manager never even came to talk to us even though I know the server did talk to him about our meal. Good service to me is even more important than food at times.I would NEVER GO BACK HERE. Mcdonalds would have tasted better. So I will be sticking with OUTBACK. At least they got the onion!", "business_id": "OreqUicD2AP5QW2HblqRoQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-01-27", "type": "review"}

Just the way Outback should be. But something must have changed, because last night - a Saturday night - when we arrived for dinner at 7, and were seated almost immediately, things immediately started to go wrong. We had no silverware or napkins until we asked for them - and that was after we had already finished our appetizer of coconut shrimp. I had a hard time getting the server's attention to request the napkins and silverware.\n\nThen the server forgot to bring bread until we asked for it, and she explained that they don't bring out bread now until after you've ordered. Almost ten minutes later, we still didn't have bread, so I asked her again. She brought the bread, and I cut into it right away, and it was cold to the touch. I have never in all my visits experienced cold bread at Outback. By the time I got her attention and she brought out another (warm) loaf, with apologies, our entrees had been served, and it was kind of too late.\n\nMy grilled salmon was one of the worst servings of salmon I've ever had at any restaurant - almost tough and chewy, rather than delicate and melt-in-your-mouth, as I've had it before at Outback. The baked potato was on the small side and not quite done - definitely not fluffy like they usually are. The manager never did come over to ask how things were. It was my birthday - my real birthday - and I had hoped for the same good experience we've had pretty regularly at this Outback, but now I wish we'd gone somewhere else.", "business_id": "r6zT-YqmOtHg8BJT3LLzfg", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-12-14", "type": "review"}

The only time we ever go is when my parents get a gift card for their birthdays because of the holiday deal where you buy a $100 dollar gift card and receive $20 extra coupon cards. We also had coupons from the mail that we used. We sat down ordered our drinks, I ordered the top sirloin with giant prawns, and my parents ordered the two for $42 with coupon (normally $52) that comes with an appetizer, two entrees, and a dessert.\n\nWe sat there eating our free molasses bread, and then the appetizer came out, but wait where's our drinks? Our server had forgotten about them, we quickly flagged him down and reminded him then he promptly got the drinks for us. Shortly after our entrees arrived. Tasting my steak I felt it was under seasoned; I'm not sure how others eat their steaks but I generally don't add salt and steak sauce to mine. In this case I had to add salt to gift it that extra kick. When biting my first prawn it was definitely under cooked so I put it a side to take home. Eating the prawns next day as I'm writting this reveiew they were delicious, just had to cook them a bit more. My dad complained about his baked potatoe was not rightand my mom said her chicken was over cooked and dry. This is the most inconsistent cooking I've seen in a long time at any establishment.\n\nFinally, we ordered the giant cookie with vanilla ice cream to finish off my parents two for $42, but by then we were full so we had our waiter pack the cookie to go and eat the ice cream there. He ended up packing both up and handed us the bill. We handed him the gift card and coupons to process and also asked for some spoons to eat the ice cream.

Last night was my Mom's birthday and we decided on going to The Keg at Chandler Mall.  I have never had a bad time at The Keg, but last night was horrible.  We ordered four steak dinners, salads, glasses of wine, beer, even dessert.  We were there to have a nice dinner and spend some money.  However, the service was completely horrible and unacceptable for the amount of money we were spending.  The salads came without bread, by the time they came by and asked if we wanted bread, we were already done with our salads and it had been over an hour since we sat down and we were ready for a meal since we were all hungry.  I waited quite a while for my IPA beer after finishing my Keg Size glass of wine and when I asked the waitress about the beer, she said, \"Oh yeah, sorry, it has been sitting at the bar and I haven't had a chance to get it\".  My Mom and I ordered our steaks medium well and they were completely red in the middle.  However, at this point, we didn't want to say anything because it had already been an hour and a half since we sat down.  My Mom wanted dessert, but didn't want to wait 30 minutes for it and so told the waitress nevermind.  The waitress replied that it would be out in 10 minutes tops.  Mom decided not to chance it and went home.  My son and I ordered desserts to go and they took over 20 minutes to arrive.  We thought since they were ordered \"to go\" that we would get our check and pay and leave, but it took another 20 minutes to flag down the waitress to get the check.  She seemed disinterested the entire time we were there, she rarely checked to see if we were OK or needed anything else and when we did need something else it took a very long time to arrive.  As a rule, I always tip 20% or more, but last night I had to leave 15% which was still quite a bit on a $170 bill, so the waitress still made out in spite of her crappy service.

Most of the plates do not even include a salad... It's pretty much a meat, a vegetable side for about $25-30.  \n\nAfter we placed our order the server took off to submit the order to the cooks and within 2 minutes she returned to inform me that they were \"out of\" the item I had selected.

I then selected my 2nd choice item but wasn't as thrilled with getting that as I was with my first choice.  The side was supposed to be asparagus.  When my plate came I had green beans on my plate.  I asked the server, \"I thought this dish came with asparagus?\"  She said, \"Oh yeah, they were out of asparagus so they substituted green beans.

Felt like they were trying to get us to move ! My husband orders his steak Chicago style steak and it came out raw. Meanwhile there was a girl walking around checking tables to move. I ordered a drink and received  it after I was finished with my meal!

Their steak (Strongly recommend the New York or Baseball Top) was perfect and required absolutely no sauce to make it taste good, because it was already fantastic.

Boy what a let down. \n\nLets start with the raggedy family wearing their beanies and Harley Davidson baseball caps that was seating right in front of me............ \n\nHello Dress Code......Manners......Anyone?? \nWhy did I bother dressing to the nines? I could have worn  my pajamas and nobody would have cared. \n\nThat right there just made me feel I might as well have went to Black Angus. \n\nNow for the waiter who lacked the experience and training to be serving in a fine dining establishment. \n\nHe was HORRIBLE!!! \nUnprofessional, Inattentive, and Careless to sum it up. He was so interested in my nationality that he had to ask me my heritage, then made a point to reference something Greek each time he returned to the table.......So Annoying! \n\nNot to mention bringing me dirty water and wine glasses, even the little wine decanter they bring your wine in was dirty. \n\nNow for my salad, I always order the Fresh Mozzarella and Tomato salad, this time it was apparent they improvised, the mozzarella was not near the quality it usually is and instead of sweet sliced tomatoes and fresh basil it came with chopped grape tomatoes on top of shaved cucumber. (see pics) \n\nI really should have complained, but being the Hubby's birthday I wanted to spare him the scene. \n\nFor my entree I decided on the Chefs Mixed Grill, Petite fillet, Tempura Shrimp and Seared Scallops. Although as always I asked to replace the steak with an extra shrimp and scallop as I don't eat beef. \n\nI got a plate of SIX GIANT scallops and three shriveled shrimp. \nI had to send it back because I was told I was getting Tempura Shrimp and these shrimp were not. \n\nThey returned it to me quickly but still was overkill on the scallops (see pics) in the pic you cant see the other side of the plate had 3 more scallops. I would have like another shrimp instead. \n\nMy Hubby's steak was perfect for him, but he too was very disappointed in all the things I've stated above. \n\nNow for the biggest let down of all. \nNormally for Special Occasions they will bring out their signature Creme' Brulee and Chantilly Cream with a candle. \n\nNOT ANY MORE! BOO! \n\nWe got a cheesy little gold box with four tiny, crappy chocolate covered strawberries....Not a Fan. \n\nAfter this experience I'm sorry to say that we will not be going back ever again.

If you go here, do not dine in the bar. The hostess might tell you its full service at the bar but the service at the bar is noticeably lacking. If you have a choice between waiting for a table and eating at the bar, eat at the table.  We were rushed, not all of our food was packed to go, water not refilled without asking (and waiter never apologized for failing to refill drinks), steak knives were not brought with the food, bread was not brought out without asking, had to ask for refill on wine (since when has a waiter not asked for refill on alcoholic drinks)...all of the usual amenities that are provided at table service was severely lacking at the bar.  The other aspect that annoyed me was that I asked for fried onion strings or straws on my steak and asked if they could prepare it. The server immediately got defensive and acted as if I was asking  foie gras on the side. Instead of simply responding with \"It shouldn't be a problem, I'll see what we can do\" His response was remniscient of a server at Applebees \"Well since we don't offer that item on the menu, I just don't know if they can make that\" Seriously, was I dining at Black Angus? It's called common sense, I can understand that response if I was asking for something other than fried onion strings. Very amateur to say the least!\n\nThe food itself is amazing at this location. They reall cook steaks well and if you order a medium, it comes perfectly cooked with mostly pink inside and just a little charred on the outside. It's one of the few places that really understand what a medium steak is and they don't overcook it like most places.  I like their steaks better than many more well known places including Donovans and Ruth Chris.  The service needs to improve even at the tables. You don't receive that royal treatment like you do at other upscale steak restaurants including Ruth Chris, Donovan's etc. I can understand that type of service if I'm dining at Outback Steakhouse but we just spent $167 for two and were formally and professionally dressed yet we were rushed as if we were eating at Chipotle during lunch rush hour.\n\nThe service needs to improve especially for a fine dining establishment. The basics like refilling drinks, smiling, addressing people as sir/mam, apologizing if items are forgotten are basic elements of good service at a fine dining restaurant yet it was lacking here. If you want an example of great service, go to Durants", "business_id": "0ONypOKIhttBz9IJzBE8jg", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-12-25", "type": "review"}

I had reservations, so even though it was busy, we were actually seated 15 prior to my reservation time. The atmosphere was as I expected, although I was a little surprised that some people dressed more casually than I would have expected. \n\nThe service was excellent. The waiter took our drink order and brought a loaf of bread that came with two spreads - both were excellent! One friend and I ordered the petite filet mignon, which was served with Fleming's potatoes. My other friend ordered the regular sized filet mignon with a baked potato. I have never seen a larger potato. My two friends each had a salad - one Caesar and house salad. The salads were each around $9, but good size. The regular filet mignon was $32, while the petite with the potatoes was $26. I didn't really think the regular size was that much larger than the petite. \n\nThe steak was phenomenal! I ordered it medium and I can't recall a better steak that I have ever had. It was cooked well, excellent flavor and the perfect size.  The server continued to fill our drinks, brought a second loaf of bread and made sure we had everything we needed.\n\nThe total of 3 diet drinks, 2 salads, a baked potato, 1 regular filet mignon and 2 petite filet mignons with the included Fleming potato was $135.

The ladies had glasses of wine and the guys had a Kettle martini with blue cheese olives (my absolute fav!).  The martini was excellent especially because it was 6 bucks.  The wine pour was a bit skimpy though.\n\nThe 4 of us shared the crab cake appetizer and it was excellent and will definitely order it again.\n\nFor an entree I ordered the sliced fliet mignon burger sans bun.  It is exactly as it sounds; basically a sliced filet mignon.  It was pretty thick so I have no idea how people actually eat the thing on a bun.  Anyway it was excellent as well as good sized.  I would order it again but I keep reading about how the Fleming's prime burger is very good not to mention a 3rd of the cost of the sliced filet burger.  I will probably try that next time.\n\nMy wife ordered the portebello mushroom burger and it was awesome.  It was topped with sauteed spinach and goat cheese.  OMG sooo good!  I should order that next time to put on top of a real burger.  It  was actually very good and I could see myself ordering that if I was not in the mood for red meat.\n\nFor dessert we all shared the lava cake.  WOW! Sooo good!  You have to order it 20 minutes in advance so you know it is fresh.  It comes with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a bowl of fresh homemade whip cream.  The whole thing was just awesome but that whip cream put it over the edge.\n\nThe entire staff that waited on us during the evening were very fast and friendly.

I give it 2.5 stars...\n\nFirst thing I noticed was that it was very dark inside- a pet peeve of mine.  Second, the service looked either harried or aloof.  Where were the smiling faces?  It was 4:15 pm, which meant the doors had just opened 15 minutes ago, and there weren't many guests yet waiting to be seated.  (There were about eight people at the bar area.)  I soon met my server, whose cold gaze and unsmiling face already had me thinking maybe this place was not such a good idea.  \n\nAfter studying the menu, I decided I'd try the Prime Burger for $6. I also asked if I could sample a couple of red wines before ordering a glass of one.  I've been to many venues where this is not a problem, and sometimes, when I can't decide, even willingly offered!  This Fleming's location isn't one of these venues.  My query brought about a more negative change of attitude from my server, but I did get to try two very small samples before choosing a glass.\n\nWhile I waited for the burger to arrive, I began to boot up my laptop- thank goodness I brought it, bec. the burger took a long time...  The bar area was filling up fast, and the servers started to look even more agitated that I was starting to wonder what was all the fuss?  Finally, just under 20 minutes later, my beautiful burger arrived.  Huge patty, smothered w/ cheese and topped w/ thick-cut, peppered, and smoked bacon, tomato, onion, lettuce, and a pretzel bun.  The one huge onion ring was a nice touch.  The burger was juicy (cooked to my specified medium), quite substantial, and delicious w/ the cheddar, veggies, and bun.  The thick-cut bacon, however, was so salty, that I had to take the slices off!  I was a bit disappointed, since it was such a hearty portion of bacon.\n\nI wouldn't mind having another Prime burger, minus the bacon, for happy hour again, but I'd choose another location. \n\nBTW, as I was enjoying the burger, I finally figured out why all the harried faces and the servers' hustle and bustle-- it seemed like everyone in the bar area had chosen the burger!  The table of six in front of me all had burgers... At $6, it's a steal for diners, but perhaps not expensive enough to garner a nice tip?

What is so neat too is the fact that each wine has a flavor profile description - so much better than having your waiter try to describe to you each wine or him guessing what you would like. \n\nThe food itself was pretty good, a bit peppery...but not overdone or anything (you better not get over done at a place like this) We went on a Sunday which turned out to be a good idea...every Sunday they have a special where you may have a prime rib steak with your choice of side and a salad and dessert for $29.99. Not too bad considering you will pay $25-40 per regular entree. \n\nThe ambiance is very classy, service is wonderful (the waiters even have their own buisness cards...weird, huh?) you can't go wrong with Fleming's for a special dinner or even just because. :)", "business_id": "0ONypOKIhttBz9IJzBE8jg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-12-11", "type": "review"}

The restaurant itself is well designed, with muted colors, dark woods and dimmed lighting.  The wait staff was neatly presented in crisp white shirts and clean, black service aprons.  We prearranged for a pre-printed dinner menu that was labeled as being for our party that night.  I thought that it was a nice touch, and I am well aware that it was also a clever cost containment measure since it also kept our staff from wildly ordering off of the regular Fleming's menu.\n\nOur servers were all very gracious and attentive and took very good care of our party of about 25.  Our food was all brought out at the same time, which was no small feat on the kitchen's part.  Everyone seemed genuinely happy with their food, I didn't see anyone complaining about anything.  \n\nI ordered the petite filet, medium rare, and it was absolutely perfect in every way.  The meat was cooked perfectly and was tender, moist and delicious.  There were various sides served 'family style' raging from buttered corn to asparagus, and they were all very good as well.  As a dessert I ordered cr\u00e8me brulee, and it was deliciously creamy with the perfectly sugar crust on top.  My only complaint about my food, and it is minor, was that the cr\u00e8me brulee wasn't the ice cold temperature that I usually prefer.  I like my cr\u00e8me brulee pre-fired so that it has time to cool off before I eat it.  I don't care for warm custard, but it's purely a personal preference and I still thought the dessert was fantastic.\n\nThe only other thing I would point out is that many people aren't fans of the a la carte menu system, it can be annoying, and ridiculously expensive, to order every side dish seperately from the main entree.   \n\nThat said, this was still a great experience in a wonderful restaurant.  I highly recommend it for any special occasion dinner as long as your budget will allow it.", "business_id": "0ONypOKIhttBz9IJzBE8jg", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-01-16", "type": "review"}

From the very beginning, she came across as very snooty and condescending. It made the whole table feel uncomfortable to the point of almost requesting another server. During the entire meal, she made little snide remarks and felt the need to correct us about everything from the type of coffee they serve, whether the cappuccino was sweetened, what order we needed to order in and even how bad the blood Mary's were there. She didn't check on the food after served and seemed bothered by any questions about the menu. Overall, it was a very bad experience not necessarily because of the food but because of Aubrey.  Although we looked young, everyone at that table makes 6 figures a year with platinum Amex cards as you saw. Don't do that...be mean, judgmental and arrogant. You were officially the lowest tip I have left in the last 20 years. Flemings you deserve and have better servers. Please know that Aubrey is not representing the brand or the chandler restaurant well at all.", "business_id": "0ONypOKIhttBz9IJzBE8jg", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-02-16", "type": "review"}

I called around 8pm to see if we could get a seat earlier.  I was told, \" we are booked for the night.\"\n\nWe showed up at 9pm and were seated immediately.  There were MANY empty seats.  I am not sure what the deal was with seating us earlier.\n\nThe food was INSANE good.  We each got a filet. We got a backed potato and Fleming's potatoes.  I am not sure why we got them, since we were so stuffed and had to get them to go.\n\nWe got the chocolate lava cake for dessert.  It was good, not great.  It tasted burned.\n\nWe got the calamari for an appetizer. They were slightly soggy.  The wine was great.  The service was great.\n\nOverall, VERY GOOD.

If I was rating on the food alone it would be five stars.\n\nThe service, not so great. The hostess stand was really disorganized. We had reservations, but when we walked in there was one girl at the desk refusing to make eye contact with us or the other couple that was waiting. There were two other girls behind her but they were busy talking about whether or not to post something on facebook (really? we can hear you).  Finally the first girl looks up and says she'll be right with us. Back to staring at her computer screen. More waiting.\n\nOnce we were at the table, the server was nice, he just took a very long time to do everything. It was about 15 minutes before anyone came to our table to greet us (which at the price point of Fleming's is ridiculous) and even then it wasn't our server, it was someone else who just dropped off water glasses and said that our server would be there shortly. That was about the pace of everything else. My date and I can usually pass the time very easily but there were points where it was getting so awkward waiting for the server to show up when we could see him aimlessly wandering throughout the restaurant (yes, aimlessly, not actually doing something, I used to work in the industry, I can tell the difference between someone who is legitimately slammed and someone who is just dazed and confused).\n\nAgain, two stars because the food was SO good. Not only for dinner that night but there was so much that I had a fabulous lunch the next day as well. But really for the whole experience go to Maestros or Capital Grille.", "business_id": "0ONypOKIhttBz9IJzBE8jg", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-02-22", "type": "review"}
