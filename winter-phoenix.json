When I got back to the shop to pick it up, I was charged $61.34. I questioned the difference between what I was told and what they charged me, and apparently it was $55 for the inspection, plus shop rags, plus tax.  I guess I should have seen this coming?   I have never been charged to look at the car.  And certainly not $62 for a ten minute inspection. \n\nI was in the market for a new mechanic, but this is NOT the one that I will be going with.  They were somewhat surprised that I would fuss at all about the $12 difference.  As if I should have expected a 30% markup from what they told me.  Not a great way to build a relationship.  If they had told me before they took my keys and information about the cost of the inspection, quite honestly, I would have taken my car somewhere else.\n\nBottom line:  I think that if you know you are going to get work done, these guys look really top notch. But be prepared to pay for it.\n\nUPDATE:   I just finished repairing the car myself, and what these guys wanted to charge me $900 for, I was able to do myself for $140.  And that included buying a $20 set of drum brake tools, and a $25 Chilton's manual.  They told me that it would $130 JUST to bleed the brakes, which I did in about ten minutes with nothing but a pair of channel locks.

My first culinary experience at Thaiger was several months ago with co-workers. My omnipresent dinner companion Marcial and I, have been habitual customers since.\n\nOffice employees flock to Wild Thaiger during the week for lunch and bring a few close friends or relatives back at night or on the weekend to share their secret.  The restaurant atmosphere is very friendly and unpretentious.  \n\nThe food is where the adventure begins. For a flaming start, Tom Yum Goong is a must of any visit to Wild Thaiger.  The soup is a concert of spicy hot lemony flavors that leave you wanting more.  Don't fret, you can always order more to go.\nDragon's Eggs are paramount on our list of favorite's starters These Dumplings are stuffed with pork and crab, wrapped in tender wrapping, nestled in fresh vegetables and comes with a seasoned dipping sauce. \n\nThe Lunch and dinner menu is delectable and you will want to try a new dish on each visit.\n\nOrder hint: Each plate is made to your specification.  If you want \"more curry\", \"spicier\" or \"hotter\" you only need to ask. \n\nDesert Hint: The Coconut Ice Cream is made onsite: It is delicious and contagious.\n\nDrink hints: A nice compliment to the food is a glass of Chardonnay or you can try the sweet Thai Iced Tea. \n\nIt is very common for the Olashawn (owner and head chief) to leave the open kitchen to seat, greet, and serve her guests.  She is the heart of The Wild Thaiger.  As Marcial and I leave and thank her for another wonderful meal, her gracious smile, hands clasps and graceful bow, keeps us coming back.\n\nNote:  METRO Lightrail construction has impacted this restaurant and you need to follow construction signs carefully to navigate the street and driveway to Wild Thaiger.  Drive slow, this Tiger is worth hunting in the concrete jungle.", "business_id": "KPoTixdjoJxSqRSEApSAGg", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-01-05", "type": "review"}

And sure enough, we arrive and wait in the tiny entry way for at least 10 min before being approached by anyone. In that time, a friend who had arrived early and staked out at the bar informed me that as soon as she sat down, she was told that she couldn't order food because the kitchen was temporarily shut down because they were too busy. At the time we arrived it was maybe 30 percent full, and she assured me that that had happened 30-40 minutes ago, so they should be back on track by now. \nThe host finally showed up and said she could seat us, but it would be a while before the server would take our order bc they were \"recovering.\" Well, that's better than 10 people blocking an entryway, so I'm not sure why she seemed hesitant to seat us, even if we had to wait for a server. She assured us that we could order drinks from our table until the kitchen was \"ready.\"\nIt was only downhill from there. Thankfully, we were a jovial bunch - under any other circumstances this experience would have been disastrous. 15 min to get drink orders, another 15 to get the drinks. Another 20 min later he took our food orders. 30 min later they started coming out, sort of. Seven entrees came out, staggered over a period of five minutes. But three entrees - all pad thai - didn't arrive until at least 10 min later, when everyone else was finished. I understand not everyone can get food at exactly the same time with a party of 10, but they didn't even come close, and at the time we made our food orders it was at least an hour if not more after their alleged huge rush that shut down the kitchen. \nI got the peanut chicken - grilled chicken with peanut sauce, rice and grilled veggies. The sauce was too citrus-y for a peanut sauce and too thick (funny that I complained in my first review that my curry was too thin). Chicken underneath was completely flavorless and was dry and veggies were scant. Good thing it was only $10. Didn't get details from anyone else except the BF, who got the Kao Pad Jay, and kept saying over \"I'm so glad I got this!\"\nAll these issues seemed to be circumstantial (except the chicken dish), but, then again, how long has WT been a restaurant? Come on, I'm sure they've dealt with many a Saturday night rush and someone (ahem, manager??) should have at least come out to explain/apologize for their issues.

I can't think of a better place to have my birthday dinner. This place is fantastic!  The food was great and served with true elegance but in a casual setting. Even though it was a weekend evening and the place was absolutely packed, the service was great.  We were told right from the start that there would be at least a 20 minute wait and they were dead on in their estimate.  No problem at all.  I don't mind waiting if I'm told the wait time and it is accurate. \n\nThe atmosphere is relaxing, intimate and the decor is not over done as are so many Thai restaurants.  Can you say clean?  Even on such a busy night they kept the place almost spotless, even the bathrooms.  The kitchen is open to the dinning area and you can see how well managed and organized every thing is.  The kitchen staff looked like a well oiled machine in action.\n\nThe Food and Drinks:\nWell to start off, we didn't order any adult beverages this evening as we were going out to a local night club after dinner for our fill of libations. Instead I ordered the Iced green tea which was brewed to perfection!  I don't remember what everyone else had but I know one member of our party got the Thai Iced tea and said it was fantastic.\n\nAppetizers:\nWe ordered a bunch of appetizers for the table.\n\nDragon Eggs - These pork and crab stuffed dumplings were tender, tasty and served with a mild-tangy dipping sauce.\n\nSatay Sampler - Shrimp, beef and chicken skewers marinated in a tasty coconut curry and served with peanut sauce and cucumber chutney. Loved it!\n\nWild wrap - Spicy chopped chicken with a mint-lime sauce served with cabbage leaves. This tasted so fresh. Yes, spicy but very refreshing at the same time.\n\nVeggie Spring Rolls - Tender and crispy rolls stuffed with fresh veggies, cellophane noodles and served with a great plum sauce. They really were tender yet crisp, hot, tasty and the veggies tasted so fresh you would think they had a garden out back. I looked for it but found nothing but parking lot.\n\nHot Pot:\nWe also shared a Tom Yum Goong hot pot. The soup was nice and spicy, the shrimp was tender, the mushrooms had a rich earthy flavor and the lemongrass infused a wonderful aromatic hue to the soup.\n\nMain Course:\nI had the Ginger Fish. This is a breaded piece of salmon topped with mushrooms, onions, carrots and pineapple with a ginger sauce along with fresh sauteed veggies and rice. The presentation was first-class and portion size was very generous . In fact, I ended up taking about half of it home.  Trust me, it was so delicious that I really wanted to finish the whole dish but after all the appetizers and soup I thought I might explode if I didn't stop eating!\n\nOnce again, I cant remember what everyone else had but there were no complaints at all.\n\nDesert:\nOMG the Lemon Ginger Cheesecake is to die for!  Enough said. Period!\n\nWill I go back?\nI wish I lived in their back room so I could eat every meal there.\n\nHats off to The Wild Thaiger.\nThe best Thai food I have found anywhere in Arizona.", "business_id": "KPoTixdjoJxSqRSEApSAGg", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-02-05", "type": "review"}

The restaurant was busy but there were 3 empty tables and one group of 3 before us that was waiting in the outside patio area. The hostess was nowhere to be seen. About 5 minutes later, she shows up and takes down our names and tells us it will be about 10 minutes for a table for two. We're fine with that so we agree to wait inside the restaurant as it was pretty cold outside. Ten minutes pass. The group of 3 before us is still waiting and the 3 empty tables are still empty. In the meantime, about 5 other groups of people have come in after us and put their names down for tables. The hostess disappears again at 6pm. I noticed this because I looked at my phone and the 10 minute wait was now 15 and the group before us still had not been seated. About 5 minutes later, the hostess comes back to seat the group of 3 and disappears again. Two couples come into the the restaurant and after waiting 5 minutes at the hostess station, one of the couples walks to the back, hoping to get someone's attention so they  can put their name down for a table. We watched them stand there for 5 minutes and then walk out of the restaurant. 6:15. No sign of the hostess. Other people have arrived and walked out as well. We see the hostess clear a table and then bring to go boxes to a table and walk right by us. She doesn't make eye contact, she doesn't apologize, she doesn't tell us it will be just a few minutes. In fact, she scurries away so quickly, she doesn't hear us when we say \"Excuse me, miss?\" to get her attention to find out how much longer it will be. Most of the people who were in the restaurant when we arrived are now finishing their meals. It's 6:25 and the hostess has been away from her station for 25 minutes. Our 10 minute wait was 40 standing up without so much as an apology or offer of water or a drink while we waited.

I have seen her through thick and thin, joys and sadnesses, 2 breast lump scares, abnormal papsmears, etc.  No matter what troubles and health concerns God presented me with, Dr. Johnstone was there to calm me, lend an ear to any and all of my concerns, and to move forward with appropriate treatments.\n\nI was overjoyed last May to learn that my husband and I were expecting our first child.  I could not wait to go to Dr. Johnstone's office to tell her the news & talk with her about the prenatal care that was to come.  Unfortunately, due to the fact that it's a 45 minute to a 1 hour drive to Dr. Johnstone's office, my husband asked if I could please find a doctor closer to our home in North Scottsdale to go to for the prenatal care as he did not see any sense in driving so far south to frequent appointments when there were perfectly capable doctors much closer to home.\n\nHesitantly, I agreed to switch doctors.  I asked my primary care physician at Mayo Clinic Thunderbird who she would recommend and she gave me the name of an OBGYN only about 15 minutes from my home.  My husband and I visited them for several appointments.  The doctor and the office staff were courteous and nice.  They seemed to know what they were doing/talking about.  However, this doctor WAS NOT Dr. Johnstone.  I missed her, her patience with my questions, her terrific way of explaining things to me in a way I could understand, etc.  \n\nAfter I cried and cried to my husband to PLEASE let me switch back, I returned to Dr. Johnstone late in my 2nd trimester for the remainder of my pregnancy.  My baby is due Feb 7th 2013 & I couldn't be happier I made this decision.  I could not imagine anyone other than doctor Johnstone delivering this baby.  \n\nI have read the reviews others have posted regarding not being pleased with the front desk/office staff.  I have not had that experience.  They are running a business and sometimes they are very busy and down to business, but I find that if you greet them with a positive attitude, a smile, and your respect, they will be equally respectful to you.  \n\nI would definitely recommend Dr. Johnstone and her practice to anyone.  It is true sometimes they run behind and you need to wait to be taken back for your appointment a little late.  I am not put off by this as I worked for Social Security for approximately 8 years and I understand what it's like to fall behind when giving your full time and attention to each individual as they deserve.  Also, I would imagine it would be reasonable to think some patients may be a little late for their appointments causing the whole office to fall a little bit behind.  It does not turn me off at all, and I will gladly continue driving the distance for this high quality of care (& genuine caring) in the future.", "business_id": "1acmBPmmFDovVSHHzMrJ9A", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-01-30", "type": "review"}

The juice section is decent. The booze section is useful.

I'll be slipping through those sliding doors a little more often. And I will be driving thru the Taco Bell across the way a little less often. Because this location is now open 24/7, people.

It was greasy and not too flavorful, but the salsa balanced out the greasiness.  My friend had the bbq burger and the black fish tacos, and they enjoyed their dishes as well.  It's not outstanding, but a nice place to eat at with a nice view.  They also gave a peppermint white chocolate tamale dessert for free at the end of my meal!

As it turned our, I should have listened to my stomach. The basket of chips included blue corn, yellow corn, sweet potato and surprisingly the best of the bunch, fried won ton skins with Navajo spices. The salsa was pretty good though when my friend asked for something spicier, all they did was dump some cayenne pepper into the same salsa and serve it in a different shaped bowl.\n\nWe started with the cheap happy hour margarita, which was better than expected to their special Commemorativo margarita, which was served to us in the shaker. For the price, it was a lot of margarita with a lot of tequila and it was tasty. Can't beat that...except maybe with a couple of rounds of Patron.\n\n I knew I was in trouble, though, when I asked the waiter to recommend a vegetarian dish and he suggested the veggie pasta with black beans and ginger soy sauce. Not sure why I listened to him when every part of my being told me not to order pasta at a Mexican restaurant. But I did. My pasta came with three toothpick thin pieces of asparagus, one mushroom, two pieces of zucchini and a little pile of spinach. There were a few black beans hiding in the noodles which were slightly tinted brown, supposedly the Ginger soy sauce. It was the worst meal I have had in a very longtime and a total disappointment to say the least. I tried a piece of my friend's tuna and it was overbooked, try and bland.\n\nAll in all, this place got one star for their margaritas and one star for their chips.

They are conveniently located on 3rd not far from the convention center.  The Tex~Mex Decor was sorta fun with a small bar area near the front and a huge patio along the park side of the restaurant.   \n\nThe service was a bit slow but they were very busy for lunch.  I think everyone at our table had salads, all were A~OK.  Their Cobb salad was rated the best at our table.  The Blacken steak taco salads were lacking steak and and other veggies would have been nice too in addition to just lettuce, cheese and diced pieces of steak.  The Cobb was full of everything your would expect with a good Cobb salad and was very tasty.  The Chicken taco salad was better than the steak.\n\nThe chips and salsa at first appeared to be very impressive as many other Yelpers have mentioned however your either a fan or not a fan.  I'm not a fan unfortunately...  The chips were too greasy with way too much of their seasoning!  I especially did not like their salsa.  It had no heat and HUGE chunks of tomato's! YYYEEAA~UCK.  Way too much work to get to the little bits of salsa that were actually kind of good.  I asked for a different salsa, my server just brought us some hot sauce to add to the salsa. Some of folks at our table did like their chips and salsa though. The Grand Canyon Margaritas were very good and a recommend from me to you.  \n\nSuggestion: seek out the \"Info-dude\" that walks around the Mall area to show people where to go and ask him for some coupons. We were able to get 20% off our meal coupons from him.  Based on their margaritas and a few other Yelp reviews I'm looking forward to my next visit but will order something different.", "business_id": "e5kc0CQ4R-PCCDgb274gSg", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-02-06", "type": "review"}

I don't know if they've changed management or service since they changed their name to Canyon Cafe but the service here frustrated me so badly I had to give it 2 stars for \"I've experienced better.\"  The wait for food is rather long most times of the day, which, at lunch time especially, can suffice as a reason NOT to go here. You definitely won't make it back to work within an hour.  \n\nBut here's the main reason I started boycotting Sam's. I went here with a friend who is allergic to cilantro once. She tried ordering 4 different things that presumably wouldn't have cilantro on them and each time she selected something the waiter just said \"That has cilantro too.\" How about helping to identify some items WITHOUT cilantro, Mr. Waiter?! When she had finally just decided NOT to eat at all, I asked the waiter if he could go ask the cook if he could make anything without cilantro so my friend could eat.  Rather than doing that, he said, \"well, I know all the ingredients in everything so that won't help.\" Nice. Finally I asked the waiter if the chef could make a quesadilla (tortillas & cheese!!!!!!) without cilantro and he STILL said no.  Do you know why? Because it's served with pico de gallo on top. HELLO?!?! just leave it off....idiot. It was really a terrible experience. Usually restaurants at least ATTEMPT to accommodate food allergies. NOT this one. \n\nTHEN, to cap it all off, I asked for parking validation for the garage when we were ready to go. All restaurants at the Arizona Center give validation for parking because why would you pay an additional $5-$10 just to eat at so-so restaurants?  The hostess responded with a simple, \"Sorry - we're out\". I had no patience left after the no-cilantro fiasco so I inquired further and finally a manager came out and said, \"Oh - no parking? - I'll go get more validations from our sister restaurant around the corner.\" He was back in 1 minute. How difficult was that? The lack of problem-solving skills among the staff here really astounded me, and for this reason, despite the fact that this place is super convenient to my job and home, I haven't been back since.", "business_id": "e5kc0CQ4R-PCCDgb274gSg", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-02-15", "type": "review"}

I love that you can walk right in on a Friday or Saturday night without waiting for a table - I don't know why that is, maybe the location?  But the food has always been phenomenal.  The seared tuna and fresh veggies is so good and the portion is twice the size I've ever gotten elsewhere - so it's a great lunch the next day.  Chips and salsa are the best of anywhere.  The chips basket is a mix of white and blue corn, PLUS fried wonton wrappers with a sweet/spicy spice blend AND sweet potato chips.  Sooo good.  And it's a great, roasted salsa too.  I've had dinners, salads, quesadillas there and everything has always been good.  I'd always take my assistant there for secretaries day or for their birthdays and they always love it.  We've had out of town visitors and they always love it too.  If you love calamari, there's is great.  IT's cornmeal dusted with a spicy sauce... but there's TONS... so bring friends.  Really.  Usually a calamari order is $10+ and so small you don't want to share, this is under $10 and enough for 5 ppl.  Delish.  I LOVE that they bring you a white chocolate (and pecan) tamale after dinner.  Just the perfect little two bites of sweet to finish your meal.  Consistently good food.", "business_id": "e5kc0CQ4R-PCCDgb274gSg", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-01-13", "type": "review"}

I want this place to succeed, I really do, but based upon a couple of my experiences here it seems they themselves do not want to succeed.\n\nCanyon Cafe has a really nice location in downtown Phoenix at the Arizona Center. One of its main selling points is the huge shaded patio overlooking the Arizona Center courtyard with tall palm trees and soothing waterfalls. They have some of the best margaritas I've ever tasted. The food is mediocre.\n\nMy first three times here last winter were great. Canyon Cafe was one of my first restaurant experiences in Phoenix, as I had just accepted my first big boy job and had relocated from Pennsylvania. I was in love with the new climate and the countless varieties of margaritas. The food was so-so, but the atmosphere and service received were wonderful. My server was the older lady with shorter gray hair--perfect! \n\nMy fourth time was on a Friday night, and we arrived to a surprisingly empty restaurant around 8:30 for dinner. The chile-rubbed sirloin left a lot to be desired, but the Orange Beso margaritas were its saving grace. I really love these margaritas, and I highly recommend this place for margaritas, and margaritas only, but only if you want to stop drinking them by 10pm on a Friday night. I didn't know they closed at 10pm on a Friday night until the server presented me the check at 10pm saying that they close at 10pm on Friday nights. Seriously? I'm not one to consciously stay past closing time, but giving one of your few remaining repeat customers the proverbial 'foot in the ass' is probably a big reason as to why you have no one in your restaurant on a Friday night. That, and you don't have a HH to lure customers in earlier in the evening. Get with the program.\n\nIn the spirit of redemption, I came here solo for a late lunch yesterday. The place was nearly empty, but that's to be expected at 4pm on a weekday. I picked a nice patio table overlooking the courtyard on an absolutely beautiful 80 degree day. I sipped on my Blue Moon margarita, wayfarers on, giving thanks I wasn't in the torrent of shit that was unloading on the east coast. I ordered the Salmon Caesar Salad and went back to sipping and basking. Five minutes later my waitress returns asking me what I ordered. Sip.\n\nThis particular Caesar salad has apple and pear slices in it, which sounded deliciously refreshing. I was let down when the bowl arrived and the pieces were about the width of a toothpick. The salad and dressing were great, but the salmon tasted too fishy, leading me to believe it was old. \n\nI'm about halfway finished with my margarita when my server drops the check, not even asking me if i'd like another margarita. There are literally three tables in the entire restaurant and I feel like I'm being rushed out again. I don't touch the check, but proceed to sip, people watch, and check my phone to see how the market did. Ten minutes later she opens the check presenter that's on my table,\n\n\"Oh, you're not finished?\"\n    No.\n\"Just enjoying the weather?\"\n    ..........\n\nI think I'm finished now. I'm finished with this restaurant. This place is a headache. Also check out their website. It looks like something I could have created using Visual Basic in high school. This place reeks of complacency. 2 stars only because of the margaritas.", "business_id": "e5kc0CQ4R-PCCDgb274gSg", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-02-19", "type": "review"}

As a bonus they also gave us some corn husk wrapped white chocolate with nuts.\n\nI chose the seared tuna and was floored at how good it was. Two generous tuna steaks/filets came served on top of a blend of fresh grilled bell peppers, zucchini and other seasonal veggies. The tuna was dressed in a delicious dry rub and zesty sauce, like zesty mayo or something. \n\nEveryone else seemed happy with their food. We were quite a diverse crowd with different backgrounds and tastes so it was quite impressive to hear overall satisfaction. \n\nA couple logistical things that were annoying was that there was some miscommunication between the kitchen and wait staff so quite a few of our guests who ordered steaks had to wait quite a while until they finally came out. I mean a long wile... like to the point of wondering if they had to go lasso, haul, and slaughter the cow. They were also out of dos equis.

The decor was not as quaint as I was hoping, more like old grandma grunts than chabby chic and garden like. Country not Victorian. Anyway, it was the experience we were looking for, and my wife had been here before. \nWell, we started off with a brand new waitress, nice girl, but zip on the training, than a girl with three months experience came out, again, no training. Both of these girls would seem happier in a less than Victorian life. We asked about teas and blends, but had no assistance. They only offered a couple and you had to share the pot! What is the deal with that - for $19 bucks a pop I wanted my own pot of earl grey while my wife sipped on apricot! \nWell, one waitress was quitting that day and decided to slam her boss over and over again to us, we were about to leave when the owner came out - we said it was not the experience we were looking for, she apologized and the service got slightly better. Where were the tea cups - we had punch glasses and cracked porcelain with stains. No plates at first, the tea was nothing to write home about. \nMy daughters tea was ok, the cookie was boring, artless and lacking in any frosting or style. The finger sandwiches were pretty good - not quite British, more like deli style, but tasty. The scones a bit dry and the jam, maybe WalMart strawberry.  The worst was the dessert. COSTCO SPECIAL! Little dainties of mini eclairs and mini cheesecake squares still frozen with some Rheddi Whip Cream on the side. My six year old loved as she has a dairy intolerance and took an enzyme and she got to splurge. All of this with the griping trainer and the poor helpless trainee for 19 bucks a person. What else could you ask for? A REFUND - which the owner graciously gave us. The place has potential - but needs to work out the kinks, up the presentation, get a better scone recipe, take some time to learn about teas and train their staff, and YES - learn to bake desserts!

Instead, the mass kept ascending in circles like the incense. It was like a holy party, with all of creation joining in the celebration of its Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.\n\nThe mass was sung and prayed much more than spoken. There were traditional carols, Latin chants, and pieces of Handel's Messiah. The choir did wonderfully as the happy voices of those gathered were all taken up and transfigured as if by one power.\n\nThe celebrant was Father Vincente Mesi whose beautiful, crystalline voice sang out and chanted the prelude to the declaration of Christ's birth as well as the Gospel reading from the pulpit.\n\nBy 2 am the people began to stream out of the church with the bells tolling from the towers unabashedly with good news, pounding with a rebellious happiness against the tall, dark downtown buildings and skyscrapers of Phoenix. The bells sang the happy triumph, the surprise victory of love and meekness, over the pride and might of the world.\n\nMany, though no doubt not all, felt they had encountered the mystery of a happiness and joy that strips and transcends all human understanding. Many, though no doubt not all, walked away with their hearts full of this sacred joy.

We were there for almost 2.5 hours and the time flew by.  The permanent exhibit was laid out nicely and I truly learned quite a bit that I did not know previously about Native Americans.  In fact, I had no clue how many different tribes call Arizona and New Mexico home and reading the history and how they are now was quite fascinating, but I am a history nerd. The Remix contemporary exhibt was well-done and was my favorite portion of the whole museum, but I'm a sucker for contemporary art and installations.  We even wondered about the \"children's area\" and that was also well done with a variety of hands on crafts and activities for little peanuts (heck, my husband and I even did some of them! hehe).   The boarding school exhibit on the second floor was very nicely done and well laid out...the testimonials that played while you walked around were quite touching and at times I felt myself tearing up.\n\nAdult admission is $10 and students are only $5. My husband forgot his ASU student ID and when he mentioned it to the cashier, the guy was like, \"oh that's OK\" and gave us the student admission anyway. Very nice.  There were quite a few people at Heard while we were there, but I never felt rushed or that I was in someone's way, which I think speaks highly of the layout.  I definitely recommend the museum if you have an afternoon you are looking to fill and/or just want to learn more about Native Americans.", "business_id": "SG_gEmEXL4ID6RAEinC5Bg", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-01-22", "type": "review"}

It depicts the Navajo Creation Story and is intricate and beautiful.\n\n- The Hopi Wedding Dress inside the Homelands Exhibit\n\n- The Photograph of the Grave yard outside the Indian School in the Boarding School Experience. \n\n- The Statue of Native women outside the museum. \n\n- The Yazzie Mural inside the We Are exhibit. It depicts the story of the Navajo and Yaqui Tribe's modern history. \n\n-The beaded chucks in the Shoes exhibit! I want a pair!!\n\nWhen it comes to the Heard's Gift shop: now this place is amazing!! Many of their pieces are authentic and hand crafted. BUT THERE ARE FAKES AMONG THEM!!! Feel free to ask a lot of questions. Even try to negotiate prices. You never know, some of those pieces have been there for YEARS! Demand certificates of authenticity. Ask to know the meaning of symbols and designs. Know what materials they're made out of! \n\nThere could be two bracelets that almost identical and one could be silver plated and one could be solid silver. And they could both be priced the same. ASK QUESTIONS!! Ask to try to stuff on. They are usually pretty nice about this, except when it comes to earrings. Many hard to find books can be found here. Whenever someone is doing a research project, the Heard is one of the first places I recommend. I recommend the photography books.\n\nTheir exhibits are always changing. So check the website and see what's new. Have fun, bring a friend, and open your mind and see the many wonderful facets of Native American Culture.\n\n****UPDATE****\nOne of our fellow yelpers Deb K. http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=sGzHUN7UpjXUGKckrv-bTw has sent me private messages asking me to edit my review and I am! She believes and knows that all the pieces are authentic at the Heard's Gift Shop. \n\nShe has said and I quote: \"Hi Cher, Deb K. here--actually, I do work at the Heard and I can tell you that everything that we sell is authentic.\"  and she even goes on to say, \"Maybe you're thinking about those dreamcatchers and whatnots in the back? Even those have to come from a Native-owned and operated establishment. [although I do agree they're kind of tacky, but you know the bilagaanas (White People)...they do like their kitschy stuff]\" And what really got me was: \"I really feel you should go back and change the part about the shop offering 'fake' items\". \n\nAs a Native American, sometimes it's a love/hate relationship with the Heard. The Heard is the premier launching pad for non-natives in this city to experience Indian Country but sometimes it comes at a price. We are often objectified and practically forced to share that which is sacred to us. But it's allowed and it's a choice that each Native artist that has dealt with has the Heard made for themselves. \n\nThere is an unequal representation of Tribes on display at the Heard, the Navajo exhibit is HUGE at the Heard and yet the O'odham exhibit is medium sized. Even though O'odhams have contributed over $1,000,000.00 to the museum. We don't complain, atleast our ways are being shared right? And it's nice to take children to the museum and see their little eyes light up when they see things that reminds them of home. And the Boarding School Exhibit opens MANY eyes to the history that existed just a few blocks north. This slices through me and I'm so grateful this piece of history is no longer being ignored.\n\nLike I said - it's a love/hate relationship. I love the Heard because they give opportunities to Native Artists and share our culture as sensitively as possible. But it's an uphill battle to be deemed good enough to be one of those artists and people who shares our culture. I know of many great people who I personally feel should be \"let in\" be denied and my heart goes out to them. I love that Natives still get in for free but I hate that the Heard treats AZ tribes like we're obligated to help them to keep their lights on. I love that all the tribes in Arizona have been given the oppurtunity to share a piece of their culture yet I hate that the museum focuses on two tribes.\n\nTo my yelpers: Please realize that each tribe has it's own ways and unique culture.

It's much better and more informative. After you finish his, then read mine. Ok? It's because I'm going by memory from 4 years ago and David B. lives in Phoenix and has just been there.\n\nI was born in Scottsdale, went to school in Phoenix and go to Giant's/A's/Angel's/Padre's/Brewer's/Mariner's and now the Dodger's for Spring Training. The desert is in my blood with all of the red sandstone rocks, cactus, roadrunners, and bluebelly lizards. As a child, I would go out and collect boys things... like snakes, crawdads, eggs, aquamarines, agates, spiders, then bring them home to an unhappy Mother. But I also went to school with actual Native-American kids who would wear their cool native clothes and so I got hooked on everything-Indian. Plus, we would go on amazing school field-trips to the local museums. Yea, for getting out of school...\n\nThe Heard is known as the other major Phoenix destination besides the Phoenix Arts Museum but I personally feel it is much better. It is world-class in its exhibits of Native American artifacts, such as pottery, katsina dolls, sand paintings, rugs, baskets, textiles, jewelry, blankets, it's all here. If you love American history, especially Indian, you have to come here and soak it all in. \n\nThe founders, Dwight and Maie Bartlett, loved their Southwest and therefore collected as much as they could afford, then fulfilled their ultimate dream to share it all with the public in 1929.\n\nMost people don't realize it because not much is taught about them, but our native Indians were so creative and amazing people who had such an artist's heart and desire to express themselves and the Heard really shows their work off to the highest degree. There are 39,000 items of cultural and fine art, including drawings, painting and sculpture. Of all of the possibilities to see when you visit, the core of the collection includes 500 simply incredible Hopi katsini dolls that were on loan from the exclusive Goldwater and Harvey Companies. Ritualistic, religious, complex and often hidden meanings are withheld in each individual katsini and I love them for their mystery. Another exhibit that I love because I am just a big kid is the full-sized Navajo Hogan, the Hopi piki room, the Yaqui ramada and the Pueblo oven. Maybe someday I can sneak in and stay over night.\n\nSo, in summary, if you ever visit Phoenix, you have to go to both the Heard and the PAM plus the Taliesin West (I always spell that wrong) building by Frank Lloyd Wright.

Whether it is in between or on either end of the spectrum, it is an overwhelming situation for all parties involved.  In 2012, when I decided to leave my husband, I had no idea how out of hand the situation would get.  Thankfully, I received a referral to Dan Zanon, who during the painful process I was to endure, became my shield, my voice of reason, and my clarity in the chaos.  My soon to be ex at the time did not make the process easy, he filed for nonsense petitions and worked really hard to stick me with debt while he fought to keep all the assets worth any value.  I tried many times to rationalize with him, and come to settlement terms that was fair and equitable to both parties.  Unfortunately, when you're in the middle of a divorce process, the words fair and equitable take on different meaning to one or both parties at times.  I had many moments where I felt like giving up and just giving into everything he wanted just so I can be done with it.  We share a child who at the time was 2 years of age, and my primary concern was ensuring he incurred little to no impact from the animosity that was brewing. \n \nDuring the entire process, Dan made me feel like I was the only client, even though all his clients know he's a very busy guy.  He listened to everything I shared with him,  and was not shy about letting me know when I needed to change direction or press on.  Dan prevented me from making rash decisions or taking defeat when there was no reason for defeat.  He wasn't the type of attorney that only cared about the money he would make. Dan really helped me by trying to do what he needed to  and have me share in the load to handle things that were minor that would save me money.  He had my best interest in mind throughout the entire process.  Even though it probably wasn't the best use of his time, he was a big help in mediating when the communication barriers were not allowing the two of us to progress with our divorce.  He sent letters to my husband and his office kept track of every correspondence and documented every situation that was pertinent for our case should we have to go to court.  There were many instances where I could have made the wrong decision had I not had Dan as my attorney.  His many years of experience reflected in his advice and through course of action laid out specifically for my case.  The best thing about an attorney like Dan is that he is not only well versed in his profession, but he is very human.  He makes it a point to really know his clients and makes it his personal mission to protect you during the entire process.   Sure it is not as costly to represent yourself, file your own petitions, and go to the mat alone after hours upon hours of tedious research.  But I knew that the only way I could get out of this marriage without having anything to regret later, is by having Dan on my side helping me make the best decision in my situation.  As a result, we had settled on joint parenting for our son, I was able to preserve my assets and take on only the debt that I should be accountable for.  It wasn't until 2013 that my divorce was finalized without having to go to court; but even after that dust had settled, Dan still stays in touch, and when I need his expert advice on a quick question, he is always there to help.  That kind of attorney-client relationship doesn't happen often.  My experience with Dan was great, and I am very thankful that he was on my side going up to bat for me as many times as I needed him to.  I would absolutely refer Dan to anyone who needs an attorney to represent them in anything relating to divorce and family law.  It is worth every penny spent to have the guidance and support during this process.  A lot of mistakes can be made when you try to take matters into your own hands.  To Dan and his staff at Zanon Law Offices, thank you for keeping me sane and having my best interest at heart every step of the way!", "business_id": "N1jurx1Ijhe4qmmU9ukgcw", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-02-25", "type": "review"}

My husband ordered a All American cheese burger with fries.\n\nSo the food came out promptly but the chicken was some thin piece of processed meat with this huge piece mozzarella cheese on it dry toasted bread with two slices of tomatoes and some dry lettuce.  My husbands burger came out dry as hell. He had to ask for mustard and mayo on the side. Terrible the waitress didn't let us know it was a dry dull burger with nothing but meat and bread. With shoestring fries the few that there were.  I then had to ask for ranch and pickles for the fakechicken sandwich. \n\nThe service was the worst I've seen in a long time. First of all the place was packed with basketball fans trying to make the start of the game. So I had to ask the hostess to take my watered down long island back and bring a bud light. Then I had to call the hostess to take the money so that we could pay and leave. She hardly checked on us outside and she knew we were sort of rushing to walk two blocks to see the beginning of the game. I only tipped $5 that was courtesy of my husband because I would have left like $2.

I explained after a trip all I had was a credit card and he went on to complain about how he was going to get paid less if I used credit.\n\nOkay, that's annoying but hardly the beginning of it. I live about 2 miles from the airport. The driver kept his meter covered by paper. When I asked why, he said I'd be paying $16, which was the minimum. I asked why the sign said the min. was 15, and he said if I was going to argue he'd leave me there at the side of the road...  Well, I wasn't arguing to begin with, but that was enough for me to shut up. I was a girl alone in a cab and pretty intimidated. \n\nI sent my friend a txt trying to explain my situation and he called back to keep me on the phone so I could continuously update him on my location in case the driver decided to be any crazier. Once I was at my destination I decided it would be best for the driver to drop me at the front of my complex so he wouldn't know exactly where I lived. He used a carbon copy device to get my card # and handed me the receipt to sign without giving my card back. I scribbled in a $2 tip worried that he was going to give me a hard time about giving me my card back or allowing me to access my suitcase in the trunk. The driver was completely intimidating the entire time and insisted I leave a phone number with him before he would return my card to me. \n\nWhen I got to my apt, I called the company to complain. The first person I spoke to was very understanding and apologetic for my experience. She took down my acct and said she'd put it through to the road supervisor who would have to do the follow-up. She promised the my information could stay anonymous from the driver upon my request.\n\nAbout an hour later, at nearly 10pm, the supervisor called and asked me to repeat the situation to him. He said he NOT able to keep my information anonymous. That he would deal with the driver tonight to hear his side of the \"story\".

I have had to see them twice (at the North Phoenix location - haven't been to the Central Phoenix location).  Once for a jacked up rotator cuff and the second time was for bursitis that I developed in BOTH hips.  \n\nThe first time I went in I was assessed and then given a range of exercises that I could do on my own.  I followed the plan as given and was able to rehab my shoulder without multiple visits.  Of course, if I couldn't have done it on my own I would have gone back but I was diligent in my own treatment.  I went from not being able to lift my arm wash my hair or take off my bra without odd contortions (yeah, picture that for a minute) to good as new within about two months of diligent work.  Had I not gone it when I did, I very well could have done more damage and may have had to have surgery.\n\nThe second time, with the bursitis, took more work and multiple sessions for treatment and exercises.  When I went in I could barely walk and ANY impact (such as getting out of a truck) would about put me on the ground.  As an avid fitness instructor and runner, this obviously wasn't good.  I felt as if both hips had been struck with a hammer!  No joke...the bones themselves felt bruised.  I didn't want to make a separate appointment for a regular physical who was likely only going to prescribe me PT, so I made an appointment.  I went in for an assessment, where it was determined that I likely had bursitis, and was started on a range of treatments.  I'm not going to say that the manipulation was comfortable.  It wasn't...and some days I wanted to come off the bench BUT it was needed and I firmly believed that it contributed to my healing and rehabilitation process.  I had multiple sessions and I was taught exercises and stretches that I could incorporate into my workouts and do at home to help my rehabilitation process.  And, it worked!  I didn't have to go in for injections or surgery.  I firmly believe that had I not got in, I would have ended up a lot worse and would have had to endure far more painful experiences than a little manipulation to stretch the muscles.\n\nLong story short:  I found the team at ASPT very knowledge and helpful to me not once, but twice, and BOTH times they mixed me right up.

Hotel San Carlos had sweet rates, so this was the spot. \n\nBefore coming here I knew nothing about the history of it.. so I wasn't in it for the ghosts, although my wallet went missing, so could it be the spirit of Leone Jensen that was to blame? I will never know. I ended up getting the King Suite, for the same price as a regular room. Blame it on my abilities to get whatever the hell I want is up to you, but the guy at the front desk was more than happy to upgrade. Score.\n\nOnce inside the room, I was taken aback by the beautiful crown molding, Victorian decor, original radiators heating the room, vintage bed canopy and of course, the antiques that were scattered about. It reminded me of one of my old apartments in Boston, plenty of history to give me that sweet sweet feeling of being back in New England. This was what I dug most. I am not sure how big a normal room is, but the King Suite was pretty spacious. A loaded bar, with stools and all, living room area with a pull out couch, tv and footrests,  an armoir for hanging my clothes, which I didn't use obviously..  I snooped through every nook because it was all so old and interesting and mostly because im nosey. The bed was friggin' huge.. assuming they named the room after the bed would not be totally out of the question. \n\nHere come the complaints...\nThe pillows.. my god, they were so hard and gigantic (that's what she said). I ended up having to use a throw pillow from the couch to rest my head comfortably for I am a small human being with a tiny neck.

Kennedy and one of my faves..  Clark Gable. How cool is that! \n\nCome to think of it.. I did hear the sound of little children talking and laughing as I was leaving that morning, which I blamed on something outside not knowing the story about it being built on the first schoolhouse in Phx and over some sacred wishing well?

The shrimp tacos certainly pitch in on this retention campaign as well. Let's go back to the snapper for a moment, shall we? This dish serves an ample portion of fresh snapper  in a near stew-like combination of jalapenos, onions, bay leaves and a rich tomato sauce. If that's not enough, you have the option to add shrimp. \n\nIf I'm not feeling like eating off the coast, the chicken mole is sure to get my vote. The mole here is so good that I get a little insulted when I see it on menus elsewhere. The chicken is pulled from the bone and seems stewed as it's very tender and juicy. \n\nService is always quick and friendly here. Decor is not the most inspiring here, but in Mexican restaurants I think that is a badge of honor. Folks of my pale pigment may pass on this place because it's location is rather industrial and low rent. That's fine by me, they can go to Macayo's and I'll take my usual booth under the spray painted swordfish.", "business_id": "BESmH-lmMm34_EefL8X9fQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-02-13", "type": "review"}

They also have a menu full of the fish and mariscos that anglos tend not to order in typical Gringo-Mex outlets. They also don't drown their entrees under an avalanche of yellow cheddar cheese.\n\nBut as an experience I would say even if it does offer a greater selection of authentic menu items, it's not really that much more satisfying than the other places. \n\nI had the carne asada tacos, which were serviceable if not thrilling. The dish came out warm and didn't have the tell-tale signs of having sat under the salamander for longer than it should. At one time these tacos would have been a revelation to anyone weaned on the Lawry's hard-shell ones. Now, with their soft, grilled dual corn tortilla goodness wrapping them, they resemble any number of other \"street tacos\" that have become more and more popular recently.\n\nThe atmosphere is . . . well. . . \"comedor\" means \"dining room\" in Spanish. That's what it is: A big room full of tables. Mariachis were a nice touch.\n\nWe waited 30 minutes at lunchtime on a Saturday to get a table. Maybe that's why I am less than thrilled.  The place doesn't want for popularity. Aside from the wait, I had no complaints with the service.\n\nSo to the uninitiated, I would go with an open mind, not expecting a life-changing experience. I would also advise people to try the things like the lengua molcajete (a sort of tongue stew served in a lava bowl). The availability of stuff like that is what really sets Comedor apart.\n\nAnd keep in mind that \"authentic\" doesn't always mean \"good\".", "business_id": "BESmH-lmMm34_EefL8X9fQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-02-26", "type": "review"}

I was surprised by how busy they were on a Sunday at lunch time- there were people crowded in front of the restaurant and they announced names over an intercom. Whoa. We were seated fairly quickly in the (extremely large) dining room and service was efficient from that point on. The chips and salsa were more like chips and hot sauce, but they tasted good... I love the spiciness of the sauce and put it on everything. When it came to ordering, we were a little disappointed. My friend is a vegetarian and thought Mexican food would be no problem, but our waitress didn't know of almost anything on the menu that was vegetarian (most items have lard).

It is good enough to eat as a meal if you are not sharing. Also the salsa that comes with the free chips is really spicy. I love spicy food and it made me grab a drink. It taste great, but dont grab a big scoop. I got the chicken burrito and the chicken was NOT soaked in that greasy seasoning like most place do. It was flavorful,  but not greasy. There is no other way to describe it beside saying it was really really good. The mango margarita is very tasty,  you can actually taste the mango flavoring. The dessert we had was the flan. I've eaten my share or flan and this is hands down the best flan I've even. It was different than any flan I've had at other restaurants. I will make sure I go out of my way to come here every time I visit. Don't like the outside fool you.  If you are coming from its back side, it looks like an run down warehouse.

I wish the lightrail went to your doorstep so I could visit you more often!! This is my vote for best Mexican food in the city. Just north of the Salt River on Central Avenue, in what looks like a failing industrial part of the city just seconds south of Downtown Phoenix is this amazing, beautiful gem of a mexican restaurant. \n\nWith a large parking lot that is oftentimes full to the max, it can be a bit of a wait during peak eating hours. My best advice is to come during the off hours. I like 2PM on a saturday best. Everyone is bright and happy and the drinks are flowing (yes at 2PM, don't judge me!) and the salsa is SCORCHING hot! and the chips are yummy and the Beans N Chorizo Dip is incredible! If the salsa is too hot, ask for the mild and/or sour cream. The mild has no heat at all but is still flavorful and you can add as much of the hotter sauce to match your taste. It's delish. I like to order the plate that comes with green chilie relleno and a beef taco w/rice & Beans. My fave! \n\nThis is a good place for large parties, as most tables can accommodate 6 people. and some tables in the back can host even more than that. I've totally seen like 3 birthday parties going on at the same time back there! it was awesome! I scored some free cake! LOL! \n\nThe service is top notch with a super nice general manager who always manages to come by and say hi. I'm starting to think she recognizes me.

It was so messy and dripping with every salsa known to man that is offered at the salsa bar. It didn't taste like greasy chemicals \u00e0 la any-berto's. The place is clean and cheap. The veggie burrito is really good too and everything comes with chips. The murals stretched on the walls make you feel like you're on vacation. And if I ever went on vacation, \nI would miss Chico's! \nMi amor! \nTry it! \nPor favor!", "business_id": "D09yG6Z3gcsh24Qn7Y4gYA", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-02-22", "type": "review"}

From the looks of it, one would expect a dingy little hole in the wall, but it's actually very clean inside. I secretly did a happy dance when I saw shakers of Japanese chili powder and black sesame seeds on each table.. two of my favorite condiments! \n\nAs we approached the counter, we were greeted by a cheerful and helpful lady, whom I later deduced is the owner's daughter. My friend asked which dishes were the most popular and she said, \"chicken teriyaki, panko chicken, pork katsu and chicken curry.\" I ordered the (dark meat) chicken teriyaki combo (comes w/ rice & salad) since that was my craving at the time and the BFF ordered 1/2 chicken 1/2 beef teriyaki combo (it's not on the menu, but the lady was nice enough to accomodate the request). \n\nOur heaping plates arrived a few minutes later and we hungrily dug in. After the first bite, I realized I was kind of disappointed by the chicken teriyaki because the meat was very dry and it was heavily marinated in sauce. I think they gave me white meat, but we were short on time and the lady was busy serving others so I didn't bother asking. The BFF enjoyed his beef & chicken combo which doesn't surprise me since he's very easy to please when it comes to food.  \n\nI ate a few more bites so I wouldn't starve during the game and packed up the rest for the BFF to take home. Oh yeah, the salad was OK. Nothing special about it, but I should have figured it wouldn't be since it was only an additional $.80 from a regular teriyaki bowl. \n\nThe lady working was not only very nice & helpful when we ordered, but she also went above and beyond what one would expect from a fast food type place. She asked us once or twice if we're doing OK, asked if we needed more rice and as we were about to toss our plates, she offered to do it for us. I also noticed she was just as friendly to the other patrons.. even offered a guy a sample of the chicken teriyaki because he didn't know what to order. \n\nI'd really rate the food at 3 stars, but added an extra for the super nice lady.

Coworkers have commented to me that the other chicken dishes are not to their liking, so perhaps this is a weak point for them.  \n\nYour best bet is to pick the food up to go as the inside is very small (and not aesthetically pleasing) and the place gets quite busy during lunch time. The food here is decent and the food reasonably cheap so we keep going back, but it's not really high on my list of preferred Asian places. \n\nP.S. This place seems to attract a lot of Phoenix's redneck population (though I don't know why), so just be prepared if that sort of thing puts you off!", "business_id": "kaIue7GRCmkPzDeHDBTttQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-12-30", "type": "review"}

And all the places I've never been to but have been wanting to go to for ages were either closed or greens free-- LoLo's (collard don't count), Palatte, Cheuvront, Cibo, My Florist, and so on.\n\nSo Moms decided that Coach and Willie's was the perfect luncheon destination.\n\n(Cuz they thought the salads online looked purdy tasty, and they were right. But I shouldn't have \"judged a book by its cover,\" since even McDonald's looks pretty good in commercials.)\n\nSo I swing by to pick up my sis and we dash to Coach and Willie's. I thought the name sounded like a bastard love filly to a Pony Express stud. Or maybe some purebred dog name, like Sir Charles McWigglesworth.\n\nEasy to find. Parking was plentiful. Patio was neato. Sunken bar seemed like a novelty. Horseshoe shaped booths were comfy and inviting. Atmosphere was upscaley for a sports bar. Company was vivacious. Waitress was engaging and attentive. Bacon wrapped prawns were succulent and satisfying. My Woodchuck cider was tasting crisp and peary. And I had a big ole smile on my face.\n\nIt was salad time. \n\nNow if a salad costs ten dollars, I expect more than a tasteless expanse of iceburg lettuce. What head chef uses iceburg lettuce any more? With all the varieties of salad greens to chose from, I end up with the tasteless, tacky trailer trash of the field greens world? I'm not saying you gotta get all pretentious with a salad by using micro greens grown in an organic hot house, but for fuck sake, iceburg? Airplanes and cafeterias are the only places I've ever encountered iceburg not in fancy pants wedge salad form, which classes it up some and acknowledges the fact that iceburg is tasteless filler devoid of nutrients of any sort.\n\nIs Coach and Willie's food comparable to airplane fare? Ahem, yes. My salad was anyway. Everyone else seemed to enjoy theirs, despite the offensive iceburg. I just ate the equally tasteless southwestern chicken mass that came on top and picked around the lettuce filler. So while the lunch was fun and the bacon wrapped prawns were rockin', the salad sucked. And since I've only been here once, they get a less than stellar review. (And I'm stating that straight up so nobody gets all persnickety. I've only been once. For lunch. And a crap salad.)\n\nI'm sure it's a fun place for drinks before a game or for a quick lunch with coworkers, but I'm taking a stand against iceburg lettuce. It should be eliminated on principle alone. (Aside from its uses as filler; see Navajo tacos and garnish.)\n\nAnybody want to join my one woman campaign?", "business_id": "j8nyAaN_w5t6wYv-ni23sg", "stars": 2, "date": "2008-01-24", "type": "review"}

I ended up here almost every Sunday during the NFL season to watch their Season Ticket, because lo, i couldn't get DirecTV in my downtown building because i'm facing the wrong f'ing direction.\n\nUgh.\n\nSo, C&W's gladly hosted me, and honestly, i found this little place welcoming and appropriate for my Sunday Vince Young worship.\n\nThe food is average to slightly-above-average.  Their pizzas are just OK, though they are wood fired.  Their ingredients are bland.  Same for the salads -- pretty average and I just have an aversion to iceberg.  But their wings are mighty tasty and large ...  and $5 on Sundays!  They are obviously frozen, and their sauce come to find out isn't even made in-house, but whatever, I'm here for football and beer.\n\nAs for those two things, C&W's is ace.  They have plenty of screens and lots of positions around the bar for viewing multiple games.  Every time I asked the manager to switch to the Titans game, he always obliged, even asking where i preferred to sit so he could change the appropriate TV.  Very nice touch.\n\nThe beers are large and VERY cheap ... $2.50 for a 20oz (i think 20oz) Bud Light and they have some other interesting beer choices if you want more.  For me, Bud Light is good enough for a cheap Sunday, beer-watching event.  Oh, and their Bloody Marys are on special too and very tasty.\n\nI would definitely recommend coming here for a sports-watching gathering or for pre-game festivities in the downtown area.", "business_id": "j8nyAaN_w5t6wYv-ni23sg", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-01-24", "type": "review"}

Coach and Willie are just the other side of the tracks and we've all eaten there a lot.  I can't rave about it... but not gonna bash it either.\n\nToday went with two vendors who hadn't eaten there yet.  we got a very pleasant surprise when Dani (sp?) came to our table, sat down, and asked us if we needed help picking something (menu is imposingly large).  she was funny, helpful, and talked them through everything.  they settled on the Tequila Lime Chicken Wrap and the Bourbon Steak Wrap.  Bourbon Steak Wrap ordered a side of Lobster Bisque.  I went for the daily special Fried chicken over potatoes.\n\nFood came pretty quickly.  I'll get the Fried Chicken special out of the way right now.  It was fried chicken, but it was NOT special.  It was better than KFC but that's about it.  the potatoes were barely warm.  the gravy was forgettable.  bad choice on my part when Mrs White's is barely three blocks away, but come on guys, at least wave the food over the heat a little bit.\n\nMy dining companions both raved about their choices.  Tequila Lime \nChicken was reported as \"very tasty\".  He ate half and boxed up the rest for the trip home.  Bourbon Steak Wrap was described as \"a little too sweet\" but all in all enjoyable, also boxed up and taken home.   Lobster Bisque was reported to be lip smackin good, though I tried it once and thought it was a little Campbell's-esque.\n\nThis is a nice place, dark, lots of sports on TV, It fills a niche in this neighborhood that Cooperstown deserted long ago and Friday's Front Row never occupied... that is, decent pub fare for pregame/postgame.

After this visit -- we've had it. \n\nI'm not really high on the \"this happened when i went there one time so it must happen all the time\" style of user review. So, let me state that everything that happened on this visit has also happened during previous visits, yet never all at once. Fate, however, put it all together this time to deliver a really memorable fiasco. \n\nI don't know if Fate's policy is to have the hostess/host inform everyone waiting for a table that the wait is going to be fifteen minutes, but the math doesn't work out. The place is tiny. We waited forty minutes. The next group waited fifty-five minutes. The next few groups are probably still waiting, their once-vital bodies deteriorating into skeletons.\n\nThe server dropped off some menus, mentioned that she was going to bring us some water, and then vanished as if she were an illusionist's assistant. Again, Fate is tiny, so the trick was pretty difficult.\n\nAnyway, we ordered after she rematerialized (after the required fifteen minutes). Stuff arrived. It was the old joke -- \"the food here is terrible... and such small portions!\"\n\nI'll spare most of the hideous details, but one lowlight to share involved the sesame/shrimp/salad item. I'm hoping that the foul flavor and aroma was the result of some slightly-off fish sauce, rather than some slightly-off shrimp. Actually, why do I care? We felt lousy afterwards and dosed up on the twin antidotes of water and mouthwash. Our cat still wouldn't come near us. \n\nAnyway, I don't mean to imply that the owner and staff at Fate are malicious. The food isn't good enough, and the experience isn't good enough.

The staff is extremely nice, friendly and very accommodating, and the clientele are the same.  \n\nOn my first visit there I had the olive bowl (watch out for the olive pits!), the paprika turkey sandwich and their unique daily soup special-- chipotle salmon chowder.  The turkey sandwich was delicious and the soup was a bit spicy (duh, it had chipotle in it!) but very interesting, with flavors I've never experienced.  I ended the meal with a cafe mocha, and I must say what a way to end a meal.  This was the BEST mocha I've ever had (that is why I am giving this place 5 stars!!!)

Like many places in Phoenix, it is small with limited parking. However, there is ample street parking and from the looks of it, tables and chairs on a patio which my group would have been fine with had it not been a yucky day out. As soon as we walked in, I knew I was going to love Paisley Violin. The exposed brick walls, the random pieces for sale, a small bar, and posters for live music and movie nights all give Paisley Violin a cute atmosphere and vibe.\n\nWe had the pesto brie as an appetizer and I was shocked to learn that one of my dining companions had never had such a combination before! The bread had seasoning on it which gave the cheese and pesto a nice kick when all three combined in your mouth. The portion size was perfect for the four of us to share and left us plenty of room for our lunch. As my main meal, I had the Mediterranean eggwich which was tasty; however the only disappointing factor was that I had asked for no red onions and when my sandwich came out, it had red onions on it. Two of my other dining companions both had the BLT with a side of potato salad and they both were raving over the sandwich and potato salad when we left. As one of my coworkers said, the chipotle mayo took what would have been an ordinary BLT to another level. Drinks are served in plastic cups and remind me of the glasses my parents would have bought when we were kids. It was quirky and an interesting touch. If you order a soda, it comes out in an old fashioned bottle, so there are no free refills. That is fine with me because it actually limits how much I drink!\n\nOur bill was approximately $10-12 per person (before tip) which is pretty much on par with most places we frequent for lunch.

I recently ate here for the first time and, unfortunately, I can't say anything good about the food.  I ordered a chicken shwarma sandwich and expected a hot middle eastern sandwich filled with flavorful chicken sauteed with onions and spices and accompanied with crisp fresh veggies.  What I got was FAR from what I expected.  The pita bread was your typical crappy faux Wendy's style doughy flat bread 'pita', not a regular pita pocket.  Inside was some flavorless, cold, unseasoned chicken (and when I say flavorless I mean indistinguisable from a mouthful of cardboard).  They didn't even bother to put basic salt and pepper on this sorry meat.  The remainder of the sandwich consisted of raw zuchinni (WTF?!), chopped tomatoes, 3 leaves of romaine lettuce, and some bits of red onion.  None of the veggies had been dressed or seasoned.  Oh, there was also some hummus/tahini 'sauce' mixed in there (presumably for flavor), but I have never tasted anything so flavorless.  I imagine that wall spackle has more flavor and pizazz than this 'sauce'.  Come on Paisley, does your cook even TASTE what comes out of the kitchen?  Add some flavor to your food.  You could start with salt, fresh lemon juice, garlic, pepper, and high quality olive oil.

First, I really really hate when places just have pictures of sandwiches on the display board and provide absolutely zero written description. Oh, I see I'm just supposed to guess what is on that sandwich that has a picture in the most inconvenient spot in the whole freaking place. Wonderful. Second, the caesar salad is horrible. I took my first bite yesterday and instantly remembered why I swore I would never order another one from Paradise again. I managed to choke most of it down, but seriously what is wrong with their caesar dressing??? It has a very funny, and not in a good way, taste to it. Also the croutons are not very tasty either. Third, they completely use too much dressing on their salads. Excuse me, but can I have some lettuce to go with that dressing?? And finally, for a bakery, I don't particularly find the cookies and pastries I have tried to be all that amazing.

I reviewed the Canyon Caf\u00e9's menu and didn't care for it since it's more of a Fusion restaurant, not real Mexican food.  I told the hostess that I wanted more authentic food and she told me to try \"Mi Amigo's\" . I walked 100 feet to this place.

OKish; free chips and salsa - the chips were awesome, the salsa mediocre.  The worst disappointment was my main course - I ordered the Red Beef Tamales.  These are the worst tamales that I remember eating.  I can make them better myself at home!! And I am an awful cook!  I was joined by one of our flight attendants and he joined me at my table.  He pretty much reached the same concensus as I.  Sorry, but I really, really was looking forward to a nice, hot tasty Mexican meal.  I was in Arizona for crying out loud, not in North Dakota or Maine, where Mexican food may not be as widespread.   PLEASE get your menu and most importantly your ingredients in order!

First impression...this place makes a mean cheese enchilada. Like, GOOOOD. Their red gravy was probably the best I've ever had. Rice, delicious. Refried beans, amazing. Beef tacos...yuck. I can't help but think that the beef in these tacos tasted like dog food smells. It was more of a shredded beef...bland...and just had an overall odd taste. I only ate about 3/4 of a taco and called it a night. I'm used to well-seasoned ground beef tacos, and these were just bizarre, in my opinion. \n\nOverall, great place!

The girls and wings are hotter than most others in the country. \nOn a cross country trip 10 years ago I  rode with a friend who was infatuated with this place. There was only one in Mass at the time and he never went, so during our 6,000 mile trek we hit up about a dozen of these places. Some were good, some sucked, but the wings and girls at this downtown phx location made me decide to stay in az for a year. \nFood at this location just seems better than the ones up in the northeast. They seem to add alot more spice in order to keep up with the plethora of mexican restaurants in the area. So if you like your wings hot, you unfortunately gotta leave the bland northeast. \nBeer as long as you buy it by the pitcher is affordable, but if you come in during happy hour, expected to get nice and drunk while not going poor.\nAs far as the other reason to go to hooters:the girls, you're gonna love this place. Let's face it, all hooters waitress are conning you just like a stripper would at the club. Here it doesn't seem they are faking it that much. Besides that they are hot as hell! With over 100 days of 100 degree heat in the valley of the sun, your use to seeing alot of hot girls walking around with next to nothing on.

I remember coming here as a kid when it was called \"The Spaghetti Company\" and regarding it as a major treat. The restaurant is housed in what looks like somebody's house on the corner of Central and McDowell, (and I always thought it was.) The interior is cavernous and museum-like, with old Victorian-era photographs, bookshelves, hidden rooms, chandeliers, and antiques on the walls. There's even a trolley cable car in the middle of the place where you can sit in and eat. As a child, I thought this was the coolest place ever. My brother and I would even go off and \"explore\" the restaurant when we finished our meals.\n\nSo, this place definitely has nostalgia for me. I always thought it was a unique, special place and that the people that were in the photographs lived in there at one point and now probably haunted the restaurant from the hidden upstairs level (how do you get up there?! There must be a hidden staircase somewhere...)\n\nBut then my young, naive little mind discovered the existence of a little thing called a \"chain restaurant.\" \"Wait, so you mean there's ANOTHER Spaghetti Factory? In Fresno?! I thought this was the only one? I thought it was a Phoenix thing?\" I wasn't sure what to make of that fact. I felt a little bit betrayed, as a matter of fact. Maybe it wasn't as magical and old as I thought. Regardless, the building it has occupied for the past twenty (thirty?) years has real charm and history, and I'm glad it's home to the Spaghetti Factory, and not a Cricket phone paycenter. \n\nThe food isn't really anything special. Honestly, it's rather forgettable. But then again, I was always more focused on finding the secret book that would open the trapdoor than on my lasagna. I haven't ever had a terrible experience with service or the food, but it's certainly nothing to rave about. I came here the other weekend with some friends and we had a good time; had nothing to complain about. The portions are rather small, however. \n\nNow that it's directly across from the lightrail maybe I will stop by if I'm in the area.

Rather than send it back I kept the salad. \n\nPerhaps I arrived close to a shift change, but there appeared to be 2 managers on duty, both stopping by the table multiple times to ask \"is everything fantastic?\" - the waiter stopped by several times as well and said \"Is everything excellent?\" I like to be checked on occasionally, but too much is annoying.  \n\nAnother annoying aspect was the food had been on the table about 10 minutes and still was 3/4 full, the waiter came back and asked if we needed boxes or were we still working on it? Um...yes, still working.  Maybe it was because it was 5:30 and the lobby was crowded with others waiting, but I hadn't been there that long - and three minutes later when he popped back over and asked again if we were finished, well you just earned yourself a small tip and a long guest because my show didn't start for another 90 minutes and I didn't have anything to do. Deal with it. \n\nFinally I allowed him to take the plates away and we were brought complementary spumoni - I have to say that was the best part of the entire meal. Afterwards I swung by the restroom and that was a charming experience.  Big open urinals - at least it wasn't like the old pee troughs some places used to have - but there it was - a full restroom of guys looking like a locker room. I didn't know my spaghetti came with sausage. Yuck.\n\nOverall - $31 for a hopefully soon forgettable dining experience.  The service from the waiter and the manager(s) was annoying and the meal average at best.  Some memories are best kept as that. I don't think I need to revisit this restaurant any time soon.", "business_id": "DlCtdbceo4YNSI53cCL2lg", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-02-21", "type": "review"}

Numerous trips to the library or art museum in Phoenix, followed by a trip to the this location.   In the early to mid 1980's I remember the Tempe location serving hungry college students 2 for 1 meal  specials on  Sunday afternoons.\n\nIn more recent years, this Phoenix location has been a family favorite, suitable for get-togethers, child friendly, centrally located.  \n\nA few years ago, I would be giving a 4 star rating. My most recent visits have Spaghetti Factory at a solid 3.  Why, you ask?  Well, I'm happy to share!\n\nKeep in mind the name of this restaurant:  SPAGHETTI Factory.  \n\nThe menu:  what was once an easy to navigate document is now overloaded with too many options.  Spaghetti is buried in the middle of the book.  \n\nLet's face it folks, spaghetti is cheap. Keep the menu simple, with its namesake food easy to find.  \n\nMore frustrating is the lunch structure.  For years one could get their favorite spaghetti and sauce combos in a smaller quantities, with drink and spumoni inclusive, for a reduced rate.  Now, lunch options are salads or sandwiches, with a pasta option offered as a note at the top.  No drink or spumoni option, unless you buy the dinner size.  Why???  \n\nThank goodness they've kept their pasta sauces the same.  You can't go wrong with any of them- one of my favorites is the spaghetti with half meat sauce and half brown butter mizithra cheese.  Sublime!  The mushroom sauce is another tempting choice.  My husband loves the clam sauce, and my kids are all over the board.  \n\nI like the addition of the option for steamed broccoli in large quantity- an excellent option for a large family gathering.  Salads are still crisp and cold, dressings still fresh, bread still warm and tasty.  I've ordered salad entrees, great quality and balance of flavors.  Really, no complaints about the food, but the food is not all there is to a good rating.\n\nCombine the lack of menu focus and lost menu options with consistantly (last 4 visits) slow food service, and we move from a 4 to a 3.  Servers are friendly enough, but it seems that everyone is moving in slow motion, save for a couple managers and long-term servers, scurrying about.  \n\nJust a little tightening up on service, plus a simplification of menu (bring back the lunch drink option), and I think we could hit the 4 star zone once again.", "business_id": "DlCtdbceo4YNSI53cCL2lg", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-01-07", "type": "review"}

We flagged down a manager and him and our server brought back with onions, but insisted that's how it's supposed to be. When leaving, we mention to a different manager (Stefan) and he totally agreed with us. There's a new menu coming, but still not excusable that what we got was definitely not BURGER sliders (no matter how much the other manager,server, and hostess was trying to convince us meatballs are basically the same thing!)

First I ordered a diet coke that was watered down. Cheap. The garlic cheese bread came back tasting like plastic, and left an after taste where possibly the oven they use gives that taste off.... we immediately told them about it they replaced it with another one (this one was garnished as opposed to the first one) and it tasted the same. Probably store bought.... my fiancee ordered the chicken paramagiana and I ordered spaghetti with meatballs and Italian sausage. His plate came back with this small piece of chicken to the side of his spaghetti. Flavorless and not worth the cost. Mine came back a mess. The meatballs, are definitely either not homemade and store bought or they over cooked it, and left it sitting for a while. When I cut into the meatball it was so hard to cut through, when I tasted it it was cold and again flavorless. A note worthy to the Head Chef: use seasoning on everything or change careers. The spaghetti was hard, not smooth tasting like they should be. The marinara sauce on everything we ordered was bland. It tasted like a can of tomatoes and that's it. No garnishes anywhere. The Italian sausage I was afraid to even bite into. When I did, it was cold and spit it right out. From the moment we got there, our host walked us to our table mentioning how they were \"surprisingly busy.\" I'm sure this may have been the case for the night, and the kitchen dropped the ball because they may have been overwhelmed or understaffed... Either way no excuse to serve what they served. I went and nicely told our server it was not her, we were actually pleased with her, but for our first time, it was horrible and we wouldn't return. Adam the manager then came out told us his apologies, went back to the kitchen, and found out they did overcook and let the food sit, so apparently from Adam's words he said they were afraid of being in trouble, which now they were all \"in trouble.\" Any ways, they only got a 2 star only because Adam and the server were nice and they ended up comping the entire bill except for $2 for the iced tea my fiancee ordered (which also sucked). We tipped her $10. Although he tried getting us to come back. I will never. First impressions are everything and YUCK. I would have preferred Burger King food over this place. Nothing amazing about Olive Garden but we should have gone to Bucca Di Beppo or Olive Garden.

I had been wanting to try this place but never really felt the need to go out of my way to make it happen. Needless to say I was invited for a group dinner and graciously obliged.  \n\nPresentation C: They are renovating right now, there were no signs coming into the parking lot indicating the entrance. We (of course) attempted to enter through the main entrance, only to be stop by a small piece of paper that said the entrance was the other end of the building. Ugh. Who likes to walk on gravel in 4'' heels? \n\nThe overall feel of the restaurant is very warm, the furniture and decor is all antique, resembles broken down shipping crates, antique lighting, but  still very well lit. Our group sat in a group dinning area behind the hostess stand so we got to see everyone that walked in, which was a little distracting. People were standing by our entrance waiting for their table, poor design.  \n\nStaff D+: \nHostess did not greet upon walking into the restuarant, after arriving to her stand we saw our group seated directly behind her and we sat ourselves.\n\nOur group had been seated for 15 minutes prior to our arrival, granted we were still waiting for others, 15 minutes in and no one at the table had drinks. Really? The waiter wasn't very friendly, his service was very poor. He would disappear for 10-15 between each action. Drink order.... 15 minutes till drink delivery. Drinks are delivered he disappeared again for another 10-15 minutes. He finally returns to take our food order food takes 20 minutes... we eat. We're done. He doesn't check on us at all during the process... 10 minutes after we are done eating he returns to take our ice cream order.... I think you get the point. I'm sure you're probably asking yourself,.... were they busy? No. At least it didn't look busy to me.\n\nFood C-: This part will be short and sweet. The food is mediocre at best, I can make it at home. I got the Chicken Parmigiana with Fettuccine Alfredo. The portion of food in comparison to the price, is small. It is not a lot of food at all.The taste was very bland for Italian I found myself adding salt. \n\nBest thing about the restaurant is the building and decor,i'm curious about the renovations. The staff needs to be more friendly and welcoming and they need to deliver a better experience for the customer. The food portions need to be increased by 20%.

When it came, I noticed it was on wheat bread. I checked the menu to be sure I had read correctly.  I alerted the waitress about the bread goof up and she said, \"Oh, we're all out of sourdough, but I  know you will like this\"  Really?   I would have ordered something else, as I don't care for wheat bread with a BLT.  And, the bread wasn't really browned or toasted much at all-kind of limp and fell apart.  The wine was good and reasonably priced, but the iced tea had that funny \"bag in the box taste\", not sure if it was brewed or not.  The bartender was very attentive and helpful. He noticed that hubby's Buffalo Chicken Salad was about to be delivered without Wing Sauce on the chicken, so he alerted the kitchen to run the chicken through the wing sauce.   Salad was good according to hubby.\n Not sure what is going on in the kitchen, but they caould stand to move it up a notch or two.\nSeemed like most people there were regulars who came in after work for a drink and dinner.", "business_id": "2I666dqzs1XB6xigIKa9bA", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-01-03", "type": "review"}

I like what they did with the place. The bar is nice with a marble top and some tables and chairs with more seating toward the back.\nThey have some good stuff on tap. I had two glasses of the Sam Adams season and some Onion Rings which came with some tasty sauces. My bartender was a very nice girl from Alaska who I think is called Vicki (sorry if I got it wrong). All of the staff there were very friendly. The Cuban sandwich is also apparently phenomenal because one lady at the bar would not shut up about how great it was.\nThe ONLY thing I would change is that the places is lit too damn brightly. They need to turn it down a notch because I think this place could become a cool post-work hangout and fun weekend place which we all know downtown desperately needs (if you build it, or in this case turn it down, they will come). They just need more intimate lighting because we all know the magic of lots of alcohol and low lighting (until the spell wears off the following morning but we cross that bridge when we get to it, don't we?)\nBut seriously, I like the place, they have my support, I will be back and I encourage all Yelpers to pop in and check it out.", "business_id": "2I666dqzs1XB6xigIKa9bA", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-01-08", "type": "review"}

Tom's looked appealing so we stopped in. We were both very hungry and the menu had some awesome looking offerings. \n\nFirst we ordered the Spinach artichoke dip, as this is one of our favorite appetizers and we like to try it wherever we go. What we didn't realize (which is admittedly our fault) is that it's got jalapeno cheese. The 2 horrible things about this dish were : #1 it's $9.50 and you get the tiniest little cup of dip...seriously...so teeny tiny!!!! Give me a break! And just a handful of stale chips. #2 Who puts jalapeno in spinach artichoke dip? At least SAY SO in the title...when you read \"Spinach Artichoke Dip\" you just assume that's what it will be. Who reads the description, anyway (still, I will take ownership of that part). It was so gross...we sent it back. \n\nThen the dinner salad. A small plate of iceberg lettuce and a few croutons. Really? \n\nThen the worst...the cheeseburger. I asked if their medium was still a bit pink inside and was assured that it was. I realize some places interpret medium rare and medium differently which is way I always clarify. Well, this wasn't even close. It was cooked WELL. It was over cooked to the point of a leather consistency. Also, it was so bland. No seasoning or anything. Our waiter asked if I wanted them to cook me another one but even if they got the meat temperature right it still would have been nasty with no taste, so I passed and just sent it back. \n\nI did eat the fries because I was hungry and it was the only edible thing I got (and not even that good). \n\nLastly...our waitress. She sucked. Never checked on us, seemed to not really care, and it wasn't busy so it's not like she was in the weeds or anything. Needless to say we won't be visiting ever again.

I was hoping this would be something we would remember with fond memories, but what we experienced was not that.\nWe arrived shortly after opening on January 6, 2015. I ordered a brisket sandwich and my wife pulled pork sandwich. We received our food in about twenty five minutes. After taking the first bite of my brisket sandwich I realized it was extremely tough. Ugh! I took a closer look and noticed that the meat was DRY and did not look good. I then cut the meat with a knife (hard to do) and tried just the meat. It was tough and had little taste. Certainly not what brisket should taste like and definitely the worst I had ever had... period. I thought okay this could just be a bad menu choice, but then I looked at my wife and after a bite of her pulled pork sandwich she removed the bun and started \"picking\" around with a fork. I asked her what was going on and she said no worries, it's okay. She is a very kind lady and would never complain, so I inquired further and she said the sandwich was almost all fat and quietly said nothing else. My wife is NOT a picky eater so this was to take note of. After some time I realized she just pushed the plate to the edge of the table and a server picked it up. What are the chances both our lunches were a fluke. Hence my review and know that I do this just to forewarn others and to say shame on you (management) for allowing \"food\" like this to be served.

Just little details that add to the horrible work they do. \n\nNeedles to say It looked like I ran it through a $3 car wash and only the outside was somewhat clean.

I like this business, it is close to me, they have good deals on their higher end washes/services and it is hand wash. The only thing that I have been noticing is the inconsistency of the actual work and washes each time. I have two vehicles that I bring on a consistent basis. Sometimes I leave so satisfied and feeling good about the wash, sometimes not so much. \nNot sure if there is a high turnover rate with them (inexperience) or if they just get lazy at times, or maybe just overlooking some things. This is the third time in the last couple months that they forget to add the scent and do a very poor job on the rims and Air drying. When I got back to work, I already noticed water spots, rims are still dirty (Very poor job) and no smell at all in my car. Usually I am very picky with my pickup since it is black and you can see everything on it so I usually have them re-do anything I am not satisfied with, but it has happened several times now with my car that I end up feeling bad for paying for a complete works wash when I got an average wash at best. My car is gray and not as noticeable so sometimes I do not notice until I get back home that the job was not very good. \nAgain, as of now, I will keep coming back for the convenience and customer service (Very nice staff) but please, please, keep an eye on the quality of the service. I always see a guy that seems like he \"ok's\" the service right before you pick it up. Maybe he needs to pay more attention to detail before they finish and return the vehicles. It's not good when the customer has to correct you and tell you how to do your job better.

I'm not sure if I would go back, just because of my food preferences, but others may love it. \n\nThey serve you on disposable plates and cups with plastic silverware, so it's a very simple restaurant. \n\nAnother person in my party got a chicken pita, but it looked like it was only a half pita stuffed with chicken. I personally would have wanted two halves, but I guess I eat a lot...\n\nWorth a try once if you like fresh food, pitas, veggies and kabobs. It's a good place to stop in to try something quick and new.\n\nOverall, good, but I prefer the restaurants around the area though- there is a Habit Burger, Five Guys, etc that I would prefer.", "business_id": "trAvQPp7gps0Btk-2AmLpw", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-02-19", "type": "review"}

I drive past it all the time on the way to work and have long thought it would be convenient to do business at this location. The hours on the door indicated they were open until 5:30 and I arrived right at 5pm. The branch was empty with the exception of a few employees. I was greeted by one of the tellers. I explained my desire to apply for a loan and was directed to a young man named Anthony. \n\nAnthony could barely muster a friendly attitude. He was visibly annoyed to have to deal with me so close to branch closing hours. Immediately realizing his frustration I apologized for coming in so late and explained that I (like most people) have to work until at least 5pm but was able to get away a few minutes early to take care of some business.\n\nOne benefit to his eagerness to be done with me is that he flew through the process.

They needed some additional information which I was happy to provide. I'm not sure what it is about the folks at this Credit Union but again I got a huge amount of attitude.

Very good customer service. Everyone greeted us with a smile and we were helped quickly. We went in on a Saturday--all branches are open on Sats 9-1, which is very convenient. We opened a few accounts and applied for a loan. A few days later, the account manager called to tell us the loan was approved. Easy. \n\nSo many credit unions and banks tell you they have free checking and then put conditions on you getting it free. Here--there are no conditions. It's just free. Their other fees and rates are comparable and in many cases better than other credit unions in the valley including Arizona Federal and Desert Schools. They have a drive through location at this location. They've also recently added e-banking and online bill pay. They don't have mobile deposit yet.\n\nWe switched from Arizona Federal Credit Union. Two years ago, AZ Federal started charging membership fees which I can only describe as very un-credit-union-like. What's worse is that they spend $ on ridiculous tchotchkes and promotions. I am not interested in paying more fees so I can have a pencil or a chip clip or a iPhone stand with the bank's name on it!!! I'm interested in banks lowering my fees, expanding hours, making e-banking easier, and giving me a decent rate. That is what SunWest is obviously spending their money on.\n\nWe were not given any cheap plastic crap for becoming members and they just put our account info in an envelope...not a fancy color folder that requires expensive printing services.

Location is easy to find. There is street parking and I didn't get the feeling my life was in danger (even though somebody once told me that it was extremely dangerous for a girl to be out by herself in that 'hood and at that venue). A bum did stop along the sidewalk and ask for some spare change, but he wasn't a creepy bum (you know what I'm talking about). \n\nI chose for my first visit to The Brickhouse to be during a Beat Battle event. Granted, I wasn't sure what I was getting myself into, but that was part of the draw. Rap? Turntablism? Beat Boys? I just had to know. \n\nI dragged a friend along with me. He seemed like a willing enough victim, though. \n\nCover was $10, which isn't bad for any sort of musical event. Crowd was cool - plenty of unique individuals to rest your eyes upon. I enjoyed how this particular show brought out some pretty artsy-lookin' and jam-jivin' folks. I can hang with these peeps, I thought. I actually did enjoy the Beat Battle, for it was something new. Nothing like a new experience at a new venue to make one helluva memory. \n\nOnly downside was that the beer selection was lacking. I wanted something seasonal, yet they didn't offer any sort of winter lager or ales. Bummer. I settled for a Kiltlifter to start off with, followed by a Newcastle.  Plus, there's a kitchen for people who have the munchies. They offered a drink, fries and burger for $5. Now that's a bargain.\n\nOh, and let's touch upon the bathroom, shall we. Ladies Room, my arse. More like a \"Enter at Your Own Risk Waste Disposal.\" I mean, seriously. Door 1: the lock didn't align; therefore, the door didn't lock. Door 2: 1/2 the seat lid was broken off and missing. Door 3: Out of Service note. Door 4: The large stall with the big door that wasn't quite big enough to meet the stall column; therefore, it just swing wide open the other way.  Can you guess which stall I chose?  \n\nBut, c'mon, I admit it: I like this venue. I don't always need or want pristine, perfect or even pleasant. In fact, I am thinking my review will change and a 4th star may find its way into my rating if I go back here to see a band of my liking. I missed the Okkervil River show here, and I'll never forgive myself for that. \n\nOf course, this is definitely not a 5 star venue - unless, of course, there's the exception to the rule: no cover, better beer selection and Harry Connick Jr. on stage.

(Legenary burger, fries, and soft drink) The only positive is that the food was alright. It was good for the $4 I paid, but not the $15+tax and tip it was normally.\n\nThe cons:\n- The customer service was laughable. Our waiter come up to my guest and I, who both had empty drinks at the time, and said \"Good? Good?\" with thumbs up. My guest asked for a refill and specified that I needed one, too. Later in the meal when both of our drinks were totally empty again, I asked for a refill. He only brought one for me, so my guest and I shared my drink. He clearly couldn't care less. \n- The burger was dry, like it was previously frozen. It definitely didn't taste fresh.\n- The veggies on the side to put on the burger weren't crisp. I usually like lettuce on my burger, but not their wilted lettuce.\n- The fries weren't seasoned and they weren't anything special. I'd compare them to Wendy's fries. \n- The music videos they play are awful. For being the Hard Rock Cafe you'd think that they'd play some well known rock stuff. ...nope... my guest and I were there for almost two hours and there was only one song we recognized. While I'm not a music expert, my guest is. To top it off, their bad music is so loud that you have to yell to talk to someone across the table.

This is a great place to go if you are going to attend a concert or basketball game at the US Airways center (directly across the street) or Chase Field where the Diamondback's play. Overall, it has a pretty neat atmosphere with everything being music related. Lot's of guitars and gold records along with pictures cover most of the walls. be prepared, it is very loud in there. Music videos will be playing. This does not bother me, but you may have to raise your voice to be heard.  Now, onto he food. My wife and I had already eaten, so we ordered an appetizer of chicken lettuce wraps. Nothing to complain about. Eveything was fresh and the layout of the food was appealing. Ordered and iced tea that was better then most places. We also had a great waiter...don't recall his name though.

OK, I'll stop there - but I LOVED the Phoenix Convention Center!\n\nWith a swell new renovation, its gorgeous in contemporary rust and sand and other deswet appropriate colors (god, I'm glad Arizona finally got away from the \"sunset\" color scheme of pink, purple, orange - blech!) and fancy tile entryway. It's clean, modern and has TONS of windows and open space. When you enter the West Building from Second St (the entrance by Starbucks), you're sort of swept up, up, up to the sky, and it really makes a statement (the entire entryway/first floor is open all the way to the top).\n\nThe seminar rooms have all the hi-tech gadgets needed for presentations, and the AV/Tech guys were professional and prompt if there was a problem - and, might I add, some of the most well-dressed techies I've ever encountered. No band T-shirts, visible tattoos or bears* here, man, it was all long-sleeved button-down shirts and dress pants; impressive!\n\nMy favorite part? Wicked-comfy chairs in the rooms. No hard plastic and metal legs, no cumbersome, heavy, office-gray uncomfortable torture devices. The chairs were super sleek - those mesh-back, rolling office-desk chairs you always see in design studios and architecture offices. By the way, did I mention the backs *recline*. I'm totally serious. I'm a super antsy chair sitter - I sit up, I slide down, I cross, re-cross, pull my legs up Indian-style, under me, I turn (doubly insulting to speakers if the chairs are squeaky)... I can never sit still in an office chair, but these bad boys made me feel like a grown up finally as I could sit quietly for a full hour.\n\nBathrooms were incredibly nice - large-tiled floors that were actually clean, small-tiled sink backsplash in contemporary colors, soap AND paper towels in full supply AND the automatic water faucets ACTUALLY all worked! It's a convention center miracle! A full-length mirror for making sure your conference appropriate attire looks as nice as you thought it did at 5 this morning. Nice, floor to ceiling, all-glass (frosted) doors with the long bar, brushed steel handle (what can I say? I'm a sucker for a cool bathroom, just read any of my reviews)\n\nWhat else.. it's right off the light rail, of course. I found the entrance easily, no wandering around an entire city block looking for the right door. Up on the third floor, the windows provide a great view of the city streets - p.s. what's with the towering TMobile ad painted right on the Bank of America building?? Oh yes, super hi-tech looking TV screens outside each room that display in color the current and upcoming sessions - helpful, because it never fails that someone moves or changes the signs and you're left wondering if you're in the right place. \n\nAlso, I liked that the convention center chose to work with a caterer who uses compostable plastic cups made from corn...say what?? And they have recycle cans alongside regular trash cans for all those empty water bottles.\n\nOK, the one thing this place does have in common with other convention centers is that it is FREEZING. Of course, that is to be expected no matter where you travel.\n\n**This is actually supposed to be \"beards\" but for the record there were no bears either", "business_id": "F6BedoYgbAQHqwKX9F0zDQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-02-18", "type": "review"}

The rooms are spacious and it's easy to get up and down floors. The design is nice with easy access to the stairs and escalators and they have the exit-only designs that are conveniently located. It may not be the greatest endorsement when I say that the convention center can be quickly exited, but I appreciated these benefits.\n\nThe Rock N Roll expo was also reasonable: they have a similar set up at all their races and the number and scope of vendors is impressive. Now, I've always considered these things the equivalent of runners' porn and typically try to get out as quickly as possible. It only takes a momentary distraction to have you stop in front of a stall and decide that you must have the new Saucony socks (\"But these are ULTRA wicking!\")\n\nI've taken the Jason Bourne in an embassy in Switzerland approach: when you walk in the entrance, you put your earpiece in, rip the diagram of the building off the wall, analyze the quickest route between the points you need to go and then march. This typically works fairly well and you can navigate through the whole affair in a few minutes. Not too shabby.\n\nA friend of mine has a different philosophy. He claims that you want to take the more circuitous route through the hall since people tend to congregate in the center of the place. He probably has a point (although I'll never admit that to him): there's actually a hierarchy of vendors and the less desirable ones tend to get stuck along the back walls. When you navigate this path, the crowds are sparser and the vendors are listlessly standing next to stalls of \"Used Running Socks\" and \"Backwash Gatorade\". I tried this manuever at the Phoenix expo and found that I could exit the building a little faster.

Because I just can't stand  the lady who owns and runs it (and cooks your way-too-overpriced food). She's rude. I work in the building and have eaten there on many desperate occasions. The food is pricey (go to Schlotzky's across the street for better value). And it's really not that good. It tastes ok... nothing special at all though.\n\nShe's ALWAYS out of something I want, literally every single time I'm there (no potato salad, no bacon, no ham, no tomatoes). What sort of fresh breakfast/lunch place is out of tomatoes at 9 AM? I like ham on my breakfast burrito (comes with three choices: bacon, ham, or sausage). At 8 AM, how does one run out of both bacon and ham (the sausage is kind of odd, I can't eat it) on a regular basis?\n\nDespite me eating there for the past year on a somewhat consistent basis, paying cash every time, she still has to count EVERY last penny before she will even let me put my zingers in a bag.\n\nScenario: I see zingers I want, ask how much they are ($1), tell her I'm setting the money right here by the register, and since she's cooking, put 4 quarters neatly stacked right near the register (as she watches me and my 4 quarters like a hawk). Then, she finishes my burrito, puts it in a bag, and I go to put the zingers in the bag as well. BAD IDEA! No! Must go count all 4 quarters before they can even enter that bag to sit alongside the tiny $4 burrito I have already paid for! She honestly acts paranoid that people are trying to steal from her or jip her, even with her regular customers. It's no wonder the place is always empty. If you go, and see more than two other people in there at lunch time, consider it a miracle.\n\nAnd, it's not just me. I'm always polite, say please and thank you, smile. Never let on that I can't stand this woman at all. Everyone on my floor has the exact same thing to say and will only eat down there when they are really desperate and in a time crunch. Most of the people here would rather run across the street to Burger King (and most of the people around me make enough money to consider Burger King beneath them, so that actually says a lot.) Even more go to the 2700 Tower's little store (read below)... they are always busy (but you can still get in and out fast).\n\nThis past visit to Central Cafe, there was a small bowl of little chocolates sitting by the register, half empty. She hasn't had those before, and there was no sign on them to indicate any sort of price. My friend, assuming they were free, took a single one and ate it, to then be informed to cough up a quarter! My friend said \"oh, there's no sign. Everybody has these out for everyone.\" No... that did not fly. The lady had to have her quarter. I gave her two dimes and 5 pennies. And she counted every single last penny, slowly (we would not want to miss a penny, would we?)\n\nShe will probably know who I am after writing this review, but at this point, I really don't care. I have no intention of ever eating there again. I've decided I won't be that desperate again. I've come to the conclusion I'd rather not eat first.\n\nIf you want something super quick nearby, try the 2700 tower's little shop (right by the smoking area, next to the entrance to their parking garage), the next building north of our 2600/Central Cafe Tower. The Asians who run it are always very pleasant, also cook basics (think burger, hot dog, burrito, fresh sandwiches wrapped up, etc), and their prices are really reasonable for on-the-go food. They are more of a mini-Circle-K with a small corner where they make food (more diverse options than Central Cafe), all fresh and all pretty cheap for a downtown Phoenix office building shop. And they don't elaborately count every cent, stare at customers, and treat every patron with suspicion... in fact, they're liberal with the Leave-a-Penny-Take-a-Penny jar. More cramped store, but a much better place to grab something quick and not feel like a thief just for coming in!", "business_id": "sInUSy63Oh455uWs9p9OqQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-12-23", "type": "review"}

Try it.  It's very nice.  \n\nCheryl T", "business_id": "sInUSy63Oh455uWs9p9OqQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-02-07", "type": "review"}

Dr. Drewitz  (and a few others) got pretty awesome reviews elsewhere online and was a peer-voted TOP DOC in the Phoenix Magazine. While that's not the patients voting, Yelpers, I suggest you do your own research. \n\nNote: I will update my review if I need to go back.\n\nNow to my experience. I called with digestive stress thinking it was a pretty serious episode that I was having. They got me in quickly but with a young doctor that hadn't received very good online reviews. They were quick to assign this one to me and although i was leery, I decided to just give this guy the benefit of the doubt.\n\nAs another Yelper just before me mentioned, although I don't know if we had the same doc, the bedside manner was virtually non-existent. While he may just have a laid back personality, professionally, I prefer my docs to act like they give a shit.\n\nSo then after asking me a few perfunctory questions about my current symptoms, he does the \"stethoscope to the heart and back\" routine and sends me to a kind woman to schedule my CT scan at a local Imaging place. Again, they got me in pretty quickly.\n\nHere's where it went awry for me. I went in for the scan on a Friday and the CT techs said the drs. office would receive results in 2 to 3 bus. days. I called Digestive Health Center - Coronado in 4. They had the results but the dr. had to sign off so someone could tell me my results and hadn't. Meanwhile, I'm beginning to panic cause NO NEWS IS BAD NEWS when you're a patient with a condition.\n\nEIGHT BUSINESS DAYS LATER, I call back like WTF? The assistant was apologetic but noted he STILL hadn't signed off on my results. Now remember , that this is simply so they can tell me something IS or ISNT wrong with me. Jeez!!!!!\n\nSo I said I need another doctor then. An hour or two later another doctor calls back to tell me all is fine. For this frustrating episode, I receive a dang near $200 bill (after insurance pays their part and note how quickly THAT arrived vs. how slow the follow up was) and after paying $350 out of pocket for a CT scan. So $550 of my hard-earned- and- not- easily- come- by savings later, I am ok but seriously do not feel the service I received was worth it!", "business_id": "QC3osgPdEl_TEZA2CtNeQw", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-12-01", "type": "review"}

There are lots of places that do sadwiches.  I go to Jacquees for good Boar's Head meat, I go to Sticklers for the delicious fresh bread, and I go to D&D for the unique hot and signature sandwiches on their menu.

I think at one point back in the day, there used to be food places and a bar or 2 up there, but now its different.  The gardens here are pretty, relaxing and enjoyable.\n\nI think based off food and shopping alone, this place sux, overall.  For anything reasonable and quick to eat, your stuck with Subway and Cafe Roma.  Everything else is sit down with waiter service.  I don't have any one recomendation to make this place better, except maybe different/better choices in resturants and eating choices.", "business_id": "JIV4LF8KE8pAUnU28QAhIw", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-01-29", "type": "review"}

The price is right, the quality is pretty good if you go to one of the more experienced nail techs and I almost always get in without much of a wait. Also, since I am a \"regular\" they try to take care of me and get me in and out quickly when I need a pedicure over my lunchhour or between meetings. The ownership has changed hands in the past few years so I would disregard any review older than 2011. I frequented the store back then too though and would have never give the salon less than 3 stars. My only complaint would be that the nail tech turn-over is high and some folks are better than others. If you go often enough (like I do) you know who to get. Right now, I would highly recommend Jimmy (the bald guy) - he gives a fabulous gel manicure that looks beautiful and lasts easily for 2+ weeks.  He also does a nice job on acrylic nails. Rose, the woman who owns the place, is quite a character but she takes real pride of ownerwship in the salon. She is, however, a bit reckless with the pumice stone (scratches my soft skin) and digging for what she precieves as hang nails. Just ask her to be careful to stick to your callouses - and clip but don't dig - and she will be. She really does aim to please and wants you to come back.

As soon as we came in we all took our chairs and soaked our feet in a nice warm bath. They have a large selection of shellac gel polish and regular ones too! Everyone found one they liked immediately.  My sister went with the french tip for her wedding and it looked great! They had everyone's pedicures going and transitioned to manicures reasonably fast. We all had the massage chairs going while chatting it up. The staff was all nice, it was a bit out of the ordinary for some of the techs to be men in their 20's or early 30's who spoke perfect English, but they do a great job and made for easy conversation! Some of us were stupid and wore skinny jeans and boots but they had us covered with these disposable flip-flops! I was like wuuuuhhh? That's service!

It was on the heel of a discussion about mountain biking and camping. South Mountain. Camelback. San Francisco Peak. He liked it all. In fact, he liked to talk. He being the owner, I mean. \n\nMy friend and I arrived around 5:30 for dinner. We were greeted right away and shown a table. Our Kirin Lights shortly followed. The sushi menu offered nigiri, sashimi and their roll selection, which included one called \"Phoenix Suns.\" The owner soon embarked on striking up a conversation with us. His English was somewhat broken, though. I let my friend do the talking. I added, \"We'll trust you\" when it was decided that we'd let him pick a roll for us and put together a sashimi platter. \n\nWhile we waited, we sampled the miso soup and drank our beer. Soon, a brightly colored roll came to our table. \"Spicy Slim\" is what we were told it was. We had no idea what it was, until the owner came over later to chat some more. Crab on the inside, tuna on the outside - covered in spicy sauce. Well then. It was pretty tasty, especially with the coating (like small, white crunchy flakes). It got pretty spicy the more you ate. \n\nSoon the sashimi came. We had peppered and seared salmon (yum), extra white tuna, ahi tuna, yellow tail and salmon. Each piece was very good. The sizes were generous, too. The sahsmi came with two small dipping bowls, too. Sort of a mild spicy sauce, an alternative to soy. The sauce was a great complement to the meal. \n\nMy friend wanted more. Man, she can pack it away! So, we ordered some mackeral nigiri and a caterpillar roll. The mackerel was very good, although I thought the rice it laid on was a bit too sticky - hard to chew. The caterpillar roll was good, though. It was your basic eel meets avocado. The eel sauce was sweet without being overly sweet and overpowering the taste of the roll. \n\nOverall, a great meal! The service was also great - although a bit too attentive. Considering we were the only patrons (minus a couple sitting at the sushi bar), they were just waiting around to serve us. In fact, they tried to take our miso soups away twice before we were actually finished. \n\nAlso, there was the chattering - the owner striking up a conversation after we paid, when we are about to get up from our seats. First it was about basketball, since on the big screen I saw that it was about to be Bedlam (Oklahoma State vs. OU). Funny, considering I went to OSU and my friend is a big Sooners fan. I think the owner wanted to see us throw down. Who knows. In any case, basketball talk soon turned to travel (Hawaii was a hot topic) and the outdoors. We gradually weened the conversation to a flutter and left. \n\nAs we were pulling away, my friend said, \"Oh god, he's outside waving to us.\" It was true. He was outside, alright, bidding us adieu. Some may call that spectacular service. I think that was over doing it a bit much. Yet, what else had he to do? It seems the FBR had devoured most of his dinner patrons. Besides, he did admit that Ichi Ban is more of a hot lunch spot for the surrounding businesses. \n\nAs for the bill, it came to about $100. True, we did order some more expensive fish (like the white tuna), but it was not worth $50 a person. No way, no how. Especially since you felt like you stumbled upon an obscure shopping plaza and into a sushi diner, not a restaurant. (Case in point: They have a seperate counter to take orders for teriyaki rice bowls and the like.) The decor didn't so much bother me, though. It was the extra attention. I guess I just don't like being spoiled (that's one way to look at it). \n\nPlus, the owner is Korean. We know this because they were speaking to each other in another language, and my friend picked up on it. He was Korean alright. She should know.

(What I really wanted to do was to head over to Rose and Crown to meet with new acquaintances, but I didn't want to worry about parking...)  On the way, I spotted HBB on the left, but I kept going north for Fez.  However, it seemed like I'd never get there, so I gave myself a stopping point- if I hadn't reached Fez by the next light, I was going to turn around and interrogate the poor soul that happens to greet me at Honey Bear's.  \n\nThe poor soul's name was Rich, who informed me that HBB only has one sauce, and unfortunate for me, it contains *.  (I received the same response at the Glendale Chocolate Affaire, but I assumed the \"one sauce only\" was for convenience purposes.  See?  Never assume.)  He sold me on the fact that they marinate the meats in a spice and vinegar-based marinade.  Alright, I'll try a 1/2 pound (about $8 w/ tax) of pork (his fave) and beef (which the young man, who patiently waited behind me while I asked poor Rich so many questions, ordered after I stepped aside and considered my options).  No, wait, I'll have a full pound (about $15 w/ tax), and could you add chicken, too?  And bbq sauce on the side, please. \n\nWhile I waited for my take-out order, I asked Rich if I could sample the sweet potato pie, and to my surprise, he handed me a slice, told me to grab a spoon, and help myself!  It took only one teaspoonful of that slice for me to decide on purchasing a whole pie ($12) to go.  \n\nSo how did the meats taste w/o the bbq sauce?  The chicken was very bland and pretty dry.  The beef was not much better, but at least it had some mouth-feel.  The pork was the clear winner, esp. since its marinade had the added benefit of red pepper flakes.  Would I go back for more meat?  Unless HBB designs a non-* based-sauce, no.  Well, maybe for the pork.  And only if I was carrying a bottle of bbq sauce in my purse.\n\n1 star each for the pulled pork, sweet potato pie, and for Rich being such a sport.  (Kudos for letting me sample the pie!  Letting people sample is always good for business!).  \n\np.s.  If HB had a shack that only sold sweet potato pie, I'd give it 5 stars!\np.p.s.  Honey Bear BBQ, please add candied yams/sweet potatoes to your menu!  While you're at it, add some sweet potato fries, as well!\n\nAllergy update: I concluded that the sweet potato pie must contain * ingredients bec.

On a day that well, I wanted Quantity over Quality.... A point I will explore soon.\n\nUpon entering I had already referenced the other reviews of this location. Seemed about average so naturally i prepared myself to not be impressed.\n\nFirst things first.  The place was a bit of a mess (being gracious with my language). I understand it was at the end of their lunch rush but still... if your a staple of any city your image is very important so Tidy Up! Also there is nothing wrong with the idea of a remodel in certain areas like the bathroom and table area. \n\n*I almost always suggest an open kitchen for any eating establishment. I mean who wouldn't enjoy seeing my meats being cooked and smoked as I am contemplating my order at the register? right?\n\nPrice... a bit overpriced for the QUALITY I received and even the QUANTITY was not what I expected for what I paid.\n\nOrdered the Pork sandwich meal with Sweet potato fries. Pork was dry and burnt, flavorless too, which I'm sure is easy to get away with since anyone who is in there usually sloshes their sandwiches in that BBQ sauce... not good enough for me or most foodies I'm sure. The fries where and had been frozen obviously, ughh.... like really? and to top it off they were also bland (doused them in BBQ sauce just like my sandwich to try to save them)\n\nMy girlfriend and her mom had ordered the same thing. but with different sides. Her Mac n Cheese looked awfully fast food/michelina's of them. Also to top it off after being home for about an hour or so and even through the rest of the evening me and m'lady felt awfully sick (Not a surprise considering if you take a gander into the kitchen from the soda fountain it looks like quite a mess back there....)\n\nI will not be visiting again on my own account but also some people I lunch with are stuck in their ways. Id like to see a remodel, food quality improved to reflect proper pricing, CLEANLINESS (not just at my table when i have to clean it myself but in the KITCHEN) and well all those smiles people are saying they do not see there will come to the employees naturally. I see some obvious pride lost in the owners and employees alike.\n\nI never like to see a business fail. Especially one that has such a familiar name her in Phoenix.

I've also had it recommended to me by a few people previously. \n\nLocation: It's like any other place on Central- the location itself isn't that sketchy but everything around it is. The inside is a pretty standard Mom-and-Pop simple decor. Dining area was pretty clean and employees were walking around regularly to make sure it stayed that way. Trashcans had those annoying small-circle opening tops on them and made discarding your refuse without getting crud from previously discarded trash on your hands a task. Men's bathroom was cramped but clean. \n\nFood: I had the brisket, pulled pork, and Cowbro' beans. Brisket was alright; I've had better and I've had worse. It could've used a bit more smoking/more intense smoking but the sauce complemented it well. Pulled pork was good- about on par with any other decent pulled pork. It had a nice balance of flavor between the meat and smoke and was also complemented well by the sauce. The sauce is a low-viscosity variety with a great balance of sweet and spicy. The sweetness was just enough to draw out some extra meaty flavors in the brisket and pork without overpowering it. The spiciness was just enough to complement the other flavors, keep the taste-buds excited, but not too spicy by any means. The Cowbro' beans were actually pretty amazing. They seemed like a standard canned-base with other seasonings added, which made them taste infinitely better than canned. The beans also had chunks of smoked sausage in them, which I felt was a nice touch. The sausage had good flavor and a crisp casing. \n\nMy girlfriend had a pulled pork sandwich, ribs, and mac n' cheese. She thought the ribs were \"alright,\" a fairly standard rib. She enjoyed the mac n' cheese and was too full to touch the sandwich so it came home with us. \n\nMy friend had the chicken sandwich, mac n' cheese, and peach cobbler. She thought the chicken sandwich tasted good but was a little dry (and it did look a bit dry from across the table). She thought the mac n' cheese was alright but that she'd had much better. She enjoyed the cobbler but felt the filling was oddly watery and regretted not ordering it a la mode. \n\nStaff: Friendly, attentive. \n\nSummary: If I'm in the mood for barbecue, it will certainly be on my list of places to go to if I happen to be in the mood to drive to Central.", "business_id": "q1nDSpmV-FdTBNj6UuZvTg", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-02-22", "type": "review"}

Well, the manager, Dave, sat us at the bar and told Jeff, the bar man, to take care of us. He let us sample some wines before choosing our glasses, and they also were kind enough to throw in the cheese plate that the wine tasters were enjoying. Unfortunately they had run out of the fontina during the official tasting, so we ended up with a more expensive and very tasty cheese.\nI enjoyed the Titus Zinfandel, Hubster ordered a dessert white, and Weinski got a Chardonnay before sampling the 3 Olives well vodka. He might have a headache later on.\nThe ambiance was nice. A simple place in a great location, Cheuvront serves up a nice vino.

Or if you're like me and have an unending love of different cheeses, you're good too.  In the emerging downtown Phoenix nightlife scene, this place may be the crown jewel.\n\nA disclaimer for starters.  I'm friends with one of the waitresses there.  She was the one who pretty much roped me into this place.  I let her pick the cheeses for me as a first timer.  There's no way to try out all of them (there's about three dozen different kinds to choose from), so I got a plate of Parmiagiano Reggiano, Carmody, and Mimolette.  I happen to be a red wine guy so these selections went perfectly with a Syrah.  The wine and cheese menus recommend wine and cheese combinations for you if you're not familiar with different styles.  The waiters there are also very knowledgable about what wine and cheese combos work best.  They always serve the cheeses with some crackers, nuts and fruit to go with it.  You can buy a helping of cheese to take home too if you want.\n\nThe restaurant itself is pretty modern with a comfortable low key industrial feel to it.  It's situated at the bottom floor of a condo complex and just steps away from the main Phoenix library and Hance Park.  They've got a couch area in the back of the restaurant if you want to lounge with a group of friends.  You can also get a patio seat right along Central Ave.   Now that the light rail is up and running, my sense is that this place is going to see ALOT more business as word continues to spread about this place.\n\nNow if you're not huge into wine and cheese, they do have a full lunch and dinner menu.  I haven't tried any of their lunch or dinner items and they are a little pricey.  Although if other Yelpers are any indication, they're probably worth a shot and I'll probably give one of those entrees a go next time I'm there.\n\nIt goes without saying that downtown Phoenix isn't the first area of town that most people think of when they think of hangout spots and eateries.  It's still not quite there yet, but with places like Cheuvront's and other unique spots opening nearby, it shouldn't be long before a regular stream of urban crawlers start filling up places like this on a regular basis.

The bleu cheese mac-n-cheese was our favorite, the shrimp & traditional were just so-so, and the other varieties were pretty good.

If I had stuck with that I might have had a very different experience.  Unfortunately, I tried to range farther afield and came away feeling like everything except the wine and cheese came from Costco.\nCheuvront gets predictably high marks for the range of the wine list and the varieties of cheeses--if Wallace and Gromit decided to move to the desert and become social drinkers, here is where they would do it.  I took the menu's advice and paired a Queso Iberico cheese plate with a pinot noir (Cartlidge & Browne '07) and liked both very much.  Actually, I liked the cheese.  The rest of the \"plate\"--almonds, dried cranberries, and a few grapes in their twilight years--evoked no real response at all.  My accomplice in dining chose the Pascual Toso Malbec '07 (accurately described as a full-bodied red) and summer salad.  The wine was great--complex and dry without being acerbic--but the salad tasted like the chef had just given two weeks' notice.  The chicken was bland, the \"mixed field greens\" had clearly just come out of a bag, and the roasted shallot white balsamic vinaigrette was the middle school marching band of dressings: yes, I recognized what was being attempted but still felt bullied by it.  The pumpkin bread pudding was good, but not worth making a trip for.  The latte and cappuccino were fine, but here's a tip for the kitchen: if you want coffee to stay hot, warm the cup first.  By the time our friendly-yet-overwhelmed server came back with the cinnamon, the drinks were lukewarm.  \nSpeaking of service, let's not.  We got menus, we got food, we got the bill.  We also waited a lot, heard several rationalizations for said waiting times, and had to repeat requests.  We spent two hours for a snack-sized meal that required no cooking except for the bread pudding that had obviously been made much earlier.\nIf I could send one message to Mr. Cheuvront, it would be this: It doesn't require any particular talent to sell good wine and good cheese at above-average prices.  It does, however, require talent and skill and desire to create an experience that keeps folks coming back.  If I want to drink good wine in a mediocre setting, I'll buy a bottle at AJ's and smuggle it into Denny's.", "business_id": "muCl5p-9ut1sY0aKeUeRhw", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-02-24", "type": "review"}

I know better than that - I only hang with Kristi at dive bars. \n\nSo I did take my lovely date to Cheuvronts. The decor and ambiance - think wide open and urban and dark without being too dark.

I have been meaning to go for ages and finally a group of friends wanted to go out of dinner, two of them which now live downtown, and I recommended Cheuvront. A half hour ride from the Mill Avenue stop and I was there. \n\nA bit chilly to sit outside but looks like excellent outdoor seating. The seating is well spaced with wine storage along the back wall and a well stocked bar in the middle (God and I both love a well-stocked bar, or at least I always say \"Thank God, they have a bar). The wait staff was cordial without being too personal (I look at dining as I'm out to eat dinner with friends, not really out to make new friends, at least until I have a few drinks but that is whole different situation....ahem). \n\nI started out the evening with a basic mojito made with 10 cane rum. A little too much sugar syrup for my taste and could use more lime but wow, served in a full size glass and a kick like a mule. One of my fellow diners had the white sangria with fresh basil and wow, that was a keeper. I'm definitely having that next time. \n\nThey have a huge selection of cheeses from around the world and we ordered the three cheese appetizer plate (the waiter asked if I wanted to pick but was happy to pick a selection for us, and I love to delegate) and the pork empanadas with orange marmalade. The cheese was good and I noticed they also have another book where you can order wine and they just pair it with cheese, how cool! The empanadas, to die for, I will order that again, ideally along with that sangria with fresh basil. \n\nDinner was the duck breast rubbed with coffee and ancho chili pepper and served on top of I don't know what but it had a crispy grilled crust on the outside and it was nice and cheesy (seemed like some sort of rice and cheese mix) on the inside, and it was wonderfully presented. I actually had the recommended wine pairing and wow, it went so well together. A rich red wine that offset the spice rub on the duck breast perfectly. \n\nWe ended the evening with coffee and desert. The coffee was okay but they should consider serving coffee roasted at the Cartel coffee lab in Tempe (which I love) as the coffee here was just...coffee...which was a shame when the rest of the meal was so great. Ideally they should bring everyone an individual french press so they can let the coffee get as strong as they like to drink it. I would also recommend a thicker cream, even whipping cream (unwhipped) since it provides that sense of luxury that goes well with this place (I had that at Mucho-Gusto and became an instant fan). \n\nFor those of the more intellectual persuasion, I noticed this place is in walking distance of the main Phoenix library. So you can go pick out a good book on a lazy Sunday and then walk over to Cheuvront for some wine and cheese and feel like the perfect elitist, before you ride the light rail home (okay, this is my ideal lazy Sunday and I've always dreamed of being just a little bit of an elitist - I'm not perfect).", "business_id": "muCl5p-9ut1sY0aKeUeRhw", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-02-07", "type": "review"}

I lived in France for two years & this compares very well to a fromagerie in France with all the different cheeses. The staff is all quite nice and knowledgable on the menu of cheeses and wines to pair with. We selected three cheeses and asked to pair with the suggested wines. I was very impressed. The cheese plate is paired with fruits and a scatter of almonds to cleanse the palate between cheeses. My boyfriend ordered the risotto for his entree and he was asked if he wanted salmon or chicken ... It wasn't a small amount of salmon as one would expect\n, but a quite moderate piece of salmon filet. I had the Cheuvront chicken served with polenta. Rarely do I finish my entire entree , but this meal was heaven in my mouth. For dessert we shared a piece of hazelnut torte and champagne. Perfect date night and worth the extra workout.

Plus, like Hard Rock, you can buy t-shirts and souvenirs.  \n\nA group of co-workers and I decided to go there for lunch since four of the five of us hadn't been there before. It seemed like quite a popular lunch destination as almost the entire inside was full. We were seated promptly and had a very nice server.  The menu includes your standard sports bar appetizers, wings, salads, and sandwiches.  There is even a small \"low carb\" section, with some very tasty sounding wraps.  I ordered the BLT and my bacon came out pretty crispy for the most part, as I requested. I liked how the bread wasn't toasted, but grilled, and my crispy fries were delicious.  I appreciated how the sandwich size was reasonable (you know, so it actually fit in my mouth) and I received a nice side of fries, but not too many. Portions appeared to be very reasonable.  With the sandwiches and burgers, you get a choice of two sides, but I only got the fries. Smart move on my part, as two sides would have been too much food for me.  My one co-worker ordered off the kids menu and our waitress was totally fine with that.  For the five of us, our bill came to $52, which is very very reasonable.\n\nI can see how this is a popular destination before Diamondback or Suns games...plenty of TVs dot the restaurant so regardless of where you are sitting, you have an easy view of at least one TV.  Service was quick despite a pretty full restaurant (we were in and out in well under an hour). Street parking was a tad tricky as most of the meters this afternoon were unavailable to park at (not sure why). But if you are going before a game, parking won't be an issue.  The heavy eyeliner on the servers and hostesses was a bit much for me, but fits in the overall theme of the restaurant I suppose.\n\nAll and all a good choice if you work downtown and are looking for a lunch place or before a sporting event.  Not sure I would make a special trip to eat here though.\n\nUPDATE (4/20/08):\n\nI have been to Coopers Town a few times since my initial review, most recently today before a Diamondbacks home game. Based on my subsequent experiences after my initial review, I have bumped up my star rating to 4 stars. I have tried a few more things on the menu and I highly recommend the crispy chicken wrap...it is delicious! The atmosphere at Coopers Town before a game is awesome and is a great spot to hit before a game. Plus how can you go wrong with $3 Bud, Bud Light, and Amber Bock drafts on home game days for the Suns and Diamondbacks?", "business_id": "oCA2OZcd_Jo_ggVmUx3WVw", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-01-24", "type": "review"}

We wanted to have dinner and walk over to the show. \n\nWhen my friends showed up it was as if one of them was an ex from a bad breakup. We needed to order food (and I had politely made him aware that we'd be in a bit of a hurry).

I had to assure them that he'd been nice just a few moments earlier. \n\nHe finally came back by. One friend ordered a sandwich and we didn't realize that Mike didn't bother to ask her what sides she wanted until we got the meal. She got mashed potatoes and beans. . . not what she wanted. So now we had to wait more for the sides she did want.\n\nI'm not sure what happened in Mike's world that night, be a switch flipped and he just seemed unhappy. The switch flipped back shortly before we left and he was nice again, but the damage was done. We all left good tips, even in spite of the medicore service.\n\nI'm also shocked that Alice Cooper would allow the women's restroom to be as shabby as it is.

But prety good food.  Can't say I'm an Alice Cooper fan, but we did see this on Man vs. Food and the opportunity came up to go there.\n\nWe stopped in mid-week for lunch.  Not crowded, the bar tender was GREAT.  Attentive, personable, good recommendations on food, but not intrusive.\n\nMy wife had the Lady Gaga sausage appetizer.  Fantastic sausage, spicy, great sauce, served with celery stalks and bleu cheese (optional).  She likes a good sausage.....let's leave it at that....and Alice Cooper delivered.\n\nSince the bartender claimed the place is a BBQ house, I went with a  BBQ beef sandwich, with chili and fries for the sides.  While the pig in me would have wanted more of everything, it was the perfect size for lunch.\n\nThe brisket was done perfectly.  We travel with a smoker...so I know a little about BBQ.   The BBQ sauce is very good.  I'd like it spicier, but I always do.  The sauce is multidimensional with some real \"depth\" to the bench.  It's not a one-trick pony BBQ sauce.  The sauce is also not thick, like ketchup.  It's definitely not off-the-shelf.\n\nThe Chili.  Two words; A-mazing.  A few weeks ago, we were at a chili cook-off.  Cooper's Town chili would have kicked some butt.  Again...could have been spicier, but there was some heat and there was LOTS of flavor.  Could definitely taste a hint of the BBQ sauce, cumin, and chili.  Saw what looked like slices of Anaheim or Serrano pepper.  And it has beans.  Again, seems to not have any thickener in it - I appreciate that.  A clean flavor.  Next time, the chili burger will be ordered.  The side portion is just too damn small - this stuff is good.\n\nPrices are decent - lunch for the 2 of us for just over $20.  Can't complain about that.\n\nThe decor is nice, cool memorabilia, autographs on the wall, definitely a sports bar with huge damn screens.  Nice place.  Nice time.

The 5 year old said \"What the heck is that? That's a really big hot dog!\". And that was that.\n\nThe other nephew, age 12, got his Mike Myers and took about one bite out of it. He didn't like it much and I don't really blame him. I examined the sandwich only to find that the BBQ sauce on it was all dried up on the meat. The grilled pork loin appeared to be the only fresh meat on the sandwich. Ah well, 14 dollar sandwich down the drain.\n\nThe 5 year old took a tiny bite out of his dry hamburger slider and ate a couple of fries. The fries were just like Burger King fries...not so yummy.\n\nMe and my friend started eating the hot dog which had shredded cheese, bacon and pickles. Each side is a dollar, by t he way. Anyway....it tasted good for the first few bites but after that I was overwhelmed by the saltiness of the hot dog. Way too salty.\n\n50 dollars later I walked out with 3 take home containers and 4 people that were still hungry because they couldn't eat the food.\n\nOn to the ambiance; they sat us very close to the entrance/exit to the kitchen which is also near the bar. They had 4 TV's going and the music was blaring. We couldn't even hear each other talking.

I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to stop here on the way out of town and grab a bite with the family.\n\nWe ordered potato skins to start, the Big Unit Hot Dog, Pulled Pork Sandwich, and Beef Brisket. \n\nThe potato skins were better than what I've had at chain restaurants. The bacon on them is the same as the hot dogs so at least there's an effort to make it less processed. They're served with Ranch (I'm used to sour cream) which made it interesting but enjoyable. \n\nThe Big Unit Hot Dog ($16.99) is enough for two. I ate 3/4 of it before my flight, my wife had the difference. This is definitely one of those items you want to order to egg on your buddies to order and try out, giving them the bode of confidence that they'll finish, well knowing they'll pay for it later. I tried to walk it off but eventually fell victim to the meat coma. \n\nThe dog tastes like most dogs, a little spicy flare to it but not unbearable for those who do not like heat. What really makes this hot dog in my opinion is the bread. It's what you would expect from a baguette, hard outside and soft inside. Even with the toppings I added (bacon, cheese sauce and sauerkraut) the bun held up. \n\nThe restaurant is full of TVs, perfect for catching a few games. It's no short on entertainment. The plus on service was that our server was very conscientious of the short time line we were on. The opportunity that could have been gained was asking for refills for beverages, which came at the end. They did stop by to see how the meal was after all of us had a few bites.

Before I get into detail about my visit I will hit on basic points people look for in reviews. The prices, food, drinks and desserts were good. It was better than most sports bar places. Also the service was good.\n\n\n I went during the week at lunch time and they were not busy. It is a sports bar that has rock n roll roots. The servers all had the Alice Cooper eye makeup on(great touch). The drink menu is celebrity themed. I had the Ozzy Osborne and James Gandolfini.  Both were great and served in pint size glasses (I was surprised). For appetizer we had the nightmare Nachos.  They are nachos with nightmare chili on them. I thought they were really good.\n\nFor our entrees I got the Cuban sandwich and my wife got the maniac mac and cheese with chicken. I was tempted to try and eat the nightmare Big Unit (which is 22 in hot dog with lots of toppings). The Cuban sandwich was really good and the garlic mayo was not over powering, but it had flavor.  My wife's mac and cheese came with potato chips on top. My wife was surprised on how it actually improved the dishes flavor. She would get it again. She is a tough mac and cheese critic. \n\nNow onto the dessert.  We couldn't decide on which one to get so we got 2. The oversized hot white macadamia nut cookie with ice cream and the dessert  taco with banana cheese cake filling. My wife like the taco better than me (not a huge cheese cake eater), but the macadamia nut cookie dessert will be one I get everytime. Both desserts are big enough to share. \n\nI would love to go back again. They are closed most Sundays. Unless there is a major event downtown.

We brought my parents and showed up for lunch around 1 (on a Sunday). The restaurant area was quite busy and we were a bit surprised to see that no one was utilizing the giant patio out front. We had a bit of a disconnect with the host and being properly seated but that gave us time to survey the decor.\n\nFood wise, I opted for the brisket plate and my family all had sandwiches. Our food arrived quite promptly, which was perfect. I was served 6 long strips of brisket, that was well cooked. The sauce provided was necessary as it was a smidge dry and didn't have the smoke ring one would look for. My sides of coleslaw and mashed potatoes were thoroughly enjoyed though and I definitely didn't leave hungry. The coleslaw has blue cheese mixed in which I felt was delicious but if that's not your think, perhaps choose another item. Everyone else enjoyed their meals and found the food worth the price.\n\nService was fairly attentive and our drinks were never empty. The eye makeup on each was unique though it would have been nice to see at least one of them enthusiastic about being there. Instead we got a lot of grumpy faces and no smiles. 'No more Mr Nice Guy' seems to fit in well ;) They also ring what sounds like a fire alarm bell every time someone orders a jumbo hot dog and the servers all yell something. There must have been 10 hot dogs ordered during our visit and it got a bit old after the first time.\n\nOverall, we had a decent visit.

What could be more exciting than seeing a first-person account of the intensity of Suns fans - the roaring cheers, the music, the stunts and even the fire? What could be more exciting than seeing two ex-KU players (Pierce and Pollard) take the floor to battle Nash & Co. Well, not much. Let's just say I wish I hadn't been crammed into my seat - wedged between an older gentleman with binoculars and my handsome date. Atleast I could lean a little bit to my right (we're talking proximity people, not politics) and share common real estate with somebody I know very well. He even remarked, \"Good thing we know each other as well as we do.\" \n\nOh, and the seats. Well, I bought them via a Ticket Liquidator, whom, if I could, would give 5 stars. I also bought a parking pass to Jefferson Parking Garage. It was super easy to find, pull into and leave (so long as you leave about 3 minutes before the game ends). \n\nThis isn't the first Suns game I've seen, but it has been the more uncomfortable of the two. Our seats were in the upper section above the Celtics bench. I thought I would have seen more green, man. Not that I wanted the Celtics to win, but my date is from Boston. I thought it would be fun for him to sit among \"his peeps.\" Well, the green was scattered - few and far between. That's okay. The Suns fans we were around didn't hackle or boo us - which was nice of them, considering I was clapping and cheering for the home team. \n\nBut, watching the game was more of a game than the actual action on the court (holy crapola, both teams sucked!). Our seats were in Row 7, the first row near the stairs over the entrance to the 205 section. Argh. If we had been two seats in, we would have been fine. If we had been one row down, even better. Somehow I managed to pick the seats that had bars and people in the way. My date said it didn't bother him, yet being a perfectionist, I was a tad disappointed in my selection. Atleast we were near the aisle and could come-and-go without disturbing too many people - just one guy in a leather jacket. \n\nFinding our seats was easy. US Airways makes it easy to enter and leave the arena, which is great. Two escalators down makes for a speedy escape. Yet, dodging the people in the narrow halls is not that much fun. (But, standing around watching them is!)\n\nAtleast the Suns Team Shop had the mascot monkey on sale for $7.50. Talk about a sure-fire way to appease anybody... right?\n\nAll in all, a fun experience with a fun date. We didn't partake of any of their crummy beer. We opted to go to The Roosevelt afterward, where we saw a few more fans - both Boston and Phoenix, alike. (Not to mention had two great beers from Rogue Brewing Co.)\n\nFun night! Too bad I felt like I had gotten the crappiest seats in the arena, only to have my view blocked from antsy fans and vendors selling anything you can imagine, from beer (\"Cold beer here!\"), something pink with whipped cream, giant cookies and a sardine sandwich.

Each box also has a private restroom (yay!).

Great for people watching - the ice cream sundae line starting in the 3rd period can really bring out the ugly in some...

How about location? atmosphere? There are so many ways to offer opinions but the best in my humble know-it-all way is to compare it to other like arenas.\n\nLets talk about atmosphere. This is where the fan comes in. How dedicated, supportive and basically crazy a building gets on game night. US Airways Center is middle of the road. Not bad, nor is it great in terms of some of the others out there. For example, the two best (again, solely my opinion) are Madison Square Garden and Oracle in Oakland. Those two are by far the two loudest and filled with the most knowledgeable basketball fans in the country. \n\nOh oh, I have offended some of you and I apologize.\n\nBut lets face it.\n\nThe bottom dwellers in this group include Dallas, Houston and Atlanta (in that that order). Those arenas just do not cut it in terms of fan noise. Even on the biggest of game nights, the fans tend to sit on their hands and rarely even stand on their feet during crucial plays. \n\nThe middle of the road(ers). There are plenty of venues that fit this category. Phoenix as I mentioned is one along with Orlando, Utah and Detroit. They get up for the big game and the playoffs but are pretty ho hum when it comes to a weeknight nothing special event.\n\nThe overrateds. Yes, there are those that get more press and pub than they deserve. The Lakers at the Staples Center easily top this list. Come see them after a two game losing streak and the fans are about as lackluster and disinterested as a Ramones fan at a Taylor Swift concert. Miami, you too! Take LeBron out of the mix and your building is one big yawnfest. And I have one more, and this one is a shocker-Boston. Yes, I said it. Boston fans of changed. I think the recent success of the Pats and Sox have taken some of the passion away and there is not enough to go around. \n\nThe underrated(s). Portland, great fans and driven with basketball knowledge. I can't think of anyone else I would include on this list.But if Seattle ever gets another franchise I may consider including them here.\n\nWith this said, a nice sports venue with plenty of space and nice sight lines offering the fan a better than average NBA experience.

It didn't feel overly crowded and parking was plentiful in outdoor lots or the adjacent indoor multi-story connected building.  \n\nThere's a Starbucks on site, which was like heaven to me . . . I wanted a nice hot tea to savor through the show, There are other well-known food concessions throughout the arena, as well as some fairly comfortable seating areas to pass the time until the powers that be allow you to go to your seat.\n\nSince we were sitting in Section 102, first row, we were in the makeshift seats (the same as they put on the floor, foldables with no real back support.  This was probably the only negative for me as after about an hour, my lower back was killing me (and I still feel it this morning!).  But . . . the seats were wonderful for viewing the show.  Couldn't have been better.  \n\nSound quality was what you'd expect in an arena not built specifically for music, so I didn't have high expectations. \n\nI have to say that I am very impressed by the US Airways Center and all the \"nightmare\" worries that I had about entering the building, exiting the building, finding something I wanted to drink, and of course, parking, were something I didn't have to be anxious about at all!

Security and the ushers/usherettes were polite; just so you know to hide your water bottle ;)  You have to walk through security (like the airport) with your arms up; just don't wear too many metals ;)  Take the Metro Light Rail for free(!) up to a few hours before showtime- just show your event ticket when asked on the train (you'd be surprised to meet many people on it also going to the same event ).  The venue was large & spacious enough to accompany an event of this 'magnitude' (i.e. veteran rock concerts); however, the seats were small and walking the aisles to get to your seats were very narrow that some had to get up and stand back with chairs folding back up for others to walk by to their seats.  the inclines all around can feel a bit steep for those afraid of heights.  The sound system was at a comfortable level that it didn't break your eardrums.  The air conditioner was set on and the more people filled up, the more it did get a little warm.  I did not eat or park there so I won't review them; I'm too cheap and wouldn't dare engage in Highway Robbery with them- just eat a big meal before the show at home or somewhere else cheaper ;)  The Merchandise windows were big enough for me to view what souvenir to purchase.  The restroom was clean.\nAll-in-all, I wouldn't mind attending future events there- as long it was something I'd want to see badly!", "business_id": "uFJwKlHL6HyHSJmORO8-5w", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-12-22", "type": "review"}

With all those in the area for the pre-superbowl fun, the Phoenix Open and all the concerts taking place - getting in and out of the center was no where near as bad as I thought it might be.\n\nThe center itself seems well thought out - clean - and the lighting is pretty amazing. Everything about the center just seems new, fresh and well maintained as well as organized.\n\nParking was easy - though we had garage passes and a suite - my review is based on that aspect.\n\nAs for the concert - I wasn't a huge fan of either performer - Pitbull or Enrique! However, this concert changed my mine on both. Pitbull was first and I understood him much better - perhaps not the words but the man and he certainly knew how to get the crowd heated up for what any honest person would say is a pretty hot young man.\n\nYes Enrique blew the roof off the place and his music for me was more my type than the Pits, but both men were strong on values and Enrique just seemed to have his act more fine-tuned. \n\nWhen the two of them came together at the end - that was how to rock it out!

No big deal we didn't ask for it. We sit down and probably 10 minutes passed and finally someone comes to take our drink order. Another 5-10 minutes passed and we get our drinks and have to ask to place our food order, judging by the service so far its going to be a long time before we get any food so we want to get the process going. I ordered the boneless buffalo wings with a side of fries, my husband orders the ribs, and we got the chicken tenders for our son. The boneless wings were gross, not even warm and not even really reheated all the way, not very saucy almost like a dry rub with a splash of sauce. The fries were good. My husbands ribs were alright, however the waitress didn't come back to check on us until we were done eating. So I snacked on wings I didn't even really want. We couldn't get anymore sauce or a wet nap for my husband to wipe his hands on so he instead had to take off to the bathroom to wash his hands. My husbands decides to order a beer and asks what size the \"tall one\" was, the waitress doesn't know a size but points to someone's glass and says \"that size right there\" so my husbands said he would take one, when it finally comes it doesn't come in a glass but rather a disposable cup, he asked why it was in that and not a glass and he informed him they were \"out of glasses\" \n\nProbably 5 minutes after the waitress drops the check off (the quickest she has came back the entire time we have been there) she comes back and asks us if she can move us to a table outside and mentions how our son will be able to overlook the field if we move out there. NOTE: they have tables inside overlooking the field that say 1 hour maximum sitting time, we WERE NOT at these tables but rather the ones in the back of the restaurant that have no sign with a time limit posted. She also tells us how we can take our sons leftovers and our drinks to go and they will let us bring them in the stadium downstairs. We agree and I go ahead and go out to the outside area while my husbands waits for our to go drinks and a box. I no more then set our stuff down and the hostess comes overs and tells me that we CANNOT sit at those tables and acts like she has no idea why my waitress had told me we could sit there and like I was crazy, then she proceeds to tell us there are stadium chairs out there on their patio that we can sit in but we can't sit at the tables. At this point i'm annoyed because our waitress had kicked us out of our table only to get sent outside to find out we couldn't sit out there either. We take a seat in two of these stadium chairs on their patio and sit there for probably about 10 minutes until a security guard comes and tells us those are ticketed chairs and we can't sit there either. At this point we are more then ready to leave and never come back. When we are leaving there are people waiting all over. I felt bad that they were waiting that long for bad food and bad service, which is the only reason I am even writing a bad review.\n\nOnce we get back downstairs and try to go in with our to-go stuff that we were told we could bring in we are told we cannot bring in the iced tea in the to go cup because it doesn't say TGI Fridays on the cup even though everything else we had clearly said it and we had just came out of the exit. \n\nOverall we were very disappointed by not only poor food but also poor service and lack of communication amongst the staff members.", "business_id": "1-1VcGTL3GyCqUpXZLFTZA", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-01-26", "type": "review"}

I've been going to small shows in the valley for almost 20 years (wow, that hurts to say out loud), and this is as good a place as any other crappy dump I've been to. The best thing I can say about it is that it doesn't smell like piss.\n\nThe crowd on any given night can be a little too \"look at me\" for my taste, but it's not like you have much choice if your favorite band is playing here. Parking is in a pot hole filled mostly dirt lot, so expect your car to be filthy and if it has been raining, expect mud. With nowhere to sit inside, most people spend half the show out in front sitting on a dirty stoop - everyone smoking. \n\nThe people that operate this place are pretty laid back it seems. I think if I was still in a band, I'd book a show here. As far as going to shows here, I'm perhaps getting a little too old to be going to shows at places like this - it's more for the kids if you ask me... but if a favorite or friend's band is playing here, count me in.\n\nAs for the art - well, that's all totally subjective.

The music.  Which lasts when administrations and trends are gone, and flashes in the pan are revealed as pyrite.  Speaking of eternal, the particular piece she was discussing was Beethoven's fifth.  And I learned something!  Real pros don't call it Beethoven's fifth. They call it \"Beethoven Five\".  Can you imagine composing something that the best talents of subsequent ages compete with each other to try to do honor to? She also discussed the ruddy earthy tambre of another piece, and those words resonated because I was careening across a stretch of Arizona's ruddy desert at that point and I felt her words echo the landscape.  She was more lyrical and relevant and hard hitting with her prose than many self-styled prose gurus and 97% of talking heads.

I have seen two concerts performed by the Phoenix Symphony so far and I cannot wait to see more.  \n\nMost recently, my husband and I watched the Nutcracker.  We purchased the \"cheap seats,\" which were still pricey.  We arrived 15 minutes late (tacky, I know).  This stunt ended up being a blessing in disguise.  Since we were late the usher told us we had to sit in the balcony until intermission so that we would not disrupt the show by entering through the main doors.\n\nThere were only a handful of people in the balcony so we pretty much got our pick of seats.  The orchestra was down in the pit (correct term?  Dunno.) and we could actually see the full orchestra from that angle.  It was like panorama view!\n\nAt intermission we went to find our actual seats, but we were turned off by how crowded it was.  Plus, our seats were in the second to last row which wasn't exactly a primo spot.  Mind you, Symphony Hall is not that big so there really isn't a bad seat.  We decided that the balcony was better for us so we made our way back upstairs.\n\nThe previous concert we experienced was with Broadway singer, Cheyenne Jackson. These seats were complimentary from the Phoenix Symphony via our apartment \nmanagement.  On this occasion the orchestra was directly on stage backing up the singer.  This was a more intimate set up, whereas The Nutcracker was more grand. \n\nThe Phoenix Symphony is a great way to sneak in a little culture and to experience one of the treasures of downtown Phoenix.", "business_id": "dNEAXZDrZ3TtK4d7Pl2Ydg", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-01-02", "type": "review"}

My Mom and I stopped there for lunch today (Saturday), and it was empty. As we ate, a few more people stopped in. I don't think everyone knows they are open on Saturday's yet, but hopefully the business will pick up. \n\nI discovered this place thanks to some friends at work. Since my first visit, I've never been disappointed. I always order the Chicken Picado Pita and it is always so delicious! Just the right chicken to pepper and onion ratio. The pitas are fresh, the tzatziki sauce superb and their french fries are magnificent -- crispy outside and melt-in-your-mouth buttery inside. Although I've yet to venture outside my own menu choices, they have plenty of items to choose from and I'm sure just as delicious.\n\nThe staff is friendly and accommodating. The parking is limited if you get there on a busy day, but otherwise it isn't too hard to find a spot. Like others have mentioned, it is right on the light-rail route so the location is great too.  They even have a small patio out front where you can enjoy your food and the Phoenix weather (when permitting). \n\nIf you are out and about in the downtown area during the week or Saturday, definitely give Athenian Express a try.

Sometimes their fries are a little over cooked and under salted but whatever, I don't go there for the fries.\nThe gyros are great, so are their pitas. My favorite pita is the chicken picado. The chicken is always very juicy and fresh and the grilled vegetables are well cooked and pair well with the chicken.\nI know they're also doing breakfast now, which I have had once. I don't remember what I got because it was some years ago, but I remember leaving satisfied and full.\n\nI think for the price and quality, you just can't beat Athenian express. For a year, I worked right next door to them. I would stop in almost every day and get lunch and talk with the owner and his wife. They are very friendly and funny, as is their staff. I always felt welcomed. Even with phones ringing off the hook and lines out the door, they always have a smile on their faces.\nI stop in maybe once every 3 months or so and the only thing that's changed since I worked next to them is that they've renovated and made the place bigger.

It has proven to be a great decision, because there is almost always something that's fun for us to go see to kill an afternoon.  There's usually an exhibit worth peeking at, or a new IMAX movie.\n\nThe static part of the museum is really nothing major.  It's fun the first time around, but then once you've seen it all, there's not much to go back for besides the play room and the dancing magnets (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p_AijTtlc  which by the way have totally hijacked that song at the start, in my mind.  It cracks me up and I could watch it for ages). \n\nToday we saw the Titanic and Dinosaur exhibits.  The Titanic was really pretty interesting.  Tons of actual artifacts and recreations of various rooms.  The weirdest thing to me though was the recreation of an iceberg.  Anyone here not know what ice looks like?  Anyway, it was fun and something pretty neat to see.  And did you know that all the items that are down there have actually had their chemical makeup changed by the pressure and lack of oxygen down there?  And that they'll fall apart or even explode if simply brought up to surface?  Well I didn't, so I consider the afternoon a success, having learned something new.\n\nTwo of the more interesting bits of the exhibit:  the \"boarding passes\" that we were given with names of real passengers (of course I was in first class).  At the end of the exhibit, there is a wall with the names of all passengers and whether or not the survived.  My son survived, the traveling companions listed on my pass survived, but alas, I succumbed to the cold waters of the Atlantic that night.  Also, there was a lady all dressed up \"in character\", sitting on a bench reading a book.  I think I want that job even more than I want Gabi's job.\n \nThe dinosaur exhibit was... well kinda lame.  Big dinosaur robot things that sort of jiggled and swayed around.  We were naughty and touched one, and it kind of gave me the creeps.\n\nMy kid's review:  \"The Science Center is good for families, but after you go there once, you don't really know what else to do besides go to whatever special they're having.

One word: Forensics. They had a \"CSI\" type of exhibit, and although I'm not a fan of the show, I thought it'd be cool to go since I'm so enthusiastic about forensic science.  I was quite disappointed perhaps because they had everything that I already knew (life cycle of a blow fly), stages of decay, etc. But also because it was quite small in size.  For the kids it was pretty awesome with all the maggots and bugs, and if you're a fan of the show, maybe. *It's gone now though. i didn't join Yelp until recently*\n\nI must say that they utilized as much space as they could with 3 stories.  My bf and I had a blast at the different exhibits, especially the Physics themed one with pulleys and puzzles.

Demonstrate a cool science topic with a \"wow\" factor that grabs my attention\n2. Now that you've got my attention, explain *what* just happened, and *why* it happened.  TEACH ME SOMETHING.\n\nThe exhibits in this museum are SEVERELY lacking in the second half.\n\nYou have to understand I'm a 5-year old science geek at heart.  Which means I love to play with toys, but I also love to find out what makes the toys tick.\n\nPush down on this platform and a smoke ring ejects from a big box.  Wow that was cool.

Draw a house on paper with crayons...\"  The most egregious in this category was the Ford sponsored Robots gallery.  Lots of playing with dominos, drawing with crayons, and reading quotes from your favorite movie robots.  That's it.  No joke.  Nothing informative at all.  And I stupidly paid extra for it.  I'm sure that with a good rotating exhibit, the museum would have garnered a third star from me.\n\nBy far the saving grace of this museum is the live demonstrations, where they do actually teach you something while wowing you with such things as exploding fireballs.  \n\nBut honestly, the museum itself felt like a big playground for kids with ADD to run amok.  I know some people are going to think \"It's a museum for kids, it's supposed to be that way.\"  Well, that's true to an extent, but the museum should be both fun AND INFORMATIVE, not fun and pointless.

SO much to do, so little time.  Both children love it there (ages 6 and 10).  They are less interested in learning the science of the exhibits than touching them and making them do something but it keeps them entertained. Definitely go to the Planetarium - you don't get to see those everyday.  There is an IMAX but we never get a chance to go because we run out of time.

The memberships are great if you plan on going there more than once like we used to do when the kids were younger - you also get a discount on their summer camps (which are awesome).\n\nBe prepared and you will enjoy it more:\n\n1. It's expensive.  There is an admission fee, fees for the planetarium, fees for the IMAX, fees for the traveling exhibits and parking fees (even when validated). You can get discounts occasionally on groupon or dealchicken but plan on spending some dough.\n\n2. It's time consuming. Plan on spending a minimum of 3 hours there.  Plan ahead and see what's playing at the planetarium and the times. There are different shows throughout the day. Same with IMAX. \n\n3. DO NOT EAT THERE. There is a cafe but don't waste your time or money on it.  It's terrible and expensive. Wear comfortable shoes and walk down to another restaurant for lunch and then come back.

Hit Rose and crown for an app and a drink. then SC for a bit. then Bianco for pizza and wine. then get the hell out of my down town you freaking tourist driving the wrong way on a 1 way street (the other tip; READ THE STREET SIGNS or pay the price).

Grabbed their Groupon, our family friends, who were in town and headed downtown!\n\nMake sure you download the Groupon to your device before you enter the building, our AT&T coverage ceased to exist inside all the cement walls. No problem we walked back out the front and downloaded it. Get your parking validated too, it reduces the price from $12.00, to only $3.00. \n\nWe got our Pirate tickets affixed our wristbands and took the elevator straight to the third floor exhibit. It all starts with a intro movie and a great entry into the actual exhibit. There were so many artifacts from the Whydah (whee-duh)!  My favorite was all the booty the pirates had plundered!  One liked the pistols, cannons, cannon shot and replica ship. The younger boys liked all the items they could touch and pick up!!  Our daughter loved the ship's bell and all the gold artifacts, especially the jewelry! The oldest of the kiddos liked the gift shop at the end of the exhibit. There were lots great pirate trinkets for all ages! I felt like a kid again, reading \"Treasure Island\"!\n\nThe science center had other great exhibits on the other floors as well. The youngest boys liked the Monster Stomach!  If you've been to the science center you know why, if you haven't, you'll just have to make a visit and find out for yourself. \n\nThe Freeman exhibit was also great!  Our kids enjoyed the pipes & valves, but had trouble putting them together. Not a plumber in the bunch! The adults tried to stack wooden blocks to create standing masterpieces, not an architect in our group either. \n\nAnother draw was the SkyCycle!  A bicycle suspended above the first floor along a thick cable. Each adventurous ride will cost you $5.00 as a non-member, $3.00 for members. We enjoyed watching everyone ride across the sky. \n\nEveryone really enjoyed the MindBall challenge!  Two people put on the connectors and try to relax.  The person who relaxes most moves the ball till it reaches the other end. I was able to out relax them all, even with my two kids trying to distract me!\n\nWe didn't go to the IMAX theater/Planetarium, we had reservations at Rustler's Rooste!", "business_id": "MwmXm48K2g2oTRe7XmssFw", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-01-12", "type": "review"}

If you or your kids want to do it you have to meet the height requirements, fit into the harness & you need to wear tennis shoes.

First, the price to see this special exhibit was exorbitant- $25.00 a person including general admission.  This DID NOT include any IMAX movies or the planetarium, which were each $8.00 extra.  And, the price did not include parking, which for me, ended up being another $5.00.  At the end of the day, I ended up paying $38.00 just for one person.\n\nAs far as the Van Gogh exhibit, the concept was interesting but unfortunately, the children in the other exhibit next door were so incredibly loud that you could  hear their screaming, which was louder than the music playing in the Van Gogh exhibit.  Additionally, a couple of women brought their children into this exhibit, which was quite clearly for adults, and the kids were noisy as well.\n\nThe Van Gogh exhibit was ok-I really do not know why this exhibit was at this museum as it did not relate to science and it was geared to adults- not kids like everything else at this museum.  The other exhibits might have been interesting but there were unruly children running around and screaming all over the place.\n\nMy last stop was to the planetarium-I saw the Grand Tour of the Planets.  This was god awful. There was a woman narrator who talked the entire time about the planets but again, her presentation was geared to little kids.  I felt like I was in kindergarden listening to her.\n\nMaybe if you have little kids this museum is fine but it truly was an incredible rip off and not very enjoyable in my opinion.", "business_id": "MwmXm48K2g2oTRe7XmssFw", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-02-23", "type": "review"}

How completely unnecessary, and when I questioned the reason for the early rise, I only received non-answers and mean stares. \n\nTheir solution to every problem is to give people a pill. And doctors are way too quick to prescribe them . You can't sleep, here's a pill. Well, if I wasn't interrupted 3-4 times a night I would be able to have a good night's sleep without the unnecessary assistance of a sleep hypnotic. \n\nDo you fell depressed in a hospital?

I noticed that in Pod D the DAY nurses are a little less attentive and slower to respond to the remote control caller button than the night Pod D nurses were.  \n\nPod C nurses were nicer than Pod D nurses overall, and many of them are friends with each other and attend the same church and even quietly sung some of their church songs together on the night shift, which was very comforting in my opinion.  Pod C nurses were very attentive, quick to respond, were very \"real\" when speaking with me and answering questions, and knew all the ins and outs of getting you the best care from the doctors.  They visited with each other while at the nurses station, that's true, but they rarely got to sit down for more than a few minutes at a time because it was always time for some patient to get some type of attention and it NEVER, EVER ENDS.  \n\nSTOP WHAT YOU ARE DOING RIGHT NOW AND REALIZE THAT NO MATTER WHAT TIME OF NIGHT IT IS -- THE NURSES AT BANNER GOOD SAM ARE GETTING OUT OF THEIR CHAIRS CONSTANTLY TO ATTEND TO SOMETHING A PATIENT NEEDS AND MONITORING THEIR CARE FROM THEIR COMPUTER PROGRAMS AND ARE IN CONSTANT TOUCH WITH THE DOCTORS BY PHONE, GIVING THEM UPDATES.  I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY CAN KEEP ALL THE CHANGING DATA IN THEIR HEADS FROM ALL THE CHANGES WITH EACH PATIENT.  It truly is a constant thing around the clock and I know because I was a day sleeper while I was there and I was awake at all hours of the night, getting my ice chps and walking with my walker for exercise and I saw those nurses constantly attending to the patients at 1:00 a.m., 3:00 a.m., 4:00 a.m.  IT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.\n\nI agree there is a neverending string of visitors wanting blood, taking blood pressure, dispensing your meds, asking you questions, etc. that starts about 3:00 a.m. and goes thru to about 7:00 a.m.  I almost felt I should \"hold a meeting or press conference\" and have them all appear in my room at once and answer their questions and allow them to poke and prod simultaneously and get it over with so I could go back to sleep.\n\nThere could be better housekeeping efforts in the private bathrooms by the cleaning staff.\n\nIf you find yourself staying at Banner Good Sam for 1 or more nights and are in need of any kind of pain medication (other than the morphine self-pumper - limited of course), then take a tip from me and self-monitor the timing of your doses so that if you are supposed to get your pain pill(s) every four (4) hours, START getting the nurses going on dispensing your meds about 20-40 minutes before that four (4) hours is UP, because it takes them that long to go through all the administrative medical hoops to actually hand you the pills.  If you WAIT until your four (4) hours is UP to ask the nurses for your next round of pain meds, it can take them 20-40 minutes to get it to you by the time they make all the phone calls they need to make, and by then you could be in trouble with PAIN.  I'm surprised that the nurses don't realize this themselves and start getting your next round ready 20-40 minutes BEFORE your four (4) hour interval is up -- but, alas this seems to be up to the patient.  Pod C was better about this than Pod D was BTW.\n\nI only met one Nurse Ratchet, and she was sort of a Semi-Nurse-Ratchet on Pod D -- can't remember her name, but she had that familiar cold stare.\n\nI like the layout of the pods with their circular nurse stations -- they can really keep an eye on the patients that way and they are always at hand, and when you need to do some walking with your walker or IV pole, you can go in circles and still be close to the nurses.  They know which patients haven't done any walking yet, and they congratulate and encourage you when they see you finally up and about!  Also, the ice chip machine is a great find and it dispenses FILTERED water and ice chips -- a Godsend when you are on ice chips and no food for days.  I think the nurses have a running joke about \"Whack-a-Mole\" which describes their constant interruptions during their shift from their patients that surround them in the circular pod.  Being in the center of the pod, the nurses in their nurse station have nowhere to hide from patients!  Those nurses really deserve all our respect and adoration for the CONSTANT care and interruptions they endure with such grace.  \n\nI intend to go back to visit them and thank the ones I remember in person with gifts very soon and I WILL NOT FAIL TO DO THIS AS GOD IS MY WITNESS.  I feel so much better now they may not even recognize me from the pained, dizzy, bloated, hospital-robed, frizzy haired, no-make-up lady they took such good care of for a few days.  I will waltz in there with my hair and makeup done, wearing nice clothes and bearing gifts and hugs very soon!

I was living in Phoenix back in the mid-80's and pining for LA-style Mex when I came across a review for this funky place on Buckeye Road.  I'm tellin' ya, my life changed after a single meal there.  No longer would I say that Phoenix had no good Mexican restaurants.  Time and life has taken me to different places and I now live thousands of miles away, but when I get a long layover at Sky Harbor, I'm happy, because it means I will have time for a meal at Rosita's.  My personal favorites are the red AND green chile, so I usually order the half and half, unless I'm going to be in town a few days.  The chips and salsas are the best in the US.   I LIKE the area that Rosita's has moved to.  After dinner some night, take a drive through the trailer park in back; it's like a time warp into the '50's and there are some really cool old Lucy and Desi trailers in that park.", "business_id": "hWhVP-28LYP3llaMlAJ_JA", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-12-17", "type": "review"}

The other reviewers were dead-on and I appreciate the Yelp community for getting me prepped for waiting times.

It is slightly annoying that the chips have a cost, but seriously it's just a buck!  The salsa totally makes it worth it as well - I think the red salsa there is some of the best I've had in recent times.\n\nThe atmosphere was great.  There was a little cantina towards the back and the place was a lot bigger and nicer than I was expecting.\n\nThat pesky service is the only thing that keeps Rosita's from making the leap to great from good.  As I said, if you head in assuming things may take a while, not so bad; but I could see that becoming a problem in time-sensitive situations like lunch.\n\nOne last quick tip - they don't split the bill, so make sure people in your party have cash or owe money to the person who ends up paying with the card.", "business_id": "hWhVP-28LYP3llaMlAJ_JA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-02-28", "type": "review"}

As you make the long walk to the front entrance, you'll disregard any conversation with others in your party as you worry whether or not your car will be there after dinner. It will and here's why.\n\nAs you make your way to the front of the parking lot, you'll notice an old Mexican man, (actually a cliche or sorts, complete with sombrero and serape) sitting, vigilantly keeping an eye on your vehicle and everyone else's. \nThis should calm you down, enough so that you're able to re-join the conversation. Now get inside and get ready for a cold Mexican beer and a pitcher of Margaritas. \n\nTheir chips are gratis and served warm. A nice treat,. They offer red salsa, hot sauce, and tomatillo green sauce which is spectacularly hot.\n\nEvery item on their menu is delicious, but my preference is either the Machaca burrito, or the Chicken Mole.

Not too much chocolate, not too much chile, just right. \n\nWhat I really love is the black and white photos of old Mexican bandits, governors, rabble rousers, war hero, ex-Presidents and others. \n\nHere's my suggestion.\nGo on a weeknight when they're not busy.

My daughter didn't like the machaca, which I tried and figured out it was really carne seca. The waitress noticed my daughter didn't like it and I pointed out it was carne seca and not machaca. She apologized and removed it from the bill, which redeemed her some. My daughter ended up having some of my carne asada.\n\nThe ambiance is divey and it wasn't very clean, but not unhealthy clean.\n\nI probably wouldn't go back if in the area again, but mostly due to the bad service.", "business_id": "hWhVP-28LYP3llaMlAJ_JA", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-01-07", "type": "review"}

After hearing the praises sung about this place, I was ready to have \"real\" Mexican food (by my coworkers' definitions). \n\nThe location is small and not particularly tidy, but was seemed to be pretty legitimate, and we were happy to take the trip over.We started out with chips and salsa, red and green. The green was HOT, while the red was more mild, but they were both very flavorful. Our group of about 12 people was waited on by one woman, who did her best, but definitely could have used some help on a party that large.\n\nWe started with cheese crisp, which was new to me, and delicious! The cheese was hot and evenly melted, with a rich, buttery flavor. I added a little red salsa to give it a kick, and really enjoyed it!\n\nWe waited a LONG time to get our entrees (I would guess 45 minutes from the time the crisp was delivered), and I was accidentally given the wrong entree. I'd ordered a chicken burro, enchilada style, with rice, and received my boss' order of the same thing, but with beef. After cutting into it, I passed it to him and let the waitress know what I had ordered and that I hadn't received my food. 10 minutes later, she returned to our table with another burro (the one pictured) that was okay, but tasted a bit off... after examining it, I realized that it was pork... which I don't really care for. Not wanting to slow down an already-long lunch, I decided to just go ahead and eat the second burro, despite my not really caring for the meat. \n\nAll in all, I might be willing to give it another try, but the wait and receiving the wrong food twice were fairly off-putting. It would likely have been a better experience, had our table had an extra waitress, as my drink also sat empty for about a quarter of the meal with no server in sight. My fingers are crossed that next time, the experience is better. I was really looking forward to the meal, and it just didn't come out as good as I'd hoped it might.", "business_id": "hWhVP-28LYP3llaMlAJ_JA", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-01-15", "type": "review"}

Every business should be allowed an off day here and there, but 3 times in a row is way too many!\n\nThe first time, it took forever for the waitress to come over once we were seated. After what seemed like forever we finally got some chips and salsa and then the waitress finally appeared. My son's order came out way before mine, so far in advance that he was done eating when mine arrived. Once I finally got my enchilada and beans, the beans were cold and the cheese was not even melted in the enchilada and I had to send it back! Again, can't find the waitress and getting front of house is almost impossible! Finally the food was sent back, by the time it came back again, my son really wanted to go home, and quite frankly so did I! \n\nMy dad said to give them another try.... I did. \n\nThe second time my daughter really wanted to go for her birthday. Once seated, it took forever to get service. Finally someone brought salsa and chips, then a huge long wait for the waitress to come to the table. When the waitress finally came, our order was taken and it took over 20 minutes to get our drinks! When the food finally came out, the beef in the chimichangas was tough, I had to ask for the side of sour cream and guacamole over 3 times before it was brought out, the guacamole had zero flavor, worst meal ever! We needed refills on the drinks and chips, again good luck getting service from your waitress or the front of house. I asked 3 different people for boxes to go, that took over 15 minutes to get! Took another 15 minutes after that just to get the bill! When I got home, I fed the leftovers to the chickens! \n\nAfter this, I was never going back! \n\nDad just drove in from CA and the first place he wanted to go was here... I told him it would be a mistake... it was!\n\nAgain, hard to get service. There are about 10 tables and 4 waitresses! We placed our order, waited so long for our drinks that the basket of chips was almost gone before they arrived. Dad had the chile rellenos with a side of beans w/enchilada sauce and corn tortillas, I had a cheese enchilada w/beans and a side of sour cream. The chile rellenos were a mish mash of peppers and no cheese in sight, they did not put the enchilada sauce on the plate, forgot the sour cream, the beans were horribly over salted and did not bring the corn tortillas until the meal was almost done. Tried to get someones attention, anyone's attention to get a to go box! We left w/o the box. \n\nThis was a different waitress each time I went. I am so disappointed that customer service from the waitresses and front of house is non existent, so not customer friendly anymore! The food is also not what it use to be either! \n\nDad said I was right! We will never be going back!", "business_id": "hWhVP-28LYP3llaMlAJ_JA", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-12-20", "type": "review"}

The best part about it was the freshness and cleanliness of the dish. However, the serving was barely enough. Other menudo specialty restaurants serve a bottomless bowl for 50 cents less and it's usually as good or better tasting..\nThe service at Rosita's is the worst. When we arrived it took a few minutes for the waitress to arrive. She brought 2 forks, 1 knife and chips and salsa. No water.  She left and returned about 7 minutes later with pad and pen in hand. She asked us what we wanted to drink and my daughter ordered a soft drink and I ordered a Chelada.  I also asked for waters.  She asked my daughter what she wanted to order. My daughter asked me if we are ready and the waitress told my daughter \"You order now.\"  We ordered.  Several minutes later we got our drinks and 1 glass of water.  The Chelada tasted more like a Bloody Mary and I only drank 1/2.  \nThe food arrived and our order was right. My daughter had a beef Chimichanga with rice and beans. Over priced at $12 but the flavors were outstanding. Especially the beans and rice.  As mentioned earlier, the Menudo was fantastic but the portion left me wanting more.\nAs we were eating I called across the room for an order of Pozole to go.  My waitress replied from across the room \"Let me check.\"  She did not ask me if I wanted red or white, beef or pork, and flour or corn tortillas.  Yet when she brought me the to go bag I asked if it was red and if she included flour tortilla.  She replied they only sell red and she put flour tortilla as I had requested. Again I hadn't been offered a choice.  When my wife ate the Pozole she discovered the tortillas were corn. Also, the Pozole had only 2 pieces of meat and the hominy was hard.\nFinally, the check was scibbled and illegible. I was charged $40.65 for 2 bowls of basically soup,  a fried burrito with beans and rice, and a beer and soda.\nI wouldn't mind paying $40 if the Pozole had been as good as the Menudo.

I wanted to be able to walk back and fourth for a couple days. Upon check in I was greeted with zero smiles, and made to feel more like he was doing me a huge favor. The older gentlemen with white hair was very very clear that this was not a \"party\" motel. And that we will get removed immediately if there was even 1 complaint? I found this interesting since I am a mellow 45 year old who does not appear to be a partier in the least bit. He then went over the no smoking policy and that we'd be charged $150.00 cleaning deposit if we smoked. Even though the office smelled of cigarette smoke. LoL....  And nobody in my family smokes. I simply smiled and looked at my wife and said, \"Well, looks like we came to the right place honey\"'\n\nI was utterly disgusted at the layer of filth on the outside of the building. I wiped my finger on the outside windowsill and it turned black. Old gum, some kind of splash stains, trash, all in view on the way to the room.  Every outside plastic trash can within view was barely holding together like they had been run over and stood back up. They are cracked to death and appear to be very old as they are faded? \n\nOne of our rooms (we have older kids with us) reeked of cigarette smoke as we entered. I immediately opened the door and cranked the fan to try and air it out. I noticed the batteries were missing in the smoke alarm. I went to the office to report this and was met with apathy from now a female attendant. She told me she could swap out a room and would call me in 20 minutes. I told her that I did not want to get charged with a smoking violation. We went back and hung out in our other room. DISGUSTING. The corners of the rooms floors are filled with lint, dust, and food particles where it looks to never to have been vacuumed.  Stains on the carpet and chair seating area. There were small chunks of seat cushion under the chair in the corner as if had not been moved or cleaned under in a long time.  When I looked behind the tv cabinet in search for an outlet I saw a former tenants Old Spice deodorant covered in dust along with numerous crumpled kleenex? Seriously?  After walking around the room in my socks for about 30 minutes they were black on the bottom. Gross. I can only guess that the cleaning crew blows through each room doing the least amount of work they can. We found evidence that one of our beds sheets had not been changed. \n\nAfter an hour I had never received a phone call that was promised. I went back to the front office for some coffee. The same lady was there and I told her to forget changing our room. And that it had aired out pretty good. I actually just gave up and decided to just try and help my family enjoy our few days here. After dealing with the manager who was very clear that we were here for them, and the condition of the room, I knew trying to get them to see reality would be more frustrating that just letting it go.  So I did. I figured I'd inform possible customers of what they might be getting into. And I honestly hope Super 8 contacts the management here and tries to fix these easily remedied issues. \n\nLater that night after two of my kids showered. their tub (in room 108, the stinking smoke room that still stunk) did not drain. I walked back to the front office and met the lady again. She told me that they only had 1 plunger and that they had given it to another room and that they were asleep already. I now asked for a new room. She told me she would see what she could do and that she would let me know and call me back at my room. I never heard back from them the entire stay. Not to see if we were ok? Not to offer to replace the missing batteries (code violation)?  \n\nThe next morning we tried to enjoy the free breakfast. Ok at least they are trying I guess. But when the OJ ran out the white haired guy fixed it but did not say a word to us as we said thank you. He really makes it clear that he just does not enjoy people. \n\nWe will never stay her again. And I feel like we should get a partial refund. I understand things happen. But this place is a joke. I would be embarrassed to work here. And I refuse to believe management doesn't know what is going on. Just hard to believe people can just not care.\n\nUPDATED JANUARY 26TH.\n    After returning home 3 outta4 of my kids developed little red bites along the backs of their necks, on their sides and on our 2 yr old under his diaper on his belly. We determined that they were in fact bed bug bites.  Fortunitely they did not make it back to our house.

But get there early, I'm pretty sure they close up shop by 9 or 10...", "business_id": "apCfJVnRyaw6oVUBKujpUQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-02-06", "type": "review"}

Given that Yelp never fails, the deceptively named La Tolteca Mexican Foods was presented before us as an attractive option. Hesitant as to whether it was actually just a Mexican grocery store, we hustled in to see what the buzz was about. Now, I know I live in the Northeast (veritable Mexican food desert), but \"Oh. My. Gahhhhhhhhhhhhh...\" This place is amazing. \n\nOne of the most appealing things to me about La Tolteca was its no-nonsense approach to everything. Food is ordered from a board menu above a counter and prepared in a small kitchen area in front of you. Slightly further back lies the grocery store component which does have an interesting (Maybe typical for Phoenix, but what do I know?) variety of Mexican groceries and specialties to recommend it. Back to the food though... that really was the main event. I ordered a chicken burrito which came out quickly and was f---ing enormous. Imagine the beams of light shining down from above when I turned around a spotted the salsa bar! I was able to taste all of their salsas including the piquant green chili pepper one which I am still thinking about. There's a vast dining area to the back where you can bring your food and beverage to gorge and take in this amazing experience. Maybe I just love Mexican food too much... Who knows, but I was really a happy camper here. \n\nWe looked over and spotted some people eating burritos that were literally the size of loaves of Wonder Bread, so consider that as one more reason to go (though even I, self-proclaimed food eater extraordinaire could not fathom eating one of those). The prices are ridiculously cheap, and the food was amazing, flavorful and truly memorable.

On Google it's rated 5 stars.  Here it's 4 stars.  And only a single dollar sign!  So we drove over.\n\nThe place looks like something you might find in Mexico.  No hostess.  Walk up to the counter, order your food, wait for your number to be called, walk into the dining area (ducking under a low arch if you over 6' tall) where you are greeted with basic tables and chairs.  Seriously...if you didn't know you were in Phoenix you'd swear you were in an eatery in Mexico.  They also have a bakery and a market attached to the food counter.\n\nOn to the actual food.  As this was my first time here I ordered the chimi.  I usually do that so I have a basis for comparison to other places.  My wife had the albondigas soup.  We both liked our dishes.  The chimi was done perfectly.  A light crunch of the shell.  Not overcooked, not greasy.  The chicken was moist and tender.  And it was a pretty big chimi.  I think one does need to add some pico to it because the chicken's seasoning was very mild.  The pico added just a bit of flavor that really made the difference.  And the Mexican rice was very nice.\n\nI wish it wasn't so far from home (Gilbert) because I'd love to make this my \"regular\" spot for Mexican food.  I would say it blows away just about every place else I've found in the Valley, and is neck-and-neck with Guerrero's (in Tempe).

Of course, since we were in no rush to go back to the office, we sat around and talked for another 35 minutes.\n\nThe lunch specials are cheap. Like $5 or under cheap. The portions are also a reasonable size, so it's a good deal for $5.  The corn soup was...interesting to say the least. Not something that I enjoyed at all.  I had the cashew chicken as my meal (it's not on the lunch special menu)...large portion, tender chicken, and lots of cashews. I didn't care for the light sauce very much actually and was disappointed when there were no green peppers in the dish. Also, the carrots tasted a bit off to me.  My co-workers all enjoyed their dishes, which included sweet and sour chicken and peking duck.  The bill for the five of us (including tip) was $40.

Now I order this every time (the dry version).\n\nI really like the Wunan Beef.  And the twice cooked pork.  Didn't like the black bean chicken, was bland, but I probably could have spiced it up with their condiments.  \n\nThis is my new go to for take out.  \nGive it a try, I think you will be happy.  Just wish they delivered.\n\nOh - and the first time I went, there was about 3 cop cars out front, very good sign!  If the cops and firefighters eat there, it must be good.  Especially when there is more than 1 car, that means they met there on purpose... even better sign of good food!  And they have brown rice, not everybody does yet.", "business_id": "ykfTh6HI219NoMsWBxulxw", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-02-05", "type": "review"}

You go to a restaurant you \"super-like' and then upon your return it fizzles out like a second rate firecracker.  \nThe last time this place got 5 stars from me.  Here's what happened last night.  \n\nWe started off with an order of two soups:  Egg drop and Wonton.  I remembered the fabulousness of the wonton soup in the past.  Delicate, very delicate wontons in an extraordinarily delicious broth.  Couldn't wait to taste it again. Ordered Chow Mein with beef which came with brown sauce. Told the waitress to keep the brown sauce separate.  She said she didn't quite think she could do this.  She said she could give me the noodles separate, the beef separate and the brown sauce separate.  I asked, \"Couldn't you do the noodles with the beef and just the sauce separately?  She said she would have to talk to the cook as he has never done this before.  Reminds me of the movie \"FIVE EASY PIECES\" with Jack Nicholson.  He asked for a tuna on toast and the waiter said he could have a tuna sandwich but not on toast because they don't have tuna on toast on the menu.  I will say no more.  You just HAVE TO watch the movie.  \n\nWe also ordered orange chicken and asked if we could have it without breading and very spicy.  She said yes. We added an order of fried tofu which came with a sauce similar to the ones served with dumplings.  The soups arrived and the wonton soup was not what I remembered it to be.  (You guys are not going to start questioning my memory are you?)   The broth was mediocre and while the wonton were delicate, they were not flavorful.  Hubby said the egg drop soup was OK. (that means not so good in husband-speak).  The orange chicken arrived as requested, no breading. But with no spice.  He had to add spice from a metal jar on the table which was nothing more than pepper flakes in oil.  Does anyone want to consciously add oil to their food?  Don't most of us try to avoid adding calories if possible?  The preferred method to add spiciness to a dish is for THE COOK to saut\u00e9 the meat WITH HOT PEPPERS thereby imparting a nice overall spiciness to the dish.  But this was not to be so spicy oil it was.  Remarkably, the beef chow mein arrived with noodles & beef together and the brown sauce separately. Amazing.  IT COULD BE DONE!  Is this NOBEL prize worthy?  The chef was actually able to serve noodles & beef together and the sauce separately????!!   Should we be sharing this accomplishment with other restaurants or with the FOOD NETWORK?    I marveled at the large amount of \"brown sauce\" they put on the side.  What exactly is in that brown sauce.? I'm afraid to ask.  But it seems that this brown sauce is their \"go to\" sauce for almost every dish.  Back to the dish.  The chow mein noodles were totally dry but the beef was moist enough to eat.  I now understand the purpose of the brown sauce--basically it wets down dry food, in this case the noodles.  I ate some of it but will tell you now that I would not ever order this dish again.  The fried tofu came out in blocks resembling kids play blocks; maybe a bit smaller.  Not greasy but not the most pleasant tasting tofu I've had either.  The soy-sauce based sauce that came with it is a MUST HAVE if there is any chance of you swallowing this tofu.  Another dish I would not order again.  Don't get me wrong.  I eat tofu.  I like tofu.  I order tofu all the time (and eat it).  It's just that the preparation in this tofu dish was really, really lacking.  \nAnd now for the good parts.  The portions are very generous.  The waitress was very nice and wanted us to accommodate us at the table of our choice since the TV was showing football and hubby's eyes immediately went to the screen.  (Gee, how unusual. ) Finally the pricing is very reasonable.  You can't go wrong with the prices, but then again you can't go right with the food either.  I, for one, am not returning.", "business_id": "ykfTh6HI219NoMsWBxulxw", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-01-11", "type": "review"}

What I find is the same old thing and more often than not- covered in dust. \n\nWhen I first walked into Pico Rico I was so please with the selection. Every row I went down I saw something new. There were plenty of varieties so even if it's not for a kids birthday party you'll find something great. Whenever I go back they always have new pinatas I hadn't seen before and something special for whatever holiday is near. The Christmas pinata I bought there was beautiful and unique, I got compliments on it. Their pinatas are very well made. I stuff them with at least 15 lbs. of goodies and they always hold up. On cheaper pinatas the wire will come out when there's too much weight inside. \n\nOther than pinatas they also have a huge selection of Mexican candy, some decorations and balloons.

Uptight religious types are nowhere to be found in this free spirited atmosphere, and that deserves a couple of stars alone. This is the third Exotic Art Show I have attended, and I have to be honest in saying 2008's was my least favorite. The cold may certainly have dampened the vibe (where were the portable heaters?), or maybe the acts were less to my personal liking. Miss Satanica, an eater of fire and glass, was great (and quite the trooper for continuing her show in spite of an injured ankle), but her weird lame sidekick did nothing for her. Of the Earth musicians had talent, but also oozed pretention and sounded like Rusted Root. Even the Ringmaster, Nick Tarr, was funnier last year. Some of the dancers were amazing, especially Fatima from Spell, and Jen from Of the Earth. I wished they had been on far longer. \n\nThe pieces in the art exhibit itself always vary wildly, from tame and classically beautiful, to the uber-graphic, violent, or decidedly non-vanilla fetish.  My personal favorites this year were Christian Correra (amazing frames as well as photography) and Sarah Clemens (whose gorgeous \"Breezy\" graced the cover of the program, and whom I luckily got to meet). \n\nIf you've never been, plan ahead for the Halloween party. It is a lot of fun in my experience, and is their other wild-side party of the year.

Just beyond the back porch you will find a table where you can purchase tickets for alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages.

I was turned on to the Welcome Diner by a classmate at a software training I was attending, I said I was a food nerd and he told me that these guys were reopening today!\nSolid yelp reviews sold me, and they did NOT disappoint.\nThey opened at 5:00, but I got off of class at about 4:15, so I went down there and hung around for a bit. After unsuccessfully attempting to help out with their square credit card thing (they can take cards, but it'll show up as the food truck because the restaurant account isn't setting up properly), I placed my order. I was the first customer, yay! Amazingly, the only other opening day jitter I saw was the ricecooker being ornery and tripping the circuit breaker repeatedly. In terms of \"disasters\" that's a pretty minimal one. I chose to wait for the rice to finish and get my meal all together, as I needed to burn time to avoid getting out of central Phoenix back to Tucson at rush hour.\nI had the port of call burger and a side of red beans and rice (the ricecooker worked in the end).\nBest burger I've had, I think ever. All the ingredients were high quality, very nice cheddar cheese, mushrooms cooked with port, and garlic aioli. And the bun. Oh damn, the bun. Feathery is the best adjective. No unevenness in texture, light, and just barely strong enough to contain the burger... well maybe not entirely contain.\nThe red beans and rice were good - I'm not well versed in the craft of that dish, but it was tasty.\nBoth the other customers that ordered inside got the fried chicken biscuit sandwich with apple butter made by one of the staff. They seemed very happy with their choices.\n\nThey've got beer, wine, and hurricanes. Right now they're open Thursday-Saturday 5:00-10:00pm for dinner, and Saturday and Sunday from 10:00-3:00pm for brunch. I snuck a peek at the brunch menu, and there looked to be some tasty stuff there too. They're going to work on expanding dinner service out over more of the week gradually.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are you doing?\nYeah. \nYou.\nWhy are you still reading this?\nGo get a burger or something from here.\nBlah blah blah it's Tuesday at 9am and they're not open, sure, whatever, maybe that excuse will fly with your family, but not here mister/missy.", "business_id": "tb24fvNJfHhyKEXkKn12Xw", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-01-31", "type": "review"}

I want to totally love this, but frankly, Phoenix is still missing the traditional diner, even when it's housed in an authentic diner. I was hoping this would be the epic college hang-out, but it's too expensive for that. An 8 buck burger is three dollars away from a night out for a collegiate. 5 bucks for a 12 oz plastic cup pour, even a good draft, is still not in that ballpark. Actually, it's close to ballpark pricing. Knock off at least a buck.  And 4 dollars for a very small portion of collard greens will not bring me back to eat it.\n\nI ordered the most expensive meal because I wanted the food experience. Their PB and B burger is exceptional, peanut butter with burger sounds weird, but it's damn tasty and good Schrieber's bacon(also used at Bill Johnsons Big Apple for less dinero). It's the highest price burger at $12.50. I also had the previously mentioned collard greens and a 7 buck Hurricane, tasty and well-mixed, almost at price point correctly with such good ingredients.\n\nThree items and with tip, over $28.00.  This falls into the realm of special event for me, and that's a shame as the folks running the kitchen, taking orders, owners are ALL great and the service was really casual yet efficient.\n\nI would love to see something like a whiskey and soda for $4.00, discounted pitchers of beer, maybe even a discount for bringing in your own coffee cup or dishes as there really is a lot of plastic waste coming out of there.\n\nSure, I'll be back, and for what it is(an amazing restoration of a wonderful place with a killer patio)I'm glad it's here.

I don't like coming in here any kind of inclement weather because pretty much all of the seating is outside, which is a bummer at night or during the summer. Also, because the kitchen is so small and Welcome Diner is so popular, you may end up waiting 40 minutes for your food.\n\nBut....what saves Welcome Diner for me is the food. I love the fried chicken and the sausage biscuits and gravy. The sandwiches are also excellent! The orange juice is fresh-squeezed and refreshing, but the lemonade is on the bitter side and leaves something to be desired. I'd recommend the food at Welcome Diner to anyone, but the atmosphere isn't always a crowd-pleaser. I would love to see them in a brick and mortar, full-service restaurant!

It's possibly because I was hoping to keep them my little secret. These guys took their Old Dixie food truck and took over this unique and eclectic location that has been home to other popups over the last couple of years. Inside seating is VERY limited 8 built in stools against a small counter. I love sitting inside but I often enjoy their out door seating during the summer and especially on these beautiful Phx winter nights. [They do lunch and brunch as well.] \n\nThe Food: I have enjoyed everything I have tried here. They are known  for their biscuits, which are fairly large, sturdy enough to be used in their biscuit sandwiches but tender enough to enjoy with their homemade honey butter (the honey sourced from a small apiary in the neighborhood) or house made jelly/preserves or apple butter. Many of their veggies are often sourced out of the community garden when possible. They source locally as much as possible, and their menu adjusts seasonally, while keeping some of their popular favorites. They always offer vegetarian options and occasionally even vegan. [Skip the goat cheese on the beet tureen salad and that is a yummy vegan option]  \nThey make all food to order and honor substitutions or additions within reason.  Heck, for dinner one night I ordered their biscuit with goat cheese and smoked apple butter (found on the dessert menu) and asked if they could add bacon.  They gave me a bit of a raised eyebrow as they found the request unique and gladly served it up (and it was SOOO good) \n\nMy favorites:\nAnything with their fried chicken. \nAnything with their biscuits. \nTheir french fries are  hand cut and fabulous. \nThey smoke their own meats  (and sometimes apples for their smoked Apple butter) so try the Carolina or any smoked  sausage, pork chop, etc. that shows up on the specials board. \nTheir burgers rock! (YOU HAVE to try the PB&B, well unless you have a peanut allergy). \nTheir salads are lovely and tasty. \n\nThey offer some select cocktails and a limited choice of liquor. But this doesn't matter because all you need to know is get a HURRICANE (or 3). You'll thank me later.", "business_id": "tb24fvNJfHhyKEXkKn12Xw", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-01-20", "type": "review"}

Oh and if the husband gets the biscuits and gravy.... Put a little gravy on that sandwich and it's heavenly. Plus, they give you real cream for your coffee... Did you hear me? Heavy fricken cream!!! So good. Make sure you follow these guys on facebook for their beautiful daily specials that you wouldn't find in any other diner in the world (fresh made chicken and dumplings with butter poached chanterelle mushrooms for example).

But where there is jackfruit I will follow.\n\nWelcome Diner on Roosevelt and 10th Streets sells a lot of burgers and booze but they also offer a jackfruit po'boy ($8) and several other interesting veggie dishes.\n\nEven though I fancy the taste of sweet, juicy, ripe jackfruit, it's also scrumptious when cooked and used like a vegetable.  This is the fourth spot where I've had jackfruit in a sandwich (or taco) and 'twas delicious.  \n\nPaired with a cabbage slaw that adds crunch to the 'wich, the flavor was mild and hearty.  I requested no BBQ sauce because that sickly sweetness would have disturbed the taste of the fruit.  My only regret is no side was included in the price.\n\nWelcome Diner also sells a fried green tomato sammich. ($8.5)  Doesn't that sound delicious? \n\n[crickets]\n\nDoesn't it?  Okay, well maybe it's just me.  And lesson learned:   \"Sounding\" delicious and tasting delicious are two entirely different senses.  The sourdough was oily, toasted with a few slices of breaded fried tomatoes laid in-between.  And a fried tomato is...well...it tastes...uhhhh...urrrr...well...well, at least it's a vegetable, damn it Janet.  \n\nNo side either.   If it wasn't for the arugula, corn relish, and ranch dressing on the sandwich, it would have been a complete disappointment.  Ya' hurd meh?  Complete. Disappointment.   \n\nAnd so TOMATO gets added to the list of things that should not be fried and passed off as food.  (That list is quite long, but let me not diverge from the review.)\n   \nAnyway, I will return someday for another jackfruit po'boy, but at $8 bucks with no side, my next visit won't be too soon.", "business_id": "tb24fvNJfHhyKEXkKn12Xw", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-01-29", "type": "review"}

Little old me, drinking at the Bikini Lounge from 2 in the afternoon until midnight with 3 friends.  Drinking, drinking, drinking.  So after 10+ hours of living solely off of beer, there can surely be no better idea than going to a strip club.  Right?\n\nSo we pack up and head on over.  A high cover (sorry, for the life of me I don't remember how much) and a 2 drink minimum (which I do realize is standard) later, we're immersed in black light.  As my eyes adjust, I start to see that this is really not the crowd I expected to see in a strip club.  There is ZERO energy.  No talking.  No laughing.  Nothing but rows of guys sitting and looking blankly at the dancers.\n\nWe found some empty chairs in the back, and settled in there, and I was able to turn my attention to the girls.  Ok, look:  I know they can't all be Elizabeth Berkley (may the Lord keep her feisty Nomi Malone safe and warm forever).  But I didn't expect this apathy.  Bored looking women taking their short turns on the small round main stage, and more bored looking women walking around offering lapdances in vain.  The thing about stripping is this:  I thought the point was that you could make a lot of money.  But we were there at midnight on a Saturday night, and these girls were getting NOTHING.  In the hour we were there, I saw ONE man put money in a girl's pants on stage... and I watched, and it was a one dollar bill.  Seriously.\n\nI sat there with my 3 friends (2 men, one other woman), all of us in a row, all of us suddenly sober, staring with our eyes and mouths wide open.  I could feel my male friends' good mood deflate (ha!  don't be dirty), as my girl friend and I felt like gender traitors just by being there.\n\nI thought these kind of places were supposed to be rowdy and fun.  Was I expecting too much?  It was the most depressing experience.   I sort of feel bad even writing this, because nobody involved with that joint can be happy, I'm sure.

We were allowed in after a quick bag check by a bouncer. Another bouncer was nice enough to get us a few tables front and center stage. The service was good and fairly quick considering the number of people in the bar.

That is not my review, but rather what is written on the side of the Ranch Market building. After reading other reviews of this place, I already had a feeling it was going to be good...but the Paradise Market...hmmm... Made me ask myself what my idea of a paradise market would be. ( In case you were wondering, it would include Gael Garcia Bernal, Alejandro Fernandez, Juanes and other latinos guapos pushing shopping carts... shirtless.)\n\nAnyway...focus!...Walking in from the parking lot, I could already hear lively music spilling out of the store. My blood started to sizzle with excitement. Then, right after crossing the threshold, I beheld a thing of dazzling beauty- carts and carts of aromatic and fresh pan dulce. I knew this place and I were just beginning a long and promising relationship. \n\nMy roommate and I wandered around the pan dulce display cases, salivating, pointing, giggling. We opted not to purchase as we have way too many holiday sweets left over as it is. We continued on to the jugeria where I had the best horchata I have had in a long, long time. Too much of the time horchata is watery. The Ranch Market horchata was so flavorful and creamy. I drank it just like a little kid who doesn't even let the straw leave their mouth for a moment. \n\nWe then wandered throughout the whole store. I know I probably looked awe-struck because it is overwhelming. It is bustling and frenetic and packed full of food treats, smells, conversation...LIFE. Be sure to pass by the tortilleria and take in the smell of freshly cooked tortillas. Also, don't miss the meats! Chicken feet! Tongue!  Tripas! Oh yeah! AWESOME! \n\nWho the hell would ever want to go to a Safeway again when shopping can be this entertaining?\n\nI'll be sure to go back soon for some pan dulce, a raspado or some lunch.

Forget the upscale breakfast and faux southwest shops that dot and line Scottsdale. Forget the 'burbs of Peoria, Goodyear, and East Mesa. Don't let your visiting family leave without making a trip down to the Phoenix Ranch Market on 16th st and Roosevelt. Yes, this is south of the I-10 freeway and far away from your faux mexican food at Macayo's Cantina. At Phoenix Ranch Market you'll find a side of the city that nearly all of the transplanted surburban population seems to want to ignore, or just completely forget. This is Phoenix being Phoenix, not Phoenix trying to be a new Los Angeles or anyplace else.\n\nAfter having breakfast at a carbon copy brunch eggery, I was in need of something less perfect and faux. I found exactly what I was craving. When you can hear the sounds of mariachi or radio campesina from your car parked at the other end of a packed lot, you know this isn't the local Kroger you're about to enter.\n\nPart grocery store, part food court, part village market, PRM is huge, it's overwhelming and it's surprisingly clean and comfortable - this isn't a low rent grocery like Food City. With a fresh seafood section two or three times the size you'd find anywhere else in Phoenix, and with parts of animals you've probably never prepared at home, it's fun to just look, but even more fun to buy. Want meat? Want better options? Better cuts? Want an entire skinned cow's head with the eyes intact and staring at you? Check. It's all SO GOOD.\n\nBut that's just the meats. They make their own tortillas onsite with a literal factory and small army of workers churning out the flat corn and flour awesomeness. Hungry? Want mexican food? Want great mexican food? ALWAYS consider going here. Think of anything on a restaurant menu and you have it here. Prepared fresh, and a la carte. Seriously. Tamales of any kind. Horchata! Cow Tongue! Burritos of immense size and stuffed with anything you want. Some of the best beans in town, rice, and parts from a pig that still actually look like parts from a pig. This isn't the mall food court.\n\nThe place is packed with mostly hispanic families but you'll also notice a few adventurous types, including my asian self. Most of the employees speak english very well so language is not a barrier. The only times you'll need help is when asking what is that? And like mentioned above, the answer just might be cow tongue (which by the way, is good, however I can see how the texture would turn some people off. Imagine a soft almost too mushy beef...)\n\nOh. The food is also cheap. You'll get more than full off of $5, you'll explode at $10. It's seriously like heaven here. Music, people, atmosphere, food, drinks, desserts, baked goods. All of it awesome. I met up with my friend Amy.The.Kidd for 'lunch' and we ended up spending almost 4 hours just walking around, back and forth, trying each new item we found, or trying the standards but knowing they were going to be better here. Mmmm. Horchata, great corn tamales, rice, beans, empanadas, warm fresh tortillas... bring everyone. This is a place that should be in people's minds when they think of Phoenix, not just the golf courses, or upscale Scottsdale, or Frat/Sorority Tempe... but South Phoenix. No matter how scary it is for suburban soccer moms to venture down there.\n\nPhoenix Ranch Market on 16th St and Roosevelt.

Sick to where I had to wait outside by the car for my company. Hilarious. Needless to say I was a little frightened, so it took a little while for the curiosity to pique again. \n\nSecond time was yesterday evening. Perhaps it was because instead of being a busy Saturday it was a slower (still busy, though) Tuesday that I was able to survive this visit. The boy decided to use it for a school project so I tagged along to see if I could help. The second we walked in the door however, all hope in my helping him was lost. My mind was in a frenzy as I decided where to stop first. The Jugeria for some Horchata? Or the restaurant for some asada? Or maybe the bakery for something sweet...? \n\nFound out the Horchata is way too sweet (but delicious) to drink alone so I shared with the boy. Grabbed some kind of sweet roll from the bakery that we practically fought over...and oh my! It was Taco Tuesday at the restaurant! I ordered 4 asada tacos for $2.99 and thanked the lord my boy is a vegetarian. Best carne asada ever! \n\nAnd the atmosphere in here is great. Oh! And they're open late. 6a-11p.

Today I finally made the trip inside the store, rather than just going to the restaurant on the side. It was too early for lunch at Tradiciones so in I went. I knew that the market had a lot going on at all times; I nearly run down at least 6 people getting in and out of the parking lot and I'm a really good driver (seriously-not Raymond from Rain Man good, but actually good!). The parking lot on the store side is always packed.\n\nSo the focus of my trip was the cucina. It was bustling for lunch already at just 10:30. So as I'm trying to make sense of the menus posted in both Spanish and English on the wall above the hot food line or whatever, I am greeted by a nice woman that helps me decide where to go. She mentioned sopes first, so that's what I started with.\n\nMy order was way too much food for one, but I wanted to try a couple of things. So I got both a chicken and a steak sopa, a street taco al pastor (pork), and a side of beans. They did have combos unlike another reviewer said but I only wanted to add beans an opted for a side instead. My total for food was $11.00. Not super cheap, but like I said more food than I would normally order at once.  \n\nSo a sope for those unfamilar is not a torta as someone else said. It's more like a weird tostada or open faced sandwich. The base is somewhere between a corn tortilla and an all out bread. It does appear to be flash fried to cook but I'm not totally sure and it didn't feel greasy. The sides are curved to make a small cup to fill with beans, meat of choice, topped with shredded lettuce, grated cojita cheese (I'd describe Mexican parm--hard salty and good!!) The chicken and steak were both tasty. The steak was a little strung together if you will. I'd rather have seen it be chopped better so I would be easier to eat smaller bites. If your teeth didn't make it through that bite, a big chunk was coming along with it. Sorta messy but good though I felt like my sopa was a bit tougher than it should be and my extra cheap plastic fork would bend to the will of the sope.\n\nThe street taco was just so I could taste the al pastor. Two tiny corn tortillas topped with a bit of pork. I topped it with onions and cilantro and would totally eat the al pastor in another dish. \n\nBeans. Not a really a fan. They lacked the taste of say Carolina's beans though the texture matched. A disappointment. \n\nSalsa bar was good. Hot green and red, and the pico was spicy too. Fresh onions and chopped cilantro are a must so it was good to have those. \n\nAgua Fresca...Just love it. I had the fresh guava juice. So tasty and well worth the additional $2.91 I spent for the 32oz drink. \n\nTotal food and drink, $13.91. A little spendy for lunch served in stryo while seated on a bench, but it was fun and I will order a little differently next time so it won't be as expensive and I won't order more food than I can eat.\n\nMarket, looks good. Great looking bakery (really), meat counter, tortilla factory, etc. I'll probably not go out of my way to get there for things I can buy at Food City on a regular day. This does look like a fun way to go get some lunch before you shop for dinner on a weekend. I'll definitely take others for hot food and a fun people watching experience, plus pick up a few goods on the way. \n\nI don't really know about authentic. It's probably not. I don't really care. My dad's family is from near the Mexican border and though I've been to mercados in Mexico and even here, I liked that this place is busy and clean. Campy, sure.

After you pick up your favorite fruit drink head over to the grill for some carne asada street tacos, but only order two because you'll want to save room for the seafood bar where you will find a deliciouso shrimp ceviche at a very reasonably price.

I missed the call and didn't hear the voicemail until an hour or so later, but they still had slot available and were at the house within an hour.  To my embarrassment the source of the knocking noise coming from the fridge was just the  metal lever in the un-connected ice maker that had been knocked into the \"on\" position by frozen foodstuffs  - it periodically trying to gauge level of non-existent ice in tray and banging as it scraped past food blocking it on the way down,  Scheduler was polite, professional, and pleasant to speak with.

The terms of the home warranty specify that the contract holder is responsible for the cost of the service call up to the $85 deductible, which becomes the default amount  - though for customers off the street, the charge is significantly less - by $20 or more - that however, may be more appropriately laid at the foot of the warranty company and the terms of the contract than this provider who provided amazingly rapid response to our self-created illusion of a problem.", "business_id": "5CfsPNHmj7J8l1qXk-USsw", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-01-15", "type": "review"}

This explains why the business does a few things differently than regular retail. Purses/bags either need to be left in your car, or the store will lock them up in the front. I recommend you bring your purse/bag inside, the staff is cool, and they will lock it up for you. While this may be an inconvenience , the price difference will easily make up for any hiccups.\n\nThe second tip that will save you time/energy is to know what you wish to purchase, and know how much it will cost. As mentioned before, it is a warehouse, and items are not labeled with price, it's a huge warehouse setup. They have catalogs all over the place to check prices, but my recommendation is to bring your catalog with pages marked of the stuff you want. The staff is super friendly, and will help you with where things are at. It's not always easy to know who works there, but you will figure it out, they're usually pushing metal carts, basically fulfilling online orders by pulling merchandise from the bins.\n\nWhile you're here, you will find toys, brushes, shampoos, snacks, you name it! The prices are very very good, and you will be happily surprised at the difference between the other guys and Ryan's. Don't miss the kong squeaky toy line, they have fun squeaky toys that are hard to break. Also, the fleecy rope toys are great for dogs teeth, and keep them fresh and so clean clean. Avoid any rope toys, they can break down and when dogs eat them, they can do big time damage to stomach, GI etc.\n\nHappy shopping, and lastly you CAN bring in your dog and have a helper while you shop.", "business_id": "Dj3i6a_vboALYTRKTmBABQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-12-26", "type": "review"}

Ma'am?!\"  the first time. (GRAH, don't call me \"ma'am\", I'm only 21, dammit!)   \nWhen I did hear her and turn around, she told me I had to leave my purse up front, which REALLY, REALLY ticked me off. I carry a very expensive bag and it usually has a very expensive phone and wallet full of cash in it. I do not let it out of my sight, ever. Ask any girl - being asked to leave your purse with someone just makes us uncomfortable. \n\nAside to the owner/managers:\nDear Ryan's, I'm sorry you have been stolen from, but that's a hard fact of retail business. Maybe 1 in 500 people will steal and it's not as big a deal as you're making it out to be, ya cheapskates. You can absorb a $3 toy here and there. It's really insulting to be treated as untrustworthy and a criminal when you haven't done anything.\n\n(The purse bit set the tone for the whole trip). \n\nThe place was very dim (I know it's a warehouse, but it shouldn't be a 2/5 on the light intensity scale).\n\nThe prices were maybe $1.50 below retail stores at the most. It really wasn't worth the drive for us to save that... If you live 10 minutes away, sure. \n\nThere were a ton of business-dressed shoppers who seemed miffed at my dog being with us (ew, dog hair in the air!), and at one point we were down an aisle and turned to see about 5 shoppers and employees all standing at the entrance, staring at us. I felt like I was in Children of the Corn, when the girl turns to see all the kids murderously watching her.... It was super creepy.\n\n80% of the stock was stuffed toys and dog clothing. My dog's mouthiness and chewing power would make a great white shark jealous, and he needs tough toys... A stuffed skunk ain't gonna cut it. I saw nothing truly suitable, unless we somehow missed it (and we walked through twice).\n\nTo top it off, they only carried 3 of the puzzle type toys, when they showed a dozen on their website. Nothing like driving to central Phoenix from Scottsdale and not having what you came for. Again, we looked everywhere in the warehouse and didn't see any more.\n\nWe left with the \"Dog Tornado\" (which is quite fun) and a knotted rope that looked pretty tough, but my dog has had it for about 30 minutes and has chewed halfway through the knot in the middle...

But Guanaquito's yucitas brought back fond memories of the campo and drunken evenings sitting in Pio Pio in David. A mixed message for most, I'm sure, but for me it was all good.\n\nThe staff was awesome, explaining for us gringos how to enjoy the fare. And we did enjoy.

It felt a little creepy, but still...papusas are calling, so we entered. \n\nIt's a no frills establishment, with a larger variety of foods and papusas than Eliana's. We shared the sampler (for comparisons) and some chicken leg entree...it really wasn't all that interesting. \n\nThe sampler plate was pretty similar to Eliana's, but they give you more (for more money, of course). The papusas, however, were the bomb (do people still use that term? Bomb?). WAAAAY better than Eliana's. And I'm told the ensalda drink was WAAAAY better too, but that is not my cup 'o tea. The tortillas served with the main entree were a little dry, so I'm siding with Eliana's tortillas. Serves was friendly, but not quite the waitress type service you get from Eliana's. We ordered up front, and then sat down. Then the food was brought to us. \n\nSo basically, I still like Eliana's more for their main dishes and tiny cup of chicken soup.

The reason it didn't receive 5 stars is that my wife had the carne asada burrito, and it was just good. Not outstanding. As well, their red salsa, which we received a big to go cup of, tasted a little like pizza sauce. It wasn't very good to us as at all. The guacamole was also good. Lastly, we ordered rice and beans, but arrived at home to find there were none in the bags. I didn't get a receipt, so I don't know if we paid for them or not, but it was okay, because the chips (delicious) and guacamole with the burritos was plenty of food.

I have ordered several things and have not been disappointed, though I will admit I have avoided the crabby benedict so no comment on that one.   Breakfast is filling, many of the items come with the rosemary potatoes and fresh fruit.  And Mimosas are $3. Sign me up!  Service is great and I look forward to going back again and exploring more of the menu.", "business_id": "5-X03Zc0nN7U5eoe8uFUdw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-12-30", "type": "review"}

Although many other items looked tantalizing on the menu, both the lady and I jumped on the opportunity. \n\nThe fish came out perfect, with just the right amount of crunch, and being cooked well enough to have no questions it was done without drying it out.

We have been frequenting this place ever since we moved to the area versus the rare trips we would take for the awesome cream cheese chocolate cake made by Caroline or the lunch Caesar chicken sandwich. Here are my ratings of each dining point I consider when going here:\n\nService: 5/5 Fast and very helpful, Even the chef will dig up custom stuff and cares what people think of the new entrees.\n\nAmbiance: 4/5 The place used to be a home so it's a little cramped but nice nonetheless. Not as comfy as some others like Ticoz but we like it. As it is small\nin seating ranges you can't get too loud so keep the rowdy folks to the Applebees locales.\n\nDrinks: Ginger ale and the kiltlifter is nice as well as the blackwidow and black / blue martinis.\n\nrecommended Food:\nFish 5/5: My girl's favorites are the halibut,swordfish,miso salmon with basmati rice, she also loves the spinach and asparagus.\nSandwiches: 5/5 for roast chicken with green chili, side of coleslaw or balsamic salad 4/5 chicken caesar is good but sometimes is hit and miss\nmeatloaf: 5/5 best I have ever had, it is a beauty.\nTacos: 4/5 One time I had pork tacos they were the best ones I had tasted, the next time they were ok, then the last time they were great, not sure why but still recommended.\nCream cheese cake: 5/5 Made from local baker who used to do deserts for Circa 1900 but now does it for them and Urban Bean to name a few.\nSteak,chicken, pork: 3/5 I have tried each and every one here and while you wont be disappointed there isn't a wow factor like the meatloaf. The sauces seem to not match or compliment the specific meat in my opinion. I would love a bordelaise sauce or onions and mushrooms with the filet for example.\nAppetizers: ?/? I am not a fan of  the bruschetta but haven't tried the rest. I have heard the crab cakes are awesome but have yet to compare them to Fez's awesome versions.\n\n\nPricing is on par with Sophie's but less than Christopher's and more that Ticoz.

No, we didn't have a reservation; it was 11:40 on a Wednesday morning and this isn't Capital City City Grille, lady. And when I told her no, I got the 'look' if you know what I mean (like I'm the idiot). And mind you, even though we didn't leave until 1, only half the tables were ever full. Onto the food: It seemed like a decent menu but the prices were way too high. I ordered a wrap with potato salad ($13 lunch plate price - wow). The wrap was horrible, filled with a very greasy aioli sauce that was dripping out of the overcooked tortilla, but the potato salad was good. We were visited ONCE in the 75 minutes we were there (still snobby, like we were inconveniencing her by being there) and had to track down the waitress in order to get our check. My friend really liked her salad which is the only reason this place is getting two stars instead of one.

I actually started my journey thinking I would stop at the drip. But when i got there that place just seemed to modern for me. I was in a funky mood and just wanted a nice cup of coffee, nothing fancy. So I saw an older man waving a sign that said \"Best lunch in town!\" and he was kind of dancing too!

We had to say good bye to family at the airport, and so wanted a decadent distraction to followup the sadness.  Fancy phosphates and floats served us nicely!\nYou know how classic diners and decor are trendy now, and places are trying to make their restaurants look like they came through a time machine?  Well, this place is the real deal--an authentic 1920's soda shop, now surrounded by a vintage shop (it used to be a drug store).  The place is just wonderful to walk into.  \nOur waitress was unbelievably friendly.  You could tell that the 50's look for her was not just an act--it was her life.  Not only was she friendly, but fast as well.  From the menu, I tried a kiwi phosphate, a tiger's blood (cherry/coconut) Italian soda, tuna sandwich on sourdough, Navy bean soup, and a float to top it off.  All was delicious.  The tuna was not flooded in mayo and was the fattest tuna sandwich I've ever had.  The cole slaw on the side was also a bit dry (little mayo), which to me, is a wonderful thing.  A little pineapple acted to enhance the flavor further.  I am persnickety about slaw, but this I liked.  The drinks were deliciously fizzy.  For desert, we ordered the pumpkin cheesecake bunt cake.  Moments later, the waitress came back to tell us that sadly, she did not have a piece big enough to sell to us, but that there was a small piece left that she could simply give to us for free.  We agreed and added a float for good measure.  The float was pistachio ice cream and amaretto soda.  Unbelievable!  Hands down the best float I've ever had.  And I love that the spoons come in a shot glass of even more soda.  That way, when you eat some of the ice cream, you can add more soda.  Brilliant!  Oh, and the free piece of bunt cake?  It turned out to be the size of a normal piece of cake, but for free.  And it too was delicious.\nThe stores that flank the restaurant served as a good distraction while walking off a few of the hundreds and hundreds of calories consumed.  \nThe only real problem was coming down from the sugar high about halfway between Phoenix and Tucson.  \nI will be back.

(Maybe just an off night. I don't know.) I tried the potato salad that people on yelp rave about and didn't think it was anything to die for. Your only choices are a few sandwiches, hot dogs and a burger which I felt we might have appreciated more for a light lunch than for dinner.\n\nThe dessert was yummy and HUGE and since it was a birthday occasion, it was free!

The girls at the soda fountain were so helpful and super fun! They then proceeded to make me a wedding cake soda! SO GOOD!!!

Once I moved to Phoenix, there has been a great citywide search by a group of us Yumans to find someone here that reminds us of Chili Pepper's marquee entree: The Bean, Rice & Cheese Burrito (not tm). Carolina's came close. Juan's fell decidedly short. A few other run down shacks that we've tried have always been inconsistant or disappointing...\n\nOne slow mid-morning at work we were trying to figure out a good fast place to get takeout and bring back to the office. Someone mentioned Ritos. Someone mentioned that they have the best bean and cheese burrito. My ears perked up. Upon arriving I noticed that they actually have a bean, rice and cheese burrito on the menu, something that most places have never heard of.\n\nThe burrito itself was HUGE. The salsa can be purchased in a large enough container that the whole burrito can be dipped in (don't laugh, this is an important aspect) and provides enough flavor and kick to compliment the beany goodness inside. After going there 3 times in one week, I am ready to declare this place even BETTER than my once perfect Chili Pepper.", "business_id": "Xo9Im4LmIhQrzJcO4R3ZbA", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-12-16", "type": "review"}

Be warned.\n\n3)If you happen to get the burro traditional (without enchilada sauce) try it Gary style.(He's a guy a work) Get a side of rice with your burro and eat directly over the rice bowl because the burro WILL explode  at some point and it is better to catch the molten lava goodness with your rice than on your pants.

I've heard some folks pan on other boards but I just flat out don't get it. For people visiting AZ, this is a must go imo. My relatives visiting from Australia requested it as their last meal on their way out of town.\n\nFirst of all, I'm not a big green chili fan. Second of all, Rito's green chile burro is one of my top 3 bites in all of AZ.\n\nTortillas are amazing (homemade), beans are amazing (I guess I'm still a big fan of lard). Unbelievably, beans seem to get even better when you microwave them from the fridge the next day too.\n\nI love the character of the place. It's run by a mother, her daughters & some other relatives. They do what they do & are who they are & don't really care beyond that. I've heard it compared to the Soup Nazi from the Seinfeld episode. My first visit, I did get that vibe but the ladies have been super sweet many, many times. It is a bit tough to find, they have short hours, they only take cash and as the sign says, do NOT approach the window on your cell phone.  \n\nI think at present they quit making tacos because they were too much work & the mom has had some health issues. So basically you get what you get. I say get the green chile burro.\n\nSo they are who they are & do what they do, take it or leave it. I love it.\n\nAs far as the shop, it's basically just a barred window counter you order from, you pick up your food & go outside & eat on picnic-like tables. \n\nThey are open only M-F from 9 - 5ish. Close even a bit earlier on Fridays I think. \n\nThey're on 14th street just south of Roosevelt right across from the school. You'll just see a screen door & that's it. If it's around lunch time, you'll probably see a line as well.\n\nI think the short hours & no evenings, no weekends even add to the obsession for me. Scarcity makes it even more desired.\n\nRight now, I cannot believe how much I'm craving this food.\n\nBTW, the warning about scalding food & soupy burrito are right on.

But the rice is also very good.  Now the meat they use is big chunks and very tender and the green chili has so much flavor but it is spicy hot for me.  Now I have eaten in a lot of Mexican restaurants trying to get that same taste from other green chili burros and in different states( NM, CA and Texas) but there is no comparison and there \"enchilada style\" is like no other and I doubt u will ever find it like tht anywhere.  It's the cheese,  it's almost like a good pizza combined with the tasty red sauce.  I have tasted some of the other dishes like the tacos which are very good but I wish those were bigger.  I just crave more.  Thts why I always go back to the green burro enchilada style.  It fills u up and it's damn good.  And they finally went plastic.

We were first given a bowl of chips and salsa.  The salsa looked like a mix between red and green salsa, and since I have a weird aversion to green salsa, I hesitantly tried it.  It was delicious, as were the house-made chips.  We ate two bowls immediately because we couldn't stop.\n\nAfter asking the waitress what was best, my fiance decided on the spicy marinated fish, and I on the garlic shrimp.  Holy crap, it was delicious.  The garlic sauce for my shrimp covered everything, from the beans and rice to the secret fries beneath the shrimp (which magically didn't get soggy).  My fiance said his fish was the best he's ever had in America.  Mine also came with tortillas (I chose flour), and they were great, like the kind my mom bought from the \"tortilla lady\" back home.\n\nWe were so full we couldn't move afterward, but I woke up in the morning craving the garlic sauce again...\n\nThe place is small and quaintly decorated, like something you might find in a small town.  We saw lots of families and tables of friends come and go.  The best part is, you don't have to sit and awkwardly wait for your check.  You check out at the desk.\n\nI highly recommend this place for some great mariscos.

The office staff in the pre-op section of the clinic was abrupt and unfriendly much like the reception I received from Dr. Sweeten.  When Dr. Sweeten entered the exam room for my consultation visit, she didn't introduce herself, opting to jump immediately into taking medical history notes.  She was dressed in decorative scrubs, so I just assumed that she was another office staff member.  Dr. Sweeten pulled out a couple of diagrams of the female reproductive organs and began to chicken scratch on them as she described the procedures she intended to perform based on my symptoms.   My inner voice questioned if I was making the right decision, but I was under the gun as the end of my medical plan year ended, so I decided to schedule additional procedures.  As I spoke with the office assistant in charge of scheduling, I mentioned that Dr. Sweeten might want to upgrade her systems in place to describe the procedures to patients.  I politely suggested that the office might want to consider updating their handouts such that Dr. Sweeten doesn't have to write upside-down on the handouts from how the diagrams are oriented, adding that printed information about the procedure would be nice.   The receptionist in the out-patient clinic section of the facility was a little more courteous.  The clinic scheduling system was a nightmare.  I had to wait for more than an hour for both of my procedures as at least ten to fifteen other people waited in the waiting room for either their appointments or to pick patients up.  Once I got back to the exam room to change into a gown, I saw lint balls on the floor and a black handprint on the exam room table.  The clinic staff handed me a plastic milk crate IN which my hospital gown was placed and directed me to place my shoes and clothes.  The clinic staff appeared annoyed that I asked for a different gown that had not been in a crate that others' had already used to place their shoes.  Dr. Sweeten met me in the pre-op waiting area prior to my first proceedure.  In reference to the suggestions I made about her pre-op consultation, she curtly and sarcastically stated, \"I hear that you didn't like my drawings,\" to which I politely responded, \"No I didn't.  I think that you could put together something in Microsoft Word that would look much more professional.\"  I didn't get a response.  The short version of the story is that my period and vaginal discharge continued without interruption for approximately 5 weeks, as the doctor advised.  I then had a \"period\" for one day that included minimal spotting of which I was also advised was possible.  Three months after the procedure, I'm back to having a painful full period with clotting just I had prior to my procedures.  I knew that the return of my period was possible as stated by Dr. Sweeten, but something in the back of my mind wonders...  wonders about a lot of things...", "business_id": "kOT8AO8e1e3J9pUBJ2C7Iw", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-02-01", "type": "review"}

I've always heard it was a wonderful place that is known as one of the best desert gardens in the world.  It truly is a world-class venue.  I guarantee I will be walking these gardens often.  But first I will have to purchase an annual membership because the $18.00 entry fee will get expensive very quickly even though it sure was worth every cent.\n\nThe Desert Botanical Gardens cover about 140 acres located next to Papago Park and the Phoenix Zoo. Established in 1939, the garden now has more than 50,000 plants, about one-third of which are native to the area, including species which are rare, threatened or endangered. Several ecosystems are represented: a mesquite bosque, semi-desert grassland, and upland chaparral.\n\nThe entire venue is impeccably maintained and spotlessly clean!  I can tell the people of Phoenix take great pride in the jewel of the desert. \n\nThe gardens have five trails; the main trail is called the Desert Discovery Loop. Then branching off from this central trail are the plant and people of the Sonoran Desert loop, the Sonoran Desert nature trail, the center for desert living trail and the desert wildflower loop.  \n\nDuring my time spent at the gardens I encountered desert wildflowers, abundant wild life such as humming birds, butterflies, rabbits, roadrunners, ground rodents and countless  varieties of other birds along with herbs and plants used for food, medicine, shelter and other cultural purposes and cactus so many cactus varieties!\n\nThe botanical gardens are so well thought-out that the best way to describe the venue as a whole is simply a work of art!  Oh, did I mention there are wonderful works-of-art scattered through-out the gardens.  Right from the beginning, you know this is someplace special as before you even enter the gardens you come upon a wonderful man made rock formation with three incredible Chihuly glass sculptures titled Desert Towers!\n\nThere is a lot of walking to be done here but the designers have obviously made your comfort a priority.  There are drinking fountains everywhere, several restrooms, a caf\u00e9, nice secluded / shaded sitting areas and benches along all the trails.  \n\nMy recommendation is: make a day of this, take your time, look everywhere, take photographs, have lunch at the patio caf\u00e9, drink lots of water (you are in the desert), put on some comfortable walking shoes and enjoy the show!", "business_id": "qMkIbQFrROSnPaQ7at85-w", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-02-01", "type": "review"}

For example, the 15-foot tall hairy cactus? I don't have to pretend that it's pretty - it's nature, and maybe it was meant to be like that. Cool. The 6 or 7 different exhibits? I don't have to go see all of them in one visit. Or I can. Both options are completely doable. I can get married there. I can have a snack there. I can get a healthy dose of vitamin D there.

They also have some wonderful events there.  My favorite is Corks and Cactus, their wine tasting event, which I attended last weekend.  What could be better than wine tasting followed by wandering around amidst a bunch of cacti?  ;)  One of the best trips I had there was in April one year because so many of the cacti were in bloom.  Prior to that, I don't even think I knew that cacti did bloom!  It's just a great place to be.  If you're local and you haven't been, you need to take advantage of having this place nearby!  Get a list of their events!  I took my boyfriend for the first time, and, once he started walking around, he said that he couldn't believe he'd lived here for 2 years and had never been.  If you're visiting, this is definitely a unique way to explore Arizona--it's the Sonoran Desert compressed into an area that you can walk through in a couple of hours!  But if you're going in or close to the summer, be sure to wear a hat and cool clothes, as there's not much shade.  Also, I would recommend skipping their restaurant, Gertrude's.

This place is fantastic for finding ingredients (regular or hard to find) for homemade Asian food.  The prices are much lower than your local supermarket and the selection is out of control.  I went to pick up some sesame oil and some other random items today and I wondered how I would manage to select one out of the 30 or so different brands and varieties they have.  Luckily, I had a friend with me and we managed to logically deduct ourselves into a selection.  \n\nThe bakery is amazing and everything I've had from there is delicious.  The produce section is vast as is just about every section in the store.  I appreciate that they even have English aisle readings on one side for those of us that can't read characters (Chinese, I think).  Today, the smell was pretty stale-fish-like, but I usually don't find it to be like that.  I have also seen (but not tried) their sushi-grade prepackaged fish cuts.  If I were brave enough to try and make my own sushi (which I am definitely not - let's leave that one to the pros...) I would try it.\n\nThis place is crazy busy pretty much all of the time and the parking lot is 100 times worse.  Make use of the secret underground parking garage with a 3 hour limit.  It's always empty so wither people don't know about it (until I let the cat out of the bag just now) or they are gluttons for the punishment that is the craziness of the parking lot.\n\nIt's a great place and even if you don't have anything in particular you need, browse around and take a chance on something with no English on it.

We had the appetiser sampler which is good to share but might leave you wanting the another pupusa. I'm a fan of the chicken soup you get, but just wish the serving size was slightly bigger.\n\nThe appetizer comes with 3 different items and all are equally tastey (ref. pupusa). They also give you some cabbage salad and a tomato sauce to accompany the items, yum.\n\nMy gf ordered the recommended chicken dish and lurved the hell out of it, I agreed and actually was wishing I'd gotten that instead of the Salvadorian marinated steak, which was good, but paled in comparison to the chicken.\n\nSidenotes: Try the ensalada drink, it's a sweet fruit based drink that comes with slices of apple. Sort of reminds me of drinking a melted otter pop, which as far as I'm concerned is off the proverbial chain. Also served with appetiser and as a sidedish with the food was a bean soup which was good and great for dipping the tortillas in.

And vice versa. \n\nWhere Delhi Palace shines: (within the confines of today's buffet, of course) \nPalak Paneer- even though the paneer was noticeably absent or microscopic\nBengan Bhartha- My eggplant-hating dining companion even liked it. \nMutter Paneer- The one dish with peas that i'll eat willingly. \nThe service- they weren't in your face, but they were around more than most buffet meals. \nThe atmosphere- it's classy without being over the top gaudy. \n\nWhere Flavors of India kicks Delhi Palace's hiney: \nNaan- I prefer the flattened, nearly scorched naan to the fluffy puff that was plopped on the table here. It was fresh though, so bonus points for that. \nTandoori chicken- The flavor was fantastic, but the meat was dry. \nYellow lentil daal- I'll save my colorful description of this one and just leave it at Blech. \nCurry chicken- Where's the spice? Possibly the blandest curry chicken ever. \nThe water- This sounds weird, but every time the server came by to refill water, we ended up with more UFOs (unidentifiable floating objects) in our glasses. \n\nOverall, I think it's a toss-up. The things that I like about Delhi Palace are the things that my old stand by place doesn't do well. I'll definitely be back, but not for the curry or lentils.", "business_id": "_RBUU1y4yJrK0SPAd8z0-w", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-12-29", "type": "review"}

Luckily, my foodie friends aren't liars. \n\nI arrived shortly before the lunch rush. I was greeted promptly and politely. I then asked if the buffet had a large selection of vegetarian options, and he actually gave me a brief but thorough tour of the veggie offerings, which, much to my delight, comprised much of the buffet.

But don't worry, omnivores; there were plenty of delicious-looking meat dishes on the slate as well. \n\nThe food was very tasty, but what makes this place stand up above other Indian buffets was the exceptional, attentive service. A team of servers worked to make sure I received fresh naan with my meal, my water glass was always filled and any questions I had were answered. I don't expect much in the way of help when it comes to buffets, so this was a pleasant surprise. \n\nI will definitely be back one of these days to try something from the menu (bengan bhartha, I'm looking at you).", "business_id": "_RBUU1y4yJrK0SPAd8z0-w", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-02-21", "type": "review"}

We've talked about this place for a while, and I'll be damned if I was leaving AZ before stopping by this place!  So luckily, I was able to convince one of the girls that finals are not as important as saying goodbye to me over a plate of curries.\n\nWe got their around 8 and the place had a good crowd.  We were the only white girls, so we know we were in for a good meal.  Going over the menu took us a while, because one of the girls had no clue what she wanted, and the server was polite enough to let us take our time.\n\nBefore we figured out what we wanted for dinner, of course we had to figure out drinks.  So we all order and still continue to peruse the menu.  Then our drinks came out...huge plus for this place right here, they were huge!  My gin and tonic was in an oversized cocktail glass and my friend's Chardonnay was filled to the brim.  No skimping on alcohol here!  The waiter advised us the drinks were strong, which I was fine with but my girlfriend needed 3 more limes to take hers down.\n\nWe finally end up decided on dinner, with the shahih paneer, chicken saag, and vegetable korma, and an order of garlic naan.  I was a little unsure about the paneer, but my girlfriends swore by it.\n\nWhen the food arrived, we were excited!  Everything smelled so flavorful and the naan was huge, good thing we only got one order.  I loved every single bite I had at dinner, and the feeling was mutual across the table.  All of us ate beyond the point of feeling full, but we couldn't help ourselves!  This food was too good!\n\nLuckily, we were able to stop ourselves and save some food to take home.  I got the chicken saag and I am so excited to have some for my own brunch.  Mmmmm...I'm getting hungry thinking about it now.\n\nOverall, $20 a person including tip, with strong drinks, good food, and extras to take home we were satisfied.", "business_id": "_RBUU1y4yJrK0SPAd8z0-w", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-12-11", "type": "review"}

Unfortunately for India Delhi, it has to be done.  Honestly, I have not dined inside this restaurant, my experience is purely from multiple take out orders over the past year.\n\nLiving in Arcadia and loving food as I do, I am lucky in the fact that I do not have to travel far to enjoy ethnic culinary delights that other cultures have to offer.  If your a foodie in the 21st century, Indian food is all over your radar.  India Delhi, found at 54th street and McDowell in Phoenix, fits the bill of almost every other Indian restaurant in the valley. Nice external building, clean looking restaurant and the normal tinctures related to that region of the world.  \n\nAlways friendly and eager to take your order, the young gentleman at the front counter has never let me down in taking care of my to go order. Always checking each container to make sure it has the correct contents, etc.  On the Saturday I am referencing for this review, the young man was not there, but the owner and his wife were. In my opinion, Indian food is not a cheap venture. I always find myself wanting to try a dish as well as getting a staple that I know is going to be solid. When you add in the extra charge for rice(never included), yogurt sauce(not included), etc, the bill for myself and companion always tops $40.  I usually do not gripe as I know the quality will be there and I just love the food, what can I say.\n\nOn this Saturday though, something was different. This was evident from the moment I walked in the door, I could not put my finger on it, but something was just not vibing.  The owners wife(or co owner for all I know) was at the counter and asked if I wanted the buffet. I politely turned it down as I am not a fan of buffet food, especially with Indian cuisine.  I politely turned that down and proceeded to order tandoori chicken, saag paneer, chicken biryani, basmati rice and some naan.  \n\nWhat happened next is not something I will forget soon.  I watched as the owner walked out of the kitchen with the pan in hands and used the spinach for my saag paneer from the buffet.  The owners and my eyes met as he processed that I saw what he was doing.  In that moment, the owner sold and gave up all his culinary credibility. He proceeded to head back to the kitchen to use said items.  \n\nI waited for another fifteen minutes and took my order home.  What did I find? The chicken biryani, the only item I might add not in the buffet, was extremely hot, almost too hot to touch.  The saag paneer was warm at best. The tandoori chicken was a collection of small legs(customary for Indian buffets) and once again, not hot.  I knew what had happened and could not help feeling beyond annoyed with the situation.\n \nNormally, I just deal with what is, I do not ever send food back and especially on to-go orders.  This time was different, I could not let it go.  I called the restaurant and without pause the owner got on, knowing exactly who I was and what the problem was. He put up a fight for around 20 seconds saying that he just used the spinach as a base for the saag paneer and what not, but then finally just apologized and said he would \"make it right.\"  \n\nI do not really see myself going back here, but who knows.  This is a good excuse to venture out and try some more of the valleys offerings in this arena.", "business_id": "_RBUU1y4yJrK0SPAd8z0-w", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-01-23", "type": "review"}

I wasn't sure what to make of a place with a walk-up takeout window. Last night, I followed a group of friends there for a late dinner. Didn't try any appetizers. I just split a 14' Italian special pizza--sausage, green olives and fresh garlic. The pizza was pretty good, not spectacular but definitely a couple steps above a place like Mamma Mia's whose pizza has a fast-food quality at times. Red Devil is very generous when it comes to toppings, at least on this one. I am an olive lover but haven't had green olives on pizza before. I enjoyed olives in every bite. But if you think olives are just okay, you might have found it a bit much. The pizza was kind of big for two people and with tax, it was about $18. So, I'd say it's fairly priced. \n\nI have to say that the service, more than the pizza, would draw me back. Servers who think of the little things before you even ask are much appreciated. We had a party of nine and our waiter was super patient. We also brought a birthday cake on the premises, which they allow. Our waiter started clearing all our plates and silverware and before I could ask, he said not to worry, he'd bring us clean plates and forks for the cake.

They still have the light up signs for hte order numbers, and the entire restaurant feels like a cave. It's reminiscent of all those old school Mexican restaurants you find scattered around town with no windows, etc. We were friendily greeted twice upon entry and seated almost instantaneously. The crowd was mixed, but one thing everyone had in common is it was almost an entirely blue collar lunch break crowd. There were some people from Honeywell, and some contractors, as well as some teachers. \n\nThe appetizer spinach and artichoke dip was very tasty... if not a bit overly greasy but with the right amount of fat, salt, and other artery clogging goodness. I ordered the lunch special small cheese pizza, and at the table was also a small white pizza. The red sauce pizza was average, with a very sweet sauce, a tough crust as if it had been made earlier in the day but overall a \"it's low quality but oh so tasty\" kind of taste to it. The white pizza had no olive oil, no garlic, no anything outside of breat and cheese. It was cheesy bread, make no mistake. \n\nOverall, I thought the food was average if not slightly below average, but there is something about Red Devil that made me feel comfortable here and welcome. The staff was friendly, there was no sense that you were being judged... it was just a good happy experience... with sub standard but still acceptable food. I walked out the door under $30 including tip for an appetizer, two pies, and two iced teas. I felt it to be very reasonable.", "business_id": "PEHJjxdw11TGFma9Zhz3ng", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-02-03", "type": "review"}

I much prefer this location over the one in Tempe. (The Tempe locale just seems to \"not care\" anymore about customers or quality, in my opinion.) Anyway, met a friend here for dinner last night, as we wanted Italian but not too pricey and not too \"chain\". We settled on RD. We got there about 5:30 ish and the parking lot was already full and had to park in the overflow lot on the west side of the restaurant. [Tip to newcomers to this restaurant: Red Devil shares their parking lot with the bar next door and their take-out window is very busy with pizza orders. Get there early or settle for having to park in overflow lot or on the street.]\n\nWe were seated quickly and our server took our drink orders right away. It was busy already so we didn't mind the wait to take our food order, but when he did, he was polite and got it right the first time. He was attentive to our needs and my wine refill, and all around very pleasant. I ordered Spaghetti and meatballs. It was good, but the sauce was a tad bitter from what I remember. It almost had a \"vinegar\" taste to it. However, it was still edible (I was famished) and so I ate it. My friend who had the linguine with marinara said the same thing about the red sauce.  a bit on the bitter side, but \"okay\". \n\nAll in all the meal was fairly good, and our server was as attentive as he could be on such a busy night. My only complaint besides the marinara being somewhat bitter, is our server's demeanor once we paid the check. I opted to treat my friend if she would agree to leave the cash tip. (she did). She left 20% of the bill's total, and our server, after taking the final check, seemed upset. He took several opportunities to walk past our table and either ignore us (to see if we would like more water) or to glare at us. I found that unprofessional and odd. I guess he was expecting more? Either way, we will probably come back another time to try the pizza again (which I remember is terrific). Just hopefully we don't get another waiter who behaves like he did after being paid.", "business_id": "PEHJjxdw11TGFma9Zhz3ng", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-12-23", "type": "review"}

There are a lot of people who are giving it 4 and 5 stars, but they are really rating the acts they saw there and how wonderful a time they had. They aren't truly rating the theater itself. Let me give you the PROS and CONS of Celebrity Theater.\n\nCONS:\n1. Parking:  If you get there late, good luck finding a spot. There are hardly any parking lines to assist you. If you get there when everyone else is, you may even have to wait to turn into the parking area. I always try to get there 45-60min before the show starts. Yes, it's a little early, but you will find a parking spot without much problem and you'll have time to get some beers, snacks and hit the restroom before the show starts. \n\n2. Concession Stand: It's your typical drink and snack bar. Beer is like $6-$7 and popcorn $3. Everything is overpriced like the movie theater. The food is just average at best. The lines can be very long if you get their late. I got their early and still had to wait about 20min to get my drink/food. \n\n3. Bathrooms: They weren't the cleanest in the world. There was toilet paper in the stalls and soap in the containers. So that was a plus. This wasn't the bathroom at the Bellagio, that for sure. If you can, go before you leave home, do it. Try not to drink or eat anything prior. \n\n4. The Theater: It's old. The stage is a nice size, but the seats are very small. If you are a tall or a wide person, you probably won't be too comfortable sitting in these seats. I'm 5'8\" and I still had to pull my knees in so not to hit the seat in front of me. I don't believe there are any cup holders for your drinks. If there are, it's attached to the back of the seats in front of you. It's pretty dark in this place as well. Almost like a move theater before the movie starts. \n\nPROS:\n\n1. The Shows: This is the main reason we go to this theater. They have some of the best shows here. I've seen Sinbad, Katt Williams and the 70s Soul Jam performers which include (The Delfonics, Ray, Goodman & Brown, The Stylistics, Bloodstone & The Main Ingredient). All these shows were fabulous. Absolutely worth the money. Sinbad started like 15min late, but he kept telling jokes till after 11:30p at night. He said, \"I can go on all night\" Make sure you folks get your moneys worth. He was very funny. Katt Williams was also good and a little over the top.His voice can grind your last nerve after an hour of listening to him. The 70's Soul Jam was spectacular. Each group sang a least 3-5 songs each. I loved it. Most of them sounded just as good as their records. \n\nSo even though the Celebrity Theater itself isn't the greatest, the acts they are able to pull in are awesome. If you can deal with the parking, seats and bathroom, then definitely go and see your favorite acts here. \n\nI gave them 3 our 5 stars.  (1 star for the theater itself & 2 stars for the incredible acts, and the fun & enjoyment I had.", "business_id": "BcBxTyj09Wu-w0KA1QvKTA", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-12-08", "type": "review"}

It is old, and it is aging with friendliness and grace.  Yes,the seats are too close together, but it isn't your kitchen.  Three hours and you are out of there.  The bathrooms are small, and as the evening wears on, they are dirty.  You would be too.\n\nBut when you can drive on great freeways and pull off to a completely gated and guarded arena with enclosed and cheap available parking ($5), that is a good thing.  \n\nBut the enduring quality of the Celebrity Theater is its size and its up close feeling.  This place is a gem which allows you the leisure of a reserved seat and the ability to get up and move about at any time.  If what you are doing is going to hear the music or see the talent, this place may be perfect for you.  If you are making the scene, you might prefer something else.\n\n(Bob Weir Show.

Rent accordingly to the market! My two bedroom two bath 1200 square feet apartment, i got for only 695$ a month. But I can understand why some people would be angry with the rent they paid and what they are getting. \n\nThis review will be based on my experiences of living here since January of 2011. \n\nThe Good\n1. Our neighbors are all very decent and not once have I ever had problems with noise complaints, sketchy neighbors etc. We all look out for each other and even get to know each other's dogs!  (although there are some assholes living here, it's not bad, people are really friendly. \n2. the maintenance guys will definitely come fix your stuff asap. Assuming they get the work order...sometimes my work orders would only say one thing when there would be multiple things needed to be fixed... this would be the front office's fault. They are all very helpful, nice, and gentlemen. They live in the neighboorhood, have families and pets there too so they understand what you're going through.\n3. Rent can now be paid online, so there is no hassle to having to deposit a check or coming into the office, etc. The rent billed each month will now include water and sewage based on the usage and number of units total. You can pick which electricity you have. If you choose aps you're on one side, if you choose srp, you're on the other. The electricity for my apartment was about 65 a month regularly and up to 160 for summer. I'm on a peak hour plan with aps and USE A LOT OF ELECTRICITY! \n4. Grounds keeping and dog poop is not a problem and they don't mow the grass early either! \n5. Close and convenient to shopping places such as Costco, target, fry's, safeway, walmart. Close to freeway access. You are near the 202 and 143. \n6. The apartment itself is quite spacious, open, and fairly new. Don't expect modern appliances that are stainless steel, but you can expect VERY high ceilings, nice finishes, and new carpet. I loved the layout and the space. I also loved the masterbath. That tub was amazing for bubble baths!!\n7. Each unit has it's own laundry! YES YES YES!!!!!\n\nThe Bad...mostly annoying\n1. One covered parking spot for a two bedroom with multiple residents sucks. uncovered isn't bad, it's just far from where you need to be. Be careful though, if you park illegally or stupidly i.e. in two lanes, you will be towed. they have their own towing companies to come in. I even got a citation warning for having a out of state license plate when I am an out of state student! \n2.There is only ONE dumpster for each complex. This means if you have trash and you live on the opposite side of the complex, you drive your trash. I mean it, many of us have to drive multiple trash to the dumpster. \n3. The previous reviews are right about the gate. The gate was left open a lot at night and  sometimes it would go for two three days without being fixed. What's the point of a gate code when all you have to do is wait for someone to go in. \n4. I lived on the first floor so the air quality was kinda terrible. It was stuffy and no matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't get it to be cool and airy. \n5. I hated the sink. It's a double sink, but it's not deep. So dishes pile up fast. \n\nThe Ugly\n1. DON'T LET THE COP CAR PARKED OUT FRONT FOOL YOU! It's a terrible bad bad bad neighborhood; multiple people have had break ins. HIDE YO KIDS, HIDE YO WIFE.  LOCK YOUR DOORS AND BAR YOUR WINDOWS! DO NOT LIVE ON THE FIRST FLOOR! I even got a friggin rearview mirror stolen from my car parked in broad daylight in a covered parking spot! Learned my lesson, now I have a knife, bat, and pepper spray at hand to protect me! \n\nOverall Impression\nThis place wasn't a bad apartment. For the square footage and the price I paid, I loved it. If this apartment was located elsewhere it would have been a dream! There are things you have to weigh, if you think you can overlook them then this place will be perfect!

The chopped chicken is just that - 95% white meat chopped onto a bun. So, in this case the BBQ sauce better be good or else it will be one dry sandwich and luckily this sauce was tasty, kind of a thicker red vinegar style, but still a good taste and it gets soaked up fast. The Brisket was another huge sandwich, almost needing a knife and fork as meat spills everywhere (a good thing). This was shredded or chopped style brisket and I even found a few burnt ends buried amongst the meat.

I have been using Honey Bears BBQ for several years and always had a reasonable experience up until about a year ago.

They recently started cutting their portion sizes way back so much so that I would have to order for 20 when I needed it for 10. The huge disappointment was when I ordered Honey Bears for a retirement party in the office (I made the order a week in advance). The day before they were supposed to deliver I called to confirm the order, the woman on the phone stated that they wouldn't make the delivery time that was quoted on the invoice - not acceptable when you have an office full of people waiting on their lunch. So I offered to pick it up, when I arrived at the Van Buren location, I had to wait 30 minutes for the order which was still way beyond the quoted time. I was also told at the cash register that they \"were out of peach cobbler that day\" so none of my guests received dessert - which may have not been a big deal except for the fact that it was a retirement party.

We had a season pass and went whenever the weather was good (not too hot)  The best part of the zoo, in my opinion, is the squirrel monkey exhibit.

We also like when they have the stingray exhibit, check for schedule, my daugther spends tons of time touching them.  It does cost extra for this exhibit but if you have kids it is worth it.

No exception here!  After all, we are getting to see live exotic animals up close and personal.  \n\nEvery person's inner child/geek is awakened when the opportunity presents itself to inform the rest of the party everything he or she knows about the komodo dragon, or the lion, or tigers, or elephants.  I know that I am instantly transformed into an obnoxious know-it-all docent recalling even the most minute detail from the safari cards I used to collect as a kid.  There is certainly a time and place for geeking out and my favorite time is zoo time!  I honestly think I missed my calling as a zoologist, and you may feel the same way if you were as book smart as I was in the fifth grade about animals.  I suspect every kid dreams of a lifetime tending to animals when they visit a zoo.\n\nAll that said, you will have a great time at this zoo.  It's arranged in a couple of concentric circles so if you give yourself an entire day to see it you can certainly make it all the way around, or at least you can see most of it like we did.  The animals here all seem well cared for and don't seem to mind their enclosures.  While not ideal, I did notice they have a good deal of space to roam with the exception of the warthog who was a heck of a lot more active than I had ever imagined.  You will notice that there are fully horned longhorn steer in the same pen as the giraffes.  At first, I thought they had to be some kind of import, but no, just regular longhorns.  Just when I thought to myself, \"how boring and odd,\" they erupted in a battle of horn locking and butting.  I'm a native Texan and I felt proud watching them mix it up like that.  Then I thought, \"those are steer, why the sense of pride?\"  Silly, I know, but hook-em-horns y'all!\n\nWear a hat and drink plenty of water year round, the Arizona sun is a killer and the desert climate is every bit as dry as you can't even imagine.  Ideally one would go during the winter, the weather is mild enough i suspect the animals are out basking and you won't suffer heat stroke trying to spy the elusive wild dogs or the cheetahs.\n\nI recommend this zoo to anyone passing through or if you're a native to the area.  Somehow the zoo tends to lift my spirits and makes me feel a bit smaller and less important in this world.  I like that idea, since some are under the impression that we can treat mother nature any way we please.  The zoo reminds me that there are more important things on this earth than a new car or what my 401K is doing this year.  \n\n\"When the world decides it's had enough of us, it will shake us off like a bad case of the fleas...\" George Carlin", "business_id": "1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-02-04", "type": "review"}

We play at the water park then go straight home. \n\nWe watch many families (parents) rushing their children through the zoo to the point that the kids don't have fun.

Sometimes we go to ride our bikes around and don't stop at the animals at all. \n\nWe love that the new Kimono Dragon exhibit is in, and are excited to see the Orangutan exhibit being started.

I've been bored out of my skull every time.  As an adult, I've attended these events with the youngsters because they somehow believe it's cool.  If you're looking to score husband-points, then, by all means, drag everyone there.  Your feet and legs will be sore from all the walking they make you do.  If you're looking for enjoyment, DO NOT BOTHER.  The sneaky and insidious problem is that this place is EXTREMELY expensive, and pretends that they are providing a service to the community.  Let me explain---  they truly believe that they are a worth-while value for every family dollar you're spending.  Yet, don't believe a salesman--- they wiil bend the truth every time, and smile at you while they take your dollar.  And now, on the the Big Three:\n\n1)  Price:  This is the absolute worst problem with this seemingly, family-friendly place.  I mean, who would think that a City Zoo would be trying to scalp you for cash?  Let me give you an example of a small family of 4... this can EASILY turn into a $100 day.  For a 6-8 person group of working-class families, this can easily reach over $150, and outside of a $50,000/yr income household.  If your kids bring friends, it will be even more.  You'll hear cashiers say that \"their Zoo\" is worthy of their out-of-reach-for-the-common-man pricing.  Their answer is simply rhetoric, because, when pressed, they won't be able to explain why the price is this high for a family.  \n\nThe bottom line is that, their prices are so incredibly high, that Joe-average, and his family, cannot afford to visit this local zoo without budgeting for it over a couple of months.  Maybe we should've left our fixed-income Grandma and Grandpa at home, although that didn't seem right. \n\n2)  Service:  Everyone we met was attentive and receptive.  They seemed to genuinely want you to have a good time.  \n\n3)  Taste:  Everything we tried was tasty, although it was hard to enjoy because everything is 3 times the price that it should be.  \n\nIn Summation:  I'm not sure why this place is recommended by any kind of governmental body, as to why this is a benefit to the State of Arizona, unless they are making some kind of profit from it.  NO, WAIT, ---- they tax every transaction within the Zoo's control.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSkip this next portion if you're married with kids.  This section is addressed to some Weinee that complained about my comments where I said the $18 entrance fee was too high... \n\n     -----Since you're single, probably going double-dutch, it's no wonder why you'll be shocked by what I've said, because, \"...dude, it's only $18....\".  That's when everyone else knows that you are alone and have no family responsibilities.  While I might envy your ease-of-movement-as-a-single-guy, please gauge your speculation on the # of your children and the # of your extended family.  For example:  5 kids, plus their total of 11 friends, plus 3 grandparents, for tickets to get in.  Include food/drink while you're there, and I don't even have a big family.  At those rates, I'm sure you'll agree, that this place is monetarily ANTI-FAMILY and prohibitively EXPENSIVE.  No, wait....  LET'S GO EVERY WEEKEND, BECAUSE I'M SINGLE ON A DOUBLE-DUTCH DATE!!!  \n\nWay to go, Commenter Weinee.-----", "business_id": "1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-01-05", "type": "review"}

I'm originally from the Pacific Northwest, which has good zoos full of cold weather animals. The Phoenix Zoo is full of hot weather animals (makes sense), but it really nicely laid out and has a ton to do. We had free passes that day, so we skipped the line and didn't have to pay, which probably colors my view a bit, but we walked around for 4 hours and saw almost every exhibit and habitat that we could, and thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\nThe Lions and the Rhino were amazing...The Jaguar was beautiful, and just paced around his area, like he was stalking prey. There is a cool baboon exhibit, and so many other animals that you can see, from Bighorn Rams to the Komodo Dragon. The coolest area is this wide open space with the giraffes, and it also has longhorns and ostriches. It's a huge space, and you can really see the animals run around be more natural. The elephant and turtles are pretty cool too. \n\nIn other news, I had a kindred spirit moment at the otter habitat. True story:\n\nI've always felt like my spirit animal is an otter (yeah, I said it), and when I went to see the otters, there was one outside laying on a log. After I'd been standing there a minute, he perked up, looked back at me and walked away into his little house thing. A few seconds later, TWO otters came out of the rocks and they came outside and swam around, ultimately ending up at a patch of grass right in front of the railing I was looking over, and both were staring at me. The guy next to me said \"wow, I've never seen them do this. I've been coming here regularly for more than a year and they always just hang out on the log\". I wasn't the only one that noticed the fact that the otters were clearly excited that I was there...Definitely one of my top animal/human moments so far in my life.\n\nAfter the otter experience it was bound to be a 5 star day, but I also got to ride a camel...Yes, I rode a camel.\n\nIn short, the Phoenix Zoo is great. I've lived her almost two years and had never been. If you've yet to go, do it soon, and say hi to the otters for me.", "business_id": "1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-02-08", "type": "review"}

It's amazing! You can pet the stingrays, which feel like wet velvet, and then at specific feeding times, you can purchase food to feed them. It's kind of scary at first, but they are really gentle creatures and it's super fun! I could spend hours petting and feeding the stingrays. \n\nIf you ever need something to do or want a great experience, definitely visit the zoo!

I hadn't been in about two years (except for Zoo Lights which is different) and a few things have been added. My fiance and I got a $2 off discount each for AAA membership which was nice. They do let you bring your own water which is great because it is $3.79 a bottle at the concession stands, ouch! We started at the Arizona Trail area which has animals from around Arizona. While this is a cool exhibit for learning about Arizona natural history, it does not wow me in the long run.\n\nThe zoo is well maintained and clean for the most part which is good. I did take off one star because the bathrooms were absolutely disgusting! I understand that this is a zoo but the utter stench coming out of the bathrooms is enough to scare a wild animal away! Bathrooms = Bad! \n\nThe majority of the animals were napping on our visit which is understandable but a little disappointing when you want to see them in action. It was really cool to see the white rhino. We caught the tail end of a tour passing through and learned that she is 43 years old and most rhino's in captivity only live to be 35 at most, so she is really beating the odds! The lions were taking a cat nap but the male lion was rolling around every once in awhile. We also learned from the tour that the female lion, Cookie, had recently had surgery and while she was recovering for two days, the male lion waited outside the door and paced the entire time she was gone. Awww... We made our way around to the spider monkey house which was pretty cool. You get to go in the cage with them and see them run and play around you. We also learned that all of the spider monkey's (13 of them) are named after Star Trek characters which I found awesome, being the nerd that I am. The orangutan exhibit is also really cool. It is pretty big and has a lot of space for them to socialize and run around. One of the orangutan's had a dixie cup with some liquid in it when we came around the corner and another one was trying to steal it from him. It was quite entertaining. It is nice that the keeper's provide them with enrichment activities.\n\nOverall this is a pretty good zoo. I would recommend bringing kids here or even if you just want to have a good day trip outside while it is still nice and not an inferno.

The place itself is ridiculously huge, but not in a tiring sort of way - paths are laid out in a pleasant (albeit overlapping) way.  I do think that more signs and guidance could be provided in certain locations - there were times I felt a bit lost - but that wasn't a big deal.  The place is clean, comfortable, and accommodating.  Delicious kettle corn and cotton candy is sold here, which is also nice.\n\nThe animals themselves are obviously awesome, and it's nice to see plenty of space and breathing room for all of them.  It's sometimes awful to see zoos with little \"elbow room\" space for the animals - that's far from the case here.  The monkey exhibit, which allows you to literally walk into the exhibit with the monkeys - was definitely a stand-out.\n\nThere's an argument to be made that there should be more animals here (as stated by other reviews), but that's ridiculous. This place is clearly set up to give all animals adequate space while having a good selection to see - cramming it full of stuff to show visitors would be negligent.  There are a lot of animals to see here already as it is - I'm not sure why this complaint is commonly raised.\n\nAll in all, this place was really enjoyable.", "business_id": "1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-12-27", "type": "review"}

Waikiki is more than 10 million dollars an acre if you can some how get your hands on it.

Let's start with the good:\n\nI thought the giraffes and zebra's were beautiful! I really like the giraffe enclosure it's a nice size and it has different animals roaming around with them like two huge cows with long horns attached and some ostrich and some thing else I don't remember what though. I also liked the bear enclosure it was really cool and nice. It was fun to see the wolves running around in a pack like formation as if they were hunting. The cheetah brother triplets were cool as well and the otters are cute. Also a big bonus is that they have a little mini petting farm for kids to interact with farm animals I thought that was awesome not just for the kids but for me as well I love farm animals. Anyone who wants to get close to farm animals will love having a chance to pet them. And speaking of close there's a little caged exhibit well two actually one you get to walk around and look at tiny monkeys jumping around trees there's like a dozen I was told although I only saw like five or six. And then there's another one where you can see these big fat furball prairie dogs up-close as well as some vulture looking birds above them (vegetarian I'm guessing otherwise they would swoop the cute little prarie dogs away in which case I would find a way to sue them for all they have!!!) and some other birds as well. Andd you can feed a giraffe, touch some stingrays, and ride a camel but you have to pay like five bucks for each. I think three for the stingrays. But still a really cool experience.\n\nAs for the things I didn't like:\n\nIt's safari themed. I'm really into green landscape lots of grass and trees and stuff like that but since this is a desert and most of the animals are from Africa it has that African safari sort of feel. It's great if you like that atmosphere. I also didn't like the size of the enclosures. They were pretty small and I just couldn't help but think about how I would hate to live closed up in a tiny space like that. They absolutely need to make them all bigger!! Also the quantity of animals is small. Don't get me wrong there's a lot of different animals there's zebras, lions, cheetahs, tigers, snakes, kamoto dragon, bear, flamingos, etc etc, but most of them are trapped in the enclosure by themselves which is sad if you think about that stuff. It's bad enough they live trapped in a limited space but some of them are there by themselves I mean come on. But I do want to note that this is a place that takes in animals that were taken from the wild as pets and the owners surrendered them so they can't just go back to the wild so I can't be too harsh the zoo is trying their best. Also another thing I didn't like which doesn't have anything to do with the animal aspect is the price! The food and entrance are pricy but the thing that saves it are the memberships! You can buy yearly memberships and I think it's decent priced if you plan on going the whole year. They have single memberships or family ones and the one I have is I can bring in two different adults and 10 kids aged 3-18 and I love it because I get to bring in different friends and family members any time I want throughout the year so it works great for me. Also you can bring in food. Just don't feed the animals. And on another note somebody brought up a good point about zoo lights let the animals rest will ya!!!!!!!!!\n\nAll and all I like the zoo I go regularly and it's a nice family outing. I recommend it.", "business_id": "1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-02-04", "type": "review"}

Our group commented on how bizarre it is that you stay at La Quinta for $85 a night and get free Internet; stay at a fancy hotel like this one, and you pay $265 and pay another $15 for Internet.  I heard the fitness facility was nice; and a free aiport shuttle which helps on the overpriced nightly rate.  GREAT for business.

Someone who chooses not to believe everything that I read on the internet I signed a lease primarily because I was new to the area with very little knowledge, on the parking with all of my belongs in a U-Haul and no place else to go. I have been a resident of Papago Crossings since 11/4/2015, and I have found all of the negative comments that I read to be TRUE. So let's go down the list:\n1. On the first day as I was moving in, I walked into the kitchen, glancing into the kitchen sink I saw roaches. Reporting this to the office I was told that the exterminator came on Mondays and I would have to wait until then for the unit to be sprayed. I moved in on a Wednesday. I was also told that the apartment had been empty for a while, and the roaches where sewer roaches. I've lived in dwellings before this is the first time that I have heard of such. After raising a stink the exterminator came the next day. Still having the problem I returned to the office, and was told that a new exterminator had been hired and received notice that my apartment would be fogged on Monday, December 21st. I don't believe that happened, and I still have ROACHES. \n2. The water in kitchen and bathroom sinks run luke warm at best, and now luke warm is the best that I get from the bathroom shower too. \n3. Moving on to the security of the property. It was my understanding that Papago Crossings is a gated community, which led me to believe it was a secure property. There are gates, but no good if they don't work. The gates have only worked properly (consecutively) for maybe 3-days at tops since I've been here. One morning leaving for work at 6:45 am I was confronted by a man who appeared to be homeless, two days later there was another with a grocery cart with trash bags tied to the cart standing on the parking lot. I watched as he begun going through the trash bin as I drove away. Even the gates that require keys for entry are not secure because the locks don't work. \"No code or key required!\"\n\nAs I read the recent postings I do see responses from management with a number to call.\nI call only to get the message \"we are in the office, but can't answer your call\", blah, blah. \nSame complaints by different people.", "business_id": "ZPDeQUjsLw9ycAbWFWxedw", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-12-24", "type": "review"}

The town's fire department is by volunteer and my host family put in much time and dedication into the fire brigade. That being said, they had a lot of interest in the firefighting industry. Flash forward: a couple years ago they stopped by Phoenix while visiting the US and really wanted to go to the Hall of Flame. And thus, I had my first experience at this museum.\n\nI must interject and say I'm not really interested in firefighting. Not at all. Needless to say, I found this museum pretty boring. However, I try to think of it objectively. I think they have a lot of interesting stuff if you're into firefighting or have little kids at home.

It was interesting and unusual. But surprisingly good.\n\nThen we had a Happy Family hot pot. I'm not sure what all was in it. It looked like krab, shrimp, fish, and something else. Maybe it was squid? It was a curled, white, mostly flavorless flesh, spiny or scored on the outside. It also contained baby bok choy and water chestnuts. The broth was a bit bland. \n\nWe followed that with steamed pork dumplings. The filling was rather tasty, and full of green onion flavor.

Or, ask the price in advance. Secondly, when I booked I was not aware that this restaurant is participating in the Restaurant.com program, therefore I had no idea that the owners are already ahead of the curve and most likely anticipating a certificate from first time patrons, particularly patrons who are not ethnically Chinese.\n\nThe restaurant was selected based on my experiences dining with a friend from Hong Kong, who was not with me last night. I found them on the website for the Chinese Cultural Center, as I have only lived here in AZ for two years. I didn't find out about the Restaurant.com certificate participation until after booking the reservation and then coming to Yelp to read reviews.  I happened to have over two hundred dollars in Restaurant.com certificates so I redeemed one to use for dinner. A happy accident, right?\n\nI've eaten in Chinatown in NYC many times, eaten in restaurants where there is no menu in English and my Cantonese speaking friend ordered, and have ordered a whole duck many times. Sometimes the side dishes or presentation vary a little, but there is no disputing the sum parts of an entire duck- it includes two wings and two legs. I know my duck.\n\nSo a duck, not on the menu but available, was ordered more than 24 hours in advance.  Upon arrival for our reservation the duck was served shortly thereafter with polite and congenial service from a woman I assume is one half of the couple that owns the restaurant. The Shanghai style crepes were good, the scallion was julienned, the hoisin sauce was augmented. It was delicious, but in my opinion it was not a whole duck as ordered and charged for- upon service I asked the woman if it was a whole duck because the sliced breast parts did not seem to be the entire bird. Also, in Chinatown there is a practice of presenting the duck,  carving at table, then whisking away to make a second course from the parts that don't easily lend themselves to rolling in crepes or in buns (some restaurants serve a puffy flat bun and not a crepe) but in our case there was no second course.\n\nWe ordered other dishes, especially since my dining companion is a neophyte to non-Americanized chinese.   We weren't there trying to get away with only fulfilling the required 45 dollar purchase per the gift certificate- I try to make it worth the owner's while and be fair. \n\nFor him there was peppersteak and house special fried rice, for me the sea bass in white wine (I wanted fish with pine nuts but they were out of nuts) and chinese fried cabbage, a stir fried bok choy and napa mixture with dried baby shrimp as seasoning.  The food was tasty, albeit too much salt was added, and I definitely tasted MSG in the fish and cabbage. Also, the beef and cabbage were swimming in a puddle of grease.  The cabbage alone was eight bucks, but again since we were getting a discount I thought it only fair to order at least one dish where the owner had a high markup. Ditto for the rice.\n\nWhen the bill came I was a little surprised to see that the Duck alone was forty bucks, since we didn't get the whole duck.  I tendered my certificate without a word and the staff politely packed up our leftovers, which was most of our meal- that was deliberate.  The bill with tax was 88 bucks and change, and the terms of the certificate included a mandatory 18 percent tip before discount. I don't have a problem with that at all, I always tip on the face value of a meal, not the discount price.  What I don't like however is the habit of owners to assess the tax on the total of the bill prior to discount- I've used certificates at restaurants that used computerized systems and never been taxed on the full price. This restaurant uses hand written tickets that are written entirely in chinese except for the numbers. To add insult to injury, the owner assessed the mandatory tip on the entire amount including the tax.  I know that waitstaff today assume that they are due a tip on the tax, but actually that's quite incorrect traditionally.  When the bill came back it was just shy of eighty dollars after discount.   I don't begrudge restaurant owners trying to keep afloat and make a living, but I don't like it when they pad the bill, and this bill was padded.  That plus our less than a whole duck left a bad taste in my mouth about this restaurant, and that alone is grounds for me not to return.  \n\nIf you want something better than american style chinese or want to use one of those certificates, then go ahead and dine at Lao Ching Hing, but this is my advice:  Only order off the menu.  Advise the server to ask the kitchen to go easy on the salt, and if you're not a fan of MSG, request that they keep it out of your food. Lastly, just order what you want for the meal and if you want extra, order it separately as take-out to avoid having a padded bill.", "business_id": "2unQHR9uaRxk3dsW6f3MGA", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-12-25", "type": "review"}

El Nopalito fits the bill perfectly.  This place first popped up on my radar after seeing frequent mentions on Chowhound.

Ick.  We started with two Cokes and some homemade chips with both a green and red salsa.  Both salsas were outstanding, which in my experience is rare.  Generally if you get two salsas on the table, one is terrible and one is at least decent.  And Mexican cokes in the cool bottles?  Yay!  Then we ordered a bowl of tortilla soup to share.  This was flavorful and the tortilla strips were nice and crispy.  We only ordered one portion to share but the server brought us two full bowls and charged us for one.  Generous.  The only room for improvement was temperature.  The soup could have been hotter.  Next, we ordered green chile chicken enchiladas and...and...and I forgot the name of my entree.  It was, however, the server's recommendation and she didn't let me down.  My dish was steak with bacon, green peppers, onions and cheese melted over the top.  All of this was served over two corn tortillas.  Super good.  Everything was cooked to perfection.  The green chile chicken enchiladas were outstanding and the green chile was the best my boyfriend has ever had.  The rice was flavorful and tender and beans great as well.

The salsas were interesting; they were very fresh tasting, but lacked any sort of explosive flavor that I was expecting (The red is much better than the green). With the bland chips, it wasn't much of a pairing, but with the salted chips, I was pleased. \n\nFor lunch I ordered an al pastor burrito and a barbacoa sope. The burrito was awesome! I actually really liked that it wasn't huge. What it lacked in size, it made up for in flavor. The barbacoa on the other hand, wasn't as good. On the menu it says that barbacoa is only served on Saturday and Sunday. This is apparently because El Napolito's barbacoa is made with lamb. I've had plenty of barbacoa before and I was expecting to be blown away...especially after having some great al pastor, but I wasn't. The meat was really gamy, like really gamy.

Wow, what a city.  It's beautiful and in the middle of HELL.  Paradise lost, one might say.\n\nI made my reservations to the Rodeway Inn Airport after consulting the internet for a place to stay.  I made a few considerations, such as brand name.  I've been a big fan of Clarion Brand hotels, since I've stayed at Comfort Inn and Suites in a variety of cities over the years.  I concluded my internet reservation the day before and decided this was in a great spot due to airport proximity and brand name.\n\nWhat...a...mistake...\n\nApparently, Phoenix is abnormal compared to many cities I've stayed in.  The airport is beautiful but the surrounding area is not.  The hotel chain has a great reputation, but this place was not beautiful. \n\nHere, let me explain!\n\nI arrived at 0500 (5am for y'all) in Phoenix.  My reservation was made, but apparently the Clarion website differs from their policy.  My room was given away since I hadn't checked in by 6am, even though the Clarion website has a Room Guarantee that says they'll hold the room until 7am the next day.  I had a bit of kick back from the onside employee that night.\n\nHotel is rather nasty. It's old.  It's dilapidated.  It was all locked up (more to follow on that).  It was grungy.  Not pleasant, nor reminiscent of the Clarion brand.\n\nRoom was freezing, and appeared sloppily put together.  Curtains were ill fitting, going over the window A/C Heater system and blowing.  Also, the heat didn't work too well, but that's neither here nor there.\n\nBelow the heater though, that's where the magic was found.  A used Trojan Magnum condom and wrapper.  Now THAT'S good times.\n\nApparently, this hotel, this area, this side of the airport is known to locals for the strip clubs, prostitution and drug dealers.  Yup.  It's all that.  \n\nNot gonna be staying here again.  Sorry Clarion.  You've lost me on this one.", "business_id": "GF95bWp-19I5YbNtr9VluQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-01-13", "type": "review"}

But there was a pigeon outside the cracked bathroom window. \n\nSecondly, they had a CRT television. Really? Really? HDTV's are so cheap these days ... there is no excuse for ANY hotel having a CRT set. I didn't think those things even worked anymore. And I didn't turn it on to find out. \n\nStill, I gave it 2-starts to his one because while Jay was up all night due to the paper thin walls, I took a triple dose of melatonin to escape the misery of this wretched room and PTFO'd.

(Either I missed the poop on the bathroom wall, or just figured Jay was leaving his mark) The bed was fine. And the front desk service was polite.

Admittedly, it is not the prettiest-looking store in the best neighborhood, but it is conveniently located, clean, and has a bonus gas station, pharmacy, optical/hearing centers, and tire service center.\n\nSince the parking has been addressed in other reviews, I'll add my $.02:  Most parking lots are positioned perpendicular to their corresponding store. While Costco's lot design is terrible, the standard corner entryway they employ works well here. Wrapping the parking lot around a corner of the building effectively extends the parking to two sides of the building rather than one. This creates more spaces near the entry/exit. In August when I have purchased perishables, I am appreciative of this.\n\nMy various customer service dealings over the past few years have all been positive experiences that left me feeling good about my loyalty to Costco and the Kirkland brand. Associates quickly handle returns without hassle, I am usually able to find an associate on the floor if I have a question, and it appears this particular location employs individuals on the long-term as familiar faces regularly greet me.\n\nWhere quality is concerned, I shop with confidence at Costco.

I honestly have never had to wait more than a couple of minutes to get to the pump and the prices are what you'd expect of Costco.\n\nCustomer service wise, they aren't that great - but it's a warehouse and honestly, I'm just trying to get in and out of there and never really peruse much.  The produce is fresh and it's a great place to pick up the necessities you don't mind buying in bulk.  Since I'm single and live alone I tend to drift a lot more towards things such as cleaning items and toiletries as well as other items I frequently use such as batteries, spinach or non-perishables like pasta.

It was my Aunt's birthday and she _loves_ Macayo's. I went along begrudgingly and the results were terrifying.\n\nAs a Phoenix native, I've known Macayo's on Central for decades. Its unique facade emulates the style of some grand Guatemalan Mayan temple, but... no, not really. And what is it that you want when you see pictures of Machu Picchu or of Tikal? You want to climb the steps, to _go in_. In the case of Macayo's, you must resist this urge with all your might.\n\nThe main entrance is from the back and is true to form in the Egyptian style. A post and lintel rectangular opening leads to a long narrow hallway slightly sloped which opens to an antechamber branching off to the splendorous caverns within. Um. Except this article is about _food_, not a history of architecture lecture! Bleh.\n\nAs is my custom I order a cheese crisp straight off; I'm allergic to corn so the endless bowls of hardened, impervious-to-rot corn chips (see pic) just repel me. After the pushy (more on that later) waitress scurries off I notice my fork (see the picture) and realize that with the caked-on food, this place might be cutting corners on lots of stuff, namely that the tortillas might be so cheap that they are the type to be sprinkled with corn starch to keep them from sticking to each other. The waitress returns and I ask her to please check the ingredient list for the tortillas for corn starch. A few minutes later she returns with the label torn from the tortilla bag and says that without her glasses she cannot read the list. I'm not joking when I say that the list goes on as long as this paragraph. Chemical after chemical, non-food food after non-food food. And then there right in the middle is corn starch, corn meal, corn flour and corn syrup. In FLOUR tortillas! \n\nI immediately canceled my order for the cheese crisp and resolved not to place a single bite of anything into my mouth. \"Was the water bad too?\" I wondered.\n\nI'm not sure where it started, but Tex-Mex goers have come to expect the attentive busboys to continually flit about filling and refilling bowls of corn chips and salsa. Macayo's sets the standard. It seemed the bowls dropped every few seconds as my family devoured them while waiting for the birthday girl to show. The salsa was gloopy (again with the pic) and might have had something added to the mix after it was poured from a gigantic vat, but I doubt it. My sensible companion said it didn't taste fresh at all.\n\nThe birthday girl was almost 45 minutes late. After 40 minutes we discussed among us just ordering anyway. We decided to order, except that our decision quickly became an argument with the waitress who insisted that we wait for her. Um, whoa! Is this really happening to me? I must be in some kind of Mayan burial temple, I'm dead, and my servants and family were buried with me along with food and I'm going to be here for the next thousand years until someone decrypts the secret book and inserts the starfish-shaped key into the stony entrance to free my evil spirit back on the world.  AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!! Yes, I loved the Mummy movies.\n\nBut back to our pushy waitress. After the family tried over and over, unsuccessfully, to cajole me into ordering something, anything, we waited for the results. You'll have to see the pictures.\n\nYou know you're in a nightmare of menu hell when an item's description has to change languages from English in order to accurately describe its content. The average speaker uses something like 20,000 words regularly and you can't even find a few to accurately or even poetically describe this item? The steak was described with being covered in a spinach queso sauce (see pic). Those two words had to have been taken straight off the labels of the two cans that were dumped into a warming pot to create this sauce. Think nacho cheesy, oil and corn starch and that lovely orangey-yellow coloring. Disgusting.\n\nMy brother ordered a taco plate (see pic) and made the mistake of trying to bite into the taco shell with his teeth. This item should have come with a disclaimer and a hammer. Envision eating crab but with the shell still on it. He gave up quickly and dug out the innards with his fork, snail style. \n\nMacayo's should stick to their success like some cornstarch-less badly made stack of tortillas, namely large-scale manufactured canned foods sold to those who still think Phoenix is a town of rolling tumbleweeds and cowboys. Let them fantasize about questing to Phoenix and entering the secret Mayan temple to discover the secrets within. They can release my tormented soul from the hell that is Macayo's.", "business_id": "jzPMl-NoB5F2fwoHX3hN8A", "stars": 1, "date": "2008-12-12", "type": "review"}

I have tried several locations and have dis-liked them all.

Everyone says the one off of Mill Ave is good.  But I have wasted enough money at their restaurants.  It boggles my mind how a chain of such low quality can exist.  Any one of the numerous Mexican restaurants usually ending with \"o's\" is better than this place.  \n\nThe reason they have big margarita's is to distract you from the horrible food and hope after you get over your hangover the margarita is all you remember. Everything I have tasted is bland and seems like it came out of a can.  This chain helps perpetuate the stereotype of Mexican food being of low quality.  I am Mexican-American and used to changing people's mindset when I have them over for dinner.\n\nThe only nice quality of this location is the building is unique it looks like a mesoamerican  pyramid.", "business_id": "jzPMl-NoB5F2fwoHX3hN8A", "stars": 1, "date": "2008-12-29", "type": "review"}

While I wouldn't say their food is the best it is far from the worst. After reading a couple of reviews some things come to mind.\n\n1) People in Arizona don't eat \"tex-mex\", people in Texas do. So, if you're looking for that from Macayo's or most other Mexican joints in town you're not going to get it.\n\n2) To say Macayo's is like some sort of Mexican Denny's is ridiculous.\n\nNow as far as the food is concerned, I like their salsa I'm not sure why but I do. I'd describe it as a bit watery with plenty of cilantro and green chiles. Pretty good in my opinion. Other things I like are the mini-chimis which have never been frozen when I ate them. Are they great for Mexican? Not so much but they're great for eating on the cheap and getting some food in the gut.\n\nMy all-time favorite dish was the Steak Cortez, which the anti-corn guy describes as nacho cheese and spinach; that's not quite right. The Steak Cortez is really a pretty great idea, a skirt steak covered in spinach con queso (con queso being a normal term at any spanish speaking joint that is combining something with cheese) and mushrooms that I really like the taste of and then folded over and a green chile slapped in the middle. I have to say WAS though because over the years the portion has decreased and depending on how the tide goes or which way the wind is blowing it comes out of the kitchen different. If they could serve it great consistently that would be a signature dish. But like Macayo's service itself they can't.\n\nThe carnitas burritos leave something to be desired. Maybe some guacamole or sour cream which you can get if you want to pay extra but it sure seems like stuffing a boatload of carnitas into a tortilla doesn't truly constitute a burrito.\n\nThe tamales are usually pretty decent, though I can't say I've ever had the green corn, I think only the beef. My favorite part of any Mexican meal is the cheesecrisp and it's just as good here as anywhere else. There are places that are better and places that are worse. \n\nCompletely irrelevant as far as food goes but they used to have a free payphone so long as the call was less than 5 minutes and was local. I always thought that was cool but that is gone now.\n\nPros:\n\nSalsa\nSome good ideas for food when executed properly (ie steak cortez, baja sauce)\ncentral location\nthe bar is hoppin' on friday nights\ngenerally decent food but not always and not all items (pro and con)\n\nCons:\nspotty service\nhit or miss inconsistent food\nno cheese enchilada on the kids menu\nthe bar is hoppin' on friday nights which makes for crappy parking", "business_id": "jzPMl-NoB5F2fwoHX3hN8A", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-12-08", "type": "review"}

The food is good and the lunch specials are great and economical. Complimentary chips and salsa while you wait for your order is also a plus. \n\nSome folks don't like the fact that the building is an old temple themed building, but personally I like it. I like the fact that it's the original Macayo's building from the 60's, but maybe I'm more of a purist. Would I prefer for it to be torn down and have a modern establishment with touch screen ordering and wi-fi and all that other technology? No. But that's just me. \n\nThe staff is friendly and courteous, this is also a plus. It's preferable over rude or neutral tempered staff right? The waiter held a conversation with us concerning Obama's visit to Macayo's.\n\nFor the \"Mex & Match\" lunch special I ordered a cheese enchilada and chile relleno with a side of beans. The enchilada was very good and even the beans were very good, as simple as beans are. My only issue was the chile relleno. It didn't have much of a chile flavor to it, kinda bland. It tasted more like the sauce it was topped with. But don't hold this against Macayo's. These type of chile's spiciness and flavor are very random. I know this from my experience with eating them. One can be very flavorful and spicy and the next one can be bland. So, I'm not gonna hold that bland chile against Macayo's. \n\nIf your wondering about price, I spent about $11.00 for this meal including the drink. My only issue with the service was the same waiter who conversed with us about Obama's visit, asked for a tip at the begging when he introduced himself. It sounded rehearsed and something to the effect of: \"Hi my name is so-and-so, I am your waiter today, a small tip would be appreciated...etc.\" I don't like that. I was planning to leave a tip, and I'm sure most people leave one, so asking for a tip to me almost sounds like begging.

Okay so the food wasn't too bad and it's probably consistant as well.  In fact I'd give the food a 3 since I'm not too picky but the utter soullessness of this place was almost too much to bare!  Green Day was blasting in the bar area where we were seated...and to be fair, I don't mind GD but come on, in a \"Mexican\" restaurant?...and at full volume?  Maybe it was just a poor seating arrangement and it would've been better in one of the other hundred or so rooms.

We both were in search of a restaurant that was open on the later side on New Year's Day and this happened to work out for us.  The building itself is like an Aztec or Mayan pyramid and hard to miss since it kind of sticks out - but I guess you could say it adds to the character of the place.  Overall the decor is a bit dated, but clean and honestly for the type of restaurant it is, it's acceptable.\n\nWe were greeted warmly and seated right away to a booth where we both decided to indulge in their margarita special for the evening which was an upgrade from the house.  I was surprised how large they were and tasted great.  I enjoyed the fact that they didn't taste watered down at all and were a bit more on the savory side versus tasting ultra sugary.\n\nThe chips and salsa were a nice touch since many places now don't seem to offer complementary items like that anymore.  The chips were perfectly crisp, not overly salty or thick.  The salsa lacked a bit of pizazz, but tasty none the less.  He ordered the Chimichanga de Macayo and I tried the Sonoran Enchilada Sampler.  Both were delicious and well seasoned.  The chiles in the enchiladas really brought out a nice rounded flavor.  Their rice was flavorful and not overcooked which seems to be a common issue for many restaurants I have tried.  For dessert, we shared the fried ice cream with chocolate sauce; I never had it previously, but it was tasty.  The crust wasn't quite as crispy as I had anticipated, but did have a nice little crunch to it.\n\nIn general, our visit to Macayo's was a pleasant one.

I considered using one of the online services (ProFlowers, 1-800 Flowers, etc.) but I really wanted the \"wow\" effect of the flowers arriving all arranged and gorgeous. So (of course) I turned to Yelp and found Cactus Flowers. \n\nThey have a great website showing photos of all their arrangements (see \"Cactus Flower Exclusives\" for prearranged, local delivery options), and they even offer national deliveries through FTD. I found a gorgeous bouquet and even had the option of adding balloons, chocolates, and a teddy bear. I went with the balloons because I was sending them to my sister's school and I just HAD to go for the best (AKA most embarrassing) visual display possible!! \n\nI placed the order yesterday (hooray for next-day delivery - and even same-day delivery if you order before 1pm) and realized today that I did not specify delivery time. Having the flowers arrive after she's left school for the day isn't the surprise I was going for!! So I sent them an email explaining the situation and asked ever so nicely that they please try to deliver before 2pm. Just over an hour later, which was after noon in Arizona - less than 2 hours before my requested delivery time - I received a response that it was taken care of. How great is that?!?! \n\nI'm still waiting to get a call from my sister (I'm sure I'll post an update later today to say how it turned out), but right now they have a very satisfied customer! \n\nThe Cactus Flower Exclusives are gorgeous and go for $35 and up (+ tax and delivery, which is $13 - $15). National deliveries also start at $35 + tax and delivery. \n\n- 1 Star because the bouquet arrangements most people lean towards start at about $50, which is kinda pricey (only smaller arrangements with a handful of short stem flowers in a short vase are $35)", "business_id": "72INqF4dYTHdCoUoePIuSw", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-02-24", "type": "review"}

Instead I am left feeling like I was taken by this company, and my friend has received an ugly arrangement that I did not order, should NEVER have been charged $185 for, and am embarrassed to even have my name attached to it.\nBased on my experience, I will never do business with Cactus Flowers again.

I ordered flowers online to be delivered on Saturday 2/11 for a friend's mom for her birthday.  They delivered without the personalized card.  My order confirmation clearly shows the message I had written for her.  She had to call Cactus Flowers twice to figure out who they were from and the employee she spoke to was incredibly rude to her.   Also the flowers did not look like what I had ordered.  In the picture there are purple flowers which they just left out completely.  I called Cactus Flowers the next day, Sunday to try and figure out what happened.  Even though I had my order number, it still took her 10 minutes to find my order.  Apparently the flowers had come out of their Carefree location so if I wanted them to deliver a new bouquet, she would call that location to make sure they had all the flowers that were supposed to be in it.  She said she would call me back and let me know.  I had a missed call from them later in the day but no voicemail.  It took me until THursday to get back in touch with them due to my work schedule and the fact that....wait for it.....they have no voicemail.  What kind of business operates with no way for anyone to leave them a message?\n\nSo on Thursday I finally reached them and spoke to someone else and she told me that they would redeliver Friday or Saturday.  Guess what, it didn't happen!  I called back yesterday and spoke to someone who was less than pleasant and she said she would have a manager call me back today.  It is now 3:00 and I haven't heard from anyone.  I'm sure I will have to call them back, again.  I don't think I have ever experienced such crappy customer service.

I kept coming back on business trips for a few reasons:\n\nThe location is terrific. At Thomas and Central you are walking distance to some of the best Thai, barbeque, burger, ice-cream, breakfast, steak and deli restaurants the valley has to offer. What's more important is that a light rail stop is right at the corner. Buy a day-pass and you can go downtown to the sports stadiums and concert halls, or even down to old-town Tempe, up to the George and Dragon, Hulu, Maizies, Doc's place or Chars has the Blues, or out to one of my favorite Vietnamese pho place on Apache Blvd.\n\nAdd to this the quality of the rooms, bedding, and furnishings. All are good enough to make me feel I was being coddled, and good enough to consistently impress.\n\nThe atrium design of the hotel combined with the breakfast buffet means that at about 6:30 to 7:00 each morning you are softly, sweetly awakened to the aroma of eggs and bacon. There is no sweeter feeling. It's like waking up in your mother's arms.\n\nThe bar has a cast of regulars who provide local color. They also have bartenders who remember what you had last time, even if you were there only once a month before.\n\nThe waitstaff is attentive (usually) though there were times at the breakfast buffet when I needed to get my own coffee. By the time that happened i was comfortable doing it myself.\n\nSo what are the cons? Parking costs about $12 per day in the nearby structure, and getting from there to the elevator can be a bit awkward.  There is also no place to lay out in the sun if that's what you like doing. \n\nOtherwise, I could easily consider buying one of the rooms and retiring there.", "business_id": "urBWfXQjyyWIO5B7FvnOpg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-01-21", "type": "review"}

When I first started shopping here it was a pleasant experience but over time the customer service got worse. I am not sure if this was due to new employees or management. Although, I must blame management because the attitudes and treatment that I received usually travels from the top down. I had the most issues with a couple employees that work in the deli area. They were both always rude, short, and unpleasant. Every time I said hello to one of the women she NEVER responded. Not so much as a head nod to acknowledge my presence. I brought this to the attention of a cashier and she told me that she would speak to the manager about the service. I continued to go to AJ's but nothing changed and I received bad service over and over again. The last straw for me happened last week. I went to the deli area to get breakfast. I greeted one of the deli workers and she AGAIN said nothing. I was sure that this was on purpose and not her just having a bad day because it had happened so many times before. I asked her why she never responds and seems to have bad customer service. She dismissed me and said \"actually, I was just about to ask you how you day was going\" I thought this was amusing considering she just neglected to respond to my greeting... I told her that she had done this on a number of occasions and it was quite frankly rude and disappointing. She then jumps to want me to get my manager... Like she could care less about fixing the situation for the customer, apologizing, or making things right. \n\nSuper disappointed with my treatment at the AJ's.

This location also has a special Italian Kitchen (Cucina Italia!) department behind produce that has fresh baked wood-fired brick oven pizza and pasta.\n\nAJ's differentiates from Whole Foods by focusing less on the \"all natural\" and organic slant and more on gourmet (expensive), unique, and imported items.  They are big on merchandising neat little themed vignette displays instead of traditional end-caps.  They'll have many more imported items and go up to a much higher price point (check out the olive oil and wine) than a Fry's Signature store.  Unlike Trader Joe's, they carry a wide variety of brands, and don't focus as much on packaged and frozen foods.\n\nThe prepared food is hit or miss.  I've had a bad monte cristo, awful turkey, good pizza and pasta, decent coconut shrimp and salmon, and amazing mashed and scalloped potatoes.  The soups are good.\n\nThe bakery is really fantastic (the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e is cheaper than Whole Foods, while the pecan pie and bar, Boston cream looking pastry, brownies, chocolate mousse, and more are all delicious).  Note that they carry some indulgent locally made baked goods (Fairytale Brownies and Tammie Coe Cakes).  Their organic AJ's brand sliced packaged bread beats OroWheat and Safeway's version.\n\nTheir gift selection is pricey but well-edited.  It definitely gives the market a more European or \"country chic\" vibe, more Anthropologie than the sleek natural-centricity Whole Foods embodies.  Holiday clearance is a great time to buy stuff 50% or more off!\n\nAJ's does carry \"normal\" national brands to balance out their imported/gourmet/organic assortment, so if you NEED something like Ritz crackers or Bounty paper towels, you'll find it here, as opposed to a generic or a pricey organic brand you'd find at Trader Joe's or Whole Foods.\n\nSome of the employees are unprofessional late at night, but to be fair it gets pretty empty compared to Whole Foods.  Maybe opening up a Wine Bar next door would help?  I think they're finally opening back up the coffee counter in the morning, which is a good business decision, as the bakery gets way too busy with coffee bar orders.\n\nDo I shop here often?  No, but it is great for a treat or to buy a gift.  Since they're local, I feel a little better about throwing down money (\"I'm helping the Arizona economy!\"). Shopping here doesn't give me that \"so healthy\" feeling of Whole Foods, but I do get a \"so fancy\" (or \"indulgent\") feeling, knowing it's just a little more special here.\n\nInsider Secret: Check their website for events like Floral Happy Hour (50% off) Fridays at 4pm.", "business_id": "Mng1FUcW-xRSdsDkowQm2Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-01-03", "type": "review"}

You will be stuck with a bottle of designer water and the same for the soda. Anyway, after receiving our meals we opted out of sitting at one of their many community picnic tables due to overcrowding and ate in the car.

My primary interest here is getting Bianco pizzas to go.  The menu has 4 of the 6 pizzas that are featured at Pizzeria Bianco plus a market pizza.  In my previous review I had expressed severe displeasure with the fact that although they do carryout orders they will not take orders over the phone.  I think that is a flaw, and should at least be better communicated.  \n\nAnyway, this time I called in advance and found out what the market pizza was (smoked mozzarella and sopresata), and asked them what the typical wait time was.  I was told about 10 minutes, which seems very reasonable.  I drove over there (it is only about 2.5 miles from my house) and put in my order for a Magherita and a Rosa.  There was some in-door seating available (it was a bit too cold to wait at the outside tables) so I sat and waited.  Chris Bianco came by and we had a nice chat.  My pizzas were indeed ready in less than 10 minutes.  I actually lost a couple of minutes when they failed to notice that they were to-go orders and put them out for table delivery.  They were a little colder than they should have been because of this, but the new setup (with seating in the part where Lux once was) was only in its first week, so I ave them the benefit of the doubt.  The pizza was wonderful, I had just partaken of a Rosa at Pizzeria Bianco about 3 weeks earlier and could not see any difference.\n\nI am withholding one star due to the phone order issue and the screwup on the to-go order, but this is the deal:\n\nPizzeria Bianco has what the NY Times claimed to be among the best pizzas in the country.  You have to wait an hour or two for a table.\n\nPane Bianco has the same pizza, and you can have one, either to eat in or take out, in about 10 minutes.", "business_id": "-AAig9FG0s8gYE4f8GfowQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-12-07", "type": "review"}

My gorgeous dining companion and I tend to split the fresh mozzarella, basil & tomato (so delish) and their market sandwich (their sandwich de jour) - and normally we can't finish the entire second half, which makes for a nice afternoon snack.  We like to sit outside, weather permitting - which really people, we live in Phoenix, so that's almost always - and slurp Coke from the bottle.\n\nI was a little disappointed with my experience today, although I am sure it was somewhat tempered by the fact that I wasn't accompanied by my man, but was instead grabbing food to go for us.  Apparently you can call in to go orders, which I didn't know, but numerous people cut in front of the long line by simply saying \"I called in my order.\"  Well, excuse me!  The long lonely line is one thing, but the kicker was the tuna salad that didn't have olives as advertised and the bean/veggie soup that really wasn't anything to write home about - it lacked salt for sure.\n\nThe girl in front of me wanted to order pizza and was told you can only order pizza at dinner time.  She was pissed and really, I can't blame her because we stood in line a long time.  But sweetie, really, go to Pizzeria Bianco if you want their pizza.  (PS: We ate there for dinner last night and I will post a separate review...I guess the holidays bring out my Bianco cravings...)\n\nAs I'm re-reading this, I realize it kinda sounds negative.  Which really doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things because this place is hugely popular and will continue to be I'm sure.\n\nTake away: yummy sandwiches, not cheap but that doesn't bother me if the quality is there - and it is.

Soup was hearty and delicious, reminded me of the Persian soup called Ash Reshteh in color, flavor and texture. Tuna sandwich was delish, not the typical mayo filled tuna salad but instead topped with balsamic vinegar and arugula. Mmm. Friends had the tomato mozzarella sandwich and prosciutto sandwich, both licked their plates clean. Meal comes with complimentary bread which was used to dip into the soup. They also offer the local Arizona brew, Sun something (?), a nice light beer, very easy to drink. \n\nWill definitely return to try other items, the lamb arugula sandwich looks good!

George and Dragon it was. The patio is long but narrow with only a handful of round tables on it. However, it's still a nice place to sit with a beer and chat. After a drink on the patio, we headed inside for our next round and decided to just cozy up to the bar. The inside decor is not going to wow you at all, but I appreciate the amount of TVs they have near the bar, showing everything from women's college basketball to English Premier League soccer. I'm also a big fan of bar sports, so the pool table and dart boards in the back get a thumbs up from me as well.\n\nThe draft beer selection is large...probably the largest of any of the pubs I have visited in the Valley. I believe it was about $4.75 for a pint, which is slightly cheaper than pubs like Rula Bula. The menu runs the gammet from traditional British fare to very Americanized food with very very moderate prices. Chris had a fish sandwich which he enjoyed and I had a BLT which I requested with no mayo. However, more than half way into the sandwich I realized there was mayo on it! This shocked me because normally I can always detect mayo on sandwiches as I hate it so much...so I'm not sure what G&D did, but they snuck mayo past me and I still loved the sandwich! The fries that came with the sandwiches were tasty.

Nothing about it said restaurant.  The decor was everything British which may have been cute if they took a rag and wipe the dust off.  No one greeted us when we walked in so we just sat down at a table.  There was a waitress wandering around that looked just as lost as we did.  She finally came over and gave us some menus, took our drink order and that was it... we never saw her again.  While we waited we had a while to look over the menu.  All the British food sounded like some type of variation of pot roast.  I guess that's what British cuisine consists of but none of it sounded appealing.  Still waiting it gave me more time to look around and I started to get angry because I couldn't believe I was about to order food from such a dirty establishment (I could only imagine what the kitchen looked like).  I was shocked to see kids running around... I wouldn't take Bebe's kids in there. \n\nI clocked it; for 15 minutes we sat there without food or drinks, just menus.  Our booth faced the bar and the bartenders looked at us a few times but never sent anyone over to our table. Could I have asked for our server?  Sure.  But by this point I knew I wasn't spending a dime here and wanted to see how long it would take someone to come over to us so I could tell what I thought of their service.

As it was dinner time-ish I ordered up a Smithwicks and some Scotch Eggs.  Now I have had these served a variety of ways in the past and my preference is lightly breaded yet crisp crust with a relatively thick layer of sausage, served room temp to slightly warm.   Here they are served cold and quartered.  These were also some of the largest Scotch eggs I have had.  I got over the fact they were as cold as they were and begin to enjoy the flavor of the sausage layer with a hint of nutmeg.  The balsamic \"chutney\" served  with them was great, in the past at other places I usually enjoy a course deli mustard. What I didn't like about these Scotch eggs was the breaded layer.

Well we sort of got service from a staff member who seemed annoyed we bothered her to order. The drinks were slow to come out and for beer it wasn't very cold. Before we could ask for waters our server ran away. We did finally order \"food\" the curry wings looked like a pile of gooey vomit and didn't taste much better. There were three of us at the table, each regretfully had one wing and shoved the rest to the side. I ordered the Halo burger which had a crisp cheddar ring around it which was the best part. The burger itself was something straight from the freezer, pre-made greasy as all can be. No flavor and the condiments that came with the burger were the standard fare. The steak fries as a side should have stayed in the kitchen. They were underdone and soggy. No flavor either. My wife ordered the french dip, something that usually you can't screw up. Well these guys at G&D are batting 1000 with subpar food, I've tasted better french dips at hospital cafeterias. Our friend ordered the Reuben grinder, he said it was OK, but again the fries stayed on the plate. Our wait staff was non existent. She never bothered to check on us once. We had to stand up to show that we were ready for our check...that really didn't work so our friend had to track her down. Plan to ask for your check well ahead of time as they do not value your time. I guess we are the idiots for trying the place again but really you might get em on a bad day so give them the benefit of the doubt and try em again.

My first experience at the place was a few weeks after moving.  It was the middle of August and the AC and all refrigeration at the place had gone out.  Despite the rising heat in the place the bartenders were still moving quickly behind the bar and trying to make the most of the situation for the customers.  They let people know the situation and were knocking down prices as beers started to get a lil warm before things got fixed later on in the early evenning.  I noticed that lots of people still stuck around even with it getting pretty warm inside.  That to me meant on a regular day this was a good spot.\n\nEver since that first time and thinking there was a reason people stuck around, my thoughts have been proved right each time I go.  I have never had a bad time when I go into G&D.  The food is great, especially with the newer menu and cooking staff.  I have yet to have a bad item when I order food.  Most recently had the Turkey Club and it was a huge sandwich and very good.  The wings are always great and the potato soup on Thursdays is a good eat during Trivia.  Yeah, I said it, soup in AZ.\n\nStaff has always been great.  Like the servers at any and all restaurants, there are good servers and ok servers.  At G&D it is no different but here the OK servers are better than most you will find at other small pubs and bars.  When it gets overly busy orders can run slow but that should be expected during a huge rush.  Over all I have found that the staff is great and if you go there to enjoy yourself and treat them well, they return the favor.  I have been going to the G&D long enough that I have gotten to know most of the staff and have not had a bad experience with any of them.\n\nI am a big fan of this place and try to make it there once a weekend.

I have always enjoyed my cut/color, but never loved it.  What most annoys me about this place, and what sent me looking for a different salon is that they overbook their stylists.  This means the client gets assistants doing a lot of the work.  The assistants finish the foils, wash your hair, check on the color, and blow dry your hair.  It has always taken three hours.  Frankly, I don't have time for this; and at these prices, I don't want to share my stylist.  \n\nAlso, while I have never hated my cut/color, I have also never really loved them.  \n\nAt first, I thought I might have better luck if I went to a different stylist.  However, during my second visit, my original stylist went out of her way to come over to where I was to say hello.  I felt extremely guilty, and never felt comfortable switching stylists after that experience.  \n\nI have since switched to an aveda salon, and have found a stylist that I love that does my hair for $50 cheaper and she does it in a mere two hours.", "business_id": "VAHiEHdVPlG2DVG3YO6C7A", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-02-20", "type": "review"}

More than any other person in the cigar shop business, he has impacted my tastes. There is not another person I am familiar with who will take the time to walk you through that what's, where's and why's of cigars. His pricing is excellent and Mr. Lee personifies the reason why one will become a regular client: He cares and let's you know it. Answering some of the reviews below... The humidor IS cramped, but that is simply because he carries such a great range of products. And, yes, he and his staff don't want the shopper to manhandle the merchandise. If we were to look at who has written about not being able to \"touch\" the cigars, 9 out of 10 of them are the reason why that happens. Cigars are like works of art. The more hands that touch them, the more likely it is that a wrapper will become damaged, that the foot will split, etc. And to answer Mike's review: I have spent many, many hours in this shop. I have seen numerous newbies come in to buy a cigar. And I have NEVER, EVER heard a response like what you have documented come out of any of the staffers at Don's. I find it very interesting that you then hawk a quick ad for Cigar Warehouse down the street. Comparing Cigar Warehouse to Don's is like comparing a fast food hamburger to a Ruth's Chris steak. Both beef, or a Kia to an Aston Martin. If you are reading this and are looking for a cigar shop that represents the best in the business, go in to Don's, ask for Mr. Lee, tell him Charlie Knox sent you... and see what your experience is... Finally, as an addendum, David's review hawks other shops, also. This is classic Yelpian BS. Completely unsubstantiated trollish statements that on their very face are almost impossible to believe. WHO would ever cap a cash purchase at $10? No one, obviously. I know people (and I am one of them) who will travel MILES across the Valley to patronize Don's. Even if I am at a competitors shop (and that happens occasionally), Young Lee's name is spoken of with respect and honor. End of story: Go to Don's. Have a great experience.

This location is very conveniently located in Uptown Plaza next to AJ's.  Right off the light rail too.   I've been going for about a month now. My first class was with MJ who I think is awesome!  In fact all the instructors I've had, while all different, are pretty good in their own way.  They are great about keeping to the dialog and explaining the postures, and their benefits. They make sure to keep you reaching for more and I have noticed a major improvement in myself. \n\nThe studio is a good size but I will say I would prefer more studio space and less lobby space since the classes can be pretty large at times.  It's not a deal breaker by any means.   I think the cleanliness is pretty good.  I know past reviews have said it's not which makes me think they may have done something to improve because I don't feel it's bad at all.  But this is a Bikram studio, so not sure what people are expecting. People are sweating non stop all day in there.  For that alone, it's amazing how clean it is. \n\nI like that they supply a cleaner & towels to clean your mat after class.  This is handy and probably helps them make sure the class will have clean mats attending.\n\nThe men's locker room (which is all I can review) is actually very nice.  It's clean, a good size and it has nice cubes for your belongings.\n\nIf I had one compliant it wouldn't really be about the studio itself, but more about some of the new people attending.  I wish they would give the new students upon signing up, a run down of Bikram etiquette.  I have heard far too many people chatting in the studio before the instructor comes in.  Many students use the time before class to quietly meditate and center themselves as they prepare for class. With Groupons coming out, there tend to be a lot of \"first timers\" so it's important they know the etiquette before they enter the room.  Also leaving the room should be for emergencies only.  We are all dizzy and want to vomit, get past it!  Once a girl walked into class well into our second set of breathing exercises.  That was a little shocking since in most studios that is a huge No No!   When the class starts if you are late...No class for you.   \n\nIt's a great feeling and I am glad I have found something I really enjoy doing.

I did a lot of Bikram growing up and through high school but then went to college and never had the discretionary income to get back to it, but then I saw the Groupon. I couldn't turn down the deal! \n\nIt's the first Bikram studio I've been to (or heard of) since relocating to Phoenix, so I only have studios in San Francisco, CA to compare this one too. It's just really great here! I actually feel like the teachers care about my well being. Instructors walk around during class and pay attention to the students, while still keeping the class challenged and motivated. Most other studios I've been to, the instructor sits up on a box the entire time reciting things, barely looking around or concerned with anything else but what he or she needed to say within the 90 minutes. \n\nFrom the minute I walk in to the minute I leave, everyone is super friendly and helpful. The studio isn't too smelly either and is well kept. I was scared to go in after reading some of the reviews but it is far from awful compared to other studios I have been too. The scheduling of their classes is great too! One that can fit into anyone's schedule but more, one where students are stepping all over each other on their way in and out. There's definitely time to settle into class and time to linger in sivasana after.  \n\nAnother plus is that they offer a multitude of classes. They have traditional Bikram but also Vinyasa, Yin, Restorative, Sound Vibration and more! Now, I sound like I'm advertising, but I swear I'm not. It's just an all around great place!

He explained to her in great detail how the basket is supposed to work, and told her to bring her bike by and he'd take a look at it.  (My friend's basket tips whenever she puts something into it.)  We were enroute to her place to pick up her bike and head downtown to ride around, so we stopped back by Slippery Pig after we had her bike on her carrier.  The guy asked us to leave the bike for about 30 minutes, so we went over to Lux and had a hot beverage while we waited.  Less than 30 minutes later, we headed back.  He'd secured her bike with the part her old basket was missing.  She'd asked him about touch-up paint for her bike, because it had fallen off the rack when she first got it.  He'd found her the touch-up paint for her metallic green finish, rubbed out some deep scuffs with solvent, tightened her kickstand, and put air in her tire.  The part she bought cost about $16.\n\nI bought my Electra at another shop in town, but based on the friendly, more-than-expected service at the Slippery Pig, I think I'll bring my bike here for parts and service in the future.

As many have written, without supporting LBSs you couldn't have the community atmosphere or physically try the product.  \n\nI've been doing night rides with Slippery Pig for about two years and grown to know Eli and Byron.  I also met Eric the owner and he's always been easy to talk to and always had an open ear to some of my questions on bike equipment. \n\nI finally decided to pick up my first 29er hardtail and decided to go with the Scott Scale Expert. Rather than doing it myself I wanted to change out the drive train to a 2x10 set up and Slippery Pig was more than willing to oblige.  They went through the trouble of picking up the bike from their fountain hills location, change out the drive train and other upgrades I wanted within the same day.  Yes, same day!  \n\nI also wanted to change out the pedals to crank brothers but unfortunately they didn't have them in stock.  Eric just let me borrow some demo pedals while my new pedals came in so that I could enjoy my ride the next day.  In this writing I just picked up my new pedals (1 week turn around) and will be returning the demo pedals tomorrow.  Now if that isn't client service I don't know what is.\n\nCould it be the client service was directly related to my relationship with the staff.  You decide.  Could I have saved more buying on-line?  Sure.  But if you're in the mtb scene it's all about community.  I know the folks at Flat Tire, Airpark, and Rage and they're all a great bunch of guys.

I may have to go back on Christmas Eve to confirm this hypothesis.\n\nThe deal here is that drugstores, convenience stores, dollar stores, grocery stores, and discount department stores (Target, Walmart) all want each other's business and are gradually transforming into one another. So this Walgreens is sort of a baby Walmart: smaller! cuter! friendlier! oh-so-adorbs! let's chuck it under its sweet dimpled chin and buy lots of seasonal candy!\n\nWhile rival CVS has gone the route of wide aisles with cheerful-yet-strangely-useless signage, Walgreens is packing the merchandise in. The experience is much more like the drugstores I remember fondly as a child: narrow aisles, tons o' stuff, and you never know what you'll find. It has gone hogwild for minor convenience electronics -- the stuff like car adapters and chargers where it's a pain to figure out what store even to try. Also: walls of Ferro Rocher! \n\nThere may be a real niche here for \"what I want is too specialized for QT or Circle K to carry it, but if I have to face Walmart or the grocery store or the mall, I'm gonna cry\" shoppers. Keep an eye out for the house brands that are now being featured prominently (nice!, de-lish, savings with a smile), as the pricing on these can be really, really good. \n\nIn a sensible move, this Walgreens has recognized that people who are buying cat litter, batteries, lipstick, cold medication, bourbon, and orange juice at 4 a.m. are not people in any shape to figure out how to queue. The cash registers are approached by a cattle run built from candy and small-electronics displays, and as a person who's recently endured the Camelback/16th CVS's Queue of Mass Confusion, I am grateful that there is no ambiguity about where to line up and who's next.\n\nI want to see what happens with the displays when Christmas is no longer dominant before I get too giddy, but this store looks to have become a lot of fun.", "business_id": "HfWkdqxegjiGEXzI8j7Wwg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-12-22", "type": "review"}

Dr. Bracken has been caring for my family's teeth since before I was born. We are talking since the 1960's, friends.

I don't think there is an office person or hygenist that hasn't worked there for more than 20 years.That is REALLY a testament. \n\nThe hygenists, Kathy and Donna, are SO gentle when they clean your teeth.

I have no insurance, a cleaning, full X-Ray and exam by Dr. Bracken set me back less than $90. With no X-ray only $60. I never have to buy a toothbrush because they give you a brand new Oral-B with every visit, along with some dental floss. \n\nDr. Bracken is able to administer a local anesthetic so you don't even feel the needle prick. I've never been in pain during any procedure, cavity filling, etc. He explains everything and will take time to answer your questions.

She was kind, down-to-earth, smart and a good listener. However, in the end it was the doctor and one of the front office staff members who are the reasons why I won't return to this practice. As a 30-year-old married woman who moved to Scottsdale from CA, I was hoping to establish a relationship with an OBGYN here in the Valley so that I already have a trusting relationship with a doctor when my husband and I decide to have a baby. I was a happy patient of my last doctor for 12 years.  I scheduled my first appointment at this practice as a new patient and was seen by Whitney Padgett. It has always been my understanding that standards of care require doctors to actually see a patient if it is his or her first time going to a specialist. I was a bit shocked that I was seen only by Whitney and never a doctor at all, even though I was new to the practice. This aside, I returned for a second appointment and this time I saw Dr. Carol Hahn. I came to my appointment with Dr. Hahn for a problem and not the usual annual appointment, so naturally I was a bit worried. From the moment she walked in, Dr. Hahn was curt and condescending. She spoke to me as if I were below her. (I'm a professional working women who is married to a doctor) She typed notes on her keyboard with little eye contact. And, at one point corrected me as I was speaking about my health and at another point she made an unprofessional joke while performing my exam. However, the real shock to me came when she tilted her head down and asked me in a tone as if I was a teenage girl, \"Are you sexually active?\" I know this is a standard question, but my chart indicates that I am a married woman and that I take oral birth control for pregnancy prevention. Do you think she could have read my chart?? Or perhaps glanced at the clinical notes from my first visit to the practice? As I left this appointment, I was paying my co-pay and getting ready to head to work, I was told that I could not leave without paying the bill from my previous appointment. I explained that I had just received the bill two days prior for my previous appointment and had it at work with a stamp in my outgoing mail. I was told that I could not leave the building without paying that bill in person right then and there. When I explained that I'm still within the due date and that I have it ready to go in the mail, the lady told me that I would need to wait for a manager to approve it before I could leave. I told her that I needed to get to work and that I did not have the time to discuss this. I put the charge on my credit card to appease them and finally walked out the door. I can tell you that I will never return to this practice again. From the level of care I received to the treatment and finally the billing practices, this place was an unpleasant experience.", "business_id": "eovEq5kDSdf0WF_P_bD2Uw", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-02-27", "type": "review"}

I usually shy away from \"salad\" sandwiches because most places use too much mayo, or there's funky ingredients like walnuts or raisins or grapes.  I was feeling mighty brave today I guess.

I want to eat as many of them as possible from as many different places as I can.  And let me tell you, there is just something about the sandwiches from Cheese 'n Stuff.\n\nIt's not big on atmosphere.  There's a deli counter and then a few picnic tables with plastic tableclothes, some shelves stocking Swedish foodstuffs for sale as well as the store's backstock of chips, soda and paper towels.  They usually have some cheesy holiday decorations out.  It's cramped and not that pleasant.  I usually get my lunches to go.\n\nTheir sandwich menu consists of about a million pages printed out from an inkjet printer and taped to the wall, along with some hokey signs that say things like \"Today's Special: So's Tomorrow.\"  There's nothing slick or pretentious about it.  It's obviously just a shop owned by some guy and his wife and daughter.\n\nSo yeah.  The sandwiches.  I'm a vegetarian, and they have a simple yet elegant veggie sandwich that I find myself craving a lot.  It has cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, avocados, and some kind of dressing.  I get it on a wheat sub roll.  Not fancy, but oh-so-tasty.  I wish they had more veggie options, but this one satisfies me.\n\nI bring friends who eat meat here so I can tell them to order the Doughboy and enjoy it vicariously.  Their deli meat is high quality and there are loads of options.  It looks like the sort of place my grandpa would love and I want to bring him there some day.  No one I've brought in has been disappointed.\n\nThe sides are delicious.  I am a fan of the macaroni salad and the pasta salad that has the olives and italian dressing.  If I'm feeling indulgent, I'll get a brownie, a piece of cheesecake, or an ice-cold sarsaparilla.\n\nThe lack of atmosphere doesn't bother me; my one gripe with this place is how early they close.  There have been many times I haven't gotten moving early enough and haven't been able to get there before they close, which is 4 PM.

My current favorite is the orange beef. Slightly sweet and a bit spicy, it's cooked golden and crispy and makes my tongue extremely happy. \n\nThe dining room is wide open. No booths. All tables. The volume can get a little loud when there are many patrons, and there usually... there are many patrons.  \n\nOne thing that sets them apart from other Chinese places I've tried is the way that some of the chicken dishes are prepared. Typically, little bites of chicken are battered, fried and covered in sauce. At China Chili, the entire cut of chicken is battered, THEN sliced and covered in sauce. This makes it visually more appealing and you aren't consuming so much batter and grease.\n\nI'll be back many times in the future so I can get my Chili on.", "business_id": "-3WVw1TNQbPBzaKCaQQ1AQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2007-01-19", "type": "review"}

The inside is a vast room filled with beautiful chandelier lighting and stunning Chinese artwork. Looked pretty fancy for the price, so it's a good choice to take someone special with the apperance you have money. I asked for a small table in the back corner to eat in peace among the sparse group of younger and older people present. \n\nMenu was quite large, with a deep selection of various choices. I was feeling seafood tonight, so I went with the Kung Pao Calamari which according to the menu is spicy and hot. Faster than I could say Toa chie, the dish arrived. No joke, the server walked into the kitchen and the food came out in about 2 minutes. That's insane and impressive. \n\nThe Kung Pao Calamari in presentation was great and looked delicious on the oval plate. Red, green bell peppers, cucumbers, peanuts and of course the calamari. Scooped up some calamari with various bits of vegetables and upon first impression it was quite good, although the calamari was fairly rubbery more than what I'm used to. The chewing went on longer than I was hoping. Good nonetheless and acceptable. Portion of food was more than adequate with a side of rice as is customary. I did not sense any spiciness to the food which I found disappointing as I do love a little kick in my seafood. I'd honestly like to try something else next time I come here. I sense the potential here.\n\nOverall, China Chili for the price and the atmosphere it's worth it. I would actually rate this place if I was able, close to 3 and half stars as the food wasn't as dynamic as the more upscale authentic places I've been to but then again I didn't expect that either.

I walked in on a Saturday morning with two of my bridesmaids hoping to find a little guidance about DIY wedding flowers, prices, and possibly secure a vendor.  The store is a very intimate, cozy feeling shop, with flowers everywhere (of course) and lovely Christmas decorations ('twas the season).  After explaining what I was trying to do, the lady behind the counter sat us down at a table with several wedding flower books, flower flash cards (so they seemed) and a stack of post-its.  After we mulled over the options for a while and I narrowly avoided a few hysterical moments by the array of decisions I had to make, she came back over to see how we were doing.  We chatted for a while about the benefits of various flowers, the availability in April, prices, colors, etc.  By the time we were done talking I finally felt confident about what I wanted to do!  I'm sure I will call upon Community Florist when I'm ready to place my order- they will hold my flowers trimmed and in a bucket in their cooler until I'm ready to pick them up, and can even keep finished centerpieces cool if I need to hold them in the meantime.   \n\nIf I wasn't taking on the feat of doing all the flowers myself, I'd trust the project to this shop too, based on what I saw while I was there and the knowledge I gleaned just from one conversation.\n\nIt was definitely a positive experience, which I needed!", "business_id": "imSAkSzL5X1rUc3Z1ZMYeA", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-12-30", "type": "review"}

Note the name. That's your tip-off.\n\nIf you carry a large purse or tote bag, lock it in your vehicle, as the aisles here are very, very narrow. The vintage clothing selection was huge and looked amazing, but I literally didn't dare turn to look at it for fear of sending a shelf of china flying. Clothing is something for next time.\n\nThere is a LOT of glass and china for the space, and it's not the same five dish patterns that you'll find in every antique mall. If you're looking for something specific, I imagine that the best approach is to act as if you're in the sheep's knitting shop in Through the Looking Glass. Follow the shelves with your eyes slooooowwwwwly up to the ceiling, hoping that your item will not ascend hastily through the ceiling to escape you. If that fails, shut your eyes, think hard about what you want, then try again. There's a better than average chance that it will appear.\n\nThere's also all sorts of jewelry and tiny bits of things. The delight of this shop is that it's not \"curated\" or \"precious,\" but it somehow has a point of view, and the owner is truly the nicest person ever. This is a store for when you're in the mood to browse and chat and stumble over remarkable things -- not for when you're on the track of a list of home decor -- as it requires exploration and nothing is priced; and if you take the experience for what it is, it is literally a refreshing step back to a simpler time with better housewares, some of which you can buy and take home.\n\nIt doesn't hurt that it's now part of the most adorable vintage strip mall in Phoenix, along with the Purple Lizard (your one-stop Instant Wise Southwestern Woman boutique), Southwest Gardener (all that glitters for your landscaping), and the Original Hamburger Works (what Fuddruckers aspired to be, with authenticity).\n\nOn my visit, the back door gave only onto the mall's shared internal patio (a charming place for a winter lunch), but depending on your timing, your luck may be different.", "business_id": "pKp50rYh0iWZYKiWmWmLow", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-12-16", "type": "review"}

Hanratty's offers nearly something for everyone, from video games and darts to pool and casual convos tucked inside one of their wooden benches. Open yet cozy, this bar has the ideal mixture of ample lighting with dark wood furniture and ceiling to create what some may call \"your neighborhood dive bar.\" There's nothing really dingy about this place. It's not unsafe or anything, yet I like how you feel a bit off the beaten path when you come here. There's a few places to park along the East side or in the back. Plus, the place is really a cinch to find since it's right off the Southside of the street with a sign announcing you've found your watering hole. \n\nSaid to be an Ohio State bar, you don't really see much sporting merchandise here - a good thing, if you ask me. I'm told the beer selection is good, although when I tried to order something seasonal, they didn't have anything. Bummer. Instead, I went with the tried-and-true Sam Adams, followed by a Stella Artois. Both were served in a bottle, although the bartender tried to pour my Sam Adams into a glass. I had to stop him. \"Just the bottle,\" I said. \"That's enough for me.\" If memory serves me, each beer cost me $4. My companions opted for draft pints of Coors and Michelob Ultra. So, if domestics are your thing, H.B.'s has your vice in abundance. \n\nI can definitely see myself hanging here, playing some pool or throwing some darts. Overall, the music was decent. I think they went from Rehab to Richard Cheese. Not quite sure how that happened, but it was interesting nonetheless. \n\nBartender was friendly, albeit a bit \"snottish\" when I asked to see a beer menu. He had none. Instead, he asked, \"What are you looking for and I'll tell you if we have it.\" I would have much preferred a few choices rattled off to me since I couldn't really see the dusty bottles aligned on the shelf, nor did I intend to lean over the bar to take inventory. I must admit, I was a little put off by that. I guess he wasn't used to a patron wanting something other than \"swamp water\" (Bud or Coors). \n\nIn any case, I like this place. I'd definitely go back.\n\nWord to wise: This is a CASH ONLY bar, although I'm told they have an ATM inside (although I didn't see it or go hunting for it, either).

I like AABC for all the reasons he doesn't like them.  Yes, they may only sell comics and toys but they do that better than anyone else. It's about quality not quantity.  He asked how they stay in business when there are so many comic stores in the valley.  The truth is the other stores are garbage. Read on\n\n(1)  They don't pilfer through the comics before putting them on the shelves. The owner even unloads the comics from the boxes right in front of you and lays them out on a glass table. So if you are guy who is trying to acquire that CGI 10.0, you will have a chance at this store. At Atomic Comics and the other stores, they go through the comics before the store opens and selectively remove the comics in the very best condition for their employees.\n\n(2) They leave the comics on the shelves longer. They are not greedy. They don't pull a comic off a shelf and mark it up a $1-$2 a week to two weeks later. They only do this if a comic is ridiculously hot which is rare. It's nice to know that you can find a comic a month after it arrived on the market selling at cover price. There is not another comic store in Phoenix that does this. Take my word for it. I've been to everyone and they pull them off the shelves quickly\n\n(3) They don't stuff their shelves and the comics are in great condition. I have been to every comics store in the valley and AABC is the only store in which the comics are consistently in great conditions on the shelves. You will not see bent corners. You won't see shelves being overly stuffed so that the first few issues and the last few issues in a stack are damaged. \n\n(4) Inventory- If its not at AABC, I go to the internet because it's not going to be at any other store in the valley.  I have too many stories of walking into other comic stores and requesting an issue and they are out or don't have it only to find 2 or 3 copies at AABC.\n\n(5) Sales: there is not another store in the valley that gives you 25% of everything in the store on Jan 1st and July 4th every year.  That includes the high priced collectors items like Incredible Hulk 181. They also have a graphic novel punch card much like a Subways sandwhich card. \n\n(6) Service: It has a mom and pop feel so you get to know the actual owners of the store. The employees actually work and are helpful if you ask questions. They are not just standing around chatting with each other like you find at Atomic Comics.  They are also humble and are not condescending. This is a great place for collectors and readers of all experience. They are also not pushy. They don't push any comics on people. I love how you can stare at comics for 45 min  in peace without someone hassling you or making you feel guilty.  They will help if you need it but they will leave you alone. \n\n(7) Ambience: I feel like I'm walking into a Comic store not a Nine Inch Nails museum.  It's colorful, clean, organized and easy to navigate. it doesn't look like some cheap strip mall store like Heroes or god forbid Stalking Moon in which it seems like some Geek bough a collection on Ebay and decided to pay rent next to some Chinese buffet and open a comics store.\n\n(8) JUST COMICS: This is exactly why I come here.  I was at Atomic Comics in Chandler and I couldn't even check out some comics because the shelf was being blocked by a card table.\n\n(9) Clientele:  Look, I'm not a typical comic collectors. I don't wear tight black shirts,  I have no facial hair or piercings, I'm not up to date on all the independent \"alternative\" comics, I love Marvel and DC. I can't stand \"Goth.\" Yeah,  I'm a regular guy who also happens to like comics. If you are one of these people, you will feel comfortable here.  If you haven't read comics in ages and just wanna check out the scene,  this is your place  \n\n(10) KNOWLEDGE: The employees are educated about comics but are not pretentious. Phil is a comics' genius but he isn't intimidating. Eddie is very up-to-date on all the latest indie stuff but he will tell you honestly what he thinks about an issue and if a series is worth collecting. No pushy sales people\n\nTo show that I'm not the owner and to be fair, I do think their prices can be steep and I don't always think their older items are accurately described. I also think they can charge too much for variant issues when they first arrive. Their toy prices are pretty fair and you can get steals in this", "business_id": "y9cQ0DBC0qFNgkpTXHzokA", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-01-13", "type": "review"}

(See: Atomic Comics in Mesa)\n\nWhen you walk in the front door, it smells like comic books. Which is somehow appropriate, because AAB&C is one of those no-nonsense-type specialty retailers... like those stores you see in a strip mall in South Phoenix with the simple title of \"GUNS\". (What's next? A restaurant called \"FOOD\"? But I digest.)\n\nAt first glance, you might wonder what AAB&C has that other comic retailers don't. Frankly... as far as buying comics on a week-to-week basis goes... nothing, really. But when it comes to old comics, All About is all alone at the top of the heap. \n\nYou see, I haven't lived in AZ all my life... but someone was kind enough to inform me that in the 90's... All About wasn't just one store. They had a bajillion stores spread all across this absurdly large civic pitri dish we call Phoenix. But when the comic book crash happened in the late 90's or whatever... they narrowed down to just one location. So ALL of the old back issues from seven or so stores had to be put into one warehouse. Which is why if you ask for basically any old comic that isn't Action Comics #1... they'll have it.\n\nThe only complaint I can offer is the music selection. It's just so wimpy and non-committal.

I asked the representative if my friend could have flowers in her room, to which he replied, \"Yes\".  At that point I called McDonald and placed the order.

Went yesterday, in a rush to pick up a small bear as a gift for a friend's young daughter who was down the road at the Phoenix Children's Hospital. I expected it to be a little busy. It wasn't particularly busy, maybe about ten people all up. Fortunately, I found what I wanted quickly. First problem, there were apparently two \"locations\" in the store for checkouts, and one of them was very cramped up against the merchandise (enough for no more than two people to stand one behind the other). Not particularly good feng shui. I went to the other, which only had a couple of people in line. A lady looked at me curiously from behind the counter (I hadn't even reached the front, the person in front of me was still being served by someone else) and then took my stuffed bear. She looked at the tag, futzed around for about ten seconds, then leaned back and handed it to me and said \"I'm just going to give this back to you...\" Then she walked to the far rear area behind the counter and proceeded to ignore me. Talked to someone. Got a sheaf of papers. Walked around. Put down papers. Talked to someone else. I stood there, still in line, and watched her walk around. Then when she asked someone else in the store area if they needed help I realised that she had dropped me. I stopped her and asked her if there was anything that she needed from me and she just told me to wait in line and someone else would attend to me. Fair enough. Then another person leaned out and took my bear (again, bear in mind that I was still \"waiting\" for the others in front to be done) and laid it on the counter \"ready\" to be checked out. I waited. Then one person consulted with the other, both with relatively confused looks. I had no idea what was going on. It seemed like none of them had ever worked there before! One person actually offered to take off the tag (with price along with other instructions) then talked to the other to ask if they needed the tag. Turns out that their credit card system was down - figures - and I was asked to sign a printout despite choosing to pay as debit. They then advised me to check and call if there were any problems, which I took to mean that I could be doublecharged or something. Finally, at least twenty-five minutes later I was out of there. I haven't seen that much confusion since bingo night in the stroke ward. Won't be back.", "business_id": "c3BCBElZ1C1gIJFQg6Hu1w", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-02-15", "type": "review"}

The problem is, they are REALLY expensive. Recently I read about some \"Padron Alternatives\" online. These are cigars that are made to feel, look and taste as close to the real things as possible. Deciding to order some online I suddenly realized as I was entering the payment information that these were going to be shipping from here in the Valley. Not only that, one of their locations was right down the street from my office.\n\nSo yesterday, instead of going to lunch, I headed down to Cigar Warehouse to try a couple of these fake Padrons. Now the cigars themselves were not Padrons by any means. But they were pretty good for the price, good enough that I bought a bundle. But that's not the point of this review. \n\nThe store was not huge, but a decent size. The whole place is essentially one big walk-in humidor. Their selection is not as good as someplace like Tinder Box in Ahwatukee, but decent nonetheless. They have a lot of big brands, as well as their own \"alternatives\" to some of the more expensive premiums which I mentioned above.\n\nThey also have a little smoking lounge with over-stuffed leather couches. That was nice. It was good to be able to have some water, enjoy my purchase, and not have to pay a large annual membership for the privilege. \n\nBut what I really enjoyed about the place was the conversation. The guy working there was pleasant to talk to, and some of the customers also joined in the conversation. One thing, maybe the only thing, I miss about living in Indiana is having a lot of people I can just talk to--conversation that goes beyond sports or cars or the weather. This place was a taste of that. \n\nI'll be back often.", "business_id": "PQ-h1-ahAwkICsz5-Zl5Qg", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-01-21", "type": "review"}

I can definitely see how it is not for everyone. Girls can be mean and gossipy, the work is tough, commuting from North Scottsdale was both tiresome and exciting. \n\nAll Catholic school girl rumors aside the education that you receive from Xavier is priceless, it took me going to college to really value and appreciate my education from there. The best thing to take away from here is the ability to study and critical thinking skills, all of which made college a breeze.\n\nEven after college I continue to value Xavier. Flipping through the alumni magazine and reading up on old classmates keeps me inspired to keep learning and bettering myself. So many girls have gone to grad school and/or have great careers ahead of them. Or they living all over the world either working or volunteering. Nowhere else can you find so many people having such great experiences. If not starting a great career, then they are starting great families.\n\nXavier is timeless.

Unprofessional business all around\n\nMr. Osselaer,\n\nI hope the New Year finds you well.  Unfortunately, my husband and I were surprised to receive a letter from Mr. Hoffman dated December 30th, 2014 in the mail.  I have never been met with such a lack of professionalism or common courtesy.\n\nExcerpt from Mr. Hoffman's letter:\n\"All vehicles must be parked in the garages; your renter has three vehicles.  They also have a motor-cycle they keep in the garage so they cannot put two cars in the garage; therefor two cars are parked in the guest parking areas.  Two of the vehicles must be parked in the garage.  I have spoken to your renters about the parking situation.  Owners or renters cannot park in the guest parking areas.  Your renters told me that they are going to move please let me know if this is true and if not they will have to work on getting their card in to the garage.\"\n\nI first called and spoke with Mr. Hoffman on November 18th, 2014 about the parking situation at The Village at Sonoran Hills.  It was a very polite conversation in which Mr. Hoffman instructed me how to obtain parking passes for my family until he was able to speak with the board about a recent situation in which approximately 8 residents had their vehicles towed from the parking structure across the street.  Mr. Hoffman informed me he would call me back within 1 week.  I had to make multiple phones calls to his office and leave multiple messages on his voice mail and with the office receptionist.  I also sent two follow up e-mails which were not replied to. Not once did he return any of my calls.  I had to call repeatedly in one day to finally have the receptionist put my call through. \n\n- Not in my original e-mail: I was told he had not yet spoken to the HOA and to wait longer. -\n\nThe above except from Mr. Hoffman's letter seems to imply that we are parking in guest parking areas without the verbal permission of Mr. Hoffman.  He verbally informed us twice exactly which two parking spaces to park in and what to write on our parking passes until he had spoken to the board.  We have not heard from Mr. Hoffman until the referenced letter arrived.  To cc: our landlords in a letter that makes mention to my family considering the possibility of moving due to the situation is proof of Mr. Hoffman's complete lack of professionalism.  A property manager should in no way inform a tenants landlord they are considering the possibility of moving. That is a decision my husband and I should make.  \n\nI made it very clear to Mr. Hoffman that my husband and I did not want to move, but would accept the decision of the board if it was not in our favor.  We are not opposed to change and I was in no way using the possibility of moving as a threat when speaking with Mr. Hoffman.  The parking situation changed (no longer being able to park across the street or at the school) and my husband and I were married in August '14, thus bringing the addition of a 3rd vehicle.  We tried to address the situation and find a resolution prior to any decisions being made.  Instead we were met with the actions of Mr. Hoffman.  \n\nI would appreciate a return phone call to address my e-mail by Tuesday of next week.  I feel a return e-mail would be disrespectful.", "business_id": "Uj_doROgb3Nnhl7MLslS-w", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-01-07", "type": "review"}

I am a huge fan of Chipotle and due to everyone's reviews that this restaurant is of a similar concept, it was my idea to go there. \n\nOnce there, there were only two young girls behind the counter, no one else in the restaurant. Because I had never been there, I was looking over their menu. The girl however, seemed in a rush to get my order done so she could go back to talking to her co worker. As I was going through the line I was asking for recommendations on what she thought went best together but again, she seemed bother to help me and had a bad attitude. She kept making comments on the fact they didn't charge extra for guacamole and I figured it was their job to sell you on that. Also, the food behind the counter seemed like it was sitting there all day and did not look appetizing at all. There was trash on the floor of the restaurant and there was even chairs on top of the tables. For a restaurant that didn't seem busy at all I would expect cleanliness. \n\nI ended up paying $11.00 for a bowl that seemed smaller than the bowls at chipotle that I would normally spend $9.00 for even with the extra guacamole.

I live almost right across the street. I have a regular vet but he is much further away.\n\nLast year I adopted an elderly dog from a rescue society. Her name is Isabelle. Who ever had her before took terrible care of her teeth. She needed a dental specialist and very costly surgery. The rescue organization paid for her to receive the costly treatment and she has been a wonderful pet and companion to our three year old. We brush her remaining teeth every day. But she is old.\n\nI called our regular vet to get her teeth checked as it is National pet dental health month and usually they are greater savings during this month. (my husband's job and the housing market has caused me to be hard pressed to spend too much money on vet bills). The price they wanted was almost a house payment and the poor dog only has seven teeth left!\n\nI decided to try East Maryland. They were wonderful to poor sweet Isabelle. She got a free exam to let us know what it may cost. They checked out her heart, gave her a blood test, extracted four more teeth and shined up the lonely remaining three teeth. It was half the cost of the other vet. Not that the cost was the main factor, but it was a huge help. Dr. Schroeder is very skilled and compassionate. Isabelle's breed is difficult to operate on and given her age and tiny size, it was extra risky. They took every precaution to make sure she was stable. They were so good to our old girl. The techs treated her with kit gloves. They even trimmed her toenails while she was asleep. The next morning they called to see how she was doing.\n\nShe has recovered beautifully. It is less that a week and she tried to steel a chew stick from our younger dog.

Oh, but I wanted to be. I mean, a local brewhouse right down the street from where I live? I thought for sure this would become my home away from home. Instead, it was so mediocre and underwhelming, I can't help but wonder, \"Will I ever be back?\" Probably not. \n\nMy friend and I walked into the restaurant side of Sonora. I wanted to sit in the Den, where the brews are crafted. We were told to cross over the patio to the place next door. Alright. So, we did. Hardly anyone was there. In fact, the place didn't really pick up until the time we were leaving. Must've been the football game that drew people in, for there was a flat screen plasma TV behind the bar. \n\nSpeaking of bar, I was excited to try their Vanilla Porter. I was told it was so good, it would make you wanna slap yo' mama. \"My mama needs a good slappin',\" I thought. Well, she didn't get it. Ok, so maybe vanilla + beer isn't my thing, but I wanted to try something new, something special to this brewhouse. After all, isn't that the point? The kick and finish of this beer did not impress me. In fact, I struggled a bit to finish  my pint, which, was $2.75 during happy hour. At the very least, the prices to whet my whistle were great! \n\nMy friend and I opted to try the food. I felt brave and ordered the bratwurst. Maybe I'm not a bratwurst person, for it was just okay. Nothing else on the menu appealed to me, even though they do tend to have a variety (fish and chips to grilled salmon to soup and burgers). \n\nThe layout of the place was somewhat unusual. I mean, two seating areas connected by an outdoor patio area (with heaters). That was cool, except that when my friend and I left the Den, we had to cross the patio to get to the exit (in the other building). Along the way, I got one giant whiff of cigarette smoke.

Except that nobody seems to know my name there in spite of how frequently I come. But then, I'm not part of the 30-something clientle who sets up shop at the bar.\n\nI roll into a booth or a high table that has the best view of the games that are on. It's a great place to come down and see local sports or tie one on after a terrible local sports performance. Not great because of the televisions or presentation of the games in any way(which is just two smaller flat screen TVs with no sound in the main room), but because of the laid-back, true-to-its-locale atmosphere it emits. It just seems perfectly in place and makes it feel natural  to hang out and throw some back more then any other bar around town that tries to force its motif into a Phoenix landscape it just doesn't jive with.\n\nAnd of course the food and beverage there don't hurt its cause at all. I do agree with some people's sentiments about particular beers not being up to snuff compared to other breweries. My particular complaint is with their Pale Ale, which tastes like an IPA, and their IPA, which tastes like a medicinal strength IPA. But in spite of some quibbles with the beers here, they really do have some fantastic stuff. For some reason, the beer that is my standby there is the Light Rail Cream Ale, which is in stark contrast to the Brown and Amber Ales I typically get at other breweries. Its got that perfect taste/refreshment balance that acts as a Siren's call to bring me back here at least once a week.\n\nThe burgers, salads, and pizza's are also fantastic. But the real find here is the bread pudding, which has got to be one of the best bread pudding's in existence. I always try to eat slow to make room for it. Luckily, this is a place that won't care how long you cement yourself to a seat.\n\nWhich again, makes this place perfect for some Suns action or whatever is going on. But I probably remember my trips here best after catastrophic defeats. Last year after the Sun's officially bowed out of the playoffs without a championship for yet another season, and with my brother after ASU (he's an alum) lost to Oregon are the first that come to mind.

A patio that, I might add, was surprisingly quiet given its proximity to the road.  It was just the right noise level for either eaves dropping or reading.  The food all smelled really pretty good as far as bar food goes and the nacho plate we milked for an hour and a half was made with real cheese.

Once we moved down here, we started pining for the brewery scene. We gave Sonora brewhouse a shot.\n\nGranted, our expectations are very high. OCB is THE social hub for the locals. We knew we weren't going to find the same thing here, being that Phoenix has so many cool haunts available.\n\nWhat we were looking for was a good patio, good beer, and a good atmosphere. Sonora Brewhouse delivers on all counts. The good food was a bonus. It's not great food, but it'll do. We've learned to stick to a few select items. \n\nThe chips and salsa are wonderful. If you're lucky, the flour tortilla chips will still be warm. They are fluffy, light, and delicately crisp. The salsa is the traditional smooth style, with just the right amount of heat. \n\nThe other go-to food item is the American Kobe beef burger. It is so juicy, so flavorful and delicious. It's big enough to share, if you're more interested in sampling the beer, but want a snack to keep you going -- which is my usual strategy.\n\nI'm not really wowed by the beers. I think I have tried four or five of them, and of those, only two stood out for me. The seasonal vanilla porter is lovely and luscious, like a creme brulee in a pint glass - but without overdoing it. Typically, I am a dark beer drinker, but the Light Rail Cream Ale won me over. For a light beer, it has surprising amounts of body and flavor. One could easily wile away a warm Winter's afternoon kicking those back.\n\nAs for the atmosphere, it is casual, but I wouldn't say friendly. I've been there probably six or seven times, and haven't had a single conversation with a stranger. \n\nAlso, they play great music -- if you can hear it! Often, I can make out faint notes of Janis Joplin or the Doors. I'm told that the patio speakers are as loud as they can get.

Enticed by a brewhouse in AZ I had to go in, I was also enticed by the fact that they were offering a Happy Hour from 3-6 even on a Sunday (it seemed that most places here in AZ don't offer Happy Hour Specials on Sunday).  I was slightly disappointed when I found out that it wasn't a real happy hour, but a kind of happy hour (real happy hour is 2 for 1 drinks or fifty percent off, being honest here) while the happy hour offered here was a dollar off drinks.  In fairness they offered half off appetizers, but only the one's without meat. Now I have read Michael Pollan as well and I am down with everyone consuming less meat (especially here in the Southwest) but it seemed a little rough to have rules like that at a beer drinkin' place....Anyway, I started off with the Barleywine. My mom had the root beer. The waitress returned several times to see if \"us guys\" were okay. When I was ready to order a second glass, the Trooper IPA caught my eye. My love affair with hoppy beers is so great, but she was kind enough to bring me a few small samples before I ordered it. In the end I went with the Amber Ale.

Needless to say, I wasn't in the best mood and I had thought I was settling in for an evening of fantastic food served in small portions on pristine white dishes.\n\nInstead, I pulled a 180 and went to SunUp because it was close and it was on my food list.\n\nThe interior didn't put me off. Though it's not a \"classy\" brewpub, the interior sports soft lighting, Spanish colors and a certain amount of elegance. I'm not saying you should take a date here if you're trying to impress her, but it's certainly acceptable before or after a movie.\n\nThe atmosphere is laid back. A curved bar sits behind a simple floor stacked with numerous square tables both normal and high-top. Brewing equipment stands behind a plastic wall off to one side. A small doorway leads to a narrow room lined with booths on either side. The place is not that big, but it's not small either.\n\nThe menu consists of standard pub fare with a few Spanish touches. Appetizers have the normal dips and fried dishes. The homemade bruschetta caught my eye, however. It was a bit strong on the garlic and not very well done. Outside of the typical burgers, sandwiches and wraps, they do feature some interesting entrees. I ordered the special - shrimp fajitas. It came with one giant flour tortilla which confused me, but overall it wasn't bad. My friend ordered the salmon which was a much better effort.\n\nAs for the beer, they featured six standard offerings along with three seasonal. Of the typical offerings, most were a little too sweet and a little low on the hop side, especially those of lighter color meant to appeal to the masses. However, the low amounts of hops did allow the floral and citrus notes to come through on the IPA. My favorite was the seasonal Red along with the Vanilla Porter, which though sweet, had a robust chocolaty character. Bonus point for the dry-hopped, cask conditioned version of the IPA as well.\n\nThe service was alright. She didn't know much about the beers, but could at least distinguish one from the other via color, even among those that looked quite similar.\n\nOverall, the place is alright.

Maybe some remember the old Tommy Knocker's, but that's as close as we have ever had. Recently when SunUp split from Sonora Brewhouse, they also added a brewery next door and have been increasing in popularity ever since. However, they come up short in terms of providing a top quality microbrewery, and SunUp only shines as a good neighborhood bar that happens to brew their own beers. \n\nOn mutiple visits, I've tried multiple beers. The first visit, sampling the Red Cask Ale, I had a mostly positive feel about the beer. It was bold, reasonably priced, and packed quite a punch. I also sampled the Light Rail Cream Ale that night, which was essentially a standard ale by my count. The bartender explained while serving it that the name is \"a bit misleading\" because most, like myself, are expecting more of an ale with a stout-like finish. The Vanilla Porter is their best brew in my opinion, with the most distinct flavor and a perfect balance in aroma. I've become quite enamored with porters lately and SunUp's didn't disappoint, but it also didn't drive me to proclaim it one of the best porters around.\n\nService at the restaurant has been hit and miss. One visit with an empty bar, we were waited on hand and foot, but also felt as though the staff wanted to close up and go home. They were putting chairs on the tables, sweeping the floors, and doing general closing duties, though they insisted they were not closing for a \"couple more hours.\" Another visit I sat at the bar for quite some time with no bartender present, and the bar obvoiusly understaffed.\n\nAll in all, it's a welcome addition, and compliments the other establishments popping up around Central and Camelback very nicely. Unfortunately, Central Phoenix could still use a top-notch microbrewery. SunUp, right now, has too many inconsistencies, and doesn't have great enough beer to make them not matter. One can get a good beer just about anywhere, but it would be nice to find a great beer brewed locally, so here's to hoping SunUp comes up with a great beer.", "business_id": "3UMcsN9IjoeV8JZvC4apag", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-02-17", "type": "review"}

I had planned on meeting a friend at Angel's Trumpet Ale House (another fine venue for beer fans) only to find out they were closed on Mondays. SunUp however, was open and was my first suggestion so that I could still hang out with my lovely lady friend who is also a connoisseur of fine beers.\n\nSunUp turned out to be a cozy little place to enjoy beer and some righteous grubble. Knowing that my drinking companion was also a vegetarian (although she allows for bacon, which makes her an ovolactopesciporkatarian), we chose to split the nachos (sans meat) and the smoked salmon reuben. We also sampled the onion rings, which were downright tasty (especially if you sweet talk the waitress into bringing you a side of the remoulade that is normally served with their shrimp)! Although I found the smoked salmon reuben a tad on the salty side, I appreciated the fact that it was served on a nice marble rye.\n\nAs for the beer, I found it fresh and quite drinkable. They offer their own house beers as well as guest taps, so I found the selection was ample enough to satisfy my beer wanderlust. The atmosphere was my favorite element of SunUp... it seems to be a great gathering place and yet it is intimate enough to serve as a decent place to take a date. Even better if your date digs beer, but you definitely won't be disappointed with the gem\u00fctlichkeit (cozy ambiance).

I usually prefer amber or brown ales but there is something a little off about their amber. So, I did not really ever make it a point to visit their brewery before. Then I saw that last week, for AZ beer week, they were doing something kind of fun. Beer floats. That's right, they had paired four of their beers with different flavors of gelato: cream ale with strawberry gelato, pale ale with blood orange sorbet, amber with sea salt caramel gelato and vanilla porter with tahitian vanilla gelato. Some were better than others but it made for a fun experience. I just love the fact that there are so many breweries in town now and they each have their own vibe but yet they are all part of the local craft beer community.\n\nThe brewery itself was very homey and comfortable. It was decorated with a lot of wood paneling that was probably left over from the seventies but it gave it sort of a cozy country lodge feel. They have a nice inner courtyard with a secluded patio even though they are on a major street in the middle of downtown. There is a larger separate room where it seems most people who are eating a meal get a table, but the main bar area is pretty small. Most of the people there seemed to be regulars and it was an eclectic mix of ages and personalities. The bartender (who was also the hostess and the server) was very friendly and that also contribuited to the warm and fuzzy feeling we got while sitting at the bar.\n\nThough I don't go that often, I will probably return to SunUp. Firstly because I have discovered that their porter is actually pretty good, and secondly because it just seems like a cool place to hang out. The main thing that kept them from another star was the awful smell in the ladies room. My hubby said it was even worse in the mens. Gross.

Not only was it the day after the worst \"holiday\" on the planet... Valentines Day, but it was also the first day of Arizona Beer Week. This was particularly special because it's my first time experiencing AZ Beer Week. \n\nTo start the celebration off, we went to SunUp Brewing Company. I don't know much about them, but it turns out they do sell beer and they also make some really good food.\n\nI tried two of their brews, the Amber was the first. Pretty good. I would say it's a little lighter in flavor than other ambers I've had, but I liked it and would order it again. \n\nNext up was the Light Rail Cream Ale. Their description says that this is their closest thing to a domestic and I couldn't agree more. It's light, crisp and refreshing. \n\nNow to the food. We started with the pretzel bites which were okay. The best part about them was the side of mustard. It was actual legit mustard with mustard seeds, not the yellow nasty goop people put on hot dogs at baseball games. \n\nThen I had the Trooper IPA Pulled Pork sandwich with a side of the Green Chile Mac & Cheese. The sandwich had cole slaw on it with delicious tender BBQ pulled pork. I haven't had a BBQ sandwich that good since I left the South. I also haven't sought out BBQ too much since I've been in Phoenix, but bottom line is that it was a really good sandwich. \n\nThe Mac & Cheese was also a winner. Giant elbow pasta with a nice mix of creamy and stringy cheese in each bite. The green chiles added some uniqueness, but I would have liked it just the same without them.\n\nThe service was super friendly. Very good food and beer.

To whereas, I seem to have aged exponentially. Probably from having two beautiful children that siphon my life force. Current estimates predict that I will look like a more weathered version of Death Wish franchise actor Charles Bronson within 18-24 months. But for some reason Dr. Laris and MIke are somehow unaffected by the normal aging process. There are two plausible explanations for this. A) They are a member of some tribe of vampire/lycanthrope hybrids that leapfrog through time and remain young, or B) They now a thing or two about healthy and attractive skin. Whether it is the former or latter, they are both great people and are outstanding medical professionals in a specialty field.

Our pediatrician gave us a list of orthopedic surgeons to consult and although Dr. Shindell was at the top of the list, we actually went to the second name -- one of the largest orthopedic groups in the valley -- first. When we met with that first surgeon, he said he could help our son but given the size and placement of the cyst and the risk of it breaking, he recommended that we go to someone who handles these type of cases more often. We asked who he would recommend if it were his son, and he said Dr. Shindell.\n\nWhen we called Dr. Shindell's office, they were able to get us in for an appointment the next day. Needless to say, we were extremely anxious, but Dr. Shindell's calm demeanor and extensive experience helped us worry less. He explained all the options (including a brand new procedure that just finished clinical trials) and possible long-term effects. There was absolutely no pressure to take any one option over the others, and he was willing to give us the weekend to think over our options.\n\nIt took us about 20-minutes to decide what to do. Dr. Shindell immediately set up the surgery date and called Hanger Orthotics to squeezed us in for a fitting even though it was the end of day on a Friday.\n\nThe following week, our son had his surgery (would have been sooner, but we had to wait for his custom brace to be made). Dr. Shindell met us at the hospital to explain the details of the surgery ahead of time. After the surgery, he met us in the waiting room and explained the recovery plan and what to expect. Shindell again checked on our son the following day to see how he was recovering. Every time, he explained everything fully so that we could understand what was going on.\n\nWe still see Dr. Shindell regularly to check on the progress of our son's bone graft. Although he seemed very stoic when we first met him, we also have seen how much he personally cares about each patient... and their parents.\n\nWe are absolutely grateful for Dr. Shindell!", "business_id": "epXH-NxReRzcJzpMyBEXNw", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-02-25", "type": "review"}

Perhaps it was something any pediatric specialist could have done, but the gentle and knowledgeable way in which it was accomplished was exceptional. \n\nThe office support staff is great, from the front desk to the x-ray technician. All very friendly and supportive. Dr. Shindell himself has a very calm and reassuring demeanor, which is just what we needed.

I decided on 5, and I will tell you why!\n\nFOOD gets the 5 stars- a rating for \"Old School Mexican Food\"; not for Elements or Kai.  In the genre of budget-priced Mexican food, it's a 5 star.\n\nThe food is SOOOO good!  It is that old school Sonoran style type of Mexican I remember from when I was a kid in Phoenix (60's-70's).  It is simple, generous servings but not monstrously so.  \n\nThe staff are long-term, get to know you types.  They work hard, and are very easy going when it comes to just about anything; even when you pay, they'll take your group's bill and allow you to pay one at a time, so no dealing with a split check a the table.  This is good for groups going out for lunch from work.\n\nIn the early 90's there original location was on 16th St- TINY... and they were renown for their burros.  They are still a mainstay today and if you aren't certain of what to order, get a burrito.  Their tortas are also exceptional.  I am partial to the basic combo plates.\n\nThe drawbacks:  and yes, there are some-  \n\nTIME.  I would go more often, but the amount of time you will wait can be very inconsistent.  Even when we arrive early (for lunch), there can be delays.  I shouldn't be gone for more than an hour for lunch, and have been 90 minutes twice when out at Juan's.  For me, this is a problem.  And even though i really like the wait-staff, i think that there are some organizational issues that cause the hold-ups.  Maybe understaffed?  I don't know for sure, but it's worth mentioning.\n\nCHIPS.  I like the chips and hot sauce, but don't LOVE them.  They are the old school variety, which are OK but I do like me some really hot out of the fryer chips served with cold chunky salsa, and that's not what you'll get here.  You will get the smooth red hot sauce and usually tepid thicker chips. \n\nIf you  haven't tried Juan's, and you don't have an inflexible schedule, DEFINITELY give them a try.

(At least where I work...)\n\nWhile I can't vouch for the restaurant itself, I do know the food to-go is awesome. I got the carne asada burro which was $4.79 and worth every penny. Beware of food belly: it's all meat! (Well there's onion, cilantro, and guac in there too, but it's mostly meat) The tortillas aren't quite as good as Carolina's, but they are a little denser/stretchier which is good when you're not up for messing around with a messy burrito. The meat was flavorful, and lean! I hate when there's a bunch of fatty goobery pieces in the carne, and Juan's didn't disappoint. I only ate a little over half of the burrito because it was so big...and I needed room for chips and salsa.\n\nNow the do or die: chips and salsa. I fancy myself a salsa connoisseur, and this was 8/10 only because I prefer a chunkier salsa. The flavor was really great though: smoky and spicy and obviously fresh. The chips are house made and perfect--firm but not hard, and crispy delicious. Hence my conversion to Nachos next week. \n\nNormally, I reserve nachos for sports bars and happy hours, but next Juansday I am totally ordering the machaca nachos. My work husband got them and they look/sound delicious.\n\nGive it a try. You know you ...
