He had fond memories of this place so late one night we set out for Beto's.  He was surprised to find that the place is now housed in a fairly new upgraded building giving off a somewhat upscale vibe.\n\nEven though it was after midnight, they were still serving take out... so hooray for their late night hours.  We orders some \"cuts\" (Pittsburgh's way of saying \"slices\") to go and ate them in our car in the parking lot.\n\nFor the former Pittsburgher, the place may have changed, but the pizza tasted just as he remembered.  Tangy sauce, cuts in rectangular shape, crust was bready but had some crunch on its underside.  The unique thing about this pizza is they take it out of the oven and then add the cheese... and alot of it.... so its not altogether melted when you eat it.  My friend loved it.\n\nTo me it was unique but just okay.  I like a thinner crust, cheese melted and cooked all the way through, crust less bready.\n\nYou may like it.

But to no avail, it was an illusion. It seems as if they cook there pizza and then top it with the toppings....? Strange..? Well, yes it is strange to this jedi, but Beto's knows what they are doing! \n\nThe crust is in word, umm, ahhh, AWESOME! Nice and crunhcy, light and flaky, and also has the moistness of a biscuit.......if that makes any sense. Sauce is also good, nothing crazy, just good ole pizza sauce. The sauce reminds me of Kiddyland Pizza at Kennywood, or it has the feel of Della Sala's Pizza (Verona). \n\nI went with my favorite pizza combination, Mushroom & Onion. I was excited because they use canned mushrooms and loaded them on. Call me weird, but i love canned mushroom on my pizza. Another delight, the onion was sliced into rings. Onions HAVE to be sliced into rings for pie....plain an simple. Diced? One pissed of jedi! Like I said before, raw toppings, so it was a shock to bite into raw cheese and onion. The raw onion went well with the whole Beto's thing they have going on. I was pleased.\n\nI will be back to Beto's and it is a great change of pace. I do not know if it is blaspheme to order the pie \"double cooked\", but I would like to try that.

Located on Beverly in Mt. Lebo, it's super-busy during meal times.  \n\nFood can be hit and miss.  Best to stick with the pizza, which is pretty good, and the soup and salads, which are quite good.  Place also has a solid beer selection, which is reasonably priced.  That said, we've found that it's a total mistake to order anything else off the menu -- except at breakfast, which again is pretty good.  (Their omlets are huge!)  For example, we once ordered a spinach-artichoke app.  Sounded delicious.  Um... it was creamed spinach (probably of frozen origin) with some canned artichokes in it.  Disappointing to say the least.\n\nAlso be aware that they close the kitchen ... when they feel like it.  I didn't know that until we were drinking a few beers there a while back and they made a kitchen last call.  My sister asked the bartender when the kitchen closes -- he said, when we feel like it.\n\nOne thing is for sure, though, if you go with what they do best (Pizza and beer), you won't be disapointed.

But at 8pm I was ready to eat anything and Bado's was on the way home. So I parked and walked I'm and the place was packed. Good sign. So a seat at the bar opened and the Pens were playing. So I ordered a bottled IPA and read over the menu. I needed to power carb after a long day of sitting in a hospital waiting room. The bartender who doubled as a pizza chef told me the white pizza was exceptional, so I took his advice and ordered a medium, figuring I could have it for lunch the next day. What arrived was this wonderfully thick, cheesy, reeking of garlic in a good way, just what I needed, comfort food that instantly made the days worries seem distant. The first bite was heaven, chewy center, crisp bottom, olive oil coating my mouth, ooey, gooey italian cheeses, saltiness from the black olives I ordered as a topping. This was pizza! Two slices and I was full, I drank my beer and paid the bill, and walked out with lunch and dinner for the next day.

I think if their upped their quality of ingredients it would push it to five stars, but their clientele base seems fairly small, so hipsters, get in on the bottom floor of this fad. \n\nDefinitely order delivery from them because the mezzanine level place is hard to get to and you have to get buzzed into the building.", "business_id": "nBl_NeArpL08MpoghDiA_A", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-06-04", "type": "review"}

We were planning to get take out and have a picnic at the concert, but alas, rainy weather struck (surprise, surprise!), so we ended up having dinner here before heading over to Heinz Hall, where the concert had been relocated due to the weather.\n\nCM and I ordered a medium Moroccan spiced chicken and plum pizza to share ($14.99), and our friends each ordered pide, with one ordering the Ephesus, and the other ordering the soujcuk ($9.49 each).  Both CM and I enjoyed the complex medley of flavors and textures comprising the chicken/plum pizza, which was complemented by a cup of seemingly homemade ranch sauce served with the pizza.  The plums were dried, and weren't overwhelmingly sweet or fleshy, and lent the perfect hint of sweetness to the savoriness of the chicken and the spicy kick of the sauce.  The sliced nuts (almonds, I believe) were also a nice touch, and the size was more than enough for the two of us.  My only major criticism was that the myriad of toppings made the pizza a bit unwieldy to eat, and often fell off as we ate it.\n\nThe pide were rather long and thin in profile, and were each topped by a pepper.  I didn't try the Ephesus version, which is topped with ground beef, due to my aversion for that meat.  I did try a slice of the sojcuk pide, however, which is topped with cheese and Turkish pepperoni.  While the pepperoni were different in flavor than traditional pepperoni, the overall effect was reminiscent of eating traditional pizza that just happens to be long and thin.  I didn't try the greens that came with the pide, but they seemed similar to those used to top the chicken/plum pizza, and our friends weren't fans of the sauce, which they found rather oily and flavorless.  However, I did try the tzatziki sauce served with their pide, which was thick and had a great cucumber-yogurt zip.\n\nOne important thing to note is that Ephesus seems to have relocated since several of the previous reviews were written--they are now located at street level on 4th Ave., and the space is actually rather nicely decorated for a pizza parlor.  Having said that, judging from the amount of phone calls and runs of the delivery guy, the majority of their business still seems to consist of delivery.

They also had a Vegetarian hoagie on the menu, so in the haste of a hunger-driven decision I called and ordered a veggie hoagie($7.75 - hold the mushrooms), mayo, and an order of fries($4).\n\nWe arrived at the shop about 10 minutes later and waited another 5 watching jeopardy while our food finished up. The store was clean, the dough was being rolled out by hand, and there were people eating inside. The pizza was square-sliced and looked good, but we didn't have any.\n\nWhen we got home with the food, we started into the fries. They give you a lot - you get a small pizza box filled with them - an extra buck or so nets you cheese melted all over it. The fries were very tasty, and had a remnant taste of chicken wing to them. They were also very salty, which I prefer.\n\nThe hoagie was a different beast entirely. A few dots of grease on the outside of the paper could not prepare me for the damp towel of sandwich paper I would see when I opened it up.  The hoagie consisted mainly of grilled peppers and onions as advertised, but having asked for extra mayo(As Sarah S suggested) may have been a bit much in this case. They really gave me what I asked for, this thing may as well have been a mayo sandwich with lettuce and onions.\n\nThe taste was awesome and even with all of the grease the bread stayed crispy, but not crunchy as many roof-of-your-mouth-scraping sandwiches around town are.My real qualm is about the texture though, and I'm sure it applies most to the veggie hoagie, with no cheese or meat to provide resistance, it all just sinks and squishes around. They need something firm, something that provides some resistance - take Big Jim's, where roasted broccoli and carrots give a nice firm crunch to make you feel like you're eating solid food.\n\nSo while I give the taste an easy four stars, I have to deduct a point for the texture of the sandwich, hoping that maybe they will try to add a firmer vegetable to it to make eating it not feel quite as much like sausage gravy on a roll. However I'm sure if you go for a meat-laden variety it will be totally worth your time.", "business_id": "PTS4MxQel-xzj5qWxVn3LQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-08-09", "type": "review"}

This was not a mistake. \n\nApproaching the place from the front stacks of pizza boxes on the right hand side glare through the window if there is any sort of light outside. I guess no one wants to steal those. Walking in I nearly miss the black and white portrait of the Corleone family on the wall. Nice touch. We're in Sicily now. \n\nThe cashier let me stand far away as i decided. Somehow I like the space and waded there for moments longer than I needed. But, in fairness, after being a vegetarian all through college and only having steak once in my life, last month, I was making a difficult decision. \n\nI ordered two half hoagies. One steak and one Italian. My friend Dave was supposed to be on this excursion with me, but he had to help his dad so I decided to get him a sandwich. Like I do with books (which Dave and I both love more than people) I don't decide which sandwich to eat or whether I will give Dave one or not. I do not get cheese on one of them because I am rather lactose intolerant. I do not get cheese on the steak hoagie, in order to trick my subconscious into thinking that I had a choice but simultaneously letting it know that I will be eating the steak. It all worked out.\n\nI bit into this sandwich while reading about food. I'm not sure if the moment could have been better, reviewing some Amiri Baraka essay on African American food culture and biting into my warm, soft hoagie. So well blended together, each ingredient holding each other like lost lovers, I began to fear that somehow I had not been heard and there was cheese on the hoagie. I opened it up.\n\nNothing lay between those Italian bread slices but steak, Italian dressing, onions that looked seasoned, peppered, lettuce, and tomato. I think, \"Is that crack or cracked pepper?\" I'm not a believer in such great things unearned. \n\nI look at the spotless red floor and then up to the open kitchen with the chef wearing a Steelers t-shirt with a \"7\" on it for Big Ben. He got sauce on it and almost looked as if he would faint. I wonder about that.\n\nThe cashier and the sandwich girl are the only ones who wear uniforms: a company t-shirt. I wish that I could wear short black shorts to work with a half apron that made it seem as if I had no bottoms at all. \n\nThe chef slings a pizza out of the oven into an Italy colored box. I grip mushrooms, tomato, and warm lettuce from my paper wrapping, to finish. I've never found a better way to be a part of this city than to find a sandwich shop unique to the neighborhood. Perfect. My stomach still agrees with itself: no more steak.", "business_id": "PTS4MxQel-xzj5qWxVn3LQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-07-11", "type": "review"}

We tried the cheese sticks, garlic bread, deep fried ravioles, and had the large pizza with sausage.... Okay the cheese they use in the pizza is really odd tasting to me it's just got this bitter taste maybe Parmesan mixed in? They made mozzarella sticks same way I couldn't finish them.... The ravioles were fine... Garlic bread... Ughm nothing special... Bland bread with butter and cheese.... And for the pizza... The cheese and sauce were just weird the sauce was very sweet almost like what a previous comment stated \"sugary\" and I guess with the bland bread and it all kind of evens out in a way...

My date and I were told there was a 30-40 minute wait and after almost leaving, we made our way through the restaurant to wait in the wine bar.  Hmm a bit misleading.  It was quite humid and crowded.  I am patient and was in great company but...there were some negative moments.  On our way up the wine bar stairs,  I held the door as a hostess directed a party down the teeny stairs to their table, only to be squished by patrons coming up who thought I was there for their convenience and more than happy to hold the door as they pushed past.  Also some of  the patrons at the bar seemed displeased that new faces were coming in and did not seem to want to budge to make any room for ordering beverages.  Anyway, I do not drink so I had literally stand still (think sardines) until some people were seated elsewhere.  I was then able to find comfy chairs to sit in.  There were some appetizers sweating and/or floating in olive oil on the windowsill which I found a little gross.  A not-so-polite employee cleaned up the space and extra drink glasses around me.  Giving me a dissatified \"thanks a lot\" look that made me want to justify myself as not being the slob that left the glasses and plates!  But my date returned and relaxed with a glass of wine as we chatted.  We were seated surprisingly promptly.  We were lead to a small two top near the door.  While not ideal, it was do-able.  I had a salad and the pizza with te arugula while my date hads the fpur cheese.  I loved my pizza and besides one of the cheeses my date also enjoyed his pie.  The pizza crust was slightly sweet and baked just right. (Like I said, I really enjoyed mine and the food is why I gave 3 not 2 stars.)  Thankfully my date was able to help me finish my pizza and there was some to take home.  Our waiter was nice and somewhat attentive.

Discussing amongst ourselves while scouring other tables for evidence of portion size we eventually settled on one appetizer, two pastas, and a pizza...we then began the agonizing process of deciding which option sounded best.  \n\nBaked in house the first basket was had only three options while the second arrived with a fourth.  With each bread a great example of its particular type the baskets featured a smoky Rustic Italian, buttery Semolina Vienna, amply sour sesame seed crusted Sourdough, and a buttery moist Foccacia.  While I rather wish the pairing would have been a nice olive oil as opposed to butter neither were really necessary with all the sauce that required mopping up.\n\nBeginning the meal as the sounds of eager diners bounced around the wonderfully decorated brick and tile interior was a delightful Arancini with creamy arborio rice providing a slightly toothsome contrast to velvety fried Mozzarella.   An ample portion for a mere $6 the dish was only enhanced by resting the crispy balls of cheese in a pool of house-made marinara.  Remember the comment about the bread - a whole basket was used to dredge the plate clean of the aromatic and slightly acidic sauce.\n\nSelecting two of the eighteen pastas the pair was delivered simultaneously and looking back I still cannot decide which was better.  Beginning first with the Paglia E Fieno, a spinach and egg tagliatelle with peas, prosciutto di parma, parmigiano-reggiano, and cream I was stunned by the bouncy texture of the pasta to tooth yet its undeniable melt-in-the-mouth texture upon mastication...al dente done just right.  Complimenting the pasta were sweet and snappy peas, a smooth and salty prosciutto, and a pungent parmigiano-reggiano that added texture and pungency.  All balanced by a somewhat sweet cream sauce the entire dish was well thought out, well balanced, and divine.\n\nNot to be outdone, Gnocchi Di Ricotta featuring Ricotta Gnocchi, Butter, Sage, and Parmigiana-Reggiano was a dish that would have the three of us fighting for the last dumpling.  Simply prepared, as one expects from a rustic dish like gnocchi, the dumplings were undoubtedly the star of the dish-literally melting puddles of potato and ricotta cheese that provided little resistance to tooth, yet enough body to support and absorb the subtly sweet and aromatic sauce.  Topped with a quick grating of cheese and cracked black pepper the gnocchi was one of the best I've ever tasted-a skilled hand, perfect cooking conditions, and largely un-fussed-with.\n\nEnjoying all the previous efforts so much the \"star\" of the afternoon was nearly an afterthought-and one heck of an afterthought given that it is where the restaurant made its name.  Opting for the Provola with Smoked Mozzarella di bufala, Cherry Tomatoes, Fresh Basil, Parmigiano-Reggiano, Baby Arugula, and Extra Virgin Olive Oil we watched as the dough emerged from the temperature controlled room, was rolled by hand, topped and was placed inside the stone oven for a mere 90 seconds.  Emerging bubbly and charred the pizza was topped with a heap of fresh arugala, drizzled with olive oil and a quick shredding of Parmigiano-Reggiano before being plated and brought to the table.  Squeaky and smoky the cheese was a perfect foil for the cornmeal accented and yeasty dough.  Crisp and toasted around the circumference of the 13 inche pie and sopping wet at the center each ingredient was pronounced in flavor with the super sweet tomatoes and basil forming the foundation and the bite of the parmigiano and bitterness of the Arugula providing a nice compliment of flavor.\n\nArriving quickly and in ample portion the house made desserts were both presented simply and unadorned.  Beginning first with the Tiramisu-a rather standard example with buttery lady fingers, smooth mascarpone, high quality cocoa, ribbons of chocolate, and a hefty shot of rum-it was good, but like many pre-prepared versions it was largely unbalanced with the rum soaking the bottom layer and cream dominating the top.  Significantly more impressive was the Cannoli, a crisp and slightly cinnamon accented shell housing a lightly lemon tinged ricotta cream.  One end dipped in crushed pistachio, the other in chocolate chips, and sitting atop a bed of hand whipped cream-light, refreshing, and authentic.\n\nGreat service, everything expertly prepared, and prices that fit the quality of the ingredients I was very happy with every aspect of our meal.  Honestly, when the pizza, one of the best I've ever had was the \"worst\" savory...that is saying something.  Clearly I need to start paying attention to that Verace Pizza Napoletana Association list when I travel.", "business_id": "6-rJjW6ITl5o_FliiNgZRA", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-07-01", "type": "review"}

I was so happy we chose to eat dinner there, especially when we got a great, people-watching table right next to the window. Very relaxing before our 5-hour drive home the next day.\n\nIl Pizzaiolo has a great, rustic atmosphere. Dark wood, tan walls, delicious pizza smells. And a full bar. Very important.\n\nThe service was eh. It took the waitress at least 10 minutes to greet us and take our drink order, another 5 to get drinks and tepid water for the table. (Ew, chill the water. I know you're going for a Euro atmosphere but you're not in Europe. Chill the damn water.) The appetizer got there after another 5 and then the pizza took forever. I don't know how since the menu claims they're cooked in 30 seconds in the wood burning oven. But no matter. On to the review.\n\nT got a beer and I got a mimosa. They were out of the peach juice that usually goes in a mimosa so it was made with blood orange juice instead. Delicious. \n\nFor our appetizer we ordered a sort of potato stick with cheese mixed in. Forget the exact name and they don't seem to have a website where I can check. They were ... okay. A bit bland truth be told but the Parmesan cheese sprinkled on top helped a bit. There was no salt and pepper on the table and our waitress was a bit absent so we sucked it up and ate the bland potato stick things.\n\nHowever, the pizza improved a somewhat mediocre appetizer. We got the Diavolo with spicy salami and chili flakes. Amazing. The crust was thin and chewy and not too black on the bottom. The cheese was salty and creamy and the salami was spicy and really tasty. Much better than pepperoni in my opinion.\n\nI suppose it's a good spot if you're in the mood for Italian. I'm sure there are better in the Pittsburgh area.", "business_id": "6-rJjW6ITl5o_FliiNgZRA", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-06-03", "type": "review"}

My mother and aunt live in Mt. Lebanon and my husband and I visit a couple times a year, and on a night we had to ourselves decided to have a late dinner here.As it was a Saturday, the place was packed and had a couple groups waiting. Because we were only needing a table for 2 we were able to get seated promptly. \nThis was one of the evenings when the daytime temperature was over 100 degrees and was still very hot after sundown; the restaurant was boiling hot. They have a wood burning pizza oven so I am sure that they cannot keep the place as cool as some eateries (most are too cold for me). Service was very fast and very attentive, and very nice. We had cold water on our table in under 30 seconds of seating, were given just the right amount of time to look at the menu, and received our appetizer within 10 minutes of seating. Our food arrived about 20 minutes after ordering, with enough time to not be rushed through our appetizer. \nI cannot remember what our appetizer's name was, but it was a dough pocket filled with mozzarella and had yellow and red tomatoes to the side. It was well done, but I felt like it was simply too huge a portion to really be an appetizer/salad. Giant mound of mozzarella + only 4 thin slices of tomatoes seemed off somehow; still tasted great though.\nMy husband had Linguini alle Vongole- clams in a white sauce. He absolutely loved the meal, and the dish arrived with more clams than I would ever have expected. \nI ordered Chicken Piccata, as I was wanting something lighter than pasta or anything packed with cheese. The lemon was so refreshing and the sauce done very nicely- not too buttery, with more of the lemon and wine coming through- definitely nice after such a seething hot day.\nThe quality of the food shines through, even from the menu. I appreciate a place that used San Marzano tomatoes, real buffalo mozzarella, huge sprigs of basil, , etc. The prices were a little steep but I didn't leave the place lamenting over the cost.\nThe last comment I will leave is that the place is ungodly loud when full. Now, I am not a local, and I have always noticed that in general Pittsburgh restaurants are much louder than what I am used to (San Fransisco CA, Louisville KY, Washington DC, Baltimore MD and Philly). I usually chalk it up to a Pittsburgh thing, but this place was wayyyy louder for whatever reason. There was one group of maybe 10 (noise wasn't so much from them anyway) people but otherwise all small groups. I say this merely b/c a couple people have said it's a great date spot. I would agree, but NOT FOR A FIRST or any getting-to-know-you dates- you won't hear half of what your date said and who wants to have to scream so everyone around you knows it's a first date? :) \nOverall, a great restaurant and I cannot wait to come back try their DOC pizza- it looked superb.", "business_id": "6-rJjW6ITl5o_FliiNgZRA", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-07-08", "type": "review"}

Don't get me wrong, the food has always been good, but not fantastic and a little over priced. Yes, I've had the pizza. Yes, I've had several pasta dishes. None of which has changed my mind. I don't understand why there is always such a long wait for a table here. \nMy latest trip was on a warm Saturday night. I met a few friends on the patio for dinner. I arrived a llittle late and with baby in tow. I specifically asked for them to order me a glass of wine so it was on the table when I arrived. Unfortunately, for my dining companion, I miscalculated the size of baby + diaper bag and knocked over the glass of wine spilling it all over his yellow shirt. It almost looked like a tie dyed effect. The wait staff rushed to our side bringing him a glass of seltzer water and me a new glass of wine (I later found out at no charge). Seltzer water had nothing on the masterpeice I created. The shirt was officially retired. Once we got settled, I ordered the insalata misticanza. Despite the fancy name, it's a rather typical salad with balsamic, greens and some typical veggies. Nothing extravagant here, especially for 11$. For my entree, I had the fusilli ala ragu di bracioli. The pasta was cooked well. The beef was a little dry. The sauce was ok. I decided to not take home my left overs. Overall, my bill ended up being 40$. For a salad, pasta dish and 1 glass of wine. This same meal would average at least 5 dollars less at an equivalent restaurant. The best thing about the meal was the service. The server was knowledgeable, attentive and friendly. Overall, I will most likely go back to Il Piz because it is such a staple in the South Hills area, though it would not be by my choice.", "business_id": "6-rJjW6ITl5o_FliiNgZRA", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-07-08", "type": "review"}

There were several items that were really good, but yet there were a few areas that left a bad feeling in my mouth.\n\nThe arancini - the Sicilian and Neapolitan Fried Rice Balls - were top notch and I would get over and over.  There were four little fried balls of risotto that were so good.  We also had the insalata misticanza - which they graciously split in half for us.  It was your typical salad.\n\nWe then had the cavatelli con rapini - with sausage and rapini - as well as the bucatini all'amatriciana - with Guanciale and onions.  Both dishes had unique flavors.  However, the cavatelli came out luke warm and I had to send it back to be warmed.  It also had too much sausage - it more than dominated the pasta.\n\nSo - that's the food review.  As for the staff - it left a little to be desired.  First off - we had a reservation and I had requested an outside seating on the phone.  In essence, they told me they don't take reservations for the outside - it's first come first serve when you get there.  So - when we got to the restaurant I asked and they told me that it would be a good 30 minute wait.  So we sat inside.  Then after we ordered our drinks, I went to look at the patio b/c I had heard it was very nice...and there were several open tables.  I didn't understand where our 30 minute wait was.  Then when I get back to my table, I see the waitress seating a couple outside...who came in after us.  If it's first come first serve for the patio - how come it was a 30 minute wait for us, but not for the other couple?  I just felt that they might have catered to people who were their 'regulars'.

I too once loved this restaurant, but we have had far too many terrible experiences to ever return.\n\nOur first bad experience was a year and a half ago.  My parents were visiting from out of town and my husband and I decided to take them here.  We were told the wait would be 30-45 minutes.  We were lucky enough to find two seats at the wine bar so we could share a bottle of vino and take turns sitting.  An hour went by... then an hour and fifteen minutes... We began to notice that some parties coming into the bar area after us were seated before us.  Then, we were finally told our table was ready and to follow them... only for one of the hostesses to stop the waitress who was seating us.  She told the waitress that the table was for someone else.  We then watched as they sat a party who had been waiting for less than 20 minutes.  I can only presume these people were friends with one of the hostesses.  At this point, over 90 minutes had passed and we were understandably upset.  I complained to the manager, a middle aged woman who showed absolutely no concern for the situation they had caused.  We should have left, but instead we ordered another bottle and waited another 20 minutes for our table in the extremely noisy front dining room.\n\nMy husband absolutely refused to go to this location after that incident, so our next incident was not until this past week.  We made reservations for a Friday night and I specifically requested a quiet table in the wine room if one was available.  I noted that we would be willing to switch our reservation to a half hour before or after if that gave us a better chance, knowing they can't completely control such things.  When we arrived, the hostesses appeared to be the same teenage or 20-something girls who worked here a year ago.  I don't know if they were or if this restaurant simply has a steady stream of insolent young girls from which to draw.  The girls looked at each other, continued to giggle and continue whatever conversations they had already been having, and eventually pulled out a couple menus for us.  They led us to a table for 8 which already had 4 people.  They then gestured towards the table and asked \"is this okay?\".  We responded that no, we had made a reservation and there were at least two open tables in the front dining room, so we expected to be sat there, outside or at the wine bar (we checked - there was a table open in the same room as the wine bar and one outside).  The girl then informed us that it would be another 20-30 minutes if we didn't want to sit at someone else's table.  I have never known Il Pizzaiolo to be communal seating so this was completely unacceptable.  We left and gave our business to another restaurant on the same street, where we had excellent food and excellent service.\n \nThis portion is regarding the other location downtown:\n\nOur third bad experience was the Market Square location this past Sunday.  We have had one less than favorable experience there before (they told my husband and I it would be a 2 hour wait for a table for 8, then told someone else from our party it would be 15 minutes only 10 minutes later... ), but we were willing to justify it and hoped it was an anomaly.  Sadly, they now seem to hire from the same pool as the Mt. Lebanon location.  We were told it would be a 20-25 minute wait for an outdoor table as 3 different 4 tops were finishing their dinner.  They said they would call us so we took a walk and returned 15 minutes later.  We waited at a public table in Market Square and WATCHED as the host and hostess cleared and then sat the 2 of the 4 tops.  When we went in to ask what was going on, we saw that all three 4 tops were actually resat.  We reminded them we were waiting and asked them when they would have our table ready.  We were told it would be another 20 minutes.  Goodbye!  Ciao, Il Pizzaiolo!  Never again.  We were able to be seated at Sienna immediately.  \n\nOwnership should be ashamed.  I don't know whether it is nepotism in the host positions or a complete lack of respect for their clientele.  I should add that on every occasion, a remark was made to at least a hostess, if not management, and no one offered even a sincere apology.  It is sad that people are willing to put up with this level of service.  There are plenty of other fine establishments in Pittsburgh, particularly Italian ones.  I have a whole list of Italian restaurants that have as good or better food, that would never treat their patrons like this.", "business_id": "6-rJjW6ITl5o_FliiNgZRA", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-08-15", "type": "review"}

The patio is nice and provides for a lot of seating, however it hasn't been updated in several years.  I recently made a trip to BRGR the new gourmet burger joint several blocks away and their outdoor seating is quite hard to beat.  \n\nThe food at Doc's is what you would expect to find at a greasy/beer/bar.  Cheese fries, burgers, some salads, mediocre pasta, etc.  Although some of their dishes in the past have been much better than I anticipated, the food isn't something I leave the place remembering.  \n\nThere is smoking allowed on the patio upstairs so if you don't mind smoke then no worries.  However, if you don't like to breathe in smoke while you're eating, pray that there is no one smoking in your section when you go.  There are space heaters upstairs in the winter for when it starts to get cold before the snow comes.  It is nice to be outside and still be warm but the food and beer pretty much stay the same year round.\n\nI wouldn't say no if someone asked me to join them for a drink at Doc's but I would probably suggest eating somewhere else first.

The newer location in the Hearst Building and on South Blvd try to reach the heights the old one had, but they fall just a bit short in my opinion. For a long time this was my favorite pizza place in Charlotte (along with Wolfman), because they had that true NY style of thin slices with heaps of greasy meat piled on top. I will second the opinion given below that the single slices heated up are definitely not the way to go, if you are going to come here you have to get a fresh pie for the true experience.\n\nThe non-pizza items are also pretty good, especially the wings. If you like hot stuff as much as I do try them Inferno style, just have plenty of water or beer to cool your mouth down! The garlic knots are also dangerously addictive, and if you're not careful you can easily fill up quickly before your pizza is even ready.

My always amazing Yelp Mobile App zeroed me in on these folks.  Thanks Charlotte Yelpers!\n\nSo I walked in the door and scanned the modern d\u00e9cor.  I don't mind modern d\u00e9cor when it matches the food but to me, pizza and beer is a rustic kind of meal.  I know it's a personal preference but I would have liked a different atmosphere.\n\nNext came the beer list and the one word I would use to describe it is decent.  There was something for everybody here but nothing really exotic to excite the true beer aficionado. You can expect almost thirty drafts.   I was mildly annoyed that their list does not include ABVs.  They should add this sooner rather than later as it's become standard at good craft beer joints.\n\nNext I perused the pizza menu and choose the BRONX BOMBER for $10.95. It included spicy Italian sausage, prosciutto, gorgonzola cheese, tomato sauce and fresh oregano.  I ordered it because the carnivore in me was roaring and this is as close as I could get to a meat lovers pie.  They should consider adding one to the menu.  It was out quickly and I have to say I was impressed.  The amount of toppings was appropriate.  It was not greasy and that's a very good thing. For me, one thing that's true of a great pizza is that you can taste both the crust and the toppings.  That was true here and the delicious taste of a little char on the crust came through.  The size of the pie is worth noting.  It will definitely fill up one person but is probably a little small for two. Overall this was a very good pie.\n\nThroughout my meal customer service was just fine.

This is a tasty sauce I've had many times so I knew what I was given.  The wings were brought to me pipping hot and the ranch was thick and cold.  There's nothing I despise more than a warm, runny ranch.  The wings were cooked with the perfect amount of crispiness but were not overcooked by any means.  \n\nMy only complaint with the wings is that they are not charred.  I'm sorry to say, but if you're not throwing your wings over an open-flame and charring them at this point then you're simply behind the times.  Plenty of establishments such as Fanz, Hickory Tavern and Mac's throw their wings over a grill before serving them.\n\nIf your looking for a chill and relaxing WEEKDAY evening to watch your favorite team, Picassos is the perfect place.  On football Sundays, Picasso's University is nothing short of perfectly organized mayhem.  Fans often arrived at 11am-11:30am even though their game doesn't kick-off until 1pm!  Furthermore, you are very likely to see a skirmish or a squabble as Sunday day turns into Sunday evening and patrons start to get that liquor courage. \n\nBefore I close, I want to make an important distinction in my rating.  I give Picasso's Sports Cafe as a whole  5-stars.  The staff is always friendly, prompt and efficient.  However, I am not giving their Cajun Garlic Wings 5-stars!  Though their wings are good, there are not \"5-star\" worthy.  On a scale of 1-10, I'd give them a 7.\n\nAt its soul, this is a classic, American sports-bar.

And I have got to say, they have some pretty good ones.\n\nThus far, I have tried three different kinds.  The Caribbean Creepers were like eating a jerk chicken wing, but they were just a little too different for me.  The medium garlic were pretty good, but the best I have had, by far, are the Cajun Garlic.  They are the perfect level of spiciness, not too spicy but plenty of flavor.  \n\nI have tried some of their other things here too.  Their bacon cheese fries were kind of 'meh' when I had them; they were pretty skimpy on the cheese and bacon.  Their pizza was pretty decent.  We had the Masterpiece, had a lot of good toppings.  Still, I am not a huge fan of New York-style pizza (I originate from the Midwest, and am quite partial toward Chicago-style or deep dish), but it was pretty standard for pizza.\n\nService has been ok here.  I have never had bad service, so that is definitely a plus.  They do have a decent amount of seating too, and it's not overly crowded in there.\n\nI plan to try a few more things on their menu, and that definitely includes other styles of their wings.  Their wings are good, but I must continue on my quest for amazing wings here in Charlotte.\n\nOverall, I would give Picasso's about 3.5 stars.", "business_id": "3xdV-7di_YD3MVqs3Pa7-g", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-08-08", "type": "review"}

I come here to play poker and spend time with my poker buddies a couple of nights a week. BUT, for those who are sports fans and like to eat/drink while watching a game,  you should be very happy with this place.\nPicasso's is very popular with the college-aged sports fan crowd -- particularly since it's located just up the road from UNC-Charlotte.\nThe food is standard sports-bar fare. Wings, pizzas, sandwiches, wraps, fries and other appetizers. These are of fairly average quality -- though I have heard some of my friends comment that they particularly like the fajitas. There are no desserts.\nThere is a good selection of beer & mixed drinks -- nothing fancy, but adequate and fairly priced for your average sports fan.\nThe staff is very friendly and professional and are able to accomodate large crowds with ease -- given a little advanced notice. As I mentioned, my poker league plays here twice a week (on Mondays and Wednesdays, 2 games each day at 7pm and 9:30pm FREE) and we usually have crowd of 20-30. Often, other college groups (clubs, fraternities, sports teams, etc.) share the same space.  It's a spacious establishments with lots of TVs and even a huge (I'd say 10 ft or bigger) projection TV for the big games.\n\nIn addition to the games on the TVs and twice-weekly free poker, there is also an electronic darts board and a \"shuffleboard\" game. The covered outdoor seating area is convenient if you happen to be a smoker or have smokers in your party. \n\nSO . . . being a foodie, I'd give Picasso's 3 stars. Since this place is a SPORTS BAR, however, and judging it on its' own merits, I'll give Picasso's 4 stars!", "business_id": "3xdV-7di_YD3MVqs3Pa7-g", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-07-21", "type": "review"}

And I learned to spend what little money I made wisely. Fiscal conservatism rocks! Well, part of that meant finding a cheap and nearby place to wash my chonies and other clothes. Finding good eats was coincidental. Every Saturday morning, I'd set my VCR to record X-Men Generation, loaded up my Sportage with a week's worth of dirty clothes and headed to the laundromat at 48th and VB. Initially, I'd stroll on over to the Circle K during the wash cycle, get something that was certain to introduce me to my toilet after the spin cycle and that was about normal. One day, I bravely headed north and stumbled upon Phx House of Pizza and Subs. Like a mirage in the desert, it called out to me with intriguing smells of delishness. It was lust at first sight. The 2 slices of pizza would keep me filled until afternoon and were amazingly tasty. Truly, I found happiness.\n\nAnd so it was, a Saturday ritual whilest my clothing was being laundered I succumbed to the garlicky goodness that is PHOPS. Sadly, I found love and moved to the other side of town and it seemed I was watching an endearing lover grow smaller in my rear view mirror as I drove on. :sigh: I did know what good, economically-friendly dining was. I shall never forget you.\n\nOh, and honey, if you're reading this: You're way better than pizza.

Most any place does it this way. \n\nSo why even review this place? two words\n\nBROASTER CHICKEN!!!!!!\n\nWhere have you been all my life? It's basically pressure cooker chicken, so it has a fried texture to it, but it's not as greasy as fried chicken. I wouldn't call it healthy, but it certainly could be healthier than fried chicken\n\nIt was kinda pricey, I remember paying 8 bucks for a 4 piece (2 white 2 dark) with XL potato wedges, plus two other sides. I had fries, they were parmesan and herb sprinkled, and good. Macaroni salad was fine, nothing special, but I always hope for mac and cheese. The wedges were also excellent, and as I said, three of them were almost an entire half potato.\n\nBut the chicken was the star. The outer coating was crispy, not as puffy as KFC or other fried chicken, and somewhat reminiscent of home cooked chicken. The inside had more of that roasted taste with very little if any grease. It's like getting rotisserie chicken with a fried coating.\n\nJust writing this review has me considering going to get some broasted tastiness later today.\n\nOh ya, service, etc. It was fine. Not slow, but not speedy. Again, no reason for praise or punishment for anything Streets of New York does. But that chicken?

When we got our new wings they looked a million times better. They were golden and smothered in some of the same weird sauce. These were still partially frozen. I didn't bother sending them back for fear they'd spit in my raviolis. My boyfriend ordered a Philly I ordered raviolis.  His sandwich was sub par. He said it was just some beef, melted processed provolone cheese on a dry sesame bun. Bummer, then my raviolis were big and round, the filling was nearly flavorless, obviously frozen and processed swimming in some sauce that was as tick as ketchup with a taste to match. We waited a long time between refilled and when they asked how my food was I told them it was gross. She left it at the table and brought the check about ten minutes later.

We just moved to Anthem from Dallas Texas and were looking for a great pizza/Italian place to eat at, but this is NOT the place.  We entered and there were only two other  dinners in the place, one was a family of 5 and the other was a family of 3, we were a party of 2.  We were seated and told that are waitress would be with us in just a minute.  Well, that minute turned out to be about 10 minutes.  Having had time to read the menu about a dozen times while we waited, when our waitress finally did show up we were ready to order but she ask us if we wanted to put in a drink order?  Really???  So we did put in an order for 2 glasses of wine and asked for water as well.  About 10 minutes later we received our wine (very small pour indeed) and no water?  As we were waiting for our food order (I'll get to that train wreck in just a minute) we noticed that the other two occupied tables were having issues with their orders and all we could hear was the waitress consistently apologizing, we also watch as the other tables food was delivered, ONE freaken plate at a time, first one child got some breadsticks, then about 4 minutes later the other child got a salad, then about 10 minutes later the father got his order, then they apparently asked for water and it was delivered ONE glass at a time by the same server (not waiter???) then we experienced the same absolutely mind numbing food delivery, with the exception that I had ordered the 10\" pizza (which was pretty good after a 20 minuet wait) but my wife had ordered a chicken pasta dish, which we never received.  The waitress brought the pizza and two plates and started to walk away and I ask where my wife's meal was and she looked stunned, walked away and came back and told us that she had turned in the order but the \"kitchen\" must have misread it, but she would re-enter the order, well that was about 2 glasses of wine each and one very small pizza later, which had already taken about 55 minutes....duh!  So we simply told her to cancel the order and we would just pay for the pizza and wine and be happy to leave.  It was one of the worst dinning experiences we have ever had.  The \"manager\" was there, tending a small bar, at which NO ONE was sitting, but he did manage to go and clean the back door glass while all of his customers were waiting for service.  It was a totally dysfunctional, totally unacceptable experience and I doubt that we will ever return, unless my wife bets me that it couldn't possible be that bad on a second visit and I might be willing to accept that \"sure bet\"!!!  Unfortunately in Anthem the dinning options are very limited and even the Legend Sports Bar (well, sort of a sports bar) is failing as it changes management???  I ordered a pizza there last  week and was told after a 15 minute wait that they had no cheese for the pizza because the whole kitchen/management team just weren't ordering any food?

Was I disappointed.   \n\nMy $8 tuna sandwich, straight off the menu, was supposed to come with fancy olives and red onion and came with neither - just tuna and copious arugula on spongy flatbread.  I was surprised, considering they make the same three or four items over and over, and disappointed, since I was craving a richly texured, crunchy construction. The tuna tasted fine - I think they put some lemon in it and maybe there's an olive or two pulverized beyond recognition into the paste - but it's no better than when I open a can of albacore at home and add a little horseradish or curry or what have you and slap some water chestnuts on top - or when I go to Subway and pile black olives, tomato and cheese on a larger, cheaper sub ( on admittedly inferior bread).  The bread here was round and chewy, spongy, but not crunchy at all - reminded me of the bread at Schlotsky's - the whole thing was just kind of flat.  \n\nMy son had the salami and provelone and said it was \"good\". Not great or amazing. Just \"good\".  We spent $21.62 on two smallish sandwiches and creme sodas to go. No sides. Meh.  \n\nThe girls in front were friendly and efficient and the food came out incredibly fast - so quick I wondered if (dare I say it?) my sandwich was PRE-MADE. Mine tasted like it could have been. I dont know if the bread was intended to be warm or not, but after a 10 min drive home, it wasnt.  They use nice heavy paper to wrap up the food and a cute paper \"to-go\" bag with a handle. \n\nThe waiting area is small and there's one (1) metal folding chair for people to sit on. I guess the idea is to walk around and peruse the tiny $16 bottles of imported capers instead, and since it's 110 outside I really wouldnt expect more air conditioned seating from the guy who makes folks wait hours for pizza across town instead of simply taking reservations. \n\nSomeday, I'll come back to try the mozzarella and tomato cuz I still remember how good his cheese tasted a decade earlier, and Chris B's track record has certainly earned him a second chance, but I wont be burning my gas or wallet on return trips this hot summer, based on today's experience.", "business_id": "-AAig9FG0s8gYE4f8GfowQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-07-22", "type": "review"}

The space is kind of barren.  I'm used to Italian sandwich shops being light, airy, welcoming and warm places.  Pane Bianco was kind of like a sandwich factory.  They have a very limited grocery section which just seemed to me to be for show.  \"Let's throw in this grocery section to make it look like an Italian market!\"    \n\nI don't think the price they charge is justifiable.  I don't know...where I'm from there are plenty of sandwich shops where you can get just as good, if not better, of a sandwich (from a much larger selection) AND a drink AND a bag of chips (or salad if you want) for the same price.  At least you do get those caramels...", "business_id": "-AAig9FG0s8gYE4f8GfowQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-07-25", "type": "review"}

Oh, so close!\n\nI've stopped in to Pane Bianco a couple of times and have enoyed the non-commercial sandwiches here.  And by \"non-commercial\", I mean the type my Italian Mom used to make when I was a kid.\n\nOn my first visit I had what amounted to the caprese sandwich (mozzarella, tomato & basil.)  PB is known for its mozzarella, so I wasn't surprised by its goodness, but I swear the sprig of basil must have been just picked that day...so flavorful and fragant.  It really made the sammy!  The price was about $8.50.  If I would have stopped there, PB would have have five stars.\n\nOn my second visit I had the Market Sandwich (mortadella, peach relish, pecorino and greens).  The mortadella seemed a bit flavorless.  It was sliced thin (which I love) but could have used an extra layer.  It just seemed as though the pecorino (perhaps due to the saltiness) and sweetness of the peach relish (a slight departure from the website description) overpowered the mortadella.  In fact, the sandwich was a bit on the dry side and could have used a bit more of the relish for moisture, especially in light of the fact this type of bread tends to be on the dry side.  The relish really shouldn't be any sweeter as, it too, runs the risk of overpowering the flavor of the meat.  If Chris Bianco can find a way to add greater volume to the relish without adding any additional sweetness, I'd give PB five stars!  Now, if only something can be done about the $11 price tag, this could be an \"A+\" sandwich!\n\nFeel like getting experiemntal at home?  Be sure to grab a freshly baked loaf before you leave.  A bargain at just $3.\n\nMy only real disappointment is that PB isn't open on Sunday.  Hopefully, they'll expand once Lux moves from the space they occupy next door and Pane Bianco will have reason to expand both their space AND their hours of operation.  Who knows...maybe even offer some vino???\n\nI still crave Pane Bianco and can't wait to go back,  I'm already salivating over the Soppressata with Aged Provolone & Roasted Peppers.  Hmm, maybe it'll be just like Mom used to make.", "business_id": "-AAig9FG0s8gYE4f8GfowQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-08-21", "type": "review"}

Having made my pilgrimage to the eponymous pizzeria during my first trip to Phoenix, Pane had been on my radar since the day I moved to town but given the lunch-only hours and my office location in North Scottsdale I knew a weekend would be best and as luck would have it a new website (http://www.pizzeriabianco.com/) and seven day 11a-3p schedule had been rolled out just the week prior.\n\nArriving at the surprisingly large space (especially when compared to Matt's and JoBot from earlier that day - and compared to Pizzeria Bianco as well) shortly after 11:30 and allocating parking in the free lot juxtaposing the Light Rail I debated for a moment whether dine-in or to-go was best and opting for the former made my way into the restaurant where two couples already sat.  Greeted by one of two servers it was suggested I could take \"any seat I wanted\" and opting for a bench in the center of the room where a menu awaited I sat down to browse the menu as well as the daily specials listed on the chalkboard - almost all sounding appealing, but a bit different than the Saturday special listed on the website.  With a small list of beverages available I was asked soon if I was ready to order or if I needed a few minutes I deferred and requested a glass of water that would never reach even half-empty despite me drinking from it consistently and the restaurant soon filling to capacity.\n\nHaving debated the specials but eventually undeterred from the reason I'd come in the first place I soon placed my order for a sandwich and an 'appetizer' which I was told would be 'just a few minutes' and as while I waited I checked out the small market at the Take Away section featuring the famous focaccia, cans of tomatoes, dried pasta, and apparel before returning to my seat where my items would arrive shortly - the first a Manchego and Tomato Sauce Focaccia del Giorno featuring Bianco's delectable wood fired focaccia in all of its spongy glory topped with sweet, ripe tomatoes and an ample layer of briny Manchego; at $4.50 probably the most expensive \"Grandma Slice\" I've ever had yet at the same time also probably the best...or at least on par with that at DiFara in Brooklyn for best of its genre.\n\nMoving next to the original target of my desire, a sandwich of Bianco's House Made Mozzarella, Tomatoes, and Basil on Wood Fired Focaccia my first thought was \"wow - that is a lot of cheese\" while my second, after a bite, was \"wow - that is a lot of flavor.\"  Perhaps as pure of a sandwich as you can find and the result of exquisite ingredients on top quality bread there is really nothing 'special' about the composition of this sandwich aside from the fact that it simply works - a largely unmanipulated masterpiece only improved by a touch of sea salt and cracked black pepper.\n\nLargely unaware on entering that Pane serves dessert it was with much delight that I realized soon after sitting down that three options were available that day and while the flourless chocolate cake I saw emerge from the kitchen to the table next to me looked quite nice there was simply no way I was passing up the Organic Vanilla Bean Rice Pudding with Candied Pecans - another simplistic stunner with creamy Arborio rice imbued with a rich vanilla custard flicked with whole vanilla beans and a few pecans for crunch.  Delicate and smooth, flavorful without being overly sweet, and *almost* thick enough to stand a spoon up straight it was not quite the best rice pudding I've ever had - but a top five contender without a shadow of a doubt - a reason in and of itself to return to Pane Bianco...though to be fair, if I returned it would take pretty spectacular daily specials to prevent me from ordering the exact same trio of items once again.  With Chris and his team now two for two it is only a matter of time before I make my way to Italian Restaurant... and honestly, that time is likely measured in hours and days as opposed to weeks and months.", "business_id": "-AAig9FG0s8gYE4f8GfowQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-08-13", "type": "review"}

The bread was fresh and full of flavor, the mozzarella was creamy, and the basil added a nice crunch.

Why not. \n\nWe walked in and sat at the bar after we made sure we could bring in our coffees. I really liked the old style farm house decor of the restaurant. So simple, yet done so classy. It welcomed you inside. \n\nWe both were not super hungry but decided to share a sandwich. I don't remember the name but it was the only one with Italian meat. \n\nWow, simple, but amazing. We loved it, the bread was just the perfect amount if chewy put soft and the sandwich had flavored thanks to the I taipan meat and onions. Also the sandwich was super big so the 2 if us easily shared and were satisfied. \n\nService from the bartender was very good and polite. I'd love to come back and try more. I'm giving it 5 stars because I know Bianco put a lot of his heart and soul in his businesses and they have never I disappointed me.

Seriously...this is one of the few spots on Central not open late!\n\nI made it at 7-ish, not realizing they closed at 8. I didn't want to be THAT GUY, but staff was definitely still eager to serve a first timer. We kicked off supper with bread and olive oil. Theirs was the best olive oil I've enjoyed on this side of the Atlantic. Delicious, even if the thick, fresh bread was a tad sweet for my taste. \n\nIn mere minutes, I was delightfully presented with the \"Sonny Boy\", a simple pizza with soppressata + kalamata, or in painfully layman terms, pepperoni and olive. I usually hate olives, even kalamata, but these were good. There are limits to any desirable quality in a pizza. We don't want it to be too salty, and surprisingly this was not. We don't want the sauce, crust, or any singular element to overpower another aspect, and for the most part, it was all well balanced. I was able to appreciate it all. \n\nMy only criticism is the cheese itself, which would be refreshing in a caprese or on a white pie, but was just not BOLD enough. It was too milky. Too fatty, even. After doing the most extensive research that has ever gone into a review, perhaps this is from using a more local product rather than the rare Mozarella Di Bufala variety that's hard to get your hands on, but has an unforgettable taste. \n\nIt was so, so close to perfection. Or perhaps I've got some leveling up to do before reaching the status of a true cheese aficionado. Feel free to give your input. \n\nOverall, this is very VERY good pizza, decent bread, and great service. As they closed, they even gave us a complementary loaf to-go.  I was honestly hoping to just grab a sandwich, which I will return to do on the rare occasion I'm not on Central for the nightlife. I wish I could give a 4.5, but since they were nice, a full 5 stars it is. That's what being nice gets ya. =) \n\nPS--I still can't believe my Yelp friends bragged about waiting in line for 3 hours to get a Bianco pie back in the day.

The service was 100 percent completely horrendous. I will break it down nice and easy for ya:\n\nThe boy and I took our friend Brittany S. for a birthday lunch.\nBrittany and I were seated, while the boy finished a phone call outside.\nBrittany and I placed our orders. I, a slice of pizza from their lunch menu, and she a house salad with chicken. We informed the server the boy would be in and would also be ordering something.\nThe boy finally arrived and we placed his order - a Bollo Pasta from the lunch menu, and a toasted ravioli appetizer. \nBrittany and I's food arrived first. Mine was fine, or rather, correct (the pizza tasted horrible), while hers was missing the chicken. She called the server over and asked if she could have a side of chicken and he looked at her like it was the most ridiculous request he's ever had. He looked at her strangely for a minute or so, until finally he said \"oh, did you want chicken on that?\". DUH. \nAt this point, Brittany had gotten up to make a phone call, so Mike and I requested a birthday pizzookie for her. You know, they would embarrass her with the whole singing cheesiness bit. We specifically explain this to the server and he nods his head and asks what kind of pizzookie we want. Great! Or so we thought.\nSo after that Brittany and I slowly eat our food, thinking the boy's would be out at any moment. 10 minutes.. 15 minutes... 20 minutes... 25 minutes passed by and still no food. The joint wasn't busy so we were a little confused. Our server must have noticed our confusion because he came over and asked us if we wanted to order some more food. REALLY?! \"We already ordered his food - 25 minutes ago\". \"OOOOH, ok, I'll put that in for you\" was his dumb-ass remark. OK, thanks, bud! \n15 minutes later the rest of the food arrives, and our server says \"oh, now that wasn't too bad!\" - yeah, except we waited a total of 40 minutes for a goddamned bowl of angel hair with marinara. \n\nSo Mike ate his food and we chatted, when the server came over, gave me a look, and pointed his fingers at me, and said \"oooh, gotcha\". I'm assuming he forgot about our pizzookie as well, and quickly remembered upon the \"I'm going to kill you\" look I gave him. \n\n10 minutes later we see him coming with the pizzookie. Here we are, expecting some big embarrassing birthday song (because they DO do birthdays at Oregano's), and all he does is set the cookie down on the table, looks at Brittany, and says \"so, it's your birthday?\", then awkwardly looks at Mike and I like we are supposed to know what to do. WHAT?! NO BIRTHDAY SONG?! He smiles awkwardly and walks away. \n\nBy this point Mike and I are so furious that we are ready to stand up and scream in this guys face. We eat the cookie and he brings us our bill. Hell no did he charge us for EVERY single little thing he forgot. He also didn't give us the lunch special prices (we ordered before the cut off) Come on, we weren't expecting you to comp our entire bill, but seriously. Don't charge us the $2.50 for the chicken you forgot, or the two dishes you forgot, or the birthday cookie that you totally screwed up and still had the nerve to ring in as \"birthday\" and charge us for it, or overcharge us for the lunch plates. SERIOUSLY?! \n\nWe threw down and left. Pissed. Pissed that our server forgot every single thing we ordered. Pissed that we spent almost two hours on lunch because of it. And pissed that he didn't even once acknowledge our frustrations. I won't be coming back here again. At least not during lunch when this idiot's around.", "business_id": "ML1RJdeZ7bbfMrHvJ7m99A", "stars": 2, "date": "2008-08-24", "type": "review"}

The area around 10th St and Camelback experiences a lot of smash and grab theft and even assault, so be aware of your surroundings. It's a good neighborhood, but buzzed, well-fed people are easy marks.\n\nThe negative review is because I think you can do a LOT better while supporting a locally owned place instead of a chain.

Anyway, my last visit here was rather hectic; my mother was in town so we planned a dinner here for her with most of our extended family (a 20 person group). I understood this might be difficult considering the size of the place, so I called a couple of days prior to see if they could in fact accommodate us. Sure, they said. Because they don't take reservations over the phone, I would need to go to the restaurant the day of to put our name on the list. They assured me \"no worries, we'll take care of you and have everything ready.\"\n\nSo I head to the restaurant around 1 pm to put our names on the list for 6 pm. We get there at 550 and are told it's going to be a 45 - 60 minute wait. Wait, seriously? So then why did I make a trip several hours prior because that's what you told me would ensure we're seated on time? \n\nSo our party of twenty is waiting outside in the hot parking lot (because of course there wasn't enough room in the waiting area) for nearly an hour. They were very accommodating with water and drinks while we waited, which was nice. The only thing that was really irritating about the wait was the whole time thing: we were constantly being told, oh, it'll be just a minute, or oh, they're bussing it now. When all we needed to do was step is side and see that nothing was actually happening, so we felt like we were being jerked around so we wouldn't leave. What's with restaurants not telling it like it is with wait times? So annoying, especially in the heat. \n\nAnyway, so we're finally seated in the only area that can hold us, and we're totally cramped. But we're a close family, so lucky for us! Our server was really great with filling our orders and accommodating our needs. Like I said, he totally made up for our outrageous wait with good service...and what was at first a hectic, stressful evening, turned out to be an entertaining one. \n\nOf course I'll come back to Oregano's time and time again..there is that something that constantly draws us back.", "business_id": "ML1RJdeZ7bbfMrHvJ7m99A", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-07-15", "type": "review"}

Print it out and take it with you (yes, you can laminate it if you want).\n\nINSIDER'S GUIDE TO OREGANO'S:\n\n1) Make plans for dinner (lunch is an impossibility unless you have two-hour lunch breaks ... you lucky dog).\n\n2) Get some fun friends together (Oregano's is great in groups of about six - keeps all seating options open)\n\n3) Grab a deck of cards or two (you'll see)\n\n4) Get the whole group to show up at 6 (they won't put your name on the list unless you're all there)\n\n5) Hang out and talk or play cards with your friends for forty minutes or so (now you see why they need to be FUN friends)\n\n6) About 20 minutes before your scheduled seating, order two things: DEEP DISH PIZZA and GUACA-TONY.  These both take a while but the waitstaff will put the order in and have it cook while you wait.\n\n7) After you get seated and get drinks, put in any SALAD OR ENTREE orders.  As you do, the guaca-tony will show up right on cue.  Your friends will admire both your foresight and your appetizer selection.  It's an amazing Italian guacamole with a thin-crust pizza for dipping.  Unforgettable, as Old Blue-eyes would say.\n\n8) The guaca-tony will be mostly gone in a hurry, so have the obligatory \"no, you take the last slice\" discussion, and reluctantly gobble down the rest of it (way to take one for the team, champ).  Just as the pan is cleared, here comes the pizza and other entrees.  Perfect!  But don't let that waiter escape - order your PIZZOOKIES now! (ideally chocolate chip, but I won't judge if you go for peanut butter or white chocolate macadamia nut).\n\n9) Devour the pizza.  Their deep dish is so very good.  It's extremely filling, so it's best to calculate about 1-2 slices per person.  Don't worry, it's tasty reheated.\n\n10) Just when you decide you can't eat another bite, the pizzookies show up ... and, well, you might as well have a little.  Generous scoops of vanilla ice cream on top of a half-baked cookie in a pizza pan, and drizzed with chocolate syrup.  The best.\n\n11) Grab the check.  Your friends will think you are very generous, but it turns out eating at Oregano's is really affordable in groups, since you split most things.  Without alcohol, it usually works out to about $10 per person, including tax and tip.  Of course, you can just ask everyone for the 10 bucks or, if you're feeling unscrupulous, ask them all for 15 bucks.  For the awesome meal they just had, they'll probably pay it!", "business_id": "ML1RJdeZ7bbfMrHvJ7m99A", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-08-27", "type": "review"}

You can tell the sausage was made in house with great spices and a little bit of heat.

We got there promptly at 11 and got a parking spot and tablemmediately. We ordered calamari as a starter. This was the absolute worst calamari that I ever tasted! It didn't even look like calamari. It was thick strips that tasted very very fishy. I understand that calamari is seafood, but this tasted like bad fish, plus it was way over coated and salty. We sent it back and ordered fried ravioli. When it arrived, it too, was way over salted and tasted stale. We ate a few but didn't send it back. Next came our pizza. We ordered the lunch slices. The portion was a good size, but the pizza was very mediocre and the crust had the same stale flavor as the ravioli. Although the service was good, the food was very bad and I would not recommend Oregano's to anyone.", "business_id": "ML1RJdeZ7bbfMrHvJ7m99A", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-06-14", "type": "review"}

The boom dip was pretty good, and for four people was enough. Probably my favorite dish of the night since I could actually taste chunks of artichoke unlike the usual artichoke dips that taste like I paid 10 bucks for 0.20 cents of straight melted mozzarella. For some reason, the server decided to torture us by serving both the pasta at the same time as the pizza even though we asked her not to. After an arduous hour of waiting where I was ready to part the crowd like Moses and run to Cherry Blossoms instead, the monster came and all I could see was a pile of cheese and oil dripping off the pan. I may be a fatty, but this goes beyond Paula Deen-'buttah'-level. The cousins and I all agreed that we could have gone to pizza hut, had the same delicious pizza, and eaten 5 more boxes in the time we waited.\n\nThen, the little cousins wanted desert and they wanted the pizookie. I wish the waiter had warned us AHEAD of time that it was going to be another '15-esque minutes' but jk it's actually 25 minutes after ordering. By the time it got to our table, we were all too full and tired of being at a restaurant for so long. \n\nFor a restaurant that's so small, you would think the food would come faster, or at least they would train their servers to be more careful about warning customers about the time it takes for certain foods to come out like other restaurants.", "business_id": "ML1RJdeZ7bbfMrHvJ7m99A", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-06-27", "type": "review"}

I mean it, silly.  We ordered a pizza and the waiter immediately asked us if we knew it was at least 45 minutes for a thin crust and an hour for a deep dish?  Huh?  What in the name of God takes that long to assemble a pizza?  I can *almost* understand the long wait on a deep dish simply because of the cooking time, almost.  But 45 minutes for a thin crust (we're talking a crust so thin it's almost like a huge circular Saltine cracker) is friggen ridiculous.  Sorry, Oregano's, but that is just too long.\n\nSo rant about the ridiculous wait time aside, the food here is actually pretty good, and they can make a side of calamari like nobody's business.  It's delicious.  My toddler and I mowed through a serving of calamari and had enough to take home to snack on the next night.  I also had a mojito and it was very good, crisp, refreshing and yummy.  And as far as the pizza goes it was very good, and my husband throughly enjoyed it.  It was just the right amount of cheese and the crust was perfect.  Good pizza, awful wait.   \n\nLike my last sit-down dining experience this waiter also somehow managed to completely ignore the presense of my toddler and I finally had to ask him to get us a cup of water for her.  Rant Alert!  I seriously do NOT understand why wait staff ignore the babies and small children of paying patrons.  Yes, it's true that my two year old won't be tipping you, or placing a food order, or even mentioning her experience on Yelp, but her mommy sure as hell will, so at least acknowledge that when you take drink orders every living, breathing human being at the table probably needs their own beverage and may need to order their own food too. \n\nKnowing the wait on the pizza I got clever and called over our waiter and asked him to put in an order for a pizzokie (sp?) for us, to go.  I explained that I couldn't make my toddler behave much longer and he graciously told me that he didn't mind noisy babies, which was great, except I bet all the patrons around us WOULD mind it if my daughter decided she was done being nice and was ready to start banging the salt shaker on the table while bellowing out 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star' at the stop of her tiny lungs.  ;)  So after some puzzlement at my (apparently odd) request to take dessert to go he finally got it sorted out and we were able to pay and leave with our delicious dessert before the impending meltdown.\n\nSo all in all this was a nice visit, but that wait time on the pizza needs to be shortened.

Or, at least tried to.\n\nThe parking is INSANE. This is no exaggeration. There is really, seriously no place to park. On several occasions we wanted to eat here and didn't because we had no place to leave the car. \n\nI was always very excited to eat here but disappointed once I was there. Everything I ordered was less than awesome. The Pablo Picasso salad was dry, with very little dressing, and way spicier than described in the menu. The Southwestern Shrimp salad is supposed to be on a \"bed of fried noddles.\" Sounds decadently delicious, right? It tasted like cooked and re-dried spaghetti. Literally inedible! The Big 'Ole Vedge sandwich sounds amazing but tastes totally bland, no flavor whatsoever. My husband has given the Italian Wedding soup a few different tries, but finds it is always way too salty. He gives their pasta the general description of \"bland\"; no matter which one he ordered, they all tasted the same. \n\nThe only awesome food here is the pizookie cookie. A decadent, AMAZING dessert that, now that I think about it, I can easily make at home for half the cost and none of the hassle. \n\nOh and the wait. An hour, minimum. No exceptions. You will always wait at Oregano's. My husband and I went so far as to CALL to put our names in, WALK to the restaurant, as parking is impossible, and we STILL had to wait nearly an hour! \n\nI keep wanting to give them another try, I'm not sure why, but my husband is having none of it.", "business_id": "ML1RJdeZ7bbfMrHvJ7m99A", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-08-08", "type": "review"}

I have never had an issue finding parking, and since I do not mind the heat, I have never had to wait to get a seat (ample patio seating - if you do not mind friendly pigeons). The pastas and salads have been consistently tasty. For starters, I recommend a small Simple House Salad - it is plenty to split between two people.\n\nLast night the Wings of Fire (medium) were not up to par. Previous orders of the wings have been outstanding, but last night was quite a disappointment. The sauce seemed different (runnier), the wings were small, and there was a rubbery texture on a few of them. I am hoping that it was just an off night for the quality of the wings and will be trying them one more time. Also, if you are a fan of the taste of calamari and traditional preparation of it, do not order the Bistro Calamari. The fried coating was way too thick and took away from the texture and taste of the calamari. \n\nBack to the positives! The Brussels Sprouts are delicious (note that they take about 20 minutes to cook). Both the Alfredo the Dark and the Big Rig Pasta (with meatballs) are delightful. They have a slight spice to them and the pasta is cooked perfectly (to my standards at least). The bread that accompanies the pastas adds a nice touch to the meal. \n\nIf you have room, I suggest ending your meal with The Original Pizza Cookie - Chocolate Chip! My only complaint is that there is not an option of regular peanut butter flavor. Ask for a refill of your beverage in a to-go cup, it is refreshing for the drive home.\n\nOf course I suggest trying Oregano's! :)", "business_id": "ML1RJdeZ7bbfMrHvJ7m99A", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-06-16", "type": "review"}

I ordered the Monday lunch special 2 slices of Chicago thin crust with one having bacon and pine apple and the other sausage and onion I also added the garden salad and a appetizer of the calamari. My husband orders the Monday lunch special 6 in Chicago deep dish and a Caesar salad and we both had dr pepper to drink . It wasn't so busy when we arrived the host he was amazing very friendly and enthusiastic wish I knew his name but I can say he isn't boring . Our server was Jules she was also friendly and gave good service. Now the food is where they fell short we ordered the calamari way before the meal and our salads arrived before the calamari which my salad was not a garden salad but romaine and two very thinly sliced tomatoes and two pieces of thinly sliced red onion with ranch . When the calamari arrived it was over cooked and rubbery with a fish flavor I have only had calamari two other places and they were really good so I was disappointed in the flavor and rubbery calamari. The pizza arrived and I was told the next time I had to get both slices with the same toppings I looked at my pizza and to my disappointment I received Canadian bacon instead if bacon as I specified as bacon bacon. Then as I was eating my sausage and onion slice I noticed the fork I was using had a huge piece of dried shaved Parmesan cheese on the handle it went from the end of the fork to half way to the prongs of the fork. I lost my appetite after that and I didn't ask for the manager but jukes had him come out he did apologize for it and said he was embarrassed and because of the service I give them 3 stars . I may try them again but not too sure right now and we tipped Jules 15 bucks for being so awesome and she was very apologetic and earned it .", "business_id": "ML1RJdeZ7bbfMrHvJ7m99A", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-08-31", "type": "review"}

When it came time to escape Ohio, initially with a very good friend who wanted to move to Tucson to acclimate us to city life (I was raised in a village of 500+- people, including the rural setting of my parents) and within five years move to Phoenix, just so we didn't suffer culture shock. Remember, I'd only been in Phx for 3 days up to that point in my life, with neither friend nor family binding me to Arizona. However, he decided the week before our departure date that he wasn't ready to move so far away from family. I, however, had turned in my month's notice to both my full-time job as a journalist and part-time job at Wal-Mart (don't judge me! The employee discount was worth it) so had to make a decision: Tucson or Phoenix. It was during the final minutes, literally, that I mapped out my trip to Phoenix. See, my dad's a truck driver and I have some of his ability to navigate through cities and states using this amazing invention called an atlas. Thanks to Grandma O'Neill, I had such a magical device in my possession, and wrote out in a matter of minutes the best route to drive my Kia Sportage and U-haul trailer from Northwest Ohio to Central Arizona, avoiding toll roads and steep inclines. Unfortunately, I had to drive through the panhandle of Texas, where I almost decided I'd had enough and was going to return to Ohio. But, I drove on. And on, and on... \n\nWhat this has to do with Pizza Heaven is simply background information. After 2.5 days of driving and sleeping in a truck stop one night, I was ready to settle in and have a filling meal. A pizza, actually. And something that would inaugurate my coming to a new home: Mexican Pizza. Refried bean and cheese and green onions...it's a shame I couldn't find it on their menu after returning a year later. But, PH managed to offer specialty pizzas that filled that void (almost :( ) and has been a stand-by for several events at a friend's house. [My friend's house is outside their delivery range and we gladly pay the extra fee, which says a lot.] \n\nAlthough I've only eaten inside the restaurant twice, and must agree that service tended to be on the slower side, this did allow our groups to mingle more and enjoy the pizza and wine at our leisure. \n\nThanks for the memories, Pizza Heaven. You've remained solid in my heart since the day I drove into town and stayed at the only hotel on the only street I could recall in this wonderful City.

Way too dark, fake plants, an impractical bar talking valuable real estate, orange walls -- you get the drift. I prefer to think of it as neighborhood Italian kitsch, but on a crabby day I might be less kind. The food is good, a must in any vegan's rotation. Both the pizza and subs are amazing. They use a superior vegan cheese, and I am not a fan of other fake cheese, especially on Italian cheese-centric dishes, but this stuff is amazing. My complaint is that your only side dish option for the sub is french fries - carbs with carbs; a small salad would be appreciated. Also ask for the additional veggies on the subs, they come with them but don't ask don't get. Prices are reasonable, pay at the register after the meal. Service is attentive, youthful, and helpful.

This was one of the worst experiences I've ever had at a restaurant. I ordered the veggieball parmigiana , now here's the tricky part apparently. All I asked for was actual cheese and not vegan cheese. I wanted the  whole sandwich to be meat free and just have non vegan cheese. Simple enough right? Wrong, I thought the server's head was about to pop off. He simply could not grasp this simple order, the sandwich comes with a side so I ordered the salad. So time goes on and he brings out my order, ya not so much. He brings out veggieballs I will give him that, but it's an appetizer not the sandwich I ordered. So he takes it back and brings out my salad. Then he proceeds to bring out my actual sandwich with a side of fries. I didn't ask for fries I asked for the salad side. So now I'll be charged for a salad and fries. I'm with my boyfriend, who is not a vegetarian, and the server says that his order will be out in thirty seconds. TEN minutes go by and my food is getting cold because I would like to eat at the same time as my boyfriend. The server finally comes over and says it's going to be a little while because they made two veggie sandwiches. Why did they do this?! My boyfriend ordered a sausage sandwich! So now that's two food orders they have to throw out because the server is incompetent. Enough was enough. I gulped down my wine and asked for the check. I paid for my salad and my wine because that's all I ate. Nothing was comped and I spent ten bucks on a wilted salad and a glass of wine. Grossly inadequate and unacceptable.

The menu looked great with a wide variety of choices to please me and my picky kids. River suggested the hot agave BBQ wings and everyone loved them. I'm a vegetarian and they made my mouth water. And that says a lot.\n\nBut.the.pizza. Oh my. The pizza. I haven't had pizza like that in a long time.  Plentiful toppings. Quality ingredients.  It was cooked perfectly.  Seriously.  The best pizza I've had since Waterfront Pizza in Port Townsend, Washington. \n\nThe cheesecake made the whole trip worth it.\n\nThe service was great.

The staff is VERY FRIENDLY and I do not have one bad thing to say about this place's service or their regular pies. With that said.....\n\nWhen I moved from Michigan it was hard for me to find good pizza down here. Papa John's is terrible, Little Cesar's is also terrible - THEN I FOUND NYPD! \nI've only tried their regular pizzas and, this past weekend, tried their Sicilian pizza (which is essentially deep dish). BEWARE: the Sicilian pizzas are HUGE! If you've got two or three people to feed - the half size is PLENTY! ALSO BEWARE: the Sicilian is mostly dough, which soaks up all of the sauce and depending on what kind of toppings you have, ends up being very watery because of veggies. I ordered Da Works Sicilian and was VERY disappointed - which surprised me because I LOVE THEIR REGULAR STYLE PIZZAS THEY ARE TO DIE FOR! Anyway, the Sicilian is NOT A DEEP DISH - it's extra dough, under cooked and they didn't even have the courtesy to warn me HOW DOG-GONE BIG IT IS!\n\nOtherwise, their regular pizzas are amazing! Totally worth $20 per pie. My favorite is between Da Works and Big Kahuna - they know how to do a Hawaiian pizza. \n\nI recommend this place to anyone I run into looking for a good pizza joint!", "business_id": "TqHTtjPANCBKGsjGBjDoQQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-08-26", "type": "review"}

The vast majority of the waiters looked like firefighters (okay, that's probably the uniform, probably supposed to look like the police, plus the fact that Arizona people look slightly different from the Miamians I'm used to), and they were super friendly and on top of things despite the increasing number of customers.

Anything Vincent's does I love. Whether it's the 5 star dining in the front, the market bistro in the back or the Saturday morning marketplace outside. They really know how to frenchafy AZ. \n\nI've been to Vincent's Market Bistro several times and most recently, last night for a friend's birthday. The Market Bistro is the more intimate, kitchen style dining at Vincent's and actually my favorite way to dine there. I walked in and immediately felt like I'd entered a cozy and intimate restaurant in the heart of Paris. The food was cooking, the guests at the tables were laughing and having a great time and the waitstaff knew almost everyone by name. The authentic french decor helped the cause as well. \n\nWhen I hear the name Vincent's, I immediately think \"oh yikes, here comes a pricey night,\" but the best part about it is that the market bistro keeps the evening at an incredibly reasonable price without losing the quality of food. Are you ready for this? I got the pre fix meal that began with a delectable crab cake on a salad with avocado garnish, followed by the lobster chimichanga and topped off with the chocolate tart which was really a chocolate souffle. How much? $20. Only $20 my friends! It was delicious. With each savory bite, I became a little happier. The wine by the glass was only $5-$6 dollars and at the end, the waiter brought us a couple additional desserts to make sure we tried them all. Just what my waistline needed...but I had a bite, and I think the lemon tart is my favorite. \n\nVincent's Market Bistro has definitely been added to the rotation of favorite places to dine with character. And when I walked outside and the heat hit my face, I didn't even mind because I had such a great time at Vincent's.", "business_id": "oc0Wl6ktfMLb5VZ2Uz6M2A", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-08-15", "type": "review"}

The first time we went was this past March. The food was so good. I had the lobster bisque for a starter and coq au vin for my main. My partner had the same starter and beef bourgogne for her main. We both had profiteroles for dessert. Yummy!! Everything was spot on. Our only complaint last March was that it was so hot in the restaurant, I almost had to leave. We gave them a pass because we thought it was kind of between seasons so we thought maybe they just weren't ready to turn the air on yet but really, it was way too hot!\n\nSo, we decided to give it another try. We ordered the tart flamb\u00e9 and e goat cheese nachos for starters. They were both out of this world, so good. For mains, I again ordered coq au vin and my partner ordered mussels and frites. The coq au vin was a little dry this time around but we were there at the end of the evening, so... Not really a good excuse. I was totally looking forward to the profiteroles but instead, we didn't get the chance to order them. They brought us out a brownie with ice cream. It was good but def not the profiteroles, those are amazing, maybe they ran out.\n\nHere's the kicker, it was beastly hot again, even the servers were sweating like crazy. They seemingly had the air on but not high enough. It was miserable, so while the food was great and def worth repeated visits, I can't take the heat so I'll sadly have to stay out of their kitchen. Please Vincents, get the air working, so I can come back. Food was a little hit or miss but mostly hits. The apps were def worth a repeat visit. I'm def torn between a 3 and a 4 but then food is really a 4.", "business_id": "oc0Wl6ktfMLb5VZ2Uz6M2A", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-08-05", "type": "review"}

Slow service, overpriced, terrible wait staff...... When really people should be realizing this is not an American restaurant. This is a French bistro that happens to be in America. European style dining is extremely different than the American mentality of sit down, order your food, eat it and then leave. And if you want a larger menu, go to Denny's. No, no, no, my dear friend. Dining in Europe is an experience and one that is used to build relationships around the dinner table and to make memories. The service is slow for a reason. It will give you time to talk to each other. Enjoy the croissants. Look at the menu without having to tell the wait staff you need more time. This is closer to real customer service. When I come here, I know I need more time and I plan for it.\n\nThe food is exquisite. Perfect sized portions and perfect taste every time. I did not realize that I actually like butternut squash soup until I came here. Having brunch here is great also.\n\nEach meal is finished off with more complimentary food.

I ordered an asparagus quiche that was golden brown on top.   The eggs were done perfectly and I believe there were some sundried tomatoes in it.

But in the case of the vast Phoenix sprawl with its inorganic population growth, (basically it's three major cities shoved into one) you've got an ever evolving diaspora of generational clusters with it's own microcosm of habitual norms...\n\nThe easiest way to observe the human condition is in it's eating habits; we had the pleasure of staying in the Scottsdale area this time, where an intimate little outpost of a Bistro bustles like a hive, hidden away from it's older, larger sibling, Vincent's on Camelback.\n\n\nClick below to read more...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you're on Camelback Rd, you likely to see Vincent's on Camelback first facing the street.  It's an older, established restaurant in Scottsdale which has slightly faded from the limelight, with a loyal following of astute and mature clientele who enjoy French Cuisine.  \n\nVeering right into the driveway, you're bound to think that you would be entering into the main building (there's really no defined indication on navigating this place) but Vincent's Market Bistro is actually a separate venue all together with it's own quaint casual identity.  \n\nActually, it's a tricky venue, the awning and front foliage is the only indication of it's presence and with a side entrance, it's hard to see inside to confirm that it's open... But once inside, you see a whole different world...\n\nIt's by definition, a quintessential Bistro from Provence; Venetian plastered walls drenched in Sunflower Gold, color ridden tablecloths with Wooden chairs and mirrored ceiling with stencils and faux wood beams; this restaurant is the Disneyland of Bistro hodge podge...but I like it a lot!\n\nWhat really got me at hello was the plate of home baked Croissants with Strawberry Jam delivered to our table; not entirely Bistro protocol, but at that point, who cared?  I mean, is there any wrong occasion for buttery Croissants?? It was devoured immediately, only to be refilled instantaneously, like a buttery Croissant Genie popped and gave us three wishes!!!\n\nWhat was true to it essence was the menu: I found old favorites like Coq au Vin and Country Quiche.  And the price point was definitely not French!\n\nThe Coq au Vin was too irresistible to pass up, and when it came to our table, it delivered as promised; a wonderfully rich Bourgogne sauce covered Chicken leg on top of an equally decadent mound of Mashed Potatoes.  With portions that would satisfy the French diet, the rich dish sated our American belly...  And looking at the other tables, it seemed that it did equally well around the room... \n\nAnd what would be a price fix course at Vincent's without our knowledge, a complimentary dessert arrived.  It was really cute actually, the whole experience-kinda felt transported into the surreal Hybrid of French American cuisine...\n\nAll in all, Vincent's is a great place for Lunch where you can escape the brutal Phoenix sun and stay, cool and relaxed in the French countryside for the afternoon.  \n\nRatings (Out of FIve Stars)\nFood:                  2.75\nAmbience:          3\nService:              2.5", "business_id": "oc0Wl6ktfMLb5VZ2Uz6M2A", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-08-31", "type": "review"}

The price even included ice cream, which went well with the cake I brought. Go for the extra token deal (100 for $20).

Each one was literally the size of my face.

We went on a Friday night so there was about a 20 minute wait, which wasn't too bad.  There wasn't very much seating and the waiting area got a little crowded.  The Margherita Pizza was very good.  The crust was buttery and delicious.  Even though the food was good, our service experience was not so great.  My boyfriend got one of the specialty pizzas and asked for it to come with onions instead of mushrooms.  Little did we know that this was considered \"building your own pizza\" and as a result we were charged more.  When the bill came and we asked about it, the server's response was it's written on the menu.  This would have been a great thing to mention while we were ordering especially since we told her it was our first visit.  We also ordered a kid's meal and were charged an extra fifty cents for apple juice instead of soda, which again, was not disclosed.  The manager did agree to remove the fifty cent charge but at that point, our experience was ruined.

There can be long delivery times but, thats because, ITS SO GOOD EVERYONE WANTS IT! Im telling you amazing. A lot cheaper than spinatos and a lot more (If you're in the area and can't pick) Delivery is cheap too so we don't even have to leave! We came in for lunch one day and the cashier who was a lady (Amber? Amanda?) Can't remember but, was SO Nice!", "business_id": "kxDGexkbP30fBvxVI0CzFQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-06-03", "type": "review"}

This pizza had good cheese...that pizza had good pizza crust....but what makes a pizza memorable? I still don't know the answer, but one example of a pizza that stands out is Spinato's. \n\nI discovered Spinato's cheesy goodness years ago. My sister asked me to pick up a pizza from this place called Spinato's on the way to her house, but actually...it wasn't even technically on the way to her house. Having never heard of Spinato's, I figured it was just going to be another average joe pizza experience. Then she told me what she ordered: sausage and pepperoni. Sausage? Really? But she swore by it which was random for her to swear by sausage so I went with it, thinking either she's gone off the rocker or this pizza might be something different. I had to smell the pizza for a 10 minute drive on the way to her house. It took everything in me not to pull over on the side of the road and gobble a slice then and there, but for me it's almost as much about the experience eating the food as the food itself, so I wanted to cherish the moment. So to make a long story short, I got home, took one bite of the pizza, tasted this sweet and salty sausage on fresh dough with the cheesy of all cheeses and I knew why my sister made me drive out of my way to pick it up. \n\nNow, I live by about 10 pizza places, but I would actually drive the 20 minutes to Spinato's for this pizza. It's hard to explain, but it's something about the combination of ingredients and the authentic pizza parlor feel when you bite into a slice. It's just one of those pizzas you have to try in your life. So, if you are ever in the area or up for a drive, my suggestion is giving Spinato's a try.

We get pizza for Friday dinner often and I was looking for something better and closer to home.  This location is a few blocks off of my normal route, so I put in an online order for two pizzas.  Having had fast food places miss online orders in the past, I gave the shop a call to confirm that the order was received and that it would be ready on-time.  \nWe had other plans for later in the evening so timing was critical.\nAt the scheduled time I arrived at Spinato's expecting to go in, pick-up two pizzas and leave.  \nNo such luck.  One of the 'clerks' in the take-out area started pushing buttons and making odd faces at the register.  Then he called the other clerk over and the both start mashing buttons and making faces at two registers.  Then the short one says, \"I'm sorry, I don't have an order for you, I can make it up in about 10 minutes?\"  Knowing that they normally need 40 minutes to get their pizzas ready, I was looking at undercooked pizza or no pizza.  I opted for the second choice and left.  \n\nKFC for dinner.\n\nA half an hour after I was home and finishing the chicken, someone from Spinato's calls and says \"We have your pizza waiting\".  I told the young lady that the call was not appreciated and that I was in the store at the scheduled time and they had no order for me.  \n\nThen to add insult to injury, 3 hours after that, I get a text telling me that my order was confirmed.\n\nNot done . . .\n\nMy daughter really wanted to try the pizza and thought that the mistake was a one- time thing and we should still try the pizza.\n\nOK, we'll get pizza for Saturday.

We arrived around 6:30pm on a Saturday evening. The place was packed, and we were told there would be a 10 minute wait for the patio or 20 minutes for indoor. While I wasn't thrilled with sitting outside in Phoenix in the summer heat, there isn't a lot of space in the lobby to wait without being in somebody's way, so we opted for the patio just to have a place to go. Luckily they have a shade screen to protect from the afternoon glare and the misters were on full blast. Overall the place had a nice ambiance and it was not uncomfortable. The service was prompt and friendly. As for the food, we started with a caesar salad and the meatball trio. The salad was pretty typical but still worth it. Skip the meatballs; the sauce on them was exactly the same texture and taste as everyone's favorite eponymous canned pasta product we all grew up with.  Great when you are eight, not so much as a grown-ass adult. Skip it.  For the pizza, we did half Nicole's Old Favorite (red onion, salami, artichoke heart) and half Super Six which is basically a combo. Both were very good. The sauce is definitely sweeter than average, but we have since been able to try another location in Tempe and the sauce there was far less sweet, so be aware there is some variation apparently between sites. For dessert I had the apple pie/crisp type thing that was really good. My wife and daughter tried the tiramisu which they enjoyed.

He agreed but said it is company policy set by the owner and that he is not allowed to override the policy.  This is bad policy.  I ended up ordering the pizza, had to dig out the ham, and then it got thrown away.  Such a waste.  The pizza was tasty. I would suggest to the owner to have some flexibility on common sense policy.  The manager suggested the possible reason for the policy is the kitchen chef is too busy to deal with these requests.  I would suggest that it only takes a split second to see the order \"no ham\" and would not slow the process down.  Not to mention then food would not be wasted.

She'd been talking about the wings at this place for a whole week since she first tried them so we decided to go so I could check it out too.  The building doesn't look like much from the outside and it'd be easy to miss so make sure you're looking closely!\n\nIt's a lot bigger on the inside than it looks from the outside which I was happy about because no one likes a cramped eating space.  We were greeted and seated right away which is always nice and the hostess was friendly.  Our server arrived quickly as well and was also pleasant.  My friend decided on the Honey Hot boneless wings and I went with Medium, we also wanted to try out the pizza so we split a 10\" Pepperoni.\n\nThe food came out pretty fast which was good because we were hungry.  The wings were a good size, perfectly crispy with the right amount of sauce and they had a great flavor.  The pizza was delicious as well.  We polished off the whole thing and I'm justifying it by telling myself it was small so it's okay.  My only tiny little pet peeve (and this is going to make me sound like a diva...) is that the water tasted like unfiltered tap water.  I hate to bring that up but Arizona water does have it's own special \"flavor\" and it just wasn't great.  With the exception of that though I loved everything about this place and I will certainly be back soon.", "business_id": "lf42gtgq_2_jPvjfp_K1nQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-08-19", "type": "review"}

I meet my brother and friends once a week for lunch.  We go to a couple of different places, and about 2 months ago put Red Devil into the rotation.  My 9 year old son has been coming with us since school is out for the summer.\n\nThe first time I brought my son w/ me, he was given a customer appreciation card.  He got a free soda, and then every time we come in there, we get the card punched.  After 10 punches, he gets to pick out a fish for their aquarium.  Got his 10 yesterday and picked out a Black Tetra.  Staff has been very nice to him!\n\nSince we have been going there, service has been top notch.  Every server we have has been attentive, knowledgable, and willing to accommodate special requests.  This is a RARE find today.\n\nOn to yesterdays lunch...\n\nRed Devil has some great lunch specials under $10.00  They have several pastas to choose from and all the pasta dishes come w/ either a salad or soup.  They also have a couple of pizza's on the lunch menu for $5.99 (they call it a personal pizza, but it was about a 12\" pie).\n\nI have been getting the spaghetti and meat balls lately.  The pasta is thinner than a regular spaghetti and is cooked al dente.  The red sauce; while not as good a mine, is very tasty.  The red sauce is thick and not watery at all.  They give you 2 average size meatballs in the dish.  I have had meatballs at some restaurants that are so dry, you need a glass of water to choke them down.  Not the case here.  The meatballs at Red Devil are very moist and go great w/ the sauce.\n\nAs I stated earlier, the pasta entries on the lunch menu come w/ a side of salad or soup.  I have been getting the salad; it's the standard iceberg lettuce w/ croutons, cucumber, carrot and onion.  What makes it so good is the house made Italian dressing they have to go with it.  The dressing has a very good flavor and they are not skimpy w/ it.\n\nMy son had the personal pizza w/ pepperoni.  Nice sized pizza (no salad w/ this one).  Thin crust NY style and plenty big for lunch.  Every pizza I have had at Red Devil has been good.  This one was no exception.  Sauce was good and had a nice amount of pepperoni on it (about 3 pieces per slice).  The sauce and toppings extended out to within 1/4-1/2 inch of the edge.  \n\nLunches also come w/ house made rolls and real butter.\n\nI have been to Red Devil about 8x in the last 3 months.  The service and food have been good each time.  The lunch specials are a good value and the service has been great.  I hope they don't change a thing!", "business_id": "0gQrhOYWdO0XVZEKtOrvaA", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-07-11", "type": "review"}

But I read some reviews here that almost scared me away from Gino's. If you love planned communities, big-box stores and chain restaurants, you will probably find something negative to say about this place, no matter what. I think I'm somewhere in the middle and can (at times) be a food snob, especially when it comes to pizza. I'm from the East coast. I can be very critical of food, in general. I don't really like chain anything. Which is why I gave it a shot, regardless of what I read. So, here's my honest opinion. First, the pizza: I ordered, Reg Crust, extra cheese, onions & bell peppers. The crust is truly super thin. (think flatbread). Everything is fresh. There is nothing wrong with the sauce or cheese. It is adequately flavorful. If you are a big sauce lover, get extra. I think it's fine. Next time I will order Thick crust and won't order extra cheese. Gino's is more than generous with their toppings. The little container of hot pepper seeds were actually Hot! Nice switch from the usually tasteless packets most places give you (mouth still burning, yay!) It's not the prettiest pizza you'll ever eat, but who cares? I don't like the way they cut it (in squares). I will also request that they cut it like a pizza, next time. Second, the location: personally, I like the flavor of So Pho, and so do they. No apologies here. I got the feeling that they embraced diversity and are a little \"edgy\". Yes, they do have old school pinball machines. Cute. Plenty of seating. Clean and comfortable. Service: Outstanding. Super pleasant. Owner on premises. Friendly and helpful people. This is a family business. I love that. All in All, YES, I will go to Gino's again.

About 80% of the condiments on the salad bar were all gone and what was there was full of water from the condensation. I asked the manager if she was going to refill the condiments and said yes and starting refilling everything without first removing all the old watered down condiment containers. So our salads were all watered down from the water. The potato salad was so watered down it poured like soup.

When we asked for a new plate we were told the salad bar is no longer all you can eat. Never was this told to us at the time of purchase. So after getting really upset i asked the manager for a corporate number to file a complaint. Her answer was I can give you the number but nobody will see it because the complaint will jisy be forwarded to our store. At that point I said I no longer wish to dine there and asked for a refund. The pizza came and my family started eating. So i walked over and told them to stop eating because we were leaving.

So after arguing back and forth she charged me about $8 for the 4 slices and was going to refund me the rest to my card. PETER PIPER PIZZA was a way better choice for dinner last night.

Although there are a number of locations throughout the Valley now, I remember when living in Ahwatukee going to Nellos, and seeing the late Pat Tillman, his wife, along with his brother and Jake Plummer eating pizza and having a good time. Everyone knew who Pat and Jake were, but they were left along, treated like normal customers, and it made for a special memory everytime we would see them. The pizza is the foundation, but with a great offering of sandwhiches and Italian dishes, there isn't a bad item on the menu. I truly love the house dressing that they make and bottle for purchase.

However in this case I must, if I am to tell the truth. \n\nAbout a month ago my fianc\u00e9 and I stopped by Bell Italia simply because we love good pizza and this place had a great review on Yelp. \n\nLet me tell you a little about myself, I am over a half century old and I'm a New York transplant (1993), I have tried some of the best pizza and Italian food in the United States and there have been times in my life were all I ate for weeks was pizza and Italian food. So I have eaten a lot of Pizza. \n\nYes I am Fat, but I'm working on losing it. \n\nWe were really looking forward to finding another place that we could go to and get some good pizza. \n\nSorry Bell Italia you didn't step up to the plate in several ways. \n\nWe each ordered a salad, now I understand that salads are in some cases are made beforehand and placed in the refrigerator. This is apparently what they do here at Bell Italia. The unfortunate part is that some of the lettuce in my salad was brown and wilted. Too much time between making the salad and service. \n\nI hate when I pay for something that is wilted. \n\nNow on the extreme cool and good tip, these folks cater to you like no others. They are friendly and very attentive and I would give them 5 stars in this category alone. \n\nNow back to the bread and the pizza. While eating my slightly wilted salad I also tried some of the Italian bread that they give us. I noticed that there was something a little funky (not quite right) about the flavor of the bread. First, I like crusty Italian bread, this bread was soft. But again it was mostly the flavor that disappointed; I just can't put my finger on it. In any case they must make the dough in house and use the same dough for the pizza, because the pizza had the same off flavor. It was a big pizza (24in) so we took home what was left and I tried it the next day, same funky flavor. \n\nLet me say this bothered me so much and I liked the reception these folks gave us so much that I literally went on the internet to find out how to make Italian bread. Furthermore, I visited several other pizza places in town and tasted their pizza again to compare the difference and there is something definitely off with the dough at Bell Italia. \n\nI truly hope that the people at Bell Italia take the time to see what they can do to improve on the dough. They are great people and I want them to continue to succeed in the face of additional competition. \n\nIn conclusion, I WILL give them another chance however next time I will try their entrees, but please make sure my salad is not brown or wilted and my Italian bread tastes great and is crusty. I wouldn't suggest Bell Italia to anyone at this point. I will take the bullet for you. Look for my future review on the bread and entrees. I hope it's a good one.", "business_id": "hgb1RihLYRSpFBjBhn8rZw", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-07-10", "type": "review"}

And for local places in my community, I will often say nothing if I don't have anything nice to say. But this experience was so thoroughly terrible I'm making an exception. A friend visiting from out of state was thrilled we had a Hungry Howie's in our town as this was her favorite pizza chain back east. Since we had not had a chance to try it yet, we gave it a go. First we tried ordering on the web site but it does not allow you to select a flavor for the crust - that seemed odd considering how much they promote this and rely on it to differentiate themselves from all the other pizza joints in town. OK, so we tried calling our order in. We had seen the specials on the web site, but when we asked for it on the phone, a teenage-sounding guy told us they didn't have that promotion and it would cost roughly double the advertised price. At this point I started getting annoyed, but I kept calm and ordered on, after all, our friend loves this place, maybe the food will redeem it. Since we were already out and about, we declined delivery and went in to get it. Imagine my surprise when we saw the front of the building was plastered with large advertisements exactly matching what we saw online. There were also posters and stands inside the restaurant showing these same deals. Really?! How could this guy NOT know the specials they offer? Does he come in through the back door every day? Does he never look left when he answers the phone? I probably should have said something, but at this point it was worth the extra money to not prolong any interaction with this person. I paid and left. At home we realized they never offered us a choice of dipping sauces for the bread sticks and that the pizza did not have the flavored crust we ordered. The bread sticks were burnt and tough. We tried to eat a couple but ended up throwing them away, which if you know me is atypical - I will eat terrible food rather than waste it, but this was beyond edible. The pizza was cooked to perfection, but the cheap ingredients and \"canned\" tasting sauce put it below average. Our friend assured us she has never had this experience at the other stores she has been to, that even the web site is better for other stores, and that we just have a bad one. Until this location brings its customer service and product quality up to the standards the chain apparently sets for its other locations, there is no chance we will be returning.", "business_id": "gP7xl3ZjX-7H9mRk7bvesw", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-06-21", "type": "review"}

It's very close to our home and I was hopeful to find some good pizza.  During my first experience a cute young girl was our server.  She was the only server for a whole restaurant full of people and she was also the counter person that took the order.  She was nice and friendly, but our service wasn't fabulous because one person can only do so much for an entire restaurant full of people.  From the point we received our food she came back only at the end to give us a box and I had to go up to the counter to pay our check because we had somewhere we needed to be.  I thought maybe someone had called out sick or something.  The pizza was thin, cheesy, and greasy.  It was good,  but it didn't wow me.\nWe decided to give it another chance, so we went back.  This time we had white pizza and a sausage roll.  Our waitress was the same girl.  The service situation was the same which leads me to believe that they just don't have enough people scheduled to work ever.  The girl who works there is nice and friendly and I saw her and the other 2 kitchen employees that were there running around and doing their best.  I felt bad for them because I've worked in numerous restaurants over the years and I felt like they were set up to fail.  The sausage roll came out 10 minutes before my pizza did.  It's always awkward when you go out to eat and one person is completely finished with their food before the other even receives their.  The sausage roll was the poorest excuse for a sausage roll I've ever seen.  It was doughy and not very flavorful.  If you decide to try this place stick to pizza with marinara sauce. The white pizza was bland and also not very flavorful.  If you decide to try this place stick to pizza with marinara sauce. I would have liked to have had some red pepper to pizazz it up, but our server was unable to come back and check on us because she was too busy.  Also I overheard at least 2 sets of customers that came in to order pizza and ended up leaving because they were told the wait was very long.  I applaud her for letting them know about the long wait up front because that's the right thing to do.  However, I feel like the management needs to hire some more employees because you should never be turning away people because you're too busy.  Lastly, I've seen other people mention this on their review, but we reeked of and oil/smoke odor after we left.

We grabbed our bottled PBR and made our way over to the side where there are games and pool tables. Still loud but at least you could yell and be heard.  Shot a few rounds of pool.There is a big padded bench that runs around the room,unfortunately if you are sitting on it, your likely to get hit with the back end of a pool cue.

The restaurant was nearly empty, quiet, and the staff was welcoming on our way to our table.\n\nWe got Donny as our waiter. He is extremely lively (he admits his enthusiasm; ha), accommodating, understanding, and personable.\n\nGiven their huge menu, we took forever to place our order. They do serve \"family style\", so most dishes can be split for 2 people. If you are there with one other person, you could get one dish and a side, or two dishes if you both want each others food and are fairly hungry.\n\nWe decided to start with the Antipasti Buca Trio. We had a shellfish allergy at our table, but the manager and the waiter were both understanding and went above and beyond to make our order conform to our needs. For the record they are also able to accommodate gluten-intolerant guests and offer a separate one-sheet laminated menu upon request.\n\nThe calamari was crunchy, and the portion size in the trio was good. The breading wasn't too thick, the calamari wasn't greasy, and the marinara sauce was for dipping was delicious (they offer jars of the stuff for sale).\n\nTheir stuffed mushrooms were the best we've had. Compared to some other restaurants, these mushrooms were fairly large, the stuffing was overflowing, and the pesto they were served over was creamy and nutty.\n\nWe ordered the Chopped Salad (wonderful dressing, large portion), Chicken Carbonara with whole grain penne pasta (can be ordered in any dish), and the Chianti Braised Short Ribs.\n\nThe portion for the short ribs was two fairly large slabs of beef. This dish did not have sides, so one hungry person could finish the entree, or it can be split. The ribs themselves were sub-par; they were fairly grizzly (a lot of fat around the edges and throughout). The meat was moist and juicy though, and the sauce was sweet, savory, and delicious. After cutting away all of the grizzle, I was able to easily finish the two pieces of beef.\n\nThe Carbonara was very good. A lot of prosciutto and chicken throughout, and it was seasoned very well with no additional salt necessary.\n\nAlthough fairly full at this point, we cannot visit an Italian restaurant without trying the Tiramisu. Wow!! Our favorite Tiramisu we've ever tried. Although there wasn't as much espresso and rum flavor as I would have hoped, it was so creamy and delicious. The portion size was huge, it was well priced, and I would go back ten-fold just for the dessert!! The best part?? The walnut brownie chunks served on top!\n\nLove Buco, would recommend this location, and ask for Donny if you can handle a lot of enthusiasm and laughter. Sure it is expensive, but for a special occasion it is wonderful. Get the Tiramisu!!", "business_id": "sllZXXYijYUs-n80uSa96w", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-08-22", "type": "review"}

We visited this location as well as the downtown Phoenix location before it for years. Now that I live in the far west valley, it's been, easily 10 years since I last visited OSP.  We happened to be in the neighborhood for a Convention so we brought a large group of friends to experience OSP themselves.\n\nFirst things first, this place is visited by a lot of retirees. And by a lot I'd say that we were the youngest group there by at least 50 years...and the glares to the kids in our group did not go unnoticed. But our kids are all very well behaved despite the daggered looks from those who forget what it's like to have children. \n\nSpeaking of children, OSP is not very kid-friendly when it comes to certain areas that we apparently take for granted. There are no cups with lids on them at all. We were informed that they need to have a special 'license' for that from Pepsi. This is news to me as I've worked with Pepsi for years and know of no special license. The excuse was that they were afraid that people would take the kid cups, put alcoholic beverages in them and walk out of the restaurant. um...WHAT? Additionally, if you have a child who requires his pizza cut up into smaller pieces, good luck trying to find a knife there. There was 1 and I mean o-n-e (1) butter knife in the whole restaurant that we practically had to sign over our first born child in order to use. I'm pretty sure that the retirees aren't looking to shank each other in the parking lot so to have to play verbal judo with the staff to use a standard utensil was really ridiculous.\n\nThe restaurant is now cash-only. This means no debit or credit cards are taken but they conveniently have an ATM machine located in the lobby to not only dispense cash but charge a hefty $3 fee to use. If you want to have a refill on your drink, there is a charge for that too. Buying drinks by the pitcher is fine but it's soda...seriously? The pizza is alright, the salad bar is 1 trip only and is sparse at best. \n\nThe single saving grace of it all is the Organ. The piece de resistance. This is a good thing and a bad thing because given all that I've described, its simply not enough for me to drive an hour out of my way for an otherwise aggravating time between musical sets. While you're there, it makes those aggravating occurrences not quite so bad though because it's such a unique, memorable, interesting experience. I loved OSP as a child and enjoyed so many wonderful, memorable visits.

My family loves it.\n\nThe truth is, if you read the reviews, they are all spot on in one way or another.  Yes, its cash only.....   yes, they make you stand in a second line to buy drinks, and salad, and ice cream.  yes, the pizza is not drawing Oprah Winfrey to it to declare it the best pizza in America.  \n\nBUT....\n\nThis is the most unique thing you will ever see.  The food is good enough, and priced about what you would expect.  In fact, I think the quality has actually gone up over the years, but pizza is like coffee - snobs abound speculating what makes a pizza great.  At the end of the day, this pizza is pretty good for the family.  No one complains, everyone eats full amounts.\n\nBut unlike other \"unique\" places that are \"unique\" because they have funny pictures of people urinating in the bathroom, or kayaks on the walls or whatever, this actually has an oddly unique entertainment concept.  \n\nWe have tried it several ways, and do note, if you have not been, there is a method to the madness - if you swim with the fish, its far easier than swimming against the school.  What I mean by that is this:\n\nThe place gets PACKED.  When it opens there is a HUGE amount of people outside.  But their business goes in waves.  All the people crowd in, and order pizza at the same time, get drinks at the same time, sit at the same time, and for all practical purposes, leave at the same time.\n\nThe first \"Set\" is all old folks and families with tiny kids.  If you go with this crowd, get there 15 mins before it opens and don't freak when you are in a big line - you will get the seats you want.  \n\nBut, the interesting thing, is that if you go later in the evening, at the end of each set, a large group of people will leave all at once.  This ends up being the best time to go, because there are no lines, and you get great seats.   It's inevitable, if its packed, wait 3o minutes and half the crowd will leave, all at once!  \n\nThe organ itself is massive, and the instruments littered all over the roof, walls and back of the restaurant are controlled in time with the music.  In many cases, you can't really figure out which pipes are playing, but \"big\" songs like ITS A SMALL WORLD, and STAR WARS seem to use every instrument and its amazing.  Kids love it, old folks love it, everyone loves it.  (fair warning, I was one of those people that grew up with this place as a kid, in the 1970's.....  LOTS of great memories here, and my kids get the same experience that I had back then - it hasn't changed that much).  \n\nLater in the evening, things like the Canadian Flag descend and the Canada anthem plays, with lots of people getting up and singing and crying, followed by the Star Spangled Banner and Old Glory, Followed by Mickey Mouse Club flag, etc.  This is the kind of place, that you better stand and put your hand over your heart or you WILL get a WW2 Vet punching your jaw.\n\nWe bring all sorts of family and visitors here.  Do we bring them to show them that we have found the worlds best Pizza?  No.  A great Micro Brew selection?  oh no....  The best music you ever heard?  No (things played on an organ sound different).  But we take them here because when you add up all the small parts, its the most unique thing you have ever witnessed.  It comes off as one of those little niche concepts that some crazy inventor came up with that may work no where else but on this street corner.\n\nBelieve it, people come here to celebrate 50 yr wedding anniversaries and stuff - they read them out loud and its amazing.  This place, with all its random uniqueness is part of the culture of Phoenix and Arizona - which, is why it lands on lists for good dating experiences, etc.  If you propose to your future wife here, yes, you have no taste, but bring your kids here?

I even took my hearing aids out and it was still loud.\n\nOh, and they serve pizza, salad, beer, soda and have a sundae bar.  I had the pizza, it wasn't bad if you count frozen pizza as delicious.  The salad greens were fresh and industrial quality, the dressings were the big four, Blue Cheese, French, Ranch and Italian, all apparently coming from a jug.  maybe the same jug - as I tried the ranch and the blue cheese and there was no discernible difference other than the blue cheese had some soft lumps of something in it.  \n\nThe iced tea was watery and instant, but made recently. \n\nIf you have never eaten a tasteless salad and mediocre pizza washed down with watery beverages while being pounded by organ style show tunes sound, sitting at cafeteria-style tables, then you gotta try this place. \n\n If you go back it's your own damn fault.", "business_id": "VRxelK__tuQD0KBxx2LzeQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-08-17", "type": "review"}
