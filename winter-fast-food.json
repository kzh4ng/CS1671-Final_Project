I was unnaturally attracted to their Wisconsin Buttery Burger, which is a double patty cheeseburger topped with grilled onions between two buns that have been buttered. Sounds good right?\n\nWell, I get this delicious diet abomination and discover that my buns had been dunked in butter. The pearly gates of cholesterol laden heaven with the triglyceride angels were singing to me.  I took the liberty of increasing my sodium intake by pouring their burger/fries seasoning on the buns and I literally got tears in my eyes....most likely from the salt overload, but possibly because this was one of the most evilly decadent things I had eaten in a long time.\n\nThis is not meant to be a fine dining experience. Service wasn't fast but it wasn't slow. It just kind of was. However, the waitress did get a point for explaining that the order would take X amount of time to all patrons.

But after we ordered, what really got me angry was that the food took a VERY long time to arrive. We had 2 kids with us and we ordered 2 kids meals, and had asked for those to be brought sooner. After about 25-30 minutes of nothing, I went to the servers (who were just NOT paying attention to us anyway - the main server's name for our table was Angel) and asked where our meals were. One checked with another, who then informed me that they were working on it. \nWhat made me even angrier is that they tried to downplay everything, telling me that it had only been 5 minutes. Then one of the servers (manager?) tells me that \"ok, may be it's been 10 minutes, but it's coming\". Then I hear some of the servers talking about our orders. The same gentleman then came to our table, sat down next to me and told me that it's only been 10 minutes and that they were working on our order, and tried to give me some explanation about why that's not really a long time at all. It was clearly almost half an hour or longer by that time. \nThe food finally arrived about 10 minutes after that. But the food came cold. \nWe were so HUNGRY by that point, we just ate whatever we could. Neither Angel nor anyone else came to top up our drinks even ONCE. I had to ask for mine, but by that point I was in no mood to take a sip even. \nI paid ($58.20) and I again got the same gentleman who tried (again!) to explain to me that it was just 10 minutes, and that \"given everything, we were within normal limits\". Wow. \nAfter about an hour and half at the restaurant, we all just shook our heads and left. \n\nI have written to them on their website, and will see if they follow up. \n\nWe have vowed NEVER to go to this restaurant again.

The whole point of going to McDonald's is indulging in some not-good-for-you food on the go in your busy life. In my case, I just wanted a small meal/snack that wouldn't cost me as much as the stuff in Kennywood would. I hadn't even eaten at a McDonald's in about eight years or so. And I quickly remembered why!\n\nForget the fact that McDonald's food isn't great. We all know it's not great. The problem here is that they added insult to injury by giving you the worst customer service ever in addition to not so good food. For starters, I quickly discovered that the drive-thru here is the ABSOLUTE slowest line on planet Earth. You certainly won't be getting any fast food here! Then, once I FINALLY placed my order, and finally got to the window to pay (because of course I spent a lot of time waiting for the people in front of me to even get their orders), a young woman took my card, swiped it...and didn't say another word. I waited thinking she was printing a receipt - nope! Eventually - after whipping out her phone and sending a text or two - she realized I was still there and told me to go to the next window for my food. Whatever, I figured, forget the receipt; by then I was pretty sure she had moved on to other orders and couldn't print my receipt anyway. On to the next window, where I was given my food and drink...and I proceeded to quickly discover they gave me no straw and for some reason, layered my Big Mac as such: bread, bread, patty, patty, bread. ...seriously, how does one even mess that up? I give one brownie point because the fries really were actually pretty good...but they were not worth the wait or trouble.\n\nI concur with the other reviewers: skip this place. Completely. Just keep driving.

Even though there were only five customers in the store, it took nearly 20 minutes to prepare all five orders, after they were already taken.

The cashier responded that she doesn't want to \"yell\" at Gary again.\n\nAs I cleaned my tray, I discovered the reason the garbage cans so desperately needed changed--I tried all three in the restaurant, but all of them were so full that I could barely open up the swing door on them, let alone put anything inside.

The various salsas, guacs and picos. They've got the usual toppers for your burrito or salad. When you're just craving that Mexican face-smash of flavor these kinds of places are where it's too be found. But the reason I'm giving them only three stars is because of hidden up-charges. Well, I suppose the hidden part is debatable. They tell you outright that pretty much anything delicious you want to add to your burrito is an up-charge. Guacamole, for example, is an extra charge. Go to Moe's, you can put whatever you want on your burrito from their line-up, no extra charge. I think Qdoba might find that they even make more money if they just charge a slightly higher price for everything and let the customer choose what they want on it without having to constantly ask \"Oh wait, does that cost more?\"", "business_id": "qC21Nl_OUfTr_xf8ZjzOcg", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-02-16", "type": "review"}

Her response., \"oh you want a spoon or straw\"?? Mind you, you should see the attitude and the neck rolling when she said that.. So I said.. Duhhh, common sense isn't it.

Well, this is great. I got the salad with no steaks.. Was I surprised.. Not at all. He called to tell them about it and asked if I wanted him to go back for \"the steaks\".

I pulled into the drive-thru at 7:20 a.m., and all the inside and outside lights were on, including the drive-thru menu's, but the only person working was the guy power-washing the sidewalks--nobody home even though there were signs everywhere advertising that the place was now open for breakfast! I headed to my office dejectedly and checked the website to find out this location doesn't open until 9 a.m. If you're going to serve a breakfast menu, please keep breakfast hours that suit the average commuting breakfast eater, especially when you're competing with a dozen other fast food joints in a half-mile radius who are all also serving breakfast but open at 6 if they're not already open 24 hours. I have had other stuff from here since I've worked and lived nearby for the past 10 years, and it's otherwise decent service and passable fast food, but with so many other affordable and decent Mexican joints around with drive-thru windows, this isn't worth it for lunch or dinner, either, unless you're in a real time crunch.", "business_id": "5UBAWhxukaPrc_0DalT-3w", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-01-27", "type": "review"}

As with any Fill-In-The-Bertos, you have to know what to expect, and know what to order.  Here is a quick guide to a pleasant experience:\n\n1.  What time is it?  If it is 2:40 a.m. and you spent the entire night at your favorite bar hitting on every girl there, but you are in the long Berto's line alone at 3 a.m., order whatever sounds good, and lots of it.  You aren't as attractive and smart as you thought you were when you were drunk, so you might as well go home, eat yourself into a stupor, and pass out watching infomercials.  These recommendations are for you, you fat tub of lard:\n\na.  Cheese quesadilla \nb.  Shredded beef tacos (minimum of 3)\nc.  Rolled Tacos (one order to eat while you drive home)\nd.  Any burrito on the menu\n\n2.  It is dinnertime, you have had a long day, and your wife says bring home some Mexican food.  You are tired, and don't want to stop at a sit down restaurant and wait for the hostess to remember your food that is sitting in the kitchen.  You pull into Berto's drive thru.  There menu is huge, and a lot of their food is junk food, but there are a few gems on the menu:\n\na.  Can't go wrong with the burritos.  I personally love the chile relleno burrito, the carnitas burrito, and the carne asada burrito.  Get the green sauce with these.  I get a side of jalapenos with them too.\n\nb.  Tacos: chicken or shredded beef-- Stay away from any Berto's fish tacos or seafood in general!  I've tried and tried, but have never had a good seafood anything here.   Get the red salsa with these.  Stay away from the rolled tacos too, they are not food.\n\nc.  Never get a combo dinner plate.  The rice and beans are crap, the enchilada sauce is pathetic, and it is all going to leak out of the to-go box, through the bag and into your seat.  Stick with the burritos and tacos.\n\n\n3.  What?  You still think this place is no good?  Your expectations are just silly, and your opinion is uninformed.  Fill-In-The-Bertos is a sacred temple to those who know  what they like.  If you are like me, and think onions are God's gift to food, you should like this place.

I feel like this is a great alternative to eating fried chicken. I find myself able to eat a full meal with out the guilt that comes with eating McDonalds or Popeyes or any other fast food. If I'm in the mood for something super healthy, which I haven't been in a while lol, I'll go for their humongous chicken tostadas. The whole thing is delicious including the taco shell bowl that it comes in. Their chicken is just amazing. You can taste that it is freshly grilled after marinating forever. Even though it is fast food, it doesn't taste like it! On the more regular occasion we usually opt for the family meal that comes with 8 pieces of chicken, 2 large sides, a salad and dessert for about $20. Macaroni and cheese is my side of choice; super cheesy (probably not healthy). We get some flour tortillas and make little tacos with the chicken, salsa and rice (Eric likes to put Mac n cheese in too).

He didn't look special, but I've seen people with actual downs syndrome be more intelligent than the staff at this place. A Salad shouldn't be that difficult. \nWhen it was finally my turn to ask for a Chicken Tostada salad with chicken breast only (no dark meat) and no sour cream, it was like I just asked the cashier to turn water into wine... He called the manager over and I explained what I ordered. He said yes that is what is the computer. I responded with how am I suppose to know because I can't see the computer screen and the cashier kept asking what's white meat only... Then the manager starts speaking spanish about me, Like I won't understand, but guess what just because I am white doesn't mean I don't understand spanish. So for 2 of us to order it took a total of 15 minutes, which to me is a very long time at a fast food restaurant.\n\nWhile the food always comes through, Especially the avocado salsa, the service is HORRIBLE at this particular location. I will find a different EPL to dine at in the future.\n\n***just a side note - they got rid of the liquid queso for the nachos - so the nachos are now pretty disappointing.", "business_id": "TBTaMIaeDw5B79hXDZBtrA", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-12-16", "type": "review"}

By then you're just walking back from getting your soda from their new touch-screen soda machine. Yeah...it's touch screen. There's so many flavors of drinks in this thing! My favorite is to mix Orange Coca-Cola and Vanilla Coca-Cola.

And trust me, this place can get packed during the lunch hour. \n\nPARKING TIP: If you're looking for a parking spot during the lunch hour it's nearly impossible. However, if you park on the north end of the Walgreen's next door (under the trees), there's almost always a spot. If that's full, then the spots at the front of Walgreen's on the east side are always opened. All you have to do is walk around the corner and BAM!

It had been quite a long time since I'd eaten at Pei Wei. It's not the same quality as it was when it opened. In the beginning...the food was barely second to that served at a PF Changs. It was quite good, easy to access and everything that accompanied the food was higher quality (drinks, napkins, fortune cookies, staff/bussers).\n\nI ordered a small chicken orange peel with brown rice ($6.49) and my BF ordered the large shrimp kung pao ($9.99) and we also ordered 2 side spring rolls $3.79. I believe the smaller portion option is new to Pei Wei as I'm sure they're trying to capture a larger market w/less expensive prices or portions. For lunch, the small is just fine for most, especially if you get an extra little side with it. \n\nBUT...HERE'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SMALL AND ORIGINAL PORTION SIZE..YOU PAY MORE FOR ADD'L RICE WHEN YOU ORDER THE ORIGINAL, NOT ADD'L MEAT.\n\nPlate next to plate my BF had the same amount of meat (shrimp) in comparison to my (chicken)...his plate was larger and it had more than twice the amount of rice on my plate. So comparing apples to apples you pay $2 to $2.20 more for MORE rice, not necessarily more meat when you order an original vs a small depending on what kind of meat you order. \n\nSo...Just wanted to give you the heads up when you consider ordering small or original.", "business_id": "PxqufEwqzIHAbQGRdZ3bUw", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-12-28", "type": "review"}

Unfortunately, my roommate gave in to convenience and brought home subs from this one. Even before anything was unwrapped, I just knew it was going to be awful, and I was right.\n\nI'm sorry, but these people have either never been trained on how to make subs, or they've been instructed by the owners to be as skimpy as possible with the toppings. The lettuce was lightly sprinkled on, as if you might add a dash of oregano. At first I thought it had been forgotten! Couldn't detect any crunch whatsoever. I had to open it to find out if there was any on there. There were maybe eight pieces of black olives on the entire footlong sandwich! Even the tomatoes were skimped on by a couple pieces (compared to EVERY OTHER SUBWAY I'VE EVER BEEN TO). So really, our sandwiches were  practically just lumps of wadded up meat and cheese, slathered with a little mayo on bread. This is NOT good to me at all, and not what I want or expect from Subway. We shouldn't have to pay for this garbage! \n\nSo why am I SO incredibly angry right now? James is an a**-h*le and was incredibly rude to my roommate on the phone when he politely called to complain and get the situation rectified. He downright refused to allow him to speak to a manager (or have the manager call him later) and only offered to replace half of my pathetically-made footlong. What about my son's 6\"? The half of my footlong that I did eat? (I was going to bring the other half so they can see how badly it was made.) We were hungry. Are we really expected to stop eating (while very hungry), jump in the car and hurry over there during rush-hour? No, that's not good customer service. We weren't looking for anything extra either, even though it's a pain to drive back to a restaurant because of something they did wrong. We just wanted what we paid for. \n\nWhy are all the other Subways we've been to consistently good and this one consistently sucks? Not the first bad experience with James either (all-around bad attitude) but certainly the last time we spend a dime at this franchise.\n\nWe will be talking to corporate about this.", "business_id": "FucrEEO2laIlAnIZ_n6cTA", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-12-19", "type": "review"}

Not just because I'm a freaking fast food junkie so it was going to happen one of these days anyhow - but because of today's experience.\n\nI've been to this one, well, let's just say more than several times.  The food is always.... uneventful.  It's not one of those specifically great or specifically bad ones.  It's just..... fine?  The only really good thing I got there once was their big breakfast.  It was only McDonald's good, but man it tasted good that day.\n\nAnyhow, so I was grabbing a breakfast burrito (that stupid healthy yogurt was not going to calm the grumbling monster that was my tummy that morning).  For breakfast, I'll normally either get my item solo, or as the meal w/ OJ.  But I remembered seeing last week that in a blind taste test, the McDonald's coffee actually scored higher on a taste test than Starbucks.  So I figured I'd give it a shot.  \n\nACKKKKKKK!!!!!!!!  PLECCCHHHHH!!!  Ick!  Ug!  Gross!  Spit, spit, spit....   I wanted to wipe my tongue down w/ the wood tasting napkin to scrape it all off.  \n\nThey had thrown in some sugar and cream.  I'll normally do a cream and a sugar for one this sized.  I initially tried it black. I thought maybe it was better w/ the stuff added.  This was a SMALL cup, and I added both creamers and all 6 sugars they gave me and I could barely taste any sweetness.  It was like the black hole of coffee condiments.  What is totally sad - I ended up drinking about 1/2-3/4 the cup just trying it after adding each condiment.  I really wanted it to be better.  Kept waiting for that magic ingredient.  It didn't come.  \n\nNasty, nasty, nasty.  Mediocre fast food, fine.

But decided to give this place a shot since they offer a few healthy options. Big mistake!!! OK so first off the service was good, and the place was clean except for the area in front of the soda machine. It really needed to be wiped down big time.\n\nI guess my biggest gripe had to be with the food. It was nasty!! Flavorless beans, dry chicken that was closer to jerky and a tortilla that seemed to change colors at the bottom. Not sure why but did not remember paying for a color changing burrito. \n\nNow I understand that this is just a take out place that is very similar to say a taco bell or Del taco, but the food is bad at these places as well. I have to say while the food is bad the service and free refills of horchata did make me at least feel they deserved the one star I gave them, but wish I could have gotten a refund.

All of the Chipotle's that I have eaten at have been very good, except for one in downtown Washington DC where a group of kids ran through the dining room chased by police officers.  They trashed the place, and spilled a perfume display that one of the kids was trying to sell.  Which may have been why the police were chasing them I don't know.  What I do know is the perfume smelled terrible.\n\nAnyway back to Chandler.  The good thing about Chipotle is the menu.  It is very simple.  Basically you walk up to the counter and tell the nice person what you want to eat.  All the food is displayed in front of you.  You can mix and match it any way you like.  Tacos, burritos,   even melted cheese things that aren't on the menu but kids seem to love them.  \n\nThere are a few different kinds of meat.  Carnetias or braised pork, grilled chicken, and two different kinds of beef.  One grilled the other BBQed.  Fresh green peppers and onions lightly seasoned and sauteed but still crispy.  Two kinds of beans, pinto and black.  The servers are quick to tell you that the pinto beans are not for strict vegetarians or the kosher crowd.    Rice seasoned with a little cilantro that is very tasty, and last but not least delicious guacamole.  As your meal (usually a burrito for me) is assembled it moves down the counter to the salsa section.  There are a few different kinds of salsa.  A spicy red one, I don't know what is in it but it is my favorite.  A tomato, onion, cilantro mild one.  Corn relish that goes in my burrito too, and a green one that I never tired.  Then some sour cream and cheese and they magically roll it and wrap it in a tin foil sleeve.  \n\nWith really good food places it is the little things that can make or break them.  For example sour cream.  Pretty basic stuff right.  At Chipolte it is delectable.  I can't find sour cream near as good at any grocery store.  The tortillas are big and seem to stretch enough to wrap whatever they put in the burrito.  Did I mention that these burritos are really big?  If you don't want to go the tortilla route they will make your burrito in a bowl.  Same stuff just no tortilla.  I once ate at the Chipolte in Lawrence Kansas with a friend.  She ate two burritos.  She is a freak, don't try it you may explode.  \n\nThey seem to be proud of their chips.  Most places offer them free of charge.  Chipolte charges for them.  They could be good I've never had them, but lot's of folks order them.    \n\nNo doubt about it this is fast food.  I stopped by last Tuesday at noon.  Just before I walked in 14 giggling high school kids ran up in front of me.  The line was to the door.  Ten minutes later I was at the counter watching my burrito grow.  Amazing.  Just because it is fast food doesn't mean it has to taste bland or be cold.   \n\nThis place is not cheap.  Eight and a half bucks for a burrito and a small drink.  I'll keep looking for a better burrito.  Till I find one Chipotle sets the bar.", "business_id": "Cv4kZH9zN0wpN2Drn0qkLg", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-12-09", "type": "review"}

I don't just like the place, I love it. I've been obsessed with their burritos since this location opened over a decade ago. I've tried everything on the menu more than once, and although I have my favorites, I can honestly say there isn't one item on the menu I don't love. I consider myself a bit if a connoisseur having eaten Chipotle so many times, this being the location I frequent the most.\n\nSo it pains me to say that everything that makes Chipotle great, from the delicious marinated meats to the scrumptious cilantro lime rice, is almost completely absent at this location. I've eaten here less and less often over the past several months because the consistency of the food quality has deteriorated. Not once, not twice, but multiple times the meat has been so poorly seasoned it doesn't taste a thing like Chipotle. Not just the carnitas, which at times are salty beyond being palatable. Not just the chicken, which has been increasingly bland. But even the barbacoa, which lately has tasted along the lines of boiled beef.\n\nThe rice is a serious letdown, and anyone who eats Chipotle knows this is what makes their burrito special. Poorly seasoned, and yes, frequently undercooked. Sorry, but there's just no mistaking that crunch of uncooked rice. My son had a full two sides if it in his kids meal. That represented half of what was on his plate. We requested new rice, and one of the guys in the back seemed stupefied we'd bothered to complain. The replacement rice from the next batch? Exactly the same as the first.\n\nThe guacamole with our chips and guac was also smooth and creamy, not the typical chunkier texture.\n\nChipotle needs to take a serious look at this restaurant, and decide if it really represents the quality brand they've established. Or maybe it's a case where they've become too big to care. I've already contacted the restaurant as well as corporate, and there's zero improvement. Sure, if you don't eat Chipotle often you might think it's a decent burrito (key word being \"decent\"). If you're a regular, you know how bad it's become.\n\nAll the long time workers at this one appear to be gone now. Maybe the current crew just lacks the ability to keep Chipotle tasting like Chipotle. What a disappointment. I recommend trying a different location.

You do order your food yourself at the counter, get your number and find yourself a seat you like. I do not see anything wrong with that, do you? No longer then a few minutes they bring out your food to your table. And ... Yummm.. Yummm its good.\n\nGood lil' joint.\n\n\"I like\"\n\nEugene", "business_id": "WixkMVXXFCx-lYsr6JoF6Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-02-10", "type": "review"}

Maybe it is the whole corporate entity thing.  I am a fan of local restaurants.  So what brought me here was a team lunch with my coworkers.  I had the Mongolian beef with brown rice... this was pretty tasty my only complaint would be that some of the pieces of beef were kind of fatty.  Everyone on my team seemed to enjoy their food.  So I would say for some quick Asian inspired food in a nice environment this would be a good option.  But if you are looking for something a little more impressive I would stick to locally owned restaurants and avoid the chains.", "business_id": "WixkMVXXFCx-lYsr6JoF6Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-02-20", "type": "review"}

I expected something a LOT better than what we found here.  Things seemed pretty good to start--food looked tasty.  Didn't take long for problems to begin showing up:  \n\nFirst off, my wife's lo-mein was pretty darned lo.  The first time she went here several days ago, they used the normal wide noodle that you would usually find in lo-mein.  This time, they used round noodles.  Were they Chinese chow mein noodles?  No, they were vermicelli.  Yes, I'm being a bit picky there, but I'm just getting started.  My wife ordered the lo-mein with no garlic, onions, or shallots.  The problem was, they left out most of the other vegetables as well when the bowl came to the table.  There was the occasional carrot or broccoli sliver, but very few veggies at all.  I called the waiter over to the table and informed him of the situation.  My wife told him that she just wanted to get a bowl of extra veggies to add to the lo-mein.  He took away the lo-mein that she had and said that he would be back shortly.  When he returned, he came back with two bowls--one had the vegetables she asked for, and the other was a brand new bowl of lo-mein with tofu and noodles ONLY.  Uh, what the f*ck?  Why replace the noodles she had with this and then send in a separate bowl of veggies?  Why not either give my wife back her old bowl along with the veggies or just mix up a whole new batch with the veggies?  \n\nMajor issues here--even what she got after all that wasn't very good tasting.  My wife had to add soy sauce for extra flavor, and the vegetables weren't fresh--they obviously tasted like they were frozen before they were put into the wok.\n\nMy food wasn't much better in terms of quality.  I had the vegetable and tofu fried rice.  There was no issue with the quantity of veggies, but they too were of the \"from your grocer's freezer\" variety.  The rice was chalky and undercooked, and I also had to add soy sauce--it didn't do much to improve the flavor.\n\nOur spring rolls were also inferior, and even the fortunes in the fortune cookies were as superficial and vapid as the food we ate.  I liked the friendly table service, and the soda machine that allowed you to flavor the soft drinks any way you like was cool.  This is what made this review two stars instead of one.  But, would I recommend Pei Wei to anyone?  No wei.  If you want a REAL Asian diner, go to Tott's Asian Diner at Ray and McClintock.  Now THAT'S fresh food, and a world of difference over Pei Wei.  Even Panda Express is better than this place.", "business_id": "WixkMVXXFCx-lYsr6JoF6Q", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-02-13", "type": "review"}

I had the Mongolian beef, which was good, but left me grabbing bottles of water all day/night! My friend ordered the Thai dynamite, which I really like!! It didn't seem as salty to me, and tasted soo good with chicken. I had a box full  of Mongolian to take home which I'll douse with more Sriracha + habanero's tomorrow! They have an email club with awesome offers, + fast friendly service. P.F. For sit down(relax)  , pei Wei for fast food asian.

The garlic sriacha that they have in the little jars is also great and a must have if you like spicy. \n\nThey do have a pick a bunch of flavors coke machine so that is always good. The wait can sometimes be around 15 minutes during the lunch or dinner rush but it is well worth it. The price is around $12 for an average lunch with a drink but it is a great quality meal for the price. Overall, great!
