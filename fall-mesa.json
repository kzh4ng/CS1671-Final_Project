Pizza pie. \nNo one could provide for me. I was desolate. Pizza places came and went. A sauce here, a sauce there. \n\nEventually I learned to cope on my own without the crutch that was the perfect slice.

So I had to notify Groupon for a refund--that took a few days but I eventually got my refund processed.

We started off with spicy honey wings as an appetizer. DELICIOUS! The sauce was tangy and flavorful (although not spicy enough, but we have a high tolerance) and the wings were gone in a flash. We had high hopes for the pizza...\n\nI had a mushroom/spinach/tomato slice and a sausage/mushroom Sicilian slice. Well, I had actually ordered the veggie slice to be on a white-garlic sauce style, but the sauce wasn't prepared yet (boo) so I had to get it in the traditional style. \n\nThe mushroom/spinach/tomato slice was very sad-looking. The mushrooms were the canned kind!!! Blasphemy!!! And the amount of veggies was pretty skimpy. The sausage/mushroom slice was not my cup of tea, but I don't know if I'm just not fond of the Sicilian style. \n\nMy husband ordered the calzone and was veeerrrrryyyy disappointed with it. The crust wasn't good and overcooked to the point of being rock-hard so it was kind of a pain to eat. Usually he scarfs down his calzones quickly (it's his first choice at italian places), but we left with 3/4 of the calzone intact and I ended up having to toss it when I was cleaning out the fridge because he didn't eat the leftovers. \n\nAll in all, it wasn't a great meal.

The pizza arrived, we ordered half white sauce and half red sauce, one side ham and tomato the other ham and pineapple.  It was GREAT!

I would like to begin with informing you that my child is harmed on a weekly, or more basis. She has bruises in random places like her back thighs, scratches all over her face and arms, other kids pulling her hair and throwing her on the ground (I've seen this happen), and bite marks on her arms & back. I feel that there are too many children for 1 or two people to handle.\n\nI have walked in numerous times to several rooms to find my child and there is about 30 kids for 1 adult. I have asked if that is illegal and the director has said yes. This is an ongoing problem. My child is with the 3s and all of the teachers (Ms. Jenny and another Native American worker) look very overwhelmed with their duties with the amount of volume of kids they have to watch over. I pay tuition to have someone take good care of her and I finally withdrew her from the preschool. \n\nAlso, the main hallway is always wet an this can cause a child to slip and fall. One 11/7/2013, I told the front staff lady that was sitting on her chair and she did not do anything about it. I feel Shannon the director is over worked because she never has time to take a breath from what I can observe. She says she will take care of my concerns and my child still continued to get hurt.\n\nI have complained so many times about my child including the time when my child had to get x-rays from a BIG fall she had outside on the concrete. The last thing I want to complain about is that lately my child's ouchy reports have been concealed from me. She has gotten hurt twice this week and nobody has written an ouchy report. Maxwell preschool is clearly understaffed and they have too many kids and not enough eyes to watch them from hurting each other! \n\nThere are MANY ouchy reports on file with Maxwell that they give me EVERY SINGLE WEEK! I have taken photographs of some of the injuries my child has incurred while under the care of Maxwell Preschool. \n\nOther Info: My child has gotten hurt numerous times and I believe this should be filed with CPS to have them perform an investigation.

It seems that each person's experience is based on one, maybe two, departments that causes the entire hospital to get a bad review. That said, this review is for the Labor/Delivery and Postpartum wards.\n\nWe went in to be induced with our first child at 41.5wks. The initial process of getting signed in and settled into our room was okay. I hate that in order to even be admitted to a hospital these days you have to put in a down-payment. $2K is the baseline for admittance into L&D, which is insane, but it's not necessarily the fault of the hospital (thank you, insurance companies) and is a rant for a different forum.\n\nOnce into a room, our first nurse was nice enough, though a bit rough with the Cervadil (I won't go into detail here). We met Dr. Tamanaka, who was the on-call OB from the sister-office of our regular OB, Dr. Linnerson. He was quite nice and explained everything to us clearly and patiently. That was really our only interaction with him since we were admitted in the evening. \n\nCome morning, we met the next shift of nurses and were blown away with how nice and friendly they were. I think it helps that my husband and I are friendly, reasonable, and generally pleasant folk. We chit-chatted through the morning while waiting for the next phase of the induction process. Our primary nurse ended up having to transfer our care to another, since one of her other patients needed an emergency c-section, and was seriously bummed. Eventually, every nurse on the floor, including the supervisor, came in to see us, claiming that they had to meet the couple that had all the nurses so happy and relaxed. Anyway, the new nurse was equally lovely and I felt like I was surrounded by friends. \n\nI just realized I'm starting to write a novel, so I'll try to keep the rest of this brief! Our OB, Dr. Linnerson, came to break my water (I think I can leave a more detailed review about him on his office page, Contemporary Care for Women). Bottom line: they didn't jump straight to Pitocin, they gave me time for my labor to progress, and they let me labor how I wanted to. \n\nUltimately, when time came to deliver, I was disappointed at how unavailable the on-call OB seemed to be. He eventually showed, but our nurse definitely did most of the work. What I loved about the Dr: he let me \"catch\" my own baby and was super-cool about not announcing gender and leaving that for my husband. Excellent moment for us. \n\nFast-foward to the next day when we were transferred upstairs to the postpartum unit. Less-than-impressed, though there wasn't anything wrong with the way they did things. I actually think they were probably just great, but after the amazing experience we had in L&D, it seemed a little lackluster.\n\nFood: great quality, really tasty. The only bummer is the time-frame. Since it takes 45-60 minutes for them to deliver your food to you, you have to anticipate when you'll be hungry and what you'll want to eat. Ordering lunch an hour or so after eating breakfast is weird for me. \n\nAnd I think that'll do it. Loved L&D nurses, but Postpartum was meh. So I think 4-stars is fair.", "business_id": "Rm8jCL-8fbBAPtPpBJGu7Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-10-22", "type": "review"}

All in all the hospital is decent. \n\nThings I Liked:  the various areas with different themes such as the cow garden, the train garden, the froggy forest, Zen garden, etc.  The patients get to custom order their meals and it's actually very good, as is the made to order cafeteria food. The patient tracking system they have for the people in surgery. \n\nThings I disliked: There's no smoking allowed anywhere on property and the security is constantly patrolling looking to bust you smoking.

I asked for the Pico on the side. They brought green and red salsa with the burro (different from the one with the chips) I liked the green alot but not the red, I liked the chips' salsa better. The cook himself brought my plate out which was cool. But was a little put off when I asked for more chips and salsa. The server brought them. She was really nice, and the cook was probably just busy...\nOnce I started to eat the burrito I only put it down once before I finished it, it was that good lol.\nThe tea had a funny taste I drank my water instead. The have pepsi products  (dislike). \nI'll be back, and if you haven't been here you should definitely give it a try!", "business_id": "nBqXILuCGVZ4-aPuRKjCCg", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-10-28", "type": "review"}

The first time we decided not to go back.  They cram too many people on the course, which just makes the day drag along.\n\nThis time the course wasn't busy but when we get there we find out that they are over-seeding so tee-boxes can't be used, and that the carts could not leave the path.  And to top it off, no cart girl on a day it was 98 degrees.\n\nWow, that would have been important information when the reservation was made a week or two prior.  I went in a group of 9 (a group of 2, 4, and 3) for some birthday golf, which is the only reason I came back to this place.  We had 2 seniors behind the group that called to complain so from early on we had rangers busting our balls. \n\n Rather than try to get us to enjoy their miserable course and conditions, they decided to make it even more obvious that a group spending $200 ($28per person for a round) on golf and another $100 at the bar/restaurant on a Tuesday was not worth their time.  They should have been throwing vouchers and coupons at us to come back and apologizing for the conditions and the lack of notice but they didn't do that.  This place lacks even mediocre customer service.  They cater to the guys golfing with a senior discount.  If you are looking to have any fun (ie talking, socializing, smiling) and not take your golf so serious, go elsewhere.\n\nMemo to Dobson Ranch.  If you want us to take our golf as serious as a professional, start treating customers professionally, and have a respectable course.  I would prefer any of the several muni's in the area that give you twice the value, and twice the service.\n\nIcing on the cake is that hole 1 and 10 are right next to the range.  There is no net to keep the multitude of range balls from littering the course.  Do they care?  No.  Literally every place we took a shot from, the sprinkler went on.  This happened to both groups.  We think they were doing it on purpose (conspiracy? maybe), it was crazy how they would go on and off as we would get closer and farther away from them.  We had to run back to the cart several times to save phones/cameras.  The cherry on top was when I went in to get a cup of ice from the bartender after our round and she tried charging me 50 cents even though the guy she just replaced was giving them to us at no cost all day.", "business_id": "bRk44ShCT0osos-1xaTRyA", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-10-20", "type": "review"}

My wife always orders her wor wun tun soup if she feels like eating something soupy, since it is always pretty good and consistent.  I like Chinese beef stew (naunam) over noodles and this dish was pretty good too.  We also ate a little roast pork and some roast duck out of the take out containers but took most of the duck and pork home.  Why did I order so much duck and roast pork? -- Because my two dogs love this stuff.  I hand strip the meat off the duck bones and they gobble down the duck and roast pork for their dinner.

I know this place creates value out of what other people may be throwing away.  Aside from all the altruistic aspects of this business being green and finding use for waste, the reason I love Stardust Building Supply is because they have saved me $1000s of dollars.   There are basically two ways this place can help you:\n\nFIRST:\nIf you are tearing something down to update or replace and you need to get rid of the old stuff.  Although it still works, you know you cannot store it.....Most  tend to throw things away.   A few loads to the dump, can and does cost $100s, but you shouldn't!  Stardust will come and take half of your things and save you $100s in dump fees and you get a tax break!!!......REALLY!\n\nSECOND:\nIf you are building something:\n - a.  You need an in-home a dance studio and need a wall of mirrors, go to Stardust....pay $45 for your wall of mirrors instead of $2000.  \n - b.  New Cabinet doors.....Stardust.\n - c.  White Whirlpool microwave stopped working the day your warranty expired and don't want to pay $300 for a new one.  Get the exact same model a Stardust for a third.  \n - d.  Decided you should upgrade to 6 panel interior doors when it costs you less than $300 installed because of Stardust had them on the floor.  \n\nStardust takes requests too!  If they don't have what you want in inventory, they will put an astrick in the computer and call you when it does come in.....YES!!!\n\nI have used Stardust for all of the above scenarios, these are real stories for myself over the last few years.  Stardust seems to be run by handymen, so if you need a handyman for these projects, ask, and they may be able to refer you to someone who is reputable.        \n\nStardust is a great resource and I am truly excited about how and what they have to offer.

Her Katsu Don was wonderful and excellently seasoned. It  was that perfect sweet and soy taste with the egg keeping it all together over the rice. I took the safer route with the Katsu and was happily surprised by how moist the pork was and how crunchy the outside became. Best part, it wasn't oily. Even the rice was wonderful in my opinion.

It is VERY traditional and VERY good.  A tiny bit pricey, but not unreasonable.\nI find the service good.  The owner is quiet, but not unfriendly so anyone who says he is is itching for a fight!  He always remembers me and is always pleasant.  I go for lunch here ALL the time.  I like the maguro don or nagaochi (spelling probably) don.  Both are bowls of tuna rice w/ a small amount of sweet sauce on the side.  Like salty teriyaki or sweet soy.  Anyway, the maguro don has sliced raw tuna over the rice w/ nori and the nagaochi has diced raw tuna with green onion and nori over the rice.  Both come with miso and both rock.  Everyone has to try this dish at least once in their life.  It is very easy to eat, even if you are usually afraid of raw fish.\nThe katsu is also good and so is the udon.  Honestly, it's all good.  Try the combo, the yakitori is amazing.  To the guy who said shame on the couple for getting take out- that was probably me!  I get take out there all the time, because I eat there at least once a week, it's my McDonald's!  I even get take out for lunch and eat it at work, it's my favorite \"fast\" food.  He usually makes my lunches and dinners in about 5 minutes. It's always him and his wife.  I hear the signed walls are from Japanese ball players, but have not verified with the owner.

Oh wait, your grilled mackerel entree comes with salad, yakitori, gyoza, and edame (the menu said udon, but I wasn't complaining)?  Holy crap I would drive across Phoenix for this place, easily.\n\nThe deep fried yakitori is really something.  Is that tofu in the batter? \n\nThe air in the place is pretty greasy, but I'm willing to overlook such things when the food is that good.  \n\nThe Lady had the sukiyaki, which was ok, but very comforting.  Either way, she thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\nOk back to that mackerel.  I've typically approached it with reservation at most places, but considering that this place didn't seem like your typical Japanese place, I decided to order it.  After a small bite, I just pciked the whole thing up with my chopsticks and gnawed away.  Damn it was good... moist... nicely cured... and charred.  Beware, however, that there will be bones in the thing.  When I mentioned to the owner how hard it was to find such good mackerel, he replied, \"Thank you.... only Asian people eat that sort of thing.\"  I BAH!  Plenty of non-Asian people eat fish where the bones may still be in it!  Cure him of this misconception!\n\nSo yeah it's really hard to come across a place like this, let alone a place with really good mackerel.  For those who live in cities where the vast majority of Japanese places concentrate on sushi (like I do), definitely hit this place up if you find yourself in the area.

It doesn't look like much from the outside, and the interior looks 20 years old, but the food more than makes up for it. It's a mom + pop place run like a diner. From the outside it looks like it might be out of business, but it's not. The food is authentic (except the portions are American sized) and it is very affordable--particularly at lunch. You can eat a multi-course lunch for 5-6 bucks and leave full. Some of the dishes are not as good as others, but when you consider the price and amount of food, its not that big of a deal. The portions can be kind of ridiculous for Japanese food. The pricier dinner entrees are in the 10-15 dollar range and include all the extras mentioned by others (salad, miso soup, yakitori skewer, fried gyoza etc).

My wife's awful ramen came out a good 5 minutes before my katsu.

No \"Sorry\" or offer to replace the napkin (no napkins on the table despite the fast food type setting).\n\nJust really surly, unfriendly service.

Don't nitpick--try to do what they do all year round and see where your priorities are. \n\nAnyways, on to the food:\n\nGyoza: Very good! Perfectly pan-fried, flavorful, and not too oily.\n\nCurry Katsu over Rice: Delicious! I wish they put the pork katsu on top of the curry so that it doesn't lose some of the crisp sitting in the sauce. But it was delicious! The curry was thick and the proportion to the rice was perfect. \n\nTonkotsu Ramen: Definitely did not come with the typical ramen toppings like wakame, charsiu and bamboo. It came topped with Chinese cabbage and chicken. It was almost more like Chinese noodle soup haha. If I were to judge it as a ramen, it wouldn't be good. But as a noodle/soup dish, it was good.\n\nSoft Shell Crab roll: Okay, sushi is definitely not their strength. I would not order another roll from here. There was too much mayo (the presence of mayo was already odd), the sushi rice was not the right consistency, and the nori was soggy.

We ordered what we always order at our favorite Korean place which is the Bulgogi, and mushroom tofu soup.  I figured these are very popular dishes, and easy measuring sticks to compare different places.\n\nThey give complimentary salad which includes iceberg lettuce... and teriyaki sauce.  No thanks.  \n\nBulgogi:  Really wasn't good at all.  It was too thick, the onions were 100% raw and there was no flavor beyond intense onion and poorly bbq'd beef.  It should be THIN, and TENDER, and FLAVORFUL.  Failed in all aspects\n\nTofu Soup:  Server asked how spicy we wanted it, and we said normal.  Apparently that means zero spicy or just adding 3 jalapeno slices into the soup.  That's authentic right?  They also use a very runny type of tofu, not the more firm stuff I have and like at my other spot.  It really had the texture of egg whites.  In fact, it had the exact texture of the egg white that was also in the soup.  So it was just watery flavorless broth, with textureless tofu and textureless egg b/c it wasn't hot enough to properly cook the egg.  Factor in the tough mushrooms that were obviously re-hydrated and you have a very poor dish.  \n\nThey stiffed us bowls or plates, unless they expected us to reuse the salad bowls so we had to wait around for a while to ask for something to eat on.  They also brought the dishes out at different times which is bad form.  \n\nThe best and worst parts were actually the sides.  What the hell are those shrimp, and why are they on my table?  They were dis-gus-ting.  Kimchi didn't taste fresh, bean things weren't that good, bean sprouts were too mature to be good and the cucumber thing probably sat around too long and got soggy like cucumbers like to do.  The daikon kimchi was the only solid side.    \n\nMy go to place is Cho Dang in Chandler for my Korean BBQ.  It blows this place away on all levels.  Their meat is of much higher quality, they actually include stone rice with their soup, serve amazing sides, and the atmosphere is a lot less cafeteria like.   To top it off it is about $5 less for the same exact order, but with larger portions of sides, rice, and meals.\n\nReally isn't a whole lot of good to say about this place.  I'd give it 1.5 stars, not quite bad enough to get a 1, but certainly not good enough to simply earn a \"meh\" rating.  I actually started this review by giving them 2 stars but as I started writing I realized there really wasn't anything positive I took away from the experience.  Couldn't even get an iced tea refill for the last 10+ minutes we were there.  Guess I'll still have to drive 15 minutes down to Chandler rather than 5 minutes to Mesa for Hodori.", "business_id": "PX3e3qtBx_5VC3vqq47jpQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-11-16", "type": "review"}

Well, I guess before we find another Korean restaurant, if we really want Korean food, we just have to go back to Takamtsu again.", "business_id": "PX3e3qtBx_5VC3vqq47jpQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-09-21", "type": "review"}

He's a big Korean food fan, and he's shown before that he makes some pretty good food choices. So I was pretty excited about the potential for this place, especially considering that I hadn't found a Korean restaurant here in Mesa just yet.\n\nWe were all sat quickly at lunchtime. Considering that there were about 12 of us, that's pretty good (and the place was mostly full). Our server was very attentive and came back regularly to make sure that we had everything we needed.\n\nThe menu is extensive. There are all sorts of choices, and there are a lot of choices that really piqued my curiosity. At some point, I'll try some of the more exotic items, but on this particular visit, I kept it rather basic and had #63 (Mae Un Dalk Bulgogi, which is Korean BBQ chicken marinated in a spicy sauce). To start, we had a few orders of #49A (Goon Mandu, which is pan-fried potstickers). And of course, there was kimchi and a variety of other sides that come with the meal.\n\nThe potstickers were tasty. A little crunchy on the outside, and with some of the sauce that comes with them, quite good. I normally don't eat many potstickers, but I had 3 of these.\n\nThe chicken comes served with white rice--nothing special about it. The chicken was nicely done. The marinade was excellent! The spice level was perfect, and the flavor was really good. I definitely enjoyed it.\n\nBut as I have often found with Korean food, the stars of the show for me were the sides. The marinated cucumbers, the kimchi, the seaweed--all excellent, all with really great flavors. Best of all are those potatoes. I don't know what they use to flavor the potatoes, but they are great! I could eat a whole plate of those potatoes, but unfortunately, they come as a small side. I'm sure that I could have asked for more, but with the size of the chicken platter (lunch portion, mind you) and the potstickers to boot, I was quite full.\n\nTo finish off the meal, there's a little dessert that I believe is a probiotic drink. It has an interesting and good, albeit a little medicine-y, taste to it. Always nice to encourage good digestion at the end of a big meal!\n\nI'll be back.

As tasty as this fish was....and it was...this meal was almost impossible to eat because it was filled with hundreds of tiny bones. I don't think fish with this many bones should be on any menu anywhere. I do note the side dishes with kimchi, cucumbers and four other sides were tasty and mostly delicious. I thought they seemed above average. A better choice would have been the Black Cod with Radish but the price difference was just too much difference for lunch time. Mackerel was $13.99 and the black cod was something like $26.00. \n\nBack to service I wanted to ask questions about a few of the sides but nobody was able to check on us during the lunch.\n\nMy husband had the Kimchi Bokum Bap.(Ribeye in a hot stone pot with egg). We both thought the ribeye was tender and tasty but lacked any heat. I think some sort of hot Korean Sauce should have been given with this dish?\n\nThis is a place that I would re-visit but I do have some reservations about some of the dishes such as the mackerel and the lack of service. So for me that's three stars. Still a positive rating. \n\nI do note this was a holiday weekend and it's possible they might have been busier than expected and short on help.", "business_id": "PX3e3qtBx_5VC3vqq47jpQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-11-29", "type": "review"}

Both of us asked for the callus removal - knowing it was going to cost extra for this service.  The lady doing my pedi scrubbed my feet with the pumice stone but never brought out the metal callus removal tool.  My favorite part of a massage is the callus removal, I am pretty crazy about soft feet.  Twice I asked her if she heard me say I wanted the callus removal and she said yes.  As she was getting ready to start painting my nails I clarified again - and she said she had already done the callus removal with the pumice.  I asked if she would use the metal tool and she said no, they were the same thing.  I said in the past I had the other tool, pointed to it, and explained that I really liked it.  She said \"the stone was new\" and just the same. In the mean time my mom had both the pumice stone and the other metal tool used.  The two ladies sitting next to her who also asked for calls removal also had both tools used.  I've gone to this salon before and not requested the callus removal and at the bare minimum the pumice was used, always at no extra charge.  I didn't even no how to argue with her at this point since I had asked/clarified so many times. After a long summer in flip flops I really needed this service done.  I've had mediocre service at this salon before and won't be returning in the future, even though it's only a half a mile from my house.

I opened an account at Compass Bank back in NM in 2002. Don't ask me why I kept the stupid account for so long...I suppose I thought it was better than some of the alternatives (BofA or Wells). Of the many many many things about Compass that irk me, the biggest is how they balance your account every day and their funds availability policy. Here's a real life example that has happened more than once:\nI get a direct deposit on Friday, it shows up on my AVAILABLE balance first thing Friday morning. On Thursday I had $20 left in my account, but with my direct deposit on Friday morning, I now have several hundred dollars in my available balance. I go to the gas station and the grocery store, spend $25 at one, $60 at the other. Monday rolls around and I'm hit with 2, yes two overdraft fees for $27 each. I go into the bank to inquire as to why and I'm told that I overdrew my account on Friday. \"No, I had a direct deposit hit my account Friday morning and show in my AVAILABLE balance before I ever went to the gas station or the grocery store\". \"Yes, but we take all charges out of your account before crediting any deposits at the end of the day\". \"Then why did my AVAILABLE balance show that I had several hundred dollars if it was not AVAILABLE to me?\". \"Because it doesn't get credited to your account until all the charges have been taken out\". \"But why?\". \"Because that is the way we do it because we're greedy @$$H0^&$\". Okay...so I made that very last one up...but this is essentially the way any conversation goes when they've wrongfully taken your money, and good luck getting it back. I finally just gave up. When I went to another branch to close my account, the banker asked why, I told her that in the 6 years I'd been banking with Compass, the customer service had consistently gotten worse. She then asked if I'd like to air my greivances then and there, and I wasn't about to go through it all again and get the lecture about how I should balance my checkbook...yada yada yada.\nI've worked at banks. I know how to balance my checkbooks and keep track of spending. I also know that at other banks, if your account says you have an available balance based on a direct deposit, you don't have to wait until the next business day to use those funds.\nDo yourself a favor...don't bank with Compass.", "business_id": "E13puj01cJq7X5gNU7kVWQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2007-10-11", "type": "review"}

I certainly wouldn't call it a \"beautiful\" resort either.... and what makes a resort a resort?\nThis place is just what it is.... a motel. \n\nI don't smoke and there is a $300 charge if they catch you smoking in a room but...... people were smoking outside the rooms and the smoky aroma wafted in the night I was there. \n\nThe motel is old point blank. the air vents are full of dust but that happens no biggie. The room was fairly clean and you can tell they are trying to improve the place. It just wasn't worth what I spent. I would rather spend $40 more and spend the night in a nicer more updated place. The lighting is not the best either.\n\nWhat got me riled up was the mold problem in the shower. I do understand that a little mold happens but once the room was all moist the mold really showed up. I have a severe allergy to mold and this wasn't a good thing. \n\nI wouldn't say i would never stay there again but for the price I would pay a little more and stay somewhere more updated.\n\nThis place needs a major inside renovation. remove all the old interior walls and update the materials. there are products that help to eliminate mold issues now days. The outside is nice. but still could use a little more TLC.\n\nThey did have flat screen tv's and working air conditioning.\nThey did not have complimentary breakfast anywhere I could see.\nI could not access any wifi.", "business_id": "CscJ0RubTHofHvRJhERvXQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-10-12", "type": "review"}

The inflection in his voice was as if to say, \"I'm not going to help you, I don't care to help you, and can't you seem I'm busy with whatever I'm doing.\"  He reminded me of a disrespectful punk 12 year old kid being immersed in his gaming and blowing off his parents invite to join them at the table. \n\nSo, when he first said the other woman can help me, the couple was still standing in front of her.  I think they had asked another question, but regardless, they were still there.  He said it again with the same nasty tone.  At this point I barked back him telling him I don't care for his attitude, and second, I was standing right there, I'm fully aware of what's going on.

It used to be that US Egg owned my heart with its patented oatmeal-blueberry-almond wheat pancakes until I tried Good Egg's blueberries and glazed pecans (double toppings, please!) pancakes made with whole-wheat batter, and a little whipped butter on the side, hold the syrup.  If I feel like a little pain (food allergies) with my pancakes, I'd order them with special granola topping.  It is quite tasty!  However, it's heaven on earth for me with the blueberries and pecans.\n\nThe Isle of Capri omelette is delicious, as well.  The capers, sundried tomatoes, and feta cheese give the egg-y delight a slightly, uh, for the lack of a better word, funky aroma, but it tastes so good!  The side of country potatoes, while a bit salty, is equally yummy (can you guess which pieces I like best?).  I hear the guacamole and bacon that come with many dishes are very good, too.  I also recommend the reuben panini... oh my goodness!  I just experienced multiple shudders up and down my spine... bet you didn't know women could have those!  LOL.  Speaking of orgasm-inducing foods, has anyone else had a Smokey Forest sandwich at Duck and Decanter??\n\nBTW, I tried ordering the pancakes here ala US Egg, with oatmeal and almond toppings, but they weren't the same.  I prefer US Egg's version; however, I'm a sucker for those loyal customer punch cards, and, on certain days, Good Egg even offers double punches!  Suh-weet!\n\nP.S.  I've tried four locations [Thomas/Central, Ray/Rural, Dobson/S of 60, and McDonald/Scottsdale Rd (?)] and I prefer those on Thomas and Dobson when it comes to good to great service.  The servers there really shine on customer service and the few complaints my party and I had to give were met with sympathetic ears and satisfactory amendments by both servers and management (local and headquarters).  I wish I could say the same for those on Ray and McDonald.\n\n---UPDATE!---\nYou ever hear of those who like cold pizza?  Well, I never was one of those people.  I've tried it a couple of times, but I just don't get it [and I refuse to try it again, 'cause frankly, it's a waste of a good pizza... I'd rather resurrect it again to it's former (but not quite) glory by popping it in the toaster oven].  I have, however, found that I LIKE cold blueberry and glazed pecan whole wheat pancakes out of the fridge!  And guess what?  They're so good, they don't even need butter!  Hmm... it's a texture-lover's dream... cakey, and those sweet, almost preserve-like blueberries- some macerated, others still whole- and then those crunchy pecan bits!", "business_id": "8aPTQeDYOMNEu907WfflCQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-10-24", "type": "review"}

I've been frequenting several of the Good Egg/ Eggery locations for many years now and it's amazingly consistent. I'm just throwing the review down for this location since I make it here more than the others now, and I was here Sunday afternoon. \nI always get the same item regardless of what location I'm at: the three cheese omelet with bacon which comes with the addictive country potatoes and an English muffin. It's perfect every single time! I can only remember one out of a few dozen times that it was a little too greasy. Besides that, it's admirable how consistent they are with the quality of their food. Then this past Sunday my lady got the biscuits and gravy and I had the distinct pleasure of trying that for the first time...so so good. Plus I'm an iced tea junkie and the Good Egg has some of the best in town. \nI use to have issues with slow service at some Good Eggs, but the Dobson location rarely has that issue. It was usually the Frank Lloyd Wright location that had horrendously slow service. But I think that was more the fault of management mishandling staff as opposed the servers. \nPlus, who doesn't love the unintentional hilarity of the hokey interior design of the Good Egg? It's like they had members of a retirement center do the interior decorating...I love it. \nSo all in all, due to the quality and consistency of the food, I'll still take the Good Egg over any newer, trendier breakfast places that I've tried (I'm looking at you, Over easy).", "business_id": "8aPTQeDYOMNEu907WfflCQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-11-25", "type": "review"}

I've been going here for several years for my yearly eye exams, however the last year has been the worst customer service experience I've ever received.\n\nBack In January I needed to have my yearly exam and order new contacts. I was wearing CIBA Focus Night and Days at the time. Without informing me of the brand change the lady at the counter ordered me CIBA Air Optix Night and Day contact lenses.\n\nI had a lot of problems with these new contact lenses, so I went back for a follow up visit. The lady at the counter told me she could order me my old contacts and would call me when they came in. Two weeks later and no call, I finally called them back. When I came to pick up my supposedly older contacts, I found out they had ordered me the Weekly colored contacts. She assured me they were just like the older contacts.\n\nThe new weekly contacts were better than the Air Optix, but were still leaving my eyes dry and scratchy. I went back for another paid follow up visit. This time she supposedly ordered me different contacts. Two week later, and after not receiving another call back, I called them again. No one had ordered my trail contact lenses! I waited another two weeks for the lenses to come in. This time I was called back. (I was shocked), however the new contacts were the CIBA Air Optix!!!\n\nAfter going back for Another follow up exam to explain all the issues I've been having the doctor suggested it might be seasonal allergies causing the problems and prescribed me some drops. I have never had allergies in my life, but I ordered the prescription anyways. The drops didn't help my eyes one bit and were a waste of money.\n\nI finally went online and did some research. A lot of people have been having problems with the switch from the Focus Night and Days to the Air Optix Night and Days. I scheduled ANOTHER follow up exam and tried to explain the problems again. The doctor didn't believe my story and didn't even let me finish explaining anything. She suggested I try the Acuvuve 2 contact lenses. I figured anything was better than the Air Optix.\n\nThese trial pairs were worse than the Air Optix. I tried calling back to see about getting another brand of trails. The gentleman on the phone told me he would call me back. Of course he didn't call me back.\n\nI will never use Sears Optical again. The customer service is just flat out rude. They don't care about your problems and are more interested in making a buck, then getting you the right product. Don't expect a phone call back. They also don't care about their customers. I've interacted with all of their staff and they ALL don't care to here about my eye problems. Even the doctor doesn't care. I got halfway through explaining what was going on, and she cut me off. She hurried me out of her office as fast as she could. Not to mention shes never heard of anyone having problems with the new Air Optic contact lenses.\n\nDo the smart thing and take your business else where!

He referred me to see a rheumatologist.\n\nSwarup & I got off on the wrong foot right away. I mentioned that I was considering a hysterectomy and that I would prefer to avoid having to do it if possible. I told her about my family history with psoriatic arthritis. And that I had read that there have been studies on TNF- inhibitor class drugs (such as Enbrel and Humira) which suggest that they might also help endometriosis. I concluded that I would like to wait on the hysterectomy to see what type of arthritis I had, and to see what the treatment was going to be, and that *IF* the treatment ended up being something like Enbrel or Humira, and *IF* if it ended up also helping my endometriosis, I might be able to avoid the hysterectomy.\n\nWhen I finished speaking, she basically laughed in my face. Literally, out loud, and said, \"I'm not going to put you on Enbrel for endometriosis.\"\n\nI was stunned. The way I explained it above was exactly what I said to her. I tried to re-explain--I hadn't asked her to do that, and I was here for her to figure out my arthritis situation (which x-rays proved I had). She just kept looking at me with this \"you're off your rocker\" expression as I spoke, so I immediately realized nothing I was saying was getting through to her.\n\n(I'm not off my rocker--there ARE studies that have look at how TNF- inhibitors interact/affect endometriosis, for example: http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/9/2417.full)\n\nSince there's a shortage of Rheumatologists in this area, and since it takes forever to get in, I stuck with Swarup as we tried to work through diagnosis.\n\nHowever, throughout my appointments, Swarup continued to regard everything I said with incredulity, including my descriptions of my symptoms, and my reports as to medication efficacy.\n\nAt one point, she stated unequivocally that my foot pain was from plantar plantar fasciitis--despite the symptoms being incorrect, and my risk factors being very low. I didn't have, nor have I ever had, plantar fasciitis.\n\nI finally stopped seeing her in 2013 due to loss of insurance. We never completed the diagnosis process.\n\nFast forward to 2015, and 6 weeks or so ago, I tried to make an appointment with another doctor at Arizona Arthritis & Rheumatology Associates (Swarup's practice), because Swarup and I did not have good report. I was told that I could not make an appointment with another doctor within the practice because I was established with Swarup. I asked if they could please ask Swarup for special permission. Swarup refused. She \"advised\" me to find another rheumatologist outside of the practice. I told them that this was difficult to do--of the 30-some-odd rheumatologists in my area covered by my insurance, **15** of them are at that practice. And, wait-times for new patient appointments are ridiculously long.\n\nSo I said I'd just stick with Swarup and try to work things out with her. I made an appointment that was about 6 weeks out. It was the soonest she had available for a \"new patient\"--I was being treated as a new patient because I hadn't seen her in almost two years. Which is interesting, considering I'm a \"new patient\" but I wasn't allowed to start fresh with a different doctor in the practice. Contradiction, much?\n\nSo I wait my 6 weeks, and then...\n\nOn THE DAY of my appointment, they call to tell me that my appointment has been cancelled because I had requested to see a different doctor, and that she had told me to find a doctor outside of the practice!!!\n\nOk... So, why did they allow me to make the appointment in the first place?\n\nAnd WHY did they wait until 2 hours before my appointment to tell me it was cancelled, when they could have any time in the previous 6 weeks?\n\nNow I have to find a new doctor, and wait another few months in terrible pain.\n\nSTAY FAR, FAR AWAY FROM AREENA SWARUP.

It is the Village Inn.  Let me explain...  I had just finished an hour long torture session at Mesa Community College's track/playing fields with a group of friends. (1) We were Hungry (hungry with a capital \"H\").   None of us live in Mesa.  No Yelp due diligence had been completed on the area.  Someone mentioned seeing an IHop at the corner of Dobson and Southern.  Done.  We get there. My heart sinks.  It is not an IHop.  It is a Village Inn.  \"Oh no,\" I thought secretly to myself, \"NOT the Village Inn.\" (2)  But the collective decision had been made.  The group charged in.  Five minutes later, we were seated in a large u-shaped booth.  There were crumbs on the seat and little hand prints all over the mirror behind us.  Children were here before us.  A busboy promptly cleaned up the mess.  By this point, my expectations could not have gotten any lower.  I scanned the menu in despair thinking, \"That sounds good, but can it be properly executed at a Village Inn?\"  Our server, Danny D. arrived.  He greeted us with much enthusiasm and a genuine smile.   He began taking orders, making his way around the table.  By the time he got to me, I was still at a loss.  I looked at him and stated, \"I have a problem with the menu.\"  \"Okay... what's the problem.\"  \"Nothing is quite what I want.\" I describe the breakfast that I do want, a veggie omelet with real eggs, buttermilk pancakes, and fruit on the side. (3)  \"No problem.  We can do that.\"  My mood brightened.  After about 10 minutes the food arrived.  It looked pretty good.   And then I took a bite.  The eggs were light and fluffy, good veggie to omelet ratio, just the right amount of cheese, and piping hot.  Somewhat stunned, I stated, \"Wow, this is actually really good.\"  My friends look similarly stunned.  My feelings were echoed.  \"Yeah, my food is really good too.\"  \"Me too.\"  \"Me too.\"  \"This is fantastic.\"   \"My taste buds are so happy right now.\" To top it all off,  Danny D. was a total rock star server, circling back to bring extra condiments, more napkins, and fresh coffee throughout the meal, and always with a palpable sense of brightness and cheer.  Maybe it was a fluke experience.  Maybe we were all so hungry that dog food would have tasted good? But then again, maybe not.  Maybe this Village Inn is just a diamond in the rough?  Only time will tell.  \n\n(1) See my review regarding Iron Gloves Boxing located in Tempe, Arizona for more information.  \n\n(2)  My experience with this particular chain has not been good.  I have bad memories of going to a Village Inn in Albuquerque with my grandparents and being forced to eat rubbery inedible scrambled eggs. Sometimes with hair.\n\n(3)  The veggie omelet is a \"healthy\" menu item.  Ordered standard, it is made with egg substitute and served with whole grain pancakes.", "business_id": "dbh72sNyNeHUgJqQye9Vbg", "stars": 3, "date": "2007-10-21", "type": "review"}

So we mapped out our chores for the day and found a Village Inn along our path.\n\nOur waiter was very friendly and helpful, but obviously frazzled.  He helped me narrow down our choices by answering our questions about the menu.  I ordered 2 eggs, hash browns, sausage and rye toast.  The husband ordered a sausage skillet.

What a concept!! And not just brown on the top. Nooo, these babies were browned on both sides. Crispy, yummy and BROWN hash browns.  And I didn't ask for them to be cooked that way.  Every other restaurant in Arizona does such a pisspoor job of browning hash browns, that I've completely given up on asking for my potatoes to be done \"dark.\"  I usually end up with a plate of mushy potato shreds dripping with butter substitute.  Gross. I've come to the point that I ignore that the potatoes are even there.\n\nBut before my very eyes is a plate with the potatoes cooked just right, eggs exactly how I asked them to be cooked, tasty sausage links and two thick pieces of marble rye.  That's a lot of food when you plan on actually eating the potatoes.\n\nMy husband was equally pleased with his skillet.

WTF?\n\nMy bad for sharing my fave place with you, but good for the owners! :) Next time I'll have to just move my happy butt a lot faster to get there.\n\nI found Nationwide Beauty Supply purely by accident...and it is far better organized than Hollywood Beauty Supply. It's also newer and less cluttered. Still not wheelchair friendly, but I think a person in a wheelchair has a better chance of getting into the doors than at Hollywood Beauty Supply.\n\nLet me start off with the best pro of them all: They had the entire range of the Christmas collection colors of China Glaze. They had the suede collection from ORLY and OPI. They had such a wonderful selection of the holiday OPI I nearly had a heart attack and died from a nail polish induced hysteria.\n\nThere I was, with 25 bottles of nail polish - my girlfriends and I usually text each other when we get to places like this and ask each other what colors we want/have/don't have/will get/want to get/MUSTHAVE. You understand, right? :)\n\n15 bottles of China Glaze and 10 bottles of OPI... $135.00\n\nI nearly died. It was my fault - I honestly should have asked for the price before dumping everything into my basket. I saw the colors and what could I say? Blinded by the nail polish light. Truly, my bad.\n\nI used to walk about of Hollywood Beauty Supply with 30 bottles of nail polish for a little over $100...and that's all OPI.\n\nTurns out that my bottles of OPI cost me $6 each (at HBS it's $3.50) and China Glaze cost $5.00 (HBS sells for $2.50).\n\nIn total humiliation, I put back ALL the colors. I was so embarrassed. But honestly, I was prepared to spend max $110 for all the bottles. $130 was way out of my price range for what I was willing to spend.\n\nThe man was nice about all of it, but I could tell he was seething underneath it all. I would be, too. At least I put the polishes back in their correct displays.\n\nLong story short, if you're wanting affordable nail polish with the newest and hottest colors of the season, you can come here but be prepared to pay the price. If you want the same thing, but are willing to slap a ho/cut a bitch, go to Hollywood Beauty Supply...your wallet and credit card will thank you.\n\nIf you want to check it out for yourself, Nationwide Beauty Supply is in the new Mekong Plaza Marketplace...I think that's why it's so pricey - they've got to pay their rent.", "business_id": "Q_lBAysdntSb4ySUtMpoDw", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-10-13", "type": "review"}

The amount of food you get for the money is almost criminal.\n\nAt the time when I was frequenting Golden Canyon most often we would see the owners often enough that she always spent time chatting with us and made the extra effort to learn our names and get to know us. I even invited her to my wedding! This is the type of business owner that communities need! \n\nBeyond that though, the food is consistently great and I have never had a terrible experience. It's not exactly fine dining but it is mouth-wateringly good Chinese food on a very small budget.", "business_id": "CuYHDItnOSfSlPfPDA9Btw", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-09-07", "type": "review"}

They were so big you had to eat them with a fork because picking them up to dunk them in their deep red, rich sweet and sour sauce looked a bit clumsy.\n\n-Shared Broccoli Chicken or beef with meat so tender it defined what \"melt in your mouth\" meant to me as I had never had meat like that before.  The broccoli was perhaps overcooked to some people's standards, but again, for a kid with picky vegetable tastes, it was always perfect for me.  I still like my broccoli well done and soft.\n\n-Fried rice that was a hearty dark brown, not this orange or yellow pale color you find at most places.  It was filled with egg, peas, carrots, onion, and bean sprouts.  Amazing.\n\nIn my 20s I took my boyfriend to Golden Canyon and we both discovered their huge crab puffs that was just full of crab and not just a fried cream cheese puff.  These went with the fantastic sweet and sour sauce perfectly.\n\nAs an adult, my tastes expanded so I discovered that their tender chicken was also found in their lightly fried Lemon Chicken as well and the lemon sauce tasted unreal with their fried rice.\n\nI haven't lived in the Mesa area now for about 11 years and I'm not entirely sure how long it's been since I've been able to make my way over there, but tonight I found myself in the area and went to pick up some take out.  Knowing I wouldn't most likely be back for a long time, I decided to pick up two meals so I'd have some leftovers and could drag out my enjoyment.\n\nI was looking forward to tasting all of my old favorites and this is what I found:\n\n-Wonton soup with a dark, rich broth with pale leafy bok choy and small wontons with very little meat inside.\n\n-Egg rolls half the size that they used to be, sad skinny things with a poor balance of dough to filling.  And I don't know where the nutmeg went, but it's not in here.  and their dark red sweet and sour sauce is now a brownish orange.\n\n-Tiny crab puffs with a faint trace of crab.\n\n-Broccoli beef that was as tender as I remember, with far more garlic than any dish should ever have.  And I'm Italian... I love garlic.\n\n-Dark, flavorful fried rice... absent of peas, carrots, and sprouts... and very little egg.\n\n-Lemon chicken with one full breast of chicken.... with no breading. NONE. And additional breast pieces from another breast with very light breading, that wasn't anything like the previous kind of breading.\n\nI am so disappointed that the food I loved for over 20 years is just gone at this point.  It's clear that while raising their prices (which of course I'm fine with, I understand inflation) they also removed most of their high quality ingredients and minimized their portions.  \n\nThat being said, the meal, overall (except the lemon chicken) was still better than most places that deliver.  The wonton soup's broth outdoes anyone elses that I've had over here in Chandler.  The sweet and sour sauce, though different than what I remember, was still rather tasty.  The meat is still tender, not that tough garbage you find so often and similar places.  If you live nearby, I'd say this is a good option for a decent Chinese meal.   Which is why I gave it 3 stars.\n\nI won't recommend the crab puffs at all.  They were wimpy, crabless, and too sweet.  The fried rice still had a great flavor, but I really miss the other ingredients. My biggest disappointment has been the eggrolls.  Raising the price and cutting the portion in half is a low thing to do to customers and honestly it makes me not even want to go back myself because I feel cheated.  It's the part of the meal I was most looking forward to only to find the skinny, poor excuse for an eggroll in the bag.\n\nI won't likely return again, after over 20 years of loving this place so much, I'm a bit disillusioned by this new reality.  Perhaps I'll check the reviews again in a few years and see if anyone has noted any improvement, but otherwise... I bid you farewell...

I always sit in the separate sitting are with the counter (and booths that hold 2 peope).\nTypically my food is excellent. Wait staff service is iffy on how fast it is, and if your coffee is refilled.  Wait staff are long timers and good, but the place seems to be short staffed all the time.\nEvery time you check out--in my experience--there is a line at the register--it's either not staffed or the person is in efficient.\nOn Sunday it took 20 min to check out and pay.  And it was the Coco's lady at the counter--not the customers.  The pie orders are very manual and take a long time.  The lady here today did not know how to process a coupon for the customer in front of me--she had to call a manager to authorize it.  She was also answering callers from outside--who were ordering those slow manual pie orders.  The line was still stacked up to 8 behind me (like it was when I got in line).

The assistnt manager that looks to be on duty, can help refill coffee and stuff, but moslty he's a little oafy in handlign his apparently new duties or fill-in duties at this restaurant--though people seem to know him--he is not very efficient at makign the restaurant run efficiently.  The wait staff seem to tolerate him, no appreciate where he does try to insert himself--I find him not a good manager.  \n\nTHis is symptomatic of my 3 visits the past month.\n\nI orderd pumpkin nut pancakes--very good--exctite that serving of \"pumpkin chiffon\" that seems to be flavored butter, but tastes like thick gross frosting that is pumpkin flavored.  It did not melt on the pancakes and was intolerable.", "business_id": "1DDTdvU06tng7o0vU7-rig", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-11-19", "type": "review"}

I was in a moderate amount of pain, and it was becoming more and more uncomfortable for me.  I normally don't get massages because A) I don't normally need them, and B) thier expensive.  Its more of an occasional treat for me.  This was neccessary due to the pain that I was in and it wouldn't go away on its own.\n\nI came here because they have multiple locations throughout the valley, have long hours and and I am familiar with who they are.  I called Friday afternoon and made an appt for Friday evening. I was thrilled with the fact that I was able to get something quick, as I didn't want  to wait 2 or 3 days for an appt....I wanted one today, which I was able to get.  The downside was, I found the phone conversation awkward with the guy that took my call and appt.  I had some general questions, and even though he was polite, I found it to be awkward.\n\nAnyways, I got to the appt early as instructed and filled out some paperwork.  The staff were helpful, polite and nice.  They tried to sell me thier $49 a month massage membership a few times, but were really not aggressive about it, which I appriciate. I don't want to be a member and pay prices for something that I don't need/want/use all that often.\n\nAnyways, the massage was great!  Logan gave me a really great rub down and worked out all the kinks on my back, neck and shoulders.  The kid really seems to know what he was doing.  I would see him again if I came back to this specific location, and it was worth what I paid.  I can now move in comfort, and not wake up with back spasms and serious cramps like I have been for the past few weeks.\n\nIn the end, I had a good experience.  The Pros: Great hours, multiple locations, with a variety of massages to help you with whatever your ailing from.  The cons: after the first visit the price of a massage skyrockets if you dont join thier club.\n\nI would gladly come here again,  and had an overall great experience.

Although the evening started out crummy, the manager was really great and brought us out an appetizer platter on the house.  The food was good and the bread sticks hit the spot.", "business_id": "scVOmQsf5HSY3n9CG06tFA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-11-20", "type": "review"}

I am bound to offend some of you \"Chain restaurant\" haters but here goes... \nOlive Garden has become the brunt of many jokes over the years and even had a clever and hilarious skit done on Mad TV years ago. The main complaint I have heard time and time again is that the food is not \"authentic.\" No comments about the food being bad or bland, just that its not \"authentic.\" Ok I will agree that the food may not be \"authentic\" from my perspective of what Italian food should be. My grandfather was 100% Italian and I ate much of his Italian food growing up. That is what I consider \"authentic\" Italian food to be. Here's the thing though... I have never been to Italy and I am sure that most of the people complaining about OG's authenticity havn't been either. So who are we to know that its not authentic in some area of Italy? I am fairly sure its not and you can bet that when I do visit Italy inside and out (which will hopefully be in the next year), I will be yelping another review on the OG just to say if it is indeed \"authentic.\"\nOne thing I can vouch for with Olive Garden is that most of the items I have tried there are delicious and their bread-sticks are like crack! Sure sure, laugh and knock me as much as you want but I know that everyone that has had OG likes at least one thing. You can slam OG but you have either liked their bread-sticks, soup, salad, or some kind of entree. Anyways, to address the point I am trying to make: a good restaurant (chain or not) should have good food and I can say that Olive Garden does have good food. Their soups are delicious (try the chicken gnocchi or the zuppa Tuscana), the bread-sticks are light, airy and buttery with the right amount of garlic flavor, and although the salad is nothing special vegi wise, the dressing is one of the better Italian dressings out there and is very refreshing. For entrees, they make the one of the best eggplant Parmesans and fettuccine Alfredos I have ever had, the stuffed chicken Marsala is unique but delicious, and their seafood portifino is rich and creamy with a generous amount of perfectly cooked seafood. The desserts are equally as delicious, my favs being the apple crostada and the black tie mousse cake. \nThe service has always been decent although you may get an occasional slow waiter. However, I can say that most times I walk away satisfied with the overall experience. The price and value is terrific too. Come on, how many other \"Italian\" places you know of where you can get bread, salad/ soup, and big bowl of pasta for less then 15.00? Not very many, that's for sure!\nMy only complaints: Too family friendly and sometimes there are screaming kids, however, with a few bowls of  delicious soup and pasta, I can sometimes manage to drown it out. Also, years ago, I ordered nothing but their cannelloni al forno (pasta tubes filled with meat and topped with cheese, Alfredo and marinara sauce). My precious dish was taken away from me and replaced with \"three meat ravioli\" which was close so I kept getting that. Then that was removed from the menu. I started getting \"classics\" after that that I was sure would not be removed from the menu like eggplant parm. But for dessert, I fell in love with their chocolate molten cake with vanilla cream and strawberries. Guess what happened? Yep, it was taken away from me  :(  I have also heard numerous complaints about how a special one month will be terrific but a month later, its no longer available and is never to be seen again. I wish the OG would stop replacing good meal items and also bring back some of the popular past specials so people can enjoy them again. I also wish that one of those specials will be the cannalloni al forno. If that was the case, I would go there for a month straight and order it. OG, stop changing out good menu items. After all, if it aint broke, don't fix it!", "business_id": "scVOmQsf5HSY3n9CG06tFA", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-10-29", "type": "review"}

I don't know why, but I really like establishments with the word monkey in the name. Tickles me pink at an adolescent level, like nut shots and fireworks. So Uncle Monkey's Bar started off at an advantage. \n\nIt's definitely a dive bar, so don't go in there expecting something fancy schmansy. It's got monkey in the bar name, people. That should pretty much tell you everything you need to know about what awaits you inside.\n\nCash only, cheap alcohol (11 bucks for three shots of Jameson, and one fifty well!), stiff drinks, pool tables, and a decent jukebox.

It's dark, weathered, kinda dingy and it exists for the express purpose of getting' you loaded, and the patrons reflect this fact by looking a little frayed around the edges as well.\n\nThe one issue I had with the place is the fact that it's hidden away in the corner of a non-descript strip mall with no sign on the front, so if you don't know about this place, you're unlikely to be finding yourself sharing a drink with the yokels.", "business_id": "hi5xfV28jsGBRWJWoBhDaw", "stars": 3, "date": "2007-09-17", "type": "review"}

Its part of a market/grocery store as everyone else has already noted. Its a little hidden, and I think that hurts this place a little bit.\n\nAnyways, the food is VERY good. The chicken shawarma is probably some of the best I have ever had. Hummus, yellow rice, and couscous also go very well with the food. There is the garlic-butter sauce that comes with the shawarma and kabobs, and that REALLY makes the food that much better. Gyro plate is also very commendable, but its hard to get this wrong since the gyro comes on a huge slab and rotates on a rotisserie. Yet, a lot of places do get the gyro plate wrong. I think this place does a good job of heating up the gyro meat on the rotisserie and then the grill.\n\nBaklava also deserves a mention. Its damn good. You can get some exotic mediterranean stuff like olives and feta cheese by the pound, i love that stuff.\n\nThe pricing of this place along with the good quality food makes this place a hidden gem. Its like $8 for almost any plate you'd want. Its plenty of food per plate, and for under $20 for 2 people, its worth a visit. Its very easy to compare this stuff to haji baba, its a tough pick. However, I think the hummus here tastes much better, it doesn't taste like its straight out of a can. The plates here I think are a better deal.

I am a huge fan of middle eastern cuisine and I was surprised they had one of my favorites, kafta, on the menu. The kofta here is great it gets a nice light char from the grill on the outside but is still juicy and tender on the inside. I love it. The fact that the platter is only $8 and comes with rice, hummus and salad is a deal I can't pass up.\n\nThose who know me know that I am picky on what hummus I enjoy since i have been making my own for almost 20 years. The hummus here is the rare exception to my normal rule that I don't like the super smooth and creamy hummus. I am not sure what exactly it is but I like it here.\n\nFor lunch I usually get the tabouli instead of the salad as my second side. It's really fresh and has a nice bite to it. I usually mix it with some hummus and apply to pita bread as the flavors work well together.\n\nAs for other things on the menu I have sampled most of their range of baklava thanks to the great yelp check in deal they had. I really liked the walnut but usually I will just look into the case and point at whatever looks good. That plan hasn't left me disappointed yet so I think I will stick with it. For entree's the chicken shwarma is my second favorite, the garlic sauce really makes this dish; the beef shawarma is pretty tasty but I have a hard time passing over the chicken for this one.\n\nThe staff is friendly and I can't find a negative thing to say about this place.

I asked around and everyone I spoke with said that I should cancel the order because of the price! So I did. I heard of a place in Scottsdale called Lesco. I was in there for 15 minutes. Found 2 pair that I LOVED & the service was 5 star. I spent only $109 (single vision frames are $30 w/ lenses.. My second pair they added anti glare for around $80... Total price coming to $109) I will never go anywhere else to purchase frames! And I would refer all of my friends to Lesco for their frames as well!

I am from Michigan and sorry to say am I big Lions fan. I gave my bar up per our weekly switch-off(as a true loving couple would do) to come here weekly, that's how fun it is.\n\nThe owners Steve and Renee will remember you name and maybe your order if you tip well. Great people that provide a no frills good time.\nNo food other than 2 pizza choices, a true Minnesota bar, during the games they have a pot luck. Yes, you bring something and have Renee set it up in the back. You can expect all the northern favorites; chili, pickle roll-ups, chicken wings, cheese trays, lil smokies etc.\n\nBooze, super cheap!!(cash only, atm onsite)\nGreat Beer selection, lot of local and national crafts along with norms. Great choices for you mixed drinkers out there also.\n\nIf you are coming for a Football Sunday, they do have the package, but only 5 TVs. Yes, you read that correct. Place can only hold 100 people according to the sign on the wall. But 4 at least will be on the Vikings game, if you're lucky and catch Steve in a good mood he may put one (above the jukebox) on your game (no sound). With that being said if your team is playing against the Vikings, it's also a good time.\n\nAll around a great place with great people, so happy we found this place, we found friends for life!", "business_id": "rjjEN8QTMvilB08ImFyMow", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-11-20", "type": "review"}

I'm normally not a fan of the traditional white wine sauce on this dish but Golden Gate's is very nice.  The scallops were done just right, melt in your mouth.  The crab also was tender and cooked just right with no taste of fishiness.  The shrimp was slightly overdone but still very good.  The house special chicken was a whole chicken breast dipped in a thin coating and deep fried, then sliced and placed over a small serving of vegetables.  The chicken was very tender and flavorful with a robust brown sauce.\n\nMy daughter had chosen the restaurant for her birthday dinner and they must have heard us mention it because after the meal they brought out fried dough pockets filled with banana and sprinkled with confectioners sugar.

Every choice was well received although the crab angels, dumplings and Mongolian beef received the highest marks. One person thought the moo shu was too runny and would have benefited from more pork. Another commented that the chicken could have had more veggies while a third remarked that they liked the way the chicken and its sauce were packaged separately, thus preventing the fried meat from getting soggy.

Now that my daughter is old enough to eat at a restaurant without making a scene (you parents know what I'm talking about) I've started to venture out with her to try new places.\n\nOn the kid-friendly front, they've got a nice aquarium with some large colorful fish in them and a fountain right in the center of the restaurant.

And their prices are very reasonable, especially for their lunch specials!\n\nI'm on a calorie/carb restricted diet, so I'm always really careful with what I ordered.

My roots were showing as if my hair was done at least a month ago. I also have the horrible tire marks on the side when I put my hair up!.She also complained the whole time about how tired she was cause she was out late with friends!

The beans and rice...well...average once again.\n\nService was okay as was the cost.

I walked in the store, a person greeted me (good) and asked what I needed (also good). Here is where it gets bad. Now I have to admit that I just got done working out at this new and might I add awesome place ..... I will write about that later, so I was a little \"un-kept\". Hair a bit messy, workout clothes on, slight smell.....but anyway, the sales pitch began. Right off the bat I could tell that she worked off of commission. Do you really need to be THAT desperate? What kind of plan do you have, I can up-grade you, blah, blah, blah, nothing she said was really that bad or unexpected, it was just the condescending way in which she was saying it. Like I said, I didn't look like a super model, BUT I have been into other ATT stores and have been treated very well wearing a similar gym inspired outfits. Basically the lady hated her job and was trying to get me to spend mega $$ on something I didn't want or need and when I told her what I really wanted and needed....i.e. a phone that has just the basics (I'm not that tech savvy and I am constantly breaking them) she just became rude, as if she had something better to do than show me a couple of freaking phones. Now I could have been a little understanding if the store was busy, but it wasn't. Only myself and one other customer were there. That was the point where I just walked out with no phone in my hand:( I will just order it online. It boggles my mind that in this economy sales people can afford to be rude to potential clients. I'm sorry but I went in expecting service, choosing to go to their physical location to purchase a phone.

Plus, around Halloween, they carry all the basics like makeup, costumes, masks, etc. Last year, a friend went in to peruse the makeup selection for her zombie prom look and the employee happened to be a special effects guru. He helped her pick out every supply, tool, base, glue and blood she needed and even gave her instructions on HOW to use it. He also made sure to help explain why some brands of glue or blood are better than others (don't you just hate it when your scab falls off your face on the way to the party? Or your fake eyelashes keep peeling away at the corners?) To cut my rambling short - her makeup and her roommate's makeup looked amazing (some secret tip she got involved bunched up tissue, don't ask me how it works but it does).\n\nNot that you're ever in Mesa just hanging out, but even when it's not Halloween and you have some time to kill -especially if you have small children with you - you have to visit Bubbles of Joy at least once in your life.", "business_id": "bbFWQng4nd0P083xUEiShA", "stars": 5, "date": "2007-09-21", "type": "review"}

There is a private back room that at first I thought might contain adult material that he led us into, but it's really only gory type items (damn!) and you have to ask to be let in. \n\nInside the room, it was dimly lit with a red bulb and he had set up a meat case full of body parts, serial killer flesh face masks were on the wall, many kinds of skulls, monster props, and smaller accessories were inside. Prices were very reasonable, the masks in the serial killer series were only $15. There were of course, tons of packaged costumes for just about anything you could think of.

The place is shabby chic to the max, with every little detail--from gorgeous chandeliers to antiqued cabinets--clearly thought out. There's no denying that the place has personality, and in this day and age, when pretty much every salon has the same Ikea couch, I can definitely appreciate it. \n\nThe reason I chose this place initially was because I had originally seen my stylist, Hayley, at Dizin Salon in Tempe, which closed back in January.

Well, it was a good choice on my part, because she did just as great of a job on my cut and highlights as she did back at Dizin and her pricing was very reasonable. \n\nGood places are worth the drive, and I will definitely make the drive out again to Mesa to see Hayley at Habit.", "business_id": "KWQZsI3YaO7F71AF1LJwWw", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-09-05", "type": "review"}

I like the decor because it has this eclectic thing going with the different chandeliers and knick knacks spread around the salon as well a ceiling trim. It's quite interesting to say the least. The waiting area is just a hodge podge of differents couches and chairs, and they have like jars of candy by the cashier desk and on the divider between the waiting area and a set of stylist' stations. \n\nSo, I go to Habit simply because of Hayley who I will recommend to anyone because she's simply a sweetheart, flexible with her schedule and always willing to work with her client, oh and her prices are reasonable to say the least. So if you were to check out Habit, say you'd like to work with Hayley!", "business_id": "KWQZsI3YaO7F71AF1LJwWw", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-10-20", "type": "review"}
