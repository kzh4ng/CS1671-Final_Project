I came to the Homestead location last night eager to see the beer at this location.\n\nNow, Rockbottom is a chain brewery, so a lot was the same... the menu, the food prices (yet beer is cheaper, and I am fine with that). I have always found their food to be pricey, but they use excellent ingredients and it has always been tasty and filling so I am fine with that. The food here was just as good as the Long Beach location, so I have no problem with the chef at all.\n\nService was good, our waitress was very friendly and helpful. I wish that they had asked us if we wanted to sit in the bar since happy hour was still going, but that isn't a big thing. Went to the bar to get a drink and had to wait awhile to get the bartender's attention, but he was very friendly and I got a nice welcome from him and others at the bar when they learned I had just moved here... I really enjoyed that.\n\nBeer: We got the beer sampler to try the whole list... and, well... I found the dark beers a bit lacking in comparison. The light beer and the wheat were amazing, very impressed. The pale was ok, as was the velvet pale that was one of the specials of the night... but both were way too citrusy. The Uppity IPA was very good... I don't usually like IPAs because the hops overpowers all flavor but the brewer had a good balance. Still, couldn't do a whole glass. I felt the Imperial Stout had a bitter burned taste that was overpowering... I almost want to say the batch had too much chocolate malt in it (not ice cream malt, for the non-homebrewers). The brown and amber were decent, but bland. I ended up getting an actual glass of the light beer and was able to finish it all without forcing it.... one point up on Long Beach, who had a good light but the aftertaste got to you before the glass was empty.\n\nI REALLY wanted to try the Das Gut Dopplebock, but they were out. Looks like they will have it in bottles to go soon so I hope I can catch that. Also want to try the Snow Moon Belgian.\n\nVerdict: While I was not too impressed with the dark beers, I found the lighter ones very good and I look forward to trying the other seasonal beers. It is a good hour drive south to get there, so I won't be going too often, but I will be back.", "business_id": "McikHxxEqZ2X0joaRNKlaw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-01-18", "type": "review"}

I nursed it all through dinner so I don't think I was head over heels in love with it.  I got the Catch of the Day, Off the Hook, Fish Dish, Sailors Delight or something(I forget it had some cheesy fish themed name).  It was cod (meh, that should have been the sign not to get it) with roasted asparagus and lemon rice.  The fish was suppose to be broiled but it had a thick breading (annoyed) and the portion of fish was tiny. The rice and asparagus were great though. \n\nMy friend got a chicken sandwich which he enjoyed although the fries were pathetic.  The fries were probably pre-cut frozen fries or just very poorly executed.  They were so thin that you have to grab a huge handful just to get any actual potato flavor.\n\nPros: A lot of tables (no wait), brew special beers, big menu, could hear the dueling piano bar next door\n\nCons: Place was fairly empty and we got a crappy table by the door when it was 5 degrees outside, most of the food was fried, cheese filled, cream based, or wrapped in bacon.  I know some people love to eat food like this all the time( I do every once in awhile) but if you eat out a lot you can't always get the spin dip, burger, and ice cream sundae.

I say \"surprised' because with any restaurant that falls into the slippery territory of a \"chain\", you expect to find your fair share of culinary duds.  But I've really had a lot of good meals at Rock Bottom.  Now, granted, you do owe it to yourself when ordering to not forget where you are (a \"bar-straunt\" if you will), and don't get anything above and beyond this place's call of duty.  For instance, I will never be ordering the ahi tuna.  I'll leave that to my favorite sushi bars and restaurants a bit closer to the water (the Mon doesn't count.....).\n\nBut besides that, I always really enjoy my meal choices.  I've recently gotten the chicken avocado sandwich.  Chicken was grilled perfectly, plenty of avocado, and it was a good sized sandwich without being excessive.  I've also ordered the Margherita pizza, which could definitely be split between two people.  It's an eight cut that comes to you on a big wooden pizza paddle.  The pizza was really great.  The crust was crispy, it had a good balance of cheese and tomatoes, and the basil pesto was fresh and tasty.  And not greasy whatsoever - BIG bonus points there.  But my biggest surprise as of late was when I ordered their chicken flautas.  I'm a HUGE Mexican food fan and always hesitate to order Mexican outside of a Mexican restaurant for fear of being disappointed.  But I had an insatiable craving one night and decided to go for it.  It was DELICIOUS.  The flautas are deep fried which gives you an amazing crunch, and they still managed to not dry out the inner ingredients.  The accompanying rice was nice and moist as well.  I was so happy!\n\nI've always been quite happy with the service there as well.  I go on Thursday evenings for trivia, and nine times out of ten the service is really spot on.  The ladies servicing the bar area are friendly and attentive.  Only once or twice, to my memory, has my service been sub-par, and that can usually be chalked up to an extremely packed Trivia Night with only two visible servers helping 50+ people.\n\nI definitely give Rock Bottom two thumbs up for taking your typical chain-found food and making it fresh, yummy, and worth coming back for more.", "business_id": "McikHxxEqZ2X0joaRNKlaw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-01-23", "type": "review"}

I love fish tacos, I mean it is such a simple concept so why do people have such a hard time executing this dish? The shells were hard and literally split at the bottom when I picked them up.  The sour cream sprayed all over the plate only made them messy and the poor fish was just so overcooked.  If I wasn't so hungry I wouldn't have eaten them at all! Lesson learn on that.\n\nThe husband had the BBQ Chicken Pizza.  It had beans and corn with roasted red pepper on it along with some sour cream.  My husband is usually the type that will order these lovely specialty pizza's and ask for them to remove all the wonderful unique toppings!  For instance, he would usually just say, Chicken BBQ and cheese, nothing else!  I refused to let him do that this time, because I was really intrigued in the combination of ingredients on this pie.  And boy was I jealous when it came out.  It blew my crappy tacos out of the water!  Should have stuck with something simple.  \n\nFurthermore I could care less if I come back to this location.

Tazza D'Oro is one of them. I wont say THE best simply because coffee is such an objective taste but you cannot deny the expertise and care Tazza D'Oro subscribes to. It brings them millions of miles above Starbucks and (gasp) Crazy Mocha.\n\nI found out about Tazza D'Oro while browsing the blog of an award winning, internationally recognized barista. He conveniently mapped out his favorite coffee houses around the US via Google Maps. I clicked on PA and zoomed it, not even expecting to see a marker. Surprisingly there was -- only one -- and it was for Tazza D'Oro.\n\nTheir baristas know how to make the perfect espresso. Once you've done that all of your other drinks fall right into place. They also do french pressed coffee which is a rare treat usually enjoyed at home and, at least in my case, not done nearly as well as it should be. Their pastries and baked goods come straight from one of the 'burgh's best bakeries -- Enrico's in the Strip District; what more could you ask for?\n\nI have a longer article on Tazza D'Oro as well as another great coffee shop, Espresso a Mano on my website. http://eatinginpittsburgh.com/2011/02/11/coffee-pittsburgh-part-2/", "business_id": "83_p9vIqOq1TUIf3_GD7bA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-02-16", "type": "review"}

Homewood? Garfield? Wrong. it's the Whole Foods parking lot. Since I drive a Mini Cooper, it's considerably easier for me to zip around and dodge the Lexus SUVs that fly at you from every angle in this jungle of a parking lot, but I'm not sure how you people with normal-sized cars do it. Compounding the problem are the abandoned shopping carts rolling about and sometimes filling the already-limited parking spaces, thanks to the shortage of shopping cart corrals. Cold and tired, I found myself seriously considering abandoning my cart when I noticed that the nearest corral was on the other side of the lot. Don't worry, I didn't succumb to the temptation, but judging by the state of the parking lot, I think I'm in the minority.\n\nIf you actually make it into the store without any physical injury (you will be psychologically scarred, trust), there's definitely some good stuff to be had. As others have noted, the store is really small, causing the selection to be less than extensive. It's also too crowded. I like to spend a lot time in the grocery store checking out what's new and reading labels and such, but I feel awkward doing that when there's a swarm of soccer moms lurking over my shoulder and zigging and zagging all over the goddamn place. ANYWAY...some notes on various departments:\n\n1. The produce here immediately stands out--it looks so much more appetizing and fresh than at Giant Eagle. Even the bagged salad greens are more vibrant. Unfortunately, it's a tradeoff for the smaller selection of produce, but they have all the basics covered.\n\n2. This past trip was the first time I bought meat from Whole Foods, and the cuts were noticably neater and more consistent than at GE. Not sure if this is a regular thing, but they didn't have any filet mignon (I know, I'm high maintenance. I'M WORTH IT!).\n\n3. The cheese department! I like how GE Market District organizes their cheese a little better, but Whole Foods has a much more interesting and varied selection.\n\n5. The food bar is hit or miss. Some days it's the best thing ever, other days not so much. The sushi is gross. I always seem to forget this and try it over and over again with the same fishy, mealy results. Don't be stupid like me, avoid it.\n\n6. Market District recently got rid of a lot of their natural & organic chip selection in favor of more varities of their store brand. Thankfully, Whole Foods has everything GE used to have and more, which totally makes the extra shopping trip worth it. If you're a fat kid like me, that is...\n\nI don't come here for everything, but there are definitely some advantages here. Plus, the prices here are not THAT much worse than Market District in most cases.

I think it gets a bad rap, which I think is largely unfair.  I love food, and I know that sometimes things are legitimately \"overpriced,\" but just because something is expensive doesn't mean it isn't worth the cost.  So I don't believe in rating Whole Foods low just because their organic produce, ethically raised meat, and super hard-to-find ethnic ingredients cost money.  Nice things cost money.\n\nThis is not one of the glorious meccas - the Whole Foods in Lincoln Park in Chicago is definitely one of those - but this one is all right.  Pretty decent produce selection, and they always have some fun, mysterious finds.  I like their seasonal treats like meyer lemons, and their well-priced organic local produce throughout the summer.  Small fish and meat counter, but the quality is excellent.  My coworkers love the soups, and we all really enjoy the salad bar.  I love that I can find really unusual things here - their Asian section is small, but they always seem to have what I need.  And the prices on the Whole Foods store brand are really not that bad!  Seriously, like a can of beans will only set you back 99 cents, not that different from your Giant Eagle.  You can find affordable products here if you take the time.\n\nI wish their bulk section was bigger, and I wish they had bulk spices because those make my life amazing.  Whole Foods is like, where I want to do all my shopping when I grow up.  I hate shopping at Giant Eagle, because there's no love and respect for the product.  It's just crap, and OVERPRICED crap spilling out of the aisles, begging for your attention.  Whole Foods has a lot of specialty products, made and sold by people who love to eat, and love to cook.  There's respect for the ingredients here.  To me, that's the best sign of a good grocery store.\n\nIf you don't have a lot of cash, like me, then it's good to only shop here when you need to (like for a weird cut of meat, some kind of unusual hot pepper or mushroom, flavored oil, rare cheese).  Every time you come, buy something new, just for fun.  There are so many surprises here!  I just wish it was bigger.\n\nAnd yes, the parking lot is small and crowded, but like - so what?

Cuz let's face it, how could I seriously compare this location to the original, gigantic, amazing, fresh, wonderful, healthy, gorgeous Whole Foods in Austin? Instead, I'll limit myself on reviewing the ever so friendly staff and parking lot. \n\nFirst, the employees. I've been to several Whole Foods around the country and I always got the impression that Whole Foods prides itself on customer service. Maybe this place is the exception? I was shopping here yesterday and a lady kindly asked an employee if she could squeeze in behind his veggie cart to grab something. The employee actually had the audacity to say, \"When I'm done\". And he did just that. He finished stocking his fruits and veggies and when he moved his cart and the lady thanked him, he didn't say a word. Also, the lady bagging my groceries didn't say one word to me. Not when I said hello. Not when I said thank you. Not even an \"ok\" when I said have a nice day. She didn't even smile at me! Where is the love? Actually, where are your manners?  I don't need you to love me, but don't be rude or ignore me. \n\nSecond, the parking lot. I'm pretty sure this is the only Whole Foods in all of Pittsburgh. However, the parking lot seems to be built for Pittsburgh, population: 50. It's a small lot - good luck finding a spot without creepily following someone to their car and fighting an SUV for the spot. Luckily, I've never truly had a problem parking because I go at off times and park farther away. But I'm suspecting one of these days I'll come out and find my car dented or scratched. Maybe by a car, maybe by a shopping cart......maybe by the lady who was bagging my groceries yesterday....\n\nSo two stars docked for the above mentioned.

I will tell you why.\n\nMany Yelpers have docked stars for the parking lot. I think that's irrelevant. The parking lot, which is actually shared by Starbucks, Wine & Spirits, Walgreens, PNC, and more is two levels and is enormous! Walk a little. You can even take your cart up the elevator.\n\nThe Pittsburgh location is not a superstore. Other Whole Foods have a restaurant, brick oven pizzas, smoothie bar, coffee bar, many more food bars, wine, beer, and so forth. This is a teeny weeny Whole Foods. For its size, the selection is pretty impressive. For example, my mom saw something on Dr. Oz called Lingonberry Jam and asked if I would look for it, and there it was. Never heard of it before, but they had it. \n\nWhole Foods has that \"whole paycheck\" reputation. Granted, this is true if you're spending your whole paycheck on rare, gourmet, specialty foods! If that's the case, you might want to rein in your spending a little. \n\nI actually took a notebook to Trader Joe's, Giant Eagle, and Whole Foods when I first moved to Pittsburgh to compare prices. Giant Eagle (Greenfield location) was the most expensive by an overwhelming margin! Trader Joe's was the best value overall, but Whole Foods was very close, and sometimes a little better quality might be worth it. Their 365 brand is especially reasonable for your regular grocery staples.\n\nAs for the occasional splurge, this is a good place to try something different. I admit it's hard not to get something extra, but I know I can only blame that final total on myself!", "business_id": "wfCLz9-aeShbPB7CaTY-qQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-01-28", "type": "review"}

The parking lot is a mess of aggressive drivers acting like the extra 50 feet of walking will negatively affect the environment more than their driving around the parking lot until a better space opens up. Once you get a space and finally get inside, the experience mirrors that of the parking lot. Everyone is in each others' way and trying to be the first one to find the best organic orange or grab the last package vegan general tso's in the store.\n\nTo be fair, though, the experience is still 100 times better than going to the Market District a few blocks down the same street. Similar in-store and in-lot experience, but with a better and higher-quality selection. The staff is always really nice and super helpful, and their trays of fruit and veggies are excellent. We've ordered them countless times for parties and have never been let down. Pricey, but excellent quality. The prepared foods are delicious, and their prepackaged prepared foods are also really good...but like nearly everything else in Whole Foods, a little pricey. For example, their yummy tomato bisque is $7. Hardly cheap enough for a quick lunch, but it is yummy. Their baked goods are delicious as well. We're constantly picking up bread from there (and the occasional doughnut), and we're never disappointed.\n\nTheir meats and seafoods departments are also excellent. They have a great variety and are always helpful in answering any questions that I've had (although we still opt for our meats from DJ's). Of course, if you're at Whole Foods your'e likely there for the organic options, and as to be expected, you're not going to find a better selection anywhere else. More unique, perhaps, but their inventory just won't be matched any time soon for those foods. Surprisingly, third-party & prepackaged pricing is actually on-par with Giant Eagle, so whenever we're looking for those types of items (milk/eggs/pastas, etc.), we always opt for Whole Foods.", "business_id": "wfCLz9-aeShbPB7CaTY-qQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-12-11", "type": "review"}

It is not uncommon to pass fender benders in the parking lot on a Saturday. My suggestion is park closer to the CVS and avoid the abominable parking and terrible driving.\n\nIt's generally extremely crowded on the weekends, espeically in the afternoons, so if you need to grocery shop on a weekend afternoon, make sure you have a list and start in the back. You will thank me later.\n\nThough this location is small, it is always well-stocked, and the staff, though some are aloof and pretentious (even though they are working for corporate America-hello), most are helpful.\n\nI love the prepared foods and salad bar. It's a great option for those nights when you just don't feel like cooking. There are $6, $8, and $10 meal options, and all come with two sides. There is also a large selection of dips, spreads, and large take-away sides as well. I think their prepared foods are worth every penny, and if you don't load up your salad with heavy items, you can easily get a dinner-sized salad with a little meat or egg for $8 or $9.\n\nSome of my favorite items at this location include the fresh fruit packaged in containers. It's super expensive, but always fresh and delicious, and I love treating myself to it, especially during the summer. I also love the fish selection-it's pretty extensive, and you can always find fresh harder to find items such as red snapper.\n\nThe raw nut offerings are extensive as well, as is the chocolate...\n\nMy favorite thing to buy at this WF is coffee. They have a huge selection of Allegro beans, as well as local offerings such as La Prima. Try the La Prima Peruvian blend or the Allegro Malawi blend.

Although the few times I was here, there was barely anybody else there besides the group I dragged along and the band's friends.  Usually 2-3 acts play.  Live.  And it's nice that there aren't many of us because we can sit up close.

I haven't heard of many vegetarian/vegan places in Pittsburgh so I expected to have some awesome vegetarian food.  However, from the get go, our host was absolutely terrible.  He did not look us in the eye and was just overall awkward.  There was obviously room in the restaurant for the four of us but he had to \"look in the back\" to see if there was room.  One of the other servers eventually sat us in a clearly empty table that we could have picked out for ourselves.  Our first host came back, reiterated the same thing the server told us, but never gave us menus.  I had to go out of my way to ask for menus about five or ten minutes after we had been seated.\n\nTo be fair, our assigned server was very nice.  She was friendly and approachable.  But of course, our food came and mine was cold.  The potatoes in the hash I ordered was stale, old and cold and had such a small accompanying serving of bread.  Also, our utensils weren't given to us until after our food was served.  I know I may be sounding like a little bit of a snob but utensils should be expected before the food arrives.

I love meat. But I also love vegetables and fruits and pretty much the entire food pyramid. And these things can be combined to make tasty vegan food. But \"Texturized vegetable protein hydrated with seasonings\" is not food to me. Yep, that description of their \"chorizo\" comes directly off their menu. Eating vegetarian does NOT mean you need to subject yourself to these highly processed \"foods.\"\n\nLess processed substitutes like tofu, tempeh, and seitan are used as well, but they are mostly treated as a stand-in for meat. I guess if you are a vegetarian that misses eating meat, this may satisfy you. However, as an omnivore, why would I eat a faux-BLT when I can eat a real one? How about instead of trying to imitate the flavor and texture of meat, we actually come up with creative combinations of vegetables, fruits, and legumes that are delicious in their own right.

I refuse to fix the previous sentence.)\n\nI went on a journey through Pittsburgh in search of a good baguette. Of course, being a student, my first destinations were Giant Eagle, Whole Foods, and Trader Joes.

DUN DUN DUN.\n\nSo of course, with every bakery, there is the option of buying and eating right away. But there is also the option for half-baked baguettes at BreadWorks, where the bread is not fully finished and you finish the rest of the baking yourself. Now, if you hear yourself saying, \"Why would I do the rest of the job for them?\" I don't want to be your friend. Who would not want freshly baked bread at home? Ugh, who are you? Anyways, I buy a bag of those, put it in my freezer, then finish it off in the oven whenever I need my baguette fix. (Seriously, I love this bread. My girlfriend is worried about my waistline).\n\nSo what makes a good baguette? It has to be crunchy and thin on the outside, but delicate, light, and soft on the inside. You don't fight the bread when you eat it (and it shouldn't win, for that matter... your poor gums after sub-par bread); instead, it should break and tear easily.

Doughnuts and giant muffins for $.65.  Cookies of all shapes and sizes are delicious and cheap as well.  It makes me so happy.

Seriously, after having to survive on Foodland, the only \"neighborhood\" grocery store in Mt. Washington, this is a welcome change.

Small being the operative word, considering most Giant Eagle's are ginormous. \n\nI've even discovered new products here, like my delicious Lara Fiber Bars. I'm surprised at the nice gourmet cheese selection, the big deli area and even a counter for fresh seafood. So now I can just run down the block if I need to pick up something quick or do my whole week's shopping here. It's glorious! \n\nThe only thing I wish for is a better parking lot. Since I'm coming off Dwight Ave it's nice to sneak right in. But coming out is another issue. There's only one way traffic around the parking lot.

For starters, it's a practical size. I don't need to walk halfway around the planet, or use GPS, to find what I need. The staff are ALWAYS helpful and friendly! Despite their modest size, they do stock a very wide range of products, meats, and produce-far more than any other grocery store of similar size. Also, Kuhn's started as a butcher shop waaaay back in the day, and the quality  and selection of their meats shows it-far better than any competitors. They are open 24 hours, and the deli is open til 10pm. The hot foods here are fantastic. I often just grab my dinner to go, while I'm shopping. And the rotisserie chickens are HUGE compared to other stores. I just wish the hot foods were open a bit longer-they shut down, and 6pm, when most people are just getting home from work. The baked goods are another plus. The cakes here actually taste like cake from a bakery. Not many grocery stores can make such a claim. Checking out at Kuhn's is also a breeze. They actually have plenty of staff on registers, so as to keep lines moving, and very short-unlike S&S and Big Bird. And there are none of those damned self check outs. If I'm giving a store my business, I shouldn't have to check myself out, because they are too cheap to properly staff the place (I'm talking to YOU Giant Eagle). In addition, the prices here typically LOWER than S&S and Big Bird. The only reason I can't give this place a full 5 stars, is that they often run out of basic products (dog food, deli meats, sale items), the early closing of hot foods, and the game of chicken one has to play when parking at Banksville Plaza.

They have their private blends too.\n\nI'm not into tea as much, although I'll buy here in the summer to make ice tea.

It took me three visits to figure this out: The first time, I came at 4pm on Sat. (out of it for the day), and the second time, I came before noon on Sun. (no hot chocolate served on Sun.).  The third time, when I arrived at 12:15pm on Sat. on a bitterly cold Dec. day, was the charm.\n\nSo how was this mythical hot chocolate?  It was good, but not quite what I expected.  When another reviewer described it as \"thick [and] pudding-like,\" I expected something served in a bowl-like cup that I'd have to attack with a spoon.  Instead, I received a thick, but drinkable, chocolate liquid served in a paper cup (see photo).  Was it indeed the best hot chocolate in PGH?  Yeah, I guess--at least out of the hot chocolates I've tried.  Was it worth $4?  Maybe (see answer to point 1). Would I go all the way to the Strip specifically to get it again?  Doubtful.\n\nIn addition to the hot chocolate, I picked up a peppermint-spangled chocolate bar.  It was quite pricy (around $8), but the owner, who I asked if there was a smaller version (no), talked up the maker, so I decided to give it a try.  I had similar feelings about it to the ones I had about the hot chocolate.  Was it good?  Yes.  Was it worth $8?  Probably not.\n\nAs others have mentioned, the owner (the older woman) is a bit lacking in social graces, as I observed from her abrupt answers to my inquiries about the hot chocolate (I felt like she was the hot chocolate Nazi, akin to Seinfeld's soup Nazi).  Even the time when it was available, she introduced some confusion into my interaction with the employee working at the hot chocolate bar.  However, she did a great job talking up that chocolate bar!\n\nI'd be willing to come back to try the gelato when the weather warms up (I'll update this review if I do).  I strongly suspect I'd have a similar reaction to the one I did for the hot chocolate and chocolate bar, however.  3.5 stars.", "business_id": "gFT2yXDXJ1qfuGOSfSU5Bw", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-01-08", "type": "review"}

One is that the market is not really very well-heated in winter, so you will freeze in here if you aren't warmly dressed.  The other is that you have to be very careful in your assessment of what you are about to buy.

I love Klavon's so much that I've been known to stop in for a tasty treat here even on the chilliest of Pittsburgh winter nights. And it takes some darn good ice cream to get me to overcome my aversion to the cold during that season, let me tell you!\n\nKlavon's is one of the oldest places I know of in the area that serves food and dessert. It originally opened in 1923, although there was admittedly 20-year period where it was closed. I bring this up since they reopened in 1999 - but aside from restructuring things a bit for basic functionality purposes, they didn't really renovate or modernize the look of the shop. The result is that it really looks, feels and even smells like you've stepped back into an old ice cream parlor. There are wooden booths and tables, an old counter with iconic revolving stools, even old wooden phone-booths (non-functioning now, of course).\n\nBut enough about the shop. Let's talk about the food - like the ice cream, which comes from Penn State Creamery. Really, do I need to say anything else? It's delicious! But it gets better - not only does Klavon's serve plain ol' Penn State Creamery ice cream, they also serve sundaes, ice cream sodas, ice cream floats, and splits. All made with Penn State Creamery ice cream. It's heaven right here in Pittsburgh as far as I'm concerned.\n\nAnd even if you're not in a dessert kind of mood, Klavon's is still worth a trip - they also serve paninis, soup, pepperoni rolls, and a couple small kid snacks. Not to mention, they sell a range of candy - some new, some older classics - that you can purchase singularly or in-bulk and take with you. I know this is something my parents absolutely love, as they're fans of some of the candy options.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, this place is a historic and tasty Pittsburgh treasure.

She made the blend for me which was something smooth, something mocha, and something dark. I can't remember the actual names. She ground the beans for me in a burr grinder (the only way to grind espresso nicely) and told me they were fresh enough that I could maaaybe squeeze a month out of them. The connoisseurs out there might disagree with that statement but a beginner like me would never know the difference. Knowing the special flavor you get out of a freshly ground espresso I made a cup, unadulterated, the second I got home. It created a nice caramel colored crema that was about 1/4\" thick and was the darkest espresso I think I'd ever had (not saying much but still a compliment!). It was really good and really bitter in only the way a great espresso can be. Those of you who enjoy IPAs and really hoppy beers will understand how \"bitter\" can be used in a good way.\n\nI'll definitely be back since it's a quick ride down the street.

(My almost-half-price list currently includes: dried pasta, dried beans, olives, capers, olive oil, tahini, spices, most produce, tiramisu ingredients and most nicer cheeses.)\n\nI will reiterate that if you go on a weekend (doesn't even have to be before a holiday or nice weather) you will be waiting outside for a bit before you even get to enter the store, much less take a number at the cheese counter.\n\nOh yeah, the employees might not ask you if you need help but they are more than willing to do so when asked.", "business_id": "niW0ggRVPW5fafcfImdK7w", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-02-13", "type": "review"}

We stacked loaves of bread in the car as well. Seeing all the salted fish (for the upcoming feast of 7 fishes) was beautiful. The most memorable part of the visit, however, was in a small, rather grimy room that boasted huge canisters of home-made wine and small glasses. Initially under the impression that I was intruding upon the staff holiday party, a smiling worker told me that customers were welcome to sample the wine. I was a little wary of trying the un-labeled wine, but it was wonderful and warming.

If you've never been to the Strip before, Penn Mac is one of those places that's a must-see.  (Other merchants I'd place in this category are Wholey's, Enrico Biscotti, and Mon Aimee Chocolat, all of which we also visited.)  They have the widest array of Italian foods in PGH, as well as several other staples that you can use to round out your shopping (milk, fruit/veggies, etc.), and the prices aren't bad at all!\n\nOn my trip, I ended up picking up some goat cheese, as well as some miniature star pasta for homemade soup, some regular Barilla pasta, some milk, and some oranges.  (I'd already picked up most of my produce from Stan's and Market Outlet, but all of their oranges looked sketchy.)  Although I didn't pick up any cheese other than the goat cheese, since I'm on a healthy eating kick at present, I was impressed by the array of cheeses, as well as the olive bar (even though I don't really care for olives).  As others have mentioned, they have about a gazillion types of pastas (dried and fresh) and sauces, as well as a nice array of bread featuring Breadworks loaves.  Although the desserts look tempting on the way out, I'd recommend giving them a pass and visiting Enrico Biscotti or Colangelo's nearby to satiate your sweet tooth instead.\n\nBecause I live in N. Oakland, Groceria Italiana and Donatelli's are my go-tos when it comes to picking up authentic Italian ingredients.

After receiving it I asked for some cream and was pointed around the corner and found only half and half in the little pre-sealed cup.  Once again for a place specializing in coffee this was a bit disappointing. Thankfully the taste of the Americano more than made up for that as it was strong and extremely smooth.  My fiance also enjoyed hers as well.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I will be back here again in the future not only for their large selection of loose leaf teas but also for their Americanos.   Make sure that if you want anything from behind the counter to look at their lists as I surely will the next time that I am there.  I also hope that in the future they will have some milk in addition to the half and half but I am not holding my breath.", "business_id": "TASUnYvk_nvTUyKtroCJSA", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-01-11", "type": "review"}

Well, in the past 9 years or so, I have seen their quality rapidly go further and further downhill. Worse and worse quality to the product, declining taste and poorer ingredients are plainly evident. Sloppier and sloppier decorating, ruder and ruder counter staff.\n\nWe have continued to shop there simply due to the location being convenient, but these days you are really TAKING YOUR CHANCES as to whether the items you buy from them will be somewhat tasty or TOTALLY INEDIBLE. Still, I try to support neighborhood businesses as much as possible so it does break my heart to trash them in a review like this, but these things need to be said.\n\nThey continue to have a lot of customers due to their location and due to people remembering how good they USED TO BE, so when folks are back visiting their old neighborhood, they return to this bakery for the memories. But oh, how the standards have fallen!\n\nWe got some cupcakes for a party last year in November that we literally could not eat, they were so dry and bad- they went in the trash (not cheap either). Thank goodness it was just a small kiddie birthday get-together and not an important occasion with guests I would have been embarrassed in front of.\n\nWe considered getting our wedding cake from them (again, in order to support a neighborhood place) in 2008 but they gave us such a hard time regarding even getting an appointment for a cake consultation that we went with another baker, out in the west end. Looking back, I am glad it happened that way.\n\nAs for daily items, their breads are usually decent and their donuts are edible (not great, just satisfactory) but have way too much sickly-sweet frosting. Cookies are usually fine but sometimes their cake decorating is clearly being done as such a rush job that it's sloppy beyond description. Danishes and many other items give the impression that something went sort of wrong with the recipe, items are heavy and greasy when they should be fluffy or flaky or soft and moist. Items seem overcooked or undercooked. I wonder if they ever really taste test what they are producing. Also I don't know how they get away with serving such pathetic cannolis in an Italian neighborhood- pastry cream and zero ricotta, plus just in general- funky ingredients that are blantantly, obviously pre-fab, no fillings seem freshly made, it's all out of some mass-produced tube. And for this low quality, they make you pay premium prices, OF COURSE!\n\nNothing is marked with price or name of the item, and when you ask, most of  the counter staff consistently take a disgusted tone with you and treat you like you are stupid, rolling their eyes at you (the only exception being the youngest girls that work there, in their early 20s, who are consistently very good at being polite when helping customers). The more mature ladies frequently say snarky things to me like: \"That's not a cinnamon SPIN, that's a cinnamon DONUT. That's not a DANISH, that's a FRUIT PASTRY.\" If you don't want to have to answer questions, then put up labels and tags with the names and prices and info, so customers can read what terms you are expecting us to use!\n\nMost recently, I picked up a birthday cake for my father's birthday, and it looked like a child decorated it. Seriously. I could have done a better job myself. Maybe they are employing the cheapest bakers and decorators rather than the more talented ones. If this is the case, it certainly shows.  \n\nI think I am DONE with continuing to try to support this \"neighborhood landmark.\" Any time you complain, it seems to do no good-- they do not see the need to heed customer comments and improve.", "business_id": "Msfys8NloDpAsWmhvC9T6A", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-01-04", "type": "review"}

This weekend, my mission to try out every bakery within PGH city limits (or at least, in the neighborhoods I frequent) brought me to Paddy Cake, since I was in Bloomfield to pick up some items at Donatelli's.\n\nHaving sampled several of their baked goods, if I had to sum up my impression in a word, it would be...inconsistent.  The baked goods I tried ran the full gamut from excellent to mediocre to awful.  Despite having covered 1/3-1/2 of PGH's bakeries and several in other towns, I've never been to one before where I came away with such a mixed experience.  Here are my assessments of the individual treats I tried, in order from best to worst:\n\nTiramisu: 4.5 stars--This tiramisu is right up there with Groceria Italiana's as one of the best I've had.  If you enjoy this dessert, you won't be disappointed--just eat it within a day or so, since the ladyfingers dry out after that, even in the fridge.\n\nLemon tart: 4.5 stars--The filling struck a perfect sweet-tart balance and was smooth and thick and creamy, but not overly so. The only part of this pastry that could bear improvement was the crust, which was forgettable.\n\nChocolate iced chocolate mini-cupcake: 4 stars--I wasn't expecting to care much for this 69 cent cupcake, but I was pleasantly surprised.  The cake was soft and velvety, and the buttercream icing was okay to good.  I only wish I'd picked up one of the cute ones decorated like a groundhog for Groundhog Day!\n\nChocolate iced donut: 3.5 stars--Despite their apparent popularity and what other reviewers have said, I found this cake donut to be mediocre, only slightly besting Dunkin's versions.  The dough was a tad on the dry side, and the icing had a very commercial taste, similar to icing available in the grocery store.\n\nDanish: 3 stars--I found the cheese and raspberry danishes pretty average in flavor, and on the small side for the price ($1.29 each).\n\nCinnamon roll: 2.5 stars--For reasons beyond my comprehension, many bakeries in PGH, including this one, don't seem to get that the key to a great cinnamon roll is...wait for it...lots of cinnamon!  Aside from being skimpy on the key ingredient, the consistency of the dough was too wet/oily, making for a disappointing version of my favorite bakery treat.  (They also had non-fried cinnamon buns, but they bore a striking resemblance to Entenmann's, so I decided against trying one.)\n\nCookies: 2 stars--It befuddles me how one cookie I ordered (triple chocolate iced, which looked amazing in the case) was gooey in the middle to the point that it was clearly undercooked, while the other one (peanut butter chocolate chip) was overcooked to the point that it was hard and brittle.  Also, both cookies were iced with the same commercial-tasting chocolate icing used on the donuts.\n\nIn terms of the offerings, as others have mentioned, there's nothing that really sets Paddy Cake apart, since they don't have any unique products (e.g., Prantl's), and they don't seem to focus in any specific type(s) of baked goods (e.g., Colangelo's, Vanilla Pastry Studio).  Having said that, service was friendly and efficient, and prices were very reasonable (all of the above came to slightly north of $10).  Thus, while I may stop by occasionally while I'm in Bloomfield, I wouldn't go out of my way to come here specifically. 3.5 stars.", "business_id": "Msfys8NloDpAsWmhvC9T6A", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-02-04", "type": "review"}

Based on my experiences from when I've stopped in, I'd have to say that Paddy Cake is an a-ok place. The baked goods I've purchased here have tasted just fine - they haven't always been particularly unique (I've admittedly been spoiled by the range of goodies available at other bakeries as of late), but I've got nothing against a well made basic treat. Most recently I left with a pre-made box of cupcakes and I found them to be moist and topped with the right amount of icing; the icing wasn't overwhelming in flavor, either, which was a plus in my book. While waiting in line during my most recent visit I also saw a range of cookies and some bread just waiting to be eaten, and a number of boxes waiting to be picked up as well. Considering the sugar craving I had at that point, everything was mouth watering - I would've tried it all if I could have.\n\nThat said, while this place is just fine for what it is, it's just not as extravagant as some of the other bakeries that we've been spoiled by as of late. I admit that I haven't been super impressed by the availability of baked goods here during my last few stops, either; maybe it's just me, but during my visits there haven't been a ton of goods ready to go in the store. All I've ever really seen are variety of cookies, a couple danishes, some bread, and a lot of empty shelves. Basically, while goodies I've picked up have tasted pretty good and I've been impressed by the special order cakes I've seen other people pick up, the immediate availability of goods has been generally lacking. Not necessarily bad, but again, when you're spoiled by the availability of treats at other bakeries it can be a little disappointing to stop in at a smaller one and to have to choose from a smaller selection.\n\nAll in all, this place is a pretty solid \"a-ok\" in my book - not always extraordinary but they're good at what they do. I concur with another review who said that this place is worth stopping in at occasionally but not worth going out of your way for. I also recommend special ordering your cake or other goodies when you can here - otherwise you'll just have wait to see what they've got in stock on the day you're stopping in.", "business_id": "Msfys8NloDpAsWmhvC9T6A", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-02-17", "type": "review"}

Of course, as people who shop the Strip District, etc., we're not going to get too hung up on that. Just be certain to keep an eye on what they're stocking and make sure it's fresh!\n\nThe prepared foods are good, and the deli has a decent selection...not to mention their absurdly-affordable sandwiches. It's generally cheaper than the other Italian market nearby, Groceria Italiana (ex. the same half-gallon of milk was 30 cents cheaper at Donatelli's), and has more in terms of general grocery items, coffee (they sell Nicholas Coffee!), and snacks, so if you're looking to do a more extensive shopping trip, Donatelli's is probably recommended. My wife and I prefer Groceria italiana's pastas, desserts, and atmosphere, but we shop both on a regular basis. They're different enough to coexist, and both are good options!

Oh, what luck on our part.  \n\nThe place smelled wonderful and the cakes, cookies, eclairs, pies, etc. all looked amazing.  First thing my friend asked about was a particular type of cake that he had been craving for a while.  Of course they had the Yellow Cake with buttercream frosting that he wanted.  She boxed it up and then we asked her to give us 12 assorted cookies, bakers choice but no nuts.\n\nFeeling happy about our current collection, I happened upon what appeared to be an apple purse.  It was in fact an apple dumpling (a whole apple inside rather than diced apple) and it rounded our order for the night.\n\nWe couldn't wait, we started munching on the cookies.  They were fresh and good.  I particularly like the oatmeal raisin that she put in and the mint chocolate chip tree was the most unusual one.  After my fourth cookie, the box was removed from my hands and I was told that I couldn't have any more until after dinner.  That is not made-up.\n\nAfter having eaten some of the cake and the apple dumpling, I must say that I will return.  The dumpling could use a little more cinnamon and I could taste the extra acid that was used (lemon juice?) but I am fairly fond of it.

They have an awesome tea selection, and I had their organic citrus green tea. The layout is great inside - a lot of tables, and outlets for the laptop users. Up one level, they have couches by a fireplace, and finally in the back they have a closed-in meeting room available for groups. Great location - great tea.

I asked if they offered free internet.  Simple question, right?  She hesitated and then went on this whole diatribe about how it used to be free, and then it wasn't and now it kinda is, but she wasn't sure.  I swear that's exactly what she said.  So she hesitantly gives me this paper, pulled off from a whole stack mind you, of the Internet name and password.  At this point I'm confused...do you not want me to be here?  Is it free?  I finally got my answer when I logged on with no issues, it's free.  Why all the hassle??\n\nThe only reason I can see (and seriously a big one) is the coffee shop hanger on-ers.  I can only imagine how this has become an epidemic in spots like this.  Hip spots with lots of students and recent grads who want to scope out the free internet havens.  I get it....the coffee shop wants you to get your coffee, hang out for approximately 2 hours and leave.  I'm sure this is not the case...and that people hang out enough that they could easily put on an apron and handle orders behind the counter.  So long story short, this place is PACKED.  Packed like you usually have to take a couple laps to find a free table....or even lone chair!  It's a little annoying. Plus, you're most likely going to see what the person next to you/on top of you is doing.  Oh, sweet game of chess there dude....\n\nOh yeah, my chai was okay, Oregon Chai Mix (my third fav after a homemade mix or Intellegentsia).

I was missing one of my favorite breakfast treats as I haven't indulged in them since moving here from Chicago.  They had been open about an hour but there was stuff that belonged in a store room on some of the tables.  Someone was mopping around me constantly and there was a rolling rack filled with Christmas cookies in the middle of the floor.  It's pretty drab and the 3 boards with their offerings are really hard to read.  The chalk is really light and it's really dim.  It's hard to know where to go when you walk in or what you're supposed to do.  I didn't really feel all that welcome honestly.  There were some old salads in a sparsely supplied case.  The bagels were in another.  I thought about getting a breakfast sandwich but didn't see a flat top or gas burner.  I did see a microwave and assumed the worst.  Microwaves take the micronutrients right out of your food.  I don't go out and pay restaurants to throw my food in a microwave.  There's no place for them except Panera!\n\nI ordered an everything bagel and a sesame bagel with cream cheese.  I'm giving this place 3 stars because for Pittsburgh, these are good bagels.  They're better than Einsteins or Bruggers by a long shot and I don't ever recommend you go to Panera.  I support local businesses so this place gets my vote as the best of these but it's not too much to choose from.  They don't have that nice thin crisp crust I like, they are chewy but a little light for me.  The flavor was a shade doughy.  I'm not sure they have the space to retard them overnight or exactly how they're being made so I can't go into their failing in specifics.  The everything bagel doesn't have everything!  Where's the salt?  Where was the onion and garlic?  It's not an everything bagel.  The 2 bagels and cream cheese were $6.  Seems like a lot to me.

Their burnt almond torte desserts in particular receive a lot of well deserved attention.\n\nThis particular Prantl's Bakery is one that I admittedly can't get to easily, due to the number of people who visit Shadyside (a neighborhood with very limited parking). So when I was in the area this weekend I absolutely had to stop in and take advantage of the fact that I was nearby. After walking in I thought I was in heaven - the smell of the baked goods was just soooo good! The place was pretty hopping so I was able to browse and see what was available while waiting for my number to be called; during the wait I watched fresh muffins, cookies and more being set out for people to buy. So I can definitely testify to just how fresh the goods here are - even one hour before closing they were putting out trays that had just come out of the oven.\n\nFair warning, the hardest part about visiting Prantl's is leaving with a reasonable number of goodies. I dare you to try to stop in for \"just one treat.\" They have cupcakes, cakes, \"cups\" (which are basically mini cupcakes with lots of amazing icing and toppings), pastries, muffins, and more, all made in a range of flavors - all fresh, all baked to perfection in my experience.\n\nI ended up leaving with 8 cups (2 cookies & creme, 2 almond torte, 2 peanut butter and chocolate, and 2 white chocolate and raspberry) that I've left in my car so I'm not tempted to snack on them all at once. So far I've eaten two of them and they've just melted in my mouth...exactly like a really good, fresh and moist dessert should, as far as I'm concerned.\n\nSo seriously - Prantl's is amazing. Go there, buy something, it's totally worth it!", "business_id": "yWVY1Bq19lDxu3BP7_96EQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-01-18", "type": "review"}

These are far from our tastes, but they compensate (in our eyes) by taking good care of what they have. The TVs aren't even old flat screens, but they do stock the rooms thoroughly with l'occitane.\n\nWhere this place really shines is in the staff and the food. I actually find this aspect to be _better_ or even _much_ better than many celebrated big-city five-star properties. When was the last time that the night staff pulled some food from the refrigerator (gratis) after a midnight arrival caused by flight delays?\n\nThey make everything in-house and it is all extraordinary. On this last visit, I indulged in their traditional french toast with a side of eggs. I forgot that this all includes an additional course in advance with fruit (not just big grocery store chucks of melon) and house-made cookies and muffins. On each visit, they mix these up. For this December visit, they did gingerbread cookies (of course). The Chef (Jackie), from NYC, could be gainfully employed high up the hierarchy of any top big-city restaurant.\n\nThere is no elevator, so either pack light if you want a room on the 3rd floor or choose a 1st or 2nd floor room. The 1st floor room has double doors so I didn't find it any noisier than the others.

Although the setting was lovely and the staff was welcoming, the food was nothing special, in fact, it was bad.

(I don't think the size of all three of the sandwiches put together was as big as one piece of white bread).\n\nWe were offered two types of scones:  cranberry and eggnog.   Neither was anything special, eggnog had absolutely no taste whatsoever!\n\nThen, the pastries:  we were served a gingerbread cupcake which was fine--nothing like Vanilla Pastry Shop!  A pumpkin torte, again, fine.  And a chocolate mousse/brownie bite with a raspberry and candy cane on top--it was dry as a bone!  It looked as if it was on it's last legs--chocolate was turning white, mouse separated from brownie.  Yuck.  \n\nOh yeah--I had a delicious tea from Harney and Sons (used to be sold at the Grand Floridian High Tea in Disney World), cinnamon spice!!!

Every time I walk into Lotus Foods in the Strip I'm hit with a certain smell and it's always so dusty. It's awesome to be able to go to a grocery store that's small enough to keep their stock fresh. I also really appreciate how dedicated they are in keeping their store as Japanese as possible.\n\nThey stock the staples in Japanese beverages and snack foods as well. It's so hard to find Pocari Sweat and other soft drinks in Pittsburgh that you'd find in any vending machine in Japan but Tokyo stocks it in a variety of bottles; chilled or room temp. I always buy a big bottle of Pocari Sweat when I visit to put in the fridge. If you've never had it, it's a sports drink that has a hint of grapefruit. The grapefruit is so subtle that there is almost no aftertaste. It's almost like water but not sickeningly sweet like flavored water in the US.\n\nThey also have prepared foods available by an in-house chef. They come in the form of bento boxed lunches that have sushi and tempura and, while I haven't had one yet (some day I'll remember to go before I eat), they look delicious and fresh and are packaged in an appetizing way.\nIf you're Japanese and have never heard of this place you should definitely check it out. It's an incredibly authentic grocery store and just as clean as one found in Japan. If you're an American and are a bit jaded about Asian grocery stores because of the dirtiness and grumpiness found in many of the ones in Pittsburgh definitely check Tokyo out, it's incredible.\n\nUPDATE: It took me until just a few weeks ago to try out their bento lunches. They're healthy and delicious. They'll heat the bento up for you on premises if you're eating on the go. The owner of Tokyo has also recently started selling his bentos and sushi in Lotus Foods in the Strip.

There are strange items missing though...white corn, brining kits, chicken cloth, thick cut peppered bacon, fresh calves liver, tulips, anchovy stuffed peppers at the antipasto bar, store made salad dressings, pico de gallo for instance.  And in spite of having a HUGE kosher section they do not carry Empire brand frozen chicken fat (schmaltz). Back home if you asked for something they would order it for you.  My only negative experience at Giant Eagle  was with the Kosher deli associate who wasn't at all helpful along these lines. Everyone else has been great! Including the store security guard who helped me find things my first time in the store.", "business_id": "Tfysaq2SdZAc5_TyPpuyLA", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-12-10", "type": "review"}

Period, end of discussion. Generally, I think monopolies are very bad, and this goes double for grocers because they know their customers are held hostage and can thus attempt whatever fuckery they'd like. Over the past decade, most other Giant Eagle locations in Pittsburgh's East End were shuttered, meaning that the Negley/Centre store serves everyone. \n\nPerhaps my biggest gripe with \"Market District\" is that our bills at this Giant Eagle were consistently 15-18% higher than our bills at any other grocery store, in any city I've shopped in - and that's WITH the coupons and Advantage Card \"discount\" added on. I guess in the end, calling something a Market District Giant Eagle is a clever way of telling customers \"We stock all the same crap you'd find at a regular store, but now we can charge you even MORE for pretending it's premium, organic, or has been blessed by Emeril Lagasse.\" You also need to know that over-crowding is unavoidable at this store, unless you like to start your errands around 10 PM, and even then, it's helpful to remember that customers exceed checkout lanes. Good thing we lived within walking distance of this location, because parking at this store is only marginally easier than driving a caravan of elephants through Midtown NYC at rush hour. \n\nThis store was never wanting for basic grocery staples when we shopped, but the \"Market District\" moniker somehow demanded that the aisles be set up to be as maximally non-sensical as possible. Do you want juice? Save your sanity, and don't expect it to be near the other juices...you'll want to look near the pasta, of course! To keep you on your toes, the store managers also randomly change the aisles at this Market District around a couple times a year. This is a common retail trick, intended to create \"excitement\" among customers, but really, all it does is make getting groceries as enticing as getting kicked in the balls. And who is stocking the produce at this place? Everything we bought would rot between 24-48 hours after we brought it home, and the peppers and tomatoes regularly looked like Mickey Rourke's face after his plastic surgery disasters.\n\nMy last visit to this Market District store left me with an exceedingly sour taste in my mouth, thanks to some shady hijinks at the pharmacy. We picked up my husband's script for a Schedule II medication, and soon after, discovered to our mutual horror that the pharmacy had shorted us 12 pills. 1 or 2, maybe 3 - that's an innocent mistake. A 12 pill shortage on a 30-pill prescription means someone chose a career in pharmacy to feed an addiction or run a little hustle on the side, and it means my husband will be going without. We asked the manager, \"Dude, what the fuck,\" and the response we got was, \"We didn't do nuthin'!\" Two weeks later, they had the nerve to Robo-Call my husband asking if he was interested in some \"valuable grocery coupons.\" Nice attempt at a save there Bub, but next time, don't snatch our money and we won't need those \"valuable\" coupons after all. (Isn't it also fascinating that we've been shorted on scheduled meds at other pharmacies before, but no one pockets our migraine meds, antibiotics, or other items you can't sell to teenagers in an alley?)\n\nTwo stars because the check-out staff is nice and the pasta/kosher deli selections rock. Otherwise, it's a grocery store, and a below-average one at that.", "business_id": "Tfysaq2SdZAc5_TyPpuyLA", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-02-09", "type": "review"}

It is ALWAYS crowded - I don't care what time of day or day of the week you go - it is always insane which is great for their bottom line, but not so good for their customers who end up feeling a wee bit claustrophobic in such environments.  The store has a wide variety of ethnic foods, which are sectioned off together but if I can't remember that the red pepper flakes that I bought were from the Mexican aisle then I waste time wandering around trying to find them.  I just don't like the set up and despite how large the store is it really does feel like it closes in on you because people tend to congregate in the aisles and block your passage - it's just unpleasant.  It's also expensive - just as expensive as it's competing neighbor down the street Whole Foods.  Also, the employees are mostly just not very nice - they act like they are doing you a favor to even bag your groceries at the checkout lines and god forbid you use the self checkout because I guarantee you will wind up behind someone who knows nothing about technology or how to scan their own items or heaven forbid use a coupon at the self checkout.  You will waste a LOT of time shopping here.\n\nEven on its worst days, the inside of Whole Foods is navigable and doesn't feel claustrophobic - it's just the parking lot that is the problem, so if I'm going to spend just as much money buying my organics and healthy food at Whole Foods as I would at the Market District, and endure snobby hipster employees versus resentful and rude employees, well, fuel points be darned, I'm going to brave the Whole Foods parking lot and shop there instead.  \n\nI gave this store 3 stars because they do have a great selection of products and now have the additional bonus of selling beer and hard cider, which is nice except for the fact (and huge hassle) that you have to pay for your alcohol in the cafe area and then you must go wait in line again to purchase your groceries - it's just not a convenient set up and I realize that is due to the PA State Liquor Laws but it is maddening and almost makes it not worth it most of the time.", "business_id": "Tfysaq2SdZAc5_TyPpuyLA", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-01-30", "type": "review"}

I placed an ordered only to come in the very next day to have it changed.  When the nice young man was trying to explain to me what happen a RUDE old lady interrupted him and talked to him like he was crap.  Then she proceeded to tell me that what I ordered they don't do?!  I ordered a filled donut with fruit.  They decided to mix the fruit with buttercreme becuase that's just how they do it.  The young man who had taken the order didn't know this at the time.  Fine.  I asked \"why wasn't I called and told this so I can cxl the order as it's not what I wanted\".  They said \"good question\".  But..........So then I asked if they were willing to make it right and not charge me for the 4 out o 6 donuts that were mixed with creme.  They thought that was completely unreasonabe.  I asked well then \"how about 1/2 off\".  The old snot was very reluctant to do that but did and acted as tho I was getting the deal of a lifetime.  I would have just walked out but I specifically orered what I ordered to take somewhere.  I asked for the managers name and she said they didn't have one but I could call Ron (the owner) in the morning.  When I called Ron he was a bigger jagof then the two old bitches that work there!!!!!!!  He said \"well you got them 1/2 off and most people would be pretty happy about that\".  REALLY????  No apologies and no offer from him to make it right.  Just complete attitude!!!  Guess what Ron your stuff is not that fantastic that you can afford to act like an asshole, have assholes working for you, change people's orders to suit what you want to make and not tell them and then especially not be willing to \"make it right\".\n\nI will NEVER go back and will tell everyone I know what an asshole you and the old ladies you have working for you are!!!", "business_id": "jc23sKVXBHM8WNLeDE3Eug", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-02-12", "type": "review"}

The grand opening was January 22, 2015. Now that the word is out about the place being finished it is always packed and finding a parking space can be a chore.\n\nI just don't understand why it took Giant Eagle so long to turn this location into a Market District. They are headquartered in the Fox Chapel/ O'hara Township area after all.\n\nIt's set up pretty much just like the somewhat larger Robinson location. For people who don't know, The Market District is a more upscale part of Giant Eagle, a supermarket chain based in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe best way to describe this place is Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, Wine & Spirits, Walgreen's and The Strip District all in one place! \n\nTake the cheese section for example. Every type of cheese you could think of and even some you have never heard of. Not sure what a particular cheese tastes like? No problem, they will give you a free sample.\n\nThe amount and quality of the meat department is just mind blowing. Everything from beef to lamb, pork, chicken and so much more! Need some spices for the meat you just purchased? No problem. There is a spice and olive oil section. Vegan or prefer to dine Gluten Free? The Market District has that covered as well.\n\nThe seafood section is just as massive covering just about the entire ocean.\n\nThere is also a ethnic area that covers just about the entire globe including Italy, Germany, Spain and Africa. If you don't want to cook and bring home a quick dinner then check out the Cafe. The cafe has every type of food you can imagine. A pizzeria, a hibachi station, Indian, Sushi, a quesadilla station, a coffee shop, gelatos, a salad bar just to name a few.\n\nThe bakery will even give Oakmont Bakery and Bethel Bakery a run for their money. Lots of different cakes, cookies, pies, doughnuts and so much more.  \n\nThere is even a cosmetic section that carries all the hard to find skin care products like Bare Minerals and Aveeno.\n\nI like this Market District location better than the East Liberty/ Shadyside location because it is closer to my house and the aisles here are bigger and finding a parking space is nowhere near as hard.\n\nI will be here often!", "business_id": "AK8T92URfkOUoTAVd7l2EA", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-01-28", "type": "review"}

They now sell six packs...and shockingly, their prices for beer are reasonable and the selection is decent. They price gouge on everything else, so why aren't they being asshats about beer? I don't understand it, but I won't question it. They also have a little bar area where you can order beer and wine. It's totally bizarre to me that people can now get a buzz on at the grocery store, but again, I won't question it. \n\nJust because I gave you one more star does NOT mean that we're friends, Giant Eagle. I still hate you. But now I have beer to help me forget just how much I hate you.  :)\n\nPS - They also have a cafe now that serves food, but I've found the quality to be underwhelming.", "business_id": "AK8T92URfkOUoTAVd7l2EA", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-02-23", "type": "review"}

We enjoyed the pumpkin patch, covered wagon ride and petting zoo. 3 stars for those features. That day we decided to book their small barn as the location for our son's first birthday party to be held the first weekend in December. They were very nice and explained how we'd be able to use the pot belly stove as well as the fire pit just outside the barn. We were excited about the barn and the wagon ride to the petting zoo for our guests. We asked if they would have Christmas decorations up at that time and they said they would not.  A month before the party we confirmed with them that we were still booked and that there would not be Christmas decorations. Everything was set. Five days before the birthday party we drove by and were surprised to find the barn had been converted to Santa's Workshop. They explained that our party would be in \"the enclosure on the hill\". We weren't thrilled to hear that but went to check it out. The enclosure turned out to be an aluminum carport with hay bales for walls on only two sides and a gravel floor and 6 picnic tables crammed inside. We had been told we were getting a rustic and whimsical barn with a stove and now our son's first birthday party with 35 adults and 17 kids was going to be held in a carport. We were not happy and explained that this was not going to work. They said that we couldn't have the party in the barn as originally promised (by the owner) and that they always had Christmas decorations there in December. They tried to accommodate us by saying they could put hay down in the carport and add patio heaters but the carport was completely unacceptable.  We will not be going back to Hunter Family Farm.

I ordered, Waited, Watched (ppl come in with some sort of VIP card)  and Wondered \n\n(** are you keeping count.. thats 3 Ws**)\n \nwhat all they fuss about this card this guy and the next lady had. Welll, I didn't ask. (I don't come often enough to really care) but thought it was some secret coffee society type thing.\n\n*** My last vist (as in the last time I went, NOT the last time I'll go) I stopped in for some Chi Tea.... pretty good. \n\nThe service is always \"friendly\", quick, and the to point. \nPrices are good.\nIts a little tight when crowded.\n\nGo Enjoy\n(Ask about the card thingy-majig if you dare.... ekk ekkk ekkkkkkkkk!!!!!!)", "business_id": "5j704vZBOmW88yJLhnCOEA", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-01-18", "type": "review"}

What do i have to do to get one.\n\nHe was clutching his stomach at that point.\n\nAnyway, he gave me one. (still don't know what it does) and rang me up. I left with a \"customer card\" (see picture), cup of Jo, and still unsure what I asked for in this card. \n\nI guess i'll tape up my hands, do push ups and wait to see. \n\nlol\n\ngo enjoy!!", "business_id": "5j704vZBOmW88yJLhnCOEA", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-01-23", "type": "review"}

However, it is the employees that make this one special. I am a student at JWU, so it is conveniently right there, but I would choose this Starbucks even if I had to drive. \n\nThe only downfall, which is the reason why I had to knock one star down is parking. I understand the issue of having a store in general in Uptown, you will always have a problem with parking, but somedays it is almost impossible to get parking. Especially on game days when the prohibit parking on all streets near the stadium. I just wish they would allow some parking for Starbucks customers. \n\nAnother note. If you don't want to wait in line, do not go between 7 -9am and 11-1pm.

I only wished that CoffeeWorks had more than one flavored coffee available for the day.  I saw a wall of glass jars full of many, many flavors for coffee that they sell by the bag.  The coffee sizes were reasonably priced, too.  My only suggestions for them would be to (1) create a more relaxed seating area indoors other than basic tables and (2) switch to something besides the environment unfriendly styrofoam cups.  Otherwise, keep up the great work (and flavored coffees!); we'll be back!", "business_id": "2ZQ3EzJVjPkVCk4HLwKIag", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-12-11", "type": "review"}

Loving all things carbs, I checked online and they were open early. Such a nice change for a morning person like me since many things in Charlotte don't seem to be open early on the wknd! I walked in there and this place is HUGE! Of course the other thing I noticed was the smell of fresh breads being baked, so many flavors, so little time. IHowever, it was filled not only with bread but an inventory of dips, chutneys, sauces, etc. They also have a cart with dry soup mix that is gluten free and looked pretty tasty. \n\nI wasn't sure what to get there so I went with Rosemary Garlic loaf to get something with flavor. This girl cooks a lot of Italian food so I am sure I can incorporate it in a meal somewhere. They have toaster and round loaves-which just mean the size of the loaf (I had no clue what they meant when they asked this so I just said toasted in an inquisitive way). Their bread has no artificial ingredients or preservatives and according to their website, shouldn't be refrigerated but can be frozen (they gave me extra bags when I told them I want to freeze mine). \n\nThey also have a bread card where you buy 12 loaves, you get one free. When I saw others put three $$$ for price on here, I don't agree. The loaves are about $5 a pop and most bread at the supermarket is an average of $3 so I don't think the price is too high, especially for freshly baked bread without preservatives or artificial ingredients. I dig how they have the nutritional info on their website so you can see what you're taking in. They also have sandwiches there besides bread so if you're looking for a quick treat, you should stop on in! \n\nTwo Citipass coupons--one for a free loaf, the other is for BOGO sandwich.", "business_id": "q6liXMxYTMYx7evcgz1eQQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-01-22", "type": "review"}

Besides a small and rotating selections of freshly baked breads, this shop also offers a number of sweet treats and other baked goods, all of which deserve a try.  They also offer lunch sandwiches, made with their bread and your choice of meat and/or veggies.  \n\nFor me, this is usually a breakfast time stop, especially on Saturdays.  They make some of the biggest cinnamon rolls I have ever seen- in both a low fat and a fully-leaded version.  If you're not feeling so sweet, their scuffins (that's a mix between a muffin and a scone) are a solid choice.  Add in a cup of their fresh-brewed counter culture coffee and you're all set to start the day in the right way.\n\nDo check their web site or stop in and pick up a monthly calendar to see what their baking for that month.  Speciality breads change monthly, but there are standards that remain- such as Friday's cinnamon chip and their honey wheat loaves.  On certain days they also do gluten free breads, for those who need it.  \n\nBe aware that on some baking days breads may not be available until about noon  You can always stop in and place your order early to make sure you have it waiting for you.  You can call in your order too.\n\nPrice wise, you'll pay a little more than your average supermarket, but then I think you are getting a better product that you know was made locally and fresh.  Their speciality breads are also things you won't find at the average market (cherry and white chocolate chip anyone?).  \n\nI also love that the owners are big supporters of the local running scene.  If you have done any local 5K or greater, chances are better than not these guys are at the finish line offering you a fresh slice off one of their loaves.

I'm not a dull knife in the drawer, and it took me a little while to figure out the, um, theme of the burger joint. Snoop's...as in detectives...snooping...i saw a Bond poster too. Ok, sure...I didn't really care about the overall ambiance as long as the food was solid. \n\nAnd how about the food? Well, it's pricier than other old school grilles - to the tune of $15+ for two 1/3 lb. burger combos and a corn dog. This wouldn't really bother me much if the food was better. The burger was fine - passable, but very well done (as in quite brown) and essentially flavorless. Onion rings were clunk-ily breaded and with little flavor and fries were \"meh\" overall. I was looking for the salty little slivers of love with some crisp! \n\nService wasn't super inviting and the cash register attendant didn't even hint at a smile when we ordered.

He did point me to kosher foods, and when I was in the isle he gave further assistance. This is what I saw. A few boxes of matzoh on bottom shelf one two boxes of some other stuff, and some....HANUKKAH Candles  and also Shabot candles. One thing I can not stand is not knowing what you carry. Nobody try to say it is not his fault, or he may have not known.I just got upset that when I asked he said NO with a very sure voice.

My suggestion, independent establishments like these should encourage their customers to buy reusable sleeve or RECYCLE they ones they use by placing a  \"sleeve reuse\" stash next to the cash register. I mean take Starbucks for example, they waist sooooo much sleeves on a given day and people don't even think twice to reuse their own. If people were more aware of this, it would definitely help people become more conscious about their contribution to waste.

From start to finish, the entire experience was just bad.  I'm all about second chances, but nothing about this place makes me ever want to go back.\n\nHaving not been to this part of town in quite some time, it took me a while to piece together that I had been to the shopping center this coffeeshop is housed in before.  In fact, although I'm not 100% sure, I believe I'd actually visited the coffeeshop many years ago.  However, it was operating under a different name and likely different owners at the time.  If my memory serves me correctly, it was a much better establishment back then.\n\nIn route to work, with some time to spare, I decided I was hungry and in need of coffee.  I pull off of the unfamiliar 485 exit and explore the shopping center.  Seeing the coffeeshop was a win that filled me with joy.  Joy that would soon be squashed.\n\nUpon entering I saw other guests seated in the small interior engaged in their personal conversations.  That said, no one was in line or waiting at the counter for beverages.  Two workers stood behind the counter and didn't offer so much as a hello.  I'm not looking for a robotic yell, like that of CiCi's or Cold Stone employees, but a simple acknowledgement would've gone a long way.  Instead, I got nothing.  In fact, the girl looked me up and down, even making eye contact, and waited for me to address her before begrudgingly strolling over to the register.  That and the handwritten sign offering refills starting at $1 should've told me it was time to leave.\n\nI proceeded with my order only to be told my one coffee was a mere $6.  \"Come again?\"  I thought to myself the coffee must be pretty good.  After all, there were others who had clearly coughed up the money, and the place had to be doing something right in order to be in business.  Wrong again.  Easily the worst cup of coffee I've ever had.  I couldn't even choke it down and wound up throwing out more than half of it.  It was so overly sweetened that I may as well have been drinking straight from the flavor syrup bottle.  \n\nOverall, I felt the coffee and pastry offerings were limited, and lacked originality.  The store felt dirty, the goods were overpriced, and getting into/out of the shopping center was rather odd.  The service was laughable, and I have zero desire to ever go back.  The quality of the coffee could be easily surpassed by the likes of McDonald's, and to true coffee drinkers, that says a lot.\n\nI wish them the best on their continued business adventure, but I'll surely not be recommending them to anyone I know.", "business_id": "_SEXb8Q6KIGAR7VlWBGKmg", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-01-30", "type": "review"}

YUM.   Unfortunately, it's not really that \"lite\" as the name might suggest.  For under 100 calories, I go for the Northern Lite Raspberry Latte.

The meats and cheeses are a little too pricey for my budget, but I love looking at them in the cases nonetheless.

Since we weren't going immediately home, I couldn't stock up on all the things I wanted to.  Refrigerated items don't tend to do well in car trunks for hours.  \n\nI did browse and buy some of their fresh spices, though.

I usually go with the bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich on a bagel of my choosing  Their bagels are all good to me, so I usually make my decision based upon what is hot at that particular time - just look for the signs on the bagel bins. \n\nIt has been my experience that a slight crowd can develop here later in the mornings usually between 10 - 11am, so I usually try to get there before then.  But even if you get stuck in a bit of rush - no worries!  The attendants are usually very prompt in their service and get you in and out as quickly as possible.  There is plenty of parking in the plaza and as another reviewer has stated, once upon a time they had free wi-fi though I do not know if this is still the case. \n\nIf you live anywhere in north Charlotte or near the University Area, I really do not know where you are going to find a better bagel option than Bruegger's.

I usually try to get there kind of early and leave before it gets busy so I'm not taking up a table. I bought a big breakfast (as described above) and sat down to work.

He asked if I was aware of their \"new policy\" about Wi-Fi on Sunday mornings, and how they don't want people just hanging out using the internet when it gets crowded. (No sugar coating, that's almost verbatim what he said.) For the record, I wasn't actually using their wi-fi, I was writing. Whatever. His point was obvious. I stared at him for a few seconds because I couldn't believe that a proprietor was actually asking me, a paying customer, to leave when I had been there only an hour and in fact still had toast on my plate. He suggested it was fine for now but that when it started to get crowded I should get out. I said that if that's how they felt I would leave now, and he responded, \"That's exactly how we feel.\" I was shocked, and still am. I have never, NEVER been treated so disrespectfully in a place of business. And I'm a regular, paying customer!! I always leave a tip!

The other textural problem is that Cold Stone ice cream melts too fast, so bring a gross of handi-wipes when bringing the kiddos here. \n \n* Flavor - The ice cream here is too sweet.  At Cold Stone, it is all about excess, whether it be about the butterfat content, the sugar content or the oversaturated flavorings.  Again, it's not terrible, but it's just not my cup of tea.\n\n* Serving Size - The theme of excess carries over to the over-the-top serving sizes.  While I am not a huge fan of froyo, at least I can control my serving size when I visit the near-by Menchies or Orange Leaf.  In addition, while I'm on the topic of serving sizes, can I just add that I detest the cutesy \"Like It\", \"Love It\" and \"Gotta Have It\" serving size names.\n\n* Service - When the place first opened, the staff was energetic and responsive.  I admit it was hokey, but I kinda liked the dorky songs they sang when you left a tip.  But now, a trip to Cold Stone is more like visiting a gulag.  Leaving a tip rarely triggers a response, much less a chorus of \"Ice cream, baby\" sung to the tune of Ice, Ice Baby.  My other pet peeve is that the tables always seem to be sticky, thanks to the soupiness of the ice cream.  It's really kind of a depressing place to visit now.\n\n* Pro tip: If you have a peanut allergy, have them clean the stone before they mix your ice cream or you risk cross contaminating your treat.  (I learned that the hard way.)", "business_id": "AYoLKzRFajucKnjIFxc__A", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-02-16", "type": "review"}

It is never too sweet or too oily.  The right use of butter also gives a desirable texture as well.

I've never done the tour or hung out in the Bier Stube, though they're both on my list, but between Memorial Day and Halloween I try to make my way over to Terrace Avenue as often as possible.  It's also become somewhat of a tradition amongst my friends to go to Bockfest in February as well as wait in line for Great Taste tickets in May.  These are good times in their own regard, but the best times I've had here are just the random summer nights spent sitting at a picnic table with friends or watching a band playing on stage.  On weekend nights during the summer the place gets packed, especially if a band is playing.  And while it's pretty easy to find Capital beers on tap or at stores throughout the area, nothing beats fresh from the brewery.  As an added bonus, you can often get the seasonals or other less prominent beers on tap here as opposed to the bottles prevalent elsewhere.  This past summer my go-to was the Wild Rice Lager, as well as the Supper Club lager on the really hot nights.  There's even a few wine choices for the non-beer drinking crowd, including Wollersheim's Prairie Fume.  \n\nI've got a decent history going on with the Bier Garten, as this was one of the places I went on my 21st birthday.  My buddy purchased me one of the half-liter plastic mugs as my birthday present.  I've still got it to this day, and I bring it with every time I go out.  Suffice it to say, however much that mug cost has been more than offset by the reduced cost per ounce offered by the mug.  If you're planning on coming back I definitely recommend making the investment.  It beats the regular 16 oz plastic cups and I'd hazard a guess it's comparable to getting a pitcher, without the necessity of coming to agreement on what beer to order.\n\nThere isn't any food service whatsoever, but it's perfectly fine to bring in your own with you.  My personal go-to is Gino's, but there's plenty of places nearby and I believe you can ask for take-out menus of local restaurants up at the counter.  I've even ordered Falbo's for delivery pizza a couple times - just meet them outside the gate by road.  Capital's also put up a large tent over most of the picnic tables, which helps when the weather is inclement.  Mosquitoes are an issue, especially as the sun goes down, but this is Wisconsin so you've got to expect that.  The place closes down at 9:00 PM in deference to the residential nature of the area, which actually is a blessing in many ways.  On weekends it's a great start to the evening, and I really don't need to be staying out that late on weeknights anymore.", "business_id": "Wn8NhS-L1ck6jbTjX88Kkg", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-12-01", "type": "review"}

No one has reviewed this place yet?\n\nJenifer Street is the go-between market for those of us who don't necessarily want to shop at Woodman's but also don't want to spend a lump of cash at the Co-Op.  The selections here are good, the meats aren't bad (though they have far fewer local selections than they should), and the beer corner is just awesome.  Seriously, the beer corner is the best part of this store.  They even provide jackets for people to wear.  If that doesn't get you here, nothing will.\n\nThe produce is a mix of local and not, but it's a good mix.  I go here for pretty much everything when I don't want to drive too far for something.  The Co-Op is great, but it just charges FAR too much for a lot of things.  That is what drove me to Jenifer Street in the first place, and I've never looked back.  Sure, I still hit the Co-Op up for some things, but they're the things I know I can only get there.\n\nAnyway, this store is great and it's a neighborhood fixture.  It's cash only, but there is an ATM at the front door and when you get money out of it, you get a $1 coupon for shopping at the store.  That gives you the $1 back that the ATM took from you to get the cash.  VERY nice touch!!\n\nOverall, this is THE place I go to when I want to hit up a non-major outlet on the near Eastside.

Far past the expiration date; 2. Poor quality; 3. Stale. Of the expired items I can recall, one was a package of tortillas, purchased in the last few days that expired 12/09/13! Almost a full month past expiration! A month ago, I bought hummus. It didn't look right when I opened it (mold), & of course, it had expired 2 weeks earlier. Fortunately, we didn't eat the hummus. Unfortunately, we discovered the tortillas had expired in the middle of dinner. \n\nThere've been a handful of instances where rolls/breads are stale, particularly from the bins by the registers. Rolls weren't just hard on the outside or a day past fresh-baked, we're talking inedible. It's incredibly disappointing too, when you're looking forward to good bread. \n\nThen there's the deli, where there's been a few issues. \n\nDeli issue #1: My wife bought sliced deli meat, a cut known for being fatty, but this one was overly so. It was slimy, chewy, tough, flavorless, & ultimately inedible. It was the first time I've returned meat. I'm a carnivore. I've had hackepeter, steak tartare, tripe, chitlins, sheep brain, sheep testicle... things most people won't eat. This particular deli meat however, was a few steps beyond. \n\nDeli issue #2: More an observation, which now prevents me from buying from the previously liked, pre-made deli salad section. One time at the deli counter, I saw a JSM worker \"clean\" the front of the pre-made salad case, from the inside, with a towel. Mind you, none of the salads were taken out of the case or covered for the cleaning process. So when this worker brought the towel back out of the case, I was aghast to see a dirty towel, with all sorts of crumbs, crumbles, food pieces & products, being carried haphazardly, over uncovered salads. I saw some bits fall from the towel, over the salads, as it was brought out of the case. \n\nDeli issue #3: A JSM worker cut slices of meat & cheese, kindly packaging them with care. However, he did so without gloves & without washing his hands. I was pretty much done with the JSM deli at this point. \n\nYou can have all the locally produced, environmentally friendly, organic, small batch, artisan &/or handmade, gluten-free, nonsense all you want. It does no good however, when it's stored in unclean, unsanitary conditions, &/or expired all together. If I were a \"freegan\" I'd say this place was a rip-off. Everyone knows you can get spoiled foods in dumpsters behind most grocery stores, for free. I'd also make exceptions for small \"mom & pop\" businesses, but I have standards & limits. JSM has surpassed both. It's unfortunate since we like the place, or rather, we want to like it, but there are just too many problems.", "business_id": "MLD-FXAHLbdiHOcyeoW-Fg", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-01-07", "type": "review"}

Total hole in the wall on East Wash in a strip mall behind some Mexican buffet, with the name People's Bakery, you'd never guess this place would have the best Middle Eastern food in Madison.  \n\nStart with the wife of the wife and husband team, who greets you warmly as you come in.  The menu is on the wall, but there are hard copies for those who need an explanation of the nicely blended mix of Lebanese, Armenian and Syrian dishes.  No matter your experience with food of the Middle East or Mediterranean, you'll find dishes you recognize, perhaps by different names.\n\nThis was my first visit, I'm sitting here eating my takeout order as I type this because it's that good.  I ordered the lentil soup, and several appetizer portions including hummus, moohamara, sarma, and falafel.    \n\nQuick review:\n- lentil soup.  Awesome, just awesome.  Beautiful saffron color from the cooked down red lentils, just the right mix of cumin and lemon, and a back end of heat, I'm guessing from Aleppo pepper.  This is some thick soup, and filling, and for 2.50, you get a pint\n\n- Moohamara.  I wasn't going to get this.  I like roasted red bell pepper, and I've had dips and purees made of them, but I've never sought it out.  Mary, one of the owners, told me it was her favorite, best on the menu.  And holy COW was she right.  A smack of roasted red pepper is quickly deepened by a sweet hit of pomegranate and walnuts, ubelievably complex and wonderful.\n\n- Falafel.  Huge portion, perfectly deep-fried, with a really nice, light texture.  Love the falafel, but I prefer tahini sauce, and these come with a yogurt mint sauce.  Don't get me wrong, this is clearly their regional interpretation, Im all about the authentic experience, and this was good sauce.  But, I confess that for my leftovers I'm making some tahini sauce.\n\n- Hummus.  You know, hummus is always a crap shoot for me.  I make my own, from dried chick peas, and I've been working on this recipe for 25 years (along with my Bloody Mary recipe and about a hundred others). This is another of those regional interpretation issues, this was my least favorite today.  I'll try it again, because my own hummus has on and off days.  This was just more on the bland side than I expected,  No one distinct flavor dominated so I felt like it was left with an almost indescribable flavor.  Not bad, totally edible, just oddly unflavored.  I added some lemon and salt, which helped some.  \n\nSarma - if you're expecting dolmathes this will be familiar in flavor, but it texture.  These are served cold with a yogurt dipping sauce.  I'm okay with the temperature, but I just like a little lemon on mine.  These are veg, the rice filling is cooked down to a coarse 'risotto-y' consistency.  I dig them, but those who prefer the snap of dolmathes will find these softer, but just as flavorful\n\nAll in all, outstanding.

We were genuinely welcomed in and I knew People's Bakery was gonna be one of my new spots, having not even tried a single thing in the store.  \n\nWe ordered a lunch \"to-go.\"  I got a Shish Taouk (commonly known as a Chicken Shawarma) and my wife got a falafel sandwich and we split a side of Hummus.  Well, my Shish Tauok was plump with heavily marinated, tender chicken slices, tomatoes, tahina, and lettuce.  In short, it was outstanding.  Aggressive herbal flavors perfectly matched with a spike of lemony acidity.  My wife LOVED her falafel sandwich...which is really saying something, as she's somewhat of connoisseur.

For example, if you choose buttercream for your frosting, it will be smooth and sweet and creamy awesomeness in your mouth -- but on the cake, any colors will run and it can't hold complex shapes, so you're limiting yourself to very simple designs. Other frosting options exist, such as fondant and rolled white chocolate, and they each have their own set of benefits and limitations as well.\n\nIf you're good at research, you have some time to kill and you know what you're looking for, you can find a lot of this information on-line -- but when you're in the midst of the overwhelming task of planning a wedding, it would be so, so much easier to just sit down with a professional who can lay out all your options and explain the benefits and limitations of each one.\n\nUnfortunately, you won't find anyone like that at Carl's Cakes. Oh, Carl seems friendly, helpful and optimistic when you first meet him. The samples he gave us at our cake tasting were better than I ever knew cake could be, and when we asked about decorations, he was quick to assure us that he could \"do anything you want\". \n\nAfter our initial meeting with Carl, we surfed the Net for examples of memorable wedding cakes and cherry-picked the ideas we liked best until we had put together the perfect cake design. I'll admit it was on the moderately complicated side, but nothing exceptional by wedding cake standards; and after Carl's repeated assurances at the tasting that he could \"do anything you want\", we thought we were safe.\n\nBut once he has your deposit, his attitude changes. He's difficult to get ahold of by phone, and impossible to get ahold of by email. Suddenly, any design requests more complicated than the average birthday cake are answered with a simple \"I can't do that\". Even something as simple as multiple colors will be refused on the basis that the colors will bleed together. He never tries to suggest compromises or alternatives, and if you ask for them, he'll only tell you to come in and pick something from his generic book of designs.\n\nWhy all the limitations? Because Carl frosts his cakes with buttercream frosting -- and ONLY buttercream frosting.\n\nI've lost track of how many hours we spent on the phone going back and forth with Carl over the cake design, struggling to find something he could do that didn't leave us cold. Dealing with him wasted a large portion of the limited time we had to plan our wedding, and drastically increased our stress during an already stressful time. If I was rating his business purely on Customer Service, I'd have to give him 1 star.\n\nBut I'll also give credit where credit is due. In the end, he delivered our cake on time, in the flavors, size and design that we eventually agreed to. It was beautiful, if vastly simplified from our original design, and the flavor? To this day, our wedding cake is still the best thing I've ever had in my mouth. If I were rating his business purely on taste, I'd have to give him 5 stars. Heck, I'd give him 6 if it were possible.\n\nSo if you want the best cake you've ever had in your entire life, consider Carl's Cakes -- But consider very carefully. Give him an exact cake design and make ABSOLUTELY SURE he can do it without modifications BEFORE you give him a dime.", "business_id": "tE8MQ9I7E2_Xvm4AvykXrw", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-02-26", "type": "review"}

The \"buttercreams\" are made with shortening, and no butter at all.  Anyone who has tasted real buttercream knows that it is not as shelf stable or white as shortening frosting and tastes like real butter.  The chocolate cake has some kind of flavoring in it.  Fake rum, maybe?  I really think people buy these cakes because they don't know any better.  Perhaps the term \"buttercream\" is used loosely outside of Europe, but true buttercream is not a concoction of Sweetex (sweetened shortening, commercial grade) and some other fake ingredients.  Carl also is very stuck in his ways when it comes to design.  He's not on the cutting edge, he will only do certain designs that he's been doing since the 80s.  There will be no rolled fondont ribbons or pulled sugar flowers or bright colors.  If you want a simple cake, and don't mind that it is frosted with fake buttercream because that's what is more shelf stable and easy to work with, then go to Carl's.\n\nI see that since I posted my review Deb R. from Carl's Cakes commented.  Thanks for your comment and those pictures.  I can definitely tell which ones Carl decorated as opposed to other cake decorators working there.  The cakes with a very simple piping design and love birds have Carl written all over them.  The cakes that are more creative and interesting are done by other people.

I especially have a propensity for anything with frosting or that's fresh baked goods. I had heard that Carl's Cakes were fantastic with people getting them for their wedding and other family events so when I saw one at the local grocery store called grasshopper torte, I splurged and bought it.\n   The description on the cake says \"chocolate cake filled with chocolate and mint buttercream, iced in mint buttercream\". You see, I have a real weak spot for buttercream, real buttercream.\n   After dinner the family is pretty excited because we have cake for dessert so I took the lid off, sliced it and took my first bite. It was totally disgusting. At this point, I peeled back the store label to reveal the ingredients.\n   The ingredients read as follows: flour, sugar, eggs, milk, margarine, shortening partially hydrogenated soybean oil, partially hydrogenated palm oil with mono and diglycerides added baking powder, baking soda, cornstarch, salt, cocoa. The mint filling contains: alcohol, water and oil peppermint. Fudge filling contains liquid sugar, partially hydrogenated soybean and cottonseed oil, corn syrup, cocoa, water.\n   This ingredient label should just read crap, crap, and more crap with a side of hydrogenated crap and filled with trans fatty crap. This so-called super duper cake has no butter cream has no butter and barely has anything that's natural whatsoever. \n   So Carl, just a word of advice.

Here's a hint to the owners - you can't taste wine when you're smoking a cigar.  cognac, sure... bourbon For Sure... scotch, hell yeah!  Wine or beer?  No way.  Much like how a heavy smoker can't taste the subtle notes of fine cuisine, your palate will be a burned out blah, able only to recognize the meh of mediocre sweet washing away a quickly become stale, acrid ash.  I say this strongly to the owners, who are obviously ordering wine they cannot taste, because the offering here is terrible.  \n\nNow, for the record, I enjoy a good cigar (and they do have good cigars, (as well as really shitty ones - you have been warned)), but you've got to be very careful when you mix the two.  or, you'll end up with a place like this.  \n\nHere's the deal:\n\nAmbience: smoke filled; couches to the far wall, filled with people I don't know, who obviously do know one another; everyone watching badgers basketball game; shitty pop-ish music, feels like I'm crashing a college party.\n\nService: terrible - overly helpful, yet completely unhelpful.  Owner assumes that you don't know anything about wine, while he himself knows nothing about wine, making him look both condescending and foolish.  Owner confuses percentages of grape varietals for flavor, erroneously assuming that those factors alone, in isolation, make the wine.  Owner doesn't know enough about own stock to be able to recommend me a wine to match what I'm looking for.  Not, being able to find what I want, the owner then upsells me garbage, like a used car salesman, promising me it's the best such-and-such wine he's ever seen for this price.  Meanwhile, he's never once described what any of the wines actually taste like.  \n\nAt any rate, I took a risk and bought the recommendation - guess it must be the gambler in me.  Well, sometimes you win, and sometimes you loose... and this time, I lost.  The two wines that were supposed to be vastly different were suspiciously similar.  Both just a middle note of blah, one too sweet, one too thin.  Neither worthy of the price, the effort, the carbon footprint.  I've MADE better wine.  In the end, they were shitty wines, and it a shitty experience.  Which is too bad, because I was really looking for something nice.  \n\nIn all honesty, Copps, just down the street, actually has better wines, if you know what you're looking for.  Even if you don't, they have a larger selection, so you might as well roll the dice.  \n\nSo, my question to the owners is, did you get this wine because you thought it was good, because you couldn't taste it, or because it was cheap and you thought no one would care?  \n\nPS dry clean my cigar smoke soaked coat", "business_id": "6Y_Y3Nzzf9FsjyXtjIll7w", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-02-24", "type": "review"}

The first time I stopped in, I couldn't help but feel instinctively that this was one of those magical curiosity shops from my childhood books: all crowded aisles and dusty shelves piled to the ceiling with colorful fare.\n\nThe primary product sold here is tea (of course), and they've got plenty of it in all brands, flavors, and forms.  Thankfully, they carry Traditional Medicinals, a set of herbal teas that are invaluable for getting me through the cold/flu season.  Many of the big brand teas (Harrisons and Crosfield, Twinings, Stash, Republic of Tea, etc.) are available in both loose-leaf and teabag form.  Reluctant about paying $10 for a box of tea that you might not like?  You can make up your own variety pack by buying from their stock of individual tea bags (usually less than $0.50 per bag).  \n\nIf you're a novice and just want to sample different kinds of tea, there is also the route of buying some of their self-serve bulk tea.  In the winters, I am a big fan of the Seattle Market Spice; for summers, I usually pick a mild fruity tea (like black currant) for brewing ice tea.  I do question their storage method (left in transparent glass jars on open shelves) as I'm pretty sure tea is supposed to be kept somewhere dark and dry to maintain freshness.\n\nAside from a variety of teas, they also carry bulk spices, bulk coffee, tea cakes/biscuits, jams, chocolates, and soup mixes.  The shop owner will help grind your coffee upon request.  Most of the candy and snacks sold here are quality items produced by small or foreign companies not commonly found in regular grocery stores.\n\nShopping for a gift?  You can find teapots and teacups (both classic European-style ceramic and some of the Asian variety), as well as other tea-time accessories (including strainers, spoons, cloth napkins, etc.).  Some of the teas are sold in old-fashioned, decorative tins--these make charming presents for a tea-lover you may know.\n\nFor the total foodie maniac, this place may not be all that impressive in the products they carry, but it's still more than adequate for a town like Champaign.", "business_id": "bmGEYg9Xw9XmCQXgeZ_Pyw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-12-15", "type": "review"}

Tucked in the back corner is a little deli counter with homemade soups that change daily, sandwiches, salads, savory croissants from Pekara, cookies, you name it. The prices are reasonable considering the high quality of the food; a very filling lunch (large soup, croissant, and giant cookie) runs less than ten bucks and leaves you with enough leftovers for a light dinner. I almost hesitate to write this as quantities can be limited and I fear a soup shortage if word gets out! \n\nThe grocery selection is also good and features a lot of locally raised meat and, when seasonally available, produce. Lots of good bulk, speciality, organic, and vegan items as well. It's certainly more expensive than one of the chain grocery stores, but the food quality is much higher and they are usually less expensive than Strawberry Fields, which is pretty much their only direct competition. \n\nThe location is kind of odd during the winter months as it's located on the east exterior entrance to the old Lincoln Square mall, right next to Cardinal Fitness.

The staff here are always friendly and extremely helpful. They post recipes with the produce with ideas for how to use items that may be unfamiliar to some, which I really appreciate.

Chances are, the fine folks at Natural Gourmet can help you out.  Gaye and Co. are wonderful at helping you find just the right item, whether it's a food item, a natural personal care product, or just the right supplement.\n\nLocated just west of Biaggi's, Natural Gourmet is easy to find.  The store is small, but absolutely packed with goodies, from natural snacks to baking supplies to awesome bulk bins containing spices (both the usual and the not-so-usual), teas, and coffees.  They also have an entire aisle of various supplements, vitamins, and herbal remedies.  I always know exactly what I'm looking for when I go, but the employees, especially Gaye, the owner, are extremely helpful when you're not quite sure what you're looking for.  I have several friends who are regulars there, and all they have to do is describe their symptoms, and Gaye knows exactly what they need and where to find it.  She's amazing!\n\nThey also have an amazing selection of food items, particularly baking supplies.  They carry a wonderful array of teas, both loose and bags, and are the only store in town that carry one of my favorite varieties (although I'm not going to tell you what it is, because they're almost always running low on it when I'm there to begin with!!).\n\nNo place is perfect, and NG does have a few cons.  Produce selection is very limited, to the point of being almost nonexistent.  Also, the small space of the store means that items are very densely packed on the shelves, which is both a plus and a minus in my book.  True, shopping is efficient, but sometimes the shelves look a bit \"cluttered.\"  This probably won't bother most people.  Also, the aisles are very narrow, which could produce a problem with traffic congestion, but I avoid peak shopping hours and have never had a problem.  The other con is that they close at 6:00 PM, so if you do all your shopping in the evening, you're out of luck here.\n\nPrices are reasonable and on the whole comparable to Strawberry Fields; some items may be a little more, others a little less.  The energy of the place is far better than Strawberry Fields, in my opinion.

The last few times I've been there, there were crates of raw meat left out, unrefrigerated. I'm not sure what is going on with that. I know that when I leave meat out for a few hours, it won't be fully thawed. But that's just for personal consumption. There's got to be something banning this sort of thing. Even if there isn't, this is an unsavory practice as a business. Who knows how long the meat has been left out. Perhaps they're letting certain items thaw so that customers can cook immediately after purchase, but now I'm just justifying their behavior. I would avoid the meat. And I would avoid the produce.

If I was still in school, needed such a place, and they allowed smoking, I would give it 5 stars. Alas, those days are gone, so all I see this place as is a cafe with fairly decent sandwiches, meh soup, 2-3 choices for daily coffee (plus 1 type of daily decaf) for prices that are a little higher than I think is commercially reasonable.\n\nThe staff is friendly and the atmosphere is great: a very homey, anti-corporate coffee shop where the employees are friendly, competent and patient. The coffee itself is quite good, but I think Aroma (on the other side of the block) is a little better. The sandwiches are okay. They use high quality ingredients, but they are still just sandwiches. They definitely put thought and effort into the presentation of their meals, and this counts big in my book. Sandwiches come with a choice of healthy sides (apple, salad, Sun Chips).\n\nTheir soups are not great. Pekara and Aroma are better in this department, but they have good ideas (like today's pumpkin apple soup). Prices are a bit high: a half spinach salad with about 1/4 cup of tuna salad with a balsamic vinaigrette and a cup of that soup plus a large black coffee was $8.50 or so pre-tip. Get a sandwich with a small salad side and coffee and you are north of $10 real quick. If these prices don't make you immediately balk, please note that their portion sizes are not very big, and are at least third smaller than a meal at Guido's or Esquire. Not terrible if you have a small appetite, but this guy would leave hungry if not for the marvelous effect of strong coffee.", "business_id": "yzInxReAkf7r0aRbwj02Yw", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-02-17", "type": "review"}

They doubled their footprint when they moved into the place next store, but this expansion did not double their sales because the new part is always filled up with students occupying the same tables for hours on Kopi's WiFi, spending hardly any money.

The decor was not as quaint as I was hoping, more like old grandma grunts than chabby chic and garden like. Country not Victorian. Anyway, it was the experience we were looking for, and my wife had been here before. \nWell, we started off with a brand new waitress, nice girl, but zip on the training, than a girl with three months experience came out, again, no training.

What is the deal with that - for $19 bucks a pop I wanted my own pot of earl grey while my wife sipped on apricot! \nWell, one waitress was quitting that day and decided to slam her boss over and over again to us, we were about to leave when the owner came out - we said it was not the experience we were looking for, she apologized and the service got slightly better. Where were the tea cups - we had punch glasses and cracked porcelain with stains. No plates at first, the tea was nothing to write home about. \nMy daughters tea was ok, the cookie was boring, artless and lacking in any frosting or style. The finger sandwiches were pretty good - not quite British, more like deli style, but tasty. The scones a bit dry and the jam, maybe WalMart strawberry.  The worst was the dessert. COSTCO SPECIAL!

Given that Yelp never fails, the deceptively named La Tolteca Mexican Foods was presented before us as an attractive option. Hesitant as to whether it was actually just a Mexican grocery store, we hustled in to see what the buzz was about. Now, I know I live in the Northeast (veritable Mexican food desert), but \"Oh. My. Gahhhhhhhhhhhhh...\" This place is amazing. \n\nOne of the most appealing things to me about La Tolteca was its no-nonsense approach to everything. Food is ordered from a board menu above a counter and prepared in a small kitchen area in front of you. Slightly further back lies the grocery store component which does have an interesting (Maybe typical for Phoenix, but what do I know?) variety of Mexican groceries and specialties to recommend it. Back to the food though... that really was the main event. I ordered a chicken burrito which came out quickly and was f---ing enormous. Imagine the beams of light shining down from above when I turned around a spotted the salsa bar! I was able to taste all of their salsas including the piquant green chili pepper one which I am still thinking about. There's a vast dining area to the back where you can bring your food and beverage to gorge and take in this amazing experience. Maybe I just love Mexican food too much... Who knows, but I was really a happy camper here. \n\nWe looked over and spotted some people eating burritos that were literally the size of loaves of Wonder Bread, so consider that as one more reason to go (though even I, self-proclaimed food eater extraordinaire could not fathom eating one of those).

Walk up to the counter, order your food, wait for your number to be called, walk into the dining area (ducking under a low arch if you over 6' tall) where you are greeted with basic tables and chairs.  Seriously...if you didn't know you were in Phoenix you'd swear you were in an eatery in Mexico.  They also have a bakery and a market attached to the food counter.\n\nOn to the actual food.  As this was my first time here I ordered the chimi.  I usually do that so I have a basis for comparison to other places.  My wife had the albondigas soup.  We both liked our dishes.  The chimi was done perfectly.  A light crunch of the shell.  Not overcooked, not greasy.  The chicken was moist and tender.  And it was a pretty big chimi.  I think one does need to add some pico to it because the chicken's seasoning was very mild.  The pico added just a bit of flavor that really made the difference.  And the Mexican rice was very nice.\n\nI wish it wasn't so far from home (Gilbert) because I'd love to make this my \"regular\" spot for Mexican food.

What I find is the same old thing and more often than not- covered in dust. \n\nWhen I first walked into Pico Rico I was so please with the selection. Every row I went down I saw something new. There were plenty of varieties so even if it's not for a kids birthday party you'll find something great. Whenever I go back they always have new pinatas I hadn't seen before and something special for whatever holiday is near. The Christmas pinata I bought there was beautiful and unique, I got compliments on it. Their pinatas are very well made. I stuff them with at least 15 lbs. of goodies and they always hold up. On cheaper pinatas the wire will come out when there's too much weight inside. \n\nOther than pinatas they also have a huge selection of Mexican candy, some decorations and balloons.

That is not my review, but rather what is written on the side of the Ranch Market building. After reading other reviews of this place, I already had a feeling it was going to be good...but the Paradise Market...hmmm... Made me ask myself what my idea of a paradise market would be. ( In case you were wondering, it would include Gael Garcia Bernal, Alejandro Fernandez, Juanes and other latinos guapos pushing shopping carts... shirtless.)\n\nAnyway...focus!...Walking in from the parking lot, I could already hear lively music spilling out of the store. My blood started to sizzle with excitement. Then, right after crossing the threshold, I beheld a thing of dazzling beauty- carts and carts of aromatic and fresh pan dulce. I knew this place and I were just beginning a long and promising relationship. \n\nMy roommate and I wandered around the pan dulce display cases, salivating, pointing, giggling. We opted not to purchase as we have way too many holiday sweets left over as it is. We continued on to the jugeria where I had the best horchata I have had in a long, long time. Too much of the time horchata is watery. The Ranch Market horchata was so flavorful and creamy. I drank it just like a little kid who doesn't even let the straw leave their mouth for a moment. \n\nWe then wandered throughout the whole store. I know I probably looked awe-struck because it is overwhelming. It is bustling and frenetic and packed full of food treats, smells, conversation...LIFE. Be sure to pass by the tortilleria and take in the smell of freshly cooked tortillas. Also, don't miss the meats! Chicken feet! Tongue!  Tripas! Oh yeah! AWESOME! \n\nWho the hell would ever want to go to a Safeway again when shopping can be this entertaining?\n\nI'll be sure to go back soon for some pan dulce, a raspado or some lunch. More than anything, I'll go back for the experience because that's what this place is- a cultural experience.", "business_id": "VXIkI9_EbDbYHeO9IzKjJg", "stars": 5, "date": "2007-01-02", "type": "review"}

Forget the upscale breakfast and faux southwest shops that dot and line Scottsdale. Forget the 'burbs of Peoria, Goodyear, and East Mesa. Don't let your visiting family leave without making a trip down to the Phoenix Ranch Market on 16th st and Roosevelt. Yes, this is south of the I-10 freeway and far away from your faux mexican food at Macayo's Cantina. At Phoenix Ranch Market you'll find a side of the city that nearly all of the transplanted surburban population seems to want to ignore, or just completely forget. This is Phoenix being Phoenix, not Phoenix trying to be a new Los Angeles or anyplace else.\n\nAfter having breakfast at a carbon copy brunch eggery, I was in need of something less perfect and faux. I found exactly what I was craving. When you can hear the sounds of mariachi or radio campesina from your car parked at the other end of a packed lot, you know this isn't the local Kroger you're about to enter.\n\nPart grocery store, part food court, part village market, PRM is huge, it's overwhelming and it's surprisingly clean and comfortable - this isn't a low rent grocery like Food City. With a fresh seafood section two or three times the size you'd find anywhere else in Phoenix, and with parts of animals you've probably never prepared at home, it's fun to just look, but even more fun to buy. Want meat? Want better options? Better cuts? Want an entire skinned cow's head with the eyes intact and staring at you? Check. It's all SO GOOD.\n\nBut that's just the meats. They make their own tortillas onsite with a literal factory and small army of workers churning out the flat corn and flour awesomeness. Hungry? Want mexican food? Want great mexican food? ALWAYS consider going here. Think of anything on a restaurant menu and you have it here. Prepared fresh, and a la carte. Seriously. Tamales of any kind. Horchata! Cow Tongue! Burritos of immense size and stuffed with anything you want. Some of the best beans in town, rice, and parts from a pig that still actually look like parts from a pig. This isn't the mall food court.\n\nThe place is packed with mostly hispanic families but you'll also notice a few adventurous types, including my asian self. Most of the employees speak english very well so language is not a barrier. The only times you'll need help is when asking what is that? And like mentioned above, the answer just might be cow tongue (which by the way, is good, however I can see how the texture would turn some people off. Imagine a soft almost too mushy beef...)\n\nOh. The food is also cheap. You'll get more than full off of $5, you'll explode at $10. It's seriously like heaven here. Music, people, atmosphere, food, drinks, desserts, baked goods. All of it awesome. I met up with my friend Amy.The.Kidd for 'lunch' and we ended up spending almost 4 hours just walking around, back and forth, trying each new item we found, or trying the standards but knowing they were going to be better here. Mmmm. Horchata, great corn tamales, rice, beans, empanadas, warm fresh tortillas... bring everyone. This is a place that should be in people's minds when they think of Phoenix, not just the golf courses, or upscale Scottsdale, or Frat/Sorority Tempe... but South Phoenix. No matter how scary it is for suburban soccer moms to venture down there.\n\nPhoenix Ranch Market on 16th St and Roosevelt.

I experienced Ranch Market for the first time last summer. I'm not familiar with the holiday, but it's the one where they bake tons of cakes with little babies in them..? Someone help me here. Back to the point, it was EXTREMELY festive, and I don't know if it was the heat, or that I was tired, or that the place was just so decked out in colors and people and decorations, but I got sick. Sick to where I had to wait outside by the car for my company. Hilarious. Needless to say I was a little frightened, so it took a little while for the curiosity to pique again. \n\nSecond time was yesterday evening. Perhaps it was because instead of being a busy Saturday it was a slower (still busy, though) Tuesday that I was able to survive this visit. The boy decided to use it for a school project so I tagged along to see if I could help. The second we walked in the door however, all hope in my helping him was lost. My mind was in a frenzy as I decided where to stop first. The Jugeria for some Horchata? Or the restaurant for some asada? Or maybe the bakery for something sweet...? \n\nFound out the Horchata is way too sweet (but delicious) to drink alone so I shared with the boy. Grabbed some kind of sweet roll from the bakery that we practically fought over...and oh my! It was Taco Tuesday at the restaurant! I ordered 4 asada tacos for $2.99 and thanked the lord my boy is a vegetarian. Best carne asada ever! \n\nAnd the atmosphere in here is great. Oh! And they're open late. 6a-11p. The employees are friendly and the customers (mainly families) are just so full of life and happiness (or maybe it was the Spanish music blaring on the loudspeaker?). All in all, this is a new fave.

Today I finally made the trip inside the store, rather than just going to the restaurant on the side. It was too early for lunch at Tradiciones so in I went. I knew that the market had a lot going on at all times; I nearly run down at least 6 people getting in and out of the parking lot and I'm a really good driver (seriously-not Raymond from Rain Man good, but actually good!). The parking lot on the store side is always packed.\n\nSo the focus of my trip was the cucina. It was bustling for lunch already at just 10:30. So as I'm trying to make sense of the menus posted in both Spanish and English on the wall above the hot food line or whatever, I am greeted by a nice woman that helps me decide where to go. She mentioned sopes first, so that's what I started with.\n\nMy order was way too much food for one, but I wanted to try a couple of things. So I got both a chicken and a steak sopa, a street taco al pastor (pork), and a side of beans. They did have combos unlike another reviewer said but I only wanted to add beans an opted for a side instead. My total for food was $11.00. Not super cheap, but like I said more food than I would normally order at once.  \n\nSo a sope for those unfamilar is not a torta as someone else said. It's more like a weird tostada or open faced sandwich. The base is somewhere between a corn tortilla and an all out bread. It does appear to be flash fried to cook but I'm not totally sure and it didn't feel greasy. The sides are curved to make a small cup to fill with beans, meat of choice, topped with shredded lettuce, grated cojita cheese (I'd describe Mexican parm--hard salty and good!!) The chicken and steak were both tasty. The steak was a little strung together if you will. I'd rather have seen it be chopped better so I would be easier to eat smaller bites. If your teeth didn't make it through that bite, a big chunk was coming along with it. Sorta messy but good though I felt like my sopa was a bit tougher than it should be and my extra cheap plastic fork would bend to the will of the sope.\n\nThe street taco was just so I could taste the al pastor. Two tiny corn tortillas topped with a bit of pork. I topped it with onions and cilantro and would totally eat the al pastor in another dish. \n\nBeans. Not a really a fan. They lacked the taste of say Carolina's beans though the texture matched. A disappointment. \n\nSalsa bar was good. Hot green and red, and the pico was spicy too. Fresh onions and chopped cilantro are a must so it was good to have those. \n\nAgua Fresca...Just love it. I had the fresh guava juice. So tasty and well worth the additional $2.91 I spent for the 32oz drink. \n\nTotal food and drink, $13.91. A little spendy for lunch served in stryo while seated on a bench, but it was fun and I will order a little differently next time so it won't be as expensive and I won't order more food than I can eat.\n\nMarket, looks good. Great looking bakery (really), meat counter, tortilla factory, etc. I'll probably not go out of my way to get there for things I can buy at Food City on a regular day. This does look like a fun way to go get some lunch before you shop for dinner on a weekend. I'll definitely take others for hot food and a fun people watching experience, plus pick up a few goods on the way. \n\nI don't really know about authentic. It's probably not. I don't really care. My dad's family is from near the Mexican border and though I've been to mercados in Mexico and even here, I liked that this place is busy and clean. Campy, sure.

I never go down the center isles, as they appear to be filled with typical grocery store packaged foods  What makes Ranch Market special are the fantastic offerings all around the center isles.  \n\nHere is my advice:  First, make your way to the fresca bar to get a fresh fruit drink, it's just past the bakery at the front door.  After you pick up your favorite fruit drink head over to the grill for some carne asada street tacos, but only order two because you'll want to save room for the seafood bar where you will find a deliciouso shrimp ceviche at a very reasonably price.  I usually order a half pound of the regular shrimp civiche and a half pound of the civiche ensalda; eat a little at the bar on a tostada and take the rest home for lunch the next day.  Yummy!  After you have filled your belly with the tasty carne asada and civiche, stop by the tortilla factory to get some fresh tortillas to go and don't forget to hit up the bakery for hot cream filled churro for desert.", "business_id": "VXIkI9_EbDbYHeO9IzKjJg", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-02-12", "type": "review"}

This place is fantastic for finding ingredients (regular or hard to find) for homemade Asian food.  The prices are much lower than your local supermarket and the selection is out of control.  I went to pick up some sesame oil and some other random items today and I wondered how I would manage to select one out of the 30 or so different brands and varieties they have.  Luckily, I had a friend with me and we managed to logically deduct ourselves into a selection.  \n\nThe bakery is amazing and everything I've had from there is delicious.  The produce section is vast as is just about every section in the store.  I appreciate that they even have English aisle readings on one side for those of us that can't read characters (Chinese, I think).  Today, the smell was pretty stale-fish-like, but I usually don't find it to be like that.  I have also seen (but not tried) their sushi-grade prepackaged fish cuts.  If I were brave enough to try and make my own sushi (which I am definitely not - let's leave that one to the pros...) I would try it.\n\nThis place is crazy busy pretty much all of the time and the parking lot is 100 times worse.  Make use of the secret underground parking garage with a 3 hour limit.  It's always empty so wither people don't know about it (until I let the cat out of the bag just now) or they are gluttons for the punishment that is the craziness of the parking lot.\n\nIt's a great place and even if you don't have anything in particular you need, browse around and take a chance on something with no English on it.

While Costco's lot design is terrible, the standard corner entryway they employ works well here. Wrapping the parking lot around a corner of the building effectively extends the parking to two sides of the building rather than one. This creates more spaces near the entry/exit. In August when I have purchased perishables, I am appreciative of this.\n\nMy various customer service dealings over the past few years have all been positive experiences that left me feeling good about my loyalty to Costco and the Kirkland brand. Associates quickly handle returns without hassle, I am usually able to find an associate on the floor if I have a question, and it appears this particular location employs individuals on the long-term as familiar faces regularly greet me.\n\nWhere quality is concerned, I shop with confidence at Costco.

Although, I must blame management because the attitudes and treatment that I received usually travels from the top down. I had the most issues with a couple employees that work in the deli area. They were both always rude, short, and unpleasant. Every time I said hello to one of the women she NEVER responded. Not so much as a head nod to acknowledge my presence. I brought this to the attention of a cashier and she told me that she would speak to the manager about the service. I continued to go to AJ's but nothing changed and I received bad service over and over again. The last straw for me happened last week. I went to the deli area to get breakfast. I greeted one of the deli workers and she AGAIN said nothing. I was sure that this was on purpose and not her just having a bad day because it had happened so many times before. I asked her why she never responds and seems to have bad customer service. She dismissed me and said \"actually, I was just about to ask you how you day was going\" I thought this was amusing considering she just neglected to respond to my greeting... I told her that she had done this on a number of occasions and it was quite frankly rude and disappointing. She then jumps to want me to get my manager...

This location also has a special Italian Kitchen (Cucina Italia!) department behind produce that has fresh baked wood-fired brick oven pizza and pasta.\n\nAJ's differentiates from Whole Foods by focusing less on the \"all natural\" and organic slant and more on gourmet (expensive), unique, and imported items.  They are big on merchandising neat little themed vignette displays instead of traditional end-caps.  They'll have many more imported items and go up to a much higher price point (check out the olive oil and wine) than a Fry's Signature store.  Unlike Trader Joe's, they carry a wide variety of brands, and don't focus as much on packaged and frozen foods.\n\nThe prepared food is hit or miss.  I've had a bad monte cristo, awful turkey, good pizza and pasta, decent coconut shrimp and salmon, and amazing mashed and scalloped potatoes.  The soups are good.\n\nThe bakery is really fantastic (the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e is cheaper than Whole Foods, while the pecan pie and bar, Boston cream looking pastry, brownies, chocolate mousse, and more are all delicious).  Note that they carry some indulgent locally made baked goods (Fairytale Brownies and Tammie Coe Cakes).  Their organic AJ's brand sliced packaged bread beats OroWheat and Safeway's version.\n\nTheir gift selection is pricey but well-edited.  It definitely gives the market a more European or \"country chic\" vibe, more Anthropologie than the sleek natural-centricity Whole Foods embodies.  Holiday clearance is a great time to buy stuff 50% or more off!\n\nAJ's does carry \"normal\" national brands to balance out their imported/gourmet/organic assortment, so if you NEED something like Ritz crackers or Bounty paper towels, you'll find it here, as opposed to a generic or a pricey organic brand you'd find at Trader Joe's or Whole Foods.\n\nSome of the employees are unprofessional late at night, but to be fair it gets pretty empty compared to Whole Foods.  Maybe opening up a Wine Bar next door would help?  I think they're finally opening back up the coffee counter in the morning, which is a good business decision, as the bakery gets way too busy with coffee bar orders.\n\nDo I shop here often?

I usually shy away from \"salad\" sandwiches because most places use too much mayo, or there's funky ingredients like walnuts or raisins or grapes.  I was feeling mighty brave today I guess.

I want to eat as many of them as possible from as many different places as I can.  And let me tell you, there is just something about the sandwiches from Cheese 'n Stuff.\n\nIt's not big on atmosphere.  There's a deli counter and then a few picnic tables with plastic tableclothes, some shelves stocking Swedish foodstuffs for sale as well as the store's backstock of chips, soda and paper towels.  They usually have some cheesy holiday decorations out.  It's cramped and not that pleasant.  I usually get my lunches to go.\n\nTheir sandwich menu consists of about a million pages printed out from an inkjet printer and taped to the wall, along with some hokey signs that say things like \"Today's Special: So's Tomorrow.\"  There's nothing slick or pretentious about it.  It's obviously just a shop owned by some guy and his wife and daughter.\n\nSo yeah.  The sandwiches.  I'm a vegetarian, and they have a simple yet elegant veggie sandwich that I find myself craving a lot.  It has cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, avocados, and some kind of dressing.  I get it on a wheat sub roll.  Not fancy, but oh-so-tasty.  I wish they had more veggie options, but this one satisfies me.\n\nI bring friends who eat meat here so I can tell them to order the Doughboy and enjoy it vicariously.  Their deli meat is high quality and there are loads of options.  It looks like the sort of place my grandpa would love and I want to bring him there some day.  No one I've brought in has been disappointed.\n\nThe sides are delicious.  I am a fan of the macaroni salad and the pasta salad that has the olives and italian dressing.  If I'm feeling indulgent, I'll get a brownie, a piece of cheesecake, or an ice-cold sarsaparilla.\n\nThe lack of atmosphere doesn't bother me; my one gripe with this place is how early they close.  There have been many times I haven't gotten moving early enough and haven't been able to get there before they close, which is 4 PM.

Oh, but I wanted to be. I mean, a local brewhouse right down the street from where I live? I thought for sure this would become my home away from home. Instead, it was so mediocre and underwhelming, I can't help but wonder, \"Will I ever be back?\" Probably not. \n\nMy friend and I walked into the restaurant side of Sonora. I wanted to sit in the Den, where the brews are crafted. We were told to cross over the patio to the place next door. Alright. So, we did. Hardly anyone was there. In fact, the place didn't really pick up until the time we were leaving. Must've been the football game that drew people in, for there was a flat screen plasma TV behind the bar. \n\nSpeaking of bar, I was excited to try their Vanilla Porter. I was told it was so good, it would make you wanna slap yo' mama. \"My mama needs a good slappin',\" I thought. Well, she didn't get it. Ok, so maybe vanilla + beer isn't my thing, but I wanted to try something new, something special to this brewhouse. After all, isn't that the point? The kick and finish of this beer did not impress me. In fact, I struggled a bit to finish  my pint, which, was $2.75 during happy hour. At the very least, the prices to whet my whistle were great! \n\nMy friend and I opted to try the food. I felt brave and ordered the bratwurst. Maybe I'm not a bratwurst person, for it was just okay. Nothing else on the menu appealed to me, even though they do tend to have a variety (fish and chips to grilled salmon to soup and burgers). \n\nThe layout of the place was somewhat unusual. I mean, two seating areas connected by an outdoor patio area (with heaters). That was cool, except that when my friend and I left the Den, we had to cross the patio to get to the exit (in the other building). Along the way, I got one giant whiff of cigarette smoke. Yep, that's just what I wanted to top off what had become a very bland and unenthusiastic experience.", "business_id": "3UMcsN9IjoeV8JZvC4apag", "stars": 2, "date": "2007-12-14", "type": "review"}

Except that nobody seems to know my name there in spite of how frequently I come. But then, I'm not part of the 30-something clientle who sets up shop at the bar.\n\nI roll into a booth or a high table that has the best view of the games that are on. It's a great place to come down and see local sports or tie one on after a terrible local sports performance. Not great because of the televisions or presentation of the games in any way(which is just two smaller flat screen TVs with no sound in the main room), but because of the laid-back, true-to-its-locale atmosphere it emits. It just seems perfectly in place and makes it feel natural  to hang out and throw some back more then any other bar around town that tries to force its motif into a Phoenix landscape it just doesn't jive with.\n\nAnd of course the food and beverage there don't hurt its cause at all. I do agree with some people's sentiments about particular beers not being up to snuff compared to other breweries. My particular complaint is with their Pale Ale, which tastes like an IPA, and their IPA, which tastes like a medicinal strength IPA. But in spite of some quibbles with the beers here, they really do have some fantastic stuff. For some reason, the beer that is my standby there is the Light Rail Cream Ale, which is in stark contrast to the Brown and Amber Ales I typically get at other breweries. Its got that perfect taste/refreshment balance that acts as a Siren's call to bring me back here at least once a week.\n\nThe burgers, salads, and pizza's are also fantastic. But the real find here is the bread pudding, which has got to be one of the best bread pudding's in existence. I always try to eat slow to make room for it. Luckily, this is a place that won't care how long you cement yourself to a seat.\n\nWhich again, makes this place perfect for some Suns action or whatever is going on. But I probably remember my trips here best after catastrophic defeats. Last year after the Sun's officially bowed out of the playoffs without a championship for yet another season, and with my brother after ASU (he's an alum) lost to Oregon are the first that come to mind. The classic rock and the atmosphere and the beer (don't forget the beer) seem to breath new life into me during such trying circumstances.

Which means that I was really hoping for more. I was hoping that this place would be a little lived in, a little less polished, a little less new Phoenix. It's kind of odd that big box chain food spots work at trying to get that aged look by throwing junk up on the walls and hanging it from the ceilings. Not at the Sonora Brewhouse, they'll have none of that here, but that's okay.\n\nYes, they brew their own beers and yes it's good and more than decent. The food is better than average and always cooked. Even when you ask for your Kobe burger to be cooked medium with the hope that you'll see some red, it'll come out with no pink at all. Sadly, I wasn't expecting anything different.\n\nDo I sound disappointed? Do I sound like I'm sitting in a box of self pity? Oh woe is me, they FULLY cooked my burger. Oh woe is me, the beer is good and the steak fries have the perfect crispness on the outside and mashy-goodness on the inside. The quality at Sonora Brewhouse is what I expect at any of the big box chain restaurants like Gordon Biersch, but never get. The problem here is that they can be so much more. Food + Ambiance (personality) = Greatness. Sonora Brewhouse is missing the heart.\n\nThey're polite and not offensive in anyway, walking the definition of middle.\n\nThis is both surprising and disappointing since they have been around for a while, but also because just a block to the east, Rosie McCaffrey's is overflowing with heart and soul, more than you can imagine. If they can find it, tourists probably love Sonora, but remember, tourists often love going to another branch of the same TGI Friday's that they have in their own suburbia, while on vacation in a different town.\n\nOkay, so Sonora Brewhouse isn't anywhere near the low level of a TGI Friday's, but it's almost as clean, boring, and devoid of personality, being almost completely unmemorable. Oh. They also probably have the thinnest Kobe burger patties I've ever seen, at least the steak fries and beer are good. My advice?

Once we moved down here, we started pining for the brewery scene. We gave Sonora brewhouse a shot.\n\nGranted, our expectations are very high. OCB is THE social hub for the locals. We knew we weren't going to find the same thing here, being that Phoenix has so many cool haunts available.\n\nWhat we were looking for was a good patio, good beer, and a good atmosphere. Sonora Brewhouse delivers on all counts. The good food was a bonus. It's not great food, but it'll do. We've learned to stick to a few select items. \n\nThe chips and salsa are wonderful. If you're lucky, the flour tortilla chips will still be warm. They are fluffy, light, and delicately crisp. The salsa is the traditional smooth style, with just the right amount of heat. \n\nThe other go-to food item is the American Kobe beef burger. It is so juicy, so flavorful and delicious. It's big enough to share, if you're more interested in sampling the beer, but want a snack to keep you going -- which is my usual strategy.\n\nI'm not really wowed by the beers. I think I have tried four or five of them, and of those, only two stood out for me. The seasonal vanilla porter is lovely and luscious, like a creme brulee in a pint glass - but without overdoing it. Typically, I am a dark beer drinker, but the Light Rail Cream Ale won me over. For a light beer, it has surprising amounts of body and flavor. One could easily wile away a warm Winter's afternoon kicking those back.\n\nAs for the atmosphere, it is casual, but I wouldn't say friendly. I've been there probably six or seven times, and haven't had a single conversation with a stranger. \n\nAlso, they play great music -- if you can hear it! Often, I can make out faint notes of Janis Joplin or the Doors. I'm told that the patio speakers are as loud as they can get.

I was slightly disappointed when I found out that it wasn't a real happy hour, but a kind of happy hour (real happy hour is 2 for 1 drinks or fifty percent off, being honest here) while the happy hour offered here was a dollar off drinks.

Needless to say, I wasn't in the best mood and I had thought I was settling in for an evening of fantastic food served in small portions on pristine white dishes.\n\nInstead, I pulled a 180 and went to SunUp because it was close and it was on my food list.\n\nThe interior didn't put me off. Though it's not a \"classy\" brewpub, the interior sports soft lighting, Spanish colors and a certain amount of elegance. I'm not saying you should take a date here if you're trying to impress her, but it's certainly acceptable before or after a movie.\n\nThe atmosphere is laid back. A curved bar sits behind a simple floor stacked with numerous square tables both normal and high-top. Brewing equipment stands behind a plastic wall off to one side. A small doorway leads to a narrow room lined with booths on either side. The place is not that big, but it's not small either.\n\nThe menu consists of standard pub fare with a few Spanish touches. Appetizers have the normal dips and fried dishes. The homemade bruschetta caught my eye, however. It was a bit strong on the garlic and not very well done. Outside of the typical burgers, sandwiches and wraps, they do feature some interesting entrees. I ordered the special - shrimp fajitas. It came with one giant flour tortilla which confused me, but overall it wasn't bad. My friend ordered the salmon which was a much better effort.\n\nAs for the beer, they featured six standard offerings along with three seasonal. Of the typical offerings, most were a little too sweet and a little low on the hop side, especially those of lighter color meant to appeal to the masses. However, the low amounts of hops did allow the floral and citrus notes to come through on the IPA. My favorite was the seasonal Red along with the Vanilla Porter, which though sweet, had a robust chocolaty character. Bonus point for the dry-hopped, cask conditioned version of the IPA as well.\n\nThe service was alright. She didn't know much about the beers, but could at least distinguish one from the other via color, even among those that looked quite similar.\n\nOverall, the place is alright.

Maybe some remember the old Tommy Knocker's, but that's as close as we have ever had. Recently when SunUp split from Sonora Brewhouse, they also added a brewery next door and have been increasing in popularity ever since. However, they come up short in terms of providing a top quality microbrewery, and SunUp only shines as a good neighborhood bar that happens to brew their own beers. \n\nOn mutiple visits, I've tried multiple beers. The first visit, sampling the Red Cask Ale, I had a mostly positive feel about the beer. It was bold, reasonably priced, and packed quite a punch. I also sampled the Light Rail Cream Ale that night, which was essentially a standard ale by my count. The bartender explained while serving it that the name is \"a bit misleading\" because most, like myself, are expecting more of an ale with a stout-like finish. The Vanilla Porter is their best brew in my opinion, with the most distinct flavor and a perfect balance in aroma. I've become quite enamored with porters lately and SunUp's didn't disappoint, but it also didn't drive me to proclaim it one of the best porters around.\n\nService at the restaurant has been hit and miss. One visit with an empty bar, we were waited on hand and foot, but also felt as though the staff wanted to close up and go home. They were putting chairs on the tables, sweeping the floors, and doing general closing duties, though they insisted they were not closing for a \"couple more hours.\" Another visit I sat at the bar for quite some time with no bartender present, and the bar obvoiusly understaffed.\n\nAll in all, it's a welcome addition, and compliments the other establishments popping up around Central and Camelback very nicely. Unfortunately, Central Phoenix could still use a top-notch microbrewery. SunUp, right now, has too many inconsistencies, and doesn't have great enough beer to make them not matter.

Ick :P\n\nPerhaps I am biased because we are from Fort Collins and are spoiled with the likes of New Belgium, O'Dells, and Equinox all within a couple miles of our house.  However, the service and stinky bathrooms were bad enough that had their beer been phenomenal, I still would have just given this place 3 stars...maybe.\n\nIf you're looking for good local beer, hit up Papago or Four Peaks instead and save your money (and beer belly) for something tastier!", "business_id": "3UMcsN9IjoeV8JZvC4apag", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-02-13", "type": "review"}

You'll have to ignore the temptation to pound them one after the other... at least on your first go-round. All of their beers are certainly quality and quite enjoyable, though there didn't seem to be a huge \"wow\" factor with any of them. In no way will I hold that against them though, as none of the local AZ brews (that I've tried) seem to be doing anything very far outside of the box.\n\nNot only should you visit Sun Up to check out their craft, you should definitely go to try their eats. Their wings are probably the  best I have ever had; fried perfectly and still nice and moist, plus their \"hot\" sauce had a finely-tuned heat factor. Their sliders were dynamite as were the accompanying sweet potato fries and garlic parmesan fries. \n\nThe service was fast and very friendly, and the establishment (men's room included) was very well-kept.

SunUp however, was open and was my first suggestion so that I could still hang out with my lovely lady friend who is also a connoisseur of fine beers.\n\nSunUp turned out to be a cozy little place to enjoy beer and some righteous grubble. Knowing that my drinking companion was also a vegetarian (although she allows for bacon, which makes her an ovolactopesciporkatarian), we chose to split the nachos (sans meat) and the smoked salmon reuben. We also sampled the onion rings, which were downright tasty (especially if you sweet talk the waitress into bringing you a side of the remoulade that is normally served with their shrimp)! Although I found the smoked salmon reuben a tad on the salty side, I appreciated the fact that it was served on a nice marble rye.\n\nAs for the beer, I found it fresh and quite drinkable. They offer their own house beers as well as guest taps, so I found the selection was ample enough to satisfy my beer wanderlust. The atmosphere was my favorite element of SunUp... it seems to be a great gathering place and yet it is intimate enough to serve as a decent place to take a date.

I usually prefer amber or brown ales but there is something a little off about their amber. So, I did not really ever make it a point to visit their brewery before. Then I saw that last week, for AZ beer week, they were doing something kind of fun. Beer floats. That's right, they had paired four of their beers with different flavors of gelato: cream ale with strawberry gelato, pale ale with blood orange sorbet, amber with sea salt caramel gelato and vanilla porter with tahitian vanilla gelato. Some were better than others but it made for a fun experience. I just love the fact that there are so many breweries in town now and they each have their own vibe but yet they are all part of the local craft beer community.\n\nThe brewery itself was very homey and comfortable. It was decorated with a lot of wood paneling that was probably left over from the seventies but it gave it sort of a cozy country lodge feel. They have a nice inner courtyard with a secluded patio even though they are on a major street in the middle of downtown. There is a larger separate room where it seems most people who are eating a meal get a table, but the main bar area is pretty small. Most of the people there seemed to be regulars and it was an eclectic mix of ages and personalities. The bartender (who was also the hostess and the server) was very friendly and that also contribuited to the warm and fuzzy feeling we got while sitting at the bar.\n\nThough I don't go that often, I will probably return to SunUp. Firstly because I have discovered that their porter is actually pretty good, and secondly because it just seems like a cool place to hang out. The main thing that kept them from another star was the awful smell in the ladies room. My hubby said it was even worse in the mens. Gross.

I don't know much about them, but it turns out they do sell beer and they also make some really good food.\n\nI tried two of their brews, the Amber was the first. Pretty good. I would say it's a little lighter in flavor than other ambers I've had, but I liked it and would order it again. \n\nNext up was the Light Rail Cream Ale. Their description says that this is their closest thing to a domestic and I couldn't agree more. It's light, crisp and refreshing. \n\nNow to the food. We started with the pretzel bites which were okay. The best part about them was the side of mustard. It was actual legit mustard with mustard seeds, not the yellow nasty goop people put on hot dogs at baseball games. \n\nThen I had the Trooper IPA Pulled Pork sandwich with a side of the Green Chile Mac & Cheese. The sandwich had cole slaw on it with delicious tender BBQ pulled pork. I haven't had a BBQ sandwich that good since I left the South. I also haven't sought out BBQ too much since I've been in Phoenix, but bottom line is that it was a really good sandwich. \n\nThe Mac & Cheese was also a winner. Giant elbow pasta with a nice mix of creamy and stringy cheese in each bite.

I only recently noticed that they also stock Cajun tasso, which is a cured pork product used for flavoring diishes (think pancetta... but not as fatty, and with a spicy Cajun twist). I must warn you though, this tasso is a bit fiery. I had to sample it at home before deciding to use it in a pasta alfredo-type dish and the cayenne was up-front and in my face! Yikes! Ahhh, I do like the burn though...\n\nI also consider this one of my sources for German meal ingredients. They have the authentic weisswursts I grew up on, and they sell cans of kraut and rotkohl if you don't want to make 'em from scratch.\n\nFor lunch, they feature a limited selection of their house-made sausages on a bun with chips and a drink for $5 as their daily \"Brown Bag Special\". This is a treat if you simply want to sample one of their offerings at a time.

It was really gross, but I spit it out and ate the rest because besides that little bit of nastiness it was good.  They're losing a star for this though.\n\nCustard Bun: Very good.  Fluffy not-too-sweet bread with a creamy custard that had a strong vanilla flavor.\n\nUnder $3 for both!  They have that annoying $5 minimum for card transactions though, which is discouraging younger, frequent small-purchase repeat customers.  Their sales volume would definitely increase if they would eliminate the minimum and invest in a remodel to play off of Sweet Republic's traffic next door.\n\nThe older woman behind the cases was polite but rushed.  She rang up my total after I had chosen the second item, which put an end to my buying anything else.  To be fair, they were closing soon, but the place was dead and you would think she would want more business or encourage me to try something else.\n\nAs others have noted, many items in the unlit (not easy to see inside) pastry case are unlabeled.  The handwritten signs that are in the cases are faded and really should be replaced with something better (Microsoft word, a printer, and a laminator will do wonders).\n\nThe interior was clean (though cluttered) but looked very tired.

I thought I might be able to salvage this by adding chocolate sprinkles, but apparently they don't even carry that. Seriously? Isn't that a requirement at an ice cream shop? To make a long story short, I spent $3.60 on a small mint chocolate ice cream. At that price, I would have enjoyed buying a tub of the same thing for the same price.

Obviously, leading one to think that all the pillows in that display were part of the sale.  So I picked out two, went to check out, and they rang up full price.  I informed the girl at the register that they were marked half-off...she was nice enough, but she wouldn't honor the mistake - most other stores will.  \n\nFine, not a huge deal, but then some guy off the floor comes over, and very rudely snaps at me, \"No, you're wrong, those ones weren't marked.

Very annoying and embarrassing to have to be dragged into this argument in front of a line of people.  He's SO sure that he's right that he asks me to waste my time to follow him back to the display, so he can show me himself and prove that I'm wrong.  So I humor him, walk back, and show him the large, red clearance sign directly above the pillows I had wanted to purchase.  By now, if I were in his shoes, I'd be feeling like a real piece of work.  But no, not this guy.  Not only did he NEVER apologize, but he would not admit that he was at fault.  Instead, all I got was a half-assed mumble, \"Well, it's wrong...\"\n\nIrritated by now, I decided to not purchase the pillows and started to walk away.  As soon as I turned away from him, the guy calls over another girl that was working there - who had nothing to do with the whole  fiasco - and he starts yelling at her in front of everyone within earshot, blaming her for putting the sign there.

It only takes about 12 minutes to bake a bagel so in other words you don't plan to make any more. wtf Einstein's I didn't go there to buy cream cheese.

They had a whole case of authentic looking Polish baked things like Paczkis and Kolachkis and other things I can't spell or pronounce, but also have lots of Ks, Zs and Is in their names.  From what I saw, the paczkis they had were:  raspberry, prune, cherry & cream cheese, apple, custard, strawberry & probably a few more I'm forgetting. \n\nThey also had a little Polish deli with more food I won't even attempt to spell, but it certainly seemed authentic.  Lots of sausages and meats and things.   \n\nAlso, even the people that worked there were authentically Polish!  Well, I'm assuming so, at least.  They were white and spoke with accents I couldn't understand, but reminded me of the northwest side of Chicago.  \n\nGo forth and enjoy the fatty deliciousness that is the Paczki before you have to do the whole \"Lent\" thing, if that's the sort of thing you're into.

They were delicious and huge!!! I would recommend splitting a sandwich! We were both STUFFED by the end of the meal. Our sandwiches were dripping in Italian dressing as they should be and piled high with meat and lettuce. All in all it was a great sub. The atmosphere is awesome too.

The garlic bread was soft, chewy, and not too oily or garlicky.\n\nFor dessert I picked up a canoli, which was probably the most filled one I have tasted so far.  Not too sweet either, though I think something like dark chocolate shavings would really finish it off nicely.\n\nOverall, my bill was around $20, which is too high for an everyday dinner for me, but I would consider this place again for a pricier but solid Italian meal (especially for takeout).

I hate to be the rabid cur of dissent in this love fest, but I can no longer fake it and go with the flow. I despise everything about you, Miracle Mile.\n\nUnless someone had cued me into the fact, I never would have guessed that you were trying so hard to duplicate NY deli-style fare. Why so?

Matzo ball soup so bland I had to keep looking down to assure myself I was indeed consuming something other than hot air. Wilted salads guaranteed to deflate my hopes upon first bite. Vegetable soup that was so flavorless as to be nearly nonexistent. Are you trying that hard to fade into the background, you wallflower? It's no wonder the median age of a patron in your restaurant is pushing 80. The near total annihilation of my taste buds is the only way I would ever step foot through your doors again.\n\nAnd then there's your pathetic excuse for a sandwich, Mile. Pastrami and corned beef sandwiches piled (not so) high with bland, fatty meat that's been slopped with reckless abandon atop your choice of bread, guaranteed to disintegrate in five seconds flat. All topped off with a slice of sweaty Swiss cheese that adds zero flavor and flops listlessly atop a piteous excuse for a sandwich.

You surely deserve an award for the most poorly constructed sandwich in all of Phoenix! \n\nAlthough I guess that dubious honor should clearly be bestowed upon your brusque, monosyllabic cafeteria line workers. \"Next?

Usually something's overcooked or bland.  The service each time has been relatively good.... and the personalities tend to surface.  The second to last time I went with a friend and we had dessert.  Ordered coffee with a shot of Baileys and had a slice of cheesecake each.  Our waitress was VERY enthusiastic about the cheesecake.  To the point of us being ever so slightly uncomfortable, but she did claim to have gained tons of weight at the start of her job due to having a slice every time she worked.  I suppose if you're surrounded by it, it could happen.\n\nDinner wise, however, the portions are difficult to finish for the average appetite, but I tend to gravitate toward their small plates menu and order a couple of things off of that.  I also enjoy their Thai Chicken lettuce wraps.  It's a good place to go if you have a bunch of people who like a variety of things or just can't decide.\n\nThis definitely is not my choice of places to go, but usually more like a... oh, we know it's open, it's not that far, and no one is in the mood for anything specific sort of place.", "business_id": "2r8jGeuYvMkyP2ik_X-Bxw", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-01-03", "type": "review"}

Knowing that Cheesecake Factory doesn't take reservations, my sister called Saturday afternoon to find out how long it would take a party of 14 to be seated that night. The hostess told her she'd take the name, asked my sister to call 20 minutes ahead to let her know we were on our way and our table would be ready shortly after we arrived, if not when we got there. Sounds perfect right? Not so much. \n\nWe called them as requested and were told our table would be ready when we arrived. When we arrived about 15 minutes later, we were told they were running approximately 20 minutes behind. Not a huge deal, being Cheesecake Factory on a Saturday night. After 30 minutes, we asked again about being seated and were told that they were waiting for their large table to be vacated by a party who'd been there for 2 hours. Of course... who doesn't go to Cheesecake Factory for dinner at 4:00? Another twenty minutes goes by and again, we speak to the hostess station, who tells us the table just ordered dessert. At this point, it becomes pretty apparent we've been lied to. Finally after waiting for more than an hour and 15 minutes for a supposed reservation with two pregnant women, a diabetic and two antsy toddlers, we decided to leave. \n\nI have no problem with Cheesecake Factory not taking reservations. I think it's ridiculous, but it's publicized, so we dealt with it the best way we could.

I've never been to this specific location before, but have been to a few others in the valley, and I love it every single time I go.  Weather its for lunch or dinner, with family, friends or coworkers, this place hits the spot every single time.\n\nTheir menu is huge, and awesome!  TONS of great food to choose from. Dinners, lunches, and it all tastes so good!  MMM.  Lunch specials, dinners, deserts you can find everything on their huge menu.  The restaurant is quite large as well so seating is plentiful.  \n\nToday I went with my coworker during lunch, and we both walked out so full!  We got pasta lunch specials, and it was Delicious.  We were seated within a few minutes of entering, and our waitress greeted us and took our order.  She brought out bread which was hot and tasty, which we devoured.  Drinks were always filled, and we were in and out in a little more then an hour.  I got the spagetti with meat sauce, and the lunch sized one was HUGE.  I will be having leftovers for dinner, trust me!\n\nI will be returning here in the future, trust me.  Menu and food is amazing, love the atmosphere, etc.  \n\nI will say, on a side note the parking here has gotten WORSE over past few years.  I will not blame Cheesecake factory because its not their private lot, but its bad.  When I first started coming to this district, parking was open and free, with some valet service.  Then, one day, I came here last year to eat, and it was all chopped up into different pay lots.  the first lots a valet, the next lot is all token pay parking, theirs a pay parking structure in the back, and tons of \"15 minute to go\" parking around the perimeter of the center.  UM, this is a nightmare to navigate!  There's \"free\" parking but they shove you way in the back on the \"north\" side of the lot and you would spend at least 15 minutes walking to cheesecake factory if you were to have parked on that side of the mall.\n\nMy advice?  Either circle 3 million times, or just drop your car off in the token paying lot down the way.  I think Cheesecake factory may even validate, but that's my thoughts...\n\nAnyways, I love you cheesecake factory and you have never failed me!

My friends had arrived from Paris and were famished. I chose your establishment because of the extensive selection of menu items and the quality of food. It was approximately 5pm and we decided to enjoy our meal on the patio where it was relatively quiet. \n\nUpon entering the restaurant, we were greeted promptly and seated immediately. I was concerned because I didn't see anyone else eating on the patio which typically means the server sometimes can forget they have people outside. Our table was clean, music was at an acceptable level, the sunscreens were pulled down and everything seemed perfect, then...our waitress arrived and introduced herself as Nikea. At that precise moment, our experience began to change. \n\nGranted, had been shopping all day. My guests were experiencing jet lag from their travels. Their English is not that great which required translation and patience just to get through the menu. The four of us were hungry, but we just couldn't believe nor did we ever expect what happened next. Nikea created an environment which made us feel as though we were being welcomed in her own home. Not once did we ever feel rushed nor did we feel like red headed step children for sitting on the patio. She had other tables on the inside  but somehow knew when we needed drinks or her assistance. She made reasonable suggestions and was present for our entire meal.  Although we had just met, she created an atmosphere in which I felt as though I had known her for quite some time. One might ask what exactly did she do?  Everything. Absolutely everything was perfect and exceeded my own expectations this making taking our dining experience from perfect to a remarkably extraordinary epic experience! If she isn't part of your training crew, I would highly recommend you consider making her one. Her mannerisms, attentiveness and overall professionalism was superb, but it was her personality which boosted her A game and placed a personal touch on our experience.\n\nI truly hope you take the time to share this with her. Thank you Nikea for a remarkably relaxing and memorable dining experience. Entertains guests from foreign countries who have limited knowledge of the English language is very exhausting and sometimes stressful.

Nice crunchy baguette, fresh mozzarella, and flavorful tomatoes.  The pasta salad was also very good... very simple, just cold pasta with some olive oil and seasonings.  I'm not a super adventurous eater, so while I loved the pasta salad I would guess that others might find it a tad boring.\n\nToday I had the tomato basil ravioli soup, which was very good except that it was a little skimpy on the raviolis.

We settled on:\n\n1 Coffee, 3 Bottled waters, 1 Lemonade, 1 mango cake, 2 creme brulees, 1 white chocolate cake, and 1 large chocolate chip cookie.  There wasn't a pricing for any of the things we ordered, so when he came to tell us our bill was $48.50.  We were shocked.  WHAT?  No detailed bill?  The kids were tired and we just wanted to leave.  \n\n10 items for $48.50 = Average $4.85 per item since we don't know the prices (non alcohol drinks and dessert)!  REALLY?????

(Have you ever been to the PV location? Not so good.) Parking here is great and the employees are usually really friendly. We do 98% of our grocery shopping here (the other 2% split between the occasional Costco or Target item). Here's a breakdown of why we're here 2-3 times weekly:\n\nFresh flowers and basil plants - quality and price can't be beat.\n\nCheese selection - they have a ridiculously good amount of varying cheeses. The fresh mozzarella in water, goat cheese, parmigianno-regianno blend, whole milk ricotta, blueberry vanilla goat cheese (um, spread this on a graham cracker and tell me it isn't the best 'cheesecake' you've ever had), mexican shredded blend, gruyere and sharp cheddar, gloucester chive and cheddar....are just a few in our regular rotation. \n\nStaples - eggs, milk, cheese, bread, yogurt, peanut butter and jelly, tofu, frozen fruits and vegetables, hummus, pasta and grains, condiments, baking items, Clif bars, bacon, canned goods, pizza dough, crackers, instant oatmeal, frozen hash browns....to name more than a few. \n\nProduce - love their bagged salads (and kale!), and they have a good selection of organic produce that's not wildly expensive. Much of the produce is pricier than say, Sprouts. However, I'd rather just pick it up at TJ's and not spend my time and gas running to Sprouts to save the difference. The only qualm I have with their produce is nearly everything is packaged. If they got rid of their packaging they'd be going green and saving their consumers money. I also wouldn't have to deal with 2 out of my 5 apples being badly bruised due to the fact I couldn't individually select them.\n\nAlcohol - we don't really purchase any alcohol here but good ol' 2 (okay, 3) buck Chuck. And also, I like their $5 Blanc de Blanc champagne. We purchase all of our other alcohol at Total Wine down the street. \n\n....the only thing that's sometimes a bummer is more often than not, if you go later in the evening, they're out of a lot of items. Sometimes they're fully stocked, and sometimes they're out of half a dozen things on my list. It's pretty hit or miss at night, so we've just learned to go earlier in the day. \n\nI think part of the reason we are able to grocery shop here almost exclusively is we have just tailored our eating habits to what we can buy here. We rarely eat processed foods to bring home, and we do majority of our own cooking. It took us a while to get comfortable only shopping at TJ's (we used to do the Safeway, Sprouts, Costco AND Target runs), but now it's easier to make the one stop a couple of times a week rather than spend an entire day running around to stock up. Plus, my three year old loves the mini carts, samples (she knows they're in the back), and stickers she gets at the registers.", "business_id": "Sy-hmzSH1OmWpHmAfZtxRA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-01-12", "type": "review"}

I'm not sure if it's a chain store but it has an independent coffee shop feel which is pretty cool now days. The coffee tasted good and they seem to take the art of espresso seriously with the only knock being they do not roast the beans locally. \n\nWhen: Saturday Afternoon at 4:30 pm\n\nLocation: As stated in opening description it's a great central location to meet people but since it's in the same shopping center as a bank, Zen32, Safeway, Gelato, and other little shops parking was tight. (If you're a grumpy driver you will need to bring your patience along for parking). The one thing I noticed was the Gelato store next door. I would think on a hot summer day if you're a coffee fanatic it would be nice to have your coffee then enjoy some Gelato. \n\nFront and back patio seating, free wifi, \n\nAmbience: Hava Java has the obvious local art hung throughout the place. It's a little place so the walkways are very narrow and the  high tables are barley functional, and if you sit in the back you can smell the restroom. The best place to sit is out front or out back. I really liked the fact they have a back patio seating area. That's unique for a coffee shop. \n\nCoffee: I had 2 drinks: a vanilla latte and a coffee. Above average taste and presentation but it's not elite. The staff was proactive in asking my milk preference. The coffee came in a to-go cup and not a ceramic cup in case you care about that.  If you are a serious coffee connoisseur you may not like Hava Java due to the fact the beans are not as fresh as they could be if bought from a local roaster. \n\nFood: They offer the typical pastries. I didn't ask where they buy from but it looks like the typical Chompies verity. I didn't have anything to eat. \n\nPrice: Average: My small vanilla latte was about 3.50. My large coffee was 2.00\n\nClientele: Since it's in the Biltmore area its typical upper middle class people in there late 40s/50s. The one thing I found a bit odd was that the customers were overly friendly, it was a little unnerving but that could have been just me so I'm not knocking them for that. \n\nWait: There was not a line when I arrived so they prepared my order immediately. \n\nStaff: They had one girl working when I arrived and she was really nice and professional. No face tattoos or odd piercings. Not that tattoos and piercing bother me but at some coffee shops that is the typical staff look and it might bother others.", "business_id": "2h9LsLPdJ7OvZrYJZhVdAw", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-02-28", "type": "review"}

The store staff was not familiar with the color, and didn't have anything to offer him - they told him to purchase it online.  \n\nUpon hearing this, I called the Scottsdale and the Biltmore Stores.  The Scottsdale store person had never heard of this color, but he indeed had some pieces in stock. He actually made me to go the website and give him model numbers of things I was hoping to find. It was really crazy.\n\nI called Cindy in the Biltmore Store and she was quick to respond that she knew EXACTLY what the color was, she knew they had a floor display of the color and the pots and various other pieces (frying pans, tea kettle, etc.)  She also agreed to put a few pieces aside on hold for my Dad so he could look at them quickly and easily without any confusion.  My Dad drove down this week and found all the items he wanted to purchase super quickly and he said he did not deal with Cindy, but that the experience he had was very good.  He also loved the Biltmore mall and found the parking easy and meandered over to Macy's to get her some Estee Lauder perfume as well.\n\nThank you Williams-Sonoma!!!  My mother is going to have a great Christmas.  And yes, this is a spoiler, but my parents are not likely to check yelp reviews...but if you run into my Mom, keep this a secret for a couple more days!", "business_id": "31bXixwy2GNmRlhpl21reA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-12-23", "type": "review"}

I didn't know any better.  I wasn't wrong to like what I liked - but I was wrong to think they were quite as great as they were.  What did I know about independent coffee shops?

It totally gives you what you order.  But nothing more.  \n\nI went to one recently and found that it's menu had again almost completely changed since I'd been in last.

Interesting flavor - but quickly forgettable.  I do like their green tea.  But for almost $9 for a sandwich and an iced tea I found myself thinking about how much better I could have done.  \n\nBagels for the office - fine.  Go for it.  They'll even pre-cut them which I think is a great option.  And they almost always have my fav (pumpernickel) available which gives them bonus points.  But for lunch?

I wish I could review it based on flavor, but I cannot. Here's why: My mother-in-law, thrilled at expecting her first grandchild, ordered Tammie Coe cakes for my baby shower. When she went to pick them up...WHOOPS!! Tammie Coe forgot to make them. 30 guests, catered lunch, no desserts. She ended up giving us pre-made cakes out of her freezers, and we forgave...after all, mistakes happen, right? Even to very high-end bakers with huge followings and even huger price tags....right? Fast forward a few years to my sister's bridal shower. Sister's having a destination wedding in Switzerland, in a castle in the Alps. Hostess throwing the shower wants to go along with the theme and have 30 individual Swedish \"Princess Cakes\" for dessert, which happen to be a favorite of the bride. We search high and low all around Phoenix to find someone other than IKEA who makes these unusual cakes (IKEA's are frozen, and who's got freezer space for 30 cakes??). But guess who makes them to order? Tammie Coe!!! She even remembers us from the baby shower a few years prior, and has the good sense to redden in the face over that embarrassing memory. We all share a good laugh over silly mixups, place the order, and pay nearly $300 for it. Shower day comes, we go to pick them up, these delicious, bride-requested, dream-wedding themed 30 cakes, and....WHOOOOOPS!!!! Tammie Coe forgot to make them. AGAIN. Seriously???? Yes, seriously. At this point, either Tammie Coe has some weird passive aggressive objection to my family's happy occasions, or she just sucks and can't get her business together. Note to Tammie Coe: if you're going to make a habit of forgetting to make pricey, occasion-driven baked goods, DON'T DO IT TWICE TO THE SAME FAMILY. Or maybe this is just how she rolls, and forgetting to follow through with orders is a common theme? Either way, bad business model. Ta ta, Tammie Coe.

She told her to \"remember that this is fondant, and those aren't jewel tones, jewels don't come in those colors.\" My mom just urged that they make sure they are rich, deep colors because those are my daughters favorites. Welp, I picked up a lime green, hot pink, and baby lavendar cake.\n\nAND AS IF THAT'S NOT BAD ENOUGH:\n\nMy mom paid extra to have a stethoscope and graduation cap placed on top of the cake.

The wall of windows lights the place up awesomely, and even at night, it doesn't turn into one of those dark, moody coffee joints. They find new artists to show art every couple of months or so, and it's usually pretty good. Their couple handfuls of small tables are easy to shift around if you're joining a group, but big groups might feel uncomfortable since it's not exactly huge. There's a nice quiet room around the back for people studying, but it's not enclosed, so on open mic nights or nights when there are featured performers, it's not so quiet. I love how clean they keep the place; when the baristas aren't working the counter, they're wiping down the windows, bussing tables, and restocking the coffee condiment bar. \n\nSpeaking of the baristas, they're always friendly and attentive, good at showing off how to hustle (because when a coffee shop's busy, I feel better if baristas actually act like it), and totally interesting to look at--like fashion icons for today's college-aged generation, some with interesting piercings and tattoos, fashionable and stylish by not trendy clothes--seems like there's an appreciation for staff who are unique, interesting, and good workers. It's never uncomfortable, though--meaning, I never feel too old or unhip or out of place there. Customers truly run the gamut, from quiet middle-aged women catching up with each other, moms and/or dads with kids, suit-and-tie professionals stopping in for a cuppa, people hitting the wi-fi, and angsty artsy types having heated but civil political debates. \n\nI usually have the chai tea latte, but their coffee is always solid (I can attest to a decent caf\u00e9 mocha), and I hear a lot of praise about their daily specials--every day, a different bean, special coffee, and iced tea. Prices are a little cheaper than Starbucks (I think it was $2.50 for the tasty mango lemon iced tea, and the larger specialty coffees can go up to $4.50), but the drinks are better. Pastries are always tasty and include a small selection of rugalah (buttery, flaky, chocolatey goodness--also available with raspberry or apple), a bigger selection of muffins, big and puffy croissants, bagels, cookies, brownies, rice krispie treats--certainly not a fully stocked French patisserie, but what they have is usually really good quality.

You can also sit down and have waiter service at the LGO Pizzeria which is connected to the grocery side and open in the evenings only.\n\nI'm not sure if I wrote anything different than the 32 reviews that came before this one, but I needed to put in my 2 cents on this neighborhood favorite.  \n\nOh - actually I just realized that no one has commented on the LGO apparel and other cute gift items... the shirts are so soft and fit so well that I have 1 and my BF has 3 (no joking).

You live in Phoenix, Arizona and you're tired of having breakfast at the Cracker Barrel, or Denny's, or even Ihop? What about those 'eggeries' they have around town? Nope? Not in the mood? Oh. You know where you should go? You want a completely different breakfast experience in Phoenix than the usual stuff you can find out in Goodyear, or Peoria, or Mesa?\n\nGo to La Grande Orange. (pronounced Oh-rahnj) Seriously. While more than half the spots in Atlanta would rival La Grande Orange, in Phoenix it's absolutely hands down one of the top three spots for breakfast. Honest.\n\nOkay. So the parking lot is too small for how many people come for breakfast. This isn't LGO's fault, there's actually a lot of parking - there are just too many people coming for breakfast. Okay. So the prices are technically a little more than you're used to paying by about $2. Get over it. The food is better. Well, okay, there's only one item on the breakfast menu that's actually worth the money. The Commuter Sandwich - but it's worth the money.\n\nUsing the largest, most flavorful and softest english muffins you can find, they place very fluffy folded eggs in a sandwich along with avocado, and bacon, or turkey or whatever else you'd like. Seriously, the english muffin alone with the egg is enough to make this worth the price of admission.\n\nSure the lines get long, but I'm sorry, that's what happens when the locals know a good thing - and it's the locals, the people who live in and around the Arcadia district that come here most often. Sit outside or inside, there's enough traffic to people watch while drinking your latte and eating your sandwich.\n\nWhile you're waiting for your food to arrive, walk around the store and check out all of the french imports that you really can't get anywhere else. I'm not saying they're actually worth the price, but there are a few greatly unique items which you may decide are definitely worth the price. My girlfriend bought a $25 wallet there which she still uses and gets complimented on everytime she pulls it out of her purse. (Okay I know, $25 for a woman's wallet is nothing, but you should see this wallet.)\n\nThey also have a selection of wines and cheeses. I've never bought either and I'm not sure they're worth the markup they have on everything at LGO, but it's nice to see, especially after you've wandered one too many times around the Cracker Barrel store.\n\nThere's an attached pizzeria which isn't open during breakfast hours, but you can sit in their space when you get your commuter sandwich and coffee. It's quite awesome. La Grande Orange is honestly a hidden jewel in the Phoenix suburban food wasteland. It's not for everyone, but I'd say that if you're in your mid 20's to early 40's even, and you're wanting to seem a bit trendy without trying too hard, go here. You'll definitely appreciate the difference.", "business_id": "R8VwdLyvsp9iybNqRvm94g", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-12-30", "type": "review"}

Look at all the cute families, dogs and have a double cappuccino.\"\n\nHe looked at me realizing that I've probably already had one too many double-capps that day and as I said goodbye, and we both pulled out of the gas station, I couldn't help but wonder which of the options he and his family would choose.

On Fridays you can also order Pizza in the Grocery starting at noon  and eat it in the Pizzeria until 4pm. At 4pm they start full service and then you have to be seated and are waited on. Confusing to newbies, but it works. \n\nThis place is full of regulars. Mostly business types, Self Employed or others than can take a 2-3 hour lunch. They have WIFI and so people come and get some work done while having a bite and there are always several tables with casual meetings or get togethers. It is a comfortable inviting place once you know the drill.

I felt like Gulliver; was I growing or was my food just getting smaller?  \n\nI asked one of the girls who work at LGO if the three ultra-mini cubes of avocado was considered to be a normal portion, she just looked at me like she was coming down off a pot binge and said she wasn't sure and that if I was 'OK with it', I should just go ahead and eat it.  Duh...ya think?  I'm thinking she didn't quite make the cut when they were recruiting at NASA.

I have been here many, many times and agree that peak hours might not be the time to come if you are in a hurry or don't want to stalk someone to find a table, but it is the perfect place to come if you come during off hours or want to people watch.  I would have to say that the French Pancakes w/fruit and creme fraiche and organic coffee are my staple.  My main complaint was by the time I pick up my food and get settled at my table, they were cold or warm at best.  \n\nMy bf came in from North Carolina for a visit and she wanted to revisit her fave bfast spot so we made it up to LGO around 9:30 on a Monday.

We ordered French Pancakes, Croque Madame, Pumpkin/choco muffin, Almond croissant and coffee.  All yummy and perfectly hot for our dining pleasure.  \n\nAs always, browsing through their supply of fun and funky stuff in the \"maybe I can't live without this trinket\" section leaves you wanting to buy that special something for yourself.

But I didn't go right away.  Which was my loss, because this place is phenomenal.  I finally ended up here somewhat fortuitously because a student of mine suggested it.  Anyway...\n\nI've been doing this phoenix biggest loser thing because my wife says I'm the biggest loser in phoenix, so when Amber W. started up a competition with the same name I figured hell, I can win that.  Turns out it's about weight loss and so that pretty much means I'm screwed on the $25 entry fee.\n\nWell I wasn't until I went here.  My diet was doing very well, thank you, *until* I went to LGO.  As soon as I walked in I was met with a tsunami of poor health choices and didn't know just how to hold it together.  Pumpkin-chocolate chunk muffin? Blackberry bran muffin? (Which I ordered because bran=fiber=healthy, der!) Strawberry muffin? Cream cheese coffee cake?!?! and a million more delightful delicacies which tempted me for forty seconds before I gave in.\n\nWell not really.  Here's how it went down: I held firm and got oatmeal with bananas, strawberries, and raisins.  Spare me the nutritionist's take, I'm confident that was the best I could do.  So I was pretty proud of myself.  But I *did* have to bring home a muffin to my wife because that story about her saying I was a big loser was a lie and she's actually pretty great.  So I paid for the strawberry muffin but at the last minute changed to blackberry bran at an employee's recommendation and GOD DAMN i am glad i did because that is probably the best muffin I ever had.\n\nNote: Since the charming Gabi M. decided to laugh at me for my food choices *all night* at the OYE I will point out that I ate only 3/7 of the muffin.  That's it!  that's like, um, a 57% healthy choice based on my math.\n\nAnyway my student had an english muffin with avocado and smoked salmon that I was looking lustily at so she told me that I *must* have an english muffin.  She bought a pack and gave me two (I'm a good tutor evidently) and so of COURSE I HAD to eat one.  I say that defensively because Gabi laughed at me for the english muffin too.  I'm scarred.\n\nAnyway.... I know this review is dragging because my wife is now watching Lifetime which means that her head is being filled with all sort of anti-man propaganda as I type.  So I'll wrap it up: \n\nToday we went there and I had a croque madame which is a whole grain open face deal with ham and tomato and mustard and a sunny side up egg.  Pretty damn good.  But we also had the strawberry muffin which was a little disappointing: not moist enough and not strawberry-y enough.  So I give this place five stars anyway because it is super cute and I don't think I could eat everything I wanted to eat there if I went in for 14 days straight.  I loved it.\n\nAnd for the acting on Lifetime, one star.  And the writing:\n\"I love billy, but I love you more.\"\n\"Really?\"\n\"Really.\"\n\nPulitzer prize stuff, that.", "business_id": "R8VwdLyvsp9iybNqRvm94g", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-01-21", "type": "review"}

Anyone who gives LGO negative reviews has just fallen into the usual boring Phoenix restaurant style type eating.  LGO is something different...order and serve yourself....kinda' like fast food (but you have to wait a little bit because all the food is made fresh), but seat yourself and don't have to worry about waiting for a server to bring your drinks/food!  Coffee is great (and strong). Daybreaker is my favorite healthy breakfast choice (egg white with turkey slices, avacado, tomato and salsa....get with a side of fruit or potato...fantastic!)\n\nYes, prices are a little higher than average in Phoenix....but you get what you pay for.\n\nWe love coming here after a good hike at Squak Peak or Camelback!

My time here today has been made up of one beautiful discovery after another!\n\nWalking in, it was really crowded and there were tons of cute little knick-knacks for sale, so I couldn't really figure out how it was a restaurant... that was until I saw the counter and the giant menu of items they offer! After some deliberation I went with the reuben (always my top choice) and a glass of iced tea. I was needing a pick-me-up meal, and this seriously got the job done. The reuben was huge and was piled high with juicy corned beef and a layer of delicious cole slaw, and was on some of the softest marble bread I've ever had. I was amazed! As if the glorious sandwich creation wasn't enough, it came with some sweet pickles and a big slice of pineapple. I couldn't believe how perfect this lunch was! It had me full and back to life in no time. And don't even get me started on the iced tea.\n\nThe atmosphere here rocks and is totally conducive to knocking out some work projects. Today it was a mix of biz professionals, groups of friends, and a couple of families. Gabi M. and I started at a round table and then moved to the community work table... the height was better for working on laptops, and there are plenty of outlets!\n\nAfter Gabi left and Lindsey F. showed up, I was debating going for one of the ridiculously large cookies they have at the front counter. Lindsey told me to do it (she REALLY twisted my arm) and loads of calories later, I was satisfied by a chocolate chip cookie close to the size of my head. \n\nOne other awesome detail... they play great music! Get your Shazam app ready, 'cause you're going to want to know the titles/artist names of every song that comes through the speakers.\n\n(P.S. I was just joking about moving to Phoenix.

Focus on the food and the customers.\n\nNow to the sandwich. What is the Cardinal Sin in sandwich making? The wrong bread, and yep, they did it. They used thin, flimsy 9 grain bread to hold together a stacked turkey sandwich, and after one bite, it all fell apart. So I was left to eat all the ingredients of the sandwich a la carte like a Thanksgiving meal. That's too bad, because it was obvious everything was great quality, and had they used Italian, French, Ciabatta, etc.,  I would not be giving this a 2 star review.\n\nI may possibly return (am in no hurry)  for the treats, or a cappuccino and breakfast. The sandwich experience was too irritating to give another try, especially when a few blocks away The Vig is serving the best damn sandwiches in Phoenix.", "business_id": "R8VwdLyvsp9iybNqRvm94g", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-02-26", "type": "review"}

Consider it to be a casual cafe-cafeteria-ish where you can order fresh baked, homemade goodies and comfort meals from breakfast, lunch and dinner. They use ingredients that are pure and natural - nothing here is made with preservatives or additives! They also have items for those who are vegan, vegetarian and gluten-free. \n\nLa Grande Orange (LGO) reminds me of Elephant's Delicatessen in Portland, OR. And if you know me, I love Elephant's Deli! So as you can imagine, I fell in love with the atmosphere at LGO. I came to visit one morning for brunch with the parentals and also met up with an old elementary school friend who lives in town. You pretty much order your food at the cash register, pay and wait by the pick-up window for your plate/orders, afterwards, you just find a seat anywhere. \n\nThe atmostphere of LGO is hustlin' and bustlin', they are quick to serve and food is made within minutes! As you can imagine, the place is quite loud, so stay tuned for your name being called as they serve your dish at the pick-up window. \n\nFYI: They have a second location at the PHX Sky Harbor Airport (Terminal 4-D). I'm kinda glad that they have a location in the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport, so I can grab a few goodies to go on the plane and devour!\n\n[devour]\n*LGO FAMOUS ENGLISH MUFFINS ($1.95/each; $9-half dozen; $16.50-dozen)\nOhhh emmm gee! Their English muffins are large! Lightly toasted and sliced in half, the English muffin was served with a side of their homemade preserves and butter. You can tell this stuff is homemade by the texture as you chew into each carbalicious bite. I found out that they sell a bag of them at the airport, so I was able to grab a half dozen to share back home with my foodie friends! *highly recommended*\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-grande-orange-grocery-phoenix?select=N1JQGiauJS_Wgt-ozRdB2w#bJEjXkOfQmAZdkt106R1QA\n\n*FAMOUS FRENCH PANCAKES ($6.75; **4 STARS**)\nThe French pancakes were very light and fluffy! It sorta reminded me of a crepe texture. The pancake was made with honey and creme fraiche. It was topped off with several slices of fresh strawberries, which made the meal quite delightful and refreshing! \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-grande-orange-grocery-phoenix?select=N1JQGiauJS_Wgt-ozRdB2w#3RCEJaMiE1A7SYjfmw-Gsw\n\n*BIRCHERMUESLI ($5.25; **4 STARS**)\nConsider this breakfast dish something you can also grab on the go! (Also served at the PHX Airport!) Here you have chilled Swiss oats, mixed with raisins, slivered almonds and organic vanilla yogurt, all combine to make a healthy and fulfilling breakfast! I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for something to grab on the go and wants something that is healthy!\n\n[dessert]\n*RED VELVET CUPCAKE (**3 STARS**)\nWas kinda dense. The cream cheese frosting was very thick and delightfully complimented the cupcake. I wish the cupcake had a bit more fluffiness in the cake's texture. But nonetheless, it was a decent sugar fix - but nothing to go wild and crazy about. \n\n*SEA SALT CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE (**3 STARS**)\nThis cookie was recommended by the employees. I didn't think the cookie would be uber salty! I like salty-sweet mixtures, but there was too much salt in the cookie for me to eat. The chunks of snow-frost-like sea-salt, had to be dusted off so that the cookie was bearable to consume. I think this cookie would've been awesome if they decreased the sodium content. I did prefer this though over the red velvet cupcake. \n\n[imbibe]\n*FRESH SQUEEZED ORANGE JUICE \nWhy not get orange juice from a place that has \"orange\" within their name and logo! The orange juice was very refreshing and full of pulp! I wish I had ordered a larger cup of this instead of a small! They also sell this item at PHX airport so you can grab a cup of it to go! *highly recommended*\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-grande-orange-grocery-phoenix?select=N1JQGiauJS_Wgt-ozRdB2w#OWoA9xTlsGQf9iC_uN5kRw\n\nFYI: parking can be quite limited in the front, there are spots in the back and sometimes they offer valet (no charge).\n\nIf I lived in the area, I would probably be a frequent flyer! Seriously!!! If I'm in the area again, I would try out their burgers and pizzas since that's also a popular item on their menu. If you're visiting Phoenix, definitely make a visit to LGO (or at it's airport location!)

Now I reside In Dallas, Texas. This is the one place in all of Phoenix I truly miss the most. I lived within walking distance to Chelsea's kitchen, literally across the street. Same owners as LGO, a little further down the road, still in walking distance. I actually moved to the worst apartment complex in Arcadia just for this place!  I cannot describe my love for this place. When I try, it all comes down to that cold, ready to go salad case.  For 1 year I ate the shredded kale,evil princess Thai and tuna Ni\u00e7oise salad 5x a week on average.  The champaign dressing on the shredded kale salad is the best dressing I've ever had. During morning hours they'd even do a breakfast kale, hard boils egg addition To the grapes, red pepper, sunflower seeds, and Manchego cheese. The Thai salad has an  incredible dressing as well, fish sauce based, yum! The chicken is minced to get into every bite equally, the lettuce is perfect size, w/ red pepper, lemon grass, red onion. The whole salad comes together exactly how a salad should, you could eat it with a spoon. The tuna Ni\u00e7oise doesn't miss either.   Contains all the proper Ni\u00e7oise ingredients! Potatoes, green beans, capers, Kalamata olives, tomatoes. \n   Ok, so let's get on to those home-made English muffins. They are all the rage for a reason. Unbelievable. My favorite thing to do with them was to make a sandwich  with them using their perfect chicken salad they sometimes have in the salad case. They use their in house rotisserie chickens from Chelsea's kitchen and add the perfect amount of mayo, grapes, and spring mix. Small amount of the best dressing ever and a toasted English muffin, mouth orgasm.\n\nThe ginormous peanut butter cookie is ridiculously amazing. Never found a better one.\n \nThey have soup de jour, my favorite was the mushroom or New England clam chowder. \n\nEveryone loves the breakfast, personally for me it wasn't their strong suit. I had almost everything but I cannot rave about any of it like I can with the salads. Still, I ate it a lot. The jersey girl omelette not on the menu was my favorite, it's like a pastrami sandwich in an omelette. The croque Monsieur was my favorite breakfast item featured on the hot menu. Open faced, grain toast, ham, egg and gruyere cheese with Dijon and bread n butter pickles. Side of fruit, Fresh squeezed o.j. Mmmmm.. \n\n \nDinner:\nBesides the pizza, reviews in LGO pizzeria.. \nIf available due to limited quantities, the rotisserie chicken melts in your mouth and tastes nothing like a grocery store. Half is $6 whole is $12. Get some sides du jour and dinner is ready and impressive!\n\nThis places motto should be, \"what recession?\" If you have never been here and want to fit in, come in work out clothes on Saturday or Sunday for brunch. Lol, it's like everyone's stop after a run or bike trip.  \nEven though the parking lot is tiny, hard to find parking, and easy to get hit (I was there like everyday, bound to happen, not my fault!.) the call ahead curbside service is great. I abused it.  The girls are great though, never had any problems with them, always cheerful and gracious of tips. \n \nI miss you LGO!,", "business_id": "R8VwdLyvsp9iybNqRvm94g", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-12-05", "type": "review"}

It's one of those places that seems like it has to be good from the, uh, uppity nature of the people who've mentioned it. (Uppity: more money than I have) So since I'm obsessed with trying to look cool and like I have more money than I have, (what kind of hipster would I be if I didn't?) I figured I needed to try it out. So what better night than when I am too tired to cook anything, too lazy to go too far, but trying not to eat my stress in Arby's 5 for $5? I read the reviews and the grab and go aspect sounded like just what I wanted. \n\nHere's how it went down, straight first impression style. Parking- uh nope. No parking, went down the street looking, then realized, I just wanted to grab something and go home, no way am I parking and walking in this situation. Went back and snagged a spot in front of the paper store, which was closed, therefore I say it's up for grabs (plus upscale paper stores are bullshit). Go inside La Grande Orange grocery and whoa, that's a lot of stuff, piled to the ceiling, everywhere. In my head \"grocery\" means some aisles and a display here and there, not pyramids of god knows what. I'm afraid to walk around for fear my big ass will knock something over that costs more than my hourly rate. Ok, grab and go spotted, yay! Oh it's kind of empty, ok it's 8 pm, whatevs. Selected spicy chickpea lettuce wraps, and looked around trying to figure out where to pay, there's like 3 different counters. Ok I've figured out where to pay, but what is there to drink? Iced tea or lemonade apparently at this counter. Side note: I did not see an easily accessible path to this drink case they motioned to, so maybe I look next time. Pay, go home, enjoy. \n\nHere's where I am most lost: order food to be made at a counter but coffee is at a separate counter? Like I can't buy food and coffee at the same time? Wth... Maybe I'm overthinking it, but, that's just it, If I wanted to think about food I would have made it myself. Will probably try again for breakfast one day when I'm feeling like a fight to the death. \n\nP.S. Not sure where the hipster vibe is coming from with some people, to me this was all uppity white folk, complete with heads so far up asses that \"excuse me\" is lost on them.", "business_id": "R8VwdLyvsp9iybNqRvm94g", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-12-11", "type": "review"}

The trick that one of the staff recommended to us (that we completely forgot yo do but will do next time) was to have the egg cooked over medium since they typically serve the egg sunny side up which can be too runny for most. I personally liked the gladiator more than the fallen angel. We also decided to go with a growler which you can decide to keep or just drink at the table (of course we decided to keep it for am extra $12). It is such a uniquely shaped growler!

If you have never had a kolache it is similar to a pig-in-a-blanket amped up on yumminess.\n\nThey have an espresso machine and many donuts choices. I will be saving that experience for next time. Oh, and I also read someone's review on breakfast burritos - looking forward to that too.\n\nIt's an older place that reflects its age.

The friendly Asian man and woman (owners?) and were friendly.

The woman behind the counter \"heated it up\" but it was in a microwave, not a high speed oven or toaster that would have made it less squishy and more flakey.  Sliced ham and cheese were grocery store quality.\n\nDonut holes: Tasted a tiny bit stale, but still good.  I prefer BoSa's in Chandler though.  I imagine these are fantastic when warm.  I'm going to save some and try pop them in the microwave later.\n\nFrozen hot chocolate: Very heavy on the cocoa powder, and served without whipped cream.  Could've used some more  sweetness and a creamy vanilla flavor in it.  Added a couple pumps of sugar free peppermint syrup at home to wake it up and balance the bitterness of the cocoa.  I've yet to find a FHC that can beat Dairy Queen's, sadly.\n\nRainbow has a very convenient location with easy parking, though their hours are somewhat limited.

The experience was overall very odd. We have been to 3 tastings before this one, and this was by far the weirdest. We sat in a front room with a bunch of fake cakes. We waited 5-10 minutes before the owner I suppose came out to talk with us, but instead of getting right into the cake info, she got all of our personal info first. She asked me if I had pictures of any cakes that I liked, so I showed her some pictures while I explained what I liked about each one. After showing her and telling her, she asked me 'what do you like about that one?' Ummm...I just told you. (ex: Me:Here is a cake I like, I like that it is square and has different size proportions for the different layers....her: oh, ok what do you like about it?). She then set up a laptop computer and played a slideshow of their cakes. I'm not sure why they do this, especially when I came in knowing what I wanted. Also, the pictures were not awesome...the cakes all looked the same, there must have been 50 cakes that were white with red roses sticking out of the layers. It was some serious boring cakage. Also, some of the cakes had writing on them, but instead of looking flush to the cake and professional, it looked like it was piped on at the Fry's bakery (read: birthday cake for a child). So then she brought out the cake samples, there were thin slices of vanilla vanilla, vanilla strawberry, chocolate chocolate, champagne raspberry, and lemon raspberry and maybe some others I can't remember. Honestly, the cake ranged from ok to very not good. The vanilla strawberry was by far the best, and the champagne raspberry was by far the worst. That raspberry filling was atrocious. It tasted chemically or something and the combo with the champagne cake was terrible. The chocolate was boring, tasted like grocery store cake and I'm pretty sure the 'frosting' that was on the outside of all the cakes was cool whip. It definitely was not butter cream and it was light like whipped cream, but was clearly non dairy. When the owner came out (after letting us sit out there for like 15 minutes or so...a very long period of time), we told her straight up we just didn't really like the cake, no offense, but it was not for us. She then told us that they only make the samples once every 2 weeks and we were at the end of that time period. Wow. Just so you know, they charge 15$ for tastings. For 15$ we got the equivalent of 1 slice of 2 week old cake....and they're trying to gain my business? That is definitely unforgettable, but not so much in a good way. So anyway, the owner was gracious and offered us a second tasting if we wanted, but honestly there is no way I would buy my cake from them after what I experienced. \n\n\nPS My brother got his wedding cake from this bakery a couple years ago, which is why I tried it and I remember it being fairly good, so maybe something has changed, or maybe it really is better when it is fresh, but I'm not willing to take that risk.", "business_id": "Rd5SDxM3S9QUvRayhqZl4Q", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-02-22", "type": "review"}

Well, most places sell you a sandwich that is packed with a cheap cut of meat, such as Capicola, then maybe a few slices of Salami, and if you are super lucky, you might get a slice of Prosciutto, which will bring the cost of the sub to at least $10.\n\nAt Tony's, they offer the standard Italian sub on their menu, but they allow you to customize it to your liking. An Italian sub, is whatever you want it to be..you choose your cuts of Italian meats, and it's a done deal. I often get Prosciutto, Sopressata, and Salami, and they don't skimp on the quantity of meat either.\n\nIf I were to take the Prosciutto off the sandwich, have them weigh it, and buy just the meat, it would cost more than the entire sandwich does. This is one of the nice things about a family business, they take care of their customers. The bread is authentic, and the flavor of the quality meats really make for an authentic, flavorful, Italian Sub. The best part, is that it only costs about $6.00, which is unbelievable.\n\nIf you aren't looking for authenticity, then this is not the place for you. Authentic is the key word here, and I think that some of the negative reviews I have seen are due to ignorance and not understanding what it takes to run a business of this type in this part of town for so many years.\n\nThey have one of the biggest selections of imported Italian groceries that I have seen in town. They have everything from fresh bread to dry and frozen pasta, to sauces, imported peppers, fresh made Italian Sausages, which are amazing as well. The store is packed with goods, and there may be a little dust on some cans here or there, but come on, it's an old family business with a huge amount of authentic, imported goods. These places are what you want to have around when you want groceries that you only find in the Old World or in big cities, such as San Fran or New York City.\n\nThis business has so much more to offer and I urge anyone who appreciates authenticity and a good down to earth, family owned and operated business to check this place out and write a review that is fair and that applies to the type of business. This place should not be compared to a typical grocery store, or Subway, it's more like an under appreciated, awesome dive bar, but instead, an Italian Grocery Store...lol \n\nI know that the right people know what I'm trying to say. :)\n\nThe bottom line is, keep this hidden gem in business, and then post some deserving reviews on here!\n\nCheers! :)", "business_id": "unPzS1QJJctlZyLGFSk_HA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-02-07", "type": "review"}

I feel that I really need to try to drive the Yelper's who appreciate quality, authentic, simple, old world food to make stop at this place.\n\nif you aren't cultured, and do not appreciate the simplicity of old world food, then steer clear and don't waste your time writing a negative review due to your ignorance.\n\nTo be a qualified reviewer, you must first have an understanding of what it is that you are reviewing. Unfortunately, a great majority of the younger generation in this semi-metropolis have not had the cultural exposure that many of their own age in old school and well cultured cities, such as San Francisco, Los Angeles, or New York City have grown up in and around.\n\nWith that being said, old world, simple dishes, made with simple ingredients and a whole lot of love are often under-appreciated. I urge you to research the importance of things such as bread, cured meats and olives, peppers, homemade sausages, etc. in the old world countries, and even well cultured US Cities.\n\nA physical location that has been around for 30 years in this town that serves up old world cuisine, at an old world price, with a ton of love from the family who has been there from the start deserves a certain respect for those qualities alone.\n\nIt is apparent to me that the typical American these days, seems to consider a true sandwich incomplete without Mayo or Mustard. The truth is, that those two additions are fine, but your tongue is uncultured. A true sub should not have such ingredients to cover up the subtle flavors of the cured meats and cheese. A little oil and vinegar add the zing that Ashley C. was speaking of. Again, no disrespect to her lack of knowledge, but knowledge and understanding are power and lead to a well rounded palette. \n\nThe sandwiches are only one small item in the full spectrum of this old world rarity, in a not so favorable part of town. The fact is, that this part of town may be a couple of miles out of your daily travels, but it is only a hop, skip, and a jump off the 51.\n\nAny true Yelper who appreciates the few, true Phoenix greats who sometimes fall into the unknown needs to make their way to this abode and see what you think and how you feel. If you feel the way that I do, then I think that the weight that I currently have on my shoulders about helping this quality place to stay afloat, will transcend to you and our team efforts will unite to get these old school purveyors back in the spotlight that they deserve to be in.\n\nLet's keep the growth of true culture and diversity alive in this town before it ends up like Old Town Scottsdale. There, you have a bunch of places with different names and decor, but the majority of the same food and lack of culture or ambiance are spreading like a wildfire that is depleting true cultural experiences and the small and simple places that don't get the love and appreciation that they deserve. \n\nForget the fancy menus with a fancy plate made in China, you can find that anywhere and they are in a completely different market. Take yourself back into a different time and into a different culture, it will make life more enjoyable and you will be more appreciative of the things that you have this day in age, as well as the roots that the things of this day evolved from. it's like thanking your parents or grandparents for the wisdom that they gave you. :)\n\nCheers!", "business_id": "unPzS1QJJctlZyLGFSk_HA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-12-27", "type": "review"}

So damn good. I'll tell you how to make them at home if you need to know. It involves lots of bacon and onions and a cast iron skillet.\n\nMany, many types of good cold cuts (gypsy bacon is my favorite) and I was lucky enough to get a loaf of bread on the house to try with my Polish ham- courtesy of the nice woman who rang me up.\n\nIf you are in need of oplatki to celebrate Christmas with, I'll bet they could find you some.", "business_id": "x_9nxwoGl7NBSzpBsD4iVA", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-12-18", "type": "review"}

You almost miss it driving up or down Cave Creek. They do open later (after or around 9:30 ) and close early in the late afternoon so plan ahead, and I believe they are closed on Monday's so call ahead before stopping in. You can tell they are open only when the white front doors are open to display \"OPEN\" on both sides. Otherwise, keep on driving! Hey, it is THEIR business and they can run it any way they wish, especially when their product is so very good.\n\nThe deli stocks various smoked linked sausages/kielbasas, along with ham and other cuts. Not terribly extensive but rare, tasty and reasonable.  Breads are varied but fresh made and just like one would find in a European bakery. Ask for a sample. The baked goods, no matter what you get, are off the hook, especially the cookies. Back east, our Italian in-law family had a tradition of having large cookie trays at all their weddings- HUNDREDS of cookies.They were baked by the best in the east and were very expensive per pound. Well, for all you traditionalist transplants,  call Jana's, they are that good and in most cases even better! The other cakes and such are very good.  Some pastries are an unknown taste to alot of people so they do not know the true texture and taste of authentic European delicacies. Do not judge or bash herein. Ask what the product IS, eat it, then if you do not like it, post it here but with the NAME of the delicacy and what you do not like about it. A Cinnabon is not a European cinnabon, my friends!\n\nYou can also find some Polish jarred sauerkraut or cabbage with carrot, regular kraut, frozen goodies like pierogies (from Chicago, okay I winced but once tried I am hooked) in many flavors. Again, Jana's is small inside but the delights you will find are huge. Give it a try. The service is lovely. Chat it up. CC/debit use should be greater than $10.00 but seriously,  if you leave there empty-handed, there is no sun, sky or moon! Enjoy Jana's! No, I am no paid spokeswoman, paid critic or the like.

Shopping here has taught me more about reading/understanding food labels, thus eating healthier but has also enabled me to try new things that I never would even have access to by just going to my neighborhood Fry's. Now as much as I love Whole Foods, I unfortunately go there for specific items, not my entire grocery list. Too expensive for that. Maybe I should get a second job there?", "business_id": "wepFVY82q_tuDzG6lQjHWw", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-01-25", "type": "review"}

Whole Foods, John Mackey's little baby he has turned into a behemoth within the industry. I am so torn by Whole Foods, of course most everything is more expensive. This could stem from when Mackey started the business as a democratic socialist and was not making any money, yet people were complaining about pay and high prices so he then turned into a free market libertarian - you can blame your high prices on that if it makes you feel better. Mackey is also a Vegan, but has said if he didn't sell animal products it would be bad for business(if the business even existed), yeah I get it, but I don't like it. Does anyone even care about the innard workings of the company CEO of the store they love/hate? Ok I'll cut this short.\n\nThis Whole Foods is an older store, not the real old school hippy-esque store, but it's nothing like the newer flagship stores around the country(like the one on Mayo). This obviously means they have to cut back on their selections to a degree but they still do a good job of cramming everything into this much smaller, albeit more \"quaint\" store. If I go to the Mayo store I am gone for 2 hours but only come back with a bagful of stuff because I was lost in a trance \"browsing\"; this makes my girlfriend very angry.\n\nI don't buy all my groceries here because I don't think some things are worth what they charge but in all honesty you can only find certain things at Whole Foods that you can't find anywhere else(Trader Joe's, Sprouts, Sunflower, etc). The Vegan/Vegetarian selection is massive compared to those other stores, they simply carry all the latest and greatest - it may not be the cheapest, but they carry it. \n\nOne last item, and this is for pizza loving vegan fools - Whole Foods was one of the first places to carry Daiya cheese. They actually sell shredded containers of it in the refrigerator section, but they also have it available at the deli. The usual counter worker isn't that friendly which is a shame and always seems put out but that doesn't make the pizza any less tasty. You can get one of their \"surfboard\" pizzas which will feed 2 for 2-3 days with a couple of toppings with Daiya cheese for $15.99. This may be the best deal going at Whole Foods and make up for that $8 bar of dark chocolate you just bought.", "business_id": "wepFVY82q_tuDzG6lQjHWw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-01-27", "type": "review"}

Thank you Naomi for you kindness and your spot on cheese suggestions!\n\nAs for at least one member of their management team, I can truly say she seriously lacks in the customer service area!  This is what happened.  As I passed by the registers I noticed one of their signature black sample tables.  On it was an open clam-shell container with 2 cookies inside.  I grabbed a cookie and proceeded to go to the produce section.  A few minutes later I was finally ready to check out.  As I was placing my items on the conveyor belt, a short woman with short brown curly hair and black glasses about 15 feet from me began to yell.  I looked up to see what the commotion was about and realized she was yelling at me.  \"Ma'am... ma'am, just so you know\" she exclaimed bitterly, \"those cookies were NOT samples!\"  I was so shocked and at that point everyone within earshot was staring at us.  I said I was sorry and I offered to pay for the cookies, and she retorted nastily with \"If you want to.\"  The bag girl looked horrified and I was thoroughly humiliated.  At least the cashier realized I made an honest mistake (I found out later that I wasn't the first one to make it) and tried to redeem their store's reputation by reassuring me \"it was OK.\"  However she didn't appear to be surprised by this woman's ridiculous and senseless behavior.  I wonder if she makes a habit of berating customers and her employees?  A customer from the other side of the next register actually came around to offer me comfort after this vicious verbal assault.\n\nIn taking the cookie I made a blunder but I already had over $80 worth of groceries in my cart, it wasn't like I was trying to get away with some kind of cookie heist.  This manager should have handled this situation in a more professional manner.  She should have approached me in a kind and informative manner (smile preferred) and brought the error to my attention in a normal conversational volume.

Would I lose my hearing from the stereo screaming sound of screaming children who already at the age of 3 have figured out that Santa Clause is no further away than their parent's credit card?  I could only hope.\n\nThere was a line, but dammit if it moved along pretty swiftly and people were polite for the most part.  It probably didn't hurt that there were 20+ cops bearing arms, ready to shoot Grannie if she dared tried to cut in line.  \n\nAfter about 20 minutes I found myself walking into the store and into what I can only describe as managed chaos.  I have never seen so many people  in on Walmart in my entire life (other than the time I went into one in Cancun Mexico, and they pretty much look like that all year).  \n\nThere were parents dragging kids by the arms, ignoring the screaming from their kids who would no doubt need serious shoulder surgery one day.  \n\nThere were cute little old ladies with their even cuter little old husbands who were walking....one...step...at....a....time...and...I...could...not...get...around...them...and...\nwished...they...would...die...and...get...it...over...with.\n\nThen there are the 'scooter people.'  Those folks who have clinged (clung?) to the new age idea that them being severely obese has made them also disabled and the only way to treat severely obese people is to give them carts so they can run into other people and shelves and my knees.  And those things moved FAST!  The only time I've ever seen one slow down is when they were going through the snack isle and then it's like they were going through a school zone...their eyes scanning the rows snacks with the intensity of a pimp checking out their bitches.\n\nAs I moved further into the depths of Sam Walton's hellish dream I realized that this was in fact the American Dream: hundreds of people pushing and shoving each other to get cheap clothes, cheap electronics, and basically every piece of shit you could wish for that was made in any place OTHER than the good ole US of A.\n\nThere was a time when people would have thought this was crazy.  Who shops at midnight to get a deal for a $15 dollar microwave?  And then I realized that because of Walmart and their push for the lowest buck no matter what, they have pretty much singlehandedly created an entire nation of people who don't make enough money thus forcing them to scramble for silly deals just so they can get their kids something special for Christmas.  Nice job Sam... I hope you rot in hell.\n\nBut I digress.\n\nI was there for one thing and one thing only.  I have no kids; nothing wrong with my little swimmers, but just no interest in the wet and spooky place they were meant to go.  I do however have the cutest, most darling, little nice who I love dearly and I'd do anything for her.  And on this night it was getting the Fisher-Price Sing & Giggle Plush - Mickey.  The girl just loves her Disney.  \n\nI wandered over to the Toy Section which mysteriously was not as crowded as I would have expected.  There were tons of kids but evidently Mom and Dad were still playing mind games with their kids, explaining that yes there were rows and rows of Toys but clearly Santa Clause does NOT shop at Wal-mart.  I even heard one women pleading with her little girl who apparently had her eyes on a small Crayon set and the mother was explaining that, \"I'm pretty sure Santa Clause is going to get you and even bigger Crayon set, so put it back.\"  The lies...the lies...they start so young.  I can already picture that same little girl getting pregnant at 15 and hiding it from her mother, and telling her that, \"Of course I'm not pregnant.  Would I lie to you, Mom?\"\n\nI walked up and down the isles, looking for the little girl area, and sure enough, in the very corner of the store was the isle that looked like it just may have it.  I rounded the corner and I was all alone, and it was almost quiet - the sound of screaming people getting run over by fat people in scooters sounded miles away.\n\nI found Mickey right away and then ran for the check out where I waited another 30 minutes to get out of there.  On the way out I saw hundreds of people still lining up to get in, and I thought to myself, \"Merry Christmas, you poor bastards.\"", "business_id": "1OigyqVxIfE6AGKNGWZjnw", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-12-04", "type": "review"}

It's in an unassuming little shopping center on Tatum across the street from PV Mall.  I noticed the sign but never thought twice about going in until my friend Deborah recently told me that they have wonderful sandwiches and salads that are perfect for picking up when you're on the run.\n\nSo, instead of trusting Deborah 100% (I don't know her THAT well yet), I sent my mom in to try Breadcrafters when she asked me where she should go for lunch during her last visit.  It passed the 'mom test' with flying colors... my mom loved it - she said it was perfect!\n\nToday was my turn... and needless to say, I was extremely impressed!  The staff was really sincere, friendly and helpful.  When I walked in, I smelled fresh bread and I saw several cases full of not only bread, but sandwiches, salads, and baked goods too!  Everything looked awesome!  I looked at the menu and noticed that prices were reasonable and they offered daily specials including soup/sandwich combo and 'the daily double' where you pick two different items to make your own combo.  It took me a few minutes. but I decided to design my own sandwich off the menu... I went with turkey, lettuce, tomato. avocado., sprouts, and spicy mustard on multi-grain alsatian bread.  It came with my choice of sides (I went with coleslaw) and a pickle.\n\nIf you've read my reviews, you know I don't usually go into detail about the food more than saying what I ordered, liked, didn't like. etc... however, I have to make an exception on this one.  The sandwich may sound like any other sandwich you could pick up anywhere, but this sandwich was special!  Every bite I took, I tasted all of the ingredients.  It was balanced perfectly!  Just the right amount of mustard and avocado spread evenly on the bread, fresh and juicy turkey. crisp lettuce, and ripe tomato.  Yum!\n\nI was there after 2 for a late lunch expecting this random place to be empty... but I was wrong.  The place was hopping!  I noticed that people were eating outside (it was a beautiful day) and that Breadcrafters is DOG FRIENDLY!  I also noticed that many people came in just to buy freshly-baked bread.  Not a bad idea - I'll have to remember that for next time we're entertaining!\n\nI overheard Angela. the (new) owner, tell a customer that the bread sold like crazy today, so I imagine the best selection is first thing in the morning...

The also offer the usual lunch options of sandwiches, soups, and salads (premade).  Tried 1/2 chicken salad sandwich on some sort of raisin bread and a chicken noodle salad and 1 drink.  Both were not bad but also not memorable or unique in any way.  Service was  so-so as you got the impression that they were just focused on finishing up lunch service so they could close shop.  In their haste to get orders out they rang up ours wrong and forgot the roll and dressing. \n\nOverall seemed kinda pricey at $18 considering what we ordered and the competition.

The seating is tight and awkward.  It was too chilly and rainy to eat out doors so we made it work.  \n\nWe decided on the half sandwich and soup of the day special.  The sandwich of the day was a roast beef with a cream cheese spread that was supposed to have horseradish and we had 3 soup choices, Tortilla soup, tomato basil bisque and chicken veggie pesto pasta.  Mom decided on the tortilla soup and while I told the lady tomato bisque I was thinkin the chicken pasta...and typical as it is when I picked up my meal on the tray instead of the tomato bisque, they served me the chicken pasta.     \n\nThe soup was plentiful.  Mom made a meal of the soup (her's was heartier than mine) and saved her sandwich.  My soup was more brothy with a dollup of pesto and had frozen style mixed veggies and an assortment of canned beans and a few pieces of pasta (didn't see any chicken).

Here are some of my favorite food choices:\n\nSandwich: I typically build my own sandwich which I like to call Old Faithful. It is a perfect combination of turkey, provolone, lettuce, tomato, with their parmesan pesto spread on a baguette. The parmesan pesto spread is OUT OF THIS WORLD - you haven't lived if you haven't tried it! Their chicken salad is also fantastic. They serve it with lettuce and tomato on their walnut raisin bread, and it is great! They have all kinds of great sandwich creations, all of which I've tried. I am being completely honest when I say I haven't had a bad sandwich at Breadcrafters.\n\nSalads: My favorite is the Napa Valley chicken salad. It has sliced marinated chicken with bleu cheese crumbles and grapes and is served with a champagne vinegrette. It's delish!\n\nPastries: All the pastries are great, but I love their scones and muffins. They are huuuuge portions, so you could make a breakfast out of a scone and cup of coffee. Their desserts are out of this world as well. I highly recommend the apple fritter, brownie (insanely chocolatey), lemon raspberry bars, and their molten chocolate chip cookie (it's a dark chocolate cookie with raspberry).\n\nBread and Dips: My favorite breads are the sourdough, french country (a lighter sourdough), viennese (an egg bread), garlic parmesan and regular baguettes. The dips that they sell are beau monde (a delicious herb/dill dip that's great with veggies), parmesan pesto (my fave!), roasted onion gorgonzola (another fave), and an olive tapenade. \n\nAs far as the service goes, everyone is always SUPER friendly. It's one of those \"cheers-esque\" places where everybody knows your name :) I will be a life-long customer, because this place really knows how to do good, fresh food!", "business_id": "j5HLcBru7FEirYJPbKFVWA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-01-08", "type": "review"}

The only problem was that biting and chewing the sandwich was a bit tough as the crust on the (yummy) sourdough bread was tough, but it was worth it, cause it was good. \n\nHowever, two or three times I have ordered roasted red pepper (which costs extra) and received green pepper instead. I've usually been too hungry to bother asking for red pepper and just eaten the sandwich as is. \n\nI've gotten some sourdough bread to go before, makes for yummy sandwiches at home. \n\nThe other negative is that one of the women who works there before has been a bit standoffish and not very helpful. In one instance, my grandma ordered coffee only to be told they were out of it, in a not so nice tone. \n\nOverall, their bread makes for yummy sandwiches, but starting to wonder if it is worth it to go out of my way for a sandwich and mediocre service.", "business_id": "j5HLcBru7FEirYJPbKFVWA", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-12-11", "type": "review"}

Lots of great patio seating outside.

I also had my heart set on a hot sandwich that I saw on their website, but when I scanned the menu it wasn't even up there.  Oh well.  I got the half focaccia sandwich (turkey ham and salami with parmesan pesto) with the cup of chicken tortilla.  The soup was okay - it had potato, which I thought was odd, and they didn't give me any tortilla strips or any kind of topping for it.  The bread on the sandwich was awesome.  The meats were alright.  I liked the parmesan pesto (it definitely wasn't a pesto though - it was white instead of basil-green), but it was layed on super thick so I couldn't really enjoy the sandwich.  I got a scone to go (ended up not being very scone-like) and also a sliced loaf of the raisin walnut pecan bread.  I like the bread a lot.

MY SANDWICH! \n\nMy friends always tease me when we are searching for a good sandwich shop.  I have been told on more then one occassion that I can be little \"Ross\" or \"Joey\"  like from the show  \"Friends\" when it comes to my sandwiches. \n\nToday, we went to Breadcrafters Bakery and Cafe for lunch, and it was absolutely delicious. I've had many sandwiches from all over the valley and the folks at Breadcrafters Bakery and Cafe are doing up sandwiches right. Lookout,  AJ's Whole Foods, Jimmy Johns, Quiznos, Capriottis, and all the others; Breadcrafters Bakery and Cafe is here.\n\nBreadcrafters offers great lunch specials.  You can get a sandwich and your choice of potato salad, pasta salad, fruit salad,  or chips.  Today, my lunch companion and I had the tuna salad on sourdough and the Focaccia Deluxe  (turkey,ham, salami, provolone, lettuce, tomatoes, Parmesan pesto, on Italian herb bread) with a side of potato salad and fruit salad.  I have to admit the Parmesean Pesto spread  was fantastic and the potato salad is the best I ever had. \n\nAll the breads at Breadcrafters Bakery and Cafe are made fresh daily.  The Walnut Pecan Raisin, Swiss & Black Pepper, look delicious.  I can't wait to try them all on my next visit.\n\nIf your in the area give Breadcrafters a try.  Expect great sandwiches, salads, soups, desserts, and the best customer service.", "business_id": "j5HLcBru7FEirYJPbKFVWA", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-02-10", "type": "review"}

There are other stores that are open.\"\n\n\"Oh no, it's not that...let me turn on the registers again.\" \n\nSomehow she made it sound like she was doing us the favor...and she turned a key and entered in a code and VOILA! the register was open again...all that attitude from the person monitoring the self-checkout just to have her turn a key and enter a code? Lame.\n\nAt the end, when she realized that it wasn't a $2.00 purchase, she was all smiles.\n\nLong story short: go before closing, preferably before the sun sets because it's a little scary...and the parking lot is a little on the dirty side, as was the rest of the store.

Unfortunately the diet/lifestyle i follow really limits as to when/what/where I can eat.

I was smart enough to ensure they would be open. They were open Christmas day from 4am-2pm which is worthy of an extra star right there.\n\nI walked in and knew right away I had entered a happy place. The display cases were filled with amazing looking treats. I was literally SLAPPED in the face with that fresh baked donut smell.\n\nI picked out the following:\nglazed blueberry buttermilk\nglazed buttermilk old fashion\nmaple bar that had been sliced down the middle and filled with some of the richest whipped cream I have ever had.\n\nI cut them all into 3's and sadly had to discard the extra. There is a line between treating yourself and killing yourself.\n\nTHEY WERE STILL WARM! they were amazing.. they, unlike most things that I drool over for months then finally get, lived up to what my brain expected.\n\nThe girl behind the counter was so very nice. She put up with me asking what everything was and being very indecisive. After finding out that anything left over is trashed at the end of the day I had to ask what time they get there to make them fresh. I guess they have a bigger selection on weekends and the crew comes in at 10pm to open at 4am to give us these amazing treats. On the weekdays they get in at midnight.\n\nNext time you feel like treating yourself to a sugar rush this place is worth the visit. Always support the local guys when you can!\n\nI should have taken pictures and noted prices but I was so excited I couldn't help myself. I'll try and do better on my next review :)\n\nPS..

He saw me standing and waiting by the door while others were coming in to dine.  He said somewhat rudely \"You can sit down and wait.  I'll be right with you\"  I never once was  rude to him and I was waiting patiently while he assisted the lady with a party of 8.   I was shocked by his tone and so I walked out. Never eating at that Coco's!  I found a local cafe down the street and so glad I did.", "business_id": "qdI9KaRhOzaJRK0dvGUSaw", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-12-29", "type": "review"}

There seemed to be a decent amount of employees working but no one greeted us or acknowledged us.  A younger girl came over and without even making eye contact, just said in a very low voice, \"hi, how many\", we asked how long the wait would be and she said about 10 minutes.  Weird thing is, we noticed empty tables and booths all around but didn't want to be a pain and say anything, maybe they were short staffed even though they seem to have quite a bit on staff....

Every #!@#'ing time I'm in there, people have their shopping carts stockpiled to the ceiling with stuff from every corner of the store. More stuff than you'd regularly buy at a 'regular' supermarket. Why? I'm pretty sure it will all still be there when you come back. Any time I'm in there to buy just one or two items...yes, just one or two items (so sue me), I have to wait for what seems like eternity for all the stockpiles to get unloaded from the shopping carts. I could drive to Sedona, do the vortex thing, drive back, and the line still wouldn't move. The traffic on I-17 moves faster. The blood flow in Rush Limbaugh's arteries moves faster. And, then, thanks to you impulse shoppers stockpiling every thing in sight like it's Black Friday at Wal-Mart, when I finally get to the checkout, the clerk is so bloomin' exhausted, they're all rude. I've never had a friendly checkout experience at Sprouts. I'm sure if I went there first thing in the moring, I'd get a smile and some good customer service, but now, it's not very bloody likely. So, remember: Stockpile your stuff at Costco. Not Sprouts.

The ham was extremely dry, salty, tough and fat. Totally inedible, The sides, no better than Kraft or Marie Calender in quality and hardly enough to go around. Everybody was disappointed and couldn't wait for desert.\n\nSo, I went back with the awful ham in hand on Monday to get a refund.  Waited at least twenty minutes to speak with the manager.  He handled the refund himself, but would only give me back the $56.for the ham.  He grudgingly said he had credited us back on the the American Express card we used to pay originally.\n\nJust got our Amex statement,  Not only didn't he credit us back at all, he charged us another $56!!!.  So we are now out over $140 for a meal no one could eat.\n\nWhen I tried to talk to the manager again yesterday, some one over there said he was too busy to talk and would call us back.  And of course that never happened.\n\nMy advice.  Want a good ham and want to be really overcharged?  Go to AJ's.  At least you will get something to eat for your money.", "business_id": "Xhrg9t7GGokrQecxXSOvUg", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-12-24", "type": "review"}

If you bring a child that wants to taste-test 10 flavors, they won't reveal any impatience, just friendly cooperation.\n\nYou can sit inside, in the newly remodeled interior, sit outside at the tables provided, or walk around and look in the windows of the local stores.  We like to walk  to Border's after our ice cream treat.\n\n$1.00 kid size scoops every Tuesday.\n\nWhile we do order a variety of flavors, our group is partial to the Jamoca Almond Fudge, Pistachio Almond, Mint Chocolate Chip, Jamoca, Nutty Coconut, and Strawberry Cheesecake.  I haven't seen Chocolate Almond for forever, and it's a little disturbing to think that it may actually be gone!\n\n\nRegrettably, Daiquiri Ice is no longer around, and for that I feel like taking away a star, but it's not this location's fault  that corporate pulled it.

Its in a kinda dodgy industrial area but really no biggie. Easy to find just off the frontage road and a huge sign where to park and where to walk in. I told the girl at the counter it was our first visit and she went through all the info. She was very nice and super helpful.  \nThey have a pamphlet that has all their products outlined and prices (awesome!). You decide what items you'd like and give it back to them, then they pull it. You are not able to just walk around looking at produce in the warehouse (which I admit was my anticipation) She said if we would like to see anything specific, one of the guys would take us to the product and then back up to the front. \n-During the week Monday-Friday you can only buy items BY THE CASE. This is VERY IMPORTANT to know if your visiting for the first time. \n-They do a Farmers Market on Saturday Mornings and that is the only time they offer items to be sold individually. (EX 1 head of lettuce VS 1 Case of lettuce)\n-The prices are extremely reasonable and if your into juicing this is your place! (as you go thru fruits & Veggies like crazy).\n-If your order is over 100.00 they offer free delivery! \n-Lastly, this is where Bountiful Baskets gets all of their products. I've done BB before and liked it, but I would much rather pick my own products weekly.\n-If you're smart, get a couple people to go in on an order and have them deliver it to you and split it up yourselves. The savings is worth it. \n\nI hope this is helpful to others!! I had a ton of questions and wasn't really able to get many answers, so I thought I would share some key details for those interested.

Their menu has the basic essentials and then sum for soups, salads, sandwiches and baked goods. They advertise everything is made from scratch and always fresh which I know first hand as I am a frequent patron here. If your passing through Phoenix Sky Harbor and would like to satisfy your appetite this will be the place I highly recommend. For starters I would order a \"half combination\" which consist of a half sandwich half soup, half sandwich half salad or a half salad half soup. Paradise has a variety of sandwich choices from chicken, turkey, ham or even a vegetarian sandwich to go along with a wide selection of your choice of bread. Soups? take your pick depending on what day of the week it is is what they have available, however they always have their house special soup called the Roasted Tomatoe soup which they top off with crispy tortilla strips and a drizzle of sour cream and given a freshly oven baked dinner roll to compliment your soup. If a light salad is what your more in the mood for they can assist with that at the salad bar where you will feel empowered to make your choices known of what you would like your salad to turn out to be and while your at it don't forget to pick up a chocolate chip cookie, carrot cake, bagel or cinnamon roll all freshly baked from the oven.\n\nOASN: Soups are not permitted through security, however salad dressing in packets or small containers 3 ounces or less then are TSA and Airline permitted. Lastly, Paradise also has a just for kids menu which consist of Macaroni and cheese, Turkey or Ham sandwich or Peanut Butter & Jelly.\n\nNow go and get a taste of PARADISE!", "business_id": "Cm1jT60fxb1DjwpqjWJ8EA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-02-16", "type": "review"}

The expectation is about as basic as I'm ever going to have regarding food.  Paradise Bakery, which apparently is a very well-regarded local chain, really needs to assess how to translate their successes into an airport setting.  Although she appeared to be very bored, the young lady at the counter was friendly-- no attitude problem.  I wanted mayo instead of their \"Paradise Sauce,\" and she delivered here, as well.  The sandwich was reasonably thick with meat, greens and tomatoes.  Bread, which was understood to be their strong suit, was over-sized and a bit stale; perhaps I waited too long to eat it.  There were no bottles of unsugared soda, but water was fine.  Where did things go wrong?  First, there wasn't enough paper used to wrap the sandwich and keep it intact; how expensive would 3\" of additional paper on a $7.50 sandwich have been?  Next, no napkins were packed; this should be an automatic at airport carryout.  Third, for some reason, a chocolate chip cookie was thrown into the bag.  For reasons which will be clear in a moment, it was very broken (but very tasty) when I found it.  Finally, although I specifically asked for a cheap plastic bag, I was given a froufrou paper mini shopping bag with an \"adorable\" paper handle.  I don't need to impress my fellow passengers with my good taste in shopping bags, I needed something which will neatly compress to be stowed.  If you have ever tried to reassemble a sandwich while in the middle seat of an airplane, you get the picture.  The end-product was adequate, with mayo and tomato covered hands as an added bonus.

The place is pretty ancient and they have a back patio that more closely resembles a small prison yard where the birds will steal your free chips if you venture back inside. That area could be nicer with some sort of makeover, but when is the last time a Mexican joint ever underwent a makeover? The food looked nice on the plate, but I don't need a small pile of lettuce/salad in this ethnic cuisine. The side cup of guac was good and both hot sauces had some kick, but the Relleno was marred by a mushy crust and the use of yellow, not white cheese, in the middle. The rice and beans were probably above normal quality, but the Relleno was just run of the mill for 7 bucks. Still a good crowd at 1:30pm, but most bakery items were sold out by then.", "business_id": "d2AeNB4xw67E1Bzpo1Pm7Q", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-01-23", "type": "review"}

I come here saturday mornings, looking like death warmed over seeking the warm and reassuring sustenance of their delicious fare.

Azteca is one of my favorite places to bring my family for a quick breakfast, since they all love it and it's easy on the wallet.

You know who you are. \nThis is about as it good as it gets for the Phoenix area. Everything is homemade and delicious.\n\nThe green corn tamales are absolutely stellar. This beauty comes out wrapped in waxed paper and corn husk to maintain the moisture and heat. It's like unwrapping presents at Christmas time, a pure delight! Top this bad boy with green sauce and dive in to find kernels of corn complemented by the perfect sweetness. The green chile is also superb and highly recommended. \n\nThe staples even stand on their own. Your meal begins with crispy chips fresh out the fryer! Throw a little salt and green sauce on them and enjoy. The consistency and flavor of the beans is just right and they are not offensively overwhelmed with cheese as so many other restaurants. The rice always has great flavor, but can range in moisture from slightly dry to very moist depending on the day (I'm assuming different cooks.) And lastly the flour tortillas. These goodies are concealed by foil to keep them piping hot. Every time I unwrap them I get a little giddy. The smell is just so damn good! There are few things better than flour tortillas with rice and beans. This is just about the best threesome I have ever had. \n\nThe only downside to Azteca is the limited daytime hours, and the large lunch crowds. If you love Mexican food, and have not eaten here you must make it a point to come. You will NOT be disappointed. I almost forgot it is also very inexpensive with most of the combos ranging from $5-6ish.", "business_id": "d2AeNB4xw67E1Bzpo1Pm7Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-02-23", "type": "review"}

It was amazing.  I can't believe this is only 15 minutes from my cookie cutter stucco house.  It's almost hard to believe it's even in Phoenix - though to a native like me, it's just one more reason to remember why Phoenix is so great.  \n\nWhen most folks used to think of South Phoenix they thought of crime, blight and anything else associated with being on the \"wrong\" side of the tracks.  Sure, there may have been areas right next to downtown that were like that, but most of South Phoenix was all farming community.  While some of this still exists - especially near and in Laveen - most of these farm plots were sold off during the years to individuals for their own homes - and any of the large lots were sold off to developers in the last 10-15 years or so.  Most of these became mass produced houses (like mine) or shopping centers.  The Farm is off of 32nd street (with property stretching back almost to 24th street) between Baseline and Southern.   To put this in perspective - there is a huge Target/Fry's/Ross/Applebee's kind of complex at 24th and Baseline - and the South Mountain Community College is just North of that on 24th.  At 32nd and Baseline there is the Raven Golf course, with lots of condos all around it.  That all seems a whole world away once you pull in to The Farm.\n\nI'm attaching some pictures from their web site www.thefarmatsouthmountain.com.  I've been only to one of the restaurants so far - The Farm Kitchen which is their lunch spot.  But I plan to visit Morning Glory soon.  All the stores are amazing - and it's so cool to see where it all grows.  As we walked by the gardens it was great to see some kids (and adults) having the process explained to them of how they grow the food organically here - and it could end up at one of their restaurants, in one of the nicer restaurants in the valley, or sold at their Farmers market to be eaten in their own home.\n\nCheck out their menus online.  Yes - it's a bit pricey.  I was hesitant that I'd think it was \"worth it\".  But oh it was.  I can't explain it any better than stealing from a commercial - You can TASTE the freshness!  Everything just tasted so much better.  Not that the atmosphere didn't help - but it wasn't the only factor.  One interesting thing to mention - pets are ok.  There were two folks there who brought their dogs.  The doggies seemed quite happy to have some run around space (leashed of course) and then a nice meal by a picnic bench.  \n\nI'm planning to go again - bringing lots of friends and family at different times.  I'd love to try out their yoga and/or gardening classes too! This will definitely be on the short list of places a visitor needs to go when visiting from out of town.  Better yet though - it's one of the few places you can go in town and feel like you took a day trip out of the valley.", "business_id": "MLcXtnpzygZvQ9BtseLLlw", "stars": 5, "date": "2006-12-28", "type": "review"}

I had brunch/breakfast with my fiance, a friend, and an out of towner with his friend.  We had breakfast at the Morning Glory Cafe and it was delicious!  Three of us had mimosas (Thanks Kristin for the tip on those - they were delicious and too cute with the individual bottles) and the serve yourself beverage bar was convenient.  I had french toast with a side of potatoes and my fiance had the monte cristo with a side of bacon.  I would recommend both entrees.  We both ate all of our food (which was a lot) and didn't feel overly full, which was nice.  The potatoes were delicious and the bacon was so-so.  You would think for $2.50 you would get 3-4 thick, juicy slices of bacon.  Instead, you get 2 kinda puny, nothing-to-write-home-about strips.\n\nThe atmosphere is fun and earthy.  Too bad it was overcast and a little chilly.  Otherwise, it would have been perfect.  It's a nice setting in the midst of \"the farm\" complete with veggies growing and chickens in the coop (beware of the smell folks if you wander in that direction).  There are also other vendors selling art, jewelery, and other pieces.  My favorite was watching the man selling bread.  He seemed like the nicest man and was so happy to pair a person with the perfect loaf.  My fiance didn't get that from watching him, but I could tell.  We went over to buy some bread and he was in fact one of the most genuinely jolly people I've met - and I don't use the word \"jolly\" very often, but it fits him perfectly.  He had us smell the asiago loaf, introduced us to the jalapeno Cheddar, and finally sold us on the rosemary with sea salt.  It was $7, which I would normally think is ridiculous, but for as often as I'll probably make it out here, I bet I'll buy a loaf from him every time if he's around.

In fact, I think I'm headed there momentarily.\n\nMany people write reviews for the various \"businesses\" at the Farm on South Mountain on the wrong Business/Venue pages.  But I guess this listing is a catch-all for everything.  Let's see if I can help people get this clear.  I really want to point that the Farm at South Mountain has several \"businesses\" and venues listed on Yelp.  You can go here for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  You can have your baby shower here or your 200+ person wedding and reception here.  You can hold a corporate event in \"Stoned Grove\" area around an outdoor pizza oven or you can have an intimate dinner under mature trees with glimmers of stars at night at Quiessence.  This place is a one stop shop for everything simple and beautiful in the out of doors.  I've written reviews for a few of the places on the farm and I will let those reviews speak for themselves.  I've posted pics too... \n\nOne of the things that the Yelping community might appreciate knowing is that you should visit their website for special events.  Sometimes, they have special Farm dinners.  Sometimes there's a special holiday dinner or lunch.  For instance, I know for Valentine weekend, they have Valentine Dinners and Picnic lunches.  \n\nHere are my reviews of places on the farm:\n\nMaya's Farm (At the end of the Farm Drive and directly North.)\nOrganic Certified Farm.  See them at the Farm on Sunday mornings.  Phoenix Public Market on Saturdays and also get on their CSA)-\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/mayas-farm-phoenix#hrid:5dPGtdn4SQIClbJ_uIe1zw\n\nSucculentia (it is in the green house on the north side of the farm, back by Maya's garden House)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/succulentia-phoenix#hrid:Z91CIQ4jVqF9RG3HrRe22w\n\nThe Farm Kitchen \n(Lunch/Brunch and is the closest to the Picnic Tables.  you see it immediately as you enter the farm, north of  \"The Farm Driveway\".)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/the-farm-kitchen-phoenix#hrid:7w3mgerwC9Yqd_b1amkDjA/src:self\n\nMorning Glory \n(Breakfast only, but the patio is a nice place to rent for an event.

It was pricey!  I understand that they use local/organic ingredients, but still I think it could be priced a bit lower.  The bread on the sandwich wasn't that great either.  Slightly on the dry side and I didn't like the crust, too hard.  The biggest drawback for me was that I was still hungry after eating my $11 sandwich!  I went home and ate another meal....\n\nMy friend got a TEENY tiny Greek salad - literally it could have fit in a 1 cup measuring cup (which they don't even serve with Greek dressing by the way... so the only thing that really makes it \"Greek\" is the olives and sprinkles of feta) and it cost like $6, meh.\n\nService: 2 stars\nEven though there was no line behind me, I felt like I was being rushed through.  And this being my first time there I had questions, but the lady at the counter didn't seem receptive to answering them for me.  For example, I asked if I could substitute salad for soup in the sandwich/soup combo and all she said was \"the salads are over there\".... that's not an answer!\n\nAmbiance: 4 stars\nBEAUTIFUL grounds with lovely tall pecan trees towering over a lawn with lots of outdoor picnic tables to eat your lunch.  and lots of cute little nooks to explore.  There are duck pens in the back, a little shop where they sell plants, and overall just a really cute and lovely setting.  The location/grounds are the best reason to return.

I decided to try the White Russian Mocha, hot (they do offer it in iced as well.)\n\nI'm a little hungry, but sadly their pastry case had nothing that made me want to buy.  The only thing that stood out in the random assortment of typical muffins and danish was the banana nut bread, but as I'm mildly allergic to bananas, I decided not to risk it.\n\nAs I sit here and sip the coffee, I'm very pleased.  It's great, full flavor, and a nice sweet mocha flavor without being cloying.  When I have a Frappuchino, I always feel as if I'm about to go into diabetic shock and it leaves a weird film in my mouth.

Because of the remodel, there is markedly more available seating, all while maintaining a nice open feel to it. They've added a wall mounted flat screen television to the dining area at well. While we were there, the television was only being used to display internal advertisements. So, I'm not sure if it's connected to any type of service provider. \n\nOne of my favorite additions, however, is at the drink machine. I've mentioned it in another review that I am mildly phobic about touching drink lids. I've been known to throw the top one away just to get to an untainted one. Here, however, they've invested in a lid dispenser. Just open the door, and it automatically grabs one lid just for you.\n\nAesthetics weren't the only upgrades Panda Express has made. Although the menus is basically the same, there is one very important addition that caught my eye. They now offer Grilled Teriyaki Chicken. This is by far the healthiest option on the menu for anybody looking to maintain some semblance of a healthy diet while you're out and about.\n\nAll in all, this is a decent place to stop and eat if you're at Desert Ridge.", "business_id": "4DDbIvNtzfhLRwz-EOLFDA", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-02-02", "type": "review"}

We walked in and were informed that there was a 30 minute wait for a table in the \"dining room\" but that we could opt to sit in the bar area.  So we did the latter.  There were lots of open booths in the \"dining room\", which was kind of frustrating, but I know that restaurants have to stagger their tables so the kitchen doesn't get overloaded...but seriously, it's a big restaurant...\n\nI've been to Rock Bottom several times, both in Denver and Arizona, and I've never had an overly pleasant experience.

The waitress would disappear for long periods of time, and all the other waitresses wouldn't make eye contact with anyone other than the diners at their tables.  Frustrating...\n\nWe had the pretzels to start, which were really good.

Sub-par.  \n\nI had the steak spinach salad, which was described as \"fresh baby greens with gorgonzola, walnuts, tomatoes and red onion tossed in a balsamic vinegarette\".  The red onion overwhelmed the salad.  The tomato was mealy.  There was hardly any gorgonzola, and the walnuts were nonexistant.  I was bombarded with soggy croutons.  Rock Bottom is just not the place to spend money on food.  It's a bar with a handful of unique beers.

The good news is the beers are still awesome.  Had the Winter Wheat - served with a slice of orange and a sprinkle of nutmeg.  Mmmm...\n\nFoodwise, the new, slimmer menu was a bit sad for me.  No more salmon fish & chips and no more meatloaf.  My two Rock Bottom favorites.  Ordered Mac & Chicken and Mac+Chicken+Chorizo.  A side of fries for my picky 2-year old and the badass ballpark pretzels to start.  Now, admittedly, this is bar food and has always been on the salty side, but they've gone a step further.  Now, I do like to binge on hugely salty food once in a while, so I won't say I didn't love it, but I can literally feel it now... Blood pressure meds, here I come...\n\nThe big bummer was the service.  It started out with the hostesses.  Friendly enough, but it was a bit off-putting to be asked twice if we needed a high-chair (and respond twice that no, just a booster would be great) and then end up with no booster.  Walked back up to the front and asked again, no problem.  OK, so far.  So, then, we sit down... and we wait.  No problem, must be busy... Friday night, holiday season at a big shopping spot... but wait, those are empty tables... 6 of 'em in our section the whole time (maybe shoulda taken that as a sign).  \n\nAnyway, after about 5 minutes, our server comes.  She's friendly/pleasant.  We order our drinks and the pretzels.  Drinks come just fine.  Another few minutes later, she returns to take our order.  No problems, but 2 place settings.  3 people.  Hostess doesn't notice.  Waitress doesn't notice.  Then, I see what appears to be a manager stealing settings from one table and putting on another... so, I follow suit and steal one myself.  Problem solved.\n\nAbout 60 seconds later, our lukewarm fries arrive.  Whatever.  Just for the kid.  Appreciate the speed.  That's followed a minute later by my wife's side salad.  About 10 minutes later the pretzels show up, followed by our entries 45 seconds later.  Nice timing.  Then, the kid starts griping about no ketchup.  Hmmm... that's odd... Fries, but no ketchup and no ask from the server.  Whatever. So another couple minutes goes by, and we see our server flying by and flag her down.  Ketchup for all.\n\nDuring this time, I overhear the table behind me working through a problem with their bill (charged for 3 beers they never ordered or drank).\n\nIf this were a Denny's, I'd be more than pleased with the service.  But, maybe I'm getting picky/cheap in my old age, but it feels like it's kinda shoddy for a $25/head meal.  \n\nOur waitress was pleasant and earnest, but clearly undertrained.  The several tables left unbussed around us for the duration of our meal was also a clear indicator.  The three hostesses on duty unable to effectively service a light crowd was another sign.  This place clearly has systemic management issues.  \n\nWon't be coming back to this location (though I'll keep an eye on the GM sign in the window and try it again when it changes again).

Unfortunately, the custard itself was just not the same.\n\nIt tasted like plain ol' chocolate ice cream.  There wasn't anything custard-like about it.  :(\n\n**Upon searching for reviews on the Net, I found that the Neiesens had sold the shop to a different owner, which would explain the downfall of  my favorite dessert spot.

Also on my visit today, I tried using a coupon for a \"free bagel thin with light shmear.\" The picture in-store advertised the bagel thin with pink cream cheese and my kids were excited to get their bagel with strawberry cream cheese (which is also listed as one of their reduced-fat options, which means \"light,\" right?) When I ordered this, however, I was told that this was not possible because corporate is only allowing them to use ONE kind of light shmear for this promotion. Even the general manager refused to make a substitution, while watching my 3-year-old cry with disappointment (I know, it's a little thing, but come on, he's 3.)

After requesting as adult size water, I ordered the spicy shrimp salad. In 30 minutes it came but the shrimp were clear and mushy. I had not desire to have food poisoning over the weekend so I asked for it to be cooked a bit more. They agreed to recook it but it came out the exact same. Uggg!

Customers were talking among themselves and to us about how they weren't sure how long the wait was because no one greeted them and surveyed the many empty tables available. One group of folks walked out after waiting. April finally came by after 5 or 10 minutes and seated the growing line.  When it was our turn, April didn't once make eye contact with us. Not even after reaching our table and seating us.  I figured maybe she was stressed out or busy... But still. That really set the mood. \n\nI don't remember our waitresses name. But I can tell you that she wasn't all that concerned with us for at least another 10 minutes. When she did visit our table, she was very unenthused about it and made me feel like she must have been waitressing for 20+ years... and is just sick of it. \nGrandma and I both decided on soup and salad.  Butternut squash soup looked like my grandma was eating baby food. Gross! Consistency, color, taste, everything. My tortilla chicken soup was slopped all around my bowl, there was more tortilla chips than soup... And the tortilla soup wasn't even tasty. Just bad.  Our waitress did not seem concerned that we didn't eat much at all of our soup as she brought out our salads. Even after I told her mine was just awful, I get a \"alright, do you want something else?\" And that was that. Uh, no I don't. \n\nWe got up to leave after about 20-30 seconds of investigating our salads for traces of chicken. Mine had NONE and hers had a whopping 3 pieces.  Caesar salad was practically glued together by thick dressing and sprinkled with breadcrumbs or something. \n\nWe waited politely at the cashiers counter (which is where you take your bill to pay) to inform someone that we were leaving. Caroline wasn't our waitress, but arrived and appeared genuinely upset by our experience and asked us if she could please wait on us in her section. Poor girl had no idea what we'd been through (not to mention the layer of dust covering the place).  She insists on bringing the manager over... Only to find out that it was April: the first gal who sat us at our table. \n\nThe only thing Coco's has going for it is Caroline.  She was empathetic and professional.\n\nCaroline: get a serving job somewhere more your speed (meaning better). \n\nYelpers: OMG RUN FOR THE HILLS BECAUSE WE DIDN'T PAY A DIME FOR THIS CRAP AND LEFT HUNGRY.", "business_id": "c3xkboF2p9rfzUFpBBn_tQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-01-29", "type": "review"}

It's a hot spot, evidently, as the drive thru line was long AND there was a line halfway to the door inside. \n\nI chose to park and go inside. It was the slowest moving line I have seen at a Starbucks in a while. I ordered my drink \"a tall nonfat latte, one pump gingerbread,\" which is how I was taught to order the drink at another location I visit occasionally because, I was told, they don't charge for one pump. \n\nThe girl behind the register put my drink in as a \"nonfat gingerbread latte\" and charged me for the $0.40 difference. When I attempted to correct my order, \"I actually just want a latte with one pump gingerbread,\" her retort was \"it's only like $0.20 difference.\" \n\nWELL, Miss Moneybags, it's $0.40 different. And, because of your unwillingness to accept my order as placed, I paid you for additional pumps of syrup, whip cream and God knows what other goodies you put on top of a gingerbread latte... because, I certainly don't know... I only PAY for the crap, thanks to you, I don't actually take my drink that way! \n\nSo, yeah, \"I have had better\" and I don't think I will be back.

He's a chocolate freak too and he and I agree that the chocolate offerings at Angel Sweet are second to none. Unlike Gelato Spot, who doesn't always have a pure chocolate offering (usually they have hazelnut or almond in them), Angel Sweet usually has two pure chocolates that can be mixed with something else of your choice. \nI love the fact that I can get two flavors of my choice even in the small size. Yay!\nSo if you're craving chocolate-covered strawberries, go for the Super Dark Chocolate with strawberry, raspberry or any other similar fruity flavor--the pairing is wonderful!\nAlso, if they have the Chocolate Cake Batter, that's a winner with Coconut.\n\nAnd while I won't say that it's THE BEST gelato I've ever had--that goes to Glace Faite Maison in Ille.

Yes it has free wifi, but forgive me for being underwhelmed, considering that pretty much every coffee shop that doesn't have a green logo does. Even then, their obnoxious password system resulted in problems getting the wifi working on my iPhone.\nThe indoor seating arrangement is odd, which has left me feeling uncomfortable if I don't get one of the few seats I like. The outdoor seating is nice, but you won't last long in the evening if you dislike smoke nor in the day if you dislike ducks.\nSome fools who go here see fit to feed the ducks, which during the day results in ducks coming to you begging for food and crapping nearing your feet.

They're usually just a blend of ice, some sort of syrup or soda, and (depending on what you order) milk. A little fresh fruit, or frozen fruit, or any sort of 'real' ingredient, would go a long way. Instead they seem concerned with making these drinks as cheaply as possible.\nThe baklava I only tried once, since it tasted like it had been sitting out way too long. It's possible I just had some on a bad day, but I won't be ordering it again unless I'm really craving baklava.\nMost of the baristas are friendly, but a couple are real pr*cks who will wipe the smile off your face if you interact with them.

I'm thinking \"really??? are you serious??\" I was super surprised at that statement and frankly, really annoyed.

There were already 3 different kinds of sweeteners there on the shelf for ppl to add as they please, why do they have to add sugar to the cinnamon and nutmeg shakers?..

However, there is one staff member who is just downright unpleasant to work with; the man with the  weird ponytail (not the owner). On multiple occasions he has spoken with me and my group in a very condescending way. Once a large group of us had walked in to get drinks, and one guy in our party had a soft drink from the restaurant we had just ate at, and the weird ponytail employee immediately told him he has to get rid of it or get out, little did he know that the guy was going to finish his drink and order something in a few minutes, but the employee's rude attitude cost the business a sale. On another occasion, I was having a meeting and while waiting on everybody to arrive, the weird ponytail employee told us, very rudely, that in order to save a table, at least half the table's members must have drinks; I looked around and there was only one couple at a table, the other inside tables were all completely free. Maybe when they are packed that makes sense, but when we were waiting on people to arrive for less than 10 minutes and the shop was empty, there is no reason to be so rude about it. \n\nI'm very disappointed that an outstanding coffee shop like Coffee Rush allows this employee to be as rude/annoying as he is.

If you sit there for 5 minutes waiting for someone to arrive and have not bought a drink yet, he will physically come and tell you that you need to purchase a drink or leave. Also don't even think about bringing a cup from another eating establishment, this guy will practically scream at you to leave if he sees it. \n\nI can understand in both situations that if someone is in the shop for hours without buying anything, or is continuously bringing in outside coffee and just sitting in the shop for free that you may speak to them, but even then there is a calm and polite way to speak to people at a business, and this guy clearly does not understand how to interact with humans beings in the right way.

The lakefront and the hip vibe are really cool and all, but every single time I visit I leave wanting to cuss someone out. I'll use the last three visits as examples. I was there an I ordered a black coffee and a baklava. The coffee was actually cold in my mouth. This I thought must just be a one time oversight, and I went in to see if I could get a fresh pot. The barista (short guy with dark hair) told me that he would have to charge me for another cup, so I just tossed it in the garbage and went back outside to eat my baklava. I took one bite and was repulsed because I got a mouthful of pinesol. I went back in to get a coffee to go, and noticed that there was a bottle of pinesol on the counter behind the pastry case. I ate actual pinesol. What.\n\nThe second time I went there, I was with a friend and her little sister, and when she tried to order for her little sister, the barista said \"excuse me I think she can order her own drink\". We left and went to Starbucks.\n\nThe last time I was there, some friends and I had just finished eating at a nearby restaraunt, and came to coffee rush to sit and chat. I ordered coffee and my two friends sat down with me. It was late, we were the only ones there. The barista came outside to tell us that one of my friends had to order a drink because they had a \"majority policy\" or some ridiculous greedy thing. Irritated, I handed him a five and said \"chai latte\". He responded by saying \"uh you can come inside dude.\" If you're going to walk outside to tell me we need to order another drink, you can also walk outside to bring me said drink. \n\nIn conclusion, absolute worst customer service I've ever had, an absurdly misplaced elitist sense of self ignorant hubris over some of the worst coffee you can throw away a dollar on, and to pin it all down, a filthy establishment with no regard for the integrity of their own product. They appear to believe they are worthy of respect and admiration if only because they're not starbucks. If I could give zero stars I would.

Are you a fan of the 'ethnic' aisle in your local grocery store? If you are... even a little bit, then you should run to Lee Lee's right now; you'll have a blast. Lee Lee's is basically a giant ethnic supermarket... except unlike many of the smaller ones scattered randomly around town, it's clean and well managed. Aisles and aisles of stuff you've most likely never seen before await you. \n\nAs far as size goes, it's about as big as your average Fry's or Safeway and includes a restaurant, a mini gift store, and pretty much every department you'd come to expect in a normal grocery store. It's kind of fun walking in, on occasion I've felt like I was one of the only English speaking people in the place... which is kind of nice; helps me feel like I'm not in Arizona for a split second. \n\nMy favorite thing to do here is simply 'browse'. I usually end up buying just a handful of stuff, but I could spend hours simply going up and down each aisle and picking up random stuff to look at. It really is fun to see so many imported and unusual items... for example last time I went I ended up leaving with a bag full of imported Chinese candy, some weird noodles that I'd never heard of before, and some odd imported fruit. I ended up discovering a couple gems in my random selections. \n\nThe only possible downside for some people is the fish smell... they have a giant fish and meat section here; so by default the store occasionally has just a little bit of a fishy smell in some areas... despite this it's always clean and well kept, so this is a minor gripe and comes with the territory for having such an extensive fish market. Most people should love this place though... unless you're the type of person who doesn't like to experiment at all with food, then I wholeheartedly recommend a trip to Lee Lee's. You'll more than likely find some stuff that piques your interest, or at the very least you'll have a good time browsing through things you won't see at any other store in AZ.", "business_id": "5KG0A3WlC7K3DAXtrIFFjg", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-02-23", "type": "review"}

For 5.00 of the same ice cream its triple the size in California and 1/3 of the size in Arizona. That makes a lot of sense. Also i have not been able to find any good red bean bread or ube bread or ensymada with ube or coconut in it here or anywhere in Arizona. What is going on in the world?!

The first thing i had to find out if there was decent boba here there is(but still does not beat Nor Cal's)  So the fact that everything i really want is not here is the reason for the negative star.  \n\nI never really expect QUALITY Customer service at asian markets only because my mom used to work at one when i was very little and you can't expect the best.

I actually find Super L Ranch Market on 44th Street, at the COFCO center, to be a better selection of Asian food items with which I'm familiar and thus, Lee Lee's probably suffers by comparison.\n\nI did however, find some great Jamaican hot sauce with Scotch bonnet peppers and mustard that just rocks and maybe that is the whimsical delight of visiting a story like Lee Lees, in the modified words of Forest Gump, Lee Lees is like a box of chocolates, many of which you have never heard of or imagined could exist and thus, you never know what your going to get.\n\nBottom line, for anyone who is a bit of a foodie, Lee Lees will be an experience and worth checking out.

My Puerto Rican heritage thanks you, Lee Lee's.\n\nYou probably won't be able to read 95% of the packages because they are in a different language.  Into my shopping cart you go!  Be adventurous!  Try all of the things!\n\nThe aisles are thoughtfully divided into regions so you have somewhat of an idea of what you're getting yourself into.  The Japanese aisles are my favorite.  Seaweed everywhere!!!  \n\nThe beer selection is awesome.\n\nIt's your one stop shop for anything ethnic.  Oh, you need something from your culture?

All they had is orange flavor, but I talked to a lady who said sometimes she comes in and they have flavor after flavor stacked up, and sometimes she comes in and they don't have any at all. Which is about par for the course, I'm guessing. With so many countries to import from, my guess is you just sort of take what you can get.\n\nEvery kind of noodle, and every kind of spice, and every kind of canned anything, and a whole aisle of lovely imported candies.

I went on the 12th of November and it wasn't my favorite festival but still highly interesting. My mother had told me about it and I decided to check it out, because I'm not really a Greek buff, but I do love learning about different cultures. I also wasn't really aware there was such a large Greek community in the Chandler area, so the whole idea of the festival was really interesting. I learned a few little knicks and knacks of Greek culture and I found I had a pretty large appreciation for the performers and the church goers who promoted and ran the festival. It is all opened, set up, and run by the Church's members and some select fellow Greek establishments from across the metropolitan area. The atmosphere was really friendly, and everyone I spoke with was very nice as well. There was everything in the world greek to explore, they had wine tasting for those of you over 21, as well as traditional music, dance, and food.  The festival itself was pretty pricey though, and I had never been, so I wasn't entirely sure of what to expect price wise. My youngest sister who is under 12 got in for free, but I paid about $36 for me, my fifteen year old sister, and my boyfriend.  I then found I had to spend even more money to buy \"tickets\", which are used to buy food and drinks as well as a majority of the entertainment for the kids. There was a bounce house and some mazes and things for the kids, but spending all that money on everything honestly kind of killed my good mood. \nHowever, I must say the food was great, and it lifted me out of my spending funk. I'd never had any \"Greek food\" before, so I wasn't really sure what to expect or think of it, I just knew I was starving and the food had best be flavorfull and fufulling for all the money I'd spent on buying tickets for it. I got a Gyro, which is a sort of sandwich on pita bread with some tomatoes and a sauce called \"tzatziki sauce\". I received a chicken gyro, which was hot, well cooked, and defiantly flavorful, as I had hoped. It was actually completely worth the buy and it also filled me up so I wasn't hungry later, another big point in my deciding on wether or not it was satisfacroty. There was nothing I was dissatisfied with about my food. My younger sister got one as well, and although she's a picky one, she enjoyed it. My other sister and my boyfriend both got traditional lamb gyros and also had no complaints as well, with my sister alerting me she enjoyed the sauce particulaly. \nOverall, I'd say my experience was pretty good, and I'd recommend anybody with an appreciation on culture to go to the festival. I do warn It is a bit costly if you're going in a group, but affordable, and pretty much worth the spending you'll do. The food was excellente, and I would have to say whoever caters the festival does a great job.", "business_id": "4kPDzSReLzJa0gQSjuHWvQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-12-01", "type": "review"}

(Believe me, I've tried.)\n\nSince we were there during happy hour, we decided to share the Spicy Ahi Tuna Tempura Roll and she wanted the HH caesar salad.  The ahi tuna roll and the salad came out fairly quick, and no wonder, since the roll only consisted of four tiny pieces!  We were hungry, and the pieces were so diminutive, that I didn't even get a chance to take a photo of the dish!  It was very tasty, but certainly not substantial, so I took another look at the HH menu and settled on the hummus.  While waiting for it to arrive, Mom and I shared the nicely-sized caesar salad, which was crisp-fresh and not overly-dressed.  \n\nWe decided to hold off on the salad for awhile, so as not to fill ourselves up on it.  The hummus and grilled pita bread arrivedl, and they too were flavorful; We couldn't get enough!  While we normally would've stuck w/ the happy hour menu, Mom had caught sight of a neighboring table's two platters and admired one of them, so I decided to order not the one she thought looked appetizing (the menu description turned her off), but what I had originally wanted to order instead of the hummus plate- a chicken pasta dish from the seasonal menu.  Two chicken breasts, pounded thin, battered, then fried, sitting atop of spaghetti w/ a basil-pesto cream sauce.  On top of the chicken were slices of prosciutto and dressed arugula greens sprinkled w/ grated parmesan.  This dish tasted fabulous, and the different textures it offered made me swoon!  (I knew Mom enjoyed it as well, for she repeated at least two times how great the food was!)  However, I knew that the greasiness of this dish would haunt me after.  Still, a great savory dish, and next time, I'll just skip the happy hour menu (save the caesar salad, that's a must!) and order from the dinner menu, instead.\n\nGreat service, as always, although I just remembered that the honey wheat bread I had asked for arrived stale.  Funny that the server had even bothered to serve it, as she did warn us that it wasn't as fresh as it could be and that a new batch was baking in the oven.  Why even bring stale, hardened bread to the table?

Sure the waits on Saturday nights suck, but that's how it is any place you might venture into unless its a little known gem.  But for me, the wait is completely worth it.  I eat whatever the heck I wanna eat, no matter how much heavy cream is in the sauce or how much sugar is in the desert or how much fried is in the fried whatever.  And yeah, I pay for it around the midsection but hey.\n\nAnyhow, the service has always been good, even close to closing time.   Bad service once in awhile is inevitable, and I'm sure I'll receive it here sooner or later, but so far we've been fortunate.  Whether we have a large party or just a couple of us, our food has come out in a timely manner each visit.  And none of us have had cold dishes.\nOne of my cousins even changed her order after she got the first one and didn't like it...the waitress didn't even skip a beat.\n\nSo far, I've had mostly pasta/rice dishes.  My favorite dish here at the moment is the something something Gumbo.  Its oddly rich and subtle at the same time, the kind of thing that makes you keep shoveling forkfulls in your mouth just to delight at this combo.  The sauce is creamy but not too heavy with just enough kick.  Like I said its subtle, but at the same time its a great flavor experience.\nOther dishes I've tried are the New Orleans shrimp something or another, and another cajun type dish.  Both were extremely tasty with HUGE shrimp, pieces of sausage or chicken or whatever was in it.  \n\nThey DO NOT skimp on the portions.  I've read that some people are actually turned off by this.  I just think that if I'm paying money to eat, I should get as much for that money as possible.  And here, you do.  Last night, we commented on how a dish that costs only $13 could be chocked full of so many big fresh shrimp.  And recently, one of the kids and his dad ordered one of the burgers...this thing was a friggin' MONSTER!  It could eat a human.  And sure it would make any health-conscious person run for the hills, but for the rest of us, this burger would make your eyes get so big your eyeballs might fall out of their sockets.  Let's just say Red Robin's burgers look like White Castles compared to this.  Sadly, this specific burger is no longer on the menu, and to custom do it, they would've charged extra.  So that wasn't cool.\n\nAnd I think that is the only negative point I might have.  Seriously, I love this place.  Its only got 4 stars cause its not somewhere I can just up and say \"let's go!\" because of the prices.  Well......let's rethink that.  See, I HAVE to have cheesecake.  After all, it IS the Cheesecake Factory.  Its their defining thingy.  And cheesecake (plus a beverage) is what really rolls my bill over the line.  But is the cheesecake all that???  Oh my friggin goodness, yes.\n\nI cannot speak for all the cheesecakes on the extensive menu, for I simply cannot get past the Banana whatever cheesecake.  This is just the best cheesecake I have ever put in my mouth.  I won't attempt to describe it, just know that if you like anything to do with bananas, this is for you.  You two were meant to meet.  Destiny.\n\nAnd about that extensive menu...yeah its big.  Soooo many choices.  They've got pastas, rice dishes, platters, burgers, steaks, seafoods, pizzas (the littlest in our fam ordered a pizza and it was 2 times as big as his head)...and then of course all the appetizers, drinks, and deserts.  I don't know why someone would ever complain about a big menu.  That's beyond me.\n\nSo what else?  Uhm, its a good place for a date...although I must say there seems to be so many complete hotties here at any given time, that some unfortunate glances my inevitably happen....so be warned fellas.  I suggest you wear sunglasses.\nUhm, the bathrooms were clean each time I went.  Although this last time there was a big line....with food this rich, that is to be expected.  \nAtmosphere is enjoyable.  Some people may think its a little uppity, but coming from a guy who wears jeans and a t-shirt most days, I'd have to say its ok.  A lot of the teen crowd and early 20s, but its not an obnoxious atmosphere at all.  Its a family place.\n\nSo...yeah.

I loved this place when I was like 8 years old and they were only located in california. Now, it is just a strange experience. It's strange because people line up to come here and wait an hour sometimes.... for what? The food is mediocre at best and it's incredibly overpriced. Anyway, my brother had given me a gift card to this restaurant for chrisanuka. So I finally got around to using it last night. I was in class until 8 and needed to go someplace that was open late (and since we had the gift card, this was the place). The first thing I really hate about this restaurant is the menu size. It is totally unnecessary and every time I go here I just sit and stare at the menu for ever before figuring out what I want. And it's not because it is all too good, It is trying to figure what type of food do I want, what isn't going to be incredibly ridiculously unhealthy, and what isn't 15$ because that is just too much to be spending on a mediocre meal in a chain restaurant. I could go to a pretty good local restaurant and pay the same. Also, with such a big menu I wonder how much of it could possibly be fresh... everything on their menu can't be ordered everyday...? I don't know. So last night I finally decided on the Saigon chicken sandwich with a side salad and the BF got the club. Both were fine, at least with the sandwiches the portion size isn't quite so crazy. \n\nKind of on a side note, our waitress last night was really strange. I think she was putting on an accent and she kept including herself in her questions ie Would we like some pepper on our salad? (um I don't know, would you, creepy waitress lady?) Also, I don't know if the restaurant changed, or what, but she spouted off a 5 minute speech when we got there about the menu (and on page 5 you will find this item, and on page 7, this item).... that was really strange. I have the menu right in front of me.... it is large, so maybe I need direction around it, but generally I can read.\n\nSo anyway, for two sandwiches, no drinks, we paid 27$. That is insane. But we had the gift card, so it turned out alright.... but seriously... why do people eat here? I do not understand it!

And I wait and i wait, and finally 5 minutes later Megan and I got ours.  So we finally begin to eat.  The food was just okay, didn't really taste like much of anything.  Megan said her cheeseburger was ok.  Megan and I also both got a margarita, and for  $8.00 you get about 6 ounces of drink, and that's frozen margaritas, not on the rocks.  Glasses are TINY and the drink was not anywhere near good.   Certainly not worth $8.00.  Restaurant is so noisy you have to  yell across the table to hear anyone, and at night they dim the lights so low you have to really focus on the menu or you can't read it.

I placed an order for a cheesecake for someone's birthday at work several days in advance.  I told them my name, my order, and specifically requested that the cake be ready by 11:30 A.M. on the pick up date.  When I came at 11:30 to pick up my cake, they did not have my name on any order, and they did not have any whole cakes defrosted.  The cashier took my order right there and gave me the requested cake, but then proceeded to ask me \"Are you going to eat this cake right now?\"  Telling her that our party was at noon, she proceeded to tell me \"You are going to have to wait 1.5 hours for the cake to defrost.\"  What??  She did add in a quick \"Sorry\" but in that \"Sorry, but deal with it\" tone.  Due to this location's poor planning and bad customer service, we were unable to have the cake for the lunch party.  Since we were at work, we could not wait 1.5 hours for it to defrost since we only had a small block of time to serve it and eat.

I have an unhealthy obsession with the Cheesecake Factory. Yes yes, this is a chain, I know. But honestly, I don't give a flying f*** if its a chain or an independent restaurant owned by some cute little family down the road. As long as the food is delicious and plentiful, the service fast and friendly, the cost is palatable,  and the atmosphere clean and pleasant, I will be a fan of any place. After all, isn't that what writing reviews and being a foodie is about?\nI come to Cheesecake Factory often and I can't think of a time when I had a non pleasant experience. Yes, there have been a couple of waiters that are a bit slower then others and some of the dishes were not as good as others, but I can always say that Cheesecake Fac is a safe bet if you want a nice meal that will fill you up along with decent service. \nIf you have ever been to the Cheesecake Factory, you know about their menu. It is literally a book! They pride themselves in having something for everyone so there are tons of items to choose from. Here are a few of my suggestions of what to order so you don't go wrong: \n\nAppetizers:\n- Sweet corn tamale cakes\n- Fried chicken sliders\n- Avocado Eggrolls\n- Fried Zucinni small plate - Their small plates actually have alot. They are like the size of a normal appetizer that is not on steroids\n- Clam chowder or creamy chicken and artichoke soup - Believe it or not, their clam chowder is the best I have ever had\n\nEntrees:\n- Chicken Costelleta\n- Chicken Chipotle Pasta\n- BBQ Ranch chicken salad\n- Salisbury chopped steak\n- Crispy spicy beef\n- Bang bang chicken and shrimp - Only order this if you like Indian spice flavors\n\nKeep in mind that everything is massive in size so in my opinion, the prices are pretty decent for the amount of food you get. You could share one entree with another person and get an appetizer and be stuffed yet not spend alot. Now I will admit that there were some things I had at the CC Factory that were not that great. The crabcake burger is too greasy and overpowering, and their mac and cheese balls are nothing impressive. But the good far outweigh the bad and there definitely is something for everyone. Heck, if anything, there is always the cheesecake which they have in every flavor imaginable. Try the dutch apple or carrot, these are my favorites!", "business_id": "78IaYCf9ktUep4UhhjXbTg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-01-05", "type": "review"}

Feel that grease coat your mouth and don't think about how many carbs and calories you're consuming.  Just enjoy that pillowy buttery goodness.

I took my family (6 ppl) there for my adult sons birthday. The atosphere was great, the decor was very nice, but the service and the food, not so much.\n\nFirst we had been waiting so long for a table that my family started getting upset that there were families coming after us who were being seated before us and they were just coming in not waiting like we were. It was painfully obvious that the girl running the seating, was very inexperienced and they need someone with more experience. \n\nWe were finally seated after about 45 minutes and were really looking forward to having a positive experience. Well, there is always hope. \n\nFirst the waitress was a bit sloppy and we felt rushed. I use to waitress, you never ever ever rush the people you're waiting on. Then it took about 10 minutes to get our drinks and the only people who recieved water were the people drinking alcohol. There use to be a time that they put in on your table the minute that you sat down.\n\nTo make it short and sweet, the food. Waaaay over priced for what you get. The appetizers were just ok. Nothing to get thrilled over. My daughters fish was over cooked, the hawiian rice that it came with was too sweet, there was nothing balancing it out. My sons huge Black & Blue Burger had this little tiny bit of blue cheese on it. My giant baked patato cost over $8 and the toppings were hardly enough for a mini potato. About 5 minutes after I ordered it, I told the waitress that I had changed my mind and she told me that it was too late. Really too late to change my mind on a baked potato? You have got to be kidding me.  \n\nI spent almost $200 and left disappointed, that should never happen.", "business_id": "IMGW6y8wHQCfr_6k-YXg_A", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-02-26", "type": "review"}

We both ordered top sirloin, but his came with a bleu cheese butter sauce on top. Mine came with no toppings, and the waitress didn't offer steak sauce. Hmm. Since I like my steak well done, one would surmise that I would probably want something to dip it in or pour over it, n'est-ce pas? But no. We waited for her to come back, he asked her for steak sauce and she comes back and puts it on HIS side of the table. You know, the side with the steak that already has a topping. Uhduh? \n\nAlso, I ordered my steak well done and it was perfect, albeit DRY as there was no sauce and I almost choked on it. But he ordered his medium, and it came out with no pink. Huh?\n\nAll in all, a good deal for the dinners which were around $16 each. Good calamari app. Nom nom. The wine I chose was delicious - a blend, they're usually better. The garlic mashed potatoes were yummy too. This is the 2nd time we've dined here since moving to Phoenix and I still give it a thumbs up. The first time I enjoyed the \"Enlightened Thai Chicken Mango Salad\" and highly recommend it if you're into that kind of dish. But if you order steak, be careful to order it less done than you really want it. I probably could've played hockey or maybe football with mine. Good gracious.\n\nNo other snafu's tonight, except that the tables outside were a bit too close and as the large party next to us was being seated, my boyfriend had a bunch of butts in his face. Back that ass up, ladies....actually, WE had to push our table away twice. And later a waiter was trying to carry like a million plates away from a table and of course he dropped them and scared us, giving us a few more grey hairs (thanks a lot).

Sad, but still a damn good deal for $4.\n\nWe ordered the lettuce wraps and egg rolls at $6 each as a HH special price. Funny thing about HH pricing, you sorta expect it to be the same regular menu item at a discount price (which is why you're so \"happy\" to attend). Well, a little investigation lead me to realize that the appetizers on the HH menu are SMALLER than their regular-priced counterparts.  The lettuce wrap on HH comes with 3 individual leaves of lettuce with a miniature sample of the meaty sauce while the menu displays the lettuce wraps as 4-6 leaves surrounded  by multiple bowls of filling. How fishy.\n\nThen the egg rolls appeared. 4 tiny little nubs of fried dough with avocado that tastes like its drowning in mayo. Did I really just pay $6 for this? Is this really a \"deal\".

I'd ask more of a Red Ale, and this was way middle of the road. Also very hoppy, even if it suggests being 'Not too hoppy in order to emphasize the complex malt flavor and fruity aroma'. I do not concur - I think its was too hoppy for a Red Ale. I will have to go hard next time to evaluate their brews.

Her overreaction was completely unnecessary and very embarrassing to my family and me. Undeterred, we did stay even though we were forced to sit outside, not our first choice of seating arrangements. The wait staff was embarrassed by the actions the manager and they did a great job taking care of us. Perhaps a better way for the manager to handle the situation would have been to offer us a doggie bag or some way to conceal our \"contraband\" so we might have enjoyed indoor seating along with the other paying customers. On an up note the food and libations were excellent; the service was fantastic and I can only hope that the manager gets a scholarship to charm school prior to our next visit.", "business_id": "IMGW6y8wHQCfr_6k-YXg_A", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-12-08", "type": "review"}

They will have organic milk, orange juice and greek yogurt for 50% off. Of course it is bound to expire within the next 3/4 days, but really it won't start spoiling until 2/3 days after the exp date. So if you're gonna be using a lot of milk or juice within a few days, check it out because you will save a good amount of money. And a few feet beyond the dairy, they have more discounted items like pasta, pasta sauce and picnic ware. They had this organic pasta sauce which was normally $8 for $2. And it wasn't like this sauce was nearing expiration date or there was a crack in the bottle or a hand was inside, it was just clearance.\n\nOther than that, they had girl scouts selling cookies outside. So that was an added bonus.

After reading several reviews in the paper about Liberty Market, and being fans of Joe's Farm Grill and Real BBQ, we were determined to get in here.  We parked in the back and as we walked along the sidewalk next to Liberty Market we noticed the long line trailing out of Joe's Real BBQ and then noticed the crowd inside Liberty Market.  I was instantly impressed that someone can be so successful in today's shaky market and open restaurant after restaurant with business just booming.\n\nAs we walked in we noticed that there was a line in which you stand to order your food at a counter.  We joined the line and read the menu.  Already having decided on a margherita pizza, we also chose the caprese salad and I knew I wanted a glass of pinot noir.  As we stood, I noticed that there were very few empty tables and I mentioned to my husband that maybe I should snag a table.  I had my eye on one table but as I walked toward it someone else apparently also had their eye on it and sat there first.  I bolted over to the only other empty table that I saw.  I sat for several minutes, watching my husband inch his way up to the counter.  A manager lady came over to me and asked me if I had someone standing in line.  I said yes.  She informed me that they usually like people to all wait in line and then order before sitting at a table.  I looked back at her and thought about the fact that there were no empty tables.  I said okay, but I held on to my table.  So that part was a little stressful.  The couple next to me joked around saying that I wasn't following the rules and may end up getting kicked out of my table.  Thankfully my husband was finally able to order and made his way over to our table.\n\nWe sat close to several other tables which seemd to invite conversation from all sides.  We chatted with all the people around us which was fun.\n\nOur food came and it was delicious!  The pizza was perfectly cruncy and chewy.  The caprese salad was very tasty.  We devoured every last bite.\n\nOn our way out we were lucky to see Joe, the owner, and were able to compliment him on his wonderful restaurant.  I'll definitely be back to try something else!", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-01-24", "type": "review"}

My kids loved the pancakes.  I'm still iffy on other food, I'll have to give it another try, but the breakfast was a much better experience than the dinner.\n\nI guess this is one of Joe's (BBQ/Farm Grill) establishments?  If so, this one misses the mark.  I couldn't disagree more with other reviewers.  Liberty Market had an opportunity to really be something special. \n\nThe Space: is awesome.  Well done inside.  It's comfortable, casual and eclectic.  The story ends there for me.  I went there with my daughter and when I looked at the menu my thought was \"that's it?\"  I felt like it was way overpriced pannini's...that's about it.\n\nI had one of the signature sandwiches and it was \"okay\" -- nothing to write home (or anywhere else) about for sure.  My daughter opted for the Liberty Joe which I felt was canned Manwich.\n\nAgain, they killed it with the environment, but the food needs a lot of help.  I'm not a coffee drinker, but the coffee area did look impressive...a lot of people were there that night just for some coffee and they seemed pleased.\n\nGive me a reason not to go across the street to Joes BBQ...so far you haven't.", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-01-27", "type": "review"}

But imho his real claim to fame is the fact that he was one of the founders of Coffee Plantation--if you can remember as far back as when CP was actually a great place to go.\n\nIf you head into Liberty Market, you'll find an espresso bar with an old-school machine making pretty tasty drinks, including store-made proprietary hot chocolate (which was a hallmark of Coffee Plantation.  Starbucks?  Pah).\n\nMy wife, co-yelping, says the baked goods are better than the food, and since the red velvet cake is part of that category, I'd have to agree.  The red velvet cake is--and I mean this--the best slice of cake I've ever eaten.  And I've had my fair share.  The cream cheese frosting is fucking ridiculous, it's so creamy and cheesy.  If it were chilled the way such a cake should be (I think their bake case needs repair) I'd seriously go buy three cakes and just eat till I died, Seven style.\n\nBut the sandwiches are good too, and the ambience is quaint and charming--as Joe's places always are.  I don't want to wantonly toss my stars out to every half-decent place because let's be honest--not every place is a five-star restaurant.  But this place is pretty damn good and charming, so I'd recommend a visit.\n\nMy wife's yelp: \"I loved the red velvet cake, very cute place, nice atmosphere.\"  She's a lover of brevity (and poorly hung yet redeemingly charismatic men).", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-02-21", "type": "review"}

I grew up in Gilbert and remember when this was a small grocery store. I've been wanting to check this place out since the conversion and I'm so glad I finally stopped by. \n\nIt was perfect. This place just feels like home. Casual, but warm. When we walked in my friend and I were lost and didn't know where to start. Luckily one of the staff quickly handed us menus and told us where to order. \n\nI had a couple of caramel iced lattes and the Liberty Bowl. I loved both. The Liberty Bowl came with 4 big meatballs in marinara sauce and and two slices of toasted bread. It was so hard narrowing down my choice because there were so many delicious looking items on the menu and the baked goods display kept calling my name, but I resisted. Next time I think I'll just give in and have a slice of red velvet or carrot cake, or a cup cake or a slice of zucchini bread or a sticky bun. So much to choose from. I would love to come back here and have a coffee and sit and enjoy the atmosphere at the espresso bar. \n\nLoved all the different themes in the bathroom stalls. You have to check each one out. Joe was there and stopped by each table to see how everyone was doing. We spent so much time here chatting and catching up. It's a great place to come and hang out.

It's been a little too chilly to sit on the patio, but it's tucked away from the road a bit, so I bet you'll find me there come springtime. \n\nI keep coming back for the latte bowl. It's fantastic and stays hot for like an hour. We had a pizza last week which was really good, but yesterday ordered the breakfast quesadilla and although it was humongous (enough for two), it was kinda greasy on the inside. Everything else I have had has been really good though. \n\nI am totally looking forward to the Espresso 101 and 102 classes I keep hearing about.

It ends at 11a on weekdays and 1p on weekends. As an avid breakfast all-day advocate, this disappoints me. Think about extending those hours! LGO did it with great success. \n\nOverall, HUGE fan.
