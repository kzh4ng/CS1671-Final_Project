I've relied on Yelp in over a dozen different cities, never came away with anything less than a positive experience until today. \n\nWe ordered within 5 minutes of sitting down, there couldn't have been more than 20 people in the place, counting the people on the patio.  Took them almost 40 minutes to serve 3 sandwiches and a salad. I tried the fish sandwich, came out fried extra crispy on the ends, if there is such a thing as fish jerky a third of the sandwich would have qualified, it was just ok. I've had better at almost any church that fries fish during Lent. \n\nAll 3 of my dinner companions left partial sandwiches  or salad uneaten. Bread french fries and onion rings were good though. Iced tea was good, though I've never seen a place dispense sweet n low like they were giving away their last rock of crack. Asked for sugar but never saw any, they don't carry any other artificial sweeteners besides the pink stuff.\n\nI may give the place another try in the future for a Reuben or hamburger, assuming today was some aberration possibly due to a cook having a family emergency or something like that.

On my last visit to Pittsburgh I was looking for a nice bar/pub/lounge to grab dinner and watch a Penguins playoff game.  A friend of mine who lived in the area recommended Rocky's.  As I walked in the door I was pleasantly approached by the server and shown a table. It was clean, welcoming and the lounge was busy. It was Friday night and the special was the fish fry.  I ordered the fish and in the meantime I sipped on a draft brew.  The order was delivered to my table in no time.  The fish and sides were tasty and the portion size was large. As I was watching the game and enjoying the heck out of my dinner I noticed a dessert case with a nice selection of cakes.  Well needless to say I got a togo box for what was left of my dinner and ordered a slice of cheesecake.  Another good choice!  At the end of night the Penguins couldn't pull off the win over the Rangers but I definitely have a new \"go to\" when I'm in town.  Another star could be added for a smoke free environment.

I went to D&B last night for a post wedding party - which, side note, is a great idea!\n\nIt was around midnight and the bar wasn't really populated. There were three bartenders and only one was actually making rounds to see if anyone needed anything. The two other bartenders were chatting on the far side of the bar that no one was sitting at. Kind of counter productive if you ask me. \n\nI stood there for about 5 minutes, which for a busy bar is fine but when I am the only one with my card out then, it just seems a little ridiculous. I made eye contact with the one girl twice and gave her a smile and she literally turned away. I finally had to walk to them to get their attention.  I was standing right in front of them smiling and they didn't ask if i need anything. I finally said, \"Are you working?\" and they gave each other a weird look. I felt like i was the crazy one. I asked for a beer/got the beer.\n\nIn between that time, the other bartender brought food over and set it down. She took a fry from the plate (right in front of me) and then served it to someone on the other side of the bar. What the hell! I felt like i was in some grimy bar in out in the sticks - not an established D&B. \n\nI was just really turned off from that experience. \n\nThe good is that D&B provides a different type of entertainment when you want to mix things up. I remember going here with my grandparents when I was a kid and it was the best treat ever! We would eat at the restaurant and then spend hours playing games.

Maybe even decades...is that even possible?  Well, either way, it's been awhile.  So with my gift certificate I took my brother out for a birthday dinner.  \n\nAs I get older, my tolerance for things like crowds and youngsters gets lower and lower.  As a result, I told my brother to be ready by 4pm so we could head to the Waterfront before everyone goes out for date night.  Plus the Pirates were playing at 4:05 so we could enjoy our beers and the game.\n\nWhen we arrived, the bar side was already pretty packed but we were still able to get a table.  Our server was very attentive, friendly and helpful.  Right off the bat we both ordered samplers so we could try all of their beers.  We loved the fact that as she approached our table with a full tray of samples our server said, \"I have to go back for the rest.\"  In all we were served 10 different beers each (in 3 oz glasses, maybe 4 - I can never tell).  I gotta say, Rock Bottom knows their beer.  I liked more than I didn't, and very few were not to my liking.  So the $6.95 10 beer sampler was well worth it.  \n\nDuring our sampling we indulged on some Southwest Egg Rolls.  They were okay, but not quite what I expected.  The spicy ranch was top notch, though.  As we ran out of beer, we each ordered up a Kobe Burger.  They were both cooked exactly to our liking (medium).  And to top off our wonderful evening, the Pirates brought home a win!\n\nMy only complaint, as a beer drinker, is the cost for a growler.  The glass container itself is sold for $12.95.  That's the empty price.  To me, that's a little ridiculous when East End only charges $3 for the bottle and Penn Brewery $5.  Paying more for the bottle than the beer inside seems like insanity to me.  So I walked out empty handed.

I'd checked the website in advance to try and plan my meal since I do my best to pick items on menus that aren't, say, 2,000 calories in one sitting. Their website advertises that they make skinny drinks; when I asked my waiter he said it was possible but that they did not normally do this and that it's a hassle for the people at the bar, so he didn't recommend it. Then why tell us on your website that you'll do it??? \n\nAdditionally, while we had checked in advance when we made our reservation about bringing a birthday cake and the restaurant's ability to handle us lighting candles, apparently there was a break down in communication; we never got the candles we had asked for, and in fact the poor waiter struggled to even find a lighter before realizing there were no candles available. Obviously whatever error occurred wasn't the waiter's fault, and we definitely thanked him and tipped him well for doing the best that he could with what he had.\n \nOn a final note, this is also one of those places where if you ask for a medium rare burger, they will overcook it; I've started ordering medium rare on purpose specifically so that I get a medium cooked burger instead of medium well or well done.\n\nFinal verdict: go for the brews if you must, and the food's nice enough.

I have been by this place many times and was excited to finally make it inside.  We were lucky that we went fairly early as a line developed shortly after we were seated at our table.  The Rusty Nail is prepared for this in a pretty cool way though as they have a list outside of the restaurant that you can sign into as well as some coffee to partake of while you wait.\n\nFor my entree I decided to go with one of the specials for the day which was the Rusty Nail omelet while my girlfriend decided on another special which was the a mushroom, spinach and feta junior omelet.  Her omelet is self explanatory while mine had in it some salami, cheese and three pieces of sliced pepperoni on top of it.  It was readily apparent that the pepperoni was not the cheap kind that you get on most pizzas as it had more flavoring and tasted much better.  Both omelets came with sides of home fries and toast for which we both ordered deli rye.  The junior omelet tasted good as the sourness of the feta played nicely with earthy mushrooms while the spinach made it feel like I was eating healthy.  My omelet was just as good if not better than the junior omelet as the cheese and meats combined to make it seem like I was almost eating a pizza.  Some of my hash browns were slightly overcooked and they had too many onions for my taste but we still decent enough to be a side to the main show.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in the future.

When I asked to speak to the manager, he just shook his head sadly and offered us free desserts.  I told him that I didn't want to eat anything that came out of a kitchen that clearly showed that the people working in it simply didn't care - at all, and we didn't want to eat anything, not even the food sitting in front of us, and just wanted to pay our bill and leave.

It is crystal-clear that the current manager and/or owner isn't doing his job, and I cannot understand how anyone would choose to spend their hard-earned money at this establishment when virtually every other restaurant in town offers far better service and food.  \n\nIn short: no one - not the manager, not the waitresses, not the cooks - cares about the customer.

The manager apologizes again and asks me if I want to take this pathetic piece of beef home with me! Not only is it rare but it's a cheap cut of strip steak that is loaded with connective gristle. I said no thanks. He comped my husband's meal and we left. I never hope for people to lose their jobs but the cook and the server really need some serious retraining!

First off, it is desperately in need of some updates.  There are old crappy projector screens and a few big rear projection TVs, but not an HDTV in sight.  There are TVs aplenty, but they just feel dinghy and outdated and the reception on every TV is snowy.\n\nThe biggest issue, however, is that apparently they're only able to show 6 games at any 1 time throughout the huge bar area.  There are several main bar islands, booths, and pub tables all over with individual TV screens at each booth.  Sounds good, but what good are all these seats if you can only show 6 games?  That is absurd when you consider how huge Sports Rock is, especially during college football.  I went to watch a game that was on regular old ESPN, and they weren't showing the game.

Nachos are no better than what you can get at 7-11 and sandwiches have no flavor.  And service is piss poor and understaffed.  I'm not sure if they recently changed ownership or what, but something was very very off here and they were obviously unprepared for the start of the football season.\n\nI feel bad because the people were very nice and apologetic, but that does not take away from the fact that even if they were showing my game, I think I'd still rather watch it in my hotel room.", "business_id": "HDTv_rnmSL8AQ04_zTWARA", "stars": 1, "date": "2008-08-31", "type": "review"}

In the three years that I've been going there I don't think that they've ever let my coffee cup go empty. \n\nBreakfast is excellent, no matter what time of day you have it. I especially love their homefries, which are nice and crispy but not overdone. This may seem like a minor thing, but you'd be surprised how many restaurants can mess up a fried potato. If you're coming in for lunch I would strongly suggest one of their salads; the lettuce is fresh and crisp and so are the toppings. If you get a steak salad, the steak comes right off of the grill and onto your plate, along with the fries. The soups are also delicious, although the Greek Lemon Soup is a bit sweet. I love their Navy Bean and Beef Barley soups, can't get enough of them. For lunch or dinner they have good comfort food: meatloaf with mushroom gravy, pork chops and kraut, stuffed cabbage, etc. Some days they make a homemade Greek pastitsio (did I spell that right?), which I think is even better than what is served at the Greek Food Festival in Oakland. \n\nOne last thing that I'd like to say is that they know how to make eggs over-easy. I like my fried eggs very runny or dippy or however you say it, and Ritter's makes them just so. A lot of breakfast places that I've been to tend to give you over-medium when you ask for over-easy.

The bacon is amazing, the blue cheese melts to the bun within a coulple of minutes and the burger mean is so fresh that you can distinctly taste its freshness.\n\nThe ambiance of the place is really nice too. It is an older place which has kept that old Bloomfield feel still to this day. Everyone is extremely nice there. The owner is usually there at the door to greet you and is always willing to have a nice conversation with you in the time when she is not flying around trying to get people in their seats. \n\nThe only downfall with Tessaro's and this is not their fault is that they are alway's almost too busy.

What you find instead is a decent, run of the mill, average burger. The meat is pretty good and certainly juicy but rather lacking in seasoning and the toppings don't do much for the overall experience. I've had burgers that are 4 or 5 star burgers, just not here.\n\nI was famished the last time I ate at Tessaro's and so was my husband. I'd just spent the entire day at Shadyside Hospital having a minor procedure and hadn't been able to eat since the night before. We didn't get to Tessaro's until 3pm and both of us would have literally eaten anything at that point. While I spent the day waiting, I'd read one of those infamous Best Burger in the Burgh lists online and had been daydreaming about a big juicy burger literally for hours & Tessaro's was right down the street.\n\nThe bacon bleu cheese burger was on special that day so we both jumped. Peculiar that they offer the bleu cheese wet or dry. Guessing the wet is bleu cheese dressing and I like my bleu cheese straight up, so easy decision. Side of coleslaw for me, fries for hubby. \n\nWe both remarked that we expected it to taste better than it did. The bleu cheese had no flavor, the bacon was barely noticeable and I had to add ketchup to it to get anything going on. At one point, I even put coleslaw on it to try and wake it up. \n\nAs mentioned, the meat itself was good but I'm sorry even the best burger needs seasoning and flavorful toppings. If the bacon and bleu cheese had been 1st rate, this would have been a completely different rating and experience.", "business_id": "vgXE1I7c9ElcfYyZfQiN1Q", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-06-26", "type": "review"}

We were completely satisfied with our meal. It had to be the largest burger i've ever had. I took a picture of it as plated but should have assembled my burger for a pic to show the true size. Next time!\n\nOur server was Briana and she was a great server!

All that changed when my boyfriend and I decided to check it out for Sunday dinner one evening. We were very hungry and seeking a nice little neighborhood pub sort of place near our new house. I'm happy to say Silky's ended up being just what we were hoping to find!\n\nIt was dark and sort of cozy-feeling inside when we walked in. I liked how chill the vibe was. We immediately seated ourselves at a table to wait for the server. This might be a random observation, but I really appreciated the size of the tables for two. They could have probably fit four people but with only two seats it felt like there was actually enough room for plates and drinks and such. One of my biggest annoyances with eating at bars is getting an extraordinarily small, wobbly table. Our waitress came over pretty quickly and provided us with the draft list and specials for the night. The beer choices weren't amazing but certainly adequate for a neighborhood place. I ended up ordering the California chicken wrap with regular fries, and my boyfriend got chicken fingers with waffle fries. I absolutely loved my wrap and fully intend to order it again! It had guacamole, (an all too rare thing to find in wraps or sandwiches in Pittsburgh) bacon, general chunks of grilled chicken, and tomatoes. Those are four of my favorite foods, so I was very pleased with my choice. I eat my wraps with a knife and fork so I had no trouble with the messiness factor, but the wrap was quite large and I had leftovers for the following day. I enjoyed my boyfriend's waffle fries a little more than my plain ones however, so I'll probably get those next time. He said his chicken fingers were great.

We each ordered a beer and were promptly served. After taking a moment to glance over the menu, we decided on the pita pizza app, the special (beer battered fish/Mac and cheese) and the fish tacos. \nThe pita pizza: a soft pita shell with pesto, tomatoes, chicken and cheese. BORING. \nThis appetizer reminded me of my mother's Irish cooking: tasteless. A simple addition of caramelized onions would have solved this problem. \nEntree 1: Beer battered fish and Mac and cheese. Ruling: BLAND. My husband ordered this one and described the fish as \"wet\" and the Mac and cheese as \"play-doh\". They also served the dish with lettuce, tomato and onion, as if it were a sandwich. \nEntree 2: Fish tacos. Ruling: OVERCOOKED/COVER-UP ATTEMPTED. Ok, so they weren't bad, but the fish was dry. Covered with tomatoes and a bit of lettuce, the tacos were, again, on the tasteless side. The attempt at adding flavor came with the chipotle mayo and sour cream. \nThese only helped to moisten the fish. The corn relish was masked by jalape\u00f1o peppers and the rice came shaped as if out of a small flowerpot.\nThe service was quite friendly, so, no fault there.

Yes, it's in Shadyside, which I usually avoid at all costs, but I never have a problem making an exception for this spot.\n\nI don't think I've ever had something on the menu that I didn't fall in love with.  My husband and I are huge fans of the 'goat in a boat' (cheese and pepper dip served with yummy hot pita triangles), but there's nothing more satisfying after a few rounds of drinks than their baby burghers and horseradish mashed potatoes.\n\nSpeaking of drinks, they have one of the most extensive mixed drink lists in the city.  If you find conversation with your dinner mates a bit dull, you can just page through the 'Grill Swill' menu for a few good laughs, and even some conversation starters.  I love the 'Surly Temple,' and my husband prides himself on sampling each and every type of Manhattan they offer.  Harris Grill is home to some of the best bartenders in the city (and also one of the hottest ;).\n\nTuesday night at the Grill is Bacon Night, which means you can get unlimited (until they run out) bacon.  It's free in a basket at the bar, or $1 per basket at your table.  And if that's not enough bacon for you, they've even got bacon-tinis.  Yep, bacon, in booze form.  It's every Yinzer's dream.\n\nTheir other booze specialty is the frozen cosmo, which is like a Slushee version of the original.  It's good, but as a girl who can't even do frozen margaritas, I seem to get a brain freeze every time I try one, and usually wind up sticking to the classic version, which is always perfectly mixed.\n\nLately, I've been getting their chicken salads there, Pittsburgh style, with crispy fries on top.  There is something about their ranch dressing there that is just amazing.  See previous comment, re: everything here tastes like heaven.\n\nIn nice weather, you can sit on their patio and put in some serious people-watching.  It gets crowded on the weekends, but all the more opportunity!  There are a lot of stairs at this place, and let me just say: drunk people trying not to fall down stairs... well, they're funny.  :) \n\nAnd the best part about Harris Grill?

Is it still wonderful to see one pop up on a menu? Oh yes.\n\nService has always been very efficient and polite, no complaints or rude servers. Atmosphere is nice but a little too dark and loud for my tastes. Patio usually fills up, but if you set up near the big windows, it's almost the same thing but with AC.\n\nAnd they're open late (1:30) which is a huge plus for Pittsburgh.

I've been here twice.  Once in 2009 and again in 2011 and the food and booze always makes me happy! \n\nBoth of my visits were for the Pittsburgh Bacon Bash and of course I ate tons of bacon things, but I also grabbed a few items from the amazing menu of humorously-named entrees and appetizers.  My favorite app was the bacon chicken wings which were lightly battered and bathed in BaconSalt and then topped with crumbled bacon awesomeness.  With a big bacon bloody mary, it's the perfect meal! \n\nI also had The Central Park, The Old Fashioned, Hog Heaven, the Bacontini, a few cosmos of greatness and a lot of great local beer!  For such a small place the beer options are great.\n\nWhile the prices were a bit high ($12+ for some of the drinks) compared to anything near me, the quality and quantity both make it worth the bucks!  \n\nI also played \"What's Up, Pussycat\" on the jukebox 10 times in a row and made a lot of people laugh hysterically!", "business_id": "rgmptwPbBH1wLpiBHcbIhA", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-06-29", "type": "review"}

If you go, see if you can sit in Justin's section.  \n\nThe Harris is one of the few bars in Pittsburgh open late night if you're looking for food.  While most area kitchens close at 11, the Harris is open and serving until 1 am--full menu!\n\nTuesday is Bacon Night and if you go for happy hour get there early, or be prepared to wait.  Bacon and beer are fantastic together until you have that moment where you realized, \"I've just had 15 pieces of bacon.\"  Order another beer, you'll feel better about yourself.\n\nPeople rave about the frozen cosmos and they're ok but not really my thing.  Try the drink with the muddled cucumbers--it is fantastic.  \n\nThey also have a good Sunday brunch.  In the summer months its a buffet which I dont like as much as the regular, menu style brunch they have in colder months.  Bloody Mary's are half off after 2pm, so I often like to work out in the morning and then spend the afternoon having a \"Sunday Funday.\"\n\nThe food at the Harris is generally good, but they change their menu a lot and while that can be a good thing I've found it frustrating as several of my favorite menu items ie Shawshank Redemption and the Crawful of Falaffel are no longer offered.  The food is somewhat consistent, although sometimes it is over seasoned.  I ordered the meatloaf once and it had so much rosemary in it I found it almost inedible--although my boyfriend tried it and loved it.  The DelMonico A Go Go is so fatty I don't recommend it.  It's a good sandwich, but it owuld be better if they made it with different/better meat.  Several times I've gone to order a menu item and they're out of it.  The staff is usually pretty good about letting you know what's off the menu ahead of time but sometimes you want to ask.\n\nWhat the Harris does well they do fantastic.  The Lasagna, the burgers, the greek salad, the gazpacho, the fish tacos, the steak, the hummus-- all excellent.  Try the gazpacho, it's excellent!\n\nThe staff is fantastic.  I think the Harris has the best bartenders in town.  If you get to know them, they'll take fantastic care of you.  Even if htey don't know you, you can expect to get your drinks quickly, and your cocktails mixed correctly.\n\nThis place can get expensive.  If you're drinking craft beers be careful bc your bill can creep up on you quickly.  It is, in my opinion, priced right for what you are getting.\n\nThis is my favorite bar in Pittsburgh and I hope you check it out if you havne't yet.

If the weather doesn't permit and I still want that solace, they also have a lounge with a fireplace directly above the bar. It really does have a place for any sort of mood.\n\nThe food is decent. Their menus do change quite frequently though, so it's best not to get *too* attached to a certain dish. One aspect that I love is how they name and describe their food. There's so much thought and effort put into each item as they come up with the most interesting of names and elaborate stories to introduce them to their guests.\n\nTheir drinks are very good. They have a small little book dedicated to the cocktails and other alcoholic beverages they offer. It's always an adventure, choosing a drink as they offer a wide range of quirky mixes and cocktails. My personal favorite would be the Happy Ending, which is a cucumber-mint based cocktail that entails the magic of vodka and a few other liquors. It's perfect for refreshing the palate between dishes. \n\nSadly, Harris Grill is a bit on the pricey side and the service is a tad inconsistent.

The Benedict and the chicken and waffles were really basic - literally plain chicken fingers (great stand alone option if you brings kids I guess) and plain waffles. \n\nFor the price though you can't beat it and both of the free drink options were good. There is a nice bricked patio out front. And our waitress was really nice. She kept checking on us, she was super friendly, and when she accidentally dropped a knife near one of us when she was clearing a table she gave him a free drink. Proactive and full of smiles. \n\nA neat place to keep in mind if you are in the neighborhood.

Although I've definitely experience better dining atmospheres, if you get a chance to sit in their small outdoor seating it's worth it.  It has a bit of that \"Cheers\" kind of charm but to me is a bit small.  The inside is dark and if you go in the winter time gets very crowded.  I would advise trying out Cappy's in the early fall or summer months.  Sitting outside on Walnust St. is probably one of my favorite things to do.  If you are with friends push some tables together and get to people watching.  If you are alone, no worries.  Read a book or the paper, or simply relax.  The people eating here are usually a bit older.  Sometimes they will have their kids with them during lunch time.  Most college kids frequent the sub shops, coffee places, and larger bars on Walnut.  The staff is always very nice and fairly prompt. \n\nFood:\nThe food is pretty good.  I have eaten several of their salads and have always enjoyed them.  They are quite large so get ready to take a to-go box home or share some of yours with a friend.  The sandwiches are great in my opinion.  I've never tried one that I didn't enjoy.  My sister is a vegetarian, so if this is your case don't worry, there are lots of options for those who don't enjoy a big burger or chicken sandwich.  \n\nPrices:\nThe prices are fairly cheap for being in Squirrell Hill.  I would advise anyone to eat there because I don't think the prices are out of the park at all.  Very affordable and the portions are quite large so it is well worth your dollars spent. :)", "business_id": "DkX3YoxhH4uADsgVgQThew", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-06-15", "type": "review"}

Not far down the street, you can get a tiny morsel of ice cream for a stroke-inducing four dollars, but at Cappy's, you can spend a reasonable price on a reasonable meal.  \n\nSo far, food-wise, I've tried the Alamo sandwich (I think that's what it's called,) and the bacon-and-bleu-cheese burger (Big Bleu?)  Both of them were definitely satisfying, and the Alamo, with its fried chicken strips and barbecue sauce, was at the very least pretty good, even if it took a few years off the end of my life.\n\nGetting outdoor seating is key, though.  They air-condition the bejeezus out of the inside area, and one time we accidentally showed up on karaoke night, which made us REALLY glad we found a table outside.  Karaoke night is great when you're expecting it, but when you're not, there are few fates worse.\n\nService is usually kind of slow as well, but the wait staff is nice.  One waitress we had was a little thick, though, when it came to splitting our checks.  Nobody paid what they actually owed that night, but we didn't want to fight it out with her.\n\nAll in all, Cappy's is a nice, unpretentious little place to grab some food.

However, Calabria's is vey good for what it is- casual italian foods. I would say it's closer to Armstrong's or Little Oasis. I stopped here for dinner with a friend at 8pm on a Saturday night. We asked to sit outside but were informed that the patio was \"rented\" out for the night for a party. When I walked into the dining room, I was immediately frightened and seriously considered going elsewhere. It looked like they clean with pepto bismal. Everything is a very ugly pink color. Tables, booths, chairs, decorations- pepto bismal pink. We were also the youngest patrons by about 20 years. Stomaches growling, we decided to stay and were very glad we did.\nI ordered the grilled chicken with a side of pasta with vodka sauce. The entrees also came with a salad or soup. I chose the salad with cheesy garlic dressing. Yes, the dressing is called cheesy garlic. It was a creamy, cheesy italian dressing. Delicious. I can definitely see using this dressing as a sauce for subs and chicken. The salads were also served with italian bread with a oil, balsamic and spices dip. Perfect compliment to my meal. Our entrees arrived quickly. I was very pleased with my choice. The chicken was juicy and tender with good flavors. The penne with vodka sauce was delicious. A wonderful combination of tomatoes and cream. When I asked for parmesan cheese, I was directed to the bottle of shaker cheese on the table. Not quite what I was looking for. Our waitress quickly brought me a small cup of grated cheese. Throughout the night the service was exceptional. Now, that might have to do with the fact that there were only 2 other tables at that time but regardless, it was great. I decided to save a piece of chicken for lunch the next day and get dessert. We were looking for chocolate cake but the closest thing we found was a chocolate brownie ala mode. Other than the decor, dessert was the reason Calabria's got 4 stars instead of 5.

This past week my wife and I dined there for dinner. Service was prompt and professional, even though the server was fairly new in her position. The atmosphere is nothing special and the acoustics bad (there was a party of 10 towards the back of the restaurant that sounded like a party of 20). The menu is pretty broad, but weighted heavily toward pasta and Italian.\n\nWe both ordered the chicken pastina soup. The broth was just OK. There were a few small meatballs and absolutely no chicken in either of our soups. It was laughable. \n\nMy wife ordered the pepperoni chicken and I the chicken saltimboca. Both chickens were tender. The sauce (gravey, to those who prefer the old world Italian term) for my entree was great and I very much enjoyed my entree. \n\nThe marinara sauce on the pepperoni chicken is average, at best. This recipe has not changed over the years and it is bland and somewhat tasteless. \n\nAt $17 per entree (with only one side, and a soup or salad) a patron should reasonably expect better quality.", "business_id": "Ln34kwDUNZPLhVhUqauLWQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-07-30", "type": "review"}

I then had the pepperoni chicken.  Although the chicken was tender, hot, cooked well and had a fair amount of pepperoni on top, the enormous amount of rather bland sauce made it not very tasty.   Disappointing.   The veal saltimboca my husband had was very different than any I had ever seen, but he enjoyed it, although would have liked more ham.\n\nMy mother, who was with us and needed gluten free food was accommodated very well by the chef, who served her chicken Romano and a baked potato, which she enjoyed.\n\nAtmosphere is nothing special and with a large party there, it became loud.

My wife and I went on a Thursday night. The place was less than half full, yet the hostess had us wait between 5-10 minutes for them to clean a table before seating us. Seems kind of asinine when there are plenty of empty seats throughout the restaurant. I understand that due to staffing they may have wanted to sit us in a particular server's section, but I believe customer service is all about perception. Our waitress did not seem very enthusiastic.\n\nThe food was a mixed bag. My wife enjoyed her LongHorn Salmon, but my Renegade Top Sirloin was ruined by being served completely drenched in oil. I've eaten at Longhorn in Maine a couple of times, and don't remember their steaks being served this way. If this is normal here, then I much prefer the steaks at Texas Roadhouse for this price range. My lobster tail was good, and not overcooked. For dessert, my wife and I shared a Caramel Apple Goldrush. This was most excellent, and almost warranted an extra star.\n\nThe main reason for the one star is what happened after our visit. I had left a $10 cash tip, and filled out the credit card slip to reflect this. A few days later, when the charge showed up on my credit card statement, I found that an additional $10 had been added. I immediately went back to the restaurant and spoke very cordially with a manager, showing him the receipt for my visit and my credit card statement. Everyone makes mistakes, but it's how a business handles a customer after a mistake is made that sets the tone for future business. The first thing he did, after researching the error in the back, is offer a $10 coupon. That is not acceptable to me, because to take advantage of this, I'd have to eat here again. He asked me what he should do (isn't HE the manager?), and I suggested that he credit the overcharge back to my card, or void/refund the full amount, and recharge it. I was told that I'd have to fill out a form that would have to be faxed to corporate, then I'd have to wait an unknown number of days to see the amount credited back to my card. I understand that there may be corporate policies that he has to follow, but there seemed to be very little compassion or empathy on his part. He should have still offered the coupon or maybe a comp'd entr\u00e9e for the trouble of driving all the way back to the store because of a pretty significant error one of their employees made. No such luck. I would not have necessarily accepted the offer, but the gesture would definitely be appreciated and goes a long way towards a customers' perceptions about how important they are to a business. I do have a background in customer service management, and this would have never flown under my watch.\n\nMy wife and I have never been disappointed at Texas Roadhouse in Matthews, where the staff has always been enthusiastic and the food is exactly what we expect at this style of restaurant. I guess we'll stick with that when we're in the mood for a slab of beef and all the fixin's.", "business_id": "AUDuCSWYzzRP3H2w7TxtuQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-06-23", "type": "review"}

Great question!  Well...my husband absolutely loves it so I try my best to do the good wifey thing and indulge him every now and again.  :-)   \n\nThis one time, I am actually glad that he didn't give into my protest and he convinced me to go. Our meal was (surprisingly) outstanding!! Not that I ever thought that the food was \"bad\", but it was just \"meh\" for me (and I hate to pay for \"meh\"!).  However, this meal was anything, but \"meh\". This week we decided to try the \"Porterhouse for 2\" and it knocked my socks off!  It was a great piece of meat, seasoned perfectly, cooked properly (medium rare), and seriously delicious. It came with 2 salads (the reason for only 4 stars for this visit...I will get to that later), 2 sides (we had Asparagus and Broccoli), a bulb of roasted garlic (oh, heck yes!!!) and a small bowl of Sizzling Brown Magic known as \"LongHorn Steak Sauce\". Let me preface this by saying that my husband and I are purists when it comes to steak...we don't over season or typically add any sauces (although we do love a good chimichurri). We like to let the meat speak for itself.  But, SWEET BABY JESUS....their steak sauce was awesome! They prepare it tableside and it's served hot. Let me repeat...ITS SERVED HOT! Who woulda thought?!?  If I wasn't afraid of scorching my tongue, I would have liked the bowl clean...it was THAT good!.  \n\nOne taste of the steak with a slice of garlic and a dab of sauce and the angels began to sing. My husband was so happy (and surprised) to see that I was loving it that he was gitty. He even explained our situation to our server and I could hear him getting choked up (not really, but you get my point) when he uttered the words \"she wants to come back\". (You're welcome, honey!) \n\nSo...if it was so darn good...then why the 4 stars (instead of 5)?  3 words...Warm.Salad.Plates.  Seriously, people...cold foods need to be served on cold plates. Even if the plates aren't completely chilled...for the love of all this is right in the world...don't use warm plates for salad!  The server apologized and said that they were training a new salad person and that she used the wrong plates. I get it, but I wanted to ask why she (the server) didn't notice when she picked them up?  hmmm, oh well...I guess going from the typical \"meh\" to absolute perfection was expecting a lot. It was a blip on the radar compared to the rest of the meal, so I've moved on.\n\nWill I go back...YES, but I will only ever order that same meal again. Hopefully, it will be just a good.

About halfway through eating, she brought us the check, never inquiring if we would want dessert. When she came back 5-10 minutes later, we had long since finished eating and asked for 2 boxes. She brought the boxes and my 6 year old had decided to take her leftovers home as well, so we asked for a third, only for her to promptly roll her eyes at the table and walk away without acknowledging our request verbally. When she came back, a member of my party outstretched her hand to take the box and begin packaging the leftovers, when Chrystal looked right at her and put the box on the end of the table, just out of her reach. After the check was paid and we stood up to leave, I witnessed Chrystal do a celebratory dance that we were leaving. Very visible and inappropriate.

I don't know if the server (or chef) had somewhere to be but she was going a mile a minute. I wanted to relax and enjoy my meal not be rushed in and out in less than 45minutes.

I'll go with atmosphere, which was the good part. Cool sports bar, pool tables and ample flat screens. Now for the not so good. Our bartender was a disaster- I rarely will ever say that, I used to be one myself and understand that sometimes you can get overwhelmed, or whatever other benefit of the doubt I normally give. But this was pretty bad. We sat at the bar with only a handful of other people, so it's not even like it was busy. We told her were were going to eat and needed menus. My finacee asked for a Sunset Wheat beer, which was on tap. We weren't paying attention to her as she poured, but once he sipped the beer he immediately knew it was a Sam Adams. OK, mistake. But when we looked over at the taps, the two were no where near each other. We flagged here down when she returned to the bar (she kept disappearing) and she apologized, went to pour the correct beer and only got a half a glass out of it. Just a minute, she promised. \n\nLiterally, like 15 minutes later, she finally came back but then ran off again before we could tell her we were ready to put in our food order. We were starving! We finally flagged here down and placed the order. Good thing we ordered when we did, because the food took forever to come out!! By the time we got it we were SO hungry. I ordered the Mahi Mahi over rice, and I wouldn't have finished it if I wasn't starving - the Mahi was really dry, and they added so much spice to the dish that whatever flavor was there was killed. Granted, it is a sports bar, but I've worked in Sports bars before that served amazing fish dishes. If it's not going to be good, it shouldn't be on the menu. After flagging the bartender down (again), we finally got our bill and decided that we definitely would not be back to eat, but maybe just for drinks.", "business_id": "-6JY1T0w4XETux5kGOj84g", "stars": 2, "date": "2008-08-04", "type": "review"}

That could also be Rock Bottom Brewery sits across the street and makes this place seem so much smaller. My visit was at 2pm and we experienced some difficulty with parking. It also is DNC week and parking is off limits except for a few places along the street. Luckily we found one after circling 4 times. We walked in and it was awkward. One of those moments that you see in movies where a bar is noisy everyone stops and stares then goes about their business. Normally this isn't an issue but when the waitress and bartender does this its....awkward. We found a booth and sat and waited to be greeted. We waited, looked around and waited some more. Began looking around saw a bartender and that was it. No waitress no one else walking around. Wasn't sure if we should have sat at the bar to be noticed, or like in elementary school raise our hands to have permission to speak. It would have probably made a difference to recieve a smile or simple hello from the person behind the bar, then we probably wouldn't have felt forgotten. After 14 minutes we finally met our waitress who asked us if we needed more time to review the menu. Really? We counted 3 parties, thats it...in a otherwise bare restaurant. Food was good, received it pretty quickly. Our drinks were refilled often without being asked. First impressions really do matter. It wouldn't have mattered from that point if service was perfect. Don't ignore someone intentionally when they obviously know you can see them. From reading other reviews it seems that we aren't the only ones who experienced the same issues. Really felt like we were being intentionally ignored. We did something we  have never done. Intentionally left without leaving a tip.

We didn't see him again until after our food was brought to us. We only saw him twice after he checked to see if we had our food, and one of those two times was to hand us the check. The food was so-so.  My son had a hamburger which was delicious - my chicken bruschetta was fair but cold and the broccoli had no butter, seasoning, nothing.  It was over priced for what the meal consisted of. I gave two stars because  I was disappointed mainly with the service more so than the food. I've never had bad service or a bad meal at the Rock Bottoms I've been to in the past so was expecting the same high standards that I'm used to.  Might try again, but it will be a while.", "business_id": "ym9QwkmB5ZKTyj7q5huTDw", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-07-06", "type": "review"}

The Bartends are freaking awesome and very cute(always a plus at a bar). They are super friendly and makes the best drinks in the world.  \n\nFood is awesome.

My friends' dinners looked really good as well- I had a bite of the bacon, chicken mac and cheese and the country fried chicken. Excellent food all around. \n\nThe problem with this place was our waitress in particular. Korin. She started off really sweet and cool.... And then went B*TCH on our table of 6. A bunch of rude comments and all and all unpleasant experience. My friend had ordered the house root beer before and when she took a sip this time, the root beer was flat and watered down. When the waitress was told, she immediately got defensive and said \"it's our house root beer\" so excuse me, it is supposed to be watered down and flat? My friend then said she had the root beer before and it tasted different. The waitress decided to blame the soda machine and check and get her another. \n\nHer second mistake was when she came over to take our orders and said she would start with ladies first, the first lady she was talking about was chatting and the waitress said, \"um, can someone tap her...\"\n\nThe last and final mistake was that she mixed up all of checks or credit cards, I don't know what happened because when our cards were returned to us, we all had been charged the wrong bills! She didn't seem to know what to do, except suggest to run the cards again. But BLAMED US for the mix up and that we put our cards in the wrong bill. No!

Plus they didn't have the correct vodka for a drink listed on their drink list and they charged us for the more expensive substitute! Hands down, NOT WORTH YOUR TIME OR MONEY!! Slow service (even though we were the ONLY customers in place). And let us not forget the worst restrooms ever. For a place with NO customers other than ourselves, the handicap stall was disgusting. Toilet clogged, the sinks haven't seen cleanser in quite some time. Don't waste your time or money!", "business_id": "t5l-H2KdY4MQgLDMENz9WQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-08-05", "type": "review"}

The fact that their pancakes and their omelets are above-average sized doesn't make them great. In fact, I'd declare they're pretty mediocre, and I've eaten here several times.\n\nThere are quite a few things about OPH that irk me to no end, especially at the South Park location.\n\n1. Regarding their pancakes: yes, they're good pancakes. Best pancakes ever? Hardly. Don't get me wrong: if all I had to eat there was a stack of pancakes, I'd be satisfied. But when you hear friends and colleagues rave about OPH's pancakes, you're expecting to have your dirty, hole-filled socks knocked off. \n\nNot so much here. \n\n2. Their omelets are obnoxious-sized. Seriously. They look as if the line cook tried to shove an entire turkey inside a egg wrap. \n\nLook, I get that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. That doesn't mean I want an omelet the size of the Hindenburg. I'm not going to finish it. Hell, I may not even last 3 bites. I'm not fond of places that tend to overdo it when it comes to certain plates. \n\n3. In the 5 or 6 times I've eaten here, I've never been waited on by someone who didn't have a shitty attitude. Ask for extra syrup or butter, and they look at you as if you just asked if you could perform all kinds of illegal and immoral sexual acts upon their mother. Considering this is the Bible Belt, some of those acts would seem immoral here, but where I come from, that pretty much constitutes \"going to first base.\" But I digress...\n\nIn addition to shitty service is the lack of service to begin with. You get seated, and maybe, just maybe, your waiter/waitress will take a few minutes from bitching about how much they hate working here - and mind you, I worked my way through college as a waiter, so I sympathize with having to work a crowded restaurant - and maybe they'll realize your coffee's running low and pour you some. Or maybe they'll realize you don't have silverware...while your meal's on the table. You can't eat pancakes with your hand. I mean, you could, but that's barbaric.\n\n4. Speaking of coffee, their coffee is BRUTAL. A warm cup of water with a pathetic sprinkling of coffee grounds is NOT COFFEE. Then I realized they serve Royal Cup Coffee. This is the kind of coffee you serve to people you hate. Apparently, the management at OPH hates their customers.\n\n5. Speaking of customers, something about OPH seems to bring out the shitty in some customers. Apparently there's an addictive formula in their pancakes that makes some customers act stupid, although I seem to be immune. Every time I've gone to OPH, I've been seated next to patrons who speak too damned loud and want to share every excruciating detail of their lives, or behave towards their meal as if they'd just escaped from a chain gang and haven't eaten a meal in weeks. \n\nI know I pointed out the crap service, but nothing gets me as angry as a customer that treats a waitress like shit. Dressing down a waitress because she forgot to bring you your egg whites is uncalled for. And the behavior some patrons demonstrate here is a big reason why I won't return to ANY OPH, wherever, whenever. The joint seems to bring out a giant stack of stupid in people.\n\nThere are better places in town for breakfast. \n\nThe thing is, the existence of an establishment like OPH proves the incestuous relationship that takes place between \"well-established\" restaurants that are merely coasting by based upon past glories and name recognition, and a general public either too ignorant to know better, or one that simply doesn't care.", "business_id": "UzMMpUFwJhwUkHOyeXeWsQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-08-27", "type": "review"}

On any given Sunday the restaurant is packed with people and the wait is over an hour, but it is totally worth the wait. I have never had a bad experience at The Original Pancake House and I've tried many different dishes over the years. \n\nPerhaps my favorite dish at The Original Pancake House is their chocolate chip pancakes. Now I love a good chocolate chip pancake and it's very hard to get them done just right. Most of the places I've been to may put a few chips inside the pancake, but the majority of the chips are scattered on top of the pancakes. However, at The Original Pancake House they put tons of chocolate chips both inside the pancakes and on top of the whipped cream that's on the pancakes. This makes for a great combination of perfectly melted chocolate chips and hard chocolate chips on top that melt in your mouth.\n\nAlso another favorite of mine is the ham and cheese omelet. The omelet's at The Original Pancake House are absolutely huge and I don't think I've ever actually finished a whole omelet in one sitting. Not only are these omelets big, but they are also stuffed with whatever toppings you want, so you will not be disappointed with your meal. \n\nThe only reason I gave this restaurant a 4-star rating is because of the wait time and the noise level inside the restaurant (sometimes it gets pretty loud), but if I were basing my rating solely on the quality of the food then I would give The Original Pancake House a 5-star rating. The food tastes fantastic and it is very reasonable for the price.

I have also visited the one in Northern VA, and South field MI. The main differences are the prices, combinations, and menu layouts. The main thing they all have in common is the best pancakes that you can find at a restaurant period.\n\nThat being said, every year after Ramadan ends, Muslim's usually go to breakfast. I credit myself as the person that fought for everyone to go to OPH, which I we know as OHOP, because everyone always wanted to go to iHop. There was a staunch iHOP supporter in our cliche, but she thankfully has retreated to Jordan, but sadly I have also made a tactical withdraw to Michigan where the OPH is not quite the same. \n\nWhy OPH, is better than IHOP:\n\n1. They will allow to sub anything for anything, and pay the difference, IHOP will not.\nexample: IHOP will not allow you sub meat for non-meat, even if you don't eat meat!\n\n2. OPH has better options for people who don't want to eat meat, but do want to eat eggs. \nexample: Hash brown and eggs Combo comes with Pancakes.\n\n3. OPH pancakes are perfection, IHOP pancakes are a joke and are only eaten as a result of good marketing and advertising. \n\n4. OPH has better syrup, made from fresh ingredients. The strawberry syrup is made with real strawberries, The Blueberry is made with real blueberries. \nThis cannot be said about IHOP. Think about that next time you are at IHOP trying to pull that syrup jug that's stuck on the table to pour over your lowsy IHOP pancakes.\n\n5. OPH omellets are bigger and better, granted that are different style.\nExample: I brought my friend there, and before we order I asked him, \"Are you ready?\". He didn't what I was talking about until the mammoth omelet came out. I am sure OPH is a great way to put your kids to sleep for the day, worth trying. \n\nIHOP omellets aren't bad as long as they don't cross contaminate your food, with things you don't want.\n\nI think I have made my point, the take away here, is OPH has the best pancakes period, if you know better send me a message or something.", "business_id": "UzMMpUFwJhwUkHOyeXeWsQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-07-27", "type": "review"}

On certain days, you can pay $3-4 and get some sort of mystery beer.  What can I say - I love the mystery of it!  I got a Mexican Logger and thought it was pretty good.\n\nTheir menu has pretty standard bar-fare, with sandwiches, wings, and pizza.  Their pretzels were decent, but I had a River Rocket sandwich and was thoroughly unimpressed.  For the portion sizes and quality, their food is seriously overpriced.  One Sunday, my partner and I came in while he got an oil change.  It was probably a little before noon, and we came here because we thought breakfast places would be busy.  We intended to just get lunch, but lo and behold, we say people with plates and breakfast food on them.  Not knowing anything about it and asked the waitress, who did not tell us much except that apparently it is $11 if you are not a member.  It turns out this was a TERRIBLE idea.  So, I asked if they had coffee, which they did - SERVED IN A REGULAR BEER GLASS.  It was a very weird situation for us.  All the food on it was cold, it had only eggs, sausage, potatoes, and some muffins.  First off, it was GROSS.  Second, there was barely anything left on it and they were not refilling it (when we left, it was all gone).  It would have been nice for our waitress to tell us this before we ordered, but she looked like she could not be bothered.  I probably would have complained, but we decided instead to pay and leave.  It was a lesson learned to check the buffet before just blindly ordering.  Another family came in afterward for the buffet, which turns out had no food on it by that time.

On any normal day you seem to get by with the average slip here or two, which is always amended right away, but this really took the cake. \n\nGlass night- Monty Python goblet. Knew what kind of turn out they were going to have so we made it a point to get there 30mins early. Even with getting there this early, we literally only had one table in the back open. Packed house. \n\nOur waitress, Amanda, came over and took our order right away for the glasses. We had no reason to believe we wouldn't get them as it was roughly 6:40 at this point. Right at 7, glasses were given out to a few tables around us. We sat. And sat. And sat. Finally she came out to tell us we wouldn't be getting ours due to the fact they had only received half the shipment. I'll circle back to this later.\n\nShe also said the manager would come out and speak with us and that we had a free beer on them. Well long story short the manager never came to speak with us and the free beer was only limited to house brews, so if you were trying to pick away at your UFO club with 100+ brews tasted already, that didn't sound like it was happening either.\n\nThe thing that REALLY aggravated me was that the manager, who I didn't know until she was pointed out last night, came around to 5 other tables in the back area and apologized for the mishap. Every table BUT ours! She walked back up front and never came back!\n\nThe entire experience was fairly upsetting for being an avid fan of this place. If what was told to us was true, Amanda did a good job of handling herself, I'm sure that night was a mess for any waitress. As far as management is concerned, yeah, I am still pretty pissed off.\n\nAnd as per the glasses, which is whatever really, when you know your frequent customers see them out on the shelves on Monday, I would use a better excuse than \"we didn't know we only had half the shipment\", that is just pretty lame.

Hickory Tavern is FULL of large flat screen TV's and usually have whatever the prime viewing for the time is on a huge projection screen on a rear wall.

I was quickly greeted by my server, Katlyn, and she was fantastic - my drink was kept filled and she checked up on me periodically without helicoptering around me.  As I put in my Tip for this location, I believe she said on Thursdays that shrimp were $.60 and oysters were $.75, bit since I don't eat either, I wasn't exactly tuned in.  The table next to me got oysters and he commented that they were tasty.  \n\nThe food:\nTurkey Club w/ Tavern chips ($9.50):  Turkey with melted cheese, bacon, lettuce and tomato, served warm.  The bread, if you are a Costco person, is one of their torta rolls that are deee-licious.  The sandwich was good, and I like that it was served warm, but it needed a little more flavor to it.  Maybe next time I will ask for a side of BBQ sauce or the like to punch it up a bit.  The house made chips were thick sliced potato chips, crispy, but not hard and served with a slightly spicy dipping sauce - they were good and not overly salty, which was perfect.  \nKey Lime Cheesecake ($6.95):  This tasted like another Queen City Pastry dessert and was delicious.  Served with several swirls of whipped cream, this light key lime cheesecake, on a graham cracker crust, with a thin layer of lime sauce on top, was the perfect somewhat light dessert the finish the meal.  \n\nExcellent service and the food was slightly above average for this type of restaurant.

I'm giving it 4 Stars because we have had far more good experiences than bad ones but you don't know quite what you're going to get when you go.  Food is generally good but it can be slow.  If you're hungry be sure to order some starters as soon as you arrive. They still might take 20+ minutes.  Wings, nachos, and other bar food is usually pretty consistent though there are exceptions.  Usually their chicken tenders are outstanding--among the best I have ever had.  However, sometimes they serve a substitute which are among the worst I have ever had.  Service is also hit and miss.  Even with a good waitress we find that they are \"gone\" far more than they are circulating.  They tend to congregate at the bar, particularly when things are slow.  Some are good at their job and seem to be competent and happy that they are in food service.  Others act like they despise being in food service and seem like they'd rather be doing ANYTHING other than waiting on the general public.  The place does need a really good clean-up and re-fresh.  The men's restroom is worse than any bowling alley or bus station I've ever been to.  It's the worst of any restaurant I've ever been to and has been for years.  It needs major repairs and cleaning.  Ideally it should be completely overhauled with completely new facilities, improved ventilation and some sort of deodorizer.  It seems to be undersized for the place and between that and apparent vandalism, it's always in poor shape.  \n\nI like the good experiences I have had at Baileys.

Things sure went downhill after that! They are simply trying WAY too hard to lure in customers now. DJs, bands, unnecessary events, most of which nobody cares about are a regular occurrence here.

We didn't wait too long for initial server visit, and I could tell by her fumbling through notes that she was probably new.  When she couldn't tell me what the seasonal draft was, but quickly told me that they only had bottles, I should have asked for another table.  We ordered our appetizer and boys' food first, then our entrees.  \n\nThe food came out in a timely manner, but then we didn't see the waitress for a while.  We were all hoping for a refill and I kept looking around, but never saw her even walking near the registers.  All the other wait staff were moving around, checking on tables, but ten minutes goes by before even see her, and had to flag her down.  \n\nI asked for refills on sodas and water, and for a draft of another brew, then another ten minutes goes by before she returns with refills and news that all the draft beers were back in bottles.  \n\nWhat? \n\n\"They don't have any more drafts.\"  Fine, another bottle.  Still no entrees.  Five minutes later she returns with a bottle, puts it on the table, walks on.  We have empty plates and cups sitting on the edge of the table, and start looking around for her again.  No sign.  \n\nFinally, after flagging her down again and ASKING about our food, she goes into the back, then comes out and tells us that our food has been delivered to another table, and would we like the kitchen to start plates for us to eat in or take-out. \n\n Blank stare.  \n\nI asked if the kitchen almost had ours ready since there was a mix-up.  No, she says, she has to tell them if we are taking it out. I ask \"What did the manager on duty say?\"  She said \"He's in the kitchen.\"  Blood begins to boil: \"We will Not be eating in OR take-out, please just give us our check.\"  Comes back a few minutes later, bill is $49+ and she walks off.  I look over the ticket: double charged for drinks, charged for draft brews that apparently didn't even exist, and No response from the manager.  \n\nI ask the nearest server if she could could kindly summon the manager for me.  He was out in less than a minute, very courteous, and asks what is wrong.  I explain, in this much detail, what had happened.  He informs me that he has no knowledge of any misdirected food NOR has he taken anything off our ticket.  He then took the ticket and cleared it out except for the two bottles of re-bottled draft.  I left a minimal gratuity based on charged beverages alone; I hate being lied to.\n\nWill not be returning to this location.

I've been here a few times with friends, but this was the worst experience I've had. We were seated immediately, however our server was not a good one. I believe his name is Chris... He took our drink order and didn't ask if we wanted any apps or wanted to put in any orders. Once we got it drinks, it took him a while to come back to take the order. He never came to check on us once we got our food or asked if anybody wanted to order another drink. Before he brought the checks I asked for 2 of the Tennessee whiskey cakes. He then brought the checks and didn't add the cakes in. My total was $19.52, so I paid with a $20 and we were all going to leave a tip collectivity. I was the only person that paid cash. When he returned to the table, he brung everyone else their cards back, kept my change and receipt, and didn't return with my cake. He said y'all have a good night. I then asked him where my cake was because at that point I wasn't worried about the change. He says \"oh, damn... I didn't put it in. You still want it?\" DUH! That was the purpose of me telling you I wanted it! He put the order in, brung the cakes, then says y'all have a good night.

This restaurant does not realize that there are too many restaurants in the immediate area for both the food and service to be subpar.\nThe restaurant was fairly empty (approximately 7 occupied tables), however, the server was not attentive and slow to serve. She barely came to the table to check on us. She never once refilled our waters. And, she never cleared the table of the appetizer plates; we were eating our entrees and she never came back to clear the table of those plates. It was a crowded mess. Speaking of entrees- the sizzle plates that come with grilled orders were dirty. Dried cheese and muck from another diner were stuck to these plates. We advised the manager. His response was, \"well, the plates are supposed to get washed- there are two piles in the back, one clean and one dirty....sorry, you did not get clean ones.\" And, that was it. He did not offer to take the meals off the bill, or anything else. He said, \"thanks for the feedback,\" then he left.\nThe food itself was eh. The spinach artichoke dip, which we would normally get, must be a new recipe. It was bad. We ordered two caesar salads, and she brought two house salads. Sure, she changed them- after we clicked that mechanism on the table that flashes, and then waiting another five minutes for her to reappear from some where and us vigorously flagging her down. The bread that came with an entree was like a brick- one bite was enough to determine that you could break your teeth on it. And the chicken that I ordered, had a funny taste.\nNeedless to say, if you want a decent meal with at least decent service, DO NOT come to this restaurant.", "business_id": "98hOHm56D0Boz2LCg0-irg", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-07-02", "type": "review"}

First, we had to practically beg them to take a reservation for ten, which they sort of honored. At least there were a few free tables they were able to push together when we arrived.\n\nOur waitress was the only shining star - she did a good job of taking care of 9 people with 7 separate checks and she kept the drinks refilled. She was also helpful in getting a couple of the TV's switched over to the Panthers game (they lost).\n\nWe had a few appetizers for the table. The pretzel \"bones\" were good, served with a couple of different sauces, as were the onion rings with their dipping sauces. If you like cheese fries, try the Fire Stix which were the best part of the meal.\n\nHaving read the reviews, I knew to stay away from the brisket. I went with a \"lunch\" sized portion of sliced smoked turkey breast. It was dry and not much more than warm. After we asked, the waitress brought out the bbq sauces, which improved the bland taste. The \"fire roasted corn\" was good - a corn and red pepper medley that was tasty. The mashed potatoes with gravy were good as well, especially when I mixed it with the corn. ;-) Both sides were too small and my friend sitting next to me got an even smaller undersized scoop of potatoes with his salmon.\n\nWe didn't have dessert.

It saddens me because it has the potential to be a really great establishment.  I say this because the facilities at Smokey Bones are well-above decent.  There is plenty of parking.  The inside of the restaurant is spacious and includes a nice, roomy bar as well.  There are plenty of TVs draped throughout the restaurant.  Their screen setup could be awesome, except they aren't HD.  They are the big box TVs from the early 90s.  In addition there is a speaker at every booth which allow you to listen to the TV of your choice.   \n\nWithout wasting too much time on this place - I ordered the the half-rack of ribs.  Though they looked (see pics) and smelled great, THEY WERE THE MOST DREADFUL RIBS I've ever had.  ANYWHERE.  The ribs tasted as if they had been cooked the night before, thrown in the cooler over night and then taken out and reheated and served to me for lunch. \n\nThis place shouldn't be allowed to serve ribs or even call itself a BBQ restaurant.

Their managers and staff are all knowledgeable about the beer list and can steer you in the right direction \n\nIf you're a beer snob, this is a place you should check out. Join the beer club, and get free beer, shirts, mugs, and a plaque on the wall, just for trying new & different beer! How can you beat that?\n\nThe food is pretty decent for bar food. I've had great meals and ok meals, never any bad meals. The offerings are inventive, like the Irish Spring Rolls filled with corned beef, sauerkraut, and swiss cheese. My only complaint is that the kitchen closes so early, and the bar does too for that matter. No food is served after 10pm, which for someone used to living in a big city is borderline ridiculous. The bar closes at midnight every night of the week, which is odd to me too, but then again, I'm used to late-night bars & restaurants in bigger cities. \n\nThere's plenty to do, from pool, darts, live music, horseshoes, ping pong, and cornhole.

I never go off the beaten path at cozy little diners like this. I always go for the greasy spoon stuff because Pine Cone is a greasy spoon. What's not to love about a small town cozy place with some good grub and speddy service? \n\n1st Trip- I got a brat with hash browns and sunny side up eggs. Friend got a rueben with fries. We both had no complaints. it was very satisfying. Judging by the texture and of my friend's corned beef on his reuben, I could tell it was fresh and the Pine Cone's corned beef moves quickly. Alot of greesy spoons with 100+ items on the menu serve inedible slices of corned beef with a metalic shimmer on them. NOPE! Not here. Thick slabs of butter tender goodness.\n\n2nd Trip- My friend got the chicken salad club house with fries and I got the rueben since I never got to eat a bite of his on the last visit. It was delicious.\n\nAnother thing to note is the incredible bakery section. Try the cinamon rolls. They are to die for. I will definitely be back soon and try more than a cinamon roll next time.\n\nI noticed reviewers write some complaints about Pine Cone so i was skeptical.

What I mean by this is the quality of the meals and the atmosphere of this supper club is good enough to warrant return visits but not to elicit rave reviews.  I'm not a supper club kind of guy, so right off the bat a place like the Green Lantern isn't going to be my favorite.  However there are plenty of old school supper clubs that do a nice enough job that I've got no qualms tagging along for dinner on a Friday night.  The Green Lantern is one of these places, albeit just barely.\n\nMy friend, however, absolutely loves this place.  As such I've had cause to dine here many times over the years.  There are quite a few pluses.  The bartenders are quick and generally friendly, and they've got an adequate tap selection including Ale Asylum offerings.  I love the location right off the lake, and two-thirds of the seating areas have great atmosphere.  The service has always been above average and I can't think of a bad experience - this type of consistency over the years is very hard to maintain.  They've got Wiggies, which are kind of like low-rent roesti - hashbrowns with onions, peppers and American cheese.  And finally the Green Lantern is obviously popular with the denizens of McFarland.  I don't recall a single trip out here where the bar wasn't mostly full and the restaurant hopping.\n\nThe negatives: first and foremost I've always found the menu to be pretty limited.  I'm not big on fish fry, and the Green Lantern's Friday night menu doesn't have much else aside from sandwiches and a grilled chicken breast entree.  Now as I said, I'm not big on fish fry so my opinion should be taken lightly, but the times that I have ordered the fish I've been underwhelmed.  This is probably just me - my friend simply can't get enough of the stuff.  Prices are moderately high for the perceived quality, though the bar is quite reasonable.  There's also a bit of a hassle when it comes to paying the bill.  While I've never had any concerns with service from the waitstaff, I have stood around for upwards of 15 minutes waiting to have the hostess swipe my card.  That is unacceptable and it's unfortunately led to smaller tips to otherwise deserving waitresses.  Finally, it always seems that after waiting 20-30 minutes for a table on a Friday night we always end up either in the basement or at one of the few poorly located tables upstairs.  \n\nIf it were just up to me I don't think I'd be going to the Green Lantern all that much.  After all, I don't live in McFarland and I don't really go for supper club fish fries.  But so long as I know people that love going here I'll tag along and have a decent enough time.  I think you'd be hard pressed not to at least be able to do that at the Green Lantern.", "business_id": "rdAdANPNOcvUtoFgcaY9KA", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-08-24", "type": "review"}

I got the blue gill/lake perch combo and my fiancee got the Caribbean salmon.  I know blue gill is a thinner fish, and while my dish was good, there was not a lot of actual fish under the batter.  I got a salad with my fish with a tomato basil vinaigrette, which was surprisingly good and coleslaw which was pretty standard.  The salmon with the Caribbean dipping sauce was fantastic, but the veggies he got as a side was just some steamed broccoli and carrots- not very creative!

At its worst it is the epitome of a townie joint.  I've seen both over the last five years.  When I first visited the Boar it was a dive.  My college roommate had a job tending bar and we would from time to time take up his offer of free drinks in return for keeping him company.  The barstools were often filled with the usual regulars, drinking under a thick pall of smoke.  There is a certain charm to dive bars and I'm sure for some the old Boar had it, but not for me.  \n\nFortunately the owner completed renovated the entire bar, and this happened right about the time I moved out to MIddleton.  In place of the dingy walls was stylish wood paneling and tile floors instead of linoleum.  The ceilings were raised and the ventilation was improved, and while it can certainly still get smoky my eyes don't burn anymore.  There is a sand volleyball court out back and bar leagues during the summer.  The jukebox is relatively standard, but there are a few gems tucked in amidst the usual country & hard rock options.  The regular crowd is still around, but a good deal more young people can be found at the Boar these days.  Some nights are vibrant and fun, some not so much.  I can't say that I've tried much of the food.  I know from my old roommate that there is a small grill in back, which was added during the renovation.  The Emil's pizzas are good as always.  All in all the new Boar is a complete improvement over the old one.\n\nThere are still a few things that keep the Boar from being my favorite in Middleton, namely the tap selection.  I am a beer snob and proud of it, so when the only local tap option is Spotted Cow I call foul.  I can't think of another Middleton bar that doesn't have at least one Capital tap, or at least Esser's Best.  What really seals it for me is sometimes the Spotted lines aren't even clean and the beer comes out flat and a bit funky.  Another complaint that I frequently have is some of the bartenders know next to nothing about proper drink mixing.  It is usually the same bartenders that act put upon to even mix a drink as opposed to just grabbing a bottle.  Some of the older bartenders are very good, but you almost have to know the schedule to avoid the others.", "business_id": "c5awCF5eu0ZkxUf_i94uPA", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-06-04", "type": "review"}

Turns out, fancy means tomatoes and high fructose corn syrup, upon further inspection. Who knew. Friend had a burger, which he described as tasteless. He tried dumping a lot of fancy ketchup on it, but finally gave up. They also have pizzas and other things, and another friend said the cheese curds are good.

Limited tap selection, although they have a few interesting items: Great Lakes Ale and Esthers Best were two that stood out as fun and not what you'd normally find at a more mainstream location.  They also have daily drink specials - we tried the Lemon Smash (hand squeezed (with each drink) lemonade + vodka) and the Whiskey Old Fashioned Sour.  Both were great.\n\nFood? We tried the famous chili - meaty, slightly spicy, and delish.  Not the best I've ever had, but not bad by any means.  We tried the vegetable beef soup - hearty, loaded with veggies, and the meat was tender and of good quality.  \n\nFor our entrees, we went a bit conservative - grilled chicken salads - but they were huge and tasty.  Fresh, fresh, fresh veggies - the tomatoes were wonderful as were the onions (red, and soooo sweet).  The salad was definitely an unexpected surprise - I'd get it again in a heartbeat!  \n\nOur dining companion ordered some chicken strips which he requested be tossed in their hot wings sauce.  The result?  Wow - tasty, especially if you're a fan of vinegar-based wing sauce that packs a bit of a kick.

Since they were supposed to close at 11:00 pm we figured it was enough time to eat. When we walked in there were only three other tables of people, one of which was a couple that came in right before us. We waited at the host stand for 3 minutes and finally were greeted by the bartender. He took us to our table and told us our waitress would be with us shortly.  \n\nThe only server left (female, dark brown hair) came over and rushed her greeting by acting annoyed that we were there. She took our order and ran off to start doing the close prep. 5 minutes later she came back to our table and said that the bar was closing (10:30 pm) and that we couldn't get frozen drinks. She asked if we were interested in ordering another type of drink but we declined. She then acted annoyed that we didn't want something other than water! \n\nOur food quickly came out and it was WONDERFUL (thankfully) but our waitress never came back to check on us. I ran out of water and just as I was putting my napkin down she came over with another glass. At that time we asked for our check. We were so mad about the quality of the service that we just wanted to get out of there. We ended up walking out the door at 11:00 pm on the dot! \n\nMy partner and I always tip a min of 20% but often if we like someone we will tip way above. Our service was so terrible that we left her a 15% tip with a note explaining how uncomfortable she made our visit. If she had one ounce of sweetness to her we would've given her 20% BUT she was cold and distant. I understand wanting to get off of work but at least fake a smile and a personality. \n\nI will not be coming back. Yes, the food was amazing BUT bad service equals a no go in my book.

When my friend also complained that his berry dessert was only half of what it should be (completely deflated and only half the bowl), she didn't offer to take it back or anything, just kind of laughed it off.

The menu is very large as they have  two, one for breakfast and the other for lunch/dinner. \nService has always been good when I've dined there and the staff has good knowledge of the menu. \n\nI reserve 4 and 5 stars for upscale and gourmet restaurants but is give the CB a solid 3 stars.", "business_id": "QF14BFUVHRODxGNVflgm3A", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-06-07", "type": "review"}

I will stick to TGIFridays, Texas Roadhouse and Outback Steakhouse from now on;they never disappoint and we have no problem putting down $50 or $60 plus a $10+ tip. For the same $40 spent, we could have gotten a meal we actually enjoyed. The only good part was my daughter's chicken fingers, fries and pepsi. Sad. We will not be returning.

On one hand, I want to say Monty's is an awesome place with great food. On the other hand I want to say Monty's is overrated. \n\nLet me explain. \n\nI love Monty's because of the options. If you are a vegetarian or vegan you aren't confined to the world of salads. There are many delicious and satisfying options. If you don't restrict your diet in any way, there are many great meaty and chalorically rich options for you too. Watching carbs? Get a sandwich in a wrap. Looking for a healthy lean meat option? Choose one of the several good chicken dishes. \n\nI personally steer towards the lean meat or veggie dishes and have never been disappointed. It's really hard to find a restaurant that caters to my needs as well as my boyfriend's nonrestrictive diet needs. This place does it well and at a pretty decent price. \n\nThough, I don't personally think Monty's is overrated, I feel that the point needs to be made. Whatever you order will be fresh and pretty tasty. However, say you order The Meatloaf of the Gods, it may not be what you expect if you are the type of person that is looking for traditional 'the-way-mom-made-it' meatloaf slathered with ketchup. If you are looking for an extensive breakfast menu consisting of traditional American breakfast combos (i.e. - a dish that contains ALL of the following: pancakes, eggs, hash browns, 3 kinds of meat and toast), Denny's or Perkin's may be a better option for you. \n\nThey put their own spin on the more traditional dishes and have created an awesome list of in-house specialties. Whether you eat meat or not you MUST try The Meatless Meatloaf of the Gods. It's amazing. Like your beef? Definitely try the Blueplate Burger! Don't like beef so much but still want a burger? Try the Blueplate Burger with a locally made walnut burger. \n\nNo matter who you are, Monty's is worth a try.", "business_id": "fjaQ3Ixkofh8xGhklUtDnA", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-08-10", "type": "review"}

It was weird.\n\nOur waiter failed to tell us the scrambler special and when we asked he told us it was artichoke, tomato and asiago. However, when it arrived the artichokes were not there. It was very disappointing. The breakfast potatoes were also a real let down. I love potatoes and they failed. However, the biscuit was delicious. \n\nWe also ordered pie. Two of our party ordered the Fat Elvis - which does not come in a pie-form - so they were upset. Their other waiter must have made that mistake. I went for the key lime pie which was delicious.

I am giving this place 5 stars because it is wonderful for a very simple meal, with excellent service. \n\n We had a little trouble finding the door (the entrance is in the back facing away from Packers Ave.) but once we walked in and sat at one of their wobbly tables, we were instantly greeted by our friendly server.  Though the bar was busy, we got our drinks immediately, along with a basket with two basic white bread rolls and coleslaw.  All very standard issue.  \n\nThe fish was another story. Whoa.  I got the Canadian perch and my boyfriend got the Canadian walleye.  The large single piece of walleye was lightly breaded and fried perfectly.  It was buttery, non-fishy, and totally delicious.  The baked potato that came with it was pretty standard, but good.  The perch was battered differently in a thicker, more crunchy coating.  The little strips were just AMAZING.  I got a pile of 7 or 8 strips that I honestly couldn't stop eating.  The fries were done to perfection as well.  \n\nMy boyfriend and I are somewhat light eaters in general, but we cleared out all of that fried goodness in one sitting.  On the way out the cooks from the back yelled good bye, the bartender wished us a good night, and someone standing by the door smiled and asked us to come back soon.  I can't say enough about how friendly everyone here is.  It looks like a burned out biker bar, but their simple menu is done right.

Enter Harmony, the harbinger of good things to come. I'm not one who enjoys going out alone, especially to bars, but that's something I'm trying to get over. So it was a relief to see the place only half filled with low key, relaxed people who barely noticed I was there. I was however, immediately noticed by the friendly, smiling young bartender (who looked all of fourteen), so I was put further at ease. Also delightful was a live band playing happy zydeco music in the other room, a genre which I adore. I sat at the bar and ordered my 'beer brat'. With sauerkraut, it's only $5.25. Win! They also had a fairly good selection of craft brews on tap, and mine was cold and delicious. Brat, beer and fries for $12.\n\nThe brat is pre-cooked and then browned in the tiny kitchen just off the bar, and it's always fun to watch food being made (if you're me). They also grill the kraut, a nice touch. It's served on a big, somewhat fluffy sesame seed bun, which seemed like an odd choice, but it worked. The fries are good, too, and the order is huge. I would have sprung for the deservedly popular pub chips and bleu cheese dip, but they were twice the price of the fries. It was a lot of food, and totally satisfying, and I finished every last bite.

They are similar to Culvers but doesn't offer you that \"home quality\" kind of experience. \n\nI typically get the Bleu Ribbon with some pink. I like the fried onion straws they add to the burger as well as this chipotle spread they use after toasting their buns. Mix that with the burger, BBQ sauce and bleu cheese and you've got a great tasting large juicy burger. I sometimes have to cut it in half because it's hard to take a bite out of. The burger comes with a side of endless steak fries they are often cooked to perfection. They are one of the few places that offers onion rings, however, as much as I love me some rings, I do not care much for theirs. The onions they use are extremely thick making it hard to bit into. I have often times ended up just eating the breading and putting the onions to the side. They are onion rings! This doesn't make any sense! They need to slice their onions thinner. As of now, I do not believe they are editable. \n\nMy other negative is presentation. The Bleu Ribbon has a lot going on so I realized that sometimes the burger can get messy. However, there have been times where my burger has come out looking like it went through a tornado. Lettuce falling everyone, too much BBW sauce, bleu cheese thrown on. The presentation needs to get better. I've experienced this at two different Red Robins. Also, I've also noticed that within the last year, they've cut back on the amount of steak fries they give you. Since they are bottomless it makes really no difference but I've definitely seen a change. \n\nThat being said, I would rate Red Robbi as being more than just an \"A-OK\" burger joint but they are far from a \"4+ star\" quality kind of joint. I do like the atmosphere. They have a few game machines, TV's, bar, background music and great classic pictures hanging on the walls that are great for helping to start a conversation ( say you're on a first date?). The art and photography they use to decorate the place I believe adds a lot of character and \"spunk\". \n\nThey do get very busy on weekends so expect a wait for a table and for your food but from my experience, it has never been extremely long. Wait staff has been good for me as well. \n\nOverall, they are a solid burger place. A bit pricey but I do think they are good. \n\nOh, one more thing, if you're dieting,....The Bleu Ribbon is 1,001 calories and fries are close to 500 calories!!! (According to my \"Lose it!\" app - they could be wrong but I also believe this is an extremely high calorie meal)", "business_id": "4pZeC9W0EIiBTOJMnwG2vw", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-06-04", "type": "review"}

Nothing beyond what you can get anywhere else in this city. What takes places like this to another level is the service and the ambiance. This is what took Red Robin straight into the toilet.\n\nFrom the moment we walked in, this place felt different. I've been here off and on for years, but there was a weird vibe in the air. I knew it was going to be a memorable visit after the hostess asked if we were \"going to need a high chair for that?\" while gesturing at our 9 month old daughter.\n\nWe were seated fairly quickly, which was nice, and our server seemed average, didn't tell us about anything new, didn't ask us if it was our first time at Red Robin (usually they do, and it wasn't, but still, try a little), and didn't bring us any silverware or napkins. Took our drink order, took our order, and left.\n\nShe knew we had a baby with us, and knew that she had just taken an order from the table of 8 behind us, and didn't bother to consider bringing the fruit cup for our daughter or my wife and I a basket of fries ahead of time since we'd be waiting a bit due to the large ticket in queue ahead of us. She didn't even bother checking on our drink situations in the meantime. Just went all ghost and ignored us.\n\nIn this meantime, my wife and I are entertaining our daughter and looking and watching around us. She notices the manager checking in with other tables and rolling her eyes a bit after a few exchanges with customers. I notice a few scoffs and eye-rolls among the staff, and start to get bothered by how the staff is acting like this job is beneath them.\n\nAnother server brings us our food. I had asked for a side of sauce that doesn't show up, but she gets it promptly. I had asked for no tomato on the burger, but was talked over so she must not have heard it. No big deal.\n\nWe go to serve some fruit to our daughter, but we still don't have any silverware or napkins, so we ask and some are brought reasonably promptly. And set right in front of our 9 month old daughter. Not the brightest of plans to set metal forks and knives in front of any small child, but especially one who is currently fussing a bit at not having any food.\n\nAt no point does the manager come by to check on us. Our server barely says another word to us after handing us the bill. They coasted this entire time, why did I expect them to suddenly make any effort? Because I thought they would want us to come back.\n\nI'm of the belief that if you think your job is beneath you, then you should prove it. You never know who is watching or who you're serving, and who may be able to help you get out of the job that you don't really like. I mean, there are so many places to get a mediocre burger, you may as well offer above and beyond service to make it stand out.\n\nI guess when even the manager is rolling her eyes at customers, the rest of the staff begins to believe that kind of behavior is acceptable.", "business_id": "4pZeC9W0EIiBTOJMnwG2vw", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-06-29", "type": "review"}

It is a dark bar filled with old beer signs and locals, and for this, as well as the service and experience of eating here, I'd give the place five stars if my conscience would allow it.\n\nThere's a procedure to Toby's.

They make it to order. Because of this, it can hold up the meal, which the server will generally alert you about. My friend loves the fried colossal shrimp, which is awesome and also $$$. I generally get the cod, which is good. I doubt any of the fish is fresh, but perhaps on the weekends, it is. \n\nAll meals come with a salad. Get the blue cheese dressing. You can also add blue cheese crumbles. \n\nIf you love fantastic service and Wisconsin kitsch, this is a great joint. Don't expect five-star food, despite the five-star reviews.

We had to go steal ketchup from another table. When we were half done eating she tried to clear our plates.

We absolutely loved it! Enough so that we went again last night. \n\nTheir twice-baked potato was fantastic, one of the best potatoes I've ever eaten. The only bad thing it that they only serve it on Friday and Saturday nights, so if you go any other time, you're SOL. \n\nOn our first visit, my son, my step-daughter-to-be and I all got beef and noodles. The children's version is served with mashed potatoes on the side, while the full-size meal is served over a bed of mashed potatoes. It was delicious and also very filling. Even though it was the nightly all-you-can-eat meal, I was only able to eat one plate. My fiance ordered fried chicken and it was very good. Lightly breaded and juicy, just the way fried chicken should be. \n\nOn our second visit I got the all-you-can-eat popcorn shrimp, the Saturday night special. Paired with the twice-baked potato, my meal was excellent. This was no tiny, marble sized shrimp; they were plump and perfectly fried. Not to mention, all-you-can-eat shrimp for only $8.75? Are you kidding me? My fiance got the beef and noodles, which was just as tasty as the first time. The kids got chicken strips and fries, which were just what you would expect, but the portions were huge. \n\nThe staff is very friendly and they remembered us from the first time we were there. Our waitress even commented that my son had gotten a haircut in between. The salad bar is nothing super special, but it's adequate. I loved the cucumber salad and the kidney bean salad. \n\nAlmost everything made here is done so from scratch. I don't know if the popcorn shrimp was, but the beef and noodles, fried chicken and mashed potatoes definitely were. According to the menu we brought home, they peel about one ton of potatoes a week. The homemade rolls are heavy and very good. Even better, they have apple butter in a squeeze bottle right at the table. I could almost make an entire meal of their rolls with apple butter. \n\nThe only bad thing about The Apple Dumplin' is their location. They are located a few miles outside of town in the last place you would expect a restaurant to be. There is a reason it took me so long to come here....... because I didn't even know about it.

Both the booths and bar are deep mahogany, the ceiling is black, and there are only very dim lights over each booth, so it's a rather dark, relaxing atmosphere.

Burgers, chicken and fried fish sandwiches, salads, and some appetizers - all ranging $6-8. However, they do have excellent Chicago style hotdogs, which is actually a (weekly?) lunch special. Also have a white pizza with olive oil, mozzarella, fresh garlic and fresh roma tomatoes that's pretty decent - a soft flavor that accentuates the tomatoes more than anything (personally, I love a strong garlic taste, but this was OK). It's even better with grilled chicken, which, by the way, is not some 1/4 inch thick, pinky-long piece of meat. My grilled chicken sandwich was a good couple inches wide and had no trouble covering their generous-sized buns. That goes for all dishes, actually. Huge portions. The turkey club is a 4-inch stack of turkey, bacon and toast with 4 handfuls of fries; carrot cake is a 4-layer, 1/5 of the cake slab of moist cake layered with cream cheese icing and perfectly roasted pecans, carrots, and coconut (good for 4 people). The white chicken chili is another \"extra\" offering that is not spicy, but chocked full of beans, chicken and tomatoes served with sour cream and shredded cheese. The beans were almost crunchy, which signaled they were not cooked long enough, but the soup was still unique and served as a good meal starter.\n\nBasically, relaxed and charming atmosphere with lots of entertainment options for college students, or perfect ambiance for quiet conversation and an American meal. Tons of food for the money. The parking lot is riddled with deep pot holes, though, and the place itself is tricky to enter from Neil St the first time you try to find it.", "business_id": "eNEV1AbQsDMYtxCeXXpUGQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2007-06-01", "type": "review"}

I come to a bar to have a relaxed fun evening, Rich has more than once made the evening very uncomfortable.\n\nI have been in the bar when Rich wasn't working, and when he is not there the people behind the bar are relaxed, they smile, and seem to have fun, but when Rich is there everyone is on edge and grumpy. God forbid anyone does anything in his \"territory\", they get a nasty look.\n \nThis man is more worried about making sure that everything behind the bar is in its place and perfect, than he is about giving good service to his customers, he will walk by an empty glass many times without asking if you need another drink, you have to flag him down.\n\nI think he has been there much too long, and has lost the knowledge that the customer comes first.", "business_id": "pPWre8lbVAssER6CN0uWMw", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-07-24", "type": "review"}

And while the food is typical of most sports grills (burgers, sandwiches, and fried appetizers, for example), it's a great place to unwind or to escape the Phoenix heat.  There are the requisite large televisions tuned to the day's sporting events and plenty of memorabilia lining the walls.  Despite these sports bar staples, the place is actually quite cozy and quaint.\n\nBut while Majerle's is good in the afternoons, it absolutely rocks after Suns or D-Backs games.  The place is typically packed and it's not uncommon to find local or visiting athletes sipping beers on the narrow sidewalk patio.  The bartenders are personable and charming and it's not unusual for one of them to grab the mic and wander the restaurant singing karaoke (and singing it well).

Such was the case last night at Majerle's, former Phoenix Suns player Dan Marjerle's sports bar. With the Beyonce concert across the street at the arena AND a D-backs game at the ball park, Phoenix was a hoppin'.\n\nMy friend and I stopped into Majerle's, which I've been to a few times before, for dinner and drinks before going to see Beyonce. I had a cheeseburger and Cesar Salad. While I realize it's hard to mess up a Cesar Salad, my salad was seriously the best Cesar I've ever had. And my burger was packed with flavor. No wonder AOL  named them Best Burgers two years in a row. We also had a wonderful chocolate martini (with Vanilla Vodka, not creme based) here. And on Fridays if you're in the mood to really start the night, the bar offers a Corona or Pacifico with a shot of tequila for $7 as part of their Sizzlin' Friday special.\n\nMy only complaint was that our waitress suddenly went M.I.A for about 15 minutes when we were trying to close our tab so we could go to the show.  But I'm still going to cut them some slack because this is one of a few fun places to drink in the downtown area.\n\nHOT TIP: A second Majerle's will be opening in Chandler in the fall.", "business_id": "45puCRQ6Vh_IIAy7kkfFDQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-08-25", "type": "review"}

First I totally agree with previous reviews that complain about the location of the TVs. They are in such awkward spots and are only tuned to like two different things, which is semi-annoying. However I can't complain too much when one of them is tuned to Sportscenter which is all I really need as I eat my lunch. My major complaint about Majerle's is that it is a very awkward space. There is a hostess stand out front on the sidewalk but no one is ever there, so you have to walk in and then BAM you are like on top of the bar. So you're in the way while waiting for a hostess which I hate.\n\nOther than that main complaint, I'm not going to hate too much on the food. It's a freaking sports bar. They serve sports bar food. I am not expecting five star cuisine...I just fried goodness that will clog up my ateries and beer on tap. If they have a salad or two so I can feel better about myself, great. For the most part everything I have tried has been good, including the potato skins, grilled chicken caesar wrap, fried chicken salad, kids grilled cheese meal (hey I wasn't hungry that day!) and the house salad. The french fries are really good especially dipped in ranch. The only thing I didn't really like that I have tried has been the chicken tenders. Something about them was just a bit off to me.  Prices are decent considering the proximity to US Airways Arena and Chase Field.\n\nOverall a good lunch spot to grab a beer and get my sports fix, but not somewhere that warrants a special trip. I'll have to check it out before a game sometime to get the full effect.", "business_id": "45puCRQ6Vh_IIAy7kkfFDQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-06-06", "type": "review"}

All three times our waitress was rude and largely absent.  I'll add that we are really not into the whole TnA aspect of this restaurant, and treat our waitress like any other waitress.  No ogling, no rude comments, none of that immature bullshit.\n\nWe went here last night from 7pm until a little after 10pm, and didn't get a refill on water until just before we left, even though I'd downed the first cup within ten minutes of arriving and also ordered \"hot\" wings (the Daytona, which is hot sauce and bbq sauce mixed together, I guess.  Not hot at all).  The wings are tiny and completely overcooked.  I do not recommend these at all.\n\nFriend #1 ordered the boneless wings, which are a joke.  I ordered them last time and assumed it was just a fluke when they brought out a plate of ten tiny (smaller than Chicken McNuggets) hardened pieces of overcooked chicken.  I'm not the type to send things back at restaurants, so I just tried to pretend that I was eating some sort of food, and not little pieces of rubber.  However, Friend #1 received the same thing this time.  Tiny pieces of very chewy....chicken?  Maybe.  I do not recommend these at all.\n\nFriend #2 ordered a dozen hot wings.  Took just shy of an hour for them to arrive.  The waitress would pop up every fifteen minutes or so, and say something like, \"Oh my gosh, they haven't brought those yet?\"  When they did come out, they were tiny and overcooked, and also quite cold.  I do not recommend these at all.\n\nOverall, the worst restaurant in Phoenix, I think.  If they didn't offer the fight with no cover, they'd have literally no redeeming value.  I'm just going to Buffalo Wild Wings next time (they have a $5 cover and a drink minimum, but it has to be worth it).  This place needs to close down for a few months and reevaluate, or just go away entirely, like every other business in the AZ Center.\n\nOh, PS, they have never brought out our correct bill.

There hasn't been a time where I have had a bad experience here. The food has always been on point, customer service was not bad, and really nothing to complain about. I've always ordered the medium/hot wings along with the curly fries with cheese and a side salad. I've brought friends with me on several occasions, and they never had anything negative to say.\n\nIt's been a month or so that I've been here and decided to try the take out. Same order same expectations. Now I know every business will have their bad days but this is the first time here that has probably made me decide I will not return.\nI open the to go boxes and let's just say I was surprised. The fries looked extremely dull and I picked one up to try it; cold. Cold, dull fries that had an old taste to them. Not like they were sitting around but old as if they were out for a long time. Super soggy and just absolutely terrible. The wings were undercooked and the hot sauce that I usually get tasted bland and cold. It was as if they just battered them up with canned sauce. No flavor, and not the amazing wings I usually get there. I am thinking is this really the place I talk so good about?\nI read the negative reviews thinking this is not true. I now believe the \"hype\" regarding the issues they are having here. It's amazing how down under it has gotten since I've last been here. It's not like the food was waiting for a long time, I got there before it was even ready.\n\nHonestly, I am extremely disappointed. The manager was not much help and that just comes to show how down under this business is heading to. I don't know what else to say, 30$ that has gone to waste. Ate a few of the fries and maybe half of a wing that was disgusting.\n\nTo simply put it, it is very unlikely that I will return anytime soon.

We stopped for an early supper before heading back to Flag.  We weren't super hungry so we ordered the pretzel appetizer and split the fish and chips.  The server didn't seem annoyed by the split and said he would bring an extra plate.  So that was nice.  The pretzels were piping hot and fresh.   We got a cheese sauce and yellow mustard for dipping.  They were bread stick shaped and you get three.  The entree came with 3 nice sized pieces of fish, a big pile of fries, and cole slaw.  It was perfect for sharing or good for one hungry person.  Not a bad deal for $14.  The fish had the perfect light and crispy beer batter we prefer.  The fish was your basic flaky cod.  Seemed fresh.  The chips were your basic French fries.  Tasty but not remarkable.  The cole slaw was fine but not our favorite.  Had a weird sweetness and was not crisp.  Maybe made the day before!  Service was friendly.  Atmosphere was your basic bar and grill with a vague pub feel about it.  We were there at a weird time so not many people there.  PHX doesn't seem to have  a booming after hours in their downtown.   It is close to the sports arena and Orpheum theater so I can see it being a popular destination when something is going on there.

Its hard to believe that I'm downgrading them now that they have liquor available, but it's happening. \n\nThey normally have local draft brews at this place for 2 dollars, but apparently when they have a show they don't sell it at all. Only bottles for 3 or 4 dollars. What's worse is that every bottle I ordered wasn't cold, tasted like they just threw it in the ice bin 30 minutes before. AND they kept running out of beers. What's even worse is that the mixed drinks run 6 DOLLARS for a really tiny glass. This place needs to get its act together. I'll be drinking beforehand and elsewhere in between sets from now on. I don't get why the music venues in Phoenix don't understand how much more money they can make at a show with drink specials.\n\nThey also apparently haven't invested in air conditioning which makes summer shows not even worth it. Okkervil River still put on a great show to my surprise, which is the only thing (along with the other great shows i've seen there) that kept me downgrading this place to 3 stars or lower.\n\nThey are also in the middle of remodeling so the place looks kindof like crap right now.", "business_id": "4WcxnNv_lzCIG2eb8O5Mlg", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-07-26", "type": "review"}

Jefferson Street\nPhoenix, 85004\n\nIs there a difference between TGI Fridays restaurants? You bet!!\nSome are Franchises and some are corporate owned. Front Row Sports Grill is the only corporate owned TGI Fridays in the Phoenix area.\n\nI arrived at the Front Row at 3:30 in the afternoon - half an hour earlier than I was supposed to. Having never been to Chase Field before I wasn't sure how easily I would be able to park or even it's exact location. That turned out to be a non sequitur.\n\nAs I walked into the building a small paper sign stuck to one of the doors directed me to use the elevator to go to Front Row. The sign said to go upstairs, but since there was no downstairs, it seemed a bit redundant.\n\nThe restaurant overlooks the entire stadium with a magnificent view. Had I been a true sports fan, I'm sure I would have probably drooled, but I was here to sample the fare and to meet companion. I was promptly seated at one of the tables. This was probably the only thing that I did find fault with. The tables not at the windows are very high as are the seats that accompany them. I was so high up that my feet couldn't touch the floor, which made me feel a bit uncomfortable. When I asked for a shorter table, the hostess told me that the waiter's/waitress's for those tables hadn't come in yet.\n\nMy drink arrived quickly, and unlike many other diet drinks I've had before, had enough syrup in it to actually taste good. The waiter didn't even trip up when I asked him for some lemons to squeeze into my drink. He promptly brought a dish of lemon slices, nicely arranged to the table.\n\nWhile waiting for companion to arrive, I had time to study the menu. My first thoughts were that this was a place taking advantage of their location and charging for it. Fortunately, I was proven wrong again and again.\n\nCompanion arrived at 4:00, and we set about ordering appetizers. We shared an order of Buffalo wings which we asked for undressed but with assorted sauces to try with them. They were done to perfection, with stalks of celery and lots of dipping sauces. Companion had asked for the boneless wings, and the traditional were brought out by mistake. No problem for our server, who left the traditional wings at no charge and brought out the boneless ones. Again, while the boneless wings were of a different nature than the traditional ones, they were, non the less tasty and hot.\n\nSince companion was a member of their stripes club (kind of like a frequent flier club), they brought us a complimentary order of house made potato chips. Thick cut, crunchy, non-oily, loaded with Parmesan cheese, they were terrific! I'd eat another order of those any day even though they aren't on my diet.\n\nNext was main courses. The menu covers the gamut from simple fare to ribs and steaks. I ordered their Dragonfire chicken. A nicely cooked chicken breast with a kung pao glaze covered with pineapple pico de gallo and mandarin oranges on a bed of rice with fresh broccoli. The rice was the only weak part of this dish. It seemed over cooked and mushy, and I left some of it on my plate.\n\nOn the plus side, and a really big plus was the broccoli. Having eaten more than my share of the brassica family, most places tend to greatly over cook it, and usually serve it limp and dark green. My usual response is to leave it untouched on my plate. Yet here, in a relatively modest place, I found broccoli nirvana! Bright green, still crispy, and full of flavor.\n\nCompanion originally thought of ordering the ribs, but was so full from the appetizers that they ordered the Cheeseburger instead. Companion pronounced it to be perfectly cooked and nicely oozing with melted cheese. The burger was served on a brioche bun with all the proper accouterments. On the side were seasoned fries that were truly delicious.\n\nService was never rushed and our waiter came back to check on our needs often, but without being intrusive. Sanitation was good in the restaurant and the restroom, when I used it was nice and clean and fully supplied.\n\nAs followers of my writing are aware, I never let a restaurant know that I am reviewing them unlike some other reviewers. I made my first exception at the conclusion of this meal and complimented the kitchen manager. One has to wonder why, if a place like this can serve outstanding food, can't the rest of food service places follow suit? This was one of the most flavorful and excellent non-fancy meals that I have had the pleasure of enjoying in Phoenix.\n\nI rate this 4 stars for excellent food, great service, and general cleanliness.", "business_id": "1-1VcGTL3GyCqUpXZLFTZA", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-07-19", "type": "review"}

We all ordered a beer as soon as we were greeted by our server in which we waited 10 minutes for. We ordered an appetizer (the pretzels, which were hot and really pretty good) then ordered our food. I asked for the servers opinion between two dishes in which she replied she hadn't tried either. So I went with the pulled pork( usually a safe bet) then we waited.. And waited and waited some more.. Watched 4 or 5 tables that had sat after us get their food then we waited a little more. After about 35 minutes we finally had our food. It was Luke warm..

When she brought me my check back the receipt with the survey was gone. I asked where it went and she wasn't sure. She went and pulled it out of the garbage and gave it back to us nice and crumpled.

The staff was very friendly and it was lit cutely with string lights. We are so happy to have a late night spot to dine in Phoenix that's not a fast food restaurant. I absolutely love this place and we will definitely be back!", "business_id": "tb24fvNJfHhyKEXkKn12Xw", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-06-04", "type": "review"}

This is one of the first places I drag out-of-towners... usually for brunch. And when I have brunch at Welcome Diner, I usually cannot resist ordering the same thing, the Holy Puerco. Pulled pork, cheesy grit cake, pure heaven.\n\nThe best thing about this place, especially if you get one of the rare seats inside the luncheonette, is that it feels like you own the place. The staff cooking and carrying on are an arm's length away. I love the communal \"Hurricane!\" cheer that resounds whenever somebody orders one of these fresh-squeezed fruit cocktails. Welcome Diner is one of those places that the ambiance overwhelms you so suddenly that you are drawn in to the fun atmosphere... and though you may not be a morning drinker, you can easily be convinced that it's time for a beer or cocktail with breakfast.\n\nI can't say enough about the wonderful poutine here. Other places may just smother their fries in brown gravy, but this place used the white breakfast sausage gravy. Although the cheese curds get a little lost, this is a great way to eat poutine! I also like their choice of either sausage gravy or mushroom gravy if you order the biscuits and gravy (or, do half-and-half, if you must).\n\nThe crowd that dines here is cool, the staff is righteous, and the food is spot on.

Solid food and solid service make this a favorite. Just had the PB&B burger with real deal THICK cut bacon, bread and butter pickles and my favorite chunky peanut butter. Cooked to perfection and delivered promptly, it went down quick with an ice cold PBR. Before dinner I had their version of Sazerac, made with a rye whiskey in lieu of cognac. Delish. Probably my new favorite summer whiskey drink! Also to die for is the bumblebee, imagine an amazing chicken sandwich on a top notch biscuit drizzled with honey. Yum! I'm full as I write this waiting on beignets that were comped because our side of fries didn't make it out, but I could eat a bumblebee because it's that good. So great food, great drinks and a great al fresco dining experience make Welcome Diner one of my favorite spots in Phoenix.

However, the food is AMAZING. We came here on a Friday night at around 7 and it was decently busy. The thing about this restaurant is they make you tip before you get your food. I made the mistake of tipping 17%. While the food came out pretty fast, the staff forgot my boyfriend's drink, and left a whole entree off of our order (which we paid for!). All we got was a \"sorry\". After finishing our meal, we had to wait a whole 15 min for the side of fries we ordered to be brought with our sandwiches. No offer to make up for their mistakes. Being in the service industry for over 10 years, I have to say that that is no way to treat a first time customer whos experience was ruined due to lack of attention to detail. I would have expected a free drink or dessert, but it seems like the staff could care less about keeping patrons satisfied. I can't blame them though, they are super understaffed. I feel bad for any bartender who also has to wear the hat of a food runner AND a busser. Be weary of tipping over 10%, you don't want to regret it like I did.

They were all dolled up, '50s style and had that sweetie-pie personality down pat. I admitted I wasn't too familiar with places that offer so many soda options and asked for a recommendation. The server gladly offered her favorites, and I went with her suggestion, a cherry cheesecake soda. It was fantastic.\nI looked over the menu and was immediately disappointed, why is a turkey burger featured above the all-American diner staple, the cheeseburger?! And no fries? I briefly considered the chili dog but that too was made with turkey ... what kind of throw back retro diner was this?? Damn. I got the cheeseburger and potato chips, which came out pretty quick and the burger was hot as all get out, fresh off the skillet ... definitely not a grill and that was just about the worst patty I've paid for in my life. Dry, flavorless, terrible. Well, I had been warned and can't exactly complain.\nSeeing as I'm not a soda drinker and wasn't a fan of the food, I won't be back.

When I bit into my sandwich I expected strands of hot, gooey cheese to stretch in front of my face but instead I opened up my sandwich to find 3 slices of cheese barely stuck together and still in perfect squares.

Two of the front windows were broken, and at first glance all that was visible were the two thrift stores that bookend the \"restaurant\".  \n\nThe eating section looked quaint at first: clearly the original counter with lots of interesting items wreathed around it.  But upon closer look, the counter was in disrepair, trim had fallen off in places, and shelves were missing, requiring supplies and table settings to not only be displayed, but piled in a jumble on the surviving shelves in full view of customers.  Worse, the jukebox was broken which we only found out after we already wasted 2 bits.\n\nService:  terrible.  The wait staff was young and in need of training.   Our waiter didn't write down our order and had to ask 3 questions because he forgot.  Then two mistakes still were made with the order including an incorrect entree served.  There was a large table behind us our waiter also was serving and I overheard that a child's order was completely forgotten.  Dude, just write it down!  You're not ready for a big boy server gig, it's okay.\n\nFood:  deplorable.   Other reviews correctly assess the embarrassing \"hamburgers\", but the fountain drinks (we had the root beer float and Breakfast at Tiffany's ) were weak sauce (literally).  I had the Ruben with potato salad which was decent, but I was pretty hungry and would have eaten anything.  I would have preferred fries but they weren't in the menu, no deep fryer either ?\n\nOverall the ambience was that of a David lynch movie spliced with \"The Road\".

We were told it was weak because it had just been made with coffee ice cream rather than using their coffee syrup. Why? We don't know. The music wasn't 100% consistent with the theme. Part of the time it was oldies, and the other part was 80s. For our lunch, we both ordered the same thing-pastrami on rye with potato salad. The reviewers are spot-on about the potato salad, it's quite good. The sandwich was pretty good as well. After eating, we browsed the antique shop on the other side. I found it strange that the restaurant is sandwiched between two of them. Another odd thing is they were selling some clothes and old family photos along with the antiques.

How can an ice cream shop be so hot?  Looking around I don't see any air condition vents.  Don't tell me they have none?  It got a little better as I sat at the bar with fans aimed at me, but I am still in wonder at how they have lasted this long while being that hot inside!\n\nThankfully I'm just getting a root beer float.  I was offered water before it arrived.  The float's glass was nicely chilled, and I appreciated the tiny little chilled metal pitcher of extra root beer to top it off.  Ezra The ice cream had a nice strong vanilla extract flavor but was unfortunately icy (ice chunks within it).  Several of the wait staff asked me how it was as I consumed it, so I would say service is good here.\n\nI am not a fan of the big blazingly hot non-air conditioned room of clutter when you walk in.  All but two of the booths were filled, and one of those was not bussed (dirty glasses on it), so the space could definitely be reconfigured to be more profitable by putting in more seating.  I sat at the bar, the furthest away from the broiling area surrounding the windows, but ended up sitting in front of the employees' hand washing sink.  The bar top itself is some type of weird old plastic material that is fades in many areas and cracked at the edges.\n\nOverall it was a very decent float that was undoubtedly a step above Dairy Queen or A&W's soft serve version in quality.  The $6 after tax and tip price (I hadn't looked at a menu when I popped in and ordered it) was eyebrow raising though.", "business_id": "R6aazv8FB-6BeanY3ag8kw", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-08-01", "type": "review"}

While visiting Phoenix over the July 4th week, this Sonic, on the North side of E. McDowell between N. 48th and N. 51st, became my go-to drink restaurant of choice.\n\nWhat is unique about this particular Sonic is that there is a drive through, but no drive through window.  Feel free to ponder this for a moment or two.  There is a menu and a speaker where you can order whatever you like, and then you pull forward to... a solid wall on the side of the building.  No window to hand them your cash, and - most distressing of all - no window where they can hand me my humongous frosty beverage.  Well, okay, I did eventually receive my beverage as one of their servers walked out the front door and handed it to me where I tentatively pulled up to the edge of the curb.  Now, I know what you're thinking - Sonic is basically a drive up restaurant where they park and bring your food TO YOU, so why would I insist on driving through?  None of your beeswax, buster, I just do.  \n\nIn addition to driving up and parking to order, there are plenty of outdoor tables, most with shade, where you can also sit, order, and enjoy your food or beverages.\n\nSo, do whatever your little heart desires: park and sit in your car, park and sit at the tables, or order at the drive through and act really confused when you can't find the drive through window.

Applebees is typically our ideal location for nights we plan out, due to their awesome happy hour. We usually go to one particular location but on occasion we will go to this one (44st and Thomas). I've been to this location maybe 8 times. Every single time, we leave incredibly dissatisfied. The food is cold or tastes old. The drinks are always watered down.\n\nThe last time we went was a few weeks ago. My boyfriend had just got off work and wanted to have some drinks after a long day. We decided to go to Applebees, once again, for some food and drinks. Since this location was nearer, we decided to give it a shot.\n\nI ordered the nachos. Because I'm a vegetarian, I ordered it without the chili cheese sauce. How hard is it to get nachos wrong? My boyfriend ordered the two for $11.99 meal and got the blackened steak and chicken parmesan pasta. To drink, I ordered a strawberry daiquiri and he ordered a Dos Equis beer. The drinks sat at the bar for ages as we waited for the waitress to deliver it. By the time we received them, they tasted watered down- even the beer. \n\nFinally our food arrived. The nachos looked great, as did his food. However, looks can be deceiving. Everything about the nachos was disgusting. The cheese (queso blanco sauce) was cold, as if the nachos had been sitting around. The chips tasted old and stale. My boyfriend's steak was tough and very small. And the chicken pasta was cold as well.\n\nThe waitress (I believe her name was Taylor), wasn't very attentive. I don't blame her for the quality of the food, but the service could have been better. When we asked for the check (after I could only manage to eat some of the nachos) my boyfriend decided to inform her about the old taste of the chips. The waitress informed us that we needed to tell her earlier, which was understandable. She went on to explain the old taste could have come from the fact that the fresh batch of chips were just currently being fried, so my batch was most likely older, which obviously did not sit well with me. \n\nWe paid, and even tipped decently (15%), left quietly, and vowed to never ever go there again.

We both order the same meal, steak and shrimp with broccoli. My girlfriend asked to substitute the broccoli with mushrooms and add grilled onions. I want to add more shrimp to my order. Our meals arrive, mine looked fine but hers had two orders of mashed potatoes,  mushrooms and onions. Looked strange at first but whatever we went with it, we were hungry. \n\nHere is where it gets interesting. As my girlfriend was eating her mashed potatoes she feels a chewy piece in her mouth. She takes it out and it looks like a piece of toilet paper or some kind of white paper. (We had brown paper napkins only, not a single white napkin or paper on the table.) The bad part is, this was one of her last bites and didn't think of returning the food at that point. So, to not make scene we just inform our waiter about the piece of paper and advice him to let the cooks know to be more careful. He grabs our plates, grins and doesn't say a word....ok.

We ate it so whatever, we were over it and just wanted to leave.

It seems to have pretty deep roots in the community, as lots of families poured in on a Friday night. Many came for the take-out. The parking lot outside is not very big, so it can be a tad hectic with folks coming and going. Near the front door, I think we saw someone selling jewelry. Not creepy \"van guy\" jewelry, but a nice lady with her kids interacting with customers. It is not your usual scene here, and I liked that.\n\nI WISH I could have given the food more stars. But, frankly, the wings were lacking in meat. The BBQ sauce we got was ok. I did like the inferno flavor (it was more like a medium/hot level of heat). The wings themselves were mostly bone and gristle, and without amazing flavor to supplement, weren't up to par with other valley wing spots. We also ordered the deep fried zucchini, which I rather liked. But hey, I'm a sucker for deep fried *anything*.

Well the other day a friend at work brought in some wings. Me, being a crackhead for these things I tried them out & asked where they were from. You guessed it.\n\nSo tonight I ordered a dozen hot. No zucchini, no mushrooms, no pizza - just some wings. The total came out to close to 8 bucks with an extra ranch. I came home to watch the ballgame & really enjoyed them. They were the only pleasant suprise tonight as the Dbacks got their asses handed to them once more.\n\nThey come a little bit on the wet side, which I think works. I would give the sauce a solid 8 out of 10. They cook them perfectly, done all the thru. They must have made some changes since I last been here because I don't ever remember the wings being on this level. Props to you guys.\n\nI'll go back once I need another fix. Perhaps ill try one of there other sauces? One suggestion I would make to the Long Wong familia is maybe offer grilled hot wings to char up some of that sauce. Till then ill be alright with my normal crack. Maybe I'll get really wild, order TWO dozen, go on a naked rampage & eat some poor man's face. Then again...the dozen should probably do.

The sidewinder chicken sandwich is always  an excellent choice whether served as a sandwich or as an entree.  \n\n The entrees are well worth the price, at under $15 (depending on the entree).

The fried pickles had a delicious breading so i didn't mind that they weren't the true dill pickles i'm used too. The ranch for the pickles was a little runny, but tasty. The potato skins were also very tasty, and best part is there was little to no grease on top because I asked them to leave the bacon off. They were cooked to precision, not dry or over baked what so ever! They sure do know how to served a good drink too. The service was good, we didn't have to wait long for anything. There were a lot of of men due to the off track betting, so you can imagine the lack of women hanging out just for the fun of it.

The place is okay, and seems to have some serious track betting going on here. Several TV's with horse racing on, machines and some betting tickets and such. I'm not much of a better myself, so I'm not even really sure how it works at this place.\n\nAnyways, I'm kind of torn between two and three stars for this place.  For starters, the inside kind of feels dated, and its always dark when we're there. Also, we usually sit in the back when we are here, since our party size is usually between 6 and 9 people at any given time.  Someone always calls ahead from the office to let them know we're coming in, so they already have the table set up in the back for us when we arrive.\n\nMy problem is two fold with Armadillos. First, is that it the service always seems slow, and secondly, they don't seem to have a great lunch menu. It seems to be mostly dinner type dishes, that can be quite big and heavy for the middle of the day.  They have an insert to their menu with \"daily specials\" but nothing that really caters to the lunch crowd.  I mean, sometimes I want a light lunch, not a huge heavy lunch that makes me tired for the rest of the day.\n\nAlso, most of the time here it seems to take forever to get our bill, and our food. I know their busy cooking it, but being that they open at 11 AM, and when we arrive we're usually the first people to be in there (aside from a few stragglers at the bar) I wish it wouldn't take so long to get our food.  Plus, we only have an hour for lunch!  One time, it took so long to get our bill, we started getting ansy and tried to hurry out of the place. We have to be back at the office by 12:30, and we didn't get our bills until 12:30!  By the time we all got our change and cards back and left, it was after 12:45, and we didn't get back to the office until 12:50.  We were 20 minutes late back from lunch!\n\nI only go here now because once in a while the ladies from work take me, and its not half bad food.

Slightly sweet and very creamy. WOW. Serious mouthgasm. \n\nSmothered chicken - excellent gravy. I have had this one more times than I can count. Corn can be a little dry but you can always substitute a different side. \n\nFried pickles - these are spears, not slices, but the breading has great flavor and is very crisp. \n\nQuesadillas and burgers are good, fairly standard but still tasty. \n\nAll of their pastas are excellent. Can't go wrong here. \n\n\nWas not a fan of the meatloaf sandwich but the actual meatloaf dinner is well done. This sandwich is the only thing I ever ordered here that left me at all disappointed and I've probably stuffed my face with 3/4 of the stuff on the menu by now. \n\nOverall, their food has a home cooked, fresh flavor.

I will first say that the food was absolutely delicious and would bring me back, we had the fried pickles as an appetizer, they were very good , I recommend getting half cajun style and half original. For dinner I had the buffalo chicken burger, if you like buffalo chicken get this it was delicious to the end with its brioche bun. My friend got the fish tacos which was a huge serving but she thoroughly enjoyed. My conclusion on their food was big portions (I would share next time unless you want leftovers), delicious, and there was a good variety on the menu. As far as the service is concerned (I will first say that I myself am a server so I have taken into account quite a few things),our server took forever to come to get our order and when she finally did she just got the drink order then proceed to run around her section without our drinks for at least five minutes ( we all got beer so should have been fairly quick), then after she dropped those off even though we had our menus stacked to indicate readiness she left and did not return for about 10 minutes. Might I add that it was happy hour when we got there but since she did not take our full order for about 15 minutes we did not get to take advantage of it because the computers switch over automatically. Not to mention she had to keep running back and forth to ask questions, I get it there is a lot to memorize but their menu is fairly small and if you work happy hour you definitely need to know your drink menu. All in all I would return but don't go starving because it may be a while.

In fact, its location is so obscure, I honestly don't know how people stumble upon it.  Deemos is neither interesting nor original; if you do happen to find it, I can't imagine that you would go back.\n\nI, however, did go back.  Let me explain...\n\nFirst, I would like to say that I have been a Deemos patron a handful of times and only on Wednesday nights.  Why Wednesday nights, you might ask?  Well, Wednesday night is karaoke night!\n\nIt all started when a friend of mine called and asked me to go to karaoke with her and of course, I obliged.  I love to tear up a mic every now and then.  I had trouble finding the place (surprise!) and I wasn't terribly impressed when I got there.\n\nThere is a smoking patio outside, so if you're a smoker, that totally rocks.  If you're not a smoker, you may get turned off dodging smoke rings as you walk through the patio to get in the front door.  Inside, there is a U-shaped bar, some high tables, low tables and a couple of booths.  \n\nI'm pretty sure they have a menu, but I've never eaten there and I've never actually seen anyone eating there.  The drink prices aren't great but they aren't really expensive.  I know this because I am a patient person.  The bartenders are awful.  Wait.  Let me tell you what they're good at doing.  They are really good at ignoring you for an exorbitant amount of time, going outside for a 20 minute smoke break, mixing the wrong drink and treating you like they don't really work for tips.\n\nThe ONLY reason I went in the first place and the ONLY reason I went back was the karaoke.  And that's also the reason I gave a 2-star review instead of a 1-star review!\n\nNickstar Entertainment (www.nickstarkaraoke.com) runs the show at Deemos on Wednesday nights from 9pm til 1am.  They are awesome.  They have the biggest selection of songs I've ever seen in my life AND their books are organized.  Their collection is digital.  Their mics are good.  They are fun and genuinely good people.  \n\n\"Dear Nickstar, I am your biggest cheerleader.  You are the only reason Deemos is still in business.  They should thank you... and pay you extra.\"\n\nBut now I have a problem.  I won't be going to Deemos anymore.  Unfortunately, Nickstar is having a censorship problem due to poor management (surprise) and a group of people who have apparently complained about being offended by some of the performances, namely those that incorporate the use of curse words.  \n\nHmmm...  Bar + Drunk People = F-Bombs.  Isn't that a standard people have come to expect?  I can't imagine someone being offended by a couple of curse words IN A BAR.  But apparently, it's become a problem for some and a disappointment to others who enjoy flexing their 1st amendment rights (and their wicked ability to rock a mic).\n\nHonestly, I can't believe that Deemos would sell out like that.  Wait, actually it really doesn't surprise me that much.  The only thing I'm disappointed about is missing out on some great karaoke, but I can catch Nickstar in Tempe (and I will!).\n\nDeemos American Grill, I will never visit your establishment again and I won't miss it.

Great looking place. \n\nhad a seat in a big fat booth and server Kelly was over in a flash to greet us and asking what we would like to drink. I thought it was great how she explained in detail that all the juice drinks are made from fresh to order from freshly squeezed juices- WOW Are you kidding me?!?! My wife ordered a fresh squeezed lemonade and it was awesome she said. I told Kelly I wanted a glass of white wine and unlike seemi9ngly most servers these days, she guided me through the labyrinth of wines to exactly what was going to turn me on. That was artful service and it didn't stop there either.  \n\nWe asked her for some appetizer selections and she explained many in great detail. We selected the Spinach and Artichoke Dip with Crostinis that was really very good - rich and creamy with large pieces of spinach (I hate when they are all diced). I ordered 4 oysters on teh half shell. Kelly brought them to the table and pointed and explained each oyster and wher it was originated: malpeque Oyster, Blue Point Oyster, Hama Hama Toyer, Gold Creek oyster. My favorite was the Blue Point. They were served with cocktail sauce and horseradish traditionally; however, it also came with if I can recall correctly was a Chardonnay infused oil or something that was outstanding to pare with the oysters. \n\nMy wife has Chicken Alfredo pasta - yea she did. A bountiful splendor of  treasures form the grotto of the sea and she orders chicken. Each there own I guess but I'm not going to expand on her selection - it was chicken. \n\nThis menu was so thick with things for me to order I just couldn't decide so I asked my server Kelly to choose for me and she hit it right on the mark with the Albacore Tuna sesame crusted with a Thai Chiki sauce. Outstanding hunk of fish and cooked absolutely perfectly - BRAVO! It was served with a nice Juliane of vegetables. My only issue here was the unsuspected slice of ginger hidden in there that I unsuspected ate and really hate. \n\nGreat experience and outstanding service - top notch and remarkably affordable. There was so much to choose from and our server also explained that the menu changes TWICE a day - yes TWICE a day. Only thing I was out of the ordinary was a \"10 UNDER $10 SPECIALS\" list I guess for the penny pinching pamelas in the crowd - really seems your selling yourselves short there at the price point with  this quality, location, product and ambiance.", "business_id": "MU3i2uEyUBntebU6pEyMbw", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-07-07", "type": "review"}

Second of all, I am not a $30,000 millionaire, nor do I pretend to be one. I don't have a lot of money to splurge or waste, and most of my meals out (for my boyfriend and I) are rarely more than $30. Having said that, I was so pleased with the value here! We decided to skip Valentine's Day, and went for a \"flashy\" dinner on a Tuesday evening. I had a 20% off coupon, so we felt comfortable going all out. We started with oysters on the half shell, they had a mix platter so you could sample all 6 of the various types of oyster they had in house that day. Delish! Next, we ordered lobster bisque and wedge salads, two of my favorites and they were amazing. Next, came our main courses: surf and turf for me and shrimp scampi for him. Both were amazing. My filet was cooked to perfection - I asked for medium-rare and, what a concept, they served it medium-rare! It sounds like an easy \"duh\", but for some reason chefs in the valley are afraid to serve anything with pink!\nEverything was great, though, services was a little slow, but, I assume that has to do with the old-school vibe of the place, dark booths, lots of gray hair, and an old-school attention to detail and the thought that dining should be an experience enjoyed throughout the evening, not 50 minute race for the check.  \nThe next time I am in the mood for a \"splurge\", McCormick & Schmicks will definitely be on the top of my list!", "business_id": "MU3i2uEyUBntebU6pEyMbw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-06-29", "type": "review"}

Whenever I get a good waitress, the experience is excellent along with the food. The problem is that having a good waitress isn't something I can count on. The most recent experience I had was with a waitress named Courtney. She was very direct and wasn't pleasant at all. I ordered a soup with the edges of the bowl near the soup being dirty. I gave the soup back and she didn't apologize. Then she returns with a a new soup but in a much smaller bowl (it was still a little dirty). It was disappointing. The rest of my lunch was very uncomfortable and unenjoyable afterwards. \n\nI'm tired of coming here and having bad experiences like this. I will not be coming anymore because I can easily go to other restaurants and get the full package of excellent service and great food ALL the time. This service is too inconsistent.

She is going to be 86 this year and has been having a bunch of health problems so when I told her I would be coming to town, she asked if I would take her to see her financial planner who works in this area. He is great and often drives all the way to Sun City West to see her or they conduct business over the phone and email. Since it is schlep for my mom to do this, I was happy to take her. We had an appointment around 1:15 and since Gram moves a bit slower than either of us expected, our plan to have lunch before the appointment didn't work out so we had lunch afterward.

I know now that I like their burgers and I love their garden salad. It is full of great veggies like shredded zuchini and beets. Gram had the meatloaf and ate about 3/4 and then decided it wasn't as good as it used to be. I refused to let her send it back (one of her favorite things to do-eat more than half and then complain so she gets either a comped meal or another meal that she takes home for another time)-yes,I am outing her trick and she knows I am on to her....\n\nShe let me pay because I didn't let her send her food back. Luckily and our waitress was a doll who totally got it. She was from San Jose so we had a good time chatting about the Bay Area and the differences between here and there. \n\nThe reason why I am not giving this location 4 stars is because the slice of cheesecake we ordered had some nasty strawberries on it. I have a good taster and when I bit into one it was like biting into an overly acidic chemical taste. I told the waitress and she brought us a plain slice. The waitress told the manager who came over to tell me that NO ONE had ever complained about the strawberries before. I told him to taste one and he looked at me like I was crazy. A few minutes later, our waitress came to me to tell me that the manager did taste the strawberries and that I was right -DUH.

Not!  Not!  So ssaaad.\n\nI must have set expectations too high, because I was not impressed.  My naked cheesecake tasted like it was thinned out.

If I was in his position, knowing he was serving someone on his birthday, I would have at least comped the cheese cakes...I really didn't want to be that person that screams over their meal, but I thought for being so nice about everything, he would try to do some kind of a discount on our meal, and not some \"free soup\" that we didn't order in the first place.\n\nI am embarrassed because this was my boyfriend's birthday dinner. He definitely doesn't want to go again.\n\nAgain, I realize people make mistakes, but it would have been nice to get some type of discount, especially for taking it so well. Our gratuity wasn't so nice, because of it.\n\n:-(", "business_id": "2r8jGeuYvMkyP2ik_X-Bxw", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-08-17", "type": "review"}

The food cooked by Julio is wonderful.  The wings are the best in town.  They are fried then tossed in mild, honey, fire or a few other sauces and then fried again.  They are they best wings.  I saw that others posted that they seem smaller but, that could be because you are getting a wing that is really crispy.  They aren't cooked a bit then drenched in a sauce then put on a plate. Yuk!  They are given a quick drench in the frier and crispy.  Bravo Julio.  The waitress' are wonderful.  Be careful because as \"Ron White\" say, \"I have been over served\".  They have cabs waiting and I since I drive by in the mornings I have to laugh but feel relieved that there are cars in the parking lot and the \"over served\" took a cab.  On Saturday's they have the best Prime Rib in town and for under $17.  you get the Prime Rib, salad and a baked potato.  I also love the tacos special.  I thought it was taco Tuesday but maybe it's Taco Thursday.  Great special.  Now I must say that it's a old neighborhood bar in a old little strip mall.  Growing up down the road since the 60's I saw how the bar used to be.  It was where the men and \"drunks\" would go to drink.  I always say that it was my friends and I that changed the place.  My husband would go there with some friends and slowly slowly I would go.  I would be dressed up and feel very out of place.  Eventually about three years later I saw the change that I fell we instigated in about 2005.  It is now a tavern that you can take your girl to, if they are open to a \"tavern\".  I will warn you that because it is in a little strip joint they can have some plumbing issues and sometimes you may get a septic fume.  I just say \"oh well that's JT's\".  The people, service, drinks and cost are worth it.  I like the low lights and the mini Christmas lights strung and all the old memorabilia and hundreds of patron photos on the wall.  It will always be a bar where I know I can go in, sit at the bar and start up a conversation and have a great time.

However, I have to qualify that by stating that both times have been with large (large = ~300 people) groups. And I haven't paid a dime out of my pocket either time. And I was driven back to the hotel on a small bus, with a cold drink in my hand. Which would probably make for a nice experience at just about any restaurant. \n\nThat said, this place is great for private events with a lot of people. Lots of patio space for pre-dinner drinks and appetizers while everyone soaks in the view. Yeah, it can get hot out there, even in the early evening, but if you're fortunate enough to have a breeze blowing, it's not too bad. And after dinner, when the sun is long gone, and you're enjoying a drink with the city lights twinkling before you, it's pretty damn cool (literally and figuratively).\n\nI've had both the filet and fish, and neither has disappointed, although I will say that the prosciutto glazed sablefish I had last time really had no evidence of prosciutto having been involved (which, of course, was the only reason I chose that dish. Prosciutto = bacon = yum). Disappointing. But the fish itself was cooked well and flavorful. The filet is excellent, although they did have some trouble getting the right done-ness out to everyone. No problems with taking it back and getting it right, though.\n\nI think the cost of their regular menu is about  $40-50 per entree, and with that in mind, I'd say this would be a better spot for drinks and a couple of appetizers, or even after dinner drinks. I don't think I'd be too pleased with dropping $150 for dinner and drinks based on the food I've had. Yeah, it was good...but not particularly memorable, and for that amount of money, I'd probably want to go with a Ruth's Chris or Flemings, or a similar high end steakhouse.\n\nBut hey...if the view and ambiance are what you're after, you'll definitely get that here, and plenty of it.

Larry made the dinner and celebration very Special. My husband ordered the Rib Eye but my husband doesn't like any thing on his rib eye and doesn't like anything else on his plate with the meat.. Larry must hears this all the time and he explained exactly how it will be plated and assured him that no sauce or veggies would touch the meat. See pictures to see our meals.

The bread and the specialty butter and pesto and goat cheese dips were also full of flavor... \n\nThe dessert was a Chocolate Espresso cake also very good.

No problem, we understand - what we DIDN'T understand was why, when he returned, he still couldn't tell us a stinkin' thing about the 5-course tasting menu - he literally named only 3 or 4 of the ingredients for a few of the courses, and then said \"Uh, I can't tell you anything more, I know know how anything is prepared.\"  When I inquired what the \"salad\" was comprised of, he he said \"some lettuce.\"  Gee, thanks for the detail.  Finally, the food was really salty!  I'd seriously give this place 0 stars if that were possible.

I understand its an experience but waiting 1 hour for a table when you have reservations is absolutely unprofessional especially for a half empty restaurant. When we finally were about to be seated the hostess asked me to take off my hat. I looked around there were people in shorts and T-shirts and I can't wear a hat. Already upset by the poor first impression I walked out before I was seated. The staff I encountered were rude and arrogant. Terrible experience and I will never go back.", "business_id": "3Zsjlum5kl5N5KV712aTMQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-06-01", "type": "review"}

The best time of year because we can have an amazing meal and not break the bank. \n\nDPofV is the best choice. It has it all, ambiance, view, awesome food, the best wine list anywhere, and a wonderful staff. \n\n1. The view is something you can only understand by seeing it. Looking out over the city, down town Phx, it's perfect. Get there in time to see it right at sundown then late int he even to see the lights. With the hot Phx air it looks like the lights are dancing. \n\n2. The food, wow the food! We had the blue crab salad, spare rib ravioli, hanger steak and pork loin chop. All awesome! The blue crab is as good as you can get in this part of the country (far from the coast)! They were very accommodating to Jon's mushroom allergy. His hanger steak was so tasty and my pork was like butter. And brusstle sprouts, umm hello my fave!!! \n\n3. The wine list literally is the best world. It is like 45 pages long. A bit on the excessive side for me, but I was beyond please with the Cab we picked out. \n\n4. The staff: I think the fact that the two people we had the pleasure of meeting had both been there over 15 years speaks volumes of the place. It is obviously a great job to have, they had a great attitude, and performed perfectly. \n\n5. Last but certainly not least, the desserts. Wow! We each ordered the Creme Brule, and somehow when dessert arrived we got \"bonus\" deserts. The chocolate turtle and their sorbet were wonderful, completely over shadowing the creme brule. \n\nWe were both in heaven when we left and almost needed to be wheeled out since we were so full!

This year, we were led to A Different Pointe of View. Everything was special and delicious, just as one would hope for a celebratory occasion. A welcome surprise was the service provided by Luis. He gave the right amount of suggestions for courses, wine and timing - all with a sense of humor one would not expect from such a fine restaurant. (At one point, he compared himself to Cesar Milan.) We shared the Short Ribs Ravioli and Steamed Cedar Creek Clams as 2 courses, at Luis's suggestion. It felt so European! My husband savored the Coffee Brown Sugar Seared Pork Tenderloin, while I especially enjoyed Luis's suggestion of Grilled Cedar River Marinated Hanger Steak. The both proteins were some of the most tender I've ever tasted. The hanger steak was a thin serving and the perfect portion. To end, we chose a Midnight Espresso Cup, but Luis also brought us the creme brulee, too. As he said, \"You can't come to the Pointe and miss out on the creme brulee.\" He was SO right. I hate dessert and it made me never want to say no to a dessert again. One thing to remember is to prepare for a long service. Food like this is worth it.

We went on Saturday night at sunset and can definitely say the view was beautiful and it was very nice inside. \n\nUnfortunately, the service was very slow, but the waiters were friendly and polite.  We ordered the blue crab salad, which was very small with about 12 cucumber slices arranged on the plate and a few pinches of crab and bitter greens. There definitely should have been more crab for the price.  \n\nI then tried the shrimp appetizer with Quinoa.  The two shrimp that came were delicious, but only two medium to large sized shrimp was not quite what I was expecting and the Quinoa sauce/seasoning was not great.  No one at our table cared for the taste.\n\nI do have to say the visual appearance was top notch, but flavor combination and portion size left much to be desired.\n\nAfter $25.00 of appetizers, I decided to try the lobster with black truffles.  Unfortunately the lobster was luke warm and also very dry.  No butter anywhere (a small cup or drizzle of clarified butter would have been a game changer) and the ravioli that the lobster was placed on top of, was also dry outside and inside with no sauce.  The black truffles were nice, but were of course dry as well, making the dinner unenjoyable overall.  Some type of liquid with lobster, ravioli or black truffles really brings out their flavor. \n\nMy wife also had the same dinner and this is the first time she hasn't finished her lobster.  She also said it was dry, and sadly left most of it on her plate.  \n\nMy mom and her significant other both ordered the chicken, and unfortunately only took a couple of bites and said the seasoning was awful and left their entire meals.  They also left early since they didn't like the food and didn't want to try dessert.\n\nThere were other people at the table that ate their meals, did enjoy parts of them, but this restaurant appears to be concerned with presentation first but needs to work on flavor, portion size (doesn't need to be large, just an extra pinch of crab or four shrimp when you order shrimp, etc.).\n\nNo one at our table thoroughly enjoyed their meals, so $600.00 later, we realized this is a place we can't justify coming back to, unless we are invited as guests.", "business_id": "3Zsjlum5kl5N5KV712aTMQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-06-21", "type": "review"}

The salad was salty and overdressed, also mushy. The salad is called an heirloom tomato salad, but the paper thin slices are nearly tasteless (except for the salty dressing sprinkled over).

My filet was cooked to temperature and the horseradish sauce and white bean puree that accompanied the dish were delightful.  Every bite melted in my mouth.  My husband's dish was also splendid and cooked to perfection.  We had the \"turtle\" dessert that was on the sweet side, which I love so it was a nice mix of mousse and chocolate crunch.

Up one flight of stairs and you'll find yourself in the bar. Up one more flight of stairs and you'll find the restaurant.\n\nD\u00e9cor is classy, but a little dated. Of course, not many people will be looking at the furniture when they see the view. A floor to ceiling glass window facing south, with downtown Phoenix in the distance. We were lucky enough to get one of the tables by the window as we had an earlier reservation (6:30) in order to see the sunset. There is a patio outside which would be a great location to sit and watch the sun go down, if only it wasn't 110 outside!\n\nThe wine list is very good, and expansive. There seems to be something for everyone, from multiple thousand dollar bottles of Premier Cru Bordeauxs to more affordable domestic wines. The only comment I would make is that there wasn't as much variety in the by-the-glass selection.\n\nIn addition the the regular menu, they offer a three course prix fixe deal for $40  - select the options that are printed in red and the selections were surprisingly good. The second prix fixe option is the Chef's choice seven course meal for $79pp with the option to add a wine pairing for an additional $29pp. The table next to ours had the Chef's choice and it seemed to be a great deal. We weren't that hungry and the OH wasn't drinking, so we chose the 3-course menu.\n\nFor apps the OH ordered the watermelon salad, which was good, but a little boring. A slice of seared watermelon and some mustard greens or rape. I ordered the lobster bisque and thought it was excellent, but would have liked to have seen some lobster meat instead of everything being pur\u00e9ed. It had a great flavour.\n\nFor entr\u00e9es I had the daily addition, which tonight was Beef Short Ribs - delectable, melt in your mouth, amazing. She ordered the Trout which was perfectly cooked and served on a bed of shrimp and enoki mushrooms.\n\nDessert was Classic Tahitian Vanilla Bean Cr\u00e8me Brulee and Chocolate Turtle. They were both good, but the cr\u00e8me brulee was in a league of it's own. You can see why it is their signature dessert!\n\nService was very good and my water glass was never close to empty. Luis was our server and he told us he had worked there for 11 years, he said there were other servers who had worked there for much longer. His service was very professional, although a little pandering at times.\n\nSummary - This is a great place for a date night.

Most of the food and Service I had was very good. This would be a Four star review if a few execution problems didn't occur. I am basing my rating on price point.\n\nBoth entrees were less than warm especially the New York Strip. I don't order steak often but when I do I look forward to a very good steak that's tender, tasty and hot like off the grill.  My husband thought the steak was cold but I say it was room temperature. I didn't send it back or say anything because it was tasty and cooked nicely and I didn't want it cooked more and I also didn't want my husband's Pork to sit more. My waiter did come to check on us and asked how it tasted and I said fine because it did taste fine.\n\nAt this point I was teetering between three and four stars.\n\nBut another execution problem occurred with the Chiffon Date Cake. The cake is made ahead of time and kept chilled in a refrigerator. I am certain that freshly made the Pistachio Cream is delicious but after chilling it just turned into hard putty that you can't eat. Other issues with this dessert are I didn't recognize anything in the Chiffon Date Cake as Dates. I don't know if the cake had dates in it. I don't know if I got the wrong one either.  I tasted the cake and to be honest it tasted like a dry sorta sponge cake. I do note the coconut lime saffron sorbet was delicious and I used that to soak and moisten up the dry sponge of cake. I did question the waiter about the cake and he assured me I had the correct one. He also said the pastry chef was on vacation.\n\nEven with the Summer Menu Pricing I feel three stars is an accurate rating for the execution of the steak and dessert in an upscale place.\n\nPossibly a slightly off night.", "business_id": "3Zsjlum5kl5N5KV712aTMQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-08-17", "type": "review"}

The restaurant was offering a \"summer prix fix\" menu that allowed you to get an appetizer, an entry, and a dessert for only $40. We decided to do that but wanted to share an appetizer before. I guess our server didn't understand us, and brought us two appetizers instead and after we explained the error he still charged us. The experience and food was great but I think the servers could be friendlier.

When we finally did get there, we had a hard time figuring out how to get to the restaurant, as there is a section for parties/etc. The main dining area is at the top of the stairs. They were very accommodating of our lateness due to this, and we still got the table that we had reserved.\n\nThis is an expensive, up-scale restaurant. While they don't seem to have a dress code that you MUST follow (I saw a few people who were more on the casual side of dressy casual), I would recommend dressy casual and above for this restaurant. While the atmosphere is classy, the waiters do not seem like snobs of any sort. They are very professional, courteous, and happy to answer any questions. \n\nI recommend booking in advance with a note for window or patio seating (your preference), and arriving right before sunset hours for the best views and experience. \n\nThe food is amazing.

I had planned to meet a couple of friends and watch a rare ASU baseball broadcast on national TV.  I arrive first, and have to practically beg to have the game put on one of the many TVs present.

So then I asked if I could actually listen to the game, too?  No such luck.  Did I mention this was the home-town ASU baseball team, nationally ranked, fighting for their post-season?  And a sports bar opts to play 80's hits, instead?  I quickly called BS on that, and as soon as the rest of my party arrived, we left.

They were training a new server, who was from New York, so she came replete with a touch of attitude, and not enough training.  Thankfully, middle management saved the day!  The question was whether the nachos (do NOT order, by the way, they're borderline inedible, but then i don't particularly like nachos under the best of circumstances) contain beans, even if you order them with chicken instead of refried beans on top.  Somehow, someway, we got confused and assumed they did.  Our server, upon being complained at, simply walked away without a word.  Needless to say, there were comments made at our table.  That's when middle management stepped in.  He explained that it's an either-or proposition, enlightening us.  He then went above and beyond, bringing us a cup of the delicious refried beans (which I tried despite my distaste for the whole nacho thing and found to be completely and totally 100% awesome).  Thank you, sir!  At some point, I ordered a burger, which I wholeheartedly enjoyed.  It's enjoying me right now, quite enthusiastically, I might note.  *gurgle*\n\nAnyway, I don't have a great feeling about this place's future in my repertoire of places to drink.  If the unsung hero isn't there to help you out, the service will not be good.  No attitude, per se, just poor service, which is possibly more unforgivable in my book.  The perfect storm is poor service with attitude, but for that you gotta go to Pomeroy's (can we go back there again soon so I can find justification to SLAM that place in my update? please?)  The environment is typical sports bar, with a moderately clean bathroom (thank you again, unsung hero!).  The food is very uneven, even for a sports bar.  Those fries should not be heavily salted.  I don't care who likes them that way, I will not eat them covered in salt.  I will not eat them with a malt.  I do not like them, not one bit!\n\nAnyway, I don't have any particularly hostile feelings towards this place.  My burger was good, the beer selection was decent and the prices were (in theory, at least) great.  Give that floor manager a fancy set of whip and chains and...  I dunno, redecorate?  somehow import some atmosphere someway, i don't know or care how, and this place will get more stars.  I should note that I am quite sure they messed up my check.  The beers were supposed to each be $4, in fact I carefully ensured that each beer I ordered (ok, that might be a total lie) was a $4 beer, and yet my bill came to $26.  I only had three, plus a nine-dollar burger.  I don't think they were trying to rip me off, but as a cheap person, I find this slightly offensive.  Granted, I'm partially to blame for not, I dunno, reading the bill when I got it?  anyway, I'll forgive you, this time, Gallagher's, but you're on my watch list.

I ordered the barbeque-bacon turkey burger, and it literally took an hour to come out! It did not look appealing and so I spoke with the manager, who was not very customer service driven.  Strike 2\n\nWhen we were served our food, the silverware did not come along with it as well.  Strike 3\nSince, I have worked in the restaurant industry and I wrote food and wine reviews and blogs, I know what is supposed to happy when a client is not happy with the service, or the food.  Apparently the manager did not know, he then took the food away and said that he would take it off of the bill.  He was supposed to leave the food, let me finally eat it, and then still take it off of the bill.  My friend had to go and hunt him down with my food and so he brought it back out.  But, I was so annoyed that I left it sitting right there, to prove a point that I was not that hungry to eat their trash food after waiting an hour and then having it taken away!!!\n\nThe waitress was frazzled, the manager was incompetent, and the sound system was horrible for karaoke.  They need to close down, re-train everyone, and hire more staff!!", "business_id": "F-ykHfGY9lWr12OJ_Ofy7A", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-07-29", "type": "review"}

We missed dinner due to the time of our flight and were starving.\n\nSince we hadn't rented a vehicle, we searched Yelp for places within walking distance that were open late. Two nearby options turned up: a tex-mex place down the street and Gallaghers.  We tried the tex-mex place first (Aunt Chiladas; reviewed separately).  Despite that location's restaurant's website stating it was open until 2am, we were dismayed to find out that they only serve alcohol after 10pm. We asked the bartender about Gallaghers (and any other nearby alternatives) and he told us to avoid Gallaghers like the plague.  Funny--our cabbie from the airport said the place was greasy but a local favorite.\n\nWe decided to risk it...and I'm glad we did.  Gallagher's has a dining room separate from the bar.  We arrived around 10:30pm, and there were two other groups enjoying meals. The dining room was dimly lit and felt like it belonged in a cold Midwest metropolis--kinda like a Chicago/Detroit version of Cheers.  The bar (which we never visited) sounded busy and happy with loud music that battled with the dining room's music to make a pleasant cacophony of white noise.  We were exhausted, and the seats were comfy...the hostess was VERY attentive (but not pushy), and instantly brought us large fresh glasses of water. \n\nAs for the food.  We ordered the appetizer platter (fried mushrooms, zucchini, onion rings and mozzarella sticks). It was wonderful, plentiful, not too greasy (despite being all fried food), and piping hot with crispy fried batters. My husband ordered the cheeseburger. He loved it.  I felt yucky from my half day of traveling, so I ordered a small spinach salad. The salad could have been wonderful, with thinly sliced sweet red onions, crispy bacon pieces, mushrooms, almond slivers, and an oriental dressing on the side. Unfortunately, the spinach was beyond dry, and did not seem like it had been washed.  The mushrooms looked like they had been picked from the grocer's bin and chopped without inspection, washing, or even wiping with a wet cloth.  I swear I could see bits of the manure on a few slices.  As I dug below the surface of the salad, I identified several spinach leaves which were close to a gelatinous state. \n\nIn short--the service was great, the grilled/fried food is wonderful, the atmosphere is comfortable and inviting. Will definitely go again..maybe try their pizza or wings.  \n\nI learned two things--never order a salad from a bar (unless it is a salad bar), and always trust a cabbie's opinion over that of a competing bartender.", "business_id": "F-ykHfGY9lWr12OJ_Ofy7A", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-08-15", "type": "review"}

I heard about this place as a decent dive in town, and it was just down the lot from me.  \n\nI walked in and saw what looked like a pretty decent place.  It was a slow night for a weekend, so I went to the bar and stationed a bar stool.  The bartender did the usual \"Hi, what can I get you.\" \n\nI had a country fried steak and a beer.  For 12 dollars, it was a decent meal, and I was happy I ordered it.  Cheap eats and decent booze..\n\nA weekend later I came back.  This time there was two bartenders and the bar was full, so I took a seat at one of the booths.  I sat for about  ten minutes waiting.  One of the kitchen guys saw that I hadn't been helped and showed up with a menu and asked me what I wanted to drink.  \n\nI was thankful he helped me.  I ordered a water and a kiltlifter, a Phoenix microbrew.  He told the bartender that had ignored me up until that point that I was indeed there and had intent to be a paying customer.  She showed up with my Kiltlifter and asked if I wanted to eat something, of which I did order the country fried steak off the night menu again.  I reminded her I wanted a water too.  \n\nSo I get my food. Still no water.  I ask for it again. She said sure.  Ate my food, then got my tab.  Still no water.\n\nFirst experience: Good.  Second experience: Not so good.\n\nI would recommend this place for a good bite to eat, but don't expect to be able to rehydrate here...

To celebrate my husband's birthday with friends, we wanted to end the night at out friend's hookah lounge. So I scoured Yelp for a nearby place for food & drinks to start the night off. We came on a Saturday evening, around 5, to take advantage of happy hour. We had quite a group and our waitress was very accommodating. Our bill was split so many different ways and it was a pleasant surprise that they didn't tack on a mandatory gratuity. Service was quite slow, though.\n\nI was pleased with the food and drinks. And the happy hour prices were great. I even think we were charged HH prices for a few drinks past 7pm. The wings were good and the burgers were tasty, but what really impressed me was the sweet potato fries. They were incredibly awesome and I would return just for them! \n\nThey had live music, but it wasn't that great. The first act, a solo woman, did not entertain at all. She had quite a few spectators, friends I'm guessing, but had a very monotonous voice and all the songs sounded the same. I didn't mind that she was there, but if the music wasn't played so loud, it would have been better. The second act, a small group, was much better, much livelier.\n\nCasey Jones has a couple pool tables, video games, darts, and an air hockey table. After eating, we migrated to that area and got to horse around a bit. For a Saturday night, it wasn't too busy. There isn't much parking in the front, but I think there is more around back.

I love it.\n\nHot damn, it was warm this morning, but not enough to make a difference on a 5-star place like The Farm at South Mountain.  I was in a rush to try this place out this weekend before it closed.  (FYI, it closes every summer from June - September.)\n\nYou pull up to the place in the midst of this vast city of ours to find a huge, and shady (in a good way) farm before you.  At the Morning Glory Cafe, the small menu has just the right mix of items to please just about anyone.  Lots of veggie options to be had here, btw (Bonnie would DROOL with desire here).\n\nThe food is really incredible.  They had my favorite dish on the menu - croque madame.  It had eggs, and some delicious asiago cheese and black forest ham on some crusty artisanal bread.  Ahh.  It was missing the bechamel sauce, but it made up for it with freshly-grown asparagus.  How did they know that's my favorite veggie?  I attribute it to kismet, of course.  It was accompanied by some terrific oven roasted potatoes baked in some spices and oil.  Nice...\n\nThe patio is cute in a rustic way.  Think checker tablecloths and white plastic chairs.  Not exactly sexy, but hey, it fits in the grand scheme of the farm.  They have a self serve area for water, lemonade and tea.  \n\nThe mimosas here are the best part.  For only $7.50 you get your own mini champagne bottle and orange juice.  So you're getting the better end of the bargain with about a mimosa and a half! \n\nService here was a bit slow to start.  But after paying the check I spot a wandering blueberry scone that is calling my name.  (Even better, is their scones are featured in Cooking Light magazine too.  Man I love this place.) So I give in, place an order and ask for it to go.  She brings it out.  I ask to pay in cash, since she already ran my debit card, and she says \"Don't worry about it.\"  \n\nCLASSY.  Classy, with a C.  The scone was DELICIOUS, btw.  Nice touch, and I leave her an extra tip for it. \n\nPrices are higher than average for Phoenix.  Expect to throw down about $40 for two.  But let me tell ya, that will be the best $40 you've spent in a while. \n\nI am now eager to try the other restaurants here.

As other reviewers have said, the sandwiches and salads from here are above average in price and just barely above average in taste and flavor. That being said, I think that some of their sandwiches are great ideas and actually have quite fresh ingredients. I love a chicken salad sandwich that actually has chuncks of chicken in it and not just a trace of what could have at one time been chicken. The best part of the meal could possibly be the little baskets that they put your food in. But, like I said, they food isn't bad, but its not spectacular for the price you pay. \n\nI highly recommend this restaurant that is so much more than a restaurant.

Being from the northeast and him from the Midwest, we feel starved for green grass, deciduous trees and rustic, wooden fences. The Farm really delivers those wonderful feelings of reconnecting with nature and socializing in an outdoor setting that doesn't feature poured concrete flower beds and overly watered tropical plants. \n\nFor wedding reception/ceremony: We used Mike Kennedy, the nondenominational officiant The Farm recommended for our ceremony, he was excellent. The staff at the Farm as well as Santa Barbara Catering (You must use them to be married here) were outstanding! Our guests said it was the best food they have ever eaten at a wedding, which is a huge compliment. We choose the grove (under the white tent in the pecan grove) for our reception (they have a few other locations to pick from depending on location on the property) and our ceremony was under the large wooden, vine covered arbor - perfection! As wedding prices go, it was definitely reasonable - no idea why the world thinks that in order to have a lovely wedding you need to drop oodles of loot - the Farm is a great option for nature lovers, people missing trees, grass etc, great food, amazing service and a memorable location for their wedding (it was actually less expensive than 90% of the hotel/buffet options out there)\n\nFood: there are three dining options at The Farm, Quiescence (fancy, high end dining) Morning Glory Cafe (breakfast/brunch), The Farm Kitchen - (lunch) I could write a novel here, but overall: the food is a little expensive (lunch is usually $10-$15/person with drinks or if you want desert tack on an additional $3-5 bucks) but it is very good, plus you get the great ambiance of dining under trees on a picnic table or in their little courtyard area. If it's busy prepare to wait awhile to order  and get your food (self serve, you gotta pick it up at the window when they call your number)\n\n For breakfast/brunch at Morning Glory expect similar pricing, but this is located towards the back of the property in a cozy little brick patio area - simple waiter service.", "business_id": "MLcXtnpzygZvQ9BtseLLlw", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-06-24", "type": "review"}

I hadn't been by in a few weeks because I've been busy, and when I went in yesterday, I was surprised to find that they had a new breakfast menu. The old breakfast menu was composed of breakfast classics: three-egg omelets, pancakes, a breakfast burrito, huevos rancheros, etc-- it was tried and true, I never had a problem finding something that I wanted to eat, and at about $6.95 per entree, I couldn't go wrong. Well, the new breakfast menu is nothing like that. I had trouble finding something that I actually WANTED to eat. Instead of three-egg omelets for $6.95, they now have one and a half or two egg frittatas for $7.95-- so they raised the prices and you're now getting even less food for the money. Also, some of the dishes on the new breakfast menu just sound straight up disgusting. Puff pastry, eggs, and marinara for breakfast? No thank you. Unfortunately, it looks like I will have to find a new breakfast joint.", "business_id": "SgTjnyElc26gPUghVuCuSQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-06-18", "type": "review"}

It was an early dinner, and the establishment was not at all busy. We were seated promptly. While being seated, we walked past several chalkboards which showcased their special beers (which looked VERY inviting), and specials of the day with regard to lunch and dinner.\n\nI commend this restaurant for striving to be healthy, especially considering this is a brew house and not a \"artsy\" restaurant. Their menu offers selections which can be made in a lighter version to accommodate special diets. I had a couple of questions regarding ingredients in their dishes and how their \"light\" versions differed from regular versions. Our waitress politely said she wasn't sure (which I prefer over a lie), and she excused herself to find out the answer. She returned with answers and we proceeded to order.\n\nWe both ended up ordering the half chicken, but the sides we ordered I do not remember.\n\nA few minutes later someone came back to our table (don't remember if it was the waitress or the manager), and told us that they only had one half chicken left. We would have understood if we had come later and the place was packed, but we were early, and the dinner menu had started not too long ago.\n\nOkay, fine, I had another entree choice in mind. I spent another minute looking over the menu, and ordered a different chicken entree with 2 sides; one of which was steamed broccoli.\n\nOur dishes arrived. The one half chicken we ordered was decent (the sides were nothing special), but there was issue with the chicken dish I received. A few pieces of the broccoli were literally ice cold and not cooked. We quickly informed the waitress, and she said they would make a new batch. The new batch came out a while later, and although it was not cold anymore, it was undercooked. Suffice it to say that I did not finish the side of broccoli.\n\nTowards the end of the meal the manager came to our table and apologized about the meal, and offered us a dessert on the house.\n\nOverall the customer service was fantastic, the environment was casual, and we also noticed they had plenty of quiet outdoor seating that did not face a loud street.\n\nHowever, given the fact that they ran out of a main entree at the beginning of dinner service and were unable to properly cook steamed broccoli, I had to give it a 3-star (A-OK) review.", "business_id": "SgTjnyElc26gPUghVuCuSQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-08-19", "type": "review"}

I couldn't decide whether I wanted breakfast or lunch but eventually decided to allow myself a carb-filled lunch. \n\nI ordered the strawberry lemonade and fried zucchini to start. The lemonade was sugary goodness! The zucchini were fresh and hot and we read they were hand breaded. They came with a side of ranch and a side of marinara. They were well liked at our table.\n\nFor lunch, I ordered the pot roast sandwich with fries. Friend 1 ordered a salad with fresh fruit and chicken breast with a cup of corn chowder. Friend 2 had a chicken parm sandwich on ciabatta bread.\n\nFriend 1's salad came with a fresh baked muffin of her choice. She chose carrot cake. When all of our food arrived, Friend 2 ordered a muffin for fear of stealing an unapproved bite of Friend 1's muffin!\n\nMy food looked SO good when it arrived. I took a BIG bite of my pot roast sandwich. Booo.... SO BLAND! No seasoning whatsoever. What did they cook their roast in? Water? Just plain water? After doctoring my sandwich with creamed horseradish and salt, it was passable. The meat was tender and warm, but that's all it had going for it. It came on a thick sourdough bun which was good, but I ended up taking most of the bun off to just eat the meat, lettuce and tomato. The french fries were crispy and hot and the ranch I dipped them in was good! I'm very picky about my ranch.\n\nFriend 1's meal was \"eh...ok.\" She said the chicken and fruit was supposed to be on the side and not all cubed up. The corn chowder she got with her meal was tasteless. She said she didn't even taste the corn.\n\nFriend 2's meal was \"Decent\" he said that he was starving so he just wolfed it down, but his favorite part was the fries, not the sandwich.\n\nWe suspect, due to the \"older\" crowd we were surrounded by, that the lack of seasoning and the cubed bites of fruit were for their sake. \n\nWill we visit Mimi's again?

They have a pretty good salad, if you're ever in an no-grease mood while at Waffle House. lol\n\nTrust me and try the biscuits and gravy (gluttony) or plain grilled chicken sandwich (healthier)... they delish!\n\nGood people watching.\n\nSee ya there!", "business_id": "0kZ4aYmqf5fzTt9Yvz8Kvw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-06-17", "type": "review"}

On her way out to bring our bill, she stopped at another table and conversed and gave them great attention for some time, then brought our bill and essentially dropped it off (great way to maximize your tip girl).

I have no idea how I missed out on this place for this long since it is not far from home. I felt like Vic Tayback was going to stick his head out of the kitchen to yell at the servers. lol---- very Divey Diner, 1950's feel to it. The place itself is painted every horrific bright neon 1950's or 1970's loud color you can think of. Goodness the mustard yellow bathroom hallway is just painful to look at! -teehee--They have all these vintage like posters hanging on the walls.\n   The food is typical comfort food and Diner fare. It seems breakfast is the thing here so I will have to come back. The prices are very reasonable and they have monthly specials. They also have a M-F Early Bird Breakfast special before 9am. The prices were an even better deal since I took home half of the large portion and had a second meal. I ordered the steak sandwich and fries $8.99 June special and it was not half bad. The fries were those fresh, hot, really good crinkly cut ones. However, for some reason they needed a lot of salt. I also ordered a side of potato salad which was just store bought tasting. The fun thing here is that all meals after 11am come with a free scoop of yummy ice cream.\n   Everyone was so nice here. From the moment I walked in the door I was fawned all over by the servers.They were outstanding. So friendly and helpful. The customers were very friendly as well. I even became involved in conversations with the folks at the next two tables. Sigh, teachers you can't take us anywhere. Always talking shop to tables with kids. They did assure us though that Eddie's was the place to be on Friday nights for their wonderful Fish Fry Special. The best in town they said. One was an avid fisherman, no less. I noticed a few other Yelpers noted this too. Hmmmmm, being in Phoenix, this seems fishy to me.  :0)--", "business_id": "iAYzRvyBrSkJDu_XZ-E1zQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-06-07", "type": "review"}

Never had bad service or food 4 that matter, but notice a marked improvement each time I visit. We decided 2 visit as the previous day we missed dining here on account of their hours (which I think is pretty ingenious). I'm sure they get a good portion of their business due 2 the fact they close @ 2pm, (unless it's fri open till 8p 4 dinner) so if u snooze u lose! Places like Denny's that r open 24/7 r probably put on the back burner by people that like them because u can go anytime & they'll always b there (except 4 the loc8ions that have shut down).\n\n   I remember back in the day this property used 2 b a bar (named Last Call or something 2 that effect) w/ a weird shaped roof 2 look like a sports arena & there were a few Xs when near accidents almost occurred as drunkards leaving there were almost turned in2 speed~bumps staggering across the road right in2 traffic, oblivious 2 any danger. Glad that's long gone & now replaced by a 60's style place that puts 5 & Diner 2 shame & probably had something 2 do w/ the L8 Nifty 50's & Ed Debevic's being out of business as far as Gr8 pricing 4 Better food w/ Generous portions. \n\n   1derful classic look decor w/ black & white tiled bar & funny themed signs/collectables throughout. When u come in, make sure u stand a li'l 2 the right (not enough 2 fall in a diner's lap) but enough where u can b seen 2 b seated as their busy tending 2 patrons inside unless u opt 4 grabbing a spot @ the bar top. Their windows have been upgraded 2 the frosted logo/design which helps keep u from cooking while w8ing on ur grub & the bright sun out of ur eyes while staying cooler, Nice!\n\n   Service can b w/ a smile or none depending on who u get as ur w8ress but never had bad & would gladly take their worst over what we went thru @ Kiss the Cook!! I also like witnessing other servers helping out other tables w/ refills, clearing pl8es etc which made us wanna tip them 2 (since they were actually friendlier than our w8ress) but hey, she didn't bark @ us or fling our pl8es like frisbees either so I can handle non~smiling (better than being nause8ingly fake/phony if not naturally 'nice').\n\n   Gr8 lamin8ed menus w/ breakfast on 1 side/lunch on the other & I dig the novel concept of the booth tables w/ local places advertising their business/services (actually jotted down a few of interest 4 future reference). What was ordered: a Veggie omelette chock full of spinach, tomato, onion, mushroom, broccoli florets topped w/ sliced avocado, hash browns, a crispy on the outside fluffy inside waffle w/ all natural syrup, an AMAZING Banana Muffin (shoulda got 2), texas style toast w/ grape & mixed berry jelly, perfect no lumps grits w/o being soupy, & apple juice. EVERYTHING was DIvine in complimentary flavors, textures, freshness & portion!!\n\n   What woulda made this 5*? Bring back your AWESOME Bread Pudding we planned on sharing, that YUMMiness was the *Bomb* & we were disappointed not 2 get slightly tipsy from the bourbon or whatever it was made w/. Perhaps that's why they removed it from the menu/no longer offer it. Can see it now: 'No officer, I haven't had anything 2 drink, I just came from that diner & all I had was some bread pudding!'

It's kind of like a more upscale version of Denny's, but with more selection.  I like to come here on Pie Rush Wednesdays, where you can get a free slice of pie with dinner purchase.  They currently have a seasonal Hawaiian strawberry pie that is pretty tasty!

It was about 10:30 and the Village Inn closed at midnight so I listened to yelp and decided to pick up some pie here. The manager was really friendly and I decided on the strawberry rhubarb pie. The pie was soooooo good. Better than Marie Callendars! I definitely plan on coming here on a wednesday to try out the other pies for free!

I wanted to avoid chains, but that is getting harder to do, and this place at least had a local feel even though it is a chain. While I was there, the waitress I had greeted at least 2 people by name, so that's a good sign. \n\nThe French toast was very good, with a vanilla flavor. The coffee was also good, although I tend to like mine not too strong, so maybe it would taste weak to Starbucks regulars. What I really liked was that I got a thermos of coffee for myself, so I could top off when I wanted. The service was good, waitress friendly, and it was a pleasant breakfast experience. There were also some awesome looking pies at the counter, but I was full and it was a little early for pie. =)", "business_id": "dbh72sNyNeHUgJqQye9Vbg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-08-02", "type": "review"}

The first time we were there we enjoyed it and thought the food was great, but this time around was just a bad experience with a horrible waitress.  My boyfriend order a coke and I had an ice tea with a lemon in it, and the slice wedge lemon was old and smelled like it was sitting in a fridge for awhile uncovered and the coke was warm and flat and the ice was melting away already, but she did take the coke back and brought out a new one.  Than I ordered the chicken fried steak with broccoli and mashed potatoes and it is suppose to come with a biscuit too, but instead I received Texas toast, which disappointed but ok with, however the waitress never even said anything why I received Texas Toast rather than a biscuit.  And my broccoli was cold and by the looks of it old too, did not taste very well either.  With my meal it was either a soup or salad and was not offered either and didn't even have the chance to tell her which one I wanted too.  So did not get my soup or salad. My boyfriend just had a turkey sandwich with a Cesar salad and the sandwich, which he said was ok. The waitress dropped our food off with the ticket and we thought that was rude and didn't say a word after. She never came back to refill his coke or my ice tea or even to check on us if the food was ok or if we needed anything and after we finished our meal we sat there for seven minutes until she finally came by and asked if we were going to order pies... umm yeah we wanted two slice of pies and with a new ticket she came back and seeing our cups were empty we hoped she would come back to refill our drinks but no. We ate our pies with no drink. We both sat there thirsty waiting for her to come by at least so we can tell her we would like a refill or water but she never did. My boyfriend did not finish his pie because he needed something to drink because the peanut butter pie was overly sweet and sticky in the mouth.  Hard to finish without liquid.  We were  disappointed, plus the other waitress for the table behind us was amazing she was great too bad she was not our waitress.  top it all off they were not busy and we kept seeing our waitress doing nothing and walking back and forth in the back doing nothing too and tended to another table more than us. And the other table was just one guy that was a regular there. We waited to see if she would at least stop by our table to check up on us but never did once so we just got up and paid for our meal and left!! Just horrible service and not so great food at this Village Inn.  It is not a very hard job to be a waitress and serve your customers and make sure they are satisfy and have what they need and drinks filled, but apparently its hard for her.  I was a waitress before and I can say its not hard to do that job!! So Stacy learn to do your job a bit better and maybe some more training at that too!!", "business_id": "dbh72sNyNeHUgJqQye9Vbg", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-06-23", "type": "review"}

However, no longer will that be the case. Deciding to go here for my birthday breakfast we come in and get seated in the back by the kitchen. Being an non-average looking couple, we expect that seating placement by the kitchen to be from places who really don't want us there. I should of used my experience to know this was the first red flag and leave. Took a long time for anyone to come over to get our drinks. I guess its really hard to see an odd looking couple in the back corner by the kitchen. Finally the manager comes over and asks if we were served yet. Nope. So he took our drink orders and came right back with our drinks. Then we waited. And waited. And waited.\n\nFinely our waitress comes over and takes our orders. Being my birthday I was really craving crepes. Its something I only get on special occasions. I was really excited to get them. It was closer to lunch time so my husband ordered a sandwich. She took our orders and left us to wait. Wait, wait, waiting. Bummer the service is so slow today. I was in no hurry so I could wait. Bet those crepes are going to be great!\n\nAbout a good 25 minutes later, our waitress comes over with my husbands sandwich. And before she places it on the table she informed me that there are no crepes left and will be an additional 15 minutes before they could get any more and make them.\n\nWait, what? Ran out? On my birthday of all days? Couldn't you have told me that 45 minuets ago? Before we put the time in the sit there and enjoy the Village Inn kitchen ambiance? Really? \n\nMy husband refused his sandwich and we left. So disappointed. On my birthday too. Sigh.", "business_id": "dbh72sNyNeHUgJqQye9Vbg", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-07-08", "type": "review"}
