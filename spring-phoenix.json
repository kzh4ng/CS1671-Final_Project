I didn't have much of a problem with drinks, or service until later that night... and that's why I'm taking the time to give this place a 1-star review.\n\nThis is a review about a certain bartender, whose name my friend and I never got, but he said he was Chinese and Colombian. \n\nThe area seems to close down early.... even though there seemed to be a basketball game getting out. The bartender said he was closing up early, directed us to another bar (closed when we got there) hand we found a place nearby. Shortly after, the same bartender showed up at the bar, started drinking with us. I don't remember much about the conversation, except for some lies this guy was telling us, saying that he was running the bar after two weeks of working there, that he didn't live in Phoenix, he lived in New York - later, he forgot that he said that, and told us he lived in the same city in California that we did. \nBy the time the bar closed, I was getting pretty sloshed, and he proceeded to invite himself to our motel room (I thought my friend invited him, and my friend thought I did), and by the time we got to my friend's car, he insisted I sit in the back seat. \nI'll skip some details here, and make a long story short:\n\nI puked on the ride home, so I spent the rest of the night sobering up. The Chinese/Colombian guy kept pushing weed and beer on my friend (who's a lesbian, by the way) and when you're a man, you can tell when a guy is being a sleazeball and trying to get into a girl's pants. It became blatantly obvious that he was waiting for me to pass out so he could do what he wanted, and so I forced myself to stay awake. Again, I'm skipping on a lot of detail here, because Yelp really isn't the place for that.\nAfter he had long overstayed his welcome (which was never offered in the first place), my friend went to the bathroom, and I mustered all the civility I had left to ask him to leave as nicely and non-offensively as possible. To this, he insisted that unless I reimbursed him for the pot and beer he brought (neither of which I personally imbibed) he didn't have to leave. I bit my tongue.\nShortly after, I could hear him talking about me outside when he and my friend were having a cigarette. I snapped, had to get rude with him, pulled my friend inside and slammed the door in his face. \n\nThe point of this whole review is this:\nLadies, watch out for this sleazeball bartender. He'll try to get into your pants by the most disrespectable means.", "business_id": "EmzaQR5hQlF0WIl24NxAZA", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-04-12", "type": "review"}

But here's the summary: they're a good, dependable local business that has earned their strong reviews. \n\nOriginal review: \n\"My car died on a Sunday. I had AAA come out and do a diagnostic.  I was hoping it was just a battery problem, and they could fix it and be done with it. The AAA guy worked with my car for almost an hour, but the starter was shot, so I had to have it towed.  I decided to have it towed to this shop because it's around the corner from my house, I like to support local businesses, and all the reviews were so positive.  Robert called me early in the morning and he was initially very friendly.  He told me they would do a diagnostic test for $64.99 and call me back.  I declined the test (because two different AAA guys already told me the problem), and his response was deeply patronizing: \"Wow, well, if you feel confident that *you* know the problem, sure I can give you a quote for the starter.\"  His quote was $500.  I called a couple other shops, including my trusted mechanic in Tempe, who all quoted me around $300.  I called back and asked if $500 was the best they could do.  Robert offered me a different starter (\"it's decent, and it just has a 1 year warranty\") for $414.  I understand that all shops have different prices, but I am disappointed. I won't be giving them my business.\"\n\nUpdate:\nShortly after I posted the review, the owner of the shop (Matt) called to discuss the situation. We chatted, he took down some information, and called me back later in the day.  We talked for a long time about labor costs, parts and vendors, how shops arrive at estimates, etc. He was professional and courteous. I haven't yet decided whether I will ask them to fix my car; I'm updating the review mostly because I agree with Matt's replies to other comments below -- that price quotes alone aren't worthy of bad reviews and that if we have a mechanic we like, we should stick with them.  I left a bad review because I didn't like the way Robert spoke to me *and* because the price quote was dramatically different than other places. I felt exploited because I was vulnerable -- my car was towed there and I was stuck. (I couldn't go to my mechanic because he was too far away and I was running between my two jobs.)  I'm fixing it because Matt has a lot of integrity as a shop owner and I'm grateful he took the time to research the situation and offer me a better solution.  In yelp-speak, everything is A-OK, and I would recommend them to others.", "business_id": "M-MFa0YErVBbFW2IJhGJmw", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-03-02", "type": "review"}

Of hearing about it, finally, we decided to walk over and pick up some food.\nthen I read some of the yelp reviews and almost changed my mind. The reviews were pretty bad: several reports of poor service and the -the most alarmingly one of all - pointing out how bland and flavorless the food was. also, there were descriptions of it being a cool baby type place with haughty staff and incompetent servers. Did the tempe pita jungle servers moonlight at wild thaiger?\nI was surprised because all the times I drove past it - before realizing how popular it was - I thought it looked typical of a thai/asian place. The name was silly and cheesy, and the giant purple banner that takes up almost the entire front of the unsuspecting cinderblock rest. has just the eyes of a tiger staring at you from their very purple perch. How can this place possibly be too-cool?\nI checked out their web site (which I was surprised to find they had one as this place looks pretty hole-in-the-wall) so we could order ahead and walk to pick it up. the site was pretty slow and I almost gave up, but I was pretty stoked on the options and the prices. Grilled peanut chicken? Sounds great. Spicy chicken curry, I'll take it. tiger prawn salad, ok. All for about $8?? Sounds pretty reasonable. I went with the curry chicken and the spring roll (all lunch items come with either soup of the day or the roll - unless your taking out, as they won't/can't do soup to go.)\nOff we went and when we walked up I was surprised to find that the ramada-like, large patio with high walls and iron bars took up the entire front of the building. We had to search around for the hidden entrance. Once inside it was busy with a downtown business casual crowd, but a scurrying waitress still held the door and asked if we wanted a table (for the record she was not in skinny jeans, flats and sporting tons of eyeliner and a fauxhawk, as I figured she would be).  We walked up to the bar to collect our food and pay, and the lively atmosphere made me sad we were going back to the office and not eating there. the bar area had a flat screen tv, there was lively if a little over-the-top Asian pop music, and the healthy crowd was a nice change of pace. Alas, we were in and out (they were not even put out by our asking to split up the to go order so we could each pay separately, even though they were obviously busy) in under 10 minutes.\nThe food stayed pretty hot for the 15 minute walk back, and they double bagged each Styrofoam box -thank god, as half my curry sauce came out of the box. It smelled great and the veggies looked good, but I braced myself for disappointment. Perhaps because I was expecting it to be bad, I was pleasantly surprised. It was pretty good. Mine was just enough spicy as is (for me, though and I'm a wuss - so If you're into hot-hot-hot, ask to punch it up a notch or three) and the serving was plenty for the price. The veggie spring roll was great - not even soggy from the trip, how did that happen? I think the curry sauce was a little thin, but it wouldn't keep me from ordering it again - my coworker's ginger chicken sauce looked thin as well, but she said it was still great. The tiger prawn salad had green, fresh lettuce (looked like a spring mix) and came with lots of scrimps that were \"fat and juicy.\" However, they listed that the salad came with crispy wontons, but her box was sans any wontons - really the only foil in the entire experience.\nAll in all I would say it was a score. The three of us agreed that it would make a good HH spot.\nIt's no yupha's, but certainly better than thai basil - and not a chain. Plus they were still busy, busy despite being smack in the middle of the light rail cluster fuch on central - they must be doing something right!", "business_id": "KPoTixdjoJxSqRSEApSAGg", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-05-02", "type": "review"}

The papaya salad was refreshing and really authentic, although the shrimp were a little fishy for our tastes. The soup we had was also very flavorful and best of all, the chicken in it was actual pieces of chicken breast (often, the chicken in soup is small pieces of dark meat). The Mussaman curry was also a lot better than most places we have had it - often, restaurants use pieces of flank or strip steak, but a more authentic version, like the one we had here, has more stew-like cuts of almost-braised beef. Also a real winner were the spicy clear/glass noodles with vegetables and chicken.

By what I have read and now I interpreted the menu, I thought it was just fancy schmancy version of my fave Thai dishes. Since I'm not one to mess with classics, I didn't know how I'd like this spot. Wifey told me that tonight was the Thai New Year and they were going to have live music and dancers, so I figured uck it why not. What an awesome meal.\n\nWe started with the veggie sampler ($12.95) as our appetizer and a big ole $5 Thai beer. The sampler had the corn fritters, veggie egg rolls and tofu in peanut sauce. The corn fritters were other worldly, totally killer, I really enjoyed the tofu and the veggie rolls. What a great way to open up the meal.\n\nFor our meals, we split the Seafood Panang which was shrimp, scallops, mussels, calamari and salmon in a spicy red coconut sauce. The ONLY part I didn't totally love was the calamari, it was waaaay chewy. Every other part was perfect. The shrimp were sweet and succulent, the scallops cooked to utter perfection, the mussels were done the was they're supposed to be not chewy, tender) and the salmon was something to slap my mama over. \n\nThe other dish we had to split was the Merry Mu (grilled pork served with coconut rice and carrot \"relish\"). The pork was perfectly seasoned sliced large pork pieces, the coconut rice was a sticky ball of semi sweet rice (not my bag, but I think some people would like it) and the carrot relish was more like a sweet carrot salad. It did come with this really peculiar (in a good way) green salty/bitter sauce that I kept going back to. I realized a piece of the pork, with some of the sweet carrot salad and the sauce had the total package. Wow. \n\nWe ended the meal with a stiff cocktail (I had this cosmo thing with sake, cranberry and lime juice that I had them serve me in a regular cup instead of the martini glass so I didn't look like a nancy) and wifey had a big ole slice of chocolate cake. Triple decker and all.\n\nWe ended up leaving around 720 or so, and the music was SUPPOSED to start at 7 but we didn't get to see it.

Overall it was a good dish.\n\nMy co workers opted for the soup. It was a curry soup with chicken in it. They said it was just ok.\n\nDue to the slower service, microwaves and higher prices I gave it 3 vs 4 stars.

The description listed it as being perfect for the \"true Thai foodie.\" With a description like that, I had to order it. The dish was spicy and flavorful. I'd caution anyone not familiar with Thai food that it might be a bit too spicy for you even if you like spicy foods. Different chiles effect people differently. My husband ordered the Ginger Fish. The sauce on the fish was like liquid crack. I could've taken a bath in it. Long story short: it was SO good. \n\nI'll definitely be back to try some of their other menu items.

I'm a big fan of the fried noodles mainly Pad See Ew - Stir-fried fat noodles with your choice of protein; chicken, beef, or pork; and of course vegetables.  Seems pretty simple, but this dish packs a punch of aroma and spice.  It's usually fried in a garlic sauce and the amount of heat is based on how much you can handle.  I can't do the Thai spice I'll admit so I always do the medium.  In any case, Wild Thaiger deliveries with the Pad See Ew along with their traditional Pad Thai dish.  Another stir-fried noodle, but this one is with the skinny noodles and it's much sweeter.\n\nOverall, I would come here for Happy Hour because they have 1/2 off appetizers.

Everyone in the waiting room was called before I was and I wasn't even seeing my actual Dr, I was assigned a PA instead.  I did the usual Urine sample, and they took my blood and vitals but the PA kept asking me questions I already answered to the nurse which made me notice she wasn't even looking at my file nor had it with her, she was just taking notes on the Patient info sheet I filled out.  She breezed through a low quality ultrasound and I had to ask her for pics which were blurry and barely even worth printing when I saw them.  She explained that I would be going to a different facility in 2 weeks for the ultrasound and then go back to their office for the check up which I wasn't happy about having to go to multiple places but understood.  When she finished I had to ask her about the results of the UA since I told her I felt like I may have a UTI, she told me everything looked fine but they would have to send it out to get those results (I've never heard of not getting UTI results the same day) and that she would just send a script for an antibiotic to my pharmacy which would be ready when I left there and that they would call in a couple days and tell me the results and I could stop taking them if they were negative.  I waited until the next day to go to the Pharm and no script was sent, I called the OBGYN and explained there was supposed to be a script for an antibiotic and they said they would send it over. the next day the pharm called to tell me my script for prenatal was ready but that was all that was sent. I didn't even ask for prenatals since they're over the counter!!!! called the DR AGAIN and had it sent over, still no call from the Dr regarding my results but I thought I would wait another day.  still a week later and 3 calls asking for my results and I had to call THEM to find out that the results had been in and are negative but the PA must have overlooked needing to call and let me know.  I have requested my file and am switching to Maricopa OBGYN, I'm very disappointed in my first prenatal Dr visit as this should be a happy time and your doctor should make you feel comfortable, I hope Maricopa can turn this around and make it a positive experience for me as it should be.", "business_id": "1acmBPmmFDovVSHHzMrJ9A", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-04-09", "type": "review"}

However, it is a good size and very convenient. The bathroom was oddly large and included a huge tub. The balcony was spacious. Our room looked over north Phoenix and was directly above the Irish Cultural Center, which was our reception site. It was great to be able to watch the set up from our balcony. \n\nThe staff was very nice. They were also apologetic about some of the conditions of the property. My sisters asked some of the staff to decorate our suite for our wedding night, and after the reception we were surprised by candles everywhere in our room and a bottle of champagne! Very sweet. \n\nOverall I am pleased with our stay at the hotel.

You all were obviously on crack when you ate here. Or maybe they gave you crack when you ate here...either way my experience was not the same.\n\nWent at about 4:00 on a Saturday, not a busy time for a restaurant so I wasn't scared away when we were the only ones in the entire place, next time, I'll make sure to think twice.\n\nThey started us off with chips and salsa, and I'm rather shocked that no one has mentioned their chips are a total fail. Salsa was decent, but the chips were an assortment of sweet potato chips, stale blue corn chips, sweet fried chips (sugar and everything), and stale normal tortilla chips. All in one bowl. If they weren't stale, the blue corn and normal chips would have paired nicely with the salsa. But rubbery sweet potato (don't get me wrong, I like sweet potato)  and sugar coated with salsa? Really?\n\nWe decided that we were going to order an appetizer and then a meal to split, and I love a good artichoke-anything so I ordered the artichoke dip. When it came out (like 20 minutes later) I had to ask them if they brought us the right dish. It was a bowl of queso and no matter how hard I searched, there was not an artichoke to be found. They didn't bring us any other chips to go with it, and let me tell you, sweet potato chips and queso don't go so great together. To make it worse, the menu said it was $6.99 but they charged us $7.79, if it was good I wouldn't have cared so much about $0.80 as I do.\n\nI thought a good beef fajita dish with a cup of chicken tortilla soup would be a safe bet, but they couldn't even do that right. They brought out corn and flour tortillas with the fajitas. Word of advice, if they ask you which you prefer save yourself the trouble and get the flour. The corn ones were so wet that they literally tore to shreds when I tried to peel them off each other. There wasn't a whole lot of beef in the beef fajitas either, and what was there was lacking in good flavor. And for the soup, Half Moon Sports Grill makes a better tortilla soup than this place...and they're a sports grill. \n\nOverall, food was bad. Service was very slow considering we were the only ones there, and I would never, ever eat here again. Did I mention they didn't give us silverware?

Never had a problem with drinks, wait wasn't too long, etc. \n\nFood: Meh, I've had a lot better. The hubby ordered the Grilled Vegetable Pasta. He seemed to like it, but I hated it. Think angelhair tossed with lots of great grilled veggies - then throw in some black beans and an asian soy sauce of some sort. YUCK. The combination of the textures and flavors were all wrong. I ordered the Chil-Rubbed Sirloin and ordered it medium. The temperature was perfect, which was a nice surprise. However, the \"chile-rub\" tasted like straight up chili powder. Nothing more, nothing less. The mashed potatoes had diced CARROTS in them, and I'm sorry, no matter how great of an idea that may seem, carrots are NOT a good idea in mashed potatoes. They tasted alright, but again, the texture and just the overall flavor was all wrong. The hubby also ordered a margarita, which was good, but we've definitely had better.\n\nAll in all I was a little disappointed. Perhaps we ordered the wrong items, but then again, I'm not too sure what would be considered great on a menu that reads Sams-Mex, Mex-Mex and Pasta as options.\n\nProbably won't return.", "business_id": "e5kc0CQ4R-PCCDgb274gSg", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-05-31", "type": "review"}

When I got the tray, I initially thought they had mistaken the dish for a three rolled tacos, with mole-like sauce? First I had to decipher if it was fried, which was later confirmed. Then the sauce on top was definitely something that you cannot label. It had a sweet, mole, yet bitter taste, with sour cream that was light and fluffy and made it look like whip cream. I know . . . strange you say? The pork was dried out and even the two of us could not finish this one meal that was split. The beans tasted hallow, if that's even possible and the rice was extra dry. \n\nI am sorry to give this such a harsh review, but it's the truth and sometimes the truth hurts.

Very nicely decorated and furnished in the Southwestern style that is common down here but done nicely, not gaudy or tacky in any way. There is a nice outside patio seating area, however considering I'm from Seattle and the temp was still pushing 100 degrees, we opted to sit inside.\n\nOnce we were seated, we were tempted to order the \"Limit-2\" margaritas that they are apparently famous for, but decided against it. After taking our drink order, the waitress brought us a basket of chips and a bowl of salsa.\n\nLet me stop right here.\n\nI knew just from looking at them, that these were no ordinary chips . Not only were they a mixture of different types of chips (regular tortillas, sweet potato, and wontons), but each type was topped in a different seasoning -- my favorite being the wonton chips topped in seasoning and some powdered sugar, giving it a sweet and spicy flavor at the same time. Amazing. I asked the waitress what the seasoning but I swear they were laced with cocaine as well. Hands down the best chips and salsa I've ever had in my life. I would go back just for that!\n\nOnce we overcame the confusion of what the \"Super Salad\" was (it turns out she was asking if I wanted soup OR salad), I ordered the Pueblo House Salad to start with. It was a very nice sized salad (could easily have been shared by two people if someone wanted to), and delicious with their honey chipotle vinaigrette dressing.\n\nFor the main course, I opted for the Santa Fe Stuffed Chicken Breast, which came off the \"Sam-Mex\" section of the menu. According to the menu, \"Sam-Mex\" was created by their executive chef with \"the influence of Mexican, Spanish, Native American and American Southwest Cultures.\" The chicken breast was stuffed with herb-goat cheese and served over a roasted red pepper cream sauce with a pine nut & cilantro pesto, grilled asparagus and southwest rice.\n\nWords cannot describe the amazing fusion of these different flavors as they combined into one superbly mind blowing dish.\n\nI'll be honest, it was hard to concentrate on the conversation with my buddy as I was distracted each time I took a bite -- but don't let him know I said that!\n \nAt the end of the meal, as we opted not to order dessert (or the crazy margarita), we were treated to what the waitress referred to as \"white chocolate tamales,\" compliments of the chef. Of course, know that I have read some of the other reviews on here, it seems that everyone gets these little treats, but whether the chef really intended for us to specifically have them or not was a mute point after tasting them -- a great finishing touch on an amazing meal. \n\nWhile I don't often get down to this part of the country, I will always have fond memories of this little \"cafe\" called, Sam's.", "business_id": "e5kc0CQ4R-PCCDgb274gSg", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-04-23", "type": "review"}

We were greeted and seated right away, we chose the patio to enjoy then spring weather. The ambiance was casual and made you feel like you were eating at home.  The service was quick and the staff very knowledgeable.  We even got a personal visit from the manager to ensure we were enjoying our dining.  \n\nWe started the dinner off with the best chips and salsa I have ever tasted. The salsa tasted like heaven and I am very picky about my salsa. I believe it was made with some adobo sauce. To wash it down we tried the pitcher of canyon margaritas.   The prickly pear and cranberry provided a nice flavor twist although it was a bit too sweet for Dave's liking. \nFor dinner, Dave tried the Southwestern tortellini  and I had the mini chimichangas.  The tortellini were covered in a chorizo cream sauce and was delicious.  The mini chimichangas did not disappoint mouth watering flavor in every bite.  Both meals were superb.  We decided to splurge for dessert and tried the tres leches cake with a strawberry sauce.  It was the most moist tres leches I have ever tried (even ones I have tried to make).  It was the perfect ending to a great meal.  If that wasn't enough they provided a commentary dessert, a divine white chocolate almond tamale.  A fun twist on the traditional tamale.  Even the left overs the next day were amazing. \n\nOver all this was a fabulous place to visit.  The only downside is that our meal was a bit pricy but I am sure that the $25 margarita pitcher didn't help.

The fajitas looked really really good! They had various kinds of vegetables in them, not just peppers and onions like some other places do. My veggie pasta was really delicious. It's pasta with a garlic black bean soy sauce. It's topped with roasted vegetables. The only thing is i wish I knew that there were tomatoes in it because I would have ordered it without. Not a big deal though, since I was able to pick them out. My dad's salmon was fresh and he said it was delicious. We didn't order dessert, even though their deserts look AMAZING. They have something called a banana burrito, which looks really good. This restaurant also has a gluten free menu if that's how you roll. \n\nOur server Ryan was really good! He made sure our drinks were full and brought us new chips when our basket was empty. He was very attentive and made sure our visit was superb. BTW, their tortilla chips are out of this world. \n\nWe sat outside on the patio and overlooked the lit up palm trees and the fountains. It was really nice out and our visit was very pleasant. There was also some live music playing. The food took a little long to come out but it wasn't ridiculous.

Out of the 4 margaritas I personally had over two nights; 1 was Fantastic, one was overly strong, 1 tasted like a virgin, and 1 was just okay.\n\nAs for the actual food, the chips they serve with the chips and salsa were an interesting and cool mix of yellow and blue corn tortilla, sweet potato (my fav), wonton (second fav), and flour tortillas with a dry seasoning (next fav).

No, we have a movie to catch and don't want to sit around and wait when you can get a server.\n\nBasically, it was one of the worst experiences I've had - no table after we made a reservation, no acknowledgement at the bar, and no servers able to take us.

The museum looks very small from the outside, but it sure manages to open up and cram a lot into the space on both of its floors.  I highly recommend checking out the current Geronimo exhibit.  Thanks to Hollywood (which I should know better than to trust for an accurate portrayals of american indians), I always thought he was an apache hero.  Turns out most apache don't like him.\n\nOutside of a history text book, native american culture can be difficult to study.  It also doesn't help that most presentations of american indian history just make me feel guilty about what our government did to their ancestors decades and centuries before my family even immigrated to the country.  While the Herd Museum doesn't completely avoid this feeling, it does try its best not to shove it in your face.\n\nThe $15 dollar admission isn't too bad.  Free parking was an unexpected treat.

Going once will not do justice! I'm from NY and it was my first time in Phoenix, so I definitely made sure I went to hear what the buzz in town was all about.\n\nThe museum is free on Wednesdays! I ended up going on a Tuesday, so I just paid the full price admission of $16. I figured, hey...why not! I'm not going to be here again for awhile.\n\nI learned so much about the lifestyle of all the different Native American reservations in Arizona and across the US. From the Navajo to the Hopi tribes, the pottery they make to the garments they wore, the Heard Museum was a mind-blasting educational experience! There was definitely too much information for me to absorb in one day, which is why I would go back again if I were ever in Phoenix.\n\nThe gift shop is pricey! I wanted to buy a souvenir, perhaps a piece of unique jewelry, but all the ones that caught my eye were in the $200+ range. Regardless, the knowledge I gained walking out of the museum was priceless!\n\nThe most disturbing moment for me was learning about how these Native Americans were pushed out of their lands and forced to live as \"civilized\" beings. This particular exhibit is located on their 2nd floor and did a great job in making me feel uncomfortable. \n\nThey endured torture and were forced to lose their long hair, their traditional clothing, their identity...denied the right to be who they are. Sound familiar? Sound like the racism slaves endured in the South? Well, nothing I read or hear will ever allow me to fully understand what these individuals dealt with, and probably still deal with, but knowing and understanding that this exists only makes me love the strength of the Native Americans.\n\nAll I can learn are what the pages of textbooks taught us in history class, but now that I am out of school, a museum has a way of retelling stories of the past on a whole other level. \n\nThe best part was connecting the dots about Arizona. I went to the Grand Canyon prior to my excursion in Phoenix, and I realized that a lot of the different locations in the Grand Canyon are named after these Native American tribes. \n\nI love me some education! ;)", "business_id": "SG_gEmEXL4ID6RAEinC5Bg", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-05-31", "type": "review"}

I have gone twice and have left extremely impressed both times.  The atmosphere is so amazing.  Right away, just walking through the courtyard to the main entrance, there's so much beauty to take in.  You'll walk past the courtyard cafe, cantina, bookstore, and gift shop on the way to the main entrance.  Both times I've gone, I did the museum first and then the shops and cafe afterwards.  \n\nThe entire museum is somewhat of a maze and, if you're not on a guided tour, can be pretty confusing to navigate.  We didn't have a tour guide either time -- they're free and on a regular schedule, but we preferred to wander at our own pace.  The first floor is very large and divided up into sections.  There's a lot of baskets, pottery, and katsina dolls to check out, and some really interesting native american history to take in.  I learned a lot about the local and native history.  The first floor (to me) gets boring kind of quickly.  A lot of the collections are not as old or historic as I had expected.  It seems like the younger visitors enjoyed the first level more than I did.\n\nThe most impressive part of the museum for me was the 2nd level.  I was in complete awe of the Indian Boarding School exhibit.  I learned SO much about the Indian Schools that I had never even heard of before.  I really wish they would have taught us about this experience when I was in school.  It was AMAZING.  \n\nOverall, the museum experience was very good.  We learned a lot and really enjoyed the history, art, and culture.  The only thing I don't like about the museum is navigating through it.  They do give you maps and offer guided tours, but it's fairly difficult to navigate if you don't know where you're going.  I don't like to look at maps, I prefer to wander.  Different areas are not very clearly marked.  You'll see a door in a hallway and wonder what it leads to, then walk through and realize you're entering a completely different part of the museum.  It's kind of hard to explain, but I wish the areas were more clearly marked.  It's not really big enough to get lost in, but we definitely had several occurrences where we weren't really sure where we were or where we were headed.\n\nThe 2nd time I visited, we decided to have lunch at the cafe and we were really impressed.  The service was great and the prices were MUCH more reasonable than we had expected.  We figured it would be pricey, but it was not.  I had the smoked salmon quesadilla and it was outstanding.  \n\nThe museum shop is pretty typical from what I've experienced at other museums -- a few knick-knacks that are in my price range, surrounded by ridiculously high priced pieces of art/pottery/dolls/rugs.  It's REALLY neat to look at but I couldn't imagine buying anything other than a magnet or a coffee mug.  Some of the pieces are thousands of dollars, but it's awesome to just look and admire.\n\nOverall, always a great experience, easy to find (there's a light rail stop right out front), and it's also very close to other touristy places if you're visiting and want to experience Phoenix.

I have been to the theater to see the Nutcracker when I was a kid and I saw the Lion King in New York when I was a kid as well. I remember them being fun, but that's about the extent of my memories of the theater. There happened to be a groupon for the play \"The Mystery of Irma Vep\" that my mom purchased for the four of us (mom, myself, husband, sister) to attend. \n\nWe got there a bit early after dinner and walked around the theater looking at the art that was up around the building. There were places you could grab a drink and relax before the show. At our call time we went in and found our seats. We were up on the balcony in the fifth row pretty much right in the center. We had really good seats. The only thing about this theater that made me uncomfortable and keeps it from attaining that fifth star were first of all the seats. The backs were extremely straight and having a back condition it makes sitting up that straight difficult for long periods of time. The second thing that was a bit uncomfortable was the temperature of the theater. It was a bit warmer than I would have liked. I left coated in a film of sweat. Not pleasant. I was nervous I wasn't dressed appropriately having never been to the theater before, I went in jeans and a t-shirt, but I am glad now that I did because it would have been much more uncomfortable in one of my nice silk dresses than in jeans. \n\nHowever the show was hilarious. The part that made it for me was when one of the characters started singing the Rebecca Black \"Friday\" song. Classic! Most of the people in the theater didn't get the reference so there were only a few pockets of young people laughing when it happened. But I found it to be a nice touch and after a play full of references I didn't get, I liked that there was something for us young folk thrown in. The rest of the show was funny, and I am glad that I got to experience it. \n\nAfter coming here I am interested in becoming more active in plays and am looking into seeing a ballet soon.

When I was there they had an average of about 400 students from 6-12th grade.\n\nMorning classes (7:45am - 12:15pm) are normal academics. Performing arts are in the afternoon till 2-3pm depending on the classes. \n\nFor middle school:\nPiano is a required class during the morning.\nPerforming arts options are voice & an instrument (this includes strings I believe), OR ballet (offered off campus with transportation by the school).\nGuitar is available after 6th grade.\nJazz band & percussion ensemble is available by audition only after 6th grade.\nDrama is more of an after school program & has a fee. \n\nFor high school:\nStudents choose 2-3 classes from music (instrument, voice or piano), OR drama, OR ballet.\n\nTo get in there was a waiting list. Or was it first come first serve? Either way, be sure to put your kids name down or be there when they first open with all the necessary paper work. The slots are limited. Remember, the school is SMALL!\n\nI hear they are trying to remodel & expand. When I went there the school rented space from the church, but is in no way affiliated religiously. Other space was across the street. Yes, you cross the street back & forth to get from 1 class to the next. They even had the rule, \"No hugging in the crosswalk.\" That says something about the students lol\n\nConcerts were held in Pilgrim Hall or the actual church. Pilgrim Hall is where lunch can be eaten or a band class is held in the afternoon. Other students eat in the courtyard. A lunch truck (roach coach) came so students could purchase a lunch if they didn't bring their own.\n\nThis school had a high turn over of teachers. Every year about 25% of the faculty would either be fired or quit. That's actually a lot of teachers. This may not be the case anymore since the school officials have changed. There are teachers still teaching that I recognize from when I went there:\n- Leah Fregulia-Roberts (Head of School) used to be the pricipal\n- Brian Hawkins (11th & 12th Grade Math)\n- Kyle Kirkman (7th & 8th Grade Math) taught me\n- Diane Legge (5th Grade Piano) taught me piano when there was no 5th grade\n- Kristin Mailhiot (Vice-Principal) used to be a middle school science teacher\n\nStudents who either go to this school during HS or graduate stay involved. I would know, I'm friends with a lot of them on Facebook. They stay arts oriented a lot of the time & still talk about things currently going on at ASA.\n\nSo, why did I leave? There are a few reasons.\n- I wanted a big HS experience.\n- I wanted to go to school with more than 400 students.\n- I wanted life lessons. I didn't want to be sheltered. I wanted to see how the real world worked.\n- I wanted to go to a school where there was more than 2 guys to every 10 girls. And where those guys weren't gay. Nothing wrong with being gay. But I like boys, gay boys aren't interested in girls. See where I'm going with this?\n- I wanted to get away from the 5 hours of homework every night. I was constantly exhausted. I was 11, 12, & 13. I was still a kid. I missed my time to play... & sleep.\n- I wanted to get away from teachers who taught opinions instead of facts. Yes, this happened. Yes, I told him he was wrong for doing so. Yes, he hated me for it.\n- I hated playing an instrument. I didn't have time to practice after all that homework. I can't sing. Anything I was interested in wasn't available till a later year. Blah blah blah... I'm not creative. Honestly, I'm not.\n- I wanted more options. Different types of friends. Maybe to go to school with more than 95% white kids.\n\nWhat did I like?\n- I kept friends I made in middle school to this very day.\n- The teachers are smart & actually make friends with their students.\n- I usually loved the required summer reading choices.\n- I love how close the Burton Barr library is. Spent almost every day after school there. I knew people who worked there & am still friends with them.", "business_id": "Z9GH9bo8SHKx3oOokhHLyw", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-04-07", "type": "review"}

A review is due lest I be usurped.\n\nMajerle's (Mar-lees) is one of downtown Phoenix's great sports bar. It's great for pre-gaming before heading down the street to US Airways Center or Chase Field. It's great for post-game festivities after leaving the stadiums. And it's great for just watching any game with friends on any of the multiple HD TVs.\n\nMajerle's has plenty of beers on tap, a solid HH menu, and serves libations until around 2am every night. It also seems like it's a bonafide occupational qualification to be hot to work here, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. \n\nMajerle's is not great with food, however. They shell out the typical pedestrian bar fare, which is highly suitable for the typical Diamondbacks fan, but if your taste buds yearn for something more refined, you're much better off grabbing food at Networks Bar and Grill or The Arrogant Butcher down the street. \n\nIn conclusion, Majerle's is the slam dunk watering hole in downtown on a game night.

The room inside was gorgeous and full of old school glamour.  Check out the website to see photos of the room.  We soon discovered that we both forgot to bring our toothbrushes and toothpaste and the front desk had some sent up to us right away.\n\nIf you appreciate historic buildings, old school charm, and ghost stories, you have to check this place out, it really is cool.

While the hotel has a lounge, it's dimly lit and looks like a run down lounge, rather than an upscale destination. \n\nOn St. Patrick's Day, both the lounge and the Irish bar next door throw a big St. Patty's Day party. If you're there for important business, it's not really where you should be staying. If you're there for a sports trip to go to a Suns or Diamondbacks game with a bunch of guys, then it's fine.\n\nThe wireless signal in room 607 was non-existent most of the time, unless you positioned yourself near the window or in a very specific spot on the bed.\n\nThe first night I brought my MacBook Pro down to the lobby to see if I could get a signal. While I could get a signal, there was no where to sit and plug-in, so that option was out. I went over to the brand new Westin Hotel across the street and used the free wi-fi in the lobby lounge. Truth be told, I'd rather have stayed at the Westin, but I was trying to save the company a few dollars. That's a decision I will think twice about in the future.\n\nThe second night, frustrated, I called downstairs to the desk and the woman told me that I should bring my laptop downstairs to see if I could connect, then go back upstairs. What she didn't know is that I've been in the Internet industry for 16-years. When I pleaded to switch rooms, she continued to try and tell me to come downstairs, even though I'd already tried that the night before. When I insisted that she find me another room, she told me the hotel was overbooked. She also started down the road of blaming the customer, saying \"why are you yelling at me?\" I said, I am not yelling at you, I am frustrated because your hotel advertises free wi-fi, now you're telling me I have to come downstairs (which I did the night before) and try to connect, then go back upstairs.\n\nAfter that call, I took my laptop over to the Sheraton, another Starwood Hotel, which is a bit longer of a walk, but it was nice out. I sat in the lobby on their free wi-fi while watching a bit of March Madness on the big screen and enjoying snacks from their convenience shop.\n\nIf you need a wi-fi connection, then stay far far away from this hotel.\n\nNow to the roach. So, I went to take a shower the morning of my departure and found our not so little friend in the bathtub. Gross. I called down and that sent a bell man up to check it out, but it had scurried somewhere by the time he arrived. I took a very quick shower (which took some time to warm, maybe because of the age of the hotel and it's old water system), checked out, and will never go back.\n\nSorry Hotel San Carlos. While you are a charming little old hotel, you're not for me. I can't recommend you.\n\nI will say that the only benefit to this hotel is the barber shop on the ground floor. They were really nice I got a great haircut, but it was $18. And, the hotel is directly on the path of the light rail from the airport, so it's pretty easy to get to. Although the Westin is now right there too, so I'd prefer to stay at the new Westin in the future, given it's proximity to ASU Cronkite School.", "business_id": "_yfprBETaYgySkKyl8ZWMQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-03-22", "type": "review"}

She offered us a good deal compared to their normal pricing but we were all a little tight on funds so we were nervous about upgrading. She asked the manager to come over and after chatting with all of us for a few minutes (she was so super sweet and informative about the history of the hotel and an absolute pleasure to speak with) she worked some kind of wonderful magic and brought the room down to a killer deal that was completely mind blowing. All of us were so excited because not only did each of us now have a bed to sleep in, but it was going to save us money so that we had a bit more to spend at the Con. \n\nThe room had a separate living room with a couch bed, desk, chair, and foot stool. The bedroom had 2 full-size beds and a nice desk. The view was of downtown PHX and it had 2 nice-sized closets and 2 bathrooms! This was perfect for 3 girls and 2 guys since we all had to get ready at the same time. \n\nThe hotel is beautiful. The lobby is quaint and well appointed.

I will say that without knowing anything about the haunting history I did step onto the elevator by myself to go up to my room and all of the sudden I smelled some sort of fruity  perfume smell that was not present when I first got into it and the elevator which was set to go up took me down to the basement even though the B button was not pushed and my room was on the 5th floor.

Decent cable and local channels, free Wi-Fi and located right in the heart of downtown Phoenix in walking distance of City Center mall, United Airlines arena and some cool lounges, bars and restaurants.\n\nWould I stay here again...well if my budget was better probably not, but that's just me being high maintenance when it comes to vacations but if I am on a tight budget as I was on this vacay then sure I would most likely stay here again if needed.", "business_id": "_yfprBETaYgySkKyl8ZWMQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-03-15", "type": "review"}

It's in downtown Phoenix which makes it feel very chic and exciting. They validate parking (I only paid $2 after validation, but I was at the salon for a few hours).

She spent extra time with me and made sure I was happy.\n\nThe negatives which will most likely make me not go back:\nIt was expensive- once again, I visit Aveda salons frequently and was still shocked when the (unfriendly) receptionist rung me up.\nPartially the reason my ticket was so expensive was because I had 2 products that I was going to purchase. After seeing the bill, I put one back and thought about coming back another day to return the other because I was embarrassed and felt guilty putting both products back.\n\nThis leads me into complaining about how they take EVERY chance at an up sell.

You don't need to be of any particular background to enjoy this well done production. \n\nKornbluth used Andy Warhol's 10 silk-screen prints of the important Jews of the 20th century as a jumping off point for this show. He was commissioned to do the piece which is making its Phoenix debut. \n\nThe play was a mix of historical, autobiographical and sociological musings. Kornbluth explored his own relationships with his family (he was of Jewish decent but raised atheist), Andy Warhol's upbringing (fascinating in itself) and the selection process of the 10 Jews in the exhibit. He also touched on the stories of each person (the Marx brothers were done as one set), also giving insight on their individual impacts on our world. \n\nI wish I could remember some of the brilliant lines, but I can only recall \"Albert Einstein is the patron saint of 'What if?'\". The performance made me want to know more about Brandeis, the first Jew on the Supreme Court. I wanted to know more about all of the featured subjects. \n\nKornbluth is a masterful storyteller.

It looks like they were a bit overwhelmed with the free specials they offer but at least, they tried and appeared pretty much trained for the type of speed they'd have to deal with.

It was an easy walk across the street from the hotel where I'm staying.  I ordered the Breakfast Sampler scrambled.  Kimberly (290) was very attentive and provided excellent service.\n\nThe food was great even if the bacon was a tad overcooked.  Kimberly even warmed up the maple syrup for me which made already good pancakes even better.  If this is where things stopped, I would have rated my experience a full five stars.\n\nThe only problem with the visit was the AWFUL \"music\" that was playing.  It stinks on ice!  I don't know what corporate nitwit is in charge of picking the crap that was playing, but he or she should be fired post haste.  Also, forcing locations to play whatever fodder corporate pumps out and not even giving them the option to turn down the volume is utterly stupid.  The garbage that was playing as \"music\" is unforgivable.  Play some Sinatra and Martin, Eagles and Clapton, Pink Floyd and Rush, or even something like \"The Bridge\" on SiriusXM.  I'd much prefer SILENCE over the audio excrement that was oozing from the speakers while I ate.  It was unappealing, unappetizing, and very annoying.  That alone will keep me and my wallet from coming back or recommending IHOP to friends.  Corporate stupidity sadly pulls my rating down to two stars.  That's unfair to everyone at the location.

I thought that the first meet up was going to be hard to beat because it was so good but this place knocked another one out of the park. I think I just found my new favorite Mexican food place in town.\nFrom the outside it looks like a hodge podge of different additions obviously added at different times with no thought at trying to make it match at all. Even the parking lot was a little crazy. Walking in the two front doors continues the hodge podge theme. This is a family owned restaurant that has been here awhile for sure. We sat in the front waiting area for the rest of the group to show up and I had to use the bathroom really quick. Those were also scary. Questions started to arise about this place. I hope the food is good. We waited a little while longer and they decided to seat us even though our whole party wasn't there. Then we walk in to the main dinning are. Now obviously at some point they gutted the entire inside and completely remodeled it. It was very nice. It was a large open space with an exposed ceiling and lots of tables. We were taken to a back section where several tables had been pushed together for us. Maria our server came over and chips and salsa were on the table immediately. She did a great job the entire night. Best services I have had in awhile. She took everyone's drink orders and drinks started to come out a few at a time. Once everyone was there and ready to order she went around the table and took everyone's order. Offering suggestions and helping with custom orders.\nAfter what seemed like only a few minutes. Dishes started to come out as well. One or two here then a few more over there. Finally everybody had what they ordered and it all looked and smelled really good.\nThen fork went to mouth and somewhere a chorus started singing. Wow this was really good. I had ordered a Carne Asada steak with a cheese enchilada. I couldn't pronounce what it was called when I ordered it and I won't even attempt it here. It really was some of the best Mexican food I have ever had. The steak had a great flavor to it and with all of the cheese and sauce and everything it just added to it. I couldn't even finish. Although there wasn't too much left.\nEven after that I still had to try some dessert especially after I saw churros and ice cream on the menu. This was not a mistake. It was so good. The ice cream was fantastic and the churros were warm and soft.\nEverything was amazing. Maria was a great server. The company was fantastic as usual. Maria even split the check up for us even though there was a handwritten sign up front that said they didn't do that.\nI hope to have many return visits here.

We were both happy to see that they had such a great selection of Mexican beers and so hubby was able to get a Bohemia instead of settling for the usual Corona or XX. I was super happy to order a Michelada and as always that put me in the mood for seafood which is perfect since Comedor Guadalajara not only has traditional Mexican entrees but a variety of Mexican style seafood dishes on their menu.\n\nEven though we were served chips and salsa immediately upon being seated, we decided to start with the chorizo bean dip since that sounded pretty tasty. I was expecting it to be served in a small dish like the salsa but instead it came out with a giant portion and a bunch of thicker chips topped with melted cheese. Fortunately my fellow Yelpers helped us out but we still couldn't finish it. I love bean dip in general but this one had a great flavor from the chorizo and I didn't feel like it was too greasy. I would say that the chorizo bean dip is a must-order if you are with a group.\n\nAfter that, we got our entrees. My hubby got the Tampiquena steak which was a skirt steak seasoned and broiled and served with rice and beans. Most people would call that carne asada so I am not sure why they didn't name it that on the menu. I thought Tampiquena was when they chop up the steak and put chili sauce and cheese on it. But I haven't seen that outside of Texas so maybe that's a regional thing, I don't know. Anyway, he loves steak so was happy with the meat but he thought the rest of it was just ok. Growing up on the border we are picky about tortillas and these were not very authentic looking and he said they also were not great tasting but not bad either.\n\nI ordered the Campechana and that also turned out to be a humongous portion (see pic). They serve it in a huge bowl like soup instead of a tall footed glass dish like seafood cocktail (cockteles) are usually served in. However, it wasn't really that much more substance in the bowl, it seemed to be mostly Clamato. I did like the flavoring of the broth but I thought the quality of the seafood could have been better. I also thought it was really weird that they served it with lemons and not limes. That kind of gave it a weird taste but I added some more hot sauce and that fixed it!\n\nEven though its not the best Mexican food I've had we still had a really good time. It's a pretty nice looking restaurant, I am really surprised that some of the other reviewers called it a dive?

One SUPER positive things I can say about Comedor Guadalajara is that they had some of the best rice and beans I have ever had! \nAll in all, I think my overall experience has to do with the Mexican food here tasting distinctly different than the Mexican food in Denver, both of which are as authentic as you can get, not this Tex Mex B.S.\nWhen I go back to Phoenix, would I come back here, probably not, I would want to try a different place to see if they have a different Phoenix, authentic Mexican food flare. If I was invited to go back and somebody was paying for me, I would definitely go, however; I would order something different.", "business_id": "BESmH-lmMm34_EefL8X9fQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-03-12", "type": "review"}

The one thing that stands out about Comedor (at least to me), is the sheer scale of their operation.  Huge parking lot, huge waiting area, huge restaurant, huge menu, you get the idea.  I've been told that depending on your arrival time, the wait can be epic.  On a Saturday at lunch, I came here with a friend and the wait was a pretty benign 10 minutes.  Once seated, I pretty much settled into a familiar groove as the menu, the service, and the flavors all reminded me of local Mexican establishments I'd frequented for years.\n\nWe were actually seated all the way in the back room.  Took us about three left turns to get there, but even the back room was packed.  That said, the place wasn't crazy noisy.  Very casual, comfortable atmosphere inside.  Our server was on her A game the whole meal as she was friendly, fast, and accommodating.  I had asked my friend what (if anything) was the signature dish of the house, but she couldn't really point to any one thing so I decided to go for a combo plate this go around.  Since this is a Sonoran Mexican food establishment, I figured a collection of familiar Sonoran favorites would be a appropriate.  Combination Plate #1 contains a cheese enchilada, beef taco, bean tostada, rice and beans.  For $9, I figured that would be a good way to peer into Comedor's own house take on these familiar staples.\n\nFood came out less than 10 minutes after we ordered.  The food was good, though you could be forgiven for thinking you were eating the exact same food with the exact same taste as other local Mexican establishments.  I suppose that's not necessarily a bad thing if you're like me and enjoy food at said establishments, but my friend was correct that none of the items really exceed any other place I've been.  My favorite item was the beef taco and it reminds me of one I've had at La Pi\u00f1ata.  The enchilada was also good and it reminded me of one I've had at Macayo's.  The beans and rice were also good and reminded me of those I've had at Mejico Cocina.  So all in all, the food was tasty and familiar, but you can absolutely find these staples at various Mexican establishments throughout the valley.  The big difference here is just a matter of scale.\n\nTotal cost for the combo plate, glass of water, tax and tip came to about $12.  The entire menu is pretty inexpensive (which likely explains the huge crowds here) and there's plenty of variety on the menu to choose from.  Next time I come here I'll probably give the seafood menu a try (though it'll probably remind me a lot of Mariscos Playa Hermosa).  So three stars for the food as it was good even though the cuisine didn't stand out too much from other similar valley establishments.  Four stars for the ambiance and atmosphere as the environment is super comfortable, family friendly and the restaurant is well kept inside and out.  And five stars for the service as they did a great job getting us seating pretty quickly despite the crowds, the server was excellent, and I had no trouble getting a parking spot at their huge lot.  So yeah, four stars is probably about right.

In fact many of the musicals are better than the touring Broadway shows that come to Gammage.\n\nThe theater itself is located in the Phoenix Art Museum complex, and while its not large, every seat in the house has a good view of the stage. Parking is free and readily available and with shows typically starting at 8:00 pm, its easy to get a nice bite to eat before the show.\n\nPrices for shows are also reasonable and season tickets are a great deal for the amount of entertainment you receive.\n\nIn short, Phoenix is lucky to have a performing arts organization of this quality and I'd encourage anyone who likes live theater to be sure and check it out.", "business_id": "X9ih9Iotd-VEZ8tTYfoarw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-03-13", "type": "review"}

I, on the other hand, was just excited about seeing this musical (and staying out late on a work night, Tee hee!)\n\nNow, I have to admit I started comparing this production against the movie. So I initially was thinking, \"Wait, Fontine was brunette\" and \"Hugh Jackman delivered that line differently\" before I allowed myself to be consumed by the musical. Because it truly was beautiful and masterfully played out on the modest sized stage. It received Terry's seal of approval. Bravo!\n\nA couple of things I think really contributed to my enjoyment of this musical were 1) the lovely senior citizens who were bused in, and their darling commentary during the production; and 2) killer seats, front row stage left.

When you enter from the north, you would expect a grand stage, as the entry is through a gateway in the Phoenix Art Museum, well-lit with colorful LEDs. Before the show, there's a courtyard with sculptures you can look at while you wait, and there's a bistro across from the theater where you can have dinner or a glass of wine before a show. Inside, however, the theater is quite small. The downside is that it means some shows can sell out quickly, but it also means you're pretty much guaranteed a good seat. Seating is \"cozy\" and intimate, which is mostly good for shows, but it's also my only real complaint. The chairs aren't very comfortable and they're packed in like those on an airplane.\n\nI typically go to see the Nearly Naked shows (no, not always in the nude) as they never disappoint. The shows are really good. Too good, sometimes, for a theater with limited seating. Oftentimes the shows sell out, so they can take some advance planning. They have seat cushions to make the chairs more comfortable, but I'm not sure if they belong to Nearly Naked only or for all companies performing there, as I haven't seen performances by any other company.\n\nPart of me wants to get opera glasses, but they are unnecessary at this theater. It would've looked funny to use those for \"Debbie Does Dallas: The Musical\" though. Still, I've seen \"Rent\", \"The Rocky Horror Show\", \"Evil Dead: The Musical\", \"Blood Brothers\", \"Killer Joe\", \"Times Square Angel\", \"The History of the Devil\", \"Valhalla\" and many others in this theater, and compared to others I've been to, you get a much better experience with top-quality productions in this smaller setting.", "business_id": "X9ih9Iotd-VEZ8tTYfoarw", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-05-25", "type": "review"}

You see they have a daily rotating specials menu and it so happens to feature the best veggie burrito (this is saying a lot coming from me, since I am obsessed with burritos and have lived in Phoenix for most of my life) for a little over $5 on Tuesdays! It is so massive.. if you know the size of a Chipotle burrito, imagine that, but doubled! Seriously, it consists of two very large tortillas, which are needed to whole the damn monster of a burrito together. This happens to insure that the contents don't spill out of the tortilla! Genius. I am fairly sure this burrito weighs more than most new born babies.. yes, that's even considering how all the hormones people consume today are making babies larger each year - this burrito would still out weight them my friends!\n\nAnyhow, the burrito is large enough to satisfy me for three complete meals. Awesome for $5. The guac that they make is top notch, and their rice is truly amazing. It all tastes very authentic, and I love that I can easily make it vegan since they don't add any secrets into their food. I just have to ask them to hold the cheese and sour cream, and they have never once slipped up on this! Which also keeps me coming back.\n\nOh, and the salsa bar is to die for! I am usually creeped out by salsa bars (think Baja Fresh - yuck) but they actually make some damn good salsas and usually have a bowl of chopped onions... I can never get enough. I think my personal favorite salsa is called something like Salsa Fresca - it's usually all the way to the right. Be sure to try it with your free chips.\n\nOn top of everything I love about this place is the fact that it is so close that I can walk there in a few minutes.

My friends had been going here forever for this special and we decided to make it a weekly thing. This has been going on for a while now and I've since tried all their tacos. I'm sad to say that most of them are just \"okay\". The one that stands out above the rest is the shredded beef taco. The beef is seasoned well and is tasty.\nOne time we went I didn't feel like eating tacos so I got their steak burrito. It was not very good. The rice that came with my combo was bland and barely edible. I actually left most of the burrito and all of the rice on my plate. I left feeling unimpressed and still hungry. Another time I got the chicken achiote salad. It was delicious. If you decide to eat here, it's probably the only thing I would recommend. Other than the daily specials they run, this place is pretty expensive for the quality. That salad and a bottled mexican Coca Cola ran me more than $10. Same thing for the burrito combo. The tacos seem to be the only economical choice they offer.\n\nNo matter how good the service is I don't think that I would ever give Chico's 5 stars, but they lost a 3rd star from me because the last 3 times I've been in there, the older lady who works at night on Tuesday has goofed up my order. Yes, 3 times. 3 weeks in a row my order was messed up. I don't know if maybe she is new and hasn't gotten the hang of it yet, or if she just wasn't paying attention to me when I was placing my order. I could understand more why my order was goofed if I had ordered something ridiculous with lots of substitutions, but I didn't. The last time my order was messed up it took them 15 mins AFTER they realized their mistake to remedy the situation. By that time my friends were all done eating the 3 tacos they had ordered. I don't mean to make it sound like a bigger deal than it is, but because my order was messed up so many times it makes it hard for me to want to continue giving them my business, especially since I'm not that crazy about their food in the first place. \n\nI'm sure I'll be back again, as tacos are really the highlight of an otherwise boring Tuesday. But if my order gets messed up again I think I'll just suggest to friends that we do taco Tuesday at another Mexican restaurant. That'll probably take some convincing though, they love this place.

What pushes Blue Fin over the top is the ownership. The little old Japanese lady who owns and runs the restaurant during lunch time is one of the absolute nicest people I've ever encountered. She welcomes every customer, and speaks to you in a genuine family like manner. She does not come across as fake or ass-kissish. I just get a calm, warm, and welcome feeling from this woman when I come in here.  It's not even just her either. Her staff always looks happy, and has run of the soda fountain, water, lemonade, etc. Everyone just seems to be happy.

The egg roll was good, but the sweet/sour sauce it came with was better than I've ever had.  Simple, sweet, and not gooey or gloopy.  \n\nOne of the owners (a wonderfully pleasant aging Japanese woman) came to my table and offered me chopsticks and hot mustard -- we had a delightful conversation wherein she explained that the chicken is hormone-free and char-grilled over pumice stones, and their sauces are home-made from family recipes.  They also offer many healthy options, including brown rice and vegetarian dishes, and NO MSG IS ADDED!!  She was a fantastic host.  \n\nEveryone seemed to be hurrying around, but they were all doing a great job keeping the customers happy by refilling drinks, delivering orders and making conversation with the people inside and outside the shop.\n\nAll in all, a great experience.

I was surprised by how not crowded it was on Saturday before the game. Also, the most vocal fans were the table of Mets fans sitting on the patio (I was wearing my Mets hat), so we cheered with them for a minute before going inside.  When we walked in there were less than a handful of people at the circular bar and maybe three tables were occupied.  For a game day, service was quick and our server was nice.\n\nI think the food at Coach and Willie's is solid bar food with large portions. TI've had the chicken tenders and fries which is good. The tenders have a very light breading which I appreciate. I've also tried the chicken nachos which were OK...at times I would only get chicken and no chips. I've had better chicken nachos at other sports bars.\n\nDuring the week, lunchtime service is a mess. Service is slow. Really slow actually. I don't mind taking longer lunches occasionally, but last time I went with five coworkers and we nearly had a two hour lunch at Coach and Willie's. That is much too slow in my opinion! Plus, seperating checks is a nightmare there, so my advice is if you go with a group, just bring cash.\n\nThere are plenty of TVs and when my husband and I met for lunch there in March, I asked for the TV closest to us to be turned to the Ohio State Big 10 basketball tournament game which they did willingly. I definitely appreciated it.  However, this past Saturday, did every TV need to be on the Kentucky Derby...and it wasn't even the Derby, it was like the \"red carpet\" event hosted by Molly Sims. Blah, I would have much preferred some baseball.\n\nCoach and Willie's is an easy walk to Chase Field and I believe after Dbacks games, they have a reverse happy hour. I'm not sure I would go back again before a game though.

Its right around the corner from Chase Field, and neither of us had been here before.  We had an excellent time together at Coach and Willies, but I think we both left with a feeling of something to be desired by this place.  Here's my take on the place:\n\nI dont think this place is bad.  I just think its not the greatest.  Scott and I did enjoy our time here, BUT, I think we both found the same things annoying about it.\n\nFirst, I feel like theres a conflict of decorating.  I feel like theres two completely different themes going on here, and they both clash with one another.  Part of it seems like it wants to be a nicer resturant....the other part wants to be a sports bar.  Neither one compliments each other.  \n\nWhen you walk in, theres a great patio area for dining.  Loved it!  But, then when you walk in, and kind of walk around, it shows signs of trying to be a sports bar.  The bar itself is set really low.  Lower then the tables themselves.  Heavy marble looking bar tops, with chairs.  \n\nAt one point Scott and I counted 15 (YES 15!) flat screen TVs!  I will say, there was one particular TV in our area that I noticed that had amazing reception.  It was probably one of the better flat screens I have seen!  \n\nTo my benefit, I ordered the half nachos.  The server ended up bringing me out a full plate of nachos (bonus!) and I was happy!  Food here is so so.  \n\nI feel like this place is a place I would probably bring my parents to, but it really didnt blow me away.", "business_id": "j8nyAaN_w5t6wYv-ni23sg", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-04-27", "type": "review"}

But it was fun to visit the ballpark and we did have a good time.\n\nWithin walking distance so I didn't have to move my truck this place seemed to have the greatest appeal based on reviews.\n\nMy impression was of a restaurant that happened to have, what looked like a very uncomfortable, low bar and a nice outside patio.  And also a whole bunch of TVs.  The sort of place dad could take the whole family for dinner and position himself to see the game he would rather have stayed home and watched.  But it's in the wrong neighborhood for that.  I only saw one couple on the patio as it was a bit chilly.  There may have been heaters but I didn't notice them.\n\nThe food certainly was not exciting.  I had a filet mignon sandwich ($14.00) and chose fries over the salad on the recommendation of our server.  Fries were soggy and limp.  He must never have tried them.  Amy B had 1/2 order of nachos w/beef ($6.50) and they gave her a full order at the 1/2 order price rather than make her wait for the correct order to be made.  The food was edible but neither of us felt motivated to continue past the no longer hungry point.  And neither of us were encouraging the other to try what we were eating. \n\nWe got started off a bit on the wrong foot as the sign said \"wait to be seated\", which we started to do.  The hostess was also the waitress for the front of the house and told us to grab seats at the bar and I said we wanted a table and stood there as she wandered off to check the IDs of some folks that had just ordered at a table (cute young women should know they are going to get carded and not have their IDs buried at the bottom of a 15lb piece of luggage they call a purse).  The waitress/hostess did finally look up and realize we were not moving and told us to grab a table and someone would find us.  It took roughly 10 minutes for our server to show the first time but after that he was there just as much as needed.  During that time I noticed Fat Tire was on tap so I ordered the 20oz glass ($7.00).  Amy had a diet cola which was refilled twice just as she emptied it.  Considering we arrived with the after game crowd I think we got really good service and I would say at it's peak the restaurant inside was about 2/3 full and dwindling as we were there\n\nOverall it is not a bad place and I would go again if invited but I want to try some other places in the area too on my infrequent trips downtown.", "business_id": "j8nyAaN_w5t6wYv-ni23sg", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-04-29", "type": "review"}

Each time has been a complete disappointment. It is sad because they have great food and I believe this restaurant would do much better if the service was up to par. My past visits were with the company. Excited to have our team building lunch at a downtown restaurant near the office is very convenient for our office. Sadly our office has not been happy with the service the two times we went as a team. This restaurant offers a variety of options to choose from for all types of diners. Salads, Sandwiches, Soups, Pizza and much much more. Though it seems the wait staff brings the place down. \n\n1st securing a table ahead of time has not worked out for us both times because the restaurant did not have our reservation. Though the good news is both times we were able to get seated right away. The bad news is not only did our food take a long time majority of the orders were wrong. 2nd Giving them the benefit of the doubt I went in to place a to go order today. I placed my call order over the phone and was told It would take 15-20 minutes. After having my order repeated back to me and giving the correct spelling of my name I get to the restaurant to pay the tab to only find out my order was not even entered. The bartender tells me that the person who took my order forgot one of the items. I have trouble understanding this when I ordered only two items that were off the basic lunch special menu. To be proactive I paid my order ahead of time to find my name spelled wrong on the receipt. This again surprised me as the person who took the order repeated it back to me. After waiting 17 minutes for my order I find out from the bartender my order was made wrong. This was his fault as he entered it in wrong. He refunded me my money and I left because I could not wait another 15-20minuetes for a to go order. I am hesitant to give them another try at this point. I am not going to even risk catering for the office because part of my job is to order food for the office as the office I work in is a training center that provides food. If they cannot get a simple order right I cannot imagine how a large catering order for fifty people would look like. \n\nI will add there is patio seating, private room, happy hour specials, WiFi and free parking during lunch.", "business_id": "j8nyAaN_w5t6wYv-ni23sg", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-04-26", "type": "review"}

We are actually there because the wait everywhere else is too long, and we were forced to look to you by default.  Restaurant staffing is variable, meaning you are allowed to schedule adequate staff for an event night.\n\nWe rolled in, took a look around, checked out the menu and rolled out.  Then we found out the wait at Cooperstown, which was wall to wall with people, was an hour.  So we rolled back to Jacksons.  The wait for food, when the place was at only 1/3 of their capacity was an hour.  For food.  For bar food.  They have 8 items on the menu, most of which are fried.  Has it ever occurred to their staff to, umm, I unno, PREPARE?  We found an outside seat, and I meandered up to the outside bar.  15 minutes later, I finally got served.  I kept my mouth shut, because I watched one of the bartenders berate a woman for complaining about the wait.  Granted, she was a bitch, but a bitch with a  valid point.  They were only serving the people at the ends of the bar, completely ignoring the 30 or so SITTING in the middle.  \n\n$12 for 2 vodka Red Bulls, a fair price.  After learning about the wait, we decided to forgo food, but there was another 15 minute wait when I went back to the cash only outside bar.  So much for them remembering decent tippers.  \n\nThe seating arrangement outside seems weird, awkward and unbalanced, and it only gets worse when you head inside.  I hear they have \"servers\" but since I only saw one looking harried inside, that could be more of an urban legend than fact.  They could easily add more tables inside and rearrange the outside to seat more people comfortably, but given that they can't handle a preconcert crowd, they shouldn't unless they hire some experienced, friendly staff.\n\nI won't be going back anytime soon.", "business_id": "5XIvwfbIa-vuFEkkeCQ6kQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-03-28", "type": "review"}

Why do you have to be so unaccommodating?\n\nFirst of all, finding Fate takes some work.  When we turned off the main road we wondered if we were completely lost since it didn't look like the kind of neighborhood you would find a restaurant, it was very residential.  As we drove by it my husband actually thought it was an abandoned building.  There is a small parking lot off to the left that fits about 5 cars or so. The inside of the restaurant is pretty cool, with exposed brick and local funky artwork.\n\nWe went with a rather large group of 12.  One of the girls made a reservation ahead of time and they nicely set up a long table for the 12 of us.  (Note: long table not conducive to talking when in a large group)  About 8 of us arrived all at the same time but were told that we needed the whole party to be seated.  It's a small place and the 8 of us just standing in the door next to the table was a little awkward to say the least; especially considering there was only one other party dining at the time.  We stood and waited around until finally they told us we could sit down.\n\nThe food price is very reasonable and the selection is Pan-Asian, leaning heavily towards Thai.  We each placed our orders and one of the members of our party asked to have half of her entree boxed up before it even got to the table.  They couldn't do that.  They gave her a take out box and she had to do it herself.  How hard is it for them to just put half of it aside?  The food was pretty good, however, and I enjoyed my Thai coconut curry.\n\nAll in all the whole experience was unremarkable, bordering on frustrating.  The food wasn't nearly good enough to justify the poor service- although our waitress suddenly became very accommodating and friendly when we handed her cash + 4 credit cards and told her we were giving her a $50 tip on a $200 check.  Maybe we should have told her that when we had gotten there!", "business_id": "VsO_rhXi5lgbaGxNwoEZsQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2007-05-08", "type": "review"}

The tofu is always perfectly crispy, the dishes (especially the chow fun) are excellent and the drink menu is fun and creative.\nSo why 3 stars?\nSimply, this place has developed a really bad attitude. Fate is like that friend in middle school who suddenly decided she was \"too cool\" for you, and started moving away from  you at the lunch table and then sabotaging your cheer leading routines.\n\nLast time we came here, the bar next door to it had just opened -- so we made some allowances for slowness -- but STILL. We made reservations and still had to wait an hour. That's ridiculous. Then we had just purchased expensive drinks and were not allowed to bring them to the restaurant. No apologies, nothing.\nThat particular night, after an hour, we were still table-less and  about to leave, as we had seen plenty of couples who were apparently *friends* with the waitstaff (and who had come much later than we had) get seated, while we waited... and waited.. .and waited... Finally, the owner of the restaurant saw us complaining, recognized my husband's friend, and found us seating.\n\nNow, a few days ago, we called to make reservations and dared to ask if they had something earlier than 9:30. What did we get? A snappy, smart ass response.\n\nNo thanks, Fate. There are plenty of other places opening up downtown and we'll start to take our business there.

Several folks asked that their food be prepared mild.  When the food came, every dish on the table was nuclear hot.  I can handle hot food, but this was on par with Los Dos Molinos.  When we mentioned this to our server, she told us that it all has to do with the peppers they have on hand at any given time.  She patiently explained that the heat levels of the peppers vary (Duh!), but the chef always uses the same amount of pepper and never tastes the food.  Therefore, the heat level varies wildly and there is no consistency.  Frankly, any chef who doesn't taste their food needs to get out of the kitchen and into another line of work.\n\nThe concept of the menu with the various preparations and the choice of proteins is great.

The prices are lower than what would be considered 'reasonable' and the service is quick and attentive but not overbearing.\n\nHowever, the REAL reason to visit The Paisley Violin is for the incredible ambiance, whether you sit inside in its darkened labyrinth of art, books, and counter snacks, or outside on its expansive, heavily shaded patio, complete with an artistic fountain and 6 tiny and freshly brightened bungalow houses in a pseudo shopping district right there in their back yard.  According to our server one house will contain a flower shop; one, a bookstore; and the another, a tobacco shop.  The other three are TBD.  It is a brilliant concept, which makes their back patio seem infused with organic commerce and street life, but without being invasive or 'busy'.  I absolutely cannot wait for these places to open, sipping a chai latte with a shot of espresso (my gf's signature drink called a 'dirty chai latte') and gazing at these magnificent store fronts, each painted in a wide palate.  \n\nOne other note: The Paisley Violin is no longer BYOB, as they are awaiting the lead-legs of the city to approve, get this, their LIQUOR LICENSE!  Fans of The Paisley Violin will appreciate that spirits will now be available -- although bringing your own vino to the back patio seemed like one hell of a bargain to rent their space for the evening.  \n\nI am eagerly awaiting when alcohol will be allowed back on the premises because this place will be the gem of downtown.", "business_id": "IceZ4BtTz76eppjNWm-c6A", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-05-04", "type": "review"}

It was all good. The rice, the Mongolian beef, the chow mein.....and the best part is the huge egg rolls....a fatty's (I mean foodie's dream.) It was a feast I will always remember....my realization since the last best chinese food experience in Seattle Washington is this ...\"If you feel you shouldn't be there....you should.

She got half our table drinks and then disappeared. Eventual she came back with the others, but she could've fit them all on one tray. A few more minutes and we had some tasty albeit boring looking chips. They were so large that they could only get so many in each bowl. The salsa was terrible. Completely bland with little taste. Mostly it was chunks of tomatoes and some juice. Boring. After way too long our food came. No silverware or anything, just the food. I ate most of my beans with a knife (it looked clean!) I found on my table. We asked for sourcream and silverware. She brought the sour cream but nada on the whole silverware thing. Eventually someone found me a fork (I think from a place setting behind me) and I dug in. Great Chile Relleno! very tasty, and I think the sourcream made it for me. At the end of the meal, the waitress did agree to split the check between each of us to her defense, but overall it was a very average experience like you'd expect from a white-washed pseudo Mexican chain.", "business_id": "-lOSaCuBRAvX5JBifx-EMw", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-04-17", "type": "review"}

Being vertically challenged, I was pleased that the booth bench was high in relation to the table level, but it certainly could have had a lot more cushion.  \n\nWe were brought drinks, had orders took, and tortilla chips brought promptly. I really liked the chips. They were paper thin, very crispy, and were glistening with fresh, hot, fryer oil. The pico de gallo type salsa also tasted very fresh and home-made, but it could have done better with a few less chopped onion chunks in it. Upon request, we were also brought a bowl of more picante salsa, which had the flavor of roasted red chilies. Nice.\n\nOur orders, both from the lunch menu, were also served quite quickly.  My husband had a cheese enchilada/chicken taco combo (~$6.25) which came with black beans (on request), rice, and a cabbage garnish. I didn't even see the taco since my husband devoured it so fast, but his enchilada was swimming in a mixture of cheese & red sauce which he said was pretty tasty. \n\nI had a chicken enchilada (~$6.75). There were nice chunks of breast in there that actually tasted like chicken, unlike some other mexican joints where the meats all have the same texture & flavor. The enchilada was drizzled with a nice green chili sauce. The spanish rice was a little bit nondescript, but was more edible than some other restaurants'.  Mine was also served with black beans as requested, and a cabbage garnish. There were also more big chunks of onion in the garnish. I'm not an onion hater, don't get me wrong, but I'm sure after this feast, nobody would want to be within four feet of me. If I was on lunch break from one of the nearby offices, I'd probably request they go easy on the onions, lest I offend my work-mates back at the office.\n\nAlthough I arrived with a huge appetite, I was stuffed after devouring everything on my plate.

Sometimes instead of the Baja Ensalada with Chicken, I ask for Grilled Shrimp! Other favorites include the grilled shrimp or veggie tacos (not on the menu, but they'll make 'em).

But with us, we aren't going so much for the food - as for the sports.  \n\nLiving in the downtown/South Mountain area, there aren't many sports bars as it is.  Then you narrow down which ones are showing the events you want, and we often end up here.  Especially for boxing!  One of the things I like about Hooters, and this one in particular, is that if you want to see - you have full view access.  But the TVs are high enough that if you could care less, you don't have to be staring at a television.  The problem is, it's Hooters.  If you aren't looking at the TV you have to be careful what it looks like you're looking at.  Is there such a thing as viewer's guilt?  Maybe there should be.  \n\nSounds bad, but totally honestly - I just feel really bad for the girls who have to walk outside on a chilly night.  The comments that they have to deal with can be really awful.  There should be some kind of a \"Bad comment\" jar, like the old-school \"Bad word\" jars when you cussed.

These guys were sitting behind us at different tables and started lightly arguing; ten minutes later it escalated to punches and beer being thrown literally over my head with the cooks and managers coming out with the cops on their way - subsequently slowing our already slow food by another 10 minutes.\n\nLastly, I will say this - DO NOT bring your kids here.

We arrived on a Sunday afternoon after a visit to the Phoenix Art Museum.  We ordered a BLT salad off the lunch menu and a manicotti dish.  We also included a cup of the minestrone soup for a buck.  The salad was good and was accompanied by fresh, hot bread.  The minestrone soup was outstanding.  The salad and soup were brought out early, as we requested, and we had ample time to complete the salad before our entree arrived.  The manicotti was fine and a good enough portion size that we had to box some.   So far, a good dining experience.\n\nThen the bill arrives.  The salad was 8.50 and then entree was full price.  We questioned the bill, as the \"lunch menu\" said the salad would be 5.99 and the entree 1.50 off.  The server actually apologizes and says he'll have the manager correct the mistake.  Then he comes back and tells us \"Sorry, manager says lunch prices only apply Mon-Fri\".  Nowhere on the menu does it say lunch only applies Monday through Friday, and we were never told.  I didn't press the issue, paid the bill and off we go.  \n\nWhat could have been an overall pleasant experience ruined by what is essentially a sham.

It gives me that homey feeling like a mom and pop store instead of the chain restaurant that it is. I like how whatever entr\u00e9e you order from the menu; you can get a complete meal from it.  Each entr\u00e9e comes with a drink, bread, soup or salad, and their spumoni ice cream for dessert.  However, if you want \"Italian\" food, you're not going to get it here.  It's a very Americanized version of Italian food.  They do have all the classics: the pastas, lasagnas, etc.  I've been here several times and tried a few of their dishes.\n\nSpaghetti Vesuvius:  cute name to start off.  Spicy chicken sausage and meatballs with mushroom.  I didn't think it was that spicy, but it was extra salty.  It's a very flavorful dish, however the individual tastes are all mushed together.  The noodles are a bit tough for me; perhaps undercooked.  However some people like it a bit tough.  \n\nGourmet Jumbo Crab Ravioli:  There's not a lot of ravioli pieces in the dish.  The edges that were not covered in the pesto alfredo sauce was dry.  I did like that they used fresh crab meat in the ravioli.  The creamy sauce was not bad and it wasn't too overpowering in my mouth.  It was able to taste pesto sauce and still enjoy the texture of the crab.  \n\nBaked Lasagna:  This is the best of the 3 I've had.  It has 4 kinds of cheese, ground beef, and pork.  First of all they gave you a huge piece of lasagna. Then they topped it with mounds of marinara sauce.  You may have to remove some of the sauce if it's too much for you.  The noodles were cooked tender enough for my taste, but it was still able to hold its shape.  And the meat was blended well with all the flavors of the dish.  \n\nI do like the cute little serving they have of the spumoni ice cream.  It's a great blend of pistachio, chocolate and strawberry.  And it's just the right amount after a large meal.  Maybe one of these days I'll go back just to try their chocolate desserts.  \n\nIf you like an American spin on Italian food, then you would like this place.  It's a convenient place to eat after shopping at the mall and their quick service is great if you're crunched for time.

Usually a sandwich place will have one veggie sandwich which is just \"all the veggies on bread.\"  You can come here every day of the week and get a different variety of veggie sandwich.\n\nThe meat sandwiches also show some originality, though if you look at the menu, it's really the same four sandwiches over and over with different meats.

Karim's is a small cobbler shop right off of Jefferson, and compared to other eateries it does offer a more limited selection. BUT, the selection they do offer is great. They have a couple different combo options for fish fry as well as the general burger and other eats. It has got a significant southern-down-home-cooking feel to it, as you would expect. \n\nI chose a 2 piece catfish combo plate and a medium order of Okra Gumbo. Yes, Okra Gumbo. It was actually really good, but the cup they put it in was very small. I always ask what size bowl you get, but we were in such a hurry I never thought to ask, so it's partially my fault. The catfish pieces though, were AMAZING. They had some awesome varieties of different southern hot sauces and I dabbed that on the catfish, which brought even more life to the dish. It was cooked just right, not too soggy, not too dry. My dad chose an Angus burger combo and was very happy with the choice, and my fiance opted for the chili dog, which she woofed down, haha.\n\nAll in all, its a great option when everything else is crowded. They have a small kitchen, so you will have to wait for the staff to catch up on a busy weekend when going to the game. They pump out a lot of good food it looks like, so if you want some fried fish on game day, head on over to Karim's!

Several years ago one of my co-workers brought El Tahoe back clean after he drove around a wildland fire for 14 days.  Think dust.  Clouds of it.  Dust pounded to talcum by hundreds of passing tires, then wet to fine sticky mud by water trucks.  The car had been washed many times by a well known car wash now out of business.  It never looked as good as the day it got washed at Los Olivos.  \n\nRichard was out prescribed burning last fall filling drip torches in the back of  the same Tahoe.  Drip toch fuel is diesel and gasoline mixed. It spilled on the carpet, soaking some spots.  Then the dust stuck to it.  Los Olivos washed ithe torch fuel out.  The car smells only of smoke now.  I can't stand those car scents.  But we had many choices.  I just can't drive around in a rig smelling of pina colada and wood smoke. \n\nEl Tahoe just came back after weeks of toiling through Interstates 17 and 40 road de-icer, collecting dust and mud samples across the Colorado Plateau, and sitting under a tree hundreds of beautifully singing birds use for a night roost.  Los Olivos took it in and turned it out about as nice looking as that car will ever be.  Of course, if I did the washing, every last speck of dirt and mud would be cleaned from everywhere.  I'd take a Q-Tip to the window down near the defroster vents to get all the accumulated little vapors off the glass.  But I know where El Tahoe will go and it looks better than fine now.

I informed them those scratches weren't there prior to my going to get the car washed, but they were emphatic that the scratches had to be there, for one of their employees wouldn't or couldn't do that. Yeah, I know, it's just interior scratches to the X3, but we've worked hard to have a luxury vehicle and take pride in owning it and I strongly feel they should have owned up to their responsibility and have taken care of this mishap with their insurance.

The fine points of excellence are up to the franchisee.  \n\nIt looks like people having the worst experiences come in for lunch.  We tried Zoes for an evening meal.  Nicely styled with an attractive glass wall on the north facing McDowell Street.  Outdoor dining.  \n\nWe got a chicken kabob and a hummus and salad plate.  Both came with a haystack of mixed green salad with onion, Greek olives and feta.  That's fine with me.  The health survey my insurance company bribed me to fill out determined I don't eat enough greens and fruits.  Score one for Zoe's there. Each table had a bottle of Greek dressing so salads are seasoned to taste.  Mine also came with a tiny tub of Tzatziki.\n\nThe chicken kabob was good.  Chicken, green pepper, onion, cherry tomato.  I found out I like cherry tomatoes much more when they're grilled.  Apparently my family has a gene for fresh tomato aversion.  The grilled cherry T's were very good, the chicken not overcooked, and the rest of the veggies very good.  \n\nThe amount of hummus, about 3/4 cup, was decent, the pita was served as small wedges.  The taste was hummus and pita.  Not Great, not Terrible.  \n\nOur beverages were endless ice tea.  \n\nThe bit of the meal that was unprofessional in the food service industry was a salad core in Sweet D's greens pile.

When looking for a place, I liked the contemporary feel of many of the loft options in the area but I really wanted something less industrial, more warm and cozy. I fell I got that with my apartment. \nThey have several apartment sizes from 600ish sq ft loft spaces to 1100ish sq ft 2br/2ba units. It is a gated community and the gates are only open when the front office is open between 9am and 6pm. Most of the tenants I have seen are Urban professionals, students, and some young families. \nI decided on one of the largest floor plans, dual master with 1 and 3/4 bath, approx 1100sq ft. I am on the first level and really can't hear the neighbors much through the walls like other places I have been. I have a nice sized patio with access through large patio doors from the dining area and one of the bedrooms, and a small storage area, plus a detached garage. The management is nice and I enjoy going in to pick up a movie or 3, and occasionally they host social hours for the tenants. \nInitially hesitant with the proximity to ASU's downtown campus (didn't want a bunch of rowdy college students running around at all hours partying at the pool like I had at a previous apt experience in the north valley), I have found it to be quite peaceful during the week and it is super quiet on weekends. Sure occasionally on First Fridays or when you have a lot going on downtown you can hear some party goers but as far as I have seen and heard they are either at Alta across the street or walking outside the complex to get to their cars or a local club. \nI love the convenience to my office (6 blocks).

Don't expect to have a thick and creamy mac and cheese here.  You won't be getting that.  The pasta is then topped with the expected dry piece of blackened chicken.  Why expected?  It's expected because I have literally been to HR's all over the country, on both coasts, and every single one serves dry chicken.  I guess that's what they teach at the HR School of Cooking.  I guess they just put more focus on music than food.  Who knows.\n\nWhy I gave HR three stars I will never know.  Why I keep going back is certainly beyond my capacity to understand.

The circular design is really bad for traffic flow, seating, wait staff movement, and sound.  This HRC lacks a true performance space which is terribly lame.  The bar is off to the side instead of being in the middle like almost every other HRC.  The shop is way too small and the merchandise is pretty lame.  This HRC is always so loud that it is impossible to have a conversation with your group.  \n\nThe other problem I have with this HRC stems from an incident where my wife and I went before a game.  She left her hat on the seat when we left and we remembered about 100 yards down the road.  Turned around, went back in, and told the hostess.  She said she would check and then she came back and said they didn't find anything.

It wasn't very busy, so I figured I would sit at the bar. The two servers/bartenders were super nice and friendly. So was management that I spoke with so I have nothing negative to say about the service. It was quick and friendly. \n\nBut the menu! It sucks! It is way overpriced! And nothing I had was good. For $10 I got the worst plate of nachos I have ever had! Sure it was big and plenty to share and even more to throw out, but it was awful. Glad I didn't pay another $4 for meat because it was so bad that even meat could not improve it! The beans had no flavor, the jalapeno provided the only bit of flavor to the plate. The salsa was pure trash- more live crushed tomatoes and no flavor! You would think in the SW they could at least adapt and go with a better salsa! \n\nMy other pick was potato skins, I love the things. The guy next to me ordered them, $9 for a half plate of the tiny-est potatoes I think anyone could skin! I think there were 6 halves but certainly not more than 8 halves, all the size of a child's palm! \n\nI had a frozen drink called a Pickled Tink $6.75. Awful! Did not come completely mixed and barely pink. Tasted overwhelmingly of the coconut flavor. It was frozen and slushy and weak enough to feed to a kid. If I had one with me I would have let him/her have it, seriously. \n\nIt was my birthday as was maybe 4 other unfortunate souls to be eating there. They gave us each a Sundae with fudge on the whip cream and a small candle. They shouted at the patrons to to shoot Happy Birthday at each of us at separate times and clap. It was pretty weak by the third attempt to get participation. \nIt was nice of my servers to surprise and acknowledge me. Though I was not looking for any handout or commotion. I had a few bites of the sundae and it was even awful! The ice cream was full of ice crystals! \n\nSo over all I will have to disagree with others and say Applebee's food is much, much better and not as expensive! To Applebee's I'll return but to the HRC, this is my last visit. \n\nYears ago I went to the Phoenix HRC when it was on Camelback, if I remember the street correctly. The building & bar was more impressive as was the decor and so was the food. I went on a birthday then too, I wonder why they moved to this location? The entry is nothing eye catching or grand as it was then. In fact if the Light Rail driver had not announced it i would not have seen it as I had not seen it on previous trips to and pass the area. \n\nBefore this stop at the HRC, I had been a fan of the place for years. Had once spent many evenings at the Boston HRC when I lived in MA and had fond memories of the old Phoenix location as well.

It's located across from the stadium so very convenient on game nights, but also close to the PHX Convention Center where our conference was. \n\nWe went at lunch and there was little to no crowd, so we were seated immediately by a great guy named Cody who works in the gift shop as well as waits on customers. \n\nIt was my friend's first visit to Hard Rock and Cody made it special for both of us. He gave us lots of details about the food. She ordered the chicken strip appetizer and he told her that it was kind of spicy- she's not a spicy fan, so he had the cook serve her the kid's version of the chicken tenders instead. I got the grilled veggie sandwich, which was on texas toast and had mushrooms and veggies and lots of cheese. Mine also came with fries, but you can upgrade to a salad or onion rings. I wasn't super hungry, so my friend and I shared the fries. \n\nOur food was great, and we also bought some gifts. HRC even has a few clearance items and they have cute shirts, including ladies cut. The shirts were some of the best PHX souvenirs we saw for the price. The service was quick and we were finished and back at our conference without having to wait too long, and of course the atmosphere was typical Hard Rock Cafe with lots of great music. \n\nI would definitely return to this Hard Rock Cafe.", "business_id": "gkv2XvXpFgiq4Bb2XK7YmQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-05-22", "type": "review"}

I have also attended previous Women's Expo events, mainly because either it's a free admission with a coupon or a meet & greet with the keynote speakers: actress Melissa Gilbert of \"The Little House on the Prairie\" who was promoting her books at the Barnes & Noble booth (spring '14), and celebrity chef Sandra Lee of Food Network who was promoting her cocktails line at her own booth (yesterday).\nI will lean more towards reviewing the Expo since it's the most recent.\nI enjoyed looking around and checking out the numerous vendors, and the convention did a fine job fitting them in and allowing the public extra room to walk around and eat at- and, keeping it clean and litter-free.  The restrooms were also clean and easy to find, both inside the arena and lobby.  I think most of the crowd is because attendees wanted the free makeovers and samples (which likely explains the long line before admission).  The booths were selling or demonstrating their wares geared towards women.  However, there were some vendors that had nothing to do with women theme.  Since this type of event is often crowded, I wish there would be a no-stroller policy i.e. the scrapbooking expo I attended did have that and boy, was it so much easier to move around.  Parents, sorry, but please leave your kids at home and get a babysitter.  My patience has run thin as it's rude to bump your strollers at my heel (that hurts, damn it) with no apology- these events are no place for kids (they're either tired, grouchy, being jostled, asleep in their strollers, or even sick and don't care for these type of events).  This was supposed to be sort of a getaway to be pampered.  I liked the ABC cake decorating store booth- they gave away samples as a thanks for watching their demos.  My favorite was actually the fashion show, of course!  I didn't eat at the concession area as they charged way too much- $10 for a small 'gourmet' tuna casserole plate?  $8 for a small sandwich.  $4 for bottled water.  I'm sure they probably taste good- I even noticed the staff thoughtfully wearing gloves to prepare food.  I brought my own bottled water (you can refill at the water fountain) and ate well at home before I showed up to tide me over- it worked ;)  Convention security was present to guide you around if you needed directions or got lost.  The overall ambiance was decent, just sometimes the air conditioner got colder than expected (esp. where the fashion show / keynote speaking was at) so if you get cold easily, bring your sweater.  I like it cold though and appreciate it since the crowd can definitely heat up a room this big that fast ;)  I appreciate that the attendees and convention staff were polite and got along and kept within the peace, which made the event that much more memorable.\nI look forward to attending various events at the convention in the future and appreciate supporting downtown Phoenix activities.

We could have (wisely) each eaten a half , each our drink and chips and eaten for $4.00 each. Not a bad lunch at all. I returned and got a turkey melt. Same generous sandwich, nicely toasted with cheese melting over the turkey and tomato but not pleasing to my tastebuds as the chicken salad. Central Cafe serves morning coffee, has a fountain of Coke products and an ice-tea pot on-scene. There's pastry cases with a variety of muffins, pies, brownies, and whatever else is pastry of the day. Today they had middle eastern date cookies. \n\nThey've got a cold case with salads, fruit juices, yogurt and other snack foods needed cold to survive. Next to it is the chips and candy section. No Ice cream freezer though. \n\nThe seating and eating area has two flat-panel TVs, several cafe tables and a sofa (couch? divan? settee?). When I was there, One TV had the news, another had a movie zoomed in on a very good actor shot in the leg with an arrow dealing with the agonies of breaking it off, pulling it out, bleeding like Fossil Creek and likely running away. He was in stomach turning agony the whole time I waited for my lunch, so I don't know if he got away or not. Kind of anticlimactic to be killed by another flying object rather than escaping, being carried away by a damsel in distress, saved by John Wayne or the Cavalry. So it goes in movie land. I suspect workplace refugees may hang out here, waiting for their meals. It's really good to stay informed you know. One never knows when they'll be called on to put on an agonized face or report the latest weather. \n\nYou get to the Central Cafe through the lobby and taking the stairs or elevator to the basement. There's also a mail box down there. \n\nI think the Central Cafe is worth a visit. See what you like on the menu, what cowboy is dying on the TV, or who Oprah's got on, and try the food.

The rolls suck too.  They had Ice Cream, but no Water Ice - not very Philly.  All they had was a bad steak, some wise chips, and a couple of Tastykakes.  For anyone from Philly: This place wouldn't be considered the Best of Frankford let alone the whole city.

I live just a couple of miles away so this place is convenient for me to go in without an appt.  Had I read Jenn's review beforehand I would not have come here/  That being said....................\nThis is my third time here and each time I have found it to be a nice, clean environment .  Each of my 3 visits found the air fresh and free of the usual chemical nail product smell, which really nauseates me and causes my eyes to burn.  I had a manicure and pedicure done this last visit and because business has been slow ,due in part to the light rail construction, (and maybe , in part , to Jenn's post), I received both services at the same time. I was in and out in 40 minutes.\nWith the exception of one, very young, and loud tech, the rest of the  techs were very nice and seemed to want to make sure I was comfortable.  Massage Chairs are pretty comfortable and each chair has two different remotes- one to move the chair back and forth, the 2nd to provide various types of massage.  \nMan - what a massage! the balls (or whatever they use in the chair) felt incredible (these things move up and down your body from neck to lower back and switch off between different types of massage).  You can also set it for just one continuous type of massage. \n\nThe only drawback, and for me, this is a big one, is the music.  Apparantly,  they put on whatever they want to hear , which is usually not very relaxing.  Twice I asked if they would please put something soothing on instead of the techno beat thing they had blaring from the speaker.  They obliged me and I received a quiet  \"Thank You\" from the two other customers there.  This last visit they had music from their homeland playing which was bearable plus fragrant incense which did help relax me.  The price is right - $32 for both a manicure and pedicure (I skipped the sea salt and callous removal options which are extra).  Technically, they do a good job and, each time I have been there, they take care to sterilize and clean the instruments, chairs, etc. \n\nOne interesting note:  While talking to a couple of techs, they informed me that many of them  were nurses or teachers back in their homeland but because they are still learning to speak english they do not qualify for similar positions here in the States. One tech who was not busy was practicing her English using some type of language CD with her headphones on and a study guide).  You go girl!\n\n I have been seen within 5 minutes of waiting each time. \nIf someone else has a good recommendation for a nail salon that is a good bargain and is within midtown/downtown phoenix,  let me know as I am open to trying new places.\nRC", "business_id": "NdHDqKjNyeocNRShjUPyZQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-03-01", "type": "review"}

One spoke English quite well, as I experienced as she loudly talked on her phone my entire pedicure at the desk next to the chair I was directed to sit in.  The other, who performed my services (I also had my eyebrows waxed) did not speak English well, but was very nice and nervous when she did.\n\nThe salon itself was clean, but definitely used.  The massage chair was nice and comfortable, but you could definitely tell it had seen better days.\n\nThe pedicure was nice.  I was VERY nervous because all of her tools came out of a caboodle box and went back into the same box...no sanitizing solution.  I was certain I was going to get an infection but couldn't get the English-speaking girl off the phone long enough to say anything, and I knew my pedicurist would not understand me.  I had the callous scrubber done, and it was with a tool I'd never seen before...looked like a large lemon zester.  Seemed to work okay, but didn't work as well or last as long as others have in the past.  No pumice stone either.  The massage and scrub were nice, but the entire time, the girl was focused elsewhere.  Not sure if it was just because we had nothing to talk about or that something else was on her mind.  My toes turned out WONDERFUL.  She even painted little flowers on them for me.  2 weeks later and they still look fabulous.  No chipping, breaking, or messes yet.  No infections either.  No bleeding like others have complained about.  No toe-dividers though, so I had to be especially careful.\n\nThe waxing was fine.  Again with the same girl, so no communication.  Their waxing room is in a closet in the back.  The table is covered with the same towel from person to person.  My eyebrows turned out nicely, but 2 weeks later and I still am slightly broken out with reddened bumps across my forehead.

I have eaten at every single lunch food place surrounding this office at least once. My favorite is Ichi Ban.  I just can't afford it as often as I want.\n\nI have also eaten sushi at several valley locations and I return to Ichi Ban every time. Why? Becuase they make the rolls very tight. The rice is perfect and the flavor is fresh. I can't stand it when rolls are sloppy and the rice falls apart or the fish slides right off. The portions of fish per piece is just right and the flavors blend so nicely. The presentations look good, especially that Dec. 29th roll. I have never had the fish smell I've encountered in other joints. Even the octopus is fresh and the wasabi is hot. \n\nTheir tempura is perfect, the gyoza make it possible to bring my child who isn't as adventurous. I have never gotten sick there. I have frequently gotten full. I agree they are too attentive on the drink orders and seem to be in a hurry to take away your miso bowl, which is partly why they lose a star. Let a person eat!  The other reason was when I ordered my daughter some lemonade I got Endamame. I realize they may sound similar, but it was a drink order. They had good endamame though so I was ok. The third reason is that they close between late lunch and early dinner and it makes it less likely for me to go across the street to eat for dinner when I have to wait an hour.\n\nWhen I first visited the place was so dark and narrow, but I liked sitting up at the sushi bar and the owner remembers you. Well he always remembers me and even what we like and asks about my daughter when we don't bring her. I don't like their green tea ice cream, it tastes like what I expect Cyndi Lauper's lipstick might taste like. Maybe it's supposed to taste that way and I don't like anyone's green tea ice cream. I haven't tried others since that experience. I'd rather spend my money on another roll. I have tried to get my co-workers to come over, but no one I work with cares for sushi. I told them they could get a rice bowl with teriyaki chicken or something, but they pass. Maybe they don't want to go to lunch with me... hmm. \n\nMy partner told me that not all Ichi Ban's are created equal. I'm just lucky this one is so close.  I just wish I could afford more of it.

Problem #2 is the staff- they make you feel like you are inconveniencing them by placing your order and giving them money.

So the rude cashier looks over and says WHAT. And I said I'm missing my potato salad so she opens the cooler and basically throws it at me with very good accuracy as if she has done this many times. So then my brother asked her if she missed his potato salad also and she screams out I DON'T KNOW CHECK YOUR BAG, As if she has somehow forgotten what she put in there 30 seconds ago. \n\nBottom line food is good but it's not worth the effort you have to go through to get it.

The place had 2 customers on a Friday night and the special was rib tips..but they only had chicken! They offered an extra side but no change in the price... Then while we were eating I heard another customer who had come in long after us, being old that they were out of ribs and the customer was upset that he had already paid for ribs too! I don't understand why they were letting people order and pay for ribs when it was clear they knew that they knew they didn't have any! \n\nWhen we got our meal my husband took one bite and said he hated it. the chicken was dry, bbq sauce tasted like metal and the red potato salad seemed like the kind you get in bulk at a grocery store.

Huh?  Yes, you read that right.  After taking in the Body Worlds exhibit (What else does someone do after seeing dead bodies?  Have dinner of course!) at the AZ Science Center we headed to Pizzeria Bianco and decided that we really didn't want to wait 3.5 hours (Phoenix's equivalent of Bridge and Tunnel were at PB in full effect) for food, especially when there are so many great restaurants within 1 mile.  So off to Cheuvront it was, and what a great dinner it was.\n\nAtmosphere - 5 stars\nFood - 4.75 stars\nService - 3.75 stars\nOverall - 4.5 stars\n\nThis is my third visit over the past few years, and each time it has been on a weekend night with a surprisingly sparse crowd.  I'm not sure why this is.  I've never heard anything bad about this place, so I suspect AZ State Senator Cheuvront's restaurant must be suffering from light rail construction.  Their loss should be your gain, as diners are rewarded with light crowds and superb food and wine.  Even one of my dining guests visiting from New York City was impressed.\n\nThe sexy modern space on the first floor of the Artisan Lofts sets that perfect urban tone that the menu and locale indicate.  We sat at a table towards the back close to the loungey sofa area and curtained bar tables.  Cool touch.  We started out with a nice bottle of sauvignon blanc chilled in a fancy container and noshed on a French charcuterie plate of a pate mousse, cornichons (I have a weakness for salty gherkins), two cheeses, marinated artichokes, asparagus, kalamata olives, smooth spicy mustard and a crusty artisanal sourdough baguette.  What a great way to start a dinner, eh?\n\nOur main entrees continued the pace and didn't disappoint.  I ordered the prosciutto wrapped grilled shrimp and macaroni and cheese.  Those thangs weren't shrimp.  These MOFOS were GIANT tiger prawns, and they were presented on a bed of mango avocado salsa drizzled with a balsamic reduction.  HEAVEN.  The macaroni was impressive as well - and cooked with three fancy cheeses: Quebec cheddar, comte and a dry jack cheese. \n\nBonnie shared some of her ahi tuna salad nicoise - and that tuna was seared and seasoned perfectly, and surprisingly fresh.  Additionally I had a taste of the peppercorn filet and was pleased with the marinated tender taste of the meat.  \n\nPrice for 3 people (apps, entrees and $40 bottle of wine) - $115.  Average entree - $16.  Not bad, methinks.\n\nMy only complaint would be the service.  It was very good for the most part, but started to falter toward the end as our server's attentiveness (which was impressive most of the evening) left us with finished dinner plates on our table for about 15 minutes.  In his defense though, he gave us a very warm and classy (classy with a 'C') welcome and spoke very knowledgeably about the menu and wine when we had questions. Additionally, the hostess and other servers are super friendly and congenial. \n\nI'm eager for my next visit so I can try some of their martinis and buy cheeses from their retail section, but I would be just as happy enjoying a glass of wine there and soaking the place up.", "business_id": "muCl5p-9ut1sY0aKeUeRhw", "stars": 5, "date": "2007-05-20", "type": "review"}

They have the old reliables like the Kim Crawford Sav Blanc.  They even have -- and I'm very impressed by this -- Cakebread Vineyards Chard!  Now, granted, I'm not keen on throwing down $70 for a bottle, nor is it really in my disposable budget when two bottles of the Sav Blanc will suffice; but if we are talking about a special occasion, THAT is your bottle.\n\nThe cheese list is exhaustive and very impressive.  I wish I knew more about cheeses and pairings to offer a helpful review, but the pairings that were suggested by the waiter were perfect.  You can see their cheese menu online and its worth researching before you go so you'll know your varieties.\n\nThe thing that bothers me about Cheuvront, however, is their chronic lack of atmosphere.  First, it kind of feels like drinking in the lobby of an airport.  There just isn't a ton of ambiance.  While I do enjoy the lighting, the brightness reflecting off of the concrete mess that is Central Ave is just really uncomfortable when you are trying to enjoy a bottle.  Where as Pacifico pairs beautifully with the sunny deck of a pool, I count on dim, moody lighting for a bottle of Pinot.  \n\nFurthermore, the place is just usually dead, no excitement, or aura.  Its bright, lacks energy, and the seating is mostly awkward.  This place deserves an inspired crowd, but I've yet to see it yet.  The mood even trickles, up/down to the staff who seem to be going through some of the motions.  I don't know, maybe its just my perception.

The wine list is nice and covers a wide range of palattes. I've had the Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc before which was good, and also had a glass of another white whose name escapes me. The second white I had was poured for me by the very friendly bartender Jeff...I told him what kind of wine I liked and he hand-selected one for me to try. It's not on the \"wine by the glass\" menu, so he opened the bottle and poured me a glass. I love when places do that!  The beer list while small has all of my favorite imports, so thumbs up on that as well.\n\nThe first time I dined at Cheuvront was for dinner and my friend and I started with the Brillat Savarin which was creamy and very much like brie...it was delicious. I loved how the server asked if we wanted more baguette when she saw we were running low because we still had a lot of cheese left.  I felt that the one cheese plate was a perfect size for two people to split as an appetizer. For dinner I had the caesar salad which was light and the perfect meal for a warm spring day.  I took a bite of my friend's Pizza Chevre which was really good and hearty.  \n\nI most recently dined at Cheuvront for lunch today with a group of friends. Our waiter was incredibly pleasant and even though the menu said they do not split checks, he was very nice about running two credit cards and breaking cash to make change.  Everyone at the table seemed very pleased by what they ordered. I had the macaroni and cheese which comes with a side salad. The mac and cheese was the perfect lunch sized portion and the salad was light and crispy.  Prices are very reasonable for both wine and food.\n\nCheuvront is a great spot for lunch, dinner, or just to sit at the bar and try a new wine or two.

They're friendly AND happy to see their customers there. Plus, they have Humboldt Fog on the cheese menu so I can always get a taste of home. \n\nFor lunch I usually order either the Summer Salad (chicken, grapes, apples, candied pecans with mixed greens and balsamic dressing) or the Chicken and Spinach salad (includes strawberries and I substitute pecans for almonds). This week I tried something new and was relieved that it turned out pretty good. I had the sesame crusted tuna steak \"sandwich.\" It's served atop a ciabatta roll that is too crusty to eat like a regular sandwich so just use your knife and fork. And, next time I will definitely ask for more of the chipotle mango mayo on the side for dipping. Good flavors. \n\nBONUS: you can get a to-go iced tea with your check and they don't charge you for an extra drink!\n\nThis also is a great place to meet up for a pre-show drink if you're headed to the theater.

Being French, these are two things that you are raised on and make such a wonderful marriage of tastes that it seems like such a travesty that no bar has been devoted to both.

The server took the glass of wine back behind the bar, and we then saw the owners and bartenders trying the wine and rolling their eyes.  Later, the server returned and told me I could order any drink, not just something off the happy hour menu, (wasn't sure if it would be on the house or not?) and then never returned to take my order. When we finally tracked down another server, I ordered a sangria.  The server gave me a blank stare and said they did not have sangria even though it was plainly listed on their drink menu.

Let's start with the basics-- the food was pretty good in its simplicity. My date, ok fine my mom, and I ordered one of their antipasto plates. It came with some cured meats and cheeses that you select off a list, along with olives and roasted vegies and great crusty bread. We also got a trio of macaroni cheese, AKA my favorite food on earth. You pick which three you want, and if memory serves me right we got the butternut squash, crispy proscuitto, and carmalized onions. HEAVEN. Paired with a nice glass of Pino Grig that kept on coming, it was a pretty average tapas-style, nice meal.\n\nHere's the kicker: our server started the night by telling us her fellow waiters were betting on whether or not she'd spill something during her shift because she had the previous 3 nights. Lo and behold she soon spilled soup down some poor woman's back sitting behind us and then spilled something greasy on the floor next to our table. Then she dropped our credit card behind the register and took at least half an hour trying to retrieving it.

But, I'm afraid that my recent experience was indicative of a change in the restaurant, and maybe I'm contributing to a turnaround, who knows?  But, as a disclaimer, I have been to Cheuvront many times before this and had a good to great experience.  This review is for the dinner I had there last saturday night.\n\nSo, having had great meals here, Sweet Pea and I decided to take the in-laws while they were in town.  The experience started off badly and only got worse.  We came in around 8:30 and were seated right away.  However, as soon as my butt hit the seat, the hostess turned to me (I guess I looked like the authority of the group of us) and said \"um, the kitchen is kind of backed up. Can you wait 15 minutes?\"  I looked at her with what must have been a very confused expression, and asked \"15 minutes?  Like, I have to wait 15 minutes before anyone even comes to talk to me??\" and she said \"yes, is that a problem?\"  Again, I looked at her incredulously and said \"well, I guess I don't really have a choice, do I?\" to which she just looked down and shuffled away.\n\nThen I was left to explain to Sweet Pea and the in-laws WTF she was just asking me.  An inauspicious start to an evening that we'd made big promises about.  Now, I don't know why she said this at all because our waitress was over shortly.  But, before she got there, said hostess came by and glumly slapped 4 wine glasses on our table...2 of which were dirty.  Not just dirty, one of them ACTUALLY STILL HAD WINE IN IT.  I am not joking.  So that was strike 2 for the in-laws to see...I was starting to feel about 1 inch tall, as I'm sure Sweet Pea was.\n\nWe ordered a selection of cheeses after raving that, although the whole dinner may not have started out well service-wise, the cheeses at Cheuvront are remarkable and a \"must-try\".  Our salads came out...and then our main courses.  No cheese.  We started wondering, were they doing it French-style, after the meal?  There was no further wondering when they brought out the dessert menu, then the check.  No mention of the cheese whatsoever.  It's like Sweet Pea going through the cheese menu WITH THE VERY SAME WAITRESS and selecting 4 cheeses never happened.\n\nGet your act together, Cheuvront.  There are tons of great restaurants opening downtown almost very other week, and being an \"establishment\" means nothing in these times...look at My Florist.", "business_id": "muCl5p-9ut1sY0aKeUeRhw", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-05-10", "type": "review"}

None at the table were very knowledgeable about cheeses, but we told our server Zach our likes and dislikes and he steered us in the right direction.  This was a very nice start to the meal and ample for four people.  We paired it with an '08 Cakebread Sauvignon Blanc.  \n\nThere was a dinner entree of risotto cakes w/ peas, asparagus, and mushrooms that we all wanted to try so we put it in as an order for an appetizer.  The portion was fairly small so it was perfect for an appetizer, but I would have been a little disappointed had someone ordered it for their main course.\n\nFor our entrees two of us ordered the duck and the other two ordered the scallops.  The duck was prepared perfectly with crisp skin and moist breast.  This was served atop a red-wine risotto with blackberry gastrique. The menu stated there would be seasonal vegetables, but I caught very few on my plate.  The scallops were also cooked perfectly and were served with spinach/tomato/olive pasta.  We ordered a bottle of Delas \"Saint-Esprit\" Cotes du Rhone.  I felt bad about ordering one of the cheapest bottles on the menu (only $20!), but the Cotes du Rhone caught my eye and I wanted to try it.  It ended up being a very nice wine, whatta steal.\n\nDue to dietary restrictions of one guest, we had to request a change on one of the entrees and the server was very respectful of it and discussed it with the chef who obliged with no issues.  Kudos for going out of their way to take care of us.\n\nFor dessert we had a chocolate cookie filled with molten chocolate served with ice cream, along with cr\u00e8me brulee.  Both were not out of this world, but a nice finish nonetheless to a fabulous meal.\n\nAll in all this was a great place that was very reasonably priced where you could go all out and not feel too bad when the bill came. :) I enjoyed the wine list and it was apparent that they did not markup their wines as much as other restaurants.  The only reason this place does not get 5 stars is portion size, lack of vegetables with the entree (I much enjoy a meal of protein, vegetable, starch with somewhat equal ratios), and there was not one \"wow\" factor in which I will be telling my friends \"You MUST order this dish\" or a dish I have to come back for.   I wouldn't have minded the small portion size at all had it perhaps been on a bigger plate with more use of color.  \n\nI would definitely enjoy coming back and would love to try their happy hour.  I also love how they are open on Monday evenings since a lot of nice places aren't.\n\nSorry this is my first time writing a review so if you don't want to read the whole thing:\n\nPositive:\nGREAT wine list \nOutstanding cheeses\nOn the mark entrees\nKnowledgeable and attentive staff\n\nNegative:\nPortion sizes\nLack of vegetables", "business_id": "muCl5p-9ut1sY0aKeUeRhw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-05-10", "type": "review"}

I am not sure if this was really such a good deal since the pizzas on their menu all sounded awesome and were much cheaper than the $30pp that we paid. But we happily decided to save that for another time and so we all ordered off the prix-fix menu. Everyone at the table liked their food though one person felt their chicken was a little undercooked. We got a variety of options so that we could all sample each others food. For me, the highlight was the gazpacho. It was really delicious. None of the other dishes were really out-of-this-world great, but still impressive food for a place that appears to primarily be a wine bar. \n\nThe best part was that our server was able to recommend wines for each of us that we had never tried before but really enjoyed. I love trying new wines so that was a lot of fun. A small plus is that it prints the name of the wine on the receipt so I can actually remember the name to hopefully purchase a bottle another time.

After that it appeared that a cook or someone from back of house came out to the bar and again did not acknowledge us either. Finally, a couple minutes later the waiter came out into the dining room again and we asked to see a wine list just to get his attention. He then made his way over to hand us a wine list.

I felt like it was a little dry and could've used a lot more cheese inside. The second course was Steak Au Poivre with french fries. The steak was good, not excellent. It was a little tough and chewy, which was especially noticeable because they never gave us steak knives and we had to use our butter knives to try and saw through the meat.

I think they were just the frozen crinkly fries you can buy at the store - they reminded me of the fries they used to serve at lunch in the school cafeteria.

Maybe.\n\nSirens, bells, flashing lights and yelling servers. And it's all for me because I've ordered the \"big unit\". Can't make this a review to take seriously, mostly just a blog entry as I've only been there a few times.\n\nLast night I chose this place for its proximity to the Bentley Gallery where I saw a wonderful chamber music concert.\n\nI did order the big unit. My dining buddies were in awe at its size. Even the 2-foot bun wasn't long enough to contain the dog: it pokes out both ends and over the edge of the restaurant-chafing-dish-size stainless steel tureen. I ordered it loaded with chili and cheese and onions on the side. Dog on one side, fries on the other. Take your iPhone because you must get a panoramic shot of yourself holding up the gigantic deep-dish container, mouth open wide. Ask for my facebook if you want to see it -- it's truly vulgar.\n\nThe dog is all-beef. About halfway through your server will ask if you want a box. A testament to my voracious appetite (and my companions' desire to graze) we gracefully declined. One by one, those fries disappeared, and slice by slice, we could have counted up the multiple dozens of grams of sodium ingested.\n\nUnfortunately the bun was that processed brown \"wheat\" spongy thing with a slightly rough but still squishy crust. Would have preferred a roll with more substance, perhaps toasty. Or they could have gone the extreme with the wonder-bread just-better-than-twinkies airy squish that Sonic uses for their coneys. It soaked up too much of the cheese and chili sauce.\n\nChili beans were the downfall for me. Must have had corn syrup for sweetner or starch for thickner, 'cause I paid for it later (corn allergy). Every so often I have to be baad and hope for the best while I wait for the worst. I'll eventually learn I just can't eat this stuff any more. Perhaps this little blog will get it out of my system.\n\nAll in all, I can only compare it to the standard set by Sonic.

I had hair down to the crack in my rear. I wore black jeans, a flannel shirt over a metal band t-shirt, and  the typical denim jacket covered in patches saluting heavy metal bands like Iron Maiden, Metallica, Slayer, Skid Row, and of course... Alice Cooper. I was cool.\n\nCooper's Town is part Hard Rock Cafe and part ESPN Zone. They have a small amount of rock memorabilia, signed guitars and such, hanging on the walls. They have a large amount of sports memorabilia and over 15 television screens to watch currently happening games, games of the past, and highlights from different sporting events around the country. A mix of music, surprisingly mostly not metal, plays overhead. \n\nThe servers all sport black t-shirts with a white image of Alice Cooper's eyes with his eyeliner reminiscent of The Crow. They are also all wearing said eyeliner. It looked a bit silly on many of them, but I do have to give them points for wearing it proudly and not seeming too embarrassed about it. I have to admit that I found the decor of the bar and the wear of the staff amusing at least. I give them a star for that.\n\nOur server was reasonably chipper. She paid a reasonable amount of attention to us for most of our time there, but ignored us for quite a while once the food came then a bit longer once we were done. \n\nThe food was decent, but barely decent. My fiance got the a salad with Thai-inspired chicken and peanut sauce. She said the peanut sauce was good and the chicken okay, but the salad was all iceberg lettuce. Iceberg? Really? Only iceberg? Keep in mind that her and I eat out a lot. It's only at the small hole-in-the-wall greasy spoon that we would ever expect to get a lot of iceberg, much less ONLY iceberg in a salad. \"That's the way we do a lot of our salads,\" we were told by the server. My burger, which was supposed to be cooked medium, came very well done. It was akin to chewing a meat-flavored hockey puck. \n\nThe only good point, foodwise, was the dessert. We got a sort of cinnamony apple cobbler with vanilla ice cream. It was good. It was pretty darn good. I give them a star for that.\n\nWhen we got the bill, we saw that we were not charged for the mostly iceberg salad. We didn't really expect to not have to pay for it, but were pleased indeed that we didn't. I give them a star for that.\n\nOverall, the food and the service were pretty lacking. On the upside, if you're a metalhead or metalhead in recovery, there is a good chance that you'll spot Alice himself if you visit during the winter, and you can purchase overpriced Alice Cooper t-shirts and other stuff the whole year around.", "business_id": "oCA2OZcd_Jo_ggVmUx3WVw", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-05-27", "type": "review"}

Expecting some of excitement and flair of his music, we arrived at Alice Cooperstown right after noon.  Granted, a popular time.  \n\nWhile an empty 4 top stared us in the face, we were told we would have to wait 5 minutes for a table.  We looked thorough the moderately-overpriced merchandise while waiting the longest 5 minutes in history.  \n\nSchool is NOT out.  Lesson One:  Allow plenty of time to get seated at Alice's. \n\nFinally seated, our server orbited by, only barely interested in our presence.  Having seen the big-unit pimped on TV, we had agreed to try it.  The \"Big-Unit\" is 22\" of all-beef hot dog on a bun.  For some reason I thought it would be special.  Stupid me.  We asked for cheese on top and for half of the dog to have chili as my wife doesn't like chili. So that means the whole dog would have cheese, and half of the dog would have both cheese and chili.  Complicated?  Read on.\n\nOK, so now we've been at Alice's for 50 minutes (FIFTY) and have not been served.  \n\nLesson two:  Service at Alice's is S-L-O-W.  \n\nNo matter how loud they pump up the music, the servers and kitchen can not keep the beat.  I hadn't intended on keeping track, but at 45 minutes I started to notice that I was getting pretty hungry.  At 55 minutes our server suddenly looks in our direction, probably from the pain of 3 pairs of eyes following her every move and rushes to the kitchen.  \n\nThe \"Big Unit\" is supposed to be the signature dish at Alice's.  When a \"Big Unit\" is served a bell is rung and all the servers stand up and mutter (in unison) \"big unit\".  Ob la te, ob la ta, life goes on.  Not much of a production, but that's ok.  I didn't really want the hoopla I thought might come with it.  \n\nLesson Three:  The \"Big Unit\" is no Big Deal.\n\nThe BU arrives naked on one side and cheese and chili on the other. Sheesh\n\nLesson four: Wait staff either cannot take orders or do not check orders.  \n\nBut, by this time our parking meter was going to run out, so eating was our first priority. \n\nLesson 5, bring quarters for the meters or park in the public garage.\n\n We politely asked for mayo, pickle relish and onions as the waitress drifted by from time to time. The mayo came first....5 minutes later the pickle relish was dropped off on a buzz by, and the onions...well, we never saw them.  \n\nLesson six: oh hell, you get the idea.\n\nOur dining partner ordered a fried chicken sandwich.  Her only comment was that it would have better if it had not been fried and was otherwise bland.\n\nI think this is really a place to go for a beer at the bar. Or, if you are with a group large enough to attract the interest of the wait staff and and your group is interested in drinking mass quantities of beer, thus disabling the usual gag reflex that might prevent you from eating everything put in front of you.  Or maybe you want to embarrass a weight challenged friend and make them order a \"big deal\" (oh sorry, \"Big Unit\") and watch them stuff 22\" of all-beef boiled doggie into their face.  ha ha ha.  What fun.  Really.\n\nOK, so the bottom line.  \n\nGo once 'cause you can't believe all the other bad reviews and you're sure Alice would never be a part of this.  Then, write a review apologizing to all the previous reviewers who tried to warn you.\n\nOh oh, I almost forgot.  The wait staff wear eye makup.  Just like Alice.  Well, sorta like Alice.  Alright, not at all at all like alice.\n\nLike I said, Alice doesn't live here anymore.  And we told you so.

The tortillas were soggy and when you picked one up, everything slid off it so all you got was soggy wet chips and no toppings. Even when you scooped it up with a fork or whatever, the toppings didn't taste very good. As for mine-it all tasted like (and had the texture of) stuff that had been cooked in a boil-in-the-bag meal. The sauce was SUPER sweet, and none of the meat had the slightest flavor or appearance of having been even wafted through smoke.

Every time I passed by, it looked like a fun place to go hang out.  I finally had the opportunity to do so during a conference in downtown Phoenix.  One of the companies at the conference hosted a party here.\n\nThe party was staged in the patio area as you enter the restaurant.  The company who hosted the party was giving away complimentary Cigars, so I understand why they had it outdoors.  The weather was perfect, so it was a good time of the year to do it.  The place was packed too.  So why the 2 Stars?  Here's why:\n\n- They serve Wine out of a liquor gun....yes, they do.  When I went up to the bar on the patio and asked for a glass of Cabernet, the bartender told me \"You have to go inside because we don't have the handles with the Wine\".....I thought she was kidding and I said, \"I'm sorry, I don't think you understand, I asked for a glass of Cabernet.  You don't have any bottles back there?\"....that's when she confirmed what I heard and said \"No, you heard me right, we serve Wine out of a handle/line and since we're a smaller bar outside you have to go inside to get it\".......what the hell?!  The Wine tasted like what you would expect Wine from a tap to taste like...\n\n- The restrooms are like gas station restrooms.  They're located out next to the bars on the patio and they are just like gas station restrooms in that they're too small and dirty.  They couldn't handle the crowd of people at the party.\n\n- Service is slow.  The line at the bar was 30 people deep for each line (2 lines).  There were only 2 bartenders to service 200+ people.  It took 20+ min to get a drink.\n\n- The party felt like a house party in someone's backyard.  Plastic cups, plastic furniture, you had to bus your own table.....there were no buspersons or anyone to clean up.  Bizzaro-world.....\n\nOverall, not a good experience.  Maybe if I was a young 20 yr old it would be cool...not now.\n\nReturn Factor - 5%", "business_id": "oCA2OZcd_Jo_ggVmUx3WVw", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-04-21", "type": "review"}

I was in Phoenix to celebrate my 50th birthday in my birth town and decided to have lunch at Alice Cooper'stown. Overall I had an awesome experience.\n\n I like how the women get into the theme, with cutoff denim shorts, black tanks and tees and AC eye makeup. Everyone I encountered was friendly and helpful but I want to make a special shout out to Susie. She took outstanding care of me. I decided to go with the tuna casserole based on her suggestion/recommendation...it was wonderful: creamy, great flavor, not fishy smelling or tasting. Onion rings would have been a great side (hint hint). I wasn't familiar with Kilt Lifter and she gave me a sample with my Hefe. It was so good I had two full glasses. Susie was attentive without being overbearing AND invited me to walk around to check out the memorabilia. Good waitress/bartender she is, she gave me a covered cup of water to keep me hydrated.\n\nI especially liked the decor - a combination of music and sports memorabilia with lots of Alice Cooper influence.  The music totally ROCKED.  The restaurant also has a nice selection of tshirts and sweatshirts for sale. Maybe a bit overpriced but hey! they're in business to make money.\n\nHere's a tip: go at lunch. I'm sure the dinner crowd is exactly that - a crowd.

To start with, there were only 2 bartenders behind the bar and like I said, it was super busy.  My husband had to pretty much push his way  up to the bar.  He had to wait about 5 minutes to place our order (he got a vanilla vodka screwdriver, a water for me, my daughter and I got the John O' Hurley Buffalo Chicken Wrap, and my husband ordered the Johnny Beef Depp) which wasn't too bad, but then the bartender just took off before my husband could even ask how we were suppose to know when our food was ready.  She ignored us and talked over my husband to other people.  Finally, when she did come back over, she was rude and said \"just stand over there, I will yell at you when your stuffs ready.\" and pointed randomly over to the side.  My husband then asked her if she wanted his name and she responded rudely again, \"we don't have that information.\" But his name was on the receipt... ??  Ok then.\n\nSo, we just waited off to the side and in the meantime got yelled at by a waitress and a bus boy that we were in the way.  The bus boy actually took the time to rudely show us a line in the concrete floor that we needed to stand behind, when we were standing where we were told to by the bartender.  Finally after about 20 mins our food was ready and the waitress yelled very loudly while pointing at us, \"Hey you!! come get your food!!\"  So my husband went over to get it and she had two different orders sitting there and she basically shoved one of the bags at him and said, \"is this yours...yeah I think this is yours.\"  Then our friend that was with us, who ordered before us had to ask her if the other order was his and she shoved it him and said, \"I think this one is yours.\" and walks away. He had to actually open up his bag and check to make sure that order was his.  She didn't even check the orders before shoving them at us!  Granted the bar was getting crushed with people and they were understaffed so I understand that, but being rude doesn't equate to return customers.\n\nWe ended up sitting outside at one of the picnic tables to eat.  My buffalo chicken wrap was minus the buffalo!! It was just a plain old crispy chicken wrap with ranch, way too much lettuce, a few diced tomatoes, and some cheese (I think in maybe 2 bites I had).  My wrap wasn't even hot.  It came with 2 sides....I chose fries and apple slices.  The fries were o.k. really had no seasoning on them and the apple slices were just the basic bagged apples, one of them was actually kinda soggy.  My daughters order was exactly the same as mine.  It was o.k. nothing impressive.  My husband said his sandwich was  made with good quality beef but without the au jus it would have been dry.  He said it was actually pretty good.  My husband thought the fries were good.  His screwdriver was VERY strong, which I would believe it to be a result of over pouring, but the bartender said when she handed it to him that she made it very strong on purpose because he was patient.  \n\nI know Alice Cooper is a huge sports nut so the ambiance is geared more towards that with T.V.'s all over the place, very little music related decor, kinda just comes across as a typical sports bar.  I really don't think I will go back in the future due to our food and service being bad.", "business_id": "oCA2OZcd_Jo_ggVmUx3WVw", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-03-28", "type": "review"}

At first, I was reminded of the Hard Rock Cafe in Florida, but eventually I began to notice some similarities between Alice Cooper and my grandmother, because Alice Cooper'stown is much like that of an eccentric old woman's, it is cluttered from years of hoarding petty and useless things. The only difference is that instead of having numerous pictures of family and cats covering the walls, there are numerous pictures of Alice Cooper doing Alex Cooper things, like pretending a guitar is a baseball bat and scowling at a camera like a rebellious teenager while dressed as Baron Samedi. \n\nHowever, despite the similarities to grandma's house, this is the go to bar when it comes to celebrating a D-Backs win. While many Phonecians get a lot of flack for their lack of support of the team, you wouldn't know it if you visited this place after a game. I am not normally a big fan of places like these, mainly due to the noise, which is mainly due to the fact that when I go out to eat, I tend to try to enjoy the food and the atmosphere, and have a conversation with a friend, however, for the purposes of going to a bar to celebrate with others, this was perfect. \n\nWhy the 4 stars then? It was way too gimmicky for food that wasn't special as a whole or for the price. For instance, they have a Mike  Myers Yeah Baby which is a disgusting sandwich with cheap cuts of meat for 17 dollars, and a Magic Johnson mushroom and swiss burger for 11 dollars. I had the big unit burger and the mac and cheese, both of which were above average for their taste, but were exorbitantly high priced. I could have gotten 3 hot dogs at the stadium for the price of the big unit alone! \n\nOverall though, this place is worth a visit for the fun and novelty of doing so. I had a lot of fun here. Despite the place reminding me of my grandma's house.", "business_id": "oCA2OZcd_Jo_ggVmUx3WVw", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-04-06", "type": "review"}

Their fries are and potato skins are crispy and flavorful.  Also, their prices are not bad.\n\nOur second visit was on a Friday night.  Wasn't too busy, which made me happy.

He got them wrong. He fixed it but then didn't come back for another 25 minutes to take our order. now that part we weren't really annoyed because we had conversations and drinks in front of us. When he finally came over to take our order we wanted an appetizer. Now it would have been nice to have gotten an appetizer right when we gotten our drinks because then those 25 minutes wouldn't have seemed so bad. ... A food runner came out shortly after and brought us our appetizer. It then took another 15 minutes for him to come back to take our food order. The food came out just right thank god. But  After about 10 minutes you would expect for a server to come over and ask you how the meal is, am i right? Well he did no such thing. NOT only did he not come over to the table at all to check on the status of our food but he also payed no attention to us .  And my wife had to scream sir across the restaurant because we didn't know his name but finally he paid attention and came over to the table. when he did he got what we needed but then it took another 30 minutes or so to get his attention again to do a final check on our food and for our bill.

The sandwich was very small and very expensive for that size. 13 bucks seemed really steep and with a drink and tip you can not eat there for under 20 bucks. The sandwich itself was cold and very greasy. I had better. The fries were tasty but the coleslaw was stale. Our waiter was really nice and attentive and its not his fault that the food isn't great.

In addition, I must have went through ten napkins trying to sop the grease from my hands. It was a little better when I piled salsa on top of each bite, but it was not something I would ever consider ordering again. My mom ordered the lunch special of two tacos with rice and beans. Now I cannot discuss the taste of her meal, because I didn't try it; however, the taco shells were just plain, out of the box hard corn taco shells. I've never understood why a Mexican restaurant wouldn't spend more time on the things that make Mexican restaurants great. Tortillas are amazing.

I've seen this @ hockey games, baseball, etc & always wondered how they avoided selecting two totally random people sitting next to each other to hug/kiss.  Or why the jumbotron always makes people actually get up and do the funky chicken dance.

For the Suns game, I went with two girlfriends and we drove...parking was super easy and convenient in a garage and it was only $10. Sweet. For the concert, my husband and I took light rail and it ran late that evening. Double sweet. Walking around downtown around 5:45 pm the evening of the concert, parking near US Airways was running about $20-25.\n\nThe atmosphere outside before the Suns game was awesome - live band playing and different things set up for kids and kids at heart alike. Getting in for the game was really easy and quick; for the concert, not so much. It was a huge clusterf*ck and while at times there was semblences of lines, really it was just people pushing toward the door. Once inside, both times, I really wished there was better signage and directions on which way to head. I have been to better looking arenas, but the worst part about the setup for US Airways is that the walkways, especially on the second level, are quite narrow for the amount of people that were at both events, so it gets way too congested to even walk.\n\nThe concession stand choices are horrid. My two girlfriends and I set out to find something to eat prior to the Suns game beginning and we finally had to settle for Subway. The concession stand choices that we saw were pizza, nachos, pretzels, and candy. No fries. No burgers. No chicken tenders. Definitely make sure to eat at one of the restaurants around the arena before heading in. \n\nFor the Suns game, we sat in section 225 which is a corner section. For buying the tickets two days prior to the game for $53 each, we were really happy with our seats and the view. We didn't miss any of the action and even from section 225, row 10, Shaq looked HUGE. We didn't feel too far away at all and we had perfect views of the court and the scoreboards. For the concert, we were in section 219 which is on the side. Seats were pretty decent...we could see the stage really well, but lights blocked our view of some of the screens. Acoustics for the concert were a bit lacking, but I'm not sure if that was due to the equipment the tour had or if it is because of the venue.\n\nI wouldn't run back to US Airways for a concert, but will definitely go to another Suns game. People were totally into the game and it was nice to see people watch the whole game and stand up and cheer. I felt this venue is good for basketball, but for concerts, it was just OK.", "business_id": "uFJwKlHL6HyHSJmORO8-5w", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-03-30", "type": "review"}

It was the season opener for the Mercury and the crowd was hyped and the atmosphere was playoff like...and it was a thrilling victory for the mercury that night. \n\nIt's a shame that the stadium is just average for team as good as the Mercury and while the Suns play there and are providing some excitement right now the stadium just doesn't provide any. There are not enough restrooms, the vendors are very commercial, and the prices for the food are a little outrageous. Now we did have great seats about 5 rows behind the backboard...and we had great views of the Mercury bench and got some amazing photos of the players.\n\nThey really need to make some improvements there to make the place more fan friendly and maybe add some spice and excitement to it because that is what it really lacks.

We got our tickets at the absolute laaaaaast minute and contacted the disability services office to set up interpreters. Normally, when you go to a venue and use interpreters, you need a few weeks to make sure accommodations are all set up and everything goes well. The director of disability services had a few days to make all the accommodations work... no easy task. However, she was AMAZING. She hired the interpreters right away and got our seats switched to the appropriate seating. The only  reason why they get 4 stars instead of 5 is we were really far from the stage (which may be because we waited so long to get tickets). In fact, we are going to another show in the fall here because of her awesomeness. We will be sat in the same area again, but that's because of the tickets we are buying.\nI HIGHLY recommend anyone with accommodation needs go to an event here.

If you sit at the end of the bar, you can definitely catch a view of the live game (if you're tall enough and don't mind squirming around to avoid the obstructions of the support beams and people that actually paid for their tables).  But regardless of whether you can see or not, you still get the roar of the crowd for every big play.\n\nGranted - the prices are a bit higher and the selection is much more limited than your average TGIFridays.  But they do have drink specials and I had chicken fingers and fries that weren't terrible.  An interesting note - the TVs inside Friday's have a significant delay from the live game (7-10 seconds) which was weird when watching the TV broadcast, hearing the crowd react to a play, waiting for it to happen on TV, then getting the reaction from the restaurant.\n\nAlso, a note on pricing for the reserved tables.  Between my wife and I, we spent $30 each on food and drinks at the bar (a single app and entree between us and 2 or 3 drinks each).

You just have to find a couple friends to go with you... because you do have to buy out an entire table, whether you use all the seats or not.  \n\nMy husband and I met our couple friends to check out the game versus the Cubs.  First thing the men noticed?  How much they appreciated the extra room.  The tables are like 1/2 pentagons, a table cut in half facing the field.  The men are both over 6 feet, and not having their knees jammed into the chair in front of them was worth it alone.  \n\nService was just ok.  They don't have to be awesome, they have a captive audience and they know your bill is going to be at least $130 and gratuity is added in on top of that.  \n\nFood was just ok, your average Friday's fare... if you like it anywhere else you'll like it here.  It's a bit pricer at the field I think, and watch out--the drink prices are considerable (that's because they don't list them!).\n\nSome other cons:  view, if you are really into the game these seats will frustrate you.  It's a good use of the backfield space that would have otherwise been cheap bleacher seats.  But you're looking at the game from a good distance, from the back side.  Also, Fridays is adjacent to the big screen, so you really can't even watch the game or replays on the big screen.  Also con: noise, you're right next to some huge speakers.  While the space would be good for kids, to be able to run around a little more than regular seats... for kids who are noise sensitive, BEWARE.  I was glad we decided to leave our little guy with the grandparents, I think those speakers would have made him pretty unhappy the whole game.\n\nBut, for experience alone it was worth it.

We went into the bar and found two open bar tables. Before sitting down we asked a waiter if the table was available. He said yes, and we sat down. No one came to take our order for 10 minutes so we went to the bar and ordered drinks. A waiter came by after we received our drinks and gave us menus. Another waiter came by with more menus. After we had been at the table for 20 minutes, a hostess came over to say the table was reserved for the wait list and we had to move - the other table that was open when we came in was still open and there were at least eight tables open in the dining area. We told the hostess that a waiter told us we could sit there and she said it didn't matter. We asked for the manager. He reiterated that we had been told by a waiter that we could sit there, he didn't care. We asked if we could finish our drinks, since the other bar table was still vacant. He said no. We had to finish our drinks standing to the side of the bar (since you can't take them into the stadium).

The website gave very conflicting messages about when you could purchase the seats in Front Row for the game, so I gave the restaurant a call over a week in advance. They said I could only purchase tables the day of. I called the night before the game, hoping that maybe they would make an exception because I really wanted these tickets. I then found out that the tickets have been available all season! I asked to speak to the manager, who was the rudest human being I have ever spoke to in my life! After about an hour on the phone with him, tears, and being called a liar, I decided to hang up and just call customer service. I understand that the table I wanted had already been reserved, I just wanted the manager (Lyle) to try to help fix the issue. He said there was nothing he could do, and that \"EVERYONE knows you can buy the tickets all year round\"... what a piece of crock. I cannot believe I was talked to in the way that he spoke to me, and I am so thoroughly upset and aggravated at him. I just read some previous reviews about him on this site, and it's so funny that everyone agrees with me. If you don't have any issue when you go there, then you'll be fine.

We were able to sit by the windows that overlook the park, which was breathtaking to me.

Thats bad because I absolutely LOVE french onion soup.  But my Grandparents and Auntie loved their food.  \n\nI had the Korean Beef tacos.  Love it.  Good flavor, and rather large portion.  (TIP from my Auntie, ask for potsticker sauce on the side and pour it on the rice and/or tacos) \n\nThe customer service was great, our waitress was super friendly and conversational.  Since it was pretty much empty, we walked outside to look at the stadium from the balcony they have.  While we did that, another employee got confused and cleared away our drinks and utensils.

He offered to seat us on the patio, and after some convincing we reluctantly agreed -- after all, we were fairly eager to spend the rest of our young lives waiting for a table to open up at this completely empty appetizer parlor. We sat on the patio, admiring the empty ballpark of the 11th best team in the NL, for 45 more minutes, until a fourth ringwraith (sans Nazgul) appeared. We ordered, and 45 minutes later our meals arrived. We asked for napkins and silverware. Sauron's Butler brought back three cocktail napkins and zero sets of silverware.

The game day menu is not the full menu but you can still get burgers, steak, ribs, and chicken.  The food prices are comparable to any other TGIF but the cocktails are pretty over priced.  $10 for a 16 oz plastic glass of something.  My wife had a frozen margarita and it tasted funny.  \n\nMy steak was decent.  I wanted medium rare and it was cooked more than that.  The service was really slow.  I get the fact that the servers are moving up and down stairs trying to get everyone their stuff.  It was quite a bit of time between refills and the food did not all come out at once.  Actually we had to remind whomever it was that brought out the food several times of things that were missing.  Our actually waitress did not bring us much of our requests.  It was my wife's birthday and this was what she wanted to do.   Personally I prefer to sit out in the crowd in the bleachers and whoop and holler.  \n\nThe one really cool thing about it all was that we paid $300 for 4 tickets but after looking at the website again it clearly stated that the table was $260 for the 4 tickets.  After a couple of e-mails back and forth to the manager they offered $40 food credit or offered to credit the $40 back to my card.  They said it would have to be on the night of the event because the computer wouldn't allow them to do it.  The manager walked up to me and gave me $40 cash to make up for the difference.

Yes I know nerd alert here) JW usually does a Billy Joel and Elton John tribute. Ha! Last year I even got to sing and dance on stage to Crocodile Rock. Na-na-na-na-na  Na-na-na-na-na!  Don't ask, but life goal number 1 completed! LOL! Well as far as last night goes, all I can say is that we were rocking the place. ( Well ok as far as one can rock out to Simon and Garfunkle) I am sure the conductor was cringing at how rowdy the third row was. Teeehhhee! We were jamming out to the music. \n( Yes sorry handsome conductor man. I know it is the Symphony and probably made you cringe with all that classical training in the house. Then the NY, Alice Cooper gang hooligan types came in-hahaha thus why I like the Pops more than the classical. I will go to classical shows too so really I am just kidding. However. I do love the pops so much more. I know, I know, I feel like \"Just Jack\" from Will and Grace. I love me my musical theater and showtunes, Gleek here.  \n   Last year I even got to see my all time musical theater hero diva perform,  Patti Lupone. SIGH! Got to meet her after the show too. Thanks Phoenix Symphony for that photo op! (Life goal number two, check!) Advice, now if you could only get Mandy I would truly be in heaven. ( Life goal check number 3 perhaps?) \n   However, I do went to point out they do have something for everyone with an eclectic yearly calendar of different musical genres. I do worry about cultural Arts programs and budget cuts in Az so hope people continue to support them in any fashion. I know it is not NY or London but it's still good!  I also love it when I see the young set being introduced to the Symphony. We sat next to a delightful 13 year old young man last night. He was rocking out with us. ( Ok Dad listens to S/G in the car every day. But at least the boy didn't  appear to be having his teeth pulled out by being there)  So to all of my fellow music lovers, check it out, support local Arts, and enjoy!\n\nOh an afterthought- The person who sings with Jim ( can't remember his name) does the meanest, most awesome, best impression of Edith Bunker ever.

I print the calendar, take out my highlighter, highlight all of my favorite flavors and those of my fro-yo addicted coworkers, and hang the calendar outside my cube wall. That way it is much easier for us to tell when we need to work time into our schedule to hit the yogurt shop. \n\nThe flavors that are typically highlighted are: \n- Chocolate Covered Banana & Marshmallow (served on the same day, really good as a swirl) \n- Pistachio (really good with almonds as a topping, I tried getting pistachios as a topping and it was a little much) \n- Butterscotch (reminds me of pudding cups back in the day) \n- German Chocolate & Caramel Custard (also served on the same day and very good as a swirl) \n- Irish Cream & Kahlua (not served on the same day, but the closest thing to drinking at work) \n- S'mores (delicious with a graham cracker topping) \n- And every once in a while I like the Reese's with (you know it) Reese's as a topping!! \n\nSee, with so many delicious flavors, it was hard NOT to go everyday. They have plenty of other flavors as well. The only one that I tried that I was not a fan of was the Root Beer Float.

Help-yourself complimentary coffee and tea counter, with shakers of Splenda available to those inclined to use them- nice touches!  Their breakfast menu sounded very tempting, but the man behind the counter told me that the delivery guy with the eggs wouldn't be in for another 10 minutes or so (Feta omelette, anyone?).  I decided we'd try the Friday fish special of grilled tilapia over salad and a gyro pita with a side salad, extra feta.  I did not enjoy eating the tilapia as it would magically crumble into tiny pieces the moment I cut it with a fork or a knife.  Very annoying!  Besides this, the whole dish tasted very bland since I opted to forgo the housemade vinaigrette (contained allergens); Thankfully, the extra feta (LOVE feta!) salvaged the dish and I was able to down the fish even without the use of a spoon, of which I was constantly wishing would be on hand.  The gyro pita was a much tastier experience, although Mom did not like the meat.  Truth be told, this could not compare with the meat in the gyro dinner I just had a few nights before at MBFGR, but for the price (around $6), it made for a quick and satisfying lunch (and the extra feta in the pita didn't hurt, either)!  While the gyro is not made in-house, AE does have it shipped in three times a week from Chicago, so I was told by the man behind the counter.\n\nBaklava looked awesome, but I couldn't try it since it contained an allergen, but no worries since any item offered here would be fulfiiling enough!", "business_id": "odhXwWaYZvD_icIN6f_DbA", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-04-07", "type": "review"}

It had been a while since my wife and I visited the Arizona Science Center, but we had to go when the Body Worlds and The Brain exhibit came to Phoenix.   Fascinating and amazingly preserved human bodies.  This is the first time my wife has encouraged me to look at naked women.  Honestly, if you have a chance to visit before the exhibit leaves town, go.  Soon.  Now would be good.  This special engagement will be gone after May 31, 2011.\n\nThere are a number of regular exhibits that are geared toward kids, many of them hands-on.  Several school bus loads of kids were there when we visited.   We did not spend much time near those areas.  You might try the late afternoon/evening, especially if you have your own young ones.  We returned again at a special event for adults only.  The \"kid\" zones can be entertaining for adults too.  Though, to a lesser degree.\n\nThe Dorrance Planetarium was oh, so cool.  Literally.  After rubbing shoulders with the mobs of people it was nice to just sit and \"chill\" in this well conditioned room.  I highly recommend the \"Black Holes\" presentation.  Unless....like my wife, you experience MoTiOn SiCkNeSs.  In which case it's a nice cool place to shut your eyes for a spell.  Though we did not see the Roller Coaster presentation I would expect that to have a similar effect.  \n\n The special exhibits are what draws us back to the Arizona Science Center.  From the Titanic to Body Worlds, the diversity of scientific topics and the creative ways they are presented continues to fascinate.", "business_id": "MwmXm48K2g2oTRe7XmssFw", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-03-03", "type": "review"}

I was really looking forward to going here and the disappointment started from buying my admissions ticket. First: Zero customer service a very rude and curt girl, who sold me my admissions ticket, was my first contact with the museum.\n\nSecond, they had three, yes three exhibits.  Really I'm paying $19 dollars to see some half baked exhibits that don't really educate or immerse the visitor?  I've never been to a museum where they had only three exhibits.  Okay maybe one museum had less than that, but it was free and I donated $2 just to help keep them around.  \n\nThird, even though I'm a child at heart and love an interactive museum as much as the next person this museum was way too geared for children.  Besides that the information presented was short and not in depth.\n\nAs a sort of topper to the whole experience when I was interacting with one of the exhibits a very rude employee decided to make me feel completely un-welcomed in the museum.  He said to me, \"You know that is for 4 year olds?\"  I immediately looked around looking for the sign that says you may not interact with this exhibit if you are over the age of 4.  The whole point of a museum is to educate and inform the visitors regardless of their age.  I could see maybe admonishing an adult who was hogging an exhibit stopping children from using it, but I was more than accommodating towards all the other guests there.\n\nIn short I wouldn't waste my money here.   Likely, unless you are a child under the age of 9, you probably wont get much out of it and even at that age you probably wont get much out of it.  Whoever is the curator or head of this museum really needs to have another look at whether they are actually providing a service to their patrons.\n\nAfter this long complaint you may be wondering why I gave them two stars instead of just one.  The one saving grace was that the museum had at least some educational properties to it, although not that many.  It really was a glorified expensive playground, but at least there was some education incorporated into the exhibits.  So they didn't fail completely.", "business_id": "MwmXm48K2g2oTRe7XmssFw", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-03-28", "type": "review"}

We parked across the street next to the Diamondbacks stadium for not an obscene amount of money, but considering we are in Phoenix and not San Francisco, it was excessive. Plus there was some other event going on so we had to drive up several floors and there were annoying cones blocking off most of the available parking. WTF! \n\nThen we got to the lobby. The line was waaayyyy worse than the MVD. And the lobby is also pure concrete (think bomb shelter), so if you're trying to pull up a Groupon or something on your phone... give up. The cashier was kind enough to pull up our Groupons on her computer. The line was also complete with more than its fair share of impatient, screaming children who needed their naps. \n\nThe actual exhibit was interesting.

There were a couple of hitches, but overall we had a good time.\n\nFirstly, the membership desk process is smooth and easy, and because I purchased a membership for a family of 4 (but have 3 littles plus my husband, making us a party of 5) it was only an additional $10 on top of the Groupon to add another child.  I think that was a great deal!  Also, we parked in the Civic Center Garage by the Science Center and the membership desk validated our parking stub, making a typical $12 parking fee only $5 for the visit.\n\nSecondly, the exhibits are FANTASTIC!  We didn't see everything there was to offer, but we viewed quite a bit and all of my kidlets had a blast.  FYI: The weather and natural forces exhibit on the 3rd floor was stupendous! \n\nLastly, we ate a late lunch at the Lab Cafe inside the Science Center, and the food was reasonably priced and pretty tasty: kids meals average about $5 each and adults are around $8 (both sans drinks).  But the flies that were continually buzzing around the dining room and our table were a MAJOR turn off for me and my little guy who's a bona fide germaphobe when it comes to flies landing near his food.  Also, the trashcan right by the exit door was literally overflowing with discarded drink containers, and in the course of 45 minutes I watched no less than 3 employees walk up and meticulously clean the glass doors right next to the overflowing trashcan, and not bother to empty the trash while they were there!

Next up, I stopped by the gift shop to pick up a little congrats gift for my sis and brother in law. It's a bit overpriced in there, but what can you expect since they know they have a captive audience! \n\nThe maternity rooms are really nice and have huge windows overlooking the mounts to the south. The staff was friendly and helpful. Later on, I took a run down to the cafeteria (note: take the stairs if you can...the elevator is slow!) The cafeteria is cheap and has pretty much everything you can think of ... including donuts! \n\nIn addition, their NICU is awesome and they are connected to Phoenix Children's Hospital, so I know my man baby nephew is in good hands!", "business_id": "CAD0tKIttOTTgT7TMJa-lQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-03-04", "type": "review"}

I had a bike crash on a Friday at lunch hour.  I rode my bike home, to ditch my computer and work files, and to make sure it was safe.  Took a taxi to Good Sam, and it took almost the entire taxi ride for my insurance to verify I was headed to an ER that is \"in Network.\"  Pretty stresful, but once I walked through the doors, most of that changed.\n\nSure, there was a lot of painful waiting around in a hallway in a wheelchair.  But, hey, it's an emergency room.  I found the system to be very organized and the employees to be helpful and compassionate.  There were a couple of fails on the doctor's part.  She offered me pain meds, and then forgot to order them.  I had to ask a nurse, and then they arrived quickly.  Doc also forgot to order antibiotics for my road rash, but I received a voice mail shortly after discharge that hooked me up with germ-fighters.\n \nWhen I was discharged, I indicated I intended to walk to Walgreens, since I live in the neighborhood.  I was referred to the hospital pharmacy, which I expected to soak me.  But it only cost me $14 for 2 kinds of pain meds and stool softener (yes, I said it and no, it hasn't worked yet).  Pharmacy gave me a beeper and I was able to peruse the lovely and overpriced gift shop.  If I was hospitalized, there were many items there that I would appreciate receiving.  Good gift shop.\n\nI was there for approximately 4.5 hours.  I had triage, xrays, and an EKG.  I was admitted immediately, no waiting.  I don't have much experience with ERs, so there you go.\n\nProps to the skinny blond \"tech\" guy, who entertained me by exchanging restaurant reviews while he irrigated my wound.", "business_id": "CAD0tKIttOTTgT7TMJa-lQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-05-28", "type": "review"}

In VERY bad motorcycle accident where I broke my left leg, pelvis and dislocated my toe. Also had very deep road rash.\n\n2. Two instances of painful kidney stones.\n\nFor # 1, I was transported via ambulence to the nearest hospital which meant by default, I HAD to go there as the accident happened on I-10 tunnel. I found the staff to be very gruff (in general) and the surgeon was even worse. Do not recall his last name, but his first name was \"Michael\". He basically told me to \"try harder\" when I would try to get up and stand by my bed. I kept telling him I was dizzy and felt like I had to faint. Turns out, I lost a lot of blood during the accident and was needing a transfusion. After I get 2 bags of blood, I'm good to go again! My point being, these asshole doctors really do need to LISTEN to their patients! I also had a horrid night RN come in and was a little rough and bossy to check my vitals during my week stay. How are you gonna feel if someone pokes your damn arm in the middle of deep rest in the night? No \"excuse me\" or anything! I remedied that be asking the Charge Nurse to never send her my way again.I also had my shoes stolen from my room. Not cool.\n\nAs for #2, I had to wait a LONG time to even be examined. I was literally in so much pain that I couldn't even sit down. For those of you who don't know how kidney stones feel, just imagine a damned cactus being shoved up your urethra. I'm not kidding. I was there pacing back and forth without any help. After pacing around and begging for something to kill the pain, the RN gave me something and had me pee through what looked like a vegetable strainer.

I've experienced better\" fits perfectly. I was so excited to come eat here :( Like Los Compadres it had been on the list for a long time. A 4 star Mexican place with very few bad reviews seemed like a safe bet. This place also showed up on Chow Bella a few days ago. I was prepared for another kick ass meal but figured I was in for meh service based on what I read. Seems like I received the complete 180 of an experience.\n\nGot there about 7:30 Saturday night. The place was 65% capacity at most. This surprised the heck out of me considering the time/reviews and recent writeup. Figured I was doomed for a night of waiting. We were at out table within 2 minutes and the waitress was there to take our drink order and drop off salsa in less then 5. She quickly returned with some HUGE glasses of water an a basket of chips. I was ready for these amazing hot from the fryer chips I had read so much about. What I got instead was room temp chips of which 1/2 had a nice freshly dipped in grease then cooled coat on them. I'm a good sport so I tried one of the greasy ones and all I could taste was room temp oil from a fryer that needed fresh oil in a bad bad way.. Blech :(\n\nThe salsa however was very tasty. The red was far from burning hot that I had read so much about. It was warm but far from spicy and was one of the best things I would eat all evening. The green was also very flavorful and masked the gross chips well.\n\nWe ordered a huge pile of food including a cheese crisp and guacamole which hit the table quickly. We were then in for a good 20 minute wait before the rest of the food showed up.\n\nFood Details:\n\nGuacamole:\nVery simple prep here. Avocado, Onion, Salt and 800lbs of tomatoes. I absolutely HATE fresh tomatoes but that's just a personal preference. The quac was fresh and tasty. There was nothing \"wrong\" with it there's just much better at countless places.\n\nRice:\nSo far from exciting I don't specifically recall. I just remember having a bite and moving on. Was a little greasy and bland :/\n\nBeans:\nJust went I thought dinner was a complete waste I took a few bites of these and WOW! some of the best beans I've ever had. Pretty sure there is a huge amount of lard but who cares. The texture was perfect.. the flavor was perfect.. I could have been satisfied with a side of quac, couple tortillas and a huge bowl of beans. Half of it was smashed/creamed and the other was whole beans. I'm not even a bean person and it was the only part of my plate that had been scrapped clean.\n\nCheese Crisp:\nNo real crisp at all. Just a tortilla with melted cheese and a major pool of grease.\n\nGreen Chili Tamale:\nThe texture was very rubbery but it was at least spicy. This was another \"not bad but far from great\" items.\n\nGround Beef Taco:\nThe shell was nice and crispy and didn't taco fail. The meat inside was this super fine texture but did not have a lot of flavor.\n\nChili Relleno:\nOh man.. I've been trying to figure this one out. Terrible is the only word I have for it. There were two of them on the table and they were both the same. The batter was literally water logged and there was nothing on the plate to do that. They weren't greasy.. they were watery. I'm nearly positive these were made in house, frozen, and heated to order. There's no other way they could get a spongy soggy texture like that any other way.\n\nEnchilada:\nSuffered from more cheese on top of my enchilada then inside of it and a serious lack of red sauce. Don't get me wrong.. I like cheese but it was 10% red sauce and 90% cheese. I couldn't even really taste the red sauce to see if it was any good. The enchilada was a corn tortilla with a sprinkle of cheese on the inside. It was literally flat on the plate like someone folded it then smashed it down that's how skimpy the filling was.\n\nRed Sauce:\nDon't know.. there was not enough of it on anything to actually taste it.\n\n\nCould this have been an off night? I guess its possible but I order so much variety that it pretty much rules out having a bad experience because a single item wasn't good that night. Is this the worst Mexican in town? Far from it.. But there are so many other great places I feel sorry for anyone who might call this their only Mexican stop when they have a craving. They are missing out on some real good food out there.", "business_id": "hWhVP-28LYP3llaMlAJ_JA", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-03-22", "type": "review"}

About the beans:  they're as good as advertised, with a salty/creamy (but not textureless) combo that's bliss.  Too bad the rice was so ordinary and bland.  But no one has big expectations for Mexican style rice, so only a small knock here.\n\nThe green chili burro ($5, additional $3 for beans and rice) is top notch, near Rito's in quality, but with a better construction.  Tender and spicy and not too soupy to soak through the tortilla.  Generous portion, too. \n\nFor kicks I also ordered a crunchy taco with ground beef and potato.  On the good side, it was BIG for $2.60, and full of goodies, lots of cheese and a good but not excessive helping of lettuce.  Good value.

Not appetizing at all.\n\nMy friend got a chicken taco and enchilada and said the chicken was particularly flavorful and tasted like it was braised, which is uncommon in a town where most Mexican places boil and shred their chicken.\n\nThe atmosphere inside is perfectly respectable for this kind of restaurant.  The neighborhood isn't great, but it's a well lit parking lot and there's an attendant watching the premises and the parking lot.

The menudo actually tastes homemade, not like it was just poured out of a can and reheated.  As far as the rest of their dishes, they also have a variety of tasty platters, such as different kinds of tacos, enchiladas, and \"burros\" (not burritos.... but the actual correct term of a big Mexican wrap; the term \"giant\" or \"big\" burrito is actually a contradiction or an oxymoron, but anyway I digress... back to the review!).  They also have chips and salsa, both the red and green variety.\n\nThe food is actually tasty and flavorful, unlike many of the other \"-berto's\" fast food Mexican places all around town, which for the most part, is bland and all tastes the same. Sure, it might be a bit unfair for me to make that comparison, since Rosita's is a restaurant and not a fast food joint.

But we had to wait an hour for the performance so we started talking with bartenders that was there and met Shelley, and she was pretty cool so we said hey where do you work we will stop by and cause you some grief, she looked at us and said it's not a straight bar, we thought eh who cares, so we made plans to go to Cash Inn Country Bar on one of our fun nights out,,,,\n\nFor those who are scared to interact with the gay, this isn't your bar, stay away.  But for us it was fun, Shelley was shocked to see us there, we sat at the bar, a few of us danced, it was a fun time. \n\nMet some cool people, shared some laughs, had some drinks, friends and I had a blast, we probably will go back. Staff and people were friendly, dance floor is nice and roomy, and more than country was being played, yes it was a fun night!", "business_id": "c6sTwXAwIAgf2YQtA4ZWHg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-05-21", "type": "review"}

Secondly, I have never been into a more judgemental place with truly rude patrons and staff in my life. I understand I don't look like a lesbian anymore, but that's no reason to treat me with disrespect at this establishment. Also, I do not care how old you are and if you're friends with the owner or not, I will not stand quietly in the corner while you talk shit about Trans people. On top of it I got kicked out after just showing up because I was \"too drunk\" when really the bitch who picked an argument with me cause she wanted to say shit about another lgbt community decided to go tattle on me. You're right tho, I was too drunk, too drunk to deal with your dumb lesbian bullshit. Basically, if you're not a lesbian don't go anywhere near this place as you will get treated like shit and then get kicked out for voicing your opinion. If you are a lesbian, then enjoy hanging out in a port o potty all night with fellow closed minded members of your community. Worst lesbian bar in the nation.

Neither time was it my fault, and both times it was repaired by Ultra Collision. Well, it's 2015 now and my 2013 car was hit (again, not my fault). I called Ultra Collision to see if/when they could fix my car. During that call I also made the comment that my main reason for contacting them again was due to the previous repairs being undetectable. What I mean is, you weren't able to tell that my truck had ever been hit. Steve assured me the same quality workmanship was being offered, and in fact the same guy that painted my truck would be painting my car. I scheduled for the repair, and on the day I dropped the car off Steve had 1 of his people take me to the rental car place, He said it would be faster for him to take me, than to have them come get me. My car was done 2 days prior to the promised date, and again the repair was undetectable. I called Enterprise to attempt to coordinate the return of my rental, and they said simply leave the rental at the Body Shop and they'd come get it. In short, the quality of the repair could not have been better, and not having to do ANYTHING with the insurance company/rental car people made it pain free. Although I hope to NEVER be a customer again (no one wants to be in a wreck), if/when it happens I'll be back.

I'd never heard of Whataburger before so I thought David Foster Wallace was making it up when he refers to the \"Whataburger Southwest Junior Invitational\" in Infinite Jest (the tennis tournament is made up). When I found out it was a real place, I had to come here. \n\nIt wasn't bad and kudos to the woman taking my order. She upsold me to a meal - \"are you sure you don't want a meal, honey?\" Her voice indicated that she was genuinely concerned about my general hunger situation which, admittedly, was extremely high at that very moment. Then there was the wait outside the take-out window, probably 10 - 15 minutes in total. I  figured they must be assembling one king-hell burger in there. But more likely, it took that much time to fill the giant Whataburger cup with Fanta Orange soda. I let out an audible gasp when I saw it - holy crap it was big. Like I could have gone hiking in the desert for miles with nothing but that giant cup of soda to sustain me. \n\nThe burger was pretty big. Bigger than anything you'll find at any other fast food joint and don't forget the wait, I think the wait is key. Because that wait is what sets this place apart from say, a Mickey D's or an In-n-Out (which, incidentally, Whataburger is way better. Like the first time I ate an In-n-Out burger that's exactly what it did). So sitting outside waiting behind the big white SUV with the smokey exhaust you're inhaling for the ten minutes it takes for them to make their burger, plus the ten or so minutes it takes for them to cook your own and  assemble your meal, fill the giant styrofoam Whataburger cup with Fanta Orange soda, and deep fry your peach pie (very tasty) lets you reflect on the state of your life in relationship to your expectation of wanting a fast food restaurant to act as an instant gratification machine, when, in fact, by going to those other places, you are perhaps missing out on all this personal attention to your burger, meal, soda, dessert assembly (and don't forget that caring moms-like voice so concerned for your hunger situation), in the space of which time you are allowed to reach out to loved ones via your cellphone or text-messaging system (I was able to call my husband twice and read a magazine article about hiking in Tempe), and think about what you want to do next w/r/t your art and just what the fuck are you doing with your life anyway that you think waiting outside the Whataburger for ten minutes is keeping you from actualizing some potential self that may be far better served by simply having to wait a moment for your food?", "business_id": "ixTr1qXUFGTzyaZUuCDDvg", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-04-20", "type": "review"}

The real estate is limited, so parking is compact and circles around the back of the building.\n\nThe dining area is mainly indoors, but there is also a small patio facing the back portion of the parking lot, which is not very scenic. Inside there is art on the wall that can be purchased.\n\nThey serve wraps, bowls and salads. The food has been pretty good, although it did not knock my socks off. I ordered the Baja Bowl, which is described on their online menu as \"Southwestern chicken atop garlic rice, black beans, Monterey jack cheese and topped with lime sour cream and pico de gallo.\" It was OK, but the chicken was dry and cut in fairly large chunks. It could have possibly been microwaved -- not sure, but there were no southwest flavors to speak of. I have done a better job of cooking chicken on my George Foreman grill at home. Perhaps the garlic rice would have helped with the flavor, but I had substituted the rice with organic brown rice which did little to add flavor. Sour cream was not \"lime\". There was a small slice of lime served on the edge of the bowl. I would not bother ordering this again -- especially if I have a craving for some southwest food.\n\nOn another recent visit I ordered a wrap called \"Prince of Thai's - Spicy peanut chicken with baby spinach, garlic rice, fresh ginger slaw, cucumber pico and red onion wrapped in a spinach tortilla.\" That had better flavor than the baja bowl. Vegetable ingredients were fresh and good. Again, I was not very impressed with the chicken chunks.\n\nOne thing I think That's A Wrap needs to address is the use of styrafoam cups. Afterall their slogan is \"Healthy Food for a Hungry Planet\" and they have a link for a new restaurant \"Green\" for Vegan food on their website. For such an artsy, earthy place, I would have thought That's A Wrap would have made more conscious, earth-friendly choices. For that reason and the bland chicken, I give them an average rating only.", "business_id": "ZoQAOnEFnyHjSpomtfqesA", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-03-08", "type": "review"}

That's the feeling I had yesterday afternoon when I foolishly decided to try La Tolteca for the first time...\n\nWhy was this a foolish decision? Because I got sick. Super duper sick. Which I should have known was going to happen because the Fish Burro I ordered tasted terrible. And now, here I am, 24 hours later, still trying to keep fluids in my body in between trips to the bathroom.\n\nNow I know what you're thinking... \"What does he expect? He ordered a Fish Burro!\" And I know. You're right. It's just that I've had such good luck with fish tacos at a couple of other restaurants lately (Canteen, Tacos Atoyac) that I decided to see what sort of magic La Tolteca could create with their mahi mahi. Apparently their in-house magician has Mondays off.\n\nI seriously don't know why there's so many four and five star reviews of this place on Yelp. It's not that great. Even if my burrito hadn't made me ill, I still would have felt compelled to write something to balance all the positive reviews on here. Maybe the corn tortillas they use on their tacos deserve the accolades that other reviewers can't seem to stop talk about, but my flour tortilla was below average. It was dry and it tasted like paper.\n\nAs for the burro, I specifically asked about the filling prior to ordering it and I was told that it only contained cabbage, fresco cheese and guacamole. Sadly, when I took my first bite, out spewed a white, mayonnaise-like substance. The burro's filling was more like a fish salad of sorts and it tasted off. Very off. And the fish wasn't hot. Actually, nothing it the burro was the least bit warm. And the guacamole was on the side--not inside the burro. But again, I was starving at this point so I took it down. Every last bite.\n\nI knew immediately that something was wrong. I considered removing the food from my body as soon as I got outside, but I decided to keep my finger out of mouth and let things settle. Big mistake. There would be no settling. I consider myself to have an iron gut, too. I can basically eat anything in any quantity (not that I do this often) but normally I have good luck. I haven't been this sick since eating food from a middle-of-nowhere farmstand while bike touring in the Caribbean.\n\nI'm giving La Tolteca two stars because I did like their hot sauces--all of them. And they have cheap beer, too ($2 Coronas all day, every day). However, as Michael S. noted in an earlier review, everything I tried tasted off. Tangy is fine when that's what a place is going for, but everything I ate tasted slightly tangy in a ugh-this-is-going-to-make-me-sick sort of way. Not cool.\n\nSo that's that. I really don't think I'll be back. I have no desire to explore the bakery case and there's way too many small taquerias around to take any more chances with this high-volume, supermarket of a restaurant.", "business_id": "apCfJVnRyaw6oVUBKujpUQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-05-03", "type": "review"}

They brought a wonton and egg roll with her #7 Thai combo (can't remember what it was called). Both were overfried. She mentioned it's like it was fried then refried. HOWEVER, the insides of the egg roll were quite tasty. Wonton- not so much. Corn soup came with my #1 Pad Thai lunch special...it was broth with corn. Very simple. I suppose I expected a little more but it was exactly what they said, corn soup. I should have gotten a salad. \n\nMoving on to the actual lunch. Pad Thai, I've never had much Thai food and I enjoyed this quite a bit. Now I can't compare this to anything else so it's just my taste buds talking.

But first a little back-story....  My dad's whole family worked at a Chinese restaurant in Philly from before I was born until the late 1990's.  My mother says she craved Chinese food the whole time she was pregnant with me and by proxy got me hooked on Chinese in the womb. I bless her for having done so. I love Chinese and could eat it every day...willingly.  I've tried Chinese in every city and country I've ever lived or visited, as I always love to see what's out there and experience the regional variances and interpretations. I can usually find something good, no matter how nasty or base a buffet, or made-to-order.  And Lord knows I love take-out and a movie on the sofa.  Great nite, rite?\n\nA few weeks ago I convinced the better half to go pick up Gourmet House of Hong Kong, if I paid and he drove. Deal. Done.  I ordered on the phone - no problems. It's rite down the street from our house, so dinner was steaming hot and in the living room within 20 minutes.  We queued up the DVD and we're ready to go.\n\nThe fried rice was yummy and OK.  Not the best I've had but not the worst either.  The BBQ pork app was good and I liked the dipping sauce it came with. Everything else was skank.  I'd say avoid the noodles at all costs. They were like nasty over-cooked spaghetti in a watery, flavorless sauce.  Even with soy sauce added, they did nothing for me.  \n\nI'm kind of sad b/c the other reviews on Yelp seemed pretty good.  The place is not that great looking from the outside, and never having been inside, I can't comment on that -- but I would never get take-out from here again.  At least we didn't get sick.  It was just bland-o-rama, which makes me sad.  I even threw-out the leftovers, which has only ever happened  one other time with Chinese take-out, when I left for vacation the next day and didn't want to stink up the fridge.", "business_id": "ykfTh6HI219NoMsWBxulxw", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-03-01", "type": "review"}

Michael and his lovely wife are no longer involved, but the new owners retained the same cooks.  The food has always been very good, and little was lost in the transition.  \n\nWe once tried the typical Americanized dishes (sweet and sour pork, lemon chicken, etc.) and weren't too impressed.  We don't order that style of food anymore.  \n\nWe never go for lunch.  We like the dinner menu, and prefer to eat \"family style\", with the various dishes on a lazy susan in the middle of the round tables.  \n\nLots of Asian families are eating there, especially on weekends, so you know the place is going to have good, authentic Hong Kong style food.\n\nWe tend to order these dishes most often:\n\nHot and Sour Soup \nGreen Pepper Beef w/ Black Bean Sauce (over crispy chow mein noodles)\nHunan Beef\nKung Pao Chicken or Shrimp\nMu Shu Pork\n\nThe Hot and Sour Soup is always good, and at times it is excellent.  We do see some variation in flavor, but we always start our meal with it.  Even on an \"off day\" it is still good.  You hit the Hot and Sour Soup JACKPOT when it has that perfect balance of heat (from black pepper) and dark vinegar, along with the meats and veggies.  I tend to discern Chinese restaurants by their Hot and Sour Soup, and this version rarely disappoints.\n\nThe Green Pepper Beef w/ Black Bean Sauce (over crispy chow mein noodles) is so good!  I could eat it every day for a month and not get tired of it.  If you like black beans in your Chinese food, you'll love this dish.\n\nThe Hunan Beef is a dish I don't find anywhere else.  It is what I think is their \"take\" on twice-cooked beef.  It is strips of tenderized beef, cut thin, that has been dredged in cornstarch and deep fried.  Then they stir-fry it with a dark, pungent, spicy sauce that has both sweetness and a sour tang.  It is strongly flavored, and quite satisfying.\n\nThe Kung Pao is standard, but very good.  Hot.  Pungent.  Exactly as it should be.\n\nThe Mu Shu Pork is excellent, and, as other reviewers have indicated, the pancakes are spread with plum sauce and filled at your table by the server.  They use a spoon and a set of chopsticks quite adroitly, so they never touch the food with their hands.  Very fun.  \n\nThose are our favorites.

It is indeed a tiny space on the inside and half the seats have a direct view into the kitchen area, which is kind of homey.  I'm pretty small, so the size inside wasn't an issue for me, but claustrophobes and bigger people might feel squished.\n\nI ordered a hamburger and fries and my friend got an egg sandwich.  The burger was pretty good, but relatively small in comparison to what's generally served at restaurants.  If you're really hungry or a big eater, you'll probably want to go for the double burger.  The fries were good - nice and crisp.  My friend was pretty happy with her egg sandwich but unhappy with her cup of water, which was apparently pretty bad even for tap water.  They have a bunch of organic sodas, along with Coke and Diet Coke, if you're like me and can't wash down a burger and fries with anything but a carbonated beverage.\n\nOverall, I thought it was a pretty cool place and will definitely return with more friends in tow.  (Possibly for one of their movie nights...movies + tasty food = a good time).  Bonus points for their helping with the downtown rejuvenation while also supporting local businesses (Schreiner's, Mary Coyle's).", "business_id": "tb24fvNJfHhyKEXkKn12Xw", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-04-16", "type": "review"}

Just take a gander at the picture offered here on this page and tell me what would stop you from going there to eat an unbelievably delicious basket of fries and burger, each such perfectly seasoned to compliment one another, its as if this stuff was made from the craftsmanship of a gastronomic grill master.  The burger easily beats out even cult-status places like Delux or In n Out, and their handcut fries are subtly crunchy and salty.  Their salsa burger topping absolutely rocks the block.  And I don't know if their ketchup is made by the Magical Man from Happy Land who lives in a gumdrop house on Lollipop Lane, but something about it slaps a toothy grin on my head.\n\nThe picnic tables outside make you feel like you are doing something productive while you gorge yourself.  Like its okay to ingest a thousand calories as long as you are given the impression that you are on a hike or something.  But whatever.  Its all class.\n\nMy only beef (Heh.  Pardon the pun.)  is that Welcome Diner is closed on Sundays and that they force me to battle the tweakers at the 7th and Roosevelt Circle K as I spring for a pack of P-funks and a $20 bill due to their 'no cards' policy.

Get there... now. Payton is known for pushing limits and incorporating fresh, local ingredients. The menu will likely change every week, if not every night, so I'm not sure if my recap will help all that much, but here goes.\n\nThe neighborhood is sketchy, the place is tiny, and the accommodations are \"rustic\", so if you're all into the Scottsdale scene or flashing your dough, don't bother. That being said, Shantal mentioned that being there made her feel like she was camping every night, and I have to admit the evening had a vacation feel to it... National Lampoon's style!\n\nYou can instantly tell that Payton is having a blast and it shows on his face and in the food. We were seated on a collection of old dining chairs at a makeshift table of 2x8s and construction horses in the middle of the front yard, with a candle to light our way... I knew it was going to be a sweet evening!\n\nWe started with the burrata that was lightly seasoned with truffle oil and cracked pepper. Unfortunately a lot of people are adding burrata to their menus and they have no idea that this fresh, creamy, delicate version is how it's truly meant to be. It was served with slices of toast that I expected to be the brick-hard version to which I've become accustomed. Imagine my surprise as I bit into a spongy, buttery slice of bread with just a crunch of the crust! Delicious.\n\nThe porcini foie gras terrine will scare those faint of heart, but it's amazing and the pear butter adds this velvety, sweet flavor that just makes it unforgettable. I wasn't a fan of the pate', but it was a combination of pickle, horseradish, and mustard flavors with chunks in the loaf... all things I can personally only handle in moderation individually and generally dislike, so it was exactly as described. The mains arrived and the Sonoma lamb sugo proved to be an interesting choice. It's not something you would eat on a regular basis, but I'm so glad I got to try it. The shreds of lamb meat were piled on top of a bowl of hearty fettuccine with perfectly cooked chickpeas and dollops of cream that muted any gaminess of the meat. Then you would get a bite of golden raisin to kick in a touch of sweetness; pretty cool combination of flavors and textures without being over the top.\n\nPerhaps the biggest surprise of the night was the bowl of Bolognese that was planted in front of us, it blew me away and I have no idea why!! Payton, what's your secret with something so simple? Dessert followed with apple pie that could've been much tastier if it were warmed with a scoop of ice cream, but all was rescued with a huge chunk of bread pudding that puts my mother's recipe to shame (and it was served warmed with a scoop of ice cream :). \n\nAll in all, we had a wonderful night with fabulous food and fun friends and we didn't want the night to end. If you want a hint of adventure, get to Welcome Diner before the end of May... seriously... National Lampoon's style.\n\nps: It's BYOB!", "business_id": "tb24fvNJfHhyKEXkKn12Xw", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-04-08", "type": "review"}

Chef, I hear, tries to keep it real and keep it local and fresh when sourcing his menu, so it changes each week.

We opted for the former.  My darling dining partner and I shared all four dishes.\n\nTHOSE DAMN GREEN BEANS\nWe started with green beans, as crisp as they were picked, with just one tip snapped off, just like my grandmother taught me.  These were served with a citrus creme fraiche and some recently picked tarragon.  I always love dairy with tarragon, and this dish, served cool (not cold) if I remember, was dusted with local bee pollen, granular bits that taste of honey and something else and melt on your tongue.\n\nMOZZARELLA\nThe menu insists there's basil in this tangential rendition of caprese -- and there probably is -- but the takeaway message from this panko-encrusted slab of mozzarella with the sweetest tomatoes I've eaten is a sweet-n-sour burst with every olive oily bite.

Not so fast, Barilla Boy.  Payton Curry's gnocchi, I believe, are (dry?) pan-seared on both sides,   keeping all the doughy, gummy deliciousness often lost in the water.  The madeira wine and cream reduction here smothers the pillowy gnocchi and tooth-tender walnuts and squiggly good morel mushrooms in a way that makes you close your eyes, shut off your hearing, and attempt to pour all of your sensory energy into taste and smell.

I always looked for it when I passed it on my way down Roosevelt but always seemed to miss it.  I practically smacked myself in the forehead when we arrived today.  I felt stupid, but then again, there are some places I just can't see until I plan to stop there.\n\nIt took some convincing to get my husband to give a place other than his favourite Joe's Diner a chance for a delicious (post hangover) brunch/breakfast a chance.  We got there a little early due to it being their last brunch weekend before summer and I am paranoid of crowds and hipsters.\n\nWe arrived and found ourselves seats under an umbrella in the shade.  We got some water from the cooler and perused the menu and specials.  After some deliberating (sunrise sandwich or holy puerco?) and discussion (welcome breakfast has no meat -- I need my protein at breakfast), he went with the special boudin breakfast and I got the holy puerco.  We both had fresh squeezed ojs and beignets.\n\nIt was worth it.  Dear goodness I have not tasted pork jowl cruncy bits like those ever (and their meat is provided by meat shop and shreiners!).  The combination of flavors on the puerco thing was just delicious.  And the hashbrowns were fresh and not too crispy and not overpowering and flavorful.  I kind of wanted some sour cream to go with the flavors and make them like a crunchy baked potato.\n\nThe beignets are not as fluffy as the ones I remember in New Orleans but definitely will satisfy this girls desire for fried dough.  They are yummy and powdered and you must be careful or the sugar will make you cough.  The honey is also oh so good.\n\nThe husband very much enjoyed his boudin special and it was gone very quickly.  He said it was all very tasty and he was glad we braved the heat for the opportunity to try the breakfast before it is gone.\n\nWe also got a hurricane to share at the very end.  It tastes like juice, or sunshine in a cup.  But it does pack a punch.  I felt that drink (the few sips I had) by the time we got back home.  And then I crashed in a delicious food coma.", "business_id": "tb24fvNJfHhyKEXkKn12Xw", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-04-27", "type": "review"}

The food, the service, the facility...all are within a clear and well executed vision. And while I respect that vision, I think that, for me, it was just too much.

I was a little unsure if I was headed to the right place, since Welcome Diner is located in a neighborhood, but I'm so glad that I found it.  My food was delicious and the staff seemed genuinely friendly and interested in how I thought that the food was, which is always the sign of a good chef.  I did have to wait a little bit, but I didn't mind too much, since it's a small establishment.  People should be forewarned that there is very limited seating indoors and that most of the seating is outdoors on the patio.  I personally thought that it was nice to sit outside, especially with the mural on painted on the fence/wall, but I understand that it might not be so comfortable to sit outside at the picnic tables in extremely hot Phoenix weather, especially if it was a busy day and you had to share a bench/table with a bunch of people you don't know.\n\nI got a fried green tomato sandwich on sourdough with house-made corn salsa and arugula.  It was fantastically delicious.  The ingredients were fresh and everything from the toasting of the bread to the battering of the tomatoes was well-executed.  Although the sandwich was filling and came with a slice of cantaloupe, I wish that it had come with some sort of side, like home-made potato chips, for the price.  Alongside my sandwich, I had a tasty Four Peaks stout.", "business_id": "tb24fvNJfHhyKEXkKn12Xw", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-04-09", "type": "review"}

Now it's so much more than that.\n\nHave you ever watched someone hand you a glass of local red wine blend through a trailer window? How about a Sazerac? Well, it's time to change that. (Here I am assuming you said no. If you said yes, please un-see this section and continue.) When you start your meal with a southern throwback cocktail and finish it with homemade beignets, you best believe that whatever comes in between is going to knock your socks off. This is fine because you're probably sitting outside, so the dress code is pretty nonexistent, anyway.\n\nMy crew ordered the three most talked-about items on the menu. The peanut butter burger is the safe option + a bit of \"flare\" that is essentially peanut sauce. The meat is delicious, as is the bun and everything else between it. We also had the Carol, which was a unique BBQ pulled pork & biscuit sandwich with slaw... a mustard-y spin on a stack of down-home delicious. Last but DON'T YOU EVER THINK LEAST, the Bumblebee fried chicken & biscuit sandwich with honey and amazing b&b pickles. Us Southerners opted to scoot the mustard to the side and let the honey shine, but you could probably do anything to this fried chicken and it would still be incr-edible. Just get it. Get a bucket of it.\n\nNow let's talk beignets. (Don't you wish people said that to you more often? You're welcome.) You can get them with powdered sugar & honey or peanut butter & jam. The waitress literally said the pb&j beignets were her favorite thing in the world, and then quickly added her daughter as a frontrunner to the favorites list. Not knowing her taste in dessert, or daughters for that matter, I trusted her immediately and was thrilled with the combination of light, lemony fried dough juxtaposed with fresh berries and creamy peanut butter. Ain't nothing wrong with the classic, but damn it, it's 2014. The matrimony between pb&j and beignet shouldn't even be questioned.\n\nTL;DR - The Welcome Diner isn't just tasty, it's soulful and lovely.

The service is ridiculously pleasant, with various servers casually checking in with you and chatting you up during the meal. Dinner was probably one of the best meals we have ever had- to start: pulled pork fries smothered in tangy BBQ sauce and topped with homemade cool coleslaw. Then the Welcome Burger, which was moan inducing and gone in about 4 bites. We followed this with their summer salad of watermelon, tomato, ginger pickled rinds, and arugula surrounded by a delicious basil cashew pesto. Unbelievably refreshing. To finish we went with the honey drizzled beignets and basically licked the plate clean. Oh and also the cocktails here are amazing - heaven on earth. And we spent about $60 on all of it. Such a ridiculous bargain. Writing this from the lovely shaded patio waiting for our eggs and biscuits to arrive.

I'm not a religious man. Easter is just another day of the week for me, however I am a man who can appreciate a day off work. That said, I am grateful that you were open so that I and my degenerate crew could enjoy your establishment. \n\nThing 2: Thank you for having delicious food. That is all.\n\nThis was our first time trying Welcome Diner. We pretty much almost tried one of everything... because why not. \n\nThe Fried Green Tomato Sandwich and the Biscuits and Gravy were my top two items. As I've declared unabashedly in the past, I'm from the south and these two items brought me back home. Very well done in their own unique way. \n\nI think the thing that was most surprising about WD is that they were churning out this great food from such an unassuming place. It looks like they just dropped a little ol' diner right in a residential neighborhood. The location is also just east of Roosevelt Row, in a slightly more rough area. Not bad, but some people might shy away. \n\nThe only issue I see, particularly with summer coming up is that, if I'm not mistaken (which I could be), majority of the seating is outside. There are sun shades, but from our experience, even with said shades, if you're sitting in the wrong spot, you could still get pretty toasty from the sun. \n\nWe sat outside on our visit because it was beautiful. Although as the morning moved along it did get uncomfortable at times when the sun would be at just the right angle to blast you for just long enough you could feel the sunburn happening. \n\nAll that said, get there while the weather is good! And if you do get warm, they make some refreshing mixed drinks (I had the Hurricane) and they also have a nice little beer selection as well. I almost forgot about that...

Some of the bartenders can be rude..so watch out!!\n\nDance floor can get packed real quick, so you have to find a spot where its not too much drunk people and enough space to actually move around. \n\nPatio nice too but I dislike cigarettes so I go outside for some air and go right back inside for dancing\n\nBathroom lines for girls are crazy LONG!!! Why do guys have a bigger bathroom than us gals?? We have 3 stalls, one sink and a small foggy mirror. I hate having to wait at least 15 mins in line just to get inside. \n\nParking is a bit crowded; but you just have to park away from the club and walk.

This is where the comparison to showgirls ends.  Actually, I don't rememer.  Did showgirls feature a stripper in her 3rd trimester?\n\nWhereas the tagline for Showgirls was \"Leave your inhibitions at the door\", Bandaids follows up with \"... and your guns, knives, nerve gases, babies, peg legs, raptor jesuses, gold crown deodorizers, and herpes.\"  Although I think most in there ignored that last one.\n\nSo, upon entrance, you are greeted with a very Judge Dredd-like chain-link protected cashier who takes your Abe Lincoln and motions you over to the bar.  One thing about strip clubs in general, is, you don't really wanna schooch by anyone ... but at Bandaids, they make this awkward dream a reality for everyone!  The walk up to the bar is like cutting to seats 34 and 35 at Giants Stadium.  I felt like Tyler Durden contemplating whether to give the vatos the butt or the crotch as they stare blankly at \"the talent\".\n\nWhoa boy.  This place has talent like the old Washington Bullets ... but shorter, fatter, and more pregnant.\n\nI gave one of my buddies a dollar to snap into one of the monster's string and she gave him a \"whusssuuup\" that featured her sweet gold grill.  To appreciate this, you must know that my friend is quite possibly the sweetest guy on the planet, and gave a friendly \"Hi!\" to her in return before about-facing to our bistro style table where 8 Coors Lights were posting up our jaws.\n\nThis was a nice, natural cue for a quick exit, rattled our half-drained beers into the bins and shot out.  We couldn't stomach anymore of anything.\n\nBut wait.\n\nOn this page you will notice Jason C., and along with the others in our laughter-induced group, came his big mouth.  This was his opportunity to mock the sawed-off, convertible, primer-gray Chevy Blazer parked mere feet from the entrance/exit to Bandaids, and although the details are lost as to the specifics, mentioned something about \"check out THIS fucking thing!\", which was the perfect timing for one of the busted, ghetto-flab strippers to walk out and proceed to angrily say something like \"Fuck you.  That's mine.  What of it?\"  In response, and generally because he's a giant puss with scary strippers, said something like, \"Oh.  Its nice.  I like it.\" before shitting himself.\n\nI'm sure the rest of the group howling with laughter really set her mind at peace.  \n\nAnyway.  That's the Bandaids story, and you can have one just like it if you give it a chance.", "business_id": "q9B1h5eGBvHjQLF10puUkQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-04-07", "type": "review"}

I was referred to Southwest Women's Care by a friend who was very impressed by the Ahwatukee office location and staff. This being my second pregnancy, I was prepared for the lengthy initial paperwork, long office waits, and moody receptionists; however, I was not at all prepared for complete and utter incompetence. I left my initial visit feeling ok with my OB selection, but in all honesty, I wasn't super impressed with the doctors or staff.  I rationalized the lackluster feelings as pregnancy hormones and made follow up appointments.  If my friend raved so much about them then how bad could they be? I went through my new patient information packet and realized the PA who examined me failed to provide me a due date. Wow! Completely unbelievable! Everyone knows it's one of the most important components of the initial visit. I was able to figure it out using a pregnancy calculator but I couldn't believe the miss. \n\nDuring my visit I also set the expectation I would need FMLA paperwork filled out by 5/29/13--I stressed the importance of the forms and deadlines. The person assisting me said that my deadline wouldn't be an issue and assured me she would personally complete the forms if needed. Well, when I called this morning (5/29/13) to see if the forms were completed the receptionist seemed uninterested in my situation and chose to inform me they had \"7- 10 business days to complete any and all medical forms . . .\" to which I responded \"that is not what I was told at my visit and I need those forms as soon as possible.\" She told me she would check into it and call me back. \n \nThe receptionist did provide a prompt follow up call to let me know that they would be making an exception for my forms. She set the expectation that I would be able to pick them up after the office lunch break and left it at that. I was pleased with the quick response and went to pick up my forms as soon as I could. When I got to the office the front desk could not locate my paperwork and the lengthy wait time left little time for me to double check the forms. Imagine my dismay when I got back to my office to discover the forms were filled out completely incorrect.  There were contradictories, wrong information, and misspellings galore.  There is absolutely no way a medical professional could have completed the documents. When I checked the back signature, sure enough, it was different from the rest of hand writing on the forms.  I am completely appalled that a doctor or physicians assistant would sign off on forms without insuring they were filled out appropriately. \n\nThere is no way I would let someone who can't even take the time to make sure basic documents are completed properly deliver my child.  An expectant mother needs someone who pays attention to details. If this is how they handle the little parts of pregnancy then I don't even want to think about how they handle the bigger parts.

The facility is clean. My annual exams usually went fine and I was in and out in a reasonable amount of time. \n\nI had an abnormal pap smear for my first time this year and had to come back in for a colposcopy and cervical biopsy. After a week of anxiously awaiting my results, I got a voicemail from the RNC I saw telling me \"I have your results, please call me back and tell them to track me down personally so I can speak with you.\" I called back and they told me she'd just gone into an exam room and that they'd have her call me right back in 10 minutes. An hour and a half passed and I was really starting to let the nerves get to me.. so I called back. Her assistant said she just went into another exam room and she'd call me back. So I waited. \n\nFour hours pass and no call. Finally, I call back a third time and was able to speak with Ms. Scrivner, the RNC who performed my colposcopy and left the message. What she told me was \"You have high-grade cervical cell changes so you DEFINITELY need to get in here for a LEEP procedure, I'll transfer you to scheduling\" Click. That was it. Scheduling picks up and had no idea what was going on--they even asked ME if I needed to schedule a consult or the actual procedure--excuse me, but isn't it the provider's job to know these things?\n\nAnyway, I got the consult scheduled. I knew absolutely nothing about my condition, all I had was the information of \"high grade cervical cell changes\" and how urgently I needed LEEP. The next day I left a message for the nurse triage explaining my situation and telling them I need more info about my results and to give me a call back. The nurse called back and was horribly rude and condescending. She snapped at me that \"these are precancerous cells that are going to turn into cancer unless you come in here and get the LEEP.\" Out of despair and worry I asked if there were any other options. She snapped back at me again, saying, \"These are cells that will turn into CANCER. You CANNOT sit around and do nothing and NO there is nothing else that can be done because the infected tissue will spread and infect more until you have full-blown cancer.\" That was the extent of information I got about my test results, and simply trying to get more information about my condition so I don't give myself an ulcer worrying about it. Of course I had the words \"these cells will turn into CANCER\" rolling around in my head for days, which was pretty emotionally crippling to be honest. \n\nI was so distraught with the way the triage nurse had spoken to me and how rude, condescending, and cold she was, I started looking into different OBGYNs. I called Southwest to request my records be released so I could bring them to my new doctor. I requested only the past 2 years of records, and they were able print them and give them to me in about fifteen minutes. I decided I wanted all of my records, so I went back in and they told me it'd be $15 and they'd call me when the records were ready for pick up. Fine, I understand. Nine days pass and no call. I call back and they tell me anything before 2009 is in storage and they'd have to physically get it, which \"takes time\". I sure wish someone would have told me that instead of letting me sit around for nine days wondering what's going on.. So I told her it's fine, just give me anything you have on hand. She agreed she'd print everything from 2010 on and call me within 2 days to pick them up. It's now been two weeks, Southwest has never called about my records. The only call I've received is them telling me I owe them more money, despite already being sent an invoice and paying for the colposcopy/biopsy that was performed. I asked why they didn't include all of the charges on the invoice they sent and they didn't have an answer.\n\nWhen the time came that I did have abnormal results, the staff and especially the triage nurse were exceptionally unhelpful and rude--they couldn't even provide me the most basic information about my condition. I took my two years of records to my new doctor, who is an MD by the way (never once saw an MD at Southwest) and she took one look at the biopsy, sat me down, and explained everything that was going on. I don't know why nobody at Southwest could do this for me. feel much more comfortable and confident in my new OBGYN's care. My new OBGYN informed me that I did have other options, I guess Southwest just didn't want to offer them to me. I'm upset I didn't make the switch earlier. Long story short, I think Southwest is more concerned with money and getting people in and out without actually giving a damn about the patients themselves.

Its a noble effort to bring Mexican staples and unconventionals to the big city in the middle of Arizona, USA, but the product are tinged with americanization; from their weekend menudo, which is wholly rubbish, to the carne which is a grade above what you would get in a true Mexican market (damn FDA).

Everything is ala carte, suprising those hoping to economize using an American style \"combo\".  Despite this, \"La Cocina\" remains popular, especially at lunch time.\n\nSERVICE/SERVICIO: All orders are taken by an attendant standing next to the line for the cashier. Most guests do not wait long before placing the order. Some have reported difficulty communicating with the attendant however, the other employees tend to have command of the English language. Visitors are responsible for retrieving their own orders and seating themselves at long bench-style tables. \n\nPRICES/PRCIOS: Like Mexico itself, the Ranch Market is not the bargain it is made out to be. Prices that may look low for entrees quickly increase when adding in the cost of beverages, churros, and gas. Most respondents however, believe that the mercado occupies an important niche between true fast food and more sophisticated self-serve meals. \n\nSPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS/CONSIDERACIONES ESPECIAL: Some have accused the Phoenix Ranch Market from being too acommodating to non-Latino customers. While this concern cannot be dismissed, it is obviously the case that all of Mexico has fallen to this trend. New hotels now gleam along the shoreline in Puerto Penasco, golf courses spourt in the arid desert outside Cabo San Lucas, all while Costcos can be found in such tourist-heavy states as Veracruz and Guanajuato. The Calderon Government and America's Hispanics will have to confront the tension between assimilation and authenticity one agua fresca at a time.", "business_id": "VXIkI9_EbDbYHeO9IzKjJg", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-05-20", "type": "review"}

It's the closest Market to my house, it's fun and lively, the produce looks great, and the prepared food smells wonderful.\n\nBut I don't love it.  I'm actually somewhat annoyed by this store.\n\nNumerous times I have entered looking for something and haven't been able to find it.  I know you're thinking it's some wierd gringa item I'm looking for, but this last time I was looking for canned tomatoes to make chili.  Canned tomatoes!?!?!  I'll cut them a little slack because I actually sent the husband to do the dirty work and he couldn't find it after asking 2 or 3 employees.  I have a sneaking suspicion that they do actually have it there, because it would be ridiculous for a Mexican market to not have canned tomatoes.\n\nAnother time I took an out-of-town friend.  He was so enamored with the beauty of the bakery items that he wanted to photograph the many cakes and pastries.  But the tub-o-security rolled over and said \"No Photographs!\"  Seriously?  These people work so hard to make such beautiful creations and we can't take pictures?  Of food?  (Ironically, the next day we went to Taliesin West and were encouraged to take photographs of everything except the gift shop.)  And, we left empty handed because the store didn't have 2 of the ingredients we needed.\n\nBottom line:  If I'm incredibly unspecific with the ingredients I am looking for, I can definitely do some grocery shopping here.  But any ideas for meals are usually thwarted and I end up at Safeway.", "business_id": "VXIkI9_EbDbYHeO9IzKjJg", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-05-29", "type": "review"}

On the way out you have a hankering for a Thirstbuster and a Payday.  This is the vibe of Rainbow Donuts.  I get the feeling this place had a reincarnation and they're disguising the catacombs with those unnecessarily GIANT glass displays.  I've never seen them completely filled ... uh, ever ... and it makes their selection of glazed pastry seem paltry.  \n\nI was so disoriented by this whole encounter that i actually ordered an ORANGE CAKE donut.  I'm puking on myself right now remembering it.  What a shite state of affairs when you think that ordering such a conception is a wise decision.  To be honest, their selection WAS pretty sparse, and I was just kinda wanting to bounce because some customer was arguing about a mistake the owner had made by inserting the wrong donut into his half-dozen LAST WEEK and wanted compensation for it THIS WEEK in the form of a free donut.  \n\nMeanwhile, my eyes are molesting my stomach by flickering between donut choices maple or orange.  My brain intervenes with a WTF?  So, i chose the lesser of the evils -- even going against my cake-donut discriminatory practices and made a panicked decision.  \n\nEnd result:  there are MUCH better choices for hangover donuts in the central area and for slightly cheaper.  Also, that 24 hour sign practically had me thrown in the clink one night as i foolishly left the bar drunk and early in search of hot, glazed donuts.  Because Rainbow was in fact closed, a kick in the gut to be sure, I ended up driving around central on this quest for donuts at 3-? am, until i eventually forgot I was even driving or why I was out in the first place.

This was my first ever experience with Salvadoran food and I was definitely not disappointed! The area is a little shady so we made it a day trip and took about half a dozen people. At first I was a little apprehensive, the area sucks and the parking lot was empty but it was a Saturday and probably between the lunch and dinner rush. In fact, by the time we were ready to leave, the place had filled up. The actual restaurant was very minimalist but clean and welcoming on the inside. The only negative I have to report (other than the neighborhood) is the language barrier and lack of service. Don't get me wrong, the server was very sweet and accommodating but there was only one, she didn't understand what we were saying most of the time, and it was hard to flag her down once it started to get busy. Only one of us had any experience with this genre of food, and although he liked Guanaquito, he said he preferred Eliana's but mostly because he said they spoke English and had a slightly better papusa. This was my first so I had nothing to compare it to, but I have to say I was very pleased. We ordered 3 plato tipico which came with papusas (we opted for all bean and cheese after reading the other Yelp reviews), a Salvadorean version of an empenada filled with meat and potatoes, yucca frita, tamales, and some slaw. We all loved it all except half our party passed on the tamales and we all agreed the pickled slaw wasn't the greatest; I would've preferred the slaw to have had more time to develop it's flavors and wilt a bit - it was also very sweet and I like my non-creamy slaws with a little more tang. We also had a side of fried plantains that were accompanied by crema fresca and beans (AWESOME!), their complimentary chips and salsa, and my kids shared the spaghetti with ablondigas. After reading all of the reviews on this place, I had planned on trying their chicken soup but I was so full I had to pass. At the end of the massive lunch we probably dropped about $12 per person, an excellent value for the amount of food we got.

It came with casamiento (beans mixed into rice), a simple salad, fried plantain, and two pupusas. I washed all these down with a cold horchata which had a stronger, more assertive flavor than the horchatas I've had in Mexican restaurants.  It was Easter Sunday when I had this lunch and though this combination was everyday fare, I thought that it was a meal tasty and spectacular enough for the holiday. \n\nA week and a half later, I came here with fellow yelpers for the monthly International Supper Club UYE. This time I decided to try distinctly Salvadoran dishes, so I ordered pupusa with cheese and loroco (flower buds of the loroco vine) and relleno de pacaya (made with the inflorescence of the pacaya palm tree). There was only the slightest hint of loroco flowers in the pupusas - a bit of a disappointment; the pupusas tasted good, but the lack of loroco flavor made it almost indistinguishable from a regular pupusa con queso. The relleno de pacaya turned out to be an acquired taste: it was definitely different, but the bitterness of the palm flower stalks was not something I really fancied. I enjoyed the \"ensalada\" beverage, which was a cold refreshing sweet drink with what seemed to me to be flavors of melon, apple, and citrus. Desert was atol de elote, which was something of a dessert soup with a sweet creamy \"broth\" and sweet corn kernels, with a sprinkling of cinnamon on top. It was pleasant and refreshing.\n\nFive stars from the first visit, three stars for the second visit - that averages out to 4 stars for my experience here.", "business_id": "rbiRLiFTG098z9JaK3Nshw", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-04-16", "type": "review"}

As an appetizer we got a mix plate with two popusas, yucca fritas, and some very similar to an empanada. Those empanada things were full of flavor, very tasty. I would go back just for those empanada things. \n\nThe carne plate was good. Nothing super special, but it had good flavor. The other people also got large glasses of horchata.

I forked a little salsa chile and salsa verde onto the gordita (accompanied by refritos and rico) and dug in.\nI awoke to shouts of \"clear\" as the feverish paramedics worked to restart my heart...just kidding! \nI am fine:) !!\nSo, go to the pawn shop and find yourself a nice little Sig Sauer 9mm pistol and holster, turn on the car alarm and go try Taco's of Juarez.

Perhaps the latter adjective is my own issue, but at 5 foot  9 inches I felt REALLY tall. An adorable little home, with creaky wooden floors transformed into a comfortable cafe with approachable American fare. After navigating the dicey, sandy, lumpy parking lot I accidentally entered the kitchen door. My bad. I was redirected to another door and entered through the rear. Yikes did I  just say I entered through the rear? Anyway a lovely staff person told me to go to the front and check in. Meandering through the cafe I really did find it lovely. Very neat, old yet modern and strangely very loud. It was a booming lunch crowd on a Monday. Taking Mom and Dad out for a Mother's Day lunch. We waited a few minutes for a table and were constantly being said hello to and asked if we've been helped by a friendly, friendly staff. Shout out to the staff! The menu, while not especially inventive, seemed fresh and yummy. The soup of the day was a tortilla soup with its own stamp on it. No tortilla strips atop the cup, yet and especially flavorful soup, creamy with a twinge of tanginess to it. Mom and I both had the turkey sandwich with cranberrry sauce. HUGE mother of a sandwich. I always wonder about the big sandwich because you cannot possible bite into it without making a mess. Not a strike against them, cuz it was very good, bread was fresh and turkey seemed unprocessed. Dad ordered the ham and cheese, but stripped away all the interesting flavors, because, well, because he's a dad and likes the meat and potato type menu. Dessert was a wonderful and decedent brownie with ice cream, chocolate and caramel sauces. Very good. Brownie was more like a cake though. Again, no complaint, cuz it was dee-lish. Service was so great I have to say. Friendly, professional and fun. I like the idea of eating in an old house. The contrast of old Phoenix with striking photography of modern New York strewn about the rooms was quite cool. I recommend a visit. I'm craving the tortilla soup and would love to try other items on the menu. Most importantly it was a wonderful way to hang with mom and dad (who ventured in from Sun City in their mini van, navigating the Central Ave. mess, God Bless 'em) and we truly had a good experience.

The parking lot is a bit odd because its large/loose gravel....but there seemed to be plenty of spaces so that def. a bonus!  The atmosphere was really laid back and really pleasant. Very friendly staff seemed to be everywhere, so that was nice too. \nMy order was a take out order for about 10 people in my office. I thought for sure I'd be taking out 4 bags...but they had very economical/green packaging (paper boxes and paper wrappings) . So it was nice to only see 3 bags (once I got the food...which unfortunately took 40 mins. instead of 20 to prepare). But hey, it was busy and I had almost 10 orders...so no biggy. As far as the food, they didn't have baked beans as they state on their menus, nor did they have steak for their steak tacos. (weird...it wasn't even 12p yet and they were out of food?!) Back at the office, everyone enjoyed the food. It wasn't anything over the top nor was it 'plain'. So compliments to Coronado Cafe for that (usually some places are too froo froo for me downtown).  I had gotten the portobello sandwich w/ potato salad. The sandwich was very yummy. It  had onions, cheese and other ingredients and was on focaccia bread which added just the right amt. of flavor to the sandwich. \n\nAlthough the food is good, I do wish the food wasn't as expensive as it was. (For I know the 1/2 sand. and 1/2 salad combo, that others ordered from the office,  really wasn't that big of a portion). All in all...nice little place with good food.

It was a little too tart for me, but Jeannie enjoyed hers and helped me with mine.\n\nFinished off our shared meal with the special of the day.  It was halibut with a parsnip puree and steamed veggies.

I am actually salivating as I write this on a full stomach.  It's damn the diet kind of food because this is one of life's great pleasures.\n\nThe most important thing about Rito's green chili burro is avoiding a blowout.  A blowout is defined as recklessly biting into the burro and putting too much pressure on the bottom of the tortilla.  This creates a hole in the tortilla and the stew drips all over you.  Not only do you lose out on the greatness of the broth, but you have a mess on your hands.  Avoid a blowout at all costs.\n\nThe best method I have found is to massage the burro from the bottom up so as to get some of the liquid to the top of the tortilla.  Then when you start taking your first few bites, suck in when you bite.  This ensures you get plenty of liquid with each bite and you sufficiently reduce the pressure on the bottom of the tortilla.\n\nIf the unfortunate occurs and you do experience a blowout, the best course of action is to remember the three second rule and quickly lick up all the broth on your hands, fingers, and table.

I've lived in Garfield for 2 years, but I work outside of the neighborhood from 9-5, so I'm never around during Rito's business hours (according to a sign inside, M-F, 9-4).  I rode my bike over on a fine, sunny Friday around 12:30.  I approached from the south, so I could see the patio seating.  If you approach from Roosevelt St., it's easy to miss this place!  There's no signage of any kind, but lots of people parking and waiting outside.\n\nThe atmosphere is absolute hole in the wall.  You order through a window with bars at the counter, which is a practical arrangement for the location.  Garfield is pretty chill these days, but that has not always been the case.  There are chairs along the wall for your waiting pleasure, but not nearly enough and they get snagged quickly.  There's a limited menu, but the day I visited, there were 4 specials written on a chalk board.\n\nI am an enchilada girl, so I was pretty happy when I saw them on the specials board.  I know burritos are what Rito's is known for, but I figured I could come back any day and try a burrito.  I ordered 2 cheese enchiladas and a side of beans.  I waited about 15 minutes for my food.  I put it in my bike basket and pedaled home in anticipation of a great Mexican lunch.\n\nThe enchiladas were generous, but the sauce was not nearly as tasty as the sauce at Carolina's.  And the enchiladas were pretty greasy.  The beans were soupy and delicious.  I will not order the enchiladas again, but I will go back and give the burritos a try.  The sodas are in cans, so I passed on a beverage.\n\nI'm glad I didn't wait until next week to make my Rito's excursion, because a sign inside announced that they'll be closed all week for \"spring break.\"", "business_id": "Xo9Im4LmIhQrzJcO4R3ZbA", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-03-23", "type": "review"}

But the long wait can be difficult to bear and the burritos are approaching $6 a piece. \n\nWith that being said this is some of the best green chile I have had in Phoenix. It is mildly spicy with fresh onions and tomatoes, and lean chunks of tender pork. I certainly appreciate that the meat is not accompanied by layers of fat, which I have experienced at other valley eateries. I must confess. I love me some tasty pig and this slightly-too-thin sauce is just squealing for more. Nearly double would be about right. \n\nRito's also needs to add some combo plates to that barren menu. Give me a green chile plate with rice, beans, and flour tortillas for a bit more than a solo burrito and I will repeatedly frequent your establishment. Currently if you'd like some rice and beans with your burro you're lookin' at $8 plus for your lunch. This is not Scottsdale! Some claim that this place has \"the best\" beans. I disagree. They are a bit too salty and runny. On the other hand the rice is simple and satisfying. Also, while not made in-house and instead purchased from Mama Lola's, the tortillas are still quite good. \n\nIn a nutshell visit Rito's if you appreciate some tasty green chile and have lots of time to spare and patience to endure the long line and longer wait.

Not everything I had was a home run, but a truly legit Mexican take out spot.\n\nI had recently seen the Check Please AZ segment and read the Yelp reviews about this place.  I live downtown but up until now I didn't even know this place existed.  So I decided to stop by at opening on Saturday morning.  The location is exactly what I expected.  A divvy hole in the wall in the middle of residential street in the Garfield District.  The only parking is in the street and the building isn't labeled so be sure to know the address of this place in advance.  I had heard this place was typically busy at lunch during the work week but expected to get in and out pretty fast on a Saturday.  Uh, no.  The line was 12 deep when I arrived which was just 5 minutes after 10am.  The crowd in line was super diverse (white, black, hispanic, and even asian folks) so clearly word has gotten out about this place.  I believe you can call in your order if you wanna run by and pick it up rather than wait in line like I did.\n\nSo after about 10 minutes in line, I got to put in my order.  The dish that seemingly everyone talks about as Rito's 101 is the Green Chile Burrito Enchilada Style with Red or Green Sauce (I went with Red).  A family friend raved about their refried beans so I got some of those in the bowl as well.  Total price was $10 (FYI, they take credit and debit cards now so its no longer cash only).  Took about 20 minutes to get my food.  It's strictly a takeout place, but they do have a tiny amount of seating outside the building.  Being that it was a warm summer day when I went, I decided to just make the 5 minute drive home to eat.\n\nAlright to the food.  Portions are huge.  Burrito comes in a huge bowl and was oozing red sauce with beans on the side (see my photo).  Smelled divine.  I've had a lot of burritos in my time, but this is up there with some of the best I've had.  Great chunks of meat mixed in with Hatch green chiles.  The red sauce and cheese complimented the tortilla very well and the sauce wasn't as watery as I had feared.  Great burrito all around.  The beans on the other hand were a disappointment.  Maybe its just me, but I prefer my refried beans to have a little more chunkiness to them.  Rito's beans are almost more of a puree.  The taste is fine, I just prefer to taste like I'm biting into actual chunks of beans.\n\nAll in all, I was impressed at the size and quality of the food I got for the money.  As busy as it was today, I can't even imagine how busy it gets during the work week.  Next time I come here I'll try to call ahead and maybe give the chimichangas a whirl.  Would certainly recommend this spot if you're in the neighborhood.

I'm not much of a pork fan, (excluding bacon of course) which is usually what is in the burritos, so I usually just order a bean and cheese burrito enchilada style with green sauce. Green is the only way to go in my opinion. The burritos are huge, and are filled with so much beans, cheese, and green enchilada sauce, it's overflowing as soon as you take the first bite. It's always hot because they make each order fresh, but be prepared to wait especially if you go between 11-1. I try to only go after 1, but it's not uncommon to wait 20 minutes even going after the lunch rush. So if you have only an hour lunch, and you work downtown, you better be a speedy driver. I usually only have about ten minutes to eat after driving over and waiting in line, so that's definitely something to take into consideration.\n\nIt's a little hard to find at first because there isn't a sign, and the business operates out of an old house across from a school, but you'll know you're in the right place when you see the line up of cars for a block. The staff is all very friendly, but there isn't a lot of waiting room inside, and there really isn't too much space outside to eat either, so it's more of a grab and go kind of restaurant, which I don't mind because I probably would not choose to stay and eat there either, but you're going there for the food not the experience.\n\nThe only other downside aside from the wait, and the lack of seating and cleanness, are that the green burritos are twice as much as the red ones because they are so popular. I personally think that this is ridiculous, but obviously everyone is still willing to pay for it. All in all it's a great little hole in the wall in downtown Phoenix, and a must try if you are craving some delicious green chile.", "business_id": "Xo9Im4LmIhQrzJcO4R3ZbA", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-05-25", "type": "review"}

As I was rolling on 16th, I saw the sign...now if you blink you miss it.   I usually look for the big purple Dulceria across the street first and slow down as I near.  It is located in a strip of buildings that have seen better days, pero yo no tengo miedo.  I have stopped in 3 times to date.  On my first visit I picked up un grande Agua de Pina (Pineapple \"water\") and a few Paletas, fresh fruit/fruit juice popsicles (coco, pina, sandia y limon).  While the selection and the quality is not as extensive as one of my favorite places in Albuquerque (on Central just south of Coors) .  I have to say it is close.  At least my Agua de Pina was fresh and not the hyper yellow processed stuff I get sometimes at Pro's Ranch Market.  On this visit there was also a lady inside selling fresh hot homemade tamales for $5 a half dozen.  *Score*!\n\nOn my second visit I went in for another batch of paletas, and this time I also left with 2 Aguas Medianas de Limon y otro de Pina.  MmMMM....I liked how the Limon was still quite tart and just sweet enough.  The Pina I put in the fridge for later.  I also decided to try a Raspado de Mango (Mango snow cone) to which I allowed the addition of a little Leche Condesada/Azucarada (Sweetened condensed milk).  Not as much mango flavor as I was expecting but refreshing and tasty with nice little pieces of fresh mango.  \nI need to go back to try the nieves/helados (ice cream), and  Escamochas (mixed fruit served with coconut and drizzled with sweet condensed milk or sometimes honey and sprinkled with granola or pecans, usually fixed up to taste) or the Pico de Gallo (in this case it is a plate/cup with a combo of any of the following like cucumber , watermelon, canalope, honeydew, pineapple, coconut chunks, mango, jicama sprinked with red chile and served with lime wedges).

The day after, they took care of it but the manager made it sound like it was his fault and she was doing him a favor by taking it off of his bill. \n\nThe bathroom looked very worn, the shower and sink leaked.

When it arrived there were 6 large bacon wrapped shrimp on a small bed of french fries, accompanied by refried beans and rice. The rice and beans were very good, the filling in the bacon wrapped shrimp was very basic unseasoned Ricotta/Requeson, not like the jalapeno, garlic, with monterey jack cheese I have had at other places. It was admittedly bland. I added lime but decided against any of the bottled hot sauces on the table. I should have spooned over some of the salsa but hind sight 20/20.

Particularly South Phoenix where you can find great Soul Food at Lolo's Chicken and Waffles, Pizza at Amano, and of course various different types and regions of Mexican food. When I say Mexican food I'm really referring to the sort of hole in the wall, real deal family owned operations that are all over the south side of Phoenix. So many of them dot each street corner and call like the Sirens of the night. Marisco's Playa Hermosa is exactly what I mean by this.\n\n\"We bring the sea to the desert\" is their slogan and it's so true. Stepping inside you'll feel like you were just transported to Mazatl\u00e1n, Mexico, the only things missing here is the ocean. The place is just splashed with bright colors with hand carved tables and birds with a welcoming and friendly staff. With so much to take in it's hard to focus on any one thing, though with so many bird carvings hanging from the ceiling I almost felt like I was in the Tiki Room at Disneyland, less the chatter of the birds of course. \n\nChips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant can be a very good benchmark to judge the rest of your meal, Marisco's would have to be at the top of these tests. Their chips are slightly thick, warm and a little on the oily side, this way the salt can adhere well to them. Accompanying are 2 different salsa, red and green. The red has a certain sweet and hot bitterness that is tasty and even better when washed down with a cold beer. The green is made of creamy avocado and with a warm chip is absolutely delicious. Neither were very hot but that's the thing with real deal Mexican food, its not always hot and spicy. So you'll have no reason to expect the \"burning ring of fire\" the next day! \n\nWith so many different and tasty sounding items to choose from, deciding was pretty tough as I really enjoy some good seafood. So imagine this, 8 large perfectly cooked shrimp, swimming in a creamy tomatillo and cilantro sauce, then topped with a sprinkling of cheese. If this sounds like something you would enjoy then go ahead and order the Camarones Culichi ($13.99). You will also get a basket of hot fresh corn or flour tortillas for dunking as well as rice, beans and a fresh lettuce salad dressed with lime juice. The beans have a nice texture with good flavor but the rice is nice! Well steamed and seasoned, the rice has a bright white color which might look bland, but after one bite you'll be wrapping it up in a hot tortilla and dunking it into the beans. \n\nThe Mojarra Frita ($15), a fried whole fried fish, sounds and looks good, but decided to be more like a daddy's little girl and order something less involved. Crab Enchilada's ($13) are not only the house specialty but are good to the last bite. 3 corn tortillas over stuffed with sweet crab meat, rolled together with cheese and covered in a slightly spicy red sauce. Again with the rice, beans and salad this is a pretty large plate and for the money, a great value. The enchiladas were actually featured in Gourmet Magazine at one time, who knew?\n\nOn the back of the menu you'll find a section called Camida Mexicana which are plates of regular Mexican fare such as burritos, taco's and fajitas. Not trying the Carne Asada Taco's ($6.99) would be a real shame since the meat is so tender and the flavor so beefy. A plate full of 3 tacos, double tortilla, chopped beef and onions, with rice and beans is both satisfying and ample. Douse the tacos with some of the guacamole salsa and you'll have a party on your plate! The Quesadilla ($7.99) is just cheese and a tortilla, while good it was quite ordinary. However the smell from the Fajitas De Pollo ($10.99) was amazing! I'll have those to myself next time!\n\nFor dessert you can stick with maybe a Mexican Coke ($2) made with real sugar or a large glass of over ice Horchata ($2.50). Though for something more, the Flan ($4) was different than what you normally get. More cake like and dense than silky smooth, it was decent enough and a nice finish to so many savory dishes. Otherwise there aren't any other desserts offers, like you'll have room after such good sized portions anyway. \n\nMarisco's Playa Hermosa is a real gem and has the menu, friendliness and comfortable vibe to back it up. While the neighborhood feels a bit on the seedy side, as they say, nothing ventured, nothing gained?", "business_id": "Cp6JGY5YIRncTV_My9nf9g", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-03-20", "type": "review"}

This is literally the gold standard.\n\nNot to say there isn't amazing ceviche in other places, or even great ceviches at trendier spots.

When it's 115 outside, getting a lovely, air conditioned place to sit, drink a beer, eat great food....and leave for under $20 for two people makes this a true find.\n\nLast note: the place is freaking ADORABLE, the service is amazing, and if you go more than twice, they will start to remember you.

I was a liitle doubtful but with my first bit I was in love. Sooooo good and so flavorful without the guilt that comes with eating fried food.

Just order a Dos Equis and the Molcajete Caliente with verde sauce. \n\nMy boyfriend and I found this place on the Yelp app, like most eateries we visited while in Phoenix. I cannot express how happy this place made us. We loved the restaurant, the service and the food so much that we actually came back and ate there again before heading to the airport.\n\nThe Molcajete Caliente is $22 for two people. You each get your own ceviche tostada and plate of rice, beans and salad (all delicious). They also bring a warmer with corn or flour tortillas. But the main event... a volcanic-like cast iron cauldron (a molcajete) teeming with bubbling green sauce with various kinds of grilled meats and seafood hanging around the outside. The smell alone will bring you halfway to heaven, but ZOMG, taste explosion! SO GOOD. \n\nIt comes with two breaded fish filets, two pieces of grilled steak, two of chicken and four big shrimp. Plus, there are little chunks of octopus in the sauce itself. If I had to choose a favorite, it would be the fish (or the seafood in general), but every bite of everything was honestly amazing. It may be the best sauce I've ever eaten. \n\nThe service was superb both visits---super friendly, fast and helpful. The server was the one who recommended the molcajete in the first place, actually.

Some reviewers have commented about the dodgy location. The neighborhood seemed fine to me, though I don't live in Phoenix so I could be mistaken.

Note - I did not come for rice and beans ;-).\n\nOnce my wife ordered the Camarones Culichi Shrimps In A Green Sauce, Tomatill & Cilantro, which was excellent.  The waitress recommended it and she was right.  The sauce seems to have some cheese mixed/melted in that made it sinfully savory.\n\nAnother time I ordered tacos al pastor.  OK, I know it is a seafood shop but after the nice ceviche I was ready for some flesh.  The tacos were very good. I liked how their al pastor was crispier than some.  Maybe a personal preference, but they were good.\n\nKey note for me - they offer a variety of margaritas.  I prefer the upcharged one where they mix it themselve, not the premix bottled one. (they sell both)  for me it is less sweet and has a cleaner appeal.  \n\nI am planning on going back again next week when more family come to visit.\n\nLast note:  The neighborhood is not the greatest.

You have been missing out.  My husband and I were in PHX for a short vacay and after standing in the Hertz rental car line for 40 freaking minutes, I told him we are not going to Chino Bandido but the closest Mexican restaurant we can find on Yelp with the highest ratings.  Lo' and behold, it was Mariscos Playa Hermosa!  Literally 2 miles from the airport and easy to find.  \n\nWe are so glad that we were able to find the best Mexican food we've ever had while in PHX, but it was hard having this as our first meal of the trip.  Every meal after this was just not cutting it.  Therefore, we planned the last day of our trip around the fact that Mariscos Playa Hermosa closed at 8pm on Sundays. \n\nYou really can't go wrong with the menu.  The first time, I ordered Fish Enchiladas and my husband ordered the Garlic Fish platter.  Both were amazing.  Their complimentary ceviche tostada was also delicious, as well as their salsas.   The 2nd time we went, I ordered the Camarones Culichi and my husband ordered another fish dish w/ vegetables.  Both were amazing again.  However, if you go here I would highly recommend the Camarones Culichi.....just because it's not something you find  at any mexican restaurant.  It was so delicious that I licked the plate of sauce clean after eating all of the shrimp, and I don't care how uncouth that might have looked because you will probably end up doing the same.  (Now, if you cannot handle spicy foods, you may want to be very cautious.  Maybe order an Horchata drink to go with the meal, or a side of sour cream to buffer the spiciness.)

I've been desiring amazing Mexican restaurants in Arizona.  Since I moved here, I've been to several places that were underwhelming, at best, and generally just not good to me.  So, I'd given up on Mexican Food in AZ and I just didn't eat any.  Well, a conversation in Yelp Talk about Mexican Food inspired me to check out some different places and this one turned up in my searches on Yelp and other websites.\n\nI'm happy to say that I was so thrilled and enjoyed my meal very much at Mariscos Playa Hermosa.  Again, another hole-in-the-wall, but still quite the find.  Mariscos is located in a pretty seedy part of town, so don't get nervous going there.  They close early, so you'd better arrive early.  You will find that there is a full bar inside this colorfully decorated resto.  Don't eat at the bar.  That things not suitable for anything except decoration as the bar itself doesn't extend out far enough to make it comfortable to sit there.  (this is a tip from a person who opted to sit at the bar)\n\nI tasted a few items off the menu.  The shrimp in diablo sauce was my favorite.  I ordered extra diablo sauce on the side.   The sauce has a smokey taste with the heat of the peppers.  Perfect for my heat seeking taste buds.  They prepare the sauce \"fresh to order\".So there is a charge for $3 for the extra sauce on the side to go.  I used that sauce to make more shrimp diablo at home later that week.  \n\nI also enjoyed the camarones culichi... shrimp in green sauce.  Culichi is a tomatillio sauce made with some dairy product and cilantro and of course the poblano or tomatillio peppers.  The sauce is simply to die for.  I left there satisfied and happy!  \n\nI will return and take a friend for the Molcajete Caliente with verde sauce.  Can't wait.  I'm sure it will please.\n\nThey have a check-in offer too, so be sure to check-in.\n\nOh, that parking lot is TINY.

The outside pretty much looks like a crummy box but the inside is super colorful and lavishly decorated. I wasn't sure what to expect but the food sufficiently impressed me.\n\nYou get two salsas with a basket of chips--both of which are super delicious. The avocado salsa was tasty and not super watered-down like at some places. The red one, which is semi-spicy, is very tasty. I don't even know how to describe it. It was just so.... TASTY.\n\nWe received some salmon (I think?) ceviche on a crispy tortilla with our meals. Very yummy and the veggies in it tasted fresh. I ordered the enchiladas de jaiba and the others ordered fish tacos. Both were good although I think I liked the fish tacos better than my enchiladas. I thought the fish was really good and light. I noticed the rice seemed to be made with those frozen mixed veggies you get at the supermarket, which I thought was kind of funny, but it still tasted good so I guess it didn't matter.\n\nService was very prompt even though the server wasn't particularly engaging. I actually prefer my service to be this way, so if you prefer a waiter/waitress that likes to make conversation, then maybe this isn't the place for you.

The more questionable the neighborhood, the better.  That's by no means an exact science (nor meant to be demeaning to the neighborhoods for which many of these establishments undoubtedly take great pride).  But with apologies to the numerous suburban Mexican food establishments that dot the valley landscape, the working class Hispanic neighborhoods of inner city Phoenix are where I've always found the best Mexican grub.  When I told my Dad I wanted to try this place and where it was, he hesitated a bit thinking we were driving into a death trap.  Fortunately my food adventurist side convinced him to make the trip with me to try this place for the first time.  And oh, what a place.\n\nI first found out about Maria Maldonado's creation on a segment of the wildly popular PBS show Check Please Arizona (you can watch it on YouTube right now).  From the onset, you could tell this wasn't your typical Mexican establishment.  While they have all the usual Mexican staples you'd expect (burritos, tacos, fajitas, etc.), the emphasis here is decidedly on seafood.  But even the meat dishes here are completely unique to the valley (more on that in a bit).  Thanks to the Check Please segment and the fabulous Yelp reviews, we came in the door on a Sunday afternoon.  As I expected (though to the shock of my Dad), the place is a rainbow of colors from the furniture, to the walls, to the numerous photos and keepsakes on the wall.  And yet its small enough that it feels like you've walked into someone's dining room.\n\nWe got here just before the dinner rush so we got sat immediately.  My Dad and I first got a couple of Dos Equis Lagers to start.  I mention this because the beers that came out were HUGE.  The beers came in cold gigantic beer mugs to where there was at least 2 bottles worth of beer in each mug.  Did not see that coming, but a GREAT start to the evening.  Next, we (unexpectedly) each got a complementary appetizer of ceviche on a tostada.  Basically a variety of different fishes (I think I picked up octopus, shrimp and tuna) mixed with guacamole and other veggies with a hint of lime juice.  Very refreshing dish.  Then they brought out the chips and salsas (one of which was a green salsa that had a big kick to it).  All of this food and drink before we even ordered our own dishes?  Wow.\n\nMy Dad got the grilled shrimp skewers that were seasoned and wrapped in bacon and cheese.  I went with the dish this place is most famous for.  A giant molten bowl of green tomatillo sauce and cheese with shrimp, fish, chicken, and beef lining the rim of the bowl (see my photo).  This my friends is the Molcajete Caliente (even the name sounds intimidating doesn't it?).  Both of our dishes came with a side of beans and rice (though even the rice was different as it was more of a rice pilaf).  While the tomatillo and cheese is bubbling hot (and pretty much stays that way), its actually not spicy at all.  But it coated every piece of meat on the bowl beautifully.  The meats were all grilled and seasoned perfectly and with a coat of that tomatillo and cheese I was in heaven.  My Dad absolutely destroyed his bacon and cheese shrimps he loved them so much.  I was going to use the Yelp check in for the free tres leches cake (which they do honor), but we were both so stuffed full of food and beer we couldn't eat another bite.  Between the great food, festive atmosphere, friendly waitress and stuffed stomaches, our first venture here was a highly successful one.\n\nTotal tab for the 2 huge beers, chips and salsa, complimentary ceviche tostadas, main dishes, sides, tax and tip was $75.  The Molcajete is $30 by itself so that's what pushed the price a little higher (they also have a bowl for larger groups that runs around $40).  But trust me, this is $30 worth spending.  It can easily feed two or more people (though I stupidity tried to take it down myself).  I'll happily enjoy the rest for lunch tomorrow.  \n\nSo like I said, if you're craving good Mexican food, look towards the inner city area.  Even though i was pretty excited about this place, even I was surprised how generous the portions were and by all the freebees.  Its no wonder the place was packed the whole time we were there and why it seemed like every customer was smiling.  The Maldonados originally created this oasis in the desert to help pay for their kids' college education and achieve the American dream for their entire family.  If their cuisine, staff and happy customers are any indication, I'd say the hard work has paid off, many many times over.", "business_id": "Cp6JGY5YIRncTV_My9nf9g", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-03-15", "type": "review"}

The chips were very oily and I wasn't a big fan, but that initial impression was soon overcome with the best tasting ceviche on top of a crispy corn tortilla. My mom, who isn't a fan of cilantro, said that it was the highlight of her meal. \n\nMy dad and I decided to share the House Special/ Molcajete ($30 for two people), which consisted of shrimps, two tilapila pieces, two chicken slices, and two beef slices in green sauce. It came with corn tortillas, rice, beans, and salad. None of my family members can eat spicy foods, but there is also an option for the \"Diablo\" sauce, which I heard is pretty spicy. We were definitely not let down - it was just the right taste and the right temperature. My mom got the garlic shrimp (I think it was $13?) and the portion for the main piece was relatively small-medium in size, but it also came with rice, beans, and salad. She liked the clean taste.\n\nThe service was great; our waitress constantly checked in to see if we needed anything. The noise level was loud because there were constantly people coming in and out of the restaurant, but that signifies just how many people are fans of this restaurant. Also, for anyone who's curious, there are TVs (might be good for game-days).\n\nAt the end of our meal, we got a free coconut cake by checking in to Yelp, and the cream on the cake was delicious; the icing tasted like a sweeter version of coconut ice cream. When we were finished, we were way too stuffed.

The decor, made up of hand-carved and hand-painted Mexican-style wooden furniture, is exquisite and really brightens up the dining area.\n\nOverall it's a wonderful dining experience and well recommended.", "business_id": "Cp6JGY5YIRncTV_My9nf9g", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-04-14", "type": "review"}

After landing in Phoenix and having a craving for Mexican food, we drove to Mariscos Playa Hermosa. The restaurant was packed, but we had no problem getting a table. There was also a mariachi band that was playing music from 7-8pm, which was a pleasant surprise. I got an horchata to start off, which was amazing! Not too sweet, which a nice, but not overpowering kick of cinnamon. Highly recommend if you're a fan of horchata.\n\nWe ordered the Ceviche de Pescado as an appetizer, which was delicious and had a nice flavor from the fresh fish mixing with the cilantro and salsa. The fish was a little rubbery, but all the flavors still melded together well.\n\nFor our main courses, we ordered the Camarones culichi and Pescado a la veracruzana. Both came with a side of salad, homemade beans, rice, and fresh corn or flour tortillas. The shrimp was absolutely delicious, and the green sauce had a nice cilantro flavor to it. The only complaint we had was that the portion size was a little small for 3 people, and it was so good that we really wanted more. The fish was lightly breaded and sauteed, and was moist and succulent. The vegetables complemented the dish well too. \n\nIf you're in Phoenix and have a craving for Mexican seafood, I highly recommend Mariscos Playa Hermosa!", "business_id": "Cp6JGY5YIRncTV_My9nf9g", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-04-19", "type": "review"}

Although they were not super busy they were running around like chickens with their heads cut off... BTW... Today's special.... Chicken! ... NOT! \n\nIn reading previous reviews... The biggest complaint is the service... Or lack of it!  Boy oh boy... They were not kidding!  Why o why do they not have ample employees?  Or at least experienced ones? \n\nHEY OWNER... Do yourself a favor... HIRE SOME EMPLOYEES!!\n\nMoving right along... The place is small so you can imagine it would be loud... Which it was... but that's ok.. Made it feel more festive!\n\nIt took forever to just get water and for 10 people they gave only 2 bowls of chips and tiny saucers of hot sauce... Water glasses and drink refills RARELY happened!\n\nWe tried many item between all of us.\n\nThe larger whole fish was moist and delicious! This was the best part of the evening!\n\nThey served their complimentary ceviche which was enjoyable and might I add... A nice touch!\n\nThe shrimp and fish in garlic sauce... Let's talk about that for a sec....\n\nOk, just the other day I cooked some shrimp on the Barbie bathed in butter/garlic. Mine was equally as good if not better because my shrimps were larger.\n\nThey use a medium shrimp that's tasty but nothing the average Joe can't make themselves... The fish part of the dish was a saturated fried piece... \n\nDidn't try the rice simply because it looked unappetizing and did not care for the beans... I related them to baked beans... Like in hot dogs and beans... That's the initial taste.\n\nWe also tried the crab enchiladas ... Again not impressed... It was filled with crab meat but did not care for the taste ... Nor did anyone at the table.\n\nThe tortillas were tortillas nothing special.\n\nBack to the service...I don't want to hear excuses like \" it was very busy\" because according you all those 5 star reviews( which I just don't get) you should expect it to be super busy on a Saturday night!\n\nOne end of the table was almost finished by the time the other end got their food... The servers had absolutely no idea who had what so she pretty much passed the plates and we figured it out ourselves!  \n\nI had to ask for all the dirty dishes to be taken away as nobody came to take them.\n\nOn to dessert...they knew we were there for a Birthday and we had to remind them several times.  For the birthday girl they give a piece of cake and she chose \" tres leche cake\" the cake was unlike any Tres Leche I have had.. Had a raspberry? Filling and did not taste very leche... I am no expert at this but the ones I have tried sit in the leche which absorbs into the cake making it somewhat soggy and delicious... This was different ...  I am sure there are many different kinds but it was not a hit at the table...\n\nSo, they have this other deal... Where they bribe you to YELP a reviews using names of servers and when they confirm it was posted they give you a piece of coconut cake...so one of the kids at the table did it...\n\nI must say...the coconut cake was delish! Very moist and lots of coconut!\n\nGetting the check was another challenge and when we did get it they charged for 3 items of which we only had 2....\n\nReally makes me wonder... Between the REVIEW BRIBES and the mistakes on the check.... How much money they make this way?\n\nSince we live nowhere close the chances of any of us returning are slim ...\n\nOn goes my quest to find some great Mexican food!\n\nI imagine when a restaurant knows they are going to be on TV they make sure everything tastes great and service is great...\n\nBut on any other day you see how it really is... Don't believe everything you see on TV\n\nIt is a cute place and the fish was good... Give it a try... See what you think!\n\nNever base a decision on one persons review... Food is a preference and I am very tough critic!  \n\nBon Appetite'", "business_id": "Cp6JGY5YIRncTV_My9nf9g", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-05-24", "type": "review"}

My brother wrote in my blog that this was where Chihuly pieces belonged, not indoors, in museums.  I respectfully disagrees, I love to see Chihuly pieces anywhere.  Surroundings do interact with his art, but wherever I see his work, it changes and grows.

I would rank it right up with the Monterey Bay Aquarium in California as an absolute \"must-not-miss\" regional attraction.\n\nWe visited the Garden recently on our \"day off\" between Spring Training games. I had thought it would be worth spending, maybe, an hour or two on, and was actually worried that I hadn't planned anything else to do that day. As it was, we stayed nearly four hours, and are already planning our visit for \"next time.\"\n\nThe Garden is huge, and is organized along various themed \"loop\" trails. We took the \"Desert Discovery\" loop first, which took us past plants (cacti, succulents, and trees) native to the various deserts of the world. Well-informed and friendly docents staffed stations along the trail, answering questions and demonstrating such things as how the interior of a cactus absorbs water or how the native peoples have used desert plants for everything from construction to medicine. That led to the second trail we chose to explore: \"Plants and People of the Sonoran Desert,\" which explores the ways in which the native and Hispanic peoples who have called this area home throughout the centuries have used the various plants and habitats for everything from food and medicine to shelter, worship, and artwork. After a brief break for lunch, we took a turn on the \"Sonoran Desert Nature Loop Trail,\" which showcases the plants and animals of the Sonoran Desert. We also paid a visit to the succulent and cactus galleries.\n\nThe whole place is fascinating, and extremely well-done. We'd have stayed longer if we'd had the energy!\n\nWe also saw an amazing array of birds (the quail and the cactus wrens were my favorites). Books posted throughout the exhibits encouraged visitors to record their wildlife sightings, and we were very happy to record that we'd spotted a jackrabbit!\n\nTours of the Garden are available as part of your admission...we didn't avail ourselves of one this visit, but they sounded interesting.\n\nIf you visit, be sure to wear a good sunscreen and a hat, and to carry water with you (you'd be amazed at how quickly you can dehydrate in a desert climate!).\n\nThe park has two dining options: A casual cafe and a sit-down restaurant. We chose to eat at the cafe, which features salads and wraps (I had a very satisfying hummus and tabbouli plate). It was interesting to see quail begging for tidbits, as sparrows, starlings, and pigeons do in other habitats (it was also hilarious watching the very territorial ground squirrels chasing the quail!)\n\nThe Garden is also enhanced by original artwork, including Philip Haas's intriguing \"Four Seasons.\"\n\nAnother thing to remember if you visit: allow plenty of time for the very nice gift shop! We managed to pick up unique and affordable gifts for family back home, as well as a couple of souvenirs for ourselves, without spending a lot of money.\n\nWe're very glad we chose to spend our free day here, and we will definitely return, should we be fortunate enough to visit the Phoenix area again", "business_id": "qMkIbQFrROSnPaQ7at85-w", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-03-03", "type": "review"}

It's a great place to come and learn about, and view, Desert plants as they thrive in a natural environment/setting. The place is huge -at around 140-acres- and can get extremely busy during certain times of the year, or for special events. The park itself is really beautiful, well organized and is a great place to bring the old and the young. I was fortunate enough to get to view two special exhibitions during my visit: \"Chihuly in the Garden\" and the Spring Butterfly Exhibit. \n\nChihuly in the Garden- Dale Chihuly is a world-renowned glass artist that produces the most visually wonderful pieces of glass art you can imagine. They're showcased throughout the DSB and you will come across them sporadically as you mosey along. They're also marked out on the map provided by the DSB, but I preferred to just come across them randomly; I felt it was more fun that way. I have seen Mr. Chihuly's work before at San Francisco's De Young Museum, but it was a great pleasure seeing his work again. According to my sister they're quite a sight to see when they're all lite up at night. \n\nSpring Butterfly Exhibit- You get to walk through a netted off area where there are hundreds of fluttering butterflies floating around you. You can watch them feed, fly and just rest--and if you hold still enough they just might grace you with their presence by landing on you. Just be sure to treat them gingerly and don't try and pick them up. This area was great fun, especially for my 3-year-old.\n\nThere's still time to go see both of these exhibitions as the Butterflies run until May 11th, 2014 and the Chihuly Exhibit runs until May 18th, 2014. I highly recommend seeing both if you can, but if not the DSB is still a pretty great place to come and see if you're in Phoenix and looking for something cool to do.", "business_id": "qMkIbQFrROSnPaQ7at85-w", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-04-01", "type": "review"}

I gave him my Smartphone and he used the various feature settings on my camera to take his own creative photos of the glass sculptures.  \n\nWe had a great time and I only regret not being able to stay longer.

If you are not from the area be aware of the Arizona sun, it is a real threat. \n\nVisiting 5/3/15 Was a great time to visit. The wildflowers are still blooming, the cactus were blooming and the saguaros this year (super early) were starting to bloom. \n\nA lot of people had the same idea, to visit the garden because of the unexpected cool weather, it was busy. There are a few areas of the garden where you will definitely notice the crowd on a busy day, and we were never alone. Still, it was an enjoyable half-a-day. \n\nI asked a volunteer how long it typically took people to see the garden. When she answered two hours, I knew I had to double the time. In fact, it took me just over four hours to see \"everything.\" Pick up a free map. It is a nice guide to the gardens. \n\nIt is a lot of walking. There are options to cut out some areas of the garden, if you would like a quicker tour. Some of the paths are paved and some are not. There are even a few wifi spots if you just can leave your technology alone. \n\nMost of the plants are dessert plants, which is to be expected. I love dessert plants. They are so different, strange, and unique to their environment. There was also a nice herb garden.\n\nI was impressed by the volunteers they were helpful and informative. There were also some Master Gardeners answering questions. The Master Gardner program is an impressive program. It was nice to see them set up at the Desert Botanical Garden.\n\nThe butterfly exhibit is small, but offers many types of butterflies close up and easy to photograph. I even saw two luna moths, beautiful. There is an extra $3.50 charge for non-members to see the butterflies. I thought the price was reasonable and worth it. I liked the natural light and air in the butterfly house, it really made it nice. \n\nThe butterfly exhibit was the only area it cost extra to visit. There is also a pond area with water plants and with big noisy frogs. The pond was fun to see. \n\nIt is nice, and important, to stop for a break. I had a sandwich at the Terrace Cafe it was large and good. The food at the cafe is assembled in advance, grab-and-go, so if you are the type of person that likes to leave stuff off you might want to pack your own lunch. You can also get a cup of coffee or tea at the cafe which is nice. \n\nThere is some art in the garden and it is nice, but I would love to see even more garden art added in the future.\n\nOverall this is a very nice garden. Go see it if you are in the Phoenix area and if the weather isn't too hot. Wear sunscreen and a hat. Drink water. There are many water fountains throughout the park but bring a water bottle. This is a nice place to see desert plants. It is a beautifully maintained garden. When I visited there were many plants blooming, including some very unique ones.

I just hated that there were no tables in front of the stage, you just had to stand and crowd around which sucked because there is enough room for 10 people to stand right in front, then the rest have to \"bob and weave\" to see anything. The stage was too small, the bass player was standing in front of the stage since there wasn't anymore room.

I won't go into too much detail, but I will say that it was good.  Not amazing, but good.  However, I have never had El Salvadorian food before, so maybe I needed to be broken in.\n\nI started with the mango iced tea which tasted a little like dirt, not horrible, but had a dirt flavor to it if that makes any sense.  I saw the guys next to me get these bright neon yellow drinks with chunks floating in them and decided I must try it.  It turned out it was the ensalada drink, which I thought meant \"salad\" but maybe that's my American translation.  Apparently it means \"delicious fruit salad\" drink.  I ate the chunks out of it, trying to figure out what each one was.  I was thinking it was something exotic, so I made Bri try it, turns out it was apple.  Oops.  So it has apple, pineapple and carrot chunks, maybe not exotic, but still delicious.\n\nThe little shooter of soup is good.  Its like a chicken noodle without the noodle with potatoes thrown in for good measure.  I got the appetizer combo that Michelle got, it was plenty of food for a meal.  I don't know what was what, but I like the flat tortilla looking thing with the cheese the best...it was either a pupusa or a posteles, but it was good!  The tamale was different than the typical, it was not wrapped in a corn husk but what looked like a palm frond, but I could be wrong.  Heck, I couldn't even identify an apple that day!  It also had shredded chicken, potatoes and carrots in it.  Very tasty.  They also serve this soupy tomatoey salsa that is very mild.  That, combined with the slaw they serve as a garnish really adds some taste to most of the items.  They also give you 1 \"tortilla\" per person.  Its their version of a tortilla, but much different than the Mexican version.  This is much smaller, and thicker, almost like a pita, gordita or fry bread.  My friend got some sort of chicken dish with a large amount of what looked like sour cream underneath it.  Unfortunately for him, he hates sour cream, but some rearranging of the plate and some dousing in tomatoey salsa and he was good to go.\n\nI tried to order the \"quesadilla\" dessert thing that Michelle  mentioned because I truly wanted to know what the bastard child of cheesecake and cake would taste like, plus the name was intriguing...but they were out.  They were also out of their carne asada, which looked good.  Other people had some. \n\nIt was busy when we were there, but the service was good and everyone was really friendly.  There was even a very large table of about 15 people in there celebrating a birthday and everyone (OK, well me and my friend and the servers) sang to them.  \n\nI think I want to go back now and try the chile relleno and some more of the \"tortilla\" wrapped cheesy meaty deliciousness.\n\nUPDATE - \nI wonder if that's a record for an update (10 minutes)!\nI just noticed in the beginning I said I won't go into too much detail, then proceeded to go into perfect detail.  I guess its impossible for me not to be long-winded.

Being that I have never seen a Sonic, I was perplexed by these commercials.  So, using the power of the internets I discovered that there weren't any Sonics in the state of Maryland.\n\nWhen I moved to my new home of San Diego, I was confronted by the Sonic commercials yet again.  I internet-searched again and found the nearest Sonic was about 2 hours away.  My perplexion flexed into downright dismay.  Commercials are expensive endeavors--so why would a company essentially throw their money away by advertising whereever they are not located?\n\nOne night, my friend Jen picked me up at the Phoenix Airport for a nice hangout weekend.  We were both really hungry and deciding where to nosh.  When out of the corner of my right eye i spy a garish forty-one hundred kelvin fluorescent beacon in the night.  I thought it was some sort of carwash or super-sized gasstation at first glance.  Jen explained that was a Sonic.  \"What the fvck's a Sonic?\" I replied.  To this point I have never seen a Soinic before in the flesh or in the disgusting eyesore of a prefab materials and light, as it were.  So it was decided right then and there that we would eat this Sonic.\n\nNow, I know I cannot speak for all the distant Sonics in parts of the world a young hooligan such as myself has never been to, but to this, my virgin Sonicage, I can.\n\nThere is a huge slab of concrete which seemed way too large for the size of the building.  On this slab was lots of parking spots under a handfull of overhangs shining enough fluorescent light to make a operating room mildly jealous. Beside each of the parking spots was a lit-up menu with fast-food type stuffs, drinks, slushies, smoothies, ice cream sundaes, banana splits, etc.  As if this wasn't enough, they also have a drive-thru.

It is a monument to decadence to the point of bloatation and bloatiosity.\n\nWhile we were deciding what we wanted a Mexican family rolled up beside us with a roller-skated jalopy and young children in the back.  They ordered and pulled away blasting some thuggish gangsta rap as their trunk buzzed with whorish flapping sheetmetal not sealed or sealed or sealed.\n\nJen ordered blackberry iced tea and some fried mac n' cheese bites, I, the tater-tots with cheese and a cranberry limeade. We pulled away blasting while our thuggish gangsta rap as our trunk rattled and flapped whoreishly--waves dissipating into the must of chaparral, waves lifting into the witheringchaped desert night.\n\nGot home and ate in normal lighting--Lighting that didn't make one's flesh crawl rutty-riddled with hungover insomniacian interrogation prior to a privilege afforded to be actually hungover.\n\nThe drinks were surprisingly not overly sweet and made with lots of that pellet style-ice that we so heart in drinks like these.  The iced tea was quality and the crisp tartness of my cranberry limeade (with actual half of a real lime floating in it) was perfectly refreshing.  The mac n' cheese thingees tasted like a crispy fried stouffers mac n' cheese.  Sadly, these are a limited time only option. As for my tater-tots with cheese, eh, not so good.  They were just bland cafeteria-style tots with a slice of American cheese thrown ontop--A wrinkly transparent orangish shellac coalescing my tots into a gelatinous choir.\n\n...and that was and is how I met a Sonic.", "business_id": "po5FyERB4lUZNnBIwnhFlg", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-05-03", "type": "review"}

The first time it happened, I looked at the wrapping around the sandwich after I'd realized it was ham and it was labeled ham. So the second time I made sure to look at the wrapping when they gave me my food and it was marked sausage so I thought I was good and it turned out to be ham anyway.

Every so often I'd get a letter on the door about an incorrection or price jump on my lease.  And this is after signing a year lease.  If you want to live there you have to ask specific questions about the lease.

Their reasons are never clear.  And then before I moved they sent a letter stating that I needed to vacate the premises no later than March 30th even though I knew my lease ended on the 31st.  So, I followed directions and turned in my keys on the 30th.  When I got my \"security deposit\" explanation back, I noticed that I was charged $26 for leaving the apartment a day early. \n\nI called and the customer service manager, Aaron, was a hair short of being completely rude on the phone.

Then he proceeded by adding, \"even if you were to take it to court, all the judge would see is that you didn't honor your lease.\" \n\nBy the way, after they nickeled and dimed my security deposit, I got $12 back.

Also, disregard any reviews from prior to June/July of 2012 as this complex was under different management back then. \n\nI lived here for 3 years under BRE and almost always loved living here. Ever since renewing with the new management, MEB, last year I've been miserable. \n\nI was looking to upgrade from a 1BR to a 2BR and was instantly offered a great location in the complex with promise it was fully upgraded at a specific price (by Tomas). Two days later I got a call from the front office telling me I actually could not have that apartment as they had also offered it to someone else... and they would be giving it to the other people, not me - without explanation to why. They, however promised to find me another location. \n\nWhen the new location was determined I got a call but was told I wouldn't be able to see it until 10 days prior to my move in as it was currently occupied. The manager, Pam, promised that the unit was FULLY upgraded with a fireplace and new cabinets and laminate floors.  I was nervous to wait until so close to my move date but I  still trusted the new management group as they seemed eager to keep me in the complex. HUGE mistake. \n\nOn my tour through the unit it was a disaster. The floors were stained. There was a terrible infestation of ants. The cabinets were so old and disgusting and the entire kitchen was so filthy it actually smelled. Even Carolyn (who was showing me the unit) seemed disgusted. \n\nAt this point my current apartment was completely packed and ready to go only to now be told there were no acceptable, livable apartments in the complex for me to move in to. I was in a tight spot - I had very little time to look for another place to live and had to be traveling for work for the next 3 weeks. I felt stuck and dependent on the management to find me another location in the complex. \n\nI finally received a call from Pam that another location would be available for me to view and make a decision. When I came to view it Pam pawned me off on Carolyn to show me the unit (it was more important for her to go to lunch than to diffuse an already messy situation). Carolyn pleasantly obliged. The unit, to my surprise, was much cleaner. The carpets needed to be replaced which she assured me would happen. The cabinets were not upgraded and were stained as were the counters and the rent was higher than originally discussed. We reached an agreement to bring the rent back down if I didn't make them upgrade the kitchen (as usual, I got the raw end of the deal). When I viewed the unit I pointed out the loud noise coming from the apartment above me and mentioned that I would not be able to put up with that even during the day as I often work from a home office. I was told they would notify the neighbors someone would be moving in below so they were more conscientious of their noise.\n\nAfter moving in I filled out the extensive \"pre-existing problems\" sheet with items that included overly patched walls, obvious flood damage on the ceiling as well as near the sink, scratch marks in the laundry room (even though I was assured this unit was previously pet free as I am VERY allergic to animals - again I let it go as the carpets were replaced and I just did a deep clean when I moved in), stained counter, stained cabinets, stained refrigerator, stained showers, rusty washed and dirty/damaged dryer. When I turned it in they made no offer to come correct any problems (something the previous management did when I first moved in to my first unit). \n\nThe upstairs neighbors were never quieter than the day I saw the unit and were often MUCH louder. They played loud music, they dropped cigarette butts off their balcony onto mine, they threw garbage and food over their balcony. Every time I complained I was promised action that never seemed to come. At one point, after calling security on their loud noise after 2am I heard the security guard tell them it was \"the neighbor downstairs complaining\". This began the retaliation - my assigned parking spot is located far from my unit and every time I was walking back to my door they would sit on their balcony calling me vulgar things and spitting and pouring drinks over the balcony as I walked by. I reported this to no reaction from management as well. \n\n I later found out the unit above was housing 5 people although only 1 was on the lease - meaning no other adult had been background checked  for a criminal history. As a woman living alone I became more concerned. I pushed harder for them to take action and in turn manager Pam offered to \"let\" me break my lease at no charge - she tried to push me out instead of dealing with the real issue. I pointed out that is MEB wanted to break the lease they would be legally obligated to abide by their terms just the same and that they wouldn't be doing ME the favor by trying to force me to leave and pay to try and move again. She relented and 5 months later the neighbors above me finally moved", "business_id": "T9p5rNXbxOYYIbdUOznXyQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-04-03", "type": "review"}

The property has a good amount of green space and plenty of places to walk around, which was important for me in deciding someplace to live as I do have the dog and obviously no backyard.\n\nMy complaint would be sound and heat insulation of the apartment. The walls seem to be poorly insulated as I can hear my neighbor's every song in the shower, when his cell phone vibrates, and even when he sneezes. Heat insulation is poor as well, compared to other places I have lived. Even with the a/c on, it is never a consistent temperature in the apartment. Sitting on the couch near the wall is the hottest thing ever in the middle of the day, even with the a/c on (but walk 2 feet in another direction and it's a completely different temperature). The screens don't seem to fit the windows as there is a gap in each and every one of them. Meaning, I can't open the windows without risking a bug coming in, which is not worth it to me. It's weird \"complaining\" about those structural issues as the office staff can't do anything about them. It's not a huge deal but does make me question the quality of the rent as this is one of the most expensive apartments in the area.\n\nOverall, decent experience living here and you can't beat the location.

The paneer was definitely on the skimpy side, but I didn't mind.  The taste was definitely still there - perhaps they blend it in more than other restaurants?

We walked into a beautifully appointed clean place with white table cloths, red napkins and that was another pleasant surprise The price for the buffet is $8.95 per person and well worth that.

The chick pea salad was so good that I devoured 2 plates of that.  They also had a large bowl of what looked to be taco chips.  However, they were homemade and so crunchy with Indian flavoring.  I could have just eaten that alone.  I was pretty stuffed at this point.  The main dishes were Tandoori chicken, Curry chicken with a great sauce.  Another curry dish with potatoes and onions.   Of course rice and paneer which was also yummy.  A couple of simosa fritters which were a little tough but was still tasty.  Three different deserts.  Rice pudding was great to take the bite out of some of the moderately spicy  dishes.  Also a carrot pudding which if your'e Jewish reminded me of Tsimis. Not sure how to spell it.

Getting the food was one of my responsibilities and I had considered deli trays and had also looked at a few other catering places on line. All I knew is that I'd sooner die than call Fazoli's (who has often catered this lunch before). So it struck me suddenly with about a week to go- Red Devil! It's Italian, so it fits the theme, and we have always had a good meal there when we've gone. \n\nI stopped in to see the GM, Doug, and he took my order, assuring me that the portions listed for the hotel pan sizes I was getting are generous- I was feeding teenagers, after all, so I had my concerns. I was relieved that they could easily and pleasantly take my order so late in the game. They dropped off the food at our location on time, hot and fresh, and they even brought the napkins, plates, and plastic-ware. \n\nThe food was a HUGE hit with everyone. The first pan to be emptied was the meat lasagna, followed by the chicken lasagna, and then the veggie penne pastas, one with chicken. The rolls were fantastic, and they even gave us plenty of real butter. Even the salads were by far a bigger hit with the kids than I had expected. And Doug was right- there was plenty of food and lots of people went back for seconds.\n\nBest of all, when I gave the receipt to the treasurer of the organization, she was shocked at how low the price was, since last year, Fazoli's had cost close to twice as much! There is absolutely no comparison between the two when it comes to quality.\n\nI would heartily recommend Red Devil for your catering needs- as well as for dinner.

They are super crispy and sauce is the baseline hot/vinegary/buttery awesomeness by which  I measure other wings. Their ranch is absolutely amazing and they are not stingy with it. Enough left over to dip pizza in afterward for the ultimate in glutton. I always go for the hot but their other flavors are good. If  you want a real treat just ask them not to sauce the wings and get a few sides of dipping sauce. The teriyaki they coat their chicken in for their oriental salad makes a GREAT wing dip.\n\nThe pizza crust is super crunchy and has an amazing flavor, cheese is nice and greasy, and the toppings are good quality. The sauce is a little flat but I can look past it considering all the other pros.\n\nIf you are lucky enough to dine in the wings are even better and they will serve you these delicious pizza bread rolls.

Even in the \"cheap seats\" (B Section) area, there's still a good view of the stage. We sat in the first row of the B section, and for the most part we had no problems seeing anything. However, if you're at an event here where a lot of people are walking around during the event, your view might be obstructed by the people walking down the pathway separating the lower section and the B section.\n\nWe got here an hour before the show, and had no problems finding parking. The lot is huge, but I can see how there can be traffic problems getting in and out of here if everyone is trying to get in or leave at the same time since there is only one entry and exit point. We also left a little early since we didn't want the headache of waiting to get out. The on-site parking is $5 so be prepared!\n\nThey have food and beverage options such as beer, water, soda, popcorn, nachos, hot dogs, and burgers. As with any venue, prices are a bit high. Unfortunately, there's not much around this area in walking distance to eat at except for a taqueria and fish and chips place, and you probably don't want to be walking too much here anyways since it's not the best part of town. The light rail stop is also a bit of a walk to the theater (~1 mile), so convenient public transportation is also out of the question. \n\nOverall, a cool place to see a show.", "business_id": "BcBxTyj09Wu-w0KA1QvKTA", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-04-07", "type": "review"}

In doing so they threw away the belongings I had in the apartment including clothes & towels. Not only had they entered to \"clean\" the apartment once but TWICE! After the first incident I went up to the office and they said \"oh we're not sure if someone has been in your apartment\". Huh?? So silly me I thought that there was NO WAY they would make the mistake of coming back prematurely again after I just went to complain...WRONG! They entered the apartment again without my permission the following week and again threw away my belongings. This time I went to the management office and one girl was trying to contact maintenance to get to the bottom of this. Then out of nowhere here comes the head manager not saying hi & even asking me what happened; she immediately goes on the defensive and says her guys weren't in my apartment and that I need to file a police report because apparently someone must've broken into my apartment. I proceeded to ask her who would break into an apartment lock the door afterwards and CLEAN IT UP??? After she realized she was making no sense she refused talk or help me anymore and said there was nothing they could do. The funny part is I could hear the head maintenance guy in the other lady's office saying \"yeah I went in there the other day because I thought it was vacant...but once I saw some clothes I just moved the blinds over and walked out.\" So they were clearly lying to me at the leasing office to cover their own butts. I was highly disappointed in this complex because it is such a beautiful complex but don't be fooled like I was...don't move here! Not to mention they're overpriced.", "business_id": "bVRoCoXu2jIyqbZRT_isWw", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-05-28", "type": "review"}

If you are considering living at Courtney Village, please do yourself an enormous favor and RUN immediately! This is by far the worst place I have ever lived. First and foremost, get ready to be constantly hit with random fees. Your monthly rent will NEVER be the same. You have a base rent, but they pile on the fees constantly every month. Secondly, majority of the maintenance staff are extremely rude. I got yelled at because my dog pooped in the dog park and I didn't immediately run over and pick it up. I had every intention of picking it up, I just wasn't aware I would be scolded for not catching it as it fell out of his ass. Also, one time my roommate was on vacation for the weekend and had locked her bedroom door (which was the master bedroom with the other restroom inside) my toilet handle broke, so I called maintenance. They told me that because I had another restroom in my apartment, even though I had mentioned I didn't have access to it, that it wasn't classified as an \"emergency\" and they wouldn't send anyone until Monday. This happened first thing when I woke up on Saturday. So I had to walk to the public bathroom by the pool all weekend just to use the restroom. Speaking of the pool, if you live on the south side apartments, the pool isn't heated and there is no hot tub, so get ready to rarely or never use the pool. Also, the waterfall feature hasn't worked for about 6 months. At one point it must have been something with the pump that was going out because it was so loud constantly I was worried it was going to explode and kill us all (wishful thinking?!). Another negative, it is in the ghetto. During the 14 month lease I was there for, there was a domestic shooting, a police helicopter hovered over the complex and shined the spotlight in all of the hallways and windows for a good 15 minutes, constant parking lot arguments, as well as parking lot sexual favors, multiple shootings in the area, car break ins, and my personal favorite was when my boyfriend and I were walking in the parking lot and a cop pulled up and asked him very sternly if his name was Clinton (he's not Clinton). I have never felt more unsafe in my life. My boyfriend wouldn't let me take my dog outside alone after dark. If I could go back 14 months ago, I would run for the hills screaming.

Just like not every school is for every learner. \n\nAnyway, I moved from the East about four years ago and within that time I found Faith Christian Center.  After attending a few services I realized that I had found my perfect-fit church.  My spiritual life has been transformed since I became a part of this community.

It's not legalistic, it's realistic.  It's not too big, nor too small.  It's multicultural and non-denominational. It's a blend of the old spiritual- and new praise songs.

We were surprised!\n - Zoo Lights!  Starting around Thanksgiving and going through January they light up much of the zoo with cool themed displays.  It's not the entire zoo, so less of a walk, but enough of one that it's worth the price of admission.\n - It's conveniently close to the Desert Botanical Gardens if you want to make your trip a 2-fer.\n - 2 Words - PETTING ZOO!

Dont get me wrong, any zoo is cool as shit in my book, I just wasn't wowed at all by anything going on here.\n\nThere is an alright mix of animals, coolest ones included the giraffes, my favorite of course, the jungle cats and the stingrays we had to pay $3 each to hang out with and pet. Then on top of that you pay another $5 for a cup of shrimp and anchovies to feed to them.. $16 collectively for two people for one exhibit alone and you've just bought another adult admission. Steep, but I will say the rays were pretty rad even though all ll I could think about was Steve Erwin and dying a miserable electrical death, so my inhibitions were high, but once I realized 37 5 year olds were braver than I was, I sucked it up and stuck my hands in the pool. In case you didn't know, they are wicked slimy.\n\nAnother thing that I wish I could have done was ride one of the camels, but my dumb ass wore a dress, so this wasn't about to happen. \n\nThe biggest let down of the day was the fact that one of the exhibits was under some psycho construction, so there were baco's and dump trucks and other various tractors making copious amounts of obnoxious noise. Needless to say the safari trail was anything but tranquil.. I felt really bad for the chimps that had to sit next to that shit all day too. Not cool.. wait till you close and move those babies.\n\nI dunno, maybe its just the concept of tropical animals residing in the desert that is strange to me, but its just not that awesome here. I felt bad for them, and I don't think its just because I am a hippie. Also, I'm not sure if its always as crowded as it was or if every pre-school in Arizona was taking a field trip here that day but it was so loud, there were strollers everywhere, I almost fell on about 12 kids, got tripped by about 54 of them, but nonetheless, it was funny and seeing how excited they got at the sight of the animals made it a little bit more magical, even though this zoo kinda blows.", "business_id": "1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-04-09", "type": "review"}

The worst thing about this zoo is the price. In this depression (yes, with a small d), why does $18 per adult make sense? I know you can get free tickets at the library, but have any of you ever actually tried to get tickets at the library? They're always out. This zoo nickel and dimes your pocket. If you want to pet the sting rays (who wants to pet a sting ray?), the giraffes, if you require water or a wheelchair, they're ready with their sticky fingers. I feel sorry for the people who paid to feed the giraffes because I watched as they were hounded with instructions on what to do, where and how to do it and what not to do. It really stifles the enjoyment of feeding the giraffes. Wonder how the giraffes feel. I watched as a lady complained in front of a large crowd of people about the giraffe feeding price and the lady taking cash answered matter-of-factly that it's a non-profit zoo. This is the phrase they've been taught to say. The woman walked away, likely feeling scorned. A small salad costs $8. A bottle of water is $3. Boat rides are $12 ea. Camel rides are $12. For a Polaroid of the camel ride, it's $5. \n\nIf you purchase a $75 membership, you can come back throughout the year and receive an overrated discount on feeding the giraffes and the tram ride and the carousel for a grand total of $1-2 a ride! To clarify, I DON'T have kids. Yes, I'm complaining about the cost of TWO adults. \n\nThe cashier at the entrance is a nasty woman named Eyvonne. She must have needed a Depends change and that would explain her CRAPPY attitude. The rest of the zoo is staffed by high brow teenagers. It's too bad the animal environment doesn't soften their attitude. \n\nThis is primarily a hot weather zoo. There are no penguins or polar bears here. A lot of cages are empty and you get disappointed. I've been here a few times and have yet to see the coyotes. On the \"Desert Trail\", they are true to the spirit of the desert, because there's no water fountains on it. \n\nThat said, I enjoy the World Wildlife Zoo on Olive Ave. much better and would gladly drive from Mesa to Waddell to go there.

There were a few areas that were remodeling or under construction, so it seems like this zoo is pretty good about updating their trails w/ new and exciting things every so often.\n\nCons: price - $18/adult actually isn't all that bad for the experience, but they really do try to nickel and dime you once you're inside, and they taunt you with all snack booths at every corner!  I saw that small items such as a churro or snow cone were well over $3.  They do have quite a few interesting attractions (sting ray aquarium, guided bus tour, boat ride, feed the giraffes, etc.) that are available at extra cost ranging from $3 - $10 a piece.\n\nTips: \n- Definitely plan to spend at least half a day there to see everything your $18 covers.  Go early so you can find decent parking and avoid the afternoon heat.\n- Protect yourself from sun damage: sunscreen, hat, sunglasses\n- Bring and drink plenty of water!\n- Bring plenty of on-the-go snacks so you don't have to pay for theirs!  \n- A travel size bottle of hand sanitizer could be useful as well.", "business_id": "1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-03-12", "type": "review"}

I have been to other zoos and they do not have all the animals we do...they have a splash pad for kids that is awesome!  The petting zoo is pretty cool...just make sure to wash your hands!

The zoo opens at 9 during the winter, 8 during summer, members are welcome an hour early, but very few services are available before the actual open. The zoo will sell you a ticket until closing (full price), but by arriving early you beat most crowds, get the best parking, and often see the animals at their friskiest.\n2. Bring your own. This includes food, drinks (N-A), strollers and wheelchairs.. Many of these items can be purchased or rented there, but at a cost with a built in convenience fee. Having said that, do not bring bikes, Seguays, roller blades, Razor type scooters, and definitely do not bring your own pet!\n3. Discounts are not widely advertised, but ask about them: Senior (60+), Military, Student, AAA, Other Zoo memberships are a few examples.\n4. Prepare. Bring Sun Screen, hats, etc. \n5. Your general admission into the zoo allows you to see most everything, but it does not always cover additional things to do, such as: Camel riding, Giraffe feeding, the \"Train\" tour, etc. It's hard to say no to kids, but set the expectation beforehand about how the trip will go and things will be much easier. Packages including the train, the new 4D theater, and other elements give a discount to buying the attractions individually and can greatly enhance your visit.\n6. If you want the full experience, allow at least three hours. It is actually larger in terms of acreage compared to the San Diego Zoo, and your legs will feel it if you see all there is.\n7. If you like what you saw and think you will be back, buy the membership. You can use the money you spent on the ticket that day towards a pass that will allow you entry for an entire year. It has to be the same day, but it pays itself back in less than three trips.", "business_id": "1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-03-21", "type": "review"}

The only thing that impressed me was the enclosures are large, which is great for the animals, but the variety is lacking. I do not recommend going during the afternoon on a hot day.

Water is free unless you're opposed to using a water fountain. They're located all over the zoo. Still, unlike many places, they allow you to bring in your own drinks and snacks. I didn't pay a dime for anything other than my ticket and didn't feel like I missed out on anything. Also, even though I'm only in town for a couple of weeks, I got a membership.

I had it a little mixed up in my head with the circus but I blame the fact that a lot of zoos have carousels. This zoo has the Endangered Species Carousel, how's that for a mix of happy and sad? Anyway, I advise just getting a membership. If you're going to spend the money on one trip, a membership is a better deal, and it gets you into all kinds of other zoos and aquariums around the country, so if you go traveling you already have a discount to local attractions. I thought I might not actually use that perk but I've already visited the San Francisco Zoo, the Omaha Zoo, and the St Louis Zoo with business and family trips over the last year.

The zoo closes at 5pm, the last person is let into the stingray area at 4:50pm...HOW DOES IT MAKE SENSE THAT THEY REFUSE TO SELL YOU A TICKET AT 4:44PM? Oh, because they are counting up the days earnings...15min before the zoo closes. WTF!? This is the equivalent of the gift shop refusing to sell you an item 15min before the zoo closes because they are 'counting'. How about counting after 4:50pm when it makes more goddamn sense? Oh, because the Phoenix Zoo doesn't like being very sensible.\n\nIt's a nice zoo. It's a pretty decent sized zoo. It's a zoo that has nearly 10% of their animals off exhibit, and usually don't have any immediate signage for it. Take the Andean bear for example (their ONLY bear), it's little habitat is up a hill, not a bad hill, but a hill that could have been avoided if a damn sign had been put down at the bottom that said what the one at the top says, \"Animal just had baby, not here.\" I'm serious, there was a ridiculous amount of animals not there at all- and waaaay more signs that said \"Animal being monitored.\" What does that mean!?\n\nPrices are low- too low in fact for any jerk off the street to come in and act, well, like a jerk. I'm sure if it's just that people from here are innately annoying and lack any common courtesy, but they sure as hell did at the Zoo, and so did their snot nosed kids who let out as if this place were a Laser Tag. \n\nOne kid spit in the prairie dog habitat. Full one SPIT, and his parent? \"Oh, that was gross.\" Uh, ok, gross and fucking rude. I felt like knocking out the teeth of a group of kids by the Maned Wolf habitat (which IS NOT A WOLF dur) while they screamed and howled at it... BECAUSE THAT WILL TOTALLY MAKE IT HOWL BACK. Six. Kids. And the mom thought it was the FUNNIEST thing in the world! \"Oh look guys, he's looking at us! HAHAAHAHA\" Dear god in heaven.\n\nBesides the annoying people you will HAVE to deal with, and the missing beasts, the zoo here is nice. They have really cool 'experiences':\n1. Giraffe encounter- If you are a non member you pay 5$ a person to go up and feed giraffes! We only got two tiny biscuits each, but it was worth it! You get to take pictures with the giraffe, and the zoo keeper will tell you whatever you want! I advise to get there early, so you can be one of the first, since the whole thing depends on how the giraffes feel, and remember that they do this twice a day, so if you go the second time, they may not want to eat.\n2. MONKEYS!!!- There is a little monkey house, where you go in, and monkeys are running all around you! It's FREE! Tiny little monkeys jump from tree to tree, and even run across your path- SO FRICKEN CUTE!\n3. Stingray- We, obviously, didn't get to do this, but, it's a cool thing nonetheless. Pay 3$ to get in, pay some more for food, and lean over a pool and touch some stingrays!\n\nThe best habitat would have to be the prairie dogs- they are in the Arizona Trail, and you can lean over a get a really close picture of them since it is basically open. There are nearly ten at a time running around and kissing each other, and it's very entertaining!\n\nFood here is of course very, very expensive, but you can bring in your own, and even a cooler.", "business_id": "1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-04-23", "type": "review"}

Worst interaction with any employee ever. \nMy mother was visiting here from out of town and we decided to take my 2 1/2 year old my mom and myself to the Phoenix Zoo today.\nWe got there at noon and purchase the Wild Ride bands.  We spent all day at the zoo and were exhausted at the end of the day. It was 5PM and the zoo was closing so we were making our way to the exit. I had my 2 1/2 yr old daughter in a wagon and had pulled her around the zoo, I've been to the zoo several times and know that they want most traffic to exit through the gift shop but I didn't want to lug around my wagon into the gift shop, instead I preferred to exit through the entrance so I made my way towards the entrance to exit.  There was one young guy standing right in the middle of the gates and he said to me are you looking for the exit and I said well I want to exit here instead of going through the gift shop because I don't want to roll this wagon through there and he responded sorry you have to this is not an exit. I wasn't turning around though so I kept walking toward the left side of the gate, he was still standing in the middle of the section and said you can't exit here and I said, well listen this gate here opens can you just open it? (I waited for him to come over and offer to help but he stood fast where he was and said no)\nWhen I realized he wasn't going to accommodate I started to work the latch and I said it opens this way right (pulling instead if pushing)? he says No, then I pushed and it opened and he said it opens that way.\n(At this point I wasn't mad, just wanted to leave). As I opened the gate and rolled through I said I am not going through the gift shop with my daughter and this wagon, when you have kids you'll understand, to which he replied; \"maybe you should learn how to say no.\" I stopped in my tracks and turned to him (still leaning against the turn style) and I said \"Maybe you should mind your own business.\" Then I turned around again and heard; \"maybe you shouldn't be such a Dick.\" WOW I was really speechless that an employee would say something like that in front of my child!!!! Of course physical contact is out of the question so I said \"do you like working here because today's your last day buddy.\"\nHe looked and rolled his eyes, I said get your manager out here right now and he said \"No.\" So I noticed his radio was sitting on the gate right in front if him so I walked up to grab it and he said oh no and took it. I turned around looking for someone and no one was there so I started to call the zoo on my cell phone and just then an employee was walking in the office and I waved her down from the outside she came out and I explained what just happened and the she said OK hold on and went back in to return moments later with a supervisor, I didn't catch her name but she came out and shook my hand and introduced herself. \nI explained what just happened and she looked at the employee and waited for his response.  He said I walked up and asked for him to open the gate and then I just opened the gate and walked out. He totally denied everything after that and didn't admit anything! Crazy right?!\nI've gotta say in hindsight this supervisor didn't handle this effectively. The first thing she started to explain to me was their gate/exit policy saying how they do ask all guests to exit thru the gift shop and that the only reason the entrance gate is open is because of the fire code...I kind of interrupted her and said \"you don't have to explain that to me...\" Then just asked what's your policy if a guest insists on exiting here are you required to allow it and she said yes. OK then that's end of story this guy did nothing and was very inappropriate and she said \"well this is a he said she said and we will have a talk with him. \"\nWhen I got home I told my wife what happened and she was furious, she said you paid to have a good experience there and an employer was not only rude to you for no reason but used bad language in front of your child and no one apologized to you or offered you anything. What kind of experience is that???\nSo I decided that first I need to notate what happened so I don't forget, second I am going to place a call tomorrow to the park manager and discuss what took place.\nI was real exhausted today and just wanted to leave and didn't take the time to think about how I should of handled this.\n\nUpdate to this review:\nI called the Zoo Tuesday morning and left a message for Jennifer which is Janelles supervisor but she never called me back, so I called the zoo Wed and asked for Jannelles boss Bonnie and left her a msg in the AM and no one called back. If I hear something I will update this review.", "business_id": "1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-04-28", "type": "review"}

There are four trails with different themes for each trail. The Arizona trail has animals native to the Southwestern United States, the Children's trail has animals that can be seen up close, the Africa trail has the rhino/giraffes, and the Tropics trail has monkeys and the elephant.\n\nI feel as though the Phoenix Zoo does a great job of combining the confinement/borders of a zoo with the natural landscape of the area. It doesn't feel as manufactured/sterile as the San Diego zoo, for example. It feels as though you can get rather close to the animals. \n\nOne of my favorite exhibits is The Monkey Village - which is an enclosure with 14 squirrel monkeys that you can walk through and see them up close. They are just the cutest!\n\nGeneral admission is $17 with a student discount, but it's worth it to get a membership if you're a local and plan on going a couple times a year.\n\nOverall, you could get through the whole zoo in 3 hours, but you can also slow down your experience and have lunch/visit the souvenir shop.

Before I moved in the complex was managed by Greystar then switched over to Alliance. The morning I was scheduled to move in, the people working the front office had no idea what keys to give me and after I told them I had to leave to meet the movers they agreed to give them to my brother- which they did but without checking his ID to make sure he was the person they were supposed to give them to. \n\nThe complex grounds and the surrounding areas where people walk their dogs always has dog feces and there seems to be a shortage of doggy bags the majority of the week. The security gates stay broken like they have given up on trying to fix them. The drive in gates and clickers are questionable as to when they they work- the last months of my lease after trying to get a clicker that worked from the main office several times, I gave up on having a functioning one. The complex itself has a high turn over with people leaving in the middle of the night- there would be drunk people who don't live at the complex hanging out by the pool mooching off residents- police rolled through on more then one occasion- weekends were debatable on if you would be woken up at 3 am by people vomiting in their driveway- questionable as to if there are any background checks that got one on potential residents. \n\nThey say they are pet friendly but only in the sense they use it to charge you as much as possible. Make sure you don't have ANY stain of any type on your carpet because if you do they will replace all the carpet in the unit on your expense at move out. At inspection, I was told the carpet in the guest bedroom would be replaced but ended up getting a bill for ALL the carpet in the unit. If you can have someone with you during your walk through, do it- that way you'll have a witness who can support you if they try to charge you for stuff other than what they told you during the inspection.\n\nMake sure you know your lease- I had signed a short lease and upon verifying my move out date, discovered they had me down for a lease almost 6 months longer then what I signed up for. Also be aware that they will jack up your rent when it comes to renewing- I knew many people that left because they could no longer afford the constant increases. \n\nThe place I live at now is managed by Greystar and I can tell the difference. My new place is much bigger then Palazzo but the grounds are well kept, little noise, there is a constant presence of maintenance staff and the management team, I pay less for rent and enjoy little things like secure property gates, a mail box that you can actually drop mail off in, and staff that follows up and follows through.

I think he was just lazy.\n\nThere's also a few other people, 2 to be exact, that work late and are just not that nice nor that helpful.  I needed some packing tape to use on my clipboard.

The blonde, heavy set woman, said I should wait for the bellman but this was really late at night and after waiting for a few minutes I told her that I knew where the tape was and she cut me off saying she couldn't allow me to go through those drawers...fair enough...but how bout you taking your fat ass around the counter and getting it for me????????  sorry, if my thoughts (of course I didn't say this) sound rude but come on, you're in customer service....what got me more mad is that the next day I the same situation happened, I needed more tape but the nice latino front desk guy told me I could get it myself.

I was sharing a room with two other female colleagues and were appalled at the service we received during our stay. We were already upset with being relocated from the Renaissance Downtown Hotel a few days prior to attending the conference and the awful customer service provided by the hotel added to our negative overall experience with the Marriott franchise. \n\nEarly Tuesday morning, two men came pounding at our door at 2 a.m. They identified themselves as a security guard and a worker at the hotel. They stated that this was our second warning and demanded that we open the door. This was quite alarming being that we never received a first warning for anything and were sincerely concerned about our safety. \n\nWhen we called the front desk to inquire if the two men standing outside were part of the staff of the hotel and to explain to guest services that we should have received a phone call from guest services in the first place, a guest relations worker by the name of Caroline asked us if we planned to continue with the noise level and responded with an unwarranted attitude that there was laughter heard from our room and someone in the room next to us called to complain. We were taken aback by her attitude because while we would have been more than happy to bring our noise level down, we did not expect a representative from guest services to be the one to talk back or respond to us in a matter that was rude and unnecessary when all we wanted to do was to explain to her about our concerns because we did not feel safe. We were extremely alarmed by the way the hotel handled the situation because we felt like our privacy was violated and our safety was jeopardized by these two strangers demanding us to open the door at 2 a.m. To make matters worse, when we brought this issue to the attention of the Front Office Manager, Camille Cobos, she simply made no effort to be apologetic or explain to us why this situation occurred. She simply brushed off our concerns and nonchalantly thanked us for bringing the matter to her attention.\n\nOur office and many of the administrators and faculty at our work frequently travel to various locations across the United States in our line of work. We often choose the Marriott as a top hotel choice for our stay. However, this awful experience at the Phoenix Airport Marriott hotel has made us question the quality of customer service their staff provides to their clientele.  Several of my colleagues also expressed other concerns regarding their stay at this particular Marriott as well. We wrote a letter to the Marriott corporation as well as to the hotel and we have they can take this important matter into consideration and provide positive experiences for current and future Marriott guests as we would not want them to have the same experience as we did. There has not been a response from any Marriott representatives so far since we sent in the letter early March.", "business_id": "_yGo2ubkwQPXcKrdcURSNw", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-04-04", "type": "review"}

So, the General Manager, Jeff Bhatti, replied to the letter that me and my colleagues sent to them about their associate interaction and they basically told us that they received the letter, apologized for any inconvenience.\n\nHe also wrote in the letter:\n\n\"It is our objective to provide each and ever guest a comfortable stay with utmost respect and privacy. Your comments play a critical role in our success and progress. I appreciate the time you took to bring it to my attention. Based on you comments, I have shared my concerns with the staff and emphasized review of our training and procedures. We shall implement and improve any steps needed to ensure that our guests have a positive experience at the hotel. We are grateful for having had many opportunities over several of past years to successfully take care of hospitality needs of our guests while in Phoenix area. We look forward to continue with such relationship and will do our very best to prove our commitment to our objective.\"\n\nWhen we read that letter, we just looked at each other like that was just BS and were not satisfied by the half ass letter we received from the General Manager. First of all, there were spelling errors in the letter, and second of all, for them to say that they provide each and every guest a comfortable stay with the utmost respect and privacy. The two words he used, \"RESPECT\" and \"PRIVACY\" were two elements that the Phoenix Airport Marriott hotel did not demonstrate to us during our time at their hotel. The guest relations worker did not show us RESPECT when she was talking back at us and asking if we planned to make any more noise after I expressed my concern about her sending strange men up to our room w/out any warning or notice to bring down the noise level (which there weren't any, we were just talking in our room. \n\nThere were no music on, no tv on, no blow dryer on, we were just talking our normal tones but I don't know if the walls are just SUPER thin or what but regardless, we should have received a phone call from them in the first place.). For her to say \"So you plan to make more noise next time?\" I wanted to be like \"No B****, I'm not! Stop being so fresh with me because I wasn't even trying to say that!! I was just bringing up my concern that there were two large men standing outside telling us it is our second warning and to OPEN the door when we haven't even received the FIRST warning in the first place!! Now, THAT is wrong and that is a violation of our PRIVACY!! Additionally, my friend told me that when we got into the hotel room, she noticed that those two men .. the SAME men that asked us to open the door, were checking us out at the hotel lobby. They were looking at us up and down which creeped out my friend. Since, we have 3 young ladies staying in the room, WHY THE HELL WOULD WE OPEN THE DOOR to TWO STRANGERS who were checking us out and Open the door for them?! We aren't even sure if they are hotel security. But regardless, the hotel did not make us feel SAFE or COMFORTABLE at all and again, me and my colleagues are extremely disappointed in how the management has handled our concerns.\n\nBasically, the letter that was sent to us was BS BS BS! Our company will never stay at their hotel again and I will make sure to spread the word to all our friends and family because when I do inform them about our horrible experience, they are absolutely appalled that the hotel made no efforts in making up the experience for us in any way. The \"thank you for bringing this up to our attention\" is BS to us and we will make sure that everyone who is looking for a hotel in Phoenix will never come to this establishment again. \n\nThank you for letter but we would rather give our business to another hotel that actually cares about their reputation and their guests!", "business_id": "_yGo2ubkwQPXcKrdcURSNw", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-04-17", "type": "review"}

Our pets!! \n\nWhen our lease was up the first time (should've taken the opportunity to run for it!) they harassed us daily about re-signing a lease. The lease renewal letter they gave us had the incorrect date on it that our lease was up. I called to talk to them about it- no call back (I called 4 times! Christian the office manager is a half wit!) I finally went in to talk to someone in person. Their response?!

There were a few things here and there that needed to be done but it met my expectations. \nI was waiting to write this review until I experienced a maintenance need and today was the day. Yesterday our window was cracked from the bottom up, today we woke up to the A/C broken. We put in a request for both, but silly me, I forgot to check it was okay for them to come in without me being there (I was in a rush). \nSo, I called them at about 6:20 (after office hours), told them I needed my A/C fixed ASAP and they could enter whenever possible and the guy was here at about 6:35...seriously, I thought they would come tomorrow or something but nope, he was there pretty dam fast. 15 minutes later my A/C is fixed and he said he would have a guy over here tomorrow for our window. I am very impressed and grateful. \nWe pay $700 (not including water, tax ect.) per month for this place and I can say with confidence that it is well worth it. It's safe, we get along with our neighbors, has great amenities and a really friendly maintenance crew. \nI do have one complaint however...the woman on the after hours phone line is so rude.

We came directly from Salt Lake City, and put a deposit on a unit without seeing the apartment. When it comes to online reviews, especially Yelp and Google, I find them to be very telling of what experience to expect, so you can imagine my trepidation considering some of RMV's earlier reviews. \n\nWithin the first week of arriving at our new place, we had several maintenance issues. I noticed that the linoleum under the fridge was ripped up and that the caulking in the master bathtub needed a touch-up. I called the front office and Kyle from maintenance was at my door within 15 minutes. Both of those repairs were completed the next day. A couple days later, at midnight on a Friday, I heard a sizzling sound coming from our breaker box and it smelled like burnt ozone. I called the emergency maintenance line, and Joel arrived within 30 minutes. I felt horrible for making him come out on a weekend in the middle of the night, but he was so kind and took my concerns seriously. As it turned out, the breaker for our water heater needed replacement, and though it took a couple days to get the new breaker, the office and maintenance kept me updated through phone calls and stopping by my apartment to let me know they hadn't forgotten about me and that I was a priority. With all my phone calls and maintenance issues within the first week, I felt like a nuisance, but all of Red Mountain Villa's employees assured me I was not, and have made me feel at home in a city that I have no connections in. \n\nAs far as the property itself, it's beautiful. No issues with trash, though the occasional dog poop doesn't get picked up by owners. My neighbors are super-friendly and the only thing I can hear from my upstairs and side neighbors is the opening and closing of sliding doors. The pools are numerous and pristine. There's even a turtle living in one of the ponds...so cute! The fitness room has brand-new equipment and smells delicious, somehow. \n\nI am proud to live in Red Mountain Villas. Customer service makes or breaks a business in my eyes, whether it be a restaurant, doctor's office, or property management, and I can't express how fantastic my experience with RMV has been. I feel like a priority, even when I'm calling them every day for one thing or another. A special shout-out to Erik, Ashley, and Raissa at the office for their patience and concern, and Joel and Kyle from maintenance are timely and professional and just nice to talk to.

I've played it many times pre-renovation and was excited to finally play the \"new\" Papago.\n\nOnce I got past the first couple holes, I realized most of the course really hasn't changed too much. Most of the noticeable changes are on #1 and #9 since so many trees are gone, the ugly pond by the old #1 tee is no more, and the lake between those two holes is cleaned up and reshaped.\n\n#1 is tougher now and I don't see myself hitting it in two anymore, but I love the way it looks with the lake cleaned up. #2 is nicer without all the dead trees around the green which allows for the clear view of the buttes.\n\n#9 benefited the most from the changes in my opinion. It's a beautiful view from the tee and the drive is no longer partially blind from the tips. The entire hole is in view, and it looks great. \n\nNot sure I like the way #11 was changed. I like the cleaner view and the cleaned up lake, but it's a small green for a 190 yard tee shot all over water. I think they should of kept that hole the same distance and let that small, sloping, firm green be all the challenge you need there.\n\nThe greens are huge now and they are firm and fast, but still roll great. They pose quite a challenge as shown in all my failed up-and-downs today, but it's a fair challenge.\n\nBig props for the updated bathroom and the water and ice machine at the intersection of 5-6-11-12. LOVE the water and ice machine. You got fancy on me, Papago.\n\nThe pro shop and snack bar are in a trailer right now, and I don't know the status of the new clubhouse, but I have a feeling that it's a long way off due to the city budget issues. It still works for a muni, but don't expect resort-style amenities. \n\nSo all in all, I still love Papago and it's still arguably my favorite course and the best layout in the valley. The greens are a challenge but in a good way. The prices are higher now but still reasonable with the City of Phoenix discount golf card. If you're an out-of-towner, I'd say Papago is definitely a must-play, but the non-cardholder rates can be a little steep. \n\nDid I mention I love the new water and ice machine out on the course?", "business_id": "Y1HeP1ed5NPh7U5hhI7X0g", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-03-17", "type": "review"}

The course isn't running firm and fast like it was last time I was out there. It's definitely playing longer now since there is substantially less roll on the fairways. And the greens are slower and bumpier than last time. \n\nThe tees were also unmowed. Maybe they just went light on the mowing today, but I hope they firm up the course again. Hopefully they can find a balance of keeping the grass green in summer and still keeping the course firm.\n\nIt was surprisingly slow out there too.

Also the whole thing is in the middle of this rocky outcrop region of Phoenix with these massive red rock hills that are just absurdly cool to look at and are the backdrop during every hole.\n\nThe one caveat here is that there's a bunch of desert instead of legit OB area on the side of every hole.  You can go in and hit out of it, but there are rocks strewn throughout the sand and you are very likely to scuff up your clubs pretty good.\n\nStill, you can't beat the value here.

I should first say that I'm from an area that's saturated with Chinese restaurants, so I have pretty high standards for Chinese food. Lao Ching Hing fell far short of those standards. \n\nAt first glance, it seemed like a pretty nice restaurant. They invested a lot in very nice traditional-looking furniture, which I don't see often. So I enjoyed the overall atmosphere of the place. We were the only patrons when we went, so I can't really complain of bad service since we were the only ones being served.\n\nWe ordered the stir-fried string beans (my all-time favorite dish) and the salt and pepper pork. They were both so bad :( The string beans were under-seasoned and not really cooked the way it should have been cooked. In that particular dish, the beans should have been dried. It seems like they sort of skipped that step or didn't complete that step. So instead of nice crunchy beans, we got squeaky beans. The pork chops were worse though. I'm thinking it was at least a day old - you could taste the old oil - and they probably just re-heated it (we definitely heard a microwave go off). And that old oil taste stayed in my mouth long after dinner was over. Not pleasant.\n\nI think Panda Express has better-quality food than this place.

Very tasty and a really differant kind of spicy burn. It burned just the front of your tongue. We had pork dumplings, cabbage and a pork and garlic dish. I enjoyed all of them. They tasted like the food in China. The cabbage had small shrimp in it that we were not expecting and it was our least favorite dish. The sevice is typical Chinese. The soup came with the beef tendons. Then the cabbage and pork came out. Finally well into the meal the (appetizer)  dumplings came out.

Thankfully I stumbled onto MB Motors.  It was the only business that I'd ever researched that had nothing but 5 star reviews...too good to be true?  NOPE.  It's about 25 miles from our home, so it's not the most convenient, but there's no other place that I'll even consider taking my Benz.  \nMy most recent experience will explain exactly why.  We were driving from Seattle back to Goodyear last fall, and knowing that the tires were getting pretty thin, I made an appointment to have new tires installed along the way (in Oregon, no sales tax!).  Everything worked exactly as planned; we were in and out of the tire shop in about an hour...just enough time to have lunch.  A couple of hundred miles down the road the trouble began.  The traction control warning light illuminated...what now?  After looking through the manual we finally figured out how to deal with (disable) it; but it was persistent, illuminating almost every time we stopped for a break.  I called a Mercedes dealer and was told that it was safe to drive, just not in \"slippery\" conditions.  OK, fine, we won't go skiing.\nA couple of days after our return to the Phoenix area we found ourselves running some errands in the general neighborhood of MB Motors, so I decided to stop in and make an appointment to get this annoying problem taken care of.  The good folks at MB jumped right in trying to figure out what was causing this to happen...thinking and hoping (like I was) that it was something simple.  After about an hour of testing, tinkering with, and driving it (of course the darn light wouldn't come on with them looking!), they announced \"GOT IT!\"  \nWell folks, it turns out that the tire shop had inadvertently installed the correct size tires on one side of the car, and a slightly different size on the other side, which caused the traction control computer to warn us of a stability problem.  \nAs you already know if you're an MB customer, they refused to charge me for their diagnosis, and even called the nearest tire store (same national chain) to explain the problem and get the ball rolling for replacement of the two incorrect tires.  As an aside, I can't help but wonder if I'd ever have figured out that the tires were different sizes if the car wasn't so darn smart...smarter than me obviously. \nThis place is simply the best...thank you!     \n\nClark", "business_id": "0Xnduj9w6aYHOtN_RlHUng", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-04-22", "type": "review"}

Two very full people left only spending a total of ten bucks.\n* The salsa was SPICY.  Sometimes it seems to be tough to find places that take the risk of offending people with sensitive taste buds.\n\nThe Meh:\n* Maybe it was just b/c it was Sunday, but our server didn't really seem happy that we, nor she, were in El Nopalito\n* They may have been the smallest tacos I've ever had.  That being said, they were only a buck.\n* El Nopalito is located so close to so many great restaurants that it'll be tough to justify skipping some of those.\n* The chips for the salsa were lackluster at best.\n\nOverall I had a good experience.

There's this place I have been meaning to try forever, I tell him.  As soon as I said \"Hole in the wall mex joint\" he was enthusiastically driving in their direction.  As soon as we stepped in and we were the only gringos in there, I knew we were in for a treat.  The senoras who were working were so sweet to us, brought us out the complimentary chips and salsa, and guided us on what tacos were the best.  We each got 3 different ones to try, and my favorite that day was the cabeza (who would have thought!).  After an order of guac, 2 drinks, I was almost embarrassed that the bill was so cheap - like I was getting away with some kind of crime by not paying more.  It was more than reasonable.  \n\nThe man was so impressed that he went back the following weekend to surprise me with takeout breakfast in bed.  The senoras recognized him and made him feel so welcome and special.  On weekends, they serve this lamb soup, in fact I saw a few familias feasting on the soup the prior weekend, and she sat him down and gave him a hefty sampling complete with all the fixings on the side, along with chips and salsa while he waited for his takeout order.  He brought me chilaquiles which were awesome, and he had a breakfast burrito which was not as fat as your typical drive by, but I thought that the ingredients tasted fresher.  Either way, this has become a place in the rotation for sure.", "business_id": "s87D-mtAuJ8BluKgYYsXGw", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-05-12", "type": "review"}

Our drink order taken and without hesitation fresh totopos(corn chips) and two fresh salsas were brought to our table. Their salsas are always very good,.flavourful with a good amount of kick and not overly salty. one friend ordered chicken tacos with rice and beans, the other ordered steak burro with a side of beans, I ordered bean sopes..two of us ordered jaimiaca  for  beverages.my friend says his chicken tacos were fine, but that they were smaller then usual and that the amount of rice and beans on his plate was also small. my friend said his steak burro was very good. just that it was lacking any thing interesting. their was only meat in the burro no tomatoes no onions said it tasted good it could have had some thing else. my sopes were very good but on the small side. this place gets a extra star from me because they always grill my sopes instead of frying them and not all restaurants will do that. I must say this time the sopes were smaller and they did not have much beans on them in fact they didn't put much on them at all. usually they are topped with beans lettuce oinons and shredded cheese this time it was just a small  amount of beans, and just a tiny amount of lettuce. I also orderd chillis torreados with onions. the chillis  are always perfect here they don't over cook them. the onions on the other hand are always very oily and over cooked. Over all I like this place and would recommend.  the fact that they have sopes and huaraches. Because if you look most Mexican restaurants don't have sopes, gorditas or huaraches. At least on my local restaurant search. their are just a handful of restaurants that offer this on the menu. \n\nThe staff here is always accommodating and friendly.  the price is average and just about what you would pay at any other Mexican restaurant. \n\nhave yet to find......

One thing I liked instantly about the place is that it's spacious, with enough distance between the tables, and is well-lit. The restaurant was pretty full when we came in, at about 7, but we were immediately given a place to sit. For appetizers, we got the fried wontons with mustard and hot sauce dips. I thought the wontons were a little too crispy, and I would have liked some more filling in them. The service was fast and efficient, and we got the appetizers within seven minutes of being seated. For the main course, I got the Happy Family and partner got the Cashew chicken. They came with a medium sized bowl full of steamed rice. I had picked a Szechwan place because I was in the mood for spicy food, but both the dishes lacked any fire. We actually ended up getting hot sauce to spice things up! I liked the Happy Family....the veggies, meats and sauce made me happy. The portions were good for the price, though we did manage to eat everything up! I would have liked it though, if they offered tea with their food, as a complimentary add-on. And every table should have the usual condiments...soy sauce, a variety of hot sauces....those were strangely missing here.

The chicken was delicious, the rice (I got fried) wasn't too greasy and it came with a salad, your choice of soup, and egg roll. The salad surprised me, but it was pretty mediocre. I got the egg drop soup and while the portion was not as large as other places, they made up for it in quality. They are generous with the eggs and with the veggies that are in there. I love that they don't use green onions too (HATE green onions). The portion sizes are consistent with lunch-sized portions; pretty much what you'd expect. The crab puffs are absolutely delicious. I hate when I get crab puffs somewhere and they don't have crab or the cream cheese is cold OR they put too many onions in them.

Then when we got our food again disappointment as it was not up to par with good food. I decided not to write this place off as maybe this was a one off and the manager replaced our food. \n\nA few weeks later myself and roommate decided to get take out. We both got the steak  fajitas. Might I say we spent $18.00 and it was just gross . The meat was not cooked the other food was over cooked . At this point I called the manager to advise of these bad expirences. He apologized and that was it ! No offer to remake it and come back in . No offer of a refund for disappointment , nothing . \n\nI have now decided to share this with everyone to know this location is beyond bad and to not go here . If I could give it no star I would ! I will never return to this location or any other location again . If this place is not boycotted they will continue to make poor food and make money .

I stayed at this hotel for a work meeting held at the convention center in Phoenix. Our group had a discount at the Hilton Suites. There was a slight mix up with my roommate situation, but the front desk gentleman took care of it with no complaints and no further issues. The bed was comfy and I liked that the bedroom was completely separate from the living room and bathroom. It had a spacious bathroom, but the closet is in there too, so bummer if you're with a roomie who likes long showers and/or bathroom time. There was a small refrigerator and sink in the room.\n\nMy biggest disappointment was the pool. It's a small U-shaped indoor pool. Not great for laps and it gets crowded very quickly. Not to mention you are on display for the entire hotel while swimming. There was also a small work out room off the pool room. I liked the bar: decent food, drinks, and prices with plenty of seating. The hotel is right off the light rail stop, so it makes it easy to get down town. They also had a shuttle to take you anywhere within 2 miles of the hotel. I found the light rail easier, but there were plenty of people using the shuttle. \n\nBottom line: I'd stay here again and I'm sad I didn't get more time to explore the hotel.", "business_id": "urBWfXQjyyWIO5B7FvnOpg", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-04-07", "type": "review"}

And, let's just say I would DEFINITELY recommend this hotel to a client if I had to.  The Hilton staff was awesome, helpful and extremely friendly. I was getting a tooth ache from the gal who checked us in who was upbeat and HAPPY to allow us an early check in which was at 8 AM!!! I have never in my whole life been checked into a hotel or resort at 8 AM, b/c that is basically giving a room away for free!  I was super surprised and pleased by this, so it was a great first impression.\n\nIf you want to shuttle somewhere within 2 miles of the hotel, they will take you for free.  The gentlemen who drove us was incredibly nice, giving us advice and drove us all over the downtown area like our own personal driver.  It was a great experience!\n\nWhen something did go wrong (there was a situation/miscommunication regarding the shuttle pick up) they comped us a dessert and movie as an apology, which we didn't even ask for.  I was blown away again and again by the hotel and especially the staff.\n\nOur room boasted a lovely view of the mountains and palm trees, a king bed, two flat screen TVs, an oversized living space and a large bathroom.

In fact I was so surprised, I waited to write this review until I'd been here twice. Reading the other reviews, I think their fault lies in their night staff. Try to get there before 6ish to avoid the change-over.\n\nMy boyfriend and I live in Tucson and like coming up to Phoenix for the weekend.  We usually like to stay at the PHX airport Hilton since most of the time one of us is flying out somewhere. This time, since we were in town for an event, we elected to stay closer to the city. Bad choice. My boyfriend has been an Hilton Honors member for years and stayed in Hiltons all over the world. He said that this hotel has been the worst in terms of service.\n\nWe got there late Friday night and faced surly staff who mocked us when we asked about parking.  My boyfriend went to park, and I tried to begin the check-in process, but since the reservation was in his name they said they couldn't check us in without him being present. Fine, but by the time he got back (all of 5 minutes), the staff had scattered, and we wound up waiting for another 15 minutes just to get someone to get our key. (The front desk phone had also rung for about 5 minutes with no answer while we were standing there).\n\nWe finally got our key and got up to the top floor where we were staying.  The hotel has a great view with the open atrium, but the top floor was quite warm compared to the rest of the hotel.  I'd suggest a lower room, especially in the summer.  Unfortunately our room key didn't work. Twice. Three trips to the front desk later we finally got the manager to issue a working key. (The first time I went down, but since the reservation wasn't under my name they wouldn't give me a replacement key even thought I had just been down there 5 MINUTES EARLIER checking in.  Also, they have handy phones each floor next to the elevators, but apparently none of the 3 staff members standing chatting at the desk could come up to give us our third key of the night, even after they couldn't manage to get two working ones.)\n\nBy the time we finally got in our room, we were too tired to mention the sticky bathroom floor (it looked like someone had spilled a drink of some sort across it and it wasn't cleaned up) or the lightbulb out in the bathroom.  Our second stay we had a great room, but more poor service as we asked them to call us a cab to take us to our dinner reservations, but after 30 minutes (the last 15 standing in front of the hotel after they told us the cab would be there 'any minute') found out they'd 'forgotten' to call it in. Their shuttle would have taken us there, but they never mentioned it. Their bar/restaurant also closes quite early most nights since they shut it down if it is slow, so don't trust the hours they have posted.\n\nThat being said we did have a lovely experience with their buffet staff going out of their way to help us. The manager there as well as one of their servers not only bent over backwards to get us food and drink (even right at the end of the buffet), but got us brochures and discount coupons for area attractions they thought we'd enjoy.  5 stars for them and 0 for the night staff.

Good greeting she educated me on the package my husband had bought as I checked us in while he was parking the car. After I checkled in  I looked for someone to help me with our bags. Again no one there to help. So With a luggage cart in hand I found the elivator....ok so now you are telling me there is not even someone to help me get this thing to the 8th floor . When I got to the room they key card  that i was given didn't even unlock the door. So that meant toting the same bulky luggage cart back to the elevator back down stairs though the lobby. While 8 months pregnant mind u. I had it. I called my husband he came up to the room and went down stairs to get a new card. I checked out the room nothing extraordinary.  But I was jus ready to relax except I found old french fries in the couch and a dead fly on the bed....we will not be returning to the hilton.  For 200$. This has been a craptastic experience.

Now we all know we pay more for everything at AJ's, but it's often worth it for the service and the quality, especially when it comes to specialty items. Not anymore.  I had to return the fruit because my friend was unexpectedly called out of the country.

Not only was it embarrassing, it was time wasting, and really..do that many people try to sneak in and return Dragon Fruit from somewhere else?\nI did go home, combed through the trash, found the receipt, brought it back and returned it to the manager.

I ended up getting a large Pepperoni with black olives, and a chopped antipasto salad. It turned out the be a great choice. The pizza was great.

Love, love, love their chewy crust, excellent sauce, and high-quality ingredients!

Even from down the road you can smell the aroma of garlic and freshly baked pizza and I lamented the fact that there was nothing on the menu that was within my diet. Fast forward 5 years and they now have a gluten free pizza menu as well as several appetizers available for those with Celiac of gluten sensitivity.\n\nFor starters, they offer a gluten free version of bruschetta as well as a spinach and artichoke dip that will nearly have you licking the plate. The spin-dip was by far my favorite, boasting just enough vegetables to make you think you're eating health food, but with a hearty helping of cheese to remind you that you're actually indulging. We also ordered up a batch of their gluten free honey BBQ wings and my 3 year old couldn't get enough of those, shrieking excitedly every time she licked the sweet sauce. Be sure to specify when you order wings that you need them prepared gluten free; they have a separate preparation process for gluten free wings to help reduce any possibility of cross contamination.\n\nLet's talk pizza: I've been eating a lot of it the last few years since more and more restaurants are now serving it. My main concern with many pizza places that sell gluten free is that they serve the crust, but don't know squat about proper preparation techniques. Jimmy, the General Manager at the Camelback and 3rd St. location, gave me a tour of the kitchen on my recent visit. He showed me their gluten free preparation area, the separate tray and utensil storage area, and their cooler to show me that they follow recommended techniques to reduce the risk of cross contamination. Additionally, they use separate ingredients, racks, plates, gloves, and utensils to do their best to serve the Celiac and gluten free community. All locations have been trained on safe handling methods by Lynn Rae Ries of Gluten Free Creations, who also supplies their gluten free products.\n\nWe ordered 2 pizzas, both were 10 inch \"personal\" pizzas, but you could easily split one with a friend if you started with an appetizer. All ingredients tasted very fresh and the crust had a great texture, which is one of the hardest things to get right in the gluten free world. I personally like a combo of black olives, salami, and spinach, which won't break the bank at around $15. My husband opted for a garlic chicken, peppers, and mushroom pizza, which was tasty as well. They will even deliver and offer catering of their gluten free items for the big game or an office party.\n\nThe atmosphere reminds me a lot of a pizza place in Boston my mom used to take me - the kind of place that you would go celebrate winning a soccer match with your team, go on a casual first date, or take the family out for Sunday lunch. After dark, the lights go down and the candles come out while their patio lights up with fairy lights.\n\nThe only thing I could suggest for Streets of New York is to add some gluten free offerings to the dessert menu (I'm a sucker for chocolate) and to add a gluten free beer or cider option to the drink menu. Overall, it was a great dining experience and I'm sure that my family will be back soon!\n\nCheck out my gluten free blog too: www.GlutenFreeAZ.com", "business_id": "JN2qXIuDXnV2d8WnSqd28A", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-03-18", "type": "review"}

One waitress around 12pm and she was awesome!!!! 1 large pizza, suicide wings, hot pastrami, order of fries and 3 drinks. $55! Say what! GREAT DEAL! she was great and we tipped accordingly.

This place just secretes the undeserved smug vibe. Besides the hipster crew, get ready to meet the world traveler who is yakking it up about his travels across the American Southwest and how he pities America right now... or the overwhelmed Scottsdale mom with the 2 bratty kids, but she's completely ignoring them. You certainly see a melody of personalities at Pane Bianco. \n\nWhile I certainly never judge a place by it's appearance or it's customer base (I love holes in the wall), there was just something about Pane Bianco that rubbed me the wrong way... and it got a little more interesting when I ordered my meal.\n\nI ordered the Tuna sandwich, which comes with red onion, Gaeta olives, lemon and arugula. This all comes on what I believe is ciabatta bread, but I'm not sure. I asked the lady behind the counter if I could sub out the olives for the roasted peppers. Her answer was simply \"No\".... In my mind my first thought was \"okay, maybe a place like this doesn't do substitutions\", which I understood. She told me that they won't put the peppers on the tuna because it wouldn't work with the sandwich. I was shocked... so I asked her nicely to please ask someone if they could do it. After waiting around for awhile, I went to pay for my meal. As my sandwich was being wrapped, she said yes they could do it, but for some large fee (I believe 2.50 or 3 dollars, remind you this is an 8 dollar sandwich). By this time I was pretty worn out of the whole experience of Pane Bianco that I just said no thanks and went to eat my sandwich. Thanks, but a little too late.\n\nGranted the sandwich was pretty good, and the tuna was very fresh. I just couldn't believe that someone would tell me that I couldn't get something on the menu put on my sandwich... for the reason that she didn't believe they went together. \n\nI spent much of my childhood in South Philadelphia living on homestyle Italian... and tuna and peppers definitely do go together...\n\nIn summary, I will try Pane Bianco again, and will most likely update my review based off of the service I receive. The sandwich was very good, and is the main reason I will go back. Hopefully I have a different experience.", "business_id": "-AAig9FG0s8gYE4f8GfowQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-05-22", "type": "review"}

I went to pizzeria bianco this past week and bar bianco, so when we headed out to try Lux this morning, I figured, why not wait around and try Pane Bianco too. So that's what the BF and I did. Right when the restaurant opened I went in intending to only order one sandwich for the BF and I to share, but once inside, I saw they had a special focaccia and decided to get that too so we could have a more broad idea of what the food is like at this place. Both the sandwich and focaccia had mozz, basil, and tomato. So I went up and ordered and the man taking the orders was less than super friendly, but I can understand that for a place trying to be fast that is also super busy. Then I stepped to the side to pay with some other guy, who was actually pretty nice. After that, you have to sit around and wait for your food.... this is kind of awkward because the space is very small and warm and there are products all around so no matter where I stood I felt like I was in someone's way. Finally, they called my name and I got a little paper bag with my food in it and went to sit outside. The BF and I started by splitting the sandwich. Ok, so the sandwich was alright, I liked how the ingredients tasted fresh and the bread was very good, but it really could use something to make it a little more interesting. If they were to drizzle a little bit of aged balsamic on the sandwich, it would be delicious and I would want to come back for it all the time. As is.... I thought it was a little boring and would be kind of easy to make at home, so why would I come here for it? So after we finished that, we moved on to the focaccia. \n\nNow this was a different story. The focaccia was really good. It's like a corner slice of a square pizza almost. It had the same ingredients as the sandwich, but somehow tasted way better. I guess it's the melted cheese, the type of bread, and the fact that there was clearly olive oil on it that helped it be so much more flavorful. This was close to as good as the pizza was that we got at pizzeria bianco the other day. So, that made me happy and it only cost $4.50, so that made me even happier. I would be much more likely to come here than to wait three hours for the other. \n\nSo why does this place get 3 stars and the other get 4? I thought the selection here was very limited, which is fine if it helps them put out more quality food, but man, there's not a lot of choice. Also, the service was much better at the pizzeria. Finally, the appetizers at the pizzeria were freakin amazing and nothing I got today was amazing. HOWEVER I would probably come here again before going back to the pizzeria due to wait time.\n\nPS I didn't get a sweet!

The bike rack out front, for the latest hipster's recently purchased 10-speed, is a nice addition to the patio seating however, the food served could have used about a $3.00-$4.00 discount in pricing.  \n\nI was with a group of eight people, of whom i am out to eat lunch with on weekdays and weekends and, all of us had never been to Pane Bianco.  I ordered the Tuna Sandwich, while others in our group ordered the Mozzarella Sandwich.  We all agreed that the the food was somewhat tasty however, it certainly didn't match the pricing or even the over-self-assured staff.  The decor inside seemed nice however, out of place in Phoenix, AZ, as it was resembling a Kansas-Linen look, with a hollow and ghost-like feeling of emptiness, no matter how many people were there.  \n\nI wouldn't recommend Pane Bianco to those who care about a good ratio of the quality and price of the food, unless you have a $10.00 and $5.00 bill burning out of your purse or pocket, and are equipped with an equally snobby attitude, a thick un-Phoenix-like beard or, can still fit into your size 2 skinny jeans and Jackie-O sunglasses.

The ambiance is great- kind of rustic Italian chic with low and high tables, a bar, and a takeout area next door.  The service was fantastic.  It took maybe 3 minutes to get our food, although sandwiches and salads aren't too taxing to make, and it wasn't crowded.  Still, it was noted and much appreciated.  I got the Caprese salad.  I debated between that and the sandwich, but finally decided on the salad because it did come with bread (which I definitely wanted to try, it being PANE Bianco, but sometimes sandwiches are just too bready).  I spent 2 weeks a couple of years ago literally eating my way through Italy on Caprese salads, and this was as good as many and better than some.  The tomatoes were red ripe and tasty.  The mozzarella was fresh, and it had just the right amount of basil, olive oil, and salt and pepper.  Yum- thinking about it now makes me hungry all over again.  The bread was as expected, fresh and crusty.  I also got the pickled vegetables, which were good and interesting.  It was a plate of baby carrots, onions, cauliflower, and peas pickled in what seemed to be apple cider vinegar, so they were sweet and sour at the same time.  Sweet Pea got the Soppresata sandwich, which came with the chile Soppreseta today (which was great, as we are both notorious spicy hounds), and he really enjoyed it.  It also came with sort of a saucy cold bean salad, I think they were lima or fava beans, which he didn't like but I LOVED.  I ate all of his too.  They serve Mexican sodas but aren't too precious about it- always appreciated.  We will definitely be going back, and I will go by the takeout for a loaf of bread when I'm having a party.  Good to know there is a good bread bakery around!", "business_id": "-AAig9FG0s8gYE4f8GfowQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-05-10", "type": "review"}

In the end, I settled on three though its probably closer to 3.5 stars.  There's plenty to like about this spot, though I wouldn't say it has the wow factor.  Though in the interest of full disclosure you should know that Pizzeria Bianco doesn't have a wow factor for me either.  If you're a big Pizzeria Bianco fan, you'll probably love this place.  If you're sorta meh about Pizzeria Bianco as I am, you'll probably have some of the same gripes as I do about Pane.\n\nI've been to Pizzeria Bianco a number of times, but I've never tried Pane despite driving past it thousands of times over the years.  Finally on a Wednesday mid afternoon I made the journey here.  My timing was perfect as I arrived right in between the end of the lunch rush and prior to the dinner brigade.  However despite my good timing, finding a parking spot was still a chore as I had to park about two blocks away.  I couldn't even imagine how brutal parking would be when its busy (especially since Lux, another wildly popular establishment, is right next door).  I got a little confused walking inside as you've got two entrances.  The left door gets you into the restaurant while the right door gets you to the take out counter.  You guessed it, walked into the wrong door.  No matter, as I detoured straight to the bar area.\n\nThe aesthetics here are somewhat hard to describe, though the numerous Yelp photos of the interior pretty much paint an accurate picture.  A small place with a hipster vibe, though perhaps with a hint of elegance in the decor.  Not unlike the setup you'd find at Chris Bianco's other establishments, though I'd say this one is a little more laid back.  The bar area is pretty small, though they had a decent number of craft beers and wines to choose from.  They also feature a number of daily dish specials in addition to the regular menu they advertise (including a number of dessert options).\n\nFor starters I went with the Four Peaks Sunbru for my beverage of choice as it was on tap for the day.  For my main dish, it seemed like the Sopressata sandwich with provolone and red peppers is a huge hit based on Yelper reviews so I went with that.  The sandwich comes with what I suppose is a side salad, though its so small it could basically be a garnish.  First off, no complaints about the foccacia bread.  Cooked perfectly for the right amount of crunch while soft on the inside.  But the sandwich itself was a little disappointing to be honest.  The seasoning of the red peppers was such that it basically overpowered the texture of the meat and the cheese, to the point where the red pepper was pretty much all I could taste.  Perhaps swapping provolone for mozzarella would've mellowed out the red peppers just enough to balance it out.  The portion size was about right and the side salad (what little there was) was good so the dish wasn't a total disappointment.  For dessert, I asked for a piece of their tres leches cake, but they had just run out.  So instead I went with their flourless chocolate cake (which I've had before at Pizzeria Bianco).  Just as I expected, it was outstanding.  Super moist and decadent with a light vanilla creme sauce as an accompaniment.  Every bit as good as the one they serve at Pizzeria Bianco and a perfect cap on any meal.\n\nTotal cost for the beer, sandwich, cake, tax and tip came to about $28.  Pretty pricey (especially the sandwich), though to Chris Bianco's credit he and his staff do take great pains to source their ingredients locally which I appreciate.  Still, the markup seems a little steep.  Much like Sam Fox, Chris Bianco's strong brand identity probably drives the prices higher.  So like I said, if you think everything Chris Bianco touches turns to gold, you'll love this place.  And better still, they also serve Chris's famous pizzas at Pane as well.  I'd come back if asked by a friend or family member, but overall I feel like Chris Bianco's original pizzeria in Heritage Square is still a preferable experience to his CenPho concept.", "business_id": "-AAig9FG0s8gYE4f8GfowQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-04-01", "type": "review"}

We finally stopped by one day after a lovely little trip on the lightrail.\n\nThe entrance is a little confusing being on the south side of the building.  I guess this is because I am used to entrances being in the fronts of buildings as opposed to on the side.  When you walk in, you see everything you expect.  A couple pool tables, dingy floors, a seedy looking bar, and tables and chairs scattered about.  There are a decent amount of booths as well.  One thing that I noticed and considered a bit odd was the fact that a third of the restaurant seemed to be sort of partitioned off for the \"fancy\" dining area.  I don't know if that is the case, but it definitely looked that way.  When it comes down to it, this place is a classically tacky pub type restaurant, and I like it.\n\nUnfortunately, the food is not so great.  Neither is the bitchy service you get when you come in.  A half smile would be a welcome gesture instead of a perfect view of my server skulking in the kitchen.  I'm not sure what was up with that.  Maybe PMS.  The husband ordered the bangers and mash and I got the cornish pastie.  The husband mentioned that he had to add a lot of salt to his gravy, but he seemed to enjoy his meal.  Me on the other hand, not so much.  My gigantic pile of peas that kept rolling of my plate were cold and had a few hairs in them.  They definitely weren't mine, I checked.  The pastie was delicious, and I really liked it, but the accompanying mashed potatoes were too thick and lumpy to be any good.\n\nThis place just isn't good enough.  Hair in food is just plain gross.  Mediocre food combined with rude service is not going to get me to come back.  Besides, I am sick and tired of hearing the owner of this place bitch and moan about the lightrail being a detriment to his business.  I don't know how you can say that when the place is packed on a Sunday afternoon with no sporting events going on.", "business_id": "3xEB9FyFXolq1b_Qn_BFtg", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-03-04", "type": "review"}

It was by the grace of a good friend that I stopped off for a happy hour special at a Midtown drinkery. That's all it took to get me hooked on the idea of stopping off for a drink after a hard day's work. And the proximity of George & Dragon to the light rail launched what is my current obsession.\n\nWith good intentions, I stopped at G&D yesterday for an Irish Car Bomb and a Guinness, and to get some food to take home and watch a movie. At 5:15 there was hardly anybody there, but I suppose most people are commuting at that time. I overheard another patron ask about their \"Slay The Dragon\" program. Participants, it so happens, are given a card with all of the restaurant's beer listed. The steady drinker consumes one of each (there are 66 different beers!!) within a month and is awarded with an \"I Slayed the Dragon\" t-shirt. What a sweet concept! ***\n\nThe steak and kidney pie was also a nice treat, with that certain crispness of the kidney strong but not overpowering. In the past, I've also gotten the fish and chips (FanTasTic!), bangers and mash (excellent) and the wings (very good).\n\n\n\n*** I think it would be swell if we organized a daily UYE to help each other through this beer challenge.

The beer selection is great.  The crowd is diverse.  Good music, lots of sports on the TV, etc.\n\nOn the flip side:\n\nThe staff has good intentions, but is not well trained.  They do the job, but don't anticipate - you have to ask.  They don't seem empowered.  We ordered some happy hour food at 6:55, for example, and they said it was over.  It wasn't 7, but they explained the \"computers\" made the call.  This wasn't something we brought up at 10 p.m. - but before it was 7!   A guy next to us ordered food to go and sat there for 40 minutes.  He kept asking and the response was \"it wasn't up\" but then he got mad and it magically appeared all boxed and ready.  Bottom line:  service is o.k. for a bar, but the food thing seems to flummox them.\n\nThe menu covers a wide range of bases, but also is a series of hits and misses.  We went one weekend for the Sunday Roast.  It was a generous plate of veggies, mash and a massive yorkshire pud.  But the beef wasn't roast anything... more like steak-ums.  The gravy was from a can/jar.   Now some might say this is trivial, but a good Sunday Roast Beef meal to the English is like a Thanksgiving dinner in the US.  You can't serve shaved turkey from a frozen bag and surround it with good sides... the main dish needs to be lovingly prepared.\n\nOn another night, the Scotch eggs followed the same theme.  A great idea.  The dish was served with a wide range of extras, but the core food was odd.  Not bad, but the casing was an inch thick and dry.\n\nI'd love to see this place work.  They offer a menu of what should be made, but just don't quite deliver a good food product.

I don't inflict my terrible singing on others, but I did enjoy most of the other people singing.\n\nI played a couple games of pool on 1 of the 2 tables while waiting for my food.\n\nThe main bartender was not a pleasant person.

I also saw the general manager chilling outside.\n\nCall me a cheap ass but I feel like I paid too much for fish & chips. Came out to $14.02. I expected to pay $10ish. I know it's market price & all but that still sucked. I should have asked the price before ordering.\n\nThe fish & chips were really good though. I could barely finish the 2 thick pieces of fish on my plate. They were perfectly crispy with just the right amount of batter. Chips could have been crispier though.\n\nI LOVE THE COLESLAW! I can't say that enough. It wasn't sweet (yuck!) like other coleslaws I've tried. It was crisp & peppery. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.

Today I was in the mood to drink German despite being in a British pub so I opted to drink Spaten.  \n\nFor lunch I ordered the Shepherds Pie and it was amazing.  It's the third different shepherds pie I've had in metro Phoenix and it might be the best one.\n\nMy team lost an ugly one and it spoiled my day a bit but I was happy to have made my first visit to George & Dragon.  It will not be my last.  With easy access to light rail I plan on being back soon.  Cheers!", "business_id": "3xEB9FyFXolq1b_Qn_BFtg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-04-17", "type": "review"}

The location is great, far enough out of downtown to avoid the clutter and close enough to have train access and feel like you're in a more urban area. Big family style benches allow for friend-making outside and individual tables inside. I'm surprised I came back after the first time. On a busier night, we couldn't get service to save our lives. We made sure we weren't stepping on toes by seating ourselves and sat, staring at servers running AROUND us for 15 minutes before going to the bar and begrudgingly ordering a beer from there instead. We sat and tried to shake it off while drinking one of many draft choices and waited, trying to make any contact with a server so we could get a menu or so I could merely ask where the bathroom was at-but nothing. I even timed how long it would take to get any attention without waving my arms around and after 10 more minutes we gave up. Apparently we were also given up on because the only interaction we had was the server rudely ripping our drink menu off the table without a word! That being the last straw, our feelings a little hurt, and trying to dial down why we felt like we were refused service, we left half full beers and walked out upset. I still over analyze the situation and try and figure out what in the hell we did wrong! \nNow, we came back to meet with friends almost a year later and service was slightly more decent. For mediocre bar food and bare minimum service that I usually have to flag down or jump straight to the bar for. I don't see all the hype in my own personal experience and that totally bums me out given that I like the atmosphere and location so much and so do many of my friends/coworkers.

Unfortunately it was a huge let down. The first bad sign was that upon walking in every table table that wasn't occupied had not been cleared from the previous diners. During the 1 1/2 hrs (!!!) that we were here there were several tables that NEVER got cleared. It took 20 minutes to get our drinks and another 45+ minutes until we received our food which was strange as no one else in the restaurant seemed to be ordering any food. There was a hair in the fish and chips (disgusting but mistakes happen), and the rest of the food was sub par at best. \n\nHaving lived half my life in England  I've been to plenty of pubs and also eaten plenty of mediocre pub food (none to my recollection as tasteless as this). However I would imagine that if you're trying to emulate a British Pub across the pond you would only want to bring over the best of the best, not the worst of the worst. Even the sad little mini frozen sausage rolls I had as a child were better. I'm a bit horrified that this is the \"taste of England\" that is being imposed on unsuspecting Arizonians who don't know any better. \n\nI guess if you're just looking to knock back a pint or two and play pool and would only ever order food under the most drunk and dire of circumstances then you may enjoy this version of a pub. There certainly were a lot of regulars (not ordering food...). \n\nP.S. I don't know if that greasy little man was a busser or a patron. If he was a patron he had no business going into the kitchen as many times as he did, or eating on the floor. If he was a busser then it would have been nice to see him clear more than one table he did.

Nothing like having a cold one and a scotch while watching Central go by and hearing the random serenade of the light rail as it cruises.\nThe crowd is lively and animated. You can always find yourself in a conversation and the people are eclectic.\nThe staff is one of the most solid in town. They remember you and what you drink, they smile and are attentive and are good at keeping you drinking. If you show up and go straight to the patio, I suggest letting someone know you've arrived. Otherwise you might wait for a bit before you're noticed. The owner is often seen having a pint or laughing and joking with the patrons which I see as excellent form. Plus, he's a damn funny bastard.\nThe beers miiiiiight be a little over priced but you can get a domestic bottle on the cheap if it suits you.\nNow, the food... PHENOMENAL. Surprisingly good!!! Best bangers & mash in town (quality of the sausage is exemplary). Fish n' chips is superb. The stuffed meatloaf is legendary. LOVE the cornish pastie. Honestly haven't had a single disappointment and I've traversed the menu a few times over.\nAll in all, I love this place. The ladies that drink here might not always be aplenty nor top quality (aside from the staff) and an import draft will cost ya but it's my base now and I'm at home when I'm here.

I got off work pretty late and wanted to have something to eat along with a beer or two. I saw some nearby Mexican spot but, I walked by and it didn't seem very welcoming or happening. I found this spot and thought I would just check it out. \n\nNow first appearances can be deceiving, the place seems kinda seedy and definitely divey. You can definitely tell that regulars are a staple here. \n\nI was crazy hungry and discovered they serve food until 1 am everyday... Kinda risky at a lot of places because kitchen staff usually falls off in quality around 11-12pm in most places that look like this. \n\nI ordered a BLT and I have to say it was pretty damn good for the time I ordered. Bacon was crispy and the tomatoes and lettuce didn't taste old. Soooo gooood! Definitely hit the spot.\n\nSuper surprised and glad I wandered in to here as it doesn't seem like there is too many options in this area around the late time I showed up. Next time I am in the area, I will definitely be back. Compliments to the kitchen and bar tenders for holding it down. You know its good when you hear a bar tender mention she watches Bar Rescue.

Had a beer and the Shepard's Pie as described on the menu.  On the menu the shepherds pie was listed at $10.99 along with a full description: marinated  lean ground beef, mashed potatoes, Sharp cheddar and gravy on request. Pretty simple one would think.   When the bill came I noticed that the shepherds pie was charged at $12. So I asked the waitress. Her response was \"well you ordered cheese and gravy and that's a dollar extra\".  I asked to see the menu again and pointed out that on the menu it's shows that this is part of the dish and says nothing about cheese and gravy being extra. In essence it was part of the meal.  She wouldn't budge I asked to see the manager.  After about 10 minutes of hearing \"we can't find the manager\" or \"the managers not here.\"  A guy comes up and says \"can I help you?\"  I explain the entire situation one more time.   He pulls the menu out, reads it, and then states \"no cheese and gravy or extra it says it right here.\" I asked him to please show me where on the menu it said it.  He looks at it again thinking, furling his eyebrow and says well !I guess I can see how somebody would get that confused.\"  Clearly the menu did not state that. Unlike the cheeseburger where it clearly states cheese extra onions are extra. I commented that his menu was misleading and he's taking advantage of people. He reached in his pocket, Took out a dollar and slammed it on the table. He walked away no apology no \"thank you for your business.\"  \n\nI would suggest if you're not familiar with this business or it's business practices, you watch your bill very carefully.  the food wasn't bad, the service was so-so, but the management stinks!", "business_id": "3xEB9FyFXolq1b_Qn_BFtg", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-05-13", "type": "review"}

As usual, I'll do my good and bad points.\n\nGood/great/amazing\n- The service here is top-notch. If you've ever been somewhere where they don't pay attention to you, this is the opposite. Every ten minutes someone was asking me if I wanted something to drink (such as wine), a hand massage, or something to read. At one point my stylist even offered to get me something from AJ's because I mentioned I was hungry.\n- Hair/facial\nI went here to get a haircut, highlights, and a facial. The facial took nearly an hour and she really went to town on my face. Liz, the one who worked on my face, knew my problem areas even before I mentioned them. For the frugal yelpers out there (I'm one of them) there isn't too much pressure to get any of the products they use. At least, it's not annoying enough for you to say \"Ugh, stop!\" but just enough to get you to think. I did get one of the recommended face products and it really does work (even on my more oily than texas skin).\n\nMy stylist was a nice lady whose name begins with the eighth letter of the alphabet (should you want to go to her). When I got there, my hair was two-toned and very boring without any style. I spoke to her about what I wanted and nearly three hours later (and one other visit to add a few more highlights) she had turned my sad sally hair into something that I actually want to comb and style everyday. I will go back to her as often as I can mostly because my hair finally looks great.\n\nThe not so great:\nPricey? Yes. If you're a poor grad student like me, it will be expensive. \n\nOverall: This salon is great. It is a bit pricey so I can't go back every six weeks since that would require cutting my grocery budget and/or driving. Service is amazing, they really pay attention to you, and they will leave you with great hair. My stylist really was wonderful. \n\nBonus: I forgot their 100% guarantee.

My first class was on a Sat at 2pm. The 2pm weekend classes tend to be slowest and apparently the midday classes during the week. I wouldn't know about midday during the week since I work a normal 9-5 job but that was what the instructor told me. I have also gone to their mid-week 7pm classes that tend to be very busy. But, I don't feel this hindered me at all. The classes are 90 minutes and apparently you can burn 800-1200 calories during a session. The sessions can be intense but what was really nice was how accepting the instructors are towards beginners. They are more concerned with doing the posture right than how far you can push yourself. They are also okay if you need to sit down as long as you try to stay in the room the whole time.

The 6 am class is a goddess-send when I have to work 10 hour shifts. \n\nThere is a script Bikram has his instructors say for the most part.

I have been practicing yoga for several years and have never been so offended during my yoga practice. While I understand that there is a particular flow for Hatha/Bikram yoga (which I prefer Vinyasa Flow), I always try to push myself a little farther with what I have learned in my previous practices at different studios. In the middle of class, I attempted a slightly different pose from what was being taught (without interrupting my fellow yogi's) and the teacher called me out in the middle of class saying \"Can you please do the same pose as the rest of the class?\" (in a derogatory tone) I was absolutely offended by his gesture so I rolled up my mat and walked right out of the class. I sincerely apologize to the other yogi's there for walking out in the middle of class and interrupting their practice but he could have been a bit more tactful with his approach. Perhaps pulling me aside after class and letting me know this was not okay with him would have been more appropriate. So rude! Perhaps it was rude of me to assume I can try and progress my yoga style during his class but I always had encouragment from my previous teachers for pushing myself to evolve in my practice.\n\nIn addition, because of the Groupon, the class was extremely packed and there was no room to move or do the poses correctly.  Also, the studio has carpet (which is different than what I am used to) and it is really disgusting! Sweaty, dirty, nasty and probably filled with bacteria. eew!

To have it packed and shipped to Massachussettes was $103. I had very clear instructions to ship the item from the UPS store, using USPS. I had given the clerk my cell phone to copy the address from which she did and everything should have been fine.\nExactly one month later I go to ship just a framed print (same size as the first one). This time I was being charge $118? I asked why this one was costing more than the original shipment which was heavier. I explained what I had shipped previously when the man suddenly remembered that THE PRINT AND CEMENT ITEM I HAD SENT A MONTH AGO WERE STILL THERE! I was told that the address was undeliverable via UPS. We checked the address verified it was correct. I was told they had tried calling me once. They tried calling a number that I never gave them. A number I never heard of, I don't even know where the area code they had is located!\nAfter verifying the information he said he would have it resent the following day. I asked about a refund and was told \"Well I'll have to check, but technically we are still shipping it.\" He then walks off. I stand there waiting and he comes back a few minutes later asking if I needed something else. Yeah! How about a time frame? Is he going to call me, should I call him? This was a big refund I was asking for not a couple bucks I could just forget about. He told me to call him later that week. I called three times and went into the store once and he wasn't there any of the times and no one working there would help me. I finally went in yesterday and he was there. I was third in line and by the time I got to the front there were two more people behind me. He said I would need his \"undevoted\" attention and so he needed to help the other people really quickly since he was the only one there. Well he proceeded to help them as well as the other 5 people that walked in after them while I sat and waited. After waiting for nearly 20 minutes he gave me his \"undevoted\" attention which consisted of taking 30 seconds to give me a tracking number  from something I had previously shipped and then another 30 seconds to tell me that he had checked about the refund and was told no because the information was correct and the address is deliverable. OF COURSE THE ADDRESS WAS CORRECT! And since the address was correct and deliverable, how is it NOT their fault that it was still not delivered a month later? How is it not their fault that they had the wrong number for me? How is it not their fault that they never tried to deliver it to the store I shipped it from which is a block away!

I am a nerdy, middle-aged mom who just wanted a fun bike to ride with my kid.  I don't know from mountain bikes or road bikes.  After calling all over town and looking on the internet, a friend told me about Slippery Pig and how nice and helpful they were.  I called and they had my dream bike in stock, and at more than $100 less than I'd been able to find on the 'net.\n\nWhen I went in to see the bike, the little store was packed with hard-core cycling enthusiasts, talking about races and the virtues of various bike parts I had never heard of.  The lone guy running the store was courteous and took his time with each customer.\n\nDid I mention I know nothing about bikes?  Sometimes I hate going into specialty shops because the \"experts\" there are just socially maladjusted snobs with their little corner of knowledge, and they lord that over you to assert their superiority.  I was a little nervous, because the Pig was definitely a \"real\" bike shop.  But when it was my turn for assistance, my man Eli was nothing but nice.  Maybe the nicest guy ever.\n\nEven though it was past closing, he took his time going over the bike, gave me a beverage, offered me a discount, told me about the three free tune-ups I get for the next year, and gave me 20% off all accessories (because you know you have to trick out the new bike).\n\nWhen I went back a week later to get my basket attached, again at closing time, he remembered my name and seemed genuinely interested in what I thought of my bike.  George attached my basket, and I agree with the previous reviewer: he's great, too.\n\nI went in again last night to get a flat fixed, and this latest experience prompted me to write this review.  Again, I rolled in minutes to closing, and they fixed my flat right away, staying until well after closing.  But while I waited, Eli offered me my choice of delicious microbrews (!) and I sipped a lovely Four Peaks Kiltlifter Scottish Ale while they fixed my flat and attached a new saddle!  Where does that happen anymore?\n\nFor context, I had taken my daughter's bike in to another LBS a year ago, and they took two days to fix the flat.  They were also nice guys, but two days to fix a flat?  (And no beer.  I think I am going to make free beer a prerequisite for service providers from now on.)\n\nThese guys are just the best, and reminded me why it is almost always worth it to seek out small, independent businesses.

I dropped off my newly purchased mountain bike (used) for a tuneup and check of a few problem item's (brakes/leaky fork). \n\nI had some less then stellar experiences with other local bike shops and these guys came highly recommended (plus its in a good location). \n\nI dropped the bike off on Saturday and told that they would be working on it Tuesday, cool with me. The guy who waited on me was super friendly and chatted about the bike for a bit, everything seemed great.\n\nTuesday came and went, Wednesday came and went. No biggie, I was expecting a call on what to do with the fork once they had some more information on it so I was surprised when I finally called on Thursday to check on my bike and was told it was done. I am not sure if it was just finished or it was finished days ago and had just been sitting there and no one called me - again not a huge deal, things are busy, things get missed.\n\nWhen I got there to pick up my bike there seemed to be some confusion on what was done. Apparently they didn't check the rear brake pads, so the guy (not the mechanic  who worked on it) put it up on the stand and checked them there. Pads were fine, one caliper was sticking, I checked the brake feel - just as bad as when I brought it in, basically I have to pull it to grip to get anything and apparently that is the best it can be adjusted? Ok.\n\nApparently no one had called Manitou about my leaky fork either, to his credit, this same guy got on the phone right away to try to get a hold of them. No answer of course, at this point I am glad I am not in a hurry. We came to the conclusion that I should just ride the fork till it dies - fine, gotcha.\n\nI am not feeling great about the experience but again, everyone seems cool and is friendly and I understand things happen sometimes. I figure at least it is tuned as much as it could be.....\n\nLater the next day I am riding it around (first ride). The rear brake is true now which is great, front brake still rubbing some, shifting ok - SLAM. Chain suck. Mis-shifting. Chain suck. Mis-shift.....ugh. I guess this is why people learn to do their own work.\n\nI am not sure exactly was done with my bike the 5 days it was there. I would like to give them the benefit of the doubt, I didn't buy my bike there so I didn't have a relationship established but I was trying to.\n\nI would like to give these guys another shot but it's hard since I feel like I got 1/4 of a tuneup. Some would argue this could easily be a 2 star review, some might say they deserve 4 because I am being too tough. I am pretty easy going and patient and the fact that I am still left with a bike that needs adjustment after dropping $70, I think 3 stars is fair.", "business_id": "42Ai9wcFPE2HZ_aADGXI9Q", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-04-19", "type": "review"}

No problem, they said have it ready in two days.

The brake pads perhaps, they were different, but the tube? I bought one the same day just around the corner. That was disappointing.\n\nNow, they did seem to do a good job overhauling the bike and they only charged me for part of the job since I took it before they could finish.\n\nYet, after 6 weeks of waiting, not receiving one phone call, and some condescending attitudes, I was ready to take my bike back and try another avenue. \n\nIt seems like a cool place, but this was really a bad experience. Two stars for their work, zero for service.\n\n[Edit]\n\nI meant to add this just after I wrote the entry. I had stated above that I understood it may be difficult to find the brake blocks needed for a rod actuated system. This was to give Slippery Pig the benefit of the doubt with regard to why they needed to keep my bike for 6 weeks (and who knows how long it would have taken to get it back had I not walked in there and demanded it back unfinished). \n\nWell, it took me the better part of half an hour to find a place that would ship the brake blocks to me within 3 days using the advanced technique of the Google search engine. \n\nNow, there are two excuses Slippery Pig could use in their defense, they just didn't care, or they are incompetent.

Well, I'm not paying $5,000 for a bike without test-riding it first. So I put my name down to take their demo for a spin.

When I came into the shop, Eric told me that he wasn't going to do it for that price and it didn't matter what his employees quoted me over the phone. He wasn't willing to help at all and his quote was almost double what I was told over the phone. \n\nThe second time I came into this shop was because I needed my fox rear shop sent in for warranty work. I gave him the shock and it was sent in to fox. I was told there would be a 10 day turn around to get it fixed and back at the shop ready for pickup. Fox called the shop and told them my shock was no longer available. I was originally told that it would cost $100 to get it fixed with the warranty through fox. After fox called the shop and told them they didn't have my shock any more, the price went up to $160. I was ok with that considering what a new one costs retail. For some reason when fox called the store, they didn't call fox back and tell them it was ok to fix it and send it to them at them price. One of the employees of the pig even admitted they dropped the ball and would call fox right away and get this resolved. It took 4 weeks from when I dropped the shock off until it got back to the bike shop. When I went in to pick up the shock and pay for it, it now cost $195. Eric again was not willing to help. He told me, \" I'm not going to lose money on this.\" I asked if there was anything he would do for his employees dropping the ball and not returning calls and making this whole process takes weeks longer.

I am not a fan of it in my home nor in restaurants. I can see why old people love this place. \n\nI ordered the taco salad for my lunch. What a disappointment! Almost bad iceberg lettuce, a sprinkling of all other toppings. No beans, so if you want any protein you have to pay $2.00 extra to add chicken. This salad was not worth $8.95. With a $3 iced tea and a 20% added tip to the bill, I got out of there for $14.00. I will pay $14.00 for a weekday lunch, but only if it is a nicer place with top notch service and food. \n\nYesterday I went to the Eggery again with Nico and his Grandma after church. Maybe my mindset was a bit different since we were there for brunch. Same awful decor, but it seemed a bit more charming at 10:30am. \n\nI had the Berry Blintz Crepes which were pretty good.

I self-diagnosed myself with either a brain tumor or an ear infection. I looked up the closest Take Care Clinic, and took a drive down to Central and Osborn.\n\nThe clinic is in the far back corner, near the pharmacy. When you get back there, you have to check in using one of three computers, it is fast and easy. Next, you need to pick up a clipboard and fill out your info, much like you would at a doctor's office. I did my part, and then went and waited. There is not much of a waiting area, it kind of blends into the pharmacy waiting area.\n\nAfter about an hour, the Nurse Practitioner, Tina, called me back. They have a private exam room, fully equipped, exactly like your doctor's office. Tina was VERY kind and warm, and took her time asking lots of questions. If you are unfamiliar with Nurse Practitioners, allow me to tell you how much they rock. To become a NP, you must have years of nursing experience, including critical care, ER, etc. After years of experience and education, then one may attend college to earn a NP masters degree. One of the best things about NPs is that they take a holistic approach to patient care. For example, I have a primary care physician, who really, really sucks. When I have an appointment, she LITERALLY brings in a digital timer set for five minutes- and then starts talking. It was amazing to see her press the timer button prior to asking why I was there.\n\nAt Take Care, the NP didn't just check my ears, she did a comprehensive exam, full vitals, etc. Luckily nothing else was going on with me, but I am confident that other issues would have been discovered by Tina.My diagnosis was correct, ear infection, not tumor- which was nice.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend this location, and Tina, as a health care provider. I am seriously going to just stick with that as my primary care, and skip the egg timer doctor who only likes to write scripts for things, not deal with the source of problems.\n\nSome people have noted that the area is sketchy, and with all due respect, that is silly.

I bitched and moaned after calling Sunday and Monday (yesterday) only to not reach ANYONE. Come to find out, they are closed both days and I somehow neglected to see that when I looked up their hours online. Yes, I am an airhead. I do think it is annoying that their voicemail directs you to their website for hours, though. Anyways, one of the girls actually responded to my voicemail and called me back today to schedule an appt. Seriously? Someone actually called back? Major kudos in my book and then they were able to take me in this afternoon/evening which made me very happy. I was almost 15 minutes late to my appt because the address on my gift certificate was their old location so be aware that they are at Central and south of Virginia, NOT closer to Indian School. The girl working on my hair was Miranda. I opted for the shampoo, cut, and style ($60). If I recall correctly, they do a scalp massage with every haircut and Miranda also gave me a hand massage but I don't remember if that is also with the cut or part of the shampoo. I had Miranda trim my hair, clean up my layers and blow-dry my hair straight (I have curly hair). My hair looks amazing and is silky soft. Yes, I could be in a hair commercial right now with my hair bouncing around my face. I thought Miranda was great and we had good conversation. I thought, whoah she could actually be my friend! She must have wooed me with her stylist charms. No, but seriously, this place was very chill, employees seemed happy to work there and very welcoming of the customers. I guess $60 may seem expensive to some but I felt like you got alot for it. I couldn't do this every month but could be persuaded to visit IDE Mania every 3 months. That seems more reasonable right???? What was cool, too, was that they let me use the remaining $5 on the gift certificate towards Miranda's tip so I gave the rest in cash.

Last year I lived across the street from the NW Phoenix VA clinic.  I applied for care there, and was told I could not be seen there.  They were not taking new patients, as they had lost the services of several doctors.  I was told I might try the Phoenix VA Hospital.  I did and was given an appt almost 1 year from my call date.  My needs were not for a cold or a cut finger.  It was for Diabetes and I was told they could not see me sooner and that is how it was.  I felt something was strange with the entire experience.  I had to find private care, and even that was difficult in the area.  I could not retire in Arizona and the lack of health care was a big part of the reason, as I was going to need VA health care as I got older. Diabetes was not magically going away, it needed treatment.    They seemed to have no interest in seeing me.  I could not depend on that, so I have had to make other plans in life. I would not be able to retire in Arizona.    I think that is a shame in itself.  I realize everyone has a different experience, but I gave mine and it is a honest review of what happened to me in 2013.   I was so sorry to hear of the veterans that had died over these delays in care.  It is a disgrace but I am not surprised at all by this behavior in Phoenix.  They obviously are overwhelmed.

Mind you, I don't expect a decor marvel or a hostess so hip it hurts. I know what i'm getting myself into. For the most part.

Anyhoo, we were greeted and seeted promptly by a teenager who definitley just had a smoke and could use a visit to the tanning booth. Once seated, our server, Mo, took our drink and appetizer order and quickly disappeared. For quite awhile. Cue the Jeoporady theme music. Once our iced teas and the new appetizer (tuscan cheese bread extravangza) arrived we sipped and dipped. Not bad.Raspberry tea with an univited yet delighted visit by vanilla and the cheese spread was rich and yummy served with a spot of diced tomato, basi and garlic...aka bruscetta. NICE. We ordered onion chips, like an onion loaf or the blooming onion at Outback....they were good. Two sauces for our dipping pleasure...one your typical ranch, the other a sort of spiced up thousand island with horseradish. Then the entrees arrived. Cue the creepy dum, dum, dum, music...Both NY strip steaks over cooked to such an extreme. The asparagus was limp like, well, let's just say it reminded me of a Vietmanese gymnast I once dated who didn't take the little blue pill. Sides included mashed potatoes (loaded) which means bacon, cheese and sour cream. Ok, Ok, Ok, too much of the extras. What ladle in the kitchen did they pick to put these extras on my mashed potatoes? All in all, I had low expectations at this venue, and they were met. Shout out to Mo the server, a good gal! The clientele was like a scene out of Dawn of the Dead. Sorry. Lesson learned...Applebee's ok some of the time. Get an app and a drink. Skip the entrees. Be nice to a nice server.

Don't understand the high rating this restaurant is getting?!?\n\nI had not been back to this area for 5+ years and wanted to stay near downtown Phoenix where my friend lives. I looked up high-rated Chinese restaurants in downtown Phoenix and China Chili, of course, came out on top. Well folks, you yelpers here are totally fooled!\n\nFirst of all when you sit down, the menu gives the impression that this restaurant is a Szechaun or Hunan restaurant. It's NOT! The chefs at this restaurant are Cantonese serving Szechaun and Hunan dishes.\n\nFor starters, my friend and I ordered Sizzling Rice Soup. As entrees, we ordered Szechaun Shrimp and Braised Tofu with Beef. I had a hint of what was to come by listening to the waitresses... Surprise! They all were speaking in Cantonese!\n\nThe Sizzling Rice Soup was very good. \n\nThe Szechaun Shrimp turned out to be a Sweet and Sour dish...  Shocking! There are almost NO dishes in Szechaun cooking that are Sweet and Sour! It looked nice though, the shrimp was ringed around the plate by thin slices of cucumber. The Braised Tofu with Beef was almost as bad, chemically tenderized beef that probably is used from another dish and dropped in the Braised Tofu. Both dishes were supposed to be HOT... NOT!\n\nThe only redeeming thing we got out of this adventure was that our wallets were not affected that much by the experience!\n\nDemographics of Customers @ 6pm - less than 5% Oriental, 40% of capacity.\n\nIf you want an authentic Szechaun restaurant, travel down to Tempe to Wong's Place on Baseline Road off of I-60.

The dishes we ordered were pretty bland (all needed a generous amount of soy sauce). The one thing I did enjoy were the pot-stickers and the yummy dipping sauce. I ended up pouring that pure yummyness all over my main entree. To tell you the truth, I was hesitant on trying this place again until I took a peek at some reviews and found people had lots of good things to say about the place.\n\nSo i gave it another shot. The atmosphere in this place is like sitting in large asian shoe box, it's one big dining room, yet it's not off-putting. It's strangely welcoming. You feel like your family with everyone else eating there. I went on a Saturday night and I was surprised to see so many old people. I'm all \"this place has to be good if the older crowd is here\". The  psychedelic plastic lighting fixtures cycling through all the colors of the rainbow makes me laugh but I love it. The service is quick and attentive, however when we tried to order a Mountain Dew and Dr. Pepper, the small asian woman had no idea what we were talking about and blurted out something I could not make out. I heard \"Coke\" in the jumble of words and just said \"yes\". They work as a team there which makes for some speedy service. We ordered a few appetizers: Pot-Stickers and Crab  Puffs. The Pot Stickers were good but the Crab Puffs were not. The inside lacked any crab at all and had a runny constancy that quite frankly, surprised me. Eww. Avoid these. I remember reading a review from Alexander C. suggesting the Orange Chicken. What a great choice! The dish made up for the runny crab puffs. The meat was top notch; moist with no grizzly chunks like a lot of places have. The sauce was bursting with flavor and had just the right amount of heat to it. I highly recommend this dish.\n\nChina Chili...glad I gave it another shot :)", "business_id": "-3WVw1TNQbPBzaKCaQQ1AQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-05-19", "type": "review"}

The people watching here is great.  The customers represent a broad range of Phoenix residents and there are usually a few gay peeps in the house, which is always a bonus.  \n\nThe decor at China Chili really improved when they moved from Central Avenue due to the Light Rail.

The enlarged dining room can now accommodate a crowd, which has really cut down from the long waits at their previous location that was so much smaller. \n\nBesides table service and take out, China Chili also caters.  The BF and I recently used them for our Tacky Tiki Gay Pride Brunch.  Johnny handles the catering and he's great to work with.  We asked Johnny to create an appetizer buffet, which was something China Chili had not done before.  They did a great job building a custom menu for us and the food was great.

Every time I have been here, it is the exact same thing.  The service is quick and attentive, the food is fantastic and brought out freakishly fast, and the meal is always fairly cheap.  Funny thing is, I used to be afraid of this place because of the name.  The husband always wanted to try it, but I said it sounded creepy.  As a side note, I am not a fan of spicy foods.  I have since come to realize I really like Asian spicy, I do not like Mexican spicy.  So I'm a food racist.\n\nOur first time here we ordered the orange chicken and the lemon chicken.  The orange chicken was nice and crispy, with the chicken being super juicy.  The orange sauce was amazing.  It was subtly spicy at first, and then the heat just built up from there.  We still order this every time.  The lemon chicken is nice.  A light sauce that doesn't overpower the chicken.  Another good bet.\n\nSince then we have tried many other dishes, the Almond Cashew Chicken, Sweet and Sour Chicken, Moo Shu Pork, and the Honey Walnut Prawns.  Holy Crap!  You have never tasted how good prawns can be until you eat the Honey Walnut Prawns.  The lovely little crustaceans are served on a bed of shredded cabbage.  They are smothered in a sweet and tangy mayo sauce (I know it sounds kind of gross, but trust me and try it).  Then sprinkled all over the top are this wickedly good honey glazed walnuts.

I saw this mentioned in an earlier review and the name made my eyebrows go up.  \n\nAll the good reviews and the 2 minute distance from work made me give the place a try.  Glad I did.\n\nFirst time in, I got the Pillow Chicken and the Boiled Won Tons.  Wow.  It has been quite some time since I've sat down to a meal and said 'wow'.  The Pillow Chicken was a new experience for me.  Stuff (chicken, onions, and some other good stuff) is breaded and fried in little 'pillows', then smothered in this black-pepper sauce.  The smell was one of the best experiences my nose has ever had.  And the taste was as good as the smell.  Garlicy and peppery and yummyery.  I've never had anything quite like that dish.  I will order it again to see if my awesome opinion of it is just tastebud shock.\nThe Boiled Won Tons came like a soup.  I think its just that there is a LOT of sauce, and its subtle enough to be a broth.  Don't know.  All I know is that it was delicious.  Its spicy, but...easy.  That's the word for it.  You feel like a stud for eating so much spicy liquid, but its not going to burn your behind-hole on the way out.  (I know that was in poor taste, oh well)\n\nThese two delicious dishes had me wanting more.  so I went back that same week.  This time, I got the Lemon Chicken after the menu told me it was a 'must try'.  \n\n...For Lemon Chicken lovers, yeah it is.  But if you're not that into it in the first place, their offering will not turn you into a fan.  That just isn't my kind of dish.  No complaints, however.\nThe lunch special did come with a soup, though.  I have no clue what the name of it was, but it didn't agree with my taste buds.  No fault of the soup.  Its just not for me.  For what it was, it was fresh, well made, and hot.  Someone out there probably loves it.\n\nMy rating states \"Yay!  I'm a fan.\"  I am.  I will be going back again and again trying different dishes.  You don't do that a place that you don't trust your taste buds to.  I just need to stick to things that sound good to me...like BBQ Pork Slices and anything with Prawns in it.\n\nThe place itself is nice.  Short on front parking, so go in the back and be careful driving down that narrow alley.  The inside of China Chili is nice and open with plenty chairs and tables...I think there were booths...can't remember.  Its accommodating for large parties...which is what you see mostly at lunch time.  Clean place, too.\n\nThe staff were quick to the draw as most have said in their reviews.  While waiting for my food, I watched them wait tables.  Fast.  On point.  However, I can see how some folks would be annoyed.  Its a matter of preference.  Just keep in mind that the staff mean no harm.\n\nSpeaking of speed, I got my order in under 10 minutes.  That is consistent with what you all have said.  No cold food.  No re-heated food.  None of the issues that could arise with such turnaround time.  Just good hot food served quick.  \n\nI'm so desperate for some good chinese food.  I'm completely Panda Express'd out.  This is right down the street from work and the prices are well...decent.  With tax you're talking like $9 for a lunch special.  Apparently, that's a good price for this part of town.\n\nI just can't get over that Pillow Chicken.

It tasted...well, pedestrian.  Don't get me wrong, It was not nasty at all.  \nI suppose compared to Pillow Chicken, this dish seems like its from a different restaurant altogether. Perhaps I should have cut my teeth on something a little less flamboyant than the Pillow Chicken when I first went here, because each dish I've tried after that has left me disappointed.  \n\nHowever, keep in mind that I've been ordering off of the lunch special menu lately, and those dishes are usually a little less spectacular on anyone's menu.  But I guess that's no excuse, as anything you serve to your customers should be prepared to the utmost.  \n\nAnyway, today's dish, House Special Chicken...  Its described as battered chicken in a spicy garlic sauce.  Its battered and spicy, but not very garlicy.  Still its decent.  A good taste, just not a very eventful taste.  Of note is how tender and delicious the chicken was.  I felt like taking it and putting in a sandwich.\n\nAgain, the soup of the day was the one that I cannot eat.  Don't know what this stuff is...but I guess somebody on this planet must like it.\n\nOh well, I can either hold this place in high regards related to the lone dinner entree I've tried and downgrade it for the few lackluster dishes I've had afterwards...or I can give them a break since most 'lunch combos' are only good enough to fill stomachs at the office and not to wow the tastebuds.  \n\nMeh.

It was egg drop with chicken, which isn't my favorite, but it was ok. We decided to order some potstickers and an order of Hong Kong style noodles with chicken. It took five minutes for them to bring out the food... wow. The potstickers were really good, and the potsticker sauce was a nice balance of savory and sweet. The noodles were also very good. They were crispy, just like I like them. All of the veggies tasted really good, I could taste each veggies' individual flavor. It had snow peas, broccoli, carrots, and celery. It was all really great. So why four stars?

She works in the area and suggested we go to dinner here. \n\nI was extremely pleased with our meal.  We started with Egg Rolls, Pot Stickers and Boiled Won Tons.  The egg rolls were crispy and flavorful, the pot stickers were plump and the filling was delish, but the star for me was the boiled won tons.  I have never had anything like them, They were packed full of meat and served in this savory peanut flavored broth. My sister-in-law was a little wary of trying one, but she did and concurred that they were quite good.  She is not the most adventurous eater so that is really saying something!\n\nFor our main courses we  shared Mongolian Beef, Peking Shrimp, Salt and Pepper Shrimp, and Sichuan Beef.  The Mongolian Beef was tender and seasoned perfectly, The Peking Shrimp had a spicy red sauce the had a little tang to is and was served with snow peas (nice and crunchy not over cooked) and onions.  The salt and pepper shrimp were fried with a nice light batter that was salty but not over done and the jalapeno peppers were just right.  The Sichuan  Beef was my least favorite, I thought the sauce made the batter a little soggy but I really liked that sauce so was still a good dish.\n\nThe portions are huge, I was full after the appetizers as were my dinner companions, so we took a lot of our dinner home, and it tasted great the next day.  Our waitress was very sweet and attentive.  I especially appreciated that she boxed up our leftovers instead of just dropping off some boxes at the table.\n\nFrom the outside the restaurant doesn't really look like much, a sand colored stucco building, but inside it is furnished and decorated nicely, the tables are spaced  so that you don't feel crowded and the lighting was bright but not overly so.\n\nMy only complaint would be that their tofu dishes had meat in them so there weren't as many vegetarian options as I would have like to have seen.  I didn't get a chance to ask if they can adjust them for vegetarians, but will the next time I go and before I take any of my veggie buddies there.", "business_id": "-3WVw1TNQbPBzaKCaQQ1AQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-04-02", "type": "review"}

It's really quite good, certainly the best Chinese I've had since I left San Francisco. \n\nD\u00e9cor usually isn't an important part of the experience for me but China Chili is quite attractive inside, it looks small from the outside but was quite spacious inside. Despite being one very large room it was possible to have a quiet conversation. The lighting is quite relaxing without being dim,  and the d\u00e9cor traditional Chinese.\n\nWe had Hot & Sour soup, and were asked if we wanted it spicy; we did; it was. Really quite excellent, among the best Hot & Sour I've had. Very rich and full, I was surprised at the shrimp and chicken, which were perfect in texture and taste; the veggies were just the right crispness, the broth was spicy but not too hot, and all in all I really recommend this soup; my companion said it was his favorite part of the meal. He's from rural North Carolina and had never had it before, nor much Chinese. As for me, I'd come back for more.\n\nNext up the Kung Pao Chicken was little disappointing, in that it had too little chicken, too much okra. But it's a minor point, the flavor was delicate and pleasant, the mix of other vegetables offset the okra and what chicken there was, was nice. Unfortunately it was not very spicy, especially after the soup, and so if you order it I suggest you ask for it to be extra spicy. But still a pretty decent dish.\n\nMy personal favorite of the meal was the Prawns in Lobster Sauce with black beans. Perhaps a little salty but the flavors overall were delicate, the prawns large, tender, and juicy and no hint of greasiness.\n\nLast we had house special fried rice which was excellent, very fluffy and well seasoned, with beef, chicken, scallops and shrimp. Quite gingery which I like. \n\nAll in all, while it's not up with the very best Chinese cuisine in San Francisco, the food and service were more than acceptable, prompt, unobtrusive, helpful and the price very reasonable, $40 for four dishes and sodas including tax; and the portions were more than generous, we took home more food than we ate (by intention). The Soup alone could have been half the meal...\n\nIf you're in Phoenix and you want Chinese, you couldn't go far wrong by choosing China Chile.", "business_id": "-3WVw1TNQbPBzaKCaQQ1AQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-04-06", "type": "review"}

The place did not disappoint.  It is clean, spacious, and nicer than some of the other Chinese food dives that we love to frequent.  The service was fast and attentive.  \n\nWe ordered the following: West Lake soup, honey walnut prawns, beef chow fun (dry), sesame chicken, mongolian beef, house fried rice, garlic green beans with tofu and Peking pork chop.  Our favorite restaurant is Hong Kong Dining on  24th St and Indian School, but China Chili has some dishes that surpass them.  The West Lake soup was good, not too thick with good flavor.  I thought the garlic green beans were top notch, as were the honey walnut prawns.  Those three dishes I would come back for any day.\n\nThe sesame chicken was ok -- it was sliced chicken with sesame sauce poured over it.  I prefer the more Americanized version where individual pieces of chicken are deep fried in a sesame sauce.  I would say the same of the Peking pork chop -- I prefer the dish made by Hong Kong Dining.  CC's seemed to have too much sauce that was maybe a little too sweet.  \n\nAll in all a gem of a Chinese restaurant that we will definitely frequent when we are on that side of town!", "business_id": "-3WVw1TNQbPBzaKCaQQ1AQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-05-14", "type": "review"}

The dining room is just a big open room and lots of white linens so it's very bright. The food came in a flash and was delish. The shrimps were huge and the batter was almost perfect, slightly mushy, but I liked it. I always ask for extra sauce to mix with the rice and it was a good amount. I'm kind of a stickler about rice, growing up in a half Japanese household. The rice was the best so far although still kind of dry but I can imagine because it's made in copious amounts. I asked the server for a box because I had about 6 shrimp I couldn't finish. The server brought the box  and offered to pack the food for me :). I declined nicely because it was only a couple shrimp.I asked for the check accidentally assuming he would have brought that too. After ten minutes I think he might have forgot, trying to make eye contact with other servers was difficult as they seemed uber focused on other things or not really wanting to help a solo eater such as myself haha.

While I was not blown away, I'll probably order from them again and explore the non-chicken menu items for the reasons below.\n\nWe've gotten take-out from here twice.  I've tried several items (sharing with friends), including sesame chicken, orange chicken, the \"house\" chicken, crab rangoon, and fried rice.  The chicken dishes at this place differ from what you may be used to for Chinese takeout, and the result may be a mixed bag depending on your personal preferences:  typically much less breading and more actual meat (a good thing, right??).  In the dishes I tried, the chicken was prepared the same:  lightly breaded dry white meat served in thin strips.  Unfortunately, the dishes universally had less flavor than what I've typically enjoyed at other places.  In particular, the \"house chicken\", lacked flavor.  It was basically a bunch of lightly breaded, dry, white-meat chicken with a thin/unsatisfying sauce.  Seemed pretty mono-demensional.  The other chicken dishes suffered for many of the same reasons.\n\nThey do the fried rice well with a generous portion of shrimp included.  However, combo dishes are served with white rice only and they will not substitute for fried.  So if you want fried rice, you must pay full price for your combo meal and the additional order of fried rice (around 7-8 bucks for a portion of fried rice).  You end up with a lot of extra white rice, which they will gladly not give you, but won't discount.", "business_id": "-3WVw1TNQbPBzaKCaQQ1AQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-05-11", "type": "review"}

Since moving back to Phoenix, I tend to get movies from the Burton Barr branch of the Phoenix Public Library downtown. I know it's a public library, but it actually has an awesome and extensive collection of foreign films and just about a every title from the Criterion Collection you can feast your cineaste eyeballs on. \n\nAnyway, I was browsing the foreign section and was pretty impressed. It wasn't the usual, pitiful selection most rental places usually have that pretty much is made up of The Seventh Seal, Seven Samurai, maybe a French title, and an overload of pre-Loaded Weapon 4 Jet Li martial arts films. No, sir. While it's not as big as the stock at the downtown library, it's still pretty good and they have alot of recent films.\n\nWhat sold me was when I was wandering around the store. I came across something that I normally haven't found in any video store: Russ Meyer films. If you have never seen \"Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!\", I suggest you scrap any plans you have tonight, break up with your significant other if necessary, go here, and rent it immediately. Buying a copy of a Russ Meyer films is ludicrous process that is both arduous and expensive, but you can just go in here and rent them.\n\nAlong with that, you can find just about any cult film you're looking for and probably find titles you've never heard of or seen, like I did. There's literally a whole wall that's just labeled \"CULT FILMS\". I dropped in here last night for the first time and rented a copy of Russ Meyer's \"Vixen\" and a title that I had seen in Amoeba but never watched called \"A Boy and His Dog\". It's a film about Don Johnson (yes, of Miami Vice) surviving in a post-apocalyptic world with his telepathic dog and fighting off a cult of underground humans led by Jason Robards in clown, drag make-up. Need I say more?\n\nIf you're looking for a hard-to-find title, or even a popular one, drop in here and keep this place alive. When you have an itch for a film right away that can't wait for Netflix, as I do on regular occasions, this spot will be sure to please.\n\nIf you have any taste in film, I repeat....

The clerk said, yes he thought they had some . . . and he disappeared in a back room behind a door . . . and was gone for 5-10 minutes. I wondered if this old building had a dungeon archive like many old museums do. Eventually he showed up again and said that apparently they didn't have any right now.

I did try a sample of the vanilla porter which was more chocolate and cr\u00e8me than vanilla but I could see it going really well with some cake or brownies after dinner.\n\nHowever, I was here for a late lunch/early dinner so I opted for the turkey sandwich with their mac n' ale cheese side. The sandwich was a lot smaller than I was expecting for the price ($8.50 for a small sandwich and side). The turkey and spinach leaves were really fresh and the roll was lightly toasted and not dry, but the cranberry mayo didn't have a very strong flavour. It would have been better with actual whole cranberry sauce and then mayo separate. The sandwich was good but I was very disappointed with the size. The mac n' cheese was very good and cheesy but it wasn't very noteworthy - it was basically high quality Velveeta cheese a slight beer-esque tang to it, topped with parmigiana. I tried a bit of my friend's parmigiana fries and those were decent but, again, nothing special - just fries with parmigiana on top. \nService was fast (though the place was pretty empty) and friendly. They also had a few different ciders in bottles available which I wasn't expecting (I'm a HUGE cider fan), so that was a nice plus.\n\nMain point: I like going to breweries because they usually incorporate beer into a lot of their dishes. SunUp's beer-battered shrimp (again, what the friend ordered) and ale-infused cheese is an example but where are the beer-battered fries or soft beer bread or other delicacies you can find on Four Peaks' (for example) menu?

When I she brought it back she basically said we would never give anyone a dirty glass. She said she might have had some lemon or lime on her hand. Wow so I guess I was supposed to drink whatever dirt that fell off her hand and into my drink. I explained I didn't want that drink. She went back to the bar and got a fresh cup and drink. She comes back and says the last drinks I gave you were over poured by mistake and I don't want you to think I under poured you this time. I said I good I just wanted my drink in a clean glass. We pay her and tip her. Mind you this is our 2nd round. The waitress walks off and I take a sip of my drink. And it's some kind of harsh house vodka. I stop the waitress and told her that this wasn't grey goose vodka.  I told i didn't want anything and handed her the drink. She offered to bring her manager over. I watched her talk to her manager then return to the bar. She came back to our table and handed me a drink and said my manager said to replace the drink and if there was any \"other\" issues to speak to him. I told her that she offered to bring him over and i wanted to speak to him. She raises her voice at us and says why are you guys giving me a hard time I'm just trying to do my job. So before I raise my hand and slap the shit out this rude ass waitress i get up and walk out. My husband is still in there. Next thing i know he is being kicked out this piece of shit because he said this bitch is hella rude. Now the waitress tells the bouncer that she fears for her safety.  The bouncer offers us free passes to come back to a place we never paid to get into in the first place. And he said fuck the drinks you just bought you have to go.

Generally speaking, the service might be called good service (\"...except for the owner who is...\").\n\nBe prepared to wait and no matter what, the wait to get your food is always slow no matter how empty or packed--ESPECIALLY if you order take out and ask how long before pick up will be ready. On a recent occasion, I placed a take out order and asked the owner on the phone how long it would take and he told me 20 min.  I waited 15 min before leaving the house and it took 5 min to get there. When I arrived and asked for my order, I was courteously advised by the cashier that it was \"not yet finished.\" I watched the kitchen staff as they initiated preparing my order from the beginning. As I observed this process I asked the clerk why she said my order was already in process and she responded that \"...it was.\"\n\nWhen I had first inquired about my order (having been told it was 'nearly ready') I asked whether chips had been included and the owner advised me that I would have had to have ordered chip and paid for them.  While I waited AT the restaurant for my order for 20 min (that is in addition to the 20 min I waited before leaving my home) I would have thought management would have been courteous enough to offer me chips while I waited. They did not. So, instead of apologizing for the inconvenience of waiting on them or making my wait pleasant, I left a very dissatisfied customer.\n\nWhen I got home with my order, I had to endure my companion's complaints that the Albondigas was skimpy on the meatballs. Same said companion used to frequent Juan's extensively several years ago when he worked closer. He now challenges me each time I indicate intent to go there and refreshes my memory on past disappointments.\n\nThe burritos are indeed well made and are pretty much the highlight of the menu. The tosdadas shell are not freshly fried (you can see them sitting on a shelf above the grill), yet, my tostada was still soft. The prices are cheap $7-8 combos.

Perhaps it's the overall indifference, and everyday-ness quality to this place that explains.   \n\nFOOD --- 3 stars\nSERVICE --- 3.5 stars\nATMOSPHERE --- 4 stars\nPARKING --- 1 star\n\nOregano's isn't bad nor terribly good --- but it falls in the middle as an average lunch or dinner option.  Portions here are big, but quanity does not equal quality.  I find it to be infinitely better than most other Italian chains (the BARFY Olive Garden, Macaroni Grill and Carrabba's), but not quite at the level of Maggiano's or Il Fornaio.  \n\nThe food here is OK, although there are a few standouts. \n* Alfredo the Dark pasta with the poblano peppers.  \n* Lady is a Scampi pasta\n* Pizza Cookie (or whatever it's called)\n* Italian Fried Potatoes\n\nBtw, that last item is their cutesy name for waffle fries.  Being the waffle fry whore that I am, I have to say these are quite good. \n\nThe baked sandwiches are OK --- the beefstro and stuffed turkey being one of my usual orders.  The pizza is OK as well.  Being a thin crust lover, I find the crust at Pizza Heaven and Pizzeria Bianco to have a better-tasting texture.  It's almost a little too thin (read: cheap) here.  Kind of like notebook paper.  How do I know?  Because I've tried it.  The salads here are big, so be warned.  Can't comment on the taste though because I haven't had them.\n\nThe 1950s swing/jazz motif, tomato sauce cans, and loud t-shirts can be charming in a campy kind of way. But what I like most about this location is how they preserved the \"Damen/Herren\" bathroom signs from when it used to be some kind of Bavarian wonderland.  \n\nAmong the cons here are the parking NIGHTMARE and sometimes hellish 1 hour-plus waits (on Mondays even!).  This place is ALWAYS packed.  I do not understand why there are only 15 parking spots here for a restaurant that easily seats over 100.  They must expect all their customers to carpool together in mini-vans.  But even so, they should know that NO ONE in Central Phoenix would be caught dead in a mini-van.\n\nThe parking shortage has caused nearby businesses to post bitchy signage warning Oregano's patrons not to park there - resulting in the traffic BOOBYTRAP that is 10th St.  Drivers must dodge slowly moving cars and waddling Oregano's customers weave in and out as the tiny parking lot leaks out onto 10th.  \n\nStaff here is always quick and freakishly friendly and cheery -- kind of like the drones at Jamba Juice and Cold Stone Creamery.  It's kind of cute, but borderline annoying that it seems trite.  But there are plenty of a-holes at other restaurants so I'm not complaining.\n\nSo there you have it.  Not exactly great, but I will be back soon.  Visit 4,763 is coming up next week.\n\nP.S.  For stalkers who care, Phoenix Fire Department DOES eat here often.  In fact when Melinda sees a fire engine parked outside she always requests a table close to the firefighters.  She thinks those guys are \"en fuego.\"", "business_id": "ML1RJdeZ7bbfMrHvJ7m99A", "stars": 3, "date": "2007-04-10", "type": "review"}

We stand there and are unnoticed  by the 3 people behind the bar.

She cards us.. I show her my id and he shows his. She explains she needs to see and card the person he is buying the drink for. Okay that's a pain.. but fine. So what does she do. She leaves me at the bar while she goes with Carlos out to the crowded patio to card his wife.. really? How about you take care of me since I have met all the requirements? okay? so while she is gone..another bartender comes up and takes my order.

Half the table received theirs..and she made the rest of us wait as she doled out waters. Waters are great but we ordered beer..give us what we ordered!

They don't take reservations and all the party has to be there for them to list you. Choose inside, outside or first available. You can order a drink and even apps for the wait. This is basically a bar that sells food so leave the kiddos at home. They will not enjoy it here, you will not enjoy it here with them and everyone else will not enjoy it so take them to McDonalds and leave them with a sitter. You deserve a night out anyway.\n\nThe Pizza Cookie is really good. I like Chocolate Chip/Peanut Butter. The servers here really work their buts off. They will do most anything to make your meal here a great one. They even chit chat with you if you like and make you feel special. I never tip under 20% here and feel I get my money's worth every time. \n\nThey seem to have been turning over help more in the past couple of years. They have a solid business and I attribute that to their growth, but for the most part the employees seem to like working there.\n\nMy only real beef aside from the wait is there are only two bathrooms. One Male and one Female. As many customers as this place has they need to figure a way to add dividers and make it so more can use as there is always a line. The parking is not a big deal to me. They have a small lot, but there is PLENTY of street parking nearby and if there is not, then you need to come back at a different time because the wait will be a killer.", "business_id": "ML1RJdeZ7bbfMrHvJ7m99A", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-05-23", "type": "review"}

There were 6 of us and we were easily seated at one of their large booths inside. \nWe were hungry and looking back we admittedly had eyes bigger than our belly's.  We ordered the Bruschetta Authentico and the Lawrence's Stuffed 'Shrooms to start.  The fresh onions on the Bruschetta really added quite a bit of flavor, I didn't find the addition of the marinara provided necessary.  \nThe Stuffed mushrooms were 2 large portabella mushrooms stuffed full of sausage marinara and melted cheese.  It took a little effort to cut them up and share, but they were quite good.

I personally made 3 meals out of my Ziti dish.  It was simple yet tasty and served in a baked thin crust bowl.  I sampled the Margherita pizza which I found to be lack luster.  The Alfredo dish was not as flavorful as I would have expected and was slightly rescued by the seasoning on the southwest bread that is served with the dish.

Really not cool. Really bad for business. \n\nAnywho... seeing as my fiance wasn't back I guessed correctly that he scored us some bar seats. And there were two more down a ways. Full my ass.

No biggie, but the guy was kind of abrupt and not friendly. He then had a really awkward interaction with a girl that worked there. He was reprimanding her but did it in a very rude way.

We're not big on Pizza but there are other entrees...  not many but some. We figured, well, not a huge selection but maybe they do those few things really great!!  NOOOOOOOOOO.... not the case. I can't say about the pizza... but, we started with a side salad which was excellent - I had such high hopes for dinner!  Shortly there after we received our  Bruschetta Authentico (hmmm... reverse order)...  these was a huge plate of bread and the bruschetta mix. It was bland & tasteless and way too oily.  I live for bruschetta when I go to Italian Restaurants but skip this in the future - we even reread the descriptions a number of times trying to figure out why it was so horrible..... tomatoes were not rip for starters but the spices were just not right.  \n\nNow enter what they call Italian Flag Lasagna. It was simply the worst Lasagna we ever had. My dinner companion loves Lasagna and rarely complains about anything. He stopped eating it and pushed it aside as well and I had to ask him if his was as bad as mine was.  We both got it and neither of us could literally \"choke it down.\" The noodles were mush and the entire Lasagna had been obviously pre-cooked and microwaved. Costco frozen lasagna is better than this sorry excuse for an entree.  We basically asked the \"manager\" if anyone was looking at the items coming out of the kitchen because it simply shouldn't have been served. While they did not charge us for these items it is a sad state of affairs when an Italian place can't figure out lasagna.\n\nWe decided to strike Oregano's from our dinner list....", "business_id": "ML1RJdeZ7bbfMrHvJ7m99A", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-04-25", "type": "review"}
