They charge a fair price and don't nickel and dime you on the \"extra's\" - what they quote is what they charge. Also some nice value-adds like free roadside assistance with oil changes.\n2. They are professional - you are dealing with folks who view this as their career and honor their work.\n3. Consistency - it's very underrated! When I need to get my oil changed or car fixed, I want the same experience and no surprises. Carolina Tire delivers on that promise.\n4. They have a good waiting area, complete with a children's play area, big screen TV and free wifi.\n\nOnly downside is that their location is not handy for walking to the mall or restaurants - if you need a ride they will take you to Lynx, but the location doesn't have a lot of stuff immediately next door.\n\nOverall I'm a big fan!", "business_id": "n3jucIUCSjIXrKU-ykIb0w", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-12-17", "type": "review"}

Previously, I did not even notice they had kept it until I returned months later and it was not in my car, luckily they still had it.

I took the car back there and he told me that it was a hose leaking and that he would fix it but he would charge me that he'd charge $72 for the parts and waive the labor. He assured me that it would stop the leaking.\n\n12/16: I noticed my car leaking again and called. I talked to Kim and I told her the problem and also stated that I no longer wanted Chuck to work on the car. She told me that an employee named JP would be inspecting the car. I called Jason @704-536-8863 and he told me to call Kim again as she was the new manager. My daughter took the car back to the shop at 12 PM and waited.

I thought this at first, I just have been asking myself why wouldn't the manager come over and try to stop me from leaving or help work on the deal.

I had sent an online request for an appointment Tuesday for the recall service (free) and to get \"THE WORKS? FUEL SAVER PACKAGE $39.95 OR LESS\" which includes free tire rotation. Two days later, I called them after receiving no response. They said that they were having trouble with their e-mail system and to come in on Friday, which I did, arriving around 7:15 in the morning. That, along with tire rotation and oil change, had me ready about 8:45 or so. Unfortunately, the first time, they had charged me for the recall service, which I had to have them correct since per Ford, this should be no charge to me. Because I was in a hurry, I failed to get them to also remove the charge for the tire rotation which was supposed to have been included for free as part of my package.

I was hoping for an outstanding experience based on the other reviews, but I have to say it wasn't a whole lot different than other big city repair places.  Based on my experience there I would advise:\n1. Call for a rough estimate, and make it clear that you haven't committed to any particular shop- my truck was immobile and I made the mistake of having it towed there first and then got the estimate once I was pretty well trapped.  My repair ended up being 10% more expensive than the last identical repair I had gotten done at another shop, and about 30% more than my regular small town mechanic had quoted me.  \n2.  Thoroughly review the estimate in person and make sure there won't be any unexpected add-ons before agreeing to the estimate- I agreed to the estimate only to get a call later saying that there would have to be an additional $150 repair made in order to do the alignment, which should have been quite obvious to them at the time of the initial inspection.\n3.  Ask lots of questions- after getting my estimate, I asked if the $50 estimate charge was included in the quote I had been given- he paused, backpedaled and said no, \"well we haven't even figured out how we're going to get it into the shop and up on the lift to do the repairs yet, so it might be a little more.\"  I'm sorry, but the $50 I agreed to was for the quote you just gave me, not for 'figuring out how to get it into the shop'.\n\nSo, when it was all said and done I had paid what I figure to be at least $150 an hour in labor, which seems to be on the higher end of what shops charge, so I wouldn't go here expecting a deal.  Aside from the gentleman I had the quote snafu with, everyone else seemed professional, but I didn't have a particularly overwhelmingly great customer service experience.  Based on the other reviews it sounds like they go out of their way to make women in particular feel comfortable there, so if you're willing to pay extra for that experience, and you're not a cheapskate guy driving a junky old truck this might be the shop for you.

I feel it necessary based off my most recent experience.  Almost $700 for an oil change, fuel filter, O2 sensor replacement and tune up.  Since these services have been completed my gas mileage has decreased significantly.  Not a good experience at all.\n\nUPDATE ON 02/16/15:\n\nAND IT GETS EVEN BETTER!  So after all these services were done I noticed a substantial decrease in gas mileage, so I took it back to Broadway to have them look at it.  They reviewed everything and said it was a \"faulty fuel filter\".  They put in a different one and said everything was fixed.\n\nNOT!  I was still getting terribly gas mileage so I went to a reputable mechanic and he showed me that when my car is on that gas is shooting out right from where my fuel filter is at.  It was spraying everywhere and obviously not fixed.  I am going back to Broadway today to show them again what is going on.

Not prepared, or in any mood to purchase another vehicle and resume monthly car payments, I eventually relented and did my homework, researching the vast market of SUV's.  I settled on the Nissan Murano and decided upon a 2011 certified pre-owned that they had in inventory.  Keith Cone was our salesman throughout the entire process and I cannot give him  enough positive feedback.  He turned what started out as a scary, unpleasant event into a wonderful experience.  I basically only know how to get gas and turn on a radio.  Keith took his time in explaining and thoroughly answering questions about the vehicles I was comparing and considering.  He is approachable, relatable, knowledgeable, patient, and I could tell he was genuinely sympathetic to the situation.  He goes above and beyond, offering to come in on his day off if needed. At no time did I feel rushed or pushed.  I could also tell that he was not going to let me drive off in a vehicle that was not an appropriate fit for my needs. (I drive over 100-miles daily on crappy country roads). The entire team at Zimbrick were professional and courteous.  The paper signing at the end is usually a long, drawn-out snooze fest, but even this seemed to go quickly and painlessly...thanks, Bill!  Best experience I've had from a dealer.  I had purchased the KIA brand new from Metro Ford/KIA in 2007 and they were rude and unprofessional.  I feel that I will remain a life-long customer of Zimbrick High Crossing and will definitely seek Keith Cone in the future when I am in the market for a new vehicle.

It had that tell-tale burning smell which was making me nervous.  Turns out I had a loose oil-filter from my last oil change and dripping oil + catalytic converter = my car is about to die smell.\n\nVirginia Auto Service changed my oil and cleaned up my engine.  It was so nice to receive a call from them saying my belt was fine and an oil change was all I needed.  It was refreshing to be given an honest assessment vs being told some great story about some random repair that was needed...I am a female after all and have received some rather odd diagnoses in the past (your rotors fell off, so you'll need to have them replaced for example).\n\nIt is very reassuring to know I now have an honest, kind and reliable repair shop for my car.  Did my oil change run a bit more than some $19.99 special?  Yes, but it was so worth it!  Now my little one won't be getting an oil change for another year most likely, but my service advisor, Robert, asked me to please stop by every three months so they could check out my belts, tire pressure, etc just to be safe.

I was young and inexperienced with life so I didn't know the thing I know now. But I will share my story with you about how horrible this place is and why it should be shut down. \n\nI had an 85 chevy monte carlo, it was a good running car, but if I sold it, I'd probably get 1500 for it.. and book value it's prob worth $900. I didn't know a lot about cars then like I do now (I ended up using my monte as a project car and learned everythign I know today). Well I had an issue with one of my back brake lines busting.. My brake light came on and I didn't know what to do so I went to \"just brakes\"  thinking professionals would be working on my car.. \n\nSo first some young kid pulls my car in and takes off my tires.. I had brand new rims on there and he drops it on the wheel plate (the part you park the left front tire on to align the car with the car lift) and he dents the center cap.. I told them that wasn't like that when I pulled the car in and don't expect to leave with it like that. So they take it in back and try to \"fix it\" and the heavy set guy comes out and tells me oh I fixed it for you.. I look and the chrome is all crinkled on the part he \"fixed,\"  I told him that was ridiculous and that's not how I brought it in.. He then said well we will buy you another if it has to come out of my own pocket (trying to make me feel sorry for him or something) I said sounds good to me.. So one of them went and picked me up a new one from discount tires..   \n\nSecond, they do a walk around and show me the rare line was busted, and then started trying to talk me into all this stuff with my brakes.. New rotors, new pads, new seals.. new cylinders.. and I asked the old man, if they did military discounts.. he said no, our prices are too cheap to do it and you won't find a better deal anywhere else.. He starts crunching numbers and looks at his calculator funny and says, hmm now maybe ill consider giving you a discount. I said how much is the total? He said $800 or something ridiculous (this was in 2003 mind you..) I said that is insane.. for an extra $100 you can have the car.. put all my stuff back together and fix my line and that's it.. Just the line fix and the brake line bleeding cost me something around $200.. also ridiculous now that i know better, but I had no other choice... a brake like prob cost them $5.. and the bleeding isn't much either.. I was asking the \"manager\" (the one who did the walk around me claiming all this stuff I needed done from a professional opinion),  how he liked his job and how long he worked there for.. he said it wasn't bad and he started 2 weeks ago.. I chuckled inside.. two weeks.. \n\nso then they do the repair, and took it for the \"test drive,\"  I remember the other guy saying, \"you know what to do..\"   the other guy said, yep..   So he comes back and says everything checks out.. ( great knowing now that i know now I wish it didn't and the guy flew off the road into a lamp post or something) well I get my car back and it's making like a hesitation vibration feeling.. as I'm driving it back.. so I get back on base and I'm looking at my engine, and I noticed my spark plug wires were sliced.. a few of them.. just enough to cause issues once in a while..  Lol.. they sliced my spark plugs wires because they were butt hurt that I made them get me a new center cap that they broke.. and hurt their feelings when I made them look dumb for telling me I need $800 worth of brake work on a $900 car.. How low class, uneducated, and unprofessional can you be??   Jokes on them .. I needed to replace the spark plugs and wires anyway so I did that that weekend with their motivation!   Also, they wanted something like 130$ to replace each rotor.. I paid $30 for each rotor and did it myself ..

In this day and age we shouldn't have to spend multiple hours going back and forth just to make a purchase. Sitting in empty offices while the salesperson disappears to \"talk to my manager\" - don't BS me, I've seen Fargo, I know what you are really doing.\n\nEveryone uses the internet to research the type of car they want, you can look up the MPG, the cargo room, the legroom. You know what colours are available and what trims. You can even look at the dealer website and see what inventory is in stock, complete with accessories and MSRP* (The Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price excludes destination freight charge, tax, title, license, dealer fees and optional equipment. See your dealer for details)\n\nSo I had gone onto the GMC website, found the exact model of vehicle I wanted to buy with the exact specifications that fit my need and my budget. I got a generic email from John, the Coulter Internet Manager telling me he's my man. There were two models listed in stock, so I sent an email to him with the VINs of the cars I was interested in, together with the make model and mileage of my trade-in. I never heard anything back.\n\nSo a couple of days later I walk into Coulter. This is not your typical dealership with hundreds of cars on the lot, there are maybe 6 cars out front and a couple more in the showroom. Imagine the scene - I walk into the showroom which has car salesmen all hanging around each others desks, chewing the fat and yucking it up. They scatter like cockroaches when I walk in. An older gentleman approaches me, \n\nYou looking for parts?\nNo, I want to buy a car\nWell if you are looking for parts, it's down that way\nNo, I want to buy a car\nOh, come this way\n\nThat's how I met Dean. Dean has a PhD. I know this because it's on his business card AND on the door plate to his office. Don't ask for Dean if you are in a rush, because he moves like molasses. Up we go in an elevator, through a door to a second floor garage. We are looking for the car I am interested in. Dean is half listening to me. I tell him that I have the exact car I need to see. I tell him that according to your website you have two in stock, one silver and one white. Let's find either of them. He doesn't know where they are. We look in the garage; we look out on the lot. We go back down the elevator to his office. I give him the VINs, he disappears, comes back and off we go to try and find either of the two cars. After much searching and much shuffling we find one of them, out on a parking lot, behind the service area, mixed in with private cars and one with the whole side missing. Yep, you guessed it, Dean doesn't have the keys.\n\nWhen he finally returns with the keys, he reluctantly takes me on a test drive. No you can't drive it out of the lot, we have security. Where is this security when we were looking for the car? Maybe they can instigate a search for the white one I was really interested in. We then go on the most pedestrian test drive ever. No freeway exposure, just literally around the block. I'm driving a V6 I want to let it go, see what it can do, but nope.\n\nSo the car drives well, the MSRP is right. All that is needed now is to work out how much they are going to give me for my trade-in. As a good internet user I have researched the Kelly Blue Book value of my car. The KBB trade-in value is low, I expect that. They offer a range based on the condition of the car, from a low number if the car is ready for the scrapheap, to a high number if it is in pristine condition. I figure I'm somewhere in the middle. But it is what it is and with the range in hand we begin the negotiations. Cue Dean's exit again, this time with my car keys.\n\nAt first he can't get the VIN entered into his computer, so he figures he wrote it down wrong, then he takes his iPhone and snaps a photo of it, that doesn't work. He asks me if I have my insurance card and he reads the VIN off that. Finally, he gets the computer to accept the number. Lots of button pushing ensues, then he curses the printer, then he prints something, then he's off again.\n\nWhen Dean finally returns, he has a price for me. $2,000 less than the low price on my range! Are you kidding me? At least he doesn't try to spin me a line about the age of the car or the condition. Just this is the price, take it or leave it. I say I'll leave it. This is a critical time in the car sales negotiation process, I waited half a second and then it came.\n\n\"What can we do to get you in a new car today?\"\n\nI said you can stop insulting me with that price and offer something within the KBB range. Ok, he says, \"Let me go talk to my manager\". So Dean makes his final departure. When he returns he shakes my hand and says we are getting nowhere, just wasting each other's time and goodbye.\n\nSo here I am, three hours later no further forward in the car buying process than I was before. \n\nSigh. I wish Amazon sold cars", "business_id": "E3sONi8kCTBL96OjzpgBsA", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-12-30", "type": "review"}

The first time I waited it was close to TWO HOURS and then it runs about $80!  On two separate occasions I had them look at problems I was having as my vehicle is still under factory warranty.

They will give you a ride back home/to work AFTER you sit in the waiting room for an HOUR+ before they actually bring you to where you need to be! Then after leaving the vehicle there all day they called at 5 to tell me they couldn't figure out the issue and asked if I wanted them to come pick me up. This was on two separate occasions and both times I was given an lame excuse as to why it was happening and sent on my way.

They said I needed to rotate my tires again and balance them (even though I said that's funny cause I didn't feel any pulling/jolting in my steering wheel from being out of balance) and then the internal cabin filter (that smells funny when you turn the AC on) was going to be $130 JUST to replace that!

I told the person that hit that I had insurance and all that. In my mind I was wondering what this was going to do to my insurance rates. The man asked me if I saw any damage to either of our car,  I said no.  He said he had a repair shop and knew there wasn't anything to worry about.  I asked him where his shop was because with with what he was doing for me, I'd like to give him my work..  He said that was not a reason to go there.  Go there to get good service was his attitude and for no other reason. \n\nTwo cars later I finally got there.  They are AAA approved.  They may not be as inexpensive as some places, but I believe you get what you pay for as far as the quality of the work that is done.  They are courteous and knowledgeable.  The man at the front desk always takes the time to explain what they are doing.  I leave thee with a pretty good idea of what to expect.  I also have never had to return to Tony's because the work don my car was incomplete.  I  try not to complain but is it asking to much to just do the job right the first time!  Cheers to these guys on this one!when that has happened but having to do it has always really irritated.   Jeff, the manager has even saved me money by sending me somewhere else where I could get something done for less! I was told I needed two new tires and they should be replace pretty soon.  They could put them on there but I could save money if I went to Discount Tires down the street.  Actually one of the tires looked okay to me, but it wasn't worth the aggravation to not agree.  I have gotten the bad tire story more than once in my travels.  A few days later, I did go down to Discount Tires. I asked them to look at my two front tires.  First thing the guy did was to show me was where the tire I thought was okay was bad.  It was separating near the side in a weird way and did need to be replaced.  He said I was fortunate because with the make of the tire he could prorate it even though I hadn't bought it there!  Jeff did save me money with his suggestion..  \n\nI sent my 87 year old neighbor to Tony's to have her car serviced.  As well as they treated me, I worried because I couldn't go with her and make sure they didn't take advantage of her. When she got their they actually saved her money.  There were several things that the dealer ALWAYS did when she went in. I can't begin to tell you the what it would cost her when she took her car in there just for an oil change!  She was happily surprised when they told her they several things didn't need to be done on her car at that time unless she really wanted to spend more money.  I have since found more than a few of my neighbors have been going there for years and they feel the same as I do. \n\nOne advantage to Tony's is it's location.  You can find it.  It is relatively easy to get in and out of.   They shop is kept organized and clean with a front desk-no having to look for who's in charge-and a nice waiting area.

First off, the oil leak was \"repaired\" only to find out later that it really wasn't.  Turns out there was a slit (cut) in the valve cover gasket, which either occurred when this shop put the part in, or they purchased it with the defect, but either way, the problem was missed on their part, which tells me they do not pay attention to detail.  \n\nSo, when we noticed the leak was still an issue, it was under warranty through this shop for the original work, so I took it back.  I spent a few hours waiting since I live in the far east valley, they did repair it, however later that day my \"service engine\" light came on, then went off.  A few days later, I parked my car, turned it off, and went to start it again after picking up my mail, and the car would not start.  Thankfully, my husband is a mechanic (the only reason he did not fix the oil leak the 2nd time around was because it was under warranty), we towed my vehicle back to my house, which was only down the road, but it was dead.  Come to find out, the cam positioning sensor had not been plugged back into the vehicle all the way, which is what tripped my \"service engine\" light a couple of days before, and once it became looser over the course of driving the vehicle, the vehicle finally wouldn't start.  My husband plugged this in completely (like it should have been doen at the shop after fixing the oil leak), and there have been zero issues since.\n\nNow, I'm not sure if this shop did this on purpose, or if they just do not pay attention to detail very well.  But, given that something as simple as an oil leak required TWO visits due to a part that they either didn't notice was defective or they messed up themselves, and then they did not finish putting the vehicle back together when they were finished, I am not very happy.  On top of it, I had to have my vehicle towed (thank goodness for towing on my insurance!), and had to deal with a dead vehicle when my school aged son, and I were both sick at the time.\n\nI would NEVER recommend this shop to anyone, I will never ever go back, and I also intend on notifying the dealership I purchased my vehicle from of the issues in the hopes that they choose another BMW shop in the future to service any used BMW's that come onto their lot.

It is an older car with not much life left in it, so I wanted to work with someone honest who would not pressure me to sink a lot of money into the vehicle.  Through Living Social and Yelp, I found 25th Street Automotive.  I wish I had gone elsewhere.  The Living Social Certificate provided for 3 oil changes in about a year's time.   This car is driven very little, so it would not need 3 oil changes in one year.  When I inquired at 25th Street, they told me \"No problem, we'll honor it, as long as you get the FIRST oil change done within the year before it expires, we'll honor the other two.\"  This was NOT the case.  The first two oil changes were done there and last week, I made an appointment to have the third one done today.  I mentioned the Living Social Certificate on the phone when I made the appointment.  My wife took the car in for the appointment and they told her that they would NOT honor it because it had expired.  If they had been honest with me up front and said \"we'll only honor it for X period of time,\" I would have had no problem, but they gave me their word they would honor the offer and they did not live up to their word.  My wife was not pleased with their response and left the garage without having the oil change done.\n\nAnother problem I had is when I took the car in for one of the earlier oil changes, they investigated a known issue that I had with the car.  They did not verbally inform me that there would be a cost to investigate the problem.  (I did sign the standard form that likely authorized the work, so I realize that I was legally on the hook and didn't complain at the time).  I was somewhat surprised to find a $60+ change on the bill for the cost to investigate the problem and provide an estimate.  Once again, had they been more forthright and verbally told me that there would be a cost, I could have made an educated decision and likely would have OK'd it.  Finally, the estimate for this repair was in the $600-$700 range.  They insisted on using a \"Genuine AC Delco\" part that cost somewhere north of $400.  I asked if they would be willing to use an aftermarket part or obtain a used part from a salvage parts dealer and they would not.  To put it in perspective, this car has a book value of less than $1,000, so why would you install a brand new $400 part when much less costly alternatives are available?  It just made no sense at all.  (I do own a newer, nicer car for which their method of repair WOULD make sense).  I declined to do the repair and ultimately found a brand new aftermarket part on the Internet for $45 and had it installed another garage for $120 (which included a warranty on the work) and the problem has been solved.  In a fair assessment, the guys at 25th Street are probably good mechanics and they may be well-suited for working on newer or higher-end cars, or for working with people who are not as cost-sensitive as I am about their cars.  They are pleasant on the phone, accommodating with appointments and have a free shuttle service which may be a great convenience for many people.  For those who have older cars or are highly cost-sensitive, you may want to take my experience into consideration.  Also, regardless of the type of car you have, I highly recommend you ask a lot of questions up front and if any promises are made, get them in writing.", "business_id": "65ujBUIwQ3iGBjymj268IA", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-12-31", "type": "review"}

One time I had to take my car back three times before the items were fixed properly, and on two occasions, things came back broken that hadn't been when I took my car in.

Actually, who he recommended was \"Mike Carlton on Indian and near you.\"\n\nCan I tell you next to useless this bit of information is on Google? (Still shaking my head on that one.)

Besides, what do I know?\" And it was conveniently close.\n\nAfter speaking to Mike to confirm his hours of operation I dropped my car off. His team was able to look at my car the next day of operation. They confirmed the diagnosis the dealer made lickity split. I was shocked, there's no way to emphasize the level here, but SHOCKED when Mike called with his estimate. The difference was substantially less *and* my car was going to be ready the very next day.\n\nLet me say that last part again:\nMy car was going to be ready THE NEXT DAY.\n\nI don't know the location of the magical unicorn tree where Mike grows Ford dealer parts.

There are plans to move motorbike repair to a northern Scottsdale location (74th St & Butherus Dr.) where it will be called \"Dirt Riders West\". Motorbikes can be purchased at Spitfire Automotive. While there I got my first up close and personal look at something called an off-road Beta Motorcycle 300.\n\nThe next part will make men groan. (Ok. Maybe some women too!)

I politely reminded Alexander about the anti-theft starter, but he said the starter was bad and that would cost only 399.99. I assured him that I didn't need a starter and I felt like I was being screwed. He got very defensive over the phone and finally told me to come pick up the car that he will not work on it. Alexander then hung up on me. I tried calling him back to ask what the issue was, but he yelled that he was putting my old battery back in the car and to come pick it up, again hung up on me. \n\nI took off work to go and pick up my car which had no work done. When I got to the shop, Alexander didn't even look or talk to me, threw my keys on the counter and walked away.

I tried to register a complaint with the BBB but they are not a registered business. \n\nThe treatment I received at Alexander's was the worst service I have ever experienced from a business and very, very far from professional.", "business_id": "Y1ReKMzP5pl76oDUrheaBg", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-01-06", "type": "review"}

Turned out I needed two new tires. When they got it up on the rack, they found one frozen bolt and one broken off, each on a different front wheel. They told me that Alexanders (A & J) could fix that for me, and what they had said it would cost. When I walked over there, it was pretty clear I wasn't happy about all the $$$$ I was ending up spending, but I said it wasn't their fault. When they were done and I walked over to pick it up, the young man behind the counter said he wasn't going to charge me, shook my hand, and wished me a nice day. Made me quite a bit happier.", "business_id": "Y1ReKMzP5pl76oDUrheaBg", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-01-21", "type": "review"}
