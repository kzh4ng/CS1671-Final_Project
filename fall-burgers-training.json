Prices are low, selection is great, but dont expect fine dining by any means. \n\nService is hit or miss at pretty much all of them; if you have lunch at any Kings, you will likely be waited on by a sweet but sarcastic  older lady who has been doing the waiting thing for 30 years and knows her game. Seek out this lady.  My experience with the younger crowd at night isnt the same.\n\nIm in my 30s now, and very little has changed, other than the Fox Chapel location was remodeled about 10 years ago to look less like a diner, which was a big fail.

By definition they aren't fine dining and there usually isn't much of a reason to leave a rave review. So when I do review fast food joints, it's because they're extremely bad at what they do - and this Wendy's location is a prime example of that.\n\nThis spot used to be ok enough. I remember coming by with my family and having no serious problems getting a quick bite at all. These days, though, the staff definitely don't have their act together, and I guess management doesn't want to tell them so. I can't remember the last time I got out of their drive-thru lane in under 15 minutes. At first I thought maybe it was a fluke. Now it's become a long-term occurrence. The last time I came, they had the audacity to say \"We'll be with you in just a moment\" - twice! - and they left me hanging. Each. Time. I ended up staying just to see if they even remembered I was there. They did, after I sat so long that it would have been too long a wait at a sit-down restaurant, let alone in a fast food drive-thru line.\n\nThe only reason I keep coming here is because their food at least meets Wendy's standards and gives me something to keep me going between my appointments throughout the day. But based on other reviews, even this isn't always the case. Get in the line here at your own risk. Don't expect much. In fact, skip it altogether if you can, until other visitors can confirm that you won't wait as long as we currently do for our \"fast\" snacks and meals.", "business_id": "m0QsJDntW1MrWCxBVFwuAg", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-09-08", "type": "review"}

Well:\n\nI went here on an anthropological adventure. I'd heard the regulars were noteworthy in a Bikinesque fashion. That they're scary and funny and local and Cheersish... And that everything takes forever. And that everything is average but that it's the combination of the preceding factors that make this place worthy of one adventure to see how the other half live in their natural habitat.\n\nWe walked in and were IMMEDIATELY, like within seconds, greeted by a drunken song. A man and a song and a twinkle in his eye and I was immediately charmed. \n\nI was expecting it to smell very strong, especially since they sell cigarettes in the vending machines, but really there was no noteworthy odor. \n\nThe bartender was high or drunk. If she was not high or drunk, she's spent so much time in her life being either high or drunk that she now gives off a permadrunkenhigh vibe. For instance, she takes our drink orders and says, \"Want menus?\" and then walks away and re-asks us our order, which was a pitcher of beer. And then does not ever bring menus. Glazed eyes. I don't give a fuck ethos. \n\nAMF is on the menu, which I had to be reminded stands for adios mother fucker, which is just basically telling the drinker that this particular night will not be one they should bother trying to remember. Here, I could make some grand (albeit stupid) statement about how this is exactly the type of place people come to forget, but I don't think that's true considering I was the only one drinking them. \n\nThe one gentleman we interacted with was so desperately lonely that he clung to every vestige of a chance of an opportunity to insert himself in our convo and I felt deep sympathy for him. \n\nAll and all, I can't see any reason to ever go back but I'm glad I went and that it exists.

I specified no salt on the french fries and no ketchup on the burger. When I picked up my order, I asked her if there was no salt on the fries and no ketchup on the burger because it wasn't written on the receipt. She accused me of not saying I didn't want salt.

She didn't want to give it to me. After practically arguing with her for several minutes and her attempts to give me plain mustard, that I do not like nor eat, she finally gave me what I asked for.  She was not pleasant about it.

Hector didn't really do all that much for me except hang up on me and tell me that If I wanted to complain, I'd have to call back Wednesday morning at 8 AM.  \n\nworst part?  Hector didn't even ask what my issue was.  He displayed zero willingness to help and of course, an apology was out of the question.  \n\nHector's poor disposition and suffering customer service skils have led me to write a better business bureau complaint.. all over ketchup, curly fries, and ranch dressing.\n\nI really hope it was worth it to you, Hector.  Here's some insider advice though.  NEVER let a customer walk away angry.  If you are in a position of power to fix a situation and avoid a negative escalation, do it.  Since Hector clearly skipped class in any managerial courses he may have taken at the community college, he could use this advice.  \n\nIt could have been corrected.
