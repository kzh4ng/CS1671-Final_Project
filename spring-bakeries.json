The best thing to ever happen to me is the installation of the cafe they added the food is to die for that you can't get just anywhere! Gyros and the Chicken Shawarma are my favorites if you have been to Pitaland you know how great it is and if you haven't been to Pitaland well your cheating yourself and missing out on a huge part of life. Pitaland is excellent all around from products to staff to cleanliness I can't say a bad thing about Pitaland it's a neighborhood staple and hope I never see it leave.

What's worse is I live five minutes away from this place. I can't feel \"too lazy\" to take a bus here because it is so conveniently close; I can literally just walk over and get what I want. It is so dangerous for me, but I always convince myself it is worth it. \n\nI've tried to make an effort to get something different when I am at Prantl's. So far I've had the burnt almond torte, apple strudel, white chocolate raspberry cup, burnt almond cup, red velvet cup, and coconut cream doughnut. All of these pastries are fantastic, so allow me to get a little more detailed about each of them.\n\nBurnt almond torte: of course, you have to get this. It's what they are famous for, blah blah blah. But, be warned! If you are eating for one, get the travel bar, and do NOT eat it all at once! I am a person that loves sweets. I have always had a really high tolerance for them. But in this case, the almond torte was very sweet even for me. If you do not have much of a sweet tooth, I suggest you eat a little at a time, because you can easily go over the deep end and feel sick, and end up hating this pastry, or something.\n\nWhy is this pastry amazing? Well, first off, the cream is a thick topping that, in my opinion, takes the....cake. The cake is moist, succulent, and isn't too much. You know how there are some cakes that are super dense, like when you take a bite out of it there is just too much cake?? This isn't like that at all. There is a little butter cream frosting --I think-- in the middle of the torte that has a great consistency with the cake and cream. On top of that are the almonds which provide the perfect crunch. It is a fantastic combination in your mouth, and it makes you want all of it. But like I said, enjoy it, and stop before you go overboard.\n\nApple Strudel: My grandma would always make apple strudel when I was at her place, so my expectations were high. Nevertheless, Prantl's exceeded it. I was shocked. The apple strudel definitely is a lot less sweeter than the burnt almond torte. The dough and the apple filling work very well together, and taking a bite out of this is like taking a trip down memory lane. I highly recommend this pastry if you are a fan of apples.\n\nThe three cups: These cups are so cute! The best part of it is you get a deal when you get a dozen of them. The white chocolate raspberry cups are a great treat that has a rich raspberry filling in the middle. It takes away from the super sweet cup, and gives it a more decadent, tart-y flavor. The almond cup is a miniature version of the travel torte, except the butter cream frosting is in the middle of the cup. I actually liked this better, because I feel like the butter cream really brings out the flavor. The red velvet cups were sweet, and my least favorite of all of them. Don't get me wrong, they were great, but seemed boring and not as unique compared to the other cups.\n\nThe coconut cream doughnut was nice! I am not a fan of coconut on pastries, but the flakes provided a nice touch instead of an overpowering flavor. There was a vanilla cream in the doughnut, which is my favorite, but to me tasted like a good doughnut, and, like the red velvet cups, was not that unique. \n\nFor those that are not the most sweets-inclined, I would recommend the apple strudel, or the white-chocolate raspberry cups. The pastries that are baked here are delicious and rich. Go here, you will not regret it!", "business_id": "yWVY1Bq19lDxu3BP7_96EQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-03-11", "type": "review"}

And I wish that I hadn't, because now their goodies are going to haunt my dreams.\n\nI came here to pick up cupcakes for a friend's birthday. They had well-stocked cases considering it was a little later in the day. I bought a few of their regular-sized cupcakes with sprinkles and an assortment of their cake cups (which are smaller cupcakes in different flavors). Then I saw \"it\"....the cake which I'd only heard about in legends...the burnt almond torte. They had a \"travel\" individual-sized torte available, so I figured I needed to see what all of the fuss was about (I mean, hey, if it's good enough for the Huffington Post, it's good enough for me!)\n\nSeeing as I have no self control, I couldn't resist digging into the almond torte as soon as I got home. This confection is everything it's cracked up to be. It's such an interesting contrast of textures -- the buttery vanilla cake itself was light and airy and almost melted in my mouth. It perfectly complemented the crunchy almonds and large flakes of sugar on the outside. The buttercream icing enveloping it all gave it a nice burst of creamy sweetness. It managed to be simultaneously buttery, sweet, and decadent without feeling too rich. The only part of the torte that I didn't get a lot from was the custard layer in the middle. There wasn't much of it present, and it didn't really add anything to the cake. However, this was the \"travel\" version, which I think uses a shelf-stable custard. I read that they have a version that uses another type of filling that requires refrigeration, and I'd be curious to try that to see if it make a difference. Either way, it was freaking delicious. I would say that I agree with HuffPo that this is the best cake in America, but since I haven't tried every cake in America, I'm not yet qualified to make that statement...so...new life goal! ;)\n\nThe other goodies that I picked up were winners as well. The chocolate cupcakes with sprinkles were moist, flavorful and piled high with fluffy frosting. I would classify the frosting here as on the sweeter side (which I prefer), but not sweet to the point that it makes your teeth hurt. The assorted cake cups were equally mouthwatering, each one packed with its own unique flavors. Everyone agreed that I was the hero of the night for having brought such deliciousness to the birthday party ;)\n\nSee you in my dreams, burnt almond torte...", "business_id": "yWVY1Bq19lDxu3BP7_96EQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-03-23", "type": "review"}

Meaning my body does not love me for eating it as much as my mind/tastebuds do and I swell up for a week. That said, when I just have to cheat and have some great bread, this is the place for it. I always tend to go for the sweet breads like the Blueberry Cheesecake bread, the Cinnamon Chip or Cinnamon Swirl bread (GREAT FRENCH TOAST!!!), Cherry, or Apple Pecan bread. Each could be eaten plain but are taken over the top when you toast them with some honey or some other spread. I wish I could learn how to make the breads. Wait, scratch that.  No I don't. \n\nTheir cinnamon \"scuffins\" (if scones and muffins mated) are excellent and hubby likes the cinnamon rolls (not my fave). Even their snickerdoodle cookies or plain honey wheat loaves are good. They have a Florentine kind of loaf that is perfect for holiday/italian meals. Well it's a crowd pleaser but sometimes gets you in trouble w/ the Italian Mother In Law because it's more popular than what was previously served.

I had a CBLT which was excellent. The bread was perfect, and I loved fresh ingredients and the special mayo. My husband really liked the special of the day, which was  a tuna melt.

I might have to go back next week just to get another one!!  The servers weren't overly friendly, but they definitely weren't UN-friendly.

Quaint and cozy, lots of comfort foods.  Nothing spectacular, though the homemade breads are quite good.  A bit on the pricey side and can fill-up with people quickly, especially on the weekends.\n\nDetailed review:\nI've lived near C's for about a year now, and have never stopped-in to check it out.  Folks at work gave mixed reviews - some raved about the place, others gave it a \"Meh.\"  I run past it nearly every morning and they always seem to have a good-sized crowd, especially on Saturdays and Sundays, so I figured it had to be somewhat decent... with that, I treated myself to a breakfast this morning.\n\nI wandered in at around 9:30am on Memorial Day and was pleased to find plenty of seating.  The hostess offered me a table outside, which was a nice bonus - the weather was gorgeous, so I happily took the offer.  I also grabbed one of their complimentary/shared newspapers to read.\n\nA waitress stopped by to ask for my drink order - I went with coffee - and to drop off a menu.  She came back a few minutes later with an acrylic coffee cup and a stainless coffee carafe.  She left to tend to another table; I needed some cream for the coffee... oh well, it was nice and I was happy to continue browsing the menu, sans cream for my coffee.\n\nBreakfast offerings were ordinary: eggs, hashbrowns, pancakes, omelets, skillets, and a couple of extras, like eggs benedict, belgian waffles, and some homemade pastries (turnovers, donuts, muffins, cookies, etc).\n\nThe waitress stopped by to ask if I was ready to order - told her I decided on the \"Hen's Nest\" which consisted of 2 eggs, hashbrowns, and toast.  I also ordered a pancake, and requested some cream for the coffee.  She apologized and immediately brought some half-n-half containers.  We were in business.  \n\nBefore leaving to take my order to the kitchen, she asked if I'd like anything in the hashbrowns.  I was pleased!  C's has some specialty hashbrown items on the menu, but I didn't want to order a huge plate of them... so, when the offer surfaced to add onions, peppers, tomatoes, etc to my potatoes, I jumped at the chance.\n\nFood came about 20 minutes later and looked tasty.  The pancake was a lot thinner than I had pictured, but it was quite tasty.  I found myself wishing I had ordered 2.  \n\nThe Hen's Nest was just \"OK\" - the hashbrowns weren't greasy and featured a nice, crispy char,  but the onions and peppers didn't do much for flavor, oddly enough... I found the entire dish to be largely flavorless.  :-(  \n\nThe multigrain toast was very good - and was probably the star of the entire meal.  The waitress only stopped by once more - to drop off the check, which was a bit of a shocker as well... $12 for my modest breakfast - $5.99 for the Hen's Nest, $0.89 for adding extras to the hashbrowns, $2.99 for one (1) pancake (!!!), $1.89 for coffee.\n\nService = 2 stars (nothing great)\nFood = 3 stars (average breakfast fare)\nValue = 1.5 stars (quite pricey for what it was)\nMISC = 3 stars (bakery items looked stellar, nice outdoor patio, very relaxing)\n\nI'd really like to give C's 2.5 stars, but I'm feeling a bit generous so, it's a 3-star \"gift\" rating.  Had I been in a crankier mood, it would've gone 2-stars... :-)\n\nFor what it's worth, I think the Hubbard Avenue Diner has a better overall breakfast, and it's about 1/2 the price.  It'll probably be a while before I visit C's again.", "business_id": "B0Vuwn6Hugc-0U5n31YBfg", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-05-31", "type": "review"}

I checked out their chalk board which has their featured drinks, and was intrigued by their Green Energy Latte.. cause lets be honest I was in need of some energy.\nI asked the barista what it consisted of, and if it were sweet. She explained it as being more of an earthy kind of taste and if I wanted it a bit sweeter then I should add a shot of Vanilla.  So I decided on that and figured why not try it. I was so in love with it after the first sip. It definitely has an earthy flavor but that shot of vanilla sweetens it up a bit, and it really pairs well with the earthyness. \n\nNow every morning I stop in, it's the same barista almost always, and she is the sweetest. She did have to break the news to me last week that they ran out of the green coffee for the latte, but would be getting another shipment later in the week, which was a sad morning, but I opted out for the sweetheart latte, which is great. Just no Green Energy Latte. \n\nAlso, their smoothies are equally fantastic!

I think that as far as local foods go, like corn, tomatoes and other vegetables in season, it is FAR better than the national chain stores in town, Meijer, Schnucks, and Wal-Mart.

The seafood section is not very big, but they often have a very good deal or two, like Shark or Yellowfin Tuna for $5-6 per pound.\n\nThe cashiers are friendly, and will recognize you if you are a regular.

What is not good is the schizophrenic nature of the service you get at this place.  I can deal with their prices which are higher than they should be.  I won't deal with holding my breath and wondering if the person helping me is going to be pleasant or borderline nasty. It's been that way for sometime and isn't getting any better.  The result is for the most part I tend to avoid the place.  Scott's Generations, the deli a few doors down, is more appreciative of your business.  I'll spend my money there.  Their bagels are better and they have bialy's, too.\n\nIf you are going to chance this place, I have one suggestion for you.  DON'T go in near closing.  Likely as not, you will be told you exactly how many minutes you have before they close.  They are blatant about doing this especially if you aren't ready to tell them exactly what you want at that moment.  I guess the fact they are emptying the cases in front of your eyes is not clue enough they are closing.   \n\nAnother reason not to go there is not their fault.  They are off of 7th Street with the traffic lanes that change with the time of day.  I'll face the craziness those lanes cause to go to the Bashas and Scott's Generation but not  Karsh's.  \n\nIt's rather sad to have to write a review like this.", "business_id": "vaqmESluryt5i4Wbkb6KRA", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-03-10", "type": "review"}

Our ideas were shut down at every turn as \"out of our budget\" or \"not possible\" and we left Honeymoon Sweets feeling deflated and like we'd have to compromise on our cake.   Not happy with the experience, we reached out to our venue to ask about other options.  We were asked what bakery we would like to use, and Barbs Bakery immediately came to mind.\n\nWe scheduled a tasting with Barbs and from the moment we were welcomed into the little shop, what a difference!  We had a great experience!  They prepared four different flavor combinations for us which we had requested, and sat down with a partnership mentality to work with us to design a cake that came within our budget, incorporated our ideas, and made us feel like we would get the cake of our dreams.  Instead of hearing \"no\" or \"that won't work\" from the owner David, we heard, \"that's a great idea!  Here's how we can make that work . . .\"\n\nWe absolutely LOVED the cake that was delivered to our venue, and we received rave reviews from guests.

It was a gift from a friend. It was my first experience with Barbs Bakery. I fell in love! \n\nEver since then If I do not make my own cake or cupcakes I would go to Barbs. Baby Showers, Birthdays or just because moments. It's great cake with pretty good design capabilities for fair pricing. \n\nThe last thing I got from them was for my husband 30 birthday. It was a cake shaped like a hot dog. It was amazing. I think I paid $75. Totally fair. \n\nFor my Mom's 50th birthday I was throwing a huge event. I called for a quote on cupcakes for it. I was floored at the price. I just ended up making my own and getting rave reviews. I made Pink Champagne and Vanilla Bean Coconut.\n\n Not my favorite thing to do when planning a party but I will do it to save a couple hundred dollars. \n\nThen came my daughters 16th birthday and I called for a quote on a cake. I can't remember what they said but it was just hands down ridiculous. So I again just made cupcakes. \n\nFast forward to my Daughters graduation. I find a picture of a cake that I feel is fairly simple. It's 2 tier. Ombre ruffle cake. I said I wanted butter cream not fondant. Which they even said was easier but the price would be the same. ??? Ok then.  \n\nI then said I was flexible on the design once they said how hard that was to do. I said I just care about the color and it being ombre. I said, rosettes whatever I just need to stay in my budget of $150. \n\nShe had quoted me $115 for just the bottom tier and said she would get back to me with the total price and would also try to work something out since I had been a customer for so long. \n\nWhen I went in to order the cake, the cases were pretty much empty. They had some order and wouldn't have the cases filled until Thursday. It was Tuesday. I continued to get red flags. So I couldn't try any cake I wanted. \n\nI want to say the girl working was AMAZING. She was so nice, understanding and even let me have 3 cupcakes to try since I waited so long for help. It's all they had left. \n\nSo they called me back with a final quote of $389. Yep, I said that. $389. Whaaaat?!?! \n\nHow did it go from $115 for the larger bottom tier to $389? I mean even if you doubled that price it wouldn't be that much and the top tier is much smaller. \n\nI was confused and disappointed to say the least. I was so mad that I had waisted time with them, traveling all the way there, waiting in line and going over everything and waisting ink to give them the photo.\n\nIn my opinion if that cake is too hard for your baker to do, you should get a better artist or improve upon your skill set. I don't want to hear cost of labor when ordering a cake. \n\nI didn't even bother working with them as I could tell they didn't want or couldn't do the cake. Why else would they change the price to such a crazy amount.\n\nIt's sad that my favorite cake place has fallen off my list of go to places. I live in the north valley and I have to pass a lot of places to get to 20th st and Thomas. \n\nI won't be doing that any longer and my friends who I have turned onto Barbs won't either. I will personally make their cakes for free before I ever tell another friend to go there.\n\nI think they have gotten a little too big for their britches. The more I thought about it I started to think of who helped Barbs build roots in Phoenix and grow into a well knows establishment. It wasn't people with large pockets. It was lower middle class to low income families who lived in the area. I can't see how those same people could possibly afford to continue to buy cakes to celebrate family events. It's sad. \n\nI gave them 3 stars because they do make some good pastries and the cake is pretty good. My pink champagne is better and they don't have coconut.\n\n As far as decorating goes, they are not even close to $389 good. \n\nI ended up getting my daughters cake, exactly perfect with a slight variation to the decor. Rosettes. It was beautiful and the centerpiece of the party. Everyone was in awe of it and I didn't get it from Barbs. I got it from a bakery a few miles away. \n\n I also paid $150. Right in my budget. The new bakery will get plenty of new business with the amount of people who were in love with the cake. I can't see how they won't. \n\nAnyway, Barbs is good to pop in for a cupcake or a doughnut but that's about it. \n\nIf you want cupcakes or a cake, message me, I will make you the best tasting cake you have ever had and it will not require you to pick your jaw up off the floor when I tell you the price. \n\n;)", "business_id": "vv1uvJRBUqi707TA5GuhCg", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-05-31", "type": "review"}

They provided the service they promised and advertise to offer.  No Hassles.\nIf you want cake, go to Barb's.

I truly believe they are one of the best treats one can have.\n\nWhen I travel (which is often), I find myself compelled to look for the best cupcake that city has to offer. After scouring Yelp!, I found Tammie Coe. It looked promising, but I found it odd that two locations so relatively close to one another differed in ratings and reviews as drastically as they did. So, I decided it was my civic (and culinary) duty to try cupcakes at both.\n\nThis location has Red Velvet, Ooey Gooey and Coconut available.  I opted against trying the latter because I'm just not a coconut fan.\n\nOoey Gooey -- One thing I enjoy about this cupcake is how jovial it is.  It is pure joy in small cake form.  They come covered in sugar crystals -- in a variety of colors!  This cupcake looked better than it tasted, sadly.  Now, it was good.  But it wasn't amazing.  The chocolate cake was a bit dry and the icing was somewhat pedestrian.  Perhaps I've become too much of a cupcake snob, but I sincerely cannot tell a lie -- when it comes to cupcakes!  Truth be told, I feel this cupcake suffered from being a tad too old -- and kept it far too cold of an environment.\n\nRed Velvet -- This is the cupcake I use as my way to judge all bakers.  This cupcake is a classic.  Now, Tammie puts a spin on this classic that is extremely unique.  Their red velvet is not made with traditional southern chocolate.  It seems they use a vanilla based cake for their red velvet.  While I'm not sure that constitutes this cupcake to be called a red velvet any longer, I will say -- WHO CARES!  Their red velvet in a sweet, vanilla cake with a vanilla cream cheese frosting that is coated in red sugar crystals.  It was moist, flavorful, not overly sweet.  It is a very fine cupcake. Not the best I've had -- but it is up there and deserves praise.\n\nOne thing I'd like to point out is that unless you order ahead, you need to buy your cupcakes at La Grange Orange Grocery (or LGO as the locals call it).  The service there was wonderful.  They even let me pick whatever color ooey gooey I wanted.  That being said, when we walked into Tammie Coe (not knowing we had to buy from LGO), we were treated fairly -- cold.  The woman in the bakery looked at us as though we didn't get the memo.  She spoke to us with great disdain and sent us packing.  It really put me off -- but, I try to just judge the food.  And since you don't need to deal with that bakery to eat their cupcakes, I'll just thank my lucky stars!", "business_id": "bsEJKduEgoBhNNNHO4ZHEw", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-03-25", "type": "review"}

The grocery  store was interesting with some offerings from local artists presented in a humorous fashion, a little wine store with really pretty wine bottles and no price tags.  I perused the menu, placed my order with a friendly cashier who explained the process,  was seated at a small table  and eating in around 10 minutes.  \n\nThe menu offers vegetarian, vegan and gluten free food.  I ordered the Guacamole BLT.  The sandwich was served with a pineapple slice and sliced pickles.  The guacamole raised an otherwise run of the mill BLT to a new level.

I've been to LGO for every conceivable meal of the day as they're in my neighborhood ... and somehow I've failed in my writing of The Review.\n\nI'm a terrible person.\n\nThe first time I knew I had a problem involved overnight guests. Somehow they assumed I'd be churning out pancakes and percolating coffee early in the morning. HECK NO. I pushed my friends down the stairs (pfft! to their protests) and off we went. Once they had coffee in their hands and were ready to contemplate making a breakfast order, things were good. \n\nSure, I could have turned on the Martha Stewart charm. But why bother? I have LGO in my neck of the woods. Anyhoo, here's a tip, which is going to kill me to share. There's no need to wait in that monster line in the middle of the store to place a food order. It's true. You can place a food order at *any* cash register. \n\nI just died a little. Everyone that knew that secret now hates me. (So yes! Head on over to the coffee area and place your food order.)\n\nWhelp! An update as I've been prompted. Yes, there are two distinct sides to this operation. The \"Grocery\" (right side) where you queue up for breakfast and lunch. The \"Pizzeria\" (left side) where there is everything else. But I don't see a distinct separation. So my review below is of my top faves. Yes, you have to order the items below on the left side. But you can eat them any where you'd like! When you order breakfast/lunch you usually end up meandering over to the left anyhoo, so there ya' go!\n\nFOOD\nI'm already a notoriously long writer. So I'm just cherry picking two favorite food items. The roasted chicken and the smoked salmon salad.\n\nPor quoi?\nWell, I had never eaten a roasted chicken quite like the the one prepared at LGO. My supermarket special, which I thought the high heavens of, opening the bag and sighing as I absorbed the heavenly, delightful, smell? That was nothing. LGO's version is an experience. The chicken sighs as it falls off the bone, the skin greeting me with a light crispiness.  If I could recommend anything to pair with this, it would be the caprese salad.\n\nWait? Did I say salad? I found Phoenix's best salad *ever*. The smoked salmon salad was so delightful my dining companion can't wait to order it his next visit. A manly man. Imagine that. A salad that a guy is gung ho on ;) All kidding aside, this salad was filling, fresh and offered a diversity of textures. All while being healthy. Sometimes salads can be...too rich. There was no \"to go\" box. I ate every crumb to my leggings capacity. \n\nDESSERTS\nI stop in here often for cupcakes and their miniature versions when I have a need to impress. Yes, I cheat that way. (Don't tell my Mom!) A box of their artistic works not only look delightful, they taste delicious. Their chocolate chip cookies with sea salt are ginormous. (And dangerous!)\n\nDESIGN STYLE\nThe first time I visited I was awestruck by the novelty of the store in restaurant concept. (I'll update my review to show Instagram photos from here.) It's just the coolest place filled with the neatest things. If you need a gift to to buy, I'm sure you can find it here. They stock books, cards, t-shirts, mugs, candles, purses, you name it. I bet their buyer has thought of it. (They even have a special section for children's gifts.) \n\nWINE/BEER \nOn the Grocery side (right side) of the store where the shopping is there is wine and beer you can buy. Had I not been with a regular I would have missed the obvious. Buy your beverage, meander to your table, drink it. (No fee!) Glassware is in the middle of the restaurant.\n\nPARKING & MISC\nSo yes, this restaurant is popular. Parking can be tight. (But there's now additional parking on 40th & Meadowbrook.) They are bike friendly too! If you have called an order in, don't fret. They have short term parking. Noted clearly with signs and diagonals on the pavement.\n\nClearly, I {heart} this place :)", "business_id": "R8VwdLyvsp9iybNqRvm94g", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-03-13", "type": "review"}

Whether you're hosting friends, you're looking for dinner for one, dinner for two, or just stocking up on goods, you're covered here. \n\nRacks of wine and champagne can be found along a few walls. On other walls and display shelves you can find great gifts or home wares, plus books, greeting cards, kid's toys, candy, and of course food!\n\nThere's a chilled fridge with pre-packaged foods like sandwiches and salads, there are cheese selections, pickled foods, and if you want something made to order they do that too. It's literally a godsend for anyone on the go for any meal, or just about any errand that involves impressing friends, coworkers or family.

I was skeptical at first because I am not a fan of boxed/store bought almond milk. Never fear, they make theirs in house. They use dates and coconut oil to flavor this milk.

I stopped by on a weekend afternoon and had a difficult time locating parking; being naive of the place, I didn't realize additional parking was available about 2 blocks away, as well as behind La Grande; between La Grande and Postino's. This is currently my favorite place to eat. It's a grocery store and a Pizzeria next door. At first it seems compact when walking in through the grocery store. They definitely utilize every inch of space they can muster up to display their goods. The food offerings are wide and are displayed above the counter/employee area from one end of the store to almost the other. The selection appears to be a mixture of French and Italian. I've been a regular for about 2 months now (as of the writing of this review) and frequent at least once each weekend; sometimes twice. \n\nThere's so much to choose from and I've just barely scratched the surface. I've definitely picked out some favorites that I'm having difficulty swaying away from; thus, preventing me from trying something new. I totally love the Coconut Samoan Latte. The small & large are apparently the same volume, which confused me when I ordered the large and my companion ordered the small; the difference between the two is that the large has an extra shot of espresso. I also love the Fresh Fish Club Sandwich, which comes with a side. I've had it with fries and with a mix of vegetables, which appeared steamed. I'm not sure what La Grande called the veggies or if it's a regular side offering (it had a really long name). They have muffins made in the original French-style that I highly recommend. It comes in a bag of 6 for $9. You also need to go for the Avocado Pizza with Prosciutto. The prosciutto is an extra $3, but is so worth it. I had Easter Sunday breakfast here and had a muffin sandwich with eggs, sausage, and cheese. It sounds simple, but tasted soooooo good. I think the butter made it taste so good. And desert....DON'T FORGET DESERT!!! I love the peanut butter pie.\n\nRemember, this is a grocery so there are a number of other items to look through, which makes visiting all the more fun. There's a refrigerated area with all kinds of beer and non-alcoholic beverages. There's also an area with ready-made foods packed in plastic to-go boxes. A coffee bar is located towards the left as you come in. A grill is located outside. I'm not sure when the grill is used. I think it's used in the mornings. There are also a wide selection of wines. Further into it, there are a large number of non-food items such as shirts, scented candles, specialty soaps, books, etc. \n\nThe place has high traffic and as aforementioned uses all it's space, but there's plenty of room to sit both inside and outside. I love how wooden picnic tables are offered in the north of the grocery store. The neighboring La Grande Orange Pizzeria also offers plenty of seating for patrons of the Grocery Store. Outside seating is also located at the front of the store.\n\nThis place is definitely not boring and I tried to cover as much of what I've noticed and experienced so far. I highly recommend visiting if you haven't already, as you'll probably get hooked too. This corner of 40th St & Campbell (or at least I think it's Campbell) has much to offer to the food-lover with Ingo's to the north and Postino's to the west.

Went today around 2:15....it was pretty dead, I was the only customer in there. Ordered two sandwiches, two bags of chips and a cup of soup to go. Not cheap, about $27. The guy that helped me was not friendly at all. While he was ringing me up, another guy tells him that someone in the back \"isn't usually like that\" and that she was in a bad mood because someone else didn't show up for work. My cashier responds to him with \"I don't care, it's not my job to do that\"....obviously there had been an issue between coworkers before I walked in, but to have the conversation while I'm trying to order makes things awkward. My food was ready about 10 mins later and I was just glad to get out of there. We got a club and a southwest chicken sandwich. The club literally had one slice of turkey, one slice of ham and some bacon. Not worth $9. The southwest chicken sandwich had greasy soggy bread and dry chicken...and a bonus eyelash. The potato leek soup was actually pretty good, but the croutons that came with it were burnt and the slice of bread we were given with it was dry and had a dead gnat on it.

The kid (one of the two young guys that was working at the time) that took our order kept getting SO confused and kept asking us repeatedly what we were getting or trying to talk to us about a different sandwich when we had already told him what we wanted. So ordering was like pulling teeth. The same kid went to the back to make our sandwiches and we went to sit outside because the guy said he would bring them to us, but then we noticed the person who ordered after us got their sandwich and left already so we went inside to check on it.... and let's just say the sandwiches looked less than appetizing and I have no idea why it took the so long to make the HOT sandwich  because the cheese wasn't even melted! He also used the wrong bread for each of our sandwiches, forgot the spread that was supposed to be on it, and forgot the veggies. It really just looked like WAY too much meat on bread. Anyway, we brought the sandwiches back in to the other guy that was working and he said he'd remake them. They came back out looking beautiful, but due to the time that was wasted ordering, waiting, and waiting again we had no time to do the things we needed to do in Phoenix before we had to drive back to Flagstaff. That being said, I would still try this place again (which is why I gave it 3 stars) because the person who told us about it said it was owned by two ladies who make everything from scratch and I think they have a great little place, but that guy should not be making them! Hopefully next time the owners will be there. I feel horrible saying that because he was super friendly and nice, but he couldn't stay focused and didn't prepare the food the way it was supposed to be or in a presentable way. Oh, one last thing: there was way too much meat on the sandwiches. Maybe it's just me, but I would've been happy with thinner slices of chicken (we got the Santa Fe chicken and the chicken cordon bleu).

We had a nice dinner at Corbin's and as we were driving home, we talked about stopping for piece of pie.\nI like pie...it's not always about the cupcakes or gelato and ice cream, or even the \u00e9clairs and cannolis. \nSometimes it would just be nice to have piece of pie and cup of coffee.\nI was back east recently and it struck me that you can't walk 2 blocks in a lot of cities in the east without going by a decent diner where you can stop in and get a piece of pretty decent (maybe even homemade) pie and a cup of coffee...not here.\nWe could only think of a couple of candidates...Village Inn or Marie Callender's (neither chain had we been to since we left California, in late 2003). Neither was really appealing, but the lure of pie is strong...too strong! \nGPS said that Marie's was closest and on the way home.\nGPS did not say that this location stilled smelled of stale cigarette smoke from 2 years ago.\nGPS didn't tell me that the reason nobody was at this place at 9:00 in the evening was because it just isn't even very good pie, anymore (or, more probably, it isn't very good anything anymore).\nGPS tells me about traffic ahead and bad weather, but it just doesn't do a very good job of warning you about crappy restaurants!\nIt was dark, kind of smelly and over air-conditioned in Marie's, but we pressed on regardless. Once seated, our waitress came by. \nShe didn't seem pleased to find out that we were only there for pie and coffee (I can understand...there only seemed to be 3 tables occupied in the entire place). She was however, pleasant, and for that I tipped big, since it looked like we were her best prospect for decent tip on Saturday.\nI believe that Marie's used to really think their claim to fame was their pies...I know they were touting \"whole pies\" in the signs as we walked in, but if this is still their big deal, then I am reasonably certain that I don't want anything to do with anything else they make/replicate/serve/unearth at Marie's. \nThe pie was no better than you would find wrapped in cellophane next to the cash register at Circle K. The coffee was even worse, if that's possible.\nHard to say what happened, but the crust was dismal (I don't think I'm a pie snob, but the Beautiful Carin is a baker of the first order, and she makes a vodka crust...that's right, you heard me, vodka crust, you replace  1/2 of the water in your crust recipe with vodka...that's to die for, and I would hurt someone that tried to take one of Carin's pecan pies away from me...I actually growl like my dog: ). \nThe filling in Marie's pies was even worse than the crust...just way too sugary, with no flavor except \"sweet\" and no body at all.\nI like pie! \nSadly, this wasn't it.", "business_id": "0QRvOpNbrHfik3wBupGFmg", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-04-21", "type": "review"}

However, I have been a customer since the early 2000s ... Long before she was legally able to hold down a job. Can I get an amen for all those cake decorators and sales gals out there?!**\n\nI love Nothing Bundt Cakes! Remember the days when it was this store plus one other, so very happy to see that they're expanding. \n\nThankfully, more stores didn't lead to changes in terms of their products, or the personal customer service with a smile.\n\nDelicious, moist cakes, meticulously packaged and decorated and to die for cream cheese frosting is what you're getting into. \n\nRed Velvet, Chocolate Chocolate Chip and my latest favorite: Turtle (Chocolate, Caramel, Pecan, amazeballs frosting included). \n\nYou can sample cake flavors before you buy one. There's always a special flavor of the month.\n\nShout out to the baby sis for my beautiful birthday cake this year!\n\nYou can get a full sized Bundt, or a Bundtlet if you want to provide a friend, coworker, client, etc. with a sweet surprise. \n\nOr if you're a piglet like me and just craving some Turtle cake. Boom, roasted!\n\nJust remember, \"Stressed\" is just \"Desserts\" spelled backwards, so head over to NBC for some sweet de-stressing!", "business_id": "vPJ4iCOSuxCxHPtb18gwWw", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-04-25", "type": "review"}

The owner had no problem scheduling my order on what I believe was a short notice (5 days before the party). I went with red velvet, white chocolate raspberry, and lemon cake. All of the cakes can be described as melt in your mouth moist. Yum! \n\nThe red velvet was good but I like my red velvet with a little more chocolate taste to it. The white chocolate raspberry was delicious. My favorite was definitely the lemon cake. My husband also favored it as well. I think that the only complaint I would have would be that the cream cheese frosting was too sweet. I could hardly taste the cream cheese in it. Too much sugar. Other than that, I have no complaints. Staff was friendly and helpful.", "business_id": "vPJ4iCOSuxCxHPtb18gwWw", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-05-12", "type": "review"}

I tried the carrot cake and the lemon cake.  The carrot cake was dry and flavorless.  Or maybe the abundance of frosting overwhelmed what little flavor the cake had.   The lemon cake was slightly better in terms of flavor, but it was still dry.  My husband said that the chocolate chip cake was underwhelming.  There is too much frosting and not enough cake.  With a mini cake costing $4, I was expecting much better.  Much much better", "business_id": "vPJ4iCOSuxCxHPtb18gwWw", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-05-16", "type": "review"}
