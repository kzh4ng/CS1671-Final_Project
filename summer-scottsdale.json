Its a local and family run business which i love to support! Although the man and older woman who work there haven't given me the best service when I've gone in. The woman talked on the phone the entire time she was helping me and I almost felt rushed by her to make a decision with my order making me feel like her phone call was much more important than a paying customer.

The prices are pretty steep for consistent lunch visits but every once in a while you can stop in here. Average spending amount on lunch will be around $15 after tip. One time i ordered a fruit tart and a small soy latte and I still spent $11. I thought that was pretty price BUT they make everything fresh and there is something to be said about that. \n\nThey do have a half sandwich/half salad lunch option for $7 but prepare to spend $9 or $10 after tip. Its a decent sized lunch for the most but men, you may need something bigger! The goat cheese panini is ridiculously good and their lattes are super yummy.

(You know, hungry and angry.) I couldn't decide where I wanted to eat and that meant my poor husband had to make a decision. Driving around downtown Scottsdale, my husband saw a new restaurant with bright colors and decided that would be the place. Unfortunately, there wasn't any parking out front, so he drove around back. After we got out of the car, he saw Au Petit Four and knowing that I love French food, decided to take me here. \n\nWe didn't look at the menu posted outside, just walked right in and were slightly confused. The space is rather large and sectioned off into two areas - a bakery on one side and a restaurant on the other. A man and a woman were behind a counter in the restaurant side and asked if we wanted to sit down and dine. My husband said yes and we were seated in the completely empty dining section. In the entire building, it was just the two employees and my husband and me. (Awkward...) There was plenty of seating and open space. The walls were brown brick with pictures of Paris scattering the walls willy-nilly and all tables were covered with plastic red and white checkered table cloths. I didn't particularly care for the table cloths because they stuck to my legs. \n\nAfter looking at the menu, I shook my head at my husband saying I wasn't sure what I wanted to eat. After much indecision (the poor waitress had to come back a few times) I finally decided on the prosciutto sandwich and my husband ordered a savory crepe. \n\nWhile waiting for our food, I went to the bathroom. It was down the long entrance hall, passing by several open doors to the kitchen/storage closets. The bathroom was in dire need of some cleaning and restocking (barely any soap and I used the last paper towel). \n\nWhen I got back to our table, it was only a few short minutes before my sandwich arrived and shortly after the crepe. My sandwich came with the option of salad, chips, or pasta salad. I went with salad. The salad was basically mixed greens and salad dressing on the side. (The salad dressing was good, but I expected tomatoes or something else on the salad.) The sandwich itself was really good. The prosciutto was thickly sliced with even larger slices/hunks of slightly melted brie. There was also pesto spread, tomatoes, and lettuce. Overall, I loved my sandwich. The bread was fresh and really hit the spot. \n\nMy husband said he liked he crepe, but he only ate half of it. I tried a bite and preferred my sandwich much more.\n\nOverall, the only good thing in the entire experience was my sandwich. The fact that there weren't any other diners during lunch, the bathroom was lacking, and the \"just ok\" crepe, I can't say that I will be back. There are plenty of other places to get fantastic crepes and fantastic sandwiches. \n\nPerhaps their desserts are amazing?", "business_id": "wftoNIA0Q8nX-Da47psBCA", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-08-16", "type": "review"}

Even when they are delivering it, they put the noodles w/ veggies and the broth in separate containers. However, no matter how many times I have plead for an extra dressing for my salad, it has been to no avail. This may be due to a malfunction between the GrubHub ordering website and the register, but alas, it just has not happened for me. The salads are delicious and fresh. The blue cheese dressing is too thin/watery. \n\nThe bulgoki is very tasty and when I'm feeling froggy I order it for grins and giggles.

Couldn't let that happen, so the wife and I decided to go on a Saturday to avoid evening rush hour traffic.  After reading many reviews on Yelp, and in the AZ Republic, I knew it was considered a very good choice for an Italian meal.  Well I have to say it was a very good choice no matter what the cuisine!  During the 48 hour period after we ate there, we constantly had thoughts during the day and dreams during the night about how tasty and wonderful the food was.  We don't think this has ever happened to us before.  \nThe restaurant was classy, attractive and comfortable, the wait staff friendly, knowledgable and efficient, not at all stuffy or obtrusive.  I enjoyed the double layer of linen tablecloths adorning our table. We ordered their special blend of iced tea, a black tea with lavender, apricot and rose hips,  unusally tasty, an uncommon occurance in my experience.  I should have known if I liked the tea so much, the rest had to be exceptional, and it was!  Since their pasta had received rave reviews, and they bothered to bring a large platter of uncooked pastas to the table like many restaurants show off their desserts, we knew we were in for a treat.  We decided to order two pasta dishes,  Gnocchi Sorrentina (described on the menu as \"perfectly light potato/pasta dumplings floating in tomato sauce with fresh mozzarella cheese melting within\", and Tagliolini Mare e Monte (the tomato sauce had small shrimp, tail on, and mixed mushrooms, with lovely little chunks of tomato).  We told our waiter that we were intending to share the dishes and he brought them out with one half of each pasta dish on our plates, pre-shared you might say.  There was an unbeliveable explosion of flavors in our mouths, the pasta cooked perfectly al dente.  We were like two little kids in a candy store, oohing and aahing as we cleaned our plates.  Next followed our one shared entree,  Salmone in Crosta di Porcini e Porri, described on the menu as \"Atlantic salmon dipped in porcini (mushroom) flour and sauted with fresh leeks and cognac\".  Ordered slightly beyond medium, the fish couldn't have been cooked any more perfect!  I am drooling as I write this review, I can't help myself.  The fish was served with semi crunchy sticks of zucchini and fluffy mashed potatos with a little branch of fresh rosemary sticking up like a miniature tree. We continued to hum throughout this meal.  To finish this gastronomic orgasm I had a double decaf expresso and the wife had their blend of decaf coffee and our dessert choice, a chocolate mousse with fresh strawberries topped with whipped cream.  It was unbelievable how each plate outdid the next!\nChef Marcellino Verzino greeted us as we were leaving and I told him he was a \"flavor magician\" whose magic will be long remembered.

It brought back happy memories of Rome.\n\nWe would be experiencing the Tasting menu ($75 with 3 courses and 3 pairings)  Our server, Scott, made sure we had no food allergies or road blocks towards anything in particular.  A small cheese, olive and salami plate arrived first, compliments of the Chef.  Scott then proceeded to send over dish after dish of amazing Italian classics , like the large, single handmade ravioli stuffed with ricotta and spinach bathed in an almost invisible butter sauce.  There was also some unexpected delights like the polenta strips topped with a chunky portobello reduction and the perfectly portioned filet mignon.  Each was delightfully different and kept our pallettes busy with incredible flavors and textures.\n\nWine pairings were also carefully selected and added that supreme finish to each plate. The tasting menu with pairings are always different, so you can simply come in sit down and relax and be taken care of. No regretful commitments to be made.\n\nAfter four courses, with 3 wine pairings we were quite content to fold up our napkins and call it quits, but there was still more!  Scott finished us off with a beautiful Tiramisu accompanied with freshly whipped cream that was ablaze and courted with artfully sliced strawberries.  The Tiramisu was light, airy and delicately creamy.\n\nLive music on Saturday nights differs from week to week from opera to jazz to Sinatra.

I've given alot of feedback and they have always been patient with me and listened to what I had to say, I know I can be a bit demanding at times but only with companies I plan on spending a lot of money with. There are many reasons to go to Octane A) Karting B) Play Pool (not many pool halls nearby C) Have a drink and watch friends do A or B.   I guess you can even go rock climbing and there is a pit challenge but I've never done either of those so your on your own with that.  Ok on to the racing, the track is narrow (for now) and the Karts are not gas but they are fun to drive and from what I hear the ACTUAL Octane Karts are on their way....which is cool.  I see reviews from some folks stating that they got bumped or they were bruised, etc etc etc.  Well part of coming to this track is understanding that there is a chance you might hit a wall, a fellow driver might bump you, etc.  However, controlling your kart and going slow to go fast truly helps you avoid such an experience.  Those that think they can navigate the track without hitting the brake and without planning their entrance/exit strategy out of turns really need to consider this in their next race.  It will also increase your chance of placing 1st, 2nd, or 3rd in each race.  The track crew is always willing to give race tips and many of them race at Octane on their free time.  I suggest you seek suggestions.  Actually I feel the food got better in quality from the 1st location in Phoenix, I was surprised (pleasantly).  I also like the outdoor patio area to see whats going on at the outdoor portion of the track, kinda hoping for something fun to go out there by the time the weather gets cooler.

To quote the most interesting man in the world \"I don't always write reviews, but when I do....it's important.\" \n\n        I'm writing about my AWFUL experience in dealing with Mark's cleaners. I will attempt so do so succinctly as possible. I dropped off an order SPECIFICALLY to be picked up next day because I was leaving out of town. I made it abundantly clear that I needed it next day for a very important trip. This entire conversation occurred with Brian (the manager). I made it clear that I would be a new customer if everything went well and the service was quality. He said no problem come back tomorrow anytime after 5.\n\n      The next day I show up and the fun begins. My order of course was not completed. The ladies there were in a daze and could not locate my clothes. Everything was so unorganized; it was a mess. Finally, we narrowed down the few spots the shirts could be. I then had to locate them myself because they had no system of keeping track of them. The only problem with that was the shirts wear soaking in this solution that was in the back of the facility. The conditions were deplorable. It was really just an awful experience to have to personally find my clothes in this heaping pile of filth. After 30 mins I located all 9 of my shirts. They were completely soaked! Long story short I took them home with the help of the ladies that were working there. I gave them my card and told them that I expect a call from Brian. \n\n       Long story short I spend 3-4 hours cleaning my shirts at home, learning how to launder my really pricy custom shirts at home with a conventional washer dry. It was certainly an adventure i will never forget. \n\n     Upon returning from my trip I realized I had never received a call. I call Brian (The excuse of a Manager) to see how he could try to resolve my awful experience.  This guy had noting. All he said was \" I'm sorry\" and \" I don't know what else to tell you.\" Completely apathetic to the awful predicament  this established put me in. I had left one tie there because we couldn't find it originally. He didn't even offer to give me a discount for the dry cleaned tie. He charged me $3:50 for the tie. \n\n        In conclusion, it's not that fact they made a mistake, or the fact that conditions were awful, or even that Brian was a royal douche. What really made this one of the worst business transactions for me was the mishandling at every step, and the unwillingness to make things right.  I hate writing reviews but this one had to be done in such detail because of the egregious errors in customer service.  Anybody knows that's eventually mistakes will happen at the dry cleaners, but their willingness to fix the situation is what separates the good from the bad.", "business_id": "T9nn0mCUnsYGMqCa_KR6bQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-07-05", "type": "review"}

I think for adults, it can get old.  But the kids don't seem to tire of it =)  The last time I visited, I saw Tom Chambers with his family.  You never know who you'll run into.\n\nThe park itself is fantastic.  It has everything from a soft rubber padded playground, swings, slides, sand, water features, two sizes of trains that run (both fun to ride), a carousel, stores, food, shade, sun, air, room to move around and mountain views.  Everyone comes to this park.  Visitors are very diverse and there are musical events in the evenings during certain times of the year.", "business_id": "X3icXUyW9vS4UXY6V_MR4w", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-07-22", "type": "review"}

They're such a great escape from what is a hot asphalt city by day. \n\nI think the park is so smart. They water the grass beforehand to cool down the temperature at least 10 degrees. You notice when you walk out that the temperature is 10 degrees warmer as soon as you leave the concert area and head toward the parking lots.\n\nOne more concert left before the end of the 2010 May 2nd - July 4th season is this coming Sunday, July 4th, with Furious George. There's a rumor they're going to have fireworks. The music plays from 7:30-9 pm.\n\nTake a listen: \nhttp://www.furiousgeorgeband.com/ .\n\nTonight's band was Cold Shott & The Hurricane Horns. \nHere's one of their tunes:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/rbrydle#p/f/3/U809HhrgS40 . \nThey're much better LIVE! \n\nTonight was girls' night out. We ate at Malee's on Main beforehand on a Groupon $40 gift certificate (cost $20), so we were full by the time we got there. We brought beverages and staked out a spot with a blanket and chairs. Then we walked around, while it was still daylight and visited with people. It was so much fun. We spotted a dog that looked like a lion in profile. We asked the couple who owned him what kind of dog he was and his name. He's a Chow Chow and his name is Simba. \n\nA group from SYSCO Foods was having a picnic. They shared you can reserve a two picnic table ramada for $25 and pay $5 for a beer permit. But the ramada is on stone and dirt and not as cool and fun as the grass and blankets.\n\nJune 6th was my first chance to go this year, when they had the Groove Merchants. The music was great. We got there around 6:45, so we had time to find a parking spot and find a nice, uncrowded grassy area to spread out our chairs and blanket on. If you want space without kids and people walking too close, spread out a blanket in front of your chairs. You can stretch out your legs and have room for your goodies and to stand up and dance to the music.\n\nThe Groove Merchants concert was a date night. It really helps you get to know someone when you are packing in chairs, a blanket, coolers and picking food and drink together to bring. \n\nHopefully, you get consulted or you ask the person going with you what they'd like. Dates who don't ask what you want? Unless they know your taste, if they don't ask what you like, speak up and tell them. If they continually don't ask what you'd like on other dates, too, take note. If you give them a chance to please you, they probably will. :) And, if you go out of your way to do something special for them, too, you'll make a heck of a duo, if you don't already!\n\nTo find next year's McCormick-Stillman Railroad Park concert schedule:\nhttp://therailroadpark.com/events.htm . It may not be posted until closer to next season.\n\n\nPS Kids and parents were taking a mini train around the park during the concert. I've never felt drawn to that activity. Maybe if the Monkee's were playing. :) \n\nThey sell neon bracelets/necklaces that seem to create competitions for parents to construct the best baseball hats, bracelets and crowns for their kids to run around in. Maybe it's so they can find them in the dark. The kid play area seems to all be on the right side of the stage, so if you stay left or toward the back, you'll have a pretty kid-free night.", "business_id": "X3icXUyW9vS4UXY6V_MR4w", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-06-27", "type": "review"}

Not that there was many tables and chairs available. You can buy food from their stalls but it is located on the other side of the park.

You can view a small video about it inside, see what they used equipment wise on display case and enter a small train to see it for yourself.

A year ago we went to the Mesa store to purchase a digital piano, where we were greeted by music from the store speakers that was so loud it was nearly impossible to communicate, let alone hear the sound quality of the pianos. The piano we wanted was not in stock and we were directed to the Scottsdale store. What a difference! While there was music playing, it was at a level allowing for conversation. During our brief visit to pick up the piano (it was set aside for us) the staff was helpful and friendly.\n\nFast forward to last week. Again I found myself in need of another digital piano. (The first one was a gift.) I did not even consider the much closer Mesa store. As I walked into the Scottsdale store, the music was again at a conversational level and the staff was excellent. My only complaint when I got home was that the fold-able stand for the piano was unstable. I packed up the stand and returned to the store. Not only was there no problem exchanging the stand, but the store employee took 10 minutes to assemble the stand in the store to make sure it was acceptable before I took it home.

On two occasions, my gel manicure started peeling off only a few short days after getting them done.  Long story short... I went recently and they used a stale bottle of gel polish, leaving my nails thick & the color uneven.  The woman helping \"fixed\" the problem by putting regular nail polish on top of the gel (which as anyone with gel experience should know, peels right off).  She insisted that I come back if it peeled off.  Less than 48 hours later, it started coming off, so I went back.  She re-did my gels with a fresh bottle of polish in a nearly identical color by a different brand, per my request.  I offered to pay; she would not accept payment other than an additional tip (after my 20% two days prior).  \n\nI went back for my usual appointment today, only to find my nail tech (one who sits in the front far left corner-- different girl from last time) argue with me out of nowhere when I asked for an additional swipe of top coat on one nail.

Then, she screamed (yes, screamed) that  the last time, I came in asking for my nails to be re-done days later in a \"new color\" (i.e. my asking to not use the same stale polish), and that I should stick to regular polish so that I can change the colors myself.  I told her that I am paying for a service, a loyal client, tipping generously, and I expect them to look great-- not to mention never coming back.

I guess I've seen too many news stories about puppy mills and the horrible treatment of animals in pet stores.  I came to Petco for one of their adoption events and discovered a friendly place with a wide range of knowledge.  For starters, Petco doesn't sell dogs.  They prefer to partner with local charitable organisations.  I like that Petco links up with area shelters to find great dogs (and cats) homes.  My little pup was a rescue dog and has been one of the best dogs ever.  Enough of that.  This isn't a review of the Cutest Dog in the Free World.  If it were, the stars would be infinity googleplex.  Yes, that's an approximate rating.  \n\nAfter I'd decided to adopt my pup, I took her inside to get her the necessities.  The associates provided excellent assistance, from helping me select the right toys (educational vs. destructive), food (natural and with no additives), bedding (comfy and small enough for a little dog), and even presented us with coupons and treats.  It's obvious that the people who work there love animals, as everyone came up to provide pets and advice.  One would think that should be a prerequisite, but I have visited places where the staff seemed to hate animals.  Petco in Scottsdale was not of this ilk.  They even selected coupons that would reduce our final total, which is a nice touch.  Each time we've returned, we've gotten the same exceptional service.  The pup always gets petted and is excited to enter with me, and I am offered a great experience.\n\nWell done, my new animal friends!

Fine.  I bought The Works wash. That is 2 grades up from their basic wash. Cost me $18.99 + tax. That's not like super cheap for a car wash, right? Could expect something? Or maybe I'm way off base.\n\nThe Works supposedly includes the basic wash, sealer wax, triple foam polish, tire dressing, air freshener, clear coat polish, deep clean dash/console/cup holders, exterior dressing, dress dash and console w/SunGuard protective coating.\n\nSo it's a minivan and we borrowed it for a trip to Flagstaff & the Grand Canyon. We have 2 little kids so went for the higher end wash. Needed a bit of TLC. Some debris on the carpet, some drippage in the cup holders, etc.\n\nSo watched the van come out of the wash and pull up to the wipe down location. Sat there for quite a while. Was even thinking that it was taking a long time but maybe they take a long time so you think you're getting your money's worth. I did notice the main guy on the car going back to the dash over and over and over again.  Then to the front windshield over and over again. Kind of seemed like he was milking it, which is fine (as long as the car was clean).\n\nWell I had my tip ready and walked up to the car and figured I'd just check it out before handing it over.  Once I looked in, I went from surprised to frustrated to outright bitter.  \n\nThe windows weren't super clean. Ok fine. Windows are a pain in the rear to clean perfectly. \n\nThere was debris, loose debris, all over the floor. I also get that stuff gets stuck in the carpet. This was not that.  Cup holders were full of debris. One of the main reasons to upgrade to \"the Works\" was to get the cup holders at least a once over. Both middle row chairs had been folded down. Of course they didn't bother to open them up and check. Loose debris all over the seat.\n\nThere was spillage on the walls in the back by the cup holders (kids) and spillage on the leather strip at the bottom of the sliding doors on each side. Now I don't expect them to go crazy for $20 but they didn't even try. \n\nI ended up grabbing a rag and spending 10 minutes cleaning and wiping down the car myself.\n\nThen I drove back over to the vacuum station and asked them to turn it on.  I spent another 5 minutes vacuuming the car. I did a little extra (pulled up the floor mats and such) but I definitely didn't expect that.  I at least expected them to get up the loose debris on the carpet, not the stuck stuff that you have to suss out with the vacuum head.\n\nOf course when I got home later and looked in the trunk area, that hadn't been touched either.\n\nThe dash they spent so much time pretending to wipe was a mess as well. Blotchy uneven application of who knows what. Some areas had no coverage & others were almost wet.\n\nWhen I was vacuuming the car, the manager on duty came over and I told him I was bitter. Told him what wasn't done and what I was doing. He took a look and agreed that it wasn't a good job.  He asked if I wanted someone else to do it. I said no and kept on.  \n\nWhen I was pulling out, he was standing around, didn't come up again. I drove over to him & again said I couldn't believe the quality of their work. He said next time I come, tell them his name and say he said I could get a free wash.  Sweet.\n\nThe other thing that's such a disappointment is that I've been going to this car wash for years and  years. It has been a good while since the last visit though. You can definitely tell something happened with the ownership. Lousy work and complete lack of concern. It even extends to the inside store area, looks quite run down.", "business_id": "gnBgJD6LYsYhSneYVFDmhw", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-06-08", "type": "review"}

It's easily the best in town.  Over the past 2 months, I've had to bring 3 of our cars in here for service.  In all 3 cases, they did a great job and saved us a ton of money.\n\nOne of our cars was intermittently having trouble starting.  The Wife took it to a different shop closer to our house.  They looked at it and told her it would cost $98 in labor plus another $300 or so....$400 seemed high, so I told her to tow it to the Pavilions Auto shop.  They looked at it and discovered it was a faulty switch...total damage?  $90....yes, $90!\n\nAnother car had the AC acting up and I took it to the dealership originally.  They looked at it and said they couldn't find anything wrong.....ok, so how do you explain why it's not as cold as my other cars?  Well, they said it's blowing cool air and it's a normal temperature....I didn't buy that answer, so I took it to this shop.  They looked at it and said I needed refrigerant added to the system because it was really low....guess what?  AC problem fixed, total damage $60...ha!  That's nothing in exchange for a cold AC in AZ.\n\nAnother car of mine was sitting in the garage for a few years and when I went to start it, the battery was dead.  I took it here and they discovered it was just a battery.  They could've easily added on a few \"fixes\" to jack up the bill and I would've paid it because it was sitting in the garage for so long...but they didn't.  Total damage was $130 for a new battery.  \n\nI'm taking my cars only to this shop, end of story.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%", "business_id": "24XXd1EuvUswXG--qS5U5g", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-07-03", "type": "review"}

I am here for school for the week and am so happy there are great restaurants in this nice town. Lucky me, my bf is in town for work so I can FINALLY take him to this place that I have been raving out (see Nashville review for more details on the menu).\r\n\r\nThey give you two cheese dips here with sliced cracker/bread and celery sticks. One of them being a gorgonzola cranberry spread. DELICIOUS.\r\n\r\nWe ordered:\r\n\r\nTENDERLOIN CARPACCIO - Although I remember it being tastier in the Nashville chain, this is still very good and better than any I have had in California thus far.\r\n\r\nSEARED AHI TUNA - love it! This restaurant (not Japanese sushi joints) is why I am so hooked on tuna. Ironic isn't it? My bf loves this too.\r\n\r\nBEEF FLEMINGTON filet wrapped in puff pastry with a mushroom duxelle, madeira sauce - This is by far my FAVORITE MEAT dish EVER! They cook it to perfection (remember I am a medium-rare girl), and it simply MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH. The combination of the tender filet and the buttery pastry is HEAVEN in your mouth. My bf LOVED this too and felt it was an exceptional dish. Ratings for this are up there with Nobu.\r\n \r\nSEARED SCALLOPS lobster cream sauce with a puff pastry of sauted fresh vegetables - My bf thought this was very good but not as good as the Beef Flemington. We had the ultimate BEST SEARED SCALLOPS in Paris (at an average restaurant too), so it would be hard to have something that is up to par with that. Still a nice tasty dish. I love those puff pastries.\r\n\r\nCHOCOLATE LAVA CAKE - This is the second best lava cake next to the Culinary Institute of America in Napa. HEAVENLY, FRESH, RIGHT OUT OF THE OVEN. Delicious! And they don't cheat at this one. No hole on the bottom of the cake to put the filling in! I love bittersweet chocolate. Ummmm.\r\n\r\nThe wine selection is great. They recommended a smooth Italian red wine for us (I think it was a sirah). The service is great. Despite how large the restaurant is, the high quality of their dishes remain the same. After eating here, then eating at Alexander's (Cupertino, CA -- see my review =D) back home makes any other steakhouse taste mediocre.", "business_id": "9AbyBqGWHYZC73GlyAuTrQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2006-08-08", "type": "review"}

Many steak places I have tried usually under season their meats, which leaves them bland.   They also try to cook them too quickly.   The reasons for this are really customer service; don't shock the customer, and get them their dinner quickly.    Beef should have a fair amount of time on salt to bring out flavor, and slower cooking to keep the meat tender, juicy and flavorful.\n\nThe appsy were great.  Salad, Onion soup, and mashed potatoes.  \n\nThey have some great wine, although I felt they were trying to be a bit manipulative.

I had a few bites of my husband's ahi tuna which was also excellent.\n\nI'll definitely return - looked like they had a great happy hour menu as well!", "business_id": "9AbyBqGWHYZC73GlyAuTrQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-07-21", "type": "review"}

Because of that, I typically steer away from pizza delivery because I can't think of a good local spot that delivers in my area. But recently, I couldn't find it in me to leave my house and nothing in my refrigerator looked appealing, so I resorted to the quick and easy call to a pizza parlor. I did a Yelp search and found Chizona's which is practically down the street from me. I can't count the number of times I've driven by this little divey pizza shop and always wondered if it was good. Well, now I'm happy to finally share my report with the yelp world: it's more than good. It's delicious! \n\nThe delivery process was pretty seamless. I called and ordered my pizza, paid over the phone and it was delivered to my doorstep in less than the 45 minute time frame they gave me. The delivery guy was clean cut and friendly which is important to me when I open my door up to a delivery person. \n\nSo let's now move on to the food. The pizza was better than decent! It's cut into squares, with gooey cheese and nicely cooked bread. It's a couple notches above par but not quite gourmet level. It's pretty much ideal for a fatty pizza night. I ordered a side Cesar salad with it, but I should have asked for the dressing on the side because it was more like Cesar salad with a side of salad. \n\nAfter my experience and the quality of food, I will definitely become a regular of Chizona's and next time I will be sure to visit the restaurant itself and try the Chicago dog!", "business_id": "n_HvrTuGUgxXJM0yq39-0g", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-08-23", "type": "review"}

It was very reasonable for quite a bit of food and since I love pizza and love helping out locally owned shops, this was a perfect fit! Pizza was delicious, came with a salad and a soda (which I barely ever drink, but make an exception for every so often).  Very impressed.  When I saw the Groupon deal I didn't even wait five minutes before I was entering my card number.  Lunch was on me today for myself and my boss and I have to say, once again I am thoroughly impressed.  The pizza is delicious, the salad is fresh and the prices are very reasonable for the amount of food you get.  The man behind the counter, as before, was chatty and very nice and I will definitely be recommending this place to not only everyone in my building, but to friends as well.  I will also be visiting again when I am in need of a yummy pizza fix (which is quite often for me).

Little Chicago is good, but still not home pizza.  We've been frequenting those 2 places for years.  It was what we settled into as 'good' pizza.  I drive past ChiZona 5 days a week.  It's a mile from my house.  And the name is so campy and lame I never ever even bothered to consider trying their pizza.  Boy, I was a dimwit!  Because they offered a Groupon, I decided to check out the Yelp! reviews -- and I was surprised.  So I tentatively ordered a Groupon for ChiZona.  Honestly, I figured if it was garbage, my kids would still eat it.  They don't care.  Ok, to the point -- we ordered a pizza there tonight.  And I was blown away.  Well, with all the pizza I ate, it'll take a lot to blow me anywhere right now...  This is the pizza of my home.  The perfect cracker crust, thin and crispy around the edges, still firm in the middle.  The sauce has the right flavor, man it is SPOT ON.  And they managed to put the exact right amount of cheese for a Chicago pizza.  Perfect.  And it's cooked right, getting those amber brown spots throughout the cheese... Oh my goodness.

First, she never once made me feel bad for having neglected my teeth for so long. (even though I should!)  Second, I never felt like I was \"just another patient\" that was moving through the chair.  She gave me individual, personalized attention and was very thorough.  When I left, I could definitely feel and see the difference in my teeth.\n\nOn the business side, they made everything smooth as silk.  By the time I was done with my initial screening, they had already checked with my insurance and knew exactly what my out of pocket expenses were going to be.  That amount was also exactly what showed up on the final bill.  I also spent very little time sitting in the waiting room.  I was on time for my appointment and they were on time bringing me back for my cleaning.

I prefer light flavor, dainty size bites (savoring the natural flavors), but they serve huge size rolls....... the kind you try to bite in half, but it all falls apart, so you have to put the whole thing in your mouth, and you chew it for 5 minutes - and all this happens as  your friend starts to ask you a question.\n\nAll this was done as if I was blind-folded :)\n\nIt's a decent place.  Romantic for a date, authentic in local but also americanized flavors.  it was very good for the price and portions.  Not sure if I'd make the trip again, but yelp didn't allow 3.5 stars.", "business_id": "Bjt3rB73dvSDe1XEPEWc6w", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-06-08", "type": "review"}

It stands out among the other sushi offerings in the valley because it has, in my opinion,\n\n- The most generous sushi portions you can find in Scottsdale and the Valley. The cuts are amazing, fresh, and expertly prepared. You get incredibly fresh fish, prepared with care. It is the freshest, loveliest fish you can imagine.\n\n- Really, really good rice, all the time. Sushi rice is tricky. Sakana's rice is just sticky enough to be cohesive, but each grain is distinct from its neighbor, sitting like little oblong pearls. Sakana's rolls are wrapped rice-side out, which I feel makes it a much lovelier experience than rice-side in, as the outer rice is not unnecessarily compressed. \n\n- Lovely service, at the bar and at the table. I see the same core staff and smiling faces that have been there for several years, and they are happy. You can't fake happy for that long! Even though the restaurant is usually full, the wait for a table is never excessive and, once you're seated, the service is prompt and friendly.\n\n- Good prices. You'll spend 25% less on sushi / sashimi and 40% less on beer and sake here than you will at Stingray, Sushi Brokers, Sapporo, and most other sushi places around. It's actually a great bargain for the quality you get - and that is just the regular menu. I also enjoy the Happy Hour roll specials on weekdays, as well as the $1.50 appetizer add-on to an order of Kirin beer. Ask for your \"I Love Sakana\" card to take advantage of the loyalty program.

It isn't often that you find a high-quality sushi place for a cheap price. But Sakana is it. They have a large menu with tons of selections- cooked and raw- that everyone in your party would be sure to love! If you have guests that aren't fish/sushi eaters, they have some teriyaki dishes, salads, and miso soup, which is really good!\n\nThe first time my boyfriend and I came here, we ordered from the happy hour menu, which is really valid from open-close with the exception of on the weekends. The waitress brought us each a complimentary bowl of miso soup, which was a nice touch! \n\nThey have a pretty decent variety on their happy hour menu, ranging from simple California rolls to Las Vegas rolls and other deep-fried, artistic creations. Thinking that the happy hour rolls were going be super small (being that the highest price on the menu was $5/$6) we initially ordered 8 rolls. When our waitress picked up our order card, she was kind enough to tell us that the happy hour rolls are quite large and that 8 was way too much! So, we took her advice and cut our order in half. I was a little skeptical of whether or not the rolls were really small or not, but to my surprise they came out and were HUGE! Each roll comes with about 6 pieces, but the pieces are thicker and larger in diameter than your average sushi rolls! \n\nThe sushi is of obvious fresh quality. The ingredients as well are fresh. It's the worst when you get rolls that have brown avocado or mushy cucumber inside.. ick! The sushi is also really nicely presented. Our four rolls came out on a nice wooden cutting board. \n\nThe second and third times we came here we ordered the lunch special and the sashimi deluxe. OH. MY. GOSH. I've never in my life seen such value! The lunch special comes with 6 pieces of California rolls, 2 jalapeno boats (jalapeno deep fried and stuffed with crab) and 6 pieces of nigiri. Not to mention it was delicious-- all for $10.95. The sashimi deluxe was even better. You get 12 FAT and LARGE pieces of fresh sashimi for $12.95!!! The best of the trio is the white tuna. I really have never had a piece of sashimi so good that literally you don't want to eat it because if you did that would mean you wouldn't have any left. \n\nService is average, food is AMAZING.

On both occasions I stopped there because it was on the way home from my running errands, and because I was craving Sushi. I had been there a few months earlier, and remembered that their sushi was good (not great), that the prices were reasonable, and that their portions were generous.\n\nOn both of my visits this week I sat at the Sushi Bar because sushi service tends to be faster than when you are seated at a table, and because I like to watch the prepared sushi as it is passed to the waitresses and to those seated at the sushi bar. On both occasions, I was seated at the sushi bar immediately, and my beverage and miso soup were delivered very quickly. (The miso soup is just ok.) On both visits, my servers were very friendly, and were great about answering questions, and explaining how to place my sushi orders when I was ready.\n\nOn my first visit, I ordered the Mackerel (Saba) Nigiri special, and from the happy hour menu, Salmon Roe (Ikura), and two Spicy Tuna Hand Rolls. My order was served to me quickly. I enjoyed the Mackerel, and the Salmon Roe. Everything tasted fresh. \n\nI was a bit disappointed with my Spicy Tuna Hand Rolls. Although the portion of spicy tuna in each hand roll was very generous, the seasoning was lacking in general, and there was not even a suggestion of heat at all. I ended up adding wasabi and soy sauce to it for flavor. The tuna flavor was obscured by the mayonnaise (or whatever mayonnaise like substance) that was used to make the spicy tuna. it is not a preparation that I care for, although I realize many sushi places are doing it that way now. I prefer spicy tuna that is just tuna, hot oil, and a bit of seasoning.\n\nThat said, for what I paid, I wouldn't complain. I left full, and the basic standard of good was met overall.\n\nOn today's visit, I really was up for variety. After asking a few questions, I ordered the Sakana Lunch, which came with miso soup, 6 different pieces of Nigiri, a California roll and a spicy crab jalapeno popper. Once again, the miso soup (again, just ok) was brought to me right away. My lunch also came out very quickly, in spite of the fact that the restaurant was quite busy. \n\nWhile the fish was fresh and tasty, and it was MORE than enough food (I skipped the Nigiri rice and just ate the fish in order to finish my food), the California roll was pretty bad. It was fresh enough, but between too much rice, fake \"krab\", and too much mayonnaise - or whatever the binder was - it tasted pretty bad, and lacked any sort of balancing fresh note. I didn't even try to finish it. I felt like I got my money's worth, and once again I was full. It was still a long way from a great dining experience.   I also stayed away from many of the rolls because most include that awful fake \"krab\".\n\nI'd say that Sakana is ok as long as your expectations are not too high. The service was friendly and fast, the prices were reasonable, most of the food was ok, and it was convenient. This just isn't on my list of favorite sushi places.\n\nThe cooked food may be good. I've never tried it..\n\nIt is also important to note that they close between lunch and dinner (2:00 pm - 5:30 pm)", "business_id": "Bjt3rB73dvSDe1XEPEWc6w", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-08-14", "type": "review"}

The \"turkey Ruben\" was basically a hunk of old turkey soaked in grease and put on hard as a rock bread that was brought back to life with more grease before adding butter and toasting the minerals out of it, add a slice of American cheese and a hand full of cole slaw that was thrown in the air and whatever landed on the sandwich stayed, $11 for that is a disgrace.

I miss this from delis back in NY.  It's hard to find them on the west coast.  For lunch my wife ordered their famous sliders (yes, the ones on the Man vs. Food challenge) although she only ate one of them.  They were very tasty though.  I had the Pastrami Reuben which I liked very much.  My mother-in-law had some Matzah ball soup... to be honest I didn't care for that very much... (and yes, I grew up with it and know good matzah ball soup). My daughter had the sauteed perogies which were very good too.  My sons had burgers.... they liked them, but then again, they're just burgers.  We also had a side of onion straws which were OK.  Overall the food was good though.\n\nWe also picked up some bagels, knishes and italian pastries for the hotel room since we were going to be there all week.  The deli counter looked fantastic: more pickles, cream cheese spreads, fish (salmon & whitefish) and salads.... as well has hebrew national salamis.  I felt like I was almost back in NY.  The bagels were good...but then again, after spending the past 8 years out of New York... any bagel had to be better then what I get in California.  I had a potato & onion knish later that night... it was awesome.  Just like in a new york kosher deli.\n\nBREAKFAST:\nWe came back on Saturday morning for breakfast.  breakfast sliders, bagels & lox, pancakes, etc.  All were very good.  My \"All Salmon\" bagel (with cream cheese, lox & nova, capers, onions & tomato) hit the spot.  Very good. \n\nMy ONLY complaint is that we sat in the back room.  It had an awesome mural on the wall of some of the great New York Yankees (which I LOVED) ... From right to left was Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Mickey Mantle, Roger Maris, Reggie Jackson and Don Mattingly.....  My complaint?  Where's JOE DiMAGGIO??  Really?  Ok.  A very minor gripe from a true Yankee fan. :)\n\nMan Vs. Food:  \nAdam Richman was here for the \"Ultimate Slider Challenge\".  He didn't win.  But there is a small wall towards the back of the restaurant which is the \"Wall of Fame\".  I took a pic of my youngest son there as he LOVES that show and always thinks that HE can win the challenge.  Maybe someday.... but there was no way he was going to eat all those sliders. \n\nBottom line?

Ordered the chicken matzoh ball soup, nova plate, chopped chicken liver plates (with bagel chips) and a whole wheat bagel.  \nThe matzoh ball soup gets a 3.  Lots of celery and carrots in a kinda of leaning toward salty broth.  Matzoh balls had no deliciousness about them but weren't hard.  A little black pepper and minced parsley would do miracles for them not to mention a dusting of garlic powder before you mix them.  Trust me I know.  Hubby will kill for my matzoh balls.  \nThe Nova plate had a generous amount of nova with a bagel, capers, red onion.  Nice.  But hubby who is an expert on nova says on a scale of 1-10 it is just a 7.  Considering this is a jewish-type deli that is NOT good.  It should have a wow factor and it does not.  Supermarket nova is not too far behind Chompie's nova and that should not be.  \nThe chopped chicken liver was uneventful.  I left most of it.  Lacking in chopped egg and onion and perhaps Schmaltz.  Does anyone use schmaltz anymore?  Finally and sadly,  I cannot get a good bagel at a bagel/jewish deli????? Are you pranking me? Was there a hidden camera in Chompie's catching my reaction when I tasted the \"whole wheat\" bagel.  It was sooooo mealy I cannot begin to describe it to you.  I expected to able to crunch into my toasted whole wheat bagel.  When I asked the waitress about it, she said it was a multi-grain/whole wheat bagel--they kind of combine it.  Ah-ha!!!!!  My bagel radar does not deceive me.  It was the most awful texture I have even experienced in a bagel.  As a kid I used to buy frozen \"Lender's\" bagels and toasted them.  I will tell you right now that the whole wheat Lender's bagels was 1000% (not a mistake I wrote one thousand) better than what I experienced today at a Chompie's.... R U kidding me.?

This Ulta has the worst customer service that I have ever experienced, on several occasions I have walked into the store and seen a group of employees gathered around the counter talking and not one person says \"Hello\" or asks if I need any assistance, I am completely ignored. \n\nI was in the store recently and had my arms full of various products and I needed a basket. Two different employees walked past me, looked down at my full arms and then just kept walking without a word. \n\nThen when I went to check out, there were three girls behind the counter and only one was checking out another customer. The other two were talking and completely ignored my existence. I was standing in the queue area waiting to be called forward and they just continued talking so I finally walked up to the register and asked if she was open and instead of apologizing or even smiling, I just received a dirty look and she didn't say one word to me the whole time I was checking out, just silence and then not even a \"have a good day\" when she handed me my receipt. \n\nNot only is the customer service terrible, I receive the worst haircut of my life. I realize that an Ulta salon isn't going to be the fanciest place in the world but I only needed a trim to get rid of some dead ends which I figured would be easy enough. The girl that cut my hair made it seem like it was her first time ever picking up a pair of scissors, her name was Krista or Kristie, something along those lines. After she washed my hair, I told her that I just needed a quick trim and I wanted the overall shape to remain intact. I generally don't monitor haircuts so I didn't pay too much attention to what she was doing but I was embarrassed to walk out of this appointment. She had cut my hair straight across like she had made one cut. In addition to this, I told her that my bangs were a little long for my taste and I asked if she would trim them, she looked terrified when I asked her to do this and she took my side bang in her hand and made one chop straight across that looked ridiculous, and started to say that we were all done. I insisted that she correct the straight across cut she had made to my side bang and she just completed ruined them. I had to wear my hair pulled up into a bun until I was able to go to a different salon to correct what she had done. This was especially upsetting because I had this awful haircut only hours before I left on vacation to celebrate my one year anniversary. \n\nI'm extremely disappointed with this location. Even though it's so close to my house, I will never be returning.", "business_id": "Ev7SSJgjlJilCwaYSGzOcg", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-06-09", "type": "review"}

After I moved to Scottsdale in 1999, I became a serious regular and found Houston's to be a 5 star experience every time.  It was a great relationship until the changes started a few years ago.  First, their wonderful Filet disapppared for awhile, unimpressive sushi was introduced, then the Shashimi Tuna Salad disappeared, and the Phoenix location was rebranded as Hillstone.  (I ate at Hillstone twice and then gave up on it...corn on the caeser salad - a southwestern Shashimi Tuna Salad - really?)  But back to Scottsdale, where I have the most history and the strongest relationship.  They had wonderful staff who, even if I wasn't around for awhile, remembered my name and nearly all of my preferences.  Every one of them have recently left.  Service now is ok, but not great.  A high level of attentiveness is a thing of the past.   Of course, over the years the prices have increased but in the last few they have really been increasing, while portion sizes on items like salads, have dwindled.  Houston's has never been inexpensive, but I am happy to pay to have the food that I want.  Therein lies the rub.  My last two visits were so bad that I am determined not to go back.  \n\nMy very favorite - the shashimi tuna salad - is history again.  Although the offered, if I wanted to pay the price of the $24 Flying Tuna Platter, to fix me something sort of like it, but not with the dressing or other elements that I loved.  I ordered fries, but they have lost their snap, and I had to pick little bits of fiber off of them.  The manager explained that they were burlap fibers from the bags that they use.  I didn't eat them, and was not charged for them.  I eat early, but can no longer get a baked potato at 2pm - and where did the pork chop go?  No more 1/2 glasses of wine.  So on my very last trip, not finding anything that we came for on the menu after 13 years of dining, my friend and I decided to go with the tortilla soup rather than just leaving.  It was far too salty...not something I have ever experienced at Houston's.  Of course, they did not charge us for the \"meal\".  No reason to ever go back now.\n\nLeaving Houston's with an empty stomach, I considered stopping at Bandera, another Hillstone property.  I quickly wrote off that idea since they've tinkered with their menu items so much that I gave up my \"regular\" status there in 2010.  \n\nI believe that the Hillstone Restaurant Group has made some awful choices over the past few years, making changes to long time favorites that ruin the dining experience.  Perhaps new chefs can't just leave a good thing alone or need to put their stamp on it.  I saw this in another review and couldn't stat it better - \"I understand menu changes happen but it was so good and so the same for so many years why do they have to switch it all up now? Pretty sure the business model was working just fine. \"  \n\nAs steep as Houston's prices have been over the years, I didn't mind paying for great food and great service.  I'll probably go in for a fillet a couple of times a year, but I'll have to wait until it's crowded at 5pm to have a baked potato with it.", "business_id": "jBb5KHHAj4s8hcXVS6QXDg", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-06-29", "type": "review"}

Although cooked to their specification, the chops were very moist and super flavorful. One ordered the maple glazed carrots as an accompaniment to the 2 large chops - and he nearly licked his plate clean. One of the standards are the ribs - they are consistently fall-of-the-bone delicious. It's a large order so plan on taking some home. The cole slaw was not as good as I remember, but that's a minor point (apologies to slaw aficionados!) The salmon was perfectly prepared and delicious. For dessert, we had the key lime pie which was not overly sweet, and had a nice balanced lime flavor; and some kind of hot brownie concoction with ice cream...yummmm.

The answer was \"we can't do that\".  Why not?  Is the salad pre-prepared with dressing on it?  One of us wanted that salad with salmon instead of chicken.  The answer was \"we can't do that\".  Why not?  This doesn't even deserve any further discussion.\nThe fact that we will never set foot in your restaurant again will have absolutely no impact on you at all.

We were not disappointed but we were impressed by the food, service and ambiance of this upscale establishment.\n\nWe arrived around 6:30 pm and were told there was an hour wait so we briefly left to check into our hotel and returned about a half an hour later and the place had almost completely emptied out so we were immediately seated in quiet, large booth against the wall overlooking the restaurant where we were quickly greeted by our friendly and attentive server Bryn.  When we told her this was our firs visit to Houston's and that we really like Bandera, she assured us she would make our visit memorable which she more than succeeded in doing.  We had cocktails in martini glasses and she returned with two fresh super icy glasses and poured our remaining drinks into them.  Nice touch.\n\nI greatly enjoyed their BBQ ribs and my wife who doesn't eat meat ordered their vegetable platter which comes with a choice of three prepared items all of which were much to her liking.  No room for dessert but I'm certain they're as good as their entree items.\n\nLove the dark coolness of Houston's.  Lots of dark wood and subdued lighting.  Very romantic and private.

It was my absolute favorite place to eat on at least a weekly basis due to the excellence and consistency of its food and its staff. I nearly always ate at the lovely bar because of the attentiveness and great service from the bar staff. They knew who I was, knew what I drank, and always remembered how I liked my food prepared. It was well worth the price.\n\nThen, a few years ago, the menu began to morph into something quite different. Sushi showed up. The Sashimi Tuna Salad disappeared and then reappeared in a modified fashion before disappearing again. The Sushi (which wasn't all that) went away. They changed the Filet preparation. The list goes on.... \n\nThey began to fail in terms of general food preparation - overcooking some foods, forgetting ingredients, over-salting, food not as ordered, etc. - sometimes after multiple attempts. The staff also began to turn over, and new staff appeared apt to linger having long conversations while I, and others, had to work to catch their attention and be served. The staff still smiled, but friendly, attentive, \"all about the customer\" service ebbed remarkably.\n\nHouston's lost its allure as their standards, menu, food and service deteriorated even as the prices continued upward. At the end of 2012 I stopped visiting Houston's for months at a time, and except for one decent visit in 2014, my experiences have been unsatisfactory.\n\nLast week, craving French Dip and Fries, I decided to try one last time. It was a complete dining disaster. The fries were completely different that ANY I have ever eaten at Houston's. They were not thin, crisp, or even remotely golden in color. They were a thicker cut, limp, barely salted, tasteless, somewhat oily and unappetizing in appearance given their color and \"bubbled\" surfaces. \n\nWhen I finally got my server's attention she told me that they had changed the potatoes and the cuts (like I couldn't see that). When I asked her why, she told me they always had, depending on where they were able to source them. She offered to bring me a different side, but I declined since I had an untouched French Dip in front of me which I was certain would be plenty for me to eat.\n\nI turned to my French Dip, my mouth ready for a delightful treat, and I got a mouth full of mushy meat. As I chewed, I struggled to understand what was going on. I hadn't dipped my sandwich into the au jus yet so that wasn't it. I finally realized that I had just eaten a mouthful of fatty meat. An experience I have never had with Houston's French Dip in over 15 years, and never want to have again. At that point I was done. The taste in my mouth was awful. \n\nA second server had appeared at the bar, noticed that I had pushed my plate away, and came over to me immediately to see what the problem was. I explained that the quality of the fries, and the fattiness of the French dip were not working for me. She quickly brought me a menu so that I could select something else to eat, and had the manager come over to assist me.\n\nThe manager very nicely informed me that she could request that the kitchen prepare me a French dip sandwich from a leaner part of the prime rib, as if I should have known to ask for a \"lean\" French dip sandwich when I'd ordered, when I'd never in 15 years had to do. Really? Just like I should have known to order \"crisp\" french fries when they had always been crisp before? I explained that the experience of that mush in my mouth had completely put me off of any urge for French Dip, and that I would find something different to order.\n\nWith most of my favorite items gone from the menu, and desperate to avoid anything fatty at that point, it took me a few minutes to settle on the Loup de Mer (grilled sea bass). It arrived quickly, and was well presented, but once I got past the edges of the fish, it was clear that it was undercooked. Most of the fish, beyond the surface, was translucent. I understand that this was probably sushi quality sea bass, but I didn't order sushi, or even seared sea bass. I could not eat raw fish. \n\nTired of returning food, I tried to make it look as if I had eaten some, covered it with my napkin, paid my tab, and began to consider where I would eat before going home. \n\nI am only writing this much to illustrate why I had to give Houston's only one star.

When dealing with any situation that has both good and bad points I always take the bad first.  Here it goes:\nEven though the staff was friendly I was giving only a spare few minutes to scan the menu before the waitress was back asking for my order.  I was a server for years and it is bad form to ask someone for their order while the menu is still open in their hand and it is obvious they are reading it.  When I asked for some more time, it was given to me but I felt it was somewhat reluctantly which lead to feeling more rushed.  So I rushed and ordered something so stupid and the moment my order was out of my mouth I regretted it, tacos.  I know, horrible!  I don't know what I was thinking, I was hungry, only a granola bar was eaten to satiate my hunger hours ago.\nTaco Bell is better, these had very little meat, one was so scarce I wasn't sure if the meat was left off until I bit into it.  The meat iself left the tacos sitting in a pile of grease, gross.  The only toppings were a sprinkling of lettuce and smidge of cheese.  They brought tabasco to the table and when  I asked for tapatio or cholula I was brought sriracha.  Finally I got some hot sauce that I didn't recognize the name but it was spicy enough. The taco shells were store bought and stale, ugh.\nBasically I thought I would write it off on a bad choice but the bottom line to me is if you have it on your menu it should be good.  I have hesitated in writing negative reviews for other places because I have decided for one reason or another to try it again before I review it.  Even though this place is cheap I know I won't go back there again, hence this review.\nOh yes, I also think it is pretty lame to have an establishment that size and this day and age  letting you pay cash only.  The ATM in the front charges a fee, I wonder who gets to pocket that fee?", "business_id": "68_EJEA9Ibo55EDp3d-nOg", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-08-03", "type": "review"}

Finally had the chance to check this once-a-month feature SL holds every first Wednesday (where an established customer takes along someone who's never been to take advantage of the BOGO offering (buy one, get one).  I was told that this feature applies only towards spa services, but that I'd be able to take Mom in so that we'd both be able to get a shampoo/cut and color.\n\nNow, first I have to say that my first coloring (Feb.) didn't last very long- I noticed fading within the first two weeks!  I thought perhaps using another color-enhancing shampoo/conditioner set after one week of religious use of Aveda products may have been the culprit (perhaps chemicals in the second set caused color to fade), but after discussing it with Rachael, I decided I'd use more expensive color-safe products, shampoo less (I normally wash my hair twice a day on the days I work, and at least once-a-day on my days off), AND rinse with cold water after every shower to ensure that the hair cuticles properly close, but no... Mom and I BOTH noticed significant color fading WITHIN the FIRST week of the treatment.\n\nOther disappointments include Mom's complaint of uneven shearing of her hair; my slight disappointment in the way my hair \"moves\" with the new haircut; the very small pool area out back, and the lack of privacy we encountered compared to the other spas we've experienced while accessing the pool, sauna, and steam rooms, to name a few.  To add insult to injury, the receptionist decided to skip me and take care of the group of older women behind me when it came time to pay.  After a few minutes, when she was ready to direct her attention to me, the receptionist first tried to charge double for the services- basically negating the BOGO offer, but I reminded her that we were there for \"Live at Lamar,\" so she then tried to do a \"buy one, get 50% off the second\" deal, to which I again balked at.  I also added a couple of hair products to my bill, and after I had given her enough spafinder gift certificates to cover the salon services, the products, and Rachael's tip (20% of what TWO sets of cut and color would regularly cost), she tried to tell me that I still had a balance that needed to go on a credit card, citing that the tip could not be paid with the certificates!?!?  I asked how she arrived at this conclusion after I ran down the bill and the certificate amounts I'd given her, writing everything on paper.  She apologized and said she had not realized I'd already included Rachael's tip (!?!?).  Whatever great experiences I could've relayed to friends, relatives, coworkers, and clients about SL's \"Live at Lamar\" flew out the window within those closing minutes.  And then, not even a week later, Mom and I noticed the significant color loss...\n\nI'd hate to have to find another spa and hair stylist/colorist, since Rachael seems to be a genuinely friendly and sincere person, but if I can't come away feeling blissful and know I got great color/value for the money, how can I recommend this spa to others?  How can I go back and pay for haircolor that doesn't even last a week?  Mom still complains every now and then (and it's only been 19 days, for goodness' sake!), and our only consolation is that I can't take her back for another \"Live at Lamar\" experience since it's a feature only good for those clients' friends who've never been.  Hmm... kind of ironic, when you think about it...\n\np.s.  Rachael, did you get your $48 tip, as well as commission from product sales?  BTW, the two-star review isn't a reflection on Rachael's abilities as a colorist, but the treatment Mom and I received from the receptionist, as well as the lack of color fastness of Redken coloring products.  A colorist can only do so much w/ the products on hand, yes?  A coworker told me Goldwell products work well.

I mean, we REALLY needed it. \n\nI have to say, if I could have a swedish massage like that every day, I would take Jimmy home with me. I've had massages at some pretty great spas -Mandara Spa in Honolulu, Red Door Spas everywhere - but I think Jimmy is the best ever. He knew exactly what I needed, got all the right spots and everything was perfect. \n\nMy husband was also quite pleased with his massage. He had a deep tissue neuromuscular massage which lasted about 95 mins and for him, it was the perfect massage to ease his back problems. Sharon was outstanding and knew exactly what he needed. \n\nIt's a small spa but it's much more personable and friendly than some of the larger ones. The pool is small but that's part of the charm. There's a relaxation area with water, tea & fruit available and relaxing music is piped in everywhere. We didn't use the steam room or sauna (too hot already in Scottsdale) but we plan to next time. \n\nPrices were reasonable, certainly more so than other places in town. \n\nThe only downside I found during our visit (and it's minor) were a few loud women who were apparently there for a celebration and were using the relaxation room to exchange gifts and talk and gossip, instead of relaxing. At times, it got too noisy and it's the only room we could sit and relax. I suggest that Spa Lamar lower the lighting in that room and make it dimmer to give that feeling of rest. They might also want to put up signs to turn off cell phones and keep the noise down for the benefit of other guests. I've seen these signs in other spas. \n\nWe're definitely planning on coming back whenever we're in town.", "business_id": "EaziHWcmjm5nGmPF-CJgQA", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-08-07", "type": "review"}

I went here with my mom for a spa day a couple weeks ago. We enjoyed our day but the facilities are just ok. \n\nThe reason I gave it three stars is because the girl who did my facial was great. I think her name was Leah?? Hopefully I am right. She was lovely.\n\nThe steam room was just ok. The steam is preset to go off at regular intervals but for my taste the intervals were just way to far apart. Towards the end of the cycle I felt more like I was in a hot yoga studio, not a steam room. And I love steam rooms so I was a little disappointed. But even the quality of the steam room needs some updating. Several tiles are cracked. One side of the steam room is a constant puddle due to the inconsistency in the floor. I tired not to step over there because water that never drains just seems like an invitation for bacteria. There was also some white substance in spots on the wall that I am not sure what it is. Leftover soap not rinsed off, growth, I don't know? \n\nThe pool and hot tub area are basic. They have some big trees overhead so I try to give some benefit of the doubt with all the leaves in the pool. However, it is much harder to overlook the edges of the pool and hot tub that just seemed grimy. I think the pool service might need to scrub the edges a little more often. \n\nI won't go in to extensive detail on everything because I don't want to feel like I am beating them up. It is a nice place. It just maybe needs a little more attention to detail, cleanliness and some updating.\n\nI would recommend getting a facial here. However, I would recommend going with realistic expectations. This is not going to be as nice as one of our local spas but it is a nice way to spend the day.", "business_id": "EaziHWcmjm5nGmPF-CJgQA", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-07-06", "type": "review"}

(I bet they never let us in there again..Go Judson!)\nI was really impressed with this hotel.  I have stayed many times at the Doubletree near my house for a quick get away in Dana Point CA and that is a pretty good one.  This however took the cake.\n\nAll of our events were planned at the hotel so I really got to know the place.\n\nOur room, 4802 was a great one.  We were at the far end of the hotel, and yes it is a walk, but if you walk through the center of the hotel not along the room corridors it's not that bad.  You pass gardens and fountains and pools and it's something of a pretty journey.\n\nOur room over looked one of the pools and the putting green that no one ever used but I watched these cute bunnies doing the mating dance everyday.  So sweet.\n\nThe room has a large patio and it is covered so you are not blasted by the Arizona Sun.\n\nThe room itself was very large and with 2 of us and two beds, we were never on top of each other.  In fact since it was a reunion, on several occasions I had over 15 peeps in there and there was plenty of room.  (So sorry next door neighbors)\n\nThe bathroom was spacious enough for both of us to be in there applying makeup with no problem.  They actullay have drawers for your \"private stuff\" in the bathroom and the blow dryer is kept in there instead of stuck on the wall.  It was a real blowdryer not a mini with that funky curly cord.\n\nThe tub was nice and the shower had great water pressure.\n\nWe were 4 doors down from the presidential suite which is lovely an a great place if you are having an event. we had 200 in there comfortably and it has a pool table on the second floor.\n\nThe hotel itself reminds me a bit of the Biltmore Hotel in Phoenix and I think was designed by Frank Lloyd Wrights son.\n\nThe banquet facilities were just about what you expect at any hotel, nothing great, however the dinner served there was nice and very edible.\n\nHere are a few things to keep in mind, while there are ice machines close to every room, the only Soda machines I found were near the lobby and a long walk is not what you want when you run out of vodka chaser so stock up at a local store before you get there.  The breakfast buffet is pretty standard but very good although a bit on the pricey side.\n\nSign up for the \"Hilton Honors\" program online before you arrive, this entitles you to a few perks, the best one of all being a 3 pm checkout which can prove to be a life saver if you've got a late flight.\n\nLastly, the hotel has a car service available from the airport for $30.00 for however many people you have which is a steal compared to Supershuttle at $16.00 a person. (We even asked the driver to stop at a 7-11 for a few things and he did with no problem).  The hotel can set you up with this service.\n\nAlso the Doubletree offers a shuttle service at no charge anywhere you need to go within I think 3 miles.  There are lots of things to do in downtown Scottsdale and this way you can even have a few cocktails. And not worry about getting behind the wheel.\n\nIf you are going to be there during the warmer months..bring mesquito repellant.  You will get bit!!\n\nIf you smoke, be prepared..all the smoking rooms are on the bottom floors where the rooms are very dark.  Get a non-smoking and go outside..you will be glad you did!!\n\nI would reccomend this hotel highly.", "business_id": "CD-2yHTSObgvAhW-pYHfMw", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-07-01", "type": "review"}

This Doubletree property looks and is dated. My room, 7211, was on the second floor and when I opened the door, it smelled like a dirty baby diaper (nappy). I actually, looked in to the closet and the trash cans to see if there was a diaper left behind, but, alas, there was none to be found. I ten took off my shoes and the carpet felt damp. Ugh! It's a moldy smell in the this room and not a dirty diaper. \n\nWhile this Doubletree location has large grounds, a pool, tennis courts and a nicely equipped gym, the rooms leave something to be desired. \n\nI actually stayed here twice before this year and both stays were just okay and nothing more. My second stay here consisted of my forgetting something in the room. It took two days and five calls to the hotel to get someone to call me back to help me find my lost item. By then, it would've been too late to find it anyway. \n\nSo, I guess, I'd have to revise my thoughts on this place and say that you should stay elsewhere. Actually, the Doubletree Phoenix hotel at Phoenix airport has great service, provides nice amenities and a free full breakfast buffet.

I read the reviews and got an AMAZING deal from Orbits ($45/Night) so I figured even if the worst review was true, it would still be worth the Super 8 Rate I was paying.  \n\nWhen we walked into our room (7207) I was immediately reminded of the review that said the room \"smelled like a dirty diaper\". I had completely forgot about that, and honestly if i hadn't experienced the same exact thing, I probably would have chalked it up to a nit-picky reviewer. I mean, rooms can't smell like dirty diapers!? How is that possible?  Oh, but it is. When i saw that his room (7211) was in the same little room cul-de-sac as ours, I knew we basically had the same experience.\n\nIn retrospect I really wish I would have asked to change rooms, but we checked in late and really had to start getting ready for dinner so I just hoped it would be one of those musty smells you get used to and forget about.  I wasn't too pleased with the fact that the first decision of our vacation was whether we could get used to the funky room smell or not.\n\nOther than that, everything was pretty nice. I liked the look of the room, the ceilings were wooden with horizontal beams which gave it a kind of cool rustic effect.  Also, the bed faced the huge patio doors, which made the room seem big and open.  The prices everywhere, including the minibar, were reasonable. We didn't eat at the hotel, so I can't say anything about that, but both bartenders we had at the bars were really friendly.\n\nThe cookies upon check-in were so good!  That may have been the highlight of the stay.  Not sure if that's a good or a bad thing. Overall, for the price I paid I really can't complain.

It's just really really aged and dated. I would be surprised if they can make it much longer without a major renovation with all the surrounding competition. \n\nBathroom: oddly configured so that the toilet was cramped. Good sink, granite countertop. Shower was a tub/shower. Showerhead was extremely difficult to turn off all the way so it leaked all night. \n\nCloset: outrageously giant. I would redesign to give some of this space to the bathroom. \n\nRoom itself: really, really damp and musty when we arrived. Air conditioner took until the next morning to actually make the room cold (it was set at 60 for 12 hours before it got anywhere near there). Could be a result of a rather deserted place during the summer? Overall, the furniture needs to be updated. There was a large gap between the mattress and where the headboard started vertically. Carpet was atrosh and felt dirty on my feet. Nothing was new. TV was 20\" generously and 6 feet from the bed, at an angle, making it difficult to see. Gorgeous exposed wood on the ceiling. Great executive desk space. Clean sheets, but not the softest. \n\nPool area: again, dated, but nice. I could use some more shade in the pool area--no one wants to bake in the 120 degree heat, in the sun. \n\nOverall, I  liked the layout. Every room seems secluded from others, which is nice.

So why 2 stars?  Ah, because it's been consistently below average.\n\nFirst off, the hotel is open-air and the rooms open to nature, as opposed to an interior corridor.  During the winter, it's not too bad, but when I go during the summer, it sucks - especially right after checking in and having to trek across the sprawling property (nicely manicured, though it may be) in 120 degree weather.  \n\nI also hate the wifi service.  I tend to scoff when a hotel says they have \"high speed\" Internet because it's usually akin to dial up.  Granted, it's speedier than the 14.4kbs (yes, I'm dating myself), but it doesn't feel a whole lot better.  I'm exaggerating, but if you've ever watched Yelp load over a slow connection, you know my frustration.\n\nAnother issue I have had is the pool.  Well, not the pool in and of itself.  It's the bands that play until midnight or later.  Priceline must hate me, because I'm always stuck with a room by the pool, and always on a night they have a band.  Wouldn't be so bad, except for the fact I'm always there for business and usually have to wake up at 5am the next day.  \n\nNow, I will give this place credit for being a nice plate to rest your head (when the music dies down) and, if you use Priceline, you can end up with a great rate.

We loved hanging at the pool, it was so nice and peaceful.  The attendant/pool bartender was AMAZING!  Please give Michael a raise if possible.  He greeted us, helped us pick the perfect food and drinks, checked on us often, and gave us a great recommendation on local breweries.  Not only was he beyond helpful, he was assertive, and kind.  He remembered us the next day when we arrived and again was on it!  He literally made the pool feel like you were walking into the bar \"Cheers\" which I haven't felt at a resort in a long time.  We are going to make this a yearly visit now and have told our friends how great it was!

This place is clearly, hands down, the best vet we've ever been to.  \n\nIt's a small clinic, with a fairly small waiting room.  If you have a pet who is stressed, you may need a short leash or treats or something.  They don't keep you waiting long, so that helps.  Keep that in mind when you book your appointment with this 5 star (IMHO) veterinary clinic.  \n\nWe had 4 pets when we first moved here and started visiting Saguaro Vet. Clinic.   When one cat developed a cancerous tumor, we had to put her down and I cannot tell you how accommodating they were to us (we have 4 kids and the cat was older than some of the kids, so it was really hard.)  Extremely compassionate.  But it's not just that.  They've been able to get our pets in for various issues without much notice.  They fit us in because, while the situation wasn't an emergency per se, it was somewhat urgent.   And scheduling out for a regular vaccination was also a breeze.  They usually have our prescription food available, but one time they didn't and helped us find a substitution -- with the caveat that if he didn't like it, we could bring it back (even though it was open, which we didn't need to do.)\n\nThey're practical and their prices are reasonable.  They don't try to tell you that you should  have this test done... They usually say, let's wait and see how things go naturally or with this medication before wanting you to submit your pet to a test or to make you pay for something expensive.\n\nWe have not developed a rapport with any particular doctor as we've seen a couple.  They always ask, and it still surprises me... like, why does it matter?  Aren't they all awesome?", "business_id": "S5ZcvZ7_ZeXXeDxHcEPAlw", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-07-18", "type": "review"}

I think the older construction is to blame for that, but the hotel should really fix this soon.  Now, with the first floor rooms, these are not as bad as the 2nd floor rooms, but do have thin enough walls to where you can still hear a lot.  Again, older construction may be to blame.  My advice would be to avoid 2nd floor rooms at all costs and request to be in a 1st floor room with no one next to you.  \n\nGOOD:  With all the times that I have stayed here, their service was always wonderful.  From the moment I checked in, to the time I checked out, I never had one complaint or negative thing to say about the service I received.  In addition, the food they served was also pretty good for hotel food.  I don't usually eat hotel room service if I have a choice, but on the few occasions that I was forced to order in, I was impressed at the quality of the food served and service that I recieved from the room service staff.  A great experience everytime. \n\nIn the end though, the noise factor really is a deal breaker for me, but other than that one negative aspect and the rooms being a bit outdated, this hotel does offer a decent stay.", "business_id": "ZRrIwqIUMII1b2keMI8QRw", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-07-26", "type": "review"}

I'd have to say that the hotel is OK. Nothing special and nothing too bad about this place. The hotel rooms are nice and I didn't have any issues. The room and bathroom was clean and I couldn't have asked for anything more.\n\nOne thing that I didn't like about the hotel is that the hotel is not layed out very well. It was a hike to get from the hotel lobby to our room, which was only on the 2nd floor but on the otherside of the building. The cookies that they offered was a nice touch, but by the end of the afternoon, there was not a huge selection left. \n\nAt night, I also went around looking for a vending machine. There are signs everywhere that display an ice vending machine and drinks (which I assumed would have been a pop machine), but after walking around both floors and only finding an ice machine, I called the front desk to ask about the location of a vending machine. They told me that there was not a vending machine on site and that they could deliver pop to my room if I wanted. (yea right, I was not about to order a pop for $4 and then have to pay tax and gratuity). \n\nJust make sure that if you want something to drink, make sure you buy it elsewhere before arriving at the hotel. They do not have a store on site where you can buy it either. \n\nOverall, the stay was pleasant and I did not have any complaints about the room or cleanliness of the hotel.", "business_id": "ZRrIwqIUMII1b2keMI8QRw", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-07-28", "type": "review"}

We arrived into AZ about 10am, I called to see if we could do early check in and unfortunately the rooms weren't ready. That was fine, when we did check in we got a nice room with a patio. The patio was a shared patio with a view the pool. The bathroom was really small but, other than that it was a fairly nice sized room. The bedding was comfortable. The furniture was not dated and I didn't hear my neighbors through the thin walls as I had previously read. There is free valet parking so on days like Saturday afternoon when the lot was completely full; you just hand your keys over to valet and walk on into the hotel.\n\nThe only true negative is the restaurant inside the hotel is really pricey. The continental breakfast was $18 pp and $9 for a 2 y/o, I mean really what 2 year old eats $9 worth of food? Certainly not mine. I'm lucky if she finishes a complete bowl of cereal so dining there was out of the question.\n\nThe pool area and lobby were my favorite part of the hotel. The lobby is beautiful and  nicely decorated. The pool has a toddler pool which more hotels should make. My little love had an great time splish splashing with the other toddlers. I felt beyond comfortable. They keep the outside pool area stocked with pool towels and plenty of water. While I'm talking about the pool there is a hostess/waitress that comes by the pool and takes food and drink orders. Very attentive, amazing! The bar prices weren't steep at all. You have an option of charging it to your room or paying.\n\nI'm definitely a fan and we will stay here again. Maybe after we stay at the Double Tree!

David doesn't do friendly! In fact, David is down right rude. I would say renovate the pool & add some cabanas for rent; another pool bar or at least some help for Alex , ( but not David :) ) ; and add some more options on the late night room service menu which goes : desserts; coffees/teas/alcohols; kids menu .

I'm not one to really comment on d\u00e9cor, but this was really something out of \"That 70's Show\".  The TV's were great(that's where they get the two stars from).\n\nService?  What service?  I sat down at a table in the bar area and waited for almost 10 minutes for the server to ask if I needed anything.  There were two other tables with guests at the time, so I couldn't understand why it took so long.  \n\nAfter I ordered my glass of wine, I reviewed the menu.  Decided to start simple with the chips and salsa.  I was long finished with my glass of wine and looked around to locate her.  She was at her terminal reading and sending text messages on her phone.  I was able to catch her attention and waved her over and placed my order.  \n\nAbout 10-15 minutes later, chips and salsa came out.  Half of the chips were stuck together and under done.  The salsa was made up of mostly seeds.  Literally, seeds.\n\nFor dinner, I ordered a 1/2 slab of the baby back ribs.  HORRIBLE!!  Mostly fat.  Almost no meat.  They do get some props for the fries, though.\n\nWhen it came time for the check, once again, server had disappeared.   Two or three more tables came in, so my urgency to get settled up ramped up.

I reserved 4 rooms on 5-14-12. When we arrived there were only 2 rooms reserved even though I had a confirmation number and was billed for 4 rooms. I spoke with Mike who was an assistant manager, he got us 2 more rooms and said he would look into the problem and call me when he figured out something. Mike called me about 20 minutes later and said he worked out a solution. He said there would be a $37 charge for amenities which I said was fine. About 15 minutes later I got a text from my credit card company saying there was a $172 transaction charged to my card from the hotel. I called Mike and asked him what was going on. He said it was a pending transaction for amenities and would not be charged if nothing was used or missing from the room. I told him I was already charged $37. He said he could not do anything with the charge until we checked out and closed the ticket. \nNow as for the rooms, one of the rooms would not cool properly and the shower rod and curtain was missing so one of us were moved to a different floor. The other 3 rooms a/c did not work very well. It was only 99 degrees that day so I am glad it did not get any warmer as the a/c would have been inadequate as we had them on max. The suites are a little larger than most suites which was nice. The full complimentary breakfast was nice also. The overall appearance of the hotel is dated and needs some work. I paid $89 per room and would not advise anyone to pay more than that for their 1 bedroom suite.\nUpon checkout we spoke with Dennis and told him of the previous charges and I asked him for a receipt showing that nothing was owed. He said he could not do that. I asked why he stated his system would not allow him to do so. I asked him if he could not give me a receipt I wanted the $172 charged to my card credited back, he said he could not do that either. I told him I wanted something showing that I had no balance with the hotel. He said he had no way of doing that. I said I wanted something because I not want to have to dispute charges with the credit card company. Mike said he could give me a copy of the screen off his computer system, at this point I said fine. I then asked for a manager and Dennis said he was an assistant manager. I then asked for the general managers name who Dennis gave me the name of Tom Silverman. When I got home I left message for Mr. Silverman and have yet to receive a call or email from him.\nThis hotel did not meet my expectations.

Obviously this hotel does not employee enough help to perform the house cleaning function in the times alotted.  Check out is noon and check in is 3 pm.\n\nAt 4:15 pm I went back to the counter and said I would gladly give up my room if they would refund my money.  They offered me a coupon for a free appetizer in the restaurant.  I explained we are going to the banquet and not going to the restaurant.  He said you can use it next time you come back.  I advised their would NOT be a next time.   They checked on the radio with housekeeping and I was told they were waiting for a supervisor to clear the room for guests.\n\nAt 4:45pm my husband went to the front desk.  He was told the supervisor was checking out the room.  He told them to tell the supervisor to get his ass in gear!  Then all of assudden the clerk gave my husband 2 hotel keys.

Apartment reviews can be TERRIFYING, there are some angry renters out there. Here's what I took from my lovely 10 month stay at Miramonte. \n1. This apartment doesn't look like much from the outside, and its nothing fancy for sure, but in my experience the office staff is extremely helpful, the maintenance man is reliable and friendly (eventually I even had no problem giving him permission to enter while I wasn't there) and its very reasonably priced. The interiors are updated with nicer carpet, newer kitchens and they have washer and dryers! big plus for me.\n\n2. The pool is awesome, when it works. They have been having some issues but I do believe its fixed now. The gym is tiny but usually empty. \n\n3. its pretty quiet, most of the time. I lived upstairs and was never bothered by my neighbors noise. But I do believe my downstairs neighbor was slightly annoyed by me (and I am not loud and hardly home.) So Point A--live upstairs. I've found that to be true in EVERY apt complex ive ever lived in. Point B--PLEASE NOTE--THIS IS IMPORTANT--there is an elementary school on the east side of the apartment complex. I lived directly up from the parking lot, facing the school playground, and you could absolutely hear little kids playing in the morning.  It didn't ever bother me because I work all week, I only discovered this when I happened to be home sick one Wednesday. If you work a Monday-Fri 9-5 you really wont notice so I would not let that deter you from moving in. However if you sleep in late during the week, choose your location carefully, don't get a unit that faces the school.\n\n 4. The office staff will really try to be accommodating. A new office manager took over a couple months after I moved in and you can really tell she wants people to be happy about the complex. I lived here while in the process of buying a house and definitely did my share of calling the office staff with questions about extending my lease, ending my lease, month to month options, etc. When my house closed 2 months before my lease ended, of course I couldn't get out of my legally binding contract (no surprise to me there) but I was surprised that they were very helpful about my options to sublease it myself or find someone to take over my lease completely. They definitely did as much as they could. \n\n5. Parking for visitors isnt the worst I've seen but it can be difficult. There are always tons of spots open on the south end of the complex, but in the evenings most of the other public ones are taken. \n\n6. Bugs- always a big concern of mine and I would have no shame in admitting if I found them. (see my other apt review, ha!). Honestly, I found one big cockroach about a month after I moved in, called the office, they had the sprayer come and I never saw another one again. (I lived there for 10 months)\n\n7. charges. They WILL charge you for damages done to your walls or carpets, for anything that is not top-notch clean, or anything that isnt as it was when you moved in. But they aren't trying to scam you. Use your common sense on this one, you get a form to fill out when you move in that lists every detail of every room, FILL IT OUT. Keep a copy. Be present when they do the final walk through and you will be aware of any discrepancies. Just be a responsible renter and you will only pay the standard $35 carpet cleaning fee. \n\nHope that was helpful to anyone considering an apartment here. Granted all experiences and units are different, so if you move in and hate it, whoops. If you move in and like it, as I did, you're welcome.", "business_id": "w4O2f6LEXwWJWn4thL-87Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-06-07", "type": "review"}

I found that the more forceful techniques created a \"rubber band\" effect; my body would bounce back to where it was before the treatment. I also learned that radiation from x-rays accumulate in the body.\n\nSo when I recently moved to the Phoenix area, I was looking for a chiropractor who uses thermal scanning instead of x-rays, and who uses non-force techniques.\n\nI was very lucky to find Dr. Richard Jones. Dr. Jones uses a thermal scan developed by NASA (see more at: http://drrichjones.com/). And, he has studied and incorporated many alternative methods into his practice. The most significant is B.E.S.T. or the Bio Energetic Synchronization Technique. This method feels almost like he is sculpting in clay, reworking and balancing my body.  (See:  http://www.quantum-healing-chiro.com/best-explained)  When he uses Upledger craniosacral therapy on me, I feel the release it gives my body.  I have only been seeing him for a few months, and my body already feels more balanced and there is also far less pain, in fact almost none.

Then coincidentally 3 days later my other tire that is was fine blew out. I came back to discount and they applied a few discounts but still had to pay.. but I guess why I can't give it 5 stars is because one of their employees came up to me after the service and said we try to stay away from these caps on tires bc they can come unscrewed and increase the chance of low pressure and increase your chances of a blowout. He then told me that the last time I was there they may have not screwed them on well... okay well I would have appreciated you telling the rest of the staff in front of you so maybe their would be more responsibility on the location. Ugh overall paid 500 dollars for new tires but just would have appreciated more of a break if their is a chance it was their fault", "business_id": "VrAQFQW17w1PtJx1yx0M8A", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-07-01", "type": "review"}

If you want the short story of my review just scroll down!\n\nLong Story:\n\nThe decision to buy tires was made on a whim. I had been putting off this issue for several month but today my husband finally convinced me for numerous reasons. Our tires were now extremely bald and the rubber had bad dry rot. In addition, the extreme heat from the summer season made us nervous about the possibility of popping a tire! Moreover, we take our 2008 Honda Ridgeline on light to intermediate trail riding; so we were also hoping to upgrade our street tires to all terrain tires.\n\nMy husband had been researching online for tires and, at first, we did not want to go to Discount Tires. Their website had quoted him for $1000 for four all-terrain tires. So instead we checked out Big-O Tires to get a quote from them. They quoted us for about $825 with even bigger tires! We were really excited at first, but when I tried to apply for their financing program they said I would be approved in 7 to 10 business days; which was fine. However, their 'Buy 3 tires, get 1 free' deal was expiring and it would cost over $1000 by the time I got approved. This was when we gave up and went to Discount Tires.\n\nWhen we walked in and a store associate was able to help us immediately, even though the place was very busy. We had the pleasure of Billy to help us find and buy tires. He was incredibly knowledgeable! The most amazing thing? The whole process took less than 15 minutes! He even helped us realize that the bigger tires that Big-O was trying to sell us wouldn't have fit our truck. (I had even asked the worker at Big-O if it would rub on the wheel wells, but he \"claimed\" that it wouldn't.) Discount Tires had a database system on their computer which showed what tires were rated too small or too big for your specific make and model! So helpful!\n\nBilly was able to find us four all-terrain tires for under $600 dollars including the installation fees, but this was without their warranty. Unfortunately it was not within our budget. After filling out paperwork for financing I was immediately approved for $500. This was all done within 15 minutes. The professionalism of Billy and reasonable quality of Discount Tires made it easy for us to purchase some badly needed tires.\n\nAfter we bought our tires Billy said that it would only take an hour for the installation. So we just hung out in the Pavilions until then. The only hiccup that happened during our visit was that it took a little over their quoted time. We were expecting the truck to be ready by 4:30pm but it was finished around 4:43pm; which honestly was not a big deal because it was really busy. In actuality, we were surprised they could even help us and were ecstatic that they could install our tires the same day because the place was so packed.\n\nBut even so, a store associate named Johnny apologized for the wait, assured that they were finishing soon, and thanked us for our business. It was honestly refreshing to receive such personable customer service! When we picked up our truck, yet another store associate, named Jordan, genuinely apologized for going over the service time and appreciatively thanked us for coming in today. Even the worker who put the last valve cap on the tires was very friendly and kindly bid us a farewell!\n\nThe employees here are so impressive. They are accommodating and quick to meet your needs. They work in the sweltering heat and in a fast paced environment. But after everything they still maintain a wonderfully pleasant attitude when interacting with their customers! The employees at this Discount Tire Store are truly outstanding!\n\nShort Story:\n\nThe Good-\n1. Was able to walk in without an appointment and purchase tires with same day installation, even though it was busy.\n2. Found the tires we wanted and within our budget.\n3. Was able to be approved for financing immediately.\n4. Took a little over an hour for installation right after purchasing, even though it was busy.\n5. Their customer service is the best of the best!\n\nThe Bad-\nNOTHING! I'm not extremely picky, but it takes a great business (or very horrible one) for me to write a yelp review. I can imagine some people not liking the wait time, but seriously, its the summer time and tire season is in! An hour wait is nothing if you know how to kill time.", "business_id": "VrAQFQW17w1PtJx1yx0M8A", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-07-03", "type": "review"}

Another words, you're being overcharged for Gas above the pump price, like a Casino ripping you off. They charge for water refills (soda price) at their machines. And, if an item doesn't have a price on it, you've guessed it, --you'll be overcharged too much in their favor!!\n \nHeavily overrated because of the traffic between the City of Scottsdale and freeway. So they take extreme advantage of the access. Beggars are at the Gas Pumps pushing car washes and windshield replacements. This is NOT a convenience store, --your time is theirs not yours. Yes, they have cheap prices on tobacco, but don't get raped on the way out!! Final analysis: Low cut, low class, overrated with some Scottsdale elites that float through once in a while trying to add to their popularity...

It's a beauty, and for only $50, it was a steal!  (Especially w/ this weekend's sale of buy one, get the second for $19.90, well, that comes out to $35* per blouse-- I found a beautiful red one, as well!  The sales rep, Beth, who manned the fitting rooms today, was courteous and very helpful when I needed a second blouse of the same color and size, because the one I had didn't drape as nicely as I thought it could; it also had a pulled thread.  Not only did she arrive back shortly to hand me one to try, but TWO!  She'd left so quickly to look for them \"in the back\" that I couldn't stop her in time to ask if she could locate an ivory one, as well.  Again she went back, but didn't find any; however she did say that if there was one available online to purchase, that I could also get a second one at the sale price!  (FYI, there is a standard $5 fee to have a special-order shipped to your house, no matter if you buy one item, or two...)\n\nAnother FYI: if you ask to keep the hangers that come w/ your purchases, you will be given the option to take them home in a reusable garment bag.  These are not the plastic drape-over garment bags of old, but black, zip-up garment bags that may protect your clothing from fading under the sun.  Y'know, when you forget to take them out of the car?  (Psst!  The Limited reusable garment bags are MUCH nicer!)\n\n[*Shoot!

As my tummy growled today, I was in the neighborhood so I knew just where to go. I walked into a simple yet clean deli. Immediately, I was welcomed by the entire staff (I believe they are all related or at least family through friendship). They asked me if it was my first time in and I said yes, so right away they started giving me a history of the shop and the tasty cuisine. Celebrating their 33rd anniversary (congrats!!), I learned that everything is homemade -- from the meatballs to the chicken salad. The owner said he goes through 40 lbs of chicken a week. He gave me a sample and the chicken was chunky and delicious. I'm not surprised he has to prepare so much chicken every week! The meatballs and freshly cut meat for Philly Cheese-steak sandwiches looked great too! The owner mentioned he is from Philly so better be ready for some authentic Philly and Italian style cookin'! \n\nWhile I was there, the owner was slicing some fresh provolone, so I added that to the warmed turkey sandwich I ordered. The turkey was tasty, the provolone was yummy and the sourdough roll tasted like it was fresh from the oven. It was $8 for a sandwich and soda but the sandwich was hefty enough that I saved half for later. As I walked out, everyone said goodbye to me and I felt like I was leaving a family dinner. \n\nIn summary, here's what made Casella's stand out: \n\n- The very friendly staff\n- It's a local family-owned neighborhood deli celebrating their 33rd anniversary. Gotta support the local businesses! \n- Clean decor \n- Tasty, homemade food that's on display for visitors to see \n- A good family-style atmosphere that greets you the second you walk inside. \n\nI'm not sure how it's taken my so long to find this local treat, but now that I've found it, I plan on becoming a regular. \n\nDirections: Note that this is hidden in the Basha's strip mall (on the side of Granite Reef) but don't let that fool you!", "business_id": "kEyCMHBnohaWc81omLDfYg", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-06-26", "type": "review"}

I normally don't write dissertations, favoring the short and sweet condensed review, so if it's a little verbose, bear with me as it's a story worth reading.\n\nWe've heard about Casella's for years but have never eaten there, usually due to bad timing on our part as they close early on Saturday and are not open for business on Sundays. \nWe finally made it there today during normal business hours.\n\nNot knowing what to expect, we decided prior to going in if we weren't impressed with the menu, or the joint itself, we'd give each other the signal and find another lunch place.\nWell we weren't impressed with the decor, the menu or the overall ambiance, so we gave each other the nod and started for the door. \nThat's when the owner, Joe Casella stopped us.\nRecognizing us as newbies, he told us all about his restaurant,  the menu, and even offered us a taste of whatever we liked.\nWe declined, perhaps being a bit skeptical.\nBut then something interesting happened. \nJoe introduced us to his wife and two of his four daughters (who were on duty) and we were instantly enamored with this family. \nWho does that in 2011? Seriously. He asked our names and even shook my hand. \nLong story short, after talking with Joe for just a few short minutes, my wife and I gave each other a reverse nod, signaling our eagerness to try something...anything! \nWe ordered a couple sandwiches on Joe's recommendation.\nThe food was superb.\nThe bread was one of the best rolls I've ever had and is enough reason by itself  to keep us coming back. Crusty and not overly breaded, it reminded me of the rolls in Atlantic City where the bread is pure perfection. \nSame for the sandwich ingredients, full of flavor and cooked just right.\n\nBut the best part was how Joe came over to talk to us after finishing our meal. He wanted our candid opinion of the food and service.\nIf there's any single reason for me to frequent this place, it's the genuine heartfelt sincerity of the owner and his family, not to mention the food!\n\nSure, the decor is old and needs updating, but somehow, after meeting the family, and eating lunch, I didn't care about the decor, or the no-nonsense menu, or the layout. None of that mattered anymore. \nWhat mattered was the overall experience of a true family restaurant, their wholesome foods, and being in the company of genuinely warm people. \n\nIn a time when most of us tend to rely on first impressions, judging the proverbial book by its cover almost caused us to miss out on the Casella's experience had it not been for Joe Casella taking our hand and welcoming us into his unique domain.\n\nCasella's took me back in time today, when my grandparents would often take me with them to the Italian deli for lunch. \nAs they visited with the owner (in Italian), sipped espresso for what seemed like hours, and ate a slow lunch, I wanted to die. I remember sitting there in the booth fidgeting as they talked, hoping like hell we'd get out of there soon.\nI hated that experience as a kid.\nI loved it today as an adult, but more importantly, finally recognized and appreciated the gift my grandparents unknowingly gave me. \nThank-You Joe", "business_id": "kEyCMHBnohaWc81omLDfYg", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-06-25", "type": "review"}

We pretty much were birthed as a club here and have enjoyed showcasing our cars. It gets a star for accessibility when that's possible and another for the Target, YCs and Yogurtology close by. It would have more stars though if the owners, Salt River Project Police Department and management company stopped punishing clubs that have nothing to do with the poor choices of individuals (those who choose to do burn outs, make traffic problems and ruin it for first time attendees). I've been  asked to leave early twice now for my car (it has an interactive sound system and is a Transformers Edition Bumblebee Camaro). Not a cheap car by any makes or means, but it's not being shown to make this show look good, but for the children who enjoy seeing one of their favorite pop culture characters up close and personal.\n\nI think what's really sad is when assumptions are made and those who go to this show and have for a while are lumped in with those who ruin it. I went to the McDonald's that hosts this show and they have no show guidelines on sight. I looked online and the hours vary from 4-8 to 4-10. On July 13 we were all asked to leave at 10 as the show was over. I was asked to turn my car down to a muted level as my sound was competing with their DJs. In the past I was allowed to showcase my system after 8pm but that's not the case anymore I guess. If I didn't comply, I would be asked to leave.\n\nLike I said I've been asked to leave once already last year for the same reason but it was before 8. If complying by their rules and guidelines after 8 is a problem then they're going to have to make the public aware of it, not make an example out of someone in an embarrassing manner. \n\nBut the biggest problem I have with this show is the disappointment I have been able to witness in a young child's face because of \"management.\" Nothing breaks my heart more than the sadness of a child. Especially when they can't get a picture taken with my car or even try to enjoy it with my family. I watched that last night. I hope I never see that again. Hearing a child say goodbye too early and because of someone else's poor decisions is not acceptable in my book. \n\nI foresee a loss in interest, revenue, attendance and maybe I'll be back. Maybe. There are other shows to go to and I'd hate to not come back because of someone else.

It's time to check it out!  I did last night!\n\nMy aunt and uncle had tickets to go see the show \"Barefoot in the Park\" and I decided to join them.  Luckily, there were still tickets available, and they were not too expensive either!  The show we saw was in the intimate (60 seat) Actor's Cafe.  (There is also a larger, in-the-round, main theatre that is great for children and currently showing there is Cinderella).\n\nBefore I tell you about the show itself, I must tell you what a pleasure it was to drive up at 7pm, park in the adjacent parking lot, pick up my ticket at will call, and walk right in... easy, smooth process - it was great!  Since the seating is first-come, first serve, the doors open around 7 so I advise getting there early.  Luckily my Aunt and Uncle were in line already when I arrived and we chose comfy seats... (not that there is really a bad seat in the house, but if you want seats together, etc... go early!)  \n\nNow... on to the show - it's a romantic comedy about a newlywed couple that moves into a tiny little apartment together - the problem is, it's a climb up 5 flights of stairs!  The couple, Paul & Corie, play their roles really well and the other characters including Corie's mom, Mr. Velasco (the upstairs neighbor), and the telephone delivery guy are awesome too.  I don't want to say too much, other than tell you that we had plenty of laughs; with a tiny little stage and a 5 person cast, i was entertained the entire time... Produced by Neil Simon, this show explores the thin line between love and hate!  I was told that the story line came from a movie in the '70s, supposedly Robert Redford and Jane Fonda starred in it.  I'll have to rent it now!\n\nA few other comments:\n - I didn't have to wait in line for the bathroom and I went twice!  (it was clean too!)\n- I didn't have to wait in line for concessions at intermission and the markup was small... only $1 for a bottle of water!\n- friendly people everywhere including after the show when the cast greets you as you leave...\n\nI'll for sure be back to Desert Stages for upcoming productions - if you like intimate theatre, go check it out!

We saw \"The Mousetrap\" last year and \"Biloxi Blues\" tonight.  Although we had seen \"The Mousetrap\" before (in London), it's been almost 40 years and it was time for a review.  Enjoyed the production in 2013.  Tonight neither of us had ever seen a production of Neil Simon's autobigraphical second part of the three part triology, bookended by \"Brighton Beach Memoirs\" and \"Broadway Bound.\"  The cast was delightful, and it was interesting to note that a couple of the actors had just recently finished high school (sorry, but it showed and they are gaining valuable experience.)  The lead actor who played Eugene, who also narrated directly to the audience, was delightful and quite a talent, as well as the actor who played the sergeant (although it was scary to be this close to him in this small space.)  The theatre is very small, seating maybe 80 people at best, and seating is flexible (or \"festival seating,\" as I like to call it, but I ordered the tickets online ($6.00 fee) and printed out my actual tickets with bar codes on them to present at the door.  However, the doorman asked if I had stopped at the box office on the way in, and when I told him no, he asked for our names so he could tell them.  Unclear that we were expected to report to the box office since it appeared that the tickets printed were actual replicas of tickets with bar codes.  It was not clearly explained on the web site that we were expected to report to the box office, and we were not clear on the festival seating either, or we would have arrived earlier so we didn't have to get stuck on the front row with our knees touching the edge of the stage!

Ladlow's has a nice variety of furniture. I can deal with the price (if I can't afford it I won't buy it) again my issue is with the greedy phony saleslady we encountered. \n\n1. They need a more diverse staff (age and race) Phoenix is diverse there are a lot of people that are under 70, 60, 50 years of age and of a diverse background.\n\n2. It is obvious that they are paid on commission. They are greedy!!!\n\n3. They are phony money hungry hounds (the friendliness is clearly fake fake fake) \n\nMy husband and l found 2 sofa's that we knew we were going to purchase. The salesperson greeted us at the door and did not let go (followed us around the store stayed on our backs like a monkey). The product was brand new and she had no information to provide. We asked her to obtain the information we requested and we would return the next day.\n\nShe was able to obtain the information. We made an appointment with her and came back to the store on time as promised. Once we arrived she indicated that she had an appointment (on a Sunday) and that she could not be late. She tried to rush us through the sale. She wrote an order that increased the value of the items. (You must know what you want down to the pillows) or they will take you. \n\nI requested fabric samples she was very unhappy and indicated to take the samples home would require paperwork and she did not have the time to complete. (the nerve)\n\nIt was directly communicated if she did not have time we will work with someone else. She got the assistance we needed and completed the appropriate paperwork to take the fabric samples home.\n\nThis saleslady hounded us for nearly a week making the claim that the fabric samples were holding up future sales. (no one was breaking down the door to make any purchases - Lies) \n\nWell today we decided to make the purchase (no problem) as she completed the paperwork we continued to browse around the store. We communicated several times that we were making one purchase only.  \n\nEach time we said something was nice or that we liked it there was the greedy saleslady trying to get us to buy it. I have never been so annoyed. I told her directly we are not buying anything else and stop pushing. These people are so greedy. \n\nUnfortunately there is not a large selection of modern furniture in Phoenix. If I ever go back I will not give her my business. She gave a very weak handshake.\n\nI will be sure to inspect my purchase when it arrives in 10 - 12 weeks (made in USA but can't get any sooner)  I'm just saying \n\nDo Not Let These People Force You To Buy!!!!! It Is Your Money!!! Be an Informed Consumer!!!\n\nI hope this helps any and all that patronize this establishment", "business_id": "yVH2YCImnNebBwLQBRk9Mg", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-06-01", "type": "review"}

But, Courtney assessed the situation and not only gave me a rich and nurturing color that matched just what we discussed, but she also didn't make me feel bad for being a human :) As for the cut, she understood that I wanted to look well put-together without having to spend more than 7 minutes in front of a mirror. After kindly explaining to me that I might need to prioritize or pay her to come style my hair every morning, we decided on a cut that's sassy but can be pulled into my favorite ponytail quickly.

But it was a really bizarre experience.  It was like fraternity party meets bad cheesy wedding.\n\nThe DJ was just awful,  AWFUL.  Maybe he should download better songs from Itunes or perhaps try really mixing songs.  During a \"remixed\" song my husband turned to me and said \"wait, maybe he is mixing.\"  I looked up and his hands were by his sides.  \"No hun, he just downloaded a remix.\"  Basically he alternated playing songs that are on my workout mix with standard wedding favorites (she's a brick, houuuuuuse...she's mighty mighty...)  which is fun and all but I wasn't wasted like some of the patrons were.  We got there shortly before 10pm (no cover btw) and there were definitely people WAY too drunk for that time of night.  I won't lie it was fun watching the drunk girls flop all over the place as its been a long time since I've seen that but I was almost embarrassed for them.  If I have a nickel for everytime I said \"ohhh, and she goes down!\" I may have had enough to buy myself one of their drinks.\n\nWhich brings me to my next point.  The drinks.  I ordered a mojito martini which tasted exactly like certs that have been sitting in someone's pocket for a week.  It was disgusting.  I drank  3/4 of it and my husband was surprised I made it that far.  Despite the fact that the menu said it was made with 10 Cane Rum I clearly saw the bartender put Bacardi in it.  (There is a HUGE difference....I feel the way about rum that most people feel about vodka.)  And it was made with mojito mix.  I had no idea there was such a thing.  If there is anything that ticks me off more than bartenders measuring alcohol with a shot glass its drink mixes that can be made yourself.  The drink was so sugary my hands were sticky!  (I hate sticky hands.)  I felt like I put my hands in pancake syrup.  \n\nThe crowd was, um, eclectic.  Yeah, that's a good word.  I don't understand why you get all dressed up and wear flip flops then I can't understand why you can't keep them on and prefer to  take them off and be barefoot.  Ick.  If my hands were that sticky I don't want to think about what the floor was like.  The drunk girls all over the dance floor were amusing, the guy openly humping his lady friend (legs spread eagle and all) at the bar was Klassy.  \n\nSince it's so close to where we live and so many people seem to like it I'm willing to be cautious here and give it another shot.  These three stars are generous and its just because I feel like this place has so much potential....maybe on a night with a different (real?) DJ.   Or, maybe the problem was I was driving that night and I wasn't drunk to the point of smacking my friend's ass and falling all over the dance floor.", "business_id": "M0Pch3_-Gvj45RN1U4I35Q", "stars": 3, "date": "2007-07-28", "type": "review"}

Two bars, one of the best and one of the worst in the valley. A great example of opposites.  I hope you enjoy reading both!\n\nFirst off let's touch on the name. What the 'H-E-Double Hockey Sticks' does the name Devil's Martini mean or refer to? The first, most important detail in opening a bar is the name. I don't know who came up with the name but they should have slept on it. My guess is that the name was decided upon after many drinks and shots and somehow sounded good the next day after some aspirin and Gatorade (or rather Red Bull).\n\nI always enjoy a bar who shares a parking lot with a strip mall (grocery store, drug store, a few banks, etc), I didn't see them but what did they do with the train tracks? I know I must have crossed them going to this location. So parking and walking up there was no one in line, my mistake I walked up to the right. I was then told by the bouncers to get into the line on left. I said \"what line\"? His response was that I was in the VIP line. I responded, \"what line, I'm the only one out here beside you guys\". So I walked over and stood in front of the rope. I waited a minute then after my ID was checked I proceeded to enter. \n\nOn your way in you pass the patio, Pottery Barn coffee tables and couches, dusty flat screen TVs, kids drinking Red Bull and Vodka. I then paid my cover.  I don't understand a cover charge here? Cover for what? Does Safeway charge a cover too, their rent  /sq foot is probably the same.\n\nUpon entering I see a large bar that shares drink orders from the patio and interior bar, with people 2 deep waiting to order their drinks or waiting to place an order. I have never understood waiting to place a drink order for more than a minute or two. First, I'd rather be at a bar that treats me like a guest, so I don't have to stand next to an attractive girl to get the bartenders attention.  Secondly, why would a bar want their guests to wait to order a drink? Doesn't it make sense to get the drinks to guest quickly? How many sales are they missing out on? How much more money would the bar make selling drinks quickly and possibly making an extra sale in the time it takes the guest to get the order in? Additionally, guests don't like waiting for drinks, so they'll take their business elsewhere, to the bar's competitors! \n\nThe place is a box, bar on either end separated by a dance floor in the center. With the usual, or rather typical Scottsdale white pillars. I've got to ask, what is up with Scottsdale and Greco/Roman white pillars? Is it a design necessity when opening a bar or a club in Scottsdale? There is a third bar elevated on one side that does not seem to get as much attention as the main and the rear. There are VIP tables, but that's it, just rentable tables, nothing to brag about. I'm guessing because it is Scottsdale the owners felt like they needed a VIP something in the bar. Servers are slow, I wouldn't knock them but at few points it was more important for them to socialize among themselves then to get to you. So the answer between going to the bar and fighting your way to the bartender or waiting for table service is up to you, its slow either way.\n\nWaiting to order my drinks was not worth the wait. I don't know why bartenders think they are doing you a favor by over pouring alcohol in a mixed drink. If you order a Jack and Coke and you get a Jack with a splash of Coke what's the point in ordering a Jack AND Coke? Wouldn't the guest order a Jack with a splash of Coke if that is the drink they wanted? A drink poured professionally is just that, a drink with a sense of balance. I don't know who trains the bartenders but they're awful, for the guest and owners. How much money in extra alcohol are they pouring out? How much more money could the bar be making by training its bar staff better? I've got idea, pour drinks right and eliminate the cover charge, the owners wouldn't be losing any more money, and the guest would spend the money on an extra drink, if they can actually make it to the bar to order one. Drinks are not cheap; you're going to spend some money here, $8-$12 per drink, so you're paying Scottsdale prices in a strip mall bar.\n\nMy question is why people come here. It's got to be to people watch. Honestly, watching people was mildly entertaining for a short time, 45 year old guys approaching girls who looked like they used a fake ID to get into the place was fun to watch. Three guys doing shots and one deciding it was closer to hop the fence in the patio to get his car rather than leave through the exit (I hope he didn't drive himself to the ER). I did see 2 bachelorette parties, both swarmed by stumbling, incoherent guys; that was funny too. But then I realized it wasn't Devils Martini that provided the fun and entertainment is was the drunken idiots that pulled the night off for me.

I have been twice and both times the crowd was different. As in wannabe, fake, pretender different. I was propositioned the first time by a couple of working girls, which I am thinking is not a compliment, and as other have pointed out the drinks ain't cheap. \n\nWhat I really don't understand is the DJ. Same guy both times and although I am sure I cannot be a DJ I know when music is easy to dance to and mixed smoothly. He is not smooth and some of the transitions he makes are just whacked out.

No matter how fabulous your pret-a-porter or couture, the reality is that if you wear it, it's going to get dirty.  The rule seem to be the more expensive and delicate the garment, the more likely you will be to spill tomato sauce on it at dinner.  When your precious garment is sullied, do you trust it to just any dry cleaner?  Given the significant investment that fine clothes represent, it's worth a visit to Z Cleaners.  \n\nFor proof of how much customers trust Z Cleaners, you need look no further than the garment conveyer.  It's a literal designer merry-go-round.  You'll see high-end labels like Prada, Armani, Versace, Gucci, Michael Kors, Bironi, Jhane Barnes, etc go whizzing by.  The conveyor looks like it's been stocked by Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue, Nordstrom, Bergdorf Goodman, Ralph Lauren, Barney's, and myriad designer boutiques because it has.\n\nI've been a faithful customer of Z Cleaners since it opened nearly a decade ago.  It started out as my neighborhood dry cleaner when I lived in North Scottsdale.  I moved to downtown Phoenix six years ago, but Z Cleaners does such an outstanding job that I continue to use them as my dry cleaner.\n\nSo what makes Z Cleaners so great?\n\nFirst, it's an impeccable attention to detail.  When you first bring a garment to Z Cleaners, they add a small barcode to the tag in order to associate it to your account.  The garment is tracked in your account by designer and color.  Every time you bring the garment to the shop, it's scanned into their system and they can track its progress from sullied to snazzy.  They also hand inspect every piece of clothing (or housewares) that comes into the store and everything comes out of this place looking top notch.  Dress shirts that I wear for work have lasted six years or more and I attribute that to the careful pampering they receive at Z Cleaners.  They even removed an ink stain from the cuff of a BF's shirt that had been there for four years before he moved to the Valley of the Sun.  We never bothered to tell them about the stain because it was so old.  The shirt came back with a note that read, \"I knew if I worked on it hard enough, I would get it out.\"\n\nAnother huge benefit is that Z Cleaners actually returns your clothes fresh.  I used to loathe taking anything to the dry cleaner because garments often return from lesser cleaners reeking with the stench of dry cleaning solution.  Those places reuse the same dry cleaning solution over and over again, so that reek is actually the build up of soil from other people's garments.  Ew!  That's not the case at Z Cleaners where the cleaning solutions themselves are cleansed and distilled after each use so garments are returned absolutely odor-free. \n\nThen there's the convenience factor.  If you go during business hours, you can sit in your car under the drive-thru portico and they will schlep your clothes for you.  I never seem to get to their store when it's open.  No problem, because Z Cleaners has a solution for that.  They've taken an over-size ATM and attached it to their store resulting in a designer garment dispenser.  They call it the Z Cleaners 24-Hour Valet and you can pick up and drop off your garments at Z Cleaners any time, day or night, seven days a week.  Is this some \"Jetsons\" vision of the future?  No, it's been a reality at Z Cleaners for nearly a decade.  \n\nThey also offer a hanger buy-back program. They give you a compact box to keep in your closet to collect your hangers.  When it's full, you bring it back and they give you a $20 credit toward your next order.  It's a nice green touch.\n\nIn terms of price point, Z Cleaners can be spendy.  However, given the cost of fine clothing today, it's worth it to have experts who really care about your garments take care of them for you.  In nearly a decade, Z Cleaners has returned hundreds of orders to me where the clothes looked as good, if not better, than new.  It does seem that there's a pricing hierarchy in place as it's more expensive for them to handle an Armani shirt than the Nordstrom brand.  \n\nZ Cleaners promises, \"When you entrust your garments, household or specialty items to us, we return them to you brighter, cleaner and fresher than you would have imagined possible.\"  They consistently deliver on that promise.  This is a place where I always know the rumpled mess of clothes I bring them will return to me perfectly fresh, pressed and renewed.", "business_id": "K0ZTFp0Lbn-hRiQa5IzmQw", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-06-01", "type": "review"}

My girlfriend Teresa and I recently went in looking for an engagement ring, not really expecting too much (we had never been to Shane Co before), and we were blown away! Right when we walked in we were greeted by an incredibly friendly gentleman named Taha who began to ask us what we were looking for. When we said an engagement ring, there were no giant dollar signs in his eyes, just genuine excitement for us. Teresa was not entirely sure what she wanted in a ring, and Taha was very understanding and gave us some time and space to browse.\n\nOver time we narrowed it down to a few she really liked, but was not entirely sold. Taha then mentioned their ability to create a semi-custom ring! (\"Semi\" meaning it would not be a ring from scratch or anything, but they can order various parts like the band or basket and connect them) This is when Dallas came out (as I'm sure you've seen in other reviews, Dallas is THE MAN!). He then started giving us some of the options we had in terms of parts and gave his opinion on what would look good. There was a Tiffany's ring Teresa had seen a while back that she was wondering if they could do something similar, but they did not exactly have the basket that would match. \n\nHowever, this was when they brought their jewelery creator out (his name escapes me right now, but another incredibly friendly guy). He said that he could actually use sizing stock to create a custom basket exactly like the Tiffany ring! (you'd think this the ring was for me, I was so excited!)\n\nDallas then came out with a nice array of diamonds that fit our budget (from slightly smaller and very clear to a little larger and a little less clear). All were very nice and very unique, we ended up going with one in the middle. He then totaled it all up (came in under budget!), I put down my deposit and we were out of there!\n\nFrom entry to exit, it was an amazing experience!

We were greeting and asked if we needed help finding anything by 3 or 4 different people. We gave them the typical \"were just looking, thank you\" answer as we had been to a few other jewelry stores and didn't want to feel pressured again. (Tip to other jewelry stores, I'm not going to buy a ring right in front of my girlfriend, the whole idea was a surprise. Just because we were looking didn't mean I wanted her to know when it was going to happen) so after browsing for a good 20-30 minutes, we realized the selection and prices here were by far cheaper, for better quality, than the other stores we had looked at. \n\nOnce we realized the quality of what we were looking at, we finally decided to talk with someone. Enter Leon. He was very friendly but I still assumed we were going to get the samw pressure as other stores, but this was not the case. There was no pressure to buy. He asked some questions, \"how long have you been together\", typical things the jeweler asked you. What surprised me was the fact that he spent over an hour and half with us, pulling different rings, different diamonds, anything we could want to see, leaving multiple rings and diamonds out so we could compare side by side as opposed to looking at one, putting it back in the case, pulling another like we saw at other stores. Finally after almost 2 hours I finally had a general idea of what my girlfriend would like. \n\nAbout three to four weeks later, I entered shane co on my own, confident in what I was doing. Leon saw me as I walked in the door, stopped what he was doing and said \"Travis! Good to see you again\" the personalization was unlike anything I could have expected. He helped me look at rings again until I found the perfect one. Because I wasn't sure exactly when I wanted to \"pop the question\" Leon recommended that I use there lay a way program. You can put a ring on lay a way for up to 1 year, making monthly payments, with no interest. And if you ever wanted to cancel you would get all of the money back. \n\nAbout a month later I went in to pick out a diamond. Leon was there again and greeted me right away. After an hour of questions about diamonds, I thought I had finally found the perfect diamond for her. The process to add it to my layaway program was quick and easy. Over the next 4-5 months I would go in and make my payment (you can make a payment over the phone, but I preferred to use cash in case she looked at the bank statements) every time I was there I would ask to see the diamond placed in the ring again as I wanted to make sure it was perfect. In February I decided to take one more look at diamonds as I knew I was getting close to when I wanted to ask. Leon spent another hour and half with me until I decided I wanted to switch from a cushion cut, to a radiant diamond. The process to change it on my layaway plan was quick and easy. And I was out the door. \n\nOn may 27th I walked into the store ready to pay it off. I was planning to ask my girlfriend to marry me on June 6th. Made the payment and they said the ring would be ready by Friday. I ended up going in on the next Monday, June 1st, and realized I didn't let them know I wanted them to set the diamond real low (it's a double halo ring and wanted it tiered for three layers) they set it in the typical higher fashion like many other rings, immediately I started to panick, not that it didn't look great, but I knew it wouldn't be the way she wanted it. I told them I was looking to ask this week, the assured me it was no problem, that they would put a rush order on it and could lower the setting and it would be ready that same night!  It ended up being perfect. \n\nTo say that I had a great experience at shane co would be an understatement. For one person. To easily spend 15-20 hours with me over the course of me changing \nmy mind and I didn't get the hint he was ever annoyed, or wanted to do something else, was fantastic. He could see how excited I was every time I was there, and he took his time with me and shared my enjoyment. THANK YOU TO LEON AND EVERYONE ELSE AT SHANE CO!  You made the experience better than I could have imagined and she loved her ring!", "business_id": "BUsmaloKEZeOvXLrSjKWSQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-06-17", "type": "review"}

I had been to Shane Co once before to go with a friend who was proposing but wasn't very impressed by the selection.\n\nI go with my fianc\u00e9 (girlfriend at the time) and thought we should stop by as it was along the Scottsdale rd jewelry corridor.\n\nWe walk inside and start looking at all the rings, I walked probably three times back and fourth through the L shaped display case area and found nothing traditional, nothing simple, nothing to our taste.. It was all over the top, flashy, lots of color and didn't seem to be  classic pieces. \n\nWe were there for about 10 minutes and everyone seemed to be busy. Finally a sales person came over to help and was super nice and helped and educated us for a bit.\n\nBut then the questions came which irritated me with my fianc\u00e9 standing on my left side \"does your family know your getting married?..\" And I couldn't believe this one... \"When are you proposing?..\" Seriously!?! \n\nSo this is when it gets good, once I showed minimal interest in one of the rings, they sent a \"closer\" out to \"close the deal\" on the diamond.\n\nFor constantly emphasizing how the sales people are not pushy, non commission based , in the ads, this was the pushiest experience I had out of the 10 stores I've been.

I was a first time patient of Dr. Babey, going in to ask for help with life-long mental focus problems. I believe I have been mildly A.D.D. since childhood, but just in the last few years I came to know what it is and that there is medication for it. \n\nAfter I briefly described this to him, I felt as if Dr. Babey thought I was wasting his time and was not listening to me.  He asked me a few questions and gave me 4 pages of questions to fill out, which I did.  After he reviewed them he came back in, actually laughing at me, and said something like \" I don't know what it is you think you have, but it's not ADD.\" Then he handed me a listing of Psychiatrists and said \"Maybe one of these doctors can help you.\" and he began leaving the room.  So I asked him to wait just a minute while I tried to better describe my lack of focus. It was clear he didn't want to hear it, so I said \"So you're not going to help me..\"  and he replied \" I am helping you by giving you a list of other doctors that might be able to diagnose you. Maybe you have early onset Alzheimer's.\" This was an outrageous statement for a doctor to make, especially considering I do not have memory loss, or any other indications that should lead to such a comment.\n\nThe problem is not that he wouldn't diagnose me with ADD. The problem is the way he dealt with me; a new, paying, customer.   If he felt he couldn't provide a diagnosis, and had said it in a caring way, I would have understood, and gotten a second opinion.  It was the mean spirited way he chose to speak to me, and the off-the-cuff remark that I might have early onset Alzheimer's that really bothered me.  There were no indications for such a remark. I am not forgetful, I am in very good physical condition, and I certainly do not have any form of Alzheimer's.  \n\nTo make matters worse, after that comment, he wanted me to take a blood test in their office, so I asked, why, since he didn't give me a diagnosis or prescribe anything.  He said it was to make sure my liver, kidney, thyroid etc... were in good enough health to prescribe medication. This made absolutely no sense, since at that point we didn't know whether any doctor would be prescribing me anything.  I honestly believe he was just trying to run up my bill.\n\nNeedless to say, I won't be going to see Dr. Babey again, and  I certainly wouldn't recommend him to anyone.   \n\nHaving said all that, I will add that several years ago, I saw Dr. Pankow.  She is an excellent, kind and caring doctor, and I highly recommend her if she's still there.", "business_id": "xyykk6JeU-i-aTRFhVU0Yg", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-08-25", "type": "review"}

Definitely not authentic, but the dishes aren't bad, just nothing to write home about.  They do have a nice variety of cheap lunch specials, Monday through Friday from 11AM - 2:30PM.  They run from $5.55 to $6.65 and include the normal fried rice, fried wonton and egg roll.  Their location lends itself to a lot of the surrounding businesses who come in for lunch.  For dinner, we normally end up getting the Kwan's Spicy Chicken (breaded chicken with their special spicy sauce).  We've also had their Pad Thai (which seems odd being that House of Yang is a Chinese restaurant, not Thai).  But it's surprisingly good. Not too greasy which is always nice.  We go for the Hot and Sour soup - and depending on the day and who's cooking - it can be REALLY good or just o-kay.  When it's spot on - you'll get just the right balance of spicy and sour - not too much vinegar - but not bland.  And a generous amount of shrimp, pork, and tofu.  By far one of our favorites to order even in 90 degree heat!  The place is small, almost cafeteria style - no nonsense, which is all I ever really ask for when I'm needing fast Chinese food.  I know they also deliver but have never ordered delivery (we live outside the boundaries).

(Which of course fall more into the category of every day clothing and not special occasion.)  All in all the selection is incredible ranging from Michael Kors to Catherine Malandrino to Karen Zambos as well as accessories by Kooba and Kenneth Jay Lane.

Last time they came down, we played desert courses.\n\nThis is a fairly easy course, with a few water hazards and numerous bunkers - both fairway and greenside.  Each fairway is fairly straight with a few gentle dog legs.  The rough is predominately grass, although there are cattails around the water hazards.  The course was in fairly good condition for this time of the year, although the greens were fairly spotty.  It is an older course, and could use some maintenance.  The employees were friendly, and the starter, and marshals kept the pace flowing.\n\nA couple of notes.  It does have GPS in the carts, which is really helpful - and they allow driving on the fairways with the 90 degree rule.  Secondly, it is one of the few courses I have played that has the sand rake in the cart (so if oyu end up in a bunker - remember to take the rake).\n\nThe only downside was one of the people that was with our group thought he was Tiger.  He would drop out of bunkers, out of unplayable lies, take second shots and play the best one, and then ask \"did anyone else have a par?\".  It was a good thing the rest of us were even tempered - otherwise they may have found a body in one of  the bunkers.\n\nThe golf value during the summer is great.  But I would hesitate recommending this course at the more expensive winter rates, unless some major upgrades were made.", "business_id": "40B5TbtZbiGV4blFR9S6Dw", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-07-07", "type": "review"}

Huge bathroom with Jacuzzi tub and separate shower, plenty of counter / mirror space, a full-size refrigerator, plus sink, dishes and utensils, and microwave. An outdoor seating area (which we didn't use, since we were here during monsoon season in Phoenix!). \n\nUnlike many other hotels & resorts, Orange Tree doesn't charge you extra for kids staying in the room, so we truly paid $60 per night for the 4 of us. Free wireless internet. \n\nWe had an issue with mosquitoes in our room -- staff promptly handled it and also took something off the bill for the inconvenience. Customer service was top-notch. \n\nBeds are all posturepedic (think \"memory foam\") and outrageously comfortable. Plus the bedroom closes off from the rest of the suite, so it stays nice and dark in there. \n\nThe pool is very nice - lots of covered seating, and it's shady and comfortable after about 5PM. Plenty of shallow area for smaller kids to play in. \n\nMy only complaint is that unless you wind up in building #1, you cannot park anywhere near your room -- so if you forget something in the car, it's a 7-minute walk each way (from building 8, where we were) to the parking lot. From the lobby to the rooms, you can request someone pick you up in a golf cart. But I suppose the resort is designed with golfers in mind, who generally don't mind walking, even in the heat.

We had 9 in our party so we got our own table. About half of us started off with cocktails, I personally got their signature punch which was so delicious & very reasonable during hh for $5 (only at the bar though, not at the table). I don't know why they did, but my bro & mom ordered some apps for everyone, an assortment of tempura (shrimp, scallops & veggies) & edamame. Both were ok but cold, blech. Shortly after we received our soups & salads. The soup was pretty tasty but the salad was drenched in dressing. Everyone ordered something from the teppanyaki menu, except my sis who opted for sashimi & a couple sushi rolls, which she enjoyed. I can't recall what everyone else ordered but my hubby got rocky's choice (steak & chicken) & I got samurai treat (steak & shrimp). \n\nOur chef Julio was nice enough but messed up on the tricks quite a few times, isn't that what we're paying for here? Regardless, we all had some laughs & it was fun. The food was ok. I ordered my steak med-rare & some parts were rare while others were pretty well done, not very consistent. They use so much oil & butter yet the food was flavorless, we had to use a lot of extra soy sauce & salt. I'd say the best food item was probably the fried rice, but again it needed extra soy sauce added. A couple of us ordered dessert after dinner, green tea & chocolate ice cream & banana tempura. The ice creams were ok, definitely store bought & seemed a lil old. I didn't try the banana tempura but those who had it said it was ok also. I almost forgot to mention, since it was my dad's birthday they sang to him (which he hated) & took a pic for him to take home (nice touch).\n\nI didn't foot the bill but was informed that it was over $500 with tip! There were a few people in our party who had never been before so I'm glad they got to experience it, but when you compare the quality of the food to the price it just doesn't add up.

Some of the staff came and sang 'Happy Birthday' to us (both in English and Japanese) and brought us our dessert. I really loved the rainbow sherbet ice cream, although my wife didn't think much of her dessert (she was probably too full at that point). The manager also gave us a free souvenir photo, which I thought was a nice touch to what was already a great meal!", "business_id": "ishjLG3Sc94ZOelXZZhaIw", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-08-10", "type": "review"}

I was told to take a seat wherever I wanted and took a seat at the sushi bar. That is where I waited for about 10 minutes to be recognized. It seemed like the family to the left of me was getting impatient waiting for their food (they already had drinks), and a party to my right had to stop a server to let them know they had been waiting to place there order. This is where I took my chance to request a menu, which was eventually given to me by my sushi bar neighbor who noticed I was still waiting after a few minutes. \n\nTo start, I had the onion soup and salad. I could drink gallons of the ginger salad dressing so I was in a much better mood once I had food in front of me. I ordered a California roll and crispy shrimp roll for the main course. The Cali roll was to be expected, the Crispy shrimp roll was good, but huge. It was hard to get it all in in one bite, but super messy if I did two. To finish, I had the banana tempura, of which I enjoyed the ice cream and pocky stick the most, if that tells you anything. Once my server got in the swing, she was great the rest of the night, so there may have been some miscommunication on who was taking what diners.", "business_id": "ishjLG3Sc94ZOelXZZhaIw", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-08-30", "type": "review"}

We arrive, get seated promptly at a teppanyaki table with another couple celebrating their 8th wedding anniversary and a foursome celebrating a birthday for one of the girl's in the group. Our waitress comes over, we all place drink orders, lots of Sake. I had drunken whale, a few bottles of Kiran Ichiban are purchased. All of us are here to spend money and have fun. \n\nSo at this point it's around 9. Still no chef.\n\nour waitress takes our order. I order the Rocky's choice, filet mignon and chicken. My partner gets the Splash N' Meadows, basically surf and turf. The girl next to us orders Yakisoba noodles and scallops. The waitress starts bringing us the early courses of our meal.\n\nGood onion soup. It disapears quickly.\n\nGood salad, also quickly gone.\n\nMore sake is had. We've spent quite a bit on alcohol at this point.\n\nWe get a newbie chef Im assuming. Im bummed cuz while weve been waiting Ive seen 3 other teppanyaki shows and services end, so Im thinking maybe there's a snafu and thats why its taking a bit. I try to let it go. My partner goes to the bathroom for a minute the chef comes out and his knife show or what was supposed to be lasts about 10 seconds. She's like I missed it?! Mind you the table next to us, their knife show was about a few minutes long and was really cool. Ours was flip spatula 3 times ok Im in a rush since youve been waiting.\n\nOk, strike 1. We HAVE been waiting. Don't rush through the fun stuff just to get caught up cuz you were dicking around.\n\nHe screws up the onion volcano 3 times. Were cheering him on to get it right but seriously *I* can do this trick. But Im jumping ahead.\n\nIt takes him like half an hour to do the rice and veggies. He's clearly in the weeds where he;s cooking one thing at a time even thought there's 7 different orders. He cooks one entire groups steaks before he gets to us, all the while leaving veggies on a plate or the side of the table only mixing them in once we're like ok stop youre gonna go over. He screws up the birthday girl's steak order as well done instead of medium and puts it on her plate anyway then makes her another steak and makes the rest wait. He overcooks the girl next to us scallops til they're singed hockey pucks.\n\nHe plants butter on the table and it splashes on my arms and over the girl's chiffon blouse.\n\nIt's about 11:00pm now and he's barely finishing the girl's yakisoba.\n\nYes. ELEVEN PM. The restaurants closed. The cleaning people are there and our food is BARELY getting ready to serve.\n\nMy food was ok. I destroyed it because I was starving. But the rice was under seasoned and had some raw veg, the onions were overcooked and greasy. I stopped him on my steak and lucked out that it wasnt overcooked like my chicken was.\n\nThe manager then comes over and comps chiffon girl's meal, which means that their order which was close to 500-600 was on the manager. But then only offers me half of after I clearly hear her comp the guests next to us. I was spending about 150, that's chintz, pure and simple. \n\nIf youre going to comp half the guests for the same experience, then comp everyone we were all spending a lot of money. I wouldve even come back if that had happened.\n\nSo yeah we're offered half off the next group is comped and we still have a dessert course coming. Needless to say, were not going to eat one more course in a closed restaurant when its past 11pm and our reservation was at 8:30pm.\n\nI think what sucked was the rushing through the fun stuff and then he was in the weeds after and overcooking everything for fear of making more mistakes.", "business_id": "ishjLG3Sc94ZOelXZZhaIw", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-07-07", "type": "review"}

The food comes in Chinese take out boxes with plastic forks and styrofoam plates. The bar has limited table seating (unless you're willing to sit outside) and the walls and ceiling are adorned with (among other things) glass beads, starfish, cymbals and Chinese dragons. There's a breathalyzer machine in the corner. \n\nOrdinarily, I would not pick Chinese food but after my first visit I longed to come back. Mostly for the atmosphere, but hey! Chop and Wok got me to pick a Chinese place. :) The food is not exceptional but I have never found Chinese food to be exceptional. The variety IS exceptional. More than 10 vegetarian options alone, even more if you are willing to eat shrimp! \n\nJamie has been behind the bar both times I've been there. The very first time he made me feel right at home by asking my name, shaking my hand and introducing himself as the owner. The second time, he generously made amends for a slow kitchen without even being prompted by complaints. The vibe is super chill and is a lot of what I love about Chop and Wok! Last night, some dude started playing guitar at the bar. He had an awesome voice and offered to take requests. \n\nWhen you're feeling low key and hungry, this place is a great solution!", "business_id": "iZR96moKSAWYROyL5-qeuQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-08-06", "type": "review"}

You can actually order your food from the bar as well.  There's a large outdoor seating area in between the bar and the restaurant which seems to really be just take-out and delivery unless you enjoy baking in the Arizona heat.  I didn't mind the styrofoam plates or take-out boxes at all since I always need a box anyway.\n\nAs far as the food, most entrees run $6.50 for a small (pint) and $10 for a large (quart).  You can adjust the heat in your dishes, but even the ones that were ordered spicy were not that spicy.  The food is really good for what it is.  Keep your expectations in check.

Now, it's a cool little compound, with the tiny take-out place and the dinky dive bar separated by a courtyard. \n\nIf you want take-out or delivery , this is the best Chinese in the area. The menu is heavily Hunan, with an incredible variety. Everything I've had is just right. The appetizers are stellar. Fried rice is so simple, but this is what I really love from Chop and Wok. \n\nIf you want to eat in, you can  order at the takeout counter and grab some patio seating. I usually pull up a stool at the bar, where Jamie, or whoever is manning the taps, will place the order and return when it's ready. Nine-in is still served take-out style, so it's easy to pack up the leftovers. \n\nChop and Wok and Wok Star are open late every night.

He thoroughly explained what each procedure involved and the recovery time involved. I felt no pressure, he just shared the information on what could be done. When I decided to schedule, his scheduler was very receptive to my time constraints and worked with me to find the most convenient surgery time. Pre-surgery, I met with with one of Dr C's nurses. She went over all the details with me, from how to prepare before the surgery, to what would happen on the actual day of surgery, and then what to expect day by day afterwards.  I was understandably a little anxious the day of the surgery. His nurses were soothing and calm, his anesthesiologist professional and competent. Post-surgery I was well prepared. In fact, for me, I felt the recovery was better then expected. I was well informed and had no unexpected surprises. I feel that with the full-face laser, it really takes a few months to totally recover (tho I was out and about about 10 days post-surgery). I would go back to Dr Caniglia in a heartbeat.

You are under NO obligation to purchase anything from them, but I am pretty sure that they are aware that most parents are suckers for their kids, so... You end up doing just that.\n\nThat being said, Cameo Studios mailed out an advertisement for senior photos, which included some nice offers if you planned ahead. For example, if you booked your photoshoot in July, the photo session fee only cost $35 (instead of $50) and you got 8 free wallets + 1 free digital image.  However, if you booked in June, you got like 24 wallets, + an 8x10 + a couple of digital images all for free (with a $99 minimum package purchase)!  Well, the mailer came middle May, after the summer trip had already been booked and paid. I was a bit peeved about that. I certainly would have booked the flight a few days later to take advantage of those freebies if they had sent out that mailer a little earlier.  Bummer.\n\n\nPHOTOSHOOT DAY:\nThis was actually a 4-star experience.\nDD got to bring 3 changes of clothes.  There were 2 adult photographers taking indoor shots: 1 woman, 1 male. These 2 were great!  Personable, friendly, playful, helpful with the poses, etc.  The female even switched up the music and played DD's favorite artist and genre. I was quite impressed by that. (Heck, I can barely stand that music when she plays it in the house!) The only thing that I did not like was the teenager/kid who was helping with the photoshoot; he even acted as photographer on a few shots. If you're gonna have an amateur shooting pics, you need to slice your prices to 1/4 of what you're charging. But he was only photog for like 2, maybe 3 poses, before the pro took over.\n\nAfter those two awesome photographers finished the indoor session, DD went outside with a 3rd photographer. He was no fun. I couldn't tell if he had an attitude or just lacked personality.  Either way, blah. \n\n\nREVIEW DAY:\nThis is the day that you return to look at all those pictures that were taken to decide for which 1, 2, or 3 poses you want to purchase packages.  When we arrived, both of the ladies in the front were busy reviewing photos with other customers.  We stood there for a few moments before one of the ladies acknowledged us, saying that someone would be with us shortly.  \n\nThe woman who greeted us was the one who ended up helping us. I do like their review process. They show you similar photos and you start a process of elimination from there.  I assume, most people are able to narrow it down from 60 to 2 or 3 poses. Not us.  There were a LOT of great shots from which to choose, so the decision making process was a bit difficult. The employee seemed to be a bit annoyed. And it wasn't just me who thought this. I hadn't even said anything when both of my DDs mentioned her \"attitude.\"  I ended up just purchasing the full resolution digital images of all of DD's poses, which was likely someone's weekly salary in there. But alas, no love was shown. No smile. Not even sure that I got a \"thank you.\"   \n\nMaybe it's just me, but if you're spending over $500 on high school photos, there should be a little gratitude, or appreciation shown for your business.  I did not feel as if my business was wanted. What I did feel was a \"take it or leave it\" attitude, so I cannot give them 3-stars because this behavior is not OK. If I didn't really love so many of those photos of my child, I would've just walked out and not spent a dime. \n\n\nBottom line:\nThey have good photographers, but the close-out people (ladies at the front) need to work on their bedside manner, and they are terribly over-priced. But, as I said earlier, some parents are suckers for their kids. I am one of those parents.", "business_id": "ZSXJXIMcFwZ_ZV_35sJJNg", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-08-16", "type": "review"}

I ordered an iced coffee (see my review of My Key Coffee http://www.yelp.com/biz/my-key-coffee-scottsdale#hrid:r_cEDtZWPh-y8v2YJSmU9g) and two chocolate chip cookies. Through some small talk, I found out that they also do cupcakes, but the baker was on a hiatus until school was back in full swing. Taking my goodies to go, I had to wait until I was back in the office to enjoy. The cookies are average size; think 2 - 3 inches in diameter, bursting with plenty of chocolate chips. They taste natural, no preservative aftertaste. Another bite in and you can really taste the butter, which has a slight nutty taste. The edges are crunchy and the middle is soft and almost a cake-like consistency. As far as cookies go, they are good, but not my favorite.", "business_id": "tY30KG3CxVe3wU1b5gQDtQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-08-03", "type": "review"}

Not because she needs lessons (my mom's a great cook) but because she enjoys cooking and it was something fun we could all do together. \n\nOur class, Low Fat Faves, was $60 a person. Iced tea (really delicious tropical flavored, unsweetened tea that they sell loose at Sweet Basil) was available to quench our thirst while we listened to the instructor give an overview of each of the 7 recipes we would be preparing that evening. \n\nWith the review of each menu item, tips were given. For example, preheat the oven to 10 degrees hotter than what you need it, because the temperature drops when you open the door. Then lower it to the proper cooking temperature after you've put the food in to cook. Or, to more easily slice meat thin, put it in the freezer for about 30 minutes before slicing. \n\nThere were 15 participants in our class so we broke into teams of 2 (with one woman flying solo) and raised our hands to claim the recipe we wanted to work on during class. We donned our aprons and got to work. \n\nSince Sweet Basil is a kitchen store, there were tons of tools to test drive! It was a lot of fun and about 30-40 minutes later, the instructor was pouring wine for us as we began our buffet dinner. There was a TON of food! \n\nBy the time we were finished, our family had to eat and run. Fortunately, because the class didn't start until 6:30, we had grabbed a \"light bite\" around 5:30. There was no way I could've waited until 9 p.m. to eat - and normally, I wouldn't eat that late at all. A weekend class would probably better fit with my schedule. \n\nThe recipes were OK but nothing really floored me. And, the tips were simple. Which was great for people with less time in the kitchen but I think it would also help to have offerings for more experienced cooks. \n\nThe instructor definitely was knowledgeable and I plan to keep my eyes peeled for class topics that interest me. \n\nOne last highlight: students get 10% off all gourmetware purchases the day of the class (excluding cookbooks, sale and electric items).

For Gel Polish, I would give them 1 star.  They have a small color selection and don't carry the latest OPI Gel Polish.  Unfortunately, I've tried gel polish from here twice and each time it lasted only a week - at best!  Since they don't have the traffic as some of the busier salons, they let their polish get \"old\" and it affects the longevity of your mani or pedi.  \n\nFor pedicure's, I would give this place 3.5 stars.  I personally still go here for pedicure's only and I bring my own polish.  For a simple manicure, they tend to over file the top of my nails  and I end up getting a lot of breakage after their manicure's, so I no longer let them touch my fingernails....toes only!  The best girl for toes was Anna, who - unfortunately, is gone.  She fixed some severe ingrown toenails of some friends of mine.   New girls have replaced her.  The new girls seem nice and do a decent job.  \n\nA big plus for this salon is that they do run ON TIME!  If you have an appointment, you will be seen on time.  How do they stay on time?  If you are late for an appointment, they will either cut your appt. short or they won't see you.  I see this as a plus.  \n\nThe owner and her husband could take a cue from their employee's on how to be friendly.\n\nBottom line:  Bring your own polish and go here for \"toes only\" - for a good price and on time pedicure.\n\n(This is the Salon located in the Safeway shopping center right across from Big League Dugout.)", "business_id": "n5Q6tmoNviNuo8WTvr8m1Q", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-07-02", "type": "review"}

I'm traveling, and pulled into a mall with the idea \"I'm so hungry, I'll eat anywhere\". We came in, were seated, and went through the menu and I was in disbelief...mall food posing as French? Whatever, let's try it. \n\nWe started with the cheese platter. Three cheese, 1 sheep, 1 goat and 1 cow and 1 waitress who didn't remember their names. That's OK because I'm really hungry at this point. The cheeses came with some meats, walnuts and olives and satisfied my immediate need. In perusing the menu, I came across a duck confit sandwich for like $12. Ordered! \n\nThe food was excellent. The duck was crispy and served with garlic and onions. I gazed around and noticed the beautiful Zinc bar and awards the place had won. Wow! We stumbled into an excellent restaurant! \n\nSo, we made a reservation and came back 2 days later for dinner which was also spectacular. The waitress was amused at my \"stumbling in story\" and couldn't believe I had not \"heard of Zinc\". She convinced me to try the Bacon wrapped pork tenderloin which was excellent. Again, we started with the cheese plate, and at night, they knew their cheeses. The dessert menu has a chocolate souffle, but I didn't have space. Cheese plate or souffle? Tough call. \n\nTheir wine list by the glass is incredible. I was able to try several different wines with no premium for ordering by the glass. I wish more restaurants would do this.

While almost everything on the menu looks decent and pretty unique to my American eyes, but my wife and I decided to try something simple.  We split the flat iron steak.

When her glass was finished, they took it away and didn't ask if she wanted another to accompany her entree (which she would have liked).

The food presentation is beautiful, but it stops there.  It doesn't matter how good the food \"looks\" if it has no taste.  I ordered the dungeness crab omelet.  It was terrible.  The omelet itself was thick and chewy and the crab I'm  pretty sure came from a can.  I am from theChesapeake Bay area and I know what crab looks and tastes like and I know when it is not fresh.  The good news was that there was maybe a scant tablespoon of it in the omelet.   If you're going to put a crab omelet on the menu I think you should actually put some fresh crab in it.

We liked it so much, we came back another day for lunch and can't wait to come back again! For Restaurant Week, we made reservations at 6:30pm. We made the mistake of thinking Zinc was inside the Scottsdale Quarter, not Kierland Commons. However, it was a short walk over and it was nice to see the different shopping areas. Upon our arrival, it wasn't necessary for a reservation, as the place wasn't too busy. They had seating both inside and out - we chose outside since it was still cool enough to enjoy the weather. \n\nWe were brought water and bread with butter. Our waitress showed up next and she was super nice and helpful. We placed our orders - I chose the onion soup, medium rare flat iron steak, and chocolate souffl\u00e9 with Valrhona chocolate sauce. My husband ordered the pork torchon with grilled Brussels sprouts, grilled swordfish, and chocolate souffl\u00e9 with Gran Mariner chocolate sauce. \n\nOur first course arrived shortly and it was fantastic. I loved my soup - with the crisp and goey cheese on top and warm oniony goodness below. I didn't want to share. My husband's pork torchon was good, but not my favorite. (It was like a pate - he liked it but said he'd order something different next time.) Then came our entrees. My steak looked and tasted amazing. It had a peppery sauce on it and it melted in my mouth. It came with pomme frites - which my husband liked more than me. My husband's swordfish presentation was beautiful and just as tasty. The swordfish was like a steak in itself - sort of like a tuna steak. It wasn't a flaky fish at all. Then the cous-cous that came with it was delicious with tiny bits of pork in it. Both entrees were delicious. Finally, dessert. Oh man. I poured all the chocolate sauce on my souffl\u00e9 and dug it - it was so warm and delicious. My husband's Gran Mariner sauce was just as delicious but not as thick as mine. Overall, it was a great experience.\n\nOur next lunch date here was just as good but definitely not as decadent. I ordered the omelet with ham and gruyere cheese. This came with a side stack of potatoes au gratin. My husband ordered the seafood bouillabaisse which I thought was tasty. \n\nWe will definitely be back for dinner again soon.

I'm always impressed but a bit intimidated by the exhaustive small book sized menu they have.  The good news is the broad selection of cuisine they offer from Cajun, Mexican/southwest/Asian and more.  The bad news is it's a lot to absorb and select from.\n\nI've never had a terrible dish at any CF location but some are better than others.  They make a pretty wicked Cajun chicken over pasta which is just the right amount of spicy hot and delicious.  Like most of their entrees, it's large enough to split or share which I recommend you do if you even remotely think you may want to sample one of their famous cheesecakes for dessert.\n\nWe went here last Friday so the soup of the day was clam chowder which I usually like.  Theirs was tasty but too watery, not creamy as I like it.  We were a party of 6 and I didn't hear anyone else complain so I presume everything was to their liking.\n\nI took my own advice and saved room to share a slice of fresh blueberry cheesecake which was good but definitely not outstanding.  My wife is a dessert guru and extraordinary cheesecake is in her repertoire so I am not easily impressed even with what is supposed to be among the best.  It was good but not great.\n\nFinally, my biggest complaint about this place is the lighting.  Granted I am approaching 63 and my eyesight is waning but even the (younger) others had trouble reading the micro print on the menu.  I had to use my cell phone to see it which could be somewhat embarrassing for others.  It's just an inconvenience for me.  I've eaten in darker restaurants but they all have strategically placed overhead spotlights to help the vision compromised diner like me.\n\nThe CF is pretty dependable and I don't see much difference among their locations.  After all, I suppose that is the whole point of a chain eatery - consistency and predictability regardless of which one you patronize.  Their restaurants are all nicely decorated with friendly servers and like I said, seemingly endless selections of food and drink.

Now, would one except a dark chocolate almost slightly bitter taste of real cocoa when ordering the Godiva Dark Chocolate?  Or instead how about just giving a really over sweetened chocolate cheese cake with no real homemade texture that may perchance resemble a taste similar to Hershey's ?  \n\nChocolate Blackout Cake- increase the portion size to feed 3 people, decrease the quality of the ingredients and add again the sweet chocolate syrup with an almost artificial chocolate taste upon the cake that is like a box mix.  Voila...charge $9.00 for equivalent of Betty Crocker box cake!\n\nDon't mean to go hard on the CF, but most of their menu items on their appetizer side and small plates are fried (one or two healthy ones only), and again from what I see, if you want a ton of food for not a lot of money then sure its great.  I haven't tried their entrees yet, but am a bit hesitate to do so.  Just don't want to set myself up for disappointment.\n\nFor the service side- seen the same service issues everyone else talks about.  For some reason these corporate chains either hire managers who don't know what they heck they are doing, or decide to offer a pay scale so low that no one takes the job seriously and could care less if they work there or not.  How about pay a few more dollars per hour and hire people who take their job seriously?

Brought visiting granddaughter here today.  Bad move.\nOrdered the chicken samosa appetizer, 4 small greasy wontons filled with chicken.  Doesn't anyone know how to fry anymore?  Why so greasy, pray tell? 380 degrees and they will be virtually greaseless.  These, were NOT.  I didn't complain. \nOrdered two red sangrias.  Sangrias came out with lots of ice (less Sangria) and very watery tasting.  I know good Sangria--it's in my genes---but this was NOT it.  Have you noticed that they don't give you the pricing on some of the drinks?  Well, my dear readers, these watery sangrias were $9.50 a piece plus tax and tip.  I will pay $15 for a good drink folks, but I hate being taken for a ride.  But I did not complain.  After all, I was taking a lovely guest out.  \n\nOrdered one of my favorites, Fried shrimp in the basket with french fries and cole slaw.  Doesn't seem like such a big deal but when shrimp are freshly fried and delicious nothing beats them.  These, were NOT.  Something very strange with these shrimp.  Firstly, two different colors/tones (see photo).  I tasted the darker, flatter one first. Tasted like frozen shrimp from the supermarket, Carnation brand, or perhaps Sea-Pak?  The lighter, curlier shrimp tasted like it was pre chewed--no really.  It's just an expression but what I meant was that it was mushy inside.  Almost like a shrimp paste --they tasted like the precooked shrimp that come in a ring which were battered and then fried.  Very strange.  Granddaughter's theory was that the darker shrimp were leftover from someone else's plate and re-fried and served to me. Yuk at the thought).  I tried to eat them and ate two and then I said, why are you doing this to yourself?.  When our server, Dylan B, came around I couldn't help but to try to describe what the issue was with these shrimp.  I started with... \"I know you didn't cook this, but.....\"   Dylan B listened and apologized.   As we were about to leave a man (manager) came by to ask us how everything was.  I explained the shrimp fiasco.  He gave me an \"explanation\" or how when shrimp are fried and they stick together, one gets darker than the other.  Excuse me Mr. Manager, when was the last time you cooked a dinner?  I am quite a cook so Storytime Theatre didn't work for me.  Then he apologized and left.   Gee, everybody loves to apologize. apologies are cheap.  Is that part of their training?  As long as you apologize,  patrons can eat #######.  \nI got the bill which amounted to $90.  No accommodation for the horrible meal I had or for the fact that I didn't even have dinner.  No small credit for the lousy shrimp, no slice of cake to make up for it nada, Nyet.  \nSo for $90, I had inedible shrimp, coleslaw overridden with mayonnaise, two watery Sangrias and greasy Samosas.  \nMy husband enjoyed his Chicken Marsala and that's why the ONE star.  \nNot good, Cheesecake Factory, Not good.", "business_id": "ewZlgc22xN5NNQ1H7U6Y7g", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-07-16", "type": "review"}

They will also make any corrections you want and they ask you if your dog looks the way you want it -- great customer service. \n\nI do have one concern though -- the last few times my dog has been scared to go here, like holding onto to me tight scared. I don't know why and I don't know if something happened to him, he might just be nervous around other dogs -- he did get into a small scuffle around the same time at our residence.

It's within walking distance to shopping, restaurants, Safeway, and Walgreens. Smack dab in between the 51 and 101, and lots of other amenities within a few minutes driving distance.\n\nOther than the high turnover of the staff in the leasing office (my two favorite employees mysteriously disappeared...), they call you back promptly, have pest exterminators that come every Tuesday should you need some spraying, and the maintenance people are very speedy. After months of being lazy, I finally called to mention the water temperature being inconsistent. I got home from work that day and saw they had replaced my entire water heater!\n \nThe only complaint I have is that my particular set of neighbors strictly abide by the quiet hours rule, 10pm-7am. They don't care for the noise when I have a couple girlfriends over past 10pm, and have twice called security on me. When security comes to your door, regardless of confirming or denying that there's even a noise problem, they must report you to the mgmt. office who the next day leaves you a note in your door, scolding you on your behavior and providing a written warning that will permanently reside in your \"file.\" It seems unfair-- taking someone else's word for it without proof from either security or the tenant who was reported! They could try telling this pesky old man that he lives in an apartment building and if he doesn't want noise, he can go back to his enormous house in Canada or wherever he lives 6 months out of the year.\n\nAnyway, great price, great location, but beware of the snowbirds who go to bed at 8pm!", "business_id": "vY9XP-H9f6g89H0fPUdlHg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-06-19", "type": "review"}

They have an emergency maintenance line, so I called that. They \"log\" my issue and they claim the maintenance person will call me shortly after. That has NEVER happened that way.\n\nAbout 3 times I've waited HOURS and had to call the office multiple times AND the emergency line to re-submit my issue. The emergency line says they'll contact the office AGAIN, the office says they never got the complaint, and then the office provides some excuse hours later when I still haven't heard anything, i.e.; \"We're very busy fixing OTHER people's air conditioners, you'll just have to wait even longer.\" They seriously lack customer service.\n\nThe maintenance man, I think his name is Juan, is the nicest of all the employees. It's clear he's the hardest worker of anyone I've interacted with, and the poor guy works on multiple properties. Maybe things would get done faster if they had less people in the office and more helping with maintenance...?\n\nA month ago, I called before they opened on a Tuesday morning to ask that they spray my apartment for little black bugs that show up in the summertime. I left a message. The exterminators come to the complex every Tuesday and spray the apartments that need it. I check my messages on Wednesday and listen to one saying they'll add me to the list NEXT Tuesday. WTF?! That's why I called Tuesday morning! I call back and speak to a woman who argues with me saying I never left a message and SHE'S the one who listened to the messages on Tuesday. F*** off, lady, I didn't leave a message? So how did the dude in the office know to call me back and add me to the list in the first place? She even had the audacity to tell me they'd charge me to have the exterminator return that day. I pushed harder and pointed out that subtle fact about the message and she finally agreed to cover the extermination charge. But should I really have to argue for that? Ugh.\n\nMost recent headache was today. I called at 1pm to report my disposal wasn't working. The office didn't pick up (not surprised), the emergency line took my info quickly and said the maintenance person would call me back shortly. No call. I didn't get out of work until the office was long closed, and no one has called nor fixed the problem.\n\nThere is terrible communication between maintenance, the office, and the tenants. Lots of things are great at this complex, I'm considering moving again just because I hate paying for a luxury community and being treated like I don't know what they're doing. Either this team knowingly has bad customer service/communication and doesn't care to fix it, or their management doesn't know what's been going on.\n\nHey Lincoln Properties, which is it?", "business_id": "vY9XP-H9f6g89H0fPUdlHg", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-08-01", "type": "review"}

The menu is expansive and includes the usual coffee drinks, pastries, sandwiches, quiche, etc. I settled for a small, vanilla iced coffee and a double chocolate chocolate chip cookie for just over $4. \n\nAfter I got my coffee, I wandered around looking for a spot. I ended up in a back corner that housed a comfy tweed couch with knee height tables and ottoman stools. Across from it were long booths with tables and outlets under all of them. In my corner, there was a bookshelf with used books and checkers. As I was studying, I remember thinking how relaxed I was back there and how the music they played was good and varied. Not the typical Sinatra or hip coffeehouse music they play at Starbucks that annoys the living piss out of me. \n\nAlthough this place was so large, there was very much a comfortable feel about the place and the random corners of comfortable seating (couches, armchairs, etc) helped with that. There is also outdoor seating too. I really enjoyed my experience there and loved my cookie so much, I bought another one on the way out.

The girl making the drinks didn't really seem to know what she was doing.  She had to ask another employee a couple of questions before making them.  My wife's iced coffee didn't have enough sweetener in it so we had to ask for another squeeze.

The manager accidentally spilled burning hot coffee on my brother today at the register.  Instead of tending to my brother's burnt leg, he simply wiped up the spill on the counter and offered up a weak apology.   \n\nI worked at Starbucks for 6 years and I would never tend to a small counter spill before I offered up a wet cloth or burn cream to a customer who had been burned.  Especially if the spill was my fault. \n\nMy concern for the employees who work here and customers who frequent this spot (which will no longer be me) is that there was no proper first aid to treat his burn.  When my brother asked for something for his burn the manager dug around for a bit before producing a bottle of NIVEA BOTANICAL HAND CREAM.  At this point, I approached the register and asked what they had in their first aid to treat burns because Nivea hand cream was not acceptable for his burnt leg.  He returned to the first aid kit and offered my brother a tube of antibacterial soap.\n\nThis should be of great concern to the friendly people who work there and to the loyal customers who visit.  Please consider that all food and beverage establishments should have, at the bare minimum, a BASIC first aid kit that includes burn cream.

I would be relatively happy with their loyalty program only to find out my 20% coupon is heavily restricted: anything premium or as they say \"prestige\" is off limits. This is like EVERYTHING in the store. Why would I go to Ulta for lip gloss or primer I can find at CVS? I go to Ulta because of things like Anastasia tweezers and brow gel and Smashbox primer...now all of which are ineligible for my rare 20% coupon -- which lasts for no more than 5 days. Ugh.\n\nAnd I confess -- a total first world problem -- but it was a painful realization that Sephora offers points for each dollar you spend and if you spend $350 or more you like a VIP member that gets more samples or something and if you spend $500 or more you can redeem those points for actual products. \n\nWhat have I been doing shopping at Ulta the past two years? Where did I go wrong? Why did no one led me to Sephora? That's it, I refuse to grieve over Ulta and I officially  force myself into the acceptance phase of this process. \n\nI agree with the others: the layout of this store is a nightmare. I always spend like an hour in here for 3 products because everything is either messy or just difficult to find. (And don't even try the Ulta on Tatum, that place is a nightmare maze of a store).\n\nI'm done with Ulta for the most part.

My tattoo was done in no time at all.  I love it!  Very clean, organized and professional shop.  Will definitely go back to Tami for my next one.

However, after 20 minutes, no-one had acknowledged us, said hello, offered assistance ... nothing. This despite the owners and two young employees were walking around and only 1-2 other customers were in the store. -2 stars.\n\nAsked the gal behind the counter if we could open an item for our daughter to try it out. This would have required removing 2-3 pieces of tape, but no - not possible. -1 star.\n\nBut the straw that really broke the old camel's back came when we were offered to sign up for their mailing list. Members of the list get a little birthday gift every year. Great, we thought - our daughter's birthday is two days away. Alas, \"she'll have to wait till next year\" because store policy dictated a few more days notice! Say what? Yep, \"wait till next year\" we were told again. -more stars than I can deduct!!!\n\nSo we took our $50 purchase and left disappointed with no plans to return. Even Buy Buy Baby has 10x better customer service, greets you, offers assistance (sometimes even too much), but a mom & pop store can't even say hello and welcome, or see the awkwardness in denying a birthday gift to a first customer who could have become a regular for the next 10 years? \n\nHello and goodbye, Kidstop.

If the food wasn't good, it still wouldn't be worth $5 and it is.  We love the food and especially the generous discounts during happy hour.  My favorite on the menu is the house chow mein with shrimp, chicken, and beef-extra spice. It is one of my all-time favorite things to eat.  The Princess always gets the spicy ginger beef, kind of a play on mongolian beef, it's excellent as well.

However, know that the Hot and Sour Soup (yummy yummy) is best at the Thompson Peak  location and the Spicy Coconut Soup (amazing!) is best at the Scottsdale Road location. \n\nFlo has recently brought back her General Tso's Chicken, one of  my all time favs--delectably sweet/hot sticky, wonderful spicy sauce surrounded by perfectly blanched fresh broccoli!  OMG!  The salad dressings also vary by location.  The Scottsdale Rd. location has a scrumptious Miso Paste dressing which is to die for.  The TPP  store has a more watery dressing...not as good imho, but still very tasty.  \n\nI don't really understand the bad reviews.  Where have you eaten better Chinese in the Valley?  I really want to know because I moved here from the Bay Area 30 years ago and I think I have a pretty good handle on Chinese cuisine.  I want to go to the  restaurants in the Valley that people  think are better than Flo's.  To me, it is as good as the restaurants I loved in S. F. and Marin.  I love 'American Chinese'.

This was a belated anniversary trip, and we were excited for a couple of nights in a nice resort.\n\nOn the upside, the Westin Kierland has beautiful grounds and all the staff we interacted with were courteous and professional.  We had a pool view room with a king-sized Westin heavenly bed.  The room was clean and well-maintained.  It was nothing special, but it was sufficient.  The adult pool, which was a welcome calm from the shrieking kids everywhere else, is open 24 hours a day, which is a nice bonus.  The food in the saloon was decent, and the drinks in the lobby bar (The Rim) were good.\n\nUnfortunately, however, this place was built with paper thin walls.  I am not a light sleeper, yet I was repeatedly awoken by the sounds of people merely passing by in the hallway.  Two members of the housekeeping staff carried on a 20 minute conversation about 15 feet from our closed door and I could hear every last bit of the staff gossip.\n\nValet parking is $27/night.  Self parking is free, but the lot is a bit of a hike from the main entrance.\n\nSo if it's a romantic stay you're looking for, I might suggest looking elsewhere.  If you're after a family-friendly resort or a place where golf is the main focus of your stay, the Westin Kierland is your place.\n\nIf I could award a half star, I'd give this hotel a 3.5.  If I was going back to Scottsdale without kids or clubs, however, I'd probably stay elsewhere.", "business_id": "SYqTY48DJa1cYhglvmgvsQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-06-13", "type": "review"}

The have two large pools, one is for families and includes a lazy river and the other is an adult only pool, which is what we opted for. The pool area is really pretty and kept very clean. There are a ton of chairs so you don't have to worry about getting out there early to get a seat. There are also a lot of umbrellas so you can find shade even on the sunniest of summer days.\nThey also have a pool waiter walking around making sure you have plenty of ice water or you can order drinks and food.

They are on par with the other Westin's I have stayed at.\n\nRight next door is an outdoor shopping center that has a lot of really great places to eat as well so you'll never be at a loss for things to do or eat.\n\nI would recommend the Westin Kierland to anyone from out of town or   to anyone in town who wants an easy weekend escape.", "business_id": "SYqTY48DJa1cYhglvmgvsQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-06-21", "type": "review"}

It was so reasonably priced that I was a bit concerned it would lack quality, and after reading a few reviews on Trip Advisor I was worried.  I was COMPLETELY wrong.  This is a 5 star resort from the moment you park your car.  The front desk staff upgraded our room, and this very nice gentleman greeted us with a smile every single time we passed through the lobby.  They have golf carts available to drive you to your rental car.  The food in Deseo is amazing.  I would definitely recommend trying the ceviche sampler and the muddled cocktails.  I can't forget to mention the amazing bread made with tapioca flour, they will even give you the recipe. \n\nWe especially enjoyed talking to the girls in the information center (the one that looks like a mine).  They were VERY helpful in giving us advice on local restaurants and insisting we take a day trip to Sedona......we did and Sedona is now one of our favorite cities. Thanks to Ashley, Miranda, Tiffany, Chelsea, and Pat.  When we returned from our Sedona day trip, we had chips & salsa, and two cold coronas.  This was a very thoughtful touch.\n\nIf you are looking for a fine dining experience, Mastros Ocean Club is right across the street and has incredible food.  I highly recommend the lobster mashed potatoes and the seared scallops.  \n\nBack to the resort.......our room had a great view of the golf course which was massive.  Although we are not golfers, we certainly enjoyed the view.  Our room was a pretty good size and the Heavenly Beds are my absolute favorite.

I ALSO know how do deal with it when the ramp gets slammed. This guy did not. He was in all essence, a little bitch. A week later I spoke to management.

It was a great choice. I had never been to the Westin previously, but upon first arrival it was a simple yet lush experience with a nicely manicured lawn, trees, bushes, and tons of blooming flowers. Just beautiful. Parking was rather easy as well and it was a quick jaunt to the lobby. Inside the lobby is spacious with beautiful tile work. There is ton of signage directing you where to go and plenty of places to see and go. We traveled downstairs to the Nellie Cashman's Monday Club Cafe for brunch (see review - http://www.yelp.com/biz/nellie-cashmans-monday-club-cafe-scottsdale#hrid:R2uz8FS3a7T6ZQVEqjjfTA). On our way, we saw they had some snakes and a gila monster on display. It was really neat to see the wildlife - especially the gila monster. (He crawled around very slowly and yawned numerous times. Too cute!) \n\nThen, we were able to use the pool and lazy river. The pool area is huge - tons of shady seating, a large pool, a 900 foot lazy river, a 110 foot slide, and an outdoor bar/grill. We were really excited for the lazy river and hopped in. The lazy river had three different types of floating devices - a baby blue two-seater tube(so two could enjoy the ride together), a dark blue tube with a cup holder and back support, and a green tube with a cup holder. (We were recently at the Squaw Peak Lazy River and they only have one type of tube  - single capacity, no back support and no cup holders!!!) I was really excited about the cup holder aspect.  The best part was that the river wasn't too crowded. There were plenty of tubes floating around, the kids were well behaved, and there wasn't any rough housing. I was in heaven. After much lazy time, I took a trip down the slide to cool off completely. It was fun, but compared to a few other slides I've been on, it seemed short. Back into the lazy river. We spent a good three hours on the river and really enjoyed ourselves. \n\nLuckily, my mom got a hotel room really close to the pool so it was easy to get back to the room. Inside, there was a really nice king bed, a pull out couch, and the normal amenities. The bathroom was really nice with a glass shower stall and a bathtub. \n\nMy husband and I live pretty close to the Westin and I know we'll be back for a stay-cation.

Of the 7 hotels we stayed at, I can say that we saved the best for last.  It didn't matter to us that the outside temperature was only 106 degrees in the afternoon.  It was a dry heat.   It didn't matter that there was a full blown monsoon complete with lightning, thunder and lots of rain during the middle of the night.   The blackout curtains worked great, and the walls were well insulated.  We couldn't hear a thing.  \n\nWe arrived to the resort at about 5 PM.   As you pull into the entrance of the hotel, the bellman are there to greet you and to help you unload your car.  Even if you are a cheapskate like me and unload everything by yourself (so you don't have to tip them), they are still nice to you.   They have both valet and self park.  As you enter into the hotel you walk into a grand lobby.  It was nicely arranged, and all the guests in the lobby gave it a lot of energy.  Check in for us was fast and smooth.  \n\nOur room was very nice and clean.  The room had plenty of space for all our luggage and more.  They had a large screen television where my wife was able to watch HGTV and dream.  It was a very comfortable room.  Bathroom was clean and functional.  Nothing was broken.  They provide you with White Tea Aloe shampoo, conditioner and body wash.  Mouthwash is also provided in case you need it.  The Westin Kierland is the only hotel that I have seen with their own wrapped toilet paper.  \n\nThey have activities for the Children at the Kierland Mining Company.  At the Mining Company, the children can go on a scavenger hunt throughout the Westin Kierland Property.  Children are given a passport of places to go.  Children need to go to various places around the hotel property where an Kierland employee will stamp your passport.  When they are finished, they Kierland Mining Company will reward the children with some very nice pins.  They also have a kid's club where they can babysit your children for a fee.\n\nThey have 2 swimming pools at the resort, the main pool with lazy river, and the adult pool.  I was able to swim laps in the adult pool.  The adult pool is a 25 yard pool.  Lane lines were set up for 2 lanes for people like me who want to exercise by swimming laps.  The rest of the pool is open for anyone who wants to go into the pool.  Most of the other people in the pool were not swimming laps, so they stayed outside of the lanes doing adult things.  Very nice of them to let me swim in peace.  Unfortunately, we were not able to try the lazy river because the daughter started getting rashes.  \n\nThey had three concierges.  One of concierge was a stuck up man.  He seemed perturbed that I asked him about the buffet at the Talking Stick Resort.  The other 2 were friendlier.  The female concierge convinced us to visit the Westin Kierland Villas where they could sell us a timeshare.  They tried hard to get us to buy, but, we didn't bite.  We were only interested in the $100 American Express gift card that they gave us.  \n\nThey have a game room downstairs with both a shuffleboard table and a pool table.  We spent time playing shuffleboard.  We also let the daughter play pool.  Some nice boys were already playing when we told them that we wanted to play next.  My daughter the pool shark, who has never played pool before made her first shot she ever tried.  She beat the boys when one of them scratched while shooting at the 8 ball.  \n\nFabulous hotel!  Hopefully we can come back, and spend some more time here.  We had a blast at this hotel.", "business_id": "SYqTY48DJa1cYhglvmgvsQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-08-08", "type": "review"}

No one in the group tried the surfing machine but it was fun to watch those that were brave enough to fall.\n\nDuring the later part of the afternoon kids of all ages took to the grass and did somersaults, played with hoopla hoops, tried their backs and the limbo and ended with yummy and very gooey s'mores.  In the lobby on the way to the room there was a delicious dessert bar set up but we had just enjoyed a sweet.\n\nDid not try the restaurants but had snacks by the pool.

It was a great choice.  I arrived really late that night so I was unable to see the beautiful entrance of the resort that my colleagues had mentioned. When entering the resort it was beautiful, well maintained, modern but reflecting the style of the Southwest and quite frankly how resort should look like.  Check-in was ridiculously long.  I had already dealt with my flight from the East coast and was ready to go to sleep.  It was getting really close to 11pm and I notice that there were 2 people helping to check Platinum guests in.  There were about 8 of us just waiting to get checked in and I was getting really annoyed considering it was approaching 1AM EST and I had been standing in line for over 15 minutes.  I finally got checked in and went to my room.  The room was beautiful and there was great attention to detail.  The view and the balcony was very nice.  My only issue was that the shower was too small for a room with so much real estate.  I was unable to get my platinum upgrade so I assume that the showers in the suites are much bigger.  I didn't get any room service so I can't comment on that. I really enjoyed myself while I was there and think this would be a great place to come back out for a mini vacation.  The location is perfect for those who love to shop.  There is a mall with some restaurants within walking distance but  due to the heat, and the location of some other mall areas I'm sure you'd want to have a car.  Bring your purse every where you go even if you tell yourself that you won't buy anything.  I told myself that I wasn't going to buy anything but there were so many shops with unique merchandise and I ended up buying things.

I landed at sky harbour and came right to the hotel.  No wait very courteous check in ( almost to much) .  I got to my room and  there was some sort of  light and sound show outside my window.  Why in the world would they not tell me that this was happening outside my window when they checked me in? I asked to change rooms and they honestly seemed liked they couldn't understand why, because it was only going on till 9:40. However it was so loud it was not at all relaxing nor could I watch tv over the sound. This is a relatively high end resort not a hip night club in New York. I placed the order for room service in the old room hoping that it would get to my new room and more expedited manner. Which it did. However the order was completely wrong I called up and asked that it be picked up and removed from my bill. She insisted that she would send out the new order a comp it I told her no I was going to bed didn't want another order. Lo and behold I got another meal that I didn't want at this point and there were two meals that went completely to waste. The room service staff was excellent.

The flow rider was pretty awesome, though. We enjoyed the shallow entry of the pool for our toddler. \n\nThe most disappointing part of our trip was the service. There was one exceptional waiter at the flowrider, Nick. He was a glimmer of light for the hour we were watching our kids on the wave pool. Yet when we were at the family pool 90% of the time, service was terrible. We had to track someone down to get food and drinks and were treated as if we were inconveniencing them. \n\nDay 2, my key card wouldn't work.

I cannot comment on the pool, and all the other resort type amenities because I did not get the opportunity to try any of them. I read about them in the hotel magazine at night and they looked pretty cool.\n\nThe Kierland is a lovely and very large resort which is well placed in Scottsdale. The size was a bit off putting for me because it seemed like a haul to go from point A to Point B. The trek from the self park lot to the lobby was a veritable Odyssey if one did not get a good parking space.  \n\nThe hotel seemed very crowded and very busy. I did not have the sense that this would be a restful hotel to hang around. For a family I am sure it is fine and the pools probably are a lot of fun.\n\nThe check in process was easy and information was provided about the hotel amenities and a map was given. I did not stay on consecutive nights but the rooms were basically identical. The bathroom is large and the room was well maintained and clean. It was also very quiet which is a major plus in a mega hotel of this type.\n\nWhen I returned to the hotel I was given a different room, with a view of nothing but a roof and wall. This irked me as I am a Starwood gold member and should have been given a better room. But I was just there to sleep so no real harm done.   \nOne thing I did notice was that the a.c. was not great in either room. A.C. is something that should work well in the desert!\n\nI had breakfast the following day in the downstairs dining room. The waitress was very friendly and nice. The food was a typical mediocre hotel buffet for $25.00.  \n\nOne of the things that really annoys me with some hotels are the so called \"resort fees\". I think it was $25.00 at Kierland. I hate these things. They just feel like a crass money grab.

I've stayed in much bigger rooms at a Hampton Inn before. Obviously no free breakfast at a joint like this as it is one big money grab. Then the Waterpark. I was pretty disappointed. The lazy river was too slow and short. Most of the tubes were flat. There wasn't enough umbrellas so everyone had to fight for shade. The poolside waiters were nice enough to bring around free water pitchers though. It is very spread out too. So when you park strap on your hiking boots because it is far from everything. We've stayed at the squaw peak Hilton and their water park is as good and is not as spread out.

How nice, except for the drunken group also sitting outside.  How unfortunate for the patrons like us to have to listen to them,  not to mention the people attending the wedding.  Worst of all was that there was a manager roaming around and he did nothing.  A major mistake, considering the cost of a wedding here.\n\nI will follow up tomorrow.  So far, they fall a distant fifth behind other very good resorts in the valley, like the Camelback Inn, Boulders, Montelucia, Desert Ridge, and Sanctuary.\n\nSo... The resort staff at the party was great. Very professional, fantastic food, and the events during the night were choreographed perfectly.  \n\nThe room for the night was essentially what we expected.  \n\nThe adult pool today was great. The server we had kept us in drinks while we were there. \n\nThe bell and valet staff for our departure were what I was expecting on our arival.

This time (8 years later), not so much!  We checked into the villas which was a huge disappointment.  There was NO SERVICE at all.  No one to greet us, help with luggage, take our bags to our room or even show us where our villa was.  Once I checked in, I thought maybe I should have booked us in the actual Westin Resort instead of the villas.  I called the front desk 3 times before getting someone to answer the phone and thankfully they ended up refunding me and booking us into the resort.  We get to the resort where they have ONE girl doing check - ins who didn't really know what she was doing and had to keep going in the back to ask her manager questions.  After waiting approximately 20 mins in line, I get up to her and checking in was a complete nightmare.  She wanted to charge my card $1,000 for incidentals.  After speaking to the manager, she corrected that and \"upgraded\" us to a casita suite.  This had a separate bedroom with a kitchen and everything but it was away from all the action and the restaurants and there were huge stains all over the rug.  So we changed rooms again and asked to be in the hotel close to everything.  The third room was a suite as well, but again, stains on the carpet, very old looking and horrible decor.  Nonetheless we decided to just stay and start fresh tomorrow since we had arrived at 5pm and it was now 8pm.  So I go to call for a bellman to bring our luggage from the casita to the new room and I keep getting a busy signal over and over again.

The pool complex is awesome.  The pool is one of the reasons I booked the hotel and it did not disappoint.  The lazy river is a very nice compliment to the main pool.  I received a free breakfast buffet from the cafe at the hotel.  The buffet had a omelet station and other good options.  But I doubt it was worth the $25+ price.  There was also numerous things going on in the evening like the laser show and numerous bars.  The fitness room was also very nice with numerous types of cardio and weight machines, free weights, and matts. Also, there are numerous restaurants and shopping just a few blocks away.  They also give you $5 credit if you don't have maid service each night so I liked that option.\n\nCons:  The room I had was very far from the main entrance.  Dragging kids and luggage all the way to the room was very tiresome.  Although I was near the pool so it is a give and take, but if you don't want to walk for 15 min to your room, I would suggest  requesting a tower room.  \n\nOverall it is what you would expect from a luxury hotel.

We live in Surprise...less than an hour from this resort. Our intentions were a 1 night staycation. ..3 adults 4 kids....hoping to be poolside most of the time. We got there an hour early...1 room was ready, the other was not. We got adjoining rooms so no big deal they were going to text us when it was ready. Got the kids their scavenger hunt lanyards..super cute idea and FUN staff very kind!  Headed to the pool...nice atmosphere! There were a few seats left, a DJ, great time. Food and drink were very - very pricey. We were able to charge everything to the room no need to carry money around. Come 7pm...the lazy river and adventure pool closed. This was kind of ridiculous..check in is not til 4...our 2nd room was not ready til after 5. Latecomers do not get to enjoy this wonderful evening downtime. It's nice to enjoy this when the sun is down especially for the young kids. We were  told we could all use the adult pool which wasn't much of anything. They really are kid friendly but closing the pool at 7 in 111' weather...not too smart. We went to the front desk to check into room #2....get up there and we are now locked out of both rooms. Back down to the desk...this happened 4 times. The 5th time we were told the keys would be brought up to us ..never happened. Enjoyed the Smores ...that was fun. Next day was way different. Got to the pool at 11...not a seat in sight. Didn't matter covered or uncovered= none. It's very clear people toss multiple pool towels down and hoard the seating. Lazy river...packed. not enough tubes...they were asking every other person to give theirs up as you pass the entrance. We couldn't get a tube so we enjoyed the lazy river on foot til a raft became available. Nope...all not on a raft told to get out. Massive line waiting for tubes. The float up bar broke over 3 times due to cash register problems. This part of the stay really sucked. They asked for our room # at pool gate but never used their computer to verify it...probably alot of non-hotel guests, getting by constantly.  On a good note that day we enjoyed a very relaxing yoga class. Kids turned in their papers for scavenger hunt pins and felt very important. Locked out of the room a few more times. My PRO list is clean room...nice staff...good focus towards kid travelers, perfect grounds, variety. My CONS list is parking is a year away from the hotel, bad key cards, not enough seating at the pool, not enough rafts for lazy river. For what you pay per night the room should feel a little more 'resort-ish' . Never got our 'go green' $5 vouchers per room. good resort but depends on what your going for...and when. If your coming to rest and relax other than the pool features..this is a nice place. Coming for water to beat the heat? Look elsewhere.  Going to try Squaw Peak or Gainey next time :) gave it a 4 stars based on rooms and grounds are very clean...well kept..overall enjoyed it.", "business_id": "SYqTY48DJa1cYhglvmgvsQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-07-27", "type": "review"}

Though the resort is beautiful, the location is prime and the beds are nice, you should really consider places such as Royal Palms, Montelucia or The Boulders.  Here is why:\n\nThe hospitality at The Westin - Kierland is simply disappointing.\n\nThis past weekend was my grandma's 100th birthday.  I live relatively close to The Westin, so I highly recommended this property to my relatives who all flew in from the East coast.  The resort is stunning, and the location couldn't be any more convenient for my family.  It was a win win! Or so I thought.  Sunday rolls around and we all decided to head to the pool.  Sunshine, food, large pool, family; seems exciting right? Except I was the only family member that was denied entry...which is not exciting at all.\n\nI arrived separate from the group and the pool attendant said I was not allowed in because I was not \"registered\" under the room (please note we had a couple rooms, with occupancy up to 4 in each room). But fair enough.  As a local I am well aware that I can't just walk into the resorts and use the facilities.  The issue I had was not that I couldn't enter the pool area at that time (my cousin was in the pool and would have eventually checked his phone so he knew to add me to the room), it was the fact that they completely discriminated against me from going in at all.  Let me elaborate. \n\nI watched several people walk right into the pool area without even being questioned.  Others arrived in groups and all the pool attendant asked was last name and room number.  When I questioned the staff as to why they didn't ask the name of all the group members that just walked by, yet they asked me, they told me \"it was a glitch in the system.\"  \n\nThe staff acknowledged that my cousin did indeed check into the pool.  When I asked if his fiance was registered to the room they said no - so when I asked how she got into the pool area they said \"it was a glitch in our system.\"  I also asked how every single family member of mine got into the pool without being registered and they said \"it was a glitch in our system.\"  I asked to speak to a manager and who did the young lady send over? Another employee (security, server, pool attendant not sure).  How do I know it was not a manager? Because the name tag did not have first and last name on it.  Plus he was wearing shorts.  I worked at a hotel, I know these things.\n\nTheir excuse, all THREE times, was that it was a glitch in the system. This isn't a \"glitch in the system,\" it is just human error BY CHOICE.  The staff members made the decision to pick and choose who they questioned (if at all) and to what degree they questioned.  Trust me, I did not just show up solo in high hopes of beating the system just to hang out with 5 year olds in the lazy river.  If I really wanted to sneak into a luxury resort pool, I would have went to Sanctuary.\n\nWhether I registered my own staycation, or decided to stay overnight with my cousin and his fiance, shouldn't matter.  For all your staff knows I am an avid business traveler, politicians daughter or TV Personnel.  Regardless, I should have been treated as a guest - known registered or not.  I have stayed in a hotel room with my family and never had my name on the room, yet known occupancy was 4.\n\nI would advise The Westin to hire more professional staff that will treat everyone the same.  The only thing \"the same\" in this situation is their excuse of your system malfunctioning.", "business_id": "SYqTY48DJa1cYhglvmgvsQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-08-17", "type": "review"}

I want to first start off by saying the t the gentleman who check us in was great he was caring and kind and i even saw him during check out and he remember it was my anniversary and asked how everything was. As well the lady who checked us our was great. If only the rest of our stay was this great but that wasnt the case. Every other staff that we encountered was extremely uncaring and some of them just extremely rude. We went to enjoy the evening by the pool knowing the main pool was closing we going to check out the \"adult pool\" and the hot tub. No so much an \"adult pool\" the pool was filled with children jumping around, swimming right into you, and even throwing tennis balls causing me to be hit in the head. Several times there was a staff member and no one cared. The next morning we went out to the pool to enjoy the lazy river and adventure pool. Those were great minus the staff at the pool. We asked a life guard where the pool gate entrance was and she ignored us at first and kept walking. I then had to repeat myself and she answered me very rudely and wouldnt even look at me. We entered the pool and there were 4 staff members standing there and no one address us. After we walked through the gate and got our towels they again rudely said you need wrist bands to be inn the pool. Stop your personal conversations and address the guest that are enjoying the pool. Our server at the pool server needs some training she was extremely unprofessional and you could tell she was annoyed because i wasnt ordering enough. She stopped coming around to us because i wasnt ordering enough and continue to help the people sitting right next to us. Many times when we wanted something she was over flirting with one specific guest and didnt care about anyone else. Upon check out the lady understood my concerns and ensured someone would follow up with me. That has failed to happen. This whole experience has really put a bad taste in our mouth and we are questioning our loyalty to the Starwood company.", "business_id": "SYqTY48DJa1cYhglvmgvsQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-08-30", "type": "review"}

I have \"foot issues\" so it's very difficult for me to find cool/attractive, functional shoes. HUGE life-impacter to find these unique brands that I could actually wear to work all day and/or travel in, etc., without pain or problem!! Yes, the price-point is higher, but that just means I have less shoes - and each one is perfect!! They also last a REALLY long time!\nAs for the other posters I've read: Of COURSE you can't walk 1.5 miles in your shoes and return them! No kidding. Would you want to buy shoes that have been walked in for a mile and a half? I think \"no,\" which means they can't be re-sold. As for service, my experience over a 3-year period has been consistently excellent service.

Recently my 90 year old mother in law went to Foot Solutions to see what kind of \"solution\" they could offer because she has a size 6 & 8 foot.  She barely had her foot in the door and was bombarded  with a handful of sales people.  Over the last 70 years she, my mother in law, has purchased 2 separate pair of shoes to accommodate for her differences in size. $400.00 and an hour later Foot Solutions put her into a pair of size 8 shoes and bulked up the size 6 shoe to make the shoe fit!!!!  Apparently they did not take into account that she would have to retrain herself to walk in a shoe that is 2 sizes bigger than what she is used to!!!!!!!  She is 90 and already does not walk well.  Talk about an accident waiting to happen!!!! The sales person  told her to try the shoes around the house for 2 weeks and if she was not happy she could return the shoes.  Because she walks so little she barely wore the shoes and the 2 weeks passed.  A week later her and I were discussing the \"new\" shoes.  She expressed that they were uncomfortable and felt like she was going to fall.  I immediately drove to Foot Solutions hoping in good faith they would make an exception and provide us with a refund. I had the wonderful opportunity of meeting one of the most unprofessional and rude sales person, the owner.  She was VERY defensive and unwilling to help because we exceeded the 2 week return date.  She kept questioning my mother in law like she was on trial.  In fact, during our conversation I told her I did not appreciate that she was talking over me and as the customer I did not appreciate it.  Needless to say, no refund was provided which is fine we chalked up the experience as a loss but my mother in law is safe.  A little common sense and compassion would have been a much better solution for the not so Foot \"Solution\" store!!!!!!", "business_id": "W7yZEtS5oyZxZqT0MbdycQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-08-26", "type": "review"}

I thought several more be going out of business as well...so i was extremely pleased to see this one so close to wear i live here in Arizona. \n\nNow this store is not for everyone...even though it has something for everyone. It truly is a \"World\" market...they have items from all over the world. Some of those items include furniture...rugs....china...all kinds of food...desserts....wines...and various other trinkets that will excite your senses so to speak. Some of the items are a bit expensive...while other items are very affordable.\n\nSome food items you could find cheaper at your local grocery store...but for example Jasmine rice...which i love...is surprisingly cheaper here than at all other grocery stores in the valley. While i don't drink...my wife found some great wine there for as low as 5.99 per bottle. They even have some candy from your childhood that they put on clearance...for example i bought some Chunky Bars which usually go for 2 bucks for the giant size one...for only 50 cents....wohoooooo!!!\n\nSo if your ever in Scottsdale and want to experience a little taste of World Culture...please visit the World Market...you will not be disappointed.

Farrelli's combines the two, making it the perfect spot for a fun date night!\n\nWhat an awesome idea!  I've been here a few times, most recently to see Iron Man 2.  (My boyfriend wanted to see it, and we missed it while it was still at the major theaters.  So I decided to take him out on a surprise date!)  The tiered levels of seating are great, the seats are comfy, and everyone always has a good view of the screen.  The sound system is also very good, even for an action movie like Iron Man 2. \n\nThe staff runs this place like a well-oiled machine.  Seating begins a half hour before the movie, so you have plenty of time to peruse the menu and order drinks, appetizers, and your main course before the show begins.  If you arrive earlier, you can sit in the bar/lounge area and have a drink or two (or head across the parking lot to Sapporo for some happy hour sushi).  The servers quietly and unobtrusively move about the theater, bringing food, taking orders, and clearing plates.  Each table also has a light-up coaster that can be used to summon a server at any time.  \n\nTheir drinks are tasty (not at all watered down), and the food is good, though not exceptional.  The sandwiches are a great deal at under $10, and they come with a side salad or fries - very filling!  I really like the idea of eating a real meal and having a few drinks while enjoying a movie.  Don't get me wrong, I love the popcorn at Harkins, but there's something different and a little romantic about enjoying a cocktail and sharing some baked brie with someone special.  \n\nI highly recommend Farrelli's for anyone looking for a different \"date\" atmosphere or an evening out with a group of friends.", "business_id": "-fsCfTYEnJ4s6yStgBnQig", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-07-11", "type": "review"}

The seats are very comfortable and are easy to transition from the table (when you're eating) to facing the screen better when you're not. The staff is also very good about being almost transparent while serving you in the middle of the movie. \n\nThe food is not spectacular, but it's definitely not bad.

The movies range throughout the day from great family movies and the heavier stuff at night when the kids should be in bed.\n\nThe wine list  and other beverages along with the food are above average quality and price.

My 12 year old decided the pizza has been too mushy in the past so he opted for the tenderloin sandwich as well this time.\n\nI had a cold crispy lettuce wedge that was drowned in dressing but oh so good. My fault for not getting the dressing on the side. I do not understand why 99% of the restaurants I go to insist on drowning the lettuce!\n\nMy daughter had the chicken ceasar and a Blue Moon and actually laughed at the silly movie. Just goes to show how much the environment weighs in on forming an opinion.\n\nFarrelli's is a family run business and seems to be hanging in there in this economy. I wish they had a few less expensive options but we always order the same thing.\n\nThere is a nice bar to wait in until seating time and very comfortable rolling chairs to actually view the movie. Plus great music videos before the show.\n\nThe bartender is always happy and friendly, but our waiter Kieth seemed a bit put off that we already had drinks when we got to the table and never has as nice  table side manor.

When you find someone who is an expert colorist AND and expert stylist - well those two skills rarely go together in one person. Am I right?\n\nKelly, the owner of this place, is the bomb\n. He is an expert colorist and frankly cuts hair like a magician. Some of the previous comments were right on. It's in the heart of Scottsdale but could easily be in downtown Boulder CO or the East Village or San Diego's Gaslamp district. This place is uniquely urban and quirky as can be but when you walk out knowing you look the best you can look - who cares really.\n\nI've watched the other stylists work while I was processing and they all are talented.\nLast Friday, Kelly took a last minute appointment for my daughter for highlights and a cut and style and the guy stayed until 9:30 PM because he wanted the color to be perfect. That's commitment.  Love this guy and love this place.", "business_id": "0nUI6eiZ5uT70qD1Ht9VMg", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-07-13", "type": "review"}

This owner is always at his salon - whether it's open or closed - he's there updating his product line or learning a new technique or making his place more comfortable for his clients - the man doesn't sleep. He's on a mission of personal and professional excellence that would put Michael Phelps to shame. \n\nI highly recommend this salon and this owner Kelly and/or any of his stylists. Check him out.

This will be long, but worth reading. The subject matter is a delicate and once very damaged one, my hair. Before coming across this place, I underwent what was probably the worst hair experience of my life. I previously went to a high end salon and paid top dollar to have someone destroy my hair. Bleach under a dryer for 2 hours, enough said. My hair was left so fried and frail, I was scared to brush it. Going to the hair salon, something I was loved was now a new phobia. I had to do something about my hair though (I mean we live in Scottsdale, come on). After hours of researching online, carefully examining reviews, I discovered Choppers. I loved the website and called to schedule a consultation. I met with Annette, who I believe is an angel hiding her wings, she really did save me. She removed my previous extensions, did a Brazilian blowout, toned my bleached hair, trimmed some of my damaged hair, and then added tape in extensions. I have never left a salon so impressed. After my previous disaster, I thought I would have to pull a Britney Spears and shave my head. Annette truly cares about hair and it broke her heart to see what my previous stylist did. I will be working with her in the future and look forward to see my progress in my hair journey. I never thought of myself as a shallow person, but there is something about a woman and her hair. When it was taken away from me, it hurt. Be very cautious about who you trust with your hair and find that right person. Side note, the place is decorated really cool, very relaxing and fun.", "business_id": "0nUI6eiZ5uT70qD1Ht9VMg", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-08-26", "type": "review"}

Having lived here in Arizona for about 6 years, we always drove by this restaurant yet never ventured in.  I guess better late than never, as our taste buds were delightfully satisfied!\n\nTheir mission boasts healthy but tasty food, casual elegance and impeccable service.  Ristorante Arriverderci keeps its promise to all three.  This restaurant's roots come from a native Master Italian chef, Franco, who partnered to bring their special \"Nouvelle Italian Cuisine\" to:  La Jolla, California, Scottsdale and Ahwatukee, Arizona, and finally Houston, Texas.\n\nA:  Upon entering this establishment, you are taken to a most welcoming atmosphere.  To the left hand side, there is a small cozy bar area.  The hostess awaits you with a smile and you see a most cozy dining area, complete with several sections of intimate areas to dine.  The hostess seated us towards the back dining area, where it can be a little warmer.  They are quick though to adjust the air conditioning, to make sure all are comfortable.  The walls have quotes in Italian, along with decor that takes you away to a feeling of dining in a cozy restaurant off the streets in Rome.  We were promptly given water at our table, as well as warm fresh bread with pesto dipping sauce.  A nice touch with the fresh roll of bread served from the basket of a server!\n\nT:  Their menu includes a variety of appetizers to delight, as well as salads, hearty pasta meals, secondary entrees, and their special \"Treasure of the Chef\" entrees.  Prices for their pastas and entrees vary from 11.00 to 19.95.  Their portions are large, so you are certainly receiving every cent worth you pay.  I ordered the Campagnola salad and Rigatoni Emiliani with meatballs for my main course.  The salad was crisp and refreshing, along with a generous portion of balsamic vinaigrette. \nThe Rigatoni Emiliani with meatballs will satisfy any pasta and meatball craving!  A more than ample serving of large rigatoni pasta, mixed in with a generous serving of their tomato sauce and homemade meatballs makes for pasta dish deliciousness.  Their seasonings within the dish bring the a taste that no other that I have tasted in the valley.  About 4-5 meatballs are included, so the carnivore in you is also satisfied.  This dish makes for an extremely filling meal. \nThey also have dessert if you still have room left over from your meal!  :)  Next time, will have to save some room to sample their dessert which I am certain is quite unforgettable as well.\nUpon closing out our bill, we received a shot of limoncello to help with digestion.  An extremely nice touch to close out our meal. \n\nE:  Our overall experience was one not to be forgotten.  Even a nice touch with our waitress' tie embroidered with her initial.  :) I wish we would have ventured into this establishment all the sooner.  I guess better late than never, and will certainly make up for lost time!\n\nI will never want to say arrivederci to this restaurant!  I will say hello many a time in my dining future.\n\nYour Honored Guide,\n--Christina", "business_id": "fmWyI5ec05F8PJpx3eNpLg", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-06-05", "type": "review"}

The kind that you think about days afterwards.\n\nThe roll and pesto are a fantastic start to the meal, but dangerously addictive. It's hard to slow down to make room for you meal.\n\nMost recently, I had the lobster ravioli. The lobster was very fresh - a rarity in ravioli.

Then came the disappointing entree: veal that was supposed to be served in a lemon, butter and caper sauce along side wild rice and roasted veggies.  The veal was wafer thin and literally swimming in an overpowering, greasy sauce; the veggies were ho-hum carrots, broccoli, etc. that were more steamed than roasted (and i suspect came from a bag); and the most unforgivable part was that the dish was served with acini di pepe, a bead-like pasta.  No wild rice was on the plate!  If you're going to make off-menu substitutions, at least have the good form to tell me that when I'm ordering.

The spot is locally owned, with a second location in Ahwatukee, and my pal and I got a nice table in the corner of the restaurant to enjoy the homemade Italian food at.\n\nWe both liked how there were wine racks dividing the main dining area from the bar area, and there were pretty paintings covering the walls, while the restaurant glowed in a soft yellow light. Our server was excellent and professional, and I'd say it's a great date place if you're in the area.\n\nWe started with the Portobello Reganato con Fontina ($8.95), a mushroom topped with cheese. Our server said it was one of their most popular appetizers, and I can see why: it was plenty of food for two people to split and had a ton of cheese. The mushroom was really juicy and brought a healthier aspect to the dish, and I really enjoyed it.\n\nOur meals came with freshly baked bread, and I ordered Ravioli Caprese Gratinati ($14.95). It was a pretty traditional cheese ravioli, and nothing really stood out to me about the dish, though my companion really liked the fresh tomato sauce it was smothered in. The pasta was thick but a great consistency-there wasn't anything wrong with it, but I've just had more memorable meals.\n\nMy guest got the Vitello Madeira con Porcini ($18.95), which was veal covered in a mushroom wine sauce and served with pasta. He said he would have preferred a cream sauce instead, which is totally available to you, but he really liked the veal.\n\nFor dessert, we had the epic chocolate tiramisu the spot offered. It was a giant slab of my favorite dessert, and it tasted pretty heavenly. Definitely get it if you go here-I could have eaten the whole thing myself!\n\nMy favorite part about dining at Arrivederci was definitely the atmosphere and the service. I love places that make you feel at home, and Arrivederci certainly does that with zero pretentiousness from the staff, and I also appreciated the casual elegance vibe the place had.

They were busy and our waiter had his hands full, so the hostess came by our table and took our Wine order....that was a good thing, kept us distracted...LOL  While were waiting, a busser brought out some Bread and Oil for us...the Oil was a little different than most Italian joints...it had chunks of Tomato and green herbs & spices in it...almost like a Salsa (see pic below).  It was very good.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arrivederci-scottsdale?select=pr4ZJ1w3FnvFdudt0TlzAQ#pr4ZJ1w3FnvFdudt0TlzAQ\n\nWe ordered our food and after a short wait it came out.  The Caprese Salad appetizer was very good and perfect for 2 people to share.  The portion size was just right and we didn't get full before our entrees came out.\n\nA short time later, the entrees came out.  I sampled a little Gnocchi from The Better Half...it was very, very good...yum!  I had the Ravioli....they were cooked perfectly al dente...the Tomato Sauce was homemade with fresh ingredients and full of flavor.\n\nAfter dinner, we were surprised with a complimentary shot of Limoncello from our waiter.  He said it was to help cleanse the palate for Dessert...great!  He read our mind...we ordered a Chocamisu to split for Dessert.  It came out a short time later and was heavenly...soft, creamy, sweet just like it's supposed to be.\n\nOverall, we were very pleased with our visit to Arrivederci.  We can't wait to come back soon.\n\nReturn Factor - 95%", "business_id": "fmWyI5ec05F8PJpx3eNpLg", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-08-01", "type": "review"}

They do well with the space they have. I was a little sad by the menu because they vegetarian options were limited. \nI ended up ordering the fettuccine alfredo with mushrooms. Typically I adore this dish, I can make it from scratch so I'm a bit picky about it. It came out with onions which was not on the menu. I despise onions with a passion. I had to wait for the waitress to come back so I could tell her, that was a good 5 minutes. When told she rushed off without a word, although I was still trying to ask her a question. It was really abrupt. She was generally nice most of the visit but I was still thrown off by the weird behavior. Apparently it was not supposed to come with onions anyway. The other gripe I have is that the sauce seemed watery and runny instead of the thick creamy sauce alfredo typically would be. The wine was very good, but again with the waitress I attempted to ask her about the wines and she did not seem at all knowledgeable while she dodged my questions. I'm not sure if we would make a return visit. Service and the confusing food issues just aren't up to par with surrounding places.

Needless to say we are very picky and looking for a particular style but unsure of the details wanted on the ring. AND, we wanted a few choices so I could be surprised when he popped the question.  We were greeted by a lovely Sales Person, Darla Jo. She asked all the likely and important questions to narrow down the selection, then proceeded to show us rings.  As we went through several cases and down to the last one, I still didn't find \"The One.\"  However, I did like several aspects of different rings.  Darla Jo listened, had the Ah HA moment and showed me 2 rings.  SHE GOT IT!!!  Daunting task but she did it!  But it wasn't just about finding the ring, it was about our experience with a wonderful Sales Person. Darla Jo took the time to ask questions, get to know us...our personalities and our style.  Because of our experience with Darla Jo, my husband not only purchased the engagement/wedding ring, I purchased his custom wedding ring and several other pieces. I absolutely LOVED the fact that we always looked forward going to Hamra and meeting with Darla Jo. Hamra became our go to jewelers.  Until...I received an e mail from a different Sales Person informing me that Darla Jo was no longer there and she will be assisting us.  My husband and I went in and met with her.  She was definitely NOT the experience we had with Darla Jo.  She did not listen to our requests and she was not very accommodating. The attention and TLC was gone and so were we.  I'm hoping that our paths with Darla Jo will cross again.  Not sure why an Owner would let go of a professional and experienced Sales Person that paid attention to details and her customers. Something is just not adding up.", "business_id": "DuAvRG7OOnmKHUKHvXUvrw", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-07-21", "type": "review"}

It's certainly nothing fancy. It's split into 2 parts. It's just a very large room with somewhat of a warehouse feel. The main section has a bunch of low tables, a few high tops, and a bar to the left side. I'm not sure what it is about the layout of this place that confuses me. Picture a school cafeteria. Lots of tables set up in rows. Good for groups because pushing them together is a cinch considering you are basically in the lap of the table next to you anyhow. If you need to get up to use the restroom, it feels like you end up rubbing your ass on the head of the person behind you trying to squeeze by. The side area has some booths and more cramped seating and seems more \"family appropriate\". \nThey do show music videos, which is pretty awesome considering some of the tunes people choose. Some real old school gems are thrown in that provide some entertainment. They also have darts and a Big Buck Hunter. TVs are scattered about. \nThe menu is big and diverse. Typical bar food (wings, burgers, sandwiches, salads) even pasta as well as Mexican food. Something for everyone! Service is friendly and fast. I usually have Lori, who is terrific. \nI would up the rating if it wasn't such an odd seating arrangement.

Initially, I was put off when one of the people in my party was charged $5 for bottled (Nestle) water.

Probably will never go back because I don't live in the area.\n\nI felt about 10-15 years too young for the crowd here on a Saturday night (for the record, I'm 29).

The band stops playing at about 1230am. $5 cover. \n\nThe crowd was mostly Real Housewives of Scottsdale types and their husbands in western regalia.

You come here to drink, dance and maybe eat a little.\n\nThe food is what you expect, its good but its not Maestros, and nor do they care.\n\nYes, Mama can be a little tough, but hey, its her place and her rules.\n\nThey do have a two drink requirement. I think thats fair. I have seen people show up, order a drink, and spend the night nursing it. Seriously! You gotta be prepared to pay for the place, the music and the atmosphere, and two drinks is nothing!\n\nAs for the tables, they have a right to expect people sitting at tables to either drink, eat or stand up! This is not your home barbecue!\n\nFinally, if you are in the forties plus, this is a great place for pickups. No, its not for twenty somethings, and again, its a country saloon. \n\nI dont dance worth a damm, but there is often the \"barfly\" resident cowboy that is able to dance, just waiting for the girls to come in.\nNot my thing, but people love it.\n\nThis place is a part of the Scottdale heritage! Heck, I am told back twenty years people rode their horses up to the bar.

They have no problem giving me extra anesthesia when I ask for it and I don't think I've ever been charged extra for that.  One time I must have seemed cold, so the hygienist asked if I wanted a blanket on my lap during the appointment, which I found surprisingly nice.  Even nicer though, was when they told me to keep it!  Sure, it probably cost them $5 and it has their logo in the corner, but it's a super warm fluffy blanket that I actually use quite a bit now!\n\nI always take their first appointment at 7:00am, and the atmosphere when I walk in is just refreshing.

What is sold at Electric Ladyland is not couture.  Couture pieces are one of a kind garments and most likely hand tailored for you to your measurements.  At the very least it is produced in small quantities.  You usually cannot buy couture off the rack and you certainly can't buy it at a boutique that sells mass produced clothing.  And just because a brand has the word \"couture\" in the name, does not mean it's couture.  (Juicy, I'm looking at you!)   Christian Lacroix would rather die, I'm sure, than have his amazing works of art sold in a store called \"Electric Ladyland\".  I went to an art museum to see a couture show once....it was an amazing show and a far cry from the borderline freak show of Electric Ladyland.  Shannon W. painted a grim picture in her review of one of the denim store on Camelback and this store isn't much different.  Thank goodness there was no strobe lighting when I went in.     \n\nThey have an obscene amount of costume jewelry and I was not impressed with the selection at all.  About 97% of it revolved around fruit pendants which were in style 9 months ago for about two days.  Hardly fashion forward.  They carry some great jewelry designers, such as Gorjana, but they seem to carry the worst part of the collections.  The jewelry is horribly gaudy and you will be hard pressed to find something delicate and lady like.  It hardly matters because they make it near impossible to get to the jewelry as they place tables of clothes around the table that has the jewelry and they piled it all on top of each other as if it was a garage sale.  The necklaces all get tangled, and it's just a mess.  \n\nThe clothes are ok, like I said they are not couture, and they aren't anything you can't get on shopbop or at Nordstrom.   The denim selection is good but I would highly suggestion going to the Scottsdale Jean Company, Spoken Boutique or even Nordstrom first.   The clothing selection includes a lot of graphic t-shirts and tanks (not my style, I need something, uh, a little more...how do you say....fashion forward?)  and chintzy dresses.  They are lacking in the designers that I often turn to (Velvet, Susana Monaco, Alice and Olivia, Splendid) and really carry quite a limited selection in clothing that isn't casual and basic.  Honestly, I don't see how this store is popular with anyone over the age of 17 that has a sense of style.", "business_id": "ho2ks4SitYa6xzMttXNasw", "stars": 2, "date": "2007-08-17", "type": "review"}

These fences are made of fiberglass poles with synthetic mesh \"fabric\" panels.  I received several other estimates for my yard, including wrought iron.  I was looking to enclose a large pool (over 90 feet of fence) to protect my small children from pool access while maintaining some convenience of use and accessibility to the pool.  I was immediately impressed with Marty in contrast to my other estimates.  First, his price was very competitive.  Secondly, he was the ONLY person who actually looked at my pool and the deck layout and suggested an optimal fence layout.  My deck has all sorts of weird cutouts.  I originally though the fence should follow the deck line.  Every other estimator just gave me a price for what I suggested, and they never suggested something else might be better.  Marty took one look at my yard and considered my suggestion, and he politely offered an alternative layout.  I am not a pool fence professional, people!  I need someone who does this day in and day out to tell me what is ideal.  Marty did this, and now that I see the final results, his suggestions were completely spot on.\n\nDuring his estimate he showed me samples of the mesh fabric, the locking mechanism, and the fiber glass poles, and explained why his product is better.  For example, it is made in Florida, not China, has much stronger poles than many others out there, and has a color that will not fade.  He showed me videos and pictures of the fence in action.  He had all the information ready for me.  No one else had that level of detail in the presentation of the product.  In fact, no one else had any detail at all other than \"google mesh fence and you will see some pictures.\"  He also suggested a cheaper, better alternative of a gate (the manual lock) rather than upselling me the more expensive self-closing gate.  \n\nWhen I asked how long to install, having been told by other companies I was in for a 3 week wait due to order times from the manufacturer, Marty said as early as three days - he keeps product in stock.\n\nSure enough, 2 days after I called to tell him I wanted the fence, he was at my house installing it.  He even fought off some ridiculous mud from a leaky sprinkler system to pour some concrete for some off-deck poles and trimmed hedges back.  The fence looks great, and there were no problems.  He drilled extra holes to pin back sections (at our approval) and provided hole covers.  Seriously - another bid told me that they don't provide covers for the holes because the manufacturer doesn't provide them not in these poor economic times.  What? The point of the removable fence is to get rid of it someday, and that means capping the pole holes!  Marty left my backyard and deck clean.\n\nMarty was a great guy, very professional, and has been doing this a long time.  As he will tell you, he is not a \"weekend warrior\" or a fly-by-night pool fence company.  He does a lot of fences through a national name and offers great pricing and warranty.

The assembled horde were hungry. Decided to order Italian and have it delivered from Guido's. Then, later that week, we all wanted to watch the CWS-NYY game and I had a hankering for eggplant parmigiana\n\nSunday, we ordered a margharita pizza, sausage pizza, garlic bread w melted mozzarella and marinara and cheesecake for all. The second time, we ordered eggplant parmigiana, antipasto, fried calamari w marinara, a couple of subs and cheesecake for all.\n\nOkay, for starters, I understand that any restaurant-delivered food is not gonna be as fresh as it would be in their dining room. That said, the food from Guido's was pretty good on that score. The delivered food was reasonably warm or reasonably cold depending on the item. The spaghetti accompanying the eggplant was al dente.\n\nOther than the calamari -- it was over-breaded, soft and overdone -- everyone was delighted with their dinner. Except me. But, that's what I get for ordering seafood in Arizona. The pizzas were warm, but a little light on the sausage topping. \n\nThe cheesecake was especially good, a nice-sized portion, reminiscent of NY cheesecake. The filling was creamy without being too heavy. Guido's cheesecake has a very thin graham cracker crust. \n\nBe warned: there is an 18% service charge for orders delivered. If this food was served in their dining room, I'd knock them down a star.

I say this tongue in cheek, mainly because if you're from New York or Philly you'll disagree with my 'great' assessment. But do try to keep in mind this is the desert. \nWhere we don't have decent breads unless the deli is buying local from MJ or Arizona Bread Company, which they typically don't.\nThe cold cuts are Boar's heads and not imported. \nAnd the tomatoes are desert tomatoes, not Jersey sweets.\n\nSo there IS a difference, you're right NY and Philly, but once you get off your high horse and figure out there aren't a whole lot of places to choose from here, you'll eat Guido's and you'll like it goddammit. Ughhh.  \n\nI visit here regularly to restock my fridge with fresh olives, imported provolone, and Margherita pepperoni, one of the few places that has it. They also have decent homemade biscotti and pizzelles. Their homemade sausage is tasty too.

I had a great sandwich called a prosciutto caprese, it had fresh mozzarella and basil on it and the bread was divine.  The whole sandwich with the tomatoes and oil combined with the fresh bread,prosciutto cut perfectly, homemade  (I'm guessing) mozzarella, served with broasted fries is on my top ten sandwiches I've ever had.  My aunt had an Italian sub that was delicious as well, but even she liked mine better. My niece got a little bowl of spaghetti which she loved almost as much as the chocolate cake we shared after.  It's a great environment,with real italian products for sale, deli items, baked goods, canolis that we took home are great too.  However, there was a bald man who may have been the manager or owner that was barking orders to his employees rather rudely it seemed. Also the air conditioning must have been broken because I was sweltering,  so was everyone else there.  It was hard to enjoy the experience when we were sweating the whole time. The waitress was great, I think her name was Jane, i know it began with a 'J' and she had long brown hair and big beautiful brown eyes, and a great smile. She was busy but still had time to be friendly,even when the guys were ringing a bell while she was talking (very disturbing ) she got all of our orders right, got the food out fast, and recommended the Caprese when I asked her about the best sandwiches they had. \n       So besides the air conditioning being out or not set low enough I would go back to this place, but I'd  rather order to go instead of sweating in there.

I don't know what was done here but it seemed like chicken out of the freezer that got thrown in a microwave, dipped in flour without seasoning.

What piqued my attention was the automobiles and the line outside this joint. It looked like Goodfellas. I am noticing a Bently....Powder Blue??? A Maserati QP and an Orange Lamborghini. I told my Wife that there is something going on here. With the line and steady stream of business it was time to try. \n Again, it is in a strip mall, Which is where often times you find a gem. Found one!! The inside is tiny and quaint. The flavors on the food are bold. My Wife and I went traditional. Linguini w/ Clams for her, and Veal Osso Bucco for me. Now, the rest of the story.....\n My Osso Bucco took a long time to be ready....I actually like that. It was very hot, extremely tender and the stock/gravy was Killer. The Shank was roasted so well that the marrow inside was PERFECT. They put a lobster fork in the shank, something that is done in much finer Restaurants than this. I was pleasantly surprised. The Marrow was so good, so rendered that put this dish at about a 8 out of ten. The only person to come close to my Granfathers recipe of Linguini Vongole is Tutti Santi. It was excellent!! The Canoli was fair but the Sambuca that is served with every dessert  is a very, very nice accoutrement.

Tutti Santi Ristorante Italiano by Nina's is tucked away in a strip mall off of Greenway and 64th street.  Very unassuming from the outside, Tutti Santi is a welcome respite from the heat that bears down in the summer months in Arizona. \n\nTheir menu includes both cold and hot appetizers, many pasta dishes, and dishes with seafood or meat.  For a hot appetizer, their homemade gnocchi ($10.95, potato dumplings served with a bit of cream and topped with your choice of sauce) is a tasty appetizer to begin your meal. \n\nFor a filling main course, Tutti Santi delivers a creamy Rigatoni Pipitone ($14.95) to satisfy one's pasta craving.  Their Rigatoni Pipitone consists of rigatoni pasta abundantly covered with creamy vodka tomato sauce and mixed in with ground sirloin.  Smooth and creamy, this is a decadent dish for any pasta lover.\n\nAt the end of the meal, you are given a complimentary shot of Sambuca liquor complete with three coffee beans (common serving style of Sambuca shot in Italy). Sambuca tends to have a black licorice taste.  This complimentary shot is good for any fan of the black licorice taste indeed.\n\nTutti Santi can be on the pricier end of Italian restaurants in Scottsdale.

My girl friend Janice has been raving about this place forever! While she shops at the Fashion Sq store, I found myself in Kierland and thought I just might take a peek around. \n\nThe store was sloppy, and the staff seemed much more interested in moving clothes around rather than helping me find a size in a dress. Being a size 12, I thought it would be easy. I guess that means searching for myself and looking through all the size 8s that were everywhere. One very nice woman was helping me in the dressing area but was overshadowed by a very tall woman with an accent practically yelling at her. The dressing room gal remained professional and actually apologized for what I had just witnessed. \n\nWell 5 over-priced, ill-fitting dresses later ( had to try on some 10s since that is what they had to offer!), I gathered my belongings and left the dressing area. It was then that I practically tripped on the ladder on the floor. Why there was a ladder on the floor during open hours is beyond me! \n\nI had just about enough. The tall gal was now at the cash registers, the line was long, and again she was yelling! Out I went. Walked down to Banana where I received service with a smile, 2 cute dresses and NO attitude!\n\nSorry Janice, maybe the gals at Fashion Square just have it more together!

I have been to quite a few Morton's in my lifetime, but last night, this particular location left me with a bad taste in my mouth. \n\nSee I was there a wine event, and in my defense, I knew I should have made sure that I had enough cash on me prior to arriving, but I didn't think anything of it. After finally finding a parking spot and walking in then did I realize, crap I don't have enough cash. The young lady that was taking money for the even was nice and she stated that I could fill out a credit authorization form, which is me basically writing down my credit card information on a piece of paper for them to charge later. Yea no. I wasn't comfortable with that idea so she said to try to the bar as they should be able to help you.\n\nSo I go over to the bar and it was busy, but not overly busy. I made eye contact with both bartenders, smiled and waited. 5 mins later, I am still waiting and never received a \" I will be right with you, or Hi their, what can I get you\" however other patrons that came up to the bar after me were helped immediately. Yea FAIL!\n\nEven then I was like ok, I let it go. Yes I was disappointed but I let it go. So go to try to find a manager to see if I could find a way to pay for the wine event that was going on. I explained the situation to the hostess at the door and she called over a manager or the head hostess guy, I am not sure. She explained to him what my request was he told that hostess \"I can't assist her right now\" (meaning me). She then said \"but can't we just scan her card for the $15, it will only take a minute?\", and the he again proceed to say, \"I don't have time to do that so no I cannot assist her\". Mind you I am standing right next to both of them as this conversation is happening. If you could have seen the look on my face. The hostess immediately apologies and I tell her it is fine, no worries and I turn to walk out the door when the manager or head hostess says to me, \" Can I do anything else for you?\" What the??!!! Are you kidding me?  Hmm no,  but thanks. You have been most helpful.\n\nSo needless to say that I did not attend the wine event and I left Morton's very disappointed. From the service I received at the bar down to the head hostess or manager.  Yes I know I should have made sure I had cash on me for this event but seriously?\n\nFunny thing is that I went to another place to calm down and to have a drink. Although I was upset, I still smiled and made eye contact with the bartender and she immediately came over to me and said, \"Hi!  Give me a second and I will be right with you\".

Lobster was ok, not the best out there and not the worst. \n\nI ate there a 3rd time, and chose to dine in. The food overall was good. Had the Porterhouse topped with crab and asparagus, Parmesan & Truffle Matchstick Fries, Five Onion Soup, Double Chocolate Mousse. The porterhouse was alright, the server asked if we would like it a little blackened...I don't recommend this. It was burnt on the outside and it didn't help the steak. The crab and asparagus topping was very dry and the crab was definitely fishy again. The fries were average, however the five onion soup was one of the best french onion soups I have ever had. Would highly recommend it! The mousse was also really good!\n\nSo why 3 stars instead of 4 or 5? Mastro's, Ruth's Chris, etc  have a better steak...and overall their side dishes are better.

In terms of steak they are purists.  If you really like added flavors to your meat then this may not be the perfect steak for you, but like me, I want tender- and for the record Morton's has the tenderest steak I've encountered in the valley.  I also don't want added flavors but to let the meat be the center stage.  Dry aged beef that is 'prime\" cut.  Perfection.\n\nI've had both the rib eye, and the fillet and never have been disappointed.  \n\nTheir sides are definitely well made and delicious- from their Caesar salad (home made dressing, just the right amount) to my favorites being creamed spinach and the hash brown potatoes.  For a vegetable the asparagus is perfect since it's served crisp and fresh.\n\nYou may be wondering why not 4 or 5 stars?  First is value.  I understand good things aren't cheap but $18.00 for deviled eggs was the first for me.  Hopefully it comes with salad or vegetable for that amount of money.  Even the desserts for the taste are a bit overpriced.  \n\nThe second slight annoyance is the inconsistency in service.  Sometimes it's great and sometimes it's just okay.  Well okay is acceptable if your at the Outback but if your paying prices that support top notch dining I would expect top notch service.  Never complained but wondering if the management sees how many people wait around just to be offered water or a drink when they are first seated?  Also how about not rushing people to ask if they want dessert when clearly they aren't finished with dinner.\n\n Lastly, and here is a big factor for me- if you charge $17.00 for your premium vodka martini, please don't measure my pour.  Morton's is, according to 2 different servers, obsessed with measuring their alcohol.  Yes, the place that charges a premium for a Jack and Coke wants to make sure that 1.5 oz is the limit you will receive.  My question is why?  You can charge $15.00 for a drink that most places charge $9.00 for, and if the guest wants a drink that really tastes like Jack Daniels doesn't it make sense.  Probably why the Capital Grill bar is packed on a Friday night and Morton's has maybe a handful of people.  Anytime corporate accounting starts dictating the standards over common sense or giving fair value for what is charged is when you start loosing repeat customers and potential repeat business.  I'd love to go to Morton's more but my fiancee likes her cosmopolitan martini a certain way and I like a good kick to my Jack and Coke.  $30.00 for two drinks and your worried about 2.5 ounces vs 1.5 ounces?????", "business_id": "_YswYrpv6YdO3R3CP8R8oQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-06-28", "type": "review"}

My main thought is that it is WAAAAAAAY overpriced. $10 for a well martini? REALLY?? One trip, I got 2 drinks, peppers, and one or two sushi rolls (which are relatively small), and I paid $60!! Yes...60 bucks for ONE person to not even get full! I then heard from a friend that happy hour is the best time to go...prices on happy hour items are a bit more reasonable. So...I went to the late night (10-close) happy hour last weekend.\n\nWe walked up and saw a few tables of people outside, and inside there were no more than a handful more...good, not too busy. There was one other woman waiting at the host stand so we stood behind her. We stood there...and stood there...and stood there. \n\nSeveral times employees walked by; one even gave a polite little head nod which verified that none of us were invisible. However, even after several times of poking our heads around the dining area and toward the bar tender, no host ever came. We even walked around the fish tank at the entrance thinking maybe someone would come over out of concern that we were essentially BEHIND the host table. Nope! \n\nAfter at least 10 minutes of being completely ignored we finally gave up and left. That other woman stayed. That was about a week ago. She very well may still be waiting there. We went to a different restaurant where we paid much less than we would have at RA (even at happy hour prices) and where we were served very quickly.\n\nI have had it with RA. Food is expensive and the taste/quality is mediocre...more presentation than substance. They use tricks to make the food appear larger than it is...spreading out the pieces of sushi roll, garnishing with sauces and some items to make the dish appear taller. It looks nice of course, but when you're hungry, the aesthetics don't fill you up! Happy hour was my last attempt at allowing them to win me as a customer...and I never made it past the entrance.", "business_id": "nk6_ipMkmUvUtq6Xvncf0A", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-06-15", "type": "review"}

My office is located in the Kierland Commons. This can be nice when I want to blow half my paycheck at H&M during my lunch break, but it's not so nice when I NEED to blow half my paycheck if I want to be able to go somewhere walking distance from my office for lunch. Originally, I thought my most reasonable options were a $7 Asian Chicken Salad at Chloe's Corner or crossing Scottsdale Rd to get to Chipotle. That is, until I ventured over to RA today and saw what I had been missing.\n\nFor starters, they have some amazing lunch specials.  Yes, they are pricier than Chipotle but in the grand scheme of sushi, they're pretty damn good. They have a Sashimi Lunch combo that is four pieces of salmon, tuna, and yellowtail with a miso soup and a salad for like $12.  Their Bento lunches come with so many things I can't even remember them all and cost like $9.  For the area (this mall in particular), these lunch prices are incredibly reasonable.\n\nWhat I got today, the Tuna Squared Salad, isn't even on the lunch menu and it totally blew my mind that for a couple bucks more than the tuna-mayo salad over greens I get at Chloe's (which is delicious BTW but that's not the point), I could be getting a huge portion of greens topped with about 5-6 pieces of seared ahi, about 5-6 slices seared sushi-grade albacore, avocado, and cashews.  These are all very expensive things!  This should be a very expensive salad! But it's $10 and it's glorious.\n\nOh one more thing that I probably won't be getting while we're in the triple digits but I have had before and it's delightful: Miso Hot Soup.  Picture a huge miso soup full of shrimp and tofu and mushrooms with with a kick strong enough to clear your sinuses.  Plus it comes with these fried rice balls (I usually get it to go and they come on the side) that are surprisingly delicious. I always think I can save some calories and not eat them, but it never happens. Those suckers are in the soup by the second spoonful and gone before I'm half done, they're just that good.\n\nAll in all, no, I don't go to RA for mind-blowingly fresh, melt-in-your-mouth sushi.

This ra has the worst service of all! We had to ask for our server multiple times and usually do at this location. This was a Friday night and there were tons of open tables. The worst part is that they were out of fried ice cream.. The whole reason we went to Ra instead of a different sushi place. The server did nothing. I am sorry but you shouldn't be out of your desserts on a Friday night and there's clearly something wrong with this location since it was empty on a Friday night and every other ra you go to is packed beyond belief. We will be going to the other locations from now on.", "business_id": "nk6_ipMkmUvUtq6Xvncf0A", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-08-23", "type": "review"}
