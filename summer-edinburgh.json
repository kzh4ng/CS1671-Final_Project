Even Edinburgh Castle is embellished for the sake of marketing and keeping up its military image.  This embellishment is really a Victorian remnant that Scotland's image has never really recovered from (ironic as the castle is largely a Victorian romantic refurbishment).\n\nTo counter this we have places like the People's Story to tackle the nittier grittier facets of Scottish history. Some have suggested the People's Story is some kind of Marxist propaganda machine. I think that's probably an exaggeration, I don't imagine that's particularly on Edinburgh Council's agenda. Nevertheless it does offer a largely sympathetic account of Scottish \"ordinary\" and working class life up to present day, and that includes the vital aspect that the labour movements played in reacting to and shaping Scottish life. Admitedly this is probably not the easiet subject to cover.\n\nOverall the Museum has lots to see, and makes the most of its space to show it.

The People's Story museum is not necessarily out-and-out Communist propaganda the way some Americans might think when I use \"the S word\". There are no posters of Marx and Lenin, no soviet flags or banners with Che's face emblazoned on them. \n\nThe museum tells the story of what life was like for poor and working-class Edinburghers, which immediately sets it apart from most history museums that mainly dwell on wars or glorifying political and business leaders.The People's Story does not shy away from the fact that life for working-class people is tough, which may be anathema in the home of Adam Smith. It also does not concentrate on Horatio Alger style rags-to-riches stories, but illustrates the ways people took collective (rather than individual) action to better their situation. Creating cooperatives, forming labor unions, and yes - joining the socialist party. It also showed that workers were better off when they organized.\n\nThe most interesting exhibit showed the various jobs in Edinburgh in the 19th century and compared them to modern day. This exhibit seems dated because \"modern day\" in this case means 1988, when the exhibit was likely created. I'm fairly sure the paper industry in Edinburgh is no longer geared towards creating continuous-feed paper for dot matrix printers, for example. Still, seeing the change in the way these jobs were done (and even what jobs exist) over time is fascinating. \n\nOther exhibits looked at immigration in the 1700s, law and order, women's rights, and social life. The social life one was amusing to me in that it featured a stereotypical early 80s punk rocker. \n\nAnyway, the museum is free and worth checking out.", "business_id": "wjytooLlvPSyo8kvJ8UfQg", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-06-02", "type": "review"}

Jokes with a Scottish accent are also more palatable if they end up flat.  That's good to know.  The two-man show was great and we were very glad to have caught it while we were there.

I've been there once or twice for the cheap Monday night comedy which allows first time stand ups to try out material on an understanding and sympathetic audience.

If I paid \u00a315 a ticket to see an act at any other venue my ticket would come with a seat number, standard. It's just expected. So why when I pay \u00a315 to see a big act like Rob Delaney at The Stand should it be any different?\nMy boyfriend and I arrived an hour before the show was due to start and were told there was standing room only. I'd had the tickets for months and we were still there an hour before anyone was due to come on stage. A member of floor staff kindly approached us as we jostled for position, and offered us two stools at the back, although he warned that they weren't exactly \"seated together\". He wasn't lying. The backless stools were crammed into the middle of an already packed row of people, and were one in front of the other. Not exactly the social, birthday night out I had planned. Add to this the fact that the room heats up throughout the night to a stifling humidity, and the whole thing is just too uncomfortable to be funny.\nEither lower your price or guarantee me a seat with the purchase of my ticket.

With over 400 pubs to choose from in Edinburgh, it can often be difficult to decide where to go.  Greyfriar's Bobby bar maintains a peaceful, relaxed refuge while still being situated next to one of the city's characteristic landmarks, only a few hundred metres from the tourist drenched royal mile. \n\nBobby's is for those who like their pubs traditional, yet not crammed with the usual air of villainy that can usually be associated with such a place.  Upon entering, you are greeted with a slightly dim yet comfortable atmosphere reminiscent of what you'd imagine a stately home would be like.  This veneer is complimented by the tasteful, nostalgic memorabilia that hangs from the walls, such as portraits and old parchment reinforcing the familiar tale of the eponymous canine.  \n\nAs a student, Bobby's offers a welcome haven from the regular mould of student packed bars scattered across the surrounding city, while still offering an attractive benefit for the beer drinkers in the form of \u00a32 pints of Guinness, Tennent's or Belhaven Best upon the flash of a student card.  However, spirits can be a bit on the pricey side for a student budget (I'd say regular pricing for other non student orientated drinking establishments) which often leads to the formation of \"sausage fests\": the non-beer drinking female student often wishes to take her business elsewhere. Yet this still leaves open the option of having a few pints with the lads wide open.  \n\nThe staff here are fantastic.  I have always been welcomed to the bar with friendly mannerisms, even under busy periods. And more importantly, they certainly know how to poor a proper pint of Guinness!  While I haven't personally succumbed to the temptation of one of the hearty meals on offer, I have observed the enjoyment upon the faces of those who have and feel confident that I would not be disappointed. \n\nBobby's always attracts a good mix of clientele. It is popular with tourists yet there have been few occasions that I have been present there where the place has been chalk a block with them, an issue that often puts Edinburgh residents off such places.\nThe seating is usually plentiful, with a recent rearrangement offering more, however I'd still recommend an early arrival on Fridays and Saturdays to guarantee maximum comfort.  \nFor those musically inclined, be sure to check out some of the excellent traditional folk acts that often play there. \n\nOverall, Bobby's remains one of my favourite places in Edinburgh for going out for a drink or two, and I have often gone for a cheeky afternoon pint with a few pals that has blossomed into an enjoyable evening there.", "business_id": "Nq_BMV7kyx9_C3w0Jip6CA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-06-20", "type": "review"}

With a cute story behind the name and a traditional Scottish pub atmosphere it is no surprise it is heaving with tourists, especially during the festival. However if you are an Edinburgh resident, there are many other bars that do the same but better. Greyfriars is just a bit clich\u00e9d, with the old memorabilia on the walls, and the traditional style d\u00e9cor. \n\nThe atmosphere is good though, especially if you are with a group of mates. Due to the fact it is quite small it fills up quickly, but if you get a booth then you can have a few drinks with friends. Don't expect a wide range of beers though, the bar is tiny and always packed. The food too is pretty average.\n\nThe pub quiz though is good fun, and refreshingly quite challenging.

Usually dodging around the persistent small gathering of tourists gathered around the Greyfriar's Bobby statue. I imagine this bar often gets a lot of passing trade from said tourists, and locals alike.\n\nThe bar has recently been renovated inside, and the result is a very homely, traditional Scottish pub feel inside. It reminded me immediately of the local village Smiddy pub that my family took me to every Sunday for lunch or dinner (the type that did pate,  steak sandwiches, death-by-chocolate cake. That was my order for a good 12 years). Anyway, I digress. What I mean is, it's homely, it's inviting and not only is it homely, it feels like home. A magic wee trick, where it will both appeal to tourists looking for something very Scottish-y but isn't OTT or a faux-Scottish feel, and instead recreates the cosy Scottish pubs of old.\n\nThere is a very large dining area, for a bar. The bar area itself is quite small and I can imagine would get crowded if many people tried to stay here all at once. So I can imagine they'll be looking more for families for dinner, and larger groups, than a large group of mates all meeting for a pint. But that's just fine. \n\nThe food menu itself is extensive, and I was immediately intrigued by a Crabbie's Ginger Ale glaze on the chicken. Served with a good helping of skins-still-on chips, it was hearty and filling and good, honest, pub fare. The Thai green curry looked delicious, and I heard the prawn and chorizo salad was very spicy (if a little on the small side compared to the other mains).\n\nIf I had my family visiting and in need of a good pub lunch, I wouldn't hesitate to bring them to Greyfriar's. Definitely not a 'tourist trap' or selling out, they've recreated a genuine little pocked of a quieter Scottish lifestyle.", "business_id": "Nq_BMV7kyx9_C3w0Jip6CA", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-07-11", "type": "review"}

I stayed in the Alexander Graham Bell room, which had antique phones, and antique switchboard, and a large mirror etched with a quote by the man himself. \n\nThe bathroom in my room was amazing. Far larger and more modern that what I expected based on what I'd heard about European hotels. The shower was large, had plenty of hot water and good water pressure. For some reason the shower curtain didn't extend all the way around the tub, which was weird - but aside from that it was great.\n\nThe bar/restaurant downstairs was nice. I usually had breakfast there (which was excellent) but otherwise didn't spend much time there. It seems like most of the other reviews are just for the bar, so you can learn more there. I did have dinner there on my last night, and while the food was good the service was slow. The bar was crowded and it seems like they may have been a bit overwhelmed.\n\nThe overall service at the hotel was great. We were exhausted from our overnight flight and overwhelmed by being in a foreign country when we first arrived, and they took great care of us. When I realized I'd forgotten my jacket in the States, they recommended some places I could go to buy one. The staff were always friendly and always helpful. \n\nThe location of the hotel can't be beat. It's right in the middle of High Street/Royal Mile. Niddry Street, where some of my favorite bars are, runs right along side it. You have a short jaunt down the hill to the Cowgate if that's your thing, or a bit longer walk in the other direction to Waverly Station and then on to the fancier shopping areas. Personally, I can't abide \"shopping\" as a vacation activity, so I'll stick with drinking.\n\nThe only downsides to this hotel were the stairs and the keys. There was no elevator, so every time I wanted to go to my room I had to climb several flights of stairs. This makes you *really* reconsider running upstairs to grab your jacket or charge your phone. The rooms have old fashioned keys which means that to lock your door at night you're essentially locking yourself in the room. This is an insane fire hazard. What's worse, each room only has one key. So either my wife or I could carry the key, but if we wanted to split up or if one person wanted to stay in the room while the other went out we were screwed.", "business_id": "zBG2vQ0A6F5HQkv_aeWfAQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-06-02", "type": "review"}

Yes, there are better ones on George Street and the like, but they are so much more expensive and really pretentious. Bar Kohl is not like this, it looks like a modern pub / bar on the inside and has a cool atmosphere. They do have a projector that sometimes shows the football, but this is not a major feature.\n\nIt sells itself by being one of the only cocktail bars in this part of town. And the cocktails are great. There is a pretty big menu of all different types, martinis, mojitos, cosmos, white russians, long island iced teas etc and they all taste amazing. Well to be honest I have not tried all of them but have made solid headway through the menu. The best is the raspberry mule, which is basically a Moscow mule with raspberry juice and fresh raspberries in which is awesome.\n\nThe best part is the price; any cocktail under \u00a37 is reduced to \u00a33.50 with a Snapfax, making it one of the cheapest cocktail bars around. They also do a wide selection of shooters, but at about \u00a34 each these are a bit steeper. Definitely a good place to go if you are looking for somewhere different from the standard touristy pubs that adorn the Royal Mile.", "business_id": "QPsNlmETw14k-_RqX-RULw", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-08-05", "type": "review"}

Not least because it's pointy and uncomfortable, but wishy-washy is not normally my style. And it's not that I'm being wishy-washy with my three stars. It's more that it's half-yey and half-hmmm.\n\nSteven B (West Coast yelper, yo') and I stopped by here for some pre-show munch in the form of burgers. The show was in Teviot and we wanted somewhere close by. In the midst of Festival madness, I'd read that Bar Kohl is often quiet and is actually really big inside despite its somewhat small space on George IV bridge. \n\nI also read that it does vodka. A lot of vodka. But hardly any Yelp reviews mentioned the food - what's with that people?! So here is my flip-side review in which no alcohol was partook of but the burgers sure were.\n\nThey've got a pretty good burger menu. Most pubs'll do a beef burger, a veggie burger and occasionally a rogue chicken burger. I think they had about 4 different types of beef burgers, a lamb burger, veggie burger and 'The Cougar' - the chicken burger which I opted for.\n\nNow, the YEY comes in with The Cougar (I had it Cajun style, added jalape\u00f1os). It was literally a whole, huge chicken breast in delicious cajun spices. It was so juicy, and tender, and spicy, and really all I could ask for in a chicken-breast burger. The jalape\u00f1os in particular deserve a special shout out as they were SPICY. I know right? Most places I got I can't even taste the jalape\u00f1os which makes me think they're old. These certainly had a kick.\n\nIt came presented on a wooden tray (wooden trays with food are so hot right now. Seriously, everywhere is doing it). A nice freshly baked sesame bun, not store-bought methinks. A wee pot of coleslaw and a larger pot of fries.\n\nI usually don't eat my chips as bread and meat does me fine, add in potatoes and I'm in a food coma. I tried one or two but was glad I don't normally eat the chips as they were very pale, and hardly been cooked at all. They werent BAD, or still actually frozen, but they were luke-warm and jst a bit 'meh'.\n\nSteven B tells me his beef burger was good. He went for the plain ol' standard beef burger. The lettuce and tomato was there, check. Nice bun. Check. But from what I could see his beef burger was about half the size of my chicken breast burger. It was really quite thin. It says on the menu quarter-pounders and that they're home-made but side-by-side it just looked a bit paltry. He was the one eating it, not me, and he didnt complain.\n\nHowever, knowing that when I go for burgers with other folk and I always get chicken burgers, they often get beef. And I know they'd be disappointed with the size of that burger. And therein, good people of yelp, lies the problem and the 50/50 scenario. AWESOME chicken burger, teeny-tiny beef burger. But as I said, he ate it all and enjoyed it. I just know I would have had food envy of the one that I got *smug look*\n\nI will be back to try the huge range of vodka. And that does look pretty special. This review is for the food alone, and like I said whilst one half was amazing the other half was a bit meh which leaves me sitting on this rather awkward fence.", "business_id": "QPsNlmETw14k-_RqX-RULw", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-08-16", "type": "review"}

It goes a little something ah like ah this..\n\nFirst impression: Looks lovely, both from the outside and the warm cosy interior which, as has been mentioned succinctly elsewhere, is much bigger than one might have expected.\n\nOur M.O. was for food, with drinks being an afterthought - not the other way around as was the impression I was getting from both the previous reviews and all the menus and scribblings on the walls from this place who were boasting their range of vodkas and cocktails but saying nothing about the food.\n\nAnd so, I believe this place to be one of those places where the food is the afterthought. That's not to say the food wasn't good, because it was, with Jenny's chicken burger looking, smelling and I have been assured tasting dynamite. My ol' classic burger with lettuce and tomato was really nice in a crispy bun with a pot of fries and coleslaw on one of those funky wee wooden slabs you see in a lot of meaty joints nowadays. Felt like I got my moneys worth but the burger was a skinny McBurger type affair. Sigh.\n\nI would go back to try the drinks, the special effects of this place in an Avatar analogy where the food is very much the plot.\n\nI was delighted to get my pint of Kopparberg in an actual pint glass that read 'Kopparberg'.

Valvona & Crolla's is the epic Italian deli of Edinburgh, having been here for almost 100 years. The deli up the front of their original Elm Row branch is wonderous, like Willy Wonka's for meat, cheese and pasta lovers. I love it.\n\nThe caffe bar up the back sells all their delicious food stuffs, which is good. So why the three stars?\n\nThe boy and I came here for breakfast. A \u00a330 breakfast is transpired. Yes, we weren't counting as we ordered but we normally order the same thing where ever we go and it usually ranges from \u00a310 - \u00a320. The usual being normally two types of cooked (poached eggs and bacon, or smoked salmon), a tea and coffee, and two OJs. The only difference here was the boy also ordered one of their fresh chocolate croissants for after (they are that good).\n\nSo either the chocolate croissant was \u00a310 good or their prices are just generally higher. I can't actually remember the individual prices, but paying \u00a330 for two for breakfast is a wee bit much. The food really is great and they are an Edinburgh institution so I think the prices reflect this. But when I can get equally good cooked breakfast elsewhere at half the price..well you do the maths.\n\nThe other thing that I don't know if they could change is the space itself. It only has sky lights so whilst there's light, there's no view. The decor is quite dated and the chairs and tables are spread out across a rectanguar floor in a very orderly order (ehh you know what I mean). It just feels a little soulless. This is a total contrast to the dark, high-ceilinged, meat-strewn deli up front. It just isn't somewhere I'd *want* to go for long leisurely brunch or lunch. Which is a real shame.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love their deli, I like their other caf\u00e9s (despite that they're also really pricey) and I love their food.

Okay, it was better when I was younger but it is designed for children so you can't really fault it just because you've grown up and have lost most of your imagination and childhood spirit. \n\nRather than just strolling around at your own pace, it's designed as a tour where you are transported back to the beginning of time.

In fact, I think it might be 4D as there's even snow, wind and heat too.Very cool.\n\nDefinitely one for the kids, but if you still have any imagination at all then this place is great and even if you're too grown up for the tour, the planetarium at the end is beautiful so there's something for everyone to enjoy.", "business_id": "Rza-FztnKi8YfcSkn1KxgQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-06-12", "type": "review"}

(Which is only ever a good thing in my book).\n\nI grew up in a quaint little village with a quaint little village butcher. All locally sourced and top quality. Crombie's is like the Edinburgh-scaled version of this. Local, not exactly quaint but definitely friendly and familiar, but behemoth in size with every type of meat you could want. And the meat looks simply divine, superb, out of this world amazing. I kind of wanted to buy it all.\n\nThis is coming from a girl who sometimes has chicken for breakfast (I kid you not. When I'm out of eggs it's chicken on my bagel instead, nom). Sunday Roasts weren't so much a weekly tradition in my family as a way of life. I would say that the French diet is probably my favourite, due to the fact it's mainly meat, meat, then some meat with meat (and veggies). Red meat at that.\n\nAnyway, I digress. This is what Crombie's has done to me. It's turned me into a meat-drivelling carnivorific lune. They didn't just sell the very best looking cuts of steaks, a huge array of sausages, three sizes of burgers, and all the relishes, sauces, pies, bakery and some biscuits to go alongside it.

They were plain but when I chatted to the butcher about the best way to cook them (a slow fry) he said he could marinade them in a lovely tomato, pepper and garlic marinade. YES. PLEASE. So he promptly did so, and re-vaccum packed them telling me they'd last till the weekend and would freeze today.\n\nAlso, this is something I don't normally comment on unless it's to the other extreme (of dirtiness) but the place is immaculate, shining, spotless. Yes, butchers should be spotless and most do carry out all the regular hygene rules. But this place is postively gleaming.\n\nCrombie's isn't in my neighbourhood but I have now made it part of my routine to take a trip down Broughton Street once a week to get my meat for the weekend.

I don't know if it is in business terms, but certainly the theme of this bar is to please the theatre goers as they step in for pre theatre drinks and eats.\n\nBecause of its proximity to the Playhouse, it maintains a high standard of service and quality. The walls are freshly painted a rich red, there are theatre posters from years ago framed in each corner of the space, and the large horsehoe bar serves up a number of nice beers and spirits.\n\nThey serve up the usual pub fayre for lunch, and it's not too expensive considering its central location. The bar staff are friendly and although it can get busy when a show is about to start, if you aim to get here a couple of hours early you could set yourself up for the night with a relaxed bottle of wine and a wee chat. They have outdoor seating which is enjoyed by locals, tourists and theatre goers during the sunny afternoons.\n\nI like this bar. I would drink in it even if I wasn't going to the theatre, and make it my local if I stayed nearby. The exterior decor with the bugle players is interesting, making it stand out as one of the older and classier bars in the area. But what I like most of all about this place is that they keep their toilets clean and tidy. What's more, they pipe music through them. At long last I've found somewhere which plays elevator music in the bathroom. There's nothing worse than doing a wee and awkwardly knowing that your wee, along with those in the neighbouring cubicles, are amplified. Makes washing your hands beside your previously anonymous pee partner needlessly embarrassing. \n\nSo even though they were playing Joe McElderry of X Factor fame when I visited, I would gladly take that over the icy silence that usually falls on bathrooms.

And amazing might even be an understatement. \n\nI know a helluva lot of vegetarians and vegans in Edinburgh. Edinburgh's actually a pretty decent city to be ethical about your eating habits. Most places either have a vegetarian/vegan option or are vegetarian/vegan. I heard about Black Bo's through a militant vegan friend of mine who spends most of her time planning her next meal. She's a fan of food, she is. \n\nSo, when my parents ventured upon Edinburgh, I decided to take them there. It's useful having them around, you see. They feed me very well. This is a relevant fact: my father, if he could, would be a pure carnivore. The thought of eating at a vegetarian restaurant did not appeal to him at all. Let's just say, he left real happy. \n\nThe menu at Black Bo's changes pretty consistently. The first time I went there I had some sort of heavenly stuffed aubergine. I can't even remember what most of the ingredients were, but they made my taste buds tingle. The day I finished my last exam, I went there with a few friends and I had some filo pastry thing filled with pistachios and asparagus with grapes sort of just strewn about the plate. The grapes were a brilliant idea. Seriously. \n\nRumour has it that they once had a meat option (see, they were getting back at meaty restaurants for always having a vegetarian \"option\"), but no-one ever ordered it, so they scrapped it. Yes, meat-eaters out there. Vegetarian food can be good.\n\nI'm not much of a food critic, but I know when food makes me happy. And this food makes me very happy.", "business_id": "-rwVxBOV0VNXB12of1N6hg", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-06-30", "type": "review"}

Now, I know what you're thinking - how did that ugly guy, with no personality and as boring as a drying paint wall manage to get hitched? Well fear not, I stayed alone in the Honeymoon Suite.\n\nWhy? Because I can. That's why.\n\nI had a night to spare in Edinburgh and whilst looking for a room for the night online, I chanced upon the Albany Hotel, and saw the Honeymoon Suite was going for \u00a399 for the night. Compared to other rooms in Scotland's finest city, this was a complete steal.\n\nCheck in was pretty straight forward, though I notice they charged my card prior to arrival, not giving me an option to pay by cash. No biggie, but that's different to other hotels I've booked into.\n\nThe room itself is brilliant - the carpets are black, thick and soft, and the room decor is masculine modern - a huge king side bed dominates one side of the room, and the other side has a 50\" TV screen, and a huge black sofa with high edges. In the en suite, there's a full size free standing bathtub, complete with an attached TV (which I couldn't get to work, but again, I wasn't too fussed about that) and a separate shower cubicle.\n\nThe hotel is a stone throw from York Place tram stop (on the newly opened Edinburgh tram line) which makes it very convenient to reach and get around, though walking to the city centre only took me a mere 15 minutes or so.\n\nI've given the hotel 4/5 stars, based mostly on the Honeymoon Suite, and how nice it was. However, judging by what I saw of some of the other rooms (whilst they were being cleaned) and the general state of the hotel (frayed carpets, small breakfast room, awkward stairs, no lift and nobody offering to carry my luggage), if I were staying in one of the other rooms, I'd probably have gone for a 2/5. So be warned that this is a skewed review, as I'm only recommending the Honeymoon Suite.\n\nThe breakfast provided in the hotel is a Continental breakfast buffet, which left a lot to be desired. Cereal boxes, some cold meats and pastries - how boring.\n\nNevertheless, I would definitely stay again in the Albany Hotel.. but only in the Honeymoon Suite.", "business_id": "tL5_K1Mxy_oddbUEjd-voQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-08-06", "type": "review"}

When Jenny Craig allows me. :D\n\nThe only mini downside was that the place was LOUD - there were two tables of ten or so people at the front and the floor boards and flat ceiling amplified the sound quite a bit :( not sure if the tables at the rear of the venue have this noise quirk.\n\nAnother small note - we were seated halfway into the restaurant and my Orange mobile had no signal/coverage - maybe something to watch out for for those who like to upload Yelp piccies as you stuff your gob :p", "business_id": "WN2QUFWxIiTtUgW-oczrQg", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-08-29", "type": "review"}

But last weekend the hubby and I had time on our hands and decided to pretend to be tourists in our own city.  After all, why let the visitors have all the fun!\n\nWe usually save indoor things for rainy days but with the Camera Obscura it's all about the view so we thought an unseasonable cool but sunny day was perfect - and we were right!\n\nWhen we got our tickets we were given a time slot for the Camera Obscura viewing room - it was only a 15 minute wait so it was recommended that we head straight up to the 6th floor - have our viewing then work our way down.  The staff member also stamped our hands (loved walking around town with a giant green smiley face all day!) - it may cost \u00a314 to get in - but you can come and go all day! \n\nWe found out that this unique building was once a water tower (although it looks more like a lighthouse).  As far as we could tell - the only way up was 6 flights of steps.  Fine for us but a point to look out for.  \n\nWe got to the top - went out to the roof terrace and WOW!  The views were AMAZING!!  Now we could see where all these iconic Edinburgh pictures have been taken.  Definitely better on a clear day - we were so lucky to have sunshine and blue skies.  The roof terrace is nearly 360 degrees (but you have to go out from 2 separate doors) and the Steeple from 'The Hub' blocks some of the view.  There are free telescopes and binoculars dotted around and the magnification is astounding - we could see our house!  And into people's flats!  (NOTE TO SELF:  If we ever move closer to the city centre - head to Camera Obscura and make sure the windows are not viewable from any point on the roof terrace!) \n\nThis alone was worth the entrance fee - but we dragged ourselves away and went into the little round, dark room to see the main attraction.  The Camera Obscura is a lens/mirror contraption that reflects a live, moving image onto a dish in a darkened room.  This too works best with lots of sunlight - so a dull day may lead to a disappointed viewing.  The image was a bit blurry but still cool to see.  It was a bit of fun spying on the people below.  It's like an olde-time CCTV camera.  The guide gave info about Edinburgh and she turned the lens to view different parts of the city.  There are 2 tiers in the viewing room.  We let the kiddies have the 1st tier, right next to the dish.  THis meant that we couldn't participate in the fun of using bits of white paper to lift people off the pavement and make paper bridges for the cars and buses.  It was still fun to watch but next time I'll fight the shorties for the front row :D \n\nAfter the show we spent more time on the roof terrace before heading down.  There are loads of illusions, art, light features on each floor.  Too many to mention in a review, but all worth exploring.  This is really a hands-on exhibit - so do get in the spirit and play about.  My faves were the thermal imaging camera, the psychedelic astral light tunnel, the illusions posted on the walls, the head on the table, the hall of mirrors and the CCTV cameras we could control ourselves - even better at spying than the Camera Obscura.  Now,  what about the vortex?  My hubby (and several others around us)  took 2 steps in and had to leave.  I managed to get through but with my eyes closed.

The location was what persuaded me to visit - meeting up with some people after shopping on Princes Street.\n\nNot much more to add to what's already been said really.  It's a bar that's clearly trying hard to attract, but perhaps not quite succeeding as yet.  Their website is interesting.  It reminds me a bit of my dad - trying to be cool and say the right things, but falling short.  It's not the most original in what it says - you could pretty much cut and paste it to a description of any bar across the city.\n\nAs Cheryl said, this bar has become a place that people simply use to stop briefly in, rather than to spend a great deal of time in.", "business_id": "ZRYZBtiRjjYqA8ohMoRn-Q", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-07-07", "type": "review"}

I've had to rack my brains to see if my recollection of it was as poor as the current reality but upon reading the other 5 reviews here it seems things have always been ropey. Dealing with the positives first my French Toast with Bacon & Maple Syrup along with my friend's order turned up in good time after the order was placed, as did our paninis on the first of our 1am visits. Drinks were also not delayed. On the down side, however, our second late night visit saw us having to amend our drinks order twice (first due to there being no St. Helier cider & secondly due to there being no Rose) and the requested Nachos with no Guacamole but extra Sour Cream arrived with the green stuff & not the white as Sour Cream had also run out. They were therefore left untouched (they looked rather unappetising anyway due to the uber-orange cheese used in their preparation). Invisibility at time of the bill being required was also an issue. As an earlier reviewer points out they have a captive audience but this should really spur them to do the niche they occupy justice. 2-and-a-half years after my last visit here I took the decision to pop in last Friday around Midnight for want of anywhere decent that wasn't soon going to be kicking out. Nothing's really changed since 2008. Both my companion and I ordered Caesar salads and I also had a burger, having wrongly assumed my salad would be starter sized. The salads were of decent proportion but the chicken noticeably dry whilst the burger was no different from what I could manage to remove from a packet and grill myself at home. For some reason too my supposed mango shake tasted mostly of banana. Leaving the rating at 2 because you could probably still manage to sit here for hours and not eat without getting hustled out by the staff but I really must remember not to go here when food's required. Ended up here for food yesterday teatime (not my choice) and got the impression the place had changed hands. Service was good (we were the only customers for the hour we were there so they'd have been hard pressed to mess that up) but the Arabic wrap wasn't as good as some I've had from other places in town of late. \nChange of ownership thoughts were occasioned by what looks to be refurbished seating and the redesigned menu (see photo) which whomever quality controlled it before printing deserves the sack for  as well as the highlighted error it is riddled with 'serve' instead of served and offers 'Quacamole' as well as the commoner, non-duck Guacamole.

As such, considering the pedestal this place has been put on, I've taken a different approach to grading The Witchery. I call it the \"benefit-of-the-doubt' rating system. Goes like this...I gave it 5 stars before I even sat down. Then, took away and added stars as the meal progressed. So, the stars were their's to lose. \n\nWent there for lunch....results:\n\nAmbience - Excellent. Let me just say that this place is spectacular.....out a movie set or fiction novel. But, it's very real and in a beautiful 16th century historic building. A very cool and other-worldly ambience. We sat in the Secret Garden area downstairs...loved it....no stars lost. \n\nService - Fair. Attentive when they were around. But, too slow for me. Big delay between apps and main course even though we were the 2nd table seated. Overall, took 2 hours for lunch and we were never offered anything else to drink after our initial drink orders...not even water....had to ask for everything...1 star lost.\n\nDrinks - Excellent. Judy had a Pimm's, wife had a glass of sauv blanc and I had a Hendrick's Martini with a cuke garnish. Plus, after-lunch cappuccino's were excellent...1 star awarded (they're back to 5 stars!).\n\nApps - Underwhelmed. A selection of bread and butter was served. Bread seemed day-old and cold but tasted OK. I prefer warm bread. Wife had oysters on the half shell and they were reported to be good. I had a seafood bisque and it was presented nicely in an iron pot with crostini (croutons) and parmesan and rouille on the side. But, it was a vey thin soup that didn't have a distinct flavor....I'm sure it was a lot of work but it just tasted like some basic fish stock. I usually think of a bisque as being thicker and richer but this may just be a cultural thing. It was neither good nor bad....1 star lost.\n\nMain Course - This one is tricky. Kids split the roasted chicken with fondant potato and green beans and chips on the side. My wife and Judy got the roasted, hot-smoked salmon with sweet potatoes and green beans. My mother-in-law Mary and I both got Guy Grieve's scallops w/ pancetta and whipped potatoes. Here's the rundown...kids' chicken had good flavor but was very dry....seemed like it may have sat for a while. Their chips were very good, though. The salmon was reported from wife and Judy as being simple but very good. Seems like it had a lemon/butter-based sauce with it and served with green beans. They really liked the dish. Everything about the scallop dish was mediocre. Whipped potatoes were cold (ok, luke warm), scallops were over cooked or had been sitting under a salamander for too long. Pancetta was hard and chewy. Salad was not memorable....1 star lost.\n\nSo, it was an OK experience in the end. My wife and Judy enjoyed their meals. Mary and I didn't. All agreed the service was not the best. But, all agreed the ambience was outstanding. Would go there again for dinner because this place is so special but with the hope of a better food experience.\n\nI", "business_id": "4dIzmqGAhFIcuHfI8CySig", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-08-09", "type": "review"}

Our desserts were wonderful. Hers was a burnt Cambridge Cream with passion fruit sorbet and mine was a Blairgowrie Strawberry and lemon verbena custard tart with strawberry sorbet.

To sub in normal rice was shocking.  And to skip the stated truffle oil was also shocking.  \nWe opted for the dessert platter which we enjoyed and thought was a great value (\u00a310.50), but at \u00a35 a shot the espresso was a wallet shock.  \n\nWe had a voucher for a light lunch, which was two courses, and to that we added a bottle of wine, dessert and coffee.

I know I know, you go there for the atmosphere, but for $25, I expected better food. And like other people are saying, bread were cold. How disappointing. And they pressure you to get wine. Since I was there for Fringe festival and I didn't want to drink before the show, I declined the offer but they kept asking.

It's orientated towards being a modern pub-come-restaurant and the decor suits the overall atmosphere which is relaxed and welcoming.\nMy main complaint with Biblos, as with many others, is with the service.  I came here with my sister and we were directed to a table upstairs where we chose what we wanted from the menu.  After about half an hour of waiting and chatting, however, nobody had come to take our order.  Eventually we just headed downstairs and got a new table where we were finally served.  This is indicative of the service in general which just feels blunt and indifferent.\nThe menu offers a varied selection of food from different types of nachos to sausage and mash.  The food is good but it costs more than I would have expected for a place which markets itself to students.

I favour coming in here during the day for lunch or a coffee, as I feel it works better vibe-wise then.

We both chose to have the T-bone medium rare, with a side of seasonal vegetables. The steaks were big, juicy and had great flavour, occupying the whole plate, with the chips and veg on side plates. The chips didn't seem home-made, but were hot and tasty. Definitely worth the money.
