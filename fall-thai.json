I settled with the Thai Fried Rice with beef.  There was a ton of Thai basil in the dish which was quite overwhelming.  I couldn't be sure if the basil was fresh which may be why the dish tasted a bit rancid to me.  My entree also came with a choice of soup and a small vegetarian egg roll.  I chose the hot and sour soup.  The soup was neither hot in temperature or spice but it certainly was sour.\n\nI was a bit surprised considering that there were a whopping 3 diners in the restaurant that it took a while for the check to arrive and to get drink refills.

I showed up at 930 on Friday night and the place was packed.  I had to wait 15 minutes for a table.  I always feel waiting for a table is more of a positive than a negative as it usually means good things are to come.  I started out with the special shrimp fried in wontons.  It was unmemorable and I would of like to have seen bigger shrimp for this 6.95 appetizer.  I ordered the vegetable tom yum soup.  This was outstanding.  The vegetables were large and fresh and the spice was perfect.  I asked for medium and actually got medium.  I went with the standard pineapple curry as i always do the first time at a thai place.

Nothing fancy, nothing they can charge you an arm and a leg for because it's gourmet or anything like that.  It's just good, delicious, well-prepared Thai food, served by a knowledgable and friendly waitstaff.\n\nLast night, we were starving after walking around in the 90+ degree heat for several hours, so we ordered a few plates of appetizers to split before our entrees.  They have a page of 'daily specials' with their menu, and 'shrimp blankets' were on it, so we checked them out.  Basically, it's a shrimp (tail-on) in a spring roll, served with a dipping sauce.  So very good.\n\nWe also got an order of the spring rolls, which were ever-so-slightly tangy, and the Thai toast, which was so crispy and delicious, I considered getting a second order.  Their cucumber dipping sauce comes with little chunks of fresh cucumber in it.  \n\nAnd since I recently discovered the magic of veggie tom-yum soup, I decided to try theirs.  Oh, so good!  On a hot day, I always crave something salty, and this was exactly what I wanted: the bowl is crammed with veggies and tofu (salty, spicy tofu - yum!), and the broth is just spicy enough to please your tastebuds but not overwhelm them.\n\nThe servers will ask how spicy you would like to have your meal prepared (the soup as well).  I tried everything at a 4, which I felt was just fine.  It wasn't bland, but I wasn't panting.  Our server said that around a 7 is when things start to get seriously spicy, so go ahead and order in that range if you are brave!\n\nI had the garlic pepper pork (my favorite Thai meal) for an entree.  It was incredible, salty and garlicky and the white rice was puffy and just the tiniest bit sticky in that perfectly-prepared way.  Lots of good chunks of veggies on the plate as well, and enough sauce to spread on your rice (and enough food to have leftovers for lunch the next day!).  My husband got the pork fried rice, and it was a huge, tasty portion.  Thankfully, the servers were quick with water refills, because all that saltiness makes you thirsty!\n\nAnother perk - Thai Cuisine is BYOB!  I truly wish we'd planned on our visit last night, so we could have brought a bottle of wine with us (the closest liquor store is down on Butler Street, so a bit of a hike if you're walking), but we just happened to be in the area when my Thai food craving hit.

I don't know what other people have to say about this because I hear conflicting opinions of Thai Cuisine and Thai Gourmet, but I have tried them both and can say that I just like this one more. \n\nMy favorite dish is the green curry. Most veg packed and the tofu option is a great combination (I'm not a veg, but I eat veg often). I really like the way their tofu is steamed, its creamy and delicious in the thin curry sauce. I usually prefer a thicker curry but something about this curry really works as a thin texture - pretty soupy. But it's light and delicious and I am usually drinking it out of the bottom of my bowl like soup. \n\nI get take-out here quite often, and it is always ready fairly quickly, but I really wish they would deliver so I would not have to move my lazy, hungover ass out of my house. \n\nThe dining experience is OK.

I've walked by this place so many times, and I'm glad I finally made plans to eat here. \n\nWhen it comes to Thai food, I'm a bit of a broken record. I love Pad Sew and Pad Thai dishes, and typically insist the table gets at least one. Our table ordered the Pad See Ew, a calamari special, and I ordered a bowl of the Tom Yum Soup. \n\nThe Pad See Ew was delicious, and felt like the perfect comfort food on a colder evening. We ordered it with veggies, and they were perfectly cooked--not too soggy, but also not too crunchy. I was pleasantly surprised by the Thai calamari we had, it wasn't something I'd typically order at a Thai place, but the sauce was awesome, and the little fried calamari's rivaled that of the best Italian places. The Tom Yum soup is soon to be my new go to dish. Once again, it has that feeling of comfort food. Judging on the proximity of this place to my house, I can tell I will be ordering this for take out often. \n\nWe did something very out of character for the group and ordered dessert after eating. I'm not a sweets girl, but EVERYONE SHOULD TRY THE DESSERT HERE. I can't recommend the dessert rice dishes more, they were spectacular. We had one with rice and mango--it's almost like a sweet risotto. Their desserts rotate on a seasonal basis, but they typically will have a rice one on the menu.

Though it was crowded tonight we were given a booth right away. I've ordered Thai ice tea, tod mun, chicken satay, fried pot stickers, fried tofu and a bowl of chicken Tom Yum for appetizers. My entr\u00e9e,  if I still have room will be garlic prawns and sea scallops. My wife will be having #63.\n\nWell we ate our way through the appetizers... Did anything stand out you might ask. The answer surprised even me. I never thought that Thai food was supposed to not have any flavor. I never knew that it was simply a platform for the sauces,  very disappointing. The Tod mun for example was described as a blend of ground fish and best Thai spices. It had no flavor that stood out except for a slightly fishy aftertaste. It was simply a base for the sauce that accompanied it.\nNow the entr\u00e9e,  garlic prawns and sea scallops. .. Prawns to me are seriously large shrimp bordering on the size of young lobsters. At the very least they should be as large as the shrimp that you would get in a shrimp cocktail at a nice restaurant. Sea scallops are fat and juicy with a diameter akin to a half dollar coin.

I took a couple bites and noticed a hair in it. A black, curly-ish, 2 inch long, hair.  I was obviously disgusted and I told the waiter. I said I couldn't eat it and he turned and left. He didn't take the food away, apologize, or offer to bring me something else or a new plate of pad thai. He ran away because he didn't want to deal with it. So, then he finally comes back and tosses the bill on the table and leaves. I tried to get his attention but he was ignoring us! When he finally comes back I tell him that we're not paying for my meal since I couldn't eat it because of the hair. He said he'd ask his manager and when he finally came back he said they could take HALF off my dinner.  WHAT? Really? I took maybe 4 bites total before I found the hair and obviously didn't eat anything. Finally, he took the bill to his manager who took the pad thai off the bill. \n\nAlso, the few bites of pad thai that I did have were awful. Not flavorful at all. The sauce was almost creamy. It was very different from any pad thai I've ever gotten and it was gross. \n\nI understand, sometimes things may end up in the food. I'll be reasonable about that.

It was a 30 minute drive from Laveen, as all are the Thai places in the area.  I ordered two of my staples (Tom ka Gai soup and Green Curry) and tried a new dish (for me), Holy Basil.  I got everything takeout.\n\nI'll start with the Holy Basil.  It was very good.  A nice balance of Thai flavors, and I thought it was quite similar to an Ayam Basil dish I used to get at a Malaysian place in Mt. View, CA.  My only complaint was that the chicken was big, thick chunks, like a fajita-style.  I expect delicate, tender meats at a high end Thai place.\n\nI opened my green curry and said: \"WHERE'S THE SAUCE\"?  I am VERY upset at the lack of sauce.  There was so little I can't comment on the flavor of the curry.  And, they had 2 different types of green beans in there:  chinese long beans, and American green beans.  The larger Amercian green beans weren't cooked.  That sucked.  The beef was tender enough but the peices were too big.  The one redeeming part of this dish was the fact that they had eggplant in it.  There is something about eggplant in green curry....\n\nThe Tom Ka Gai soup was  fantastic.  My only complaint would be the chicken, which again, was large fajita-style slices.   Doesn't make sense to me.\n\nWhile I was waiting at the bar for my order, I remember looking into the kitchen and wondering how they could possibly prepare everything on the menu in that tiny space.  Now, I think I know:  I suspect they prep all of their meats ahead of time and use the same size/shape/cuts for each dish to save time.  This results in a fajita-style cut of chicken that leaves me less than thrilled.\n\nOverall, the menu is brief and the food is good, but I don't think it's worth a long drive.  I don't expect to return when I could make the same drive to get to Swadee, which was just fabulous.  I gave this place a 3/5 because the Tom Ka Gai soup and Holy Basil were VERY good.  I am however disappointed in the green curry, the  cuts of meat, and by the way they completely ignored my request for Thai spicy; everything was rather mild in my opinion.", "business_id": "KPoTixdjoJxSqRSEApSAGg", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-11-08", "type": "review"}

It's an adventure.\n\nWild Thaiger offers some of my favorites that are not to be found at Thai Basil (so mediocre) and Thai Elephant (good but standard) - Dragon's Eggs are a spin on Kanom Jeeb, thai pork and crab dumplings similar to shu mai, graced with a spicy slice of raw jalapeno on top.  Decha Boar celebrates the not often served wild boar in a peppery sauce of basil and telicherry peppercorns.  They understand that pepper can be flavorful in addition to hot, and there's a whole taste profile there just waiting for you to explore.  Best of all, the presentation on the dishes is a work of art - ribbons of carrots and beets as edible garnishes remind you of what a treat it should be to dine out.\n\nIf you are looking for standard Thai, without flair or panache, I could see how this might be seen as too expensive.

If you love Pad Thai and haven't tried Wild Thaiger's, you need to.  If you don't love Pad Thai, it's probably because you haven't tried Wild Thaiger's.  :)  Seriously, this is one of the best dishes I've found in Phoenix.\n\nTheir other dishes are consistently good as well.  I love Chicken Satay, but most places only offer it as an appetizer, with a few skimpy chicken strips.  Wild Thaiger, on the other hand, has a filling Peanut Chicken lunch, as well as a Peanut Passion dinner, both drenched in their delicious peanut sauce.  Their curries are very flavorful and make for a superb and hearty dinner, but if you're going for lunch, you may want to consider Thai Basil up the road as their curry lunch combo includes a salad and other extras.\n\nTheir Thai Tea is strong yet creamy, just like it should be, and you can even add boba to it.  A must if you're eating anything spicy.\n\nThe service is very professional and timely.  The atmosphere is pretty classy, in fact, it's probably the nicest-looking Thai restaurant I've been to.  It's also the only Thai restaurant I can think of with a patio.  All in all, it has a very welcoming atmosphere.  I would feel just as comfortable here in a suit as I would a T-shirt and jeans.  It's a great place for dates, business lunches, or just some great take-out.  You might spend a tad bit more here than at some other nearby joints, but the quality more than makes up for it, I would say the prices are spot-on.\n\nOne day I'll learn how to write a review that's short and sweet, but I kept thinking of good things to say about this place.

At this point she tells me she won't serve me anymore after being a customer for about seven years.\n\nHaving never dealt with the Maricopa Environmental Services, I'm not really aware with how they schedule their inspections but clearly it was a coincidence that it occurred 6 days later. I guess Ola never thought perhaps it was a different customer, or in fact that maybe it was scheduled every 3 months?\n\nAt any rate her reaction to customer feedback is not only unprofessional but just makes bad business sense. \n\nPoor decision Ola, I'm really surprised your sanitation problem, and failing an inspection is blamed on your customers.", "business_id": "KPoTixdjoJxSqRSEApSAGg", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-11-06", "type": "review"}

We started with the Island Crab, which is a crispy shell with crab meat on top - like a deconstructed wonton type of thing, only better! I love the fact that you can see and taste huge delicious chunks of crab, instead of the typical 95% cream cheese filling in most crab wontons. Awesome. For our 'entree' we had a special for the evening that was Thai Sausage and vegetables. It was yummy, and I was even afraid to 'dive in' because the presentation was gorgeous! \n\nIn previous experiences here I've had Pad Thai, Holy Basil Chicken, Peanut Passion and Beef Mangone. All of them were awesome, beautifully presented and my personal favorite... tasted FRESH! I love that every time I've been here the food has been consistently awesome. Fresh flavors, enough spice to taste (you can pick your level on most items), great flavor combos without going overboard - I like that you can taste all the different ingredients instead of having them masked by one or two overpowering flavors. \n\nLast night I had the privilege of meeting the owner, Olashawn. She's an awesome woman with a passion for what she does, and one of the most down-to-earth people I've ever met.

Personally, I've been to Wild Thaiger at every time of day with every friend & family member I know who eats Thai, even my 91-year-old English grandmother who loves it! Their food is legit Thai cooking. If you understood how Thai is made, you'll know why they can't change heat levels, & I really wish you could eat those hotter dishes because they're very flavorful. If, however, you can't take the spiciness, then pay attention to the menu or ask your server about the heat in the dish you're eyeing--stay below 2-stars. Try yellow curry if you're looking for mild, maybe get satay or noodle dishes like Pad Thai or Pad Siew. They have several options below 2-star, as far as I recall (I don't know because I always get curries & usually don't look at the menu anymore). If you really like Thai, Wild Thaiger is unparalleled in the Valley, IMHO! It's very casual, & people are always friendly.\n\nAs for food, they have several good starters, but my favorite is the Satay Sampler. The peanut sauce is gorgeous, but if you get the Satay, ask for the \"chutney,\" which I know as Adjat: rice vinegar, simple syrup, onion, cucumber, & Thai chili peppers, a flavor combo so good I often eat it straight out of the dish when we've finished the sampler. The Spring Rolls are a solid choice as well, light & delicate, &, if I remember correctly, can accommodate vegetarians, too.\n\nTheir Pad Thai is a standard, & if you don't like the peanuts go for the Pad Siew, which IMO is the best noodle dish on the menu anyway. The Pad Thai is very traditional & has great flavor. The Pad Siew is a wide noodle with a beautiful, rich sauce, traditional veggies, & your choice of meat (or no meat). They actually can accommodate vegetarian requests for many of the menu options, so Thai is often a favorite choice of vegetarians everywhere (just make sure your dish doesn't include fish sauce if you're a novice).\n\nAll their curries are incredible to me, some of the best I've had, including my own. If you're not into the heat, stick to the Yellow Curry. If you can take some heat, then go for the Green Curry, though I will add the caveat that the Green Curry can be hotter on some nights than it is on others. If you can really take some HEAT, then go as high as you like.\n\nThe Panang Beef is among my favorite dishes of all time anywhere (it can be made with other meats or tofu). It's definitely got kick, but the peanut flavored curry is out of this world. The Yellow Curry is beautifully delicate with layers of flavor, usually made like a stew with meat & potatoes. The Green Curry is exactly like I'd make it if I had the time to do my own paste like I used to, with Thai eggplant & that unique aromatic smell & hint of flavor that comes from the lime leaves.\n\nFor dessert, when they have it, I always try to indulge myself with some Mango Sticky Rice. It's made with just the right amount of sticky, perfectly sweet, & is topped with fresh mango slices. To drink, they have a full bar, a good selection of beers (including some Thai & other Asian offerings), a decent wine list, & the ever popular Thai Iced Tea, the classic Ceylon tea, very sweet, with milk or cream floated on top (I've never asked what kind of milk product they use, but it's as good as any I've had).\n\nIf you don't like curries then I don't know why you'd be going for Thai food, but they have several other offerings on the menu that don't use curry. If you walk in the door & are looking for someone to shower you with rose petals & kowtow, you'll be disappointed. However, if you come in & a hostess isn't at the door, walk in & make eye contact, maybe say, \"Hello!\" They'll take good care of you. I've been to Wild Thaiger literally dozens of times & have never had the kind of horror-show experiences some mention here! I've had to grab someone's attention from time to time, maybe ask for the check once or twice, but for the most part the service is good & the people are kind.\n\nIt's a small place. The outside is probably bigger than the inside, which in Phoenix is a little crazy, but they'll do their best to accommodate you with the staff they have on hand. If you live close enough or are downtown on your way home, you can always call & order take-out. I find their food to be just as good the next day (if not better) & I often enjoy leftovers straight out of the refrigerator if I can't wait 2 minutes for the microwave. If you can't enjoy their food in your own home, then maybe you just don't like Thai food because Wild Thaiger makes some of the best. I've probably been to every Thai joint in Arizona, as well as restaurants up & down California & in Seattle & Vancouver as well.

I have called to place my order many times to pick up after work and been put on hold which has meant any of the following (since they don't have hold, it's just the phone being put down): 1) being hung up on 2) being left on the counter forgotten about as I've heard many people place to go orders at the desk. There is one employee that has such a piss poor attitude and looks like she hates her life, but everyone else seems great. One time I placed a pick up order with a friend of yellow curry and vegetarian yellow curry. We picked our food up and went on errands. During our errands we get a call saying they gave us the wrong order and didn't include a vegetarian and we could bring it back. We said okay, we're on errands, we will. Apparently it wasn't soon enough for them because they called us back and asked where we were. When we returned they made us show BOTH the yellow curries and took one back, which I guess is fine but every other restaurant I've ever been to would let you keep the extra, and considering we drove back, I would think this is fair. Overall, I will be going back, but only because the yellow curry can't be beat.", "business_id": "wct7rZKyZqZftzmAU-vhWQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-10-02", "type": "review"}

My guess is most won't, given the 4 star average review that originally seduced me and my wife into eating here.\n\nIf you're perusing Yelp thinking to yourself, \"There aren't many good Thai restaurants in Phoenix, and I just don't trust Yelp reviews.  4/5 star reviews always let me down\" and \"This place has 4 stars, I wonder if it's truly a 4 star Thai restaurant or if it's people that haven't had amazing Thai food\" - keep on reading.  \n\nI don't consider myself a Thai food snob.  We like good food but we are not hung up on authenticity.  This night's meal was beyond a total let down though.\n\nTom Yum.  The Thai soup staple.  Like, how can you make terrible Tom Yum?  Even when it's bad it's not so bad, right?  Wrong-O.  This Tom Yum was so bad, it was inedible.  I don't throw away food, but tonight's meal the soup went into the trash.  Sickening, disgustingly sweet.  Mushy (as in possibly spoiled) shrimp.  The soup was so sweet that it tasted like sweet and sour soup.  Look, I get the Thai juxtaposition of sweet flavors against salty, fish sauce vs. palm sugar, etc.  This was not that.  I'd like to think something went seriously wrong with the recipe tonight.  Forget not putting straw mushrooms, galangal, or lime leaf (which none was in the soup), this was like straight Tom Yum paste, shrimps, sliced button mushrooms, and half of a friggin' sugar bowl.  \n\nPad See Ew.  Flavorless.  Skimpy portion.  Dry chicken.  Pei Wei's Thai noodles probably would have been a better option.\n\nYoon Sen Noodle Salad.  Served hot (should be a cold glass noodle salad) - flavor was not bad but nothing like what the dish is supposed to be.  Should be sour with some heat.  We basically got a hot sweet noodle salad without any of those flavors.\n\nSome other stir-fry.  Oily, sweet.  Not spicy.  Dry meat.  \n\nLook, I can't blame Krua Thai completely.  They are just making a crappy version of Thai food for the sweet \"orange chicken\" and \"General Tso's\" craving American palate.  I get that many Thai restaurants sweeten things up.  But holy basil, this was way overboard, and frankly it was disgusting.  We tried to break out some fish sauce to salt the food to counteract the overabundance of sugar without much success.  \n\nI have hope that one day there will be decent Thai food in Phoenix.  After trying most of the restaurants here, I've all but given up.

I was told to dine at this particular branch in Ahwautukee (Chandler Blvd and 44th).  This Thai food is better than Thai Rama (both branches), Sawadee, Mailees and Pink ?. \n\nThe reason this restaurant is good is because the curries are made well. Curry should not have the consistency of soup (Thai Rama). It should be thick enough to mix with rice.  The flavors in the curry were spot on. Their Massaman curry and Peanut curry was cooked perfectly and flavored well.  Furthermore, the curries were spicy but not so hot that you couldn't taste the flavors. The other dishes are great too particularly the sauteed or mixed vegetables. \n\nThe disappointing dishes include the rish dishes. The fried rice had huge chunks of uncut cauliflower and cabbage everywhere...so much so that you couldn't really enjoy it.  Both Thai Rama and Touch of Thai in Glendale have much better fried rice.\n\nThe Negative; The restaurant is extemely tiny and claustrophobic. It is clean and modern so don't think run down Asian restaurant. The service was a little mediocre. The waiters are two young men who go to ASU or just party. They are fast but don't ask questions and not really there to serve you. They want to get you in and out.  So while they won't ignore you, they aren't going to really ask you if you need anything else.  I was disappointed because they forgot to bring one of our dishes. It was almost 25 minutes late when compared to our other dishes that were already served. Instead of admitting the mistake, the waiter tried to argue that the dish was being prepared when it was obvious he was lying and just tried to get them to prepare something ASAP so he wouldn't have to eat the cost of the dish.  That was rather annoying.\n\nBottomline: Great Food but order it to go. You will actually get more food and avoid the mediocre service and small dining space", "business_id": "K4DHwck_2ds1wURnmZdFiA", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-10-21", "type": "review"}

Open to new things.. All they wanted was the BBQ chicken and of course my daughter wanted the very kid friendly,'chicken noodle'. Now I got the Peanut curry which is one of my favorite dishes my step mother makes, and while of course nothing can top your mother's meals, this dish came very close! I rarely ever get to experience authentic Thai food at that quality and words could not explain how excited I was to discover this little piece of heaven only minutes from my house! \n\nNow the pressure was on the rest of my table, would this restaurant I had already fallen in love with be a favorite of my family too? I was nervous at first for their rating because they tend to be very picky, (especially my teenage daughter!!) but she ate every bite on her plate and asked if we could come back again the next week! Success! \n\nMy husband enjoyed his meal too and has promised that he will try something a little more adventurous next time as well. Overall this ranks as one of the best Thai restaurants I've found in the Phoenix area! Finally my family can stop searching for a place we all enjoy!

I decided to try Swaddee based on reviews here.  This is my opinion on what I tried:\n\n1. Tom Ka Gai Soup:  To be fair, I am comparing this dish to what is generally considered to be the BEST Tom Ka Gai in the SF Bay Area (Dusita Thai in Sunnyvale).  I'd give this dish a 4/5.  The flavor was spot on, but light on ingredients.  Also, they didn't use those little button mushrooms, and for the $ they are charging, I think it should have the correct mushrooms!\n2. Green Curry:  5/5.  Superb.  Fabulous.  They could add some eggplant though.\n3. Spicy Fried Rice:  4.5/5.  The flavor was good, it was cooked properly.  If they offered it with crab, it would be mind blowing.\n4. Green Papaya Salad:  3/5.  I was disappointed that the sauce wasn't quite right.  I don't know what makes the dressing so tangy, but they should use more of whatever that is!\n5. Spiciness:  I order my Thai food as 'Thai Spicy'.  Seriously, restaurants will question me repeatedly because they are afraid to serve it to me the way I like it.  I ordered everything except the Green Papaya Salad as a '5', which is supposed to be their Thai spicy.  Not so.  They would have had to double it to give me what I was expecting.  \n\nThat said, it was quite good and I will return.

Seeing that it's closed on Sundays (thanks Gabi!) I convinced a friend (okay it didn't take any convincing at all) to head to Swaddee in our continuing search for best Thai food in Phoenix.\n\nSwaddee is hidden away in the corner of a plaza, but the inside decor does not disappoint. It's not too large and not too small. Rather, it's just the right size. The tables were simple. We had a one with a black cloth, an image centered in the middle, and a glass overlay but I was completely drawn to it. \n\nWe started our meal with the small portion of Tom Ka with chicken and it was amazing. Some of the best I've had. It had the right amount of spices and flavor as well as the right amount of heat. My main course was the pineapple curry (medium), which was just as incredible. It was a little hotter than medium, which was perfect and full of flavor. The shrimp were huge and delicious and the pineapple was fresh. For dessert, my friend ordered the coconut ice cream and I ordered the golden banana (banana and coconut in a spring roll). We ended up each taking half the banana and opening it like a spring roll and putting ice cream on top. Hands down this is one of the best desserts I've ever had. Even if you dine alone at Swaddee, you *have* to order both. I'm not going to lie. I might come back here just for dessert. \n\nI'm glad to have finally found another Thai restaurant other than Malee's I can call home!", "business_id": "vtQOervVVTXjhvSZQiZ6PA", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-09-20", "type": "review"}

The lady who greeted us was very nice, and was the same person who served us and cashed us out for that matter. Decor was fairly standard for a Thai food place, including the compulsory fish tank right in the middle of the room. My boyfriend had his absolute favorite Pad See Ew. Which he enjoyed as always. I had the Green Curry with chicken. We both opted for the 1 star spiciness, I think the server laughed at that, but c'mon, I'm Finnish and French-Canadian here lady, my palate is not made for Thai spice! It was the perfect amount of spicy for me, and that good, creamy, warm green curry flavor. The vegetables were perfectly cooked so they still had that crunch. Maybe it was because I wasn't paying, or maybe it's because I've been desensitized by East Coast prices but I thought that $24+tip for the amount of food that we got was perfectly reasonable. I think it's a solid place. \n\nSidenote: I see that most people have responded \"No\" for delivery, however on their website, for this location it says \"Call and ask about free delivery\" so I don't know if it's new, or just lesser known.", "business_id": "vtQOervVVTXjhvSZQiZ6PA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-11-08", "type": "review"}

Thai music filled the small restaurant. The restaurant was decorated with elephants as well as common Hindu symbols and art. The tables were covered with fabrics of colorful patterns. Curtains of the same fabric covered the windows and entrances to the kitchen and bathrooms. The back wall was painted of a Thai beach. My family and I were greeted by a small Thai hostess who asked with a friendly smile, \"how many?\" and then proceeded to lead my family of five to a table, while she held a conversation about how our day was. She even tried to make my little sister laugh, which was unsuccessful because my sister is quite shy, but it was still nice having such a friendly waitress. Since the restaurant was small and not very busy, our waitress was fully attentive and took care of our every want and need right away. The service was amazing!\n\n First, my family ordered a large soup called Tom Ka Gai. The soup included chicken, mushrooms, bamboo shoots, etc. The soup had the perfect spicy kick to it, while having an amazing flavor, too. I definitely recommend this to all customers! Next, our entr\u00e9es arrived. I ordered the Siamese Twins which was a green curry. It included chicken, bamboo shoots, Thai leaves, green beans, and white rice. The sauce was, just like the soup, the perfect combination of a spicy kick and a tasty flavor! It was so delicious, I cleared my whole plate!\n\n The Mint Thai Caf\u00e9 is one of the best restaurants I have ever been to and it is my favorite. I plan to dine here many more times in the future and I suggest lovers of Thai and spicy food take the time and eat there. Not only was the food amazing, but so was the service and the environment. You walk into a pure and friendly Thai culture, which a lot of restaurants around here do not have. It is also small and not too busy so it is nice being away from big crowds and loud areas.

I don't care, because I love this place! I grew up eating here, and now I come here every single time I visit Scottsdale - AND I recommend it to everyone I know who visits as well. I've probably eaten twice my weight in Szechuan Stringbeans over the years, and triple my weight in Szechuan Eggplant + Tofu.\n\nHere's why I love it:\n\nIt's NOT OILY like most Chinese food places. It TASTES AMAZING (I highly recommend the Szechuan dishes). And they are willing to add or substitute items to your dish to FIT YOUR CRAVINGS. Beat that, Panda Suck-spress! And it's all MADE FRESH and FAST in a hot wok, right there in front of you!\n\nRecommendations: Get the loose-leaf hot tea, it's delicious and served in a fun mug. Get an order of the Szechuan Stringbeans (with your choice of protein, I recommend tofu), and an order of Szechaun Eggplant (also with your choice of protein), and douse everything in some healthy scoops of chili sauce to hike up the spice factor. You'll notice that the Szecuan sauce varies from dish-to-dish. The stringbeans are very sweet and savory with a thin sauce, while the eggplant's sauce is much thicker and more savory.

Flo's is definitely for the Americanized palate:(  a group we don't belong to.

Also ordered #2-Thai Style Calamari & Chiles. (Breaded calamari seasoned with chile-pepper salt, diced bell peppers, green onions, and a hint of lime). Next #3-Chinese Lettuce Wraps. (Chicken in a sweet hoisin sauce with water chestnuts, mushrooms, and green onions.  #4-Pot Stickers (Pork), and #5-Singapore Chicken Satay (Skewers of tender chicken breast drenched in a rich peanut sauce). The chicken appeared to be ground and somewhat gritty but the peanut sauce was tasty and worth 2 1/2 stars.\n#1 & 2 were listed as spicy, - NOT, no heat at all!  The wings were crispy and had a nice flavor, alone I'd give them a 4 and the Calamari were quite tough and chewy, cut in long thick strips and had a \"fishy\" taste and no spicy taste I'd give a 1.  Also decided to order their Chinese Hot & Sour Soup - A thick and hearty soup made from an old village recipe with chicken, shrimp, tofu, mushrooms, eggs, cilantro, and green onions.  that had rated several rave reviews, I wonder which soup they really had.  No hint of spice, a strange aftertaste and a rather large portion that didn't taste like any other hot & sour soup we have had. Rated it a 1.  The lettuce wraps had no water chestnut crunch and little flavor and rated a 2.  The pot stickers were somewhat dry but with fair flavor and their accompanying dip needed help, gave them a 2 1/2 as I would also give the Lettuce wraps.

Unfortunately, Yelp wasn't used in the recommendation for this place, but a friend of mine took me here once and I thought everything was amazing.  I've been coming back ever since.  Last night, my fianc\u00e9 and I went there for dinner.  For the appetizer, we ordered the Combination Special for two, which has a lot of favorites on it - the satay chicken, thai egg rolls, and my personal favorite, this little meat pie thing, which I don't know the name of.  LOL  My entree was a personal favorite of mine, the spicy noodle, and my fianc\u00e9 ordered the pad thai, both equally delicious in their own right.  \n\nTo give a little background of this place, it's own by this cute couple who have owned the restaurant for over thirty years.  The husband does all the cooking, and the wife takes care of the front.  They take time off every now and then, so when that happens, their children help out, and the daughter looks just like her mom.  They're such a sweet family.  Each time we come here, there aren't too many people seated, but they have quite the following.  They get a lot of to-go orders and a lot of regulars.  Each time we've gone there for dinner, they've always been super friendly.  One time, my fianc\u00e9 ordered something other than Pad Thai, and the lady said, \"What? No Pad Thai today?\"  It was funny and amazing she remembered because we had not been there in almost a year.\n\nThe location is in a weird place, and it's a little hole-in-the-wall, but I often find that the hole-in-the-wall places often serve the best food ever.  The best thing about this Thai restaurant is that they don't rely heavily on dry spices to spice up your dish:  they actually use FRESH Thai peppers to help spice things up, which is something I prefer.  So if you haven't been here yet.....WTF are you waiting for?  Get over there already!!!! Oh and for dessert, you must try the coconut ice cream.  It's not over-powering and not too sweet.

A cross between urine, a gym, and rotting chicken would be the best way to describe it. I should've turned around and walked right out. However, some \"ethnic\" restaurants have an odd smell to them so I decided to forge ahead, past the HUGE fish tank with 3 fish, kids laying on the floor, and tables that look like they haven't been cleaned in a month. There were awards everywhere raving about the cuisine there. Well, I don't know what was wrong with the people presenting these awards because they obviously have no taste buds. \n\nSince I ordered my chicken green curry to go ahead of time, I didn't have to wait long (thank baby Jesus). I got home and discovered that the GREEN curry, was somehow red not green (even though it was in fact green curry). Not only that, but there was hardly any vegetables or chicken in it.

As mentioned above, this is a take out joint primarily.  If you reviewed on the ambiance or waiting service, its the equivalence of rating a hot dog stand for its lack of decor or comfy upscale seating.  If you are this type of reviewer, please step away from your computer.  Understanding this is mainly a takeout/delivery place is common sense.  There are almost no tables, no sign to either wait to be seated or to seat yourself, and no reception area whatsoever.  There is a waiting bench right by the cashier and you can clearly see tons of takeout bags and boxes being prepped on the counter.\n\nAs far as takeout and delivery service goes, they are excellent.  They always get the order right, including special instructions, and now you can order from them online.  Everything is well wrapped or contained neatly and perfect for carryout.  Soups are in sturdy plastic containers and they do not scrimp on size, or give less because they do not have a large enough container.  Large orders are placed in sturdy boxes.  Everything is  prepped well for the travel and upkeep of the food, and even reheat.  They don't go cheap in this area, even their napkins are nice and thick good napkins.\n\nLittle Dumpling also excels in terms of price and value.  They tend to be cheaper then your regular Thai places like Siri or Pin Kaow, and as cheap or cheaper than a Panda Express.  Yet you get a lot more not just with volume but where it counts.  When I order a meat dish, there is tons of meat, not filled with oversized chunks of onion or a disproportionate amount of baby corn or bamboo shoot and other filler.  When i order a shrimp soup from other Thai places Im usually hoarding the shrimp, saving it because there are only 5.  At Little Dumpling I am never for more meat or key ingredients like mushrooms.  The portions are also huge.  A takeout order of Pad See Ewe can easily feed 4 (if you are also ordering something else family style) and have leftovers.\n\nFor a divey takeout place like this, I might give it 5 stars  given everything I've stated so far. (context, I judge according to what it is supposed to be).  What keeps this place from being stellar is that the food is hit or miss.  Almost all the typical chinese lunch specials like Orange Chicken are good, especially the ones centered around meat (like the former) but other standouts are Lemon Chicken, Orange Beef and Beef with Broccoli.  The beef is usually good, not the poor quality small grey chewy scraps you find at other chinese places.  The beef is usually cooked well, really good sized pieces and good quality.  Im not talking about a Morton's cut, Im speaking comparatively.  The broccoli is usually cooked just right as well with just enough crisp but not crunchy, soggy or greasy.\n\nAll the meat centered Chinese dishes are great as mentioned.  Surprisingly, the best dishes are some of the Thai ones.  The Pad See Ewe is great, just the right ratio of noodles to egg to beef and veggies.  They also make it a little spicy if wanted, without losing its flavor to the heat.  My favorite dish here is the Tom Yum Kung soup.  It's swampier than I've had from Thai restaurants, but every ingredient comes bursting through.  You can really taste the lemongrass, tomato, and spices all meld together beautifully in their soup.  I've tried many other thai places, and no Tom Yum Kung comes even close to comparing.  Almost all have only 5 shrimp, and microscopic ones at that, cheap small mushrooms, with an overpowering sour taste and little of other flavors coming through.\n\nSome of the dishes can sometimes be just as greasy as Panda Express.  Ironically their fried dumplings are nothing special, but fine.  And steer clear of their Japanese dishes, like Teriyaki bowl - I don't know why you would order that from places like this anyways, and if you are that person, you probably don't listen to reviews and tips anyways", "business_id": "V6csWcyvwOg_E2ni3V_CgA", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-11-12", "type": "review"}

To my pleasant surprise, everyone was super nice and very helpful.  As I'd never been here before, I asked for suggestions and tried the Pad Thai (which I've never had ever - here or anywhere else) and I thought it was immensely tasty.  Being a vegetarian, I opted for no meat and they helpfully obliged, even adding in tofu (at my discretion.)\n\nI also got the thai tea, which I adore: delicious.  Added boba which was super soft and silky smooth, exactly as it should be.  \n\nWhile I waited, they bought be a bowl of free soup also, a spicy and sour (I think that's what it was called) egg soup in a chicken broth (for hardcore vegans or veggies - avoid) but it was super tasty and I sort of regret not ordering it in the first place.\n\nOverall I think this place is brilliant.  Not very modern, but very clean and friendly with great food and good people.  I'll definitely be coming back!", "business_id": "H2eCY4wIIudy5C0BW5Y3ZQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-10-04", "type": "review"}

I wouldn't say it's the best thai food, but I like what they have to offer and the friendly service. \n\nThe first time I tried the Pad See-Ew, and it was perfectly done. Maybe because I was hungry, but it was the rich greasy ness and spicy ness and the vegetables were all good with it. The lunch always seems very, I can't think of the word, giving. I believe it came with soup, salad, vegetable roll, some sort of fruit or dessert, salad and the main dish. I think it also came with rice even though I had a noodle dish. The second time I had the Pad Thai, and that dish to me is always hit or miss. For me it was more of a miss, because I believe the sauce was too tangy and saucy, so that it would really make the noodle sticky and kind of overdone and not good. The beef in the dish didn't look very appetizing, but it was fine. I still thought everything was pretty good to eat, but it probably more leans toward 3 stars, but I like the place for no intelligible reason. The lunch special is only like $6 if I remember correctly. :D", "business_id": "H2eCY4wIIudy5C0BW5Y3ZQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-11-14", "type": "review"}

If you're a clean freak then I wouldn't make a visit, the furniture is badly dated and badly worn, this includes the table that you'd be eating on.

The chicken is juicy, the produce is crisp and fresh and overall the meals are delicious without being typically chinese-takeout-greasy.\n\nThe girls who greet you are refreshing. Unpretentious, humble and intelligent. English skills are lacking but let's be honest, that's part of the experience. It makes for great ambiance. \n\nThe lunch specials are great at 6 bucks.

None of that fakey, plastic-y stuff that you often find at asian-fusion restaurants.\n\nIf you're dining in, it's a clean place with great options. (Also, good dessert which is important!) :) Often, even on busy weekend nights, the chef - which I believe is the matriarch of the family - comes out and asks you how your food is. She is the sweetest little Thai lady and you don't get that hospitality at restaurants any more. They don't pretend to have Michelin stars, but they are very good whether you are dining in or out! Highly recommend.\n\nTry the yellow curry and egg rolls!", "business_id": "H2eCY4wIIudy5C0BW5Y3ZQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-10-08", "type": "review"}
