The white icing is just perfect and not too sweet.  When I told my neighbor that I was coming here tonight to pick up the cake, she immediately asked me if I had ever had the carrot cake.  Yes, I have, and it is amazing!  The burnt almond torte rivals Prantl's.  I think the girls who work there are so nice and helpful.  And I love all of the homemade candy that they sell.

Not the end of the world I thought and we would just have to eat the cake the next day. Then about 15 minutes later received a phone call back from Potomac telling me I had to return the uneaten portions of the cake and get a partial refund- I was floored. They messed up here not having my cake ready yet I had to return the cake for a PARTIAL refund for what wasn't eaten??? Absolutely horrible way to treat a customer when they were the ones in error. I explained that I disagreed with this policy and they should be making an effort to correct the situation of sending me a cake that wasn't ready, they explained that this was their policy and were not willing to work with me. \n\nI expected a call Monday from management apologizing for their staff handling the situation incorrectly but never was called. Apparently they feel that frozen cakes are acceptable for events. Sad part is that I have always loved their cakes and pastries but based on their views towards their customers will NOT be going back.\n\nThanks for the disappointment to me and my son!", "business_id": "WY6FFxpa6ztwDH5OhS6WDw", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-09-22", "type": "review"}

Wife got a chocolate frosted longhorn style donut that was covered in sprinkles. I feel like a good measure of a place that claims to have amazing donuts is their plain cake donut. If you can do this properly, then good things are to come when you order other things. This was probably the worst plain cake donut I've ever had. It was dry, not at all crispy, and had no flavor. I couldn't even finish it. And I love pastry. I would have rather had a cake donut from Giant Eagle or Dunkin Donuts, and that's a sad statement. Those are honestly better. The cinnamon roll was just ok, until I bit into the center, where the dough was almost raw. I understand not wanting to over cook your cinnamon rolls, but this was not a fun surprise. I sampled my wife's donut as I wanted to be able to comment on it, and I found the chocolate icing to be artificial tasting. This is the first time I've eaten donuts and thrown pieces of everything away.\n\nThis place was...well, edible. I didn't find it to be anything special.

I stop here at least once a week to get my carb on.  I absolutely love this place, and let me tell you why.\n\nI first discovered their delectable bread at the farmer's market a few months ago.  I'm forever on a quest for a good bakery.  The had samples of everything they offered that day, so I got to try a few different things.  That first day, I purchase their spinach and feta bread (like a savory, moist challah bread - so good!!).  The texture was perfect, and the eggs made it such a moist bread.  I also tried their blondies that day.  For two dollars a piece, you get a 3x3x1 (or slightly bigger, depending) bar cookie.  It was so buttery and fantastic!  Since then, I've tried many different styles of their bread and desserts.  Their garlic cheddar bread is divine, and they have some of the best whole grain breads I've ever tasted.  If you like a nuttier bread, their Dakota is chocked full of pepitas and sunflower seeds.  Even their low carb whole grain bread is fantastic, and it doesn't taste like the light bread you buy in the store.\n\nBest of all, they don't use any preservatives in their bread.  They use freshly milled grains (ground within 24 hours), which apparently retains some of the natural protein found in the grain.  They also sell all of their goods within 48 hours and donate unsold bread to charity.  Their ingredient list and nutrition information is readily available on their website, along with a schedule of days when certain bread is produced.  The rotate their menu every month, although they do have some bread they offer every day.  The staff has always been patient, friendly, and helpful in answering questions.\n\nWhen you go to their bakery location, you can try anything they have out that day as well, including desserts, cookies, and \"scuffins\" (a cross between a scone and a muffin).  They also offer sandwiches, homemade jelly, and coffee, but I've not tried any of them.  For the holidays, you can purchase pies or their \"jewel bread,\" which is basically a super delicious fruit cake.\n\nTheir prices on bread are about $4.50 to $6.50, which seems a little steep until I think about all the bread I end up wasting when I purchase store-bought loaves.  It's a rare occasion that the bread I buy here doesn't get eaten.  \n\nIf you're looking for healthy, fresh bread, this is definitely the place to go.", "business_id": "q6liXMxYTMYx7evcgz1eQQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-11-21", "type": "review"}

I really liked the scones, but I didn't like the fact that they didn't open until 7 which usually made me a bit late.  I didn't even consider that they might have more than bakery goods, and every time I had stopped the place seemed empty.  This was of course due to the fact that it was 7:01 AM and I was the first person through the door.  So this weekend, based on Chris & Kelly's recommendations, I stopped in for a nice leisurely breakfast before heading into the office.  I found out that all this time I was seriously overlooking a great place right in my neighborhood.\n\nI was a bit taken aback by the number of people inside.  The place was pleasantly crowded, with the warm buzz of morning conversations and a relaxed atmosphere.  I walked up and ordered the breakfast special - I was used to just picking out scones so it took me a minute to get my bearings and find the menu board.  The price was OK, not under $6 but not more than I would have expected anywhere else.  I was given a number and found a nice table along the bookshelves.  I'd never really taken the time to look around the place before, and I was really impressed by the decor.  I got a cup of coffee from the self-service area, which is a great idea - I love diners where your cup is constantly refilled but I tend to keep drinking so long as there's coffee in the cup, leading to the over-caffienated jitters.  The coffee was excellent, truly delicious and fair trade to boot.  I savored it while I read a magazine and waited on my breakfast.\n\nAfter a bit of a wait the breakfast special came out.  The wait wasn't especially long considering the amount of people there, but I was into my second cup of coffee by the time my food came.  It was served on a fairly large plate, so my first impression was that there was not much to it, but this was a mistake.  The special, which was basically a Denver scrambler, was completely satisfying, filling but not heavy.  The wheat toast was much better than the average bread you get with breakfast, quite possibly highlight of the food.  I was pleasantly surprised by the whole breakfast experience here.  I wasn't planning on finding such a great place for breakfast in the Prairie Cafe.

After fellow Yelper Tawnie R boldly declared the People's Bakery as the worthy successor to Dimitri's, I knew a trip to the People's Bakery was in the cards for me.\n\nIf you are looking for elegant digs, this place is not for you.  It's a kitschy, little greasy spoon nestled into a strip mall at the corner of East Wash and East Johnson.  There's not a lot of seating and if someone is on the phone, you're going to be privy to their conversation.  In my case, I got a comprehensive update on a bedbug infestation of a family member that the owner's wife was describing in painstaking detail.  And while the chairs and tables are mismatched and the floor tiles are coming loose in places, the eating surfaces were all impeccably clean and the pictures on the wall gave the joint a homey feel.  And the husband and wife team that run the place have a great rapport with the regular customers getting their lunch fix. \n\nI ordered the $5.50 gyros and fries and grabbed a seat.  About ten minutes later, a massive foil wrapped gyros was delivered to my table.  I swear that an entire herd of sheep were sacrificed for this meal.  In terms of quantity, the People's Bakery delivered big time.  \n\nOn the quality side, things were a little less clear cut. First the negatives:\n* The next time I visit, I'm going to ask to have the pita spend a little time on the grill.  This dish deserves better than a cold, doughy pita.\n* More tzatziki sauce please!!!  When you give me a metric ton of lamb meat, I need more than a tablespoon of sauce to balance out the dish.\n* The same can be said of the tomatoes.  I need more than two very thinly cut slices.\n\nNow the positives:\n* The meat was served piping hot, moist and well seasoned.  It was clear this meat wasn't sitting under a heat lamp awaiting the lunch time crush.  The only thing I would have changed is to have a little char on some of the pieces to provide more textural contrast.\n* The onions served with the dish were pure awesomeness.  I'll be honest, I usually pick most of the onions off my gyros because they can overpower the other ingredients with their sulfuric pungency.  With a medium dice, these onions were fresh and sweet and complemented each bite.\n* I l-o-v-e-d the fries that accompanied the meal.  Salty and crunchy on the outside and hot and moist on the outside.   Yummmmmm.\n\nSo, does the People's Bakery unseat Trader Gus as my King of Madison Gyros.  I say it's too close to call right now.  What I do know is that I plan to return to the People's Bakery to conduct more extensive research.  And if you find yourself on the east side with an empty stomach and a light wallet, People's Bakery is an option worth considering.", "business_id": "Ryq600aoE3h8_qRQGIed9A", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-11-16", "type": "review"}

They are very organized package bakery perfectly.  I never had anything smushed by being jammed in (like other places).  They rarely struggle with stocking or maintaining an attractive display.  I have never felt ignored or frustrated by cash handlers.  These are amazing accomplishments factoring in the madness of the CSFM.\n\nMy change your life recommendation is their Napoleon. It is the eclair's hotter sibling. Oakhouse's offering is a ginormous & gorgeous pile of puff pastry, vanilla cream and vanilla/chocolate glaze decadence.  The layer offers dynamic and perfect flavor combinations vs. the eclair's often disappointing cream to pastry ratio.\n\nNext time you go to the CSFM... sting Stella's and make a beeline to Oakhouse.

Seems the whole building dines there at one time or another.  \n\nThe other evening our A/C in the building failed and was out for about 6 hours on a 100+ degree afternoon and evening. We went over to Coco's for an ice tea, and we mentioned to them what had happened with the failing AC. Along with the Iced Tea, they gave us some of their wonderful Cocoanut Creme Pie 'on the house' in a thoughtful and kind attempt to cheer us up after living with no AC for several hours.  This little kindness mean so much to us and certainly it was not expected... but that bit of reaching out to cheer us up did in fact make the whole world look brighter for a while! We survived the heat, loved their iced tea and when we got back home the AC was running again at last! \n\nIf you're in the area, stop in. The food is good, the service above your expectations and the people are incredible.  Much more than we would have ever expected from a small chain-type restaurant.  Be sure to try the Cocoanut Creme Pie, too. It's become our favorite, even when we pay for it !!", "business_id": "SZvYxcvYYVRue9MXcEDjsA", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-09-26", "type": "review"}

EPIC PASS.  I was very impressed on the tastiness and freshness of the ingredients.  The bread itself had the desirable softness and texture that I would expect from a genuine baguette (as I had in France).  The saltiness of the ham, the balance of the mayo, the eggs and lettuce was just superb! I truly enjoyed every bite!\n\nI had a side of pasta which tasted kind of fresh and dressed with I thought was bleu cheese (I didn't clarify with them).  For beverage, I had a very good tropical tasting, iced tea.\n\nI thought the decor was friendly, warm and inviting with French artwork while music played in the background.  The owner and his wife basically run the show.  They were very friendly and attentive.  I will strive to come here as often as I can so I can fine tune my French.

Located in the old town area, I thought that a small, family-owned french breakfast place would be the perfect refreshing break from the trendy (Read: untsss unttsss untss music) mimosa-brunch places and overly-priced-food restaurants. I wanted something fresh, homemade, french and delicious.\n\nWe ordered an iced latte, a nutella crepe with fresh fruit and whipped cream, a croissant with egg and sausage and a normandy creme (ham, cheese and egg). The food came in before the waters and drinks, and unfortunately, they seemed prepared ahead of time and left to sit.\n\nMy normandy crepe looked (visually) delicious. When I started digging in, I noticed that it was a little cold (aka not prepared fresh) and that the cheese was barely there and already solidified and not gooey. The flavors were ok but the crepe contents were very flat, so they were very stingy on the portions of their ingredients. The crepe was topped with a sunny side-up egg but had no sauce or added flavors to it. I tried adding hot sauce but it really didn't make the dish any better. That was about $8. My iced latte was approximately $5 and really tasted like coffee with whole milk - and the coffee was not a great quality. Not an enjoyable meal.\n\nMy friend ordered the nutella crepe but was delivered a crepe stuffed with fresh fruit instead. Apparently, the order is EITHER a fruit crepe or a nutella crepe, not a nutella crepe served with fruit. When they took it back, they returned the same plate with a hint of nutella placed on top (my friend has already cut into the crepe earlier). The whipping cream was not your typical type: it was very dense and heavy, a weird combo between whipped cream and thick evaporated milk.\n\nThe service was decent but we were the only people at the restaurant besides from 2 other ladies who were just having coffee. The place was very empty, which is sad to see considering the 3 breakfast places adjacent to it had a 30-40min waiting line. I really want Au Petit Four to succeed but they need to overhaul the quality of their food and the attentiveness of their staff. With no customers to make them busy, there is no excused for stingy cold food.", "business_id": "wftoNIA0Q8nX-Da47psBCA", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-11-12", "type": "review"}

My only complaint about them is that they aren't bigger. I was literally rationing my croissant throughout my meal so that I could have a bite of it with every bite of my spinach & mushroom omelette - which by the way was also fantastic - and that's coming from someone who's paranoid about undercooked eggs and NEVER eats eggs unless they are cooked in her very own kitchen. \n\nWe ended up wracking up an almost $60 bill because we brought home a doggy bag of baked goods from the attached bakery. THEY WERE TO DIE FOR.\n\nhttp://instagram.com/p/SbAhDjsBH7/\n^ pic of the baked goods I got.

For previous birthdays, we had gone to Bakerwee, Tami Coe, and some other delicious bakeries in our area. This time, I was on short notice and I needed a cake that would be big enough to feed a lot of kids, and that my daughter could personalize with some custom options. \n\nEnter Barb's Bakery. We read the reviews on yelp and looked at their site online - their prices were fantastic and their reviews were stellar! We placed and order and hoped it would all work out. We had a couple of last minute changes, but they were more than accommodating, and they were still as friendly as can be!\n\nWhen we went to pick up the cake, it was HUGE and it was gorgeous! The half sheet was PERFECT for what we needed. Better yet, it was DELICIOUS. Seriously. Out of all of the bakeries we  had been to before, I've never raided my fridge on subsequent days after the big event to get cake. I did this time... several times. \n\nPerfectly moist, the custard filling was perfect (perfectly sweet, but not too sweet!), and it held up for at least three days after her birthday before it was gone! Our fridge was raided constantly by cake seekers, looking for that afternoon pick-me-up or something sweet to go with their coffee. \n\nWe will be doing ALL of our cake shopping at Barb's from here on out.

In my world, this does not compute. It needs to be as tasty as it is pretty. Period.\n\nSo I can only give kudos to the artfulness of a Tammie Coe Cake, but nothing more. Cakes where you are told to remove the fondant and then eat it... that's not right--you should be able to eat it all--and yummily so. If you like the taste of fondant... you've got to be kidding me--Yucky!\n\nSo take my review or leave it. I just think a cake needs to be tasty and moist first and pretty second... less of course it's for a wedding, than it needs to be both EQUALLY. Who has ever said no to an ugly but great tasting cake? Not me. So I'm putting my foot down and saying I won't eat a cake or cupcake that isn't tasty to me.\n\nNow, I must state that I am more a fan of cake than frosting. Frosting is secondary to me. So if you are more for frosting than for cake, ignore my note and have at all the Tammie Coe's and Sprinkles of the world--and have mine... no really, go ahead.\n\nIf there IS frosting--for me and others like me, a little bit of frosting goes a long way with one exception: If it's Whipped Cream Frosting... then BRING IT ON! I like frosting's more subtler relative so if it's a Whipped Cream Iced cake, I won't make it a point to get an inside piece, or scrape off the icing at all as I would a basic frosted cake.\n\nAnyway, Tammie Coe's cakes or cupcakes don't do it for me. If I have to partake in one of her treats, I'd shoot for her pastries or cookies before cake or cupcake.\n\nAs for MJ Bread, I have no complaints there... their breads really impressed.

The french fries were a little thin and not too memorable really.\n\nMy son had the wings and loved them  But a hitch - I SPECIFICALLY requested RANCH for the wings, and they came out with Blue Cheese, which I then had to take back and get exchanged for Ranch.  Not a huge problem, but just a little annoying.  The Ranch was very good however.\n\nThe \"Olive Oil Cake\" that everyone RAVES about?  Meh.  It's just an extra-moist version of your average pound cake.  Tastes just like the pound cake I grew up eating in Texas, but it was a little \"oilier\" than your usual pound cake fare.  It was good, but not \"Oh My God!\" good.\n\nNow for the best item I had from there:  The Drool Creator.\n\nIt was mostly an afterthought, really.  While standing in line to get the Olive Oil cake to go, I saw the little section where they keep their \"to go\" salads.  I looked around at the varieties, and thought the Chopped Turkey Salad looked promising - bacon, boiled egg, turkey slices, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and two different dressings - Blue Cheese and some sort of yellowish vinaigrette.   I decided to take one home and eat it for lunch at work on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nGreat.  Decision.\n\nI don't really know what the magic was.  Maybe it was just a good combination of flavors.  Maybe it was just all fresh.  Maybe they use some sort of Magical Salad Crack.  I don't know.  But it was a DANG good salad.  Even on the third day, when I ate the last of it.\n\nI just combined both dressings ( about half of each little container each day ) and it was marvelous.\n\nNot too many meals cause me to drool in between bites.  This salad had some serious Mojo.\n\nI WILL be back for another one, hoping to recapture the Magic.", "business_id": "R8VwdLyvsp9iybNqRvm94g", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-10-26", "type": "review"}

You have enviable prowess in providing cramped spaces both out front, inside, and even around the neighborhood in which you reside. You make a mean pot of coffee, and you have a glorious array of sandwiches. If you were a Gerbil, you'd be the king of all gerbils in the kingdom. For that, I salute you.\n\nLGO has been a family favorite for years ever since they opened. We used to go for lunch every week, and I'd eat the BLT every time, not because I'm not adventureous, but because it is THAT good. Whole wheat toast, a heaping pile of fresh bacon, and avocados. No BLT I've ever had, even ones at home, can touch it. The Commuter Sandwich with smoked salmon always hits the spot at 7 in the morning with my hot cup of Ethiopian Dark Roast. For dinner, you can't beat their pizza with anything other than a Chris Bianco pie. Yes, that's right, I said it, one of the best pizzas in town. \n\nSo why, after raving about all of these items, is LGO a four star establishment? Service inconsistencies, pricing, and parking. Numerous times, I've been annoyed by the LGO police, girls who think they have as much authority as a mall cop, because they work there. Get over yourself, you make $7 an hour to slang beans and sandwiches. You ain't no Vice Lord. It's a rare occurance, but it doe happen from time to time. LGO, just like your girls who work there, you need to realize the products you're pimpin aint hoes and crack. $9 for a breakfast burrito with no sides, $3 for a bottle of water, and $12 for a note book is obnoxious. I can go to Kmart and buy the same note book, sans the \"made locally\" stamp, for 99 cents. Parking is A to the trocious. You can't help that, minus .003 stars. Last but not least, please for the love of all that is holy, offer a bigger size for your iced tea. I'll gladly pay for it.

I've never tasted bacon so delicious.  \n\nTuna Sandwich- sliced cucumber and apple give it a fresh taste that makes me forget I'm essentially eating a bunch of mayo.\n\nSome salad I don't remember the name of- tangy, spicy, Asiany.  It wasn't really worth remembering, but it wasn't that bad either. \n\nGreen Chili Mac-  My weakness.  Who can resist gooey cheese and green chili?

The sweet potatoe sushi roll, vegetarian breakfast burrito, and the mother earth pizza (which can be made vegan and/or gluten free) are all great choices!  \n\nOther highlights: the commuter sandwich with turkey, the AMAZING pizza, and their splendid iced green tea (or anything else from the coffee bar).  \n\nBut finally, I dare you to taste a Tammie Coe pastry that doesn't blow your mind.

Beginning first with my love of pastries, the first of these six stops would be at the combined grocery, caf\u00e9, bakery, liquor store, souvenir stand, and pizza parlor that is La Grande Orange Grocery; the sort of place you have to see to believe yet the sort of place where it all seems to \"fit.\"\n\nHarbored in a small strip mall with plenty of parking plus curbside checkout for those on the go I made my way into La Grande Orange only half knowing what to expect and having already mentioned the commodities entailed the only thing I could think of when I entered the door was a trip to Whole Foods if you condensed the entirety of one store into a space approximately one quarter the size.  With cups to one side and cupcakes to the other, wine to my right and coffee to my left my first impression was one of total sensory overload yet at the same once I entered and started to browse I detected a sort of controlled chaos as the various lines moved toward their destination with a good flow.  \n\nHaving already eaten breakfast and had plenty of coffee with pizza plans at Bianco for later in the day I took my time investigating the space - children's toys, shirts, travel mugs, cheeses, pre-made salads, locally roasted coffees - before finally approaching the pastry counter to browse the cornucopia of goods.  With many items baked in house and others provided by Tammie Coe Bakery two doors down I weighed the options carefully while additionally gauging my hunger and although any number of the options sounded delectable I ended up settling for two; one my own choice and a sort of obligation at this point and the other a recommendation from the young woman at the counter as \"the best thing in the world;\" a promise I told her I'd hold her to if she was wrong, and after paying the modest tab I made my way to the street with my choices packed up (ostensibly for later, but in reality for enjoyment less than thirty minutes later as I checked into my hotel.)\n\nBeginning first with my selection, La Grande Orange's very own Red Velvet Cupcake, this large specimen wrapped in red wax paper and topped with an ample pile of cream cheese frosting would prove to be one of the better Red Velvets I've had in some time save for the stellar version at Bouchon Bakery just one month prior.  Loaded with notes of cocoa and sugar plus the faint taste of cinnamon and what I'm pretty sure was clove I really enjoyed the subtle nuance to this cake and despite the $3.95 price tag the portion was substantially larger and the cake significantly more moist than more expensive versions in other major cities.\n\nMoving next to the suggestion of my cashier, the Tammie Coe Crumb Bun, I really was not sure what to expect of the $2.50 option but what I received, while not the best thing in the world, was without a doubt the best sweet I had on my visit to Arizona.  Beginning first with the exterior, this golden biscuit looked something like a cinnamon roll meets a scone with a spiral texture encased in crystal sugar, but digging deeper and peeling off a layer the texture was instead somewhat akin to the famous Breton Kouign Amann kissed with cinnamon and topped with streusel.  Layer after buttery layer, bite after yeasty bite, and making a mess of the carpet (crumb bun indeed) all the while all I can say is that if you find yourself in the Phoenix area this is a must try and given the quality of both selections I was lucky to be staying so far from La Grande Orange and Tammie Coe because otherwise I'd have gone back for more.", "business_id": "R8VwdLyvsp9iybNqRvm94g", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-10-13", "type": "review"}

I had no idea LGO was a small group of restaurants originally started in Phoenix. After many, many excellent Misfit meals I decided to eat my way through each of their unique dining experiences back to the original which I believe is LGO Grocery. \n\nHere, my favorite Kale salad with the awesome grapes sits in a plastic container to go for only $7.50. It doesn't look happy, so I snag one along with an ahi sandwich to share. Eating here could be an adventure, but we missed the lunch rush. Choices are the floor of the grocery, (bad idea), the restaurant which isn't open yet or the 96 degree beautiful day. Hmmm.....the empty restaurant seems logical. Here, I find china, silverware, drinks, glasses, ice, etc and I'm able to correct the presentation of the wonderful kale salad which makes it taste much better! \n\nThe ahi sandwich is a first---I've never seen in in the Pasadena LGO (a completely different concept), or the Luggage Room (also in Pasadena).\n\nLGO Grocery also sells Italian recipe authentic homemade gelato. Incredible! Oh, and did I mention there's a coffee bar with great coffees and a knowledgeable barista! \n\nWow, the only thing I missed was the cookies, but the raspberry and espresso gelatos were wonderful as was the entire experience.\n\nAs for the store, cute stuff, nice food items and an excellent wine selection. There was a lot of rare Northwest Pinot Noirs, Red Blend and other favorites. Apparently, free corkage during happy hour, too!\n\nNow, I understand the genesis of Misfit and next stop is Chelsea's Kitchen.\n\nFood 5 star\nAmbiance 5 star\nStaff 5+ star", "business_id": "R8VwdLyvsp9iybNqRvm94g", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-10-08", "type": "review"}

Sure there have been other restaurants that have stirred such emotions but for whatever reason - generally distance or a desire to try something new - I have not yet had the opportunity.  With that said, I've now been to La Grande Orange Grocery and Pizzeria four times in four months and if you count Chelsea's kitchen as part of the LGO empire that number becomes five - the most times I've been to any single space except perhaps the quick casual and fast food restaurants I frequented during my childhood and early years of college.\n\nDescribed simply as \"an organic coffee and breakfast bar, caf\u00e9, pizzeria, and funky retail grocery\" La Grande Orange was one of the first places I visited on my seminal trip to Phoenix and the place I first suggested to my mother after driving cross country to pick up gifts for my sister and aunt back home. Sort of like The Cracker Barrel (for mainstream reference - I apologize to those I may have offended) or Southport Grocery and Caf\u00e9 (more appropriately) in scope with a small store and bakery up front and a full-fledged kitchen/restaurant in back I'd originally planned to write my standard review of LGO and all of the things I've purchased, eaten, and loved but eventually decided that such a mission would be shortsighted and considering the fact that I now own a home in Phoenix also rather futile - unless they close/burn down or I move/die this list will simply grown and grow.  Instead what I will do from here on out is seasonal updates with salient notes and pictures; from the black and white garden gnome salt&pepper shakers, toad banks and elk-horn knives to the baked goods, pancakes, and pizzas I love this place.\n\nEthiopian Reserve Coffee/Decaf/Black and Tan from ROC2:  I'd be lying if I didn't admit that at least half the reason I spend so much time at LGO is related to the free Wi-Fi and copious refills of coffee from The Roastery of Cave Creek.  Owned and operated by Dave Anderson and Michael Smith with operations not far from my home I've been lucky enough to enjoy some of their single origins from Central America, but for a blend the two offered up at LGO are both excellent with brighter citrus notes accenting the Ethiopian and lower cocoa and earthen notes in the Black and Tan.  Beats wildflower or paradise any day of the week in the battle for best freely refillable coffee.\n\nCroque Madame with Whole Wheat, Tomato, Egg, Ham, Gruyere:  I don't like Dijon and as such I requested the Croque without and what I received was superlative as the savory ham and aged gruyere were briny and bold yet tamed admirably by the crusty bread and sweet, bright tomatoes.  Topped off with a runny egg, sea salt, and just a touch of cracked pepper this wasn't quite a traditional croque but it was delicious...though the accoutrements of sour pickles and sweet melon didn't really 'fit.'\n\nFamous French Pancakes with honey, strawberries, and cr\u00e8me fraiche:  My grandmother was Hungarian and as I remember it she was also a very good cook, a talent my mother unfortunately did not inherit save for a couple of dishes; one of these dishes was Hungarian palacsinta or sweet pancakes.  Sort of like a French crepe but with a bit more tooth LGO's \"French Pancakes\" reminded me much more of palacsinta than crepe and while others may think this a bad thing I thought it was sublime.  When mom comes back to visit this is on the short list of 'must tries.'\n\nBlueberry Muffin with Whole Wheat Streusel:  Admitting my sweet tooth and wearing it on my sleeve, the first of many pastries sampled at LGO (aside from the Red Velvet Cupcake during my recruitment trip) was this, a killer whole wheat muffin topped with buttery cinnamon streusel and literally bursting with fresh blueberries.  Clearly seasonal with their focus on using fresh, never frozen ingredients I was stunned by the quality of the berries as summer had recently come to a close but hefty in butter and berries while light and fluffy on the bite this was a great muffin.\n\nPumpkin Spice Muffin:  A second muffin, this one just before Halloween, was even better than the first in terms of composition - and with a surprise burst of tangy cream cheese filling on the inside a contender for best pumpkin novelty I've had in recent memory.  Big and bold with the flavors of pumpkin, cinnamon, and nutmeg all perfuming the palate and moist like pumpkin pie without being wet I particularly loved the salty toasted pumpkin seeds topping off the muffin - a savory touch that worked nicely with the sweet filling.\n\n...more to come", "business_id": "R8VwdLyvsp9iybNqRvm94g", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-10-26", "type": "review"}

A bag of these and a jar of local honey, preserves, or pretty much any topping sold at LGO Grocery would make for a lovely start to Sunday breakfast at home.\n\nBlackberry Almond Dumpling:  If this is available at LGO you should do yourself a favor and buy two.  Powder sugar dusted and crispy like a croissant on its exterior with a wispy pull-apart interior somewhere between the aforementioned croissant and a cinnamon roll this 'dumpling' was rife with frangipane and fresh blackberries, but more so with butter.  Served warm and well-endowed to make a substantial mess of clothing both black and white I would recommend this one only as a fork and knife pastry, though any mess you make will be worth it.\n\nPistachio Chocolate Cream Puff:  A cream puff per LGO but a dressed up Paris Brest to me this wheel of choux was perhaps not as texturally sound or traditional as some of the hazelnut versions of France and elsewhere but with crackling pastry topped with a cocoa shell and crunchy pistachios plus an interior of pistachio tinged pastry cream it would be hard to be disappointed by this one.  Every bit as unique as Dominique Ansel's Paris/NY but not quite as decadent I personally loved the sweet meets savory aspects of this one but would definitely go early as the shell was starting to get a bit moist by the time I enjoyed this around noon.\n\nCr\u00e8me Fraiche Coffee Cake:  I'll totally admit to being a sucker for coffee cake, and even more for butter cake - but prior to entering La Grande Orange that Saturday morning I had no idea there was cr\u00e8me fraiche cake.  With the traditional style obviously focused on sour cream, or in the rare case cream cheese, this take would up the ante in the savories department and with sours nicely balanced by cinnamon and what I swear was cardamom and maybe even rosemary I could have eaten a whole loaf of this if LGO had provided me jam.  With a fine crumb and delicately sweet this went great with coffee but I could see it equally well suited alongside afternoon tea and sandwiches or cheese.\n\nOld Timer Cupcake:  Having already enjoyed the Red Velvet cupcake on a prior visit (as well as the Red Velvet Cake from LGO at Chelsea's Kitchen earlier that day) I decided to try the Old Timer on my most recent visit to LGO and while I'm not sure if you can call it a cupcake since it is covered top to bottom with a crunchy dark chocolate shell and therefore more like a Ding Dong (or King Don for you Midwesterners) it is still quite delicious as the dark chocolate shell, airy chocolate angel food cake, and light cream all come together much like the classic Hostess version, but with a bit less of the artificial sweetness.  Great with a cup of coffee there is really nothing 'special' here, just a really good piece of chocolate cake that goes nicely with a cup of coffee (or a big glass of milk.)\n\nAtoZ Cookie and French Sea Salt Chocolate Chip Cookie:  Two more things that go great with milk or coffee, these half pound cookies are without a doubt amongst the best I've ever tasted.  Two choices amongst a daily half-dozen or so each of these decadent creations sets a high standard for texture with the outer rim slightly crisp while the interior falls just short of 'set' but where they truly excel are the ingredients - the former a sort of kitchen sink concoction of corn flakes, caramel, oats, toffee, and who knows what else while the second is simply a perfect dark chocolate chunk cookie heavily garnished with a hefty shake of fresh flaked fleur de sel.  Go early when they're warm - and before they sell out.\n\nCampfire Smores Brownie:  In a word, decadent and in another, intense; for the chocolate lover this is an absolute must (but even then it is probably best shared.)  Dense, moist, and rife with dark chocolate while house made marshmallows and graham crackers attempt to add some levity this certainly isn't an everyday treat but as a capper to a an LGO pizza it worked quite nicely.", "business_id": "R8VwdLyvsp9iybNqRvm94g", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-10-27", "type": "review"}

Without hesitation she told me to come here. After, I saw some of my friends had glowing reviews for this spot, I adventured my way over.\n\nParking was a struggle (but hey, when isn't it for me in a rental car?) but it was well worth it. You know those moments when you walk into a place so cool and eclectic you just have to walk around and find your bearings before you can sit? That's what my wide-eyed happy self did when I walked through the front door. \n\nThere are a few patio spots, but I nestled right in a cozy two person table by the front door to hammer out some work. I went to the front to order a drink and felt like I met some new friends. Everyone was kind and so helpful which gave me a lovely home-ee feeling. I went to the wall cooler and grabbed a beer and needless to say, my productivity soared. \n\nI kept smelling intriguing pizza so I had to grab a couple to-go when I left. And... some cupcakes. I got a cheese  and roasted corn with goat cheese pizza and they tasted as good as they smelled. It wasn't a greasy pizza and it had just the right amount of flavor to make each bite beautiful. Been to CPK? The pizzas are about that size. Want to be completely stuffed? Order one for yourself or have a great meal for two. The S'more cupcake was out of this world bursting with goodness.

We ordered our wedding cake here. I'm not going to lie the cake was beautiful and it tasted great. I had quite a few compliments and questions about where I ordered the cake from. The reason I am writing this today is because a month ago I had a recent charge to my checking account and it was the deposit check for $50 from Fleur de Lis. This check was a deposit for cake parts that we returned. Anyway, parts were returned but yet my check was still cashed over a year and a half later! I have tried to talk to the owner/ manager Liana, who said she would check on the situation and get back with me, but I never received a call back. I tried to call back today and find out why this check was cashed when I know these parts were returned. She even ventured to say \" this has happened before!\" Which made me think they have done this to other customers. It's not the $50 that irritates me it's the principal of the matter. After I spoke with her today she said she would have her accountant call me back, but I have yet to receive one call back. This is just bad business and I would encourage others to go elsewhere for your wedding cakes because this bad experience is not worth dealing with no matter if the cake is good or not.

I'm not sure how or why this happens. If you ask around many have already formulated a various theories. Some feel it's the way the condiments are layered amongst the slices of meat and cheese. Others think that it's a secret ingredient that maker uses like a dash of celery salt or paprika. My mom used to make me a sandwich of sliced turkey, Muenster cheese, Miracle Whip, bread and butter pickles on Wonder bread. I've made this sandwich so many times but have never been able to make it taste as good as hers. \n\nI recently tested this out at Breadcrafters Bakery and Cafe in Paradise Valley where they specialize in fresh bakes breads, house made salads and of course sandwiches made by someone else. Breadcrafters isn't your ordinary sandwich shop, as the name indicates they also bake bread and pastries, but oh the bread! For me this is one of the best bread bakeries in a town that only has a handful of really good bread makers. \n\nTo celebrate such amazing bread, why not make amazing sandwiches? \n\nNancy's Favorite ($7.75) arrived piled high with roast beef, Gorgonzola and roasted onion spread, roasted red peppers, lettuce and tomato on a crusty baguette. Aside form the chewy flavorful baguette and the tender roast beef, the bold and creamy notes of the cheese spread makes this sandwich a stack-of-love. By contrast the Turkey Jack Stack ($7.75) had a spicy bite thanks to pepper jack cheese and red onion. The sourdough bread it was served on was so spongy and flavorful I ordered a loaf ($4.50) to go. \n\nUnfortunately the Park Avenue Chicken Salad ($7.75) was under-seasoned; its only saving grace was the incredible raisin walnut pecan bread it was served on. On my next visit, Ill just pick up a loaf ($4.50) of the bread and skip the salad. \n\nWhen you order a sandwich you have your choice of potato salad, pasta salad, fruit, coleslaw or potato chips. I might avoid the disappointing potato salad. The potatoes were oven roasted which is great but the spuds were over cooked and dehydrated making for a chewy strange tasting mess. \n\nThe love doesn't stop at their bread; they make cupcakes that are moist and inviting. On my last visit I picked up a Red Velvet Cupcake ($2.75) and a Strawberry Shortcake Cupcake ($2.75).  On my way back home I couldn't stop thinking about the cute little white box housing my treats. Once home, dessert came first! The shortcake cupcake wasn't shortcake at all but made from angel food cake, then topped with real whipped cream and a glazed strawberry. This was one of those desserts you savor and enjoy though I ended up eating the whole thing in about four bites, yes it was that good. Wiping the crumbs from my face I proceeded to convince myself that I would only have a single bite of the red velvet, wrong. I couldn't resist licking the cream cheese frosting off before devouring the moist and ultra chewy cake. \n\nWhile there is still no concrete reason why a sandwich made by someone else's hand is better, I do know this, I enjoyed trying to prove this one out.", "business_id": "j5HLcBru7FEirYJPbKFVWA", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-10-15", "type": "review"}

I have only had  a Nothing Bundt Cake  once before and  everyone raves about it so I decided to try it out.  I called on the phone to oder.  Given it was a 1/2 birthday I had envisioned 1/2 a cake. (odd yes I know but google it, I'm not unique) 1st I asked if it was possible to do 1/2 and  1/2 cake, I was told that was not possible.  No worries completely understand. Then I ask if it could be cut in half and was told that NO that was not possible.  Again understand. I requested an extra box  because the venue I was having the party in required that if a cake was brought in it must be in original packaging  an since we only required half a cake we would need the box. I was told no worries it would include an extra box. \nWhen I got to the store to pick up there was a young associate helping me and before she rang up my oder  she seemed confused then stepped away to the back of the store.  I over heard the conversation with a man who said \"that is an extra charge for the box\"   She came back and rang me up  at the same time the man (I can only assume was owner or manager)  walked by and I expressed my  dismay that I was being charged (yes only $1) for a box that on the phone i was told I could have. (did I mention that the cake was NOT even in a box but in a bag.  He then said to me ...\"oh  i remember you.. we spent 1/2 hour on the phone with the half birthday.\" (apparently my order  was an annoyance)  I quickly corrected him because it was no where near 1/2 hr and that I understood that he could not accommodate my other request  but I am a little surpised that you are charging me $1 for a box that you told me I could have. He then said to me rather sarcastically \"what would you have done? What would you have done if  I told you it was $1 on the phone??.... I have to pay for the boxes they cost me money \"   Then he went to the cash register  opened it up and rudely  SHOVED a $1 in my Target shopping bag!!  I chose this store because it is in Ahwatukee and the Cakes are supposed to be amazing, but when  the customer service is so incredibly rude I will NOT be back and I'll be sure to pass on my experience to anyone who desires a cake for a special occasion.  WHY? because anyone can defrost a cake and put frosting on it but it is the customer service part (the feeling like your business is wanted ) that will bring people back. \n\n PS...The cake was Just ok...  I was trying to choose between Lemon and Pineapple when I ask him  on the phone  for his advice his reply was \"well we only have pineapple once a year\"  not distinctive at all.....

This is the second time I have been dragged to a Paradise Bakery at breakfast time. I can't take it anymore. There was a review for another location where the reviewer says it looks when you step in the door that Paradise has promise. That is so true.\n\nWhen you first walk in and are looking at the bagels, the baked goods, the menu, the purple lights, you almost forget about your last, horrible experience. Have no fear, once the food is served, you quickly remember. I ordered a croissant breakfast sandwich - no ham, and a medium coffee. Seems simple enough. They brought me the sandwich WITH ham. I didn't know when I first bit into it. This ham is still alive, it is so tough, I am sure this is what Wilson rejects for their footballs. What is wrong with you Paradise? Why would you stick a huge slab of tough ham inside a croissant. A croissant that wasn't even toasted. Which brings me to my next comment. You stick an egg on a croissant and you make no attempt to toast the croissant? Even Dunkin Donuts toasts the croissant. You have no clue how to make anything. Even after Panera acquired you, they couldn't impart any wisdom into you? And coming from Panera, that would be little wisdom since they have a terrible menu, which you made worse.\n\nIt was good to taste the same bitter mud, er, coffee, that Panera serves.\n\nParadise, you owe me more money for this disgusting crap you served me, but why can't you try to improve? You clearly can't think this food is good? You remind me of the fat girl in school who boys would tell her, she had a cute face just to get some action out of her. Someone once lied to you and told you, you had a cute face and you believed them. The fat girl was fat and being used, and you don't have a cute face.", "business_id": "JJGkhOmfOFamPbCAaRKPPw", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-10-01", "type": "review"}

I always sit in the separate sitting are with the counter (and booths that hold 2 peope).\nTypically my food is excellent. Wait staff service is iffy on how fast it is, and if your coffee is refilled.  Wait staff are long timers and good, but the place seems to be short staffed all the time.\nEvery time you check out--in my experience--there is a line at the register--it's either not staffed or the person is in efficient.\nOn Sunday it took 20 min to check out and pay.  And it was the Coco's lady at the counter--not the customers.  The pie orders are very manual and take a long time.  The lady here today did not know how to process a coupon for the customer in front of me--she had to call a manager to authorize it.  She was also answering callers from outside--who were ordering those slow manual pie orders.  The line was still stacked up to 8 behind me (like it was when I got in line).  It's a backup line becuase it's so slow and inefficient.  The checkout needs help.\nThe restaurant was maybe 1/2 full when I cam in, but all 5 of the booths in the room with the counter, were not bussed, and two seats at the counter too.  It took a long time to get my order taken, and my food was not hot when it was delivered (it was sitting up there.  The lady serving the counter room was also serving the dining room customers --same as last time I visited when this same scenario playyed out.\n\nNot sure if people are calling in sick, they had a special big party, or they just are short staffed, or trying to save money on staff.  The assistnt manager that looks to be on duty, can help refill coffee and stuff, but moslty he's a little oafy in handlign his apparently new duties or fill-in duties at this restaurant--though people seem to know him--he is not very efficient at makign the restaurant run efficiently.  The wait staff seem to tolerate him, no appreciate where he does try to insert himself--I find him not a good manager.  \n\nTHis is symptomatic of my 3 visits the past month.\n\nI orderd pumpkin nut pancakes--very good--exctite that serving of \"pumpkin chiffon\" that seems to be flavored butter, but tastes like thick gross frosting that is pumpkin flavored.  It did not melt on the pancakes and was intolerable.", "business_id": "1DDTdvU06tng7o0vU7-rig", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-11-19", "type": "review"}
