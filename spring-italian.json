Our waitress was not knowledgable of all menu items, and three of our  very simple requests did not come out as ordered. ( dressing on the side of a salad,  less feta on an entree and no oil on another entree) The waitress blamed it on the cook, but did offer to get one entree changed. Also we were asked if we wanted pine nuts, feta or Gorgonzola on our salad and then were charged 2.00 extra per item in addition to the salad price (6.99) which brought the salad up to 10.99 !

This was the first time we've been to this restaurant. We usually stop a Riley's Pour House across the street for a bite before seeing a show in this town but today we decided to shake it up and do something different.\n\nThe place is deceptively larger than it looks from the outside. It was also busier than we would have expected on this particular evening and we got one of the remaining tables which was located near the entrance and the bar. The traffic from both the customers and the staff that flowed past us was a little noisy and distracting and we could tell that's why it was one of the last tables available. But our waitress came by promptly, got us drinks (I had a Hoegaarden and my girl ordered an Absolute water and cranberry), gave us menus and recited the specials of the day.\n\nAfter viewing the menu for a bit, I decided on the Veal Parmigiano; my date went with one of the specials, a chicken and broccoli gnocchi dish. The plates took about 15 minutes to arrive and the portions were humongous... enough for a filling lunch the next day. My veal was tender and delicious but it's really the gnocchi that left the biggest impression. You could tell that it was house made; it was like little fluffy pillows dissolving in your mouth with each bite. I never tasted gnocchi like it before.\n\nOver all I give PaPa J's a big thumbs up. The food was good, most of the dinning area's seemed cozy, the building itself has a certain charm with its high ceiling and the tables draped in white table cloths give it a pristine appearance. Although I thought it was a bit pricy, I didn't feel as if I've been taken.  Other than the location of our table, it was the pre-theater perfect meal.

We were seated in the bar area by the sidewalk, which is what we requested because of the great weather and the happy hour specials. Our server took our order of a gingerale, fried zucchini appetizer, side salad, wedding soup , eggplant rolotini and chicken piccata ( correct spelling).\n\nWe thoroughly enjoyed the bread & wedding soup.\nThe side salad was rather bland and unexciting, lacking flavor & texture. The Spring salad consisted of leaf lettuce, a single slice of tomato and one black olive. I would have expected some additions such as onions, peppers, cheese, cucumbers, croutons, carrots and the like.\n \n  We enjoyed the fresh air while waiting for our appetizer, but were growing concerned that it would arrive too close to the meal, so we asked the server ( bartender ) about the appetizer and he told us that he had forgot to \"put it in\". He offered to put it in at this point, but advised us that our meals would be out soon. We decided to just wait for our meals and forgo the appetizer which were looking forward to. \n \n  The main dishes were acceptable, not outstanding. The eggplant was very tasty and well prepared.  The Chicken Piccata was flavorful, but not as expected.\nThe chicken seemed to have been steamed or baked. It had no signs of being coated and saut\u00e9ed  to a rich golden brown. The chicken was just pale white.\nThe sauce was a simple lemon flavor, it lacked any depth that would have resulted from the browning of the chicken. I tasted no garlic or shallots. The sauce lacked that famous tang usually supplied by capers, which were absent.  No pasta was served with the chicken. The side of vegetables were well cooked, buy again lacked any real flavor. The would have benefited from a roasting which would have produced a rich savory taste produced by extraction of the natural sugars.\n\n  Once our meals were finished  our plates were taken and we waited another 20 minutes for the check. The server seemed more concerned with what was on television rather than his customers. The total was $43 and change.\nI would have expected the salad and soup would have been removed from the bill for the error of not putting in our appetizer order, but no such offer was made and \nI saw no manager come around and check on the customers, as is customary.\nI am hesitant to go back to this restaurant or  recommend it to anyone after tonights dining experience.

I, too, decided to give Pino's a shot once we saw how packed nearby Point Brugge, which had initially drawn our party due to its reputation, was. It was a relatively nice evening, and I thought the concept of fresh-air dining was too good to pass us by. We were immediately greeted by Jen, one of the co-owners, as we entered. I made it a point to compliment the beautiful inlaid tile in our tabletop, and she volunteered some additional information about their production that I found to be very interesting. \n\nI really loved the bistro burger. I requested it to be prepared \"Medium\", and sure enough it lived up to my expectations---you'd be surprised how many times I've ordered a medium burger only to have it served well-done and nearly bone-dry at other restaurants. Nicole, our waitress, proved her weight in gold when she reassured me that gorgonzola would be a good cheese to accompany the bacon on the burger. We also ordered the macaroni & cheese as an appetizer. I thought the ziti was a bit dry, but the sauce and cheese were delicious. We really loved the bread and the garlic butter spread. I was hoping for an oil & vinegar blend to have with the bread, but the spread served as a surprisingly tasty alternative. My partner's ravioli looked delicious, and he let me try one of his meatballs, which I found to have that \"homemade\" flavor that's difficult to find at many restaurants. Our friend loved her arugula salad, and as a seafood aficionado I was impressed by the very generous size of the shrimp she had. Our service was prompt---our water glasses had barely gone half-empty before our waitress scurried over to replenish them. \n\nOverall we loved our experience and WILL be back!

The prices aren't the cheapest, but for what it is Pino's delivers small plates and dinners that are satisfying without breaking the bank. The lamb bolognese is one of my personal favorites, as well as pretty much any of the appetizers. I also love the creative cocktail list and the half price bottles of wine for happy hour. There are few places in Pittsburgh that can get me as excited about cocktails as Pino's. My roommate and I have come here with friends and sat at the bar for hours eating and drinking a variety of delightful things. In short, they do drinks and food quite well for the price. \n\nThe reason Pino's only gets three stars is the unfortunate inconsistency with service I've encountered. I get treated differently depending on who I come in with, and that's unprofessional. If I'm with my roommate and one of my friends (both of whom work nearby) we all get seated quickly and treated extremely well. In short, it feels like my presence is valued. When I've come to Pino's with people who aren't in with the owners though, I've had a thoroughly lackluster experience. Once I came on my birthday with my boyfriend and frankly was let down. We waited awkwardly for a very long time to be seated even though there were empty tables and in general had a very impersonal experience. I felt embarrassed having spoken so highly of Pino's to him beforehand. I know I'll be back for the occasional happy hour or small dinner, but Pino's isn't somewhere I would take anyone I wanted to impress due to the problematic service.", "business_id": "ZL6DNzyenFm9Kpz6uADlNg", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-03-10", "type": "review"}

We called a cab at the end of our meal and decided to get drinks & wait back at the bar. The cab was taking forever, so we called a different company. As my boyfriend was talking with the cab company, a waitress walked by. We heard her walk into the kitchen and loudly announce to the rest of the staff, \"UGH, those people at the bar are JUST now ordering a cab.\" It was 10:30. On a Saturday night.\n\nI don't know if it was the fact that we were some of the youngest patrons in there (early/mid 20s), but we felt talked down to and disrespected the entire time.

We were waited on quickly, a couple waters for each of us, then after perusing the menu we decided to split a pie.

So that being said I thought that I would probably think it was pretty typical, however I was definitely wrong.  I can't say this is the best pie I have had locally but it is up there in the top 5.  Even with all the toppings the pizza stood nice and firm.  The crust was delightful and I don't typically like a thicker crust.  I would say their crust is probably traditional, I prefer thin, but this was so light and airy that the texture was about perfect.  I am not sure about the steak they use.  Couldn't tell with the array of toppings if it was more of a steakum type of meat or not, but together it all tasted delightful.    Between the two of us we finished the medium pie no problem.  \n\nMy only suggestion to people coming here for lunch is it is busy and you will wait.

I have walked by the cart and store many times before without really stopping to check it out.  That day we decided to though since I was hungry and did not want a full meal and boy am I glad that we did.  Originally I was just going to get one of the loaves of bread to have a bit then and save for later but then I noticed some true french bread pizza (aka pizza toppings on top of a slice of french bread) which I ended up getting.  While I was ordering that my fiance noticed some Sfogliatelle and she ended up ordering one of those as well.  I think the total cost was $3 and Jimmy told us the story of how the sfogliatelle was created while chomping on his cigar.  Both of our items were good and both my fiance and I were espcially impressed with the sfogliatelle.  It had a lot more filling than we are used to getting as well as a more orangy flavor which made it extra good.  Honeslty she was just happy to find a good Sfogliatelle in Pittsburgh.  She is Italian and is used to getting them with some family members at some Italian bakeries in NYC.  The second time that we came here was once again at the cart on a Sunday when Jimmy enticed us with sfogliatelle that was fresh out of the oven and still warm.  Finally the last time that we came was on a Saturday and so the whole store was open, not just the cart.  It was interesting to look around inside and see everything that I had been missing by walking past it all of these years. There were a number of display cases with a ton of baked goods in each of them and it also looked like they served a bunch of different lunch type items like sandwiches to go.  Jimmy once again waited on us and as always was super friendly and told us some stories that we enjoyed.  We ended up leaving this time with not only sfogliatelle for my fiance but also for her parents.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I will definitely be back here again in the future.

My stepson and I were on our own for dinner so made sense to go out for the evening. So I picked this place knowing it was a kid friendly joint and not chili's or fuddruckers etc. The building itself is great. I loved the feeling of going into this renovated looking warehouse. He thought it was cool as well. The best part was inside. the decor is fantastic, and really the only reason to go. Loads of vintage signs and things and smack in the middle of the one dining room - a real vintage trolly car - completely renovated... of course I asked for us to be seated inside there... that was really neat. \n\nThen the food came... I had spaghetti and Meatballs and a Caesar salad. Now, the salad was really flavorful and fresh. Normally I hate salads in places like this. the lettuce tastes old and rubbery... not in this case. it was excellent. The spaghetti on the other hand - wow, watery, slightly overcooked noodles and sauce I bet was straight out of a Hunt's Spaghetti sauce can. the meatballs were frozen and reheated - i hate that off taste frozen meat takes on. so the salad got an A and spaghetti was a bit loser. \n\nMy stepson ordered the Italian wedding soup - he loved it - I did not try it... he also got the same watery noodles with the mushroom red sauce. Those mushrooms must have come straight from a can. they were button and the one I tasted had that tinned flavor.... so essentially this restaurant depends completely on frozen, processed, canned ingredients rather than fresh and flavorful. \n\nBottom line... have kids with you? they will love it... just the adults? find something... anything else... it is going to disappoint.", "business_id": "9mwShpTgZofOujt4JfyGmw", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-04-09", "type": "review"}

The decor is cool and varied and the place itself is quite large. There is free parking which is nice, but parking was hard to find on a Friday night. We had a semi-large party (about 15-20 of us) and it took us well over 30 minutes to get seated. Clearly they knew we were coming, so it shouldn't have been a surprised to them.\n\nOnce we were finally seated, it took 30 minutes from ordering our drinks (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic) to actually getting them to the table. We still hadn't even looked at a menu when the drinks finally did arrive. From there the service picked up slightly and we were presented with warm bread, garlic butter (decent) and salad. I dislike iceburg lettuce so this was meh. Given that we were a large party, obviously we were given a limited menu selection. I ordered \"The Incredible 15 Layer Lasagna\" and it certainly wasn't 15 layers, unless you count the loads of marinara on top as, say, 10 layers. My cousin ordered the same thing and ended up with a piece of chicken on his plate, don't ask me why. The lasagna was okay, but I've had better from a Stouffer's frozen meal.\n\nMoving onto dessert, I ordered the tiramisu. Might as well just call it white cake with \"espresso\" drizzled on top. It was still slightly frozen too. No thanks.\n\nFrom start to finish it took us over 3 hours to get our entire meal. Understandably, we weren't a small table of four so it will take longer, but it shouldn't have taken that long. Since we were there for a significant amount of time, we were able to observe what other's were eating/doing while we were waiting. Nearly everyone had enough leftover portions to take home and feed themselves at least once if not twice more. Good value as a customer, bad for a business who is trying to make money.\n\nAll in all, if you're looking for some good authentic Italian, I would recommend going elsewhere.", "business_id": "9mwShpTgZofOujt4JfyGmw", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-05-16", "type": "review"}

However, our chairs were rickety and appeared ready to collapse. \n\nThe restaurant was mostly empty (which was not a surprise as we got there after the prime lunch hour but before dinner).  And yet although there wasn't a lot of other customers there all vying for the attention of the servers, it took an unusually long time for our waitress to arrive at our table.

The three other people in my party all ordered the spaghetti with meatballs.   The food was...okay.  Nothing to write home about.  I've been eating Italian food for almost five decades.  And this is average - at best.  I'd say on par or slightly below Olive Garden.  It wasn't the worst food, but certainly not the best.  And again, I cannot overemphasize how below par the service was.   \n\nBut the thing which really upset me was when we got our check.  They charged us dinner prices for each of our meals.   Again, there is ONE menu, and the pack of the menu has the lunch section.  It reads (until 3:00 p.m.).   What I failed to see (because it's in fine print) is the part where they only offer lunch prices Monday through Friday.   Really?  REALLY?   Are you kidding me?   That's B.S., no matter how you view it.  At no time did either the hostess or the waitress bother to explain to us up front that the lunch pricing wasn't in effect.   \n\nI HATE being ripped off.

If this is how you act no wonder your restaurant has been dead every single other time we have been there.\n\nWhen we finally were sat, we were seated in a tiny table wedged in a room with a huge party that was three sets of parents and like, their 36 screaming children.  It was such a nightmare.\n\nTurns out they had the regular bartender waiting tables that night and he felt so bad about our wait and where we got seated he took one of the entrees off the bill.  So that was cool, but not enough to make up for his moron coworker.\n\nStrike 2 - If you go there for lunch and you order a hamburger, expect the waitress to give you attitude if you ask for cheese.  \"Yeah, if you didn't know this was an italian restaurant and we only have mozzerella.\"  Really?  I didn't know hamburgers were traditional Italian fare.  I wouldn't have been that upset but my hamburger--which was burnt, flavorless, and tasted like freezer burn along with my diet coke came to $14.00.  For a burger.  and a coke.  The prices here can be ridiculous.\n\nStrike 3-  Empty restaurant.  I mean, EMPTY.  My friend and i are there and we had bread wiith our meals.  Our thing of olive oil was empty, and there was a full thing of olive oil on the table next to ours.  NO ONE ELSE in the same dining room.  I took the olive oil off the table next to ours.  Our waitress came over and was like, \"Ma'am, this is not a free for all, you can't just take things from the tables if you need something you have to ask.\"  WTF!  There was no one there and it was just olive oil... and also had she been attentive, I wouldn't have needed to take the olive oil.  She would have brought us a full one.\n\nSo, I've tried this place 5 times and that was enough.  I dont know how it remains open but I suspect it will close soon.  Not worth the attitude of the staff.  They dont seem to appreciate the few customers they do have which is a shame, bc when I like a restaurant I recommend it and I bring my friends there.", "business_id": "SzHTdZR3yY1WBYUxkVxmUQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-05-11", "type": "review"}

Lidia's Pittsburgh is good.  Not spectacular, but really very good, and it's a welcome respite from the Olive Garden and the other Italian chains that seem to make up the Pgh area & the rest of the US.  Also, I give it kudos for its location in the Strip District.  Decor-wise, there is a comfortable and easy ambiance mixed with a slight artsiness that I liked.  Plus there were only friendly and helpful servers/hosts etc., which is always worth a lot, in my opinion.  While we were probably underdressed, there was zero attitude about it, and that's just not  not something I would encounter in NYC.   Again, the food was really good.  Not amazing, mind you, but very tasty.  I had the homemade pasta, which was brought tableside piping hot, in addition to the homemade salads and other fare at the buffet table.  A Bloody Mary, (or Champagne, if you prefer) is included in the brunch as well, making for a great deal!!  (I think the whole brunch was like $17 including drinks and dessert.)  The desserts were quite good as well.  This would be a great spot for a large party too.

I would give this a 4.5 if I could.  We started with the Prosciutto San Danielle and Asparagus and Boiled egg salad. The salad was the perfect foil to the salty prosciutto. Very nice.  We loved the bread basket with the the scoop of ground chickpeas in pesto.  We each had a salad.  My partner ordered the pasta tasting (more on this in a moment) which came with a Caesar Salad and my friend Carlos and I split the Roasted Beet salad.  For entree, I had the gnocchi with Duck ragu.  Wow.  Really fantastic.  Nice handmade gnocchi with a rich duck sauce that almost seemed like a confit.   Carlos had the grilled calamari with corona beans and escarole.  It was light and delicious in a heady broth that was spiked with Thyme.   My partner, Steven had the pasta tasting.  Kinda like Italian Rodizio, three housemade pastas of the day are served and by roving waiters with copper skillets.  They keep on serving you pasta for as long as you want to eat.  That night the pastas were a spinach and ricotta ravioli in a butter thyme sauce, pappardelle in a pulled pork sauce and Penne with eggplant.  Steven liked two out of the three.  He found the pulled pork sauce to be overwhelming.  The raviolis were a treat and when the servers brought Steven his first round, he energetically asked \"would you like to try one?\"  Of course I would!  that was indicative of all the service we encountered.  Very casual, friendly and efficient.  What more could you ask for?  Desserts were superlative.  I had the Cranberry Torta with homemade pistachio ice cream and Steven had the Panna Cotta with Marinated dry fruits.  Both were exemplary.  The decor is lovely.  All in all a great experience.  I do understand when others say that perhaps they expected a bit more, and perhaps I agree with them, considering that this is Lidia Bastianich's place, but if you dissassociate the name with the experience I think you will find that it's a great meal at a reasonable price and what's wrong with that?", "business_id": "XmdTkxKyJd7TuDLoiic1kg", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-04-22", "type": "review"}

Everything is bland. They have a salt problem. They must not have it in their kitchen. Everything needed it.\n\nThe salads were the only fairly good items we had. The arugula salad with pear walnuts and Gorgonzola was well dressed, but the beets were not cooked to their sweet level. \n\nThe lamb chops were awful. Lamb tasted like the grill and not at all like lamb.  I sent it back. They replaced it with pork tenderloin served on a tomato sauce (needed salt) and with cheese melted over the top with asparagus and a slice of Roma tomato. It was a sad sad dish. The tomato was hard as rock. The tenderloin was over cooked.  Just bad.\n\nI had the chicken piccata upon the recommendation of the server. It had lemon, capers and green olives. The vinegar fought with the lemon in the most vile way. The chicken had that flour coated slime feel in the mouth. Served on a bed of spinach. That was the only decent taste on the plate if it didn't have any of the sauce on it. \n\nBread is awful. They have a foccacia and skinny bread sticks that tasted stale to me. Served with an olive spread and a garlic white bean spread. They were fine on their own - in fact rather tasty.\n\nThe menu is really odd. Just in the way it is laid out and with the choices. Two west coast fish selections. Halibut and salmon.  Coming from the west coast, I just overlooked them by a matter of principle. \n\nBut the worse is the pasta trio. The concept is just so olive garden. All you can eat of three different pastas served table side. They cart a saut\u00e9 pan to your table. What is that all about? Our neighbors ordered it and I over heard them talking to their server about their disappointment.\n\nBut like all things Pittsburgh the people were so nice. They were gracious about the lamb and took it and the pork replacement off the bill. \n\nI just have to wonder why Lidia would create a menu like this.

We had a wonderful Italian meal, and one of the better dining experiences in Pittsburgh so far.\n\nWe had a reservation on Saturday night around 6 pm, and used their valet service ($5?  $6?  I forget).  We were seated right away, and we all admired the gorgeous dining room space.  It seems to have been built in an old warehouse - the ceiling is massively high, and there's gorgeous Mondrian-esque glass over the bar.  Very stylish!  \n\nI should also say right off the bat that our server was outstanding.  Friendly, funny, and knowledgeable, he was one of the best parts of the whole experience.  He helped us choose a wine which we all enjoyed, and he poured it skillfully.  He was also helpful to us at various points throughout the meal - for example, four of us began with the Insalata di Rucola (split two salads between four people, and they came on separate plates).  The salad sounded amazing, with arugula, pear, walnuts, and gorgonzola (get in mah belleh) but we all noticed that there was quite a lack of...well, pear.  We all had maybe one measly little wedge, and it definitely kept the salad from being as yummy as it should have been.  So we told our server about it, and he immediately brought out a plate full of pear slices.  Redeemed!  And the salad became delicious.\n\nMy entree was the Ravioli di Cinghale (ravioli filled with wild boar, in a rosemary sauce) and it was pretty delicious.  Three big raviolis, filled with succulent meat (think pulled pork, but Italian and well-spiced).  The sauce was very very light, but still flavorful.  My dad got the Pasta Trio, and it was hilariously awesome to watch three different guys come by with big bowls, delivering their delicious wares to his plate.  He had a lot of fun with that.  My mom loved her sea bass as well.  \n\nDad's pasta trio came with a dessert, so he got the Crostata di Pere, a sugary pear maple dessert which I think was good, but I don't have really strong memories of it so clearly it didn't bowl me over.\n\nAll in all, it was a very good meal with some truly excellent service.

This restaurant is pretty similar to Becco, except there is no \"theater crowd\" and the restaurant has a considerable amount of space.  The menus are pretty similar too, with the unlimited pasta specials being a mainstay here as well.  \n\nThe design of the restaurant is intriguing.  It has two levels, and a considerable amount of open air space which is punctuated with huge, intricate chandeliers and giant tableaux along the walls.  There is an industrial feel which helps the restaurant blend in fairly well with the Strip District; yet, at the same time, there is a sense of elegance down along the floor.  The balance was struck quite nicely, and it made for an interesting place to eat.  \n\nAs for dinner, I was disappointed that the 3-course prix-fixe was only available as an option for the entire table.  My girlfriend did not want to eat any pasta, so that option was simply not available to me.  I am not sure why they can't offer the special on an individual basis and charge a \"single supplement\" price if only one person orders it from a particular table, especially if we were both planning to eat 3 courses anyway.  I ended up ordering the same appetizer I would have ordered from the 3-course menu, a pasta dish for my second course, and forwent dessert for the same price.  It seems silly to be so pedantic about such things.  Oh well. \n\nFor the appetizer, I went with the Cozze ($12).  As an appetizer, it is only available in a white wine preparation, but on the prix-fixe menu they had a red wine (fra diavolo) preparation.  Since that menu was verboten to me, you guessed it, I received the white wine preparation.  The mussels were served in a very narrow, tall bowl.  The bowl was jammed tight with open black mussels, sitting upon a shallow pool of broth and crowned by two pieces of toast.  The mussels were clean, not a single one was cracked, and they were all open boasting sizable pieces of meat.  I had to eat about half of them though before I could get to the broth, and given the narrow opening of the bowl, I had to break the toast into pieces to sop up some of the broth at the end.  The broth was silky smooth and fairly flavorful.  I just wish it were more accessible.  The presentation was aesthetically pleasing, but not especially functional.\n\nFor the main course, I went with the Lasagna Bolognese ($16).  I was so pleased to see an authentic preparation!  There were flat sheets of freshly made spinach pasta which had the perfect texture for this dish.  The color of the sauce was correct too for a dish from Bologna.  The quality of the Grana Padano was pretty good as well.  The portion size was especially large making for a rather robust and tasty dish.  I was fairly pleased with this course, good all around.\n\nWine.  I had a glass of Nero d'Avola ($10).  The particular selection was decent.  I was surprised though that my wine glass was taken from the table and later appeared on the table with wine in it.  What was this?  Why was I not shown the bottle?  Why was I not given an option to taste it?  (It's an inexpensive wine; I can live with that one).  Why was it not poured in front of me?  And, why was it under-poured?  So, yeah, I was pretty much not inclined to have any more wine, given such off-putting service.  \n\nI passed on dessert and called it a night.  Overall, I think the quality of the dishes is high, and I generally enjoyed the ambiance.  They are missing all of the polished service that I would expect to see at any of the NY locations, though.  Also, I was annoyed with the structure of the menu.  \n\n\n3.75 stars", "business_id": "XmdTkxKyJd7TuDLoiic1kg", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-05-09", "type": "review"}

We found a spot in a paid parking lot across the street.  For $6 we were able to park about a quarter mile away.  I need the exercise anyway.  \n\nOur waitress was very helpful and attentive.  I was interested in trying Lidia's bolognese sauce.  Even though it was not on the menu, they served a small plate of spaghetti with bolognese sauce.  Big points for accommodating my request.  But the sauce was watery without much flavor.  I was impressed with the knife skills of whoever fine diced the carrots.  Just surprised/disappointed with the results.  There are probably as many different bolognese recipes as Italian cooks.  This may have been perfectly prepared but I was expecting more depth of flavor in a carefully built, slow simmered sauce.  \n\nAs others have mentioned, the bread service is great.  The scoops of basil  and olive flavored spread were a little bland.  When combined with the fresh bread with salt crystals on the crust, the result was really good. \n\nI had the white bean soup of the day.  It was a bit bland needing a little more salt.   Same opinion of the gnocchi with braised duck ragu.  The ragu sauce had much more flavor than the soup and was enjoyable but could have been better with a touch more salt.  \n\nAs a classically trained newbe cook, I try to eat the best of the best foods when I can.  It is easy to follow a recipe.  It is very hard to prepare a dish perfectly.  I was hoping for perfection.

Well, Lidia's, not Lidia the person. After a couple hit and miss visits with the various pasta trio tastings I had, I'd say I was back in Lidia's good graces with their massive brunch spread.\n\nI will give you ample warning, DO NOT EAT A SINGLE THING BEFORE YOU COME HERE FOR BRUNCH. For realsies. It's a crap ton of food! And the best part? It's a bargain! For $28 you get the brunch buffet, your choice of main course AND a mimosa or Bloody Mary. Isn't that a bloody good time? Why, yes, yes it is. You just have to roll me out afterwards!\n\nThe buffet is awesome, with tons of traditional anti pasta's, meat trays, soups and salads. I actually went two weeks in a row (I know... that's a lot!) and got to see that they actually change out the buffet items quite a bit. The first week I went I had a delicious bean salad and artichoke salad. The second week I came they had fried risotto balls, which I promptly had about a million of... and tasty mussels. \n\nFor your main course there's about 12 different options to choose from, including the pasta trio of the day! The first week I went with the Salmon over beans and potatoes. I asked for it rare, and rare it came out! It was very flavorful and I liked the charred pieces. I could have used a few more veggies underneath, but the salmon was so large (about 8oz I swear) that it just took over the entire plate! The second week I had stuffed cabbage and mash potatoes. Odd for a polish meal to be on the menu, but it was delicious. I'd have to say even better than the salmon. I loved stuffed cabbage and the mash potatoes were certainly home made and not instant (could you imagine the horror if they were instant?). \n\nWith all that food it's hard to believe I had room for dessert. But how could you NOT indulge when it's also on the buffet just staring at you waiting for it's chance to be eaten! The first week I took the traditional tiramisu, which was fantastic! I like tiramisu that's not too espresso tasting and this was perfection. Very light and tasty. The second week they had a lemon tiramisu and it was a little slice of lemon heaven. Even better than the regular. I shoved so much in my mouth I thought I was going to throw up. But it would have been all worth it, I swear!\n\nSo heed my warning, friends!

The pasta trio by itself is $18 but with the salad and dessert is $32 (an extra $14, so not such a great deal!).  $18 for pasta with no meat or seafood in it is already way overpriced and ought to come with a soup or salad anyway.\n\nSo I was expecting this to be an amazing Ceasar salad but it was the worst I've ever had at a nice restaurant.  Instead of romaine lettuce, most of the lettuce was iceberg!  And the dressing was too vinegary and did not taste very good.  And I had hoped being an Italian place they would offer anchovies on it, but that was not the case.  \n\nThe pasta trio was tasty and included a goat cheese ravioli with cream sauce, a fettucine with sundried tomatoes, and a penne with a pork ragu sauce.  All were good but I felt like they had been sitting out for awhile and didn't taste freshly cooked, and the texture of one of the pastas was slightly chewy.  It was fun to see them all come over with their bowls though and the guy with the parmesan was also right there ready to grate some fresh cheese for you.  \n\nFor the bread, instead of butter they had these interesting things made out of a couple different sorts of bean which tasted rather like a hummus so that was interesting though would have been nice if the bread was warm. \n\nI had the tiramisu for dessert which was good but nothing amazing.  \n\nThe atmosphere was really nice with some interesting artwork and chandeliers and the service was prompt and polite.

Their Antipasto table is always delicious with seasonal additions.  Today, among the regular fare, (like their marinated/seasoned olives) there were mussels, a broccoli salad and caramelized onions atop crunchy bread.  All Yummy !! \nMy Yellow tail special was cooked perfectly and delicious; I was really surprised at the large piece of tuna.  (posted pic) I did have reservations (recommended) so I was seated immediately and the service here is always stellar.  For $28.00 you can not get a better meal (and a drink)  You will be full by the time you leave, and the food is so creative and scrumptious.  The staff never rushes you out !!  Take your time, eat and eat more and enjoy !!  Just some FYI.  The $28. brunch is only on Sat & Sun. There is LOT parking right across the street, on Smallman St., with tons of spaces.  Today it was $6.00 for all day parking; I have never seen it above $10.00.

It is a casual place but \"upscale\" casual if that makes sense.  Children are never an issue for me if they are well behaved and entertained.  Speaking only of their \"brunch\" I would say OK for kids but the cuisine is not really geared towards a child.  If you bring a child under the age of 12 well, I think you may have to feed them from the dessert bar.

I noticed upstairs they had a conference room enclosed with glass walls - looks like it would be a nice place for a birthday party or small private engagement.\n\nThe food:\n\nBread - The complimentary bread basket had a mixture of parmesan bread sticks and a couple other bread variations.  It came with two bean type dips and olive oil.  The parmesan bread stick is so good!!! I would've hoarded it all if I weren't on a business trip.  Alas, I had to pretend to be civilized and eat only two.  The bread was good, nothing that stood out, but I love bread I'll eat it anyway.\n\nFish of the day - I ordered the fish of the day which was rainbow trout over farro.  It came with some sort of creamy sauce that brought everything together perfectly.  A lot of times, the grains that come with the dish are pretty simple, I felt the farro was seasoned to bring out the flavor and texture of it rather than masking it.  I ate every single bit, it was so good.\n\nDessert - Ordered the biscotti/cookie dessert which came with one scoop of vanilla ice cream with espresso poured over the top in affogato style.  It came with an assortment of cookies, none of which were too sweet.  It came with two of each of Anise and almond biscotti, peanut butter cookie with chopped peanuts, some sort of dark cocoa crispy biscotti type cookie, spice cookie - like ginger molasses, pistachio cookies, and chocolate crinkle cookies. All were pretty small and probably around 1.5\" in diameter.  It would be a good dessert to share, but I don't share and I don't share desserts of all things.

But I didn't stop there.  You're at Lidia's, you eat the tiramisu.  Creamy, sweet but not too sweet, and perfect with a cup of coffee.  That coffee was so good, I didn't even need cream and sugar.\n\nSlight downfalls: the waiter didn't know who was the birthday person (discreetly ask if you don't know, just don't plunk it down in front of someone) and the wait staff cleared away all serviceware before I was done.

My fiances mom is really into Lisia so we decided to check it out for dessert. \n\nUpon entrance we realized we were probably underdressed for the occasion, everyone seemed to be slightly more well dressed. We were seated for dessert with minimal wait time.\n\nSince we were already full from dinner we opted for dessert and coffee only.\nWe definitely weren't disappointed with the dessert. We ordered the tiramisu and the nutella custard, both of which was rich and delightful. To drink, I had a decaf cappuccino with the in house coffee bean they offered and my fiance had a double should of espresso which GIANT. It was practically a cup of really concentrated coffee. He was definitely awake after that! Anyways, we definitely enjoyed the taste of the beans, it had a unique toasty flavour. \n\nSo, the reason I'm bumping this place down to a 3.5 instead of a 4 was because the service was not the greatest. The server we had at our table was very nice, but after she realized we were only ordering dessert, we felt her attitude changed slightly as she became less attentive. And near the end of our meal she shoved us the bill prior to us asking. Of course that brought her tip down.\n\nLater as we walked out we noticed that there was a collection of Lidias books on sale with her \"autograph\" in the front covers. Since my fiance's mother loves Lidia, we decided to buy one for her. Wrong decision!\n\nLet's just say.... The process of getting this book took longer than our meal!

My wife and I go to the Strip District fairly often and whenever we pass Lidia's I always comment on how I haven't been there in a long time.  So whenever a three course tasting with a bottle of wine popped up on Groupon, I quickly purchased it and made the reservations for us.  The inside of Lidia's is a really nice looking place with the walls having nice shades of yellow, an exposed beams ceiling, a huge fireplace in one corner, some cutouts in the walls with bottles of wine from Italy and tables covered in white tablecloths.\n\nSince we had purchased the groupon our meals were pretty much predetermined for us.  We started off our meal with a caesar salad that had grana padano cheese on it.  Whenever it was delivered to our table I was impressed with the size of it as it took up a whole dinner plate.  While I enjoyed the salad immensely, I can imagine that someone who doesn't like as much dressing as myself would find the salad to be overdressed.  Our entrees ended up being the pasta trio which you are able to get refilled as many times as you want.  On this night the trio consisted of a spaghetti with tomato and herb sauce, an orecchiette with sausage and broccoli rabe and a gnocchi with sage butter sauce.  My favorite of the bunch had to have been the gnocchi as the gnocchi itself was light and fluffy and the sauce was seriously amazing.  The orecchiette was my second favorite and I enjoyed the addition of the sausage and broccoli rabe to it.  My least favorite of the bunch was the spaghetti which seemed a little boring compared to the rest.  I did really enjoy the al dente pasta from it though.  Our dessert was supposed to be the tiramisu but since I am unable to each chocolate I asked the server if it was possible to substitute in another dessert.  If it wasn't possible then my wife was going to be in luck as we would have just taken mine home.  Thankfully though they were able to substitute another dessert in and I ended up choosing the ice cream trio.  I can only remember the mascarpone and blood orange granita as the flavors that I had and its worth it to note that each ice cream came with a cute miniature cookie.  The blood orange granita was easily my favorite of the bunch as it was like eating italian ice with the flavor being slightly sour and also slightly sweet.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I will head back to Lidia's again in the future.  I was pleasantly surprised by how good Lidia's really was and I could see myself going back here again in the future just to have the pasta trio.", "business_id": "XmdTkxKyJd7TuDLoiic1kg", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-05-01", "type": "review"}

Walking in, they had 2 hostesses who were very pleasant.  The decor is modern.  Our server was really nice and attentive.  I think his name is Chando?  I appreciate it too when the server offers to box leftovers instead of customers having to ask for boxes.  I guess I feel like I'm not imposing when they offer to do it. \n\nAs we were seated, he filled our water glasses and talked to us about the groupon, which included a bottle of wine from the $32 list (which is possibly their cheapest wine selection).  The selection here is pretty extensive.  I really enjoyed the bread basket with the garbanzo and cannelini bean hummus.  I think that's what they were.  My husband got the soup of the day which he said was just ok.  Nothing special.  My caesar salad was also the norm but there was so much of it, which was a waste.  \n\nI like the pasta tasting trio, which our server said varies daily depending on the chef's selection.  We had the paparrdele w/ sausage and cabbage, gemelli with spinach and ricotta and ramp, pea, asparagus ravioli.  All tasted pretty good.  My fave among the three waa the pappardele and my hubby liked the ravioli.  I did notice our server called the gemelli a fusilli but they do look pretty similar, and I didn't really mind bc either way, the dish would prob taste the same.

The groupon (meal for 2) included a $32 bottle of wine; choice between salad or soup; an all you can eat pasta trio; and dessert (tiramisu).  The first time we went, I would have rated Lidias with one star.  The service was sub-par on a Friday night. We were seated at a table too close to a service station and my seat kept being bumped into.  The bottle of wine we ordered never arrived until after we were mostly finished with our salads.  As for the food, the Caesar salad was OK, but I was really disappointed by the pastas.  The goat cheese ravioli was bland, and the other 2 pastas lacked in flavor as well (rigatoni with an olive oil based sauce and pasta in a meat sauce, which lacked in meat).  The second trip was better, bumping Lidias up to 2.5 stars.  We went midweek (Wednesday), and the service improved, although we still received our bottle of wine after the salads.  The quality and taste of the pastas also improved.  The pasta was fresh and had much more flavor (spaghetti noodles with red peppers, mushroom ravioli, and rigatoni with sweet sausage and onion).  Both times we got the dessert to go.  Our waitress also boxed up the remainder of our all you can eat pasta for us to take home with us (which was nice).  If you have the groupon, I would recommend going on a week night when they aren't as busy for better service.  I would also call ahead to see what pastas they are serving that day.

I remember Johnny still worked behind the bar when I went there as a kid in the 70's and he remembered me when I went there with my parents and would always make me a Shirley Temple with extra cherries in it.  (Good customer service is important to kids too! LOL)  So know that you know my family history with the PB, I will tell you that we just recently went back there with my mother who is now 84 on a recent trip back to PA.  The food was still very good but maybe not quite as good as I remember.  Nothing was bad and to be fair, we only split the eggplant parm sandwich and the meatball sub between the table.  The meatball sub was good, but I think the meatballs could have had a bit more flavor.  We also ordered an order of potato balls which used to be the family favorite back in the day. They were still good, but MUCH less cheese in the middle than in the past.  Pleasure Bar - add some more cheese to the potato balls and they will be a standout favorite on your menu and you could be famous for them.  I'd also like to see them bring back a past favorite sandwich called the PB Special. It was nothing more than a hamburger with Italian sauce on it and mozzarella cheese but the combination was outstanding.  I remember ordering that many times as a kid.  I like that fact that the bread is still made fresh (you can tell when you eat it).    The Pleasure Bar is still worth checking out for sure.", "business_id": "-Nanlb7SYXObqQ6dZ49UOg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-04-04", "type": "review"}

Friend had the chicken noodle soup, which I had a taste of, and it was delicious. Ranch dressing is my default condiment, and theirs is to die for. I was dipping bread in ranch after I had finished my salad. Speaking of, the Italian bread was fresh and delicious. Even the butter was great, despite coming from those little containers with the peel off top. Then we had the potato balls. Come on, you can't go wrong with balls of fried potatoes and cheese. They were really good. I had chicken parm and couldn't believe the size of it. After bread, salad, and potato balls, I was only able to eat about 1/4 of it. While it was good, I thought that my friend's carbonara was better. That's what I'll be getting next time. \n\nI ordered stuffed shells with a meatball to take to my mom. She used to frequent Pleasure Bar in her younger days and said the food is as good as it was back then. I also got her a slice of chocolate cake, which she loved, although it's more of a dark chocolate. \n\nService was great, but to be fair, it wasn't busy at 6pm on a week day.

Their menu is large, but not outrageously expansive like a lot of other local Italian restaurants in the area. There's a nice selection of Italian favorites, plus you have the ability to create your own past dish (choose your pasta, type of sauce, and add-ons).\n\nI've been to Alexander's several times for lunch and always enjoyed it, so I decided to take my girlfriend there for dinner on a recent night. When we entered, we were warmly greeted by the staff and asked where we wanted to sit. We sat in the front of the house/bar area so I could keep an eye on the Pirates game. While there, I overheard an older lady complaining that her dish was less than stellar. The server and the manager agreed with her assessment and offered to make her anything else on the menu to make her happy. I've always been pleased by the pleasant, accommodating nature of the staff when I've visited Alexander's; it's truly a strong point of the restaurant.\n\nI ordered the pork osso bucco with garlic risotto, while my girlfriend went with chicken parmigiano. We opened with bruschetta toast. It was a nice start. The tomatoes were fresh, and the taste of balsamic vinegar gave it a little pop of flavor. I then had their wedding soup, which is always enjoyable. It's full of meat and has just the right level of saltiness to it. My girlfriend was pleased with her garden salad; in particular, she enjoyed the flavor and texture added by walnuts and cranberries.\n\nThe pork osso bucco I received was huge. Unfortunately, the flavor was not as big as the size of the dish. The pork was tender and properly cooked... the garlic risotto, not so much. It was just kind of bland. Together, the dish was fairly tasty, but not something that I would order again. My girlfriend was pleased with her massive serving of chicken parmigiano and pasta. It was good, but the breading was a little soggy because it was doused in sauce.\n\nSomewhere during the course of our dinner, the manager walked from table to table, and asked every group if they wanted a loaf of Italian bread. I suppose that they had a lot of extra bread and were giving it out since the night was winding down. I heartily accepted- their bread is delicious. Little things like this are why I love Alexander's.\n\nIf you're looking for some tasty Italian food served in a friendly, welcoming atmosphere, you can't go wrong with Alexander's.

The manager SCREAMED AT ME at the top of his lungs in an epic meltdown that lasted 10 minutes! \n\nOn Sat., April 12, 2014, I attended the 50th birthday party for my dear friend, David Flynn. I organized the party, but relied on Dave and his sister to provide me with the final head count. I made the reservation for 25 people.\n\nThe manager and I played phone tag for the two days before the event. I called back and left messages TWICE to confirm, but apparently he never got my messages. (This was part of his rant, his indignation at unreturned phone calls that actually HAD been returned!)\n\nThe dinner started at 7 PM. Most of our group arrived on time, but some of our group (including me) arrived between 8 PM-9 PM. I was working on a homemade birthday present for Dave, which took longer than expected. I called Dave, his sister and my friends (Reesa & Joel) to tell them I was running late. In hindsight, I should have also called the restaurant to let them know, and for that I am truly sorry. That still doesn't justify the manager SCREAMING AT ME FOR 10 MINUTES!\n\nAfter enjoying a delicious dinner, drinks and birthday cake, none of us had a clue that anything was wrong. If the decision to return to a restaurant were based SOLELY on the food and wait staff, I would definitely return to Alexander's. But sadly, when the manager has a nuclear meltdown and throws a 10-MINUTE SCREAMING TEMPER TANTRUM, it tends to sour one on returning to a restaurant.\n\nTowards the end of our dinner, some of us started to smell cigarette smoke, which we later realized was coming from the patio out front. (It was a warm night, and they had the front sliding-glass doors open.) In the midst of the smoke discussion, the manager approached our table and began an EPIC RANT, SCREAMING AT ME FOR 10 MINUTES!!!\n\nHe was angry that everyone in our group hadn't arrived at exactly 7 PM. The restaurant's kitchen is open till 10 PM on Sat. night, so I don't understand why this was a big deal. We ended up with 20 people total and 5 no-shows. I am always disappointed by no-shows, but I explained this possibility to the manager when I made the reservation. I STILL BROUGHT HIM 20 PAYING CUSTOMERS! \n\nBTW...the dining room was practically EMPTY, which is not what I would expect on a Saturday night in Pittsburgh. Maybe I'm not the first customer to be on the receiving end of the manager's meltdown.\n\nThe manager SCREAMED that he had called me twice, and I hadn't called him back! He ranted about this about a dozen times. I told him I HAD called him back - TWICE. It's not my fault if he didn't get my messages. \n\nHe SCREAMED that he had put an extra waitress and cook on staff because he expected 25 people. He SCREAMED that I had cost the restaurant $100! How much money do you think 20 people spent on appetizers, dinner and drinks? I find it hard to believe that they didn't make any money, or at least break even. \n\nI am sorry that there were 5 no-shows in our group, but I always thought Saturday night was the busiest night of the week for most restaurants. I didn't realize the restaurant would look like a deserted, old western ghost town with hardly any customers. On a Saturday night, I assumed they would have a full staff on duty with or without my reservation. I was wrong. I'm sorry. I'm not perfect.\n\nThe manager also YELLED at me and my friends for \"LOOKING COMFORTABLE\" in his restaurant!!! Since when is looking comfortable an OFFENSE??? I thought restaurants wanted you to feel comfortable, but apparently not at Alexander's.\n\nHe also SCREAMED that one of the waitresses only got a $1.00 tip! I found that hard to believe, but just in case he wasn't making it up, I tipped my waitress $35 on my $26 dinner check! I am a former waitress, and I would feel HORRIBLE if any waitress every got ripped off on my watch! Even if his story wasn't true, I figured she deserved an extra big tip just for having to WORK in such a horrible place where the manager YELLS at paying customers!!! If he treats the customers this way, I can only imagine how he treats the employees. \n\nTHE MANAGER'S RUDE BEHAVIOR HAS COST HIM MY BUSINESS AND MY FRIENDS' BUSINESS FOREVER!!! During his rant, he actually SCREAMED that he never wanted to see me in his restaurant ever again! I'm happy to grant him that wish. And so are my friends. \n\nThis is an example of the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I have ever witnessed in my entire life!!! I thought the manager was going to have a heart attack or a stroke the way he was SCREAMING FOR 10 MINUTES!\n\nSCREAMING at paying customers is completely unacceptable behavior, and I will NEVER eat at Alexander's ever again. It's really a shame because I loved their salmon with pesto sauce. But great food can't make up for a manager who throws a TEMPER TANTRUM and SCREAMS AT YOU.

The pasta seemed to be in an endless bowl.  I felt like I was eating forever and there was still two meals worth of pasta left in my take out container.  The build your own pasta is quite a value for the price (although it does not come with a soup or salad like the other entrees do).  \n\nWe were stuffed, but after seeing several desserts go by, I decided I wanted to order the Napoleon.  It was stuffed with strawberries and blueberries and the cream was delectable.  \n\nOverall a great dining experience.

If you don't know the pizza in an area, look for the dirtiest, rundown place you can find, and you'll find the best pizza in town. The thinking behind that is, if the place looks that bad but is still in busines, then there is a reason they're still in business. And in my experiences, it's almost always true.\n\nFiori's is a dive (in a good way)- the inside looks like it was put together in the '70's, and the staff isn't always the friendliest. Forget about parking- there are three spots on the side of the building and perilious street parking on the hill. The later in the evening you go, the busier the dining room. My suggestion is don't eat here- you're only asking for drama.\n\nBut then you get home with that steaming pie, and all the parking nonsense, questionable customer service, and wait in line vanishes as you're enveloped in cheesey, meaty goodness. The pizzas are big, there are a ton of toppings, and the sauce is sweet in a good way. My suggestion is try their white pizza, which I think rivals the ones I've had in New York. I get mine with ricotta cheese, mushrooms, and meatballs- I'm drooling just thinking about it. I also suggest you try their italian hoagie- big, lots of meat, good dressing, and toasted in a crunchy way- my favorite in Pittsburgh.", "business_id": "r8jeeS3k_diihMDSu9IjlA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-03-18", "type": "review"}

We arrived shortly after 7 PM to find this place absolutely packed.  That meant that there wasn't any good parking spots available and so we had to park halfway up Capital Ave which if you don't know is a very steep cobblestone road.  The good news for us upon entering is that we were able to snag a table which was great as it seemed like people were waiting for tables the whole time that we were there.  The inside of Fiori's is somewhat small and I think they have 4 booths and 3 tables for seating as well as a pinball machine in one of the corners.\n\nOn this night our party decided to be simple and we ordered two large cheese pizzas for our table.  After taking a seat we probably waited around 20 minutes or so before our pizzas were ready for us.  The pizza ended up being pretty good and I can see why people in the South Hills always rave about Fioris.  My favorite part of it ended up being the crust which I thought had a really good crisp and a somewhat sweet flavor to it.  The cheese was also really good and there was a ton of it. Last but not least was the sauce whose flavor seemed to get lost with the cheese and crust.  So overall it was a pretty good pizza with my only complaint being that I could not for the life of me get the cheese to stay on the pizza while I was eating it.  Every time I took a bite or tried to cut it all of the cheese seemed to come off the rest of the slice.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  I really enjoyed both the sweetness and crispiness of the crust and thought that there cheese was good as well.

Lebanon, I went to il Pizzaiolo years ago, but haven't been back in recent memory. I don't remember much about it before, and after my experience there last night, I will remember not to go there again.\n\nWe were celebrating my friend's birthday. We got there about 7:45 with a party of 5, and there were a few tables open. The only table that was large enough to accommodate us, a table for 8, was available in the back. The brunette hostess starts to take us back there, but then the blond hostess says \"we have a large party coming in and they're going to be eating and drinking for a while.\" She points to a small table for 4 and says \"You'll sit there.\" Confused because the restaurant allegedly doesn't take reservations, we offered to wait until one of the 6-person tables opens up. The blond hostess refused. \n\nParagraph in which I rant about the blond hostess: This girl can't be older than 17. The whole time she interacted with us, she was rude, dismissive, and acted like it was a bother for her to be doing her job. She gave us so much attitude, like she was doing us a favor by seating us at all. No wonder people always comment on how bad the service is at this place - if your first impression is with a condescending high schooler who needs an attitude adjustment, it would take a lot to negate that first impression. Also, someone needs to tell this girl that tights are not pants. If I wanted to see someone's a$$ while I ate, I'd go to a strip club. /end rant\n\nWe were seated at the tiny 4-person table, two people on one side of the table (who wants to eat with a corner of the table sticking into their chest, as the hostess arranged the seats?). The 8-person table sat vacant for the first hour we were in the restaurant, and we were almost done with our meal when the allegedly expected party came. Funny how they don't take reservations, yet they would not sit us at the only table available that would accommodate our party.\n\nOur server, Ryan, was great and attentive. I think he realized how pissed off we were at the hostess and put in some extra effort.\n\nAs for the food and drink, it was just fine. Severely overpriced, but fine. Piccolo Forno is much cheaper (and is BYOB) and has much better food. \n\nThere are so many options in downtown Mt. Lebanon that there's no reason to put up with bad service, attitude, and mediocre, overpriced food.

We went here while visiting Pittsburgh to celebrate a birthday.\n\nThe restaurant is small, seating is quite close together, and noise level is probably a little high to carry on a meaningful conversation without your table neighbor overhearing all the details.\n\nI think we may have been a bit under dressed. I would say \"snappy casual\" would have appropriate. We were not looking quite that snappy.\n\nAnyway, we ordered an antipasta platter with cured meat, cheese, olives, fava bean spread, and some roasted veggies. Pair that with an excellent bottle of red wine. It was amazing! Surely enough food there for both of us to eat for dinner but we wanted to try the pizza.\n\nUnfortunately, less than 10 min after our huge appetizer came out our server delivered the pizza to our tiny table where there wasn't any more room and we were clearly not ready for the next part of our meal. So, we let the pizza sit there.\n\nWhen we got ready to eat the pizza it was cold and the crust was rubbery. When our server returned we explained the trouble with the pizza and he promptly got us a fresh one. This was a very nice gesture and promptly rectified the fact he never should have delivered the first one when he did.\n\nThe crust on the second pizza was still rubbery.

Their Margherita pizza and Penne Alla Vodka are listed as my last meal for a reason!  Whenever I come here, I don't eat the whole day so I can enjoy my carb fest!\n\nAs reviewers have stated previously, the service is hit or miss at this establishment.  I have had days where the host/hostess has seated my party promptly and had the most efficient waitress/waiter during my stay.  Then there have been times where I've felt like a nuisance for my presence.  That said, the food is so divine that I really don't care, it's worth the chance!  As Kat M. stated in a previous review, the ingredients are all authentic and high quality and it is a stand out amongst many restaurants in the area.  The crust is chewy, with that  Neapolitan type char to the bread.  The Mozzarella is creamy and floats on top of the sauce in a gooey little pockets. The sauce, goodness the sauce, it's bright and delectably simple.  In fact, it makes my mouth water to think of it.  Their pasta choices are always on par as well.  I order the Penne Alla Vodka, no fail, every time.  I actually had to learn how to make my own because I had to cut corners on my budget at one time!   They always have nice drink selections, but I love that they serve the small Coca-Cola bottles with a glass of ice, it gives the experience that European touch!  It's affordable and delicious, definitely a no-brainer for a great, casual night out with friends.  I no longer live in the area and I still crave a weekend in the Pittsburgh area just so I can get a pie!  My friend from L.A. consistently gushes about her pizza and pasta that she had whilst she visited me almost four years ago!  \"Oh, what I wouldn't do for some Il Pizzaiolo!\"  I couldn't agree more.\n\nIt makes me want to check Kayak for some cheap tickets to PIT!", "business_id": "6-rJjW6ITl5o_FliiNgZRA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-04-22", "type": "review"}

We arrived at around 7 PM and were quoted for a 35 minute wait upon which the hostess suggested that we go to the wine bar in the back.  The wine bar is not exactly in the same building but is a few feet out of the back door of Il Pizzaiolo.  The wine bar was bursting at its seams for the first five minutes that we were there we could not move much past the door.  Eventually the crowd quieted down and I was able to see a beautiful bar, a fireplace with chairs, bookcases full of books on wine and Italy and some trendy paintings.  After about an hour wait we were finally seated in the main dining room.\n\nThe main dining dining room was nothing special in my opinion as there was nothing that I can remember that really stuck out.  Our waiter came to our table quickly and our group ordered the Arancini since we were hungry.  It came out six balls to the plate on a bed of marinara sauce and tasted pretty good.  For dinner I was having a hard time deciding on whether I should have a handmade pasta or the pizza and eventually decided to get both.  My pasta entree was the Paglia E Fieno which consisted of handmade tagliatelle with prosciutto in a cream sauce.  The tagliatelle was made with either spinach or eggs and the alternating green and beige color combined with the color of the meat gave a nice visual presentation to the backdrop of the cream sauce.  It also tasted wonderful and none was left on my plate whenever I was done.  My pizza was the Diavola since I like spicy things and consisted of spicy salami, chile pepper, basil and different cheese.  Once again the colors were nice and I absolutely loved the pizza, especially some of the pieces where I got what seemed to be larger than normal gobs of cheese.  My dining companions all also complimented their meals and we were more than happy with the service.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would definitely come back here in the future.

Made reservations for our Anniversary and showed up on time.  Early evening on a Friday night. We ordered the ravioli and a personal pizza.......it took 47 MINUTES for our food to come out !!!    I was counting. Because it was rediculous. The restaraunt was half empty, and we sat there for 47 minutes with a little bread and oil--wich they refilled twice because the food was taking so long.  AND NEVER refilled our empty water glasses.  I decided at 50 minutes we were leaving.  Lo and behold at 47 minutes it comes out. Bland and soggy as we've ever tasted.  Opposite of what we expected from such an \"upscale\" Italian dining experience.    They never apologized for the long wait for our food and pretended everything was normal and fine.  We scarfed it down in a hurry to leave and asked for the bill. The waitress put it on the table and then took almost 10 minutes more to return to charge it when we were obviously packed up and ready to go.  We just walked up to the register and had someone else nearby handle it for us.  My husband went to pull the car around while I finished up with the bill.\n\n  Look, I know these are first world problems, and truthfully, my husband and I always enjoy each others company so much that we hardly notice a long wait for our food... PLUS... we were there on a gift card....     But we were trying to make it to a show that night and ended up arriving late and all for a meal that kinda sucked.\n\nEven worse, when my husband and I got up to leave, a table of 2 next to us received their food---- they had only been seated 15 minutes earlier!!!!\n\nI never complain about waitstaff mostly because I used to be a waitress, but what pushed me so far as to get on yelp about it is what I witnessed on the way out the door.  While I was standing by the door waiting for them to charge our card, A very elderly woman whom I had noticed was standing there a long time, asked the hostess...\"how much longer for a table?\"  and the hostess said...\"About 20 more minutes\".  The elderly woman replied..\"Thats what you said 20 minutes ago, and I see 5 empty tables.\"  The hostess got very rude with her and retorted \"Ma'am, some people plan ahead and make reservations, and its impossible to tell you the exact amount of time you will need to wait because we dont know how much longer people will be staying. They might order dessert, or more drinks. You can go to another establishment.\"\n\nSeeing this old woman as I would my own grandmother, I stuck my neck out and spoke up to the hostess.   I said...\"Listen, I've noticed this woman standing here a very long time.  You don't have any chairs for people up here to sit in and wait, so shes just been standing here. If you told her the wait was going to be 20 minutes, you need to seat her after 20 minutes.  If you were'nt sure exactly how long the wait would be, you should have told her that in the first place instead of getting angry at her for going by what YOU SAID.  Also, it would'nt hurt to show a little more respect to your elders.\"  \n\nThe hostess looked at her friend and rolled her eyes sarcasticly as to say...\"who is this bi***?\"  hahahaha.  VERY RUDE. VERY.   WORST SERVICE IN YEARS. SORRY.   Dishonorable staff.  Unimpressive food.", "business_id": "6-rJjW6ITl5o_FliiNgZRA", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-03-10", "type": "review"}

I went with Turkish Engineer (TE) on a snowy weekend evening. We dined rather early, so there was no wait. Unfortunately throughout the meal, I noticed almost the same (if not more) problems with service and food. \n\nOur drink (two sodas) and appetizer orders were taken almost immediately (great!). But we were not given silverware or napkins and for some reason could not possibly distract our waitress to obtain any. We snagged some from a nearby empty table instead. My soup and TE's frittatine arrived a short time later. The wedding soup was delicious, with savory meatballs, spinach, and orzo. I did ask for some parmesan cheese to put in the soup, and our waitress shook exactly half a teaspoon over the bowl and quickly departed. Since when is parmesan cheese a limited commodity? The way the servers at Il Pizzaiolo protect the freshly grated parm, you'd think it was made of gold flakes. But I digress. The frittatine (fried pasta with bechamel sauce and cheese) was quite bland. After a few bites, we had it wrapped to add tomatoes and herbs at home. \n\nThen our pizzas arrived; I ordered the margherita doc (mozzarella, basil, and tomato sauce)  and TE chose the funghi (mushroom). My pizza, (despite it being short on the basil), was very tasty. TE was upset to find he was served not a pizza with mushrooms, but one with sausage instead. He asked if he had ordered correctly, and I said that he had. Even the patron next to us said that TE had indeed ordered the mushrooms. The waitress seemed a little unnerved but quickly had the kitchen make a new pizza. \n\nOverall, a disappointing dining experience. It took forever to get water and any other items we needed for our meal.  We tried to be patient, as we only saw two servers working. However, there were three hostesses at the bar chatting and seemingly doing nothing. The restaurant was by no means crowded (this was a Sunday). Moreover, what is the point of having three hostesses and two overworked servers? It doesn't make sense. \n\nI will speak up for the quality and freshness of the ingredients. Everything is freshly made, especially the pizzas. That is great.

They did send me a $15 gift card, which I thought was nice even though that a $15 gift card is the middle finger of gift cards, so I decided to try them once more.\n\nOK, so that was just a fluke, they gave me a gift card, time to put on my optimistic pants and try again.  So I took one of my long time friends out for lunch.\n\nWe walked in, and we were given the new option to sit in the \"Wine Bar\".  \n\nOOOooo, color me intrigued.  \n\nSo they took us outside, up some stairs, and into what I'm guessing was a middle aged Persian's studio apartment above a garage that they converted into a dining room.  We then waited for service for an inhuman amount of time before we were given waters.  I ordered a dry red wine, and my friend ordered a cocktail.  We waited, and eventually got those, and they were actually very nice.  \n\nWe ordered mussels again (cringe) and the meat and cheese plate.  First thing I knew was iffy was the meat and cheese plate.  They replaced the normal wooden board, and replaced it with a plate.  A white, boring, incredibly small plate.  On top of it all, it was more of a plate of lunch meat than a charcuterie!  Blah.  The mussels were good though, and my bowels remained intact, though we asked for bread when it was dropped, and had to ask for it a second time.  What a waste, the broth was actually good, but cold by the time we actually got our bread.\n\nSo I'm sorry Il Pizzaiolo, I really tried to like you, but until the quality returns, I won't be.\n\nTL;DR  Don't go here, there are a ton of cheaper, better Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh", "business_id": "6-rJjW6ITl5o_FliiNgZRA", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-04-04", "type": "review"}

On the one hand, they use very fresh ingredients, and they bring some obvious skill to the kitchen. The salads are excellent, and the toppings for the pizzas are of very good quality. These pies leave something to be desired, however, and I think it's that they're not cooking the tops of the pizzas enough. The bottom of the pies have the requisite dark char and uneven black spots that we've come to expect from a wood fired hearth oven, but the tops of the pies aren't cooked enough. I know at some places they lift the pies to the top heat source of the oven before pulling them out, and this gives them that final bubbly cheesy goodness that we all love. They don't do that here, and the pizzas lack a certain unctuous and gooey quality that I like. The dough is also a bit thick and not crispy enough. \n\nAs I mentioned, the salads are great. I especially like their Caesar, which has just the rich acid/oil balance, super fresh romaine, a bit of garlic, anchovies that aren't too fishy, and good quality cheese to top it off. I was unaware until my most recent visit that they have a patio and wine bar in the back. The patio is a courtyard, so no street traffic to bum you out on nice warm days, and the wine bar has table seating and a more adult, relaxed atmosphere than the seating in the front. It's also dark and cozy, so perfect for a cold winter night.

The wine list is short but excellently prepared, the chianti is always superb - sempre! \nFor those who complain about space clearly do not understand the dynamics of a small restaurant space that would rather have a few tightly packed tables then actually take tables away. Either people would complain about their not being enough tables or that there isn't enough room, Girasoles choose the latter. Dinners are too spoiled in Pittsburgh, they expect good food to be accompanied by enough space for a family of 8, not to mention they have a fear of being close to fellow dinners - though I have no idea why? \nI recommend going for lunch - particularly if you don't like crowds.

It was watery, but didn't water down the taste so it's forgivable.  My boyfriend had the ravioli (I forget what the filling was, but I don't think it was vegetarian).  The sauce with the ravioli -- a vodka-type sauce -- was tasty and great for dipping bread.\n\nDespite NOT ordering the cheapest items on the menu, we were still perceived as cheap college students (maybe we should've dressed up a little?).

I don't even know where to start...\n\nThe place is small.  They didn't lie to me when I made the reservation.  Of course we had to pick the busiest day and time, Saturday at 7pm.  The nice lady on the phone told me a reservation helps but we may still have to wait.  I did appreciate that tip from her.  \n\nSure enough, we showed up and it's PACKED!  The unfortunate thing is it was cold, so eating on their patio was not going to happen.  Therefor, people cram into what tiny space is allowed in the front.  But when I say tiny, I really mean no space at all.  An older man pretty much barked orders at us and demanded to know if we had a reservation.  Thank God we did, I was a little scared of him when he ran off muttering about no seating in you ain't got reservations.  \n\nSo the first table of the restaurant is thee worst, because people are standing on top of you jealously staring down at you and your food.  Of course we ended up with that table!  Thankfully, our server and anyone else helping out was extremely friendly and helpful and made us feel comfortable.  \n\nWe started with the mussels app.  It came in a light garlic sauce and was a good amount of mussels.  I'd say they were pretty tasty and I loved dipping the bread into the sauce.  The bread actually became my best companion that night... more on that later!\n\nI ordered the gnocchi with tomato sauce and mozz cheese.  I LOVE when Italian restaurants dump the sauce on and this was a winner.  I LOVE SAUCE!  I know some people aren't into that, so I'll warn you if you like light sauce, you WON'T be happy.  After having gnocchi at Il Pizzaiolo in South Hills earlier that week (I know, I'm on an Italian kick!) it didn't hold a candle to those light little pillows of pasta and potato.  The sauce though, delicious!  \n\nMuch to my husbands chagrin, I had a hard time keeping myself from grabbing his plate!  He had the spinach and ricotta ravioli, which I didn't have have a bite of... but the SAUCE.... oh my!  Orgasmic!  I love tomato cream sauce and this was amazing!  I kept dipping my bread into his sauce, with him increasingly getting annoyed.  Did I want to risk a fight for that delicious sauce... maybe!!  It was soooo good!  \n\nBut the real action took place as we were finishing up our meal.  I had noticed the older dude/owner walking around with a glass of red wine the whole time.  I thought that he was pretty rude, but kinda funny, in a typical Italian way.  Well, I start to sense a commotion beside me and realize the owner and a server are in a heated convo.  Then the older dude screams \"get outta here you F*%& A@#hole!\" and then shoves him!  Whoa!!  \n\nI was shocked a boss would do that to an employee.  Come to find out it's his son.  A woman, who I assume was also part of management (maybe even a family member!), came over to our table and apologized, joked this was normal Italian behavior and offered us free dessert.  I thought that was really nice of her and and appreciated.   \n\nI just feel bad because those kind of things take down a business.  The good was great, but witnessing that, you wonder how long you can work like that.  Hopefully the dude can retire to a nice Italian villa with lots of wine instead of screaming at his son in the middle of his restaurant!", "business_id": "xgK6AAhJ-cYBUCSaLzgTuw", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-04-15", "type": "review"}

My friend had taken photos for Pittsburgh Magazines Blog, and demanded I go and try it. Let me tell you, Italy has arrived in this place. The owner, was there during our time and they display outside seating, as well as indoors. Their indoor seating is I feel below street level with brick walls, and community art hanging on the wall. Which rumor has it, you can buy. \nAs recommended I made a reservation, and was seated immediately. Big up, right there not including the atmosphere, very rustic, very homey Italian to me. We were greeted by our server, and I ordered a water with one of their \"special, owner loves this drink\" my friend ordered another specialty drink. I noticed the prices and strayed away from the appetizers, so I could order my entree and dessert. When our bread arrived I noticed this neat little oil holder, it was shaped like a jug, with a grape mold that held the balsamic vinegar. I WANT that thing. I almost walked away with it, pocket pinched it, but here comes running; in my conscious, knowing that my awful deed would have split all over my purse, knowing my luck. Any-hoo, haven't met a place to go wrong with bread. My drink that I ordered wasn't my kind of drink, there were bitters involved, and my taste buds and bitters don't get along. I told the waitress, and she agreed and said not everybody likes the drink, I'll take it off your bill, and I ordered another, which was amazing. \nAs for their menu, they do have specials that coincide with the season. They have to make a bang for their buck, can I please recommend they print that seasonal menu on another kind of paper..other than computer paper?! I was a little bummed out about that. I ordered the cocoa fettuccine, with pistachios, leeks, cauliflower, and Gorgonzola. This is a late post, but I can still taste this pasta. HOUSE MADE pasta, you can't go wrong. This pasta was just amazing. absolutely amazing. My mouth is watering as I type, Now you know this is a good place, if I'm drooling. The love I have for this restaurant is intensified if you have tried their spinach and ricotta ravioli, in this creamy tomato sauce. That you could tell was authentic, or well their own recipe.

I had never heard anything about it before, but it was close to our office and had decent reviews, so we decided to check it out!\n\nUpon arriving, I realized that I had walked past this charming little place many times without noticing it! It is directly next to Eden, and is right off of Walnut. I LOVED the entire feel of this cozy little place. The sunflower door handles, the stone walls, charming art work and unique bronze colored tables all made me feel like I was stepping into a little corner restaurant in Italy! It is very tiny inside- I felt lucky to be visiting during a non-busy time of 11:30 am and not a Friday night at 7pm. \n\nOur server was friendly but did not give EXTRAordinary service. I felt as if she was a little rushed with us as she took our orders and did not speak entirely clear. My co-worker had to ask for clarification a couple times when it came to the question, \"Soup or salad?\" because she had asked it so quickly. My other co-worker also wasn't impressed when she reached over one of our plates in order to retrieve another plate. I, on the other hand, am pretty forgiving with minor mistakes and did not take offense to that at all. She was attentive to our table, refilled our waters when needed and cleared the table of our dirty plates as soon as we finished our salads/meals. \n\nI ordered the spinach and ricotta ravioli. We had the option of soup or salad with our lunch and I chose the salad. The salad wasn't very large, but consisted of spring greens, thin slices of red onions, pine nuts, chickpeas, one baby tomato, an olive and shredded carrots. I found the vinaigrette to be wonderful- light but packed with flavor. The pine nuts really added a much needed crunch to the salad as well. Our table was also served a small basket of bread. The bread was fresh and fluffy and very good, but nothing spectacular.\n\nThe spinach and ricotta ravioli was delicious! The ravioli were rather large and only came with 4 for the lunch portion. It was plenty though! raviolis were filled with spinach and ricotta and were cooked perfectly.The sauce was creamy and packed with delicious flavor. As many other yelpers mentioned, they were heavy on the sauce, which I LOVED. I really enjoyed dipping my bread in the sauce and eating forkfuls of it- very tasty!\n\nWas this the best Italian I ever had? No, but it was very good! I am already thinking of inviting my mom for lunch here sometime in the near future!", "business_id": "xgK6AAhJ-cYBUCSaLzgTuw", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-04-02", "type": "review"}

They tried to sit us at a too small booth that had a huge tear in the seat. NO. We finally got our seat at a table that was actually large enough for all of us...service was spotty. \n\non to the food. There is nothing spectacular about anything they serve. It tastes like chef boy rdee, or frozen dinners. Serving family style is nice, but it is akward to go with friends and do this. \n\nLast visit 4 of us went....3 of us were sick for several days after...2 ended up at emergency room for IV...1 went to doctor for phenegren.....we will not be back after that experience for sure!!!", "business_id": "SVKC_-gIQFkHElZ6bFsE6g", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-03-13", "type": "review"}

Not sure what drove me into this location tonight, as I have only heard of the GINORMOUS portion sizes, and we were in the mood for something very light, and did not want anything real heavy. I know, this is Italian and everything is heavy, but we decided to give them a try since the parking lot was not nearly as full as normal.  (That could be good, or that could be bad) Anyhooo...we felt like an adventure none the less.\n\nSince this was our true \"first visit\" we felt in order to take the tour....through the maze, into the kitchen, (hey look someone is actually eating in the kitchen) and onto the myriad of other rooms, finally locating our table in a room, with just one other \"festive\" couple.  Apparently a few servers had been cut, so there were a few questions as to who actually had our table.  One would think that was bad, however we did have at least three servers attend to our needs at the very beginning.\n\nOf course, by now, you know I drink water, and my better have always has sweet tea. The drinks were quickly presented and we placed our very huge order of just the Mozzarella Cheese.  We had the complimentary basket of bread, with Olive Oil / Balsamic Vinegar, to help soak up the very tasty Marinara Sauce left over from the Cheese Sticks.\n\nThe portion sizes were reasonable for the price, and as expected, it was enough to feed both of us, especially the 2 sections of bread.\n\nThis will be on the list for us to visit later on, we when are hungry.\n\nService was fast and friendly.\n\n NCFoodGuy", "business_id": "SVKC_-gIQFkHElZ6bFsE6g", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-05-26", "type": "review"}

I don't know if I can ever return to Buca. Firstly, I knew there was something wrong with the server when we arrived. She just seemed...off...or high. She was very awkward and kept flirting with my date. Not only that, but she completely ignored me as if I wasn't sitting right there. \n\nTo make matters worse...much worse, our yummy carbonara had a hair in it. A nice long blonde hair. I was done. I pulled it out and showed my date, he looked at it and told me to just get rid of it. Ok, I did, and I stopped eating. He kept eating lol, until...I found another hair!!!!!!!! Yuck!!!! There is nothing worse than someone else's hair in your food. The night was ruined for me, and we both stopped eating, I never speak up when I am unhappy about something. I am just naturally a friendly, non-confrontational girl, but I felt like I had to say something! No one should have to eat food with hair in it, and have to pay $19 for it. \n\nAlas, my date didn't want to make things more awkward since  out server seemed to be on the verge of an emotional breakdown. So, I kept quiet against my better judgement. She later returned with the check, which was wrong, and claimed that she would have to pay the difference out of her pocket if she tried to change it. Confused! Then she asked us to do the survey and give her 5 stars. Ha! I just started laughing, I was sure this entire night was a joke. \n\nShe literally said, as she knelt down to our table and clasped her hands as if in prayer (I couldn't make this up guys) I'm new here, could you please give me 5 stars, for the good of humanity, and for all those people without jobs in the world.) This was entertaining. Then, she proceeded to take my dates credit card and flirt with him some more! She touched his chest and asked if he had any brothers. Holy...cannoli... get me out of here!

This use to be a family favorite for many years.  After doing a little shopping at the mall we would stop here to eat and gather our thoughts.  So here we go let me first say we have visited this restaurant on multiple  occasions and this is the worst time in the history for us. We were greeted upon entering but waited 4 minutes before being asked if we were dining in our picking up and order.  Why are we waiting to seated when no other family or patrons are waiting. Now off to our table the place was empty no more that 8 table in use. Yet we were cramped at a table and not a booth.  Humm now I am taking notes as this is not the kind of service I remember. So now I am ready to leave but the family wants to stay cause they enjoy eating. We order chicken alfredo and baked ziti and of course the short people requested ol favorite mac n cheese. Well long story short the waitress was the best thing at this restaurant.  My children's food had to be returned as it was cold as ice in the middle. My chicken alfredo was soupy/liquid sauce (you gotta be kidding me) must be a practice run on my order.  My husband baked ziti was drowning in marainera sauce which is a no no for those of us that know real Italian food. So to avoid being a meanie I will end this review like this.  The waitress was pleasant so I tipped her service but after being billed 100+ for food we didn't bother to take with us.  We will not be returning for any reason I could have feed my family twice and McCalisters for the cost of this on the run dinner.

I looked online for restaurants that were still open and Olive Garden showed they were open \"today from 11:00am-11:00pm.\" So we pulled up to the door and it looked pretty deserted so I went inside to ask what time they closed. It was currently about 9:50pm. I walked in and asked one of the servers at the bar, \"What time do you close?\" She said, \"10:00 but you're more than welcome to come on in.\" I said, \"Oh, it says 11:00 online (I said this while showing her on my phone.)\" She said, \"Nope, we close at 10:00.\" I said ok as I was turning to walk out and she told me to wait while she grabbed the host so he could seat us. I said, \"No, it's ok, I feel bad for sitting this close to closing.\" She chuckled and said, \"Don't feel bad, if I were you, I wouldn't feel bad and I would go ahead and sit.\" I looked at her hesitantly and said, \"Ok.\" \n\nSo I waived to my friend to come inside and I told her what happened. She and I were both a little nervous about getting poor service. (We all know no server wants to have someone seated at their table right at closing.) When the host appeared, I asked him with a nervous laugh, \"Are we going to get bad service since it's so late?\" He said, \"No, absolutely not. You will get great service here no matter what.\" \n\nHe walked us to our table and told us our server would be right with us. She was at the table over dealing with customers who were not happy with their order. we sat down as the salad was delivered to the next table and as the waitress started putting cheese on the salad, the customer said, \"Oh, no we didn't want cheese.\" Exasperated, the waitress rolled her eyes, turned around and threw the cheese grater onto the serving tray and complained to the other server, \"I need another salad.\" So while our waitress went to retrieve a new salad, the other waitress came over to our table. Looking very disheveled and ready to go home, she said, \"What do y'all want to drink?\" We both just ordered water and knowing they were in a hurry to close, we were ready with our order when our waitress finally appeared. \n\nI placed my dinner order and I told her I knew I was going to want desert so I asked if I should go ahead and order that now. She said yes because she would have to check to see if they even had any of the food left, thankfully they did. \n\nThroughout the entire order, we got nothing but attitude. My lasagna fritta was cold and had maybe a spoon full of the pasta sauce. My friend's fettuccine alfredo had may two spoon fulls of alfredo sauce so she had to take some out of the cold alfredo boat I ordered for the bread sticks. While eating, our waitress was walking by and said, \"Oh, I need to go check on your cheesecake and see if we have any.\" She walked back into the kitchen and from where we were sitting we heard her yell, \"Do we got any cheesecake left?\" I guess they did because she came out and said she took it out to thaw. By the time it got to me, it was halfway thawed out and the more I ate and the further back I got into the slice, the more frozen it was. \n\nNeedless to say, we were not very pleased with the service nor the food. And I do understand it was late but if your own staff tells me it's not a big deal, not to feel bad and to go ahead and eat, I expect better service than that.", "business_id": "4WsTFTH8GgnyFHwrH9nHzA", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-04-30", "type": "review"}

The staff was very accommodating, they were able to put a table together for us on short notice. \n\nWhen we sat down, I was immediately hit by a gross smell. I asked my friend \"Do you smell that?

While we waited for the rest to arrive, we got breadsticks and were also told that dessert for the birthday would be a charge. Really? Come on now. The bread sticks were pretty underwhelming--there was no garlic or flavor really. Booo. \n\nOnce everyone arrived, we placed orders. I got the Bruschetta Salmon. When I asked the waiter how it was, he said he hadn't tried it in forever but that people say it's decent--I appreciated that honesty! They served salad shortly     My goodness this place was slow though. The food took forever. When it came out, it was pretty lousy. I found two bones in the salmon before I quit eating it. The risotto pasta thing under it was so heavy and the salmon was sort of hard and the toppings made no sense. It felt like two or three dishes in one. Others' food didn't come out, so the manager came out and apologized and comped several meals. He even went up to the birthday boy and told him he'd comp his dessert as well. Thumbs up. \n\nDessert was actually pretty good--I got the chocolate tuxedo mousse cake which was quite good and it seems everyone else enjoyed theirs as well.

I forgot that the two are no longer affiliated  (Darden sold Red Lobster last year), but I received the card this past Christmas and it still said it could be used at OG, so I planned to use it.  I ordered online and the site said my order would be ready at 7 and to pick it up at the hostess stand; neither were true.  I arrived at the restaurant at 7:00, waited 5 minutes at the hostess stand and then was directed to the bar area that a small \"To Go\" sign that was not at all separated from the bar patrons.  There were several couples in there who said they were doing a bar crawl from Red Lobster to OG to Applebee's to Hooter's.  Wow, only in Charlotte would you find a chain restaurant bar crawl.  One of the patrons tried paying with a Red Lobster gift card and it did not work.  That's when I realized mine would not work either, but I feel it should still be honored since it says it on the card.  \n\nAnyway, after waiting another 20 minutes for my order (almost a total of an hour and half since I ordered it) and listening to screaming children and crying babies, I realized  why I haven't dined at an OG in years (besides the ridiculously long wait times).  \n\nThe food was actually accurate.   The iceberg salads were huge.  It's OG though, so neither were anything spectacular.  It saved me from cooking and doing dishes though.\n\nAgain, there are just too many real Italian restaurants in the area without screaming babies and hour long waits that serve flavorful food at reasonable prices (Portofino's and Docle come to mind) to deal with Olive Garden.  I would go for a to go order IF I had a gift card, but that's about it.  I will never go to OG on my own accord.  If I were going to a corporate chain Italian restaurant, it would be Carabba's.

Now I rarely eat this out as it IS a very hard dish to cook WELL. Thankfully, the chef here knew what he was doing as the meat was \"fall off the bone\" tender and very flavorful with a rich red sauce and of course, lots of garlic! Yummy!\n\nMy wife ordered the Pasta Carbonara which is one of MY very favorites. Kind of hard to go wrong with anything that has bacon/pancetta in it! And this one was RICH with their creamy and flavorful parmesan cheese white sauce. Delish!\n\nWe had some sort of an Italian ice cream (NOT gelato!) for dessert, but this was very unique, with almonds in it and an unctuous caramel sauce drizzled over it. I cannot for the life of me remember the name but is was outrageously delicious!\n\nOnly \"complaint\" was that the Caprese salad for the appetizer was very, very tiny for the price. Also my Osso Bucco did NOT come with pasta....had to order that for $6 separately.\n\nWine selection is small but nicely picked. By the glass prices are typically around $9 for a good glass.

Check. \n\nI loved Luce! I stopped by for dinner last night and was thoroughly impressed with everything. I was greeted immediately upon entering the restaurant and was seated right away. I dined alone but certainly did not feel that I was alone. The staff came by to check on me every once in a while to make sure that I was happy and enjoying my meal. They did not ignore me or give less than ideal service because I was by myself either. My server, was knowledgeable about the menu and gave great suggestions and told me about the specials.  \n\nIt was really hard to make a decision because everything on the menu sounded so delicious that I wanted a little of everything. I opted for only the spinach pappadelle pasta with oxtail ragu. I was not disappointed one bit. This was the first time I had pappadelle pasta and enjoyed it immensely. The restaurant makes their pasta in house and you can definitely tell. It was cooked perfectly and the oxtail ragu was nice and tender and they do not skimp on the dish. I ordered the smaller plate because I wanted to save room for dessert. I'm glad I did because I was getting quite full by the time I got to my third to last bite of the main entree. \n\nFor dessert I chose the creme brulee infused with rosemary. The combination sounded really odd but I decided to go for it. I love trying new things. The manager stated that if I did not enjoy it that they would switch it out for me. I had no regrets whatsoever.  I loved how the creme was soft and smooth and there was a touch of rosemary lightly caressing your tongue. My server said that they only put the rosemary in for a few seconds to infuse the creme and take it out. (I'm going to steal this idea the next time I make creme brulee.) The creme was not to sweet because it was balanced with the crunchy torched sugar on top. The strawberries, raspberry and blueberry topped off a perfect dessert. I ordered coffee to go with my dessert to cleanse my palate. \n\nThis is a home run for Luce in my book.

I've always had great service there and really can't complain.  A fun, great place to go to eat. Very laid back, so if you're interested in a stuffy/trendy restaurant, this won't be it.

One busboy was nice enough to crumble bread on my jacket, then look down at my jacket as if its presence offended him.\n\nThe rolls...these are dinner rolls, coated in oil. They stiffened within minutes, which generally says they spent time in a microwave. \n\nThe oily rolls also came with a dish full of oil. A dish of oil is a decent gesture in most Italian restaurants, but this oil was spicy. And more spicy than I prefer. But if you are from that Italian village where they dip oily rolls in spicy oil, this is your place. \n\nThe highly recommended Warm Goat Cheese and Mascarpone Dip was pleasant tasting. Rich marinara surrounding creamy mascarpone, with bread of proper consistency. In fact, I wish they served a version of this bread as their dinner bread. The presentation could be better. Looked like a dying sunflower made of bread.\n\nFor the main course, I chose Pasta Primavera. While flavorful, and a big heaping plate, this was also heavy laden in oil. A deep pool of oil.\n\nMy benefactor ordered angel hair pasta with tomato basil sauce plus shrimp.

Why there are so many bad reviews is confusing to me. This is an old fashion Italian dive. The decor is not a \"carnival\" as someone put it. It's a typical old fashioned Italian restaurant. I'm guessing all the bad reviews are because people spoiled from the likes of fancy Italian fusion restaurants like Bravo etc had some silly expectations before they ever walked in the place. I've been to real Italian places in NY and this place is very much like them. Our meal was edible, not horrible like others have claimed. The cheese bread was AWESOME! Waiter was on the ball with refills. Their meatballs are the real deal, not just subpar ground beef rolled into a ball. Their main disappointment was that my mushrooms on my spaghetti with meat sauce were from a can and not cooked in with the sauce, but seeming heated on the side and tossed on top.

The walls are plastered with all kinds of nostalgia. One wall is covered in college flags. There is even a Nebraska one. Go Huskers! \n\nThe lunch specials are by far the best deal here. Basically, it's a menu of things covered in cheese. They are good sized portions. The meal comes with your choice of a cup of Minestrone soup or a side salad (heads up: it's just iceberg lettuce) and a drink (tea, water or coffee). Also, THEY HAVE THE GOOD ICE. \n\nI really like the chicken barcelona. Yes, it does sound like it would be a little healthier than the others. However, it seems like it's made with a lot of butter. This is one of those places where you just need to accept that you're going to consume some calories, unless you go the salad route. Cheesy garlic bread is a must.

I kinda forgot that until we headed there on a whim and right away i remembered, ohhhh yea, this place is soooo loud. I'm not talking a little loud, I'm talking scream to place an order or ask your wife sitting next to you what the waiter said. Yep, that loud. \nIt took us about 15 minutes to get seated was what they had advised. The waiter was good and provided really good service (Once we could hear each other). It took another 30-45 minutes to get our food and then another 10-15 to get bill and checked out. Almost 2 hours is way to long for a meal, especially when it's impossible to have any sort of conversation with the others in your party. \nSo I believe over the years i've tried TGIF's 3 times or so and I'm pretty sure this will be the last time.

The chicken was soggy, and tasteless. Our waiter, he was very attentive, but too attentive, coming back every 2-3 minutes asking if everything was ok.

And since the one on Independence was taken from me a while ago I always frequent the one on Harris.  So that's where I found my self last night, I got there right before it got really crowded so I thought.  Any who we got seated pretty fast being that it was pretty crowded, our waitress was nice.  We ordered I food pretty fast, so there should have been no reason for us to get it after we had been there almost an hour.  I do understand that it was busy and I do also understand that people order food at the same time being that it's a restaurant that tends to happen.  So when I asked our waitress what the hold up was that was her response every one ordered at the same time.  So any way, we finally got our apps and waited for our food, finally got the food by now I was ready to go irratated by the atmosphere and the fact we got our food pretty late.  The manager made his way to my table and apologized for the slowness and gave us dessert for free which I thought was nice.  Our waitress only refilled our drinks once which I thought was a no no.  But me being me amazingly I didn't complain I just let it be (amazing I know....lol)  So I got some food to go, I didn't look at just for some reason trust that it was correct.  Got home looked at it, and it was missing a key ingredient.  I ordered a grilled chicken balsamic glazed cobb salad, and well I was missing the chicken can you believe that?  So being that it's a good 20 minutes away from me I didn't make the trip back to complain I just called instead.  I talked to the same manager I'm sure that fixed the first problem and he said sorry and is supposed to send me a gift certificate.  Apparently this happens more often than not because he didn't find it strange at all.  Moral is and I know that I don't need to tell you this but always check your food.  I normally do but for some reason I just didn't last night.

Mac Grille seemed a nicer choice than others so we stopped by. We made sure to get there early to avoid the crowds.  The problem was that Mac Grille seems to schedule wait staff very thinly at the beginning of the evening. So our waitress was the hostess! She didn't know much past where to seat us but gave her all in the attempt until the overloaded waitress stopped by to take over.  Despite it, both the hostess and the waitress were very pleasant and professional throughout. Shame on Mac Grille for understaffing though.\n\nTo the food! Meh.\n\nMy wife had something called Carmela's Chicken. It was a nice looking bowl of rigatoni, chicken, mushrooms and other assorted goodies. She seemed to enjoy it but I found it to be fairly ordinary. As a guy who cooks professionally, I am always looking to be blown away with flavor or at the very least something that I didn't think to make at home. It could have used a little salt (especially in the pasta boiling water) to bring out the nice semolina taste in the noodles. The important thing is that she liked it and was happy.\n\nI got Mama's Combo. A plate with lasagna, chicken parm and a chicken and mushroom cannelloni. The cannelloni was pretty good the lasagna was the star of the plate but the chicken parm was a pure throw away. I was unaware of where on the chicken a round disc of breast meat comes from (probably right nest to the nugget!). If I was to bet my last dollar on something to regain my vast fortune I would place it on the fact that the chicken came straight out of a box, already breaded and cooked and flash heated and put on the angle hair. Very disappointed. Did really enjoy the lasagna bolognese, though.\n\nSo, who knows, maybe one day we go back, but honestly I don't think we will feel on our deathbeds that we missed out on anything special if we never stop by again. Shame.\n\nAlso, just FYI, they were out of 2 of the 4 tap beers walking into a Friday night! Who does that? May as well run out of parmesan cheese! Oh yeah speaking of parmesan cheese, I hate restaurants that have the server put the parm on your food in those grinders. Seems like if you like a lot of parm on your grub (like all of us) you are screwing it up for the other tables, so you allow them to leave too darned soon and you are left wanting more but felling a bit shy and embarrassed to ask them to come back and pile on some more.

The kids were hungry, and we weren't into the whole St. Patrick's Day mood. \n\nWe hadn't had Italian food in a while, so I navigated to this place via Yelp on the iPhone. It's in a professional building, underneath a dentist's office, adjacent to a bunch of strip malls on Gold Hill Road. \n\nWe found it odd that it was cold in the restaurant, on what was otherwise a very warm March 17.  The waitress offered to let us sit outside, and so we did. Never mind the bird poop on the wrought iron table... Or the fact that the patio hadn't been swept in a while. \n\nWe were promptly served the highlight of the meal, a basket of probably the best garlic knots I've ever tasted, complete with herbed butter. My boys demanded we get a second basket with our meal. \n\nI'm always suspicious of Italian restaurants that don't have some decent coffee available. When asked, the waitress didn't even know if they did. \"That's okay, I'll drink water...\" \n\nOddly, some folks behind us were served great-smelling coffee about 20 minutes later. I wasn't offered, so I resisted ordering it.\n\nMy universal complaint about most mom and pop Italian restaurants from NY to FLA to CA  is that they don't seem to do salads much justice, and they charge too much for them when they're ordered a' la carte. This place was no exception. \n\nWe found it interesting that the salad Twin B received as an accompaniment to his meal had a nice array of romaine and other lettuces on it, along with croutons, while my wife and I had to endure the non-nutritional value of iceberg and a sparse sampling of veggies. Twin A had ordered a special salad to go with his pizza. It came with great olives and just a few more veggies. \n\nI ordered a crab-stuffed sole, which came with broccoli and mashed potatoes. Twin A ordered a pizza. Twin B ordered a pasta dish with a heavy, herbed cream sauce and some tomatoes. My wife had grilled salmon and broccoli. \n\nThe first thing I noticed about my plate was that the fish and broccoli seemed to be drenched in butter. Now, I like a little butter now and then, but dammit, it's 2012, and most people now know that it's not a a healthy fat to coat a whole meal in. A big draw of Mediterranean food is its heart-healthy reliance on lean meats, fresh veggies, whole grains, and olive oil. So where did all that butter come from? I'm not used to Italian fish dishes or veggies being drenched in butter.\n\nAnyway, the sole was okay. The crab stuffing was greasy and bland, The broccoli had no flavor beyond the butter, and the mashed, skin-on red potatoes were very, very good. Oddly, they were served with little or no added butter! I just dipped them in the ooze from the rest of the food.\n\nTwin A loved his pizza, saying the cheese and olives were awesome, despite a limp, wet crust.\n\nTwin B did not like the heavy, herbed cream sauce that came on his penne. I tried it and found it to have an odd, chemical taste, and to be so heavily laden with fat that I could see why he was disappointed He could probably feel his arteries seizing up after just a few bites.\n\nMy wife said the Salmon was just okay. There was nothing special about it. Her broccoli did look like it had less butter on it than mine.\n\nThe damage was $69 and change with tip, no alcohol. Entrees are generally in the $13 to $18 range, with pastas not far behind. Pizzas are a little less.\n\nOverall, the experience was \"Meh\" for the salads and entrees, \"Yay!\" for the garlic knots, pizza, and mashed potatoes. We have definitely had better Italian food for less money in many other places. I'd probably take my son's advice and order the pizza if I were you.", "business_id": "LwSNsn2k6v_Nb2dbhP3qsQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-03-18", "type": "review"}

I politely argued with the girl telling her it doesn't give stipulations anywhere and that's false advertising (not even sure if that's legal?) and very poor customer service for which they would lose customers (like myself).

Food is still very good for the price but recently a waitress on Friday night informed us that the food will be a while because the owner is also the chef (and the only chef at that).  Amazingly, she told us they were well behind every Friday night which spells out the incompetence of the chef/owner in not hiring more staff.  That evening our meal at a family restaurant took 2 hours.  If you dine there Mon-Thurs it's a pretty decent, if unspectacular, experience but weekends are atrocious and apparently the owner is indifferent towards improving it.  \nThe Fort Mill and Tega Cay areas are clearly expanding and thus existing businesses should flourish but without a competent owner to relieve the chef/owner Demarco's is going to fall behind.  This would have been 4-5 stars 2 years ago but lack of staff makes dining here take the same time as it would a top-notch Charlotte restaurant and borderline unbearable for families or anyone who wants to enjoy the balance of their weekend. \nGet the take-out and bring it home, you'll save money via savings on high-markup alcohol and have a far better experience!!!", "business_id": "LwSNsn2k6v_Nb2dbhP3qsQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-03-22", "type": "review"}

You can fill up just on eating off the top of the pile of meat before even making it to the pita bread! \n\n3. Calzones - They have so many different ones to choose from but I would say the Fighting Illini, the Italiano, and the Steak Bomb top the list. Again, these things are massive so be prepared for leftovers! \n\n4. Baked Mostaccioli - Amazing pasta dish with a layer of melted cheese across the top! I would recommend getting it with meat sauce and some sausage or meatballs in there as well. \n\n5. Godfather Sandwich - Don't settle for the regular Italian Beef or you are just shorting yourself for no reason. With the Godfather you get a huge Italian beef with melted cheese on GARLIC bread. So good! \n\nThe only downside with this place is you have to be ready for a wait if you're going around dinner time or after the bars close because it gets packed.

Also very close to the new Urbana location of the Food Co-Op.\n\nThe space is smaller but the food is just as good as ever. The menu is simpler but most of the favorites are still on it and evidently a few older favorites have been brought back.   Harold, the owner, said he is still developing a new menu for the new place so it will be revised and expanded. He also said they will be open for breakfast on Saturday mornings when the Farmer's Market is running.  They will sell bread and pasta at the market. \n\nThere is still a full service bar.\n\nWe have eaten in the new location three times so far and like the fact that some of the decor has been carried over from the old location.  The place was either full or pretty full each time we went.  We did not have to wait for a table but we saw a few people wait 5-10 minutes. We were there once on a Wednesday night and Donnie Heitler was playing his keyboard just like he did at the old place. I could hear him better due to the smaller space.  I'd guess the new space seats about 75-80 people. \n\nThe Minestrone (MARCOSTRONE) soup is still good. So was the spaghetti carbonara.  I had never had that previously and found it was like a breakfast pasta dish - with bacon!!  We also had that night Mardis Gras Pasta which was also a winner. \n\nWe also had a pesto pasta dish which was good. \n\nThe wait staff have smaller (sq feet) areas to cover in this new location so I felt like they were in closer contact - a good thing in general in a restaurant.\n\n** This is the old Milo's location.

To mark the occasion, I decided that after work I would have a multi-course dinner at one of Champaign-Urbana's \"Italian\" restaurants.  Let me first preface my review with some background.  I was born and raised in Brooklyn, NY, in a traditional Italian-American household where food was a centerpiece of family life and the table was the \"sacra tavola\" or sacred table.  I dined in restaurants in Little Italy and Brooklyn where the wait staff was fresh \"off the boats\" and barely spoke English and the owners and chefs were all old school Italians who had menus often hand-written and dictated by what was fresh and available in the markets and there was a sense of tradition in the entire dining experience.  Their tables were often occupied by members of \"La Famiglia\" but we won't go there.  I have no such high expectations from the local \"Eye-talian\" businesses.  Anyway, I decided upon The Great Impostor , er, Impasta.  The d\u00e9cor bordered on tacky, with prints of Italian posters taped to the sides of the booths.  Tape?  Really?  Service was slow and perfunctory.  The meal started with bread, olive oil, and cheese for the dipping.  The oil seemed decent enough but the cheese was not Parmigiano Reggiano.  I ordered a glass of the house Chianti, which was drinkable.  For my appetizer, I chose the Sausage in Crust.  The sausage was unremarkable and under-seasoned and the crust was bone dry.  The small side of greens was nicely dressed but rather limp.  My main course was the Linguini Pescatore, described as clams, mussels and shrimp with spicy marinara and ripe olives served over homemade linguini.  The mussels were borderline, the shrimp decently done, and the clams of questionable origin.  The sauce had a nice spice to it but did not encourage the ritual \"fare la scarpetta\", which means to wipe your plate clean with a piece of bread.  The olives appeared to be sliced black olives from a can.  The linguine was cut so short that it defied twirling on the fork.  I indulged myself with dessert on this special holiday.  As expected, no Sfinge de San Giuseppe, a traditional pastry, on the menu, so I opted for the Tiramisu and a cup of espresso with a splash of Sambuca.   The latter was fine, the former was nothing special.  Perhaps this seems a harsh review.  Many people may like the \"Eye-talian\" food offered in C-U's restaurants, likely because that is what they are accustomed to.  I like some of the Mexican and Chinese food here but I'm sure that Mexicans and Chinese raised on the authentic cuisine may find it not up to their standards.  So it is with ethnic cuisine.  A lot just depends upon what you are used to.", "business_id": "oP8KsXHOUA_otHHI5JHScQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-03-19", "type": "review"}

They did have a decent cheesecake and the check came out with a couple yummy chocolate chip meringues, but overall I guess I was a little disappointed.\n\nIn consensus with what many others have said, service was very attentive, but I felt it was almost to the point of pretentiousness.

There was presentation to the entire experience, which is something I've found a little lacking since moving to Champaign.\nI wouldn't want to eat in the bar area on a Saturday night, and if the hostess hadn't been able to move us into the other room we would have had to leave.  My dad can't hear very well and his hearing is better than my lip reading.  The bar area is really nice and I'd love to eat there on a Tuesday, which I have.\nThe good:  The food.  Three people, three different dishes, and everybody liked theirs.  I had the halibut and mom had the rabbit, and if you're going in there soon, I'd recommend either, and even more I'd recommend the vichyssoise with crab and asparagus.  If you're hardline vegetarian (I eat fish) then you'll have problems with the menu, but I believe the waitress at least implied that the chef would make allowances/prepare something else?  Either way you should call ahead and see.  I have no complaints about oversalting like other reviewers, perhaps they listened?  The malbec we drank with dinner was a nice random choice.\nThe bad:  Our waitress was new.  At least I hope she was new.  The service was great but she wasn't as familiar with the menu or wine list as someone working at that caliber of restaurant should be.\nThe manhattans were terrible.  I suspect Bacaro of being yet another restaurant who thinks they should have their own special manhattan, with exotic bitters and cherry juice and... do you think you're going to save me from scurvy or something?  I want bourbon, bitters, and sweet vermouth, and go easy on everything but the bourbon.  This is no time for creativity.\nThe dessert menu is stupid.  Who follows octopus and rabbit with banana bread and ice cream?  Hire a dessert chef.\nI would totally recommend Bacaro if you need \"fancy dinner out.\" Sometimes I do.

We arrived on a Sunday afternoon after a visit to the Phoenix Art Museum.  We ordered a BLT salad off the lunch menu and a manicotti dish.  We also included a cup of the minestrone soup for a buck.  The salad was good and was accompanied by fresh, hot bread.  The minestrone soup was outstanding.  The salad and soup were brought out early, as we requested, and we had ample time to complete the salad before our entree arrived.  The manicotti was fine and a good enough portion size that we had to box some.   So far, a good dining experience.\n\nThen the bill arrives.  The salad was 8.50 and then entree was full price.  We questioned the bill, as the \"lunch menu\" said the salad would be 5.99 and the entree 1.50 off.  The server actually apologizes and says he'll have the manager correct the mistake.  Then he comes back and tells us \"Sorry, manager says lunch prices only apply Mon-Fri\".  Nowhere on the menu does it say lunch only applies Monday through Friday, and we were never told.  I didn't press the issue, paid the bill and off we go.  \n\nWhat could have been an overall pleasant experience ruined by what is essentially a sham.

It gives me that homey feeling like a mom and pop store instead of the chain restaurant that it is. I like how whatever entr\u00e9e you order from the menu; you can get a complete meal from it.  Each entr\u00e9e comes with a drink, bread, soup or salad, and their spumoni ice cream for dessert.  However, if you want \"Italian\" food, you're not going to get it here.  It's a very Americanized version of Italian food.  They do have all the classics: the pastas, lasagnas, etc.  I've been here several times and tried a few of their dishes.\n\nSpaghetti Vesuvius:  cute name to start off.  Spicy chicken sausage and meatballs with mushroom.  I didn't think it was that spicy, but it was extra salty.  It's a very flavorful dish, however the individual tastes are all mushed together.  The noodles are a bit tough for me; perhaps undercooked.  However some people like it a bit tough.  \n\nGourmet Jumbo Crab Ravioli:  There's not a lot of ravioli pieces in the dish.  The edges that were not covered in the pesto alfredo sauce was dry.  I did like that they used fresh crab meat in the ravioli.  The creamy sauce was not bad and it wasn't too overpowering in my mouth.  It was able to taste pesto sauce and still enjoy the texture of the crab.  \n\nBaked Lasagna:  This is the best of the 3 I've had.  It has 4 kinds of cheese, ground beef, and pork.  First of all they gave you a huge piece of lasagna. Then they topped it with mounds of marinara sauce.  You may have to remove some of the sauce if it's too much for you.  The noodles were cooked tender enough for my taste, but it was still able to hold its shape.  And the meat was blended well with all the flavors of the dish.  \n\nI do like the cute little serving they have of the spumoni ice cream.  It's a great blend of pistachio, chocolate and strawberry.  And it's just the right amount after a large meal.  Maybe one of these days I'll go back just to try their chocolate desserts.  \n\nIf you like an American spin on Italian food, then you would like this place.  It's a convenient place to eat after shopping at the mall and their quick service is great if you're crunched for time.

He recommended the crab ravioli.  It is in a green pesto sauce.  I would have posted a photo...except I ate it so fast it was all gone before I could take a picture.  My son's meat lover's spaghetti platter was \"good\" and met his needs.  I thought his meatballs were too salty and lacked a fresh garlic-herb burst of flavor that I think sets an outstanding meatball apart from the \"average\".  The Italian sausage was excellent.  The spaghetti was quite good.  My wife had a shrimp salad and it was well above average.  Service was good.  The atmosphere is eclectic and fun.  I am going back for the crab ravioli.

Getting the food was one of my responsibilities and I had considered deli trays and had also looked at a few other catering places on line. All I knew is that I'd sooner die than call Fazoli's (who has often catered this lunch before). So it struck me suddenly with about a week to go- Red Devil! It's Italian, so it fits the theme, and we have always had a good meal there when we've gone. \n\nI stopped in to see the GM, Doug, and he took my order, assuring me that the portions listed for the hotel pan sizes I was getting are generous- I was feeding teenagers, after all, so I had my concerns. I was relieved that they could easily and pleasantly take my order so late in the game. They dropped off the food at our location on time, hot and fresh, and they even brought the napkins, plates, and plastic-ware. \n\nThe food was a HUGE hit with everyone. The first pan to be emptied was the meat lasagna, followed by the chicken lasagna, and then the veggie penne pastas, one with chicken. The rolls were fantastic, and they even gave us plenty of real butter. Even the salads were by far a bigger hit with the kids than I had expected. And Doug was right- there was plenty of food and lots of people went back for seconds.\n\nBest of all, when I gave the receipt to the treasurer of the organization, she was shocked at how low the price was, since last year, Fazoli's had cost close to twice as much! There is absolutely no comparison between the two when it comes to quality.\n\nI would heartily recommend Red Devil for your catering needs- as well as for dinner. My colleagues and I have since fielded many requests from attendees and their parents for the name of the restaurant and we will continue to use them from now on whenever our convention is in the Phoenix area.

It was almost 5 years ago. I was having one of those typical really crappy IT industry days. The NOC was slammed with calls and of course all from the worst of the worst customer wise. My manager at the time says he has something to make the day better. Takes off for about 45 minutes. I didn't know what to expect... hookers? blow?... no.. its a huge pizza and a giant pile of wings.\n\nHoly crap these wings are AMAZING even with the steam effect you get when you take out wings. They are super crispy and sauce is the baseline hot/vinegary/buttery awesomeness by which  I measure other wings. Their ranch is absolutely amazing and they are not stingy with it. Enough left over to dip pizza in afterward for the ultimate in glutton. I always go for the hot but their other flavors are good. If  you want a real treat just ask them not to sauce the wings and get a few sides of dipping sauce. The teriyaki they coat their chicken in for their oriental salad makes a GREAT wing dip.\n\nThe pizza crust is super crunchy and has an amazing flavor, cheese is nice and greasy, and the toppings are good quality. The sauce is a little flat but I can look past it considering all the other pros.\n\nIf you are lucky enough to dine in the wings are even better and they will serve you these delicious pizza bread rolls. They tear like string cheese and are always fresh. Sometimes they come right out of the oven mmmmm.\n\nI have never once encountered a rude server.

Honestly, I always thought it was some sort of front for illegal activities or a place where kidnapped children were kept.  The outside isn't very appealing and the surrounding establishments in the strip mall are a little sketchy and unkempt looking.  So, by association, it wasn't on my list of places to check out anytime soon.\n\nI took a co-worker/witness with me (remember...strength in numbers) and headed to get a slice or two.  Inside was very different from the outside perception.  It is a huge space with a lot of dining tables and is very clean minus a few uncleared tables.  We each ordered two big slices - him sausage and me pepperoni, green pepper, and pineapple.  Yum!  It was cooked to order (although a tiny bit burnt) and nice and hot.  You won't find pizza that has sat under the lamps for hours on end.  There are a variety of condiments (red pepper flakes, parmesean, etc.) and they also have a few desserts.  I haven't ventured to the sub side yet - maybe next time.  What's even better?  My two custom pie slices rang in at just under $7.  Oh yeah!\n\nSo, I didn't witness any illegal activities or see any kidnapped children, but I did manage to have some good eats within my budget and walking distance from my work.

Even from down the road you can smell the aroma of garlic and freshly baked pizza and I lamented the fact that there was nothing on the menu that was within my diet. Fast forward 5 years and they now have a gluten free pizza menu as well as several appetizers available for those with Celiac of gluten sensitivity.\n\nFor starters, they offer a gluten free version of bruschetta as well as a spinach and artichoke dip that will nearly have you licking the plate. The spin-dip was by far my favorite, boasting just enough vegetables to make you think you're eating health food, but with a hearty helping of cheese to remind you that you're actually indulging. We also ordered up a batch of their gluten free honey BBQ wings and my 3 year old couldn't get enough of those, shrieking excitedly every time she licked the sweet sauce. Be sure to specify when you order wings that you need them prepared gluten free; they have a separate preparation process for gluten free wings to help reduce any possibility of cross contamination.\n\nLet's talk pizza: I've been eating a lot of it the last few years since more and more restaurants are now serving it. My main concern with many pizza places that sell gluten free is that they serve the crust, but don't know squat about proper preparation techniques. Jimmy, the General Manager at the Camelback and 3rd St. location, gave me a tour of the kitchen on my recent visit. He showed me their gluten free preparation area, the separate tray and utensil storage area, and their cooler to show me that they follow recommended techniques to reduce the risk of cross contamination. Additionally, they use separate ingredients, racks, plates, gloves, and utensils to do their best to serve the Celiac and gluten free community. All locations have been trained on safe handling methods by Lynn Rae Ries of Gluten Free Creations, who also supplies their gluten free products.\n\nWe ordered 2 pizzas, both were 10 inch \"personal\" pizzas, but you could easily split one with a friend if you started with an appetizer. All ingredients tasted very fresh and the crust had a great texture, which is one of the hardest things to get right in the gluten free world. I personally like a combo of black olives, salami, and spinach, which won't break the bank at around $15. My husband opted for a garlic chicken, peppers, and mushroom pizza, which was tasty as well. They will even deliver and offer catering of their gluten free items for the big game or an office party.\n\nThe atmosphere reminds me a lot of a pizza place in Boston my mom used to take me - the kind of place that you would go celebrate winning a soccer match with your team, go on a casual first date, or take the family out for Sunday lunch. After dark, the lights go down and the candles come out while their patio lights up with fairy lights.\n\nThe only thing I could suggest for Streets of New York is to add some gluten free offerings to the dessert menu (I'm a sucker for chocolate) and to add a gluten free beer or cider option to the drink menu. Overall, it was a great dining experience and I'm sure that my family will be back soon!\n\nCheck out my gluten free blog too: www.GlutenFreeAZ.com", "business_id": "JN2qXIuDXnV2d8WnSqd28A", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-03-18", "type": "review"}

I expected to bite into my sandwich and be wowed. While I really enjoyed the mozzarella and soppressata sandwiches we split and certainly found them both more enjoyable than many sandwiches I have had in the Phoenix area, I just don't think this place is deserving of the Salvation Army of fans that seems to be willing to fight a holy war for that mozzarella sandwich. \n\nIn my eyes, what makes Pane Bianco's sandwiches good (and still worthy of 3 stars) is the fact that they are simple. Unlike some yuppy establishments where Arcadia ladies \"lunch\" (think Wildflower, Acacia Cafe or Chelsea's Kitchen), Pane Bianco (and by the transitive property, Chris Bianco) clearly has the European sensibility of \"less is more.\" A sandwich doesn't need to be piled high with garlic aioli, carmelized onions, and herb goat cheese to be good. If the ingredients are high enough quality, the bread and a few fillings should be able to stand alone and make for a great sandwich. \n\nI guess that's where my problem with Pane Bianco comes in. The individual ingredients of the sandwiches just weren't that great. Certainly, the mozzarella is good but I have had better mozzarella from nice local grocery stores and of course, at countless Italian places. I also agree with Kristin S that the soppressata was overly salty, which obscured the flavor. Finally, I didn't think the bread was as delicious as I had pictured it would be many times before actually coming. It certainly tasted fresh but I thought it could have a bit more flavor complexity (as it was, it tasted very white-bread and didn't have the slightly sour kick that housmade bread often does. \n\nI've got to be honest that after trying Pane Bianco, I am convinced that I would be a bit disappointed if I waited in line to eat at PIzzeria Bianco. While I can definitely appreciate a simple but delicious Pizza Margherita in a world where buffalo chicken pizza is somehow an appealing dish, the individual pizza ingredients would have to be better than the ones at Pane Bianco for me to truly feel like the wait was worth it.", "business_id": "-AAig9FG0s8gYE4f8GfowQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-03-03", "type": "review"}

Yes, it is that good. mmmmmm... and their market sandwiches are to die for. especially the lamb. oh and the mortadella. oh and lets not forget the pork. it doesnt matter. just give me one. hehe. and hopefully you are early enough to also get some of their tasty and oh so creamy rice pudding. best Ive ever tasted\n\noh and while you wait for your sandwich, after you pay for it of course, go next door to Lux and get a tasty fresh squeezed lemonade. Yes, that will make anyones day better.\nI feel happier just thinking about that.

This tiny sandwich shop is like nothing I've experienced before in Phoenix. They specialize in a very limited menu of artisanal sandwiches, served on house-made bread, as well as a few salads. I've had all of the sandwiches and have narrowed the top two down to the soppressata and the tuna.  The soppressata is like an Italian sandwich on gourmet steroids. The roasted red peppers bring out the rich flavors of the Italian meats and provide the perfect acidic balance to the fattier density of the meats and cheese. A perfect foil to the soppressata, the tuna is light and delicate with a strong lemon flavor - this isn't you mom's canned tuna and Miracle Whip on white bread. The tuna, made with red onion, lemon and olives, is topped with wild arugula, which provides a bitter bite and counters the fishiness. My suggestion - go with a friend and order one of each. The sandwiches are large, and I love to order one tuna and one soppressata and split half-and-half. \n\nI've heard nothing but great reviews for the salads, too, but I confess that I'm never in the mood the healthy salad alternative when I can smell freshly baked bread and know that a fabulous Pane Bianco sandwich creation is in my immediate future.", "business_id": "-AAig9FG0s8gYE4f8GfowQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-04-20", "type": "review"}

This all comes on what I believe is ciabatta bread, but I'm not sure. I asked the lady behind the counter if I could sub out the olives for the roasted peppers. Her answer was simply \"No\".... In my mind my first thought was \"okay, maybe a place like this doesn't do substitutions\", which I understood. She told me that they won't put the peppers on the tuna because it wouldn't work with the sandwich. I was shocked... so I asked her nicely to please ask someone if they could do it. After waiting around for awhile, I went to pay for my meal. As my sandwich was being wrapped, she said yes they could do it, but for some large fee (I believe 2.50 or 3 dollars, remind you this is an 8 dollar sandwich). By this time I was pretty worn out of the whole experience of Pane Bianco that I just said no thanks and went to eat my sandwich. Thanks, but a little too late.\n\nGranted the sandwich was pretty good, and the tuna was very fresh. I just couldn't believe that someone would tell me that I couldn't get something on the menu put on my sandwich... for the reason that she didn't believe they went together. \n\nI spent much of my childhood in South Philadelphia living on homestyle Italian... and tuna and peppers definitely do go together...\n\nIn summary, I will try Pane Bianco again, and will most likely update my review based off of the service I receive.

I went to pizzeria bianco this past week and bar bianco, so when we headed out to try Lux this morning, I figured, why not wait around and try Pane Bianco too. So that's what the BF and I did. Right when the restaurant opened I went in intending to only order one sandwich for the BF and I to share, but once inside, I saw they had a special focaccia and decided to get that too so we could have a more broad idea of what the food is like at this place. Both the sandwich and focaccia had mozz, basil, and tomato. So I went up and ordered and the man taking the orders was less than super friendly, but I can understand that for a place trying to be fast that is also super busy. Then I stepped to the side to pay with some other guy, who was actually pretty nice. After that, you have to sit around and wait for your food.... this is kind of awkward because the space is very small and warm and there are products all around so no matter where I stood I felt like I was in someone's way. Finally, they called my name and I got a little paper bag with my food in it and went to sit outside. The BF and I started by splitting the sandwich. Ok, so the sandwich was alright, I liked how the ingredients tasted fresh and the bread was very good, but it really could use something to make it a little more interesting. If they were to drizzle a little bit of aged balsamic on the sandwich, it would be delicious and I would want to come back for it all the time. As is.... I thought it was a little boring and would be kind of easy to make at home, so why would I come here for it? So after we finished that, we moved on to the focaccia. \n\nNow this was a different story. The focaccia was really good. It's like a corner slice of a square pizza almost. It had the same ingredients as the sandwich, but somehow tasted way better. I guess it's the melted cheese, the type of bread, and the fact that there was clearly olive oil on it that helped it be so much more flavorful. This was close to as good as the pizza was that we got at pizzeria bianco the other day. So, that made me happy and it only cost $4.50, so that made me even happier. I would be much more likely to come here than to wait three hours for the other. \n\nSo why does this place get 3 stars and the other get 4? I thought the selection here was very limited, which is fine if it helps them put out more quality food, but man, there's not a lot of choice. Also, the service was much better at the pizzeria. Finally, the appetizers at the pizzeria were freakin amazing and nothing I got today was amazing. HOWEVER I would probably come here again before going back to the pizzeria due to wait time.\n\nPS I didn't get a sweet!

If you're one of his fans who don't mind waiting 4 hours for one of his amazing pies at Pizzeria Bianco, then you're in for a real treat. While they don't serve pizza, one of my all time favorites, Pane Bianco is now serving dinner and no serious wait either! In addition to ordering one of their famous sandwiches, you can expect an ever changing menu of rustic Italian inspired plates.\n\nIf you've been to Pane you know the drill, go in, order at the counter then either decide to take your score home, or eat there on one of the communal outdoor tables. No wine or beer is served at this time but there is talk of Pane expanding into the Lux Coffee space next door which will eventually offer inside seating and hopefully wine by the glass. If all of this goes down, Lux will simply move to the adjacent building also getting a larger space. For me Bianco's food just screams for a glassed of red wine.\n\nOrdering the Crespelle ($12) had me really excited due to the unique nature of the dish itself. Basically an Italian crepe made the garbanzo bean flour; it's filled with luscious ricotta cheese, hints of spinach then bathed in a slightly sweet tomato sauce. It was clear that after the first bite I was in love with this dish, I simply couldn't stop though glares from my dining companions made me to relinquish the plate. \n\nI can't sing enough praises for Biancos Housemade Mozzarella ($8), thick slabs of hand pulled cheese is paired with fresh tomatoes, a few leaves of basil, olive oil and a sprinkling of salt, that's it. The resulting texture and flavor is so toothsome and fresh that I've yet to have another as good. The salad comes with bread which I put to good use soaking up every drop of the salads milky elixir. \n\nServed on house made flat bread, the Soppressata with Aged Provolone ($8) which also comes topped with a healthy shave of Parmesan cheese and slices of roasted onion. The pungency from the provolone is a nice compliment to the pork-tastic slices of soppressata. \n\nBianco is dedicated to local purveyors and for good reason, they make some of the best Phoenix has to offer. Take the Sausage with beluga lentils and polenta ($10) for instance. The sausage comes from our very own Schreiner's Fine Sausages over on 7th Street and let me just say, this plump link had just the right amount of meaty well seasoned punch to compliment the hearty lentils and super moist polenta cake.\n\nIf you're more of a lighter eater, I'd suggest the highly flavorful Roasted Seasonal Vegetables ($5). On my last visit the pan was filled with long thick spears of asparagus, sweet potato, cabbage, radishes, broccolini and cloves of garlic. Grab a loaf of their chewy bread ($3) and you have yourself a vegetarian option even a meat eater like me would love.\n\nNow if they added pizza to the menu, my life would be complete.", "business_id": "-AAig9FG0s8gYE4f8GfowQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-04-24", "type": "review"}

When we arrived, I took a look at the Market Sandwich of the day and it looked delicious so I got that instead.  Today the market sandwich was roasted pork belly, balsamic onions and some escarole.  It was freaking awesome.  The pork was juicy and fatty, the onions were on point and the escarole gave it some crunch, all the while on their amazing bread.  It was a great sandwich and I would definitely get it again.  My wife got the sopressata sandwich and this time it was a little different.  Usually it has roasted red peppers, but for whatever reason today it had some sauteed/grilled onions.  Still tasty might I add, but the combo of roasted red peppers was better in my opinion.  My wife being the awesome person she is, gave me almost half her sandwich.  It was awesome and overall it was a great lunch.

I guess I should have figured that with every food critic/organization under the sun singing its praises that it might be a popular destination, but was still blown away when their hostess told me that my buddies and I were looking at a minimum 3 hour wait to get our hands on some of this famed pizza.\n\nBut wait!! They have a sister restaurant across town that serves EXACTLY the same pizza?  And we can essentially stroll in there with no problems?  Sign us up.  I'm also guessing this is reasonably new development because a lot of these reviews below me don't seem to even acknowledge the pizza's existence.  \n\nRight now they've got four options for pizza - the Marinara, Margherita, Rosa, and Biancoverde.  Our group of 7 tried all but the Marinara (no hard feelings, cheese-less pizza).  I was impressed with all three with the Biancoverde taking the crown as the best of the night.  One of the chefs there really took care to explain all of the fresh and locally-grown ingredients that they used, and you can tell that the entire staff really takes pride in the food they serve.\n\nWhy only four stars?  Fair or not, I'm afraid it just couldn't overcome the hype.  My buddy from New York INSISTED that he could find a handful of pizza places that could outdo this in NY (although talk about hype...).  If anyone has ever tried Pitfire Pizza in Los Angeles, Pane Bianco is like a better version of that...with a measure of distance there, to be sure.\n\nI'd still be sure to get off your butt and check it out if you've been struggling to come to grips with the zoo over at Pizzeria Bianco - I can't imagine this will remain a well-kept secret for long.", "business_id": "-AAig9FG0s8gYE4f8GfowQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-03-21", "type": "review"}

The bike rack out front, for the latest hipster's recently purchased 10-speed, is a nice addition to the patio seating however, the food served could have used about a $3.00-$4.00 discount in pricing.  \n\nI was with a group of eight people, of whom i am out to eat lunch with on weekdays and weekends and, all of us had never been to Pane Bianco.  I ordered the Tuna Sandwich, while others in our group ordered the Mozzarella Sandwich.  We all agreed that the the food was somewhat tasty however, it certainly didn't match the pricing or even the over-self-assured staff.  The decor inside seemed nice however, out of place in Phoenix, AZ, as it was resembling a Kansas-Linen look, with a hollow and ghost-like feeling of emptiness, no matter how many people were there.  \n\nI wouldn't recommend Pane Bianco to those who care about a good ratio of the quality and price of the food, unless you have a $10.00 and $5.00 bill burning out of your purse or pocket, and are equipped with an equally snobby attitude, a thick un-Phoenix-like beard or, can still fit into your size 2 skinny jeans and Jackie-O sunglasses.

(he passed. heheh)\n\non the board, there is a daily special. happy hour is 3-7pm daily -- $2 off beers.\n(the foccacia sandwiches are on the lunch menu)\n\ncomplimentary bread with EVOO. i felt that the bread here was slightly better than the one at pizzeria bianco. but really, it's the same bread.\n\nmeatballs (side order) - i had my eyes on the meatballs...staring at the photos on the computer screen, so i knew this was what we were having. 3 good sized meatballs made from GRASS FED BEEF with crushed tomato sauce that was divine and a basil leaf. LOVE LOVE!!! \n\nmarket salad - they change it up daily/monthly but they follow a flavor palate. this time, it was a lighly dressed citrus viniagrette on a bed of arugula, oranges, candied pecans, and goat cheese. just what we were looking for.\n\nwhen we were at pizzeria bianco, we were so full that we didn't get to try dessert.\n\nthis time, we ordered the vanilla rice pudding. when i was reading about it, other people said that it was enough for two.  well, it was a much more generous portion than i had imagined!!  it was topped with boysenberry jam and not too sweet.  perfect ending to our 'light' meal'.\n\nthere are currently two pizzeria biancos (we didn't go to the other location) and one pane bianco. plans are in the works to expand adding a pizzeria bianco in tucson for the future. \n\nFIRST STOP, Pizzeria Bianco.\nLAST STOP, Pane Bianco.\n\nHAPPY EATING!!! =D", "business_id": "-AAig9FG0s8gYE4f8GfowQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-04-14", "type": "review"}

So I suggested it for lunch today and off we went.  We were very pleased all around.  The ambiance is great- kind of rustic Italian chic with low and high tables, a bar, and a takeout area next door.  The service was fantastic.  It took maybe 3 minutes to get our food, although sandwiches and salads aren't too taxing to make, and it wasn't crowded.  Still, it was noted and much appreciated.  I got the Caprese salad.  I debated between that and the sandwich, but finally decided on the salad because it did come with bread (which I definitely wanted to try, it being PANE Bianco, but sometimes sandwiches are just too bready).  I spent 2 weeks a couple of years ago literally eating my way through Italy on Caprese salads, and this was as good as many and better than some.  The tomatoes were red ripe and tasty.  The mozzarella was fresh, and it had just the right amount of basil, olive oil, and salt and pepper.  Yum- thinking about it now makes me hungry all over again.  The bread was as expected, fresh and crusty.  I also got the pickled vegetables, which were good and interesting.  It was a plate of baby carrots, onions, cauliflower, and peas pickled in what seemed to be apple cider vinegar, so they were sweet and sour at the same time.  Sweet Pea got the Soppresata sandwich, which came with the chile Soppreseta today (which was great, as we are both notorious spicy hounds), and he really enjoyed it.  It also came with sort of a saucy cold bean salad, I think they were lima or fava beans, which he didn't like but I LOVED.  I ate all of his too.  They serve Mexican sodas but aren't too precious about it- always appreciated.  We will definitely be going back, and I will go by the takeout for a loaf of bread when I'm having a party.

In the end, I settled on three though its probably closer to 3.5 stars.  There's plenty to like about this spot, though I wouldn't say it has the wow factor.  Though in the interest of full disclosure you should know that Pizzeria Bianco doesn't have a wow factor for me either.  If you're a big Pizzeria Bianco fan, you'll probably love this place.  If you're sorta meh about Pizzeria Bianco as I am, you'll probably have some of the same gripes as I do about Pane.\n\nI've been to Pizzeria Bianco a number of times, but I've never tried Pane despite driving past it thousands of times over the years.  Finally on a Wednesday mid afternoon I made the journey here.  My timing was perfect as I arrived right in between the end of the lunch rush and prior to the dinner brigade.  However despite my good timing, finding a parking spot was still a chore as I had to park about two blocks away.  I couldn't even imagine how brutal parking would be when its busy (especially since Lux, another wildly popular establishment, is right next door).  I got a little confused walking inside as you've got two entrances.  The left door gets you into the restaurant while the right door gets you to the take out counter.  You guessed it, walked into the wrong door.  No matter, as I detoured straight to the bar area.\n\nThe aesthetics here are somewhat hard to describe, though the numerous Yelp photos of the interior pretty much paint an accurate picture.  A small place with a hipster vibe, though perhaps with a hint of elegance in the decor.  Not unlike the setup you'd find at Chris Bianco's other establishments, though I'd say this one is a little more laid back.  The bar area is pretty small, though they had a decent number of craft beers and wines to choose from.  They also feature a number of daily dish specials in addition to the regular menu they advertise (including a number of dessert options).\n\nFor starters I went with the Four Peaks Sunbru for my beverage of choice as it was on tap for the day.  For my main dish, it seemed like the Sopressata sandwich with provolone and red peppers is a huge hit based on Yelper reviews so I went with that.  The sandwich comes with what I suppose is a side salad, though its so small it could basically be a garnish.  First off, no complaints about the foccacia bread.  Cooked perfectly for the right amount of crunch while soft on the inside.  But the sandwich itself was a little disappointing to be honest.  The seasoning of the red peppers was such that it basically overpowered the texture of the meat and the cheese, to the point where the red pepper was pretty much all I could taste.  Perhaps swapping provolone for mozzarella would've mellowed out the red peppers just enough to balance it out.  The portion size was about right and the side salad (what little there was) was good so the dish wasn't a total disappointment.  For dessert, I asked for a piece of their tres leches cake, but they had just run out.  So instead I went with their flourless chocolate cake (which I've had before at Pizzeria Bianco).  Just as I expected, it was outstanding.  Super moist and decadent with a light vanilla creme sauce as an accompaniment.  Every bit as good as the one they serve at Pizzeria Bianco and a perfect cap on any meal.\n\nTotal cost for the beer, sandwich, cake, tax and tip came to about $28.  Pretty pricey (especially the sandwich), though to Chris Bianco's credit he and his staff do take great pains to source their ingredients locally which I appreciate.  Still, the markup seems a little steep.  Much like Sam Fox, Chris Bianco's strong brand identity probably drives the prices higher.  So like I said, if you think everything Chris Bianco touches turns to gold, you'll love this place.  And better still, they also serve Chris's famous pizzas at Pane as well.  I'd come back if asked by a friend or family member, but overall I feel like Chris Bianco's original pizzeria in Heritage Square is still a preferable experience to his CenPho concept.", "business_id": "-AAig9FG0s8gYE4f8GfowQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-04-01", "type": "review"}

Perhaps it's the overall indifference, and everyday-ness quality to this place that explains.   \n\nFOOD --- 3 stars\nSERVICE --- 3.5 stars\nATMOSPHERE --- 4 stars\nPARKING --- 1 star\n\nOregano's isn't bad nor terribly good --- but it falls in the middle as an average lunch or dinner option.  Portions here are big, but quanity does not equal quality.  I find it to be infinitely better than most other Italian chains (the BARFY Olive Garden, Macaroni Grill and Carrabba's), but not quite at the level of Maggiano's or Il Fornaio.  \n\nThe food here is OK, although there are a few standouts. \n* Alfredo the Dark pasta with the poblano peppers.  \n* Lady is a Scampi pasta\n* Pizza Cookie (or whatever it's called)\n* Italian Fried Potatoes\n\nBtw, that last item is their cutesy name for waffle fries.  Being the waffle fry whore that I am, I have to say these are quite good. \n\nThe baked sandwiches are OK --- the beefstro and stuffed turkey being one of my usual orders.  The pizza is OK as well.  Being a thin crust lover, I find the crust at Pizza Heaven and Pizzeria Bianco to have a better-tasting texture.  It's almost a little too thin (read: cheap) here.  Kind of like notebook paper.  How do I know?  Because I've tried it.  The salads here are big, so be warned.  Can't comment on the taste though because I haven't had them.\n\nThe 1950s swing/jazz motif, tomato sauce cans, and loud t-shirts can be charming in a campy kind of way. But what I like most about this location is how they preserved the \"Damen/Herren\" bathroom signs from when it used to be some kind of Bavarian wonderland.  \n\nAmong the cons here are the parking NIGHTMARE and sometimes hellish 1 hour-plus waits (on Mondays even!).  This place is ALWAYS packed.  I do not understand why there are only 15 parking spots here for a restaurant that easily seats over 100.  They must expect all their customers to carpool together in mini-vans.  But even so, they should know that NO ONE in Central Phoenix would be caught dead in a mini-van.\n\nThe parking shortage has caused nearby businesses to post bitchy signage warning Oregano's patrons not to park there - resulting in the traffic BOOBYTRAP that is 10th St.  Drivers must dodge slowly moving cars and waddling Oregano's customers weave in and out as the tiny parking lot leaks out onto 10th.  \n\nStaff here is always quick and freakishly friendly and cheery -- kind of like the drones at Jamba Juice and Cold Stone Creamery.  It's kind of cute, but borderline annoying that it seems trite.  But there are plenty of a-holes at other restaurants so I'm not complaining.\n\nSo there you have it.  Not exactly great, but I will be back soon.  Visit 4,763 is coming up next week.\n\nP.S.  For stalkers who care, Phoenix Fire Department DOES eat here often.

I recommend the Boom Dip, Meatball Sub, Bollo Pasta, and the glorious half-baked, warm, gooey cookie with ice cream on top (I don't think they can call it a \"pizzookie\" anymore, law suit or something).

My friend Carlos and I walked  up to the outside bar and no bartender to be found.. ok? No problem..inside we went. Okay so we approach the inside bar.

She cards us.. I show her my id and he shows his. She explains she needs to see and card the person he is buying the drink for. Okay that's a pain.. but fine. So what does she do. She leaves me at the bar while she goes with Carlos out to the crowded patio to card his wife.. really? How about you take care of me since I have met all the requirements? okay? so while she is gone..another bartender comes up and takes my order. As he is about to grab me a beer Janice Jett returns and says something to him he looks at me and I say the beer is for me Im on my own tab he turns back and he walks away?? WTF?

Half the table received theirs..and she made the rest of us wait as she doled out waters. Waters are great but we ordered beer..give us what we ordered!

The fresh onions on the Bruschetta really added quite a bit of flavor, I didn't find the addition of the marinara provided necessary.  \nThe Stuffed mushrooms were 2 large portabella mushrooms stuffed full of sausage marinara and melted cheese.  It took a little effort to cut them up and share, but they were quite good. In fact they would make a great  main dish to share with a salad. \n\nTwo in our party put in Lasagna orders for one of each variety at the same time as the app orders as it takes 30-45 min for Lasagna.  The rest of us took a while to decide on what we wanted.  The other 4 of us ordered the Aunt Margherita Pizza, 2 ordered the Alfredo The Dark and added broccoli and I ordered the Zainy Ziti and added sausage.  \n\nAll plates were extremely generous servings.  I personally made 3 meals out of my Ziti dish.  It was simple yet tasty and served in a baked thin crust bowl.  I sampled the Margherita pizza which I found to be lack luster.  The Alfredo dish was not as flavorful as I would have expected and was slightly rescued by the seasoning on the southwest bread that is served with the dish.  Had my dining companions not chosen to add the broccoli I would have considered this a little plain. It was not as creamy as expected (good and bad).  \n\nI can see myself taking a trip back here. I look forward to trying some other menu items.", "business_id": "ML1RJdeZ7bbfMrHvJ7m99A", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-04-27", "type": "review"}

That said the experience here was pretty awkward and uncomfortable. \n\nUpon arriving and not seeing a huge crowd, we were told that it would be an hour and fifteen minute wait. We said ok, we'd like to check the bar. She rudely told us that it was full and gave my fiance the stink eye when he left. I trusted her and waited for him to come back. While I was waiting I overheard a surly exchange between the hostess and customer. \n\n\"What's the difference between this bar and the one inside?\"\nAnswer: \"This one is outside and that one is inside\"\nSeeing the realization on her face that she was being rude, she \"politely\" added that the one outside had a different bartender too. \n\"What time do you close?\"\nAnswer: Basically a lot of complaining about customers coming in late which was code for \"I hate staying late\". Really not cool. Really bad for business. \n\nAnywho... seeing as my fiance wasn't back I guessed correctly that he scored us some bar seats. And there were two more down a ways. Full my ass. It was like she was trying to turn away business so she could leave early. It was only 8pm too!\n\nEnter bartender... or ID Nazi. My fiance is 33 and rarely, if ever carded. No biggie, but the guy was kind of abrupt and not friendly. He then had a really awkward interaction with a girl that worked there. He was reprimanding her but did it in a very rude way. Not what I want to see. \n\nIt took forever for us to put in our order and after we got our food and another employee came to sit down next to us we got the full brunt of bad juju at the restaurant. Apparently they've fired two managers recently and are going to clean house some more. \n\nSeriously. Keep your business inside your back room. I don't want to hear about it while I'm trying to relax.

We wanted to try everything since it was our first time there. We ordered the garlic cheese bread, hot wings, antipasto salad, italian wedding soup, bbq chicken pizza, and the margharita pizza! Everything we ordered was soooo good. The salad was so refreshing. The garlic cheese bread was delicious!  The pizza was cooked perfect.  We got the thin crust and it was so tasty.

Before I could stop myself I climbed on top of the table and drenched them with my ice water. \"Can I enjoy my dinner please? Either cool it, or get a room. I came to review the food, not your french kissing.\"\n\nI came back to reality just as appetizers arrived. I would never do that or say that to friends...or would I?  \n\nAnyway, just like Donald Trump, Oregano's does everything real BIG so we honestly didn't need to order all this food, but none of us counts calories. That's so 90's.\n\nHere are my thoughts:  Four stars for the overly friendly staff and thin crust pizza. \n\npizza\nNot a fan of pan pizza or stuffed pizza. Oregano's really does 'em up, but looks aren't everything. I choose thin crust every time. Yummy.  Simple. Easy to eat. The thicker pies turn into cheesy messes and turn me off.  I get reminded of strings of spittle when the cheese pulls apart. I realize how this can be a turn on for some \nfood whores, but not me.  \n \nbruschetta \nPlease tell me what the big deal is. Anyone? It's bread, with stuff on top - but it's not pizza. If that's your thing, fine, but why do you think you fancy, huh? Oregano's bruschetta just looked sloppy. Big and sloppy. It literally looked like a mound of tomatoes with cheese and basil and some bread sticking out.\n\nguaca-tony\nHow do you say delicious, d-lovely, D-lectable, d-vine? How do you say D-gorgeous? D-lite? Guacamole was seasoned with basil, garlic, onions, and tomatoes. It was good, but I wish folks would stop putting tomatoes in guac.  The flavor gets watered down. What helped kick up the mildness were the accompanied cheesy salty pizza pie crust dipping slices. Good combination.\n\nyam fries/sweet po's\nYum yum piggy! Comes with aioli and sweet seasoning sprinkled on - which I could totally do without. Leave the natural sweetest alone. \n\nsalad \nOn a good day, crispy romaine lettuce is usually a sign of a good salad. But my first bite of Oregano's salad left me with the taste of bag/packaging in my mouth. It wasn't overpowering enough to stop eating, but a disappointment is just that. I regretted not requesting spinach in place of romaine.\n\nBEGIN SIDE NOTE\nBest salad at Oregano's: the delicious spinach salad with red onions, marinated portobello shrooms, roasted red bell pepper, and avocado dressing. But that's just a memory now. This salad was removed from the menu. Whose dumb \nidea was that?\nEND SIDE NOTE\n\nVeggie Wedgie sandwich.  \nSkip it. The foccacia bread is way too thick to even enjoy the flavor of the eggplant, portobellos, spinach, and tomatoes. It's served with red pepper aioli and for some reason I had the idea in my brain this should be spicy. It was not and fell flat.\n\nscampi\nThe love birdies thought the scampi was delicious. I can only give their opinions because I won't eat pasta, or paste noodles as I call them. Lady is a Scampi is shrimp with corkscrew pasta in chipotle sauce, tomatoes, cilantro, cheese, and garlic. The spicier version called El Diablo Shrimp Pasta is in chipotle cream sauce with fettuccine, cheese, and pico de gallo.\n\npizza cookie\nThe only dessert they serve. It's warm and topped with ice cream, but way sweet and a little raw. If that's how you go down on your cookies, go 'head playa!

Lots of good, bad, and unusual circumstances.\n\nThe pros: Food was delicious! I ordered the chicken katsu curry with miso and salad. The chicken portions were very large, crisp, and moist. The curry sauce had some mustard in it which gave a kick of flavor, and the miso soup and salad were good compliments to the meal. Also the menu was almost too much to read over - Italian, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean were all offered as available dishes. Very impressive. (+4.5 star)\n\nThe cons: Getting the food took a long time to order. We had to ask the waiter several times how long it would take our food to get there, and one person in our group didn't have to pay for his meal because they look so long bringing out his yakitori. We'd all finished by the time he was served. Also it took a ridiculous time to get our change for food, almost waited half an hour for another friend to get his $11 change. (-3 star)\n\nFactoring out the bias: Our original group was approximately 25+ people, so much so that our smaller group had to be seated in a different room. I'm not sure how many cooks were working, but I'm sure serving 30+ hungry people put a hell of a strain on the serving and cooking staff. (+1 star)\n\nIn terms of settling the bill, there was a line of bills that were bring processed at only one cash register, so even getting money out took a long time. Also, many out-of-state credit cards from California were being rejected for simple charges, so ringing these up took a while only to have them not be processed. It wasn't the restaurant's fault - its an added security that many major credit card institutions provide so to protect from fraud. They require the card holder to contact the credit card company to confirm their identity; being a a restaurant wanting to leave after almost three hours wasn't the best place for this to happen. (+1 star)\n\nSo as long as you don't invade the restaurant with a starving army, I'm sure if you visit this place under normal conditions, the food and service will be fine.

With the works of Chagall adorning the walls right next to the iconic Japanese beckoning cat statue (aka Maneki Neko), the interior decor definitely alludes to the nature of the food served within its walls. Though firmly rooted in traditional Japanese cuisine, Cherryblossom also has select offerings from across Asia and Europe as well. I wouldn't exactly call it fusion cuisine... more like a meeting of traditions (with some exceptions, of course).\n\nAs it's name would suggest, Cherryblossom is first and foremost a noodle house. With a wide range of noodles dishes, Cherryblossom definitely does not disappoint in this category. From Japanese noodle soups to stir-fried noodles to Italian pasta, there are more than enough options to suit an array of different palettes. There's even a tofu noodle option for those trying to keep low carb or gluten-free. In addition to the many noodle dishes available, Cherryblossom also serves a wide range of other choices as well. Sushi, rice dishes, salads and assorted tempura are all on the menu to tempt your taste buds.\n\nOne of my usual go-to favorites is the Vege-Ten noodle soup. Served up in a large bowl, it's a hearty dish featuring either udon (thick wheat) or soba (thin buckwheat) noodles (I'll get either depending on my mood) in a miso soup with an assortment of vegetable tempura placed on top. Although this is usually filling enough for a complete meal unto itself (just because I'm still a big sushi lover even after going vegetarian), I'll also frequently get a vegetable roll (avocado, lettuce, cucumber, carrot, Inari tofu, and kaiware) to accompany my hearty bowl of tastiness... But no matter what you end up ordering, I doubt that you'll be going away unsatisfied.\n\nSo a small confession... While writing this, I totally got an urge to try one of Cherryblossom's desserts. And since I'm always so full from the meals that I get there, I've never had the opportunity to try one of the pretty desserts inside the glass case. So for just you (and my tummy), I swung out to get a piece of their green tea mousse cake (something that I had been admiring the last couple of times that I had been in)... Although you may think that this cake might be something akin to a typical European chocolate mousse cake, it's most definitely an Asian-style dessert. Light with delicate and subtle flavors, this cake features a thick layer of green tea mousse sandwiched between a thin base of white cake and a layer of red bean paste on top and is served with some fresh berries alongside. Like many Asian desserts, it's not what the typical American palette would consider sweet. It's actually very much like the kinds of cakes that I grew up eating from Chinatown in LA... Maybe not everybody's cup of tea, but I found it pretty good.\n\nSo long story short... If you find yourself hungry (or even just a little peckish) in the Central Phoenix area, I would highly suggest stopping into Cherryblossom Noodle Cafe. I don't think you'll be disappointed.", "business_id": "AkOruz5CrCxUmXe1p_WoRg", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-05-29", "type": "review"}

I ordered Miso Ramen and an addition of cha-shu (pork), and a side of Agedashi Tofu. \n1. The Miso ramen came with a slice of salmon.  Really? Salmon??? It was not the best combination to say the least. Miso?? There was hardly any miso in the soup. It was so diluted, I almost had to imagine the taste of miso. BTW, the cha-shu was like left-over and an after-thought added to the ramen. I am guessing the owner is trying to pull a fast one.  \n\n2. Agedashi Tofu. This is a freaking joke. An insult to the patron of the restaurant. Really!! How lazy can this restaurant get! Essentially a silken tofu deep fried with some dashi-based sauce. What did I get? A re-fried chinese firm tofu which was probably microwaved with a bunch of undercook or recooked vegetable tempura. The sauce? Dilluted straight from the bottle tempura sauce!\n\n3. Iced Green Tea. This one is not as bad as some other Asian fusion restaurant. They actually used a decent roasted green tea with a hint of roast barley.  Unfortunately, it is so very dilluted.

We were in love with this place.\n\nThe first time I brought him though, the waiter took our order, got our tea and coffee to us ten minutes later, then disappeared for 15 more minutes.

We thought it was a fluke and we were in no hurry, so we thought we'd try it again.\n\nSince then we frequented the place weekly/biweekly. There is only one server who promptly served us, made us feel wanted, and kept us coming back. He'd refill our drinks and was on the ball. Sadly, any other waiter/waitress at this place doesn't seem to care and will leave you with empty drinks and plates for long spans of time. They will disappear (in the back?) and not return or look at you when they finally emerge. We're pretty patient and forgiving too, hence our re-visitation so many times (2+ months, at least once a week).\n\nOur last visit the waiter didn't refill our glasses once for 25 minutes, then proceeded to sit at the sushi bar and eat dinner.

I'm long, long overdue to write something on Cherry Blossom, (and could have sworn I had at some point) perhaps my single favorite restaurant in the area.  In dozens of visits, determinedly working my way up and down the noodles from pan-Asian to Italian, I have never been disappointed with a meal at Cherry Blossom, with the exception of a single mackerel dish which I found not as tasty as other dishes and which also left me hungry - something never done before or since at CBNC.  \n   Last meal was Yakiniku, a \"Korean style thin sliced beef dish with vegetables served on an iron skillet.\"  Moderately spicy hot, delicious, and $11.  It's billed as a rice dish - if only the brown rice had come out before the end of the meal.  Friend Norm ordered an appetizer with his meal - which he reported was really good - if only it had come out before end of the meal - They were apologetic and didn't charge for the late arrival, but still . . . it's the kind of thing that happens frequently enough to keep me from giving that 5th star that the food itself has generally consistently deserved over the several years I've been enthusiastically dining there.\n\nOther great dishes: the thin sliced NY Steak with shitake mushroom sauce - tongue-burning sodium overload but the meat is a thing of beauty. Perhaps next time I'll try it with the sesame mustard sauce instead.  Don't think you like eel? Try theirs' - After a long ago year in China with a lot of rubbery eel and sea cukes that we referred to as \"bicycle handgrips\", I never thought I'd have a taste for eel (and I'm still not too confident about the sea cukes), but this is wonderfully prepared and absolutely delicious. Mark the Ika Yakisoba with calamari and vegetables on your list to try as well as the Korean Spicy beef and all the Asian noodle dishes. My housemate loves the Mixed Tempura dinner, though I find it a tad bland compared to my favorites.  Want something a little lighter but still filling, delicious, and out of the ordinary, try the Unagi salad with grilled freshwater eel and ginger dressing and most definitely the shrimp salad, a generous quantity of mixed greens with mango chutney  dressing on a large plate completely ringed by broiled (or fried?) shrimp with a mayonnaise dressing - It's a salad you'll want to remember to order again.  \nSkip to the Italian side of the noodle kingdom for a dozen (+1) delicious dishes ranging from the satisfying Marsala Chicken with Spinach Pasta in a rich, but not nauseatingly so, white cream sauce, to the Cajun Shrimp with Smoked Mozzarella, to a simple and also delicious Spaghetti Bolognese.  I can equally vouch for the Little Neck Clam in white wine  or marinara, among many other excellent offerings.  \n\nIt's a small restaurant, frequently with waiting line for seating on weekend evenings, but the wait has rarely been long - and it's well worth it.  Go when you have time to relax and perhaps be a little patient.  Your drink glass may be dry for a while before anyone notices, or has time to, and the service, always courteous, can otherwise be a little erratic, but the food is so worth it!.  Most entrees range from $9-12 and there's few among the extensive offerings above $14. \n\nNote that weekday lunchtime can be packed and hectic, and though the staff is literally running, it can take a while to get one's check and change.

She left with such haste while in the middle of our conversation we assumed she had pressing, urgent matters that demanded immediate attention. Nope, not the case at all! Extremely rude!\n2) QUESTIONABLE calculation of bill- CHECK YOUR TOTAL people (especially if you come for happy hour). They attempted to charge us for full price for some of the items. When pointed out incorrect calculation of total, the same lady gave us the BS excuse that since we opted for no avocado in our roll (due to food allergy), they charged us $1.50 more for IMITATION crab meat. They conveniently added this \"extra cost\" without informing us. Dishonesty at its finest, ladies and gentleman.\n3) Same lady gave us a $1.13 \"discount\" off the total bill begrudgingly. Um.. Really now.. It doesn't make any sense at all.\n\n\nFood- Definitely nothing to write home about. I've been here 5 times according to my Yelp check-ins in the last 4 years and definitely it hasn't been by my own accord but rather by friends' requests. My latest dining experience here was due to another restaurant that I wanted to dine in being closed, so we opted for this restaurant due to its proximity.\n\nAppetizers: \n- Panko shrimp: 3/5, nothing spectacular dipping sauce is Worcester-like sauce (weird)\n- Calamari: 2/5, definitely a boring choice as non-Asian restaurants can do a better job in my opinion\n- Karage chicken: 2/5, so boring as it lacks flavor and crunchiness\n- Agadeshi tofu: 1/5, not authentic at all and very bland (definitely a regretful choice)\n- Spicy gyoza hotpot: 2/5, tastes like \"Costco gyoza\" states my friend\n\n\nEntrees:\n- Hiyashi chuka: 2/5, not authentic tasting at all as my friend comments it literally tastes like ramen and sesame dressing you can buy at Asian grocery stores\n- Nabayeki udon: 2/5, broth is so unremarkable even instant udon has more flavor \n- Ramen: 2/5, broth definitely lacks complexity and depth and pork portion is pathetic\n- Rainbow roll: 2/5, questionable freshness and quality of the fish as the fish was lacking the vibrancy of colors and texture that would indicate freshness\n\n\nNote:\nThis is my first Yelp review ever. It's rather unfortunate it had to be a negative one. Yet poor service and mediocrity of food has prompted me to advise my fellow Yelpers to definitely reconsider dining at this restaurant. I feel that the quality of food and lack of taste makes this restaurant makes it a 2.5/5. However, due to poor service and dishonesty, I have given an overall rating of 1/5.\n \nOn another note:\nIf you want ramen, try Hana Japanese Eatery or Fujiya market (limited availability- check online for announcements).\n\nIf you want sushi rolls, try Sushi J, Sushi Catcher, Hiro Sushi, or Bei.\n\nIf you want nigiri sushi or sashimi, try Hiro Sushi.\n\nIf you want omakase, try Shinbay ($$$$).", "business_id": "AkOruz5CrCxUmXe1p_WoRg", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-03-12", "type": "review"}

Despite it is a noodle cafe they have decent sushi too. And if you are here for lunch their lunch box is really filling and offers a variety of meat, veggies and rice etc. So basically their food consistently satisfy me. However, their service is not on par with their food. Even when they are not very busy, it takes a longer time to get taken care of.

The restaurant itself had a bit of an odor to it near the front, but it was nice enough inside. Our table was next to a baby grand where someone was layin out some decent lounge. It provided an interesting atmosphere.\n\nThe food... they had a lot of specials and it was really too much to keep track of - I come to find out they are 8 - 15 bucks more than a regular menu item anyway, so I abandoned that idea. I ended up with Fettuccine Alfredo with Chicken. The bread they gave us was good. \n\nFor our first course, they brought out some potato soup for every one - including me, even though I said I wouldn't eat it... kinda wasteful when some of their dishes \"go to feed the homeless\" (whatever that means). \n\nThey brought out a salad as well - I ordered a Caesar which carried an up-charge from the standard house salad of 3.50. The Caesar was drowning in dressing and all the salads just seemed plopped on the plate after being slathered in heavy dressing. At these prices with courses and such, I kinda expect a little more attention to be paid to presentation. As I said though, we were a large group and they were very good about getting our food out in a timely fashion.\n\nOur entrees were also drowning in sauce. My Alfredo was tasty and the chicken was really good, but the noodles were a little chopped up and difficult to fork up and it was a little too rich and heavy for me. I still feel kinda greasy.\n\nI think this place would earn 4 stars if the prices were more reasonable. We paid 85 bucks between two of us and that included a bottle of wine for 24 bucks (their cheapest red - which I had before elsewhere and was actually very good). I think this is a good place, but I think it sees itself as being better than it is. In some ways, it lives up to these self-imposed expectations and in other ways it doesn't.

But Pizza Heaven gets 4 stars for other reasons.  It's cheap, tasty no-frills kind of pizza , with something for everyone.  \n\nThe pizza itself is thin crust with a nice crispy, yet doughy taste.  The ham, cheese (very good cheese, btw) and mushrooms I had on pizza tasted fresh and the toppings were generous.  \n\nSomething that sets it apart is the wide variety of toppings and the restaurant's perceived desire to offer something for everyone.  The menu includes more than 20 veggie toppings, lowfat cheese and soy cheese upon request - something you don't find much of at a pizza joint - much less the fancy pizza palaces of Phoenix!  \n\nThe decor inside is very simple - chairs and tables - no booths.  They had the basketball game on TV in the background, and even have a live band on Friday and Saturday night - not sure on the type of music.  Give them a call to find out.   They serve the normal selection of pizza, pasta, subs and salads and even have a limited offering of beer and wine for the tipplers out there...\n\nBTW: The location is new - having relocated up the road to bigger digs (now at 5150 N 7th St. betw.

I drive by this place every single day, thinking...hmmmm, I need to try this place. With it being on 7th St, the cars go by so fast, its hard for me to slow down my car to check it out. So, today I stopped on it. (Please note there is limited parking) So I walk in, pleasantly surprised to see a really nice establishment. Nice waiting area for To Go orders with 2 high top tables and a lunch counter. The menu is displayed really largely above the entrance to the dining room, so easy to read. They have take away menus to look at too. The guy at the counter was really pleasant as well. Now on to the food!\n\nThere was so much to choose from, including homemade lasagna, pizza, pasta, ravioli, sandwichs etc.  Very appealing menu options, I could hardly decide! Please note, they have gluten free and wheat options for crust and vegan and organic items too!! Great for ANYONE!\nI decided on the meal deal: 1 slice of pizza (1 topping), side salad, and 1 pop (or soda as AZ people say). All for $5.50 ($6.01 total) Great deal. So it only took around 5 mins and my order was ready. The pizza looked great! Not greasy and it had quality cheese and toppings and a good size slice! I got the mushroom as my topping (so good). The crust was crisp and delish. And the side salad was a nice healthy size as well. It has carrots, tomatoes, carrots, and cabbage slices on it. And the dressing, I chose was ranch. In fact, the dressing was that \"restaurant ranch\" that only true ranch dressing lovers will truely understand. :o) Great flavor  (not a glue-type quality like some places serve)\n\nOverall, great staff, nice setting, and good food!

There is really no waiter during lunch hours, and I'm not familiar with their dinner service, so I can't speak to this. You walk in, order at the counter, get your drinks, and find a table to sit. Once the food is ready, it is brought to your table along with plates & forks. \n\nThe wait time: Medium to Long. Depending on what you order, it can be on the long side. The longest we waited was 30 minutes to get 2 veggie and 2 meatball hot stuffed sandwiches, and 1 pizza (which we requested upon ordering to have it packed as 'to go'). If you are in a hurry or have a larger group, I suggest calling ahead and placing your order for eat-in.\n\nThe food: Dedicated Vegan Menu? Yes, please. Large portion Sizes? Absolutely. Tasty, flavorful comfort food? Right on target. This place was a hit with both my carnivore family members and co-workers, and my vegan preferences! Portion sizes are in fact very large, the hot stuffed sandwiches can easily feed 2 people, and if you order the calzone make sure you are going to share! \n\nVegan Menu: High ratings to the vegan veggieballs - they are flavorful and full of veggies! I was expecting them to have a consistency of seitan or soy, but that is not the case (as alluded to by the name...). Must try in their hot stuffed sandwich. \n\nCarnivore Menu: \"The Works\" pizza has an admirable # of toppings - these slices are packed with cheese, meat, and vegetables--definitely a winner. Also make sure to check out their Meatball Parmigiana hot stuffed sandwich - hefty portion of meat, sauce, and cheese - it's impressive.", "business_id": "auorqdHiATGZHVd-sd79ZQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-05-15", "type": "review"}

I was told it would be ready in 15 minutes, to which I thought was pretty fast.  As the gentleman who was taking my order was ready to hang up, I said \"Don't you need my name and number?\". He replied that it wasn't necessary. That should have clued me in.\n\nSo, I drive over to pick up my pizza.  I walk in and I'm greeted by a couple guys behind the counter.  I let them know I'm here to pick up my pizza that I ordered via phone and go on to describe it to them.  One guy tells the other what I ordered, conveniently ducks out as the other guy THEN begins to make it. REALLY?\n\nSo I stop him and tell him why did I order over the phone if they had no intention of making it until I got there?  He looks at me and all of a sudden can't seem to understand English and goes back to making the pizza.\n\nNice try JERKS.  I tell him to forget it as I will take my business elsewhere.\n\nApparently this is done because they do not trust the customer to show up and pay.

Not sure why papa didn't want junior to succeed, especially when his old man and brother own the two in Tucson. Seems you would want this to keep going with the family and be proud of a the legacy.  Anyway the Chandler store was closed without a word to the steady customer they knew by name and order. Then the same thing happened to the Scottsdale location. Showed up one Saturday and the place is empty and up for lease.\n \nSo, for food the rating would get all 5 stars from me, but the service leaves a bad taste in my mouth - pun intended. Still we come back every other week and search frantically for a quality Italian beef elsewhere.", "business_id": "Tk2dSL0TwQeI_zNJmb442A", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-05-07", "type": "review"}

Then, as I was seated in the dining room next door, listening to Sinatra's greatest hits, the food came and it was out of this world.  Easily one of the best meatball subs I've ever consumed - the bread had the perfect chew - and wasn't soggy from the delicious fresh marinara.\n\nThe salad had banana peppers, delicious olives, provolone, three different meats (salami, mortadella and pepperoni) and quite possibly the best Italian dressing to cover it in.

Oh yeah, the sicilian style pizza is awesome, but that one you have get made fresh to order. Way better that way. You can really taste the NYC water in the dough with that one! If you enjoy a good Greek Salad this place has one of the best. The dressing is so damn good.\n\nI have tried on occasion to stray from the pizza and have always been disappointed. NYPD is excellent for pizza, I suggest sticking with that when you go.", "business_id": "TqHTtjPANCBKGsjGBjDoQQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-05-21", "type": "review"}

We were at the Ulta just around the corner and she said she was hungry and she LOVES pizza.  We have been here twice as of this writing.  The second time around was \"Kids Eat Free\" night.  That is Wednesay for those of you with kids and it's a good deal.  I will eventually put together a list of Kids Eat Free places in the area.  For now let me tell you about NYPD.....\n\nThe pizza is a winner!  Nice crust, great topppings!  They use paper thin slices of sausage instead of hunks of sausage.  The flavore is great too.  My daughter had a slice of black olive pizza and they were very generous with the olives....she loved it!  I have had the ceaser and the house salads and both were good and fresh.  \n\nSo for the Kids Eat Free night adults need to order an entree (I think this includes a whole pizza too, not sure though) There were several things to choose from including cheese ravioli, baked ziti, and  lasagne.  I chose the lasagne and it was delish!  Piping hot with melted mozeralla over the top, I could not stop eating it!!  The flavors melded together nicely and it reminded me of my Mom's lasagne.  And did I mention the bread......OMG!!  The little ibites of heaven are sooooo good!!  I could have eaten ten of them!!  They are homemade, the real deal, yeasty goodness!!  Warm and just a little chewy, the flavor was amazing!!  \nOh and the Desert Flower Ice Tea.....so refreshing!!!  I keep thinking about it, that's how good it is!!\n\nTry the canollis.....you won't be disappointned.  Kids get an ice cream sundae with their meal.  On our first visit Lori, our server, was a real sweetheart.  She gave me some coupons and signed me up for the email list.  And on our next visit , Jessica was awesome and attentive too!\n\nThis is a small place but they also have an outdoor patio with misters.  The bar is tiny, probably seats 10.  Flat screen for watching the D'backs and some good beers on tap, along with Happy Hour specials makes this a great place!!  This will be somewhere we will frequent!!

That's how long my four-year-old son and I waited from the time we sat down until we received our lunch. Granted, my son is more patient than most children his age, but after about 20 minutes, he started to ask about where his food was. This occurred on Good Friday between 1:30 and 2:30 pm.\n\nI guess I should have been alerted to this situation from the moment I walked in. No one greeted us, and it took about three minutes before we were even acknowledged. We wanted to sit outside, but after 60 seconds of debating with a colleague, the gentleman told us there were no outside seats - although we clearly saw two empty tables. Then, the shirts on the employees said, \"Unique like a Brooklyn accent.\" I really should question a company that doesn't use proper grammar. (It should read, \"Unique, like a Brooklyn accent.\")\n\nThe person who seated us also took our order moments after we sat down. I asked for apple juice for my son and was told they were out, so we switched to iced tea for him and water with lemon for me. We shortly received our drinks - sans lemon. \n\nAfter we were there about 10 minutes, a large party of 10 was seated near us. Half were small children my son's age and they received lemons with their beverages, so my thought that the restaurant was perhaps out of those too was erased. Unfortunately, our waiter never checked on us, and I actually had to flag him down as my son was whining for food to get a water refill and ask - again - for a lemon. It was then that he told me he'd check on our food.\n\nFINALLY, 35 minutes in, our food arrived. I think we were so hungry at that point that dirt would have sufficed. My son doesn't usually like mac and cheese that is penne with cheese sauce, but he ate nearly all of it. My eggplant lasagna was certainly not the best I've had. Neither of our items was baked, so I'm still not sure what the holdup was. And, by the way, the table of 10 received their food before we did and came and left in the hour we were there. While I'm complaining, my son's ice cream was so frozen I almost needed a knife to cut it for him.\n\nI would like to say the poor service was because the restaurant was understaffed. Although the place was full, I counted seven employees, including a manager. Other tables were receiving much better service, so I'd have to say the problem was more with our server (who never shared his name). My son and I eat out about once a week, and I always leave 20% for a tip, but this time I left $1 on a $16 bill. At first, I felt badly about it, but then I remembered, \"Oh yeah, it's not like I'm ever coming back here.\"\n\n*** On 4/5/10, Alana, a representative from NYPD Pizza sent me an e-mail when she came across my review and offered her sincere apologies, a follow-up call from customer service, and a coupon for a free pizza / meal. I was very appreciative of the response, and as I told her, I've been to other NYPD Pizza locations with much better results; I think this episode was the result of a new or poorly trained server.", "business_id": "TqHTtjPANCBKGsjGBjDoQQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-04-02", "type": "review"}

And because I did, I didn't read \"the fine print\", which clearly stated what exactly you were entitled to.\nThe coupon: http://goo.gl/tuIS\n\nSo after we had placed our order, I looked at the coupon again, and noticed the listing of what was included in the entree selection. Feeling a case of caveat emptor, I searched out our server, and informed her of my mistake.\n\nHer response was fantastic; she said what we had ordered already (shells florentine) would be probably be ok, but she would verify.\nShe did indeed check, and they claimed that since neither I nor they caught until well after the order was placed (it was only about 5 or 10 mins...) they would go ahead and make the adjustment on my check.\n\nThat's customer service, beyond and above.

Also the service has always been impeccable whenever we've gone which is truly appreci8ed & a very integral part of the dining experience!\n\n   We luv the cannolis/kisses & we've had the tiramisu in the past which was AWESOME 2 (but not offered on menu anymore)? We have yet 2 try the limoncello cake but will save that in anticip8ion 4 our next visit. NYPD ROCKS & really hope they keep these Veg~head/Gluten~Free faves of ours so we can continue our business w/ this establishment!!!", "business_id": "TqHTtjPANCBKGsjGBjDoQQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-05-23", "type": "review"}

As a huge fan of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives, I could not pass this restaurant up, as I had never had a bad experience at a restaurant that Guy Fieri had recommended.  I went there with several friends (party of 6, including children).  \n\nMy friend and I started with the house salad, which consisted of mixed greens with a very heavy oil vinegrette on it.  The mixed greens were fresh and tasty, but there was so much oil left on my plate after eating the salad, that I used it with the Italian bread that was served to the table before the main course.\n\nAcross the table, we ordered the spaghetti, maccaroni and cheese, and the spaghetti neri (squid ink pasta with oysters, shrimp, and calamari).  I had the spaghetti neri.  I did not try the other dishes, but they looked and smelled delicious.  The spaghetti neri was fairly tastless in terms of the tomato+wine sauce, and was very bland and dissappointing.  The seafood (oysters in particular) were a bit \"fishy\", similar to sushi purchased in a groccery store (sometimes), but not so bad as to preclude eating.  However, the next day, I wish I had not, I had very bad case of food poisening (fever, vomiting) that night and the next day.  I called the restaurant the next day to let them know their seafood might be bad and the manager/owner (Rich) told me it couldn't possibly be their food.  Since my friend and I ate the same foods that day, except for the spaghetti neri, I am 100% sure it was that dish.\n\nI cannot recommend this restaurant.  I am terribly dissappointed at quality of the food, and the owner's attitude, which was brash and bit defensive.  In fact, he did not agree to remove the remaining seafood from the same batch, so that others may not get sick, as well, though he did offer to send a coupon for a free meal on my next trip.  I can only hope that others did not suffer the same fate as I.

Purchased a Local Dines coupon and went the other day for lunch. First impression was a little strange as there is no table service. You are pleasantly greeted by a nice hard working elderly lady who instructs you to order at the window and then take a seat while your food is prepared. Once the food is ready she beckons to you from across the room so that you can come pick up your food in the window. Not sure if this is just a lunch thing and if dinner service has a different system but once I understood how the system worked it was fine. As for the food... We ordered the famed bolognese ragu over linguine, chicken parm., and fettuccine alfredo. My wife had the bolognese and said it was just okay. The pasta overwhelmed the dish with very little bolognese mixed in so it was a little dry and flavorless, somewhat disappointing. The chicken parm. was actually pretty tasty in my opinion and worthy of ordering again. The fettuccine alfredo was not good at all. Very basic pasta with cream. There was no real taste at all and was a total disappointment. Overall I think that this place rides on the coattails of the triple D review from Guy Fieri. I do not understand the long lines and rave reviews to be honest. Oh, one last thing... As previously mentioned we used a Local Dines $15 for $30 worth of food coupon. When I got the bill at the end the nice older lady added up the food, deducted the coupon amount,then proceeded to add 18% gratuity to the bill based on the total amount without even asking. I have no issue with a tip, but presuming 18% when there is no real table service, just a woman beckoning to you from a window, well I thought that a bit much. Yes, she did come out from behind the window and was very nice, but it was not her position to add 18% tip to a four top table. At the end of the day this place is 35 minutes from my home and in no way justifying of the drive and a follow up visit. Sorry Giuseppe's on 28th, I wish I had found a true hole in the wall to call home, but to the contrary was disappointed with your food.", "business_id": "VpW40mznMS43CqdbelX2wA", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-05-03", "type": "review"}

I don't know the name of it but it had black noodles, shrimp, mussels, squid (I think) and not sure what else.  In fairness, I will go back again as there are several things on the menu I would like to try. I just don't understand the guest sign in log and would certainly not recommend the Veal Meatloaf.  We did briefly talk to the table next to us and they seemed pleased with the entrees they had.  I say go give it a try!", "business_id": "VpW40mznMS43CqdbelX2wA", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-03-24", "type": "review"}

Arizona. The food was fantastic! It is small, smaller than it seemed on t.v., the staff are very friendly and the ambiance is not high end but most were dressed business casual. I'd rather overdressed than under (imho).\n\nFor cocktails...I had the Limoncello Martini, not too sweet and very cold just perfect for me. My husband had a Chianti, which I also had with supper, though we like our reds slightly chilled it was great accompaniment to our meal.\n\nAppetizers - The Burrata: house made mozzarella (filled with mozzarella and cream!) on top of prosciutto, arugula with pesto and balsamic and the Suppli di Riso (risotto rice balls) served on house made tomato sauce . The Burrata was hands down the winner! In fact I told my husband it was one of the best appetizers I have ever had. My husband liked the Risotto rice balls a lot more than I did. I ate one he ate the other two...but the Burrata had to be shared to the last bite. Also had garlic bread which was really nicely done; slightly blackened just a bit crunchy on the outside and soft in the center. \n\nEntrees - When I go for Italian I like to order what I don't cook at home so I had the Lasagna (it's a lot of work for two). This was more cheesy than meaty but that's a good thing because it was creamy and soft (almost silky texture) and the tomato sauce had a slight savory tartness to it that pleased my palate. My husband had the Bolognese Ragu (between 5-7 meats) with house made tagliatelle...this is a seriously delicious meal! The tagliatelle is thick (good thing) and rustic but then paired with that Ragu, wow. It was full flavored, rich, savory, absolutely scrumptious.\n\nWe shared the Tiramisu which was very good. The texture is more fluffy (more creamy mascarpone) versus meatier (more lady fingers). My husband felt it could have been a bit more coffee flavored....but we ate the whole thing.\n\nThe portions were good for us. I could only eat 1/2 my Lasagna and my husband ate all his Ragu and said I should have taken his plate (and bread) away from him before he had finished!

We choose L'Amore partially for \"the Love\" we were celebrating.    Before we went my husband said he didn't want to use the coupon because he told me that coupons are never what they seem to be and owners don't give people with coupons the same courtesy.  He was right. \n  The food was wonderful!  Here is the problem.  We w ere the first guests in the dining room and with our reservations made the day before. We were seated at a table in an opening next to an area reserved for a company party that began with an hour of cocktails. Not very private or romantic. It was kind of like sitting next to the kitchen door in a restaurant.   As the private party progressed we could barely hear ourselves talk.  We mentioned this to our waitress, asked for a different table but was told the other tables were reserved \"for regulars.\" \nShe was nice, polite and apologetic.  \nBefore ordering, when we gave the waitress our coupon, she explained that the coupon was not valid for the specials and neither did the drinks count towards the $50.00 we must spend to use the coupon.  That made sense.  But we were ordering during happy hour and assumed we would be getting happy hour drink prices even though they would not count against the $50.00 minimum.  This was not the case. \n\nThe owner  was less than kind.   He was close to rude.  His attitude towards us using the coupon was insulting.  He never made any attempt throughout the evening to come to our table and see how we were doing, nor to apologize/offer to comp our drinks for the horrible noisy table experience.  We know the waitress mentioned it to him early in the evening.  His response was \"normally the party doesn't stand and talk so long.\"  So I guess by the owner it was the party patrons fault that we had a bad experience.  To illustrate our point on the noise,  after our appetizers, while we were having our main course, a table was seated near us, by the party as well.  After 10 minutes they got up and went into the bar to sit where there was live music that was quieter than the party.   I guess the owner is content with his regulars coming in and doesn't value new business potential.  We are disappointed in his attitude and recommend that he stop offering coupons because it doe not fit into his business plan and method of operation.  \nIn the end I guess you get what you pay for.  If we had paid full price my husband would have been more insistent on being treated like a patron dining in a fine restaurant, with his lovely wife, on what was supposed to be a romantic quiet evening.", "business_id": "PAtgWCLCFRQd_fjnihISOg", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-05-31", "type": "review"}

Avanti is located in suburban Phoenix so it would definitely have to be a recommend. I don't know how else you would find this place. \n\nIn any case, parking is plentiful. You walk into a \"mid 50-60\" decor with red walls and dim lighting. Servers are dressed in suits. White table cloth, complete table setting, sexy in its own way.\n\nShort menu (that is a plus) Short wine list (another plus) and a good selection of wines by the glass. \n\nThe food wash acceptable. The osso bucco was tasty but could have been done a tinge more. I like it when the marrow is like a gel... \nTruthfully, went there for the gnocchi which was okay.there were several sauces you could choose from to lather the gnocchi. I chose a cream sauce... Sauce was too thick for my liking, which IMHO took away from the texture of the gnocchi itself.\n\nI would go back though...atmosphere nice, servers nice...

Mirrored ceilings, velvet upholstered chairs, cheetah print fabric -- it was like I was in the 80's or in the movie \"Scarface.\"  The place was pretty quiet and the atmosphere would be good for maybe a birthday or a graduation dinner. \n\nI came here with some clients for dinner (on a weeknight) while we were in Phoenix.  There were 2 or 3 other tables here that night; not very busy.   \n\nThe menu had a good selection of various Italian dishes: pastas, seafood, chicken, veal, pork, etc. \n\nFor starters, we all shared the Calamari (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#KrxhHm5bvPqPTmXfpO2rjA) and the Escargot De Bourhohne (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#_lPAyaWEzQ9QK92_i6trfA).  The Calamari was delicious!  The batter was light and crisp, and the squid was pretty tender.  The Escargot was cooked in garlic butter and brandy wine, which gave it some nice flavors.  It was a little chewy, but it pretty much tasted like a clam. \n\nWe all shared a bottle of the 2010 Markham Merlot (Napa Valley) -- this had a nutty, vanilla, woodsy flavor.  We all ordered seafood so it paired nicely with our dishes.  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#ofGN_r7-hk5EeZkx8W0h1g)\n\nFor my main dish, I went with one of the specials offered that night, the Squid Ink Ciopinno (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#RCrj3Z_O7IyIUIVA6r5bTg).  This seemed more like a pasta rather than a ciopinno in my opinion.  What I love the most about ciopinno is that savory, rich, seafood broth.  This one didn't have any broth, it was more like a tomato sauce.  Although this dish did include a generous amount of seafood (mussels, shrimp, scallop), it didn't taste very fresh and had a rubbery texture. \n\nA few people at my table ordered the Dover Sole special that was available that night  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#9eQoEjUq1Ayiw6iKw4H5dg_.  This fish was fried whole, and then your server removes the fillet from the head/tail right before he served you.  Someone else ordered the Dover Sole dish that was available on the dinner menu (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#RFHGeb_vykwNYJeIQv_fDA).  She did not seem to enjoy this very much.  I had a taste of it and it had a murky/mushy taste and texture to it.  The sauce was very buttery-- I prefer the fried Dover over this one.\n\nDessert was okayyy.  I ordered the Spumoni  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#RlDB83kUQaeOOU-6EItG8A).  It looks like a vanilla turd, lol.  The texture of the ice cream tasted like those ice cream cups you'd get in elementary school-- icee, not creamy, and dirzzled with some Hershey's chocolate syrup.. what a disappointment.  The sorbet was a lot better than the Spumoni and was a refreshing palate cleanser (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#3go2OFhMl_zK2GETMSYJjg).  The Tiramisu (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#pOWH0I8A7J4-UFByf4FR_A) was average.. not great and not bad. \n\nIn my opinion, the prices here are super steep, especially for most of the dishes we orderded.  Service-wise, we were welcomed upon entrance and our server was very attentive... but only in the beginning of the meal.  It took us forever to get our check.", "business_id": "vvA3fbps4F9nGlAEYKk_sA", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-05-03", "type": "review"}

No real Italian would ever put cheddar cheese on an antipasto. Did I mention our food plates were piling up on our table, but no one came to take them away?

The fat, sweaty chef if that's who he was couldn't just say \"sorry we're out\" but had to respond \"too bad lady, you snooze, you lose.\"  \n\nCompletely uncalled for. My wife is a kind, polite woman. Maybe he thought they were actually the bomb because of the line, but there were very few food vendors.

So when men want to sit here and criticize my review by saying I was a \"drunk\" that is far from what I am EVER.\n\nThe ambiance of this place is nothing amazing with its outdated decor going on.  The waiters are all men and have been with the establishment for years on end besides the waiter we had which he says he was there for 7 months and said he was waiting tables for over 20 years (so he says) I found that hard to believe for some reason since the whole time we were there he not once brought out my coffee.  Also when I had ordered risotto my step-dad had told my sister and I that if we didn't want to eat now (because we were just eating over at chase field for the dodgers and dbacks game) that we could save the food for later which was WHY i ordered food in the first place. I had no intention to order to be perfectly honest.  I am kind of wishing I NEVER ordered anything at all the way all of the waiters and chef came out to basically yell at me for not touching my food. I really wish i was so  sick that i would have thrown up all over the place the way they were treating me on my birthday I felt so bullied.  So when OUR waiter took my food to be bagged up to take home he never brought it out for me to take home.  Yet my families food all got packaged up and brought back within a matter of seconds. Our waiter then brought out a very soggy tiramisu in which I have never had it that way ever and googled to see if I have just been eating it the wrong way my whole entire life.  No where on google does it say that its supposed to be that soggy.  \nIt was not until we were almost home I had forgotten my food since it was never once brought back out like we wasted our money for not eating my food right then and there. If im not mistaken i am pretty sure that the owner and chef were the same person.  In that case I will not be recommending this place to anyone in the future if the owner is that much of a douchebag to with hold my food because I was feeling so sick and just wanted some coffee the whole time I was there.  I should not have to repeat myself to have to ask for things consistently.  It is the waiters job to assess the situation and to be understanding.

I've driven by the center literally hundreds of times over the years, and have never noticed the pizza shop.  It was only just recently that I noticed them, based on their sign on the street advertising the lunch special of two slices and a soda for $3.99.  Fast forward to a few weeks later when I was sitting at my desk pondering where to go, but being unable to decide.  My memory bank finally remembered Frank's and away I went.\n\nI gotta admit, I was extremely nervous going in.  Here it was, right in prime lunch hour and there was nary a soul to be seen, other than the guy working there who was in the back (maybe it was Frank!).  Anywho, takes me order, and goes back to make the pie and I sat down and waited.  And waited a little bit more.  Then a guy came in and 'Frank' came out and chatted with him as they appeared to know each other.  Then a little more waiting happened.  I thought it was taking way too long as this point, seems at any other 'slice' joint I go to (Ray's/NYPD/etc.), it's just a few minutes.  Finally, 'Frank' brings my slices out and apologies to me that they were in the oven too long and would I like him to make new ones.  Well...I looked at that pizza, and all I saw was golden brown delicious cheese staring at me.  Which to me, is great when you have nice golden brown cheese.  So I told him no need, it looked great to me, and I started to chow down.\n\nWhile the temperature was hot, and I kind of burned my mouth a bit (stupid lack of self control to wait for it to cool), the pizza was terrific.  I mentioned the cheese before, but the crust was also very good, being nice and crispy on the bottom.  And then, when I got to the thick part, not only was the crust nice and chewy, the bottom was still crispy.  \n\nOverall, a good couple slices of pie.

I witnessed the delivery guy return and noted he was not carrying my order. Hmmm. So on top of really poor service I had been lied to as well. While I was waiting there (both times)  i watched a really incompetent staff handling the food with bare hands, the place seems also to be in the midst of remodeling (no longer carrying the ice cream). Poor service. Lied to, incompetent staff, mishandling of the food. I'm calling Mamma Mia's from now on, a little longer wait but worth the wait without the aggravation.", "business_id": "VWcaFOSFcDwmFquycBzFyQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-03-18", "type": "review"}
