I loved how the restaurant is in a old brick building with large windows. It felt like a neighborhood restaurant. On a Saturday night, the restaurant was full but not crowded.  We were seated in a room with poor acoustics.  It was difficult to hear people at our table and the waitress.  While she tried, I can see the asperation in her face when she had to repeat the specials to both sides of the table.\n\nPeople ordered bourbon on the rocks before dinner which seemed watered down, while my lemon drop was made nice.  The bread was delicious!  Can you describe it to be creamy?  The fried zucchini was lightly breaded and not too oily.  It was a large portion made up of 2 sliced zucchinis.\n\nWe ordered a variety of dishes.  The pasta dish was dry with more pasta than sauce or meat.  Those who ordered the fish special thought it was delicious.  The shrimp dish was enjoyed as well.  I had the chicken marsala which was pretty good.  The marsala sauce wasn't too thick, and the chicken moist.\n\nHard to tell if the deserts were \"homemade.\"  The tiramisu and spumoni were small in portion and meant for one. \n\nOn the whole, I was on the fence with my overall impression of Papa J's.  \"A-ok\" probably is the best way to describe it.", "business_id": "P1fJb2WQ1mXoiudj8UE44w", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-08-12", "type": "review"}

They also have Fruit Ninja as a game. It was fun with the big widescreen but unfortunately you don't win as many tickets as you would hope. I wish their ticket center would have individual ticket counters like the other D&B's I've been to, where you feed a counting machine your tickets. At this place, they just weigh your tickets and give you the final count. We didn't try the food here and instead went to P.F. Chang's to eat before coming here, but the Eat & Play deal looked fun.

Incidentally, \"The Hangover\" is one of the funniest movies I've seen in years and worth the $10 to see it in the theater.  Okay, back to the restaurant the space itself is very nice.  There are plenty of hightops, plasmas and a few booths.  It's spacious and they have outdoor seating and open windows.  We sat at the bar and were greeted relatively quickly by the bartender who was tending a pretty much empty bar.  I ordered a guinness as usual, Rob ordered a long island iced tea and Matt had a miller light.  Make sure and tell them if you want a top shelf tea else you'll be getting the stuff in the plastic bottles.  I sampled Rob's long island tea and it was not that good way too much sours.  The next one he ordered was much better after a little guidance to the bartender.  The bartender herself was okay, not too friendly but quick enough with the pours.  I don't remember her name which is usually not a good sign.  We ordered a few things from the appetizer menu.  We started with the chips and salsa.  The chips were crisp enough, but not served warm and the salsa had some spice but the colors were a little off kind of looked like the color of pea soup.  Rob then ordered the philly cheese steak sliders.  I tried one it was okay I guess  the bun was warm and it was pretty loaded with cheese and onions.  He asked for a side of mayo and they said they were out, which is bizarre because there is a giant eagle a couple blocks away.  This pretty much sums up my experiences at the Bar Louie's I've been too.  They kind of do just enough for me to come back but rarely make any real effort with service.  Maybe I'm being too critical... I tried to order the baked goat cheese, but they were out... So, I settled on the hummus appetizer.  This was surprisingly pretty good.  The pita was warm and toasted the hummus had lots of flavor and the tabouleh was edible.  It's probably best to stick to simple stuff when dining here.  Matt had the hot wings which I tried one and it was okay, your pretty standard mass produced chicken wing.  All in all this place isn't that bad.

I did, however, enjoy the mesclun salad that came with the omelet, especially the vinaigrette and fried shallot slices.

Being that it is a little out of my price range normally, I figured it was the best place to use my coupon and celebrate my birthday! Believe it or not, this was the 2nd Big Burrito restaurant that I have ever been to, Kaya being my first (and I only visited the Sunday prior to coming here on Friday). \n\nMy boyfriend and I made reservations for 6:30 pm on a Friday. We only made them the night before and it wasn't a problem at all. When you arrive, there is complimentary valet parking- how awesome is that? We were sat on the covered patio area, which I really loved. It was a little slanted, which was weird, but our table wasn't thankfully. It was really beautiful- plants and art all around. We started off with drinks- I ordered the white wine flight. Having had a wine flight one other time, I found these to be pretty reasonably priced. I received three small glasses of white wine for $11. Each one was delicious and I really loved how they were all from different places (Austria, Italy and Spain). \n\nNext, we received bread and two types of butter. One was more traditional and the other was a homemade lemon and herb butter. I really liked them both! For my entr\u00e9e, I ordered the pork chop. It came with a magical mix of sauces and two side dishes- one that was mainly potatoes and the other being saut\u00e9ed kale. WOW. The garlic cream sauce was unbelievable, the pork chop was HUGE and literally cooked to perfection. The kale was perfect, not bitter at ALL (how do they do that?)- it was amazing. The portion was huge and I somehow engulfed the entire thing. My boyfriend ordered the short rib ravioli's and loved it- although he preferred my meal over his. I was so full that I skipped the desert. They noticed my birthday coupon and presented me with an adorable little plate with \"Happy Birthday\" written in chocolate and two salted caramels- what an adorable touch! \n\nService was perfect, the wine was perfect, the food was perfect... now I see what the fuss is all about.

The salad is one of the best salads I remember eating and could easily be enough for an appetizer.  The pasta tossed in a vodka sauce was just ok.  The homemade pasta is not actually made in house (I asked), but it is 'fresh,' which I'm assuming meant bought from a store on the strip or a market district.\n\nWe had also ordered the calamari and the meatball appetizer because we were starving and that proved to be way too much food for a family of 5.  If you must get an appetizer, I highly recommend the meatball, you will not regret.\n\nThe veal chop is easily the best thing on the menu and where Alla Famiglia really shines.  From all the pasta plates and steaks and seafood dishes that were ordered at our table, the veal chop was by the unanimous favorite at our table.  Incredible flavors and tender cuts, but by the time you get to the main course, you're full with the bread, salad, and pasta that comes before you can't really enjoy it fully.  Most plates come with a side of their grilled veggies (which again were ok), but some dishes come with nothing so I would make sure to ask if you need a side.   So long story short, this is a marathon and don't expect to be done in an hour and a half.  Pace so you can really enjoy that veal chop at the end!\n\nWhen you first walk in it seems very small, but there are back rooms and stairs that go up one or two floors.  There's also a back patio one floor up from ground floor.  It's tight sitting spaces, but very cute and authentically Italian.  \n\nSo now that we established that the ambiance and food are pretty solid, the thing that earned this 3 stars is how we were hosted to our table.  We had a reservation at 7:30pm and were 30minutes early, which we recognize is nowhere near to our reservation time so we elected to grab drinks and sit on the patio.  When 7:30 comes around we inquire about our table only to be told that there was not a sitting space yet, which would be ok minus the fact that there were multiple tables open that we asked about.  7:45 we asked again and were told that they were setting up a table immediately.  8:10 comes around and we're still not seated so had to ask the hostess again, which apologized and sat us at the table we had asked about 40 minutes ago when our reservation time was.  It took 40 minutes to seat us at our table for our reservation time of 7:30 when there were tables open.\n\nIt was a frustrating experience because everyone was hungry and we weren't even offered bread sitting on their patio...

Max. \n\nFood on the other hand is ok. Not great. Ok. Worth going out of your way for? Absolutely not. I had the Parma hot sausage with a bowl of black bean soup- both things I love!!! We're these memorable? Not in the least. It's generous to say they were adequate. \"Mama's gravy\", a marinara sauce of sorts, was lackluster and flavorless. The sausage was just a split link of hot sausage and something I could replicate at home with ease. The black bean soup was listless and uninspired. Sad because i was expecting (hoping?) for so much more.  I wish I had ordered the chicken parm that the guys pressing up against me from behind ordered. It looked way better. But I'll not have that chance cause I won't be going back. I'll drive by this place a thousand times to go to other more deserving places on the Northside. \n\nSorry. Didn't do it for me.

The wall of Clemente, Steel Curtain photos, and my personal favorite, the shoe-string tackle of Nick Harper, which I find amusing to be considered one of the greatest plays in Pittsburgh sports apparently.  The rest of the establishment is clean and well-traveled appearing, and lots of high-def televisions satiates the sports-lover's attention whilst waiting on food.\n\nSo being the tourist that I am, I don't really know what to get, so I ask the waitress of \"what is THE food for a tourist like me?\"  With a confident smirk, she simply says \"pastrami,\" and I thank her for the suggestion, and I realize that it wasn't so much \"a suggestion\" as it was \"the order,\" and five minutes later, this monstrosity on a baking sheet is presented to me.  Thin-sliced pastrami, cole slaw, tomato, and I think there was some cheese in there, but a fistful of fries as well - you guys know the drill.\n\nSo in conclusion, great success.  I thought the pastrami sandwich was the stuff of legend, and just thinking about it has me kind of craving one again, even after lunch.  In fact, the best part of this particular trip to Pittsburgh was Primanti Bros., because my Braves ended up sending out the D-team, who naturally failed to beat a mediocre Pirates squad.

That one word sums up our group of 15's experience at the Spaghetti Warehouse. This restaurant has been a Pittsburgh institution for so long; however, it left many in our group unsatisfied and hungry at the end. My mom ordered the roasted garlic shrimp and her dish was dry and the shrimp were over cooked to the point of too chewy. I ordered the chopped salad \"warehouse style\" as my main entree and it was a big salad. Yet the veggies in the salad weren't fresh and the warm chicken was burnt and wilted the lettuce with its heat. I sent it back without eating it (at least the waitress was kind enough to take it off of our bill). My fiance got the lasagna and chicken parm off of the classic combo section of the menu and his chicken was ok but not great. The lasagna was good too. However, neither were great.  My aunt and father were unimpressed with their dishes as well but I'm not sure what they got so I can't speak to their food quality.\n\nAlso, it took us an hour after we ordered to receive our food and our food was cold. Granted, I understand we have a party of 15 BUT the restaurant was not packed by any stretch of the means. In fact the room we sat in had approximately 10 open tables. I can't speak to how filled the other rooms of the restaurant were though. But there should not have been a hour wait nor should we have gotten cold food as a result of it. \n\nWe have booked this restaurant for our rehearsal dinner for our wedding but, considering how poor the food was and how incredibly slow the service was (no fault of the waitress), we are looking to change our reservations to a different restaurant. We chose the Spaghetti Warehouse because it is close to the hotel where all of our guests for our wedding are staying. Given how slow the service was, we can't afford to be there til 10:30pm at night when we have to be up at 6am the next morning for a very long day. (Another reviewer said that their rehearsal dinner group took 3+ hours to get out of there).  \n\nJust my 2 cents.  I wish the food quality and service were better.

Steak he wants, steak he gets!  We did a little bit of research about where to get a great piece of meat in Pittsburgh, and we finally decided to check out Morton's.  We'd heard of it from Chicago, and it definitely has a good reputation there too.\n\nSo we came in for our 7:30 reservation on a Tuesday.  The hostess greeted us warmly, and led us into the dimly lit room to our booth.  I had told them on OpenTable that it was my boyfriend's birthday, and my mom called ahead to pre-order some things, so the waitstaff knew that we were celebrating.  And wow, somebody told him \"Happy birthday!\" every 15 minutes!  They all knew about it!  Our menus actually had \"Happy 28th birthday, Taylor!\" printed on them.  My mom had pre-ordered sparkling wine, which was waiting for us on ice when we arrived.  The sommelier (wearing a tux!) poured it for us.  After we toasted, a hostess came by with a digital camera and snapped our picture.  Five minutes later, she came back with a print out of the picture, and a birthday card signed by various servers.  Wowza!\n\nWe felt unbelievably welcomed.  We helped ourselves to a slice of the huge loaf of onion-y bread sitting on the table, while we listened to our server tell us about the various menu offerings.  It's a little funny how they have examples of the food sitting under plastic wrap.  It does give you a nice visual for the steaks, but it's a little funny for....asparagus.  Still, seeing the size of the meat helped us make our choice.\n\nFirst, we got the onion soup and the Caesar salad.  The onion soup was served bubbling hot, with a layer of cheese baked on top, of course.  It was very tasty - not the best I've ever had, but it definitely hit the spot for two hungry people!  Something about the broth was a bit too sweet perhaps.  The Caesar was great - they knew we were splitting it so they served it on two perfectly portioned plates - you could taste every single ingredient that goes in a classic Caesar.  You know they made this dressing perfectly - can't leave out the anchovy!  Delicious.\n\nWe each got the bone-in Ribeye, which was 20 oz of medium-rare amazingness.  Our steaks were unbelievably tender and flavorful.  The meat was pretty marbled, but the fat was so succulent that honestly I ate every bite of it.  The meat needs no sauce - just that luscious char on top and warm tender beef within.  Fantastic.  Loved every bite.  Our one wish was that the plates were warmed - since they were cool, it seemed like the steak was cooling down faster than it should.  But that didn't stop us from loving our wonderful dinner!\n\nMom had pre-ordered two desserts, their classic chocolate cake and the creme brulee.  I didn't taste the cake, but my boyfriend said it was incredibly rich and decadent.  I loved the creme brulee, and somehow finished every bite despite being stuffed already.\n\nService was always friendly, the ambiance was romantic, and truly I felt like we were royalty.  Come here on a special occasion, and you'll see what I mean.  It is a very expensive place to eat, but totally worth it for a special occasion.  With prices that high, you deserve to feel like their most cherished patrons of all time, and we certainly did.  I would very much like to come back the next time we have something to celebrate and want to have a big steak at the same time!", "business_id": "90Fqfzd8zD9AuuNBSv9lAg", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-08-18", "type": "review"}

I said I'd like a table and he told me to wait for a waitress. Still nothing. No one came over. \nThen I was handed a menu by the bar tender and sat myself at a table. 20 minutes later, nothing. Even when a family was seated immediately next to me, the waitress took their order and didn't even look at me as I stared at her face and got to point where I had to wave the menu around to get her attention. Nothing. \n\nEventually I had enough and left, which they still probably didn't notice. \n\nMake sure to bring a huge group of people if you do make the mistake to eat here, because that's the only way this backwards place will give you any respect. \n\nIf not, and you're alone, don't waste 30 minutes here without being acknowledged like I did.", "business_id": "-KQ283hJkBO12u8XOrlCcQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-08-10", "type": "review"}

This place is what it would be like if your Italian grandmother opened a grocery store near you, so that you could still enjoy her homemade goodness while you're away. \n\nEverything I've had from the hot foods table is phenomenal -- the oft-touted meatball sandwiches, the eggplant parm, the stuffed peppers (brought 'em home to my dad dahn in Washpa, and he said it was THE best stuffed pepper he'd ever had), the chicken cacciatore, the Italian sausage, the rotini with meat sauce, and the pepperoni rolls. OH, the pepperoni rolls! They're big, they're stuffed with quality pepperoni and cheese, they're crispy on the bottom, and have what I consider the determining factor in what makes a pepperoni roll awesome -- tons of burnt cheese crusted on the outside. (Side note: If you want a pepperoni roll and are in Bloomfield, come here; don't go to Pizza Italia.) But, it doesn't stop there. \n\nIt's easy to walk straight over to the hot foods and ignore the rest of the store, but don't. The freezers are packed with good food glory! Grab a bag of the frozen, homemade gnocchi and a quart of the marinara sauce (kept in the cooler with salads), and you've got an incredible meal in 5 minutes flat. The gnocchi are perfection -- dense, yet light, and the flavor screams, \"I'm homemade! Boxed, pre-packaged gnocchi ain't got nothin' on me!\" I'm going to buy 4 more bags of them today. \n\nThey also have frozen, homemade pierogies (haven't tried 'em yet), pastas, sausages, Italian ice, and -- drumroll, please -- tiramisu. There's a sign on the front door that says, \"We have the best tiramisu!\" and they are not lyin'. It's phenomenal. Because of that, it's also super dangerous stuff. Diet-ruining, can't-stop-eating kinda stuff.\n\nThey have a nice li'l selection of pantry stuff, too -- quality olive oils, vinegars, anchovies, olives, spices, mayo, etc., as well as a small refrigerated section with milk, and some local produce, like lettuce, cukes, tomatoes, etc. This is definitely a place you can pop into to try and avoid a Giant Eagle run!\n\nLast, but not least, something good to know: I asked one of the guys working there if they had certain days of the week designated for certain dishes, and he said, \"No, the two ladies just come in early and see what's in the kitchen and make whatever they feel like making that day!\" I love that. Somebody's grandma really is making this food, and you can tell it's all made with lots and lots of love. \n\nGroceria Italiana, I will be patronizing you for years to come!", "business_id": "DsxLIr-b6WlDn9YNsVBu_A", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-08-12", "type": "review"}

The owners of Tessaro's do, which is part of the charm.\n\nIf you're in the mood for a tasty burger when you're in Bloomfield, you can't go wrong with Tessaro's. For my most recent lunch visit, I decided to change it up a bit and went for the cheesesteak with a side of boiled red potatoes.\n\nI chuckled when my food arrived. The cheesesteak was ridiculously large, overflowing with meat. The red potatoes came with a cup of melted butter for dipping. If you don't think potatoes should come with a cup of melted butter, honestly, you should go somewhere else... somewhere else where you can enjoy hating flavor. Personally, I assaulted those potatoes and didn't look back.\n\nThe cheesesteak was average. With some salt added, it was slightly above average. My advice to the kitchen would be to add some more salt and pepper while cooking to make it tastier out of the gate.\n\nTessaro's provides a classic Pittsburgh experience. While the food may only be worth three out of five stars, I'm going to add on another star because I like the fact that the dining room is dark, the menu is filled with meat, and the staff is friendly and efficient.

Our service was wonderful and the waitstaff was incredibly attentive. \n\nMy friend and I split a bottle of chianti and started off with some delicious escarole and beans.

The environment of this \"cantina\" is distinctive; tucked in the corner of a peruvian arts store, and co-owned by the people who own Pamela's, this place has \"hit\" once, and \"missed\" once.  They do have a very basic menu which doesn't change, but the items on there are those that you can pretty easily make at home.  The daily specials that they have are the ones that are a bit more elaborate, and come with a few sides, such as rice and french bread.\n\nI previously thought that peruvian food was simply chicken and rice.  Although this is still the main two ingredients they use, this restaurant has definitely changed my perspective on how many different ways they can prepare chicken.  The first time I went I got a \"ropa vieja\", which was a very simple meat-only sandwich.  The second time I went I got a chicken dish that was mixed with dried fruits: that was delicious.  However my fried ordered a grounded pork dish that ended up tasting like glorified taco meat.  Unfortunately that didn't make for a great first impression.\n\nOverall, be wary of what peruvian food specializes in, and order accordingly.

Since 1980, Pamela's has been voted \"Best Breakfast\" by Pittsburgh's City Paper survey.  Not to mention the diner's modest flare received the White House's \"Presidential approval.\"  \n\nIn the fall, while President Obama was on the campaign trail, he ate breakfast at Pamela's.  He loved the crepe-style pancakes so much, he asked Klingensmith and Cohen to prepare a Memorial Day breakfast at the White House for him and dozens of American troops!  Now, that's a good pancake!\n\nI've sampled just about everything on the breakfast menu and, after eight years of patronage, my favorite is still the strawberry hotcakes.  These thinly poured crepes are laid flat, then rolled around a delicious combination of strawberries, brown sugar and sour cream, topped off with a nice dab of whipped cream to truly send your sugar levels through the roof.  They're simple, delicious and just enough not to feel \"stuffed.\"\n\nThe egg and omelet plates come with home fries (chunky sliced potatoes with what appears to be approximately 1/4 small white onion and a 1/2 lb of butter per serving) and your choice of toast.   The spinach and feta omelet with rye is a decent combination.  But as a warning, these plates are not for the weak.  \n\nFor smaller appetites, they do offer fresh fruit bowls, egg white plates and a variety of a la carte items.  \n\nThe space is typical of older Walnut Street buildings with typical diner flare - simple painted brick with tables bolted to the walls.  On weekends, the room get's pretty cramped.  (A note to parents with small children: if you have large strollers, it may be a good idea to either leave them in the car or ensure they pack neatly in the corner.)  If you get there around 11:00 a.m. the wait can run you about 30 minutes or more, and there's literally one small bench to sit at while inside.  Weekday crowds are much lighter.  \n\nParking can be found on the street, or in the metered parking lot located behind the building.  There's no need to feed street meters on Sundays.  \n\nAll in all, this diner is a classic.  It's managed to outlive a lot of other local businesses while the larger corporate chains have moved on the street.  Perhaps it's the presidential influence, perhaps because it's \"cash only,\" but I think it's because the food is good, down-home cooking.", "business_id": "TxKmAsKQjND5vbhBdUSyIA", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-08-07", "type": "review"}

The crispy prosciutto was by far the best part of this appetizer and I would have been happy with just a plate full of that, but the crab cakes were good too!\n\nAfter the apps we were served a corn muffin with butter that we thought was a little on the dry side. That was followed by a palate cleansing blackberry lime sorbet in a sugar rimmed glass. The sorbet was divine, but I have a hard time considering it a course.\n\nElla chose the Rosemary and Dijon Crusted Rack of New Zealand Lamb with chevre-arugala cous cous and glazed carrots for her entree. The lamb was cooked perfectly and had an awesome crunch thanks to the dijon and breadcrumb topping. I don't get the chance to eat a lot of cous cous, but after this dish I'm going to make it a point to. The cous cous itself was perfectly soft and tender which went great with the slight bite of the carrots and the creamy goat cheese. This might be one I have to try and recreate at our house.\n\nI got the Coffee-Rubbed Filet of Ribeye topped with a red onion-bacon jam, duchesse potato, whipped lima beans, and a veal demi-glace. I know this will probably shock most of you... but I HATE COFFEE. So my coffee-rubbed filet of ribeye came without the coffee part. The best part of the plate easily the slightly sweet and savory red onion-bacon jam. The worst... for me was the whipped lima beans, but that's probably because I don't like lima beans to begin with. The duchesse potato was pretty good but I would have easily traded its beautiful presentation for a larger quantity and the veal demi-glace paled in comparison to the red onion-bacon jam.\n\nWe started the dessert courses with the Carrot Cake with Cream Cheese Frosting, White Chocolate-Brown Sugar Mousse, Carrot-Olive Oil Puree, and Valencia Orange Gel\u00e9e.  The carrot cake flavor left a little to be desired, but the orange gel\u00e9e was awesome and I give the chef props for creativity. Beth's Pecan Pie with maple bacon ice cream, powdered sugar, and fresh whipped cream was hands down the better of the two desserts. The pie was both sticky and gooey... just as any good pecan pie should be. The maple bacon ice cream was also really good and added a bit of fun to a traditional dessert, but I hated the little rolled cookie.\n\nOverall.. I guess we would say we liked the McNinch House. I don't think they had the best food in Charlotte for our palate but they've been awarded 15th consecutive Four Diamond designation from AAA and are listed as one of the top \"extraordinary\" restaurants in America by Zagat's Dining Guide, which would make me think that obviously a lot of people enjoy the restaurant. We had a great dinner, thought the service was A+, and absolutely loved the history of the house... but I still think comparing just food to food, there might be a couple of other places better in the Queen City.", "business_id": "USdRzNk14UdjZWFgBJb0wA", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-07-05", "type": "review"}

All the wines are on a tablet, which was really neat cause you could easily scroll through the bottles and filter. We ended up settling on a Zin/Shiraz blend. It was absolutely delish....I wish I got the name of it!\n\nSince we were dining for restaurant week ($35 per person), the menu was limited. However, I would love to return cause I heard their lobster mac was fantastic! I decided on the clam chowder, 8oz filet mignon, and chocolate flourless espresso cake. My husband picked the wedge salad, ribeye (i think it was crazy big like 14 oz) and chocolate flourless cake. \n\nUnfortunately, the clam chowder wasn't anything special. I have a huge love for chowders and this one simply didnt do anythign for me. I took a bite of my husbands salad and it was very good. Our steaks came out next. They were cooked absolutely perfectly! The filet mignon literally melted in my mouth. My husbands steak was seasoned so well. This is definitely where Capital Grille shined! The shared potatoes that came with it were perfect. Additionally, the meal came with shared green beans. I thought the green beans weren't cooked enough, but that is just a personal preference. The taste was excellent though. Lastly, the desserts. Oh my gosh, rasberries, cream, and the fudge like cake. Perfection. That dessert was spot on!\n\nThere was one small incident that I wasn't super thrilled with how it was handled. The waiter brought over our steaks and sides. In the few seconds it took me to grab my fork and knife and almost cut into my steak, my husband (and at the same time, the waiter) realized he brought over the wrong steaks. Like, our entire order was for a different table. Literally, not a big deal at all. Misstakes happen. However, without even an apology he grabbed all the plates, including the veggie sides (that come with all restaurant week meals!) and cleared our table.

And of course the beautiful and delicious food! The menu had a lot of options for a fancier place, and the dishes seemed to be quite unique - filet of elk, seafood, interesting complementing sauces and combinations. \n\nTwo types of complimentary cornbread (sweet and additionally peach & bourbon served with sweet kudzu butter) - yum! We started off with an appetizer, the ahi tuna with white chocolate foam and microgreens. it was very tasty, and was a decent sized portion for sure! I also enjoyed the warm lobster salad which was truly a piece of art to look at (a little awkward to eat) and very tasty - the flavors of everything blended well, I wish there were more greens though. For my entree I ordered a special - Yellow Fin Tuna with a grain of some sort and asparagus - I had it cooked medium, and it was great. There was just enough seasoning, but not too much to over power. The grains were mild and complimented the tuna. I would order it again. The people with me had the elk filet and were very pleased with their choice. \n\nOf course we had dessert. I opted for a dish with strawberries and kiwis with a marscapone ice cream. It was light, and maybe a little too sweet - but summery and fruity. The ice cream was great. The others ordered the crispy creme makers mark bread pudding and could not stop raving about it - so I would say go for it if that's your thing. \n\nOverall, I would go back. The bill was around 70 bucks a person, the service was great, and the food was very good.\n\nNote: their menu is out of date online", "business_id": "C9CF7p53Y0L5ErKRhhFhng", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-07-10", "type": "review"}

Then my bill would have been about the same or less, I would have gotten what I wanted, and I wouldn't have had to fight for a reservation at the most popular spots. Had I done that at  Mama Ricotta's, I would have ordered the Warm Goat Cheese and Marscapone Dip and Butternut Squash Ravioli or the Cannolicchi Pesto Di Pomodoro Secco.  My taste buds would have been doing the happy dance, because those are my \"go to\" dishes at Mama's, and they never disappoint.\n\nInstead, I had the Mozzarella and Tomatoes Salad, which was good and should have been, because that is a tough dish to turn into a hot mess. I also had Mama's Pesto Pasta, which was on the bland side at the restaurant, but the leftovers were much better the next day after overnight marination. My main course was Veal Milanese Primavera, which was just okay. Judge me if you want, but if veal is on a restaurant menu, I'll generally order it. Like lamb or venison, it is something I'm most likely not going to prepare at home, only because I wouldn't know what to do with it. However, I've sampled quite a bit of veal in restaurants, and this veal was nothing special.\n\nOne of my dinner companions actually did order off of the regular menu, and chose the Canneloni Al Forno. It pains me to say this, because I generally like Mama's, but it was not good. I didn't even know this was possible, but it was fairly flavorless except for the aftertaste, which to me was sour. My companion disagreed on the aftertaste, but felt that it was below average in general because it lacked flavor.\n\nOther companions had the Penne Alla Vodka and the Pollo Carciofi, which they enjoyed.\n\nThe Nutella Pie, though, was more than large enough to share, and was creamy and full of hazelnut and chocolate delectableness, and frankly was what drew me to restaurant week at Mama Ricotta's. As always, the bread was warm, garlicky carbohydrate joy. Service was amiable, if a bit slow on entr\u00e9e delivery and water refills. The half-price wine on Monday nights was also a plus. \n\nFour stars are being given to Mama Ricotta's for their usual fare.

I started my meal warm goat cheese salad (with wine poached onions, hazelnut crusted goat cheese, mixed greens and an apricot jalapeno vinegarette). I can't say no to warm goat cheese and it's rich, creamy texture; so was a bit disappointed that the feature of the dish, the goat cheese, was quite sparse (only two goat cheese, for lack of a better term, balls, adorned my salad). While I liked the concept of the crusted goat cheese, the crust was not quite crisp, and the texture felt like it needed a few more minutes of cooking. \n\nFor my entr\u00e9e, I order the maple sorghum glazed hanger steak, which came with farro, vegetable pilaf and pickled fennel. This was an elevated comfort dish; the steak came nestled on the farro and veggies, and the flavors of all three complimented each other. The steak was cooked to my liking (rare, though the middle was a tad warm if we're splitting hairs); and was so incredibly juicy that I probably could have used a butter knife for slicing. However, the maple glaze was a bit sweet, and overpowered some bites to where I couldn't taste the meat and left a candied aftertaste in my mouth. As a self-proclaimed red meat connoseiur, it was a delicious and delightful steak, and I would wholeheartedly recommend the dish.\n\nAt this point of the meal, I was proud of myself for wearing a highwaisted dress, because I felt like I was going to burst at the seams.

My slice of pie was decorated with salted caramel sauce and strawberries, and while I was a bit hesitant about the sweet, on sweet, on sweet, it totally worked and I ate the whole thing. The brightness and sweetnes of the fresh strawberries enhanced the coconut, and the caramel provided just the right amount of salty balance.

We like to take them somewhere that they can't go when they are back in their perspective cities that is also AMAZING and leave a memory in their mouth and mind. \n\nWe've had everything from craw-fish appetizer, fried green tomatoes, Fried Oysters, etc.. to Entrees including the Blacken Salmon topped with craw-fish and artichoke & sun dried tomato, Shrimp & Craw-fish Diane, Chicken Diane, Gumbo, Seafood Etouffee', New Orleans Platter (Fried Everything) etc..\n\nAll items mentioned are AWESOME, there are ALWAYS deals on Groupon however we go with or without a Groupon because it's WELL WORTH IT.. Be sure to make a reservation and if you don't be prepared to wait, however the bar area is small upstairs but a good time to say the least.\n\nHappy Eating", "business_id": "jTGQUWGIVvL-aY03C5BEmw", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-06-11", "type": "review"}

We sat ourselves at the bar and ordered a spider roll and another roll I don't remember, a tempura udon, and a chicken katsu. \n\nI got to see the sushi guy making my rolls and thought to myself wtf is he making? There was no delicacy. I was surprised when he handed me the dish. I obviously wasn't happy to see the result. The rolls were warm like there was no sushi rice. It was just regular white rice so it pretty much tasted awful especially with not much crab. The amount of rice was ridiculous I thought I was eating onigiri, or rice ball.\n\nThen my chicken katsu and my mom's udon came out. The chicken katsu was just what I was expecting, nothing more nor nothing less. Rice, chicken, salad, additional side item and this time was tuna pasta salad? and miso soup. It was good. Just normal chicken katsu. Not so crispy this time. The portion is pretty big. My mom liked the udon. The broth was clear and light color, the tempuras came out on a separate plate. Tempuras were just ok. \n\nThe sushi was very disappointing but the rest was fine. I don't know if I'll comeback when I'm in town again.

However restaurant week and the meat-eater's friend being a chef at Upstream led us to visit this week. We showed up around 7:30 during restaurant week, expecting a bit of a wait. The hostess was very pleasant and offered seating outside on the patio right away or suggested a drink in the bar while we waited. We chose the bar. \n\nThis seems to be more of an older 50+ crowd with a few exceptions. Mostly business casual attire but I didn't feel out of place in dressed up jeans. The d\u00e9cor is traditional Southpark - dark woods and colors. \n\nThe bartender greeted us promptly, presented the wine list and gave us a few minutes to decide. They have an extensive (and pricey) wine list and a handful of specialty cocktails and martinis. Drinks were served and that was the extent of our bartender interaction. He seemed to get in the weeds a bit with all the server orders coming in. Not a big issue as we didn't really need anything else but could be a problem if we were trying to order at the bar.  \n\nOur wait was as promised - approximately thirty minutes. The dining room is a bit smaller than I anticipated but nicely laid out. You have a glimpse at the open kitchen but not enough to gawk during your whole meal and enough privacy at the tables and booths that you don't hear your neighbors' conversations. Our server greeted us, got our new drink order and came back to discuss the special. I must admit, I enjoyed freaking him out by dropping the \"I'm a vegan\" on him. I doubt this is a normal request at Upstream and I wouldn't dream of showing up without advance warning (which we'd done via the friend).  He consulted with the kitchen and came back looking much more relaxed and surprised with how easy it would be to accommodate me. I had the Shaved Athena Melon salad sans ham, tomato risotto sans cheese and a lovely sorbet sampler with warmed peaches. The sorbet, while really good, isn't made in house. Meat-eater had the Smoked Cod Cake and Lobster cakes, Snake River Ranch Wagyu Flank Steak and French Macaroons. He's still talking about the cod and lobster cakes and how good they were.  I really enjoyed all my courses. The salad did need a little \"oomph\" to make up for the lack of salty ham but overall very happy with our meals. \n\nI was impressed with the service. Our plates were removed quickly, our server was present in the dining room but not in the way, courses were served promptly and glasses kept full. \n\nUpstream isn't my normal type of preferred dining or cuisine but I appreciate any place that has excellent service and chefs that know their food and are willing to make accommodations in a gracious manner for special diets.  I know Upstream is part of the Harper's Group but I thought it had enough personality to not be classified \"just another corporate place\".", "business_id": "BOp3jcpYy31M85H1DLnEEw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-07-27", "type": "review"}

The menu, in paper and on the wall, is quite large, and with just enough time to eat and run to the next appointment, I quickly skimmed the menu and settled on a half sandwich (roast beef) and the New England clam chowder.  One friend chose the same as me except the potato soup and a 1/2 of aturkey club, and the other friend chose a cheesy baked potato.  If you are familiar with this restaurant, which has many locations throughout the Charlotte area, you will remember that you must order at the counter.  It was a very quick and friendly process at this location.  Also, a nice older gentleman that comes around and ask you how you are doing, if he can be of any help, and asks if he can clear stuff away for you.  Now the food part:  My roast beef sandwich was lacking in thickness of meat, and a bit fatty on the roast beef.  My New England clam chowder was hot...it's hard to please a New Englander when it comes to chowda'...but not hardly any clams, too uniformed cut potatoes and lots of emulsifiers does not a chowder make. Now onto my friends plates.  The potato soup was described as hot and creamy and the 1/2 a turkey club sandwich was quite large and nicely put together.  The baked potato that my other friend had was gi-normous.  I'm telling you, this thing could have been used as a regulation sized football.  Where the heck do they find potatoes that big I wonder?  Really, I had to do a triple take to see whether it was 2 potoatoes cleverly disguised as one, but it wasn't, it was just one big 'tater.  Okay, I know, I'm going to far on the size of the potato, but boy did it look goooooooddd!  It had 2 types of cheese, a nice cheddar cheese for color and a wonderful stringy mozzarella.  \nThe prices for all these items came up to about $25.00.  Really pretty good for 3 people needing a quick lunch.\nI'll go back to McAlister's again, but I think, next time, I'll be ordering that pig skin of a potato!", "business_id": "t719u5GZY0yPX4U7t5whrg", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-08-11", "type": "review"}

I'm giving it 4 Stars because we have had far more good experiences than bad ones but you don't know quite what you're going to get when you go.  Food is generally good but it can be slow.  If you're hungry be sure to order some starters as soon as you arrive. They still might take 20+ minutes.  Wings, nachos, and other bar food is usually pretty consistent though there are exceptions.  Usually their chicken tenders are outstanding--among the best I have ever had.  However, sometimes they serve a substitute which are among the worst I have ever had.  Service is also hit and miss.  Even with a good waitress we find that they are \"gone\" far more than they are circulating.  They tend to congregate at the bar, particularly when things are slow.  Some are good at their job and seem to be competent and happy that they are in food service.  Others act like they despise being in food service and seem like they'd rather be doing ANYTHING other than waiting on the general public.  The place does need a really good clean-up and re-fresh.  The men's restroom is worse than any bowling alley or bus station I've ever been to.  It's the worst of any restaurant I've ever been to and has been for years.  It needs major repairs and cleaning.  Ideally it should be completely overhauled with completely new facilities, improved ventilation and some sort of deodorizer.  It seems to be undersized for the place and between that and apparent vandalism, it's always in poor shape.  \n\nI like the good experiences I have had at Baileys.

It was a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!! The service here is HORRIBLE!! \n\nWe went there around 9pm and was the only couple there besides another group at the place. The other group left shortly after we came, but we never got service after we received our food. We never got asked if we needed anything else and received no water refill. They had 6 staff walking around working and doing their own thing and NOT ONE of them ever even stop to come check on us especially our waitress. When we finally got up to leave she was talking out loud from the far back asking us if everything was okay. I wanted to throw a fit and say.. \"no, everything is not okay we got no service!\" \n\nAside from the poor customer service; we ordered my favorite dish which was the pad thai. I asked for no onions and bean sprouts, but we still got it with LOTS of big onions and bean sprouts. My husband told me to say something about it; but I figure I would deal w/ it because I'm always iffy about what people do with my food after they take it back and have to fix it for me. It already took about 15 minutes or so for them to bring out the dish and I didn't want to have to wait another 15 minutes. \n\nWe also ordered sticky rice..and I LOVE sticky rice. It took them longer to bring us the sticky rice than the other three dishes that we ordered. The sticky rice was not moist and sticky at all. It was dried and crusty like its been sitting out for too long. I guess they were trying to microwave or steam it before they brought it out, but didn't do a very good job.\n\nWe also ordered the green curry dish; that dish cost $13.95 and came in such a small size plate that should have been worth $7 at the most! Big disappointment on that dish. \n\nSo base on my experience last night; I have concluded that I will NEVER go here again nor will I even bother to order take out from this place.

This is a tasty sauce I've had many times so I knew what I was given.  The wings were brought to me pipping hot and the ranch was thick and cold.  There's nothing I despise more than a warm, runny ranch.  The wings were cooked with the perfect amount of crispiness but were not overcooked by any means.  \n\nMy only complaint with the wings is that they are not charred.  I'm sorry to say, but if you're not throwing your wings over an open-flame and charring them at this point then you're simply behind the times.  Plenty of establishments such as Fanz, Hickory Tavern and Mac's throw their wings over a grill before serving them.\n\nIf your looking for a chill and relaxing WEEKDAY evening to watch your favorite team, Picassos is the perfect place.  On football Sundays, Picasso's University is nothing short of perfectly organized mayhem.  Fans often arrived at 11am-11:30am even though their game doesn't kick-off until 1pm!  Furthermore, you are very likely to see a skirmish or a squabble as Sunday day turns into Sunday evening and patrons start to get that liquor courage. \n\nBefore I close, I want to make an important distinction in my rating.  I give Picasso's Sports Cafe as a whole  5-stars.  The staff is always friendly, prompt and efficient.  However, I am not giving their Cajun Garlic Wings 5-stars!  Though their wings are good, there are not \"5-star\" worthy.  On a scale of 1-10, I'd give them a 7.\n\nAt its soul, this is a classic, American sports-bar.

On one hand, I want to say Monty's is an awesome place with great food. On the other hand I want to say Monty's is overrated. \n\nLet me explain. \n\nI love Monty's because of the options. If you are a vegetarian or vegan you aren't confined to the world of salads. There are many delicious and satisfying options. If you don't restrict your diet in any way, there are many great meaty and chalorically rich options for you too. Watching carbs? Get a sandwich in a wrap. Looking for a healthy lean meat option? Choose one of the several good chicken dishes. \n\nI personally steer towards the lean meat or veggie dishes and have never been disappointed. It's really hard to find a restaurant that caters to my needs as well as my boyfriend's nonrestrictive diet needs. This place does it well and at a pretty decent price. \n\nThough, I don't personally think Monty's is overrated, I feel that the point needs to be made. Whatever you order will be fresh and pretty tasty. However, say you order The Meatloaf of the Gods, it may not be what you expect if you are the type of person that is looking for traditional 'the-way-mom-made-it' meatloaf slathered with ketchup. If you are looking for an extensive breakfast menu consisting of traditional American breakfast combos (i.e. - a dish that contains ALL of the following: pancakes, eggs, hash browns, 3 kinds of meat and toast), Denny's or Perkin's may be a better option for you. \n\nThey put their own spin on the more traditional dishes and have created an awesome list of in-house specialties. Whether you eat meat or not you MUST try The Meatless Meatloaf of the Gods. It's amazing. Like your beef? Definitely try the Blueplate Burger! Don't like beef so much but still want a burger? Try the Blueplate Burger with a locally made walnut burger. \n\nNo matter who you are, Monty's is worth a try.", "business_id": "fjaQ3Ixkofh8xGhklUtDnA", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-08-10", "type": "review"}

The beer was outrageous, and we were teased a bit when we didn't order it. I ordered the shrimp and papaya. It tasted good, and I know this is Wisconsin, but there were about 7 shrimp on a HUGE bed of cabbage. The plantain appetizer was served AFTER our meal arrived and they were soggy and fairly gross. To be fair, the ribs and chicken was a more substantial meal and was well executed.\nThe worst part of the meal was the waitress. We were not greeted when we walked in although it was the middle of the dinner hour, which wasn't so bad, but it was a harbinger of how the rest of the meal went. After being werved, we didn't see the waitress again. During the meal, she never refilled our water glasses even tho that was the primary drink of my dinner mate.  After we were finished, I had to interrupt the waitress and the dishwasher who were watching TV, very loudly too, in order to get a to-go box. We were then chastised because the box was for my friend, not me, and she thought that he should've been the one to speak up. We shouldn't have had to speak up at all!!!\n\nSo, the final analysis is that they produce mostly good food, but it is WAY overpriced and the customer service sucks.", "business_id": "qodyGnpmj1zEfi7nJ534BA", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-06-14", "type": "review"}

They are similar to Culvers but doesn't offer you that \"home quality\" kind of experience. \n\nI typically get the Bleu Ribbon with some pink. I like the fried onion straws they add to the burger as well as this chipotle spread they use after toasting their buns. Mix that with the burger, BBQ sauce and bleu cheese and you've got a great tasting large juicy burger. I sometimes have to cut it in half because it's hard to take a bite out of. The burger comes with a side of endless steak fries they are often cooked to perfection. They are one of the few places that offers onion rings, however, as much as I love me some rings, I do not care much for theirs. The onions they use are extremely thick making it hard to bit into. I have often times ended up just eating the breading and putting the onions to the side. They are onion rings! This doesn't make any sense! They need to slice their onions thinner. As of now, I do not believe they are editable. \n\nMy other negative is presentation. The Bleu Ribbon has a lot going on so I realized that sometimes the burger can get messy. However, there have been times where my burger has come out looking like it went through a tornado. Lettuce falling everyone, too much BBW sauce, bleu cheese thrown on. The presentation needs to get better. I've experienced this at two different Red Robins. Also, I've also noticed that within the last year, they've cut back on the amount of steak fries they give you. Since they are bottomless it makes really no difference but I've definitely seen a change. \n\nThat being said, I would rate Red Robbi as being more than just an \"A-OK\" burger joint but they are far from a \"4+ star\" quality kind of joint. I do like the atmosphere. They have a few game machines, TV's, bar, background music and great classic pictures hanging on the walls that are great for helping to start a conversation ( say you're on a first date?). The art and photography they use to decorate the place I believe adds a lot of character and \"spunk\". \n\nThey do get very busy on weekends so expect a wait for a table and for your food but from my experience, it has never been extremely long. Wait staff has been good for me as well. \n\nOverall, they are a solid burger place. A bit pricey but I do think they are good. \n\nOh, one more thing, if you're dieting,....The Bleu Ribbon is 1,001 calories and fries are close to 500 calories!!! (According to my \"Lose it!\" app - they could be wrong but I also believe this is an extremely high calorie meal)", "business_id": "4pZeC9W0EIiBTOJMnwG2vw", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-06-04", "type": "review"}

See my review of Brother's Three for similar sentiments.\n\nWhat's great about Toby's is the environment. It is a dark bar filled with old beer signs and locals, and for this, as well as the service and experience of eating here, I'd give the place five stars if my conscience would allow it.\n\nThere's a procedure to Toby's. You enter and sit at the bar. You order at the bar, and the server comes to get you when your food is ready, and then you are seated.\n\nThe bartenders make a great Old-fashioned, one of the best in the city. \n\nAt your table, you'll find an array of decent goods typical of a supper club: a basket of de-frozen rolls; a plate of celery, carrots, and scallions; again, de-frozen cinnamon rolls for dessert; and breadsticks and butter.\n\nThe best dish on the menu, one that I can't order, is fried chicken. They make it to order. Because of this, it can hold up the meal, which the server will generally alert you about. My friend loves the fried colossal shrimp, which is awesome and also $$$. I generally get the cod, which is good. I doubt any of the fish is fresh, but perhaps on the weekends, it is. \n\nAll meals come with a salad. Get the blue cheese dressing. You can also add blue cheese crumbles. \n\nIf you love fantastic service and Wisconsin kitsch, this is a great joint. Don't expect five-star food, despite the five-star reviews.

When it came time to escape Ohio, initially with a very good friend who wanted to move to Tucson to acclimate us to city life (I was raised in a village of 500+- people, including the rural setting of my parents) and within five years move to Phoenix, just so we didn't suffer culture shock. Remember, I'd only been in Phx for 3 days up to that point in my life, with neither friend nor family binding me to Arizona. However, he decided the week before our departure date that he wasn't ready to move so far away from family. I, however, had turned in my month's notice to both my full-time job as a journalist and part-time job at Wal-Mart (don't judge me! The employee discount was worth it) so had to make a decision: Tucson or Phoenix. It was during the final minutes, literally, that I mapped out my trip to Phoenix. See, my dad's a truck driver and I have some of his ability to navigate through cities and states using this amazing invention called an atlas. Thanks to Grandma O'Neill, I had such a magical device in my possession, and wrote out in a matter of minutes the best route to drive my Kia Sportage and U-haul trailer from Northwest Ohio to Central Arizona, avoiding toll roads and steep inclines. Unfortunately, I had to drive through the panhandle of Texas, where I almost decided I'd had enough and was going to return to Ohio. But, I drove on. And on, and on... \n\nWhat this has to do with Pizza Heaven is simply background information. After 2.5 days of driving and sleeping in a truck stop one night, I was ready to settle in and have a filling meal. A pizza, actually. And something that would inaugurate my coming to a new home: Mexican Pizza. Refried bean and cheese and green onions...it's a shame I couldn't find it on their menu after returning a year later. But, PH managed to offer specialty pizzas that filled that void (almost :( ) and has been a stand-by for several events at a friend's house. [My friend's house is outside their delivery range and we gladly pay the extra fee, which says a lot.] \n\nAlthough I've only eaten inside the restaurant twice, and must agree that service tended to be on the slower side, this did allow our groups to mingle more and enjoy the pizza and wine at our leisure. \n\nThanks for the memories, Pizza Heaven.

We were disappointed Cafe Monarch was closed for the summer and we were looking for somewhere that was BYO because we were hauling around our wine. Viola! Coup de Tartes! \n\nWe all share so we can try a bit of everything (we do this pretty much everywhere) and we started with the goat cheese on toast and the onion tart. Both came with salads that were nicely dressed in vinaigrette's. Both appetizers were good, though the onion tart outshined the goat cheese. The tart was creamy, oniony and delicious. Everything we could hope for. Everyone enjoyed it. The goat on toast was exactly that:  Cheese on toast. It tasted good because I like goat cheese so much and it reminded me I needed to pick more up at the grocery store, but it really was nothing exciting. In fact, it's getting by far too much face time now. \n\nFor the entree we kept it light to save plenty of room for dessert. We shared the seafood salad and the ham and brie sandwich. The sandwich was just ham and brie on an average baguette. Like something you'd pick up at Safeway. The baguettes at Lee's Sandwiches are much better and the ham on the sandwich was the processed stuck-together loaf kind (like the Oscar Meyer packaged type). I've had by far better ham and brie sandwiches for two euros in the metro stations in France. Granted, that was in France but you get my drift. Clearly, we should have gone with the lamb sandwich. The salad was loaded with seafood and the dressing was fine but it didn't make me want to lick my plate and that's what I was looking for. Enough said. \n\nNext course, dessert. We ordered their seasonal tart, the smores, the \"famous\" bananas foster brulee and the one I was looking most forward to, the dark chocolate salted caramel. First the salted caramel tart.. I had a fellow dark chocolate salted caramel lover at the table so we both dug right in and we were equally disappointed. It miraculously tasted nothing like chocolate, caramel or salt. Just sweet goo. I don't think we even finished it. The banana brulee tart was good, though not as good as I remembered it. The hi-light of dessert, surprisingly, was the smores. I was a little jaded because it came with milk chocolate (I'm a die hard dark chocolate lover and you know what they say, one you go... nevermind) but damn, that thing was good. A little graham cracker crust filled with creamy milk chocolate and topped with a toasted marshmallow. That plate deserved to get licked! \n\nI had been here once before a few years ago for dinner and I was disappointed that the lunch menu only had sandwiches and salads on it. I understand the need to keep it simple and quick, but not even a single entree? Nothing was bad but aside from the onion tart and the smores tart, nothing was a standout. I was just a little disappointed.", "business_id": "LzpR_jE6VIutJ08s2cdRrw", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-07-21", "type": "review"}

I love places like this.  Coup des Tartes is a little old house that has been renovated into a cozy quaint restaurant.  The original rooms and walls are still there and it is just so neat inside.  As some have posted, it can be a bit cramped at times but we don't mind, I love this place that much.\n\nThe menu changes seasonally as they use produce from McClendon's farms and you will find items that are in season.  We have had many items and what I like best is how the items are prepared, different than what you would expect with sauces, seasonings or preparations that I've never tried before and they are all amazing.  I love the escargot, my husband loves the stuffed calamari, we have had salmon, pork, filet... mashed potatoes, roasted potatoes, green beans, asparagus...  And so many delicious desserts.\n\nThey serve water in these cool rustic bottles and leave it at your table to pour yourself.  I love it, maybe I just love the cute bottles so much.  The cool thing about this place is you bring your own bottle of wine, and cork and pour yourself.  There is a corking fee, but that's normal for BYOB restaurants.  If you bring white wine or champagne, they will bring out an bucket with ice/water for you to keep your bottle chilled.\n\nThe owner runs his butt off and is there most nights and will always make you feel special.  The service is impeccable and the food is unbelievable.  One of my all time favorite places to eat in Phoenix.\n\nWe usually only go nowadays when there is a Groupon or it's Restaurant Week.  Just remember as with any Groupon, don't wait until the last minute to book your reservation or try to eat there.  You've got plenty of time so use them early and beat the crowd.

Well,  everything except for the staff who may as well change every other week explaining a lot about the service or lack thereof.\n\nMoto is run by both pretentious and puerile people who make the tragic mistake of thinking that they are either clever or fun. They are neither. Their menu is only half as ridiculous as their thinly veiled tantrums between employees about customers and co-workers. Well, depending on which menu you get, because a lot of their best puerile antics are in the phenomenally stupid act of hiding their food from their customers. \n\nNo joke, any one menu you see is incomplete because you have to get their \"secret\" menus to see what they really have. Often these same menus are woefully inaccurate anyway making any one menu pretty useless overall. You may as well cross your fingers when you order. My eyes rolled so hard they nearly popped out of my head when the staff explained this fun gimmick to me.\n\nThey burn through waiting staff like the place has a revolving door, so an all-too frequent sight is a woman sobbing her eyes out just outside the building because she got fired. Sometimes, if you're lucky, the boss will be out hollering at them making it even more attractive. Yeah, I want to eat THERE; where the women cry.\n\nFor the record, these guys bought a closed Japanese fast food restaurant (Formerly a Shogun Express), peeled off all the surfaces and then painted bricks red as they broke the lights making it incredibly dim to give it that east coast \"this place is condemned, but eat here anyway\" sort of look and feel. \n\nYou know what they say about eating in a low-lit environment, right? The prices are roughly on par with the vastly superior RA Sushi restaurant, but because they're both pretentious and puerile they will arbitrarily decide to tack on gratuity at a whim as well as various \"taxes\" to punish customers. \n\nI'm not kidding. I observed a guy who got hit with a \"Geek Tax\" for bringing in his child holding a McDonald's cup, he was less than happy for the remarkle expense for a bowl of Chicken. I asked about it later and they explained that they fine people for various reasons and sneak it onto their bills.\n\nIt's not a great place to spend time, but since you'll be waiting FOREVER for food or drink refills anyway, you'll also come to embrace the ugly, uncomfortable furniture, which is meant to compel you to leave. So it's ironic that everything takes so long.\n\nThe food is schizophrenic in its spastic variety and its minuscule sushi portions and variety (and stupid list of in-restaurant rules) are pathetic. The management is barking mad, the servers can't juggle tables and the prices are as reliable as the unreliable menus.\n\nIf you MUST try this place, try to do the take-out service if possible. It's the only way not to be disappointed. Eat in at your own risk.

The Chimi was a bit smaller than it looked on the add and what I am used to seeing at other places(probably about the size of three tacquitos rolled together), but well worth five bucks.  Still I am not a fan of deception, speaking of which when I ordered I was asked if I wanted Sour Cream and Guacamole, which I thought was an offer not an upsell.  It ended up coming up to $2.25 together, nice job bumping up my bill by 50%.  Overall though I would return and just avoid the upsells.  The food is good, not great, but you will not find a whole lot better for $4.99.", "business_id": "ib-y5nsfn3unE0lLY1vfAw", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-06-06", "type": "review"}

I dunno...it was real difficult to get a feel for the place.  It was all pretty random to me.  But anyway, about the food....\n\nI ordered \"The Duckling\" sandwich was is one of their \"signature sandwiches\".  It seemed like a good selection because the name of the sandwich and the sandwich itself had duck in it and so does the name of the restaurant.  However, the sandwich was just ok.  Nothing special.  Not worth 9 bucks.  just a few slices of meat in between 2 pieces of bread.\n\nAll the sandwiches on the menu did however look interesting.  They are definitely not your typical \"sandwich place\" type sandwiches.  Well some of them are but they all have that special Duck & Decanter twist.  The have some deli type sandwich selections as well but I would prefer to just go to a deli for those.\n\nMy wife ordered the chicken salad and it was very very good.  I would order it if I ever visit the place again.  She ordered the Sonoran with spicy oil & vinegar.  It was very tasty and no mayo or any of the bad stuff.\n\nThe service was very friendly but I took a long while to get our sandwiches.  There must have been a large order ahead of us or something because there weren't many people in the place.

I had the breakfast burrito with egg, cheddar chz and black forest bacon for breakfast one morning. It was pretty good. Adding their salsa is really what increased the flavor and brought it up a notch. \n\nOn another day, we stopped in for lunch and had the marinated roasted chicken sandwich on sourdough bread. This was a game changer. The fresh, delicious roasted chicken was so good. It tasted like something your mom would make for you if she really loved you. Yeah, that's right mom, I'm calling you out. This is the sandwich I needed growing up. Not bologna and processed cheese. We can still salvage this relationship. Balls in your court lady. \n\nThe food here was great but they're also a specialty store. They have an assortment of greatness throughout. Barrels of coffee beans, containers of different teas, wine, cheeses, beer, different kinds of oils, all kinds of stuff. \n\nThere's seating all over, including outside, but I chose the upstairs loft both times.

There must be some crazy ventilation - I don't care how but I love it.

Their eggplant parm is fantastic -- thinly sliced, breaded, and served on top of a bed of homemade penne pasta. (All of their pasta is homemade in fact)  Their bread was also very good.  It quickly became one of our favorite regular restaurants.  \n\nI loved their eggplant parm so much that it was difficult to stray away from it and try other items on the menu.  When I finally did though, it was equally delicious.  It was penne and parmesan dish with asparagus and red chili flakes.   I highly recommend it. \nMy girlfriend loves the lasagne.  The pear salad also is very tasty appetizer.\n\nThe waitress Cindi is great.  She always remembers us and treats us likely regular weekly customers even though we only make it over to that neighborhood every couple of months or so.  We really could not ask for more personable service.  The owner is nice as well.\n\nThey now have a lot of pictures up from the Triple D visit, but they were very excited about it.  It was a big deal to them and I don't think that should be a knock against them. (Personally, I did not know who the guy was...old school, no cable)  As for the price and food portions, I think that iGiuseppe's is both fair and filling.  We always leave there filled. (Eat more bread or try the pear salad if you are really hungry) As for the price, most plates are between $10 and $14.  For 2 1/2 people (one four year old), we usually wind up spending between $45 and $55, which includes a healthy tip.

They also use a small flat plate with the sauce on the side which kills the glamour of this dish (from my point of view).\n\nThe 7oz filet that I ordered was cooked the way I ordered, so that gives this place the 3rd star. \n\nI didn't pay so I'm not sure about the ratio price-quality.\n\nIt's OK if you're in the area but nothing to remember.\n\nCheers.", "business_id": "bewtZL-VV1oeGUdAhHVz6Q", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-08-23", "type": "review"}

Away from the busy main street and all the other loud obnoxious restaurants (people) Scottsdale is filled with.  \n\nThere is one woman in particular who works here who is an absolute rock star. She's younger and every time I'v interacted with her my experience has been amazing. She is kind, patient, and once even delivered my lunch order to my past work space near by. Its a local and family run business which i love to support! Although the man and older woman who work there haven't given me the best service when I've gone in. The woman talked on the phone the entire time she was helping me and I almost felt rushed by her to make a decision with my order making me feel like her phone call was much more important than a paying customer. Not so cool.\n\nAnything you order from Au Petit Four will be delicious. Whether is a beverage, a pastry, or a meal, you'll be happy. The prices are pretty steep for consistent lunch visits but every once in a while you can stop in here. Average spending amount on lunch will be around $15 after tip. One time i ordered a fruit tart and a small soy latte and I still spent $11. I thought that was pretty price BUT they make everything fresh and there is something to be said about that. \n\nThey do have a half sandwich/half salad lunch option for $7 but prepare to spend $9 or $10 after tip. Its a decent sized lunch for the most but men, you may need something bigger! The goat cheese panini is ridiculously good and their lattes are super yummy. I love that they add a fresh green (no iceberg!) salad with their panini's and that its a lemon olive oil dressing on the side. \n\nI adore the idea of supporting this place, so here's to the young woman who kills it in the service department! and to all the fresh delicious food!", "business_id": "wftoNIA0Q8nX-Da47psBCA", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-06-11", "type": "review"}

Primarily due to the better Yelp reviews preceding this one. But now I'm sure. The food's not bad, but it's not that good, either - and overpriced for what it is, which is pretty standard breakfast fare. Service was dismal both trips. Barely got greeted, then long waits between waitress visits before she disappeared completely. I like the d\u00e9cor - it's a neat little place with cool artwork, but it's not enough to make up for the service (or lack thereof) and the overpriced food. Until I find a better place in my hood I'll stick to Acacia Cafe, which is just the opposite really - no atmosphere, but better food at a better price and friendly service - which are more important in my book. Oh, and what's with the charge for splitting a meal? My date and I often share a dish - we would have been happy to eat off the same plate, but we weren't even given the option, just charged 2 bucks for somebody to cut our omelet in half.

Well, it's been more than a few years and the only 10k's I'm logging now are steps on my Fitbit. I've changed, but the Golden Coin has remained the same.\n\nAll you can eat for just $6.15, including tax. Drinks are extra, but most folks on this day were just drinking water. The food is fine, all things considered, even including fried chicken in addition to the egg rolls, fried rice, sweet & sour, chow mien... you'd expect. The mixed veggies, heavy on broccoli, are actually quite good.\n\nTo be so cheap, some compromises are no doubt made in the kitchen. There was also duct tape holding the front door handle together this day. Tables are well worn... But the restaurant seems busy and the patrons happy and satisfied. As long as you have appropriate expectations, the Golden Coin remains a pretty good choice for those with a craving for basic Chinese in quantity.\n\nNote that this is a CASH ONLY business.

A small cheese, olive and salami plate arrived first, compliments of the Chef.  Scott then proceeded to send over dish after dish of amazing Italian classics , like the large, single handmade ravioli stuffed with ricotta and spinach bathed in an almost invisible butter sauce.  There was also some unexpected delights like the polenta strips topped with a chunky portobello reduction and the perfectly portioned filet mignon.  Each was delightfully different and kept our pallettes busy with incredible flavors and textures.\n\nWine pairings were also carefully selected and added that supreme finish to each plate. The tasting menu with pairings are always different, so you can simply come in sit down and relax and be taken care of. No regretful commitments to be made.\n\nAfter four courses, with 3 wine pairings we were quite content to fold up our napkins and call it quits, but there was still more!  Scott finished us off with a beautiful Tiramisu accompanied with freshly whipped cream that was ablaze and courted with artfully sliced strawberries.  The Tiramisu was light, airy and delicately creamy.\n\nLive music on Saturday nights differs from week to week from opera to jazz to Sinatra.

Based on it's location, it seemed like it might be less pretentious than some of it's other centrally-located peers.  After several visits, I am glad to give it five stars for being one of my favorite coffee shops in the Phoenix area.\n\nOn my first visit here, I immediately noticed two things: 1) the roasting equipment and raw beans displayed prominently, indicating that they did indeed roast their own beans and 2) the prices, which are lower than the average coffee shop (I'm thinking Starbucks, which came to prominence with a reputation for high prices but has really fallen into the middle of the pack compared with the better local places that have cropped up) and far lower than most gourmet shops.  True, you're not getting a pour over for each cup, but you know that it was freshly roasted (and ground) and it's less than $2 a cup.  The beans are the real deal, though: $10.95/lb for freshly roasted, delicious coffee beans?  I know some good places for coffee but none of them can even touch that price, most hovering closer to $15/16 per lb.\n\nAlthough I usually go for regular coffee when exploring a new place, I decided to get a latte on that first trip visit, which did not disappoint - good smooth espresso flavor and the right ratio of milk for me.  The next time that I stopped in, I asked a few questions about the beans and bought a cup of coffee.  After some debate, I went with their Bold roast, which I later found out is also their espresso roast.  While it makes for a good espresso, I found it fairly light for a \"bold\" cup of coffee, and after adding just a splash of cream it tasted somewhat watered down.  In the future I'd probably go with one of their other roasts, particularly the Double French.  This is a mix between their dark Sumatra roast and Tanzanian peaberry.  I was a little concerned when I purchased it, as the barista told me to \"wait for the oils to come out on the beans.\" Though I don't know a ton about coffee, one of the things I thought I knew was that oily beans = ruined beans, but after making it at home on a French press, it quickly entered my upper echelon of coffees.  I also picked up some single source Guatemalan while I was there, a brighter and somewhat less flavorful roast, but still excellent.\n\nCompared to many of the other places in town, this place is perhaps a bit dumpy, but it's got good character and the baristas are super friendly and helpful.  They display art in the store and even have a special night for it each month (Second Saturdays?)  It's also very quiet and has outdoor tables, so I could imagine getting some work done there unlike more popular and louder shops.  I'll definitely be getting beans and drinks from this place in the future.", "business_id": "4eFIVmbeCvJGCrhzmd-VYA", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-08-02", "type": "review"}

I was happy to see that not much had changed, and the sushi was as delicious as ever! I was, however, disappointed in the available sushi lunch specials--I was so spoiled in NYC with all of the cheap sushi lunch spots everywhere! \n\nThe lunch menu here is seriously lacking in sushi, so I opted for a bento box which was huge (and cost about $13). I liked just about everything involved, and you get choices for each section of the box. You do get sushi with the bento box, but the selection is limited-either one roll (I got the spicy tuna, which actually had a lot more to it than just tuna-yum!) or two pieces of nigiri. \n\nI also got teriyaki chicken, which was good but did not come with any rice...that was a bit unexpected, but because there's so much food in the bento box I didn't miss it. My friend ordered a side of it to go with hers and I don't think they charged us for it. For the \"salad\" option you can choose from sumunomo (probably butchered the spelling on that), turkey salad (sounds random but is actually really good), or seaweed salad (which I ordered). Seaweed was fresh and tasty, and the portion was definitely decent.\n\nYou can choose between shumai (shrimp dumplings), gyoza (pork dumplings) or something else that sounded calorie-bombish (I wanna say it was fried cheese? I didn't order it either way). My friend and I were steering clear of fried food so we got the shumai, which ended up being quite fried indeed!

It's very close to our home and I was hopeful to find some good pizza.  During my first experience a cute young girl was our server.  She was the only server for a whole restaurant full of people and she was also the counter person that took the order.  She was nice and friendly, but our service wasn't fabulous because one person can only do so much for an entire restaurant full of people.  From the point we received our food she came back only at the end to give us a box and I had to go up to the counter to pay our check because we had somewhere we needed to be.  I thought maybe someone had called out sick or something.  The pizza was thin, cheesy, and greasy.  It was good,  but it didn't wow me.\nWe decided to give it another chance, so we went back.  This time we had white pizza and a sausage roll.  Our waitress was the same girl.  The service situation was the same which leads me to believe that they just don't have enough people scheduled to work ever.  The girl who works there is nice and friendly and I saw her and the other 2 kitchen employees that were there running around and doing their best.  I felt bad for them because I've worked in numerous restaurants over the years and I felt like they were set up to fail.  The sausage roll came out 10 minutes before my pizza did.  It's always awkward when you go out to eat and one person is completely finished with their food before the other even receives their.  The sausage roll was the poorest excuse for a sausage roll I've ever seen.  It was doughy and not very flavorful.  If you decide to try this place stick to pizza with marinara sauce. The white pizza was bland and also not very flavorful.  If you decide to try this place stick to pizza with marinara sauce. I would have liked to have had some red pepper to pizazz it up, but our server was unable to come back and check on us because she was too busy.  Also I overheard at least 2 sets of customers that came in to order pizza and ended up leaving because they were told the wait was very long.  I applaud her for letting them know about the long wait up front because that's the right thing to do.  However, I feel like the management needs to hire some more employees because you should never be turning away people because you're too busy.

My order was a pretty simple humboldt, but you need to remove that lettuce to enjoy the sandwich better. This chain used to let you add ingredients as you go down the line (after toasting), but now it;s whatever is on the menu you get.

First of all the only reason we tried this place is the fact that there are so many great reviews. This is absolutely the strongest evidence against the corruption that yelp has been accused of. These reviews have to be a complete farce or I'm surround by a ton of fully mentally challenged foodies. When we first walked in we knew something was off by the smell of the place. It has that same dirty smell that most asian supermarkets have. Everyone was completely rude to us and once they saw us the woman working the register actually took the menu out of the bag, almost hinting that they didn't want us ordering from them again. As terrible as the service was the food was one hundred times worse. So bad that not only did we get the worst food poisoning ever but we couldn't even eat more than a couple bites of the entrees. This place deserves to be shut down and placed on some sort of quarantine by the government.

Unfortunately, this one is closest to my home and I had a one star meal yesterday 07/25/14.  Let me say, that I usually go here with a crowd. Yesterday, I had lunch, just me, after a business meeting...I took myself out. Was starving, in a great mood, and wanted Steak and Lobster. \n\nI sat in a bar booth. My waiter was an older woman with short white hair who tried to rush me, was prickly and EXTREMELY unfriendly and in a big rush. I was her only table and she was walking away while she asked what do I want to drink. She never brought my water  She threw my salad in the bowl to serve it to me. Everyone else (in other sections with different wait staff)  received normal looking salads, but whatever. I asked for dressing on the side..and it came on top.  The AWFUL waitress surely was responsible. \n\nIt took 1/2 hour to get my meal after I noticed waiting after I just pecked at that boring salad. Then a table of three men came in and she was sweet to them, friendly and said \"thank you\" Worst wait staff experience. I only left a tip because I know bus people need it. too. \n\nSo the FOOD was only acceptable and NOT normal yummy-like Outback.  The steak was cooked properly, but tough and nowhere NEAR the flavorful steaks this chain really puts out.  The very small  lobster tail (I ordered steamed) was about  30 seconds under-cooked, but I ate it and it was tasty.  I had asked my waiter for my potato dressings on the side, but alas it was on top already, again what would she care?\n\nSo all this for my \"atta-girl-treat yourself  special lunch for $35. Previously,about 3 months ago I was there and  they had to re-fire my steak TWICE to get it to medium-rare.  However, the staff has always been -except for this little lunch of mine--usually very nice.  I mean why else would I stop in if I wasn't usually comfy there.  After the last few meals, just in the \"meh-had better\" range, considering the price, and now the hiring of a nasty white haired witch server?    I'm done with this location.

Who needs to clean the house, get caught up on bills, wash the cars, and eat leftovers at home?  Let's go drive around aimlessly.\"  He's such a good sport and always ready to head out on one of my escapades, so we took off towards Casa Grande.  There are moments I fantasize about getting out of the city and finding a more rural abode.  Those moments usually pass when I start looking at concerts and baseball games.  But still, wouldn't it be nice to have no neighbors, a couple of horses in the backyard, and 4 or 5 big dogs?  I think so.  \n\nSomeone had told me about some acreages out on the northwest side of C.G. so that's kind of where we were headed.  The drive wasn't very productive on the house-hunting side, but we did end up at Dell's for lunch.\n\nI wasn't too sure about it because from the outside it looks kind of suspect, but inside, it's a cool little sports bar.  Lots of TVs on the walls, and right away the server said he would change any channel to whatever we wanted.  If the Cardinals aren't playing baseball we're pretty apathetic.  I think we ended up watching drag racing or something, which always makes me want to drive irresponsibly.  And run out and buy a Camaro.  \n\nWe had their honey BBQ wings, which were very good, and the medium Chad's special pizza which basically has all the meats on it.  I have pictures somewhere and will get them uploaded when I find them.  Overall we really enjoyed our lunch.  Our server, JWF on the receipt, was great, and the food was very good.  The pizza is a thin crust style and baked golden brown on the bottom with lots of toppings and chewy cheese.   \n\nWith 1 pint of Amber Bock $2.77, 2 pints of Kiltlifter $7.38, wings $7.60, and the pizza $13.45, lunch was $33.85 after tax, before tip.

Really, can't even go as far as to set the bowl in from of me huh? Maybe you should talk to your waitresses about at the very least trying. I asked for change, that ticked her off. I still tipped her $3 on a $6.46 bill. I will be back, I just hope this reaches someone who cares. This was uncalled for.. Now that I have read more reviews, it seems I'm not the only one getting bad service. Most of the more recent reviews have complained about the same thing! There are plenty of restaurants in that area that make the same food you do.. In that General area even. Better step up your game or I, as well as other loyal customers will venture down the street.", "business_id": "jJlOPkv4Xl6vxNzr51fnYw", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-08-15", "type": "review"}

You know in E.T. when they go out, how dated and weirdly old timey everything looks? That's how this place looks. Certainly not a place to go when you have to impress someone, as it is clearly meant to be a comfy family-style restaurant. \n\nBut I am a family style kind of gal so this place was right up my alley. The food is tasty, plentiful and affordable. We had the greek salad, large pizza with green peppers, and manicotti with meat sauce. The greek salad was your standard greek salad, kind of overpriced for how much you got and I would likely pass on salad next time. The pizza was huge and delicious though, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that instead of little strips of green bell pepper, they finely diced the peppers so you get pepper in every bite. A slightly floppy, awesome NY style pizza. The manicotti was very rich and heavy and far too much for one person to eat on their own - I should have known better, considering it was stuffed to the gills with an awesome cheese mixture. The meat sauce was flavorful and had a bright tomato and fennel taste. \n\nService is fast and efficient (though leaning on the perfunctory side). The restaurant is clean with a dive-y kind of atmosphere, but I wouldn't have it any other way.

The classic diner checklist is pretty full with this one.\n\nI've eaten breakfast and lunch at Chase's. Let me give a quick review of the plates I ordered. The egg salad was fresh, with just enough mayo and placed atop toasted bread of your choosing. The side options were plentiful but I stayed with french fries. The grease-o-meter reading was relatively low with this order. For breakfast I stick with the 2-egg meat combo. So 2 scrambled eggs, hash browns, bacon and toasted rye. Greasy town! The bacon was literally dripping with diner grease- stuck some napkins on there to soak it up! Order lots of water with this meal- may save your tummy from a future disaster.\n\nCome here for the atmosphere and friendly people.

The traditional red salsa, a sour cream and jalapeno dip, a bean dip with bits of chorizo in it, and a spicy green salsa that had tons of flavor!!

My server told me that they have a tortilla factory in New Mexico and they get the tortillas fresh a couple of times a week to make their own chips.  YUM!!!  They have a lunch special every day and my day was Sopapillas.  They give you a choice of red or green sauce, I chose red cause, yes, I am a wimp.  I can't take a lot of heat.  It was yummy and saucy.  The plate came with two delicious sopapillas filled with ground beef and generous portions of rice and beans.  My only complaint was the filling.....it needed something, maybe some green chiles or some other thing to spice it up just a bit.  They were good, just a bit bland.  The rice and beans were great!  The rice was nice and fluffy and the beans were topped with lots of cheese.  And the other amazing part was that they give you a sopapilla for dessert too!!

I didn't bother looking at the reviews before I went-I was just following my aunt's suggestion so we made plans as a family (with my parents in town) to eat there. I looked at the menu and was 'thrilled' to find a vegetarian section, and the family didn't consciously find a restaurant that is vegetarian-friendly for me (talk about jewish guilt trip). So I went with much anticipation (a sad symptom of vegetarianism in a meat-eating world when you discover that a restaurant has a vegetarian dish and are quick to assume that the dish will be DELICIOUS. It sucks that you're not able to choose from a variety of selections, but Not ALL vegetarian dishes are delicious. I'm working on this. Smile). Well, the dishes didn't BLOW me away-it was  *half-smirk* eatable. I ordered a hot and sour soup with tofu (Tom Yum), which was good. Then I ate Tofu Coconut Princess with #2 spicy (they have a 5-rating spice scale), and it WAS not spicy at all (and my aunt warned that #2 is VERY spicy), and the tofu was overcooked. Lucikly, the coconut was able to compensate for that. I brought home the leftover for my boyfriend, and he has a very critical palate since he's a cook-he wasn't impressed with it. The dishes are OVER-PRICED for what they're worth if I had to pay (my dad had to foot the bill for a party of 6).\n\nI'm a bit surprised of the awards they've received-what was the criterion? Is a vegetarian on the committee of \"Best of Phoenix\"? That's what I would like to know.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this place to anyone who has high expectations of food.", "business_id": "vtQOervVVTXjhvSZQiZ6PA", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-08-17", "type": "review"}
