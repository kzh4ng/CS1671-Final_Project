While changing my clothes I heard a mans voice.\n\nI frantically search for a way to lock the door, but there is not lock! The door flies open! There is a man standing there looking me up & down, smiling at me! I was trying on dresses so I was completely undressed. I went into shock, screaming you can be in here!!

I attended the dinner with three friends, one of whom happens to be a professional fisherman from Alaska. He fishes primarily for cod and salmon, and supplies several very well known restaurants with his bounty. His fish is top notch and without compare - truly great stuff. \n\nHe wanted to try Wilson's, as he doesn't supply them with fish and is always looking for opportunities to expand his distribution footprint in and around the area.\n\n+ Huge space. Shockingly huge - rectangular in shape, the building is at least 4-5 times deeper than it is wide. \n+ Bar runs the entire length of the building\n+ Nice selection of taps and bottles available\n+ Was quite surprised to find Abita Strawberry on tap\n\n+ Tons of televisions; our high-top had its own TV\n- Very noisy due to all of the televisions going\n\n- All tables were dirty; staff wasn't too good about wiping down after people left\n- Our server was quite gruff, not terribly helpful, largely absent, and forgot to bring refills of drinks and waters\n\nSo... all of that stuff aside, let's talk about the fish.\n\nTwo options for fish: 3-piece or 5-piece deep-fried cod. No baked cod, and no other fish varietals. \n\n+ The cooking area is in plain view of the entire restaurant\n- You'll leave smelling like a deep fryer\n- We watched as our fries sat and languished on plates for a good 5+ minutes while the fish cooked\n- We watched as our completed plates loitered in the cooking area for another 5+ minutes after the fish was done; our server was busy running around helping other tables while the fish sat...and sat... and sat... \n- Before we were finished eating, our cranky server began clearing a space directly behind us so that they could set-up for karaoke. That's all well and good, but the guy kept bumping stuff into us (the bar stools don't have backs)... he was like a bull in a china shop.\n\n+ Batter on the cod was delicious, if not quite salty. Violet L is a salt fan, and she even commented that it was overly salty\n- The cod itself was dry, slightly chewy, and meh. My fisherman friend said it was \"jerky-like.\" He was, however, quite impressed (as were all of us) by how well the batter clung to the cod. The two components were very well bonded.\n- I thought the batter had a taste similar to KFC's original coating - salty with a bit of pepper. I suspect that those who truly enjoy this fish fry are mostly in love with the batter.\n\nI didn't try the slaw; the roll was your typical cafeteria-style white bread roll.\n\n+ Inexpensive; four of the 3-piece cod dinners with a round of drinks was $34.\n\nI'm not sure why Madison Fish Fry likes this place so much. Perhaps we got a bad round of cod, along with bad service. Fish that sits after being cooked never bodes well... and while I believe in second chances, the overall experience left me quite sour, so it may be difficult to return in a timely manner.", "business_id": "zAsxPh3h9xMQnSDGl41kSg", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-05-05", "type": "review"}

But in the last few years, other venues in Madison have really stepped up their game, and the Barrymore doesn't seem to care about keeping up with its contemporaries.\n\nIts use of social media is near-archaic. The venue doesn't make an effort to create or even update pages for individual events, and good luck if you get any indication that a show is on track to sell out. And perhaps it's just my personal taste, but the Barrymore used to bring in excellent music acts on a much more regular basis. Now it just caters to the aging-hippie population of the neighborhood, preferring to fill its schedule with predictable offerings about far-left-leaning politics. These events don't offend my own political views, but they're often dull and serve as nothing more than an echo chamber for people who want their beliefs perpetually reaffirmed. They sell more tickets that way, so I'm not sure I can blame them for the strategy, but  I hardly ever like the shows there. Also, the tickets are 2-3 times more expensive than the tickets usually are at other live entertainment venues in town.\n\nThe building itself isn't falling into disrepair, like the Orpheum is (heartbreakingly, I might add), but areas of infrastructure could certainly benefit from attention. There is no public WiFi, and you'll be hard-pressed to get cell phone reception, even in the balcony. I do appreciate that the open dance area is slanted a bit so that we vertically-challenged folks have a chance to see, but if you want to be able to sit and see the acts, the balcony is your best bet. It's not often open, however, especially for shows that haven't sold a ton of tickets. I don't recall this being a problem at prior events, but at the show I attended last night, there were constant problems with microphone feedback, often necessitating acrobatics by the band itself. The tap beer selection is good, but that's pretty standard in this town. Bottled beer selection pales in comparison to other venues, and the liquor and wine options are slim pickings. The bar is cash-only. The only ATM in the place charges a $4 fee for each use, so if you need to withdraw cash, make sure to get enough in one go. The line can be enormous, and often is bisected by people exiting and entering the theater. The bathrooms are fairly clean and well-stocked, although I've used them on more than one occasion to discover that they were out of soap, necessitating the use of their hand sanitizer instead.  Also, the saloon-style doors are an easy way to get smacked in the face entering and exiting the bathroom, so exercise plenty of caution around them. The bathrooms are so tiny that the lines are formed outside the doors. They also don't sell earplugs, so make sure you bring your own.\n\nBottom line: in the rare event that they have a show I want to see, I'll go, but I make sure to bring plenty of cash, my own earplugs, and my plastic Barrymore cups (drinks are 50 cents cheaper when you remember to bring your cups back).", "business_id": "f5ntGOT9_0pCdeUaUVi9cg", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-03-29", "type": "review"}

They do fish so well but their shrimp was over breaded popcorn shrimp that did not have that country specialness that you expect from CB.  The hushpuppies were also dry and flavorless.)   I have had very good trout and also a very well done steak.   It fits into a narrow country recipe selection but when you are in the mood for that you can't beat the price and the quality of food.  Service has always been good, the environment is pleasant and there is plenty of room.  The bathrooms are very clean.  The gift shop has something for everyone.  We almost always find something and they don't particularly cater to out taste.   In the midst of country craft, bible baubles and kitchen kitch (is there such a thing?)  we have found some nice decorative items, ornaments, candy, and other gifts.\n\nFound a hair in an egg and they immediately remade the entire meal and the manager came out to speak with us.   Good and appropriate recovery.   My pancakes this time around were not as flavorful as the last.  They were still good. \nOn a cold winter day get a seat near the fireplace and have a nice home cooked meal.  The coffee has always been good too.   It isn't fancy stuff but still good.\n\nFolks here are almost always very pleasant and talkative.\n\nUpdate: The French Toast was nothing special.  Third meal I have had here that I didn't care for much.  Avoid it.  Ham was so-so as was the smoked sausage.  Not a good breakfast for me.   Coffee wasn't good this time either.

I called dispatch again, waited three minutes, and got told that the cab should be there in \"ten minutes.\" Fifteen minutes later, my cab arrived.\n\nIf lateness were the only issue with this cab ride, I would review it as a three and be done with it. However, my cab driver drove recklessly throughout Madison weaving in and out of traffic with little regard for anyone else on the road all while maintaining a speed between 44 and 52 (except at traffic lights or when traffic simply wasn't moving) in areas where the posted speed limit was between 25 and 35mph. \n\nHe rarely used his turn blinkers, except at the exact moment that he chose to change lanes, and this caused him to become visibly frustrated when other drivers could not react in time. Finally, I noticed that he wasn't wearing a seatbelt for the duration of the trip, and that the 'fasten seat belt' indicator light was on. \n\nWhen I arrived at my dealership I asked him if he thought he should use his seatbelt. Then, uttering the first words we exchanged after confirming my destination, he said \"dude, why?\" in a tone of complete contempt. When I went into the dealership to pick up my voucher, they took it out to him for me. I wish I'd thought to get his cab number before leaving. \n\nI won't make the mistake of using Union Cab again.

We knew what we were getting ourselves into, going to an Applebee's and whatnot, but what transpired was so ridiculous, I expected Ashton Kutcher (or at least the host of \"How to Catch a Predator\") to pop out and we all LOL about how horrible the experience was.  Instead, I left the restaurant with an empty feeling in my heart, as a wave of sadness washed over me knowing I had just lost two hours of my life inside a low-rate Applebee's.\n\nWe were first greeted by a host who didn't greet us. He showed us to our table, set down the menus, and sidled back over to the host stand without making a sound.  In fact, I can't be positive he wasn't a ghost sentenced to life in purgatory as an Applebee's host. However I forgot to check if his feet were floating or walking, so we'll never be sure.\n\nThe waitress seemed nice enough, but it soon became evident that this woman was about to have a serious breakdown and that we were about to be her therapists, whether we liked it or not (we didn't).\n\nShe came back with our drinks after a bit of a wait saying, \"it's like pulling teeth to get that bartender to make us drinks, we even have to have the manager back there making them too!\".  Very professional.  As she was taking our order, I asked her if she knew whether or not a particular menu item had red dye, as I have an allergy. She was going to check in the kitchen. \"Be right back!\" she said, and we believed her.  Five minutes later, we see her emerge from the kitchen, taking food out to other tables, filling waters, and taking more drink orders to the surly bartender.  She returned to our table in a huff, her response to my red dye inquiry was severely alarming.  \"The chef says there's no way for us to know if it has dye it in or not.  We'd have to go look it up somewhere, so he said you just shouldn't order it.\"  Now I'm not under any sort of delusion that Applebee's is the kind of restaurant where the produce comes in fresh every morning, and the chefs have been trained in the French Alps.  However, I would expect at least *some* transparency, or you know, maybe just go look it up.  \n\nAs we started to order our food (maybe without red dye, who knows?!), the day started to really fall apart.  First of all they were out of mozzarella sticks.  As we all know, mozzarella sticks are among the top 3 reasons to go to Applebee's, along with $2 long islands and 1/2 priced apps after 10 pm.  The waitress tried to explain to us their newly revamped appetizer menu (albeit without mozzarella sticks) but had no clue what she was talking about.  Somehow she walked away after telling us the particular items we ordered could not come out simultaneously, and whatever was ready first was going to come out.  This came down to me getting my entree before my friends' appetizers came, and my friends' entrees coming out about 45 minutes after everyone else had finished their meal.\n\nThroughout the whole meal, and I use \"meal\" loosely because we had nothing to eat for the majority of the time, we could hear the waitstaff going around to every table apologizing for something.  It was complete disarray.  \"Sorry for the wait, we are so busy!\" (as we're surrounded by empty tables), \"There's a 15 minute wait for drinks, because we only have 1 blender!\" (like, what?)  Not to mention they were spilling drinks, precious 15-minute wait drinks, everywhere.  The manager dumped an smoothie on someone's lap, a waiter spilled a drink all over an empty booth (which the mute host then sat a family at before it was cleaned, and a woman sat directly in the puddle), and another waitress was dribbling Bloody Marys across the restaurant at a rate so fast, you'd have thought it was a scene from Dexter. We were being patient, but other tables weren't as gracious.  One man walked up to the bar to get his table's drinks after they sat untouched for 10 minutes.  That guy was cool: he really tore into the manager for being so unorganized and they had to get another waitress.\n\nWe put in an order for another round of drinks, and hunkered down for the extreme wait that was likely to follow.  10 minutes later (we got lucky!) she came back with one too many margaritas.  \"Oh gosh!  You only ordered two of those right? Oh okay... well, this one is on me!\" which was nice enough, except she went on to complain about what a horrible day she was having, and how her whole life was ruined because another waitress made her switch sections.  \n\nBy the time the final entrees surfaced, we had them boxed up immediately to leave.  It took 30 minutes from the time we asked for the check to the time she brought it out, after being there for 2 hours.  The cherry on top was when she took $3 out of her own tips and laid it on the table for the extra margarita. That had to have been one of the most absurd things I'd ever seen.  Couldn't she just take it off our bill? Like we're really going to take your $3 off the table.\n\nAnyway, food was", "business_id": "JdCFcgw4yk4M1ZRhAhBIag", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-03-02", "type": "review"}

There was an awesome mix of people there, which is always a good sign for me. They had all sorts of games playing on the multiple tvs (not just basketball, hooray!) and my boyfriend was delighted to note that they have shuffleboard.\n\nWe were seated immediately (pretty good for a Friday night) and placed our drink orders. My boyfriend got a Great Lakes Irish Red something or other, and I ordered a Pyramid Winter Ale, which wasn't all that great. I personally wish that they had some more local stuff on the beer menu, but aside from that, I can't really complain about the selection.\n\nFor dinner, I ordered beer battered cod with carrot soup, and my boyfriend ordered a burger with chili garlic fries. Our food was AMAZING. This is hands down the best fish fry I've had outside of da nortwoods, definitely the best I've had in Madison so far. The soup was interesting but delicious - kind of spicy with a hint of cilantro. I didn't try my boyfriend's burger, but the chili garlic fries were awesome. I'm someone who believes that there is no such thing as too much garlic, though, so they might be a bit much for less of a garlic lover.\n\nI am so stoked to have found a great fish fry place so close to our house.

Upon arrival, a housekeeper was notified that the lamp in our room did not work. She replied that she would call downstairs to send someone up. Nobody came.  Four hours later, I found a maintenance worker myself who immediately came to the room and replaced the lamp. There is no fan in the bathroom, but that's not much of an issue because there isn't much steam since the water only gets lukewarm at best. On 4-21-14, at 3:44am I was unpleasantly shocked awake by a very loud alarm somewhere in the hall outside my room. I later found out that it was thought to be due to a dirty smoke detector. That increased my confidence in the overall cleanliness of the facility. On 4-22-14, I was appalled that a housekeeper walked into the room without even knocking. That was very frightening to hear a key card clicking in my door when I didn't have any guests!  There are six pieces of fruit put out on the front desk each morning. If you don't get one of those, you'll have to pay ten dollars for a mediocre breakfast bar. \n\nThis part deserves it's own paragraph.

The air handling is so terrible, I truly cannot warn you enough. I am not able to hold my breath long enough to tolerate the stench. Particularly worrisome is that the stink is worst in a stairwell.

The burgers were only okay. \n\nThe burgers at Eagle Crest are big and meaty. But as you may know, bigger is not necessarily better. These burgers aren't seasoned and are quite bland. A little salt and pepper would help a lot. Also, I'm pretty sure the mushrooms on my Mushroom Swiss burger were canned mushrooms. They were chewy and gross. The burger buns weren't so much toasted as burnt. Crispy chunks of burnt hamburger bun....yummmm. All 3 of us were pretty underwhelmed. I can honestly say that even the last fast food burger I had was better than the one I ate at Eagle Crest.\n\nThe bar itself is a pretty typical Wisconsin dive bar. Nothing fancy, with an interesting crowd. Plenty of televisions and gambling machines. There were only a few others in there around 8 pm on a Sunday. We were repeatedly told that we were lucky that the grill was still on, thanks to some guy who I assume is a regular. So I'm not sure exactly why it took about 20 minutes to cook 3 burgers. I'm also not sure what hours they serve food, so don't drive all the way out there for food if it's too late.\n\nThe sole employee on hand was nice and quite accommodating.

Drinks were cheap (I think my giant mug of Blue Moon was $3.75) and service pretty quick, only delayed when the bartender was stuck grilling. She was always apologetic and sure to let us know that she would be with us in a few, and we were in no rush at all so it wasn't a big deal.\n\nAs several Yelpers have documented, the burgers are huge. Like, almost use the whole package of ground beef for one patty huge. I like my patties thin and won't touch anything that's still pink in the middle, so I opted to skip trying their burgers, as my (probable lack of) enjoyment of them would have little to do with the actual flavor or quality. Their tacos sound legendary though, and I'm not expecting anything fancy - I fully expect to be reminded of what my mom served my brothers and I as children (flour tortilla, ground beef, shredded cheddar, lettuce, tomato, and sour cream, for the record).

I actually had to help some elderly woman carry a bag of peat moss (I think, it was a big heavy bag) to her car as I was leaving because she couldn't find a staff member to help. This is compounded with the fact that it's often not immediately obvious where you are and are not aloud to go.

From the reviews I had read on here, I knew there would be a short wait. I think we waited about 20-30 minutes (which was a little longer than i was expecting). Unfortunately there was no good place to wait either.  We constantly felt we were standing in someone's way. The wait did give us a chance to admire their beautiful looking pies, which we did not have room to try after we had lunch. \nWhen it was our turn, someone called our names over a microphone and then told us  where to go sit. We found our seats and waited for the waiter. There were 3 menus at the table so we were able to start looking through what they had to offer. The waiter came and took our drink order but never brought us a fourth menu. He also never introduced himself. \nAfter looking over the entire menu the only thing that really jumped out at me was their milk shakes and ice creams. Nothing else really jumped out at me and made me think \"Oh wow that is really different and sounds really good?\". I think it is a good basic breakfast place to those who are vegetarians or gluten free! But for the rest of us it isn't anything spectacular. I had an omelette which was fine, though the biscuit that came with it was tasty. My friend had asked the waiter for a refill on his water which never came and my coffee never got refilled until we had finished eating after all the dishes and utensils were taken away so i couldn't stir my cream or sugar. \n\n\nTo sum things up:\nThis place was just an average diner that didn't have a wow factor to anything.\nWould be a good place for those seeking vegetarian/gluten free options and are just wanting  \"normal/ordinary\" breakfast/lunch options.\n\nI would not venture back for a second time.", "business_id": "fjaQ3Ixkofh8xGhklUtDnA", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-03-26", "type": "review"}

Upon arrival we were met by the Inn Keeper, Pat who gave us a warm welcome and brief tour of the gust areas and our room.   The guest area, or as they call it, the \"gathering room\" is very warm & inviting.   Here you can sit to meet with others, read a book, select a wine, or enjoy complementary drinks such as coffee, tea or soda with some light snacks available as well.   The freshly baked cookies are awesome.    There is also a computer to use if you wish and there are several binders and folders with local attractions or restaurants to try out.   \n\nOur room, the \"Madison Lakes\" was outstanding.  Large, and outfitted extremely well. You will not be disappointed.  There is a king sized bed, a gas fireplace, nice sized TV, with good cable channels, or use of a DVD (you can borrow DVD's from the gathering room), free wifi, a small fridge, sink, and two comfortable chairs to melt into.   The bathroom is ginormous, with a large whirlpool tub, a huge walk in shower complete with steam and rainfall shower head, all of it being very nice.   \n\nThe grounds of the Inn is really a small farm, with fruits, veggies & fresh laid eggs that find their way into the ingredients for breakfast.    Around the far there are several trails to use, winding you past the barn, sheep, a lama and various beds for wild flowers, herbs and vegetables.   \n\nAs my wife and I walked the grounds and headed back to the Inn, we passed a good sized gazebo which seemed to beckon us in for a look.  Inside there are a few comfortable chairs, wine cooler,  a DVD player (with aux connections) and some wine glasses just waiting to be used.   We sat in there for a while and we actually had plans on going out on the town.  However, this entire scenery before us was extremely relaxing... the woods, birds singing, farm animals grazing about, all made for an extremely, wonderful  relaxing environment we simply could not walk away from.   So, we concluded our evening by enjoying ourselves in this tranquil environment accompanied with some wine.    Ahhh... a very memorable time which we shall cherish for some time to come.   \n\nAfter a sound sleep and outstanding shower, we headed to breakfast where we dinned with two other couples who clearly were enjoying their stay as well.  The breakfast freshly made by the Inn Keepers, Pat & Bob, is made up of several courses; fruit, scones, beacon and eggs, all of which was eaten with delight and a perfect ending chapter of our stay at the Speckled Hen Inn B&B.  \n\nThe attention given by the Inn Keepers, Pat & Bob is perfect.  They have really taken care of many of your needs in advance simply by setting up the Inn & Grounds really well.  They are both attentive and engaging while at the same time not being overbearing.   They really do have it well balanced!   \n\nObviously, my wife & I will be checking back in here again.  So, if you are looking for a place to get away from to unwind, (which is only a short drive from the Capitol Square) or in need of some quite time, then this is the place for you!   \n\nThanks Speckled Hen, for such a relaxing time and creating some wonderful memories!!!", "business_id": "FrT0OQFkUZBtfoW3V1Wpfw", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-05-20", "type": "review"}

No one has come even close to Bob & Pat's place. My husband constantly says \"every other B&B either does the 'bed' part really well, or the 'breakfast' part really well, but never both.\" Well, The Speckled Hen does everything perfectly. Upon arrival, there are 3 different types of cookies to choose from, different coffees, teas and sodas to grab for the room, and a wine cellar if you want to purchase inexpensive (but yummy) wine. The rooms are all huge with large bathrooms with jacuzzis. We've stayed in the Token Creek and Starkweather rooms - both are beautiful and we love the gas fireplaces to keep us cozy and warm. The location is perfect if you want to get away from the college kids. Its about a 15 minute drive outside of Madison, but secluded on 40+ acres with a full farm with chickens, sheep and Happy (the nicest dog in the world). The breakfasts keep me up at night in anticipation. They are each 3-4 courses of both sweet and savory options. The fresh smoked bacon with homemade maple glaze (Bob taps his own trees to make homemade maple syrup) is outstanding, the scrambled eggs look like simple, nothing fancy eggs, but they have so much flavor! I love the homemade grape sorbet they usually serve at the conclusion of the meal. You cannot go wrong at The Speckled Hen.

For every positive interaction I have, I have two negatives ones.  My husband and I just bought a house, so you can imagine how much time we spend here.  I prefer Home Depot but the prices are so much lower at Menard's.\n\nIn the matter of two weeks, all of this happened:\n\n1. I bought a can of paint for our guest room.  I wanted the best paint, with the primer, all the bells and whistles.  I was covering purple.  I needed it.  The salesperson said I could pick from any four.  Yet, he could not tell me why one was rated higher or called premium over the other.  It was weird.  Like here are your options but I can not tell you what their difference really is.  And some were the same brand.\n\n2. When painting the ceiling of said room, we open up a can of paint and notice it has clumps in it.  This paint was about six months old.  Nothing happened to it.  So we go back to Menard's.  We have shopped at several area Menard's, because we are about convenience.  The lady at the counter was SO rude.  We did not have our receipt and could not find it in their system.  We pay for most things in cash and apparently this is NOT a good idea at Menard's.  It had a Menard's sticker which this location does not use (but other locations still use).  \n\nEVERY time we tried to talk to someone she kept speaking over us and saying this can not be from here.  We then had to repeat AGAIN, that we do not just shop at this location.  We shop outside the city sometimes.  We pick things up on our way home.  \n\nAnother rep interceded and offered to return it for us.  She was SO nice.  I wish I remembered all of their names.  But she needed a person from paint to approve it.\n\nBefore looking at the paint, a rep spoke to this RUDE customer service rep and said he could not take the paint back.  It must be our fault and that is that.  Then they said they could not take and dispose of it.  Nice huh?  No one asked us anything.  The paint was BRAND new!  \n\n3. The same day we went to return the paint, we wanted to look at screen doors.  There was no one in the section and you would have thought we were pulling teeth when we did find someone.  He was SO short with us and kept walking away while we still had questions.  It was ridiculous.  \n\nSo the prices keep us going back but the rest?

Lately, I've only been coming here when I absolutely must; I much prefer going to my local hardware store - their selection for anything that's not a big-ticket item is better, as is the service and overall experience. \n\n- There are signs posted in several places that claim, \"No waiting for savings! If there are more than 2 customers waiting to check-out, we'll open additional check-out lanes!\" -- I have yet to see this happen. A most recent visit left us waiting in line for nearly 10 minutes before checking out.\n\n- The indoor/outdoor lumberyard is a source of frustration. I would venture a guess that one of the more commonly sought items from a hardware store like Menards is the basic 2x4 (or similar dimensional piece of lumber). Any idea where they're located? We wandered the indoor lumberyard for a good 5 minutes before realizing that the 2x4s are located in the faaaaaaaaaar back corner from the main entrance. You have to walk by scores of 1-by-whatevers, fence posts, fence slats, decorative posts, synthetic decking, lattice, and other rarely used items before you get to the 2-by-whatevers. Do you need pressure treated wood? That's outside, somewhere. Do you need cedar? That's on the opposite end of the indoor yard. Do you need plywood? It's at the front of the lumberyard. Do you need insulation? It's in the middle of the lumberyard... catch the problem? There's zero organization/logic...\n\n- The outdoor lumberyard. I hate (as do my contractor friends) checking in and out with the lumberyard guard. Put it all inside like every other store does and call it good.\n\n- Limited supply of plumbing items. I recently needed a Sharkbite connector for a plumbing project I was doing with PEX. Menards didn't have the fittings, but my tiny little local Ace Hardware did. A few days ago, I needed a John Guest fitting, which Menards didn't have, but my local Ace Hardware did. \n\n+ Holiday sales are usually a good deal, especially for large ticket items like ceiling fans and whatnot.", "business_id": "IoPdC59QwkWYm31xPkwcPw", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-05-26", "type": "review"}

By itself, the mousaka would last me two additional meals. We couldn't resist the Boston creme donut, which turned out to be the best I've had in Madison, and a gigantic cinnamon roll fritter. Plus the two coffees, the total came out to be $25 (!!) and some change. \n\nThe service is a relaxed pace, but the owners were charming and seemed to enjoy us enjoying their food.

As several others have pointed out, the decor is nothing to write home about - nor even to dwell on it in a Yelp review, but It has always been my contention that if you offer great food at a fair price and are not offering a dining experience, then restaurant cleanliness and an attentive wait staff is a better investment than wood carvings and mood lighting.\n\nWe came for lunch and it turned out they had a fantastic buffet! Everything from tandoori chicken to palak aloo. Every dish was so flavorful and authentic. Having spent two years overseas where I associated with several Indians, I know they would have been suitably impressed. The waiter brought naan to the table and was there when our water glasses emptied. He didn't hover but he was attentive.\n\nMy lunch partner and I got a kick out of the sign that politely let buffet eaters know we were welcome to the food but would be charged for waste. It should go without saying, but I have been to several all-you-can-eat buffets and have witnessed first hand the amount of leftover food that has to be thrown away because people take too much. Personally I think part of the blame should be placed on the cooks/managers for not putting out a better product, but certainly the customer is largely to blame. Hence, a sign that clearly articulates the Maharaja's expectation of its customers is a good thing. Let's face it, if the food was bad, the customer would be screaming...\n\nBottom line, Eat here if you love Indian food.", "business_id": "jqo3Ljexof9sA8PhSTwEjA", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-05-24", "type": "review"}

When living in Madison years ago, we used to hit all the great fish fries on the lakes around town. And while spending 10 years in Hayward, we used to live for Fridays at Lost Land Lake Lodge and later The Waterfront. Living in Utah for over 20 years, my opportunities are few and far between. So I was excited to have a free Friday in Madison to try the very best. Reading online reviews, going off my past knowledge and talking to friends, I made the tough call between the Avenue Bar (one of my favorite lunch spots) and the Esquire Club. We chose the Esquire.\n\nI hadn't been in the club in probably 30-35 years. Overall, it was a good experience. But it wasn't close to the level to which I'm accustomed to in Hayward on our three or four trips out there a year. We had a great time and I highly recommend it, but we would make another choice next time.\n\nThe bar at Kavanaugh's Esquire Club is great - a full horseshoe with plenty of seating. We arrived around 5:30 p.m. on a Friday in Lent. It was packed already, as was every spot in the parking lot. We put our name in and were told it would be 20 minutes for our party of two. We were seated in just ten.\n\nOne of the challenges with the Esquire is it just doesn't have a lot of natural atmosphere. The main room with the bar is fabulous. But the other dining rooms are really plain with not a single thing on the wall. The table settings are nice. And outside, it's a totally blah building. Out the back door to the parking lot was an attractive collection of a few hundred cigarette butts sitting on the sidewalk and snowbank.\n\nThe tables are pre-set with great, fresh rye bread and fabulous cole slaw. And we had quick attention from our waitress. The host gave us menus - actually three stapled, photocopied sheets - pretty tacky (I noticed others did get regular menus). It's a full supper club menu with multiple choices for fish fry. We opted for the $9.95 all-you-can-eat ocean perch. What was notable to me as that the current Web page for Esquire lists the price at $8.95. Not good. Cod was also available at a slightly higher price.\n\nThe bread and slaw kept us entertained and both were world class. A heaping plate of fish and crinkle fries arrived in good time (beating the Coke our grandson ordered 15 minutes earlier). We had to ask for lemons.\n\nThe fish was very good - I love perch. But as good as it was, it simply wasn't at the presentation and taste level of what we traditionally get at The Waterfront in Hayward, for example. It was a simple cornbread-type breading that was good, but somewhat uninteresting - not the flamboyant texture of the beer battered fish we have grown to expect.\n\nNonetheless, we polished off the fish, got a few more fries and a chocolate mousse desert. The bill for two with a few beers and desert was just under $40.\n\nLater that night, we also hit the Beachhouse in McFarland, another popular local spot. My wife had dinner there with a friend. This is an awesome place with a ton of atmosphere and great fish.\n\nEsquire Club Summary (five point scale)\nExterior: 2 - Pretty plain building; cigarette butts not pretty\nInterior atmosphere: 3 - Main bar room is great\nFood: 4 - Good was great, not overally thrilled with fish batter\nService: 3 - Generally good, but shouldn't have to wait for main course to get a Coke\nValue: 5 - $9.95 for an all-you-can-eat fish fry at this level is outstanding", "business_id": "68JsiWNLKs8NDCrBCxIWMA", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-03-06", "type": "review"}

I was in the area for a business lunch and we decided to try it out. The atmosphere was great for a business lunch. The highback booths allow for private conversations. They would also make great date booths as well. The atmosphere was quiet and allowed for conversation. \n\nThe first thing I noticed was the local art and crafts that were for sale in the restaurant. There were handmade bags and paintings. Both were great products. I am looking forward to bringing my husband back to Imperial Garden to show him the art. The decor was welcoming and not overly kitschy - no gold waving kitty....so to all who love those. The decor was a step above. \n\nI ordered the General Tso's chicken (standard I know). It was ok. A little bland, but if you are not a fan of spicy food then it would be for you. If I ordered it again I would ask for them to kick up the spice. My colleague found the heat level just right. \n\nThere was no wait for lunch during the week, The manager stopped over twice to check on our meal.

The menu is limited though - it definitely isn't really a place to go to eat. They didn't have any drink specials, which made me sad :( I'm used to just getting whatever beer is on sale, because I like everything, but no such luck. However, they aren't expensive so I paid about 4 dollars for a beer I think.\n\nThe best part of this place is that it is totally divey, and it had a lot of interesting characters. This drunk 30 year old guy played pool with my friend and had a lengthy conversation with me about how he used to unpack semi trucks or something.. I don't know. \n\nMy friends would say the best part about this place is their mixed drinks (a gin and tonic and a rum and coke I think?) came in pint sizes - haha.

I can't believe I'm going to write this, but there may have been TOO much bacon (although I managed to eat the entire thing)!

I definitely liked the ambiance of this space a lot. A charming neighborhood bar with horizontal narrow wood paneling, lower lighting, tiled floor, tin ceiling, and a very pretty border/trim around the ceiling. Being a small-ish space with lower ceilings and hard floors, it does get a bit noisy when the place fills up so best to beat the rush if you're sensitive to that sort of thing. Also, it's another CASH ONLY spot so be sure to stock up or else they have an ATM on site.\n\nMy co-workers and I headed here for drinks one Friday. The place seemed to have a \"must order food\" policy in order to be seated at the tables so 15 of us frustratingly spent a bit of time crowded at the entrance, downing beers, trying to decide if we should move on. Fortunately, I think the staff finally figured out that two beers basically equals the cost of a sandwich (so what's the difference) and we got a nice row of tables.  Whew!  The place was definitely running a wait by 6:30pm so, again, head out early/late!\n\nThe Mister and I headed here at 6pm on a Saturday and were able to snag the last open table in the place. The beer list is good and reasonably priced ($4).  The menu offers burgers, apps, and sandwiches and sports several vegetarian options. Mr. had the special (Walleye sandwich) which he enjoyed while I had the Seitan Philly ($8.95), also tasty. We started with the cheese curds ($5.95) which were yummy. I'd previously had the kettle chips/dip, which were just that, chips/dip, nothing fancy and the fried pickles which weren't my favorite... \n\nAll in all I really liked the ambiance (but I'd go early so I can hear better) and appreciate the reasonably priced & yummy options for both vegetarians and carnivores.

If you go expecting an upscale \"gastro-pub\" experience of chic bar food, then you will be disappointed. There are no waiters, and you seat yourself. You order food and drinks at the bar, and  a food runner brings out your order when it's ready. Its got a dive bar atmosphere, and the interior is pretty run down. \n\nAfter fighting for a table due to the crowd that was rapidly accumulating in anticipation of that evening's band, my friends and I perused the menu. It contains primarily stereotypical bar food (burgers, fries, onion rings, etc), but there are a few exceptions. There are several vegetarian options, including veggie nachos, so if you're a non meat eater, you would probably find lots of things to order at The Harmony. Most notably, The Harmony offers a walnut burger. I'm told they're famous for it, so I ordered the walnut burger with blue cheese and a side of homemade potato chips with \"Bleu Cheese Dip\". (What can I say, I really, really love Blue Cheese!) It took awhile for the food to come out, so we drank beer while we waited. Our table of about 10 people ordered 3 pitchers to share. I am not sure what all of them were, but in honor of the WI bar experience, I stuck to PBR. It was as good as PBR can be.\n\nOnto the food: The blue cheese walnut burger came topped with a creamy blue cheese sauce in addition to blue cheese crumbles, rather than plain blue cheese crumbles like I had been anticipating. It also came with onion, lettuce, tomato, and mayo. The lettuce and tomato were exceptionally fresh and ripe looking. I was really impressed, especially by the tomato (it was actually red!). I bit into it and was immediately transported to blue cheese heaven. It was fantastic. I will qualify this praise with the statement that the reason I loved this burger so much was largely a result of the copious blue cheese flavor. I am not sure the walnut burger itself was why it tasted so great. The chips were also awesome. They arrived piping hot. Some were crunchy and others were chewier. It was clear that they were made to order. The Bleu Cheese Dip they came with was similar to what came on my burger, and as a result, was amazing. \n\nWe ate as the band played and just reveled in how fun the whole experience was. By the way, the band was great! It was a Rockabilly group called The Fast Clydes. If you like that style of music, I couldn't recommend them more. They had a ton of energy and knew how to work the crowd. I had a blast. \n\nAll this said, there are a few things that I think The Harmony could improve upon. First off, the tables in the main dining area are plastic. They're the exact same tables that you played beer pong on in college. I feel like The Harmony excels in spite of its dive bar atmosphere, and not necessarily because of it. Therefore, if they invested just a little bit of money to spruce up the interior, I think they would see a return. The Atwood area is still rocking that hippie vibe, for sure, but more and more, I am noticing newer and more upscale establishments. To me, that says that there's probably a market for it and the times, they are a changin'. Also, I don't mind ordering food and drinks at the bar. However, I think The Harmony would benefit from offering table service, at least during shows on Friday and Saturday night. I have only ever been to The Harmony with a group, and it sucks to have to walk away from the conversation to get another beer, a process which can take 10 or 15 minutes if it's crowded. All-in-all, these drawbacks are minor, and I'll be back at The Harmony many times this summer!", "business_id": "KHOHjA8HOcTlFBCtMQFv8A", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-05-10", "type": "review"}

Good barbecue is great.  Smoky Jons is...Good.\n\nI'm in Madison a few times a week for work and we've driven by this place a hundred times and every time said \"We should stop in here\".  We finally did yesterday.\n\nThe interior is nice, an order counter, a few tables, and a log-cabin'esque interior.  An okay place to eat lunch.  The menu is pretty expansive, with a good selection of sandwiches, platters, combos, sausages, sides, desserts, etc.  Whatever you like, meat-wise, you can find it here.\n\nAfter perusing the menu, I decided on the chopped pork shoulder dinner plate.  I should say my family is from Tennessee and I grew up on chopped pork.  I grew up eating at shady back-country Tennessee BBQ places with dirt floors and plank counters and a weathered old man in the back basting a pig.  Barbecue is in my blood.\n\nSmoky Jons was not up to par.  The meat was delicious, but not smoky at all.  You literally could not taste the pit, or the smoke, or the fire.  The sauce was good too, but soooo sweet.  I guess I grew up on a vinegar sauce and I realize that sauce is an intensely regional thing, but this was not what I enjoyed.\n\nThe sides were excellent.  Coleslaw is great.  Beans are perfect.  Sugar biscuits are delish.\n\nHonestly, this is the best BBQ I've had in Madison.  But I've had better at several places in Milwaukee.  And I've had better at countless places in the south.\n\nI know Smokey Jon's is apparently world-renowned for their BBQ so you should probably try it yourself, and honestly I'll probably go back again.\n\nMy favorite though?  No.\n\nA-OK?  Yes, certainly.", "business_id": "HLWtNcf3l-wKb6v9duteMQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-03-24", "type": "review"}

I had the spicy chicken, which was just a chicken breast on a bun, with sauce on the side.  That was it, not even a big chicken breast? \n\nMy wife had the turkey sandwich, which didn't appear to be anything special either.  It looked like it was from a grocery store.\n\nKids liked the burger and brats.\n\nWhat I didn't like was the prices, sandwich platters were $8.45 each and drinks were $1.99 each.  Wasted my money on these as they don't give you a drink you can take with you and it's a plastic cup.  \n\nWhat I did like was the sides, except for the one order of fried biscuit, which was raw in the middle.  Threw them out.\n\nLast, I've never been to a BBQ place with no sauces on the table and only one served with the order.  I liked the sauce, but with all of the awards on the wall, they should offer a few options. \n\nShould have gotten the pulled pork.", "business_id": "HLWtNcf3l-wKb6v9duteMQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-03-26", "type": "review"}

Wait, did I? Nope, clean. Most likely because I licked them clean from the baller sauce that is on this BBQ. The sauce has a great consistency to it and it clings nicely to the meat. \n\nI went with the sig-other and between the two of us, we had the pork shoulder sandwich,  brisket, and ribs. I think we both went with fries and the Cole-slaw for our sides. They were fine. Sides are sides. I realllllllly wish there would have been corn bread. Something doesn't right within me if there is no corn bread to accompany BBQ. I was sad when I found out there was no cornbread.\n\nBut then I was happy again the moment I was able to put that delicious pig in my mouth. The ribs were ribs. The brisket and the pork shoulder was where it was at for me, but really, I think you can slap that sauce on cardboard and it would be delicious.\n\nI'm a west-sider so coming out here is a haul. A worth while haul. Be prepared to wait though; the dining room is small.  They did get out food out to us really quickly, but if we would have come 15 minutes later we would have had to wait in a long line to place our order, and then would have had no where to sit. \n\nOh, and if I wasn't such a bottomless pit, there would have been plenty of leftovers as the portions are plentiful.

You don't get the awards this place has without knowing what you're doing.\n\nI almost always get the ribs (because how can you not?). The sauce has just enough heat to really compliment the ribs.

The potato salad and coleslaw are my favorites. I'm also big fan of the BBQ Baked Beans.

The food is still amazing, however, I recently brought a friend with me to try the place out. We were not that hungry so we decided to share one of the plates since the portions are generous. I was dumbfounded to find out that we were charged $4 for an extra empty plate. No extra portions were provided. Just a straight $4 charge for a empty paper plate.\n\nI'm not sure why this is. What if the person didn't eat? Would they be charged $4 to sit in the seat to chat? It wasn't like the place was full and they were taking the place of a paying customer.\n\nAnyways, still love the food but I'll think twice about bringing friends now.\n\n\n\n************************************Original Review**********************************\nThis place makes me miss when I used to live down in Georgia...but only for the phenomenal BBQ. Seriously though, I haven't found a place with authentic Southern BBQ this north of the Mason-Dixie Line...until NOW!\n\nFor lunch, try the sandwich platter. There's a serious amount of food and it will fill you up. Not enough you say? Ok, then go for the half-chicken with the brisket. It's enough to fill up half the Confederate army!

Most the BBQ joints I've stopped by have horrible side entries but at Jon's they don't appear to have been neglected.\n\nOn the downside, I wasn't a fan of the chopped pork and brisket. They were a bit bland. Regardless, the ribs wayyy outweighed that downside.\n\nThank Jon! I highly recommend folks to swing by and grab some ribs.

The pork is tender and juicy, and the BBQ sauce they have is very unique and has a little kick to it (in a good way.) My husband always gets the beef brisket sandwich, which is by far the best brisket we've ever tasted. I have no idea how they get it so tender.

I've been here on two particular experiences and left annoyed after one of them and it took a few weeks to discover their error on the other problem but you can bet I was good and mad when I found it.\n\nThe first time I went here was to have good old Wisconsin license plate screws removed.  Just walked in, paid cash, had it done.  I put temp tags on the car until the plates came to put on and went to put the plates on and discovered the screw holes were instead stripped out.  I could have done that at home myself instead of paying $40.  Obviously, now I can't put plates on my car where they belong.  I would have just broken the old plate off if I wasn't intending to reuse the screw holes instead of paying $40.\n\nSecond time they just patronized me and seemingly implied I was dumb when explaining the problem I was having with my car.

There was always a good crowd there and a pretty nice clientele.   They did their best to stay out of our way and offered some great deals for the bowling groups through which I got a new ball and some nice new shoes.

They do have a ton of equipment available, but that's about it.\n\nI arrived on Saturday morning with my reservation for a 17' truck firmly in-hand. There was a line of people waiting to check-in/check-out equipment, and only one person working behind the counter. \n\nThe employee (a younger gentleman) appeared to be struggling with everything he did, and he wasn't shy about hiding his frustrations. After waiting for around 15 minutes, another employee (I believe he's the manager) jumped-in and helped folks. The manager was much more proficient, helpful, and friendly. I was third or fourth in line, and the manager processed all of us before the other guy finished his first customer.\n\nWhen I went to get my truck, there was an equipment problem, so they substituted another truck for me. Unfortunately, the truck that I was provided was ancient - it had 204,000 miles on it, the check engine light was on, and it ran so poorly that I thought I was going to breakdown at several points along the way. The steering components were so loose that the truck weaved and swerved the entire time; I could \"saw\" the steering wheel from the 9:00 to 3:00 position as I drove without affecting my direction/course.\n\nBecause of the check engine light, the truck averaged 3.2 miles to the gallon. My 46 mile round-trip move required 15-gallons of fuel to complete. That is absolutely absurd. The cost to refill the truck was $50 on the dot.\n\nEven more absurd were the fees for the truck... $29.95 for the day, $14 for insurance, and $1.09 per mile seem fair. Until they tack on additional service fees, etc. What should've cost around $70 - $80 for an in-town move cost nearly $100 + $50 for gas. \n\nReturning the truck was even worse, as the manager was long gone, and the lone dude was back at the counter. As soon as another employee arrived to assist with the line of people waiting to check-out, the first dude announced that he was \"f-ing out of here\" because he had \"the longest f-ing day of his life\" working there. Mind you, there were 5-6 people in line when he made his proclamation. \n\nI now remember why I've always used Penske or Budget when moving. It's unlikely I'll use these guys in the future...", "business_id": "tgGaaLuFPbeiwPZcAKFxGA", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-04-22", "type": "review"}
