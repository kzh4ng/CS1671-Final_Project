The thick crust that is crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The spicy, peppery sauce that can singe your tongue. The mixture of ingredients just sliding down your chin as it bubbles out of your mouth. That being said, I really don't understand why people go to Pizzeria Uno. This chain has done to the deep dish pizza what McDonald's has done to hamburgers, Pizza Hut has done to pan pizza, Dominoes has done to hand tossed pizza, and Taco Bell has done to Tex-Mex; it has made it almost unpalatable. On our menu:\n\nFrench onion\nChicken bites\nPizza with pepperoni, hamburger, and romano\n\nLooking past the fact that the service was not the best or the fact that the food came out undercooked and tepid in temperature, the food just was not good. Don't get me wrong, this is not the worst pizza I have ever eaten, but this chain is a perfect example of what happens when something becomes so prescribed, overhandled, and overthought that it no longer resembles the original piece of art that tasted so good. \n\nI really never want to return.", "business_id": "6p9TlP2I8S4agxYMNFSDjg", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-10-28", "type": "review"}

This place is such a great hangout/eat-in spot. I hadn't been here and years and some friends invited us out for the evening. I was so glad they were paying cause  I was low on funds at the time.\n\nWe arrived on a friday night and of course it was busy there. We waited about 10 minutes to get a table which wasn't bad considering the crowd. We looked over the menu and they have so many great choices. Pizza, pasta, appetizers, seafood, burgers, salads and sandwiches. \n\nAfter ordering two mango lemonades that were wayyyyy over sweetened we ordered our food. We both are going gluten free which is tough but UNO's gave us a nice selection of dishes to choose from. Plus! They make a thin crust gluten free pizza which taste great. My hubby ordered the mediterrean thin crust because he loves kalamata olives and I ordered the Guac-alicious burger with a Caesar side salad. My salad came out pretty quick which was nice but it had a little too much dressing on it. I didn't complain, it still tasted great.\n\nI'm not into red meat so I tried to order a black bean burger or get chicken instead of beef, but the ran out of black bean and they couldn't get the chicken so i just ordered it anyway. The burger was piled really high with all the toppings including guacamole and it was very creamy but i couldn't get over the taste of the burger because it just didn't have any flavor. Very saddening. I ended up just eating the veggies and discarding the meat. I snacked on some of my hubbies pizza even though it was only a small amount. \n\nWe came here twice in one week. The second time we ordered the 9-grain deep dish with mushrooms, parmesan and a garlic white sauce. Was this pizza amazing or what?? I will probably always eat this pizza whenever I come. \n\nOnly down side is slow service. It took 20 minutes for our pizza to come out and my hubbies was a little over cooked. He got the numero uno which was ok but mine had way more flavor!!", "business_id": "6p9TlP2I8S4agxYMNFSDjg", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-10-21", "type": "review"}

When we asked what the charge was for they charged us for the games that we played on the console that they gave us while waiting for our dinner. I have never heard of anything like it.

This is about the only red sauce pizza I ever get a craving for, and boy howdy is it good. The crust is on the thin side and ever so crisp on the bottom, while still having enough dough on the edge to provide a nice chewy bit at the end of your slice. The dough itself is flavorful, not too... well, doughy. The sauce is great, and they don't drown the pizza in it. There's just enough cheese; not so much it's an overwhelming grease slick and not so little you can't tell it's there. If you can go while Mama's working, all the better.\n\nYou can eat in here; they have four or five booths and generations worth of family photos on the walls. Two of us split a small (8-cut) pizza with one topping ($9) and with our two cans of pop we were out for $10. You can't beat that. And I'd put Bellisario's pizza up against any in the city.\n\nI grew up a five minute walk away. My mom loved Bellisario's and I have a lot of fond memories of walking through the alley to pick up a cheese pizza to bring home, my mom being too dollar-conscious to pay for delivery when there were perfectly able-bodied children around to go pick it up. Every time I have a slice, it brings back great memories. But I've had outside confirmation that it really is as awesome as I think it is.\n\nIt's a little divey, stuck in the back of an old shopping plaza, but it's perfect. If you're in West Mifflin (say, going to Kennywood), drive over and eat a pizza. They've also got hoagies and calzones, and I think that's about it.

The service is decent, kind of point blank, not rude, nor over the top friendly. \n\nThe crowd can fluctuate between 'Oh my god, I'm surrounded by Hillbillies' to 'the local gathering at Mayberry', but that seems to be the norm for most places in da burgh.\n\nI've not had the pizza, which apparently get raves, because frankly I only think of pizza as coming in a box to my front door when I'm too lazy to do any cooking at home. But I've had three or four of the pasta dishes, and they come in a generous portion, with a side salad and an order of garlic toast. They taste fine, fill you up, and don't break your bank.\n\nAnd for a local neighborhood joint, that's exactly what I'd hope for.

Artichoke, Buffalo Chicken, Spinach & Feta, and Greek pies are all delicious. I've also had some of their pasta dishes, and I can't complain. It's nice to have something other than pizza delivered; the portions are huge, and they come with bread and a salad. Pizza Parma fails on wings, though.

As for the pizza itself, it was solidly A-OK--nothing special, but nothing horrible, either.  It was a bit on the greasy side, and I could tell from pulling the first piece away from the pie that the crust wasn't crispy.  Biting into my first slice of pepperoni pizza confirmed my suspicions about the floppiness of the crust.  As for the flavor, it was your standard pizza flavor--again, nothing special, but nothing horrible, either.  It was more greasy than I'd like, but not to the point where I felt it necessary to dab off the grease with a napkin (though I was tempted to do so).\n\nAs the bottom line, the pizza was fine for our purposes (to soak up alcohol).

The wings arrived exactly an hour later with the exact number of wings promised and a side of celery. Here's the catch...THERE WAS NO SAUCE! My party of three decided to just tough it out and eat the wings plain. They were, I kid you not, so bland that I wasn't sure what I was eating. They literally just threw the wings in the fryer and delivered it to us. So once we realized how unbearable the plain wings were, we called and complained about the sauce. About 40 minutes later, the sauce arrived. At this point, the wings got cold and our hunger turned into an unbearable rage. We tried BBQ, Garlic Parmesan and Spicy. The sauces were just average. The spicy sauce was so weak that I should've just settled with a bottle of sirracha. \n\nThe deliver guy gave us a cannoli as an apology....ONE CANNOLI....3 eaters! You get the point. But this gives me the chance to tell you how terrible the cannoli was. The outer shell was soggy and the filling made me gag a little. It looked nice, but didn't taste that great. \n\nSo after 1 hour and 40 minutes, 24 wings, 3 sauces and a cannoli... we have 3 very unhappy customers.

And...I was pretty underwhelmed. \n\nFor starters, a couple people definitely had problems ordering due to a poor connection or something like that. Fine. It happens. But then when our food eventually arrived the poor deliveryman told me that he had no idea how much my lunch cost. Fortunately, I'd gotten that info when I ordered.

I had ordered mozzarella sticks as an appetizer, but they did not impress me. The cheese was anything but gooey, and I ended up eating a couple sticks in one bite because the cheese simply wouldn't rip apart when I bit into it. The batter on the sticks also left a pretty bad aftertaste in my mouth, so much so that I chugged Coke after every bite to try to make up for it. \n\nAs for the sandwiches, my coworkers complained that their hoagies all came with too much mayo - one girl had even asked for her mayo to come on the side. No such luck: it came on her sandwich just like everyone else. As for me, the ranch I had asked to go with my buffalo chicken hoagie didn't even arrive. I used some from the company fridge. And the ranch was the only way I could eat the sandwich, which was drowning in buffalo sauce and could have been taken out of their toaster a lot sooner - entire sections of my sandwich's bread shouldn't break off when I bite into it, but that's what happens when you over toast something so badly...and is what happened here.\n\nI currently don't plan on ordering from this place again.

It was a good size and the meat was flavorful. But that's about it. They put oil on the sandwich, but no other dressing. I expected a nice tangy flavor to compliment the meat but was disappointed. My date ordered a hot sausage hoagie. I didn't sample it, he liked it, but it was way too messy. The bread got soggy and the darn thing fell apart. It looked more like tomato soup with sausage than a sandwich.  The staff did seem pretty nice, even trying to keep a smile while dealing with the stress of a busy crowded restaurant.

Lots of onions, tomatoes and olives which made me happy.\n\nWings were surprisingly good, we had a dozen hot and the sauce was basically franks - but I'm ok with that.

It was juicy and smothered in bleu cheese. \n\nWhile my food was really good, there were some issues with the other items ordered. Two of my guests cited that the wedding soup had a metalic taste to it while my other friend with the burger found a hair. Being a hairdresser and understanding that it does happen sometimes, she disregarded it and continued to eat her burger. Unfortunately, the hair did not stop there. Another guest found several hairs in their meal as well. We decided that we should let our waitress know. I stopped the waitress and explained how there was hair in two people's food. The waitress got upset and was very rude (it's not like we accused her of planting the hair herself). On top of this, she mistakenly took my burger and walked away with it, leaving the sullied food on the table. When she came back I told her that my burger was not one of the items with food on it and she instantly became defensive. At this point we asked for a manager (who never came) and insisted our meal get comped. Considering she threw out the only good food that we ordered, we didn't feel like that was asking too much. Luckily the waitress did not put up too much of a fight. \n\nI will never eat at Bado's again.

I want around seven on a Monday night, also Columbus Day if that has any impact, and there was really no crowd.  My server, Barry, was very nice and was very good.\n\nRight off the bat, I'll explain why am taking two stars away. The service was a little bit too fast for me between my two courses as within maybe three minutes of my salad being taken away my pizza came right out. Normally I'm a fan of fast service but that was a little bit too fast for me. I'm also taking a star off, and whoever reads this review will probably think this is a stupid reason but this review is my opinion, because the salads with the exception of a few or overpriced compared to the other appetizers.\n\nI had the grilled portobello mushroom salad and the 4 cut margherita pizza. \n\nThe salad was huge but great, the house Italian dressing complemented the salad really well. The salad was a nice mix of mushroom and greens, though I'd have preferred a bigger helping of greens. Of course you're not going to like this salad if you don't like mushrooms. \n\nThe pizza was tasty and pretty well done. Oh my goodness was it tasty. You could really taste the tomatoes and basil playing off each other and neither was overpowered by the cheese. Secondly, the tomatoes tasted fresh, not like the canned, heavily processed kind or tomato paste but like the diced San Marzanno organic tomatoes you can buy at fancier grocery stores. That went a long way for me with the pizza. \n\nThe con for the pizza: I have to say it was weird to me that the crust was this weird mix of crispy and kind of hard to cut and then perfectly chewy. The actual bottom of the pizza was crispy, like it should be so the pizza doesn't fall apart, but it was a little too crispy for my tastes as there were a couple points where I had a hard time cutting the pizza into bite-size pieces. I also have to comment that two of my slices, the two that I ended up bringing home because I was stuffed, hadn't been fully cut apart and that was a little annoying. I can overlook it, but it's still something I want to comment on.\n\n\nThis isn't the kind of pizza that you can easily just pick up and eat with your hands because there is so much to it. It's a very dense pizza. \n\nI want to end this review by commenting on the slightly weird pricing for the pizzas. The pizza is priced based off of how many slices the pizza is cut into. And, I feel the pizza was a little bit pricey for the four slice pizza that I got, it was just under $13. \n\nThat all said though I had a fun time at Bado's and I'll go back.", "business_id": "qemCNgjeYGcFsRwxW9x4xw", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-10-12", "type": "review"}

Since the move from NY, I'd been really craving some quality, New York-style pizza, and hadn't had a ton of luck finding any (although the search introduced me to some excellent \"Pittsburgh-style\" pizza joints, so I'm not complaining.)  \n\nVilla Reale really came through.\n\nI loved that you could order a slice with basically whatever toppings you wanted (I'm used to being at the mercy of whatever \"slice\" pie has been languishing under a heat lamp for 3 hours).  I ordered a pepperoni and sausage slice, and the small feast that was presented to me did not disappoint.  The slice was huge, the pepperoni crispy, the sauce really balanced (not too sweet, not too garlicy), the cheese fresh and delicious and the crust...oh man...thin and crisp on the outside, pillowy soft on the inside.  One slice was perfect to fill me up for lunch, too.  \n\nFull disclosure: while the wait staff is so friendly, they do get overwhelmingly busy at lunch.  We went to the place at 11:00 so we could sit at a table (if you want to dine-in and order a slice during lunch, you can only sit at the counter, not a table, after 11:30) and by 11:30 the place was standing room only.  My coworkers informed me that somehow, their pizzas are even better when ordered by the pie (hard for me to fathom) and also that their hoagies are delicious, so I'm sure I'll be trying one of those next time.  \n\nIt's not the most inexpensive pizza joint downtown (I think my slice ended up being $4-$4.50) but if you're a recovering Noo Yawker like me looking to fulfill some culinary nostalgia, this is your place.", "business_id": "l-OmDgEd4QkZpyXVpkp2yA", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-09-24", "type": "review"}

This is the bar attached to the pizza joint.   I LOVE \"dive\" bars so I wanted to love this place, but I wasn't feeling everything.\n\nAMAZING prices for the city. $6 for a double jack and coke?  Yes,  please! And they are strong.   \n\nService is hit and miss.  Staff seems acquainted to a smaller amount of people so a full bar makes them nervous. We got most drinks at the bar but the bartender came around once to our table. And then she left the bar for like 10 minutes...that seemed a bit strange. Perhaps a bar waitress would be beneficial. We probably would have ordered food if someone asked us if we'd like to order. \n\nSince we couldn't order food, I have no comments on that. :(\n\nLocation is down an alley way. A bit foreboding but I guess that's what you get at an inner-city dive bar. Seems to be a hangout for locals and after-work types. Pretty small area but lots of tables. Get there early to snag one because you won't have any available if you wait til 5:15 PM on a Friday. Bathrooms are down a set of stairs in the pizza joint. Felt like descending a mountain but maybe that was the booze. Also, the stalls are on a platform which made my 6'0\" frame have to stoop to get in. Bathroom = shady. \n\nWhile I would go back, my husband stated he wouldn't. I didn't get the vibe he did but he usually can read places pretty well so I'll probably listen to his opinion on this one.

A \"hard to find place\" is an understatement if it's dark outside and you have never been here.   I have to agree, the crust of the pizza is amazingly flakey and delicious.  I'm a crusty guy, so I like good crust and though it's up there with a soft boboli it's still easy to eat and won't rough up your mouth.  I ordered the Ephesus Pizza with lamb skewers ($16.00 large).  It is a white pizza with minimal ingredients except for the lamb skewers.  They packed on 8-9 small skewers of lamb and I have to admit, the lamb was very tasty and tender.  The problem I have with this place is the filthy, trash laden environment it sits in.  It's on the mezzanine level (2nd floor) of a some financial building and when I got there, the exterior doors to the building were locked and luckily a group of people showed up and punched in the code to get one of the side doors opened...it was strange.  However, when you walk in that side door, I was faced with the stairwell with trash cans spewed about.  when I entered the pizza/sandwich joint, it was in disarray, bread was in crates on the floor and trash cans were overflowing.  The bathroom was in a construction zone and filthy.  All of this added up to being afraid to eat anything because you were unsure as to how fresh the food was and how well kept the kitchen may or may not have been.  I'm not a fluffy guy, but I need some fluff in my establishments...look clean, feel clean, feel safe and I can live with whatever you dish out, but when first impressions are nasty and dirty, it hits homeplate way before the food hits my mouth.

I called back in 15 minute increments (each time being given a different excuse) they could not get ahold of the driver, there was traffic. I explained that this was for a celebration and if they would just let me know so that if it wasn't coming I could order from another restaurant. They finally agreed to cancel the order. This was more than 2 hours after I had placed the order. As soon as I hung up the phone, the food was delivered. I did not receive the free cheesy bread and the drink order was incorrect. the pizza was not sliced into squares and I did not receive any French fries. I sent s message to grub hub and they said they talked to the establishment and there is nothing they can do about it. I would be careful ordering food here.

Tonight was the conclusion a long day and all I wanted was to go back to my hosteI and maybe grab a bite to eat. In my haste to get dinner before I passed out, I almost made the mistake of entering Fazio's, the other hole-in-the-wall pizza joint on Penn Avenue in Lawrenceville. Well-I am glad I did not do that!  Remembering that the restaurant I quickly Yelped before walking out from the hostel had a longer name, I continued to walk down Penn Avenue until I found Graziano's. Upon entering, I was greeted by a slightly unwelcoming smell. It wasn't pizza I was smelling, or at least fresh pizza. But I remembered how positive all the reviews on Yelp were. I was a little disappointed when I saw how small their menu was, and yet it still took me a while to order. I first contemplated getting the fried fish with french fries. I do love a crispy fish sandwich. There was even a girl at another table who had just gotten hers for eating there. I tried to inconspicuously spy her fried fish. It looked good but it's a who lot a fish. I decided to order the steak and cheese sub instead. Now that I am home eating, I am glad I went to Graziano's and I am very impressed with their steak sub. Meaty, greasy, tangy, and large. What more can I say? That's a good steak sub. The bread is slightly toasted but still soft. Just perfect. I don't know many places that put Italian dressing and mayo on steak and cheeses, but I like the combo. It's more than enough food for 2 and only costed 9 bucks. I think I will finish it all off because I did not eat lunch today. MMM. stiill got lots more to enjoy. I recommend Graziano's for take out, not eating in.

They do not cook directly on the brick though, they use pizza screens.  The screens that they use are the ones with the really big holes as opposed to the grid style screens that everyone else uses.  I have never seen another shop use the big hole screens, and probably for a reason because the dough was really really terrible cooked.  It was burned to the point of being black on the bottom at (which I usually don't mind at all) but somehow they managed for it to still be completely doughy and soft and not the least bit crispy.  Honestly it seems like some kind of miracle of science to have a black pizza bottom and for it to not at least be a little bit crispy.  The pizza was definitely on the overly thick and doughy side and even if it had been cooked well it probably still would have been too doughy to be very good.  The dough recipe may or may not have tasted good, no one will probably ever know because it will probably never be cooked evenly enough to even have a chance at tasting good. \n\nThe biggest problem with the pizza overall was the 2 pounds of cheese sunken into a large gelatinous wad in the middle.  It smelled like decent cheese, probably Grande (although probably cut with something cheaper).  They are wasting so much money on cheese its sad.  Whoever the pizzaman was obviously took no pride in it whatsoever.  The sauce was all dropped into the middle with most of the cheese.  The edges of the pizza had big bubbles where all of the cheese and sauce should have been, but they were NOT the nice crispy kind of bubbles that could be enjoyed...just lumpy masses of sadness.  \n\nI can't comment on the taste of the sauce because I am not a brave enough man to have put a slice of this DIY toilet clogging kit into my delicate stomachular system.  Fake words aside, this pizza really sucks guys. \n\nThe icing on the cake were the breadsticks, a side item that I consider to be pretty un-f*ckable.  So for breadsticks, Mr. Bellesario (BTW, I hope that this is just some made-up Italian restaurant name and that someone doesn't actually put their family name behind this crap) just cuts up slices of the premade Sicilian dough and slaps some oil and herbs on it and calls it breadsticks.  Its the most ghetto attempt at this particular appetizer that I have ever heard of.  Its pretty funny, really. \n\n\nSo yeah, this place is definitely worth avoiding at all costs especially considering the prices aren't even good and the restaurant itself is completely filthy inside.  The owner was nice enough about refunding the money for the pizza.  Its a shame when I see businesses like this that are set in their ways and are really wasting their potential with a general lack of pride.", "business_id": "UjJMQguryo1jypomvOCZgg", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-11-16", "type": "review"}

I've been told about this place for years and finally stopped in on Friday night around 8 PM.  I guess I'm not the only person who likes pizza on a Friday night because it was packed.  However, we were escorted out back to a beautiful wine bar with great dark lighting, comfy furniture and additional seating.  THe bar itself was pretty small, maybe 8 seats and the place was packed.  It didn't affect our service which was quite good and no one in the group waited for a drink.  The crowd was (I hate this word) \"trendy\" and most were laughing and having fun.  THe wine seemed to be relatively reasonable priced, however I'd like more options than just italian wine.  We sampled a charcutterie platter which was amazing.  The meats were top notch and flavorful.  The hummus and olives were some of the best I've had and the buffalo mozzarrella was to die for. The best I've ever had.  After a few drinks we were able to secure a table for 6 in the front and the server was prompt and friendly.  Wow, the pizza truly the best I've had in the burgh'.  I love mineos, aiellos, and fioris as much as the next but this is in a different league.  We ordered the neoplolitan pizza which is very simple, light, thin crust and amazing flavor.  As another yelper mentioned this is one of only 16 pizza places in the states to be certified to serve authentic neopolitan pizza.  We also tried some of the other pasta dishes, which were very good but again go for the pizza.  It's one of the best pies I've had coast to coast and I'd stack up against Ray's or any other historic pizza joint in NYC.

I had thought about eating here in the past but was always put off by the location.  That being said, I went to Il Pizzaiolo last night with my fiance, and I have to say I was very disappointed.  We started with the Caesar salad, which was OK.  The dressing was delicious, however there was very little of it, and we found ourselves eating entire bites of dry, flavorless lettuce.  It was also an outrageous $10 dollars.  Don't get me wrong, had this been an entree sized portion, $10 would have been more than appropriate.  However it was just a starter size, and should have been no more than $6.\n\nWe then shared their margherita pizza which had delicious flavors, but was incredibly soggy.  It was also fairly small, but that was almost to be expected.  It was $12 dollars, so the size was not necessarily a problem, however it was hard to enjoy such a soggy mess of a pizza.  We also shared a pasta dish which was INCREDIBLY overpriced.  At $17 dollars, I was expecting more than a small bowl filled with dry pasta.  It was homemade, and well made, however it was almost insultingly small.  We finished with tiramisu which was excellent, and appropriately priced at $8.\n\nIn all, I found the flavors of their food to be excellent, however i was horribly misled.  Not only was every menu I found online roughly $2 to $3 dollars cheaper than their actual menu, but there was a table next to us who ordered pasta and received an enormous portion, prompting us to order pasta.  It was only till later did we realize that they were employees who had decided to dine their for the evening.  We also had a serious problem with the timing of the food.  The service was great, however for a Tuesday night, I would have thought their kitchen could time the courses properly; we had barely started our salad when the entree's came.

Sensing my dissatisfaction , spencer recommended what I should have ordered in the first place... PIZZA. O....m.....G!!!!!! Writing this review at 10:30 am is making my mouth water thinking about it. When I was a kid, this pizza place by our house used to make the best pizza that my mother and I used to love to eat. Since then, now here's come close. The nostalgia that I experienced as I smelled and tasted this stuff almost brought on hyperventilating. Amazing food and impeccable service. \n\nFrom a Detroiter to you; I truly enjoyed my experience and my meal!", "business_id": "6-rJjW6ITl5o_FliiNgZRA", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-10-15", "type": "review"}

In my experience everything comes out piping hot and cooked to perfection. If I want a single piece of pizza with a weird combination of toppings, they'll get it ready for me, no problem! And the cheese - this is a great place for pizza with a decent layer of cheese that's also paired with the right amount of homemade seasoned sauce. The result is a tangy mouthful of \"yum\" that always hits the spot.\n\nDefinitely one of the best local pizza places, even if you need to deal with things like paper plates (admittedly not the best thing to use when trying to eat pizza fresh out of an oven).

We had no thin crust, real New York style pizza place. The sauce is good and tangy, the slices are huge, there's just nothing special about the place. Lately (for the past few years) it seems like they're not baking the pizza all the way or something. The pepperoni are never crisp, the crust is kind of pasty and chewy, and the cheese doesn't really get golden brown anymore. It's a descent pie, I think they can do better. They do have pretty good sub sandwiches, fresh salads, and garlic knots that smell amazing when hot out the oven! The offer pizza by the slice but only cheese and pepperoni. I've never been sure of why they can't just throw a couple of toppings on top of an already baked pie and throw it in the oven. They can charge extra! When I order a slice, I usually have to take it home to warm it up or brown it to get the crust crisp. The wings they offer are tasty and spicy even though their just frozen wings, they're not bad. Tony's doesn't have any competition too close by (when I go it's for convience), they're lucky in that sense. And, they close very early on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday night. If it's after 10pm and you want pizza, don't call Tony's. They serve beer and wine, maybe they should add a tv or two where people can hang a little and enjoy the pizza.

Being half Italian, this place brings back a lot of memories of my grandmother's place. It's just so amazingly tacky, from the different types of rooms you can eat in, to the stuff on the walls & ceilings. \n\nBuca is unique because of how they separate the seating. There are different types of themes for each room & each is very unique. I've sat in the Wine Room twice & filled wine racks cover the entire ceiling. There's also a pope room, with a spinning pope head in the middle of the table...yes...very weird. Also, I believe you have to reserve the booth located in the kitchen, but this is where you can watch the workings of the kitchen from inside of it.\n\nThe food here is great as well, with your normal favorites with some other odd creations. They have giant meatballs which are great for more than one person. You can order individual portions, but they're specialty is family style dining. So bring some people with you that have hearty appetites because you get a lot of food here.\n\nThis place may be a chain, but it's definitely a must visit if you're an Italian food fan...which I have no idea who isn't.

I wish they offered a small salad with the order instead of an addon but you definitely get your moneys worth in quantity. ALSO, if you are on the lookout there are ALWAYS buca coupons in the sunday papers, in valpak, and if you search for google apps on android. So if this was based on food I would give Buca a 5.\n\nI took my Italian gf to Buca on her bday at her request and I must say the dining experience was the WORST either of us have ever experienced. We went during the week and they had maybe 8 different \"tables\" or groups dining in...they put us all in the same room (with the other 4-5 rooms EMPTY) and bunched us together with everyone. I'm literally sitting side by side with another group on a bench inevitably hearing every word of their conversation. Ideally you take your gf out on her Bday you want a private personable dinner where you can talk without hearing every word of someone elses conversation....that alone was bad when they had so much room in the restaurant. \n\nOn top of that we had the worst waitress ever, Cassandra.....she harassed us literally every 2-3 minutes asking us if the food was okay, talking about the weather, etc...she was interrupting us CONSTANTLY. My gf and I began being short with her so she would let us enjoy our dinner and she just didn't take the clue. On top of that the host who worked at the front door kept coming back and doing the same, CONSTANTLY. It's nice that people care that your meal is okay, but theres no need to ask us how our meal is literally every few minutes when I'm eating the same thing. My gf and I could not talk without the constant interruption.\n\nHorrible experience dine in but we have continued to go back for their TAKE OUT....We generally will call 20-30 mins in advance, then showup to get our orders and its still not ready often we'll have to sit there and wait another 10-20 mins like they didn't start it until we got there.

But I do enjoy an occasional pizza pie, & Fuel just isn't impress me all that much.\n\nI've eaten at this Fuel in downtown Charlotte for late night several times & the place is always packed. They're open after the bars close, so expect some long lines full of boozed up late nighters. And unlike some other late night options in Charlotte, Fuel takes quite a while to get your order placed, & then you have to wait again to actually get your food. This whole line/wait can take from 20 min up.\n\nOnce you get to the front of line, they have a lot of pizza topping options, from your basics to some odd ones. Along with pizza slice choices, they also have garlic knots which actually may be better than the pizza. When you finally do get your food, the pizza is nothing special, especially considering your wait. To me, it's just your average, run of the mill pizza.\n\nI'd much rather have a different late night meal than pizza, but I still don't think their pizza is worth the wait. But if you really do crave pizza after bar hopping, then head to Fuel Pizza for a lengthy wait to satisfy your pizza hunger.", "business_id": "e8kqqWU9247Nn5VAF5sDkQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2008-09-22", "type": "review"}

On the plus side, I think it's awesome that there is a pizza place that stays open past 2am - that's a very rare find where I'm from in the Hampton Roads area. \n\nAnyway, we finally get to order: a few slices and a few garlic knots. The prices are good, I think I paid 6 bucks for a drink, a garlic knot, and two slices of cheese. The pizza is alright - it's thin crust and greasy, but let's be real - that's the best kind of pizza when you've been out and about all night being tipsy*.

On average probably twice a month. Food is usually what I expected and I like their product. Service on the other hand isn't up to snuff. Several times they've screwed my order up, often leaving ingredients off completely. The last time I ordered they left chicken off my order and I was told that I'd get a credit on my account for the next time. So tonight I called my order in (I usually do it online). An individual named Zach answered, and I proceeded to place my order. Simple order, 2 salads, 1 antipasta, and one basic with nothing but mushroom and chicken. I asked for the breaded chicken instead of the grilled. Zach informed me that they didn't offer the breaded anymore. No problem I said, \"do you still offer the boneless chicken wings\"? \"Yes\" he replied. \"Fine\" says I, \"I'll take a separate order of those!\" I didn't ask for him to substitute, although that seems to me like it would have been simple enough. But hey, that's just me. Total order with driver tip -$27.83 \n\nAnyway, that's not even why I'm upset. So at the end of my order I say to Zach that I think I have a credit on my account from them leaving an ingredient off the last time, it was maybe a buck or two. His reply was that he didn't see it. I reply that I assure him that I'm not lying about it. Again, he replies that it's not there. I then ask to speak to a manager, and Zach informs me that he is the manager.  Flabbergasted, I tell him to just place the order as is, and proceeded to tell him what real customer service looks like, and that am a frequent customer. Zach proceeds to tell me that the last time I ordered was 2010. Yeah, maybe by phone! So, not only has this guy insulted me by insinuating that I'm lying about a couple of bucks, now I'm lying about how often I shop there! You're on a roll Zach!

Crunchy crust, cut in squares, lots of cheese... it's a very tasty pizza.  However, the uninitiated may order this without knowing the best part of Monical's... the french dressing.  This seems odd (at least to all of my out of town friends in the past) but the way to eat Monicals is to get a bottle of the french dressing and dip the pizza in it.  I put the dressing directly on the top of the pizza myself... it's one of the oddest but best combos you will ever taste.  In fact, they even sell their french dressing online!  (And its worth it, because you will never find a dressing that good in stores.  Seriously, I've looked.)\n\nGrab the family pleaser (with salad and cola) and lube up your salad and pizza with copious amounts of french dressing... and thank me later.", "business_id": "yTlW8Xh1wPpvHBl3dGz9mA", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-09-08", "type": "review"}

This place is right across the street from the station. I sat by myself at the bar, but there were plenty of others riding solo as well. It was THAT kind of place - where the locals can come and drown away their sorrows. Actually, it was much more than that - this place seems to have a little bit of everything. There are pool tables in the back, so you can get that sort of crowd. There are larger tables as well, so you can see some large groups of students gabbing away. There are a good amount of TV's, so there were some people watching the evening college football games. There are decent sized booths, so I saw a couple people typing away on laptops. And there's a jukebox, so some people are silently rocking out to the classics. And perhaps best of all, there were plenty of townies around for some great people watching. At one point of the locals who had clearly had too much to drink began serenading a nearby booth with the Canadian National Anthem. Although he didn't get the words right, I gave him an A+ for effort. The bartenders called the guy a cab and made sure he got home okay. It felt like I was inside some sort of insider club where everybody is friends, and even the students are cool with the townies.\n\nThe beer selection was surprisingly good. There were a lot of good import options available, although I stuck with $2.25 Bud Light drafts. Remember, I was taking the Amtrak home, so that shows you how much money I wanted to spend.... They have $1.50 PBR drafts too, which is what the locals stuck to. The food was pretty good as well. I had a simple cheeseburger and fries. Although not my favorite burger/fries combo, it was definitely worth the $4.50 I paid. The \"fixin's table\" they have is nothing more than onions, pickles, and tomatoes next to some condiments and sauces - Nothing special there. But there was something cool about being able to put that stuff on yourself, I guess.\n\nThe charm of this place lies in the characters that visit, and for that alone, I am giving a 5 star rating. The cheap food and beer is an added bonus. And I almost forgot, free peanuts!

Its journeyman efforts will win friends and a few high fives, but it is not the flashy varsity letterman. \n\nFood here is just fine, and very reasonably priced. I have been disappointed with the size of their appetizers once or twice, but their entrees are a solid value, cooked dependably to be exactly what you expect in pub grub. Prices are very good for downtown Champaign, but they lack the booze selection of a Radio Maria or Blind Pig. The gross looking jar on the bar is infused vodka.\n\nService is always friendly, and fastest at the bar. If you sit at their pretty awesome outside tables, the trade off is that you're gonna get ignored. You can order lunch ahead and pick up 15 minutes later. The free peanuts are priceless, as are the friendly patrons who are more likely than other crowds in town to strike up a convo with you. \n\nAll this sounds pretty complimentary, but the fact is that this place is not stand-out awesome in any particular way.

It's also the place I had my first legal drink, the place I arranged my first (extremely underwhelming) one-night stand, the place I had my first post-breakup talk ... the list goes on and on. In short, the Esquire is a place of firsts for me, and for that reason it holds an unimpeachable place in my heart.\n\nIt's a good place, even taking none of the above into account. The prices are reasonable, the service is friendly, the drinks are stiff, the food is tasty, the jukebox kicks much ass (except on one night a few years back when some doucherocket fed about a million dollars into the machine and played Pogues records all night, but I am willing to let bygones be bygones). There's a nice array of seating options: small tables, mid-size tables, large booths, and the bar itself, which is the best place to sit if you want super-fast service and a good vantage point for eavesdropping and people-watching. There are also some tables outside, which are nice places to park your ass if you're a smoker or like keeping an eye on the goings-on along Walnut. The outdoors is heated during chilly weather, and although it doesn't too a ton of good in the dead of winter, it's lovely on brisk autumn nights.\n\nThe people who frequent this place are an interesting mix. Some townies, some students, some regulars, some noobs. You're just as likely to see a gaggle of hipsters looking vaguely out of place as you are to see a group of middle-aged business types in dad jeans. Every once in a while some truly fresh and interesting personalities will be present, such as a trio of cackling cougars sipping pineapple margaritas and flirting with any male under the age of 26, or two sharply-dressed men having a snappy but ultimately friendly conversation you ache to be a part of, or a crusty old man with a walrus mustache who will pound your table with a hammy fist and yell something that sounds friendly but is completely unintelligible. Oh, and every once in a while Tim Lash of Hum fame will be hanging around, which I think we can all agree is pretty delightful. (I do not advocate drunkenly pestering him, of course, but if you do want to say hi be assured that he's about the nicest dude on earth and will receive your attention with much grace and warmth.)\n\nOne of the best, most endearing things about this bar is its all-around friendliness. I often go here by myself in the evening with whatever book I'm currently reading, fold myself into a corner, and order a few beers. Not once has any patron or staff member given me grief over this, and for that I am truly grateful. Yes, the linoleum is hideous and yes, the bathrooms are a little iffy, but all the bartenders remember my name, and that's something that can't be beat.", "business_id": "pPWre8lbVAssER6CN0uWMw", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-09-28", "type": "review"}

Before my family moved away from Champaign, this was the number one place we would take out of town relatives visiting. Even as objectively yummier, cooler places opened up around town, Aunt So-and-so and Uncle Whatshisface would always demand to be taken back to Esquire, and we were always happy to oblige.

Then stomp on all the peanut shells on the floor.  I have seen expansion many times.  Originally from one bar and a few booths, to a wrap around bar, then finally to the pool hall and extra bar area that you see now.  I have met U of I basketball coaches here, there are pictures of former Cubs players kissing my Mom (wait, what).  My parents originally met here.  It is safe to say my family has a mullti generational history here.\n\nAnyway, beyond the nostalgia, it is one of the best pubs to visit in the downtown area.  Just a great place to relax and have a few drinks.  Along with the evolution of the bar, so has the menu.  Now there is a mix of pub grub like burgers, fish sandwiches, etc.  Which I don't think are that great.  Though the various pizzas are very good.  As are the wings, which I am not typically a fan of.  Though these are baked, not fried and battered like most.  The Asian Dumplings are great as well.  The service can be hit or miss.  Depending on the time you come, and where you order.  Bar service is pretty good, but the waitresses can be a bit confused when trying to find you after you place the order.  Though they work hard, and always take care of anything that might be wrong.\n\nDrinks are pretty standard.  There are a handful of good micros on tap.  Usually something from Two Brothers or Dark Horse as the main micros available on tap.  A bit more extensive selection in bottles.  The rest is typical drinks for a neighborhood bar.\n\nOverall, not perfect.  Though the goods far out way the bad.

It's never too loud, never too crazy, they have great service and they do a fantastic thin crust pizza.  My personal faves lie in a dead heat between their \"margherita\" and \"fajita\" pizza.

Relaxed. Mostly old people, townies. It's clean as well. \n\nBut the pizza is much too small for the price. Maybe someone with a normal sized appetite can chime in.\n\nUpdate: I think I found out why I thought it was overpriced. I saw that the pizza was $7 on the menu (I just confirmed it). But was charged over $9. Why? I understand $7 is pre-tax but then, to be conservative, $9 flat would still go over the total. It's not a big difference but it's not acceptable to steal from customers, on purpose or accidentally. \n\nHere's the link to their menu with the prices: http://www.jupiterspizza.com/downtown/menu.html\n\nI got a custom 4-topping personal which should have been about $8 tops. \n\nSomething that really bugs me about restaurants, as it should, is when they don't care what price they put on the menu and the servers will throw some extra on there because they're careless.

As you're standing in line either waiting for your pick up or ordering on the spot...you're forced to look at that beautiful pizza.  \nThe cheese looks gooey, the toppings fresh, and the crust crusty.  It looked so good to me that I ended up ordering a slice even though I had already called something else in.  \nI got ham and pepperoni.  It was honestly irresistible looking in its tray.  But when I got it back to the office I was like, \"Oh.\"\nI could see that it wasn't as thick as I first thought, and a bit more grease than expected too.  The crust had the consistency that I like - crusty and, well...crusty.  But its taste was less than stellar, just kinda bland and greasy.  \nSo now I know all that glitters isn't gold.\nNow on to what I actually ordered - the Italian beef.  I never had one like this before - its more like a hoagie than the thing I'm used to getting everywhere else.  The meat was thicker and chunkier (that's what she said), whole slices of green peppers, and really no juice.  Don't get me wrong, though...it tasted great.  Everything was fresh and the meat ended up being very tender and juicy.  I even liked the bread it was on.  But its not my beloved italian beef sandwich I'm used to.\nI went again the next day.\nThis time I ordered the gyro, with the idea that if they get the gyro wrong I can take them off of my wall of menus.\nIt was a traditional gyro with cucumber sauce, onions, tomato and a soft pita...but it was only ordinary.  Again, it tasted fine and good, but it wasn't one of the best I've had.\nAnd like the day before, I got messed up while I was in line looking at the food trays.  This time they had baked wing dings!  50 cent a wing was a bit expensive, but those little things were absolutely delicious!  They were seasoned so well.  And not greasy at all.  So good!\nTwo things about this place that will make me come back more than the food - the service and the prices.\nThe lady that works the cashier has such a warm smile and manner, like an old Italian mama.  And what I assume is the boss/owner was also very friendly and bubbly.  \nThe prices are some of the best in this downtown area that I've found so far.  I mean, under $5 for an Italian beef or a gyro???  When I got the pizza slice and the IB, I only paid like $8.50 or so.  ONE salad costs that much at some places.  \nThere is not a whole lotta room inside and seems to fill up quick, but there is seating outside too. \nSo to sum it up, If you didn't bring a lunch to work and have about $5, you can go here and have a tasty lunch.  A neat place.", "business_id": "If2DUhmWIvlu2JFc_rR-Bw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-10-22", "type": "review"}

It is easily among the best fried chicken in Phoenix, they also have a great all you can eat deal on Wednesdays. The chicken is crispy and flavorful right until the last bite due to the marinade. If it has an issue it is that it may be too salty for the more salt sensitive people out there, but IMO, it is far from overwhelming, and each bite has a combination of flavors.

Parking was a bit tight and not a lot of spaces in general but was luckily able to snatch one. There are two sides to enter, one for to-go and one for eat in. I walked inside and the d\u00e9cor was so cute, very vintage meets farmhouse feel. They wanted to stick me at a long table with another party of 2 but felt awkward so I went to sit up at the bar, since there weren't any small tables to choose from. Service was very fast, ordered a diet coke but received a coca cola \"light\", which in my opinion does not taste like diet coke. Oh well. \n\nI read their menu (which is VERY limited) and looked on their board for the specials of the day. There were a total of 4 sandwiches, 4 salads and 2-3 \"bar size\" options to choose from and that's all. Only 2 of the options had meat in them so I was a bit disappointed with that and neither option was what I wanted. I ultimately ordered the market sandwich, which was a roasted tomato, arugula and goat cheese on focaccia bread. I think the servers were bored because it wasn't busy and they kept circling around waiting for something to do, very weird. Maybe I noticed it more because I was alone? Anyways, I got my food within 5 minutes and it came with a tiny serving of coleslaw, which was made with apples and red onions. The sandwich was fine but nothing amazing...coleslaw was different but ate it in like 3 bites. I was still hungry after my lunch so decided to order the flourless chocolate cake for dessert...couldn't pass that up! It was really great, came with a vanilla bean cream on top to balance out the richness of the cake. I got the bill and it was $22 so not cheap...the market sandwich with no meat on it was $12! Yikes. \n\nAll in all, I just came to realize that Pane Bianco is just not for me. I know they have great ingredients and does have a certain appeal, very downtown. I did notice the dinner options and was curious if dinner time is a better time to go, since options were things I actually wanted to eat (stuffed peppers, posole, pasta, pizza).

Eating healthy has now becoming a part of my lifestyle. I was told this place was a sister company of another restaurant. \nIt's kinda hidden when we first pulled up next to a bicycle shop. They had a patio out front which was a nice option if you didn't want to eat inside. I didn't know what to expect before entering but when I entered the place, it seemed as if I was taken back in time. I was a little confused at what I've heard and the mental thought I already had, and the incorporation that was now in front of me. It was like an old, vintage, antique-ish, theme. (Maybe this shop is like those in Italy?) One side was to-go and other side was dine in with tables. It wasn't a busy lunch day but maybe half the tables were filled with people during this time. It was quiet, no music, and the sounds of your table neighbors.  I like this for the fact that you can actually talk and hear your lunch dates. The tables were already set with fork, knife, napkin, and menu. Presented a nice clean atmosphere.  They had a chalkboard up against the wall that noted the all the daily special, in this case lunch specials including meals and drinks. Our waitress was so kind to read and tell us the daily special. Looking through the menu, it wasn't so detailed with descriptions of what was inside each sandwhich or salad. Since it was a new place for me to try, I was all game for what the surprise would be. They had their sandwhich and salads and veggie soup in the front and drinks in the back. I heard their sandwhiches are pretty scrumptious but I was in the mood for eating like a rabbit, so I opted for a salad. I ended up getting the 2 wash ranch salad I believe is the name? As far as my date, he had the special pulled beef sandwhich and their square pieces of appetizer pizza.\nTo my surprise my salad was loaded. It came with a piece of bread wrapped in brown paper that reminded me that you would wrap fish if you were to get from a market. The salad had lots of dark mixed greens which had already been tossed in their dressing (delicious, but i cant figure out exactly what is in it!) and they had sliced one fresh tomato in half (which still had the vines on it) and a scoop of what looked like their version of chicken salad. Inside their chicken salad was tiny chops of chicken with red onion, celery, quinoa, and possibly minced parsely or basil? It was very delicous, light, refreshing, and made my tummy full and satisfied. Also, food came out quick. I think after ordering, it literally might have came out 7 min later. That was quite impressing. I would def recommend for people to try and I am definitely coming back for seconds another day, next time I'll try their sandwhiches.", "business_id": "-AAig9FG0s8gYE4f8GfowQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-10-17", "type": "review"}

The pizza is passable but not a million miles from a toasted lavash cracker, the beer is all right, and the pizza cookie is pretty good (it's basically a cookie half-baked in a deep-dish pizza pan). \n\nThe problem with Oregano's is that it's something of a victim of its own success. They don't accept reservations no matter what the occasion, and there's almost always a wait. I've yet to figure out why, because it's really not all that. Unfortunately, I have friends who like it, and my polite requests to go elsewhere aren't always properly considered.\n\nOregano's relies on gimmicks--swing music, gigantic menus that are awkward to hold, and cutesy names for the pizzas. Sports fans take note: There is no cable TV.  When I  politely asked if they could turn on the Suns game (this was playoffs time, mind you), I was sternly told that Oregano's is not a sports bar. God forbid anything should distract customers from the frighteningly chirpy wait staff. \n\nSo after waiting a good long while to be seated, expect to be led through a gauntlet of manufactured greetings and well-wishing on the way to your table.

I have eaten here tons of times and every experience with the food and service is the best ever.  I have had the Alfredo the Dark (fettuccine alfredo), the big beef sandwich, the big tuna sandwich, and now chicken wings and pizza.  The alfredo is so creamy and flavorful with a bit of spicy to it.  I remember not being able to finish the gigantic plate of noodles.  The beef sandwich makes my mouth water just thinking about it but my table was craving to share pizza and wings today so we ordered the pepperoni pizza thin crust and it was truly amazing.  The garlic was perfect the crust was and cheese were a great consolidation of flavor.  The chicken wings were great also, the sauce was a little thick and had a garlic hint to it as well.  Of coarse what would a visit to Oregano's without ordering a macadamia nut pazookie!  Man, this place is the best place for the cookie desert with ice cream, the half cooked cookie inside a good 10\" pan and about 1/2\" thick is so flavorful and good.  I almost got sick from eating to much.  Also if you have never been to an Oregano's be prepared to wait since they are always busy, the atmosphere is way casual and the decor is so very cool and trendy.

My friend and I were going there about once a month for a year and a half while we were in school. I had never been here so she introduced me. I have now been there several times and this is my favorite of the locations. The tasters I've tried are the toasted ravioli espaniol, boom dip, guaca tony, and Lawrence's stuffed mushrooms.  The ravioli is divine with a nice kick in the cheese and the marinara is my favorite of all of the the marinaras I have tasted.  The boom dip is rich and creamy and the chips are actually a thin crust pizza with cheese on top, there are no words to describe how absolutely wonderful it is.  The guaca tony has the same thin crust pizza to smear guac on and from what I hear the guac is phenomenal, stupid allergies prohibit me tasting.  The stuffed mushrooms are more of a meal than a taster and are a lot meatier than I had imagined but was rich and delicious.  If you get tasters just know that they are huge and that if you plan on dessert it is important to have plenty of people to share with unless you plan on not eating lunch/dinner. \nIn regards to the wings my husband has thoroughly enjoyed the wings of fire and says that they are a different kind of hot more black pepper than hot sauce hot.  He says that they were surprising but that they were a good change.  \nThe salads are like everything else on the menu huge and a little different.  The Julius Caesar has a dressing that is Caesar with a little bit of a different kick.  I normally ask for extra dressing but there was flavor in every bite.  When you add chicken it is finally sliced and you can never get a bite without the chicken, I usually share this with my daughter because it is just to big for one person.  My husband has said that the big beefstro and the antipasto thing are both the best salads he has ever had.  This is high praise since he tends to not like going out.  Every time we have gone out since he compares every salad he comes in contact with the salads from Oregano's and so his taste for other salads has become ruined.  My father-in-law says that the southwestern shrimp caesar is better than he ever imagined.  The shrimp was so tasty that even I liked it and my daughter started trying to steal salad.  \nWe have tried two of the sandwiches sort of on accident.  The Italian stuffed and the fresh grilled Italian sausage.  My mother-in-law meant to order the fresh grilled Italian sausage but accidentally said the Italian stuffed and when it came out she said it was delicious but that she wanted the sausage and mentioned it to the waitress.  The waitress reordered the sausage sandwich and wrapped it up for her to take home and didn't even charge us for it.  I think this really says something about the level of customer service that I have seen every time we go.  We all tasted both and my mother-in-law who is rarely impressed has suggested this place numerous times based on this, oh and dessert. \nThe pizzas are great. I normally don't like the thin crust but feel that they pack a lot in. I read in a review that the Aunt Margarita had no flavor which I thought was odd. It definitely isn't as greasy as some of the pizzas but it has some darn good flavor. The tomatoes are always done just right to give you that juicy tomato quality.\nMy daughter always gets the pasta with the pesto sauce.  She loves the pesto and enjoys the pesto penne bake.  I truly love the ziti since it is flavorful and huge enough for three meals.  I don't really like their Alfredo the dark but it isn't the worst alfredo that I have had.  \nFor dessert I have only ever had their pizza cookie and don't see any reason to change this in the future.  I have had pizza cookie at many places but non that are even close to as yummy as the ones her at Oregano's.  \nYou will definitely find me at an Oregano's again soon.", "business_id": "ML1RJdeZ7bbfMrHvJ7m99A", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-11-06", "type": "review"}

He said the pepperoni thin pizza, rigatoni and salad were his very favorite.\n\nOn our first Sunday evening in Phoenix, we make it priority to have dinner here. He did warn us that it's a very busy place.  So we arrived after 8pm and coincidentally parked right in front of the \"welcome\" sign. Again the parking gods were looking after us. If's most unusual for us to be offered water while waiting outdoors for our table. As it turns out we eventually get seated outdoor at a bar table for two. This is where we meet our server Lucas along with his manager Jonny (yes, it's not a misspelling).\n\nTold them that our PDX hotel concierge had been touting about their entrees. We proceeded to order the following mindful that we're intentionally over ordering and that the servings are huge in portions:\n\n- Jr Pablo Picasso Salad\n- Big Rig Pasta adding two meatballs to this rigatoni dish\n- Numero One-0 12\" thin crust pizza\n\nI think we had to be careful not to attempt to finish everything that was in front of us. It was all very very good. As a welcome to Phoenix gesture, Jonny treated us to their Pizza Cookie Chocolate Chip with chocolate mint Ice cream. By the time we were ready to hit the bed, it was very close to closing time.\n\nNote:  The pizza didn't make it past bedtime.  In the meanwhile it was salad and Big Rig for lunch the next day.  My classmates keep looking me as if I was a meal on wheels.\n\nOTHER TRIP\n\nDidn't know that our class would run so late that it eliminated many of our restaurants we had listed that closed at 8pm and 9pm.  Intentionally we keep a number of them along the 16th Street corridor.\n\nSo Yu-go chauffeur says let's go back to Oregano's and say hi to Jonny and Lucas.  This time we're seated indoors where its quite cool with all the red and green.  Asked Jonny to recommend something other than what we had tried previously.  This time we're more conscious of portions.\n\n- Junior sized Beefstro Salad that's spicy\n- Clark Street Meat 12\" thin crust pizza\n- Pizza Cookie Chocolate Chip with two different flavors of ice cream (told Jonny that we would buy our dessert this time. He still comped us)\n\nWhen it was all said and done, there was nothing to take back to the hotel.\n\nMANGA TALE\n\nThe pizza crust is flat bread thin and crispy so that we didn't feel like we were filling up with pizza dough.. Perhaps I would instruct them to cook it for a few seconds longer just to ensure that the crust remained crispy throughout our eating experience.

They have all the similar do-dads hanging on the walls and the menu is gigantic.\n\nOrdered my favorite Rib Eye Salad in the biggest size they have. They call it The Big Beefstro Salad on the menu and it is really good. The dressing has a sweet Serrano Pepper flavor going on and it is pretty spicy. This one was so big I had to bring some home for later.\n\nMy friends ordered the Pablo Picasso Mexico Salad and it was giant. They also were excited about the size and had to ask for a box for the leftovers as well.\n\nService was very friendly and we experienced several greetings. They even opened the doors as we both entered and left the building. We were surprised by the large amount of take out orders that were waiting for people to pick them up.\n\nLooking forward to trying out some pizza again and possibly checking out their famous all Original Pizza Cookie with Ice Cream.

Being from Chicago, I craved some really good deep dish pizza and saw this place made it, so I stopped in.\nParking was tight. Small parking lot in the back with little to no parking on a busy night...\nThere was a half hr wait but we seated instantly at the bar. Not my ideal seating but I don't like waiting, so it is what it is.\nBartender was friendly. Tried the Belini? An alcoholic slushi drink someone else had posted a picture of. I could be completely wrong on the name. Wasn't as strong as I'd like, but tasty.\nWe got a big caesar salad to start. Was big enough for two people. Was just ok...kind of dry in my opinion. Definitely could've used more dressing. Probably wouldn't get again- their other salads look a lot better anyways.\nSomehow in all this, we changed our minds about deep dish (sorry chi town), and went with a \"make your own\" thin crust. I got sausage, pepperoni, spiced feta, roasted garlic, and spinach on my half and my husband got sausage, pepperoni, garlic, and bacon on his.\nI was a little worried about my choices and how they'd turn out shortly after we placed the order. Those ingredients can definitely overwhelm a pizza. The wait was usual...half hr maybe?\nLemme tell you.....that pizza was one of the best pizzas I've ever eaten.......they didn't put TOO much of each topping, so you didn't get too much of one flavor overpowering another (aka garlic or feta). Everything blended perfectly and was so stinkin delicious I never wanted it to end......my husband loved his just as much. \nOverall for the salad, pizza, 2 beers, 2 \"specialty\" drinks, and a tip....the final bill came to around $77. Kind of expensive in my opinion. Adding your own toppings individually can get kind of pricey so I'd probably get a pizza off the menu choices next time? Even though the make your own combo I got was DIVINE....\nI'm giving this place 4 stars because despite some minor setbacks, the pizza was absolutely PERFECT.

If I had written this Friday night and they didn't offer good vegan options it could have easily been a 1 star review.\n\nThe funny part of this saga is I had completely forgotten about my prior review which had to do with Pizza Heaven figuring out orders with different toppings, charges, etc. \n\nRecently I have been complaining about how expensive Z pizza has been getting, Pizza Heaven's location is closer and I thought would be cheaper so here goes; round two.\n\nThe order: 3 topping large pizza with vegan cheese, on their menu listed for $17.50. When I arrived to pick up the pie I was told \" That will be $27.?? \" What?!?! \"No, I just had a 3 topping pizza, just one...nothing else\".\n\nThis is where the discussion began on how they charge for toppings, apparently their policy is to rip people off? I think we all learned in the 4th grade (ok maybe not) if you put 3 toppings on one half and 3 toppings on the second half you have used the same amount of toppings for the pie - the toppings may be different yes, but the net amount of toppings used (and might I add purchased by the establishment) is still the same. Since my girlfriend can't stand onions, and I hate those little black olives we each had our own side of 3 toppings each BUT...get this....were charged for 6 toppings! Recap: no more toppings were used total on the pizza but because they were all different apparently they have made it a policy to charge for 6 toppings. The vegan cheese was also an extra $2 but not listed on their menu online (or at the restaurant). \n\nThey ended up comping me for one topping and I didn't throw too much of a fight because I knew I would not be coming back anytime soon. Once I got home and tried the pizza it did nothing more then seal the deal. It wasn't the worse pizza but it was mediocre at best.\n\nI don't feel great about writing this review, I really want to love and support independent businesses in Phoenix but when they have crazy policies like this and I have to spend $27+ to get a large mediocre pizza I need to draw the line somewhere. Phoenix has very few vegan pizza options but right now it seems like the corporate giants win again - I can get a large surfboard vegan pizza at Whole Foods, with any 3 toppings on any half, which tastes great for $15.99; no hassles.\n\nLastly I would like to comment that the girl working the cashier was very friendly and very courteous even though I was displaying clear signs of being utterly appalled. Even when I left she was still very friendly, it's safe to say she saved this from being a one star review, kudos to you.", "business_id": "auorqdHiATGZHVd-sd79ZQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-11-08", "type": "review"}

It's a small establishment with a compact parking lot, and both were jam-packed. Luckily, someone was leaving as I was pulling into the lot, so I was able to grab a spot. (I don't know if they have an overflow lot, but they should.) \n\nOnce inside, I quickly observed the \"Please Wait to be Seated\" sign.  We were asked how many were in our party, after which the hostess/waitress (they seem to be one in the same) scurried off to assess the availability.  As said earlier, it was packed, and there were others also waiting.  I was thinking we'd have to wait forever and that my starving spirit animal would come bursting out of my abdomen, like in those beef jerky commercials. But we ended up waiting no more than about 5 minutes before we were shown to a booth. (I love booths!)\n\nDESIGNATED VEGAN MENU:\nThere's a vegan menu inserted inside of their regular menu.  The waitress said that patrons keep taking them out, so if you want the vegan menu and don't see it, just ask for one. \nThe vegan options include appetizers, hot stuffed sandwiches, pasta, calzone, pizzas, and desserts.  It wasn't listed on the menu, but they also have a vegan cheesecake, which you can get topped with chocolate syrup or mixed berry sauce. \n\n\nMy order:\nVeggieballs in buffalo hot sauce -  They are described as vegan meatballs, so I'm thinking faux-beef \"meat\" balls. I was pleasantly surprised when I cut into one and found actual vegetables: peas, string beans, carrots, & corn. They were positively delicious. A slightly crispy coating covered in a proper buffalo sauce, which had a legit heat level. Excellent dish for only $5.95. Comes w/ vegan ranch and carrot sticks. \n\nVegan Spaghetti with soy sausage, $8.50 - (Beautiful presentation.) The pasta noodles were cooked perfectly al dente. The sauce and the soy sausage were bland, however.  Aside from flavor, I don't know what to say that it was lacking. A dash of this? A splash of that? Not sure, but it was a pretty big boring bowl of blah. I kept furiously twirling my fork in the saucy mix, thinking that maybe the flavor was at the bottom somewhere, clicking its heels thrice and trying to get back home, but no luck. If you avoid salt/seasoning (and flavor), as well as meat, then this is your dish. I liked the vegan garlic bread though. \n\n\nDessert-\nVegan cheesecake w/ mixed berry sauce, $6.50 - I never ate cheese before going vegan, but I used to eat cheesecake (weird, I know), so I do have something with which to compare vegan versions. I have had some better-than-real-cheesecake vegan cheesecakes, but this isn't one of them. I did not like it. The cheesecake had a weird, grainy, earthy taste to it. And it was like, almost smooth & creamy, (*singing* Ooooh, we're 1/2 way theeeere...) but it didn't quite make it there.  Silver lining? The crust and mixed berry sauce were both good.\n\nAngel bites, $4.95 - (If you've ever been to France or New Orleans, think beignets, except here, they are vegan.) They cover theirs with cinnamon and powdered sugar, and they offer you one of 3 dipping sauces: agave, chocolate, or caramel. (The caramel is NOT vegan, fyi.) I chose the chocolate. O-M-G. These suitably named bites of awesomeness brought me life. They came out hot, fresh & ready to be devoured. This is one of those treats that you want to eat right away because you know they won't taste the same later. But they give you so many! (Which is a great thing!) You can easily share this dessert with 2 or more people.\n\n\nNon vegan:\nMy non-veggie DD got the Mozzarella Sticks as an appetizer, and the Cajun Chicken Alfredo pasta w/ shrimp added. She liked the pasta, but said it was definitely spicy.  \n\n\n\nNice ambience, especially for dates. I don't know if they take reservations, but I suggest asking, especially for busy weekend nights.  As busy as they were, the staff was still nice and attentive. The owner was making rounds and asking patrons how their meals were. Cool little bistro. Great for vegans dining with omnivores.  I'll go back for more buffalo Veggieballs and Angel Bites.", "business_id": "auorqdHiATGZHVd-sd79ZQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-09-28", "type": "review"}

I also got fried zucchini as an appetizer and it was deliciously fresh. Be careful to not burn your tongue because everything will be hot and freshly made.

Definitely a run down, hole in the wall type of place with a musty smell and a decor I'm sure hasn't ever changed in the decades this place has existed.  \n\nFive of us came in on Saturday night on a whim to \"try something different\" from our usual haunts.  Boy was this place different!  We sat in the bar area where several tvs were showing the cards preseason game, and one muted tv was on the sound of music...\n\nThere were 3 or 4 other parties in the bar area, average age was approx 68.  Fortunately none of them really had any problem with our obnoxious drunkenness.  Not sure how many people were in the dining room portion of the restaurant, but suffice it to say the place was far from empty, which is always a good sign.  But there was only 1 bartender/waitress working in the bar area, and though we were more than patient and amiable, she was still very flustered with her duties.  Eh, we were drunk and didn't care.\n\nOn to the food.  We ordered the eggplant rollatini and mozz sticks to start, a pizza, manicotti, chicken parm, and fettuccine alfredo.  Everything was pretty good, huge portioned, relatively cheap, traditional italian(-american) food.  It really hit the spot!  The marinara sauce was incredible, and the manicotti was bursting with ricotta.  The pizza was good, the chicken parm standard (the spaghetti was cooked perfectly al dente), and the fettuccine was probably the loser of the group (my meal, of course) - it was good, but not as creamy as I had hoped.\n\nAll in all, this was exactly the type of experience we expected and went looking for.

One can choose from shrimp, vegetable, and chicken as toppings. \n\nThe flat screens allowed me to enjoy the baseball game while enjoying $2 beer. The \"bar\" area allows for friendly, quiet conversation or just a getaway from \"trendy\" and \"crowded\" bars. The friendliness and prompt service provided a world class style of service.

I'm not a vegetarian by any means (see my review of Blue Nile for proof), I just strongly prefer veggies on my pizza. I feel the tastes compliment each other better, and it's also much prettier. Neither of us is a big fan of compromise, so splitting a pizza is usually a challenge. \n\nNYPD took the pain out of pizza for us. We ordered a 14\" 5-topping and our AMAZING server let us know that, if we so desired, we could do 5 toppings on one half and 5 DIFFERENT toppings on the other, at no additional charge. I wanted to kiss her feet. I don't think she realized how far we would take it though, as our respective halves did not share one topping. That's right, we don't mess around. At this point in the meal, my Yelp rating of NYPD was 5 stars. Of course, I still had to eat the pizza.   \n\nIt is utterly confusing to me how so many places can claim to serve \"New York\" pizza and fail miserably, while almost every pizza place actually located in New York manages to pull it off. It's as if something magical happens when pizza is prepared in a new york zip code, and it's nearly impossible to recreate. But people keep trying. NYPD did not successfully recreate New York pizza. However, for Arizona pizza NYPD is definitely up there. And no, I've never waited 4 hours for pizza.\n\nFour stars for the food and cute, albeit somewhat gimmicky, ambiance. Five stars for the service. Our server was incredible, and they even gave us a gift bag when we left! It had coupons and a magnet!

I had seen them on Eat24, but since picking up an order from them involves a 9 mile roundtrip, I hadn't gotten around to trying them until tonight.\n\nMy overall impression:  just OK.  I've had better, and I've had worse.  I ordered a medium pepperoni pizza, and the crust had a dense, pillowy texture that I didn't much care for.  The sauce, cheese and pepperoni on top of the crust were actually pretty tasty, though.  Inexplicably, there was a small section on my pizza that was completely devoid of cheese and pepperoni.\n\nOrdering with Eat24 was easy, although I should point out that there isn't an option for extra cheese on the menu.  I left my house within five minutes of ordering, and when I arrived at the restaurant my pizza had about two minutes to go, so the speed of service was fine.  The quality of service, however, was a bit lacking -- much of which I attribute to the fact that the counter guy was young and probably didn't have a lot of experience.\n\nAs for the value...honestly, it wasn't great.  Without the $2 online coupon I used, the medium 12 inch one-topping pizza I ordered would have cost $13.53, which is higher than what the pizza joints in my neighborhood charge for a comparable or higher quality product.  (Overpriced, average pizza could be one of the reasons I was the only customer inside the place at 7PM on a Saturday night...)\n\nWould I return?  Probably not.  Frank's is just too far of a drive for me when better and cheaper pizza is available closer to home.  But, as always, individual results may vary.  If you're in the neighborhood, you should give them a try at least once and decide for yourselves.", "business_id": "VWcaFOSFcDwmFquycBzFyQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-11-21", "type": "review"}

And yes, there is parking in the back.\n\n**Another note**:  The Market Bistro only takes reservations for parties of 5 or more.  Two of us went at 7:00 on a Tuesday night and were seated immediately.\n\nWhat we ate that we actually ordered:  Lobster bisque, salmon quesadillas, coq au vin, seafood skewers.\n\nWhat the server brought-- for free for us to try-- which we ate but hadn't ordered:  The butternut squash ravioli, mini pumpkin chocolate brownie with ice cream on top.  (And of course the mini croissants at the beginning of the meal.)\n\nEverything we ate was beyond fantastic, with one exception-- the seafood skewers were a little bland.  Not \"bad\" by any means, just not as flavorful as seafood can be.  The real standout was the butternut squash.  Our second favorite was the salmon quesadillas.  EXCELLENT.\n\nEven better:  our entire bill, including my friend's glass of wine and my soft drink, was $48!!\n\nI will go back again and again.

While formal French dining often has the reputation of being expensive and stuffy, everyday eating in France is not like this and Vincent's Market Bistro brings that traditional, French country dining style to the fore.\n\nWe were there with my in-laws, our kids, and my brother-in-law and his boyfriend and we were certainly not the youngest group there. In fact, there was another table composed entirely of kids from St. Francis elementary school and Brophy / Xavier high schools.\n\nYou have the choice of a prix fixe menu for $25 or individual items, but nothing is too expensive. \n\nWe started with appetizers including the smoked salmon quesadilla, the tomato and mozarella salad, and even introduced the kids to escargot, which they liked!\n\nFor the main course, I had the coq au vin and others had the duck confit, four cheese ravioli, wood fired pizzas, and beef bourguignon. Everyone enjoyed their meals and service was excellent. \n\nAs we finished up, our server, unprompted by us, brought out a selection of complimentary desserts that everyone enjoyed.\n\nIf you're looking for a nice, affordable, evening on the town with great food and great service, head over to Vincent's Market Bistro and you'll leave feeling like you've just spent a great evening in the South of France.", "business_id": "oc0Wl6ktfMLb5VZ2Uz6M2A", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-10-19", "type": "review"}

Hardly any pizza places west of the Empire state building use oregeno and I have very rarely spotted this true symbol of NY pizza.

It could use just a bit of the orange grease that is also a NY tradition, but otherwise it was a great effort to replicate the Big Apple Classic. The cheese was not overwhelming, easily foldable and the cheese actually stuck to the sauce (sounds weird), but you just have to have eaten a million slices in NY to know what I'm talking about. Only about $12 for a 14\" cheese pie and even better and crispier when heated up. I also tried a Chicken parmesan hero which was top notch containing nicely breaded cutlets nestled in a italian roll with plenty of tasty red sauce and a good dose of melted cheese on top which also had oregeno dusted in for effect. THis is a really small pizzeria, but they are cranking out what so far has become the closest to NY style I have seen in Arizona yet.

Seems like the quality of the food has changed and the inside is just like the pizza.......boring.

We decided to get delivery and called to order pizza and wings. We ordered a special they had for a large pizza with two toppings plus 30 wings, and added a small Hawaiian pizza. The guy on the phone was VERY nice - we had a lot of questions and requested sauces on the side. Unlike many places you call in an order, he was very friendly, accommodating, patient and helpful. We really appreciated this.\n\nWe ordered a large pizza with two toppings - pepperoni on the whole pizza and half of it also with meatballs. This was perfectly executed and tasty. The crust and dough was perfectly cooked - fluffy and fresh with a little crisp. The pepperonis were tasty with the right amount of spice, and the meatballs were flavorful without being spicy. They had a fair amount of black pepper but it wasn't overwhelming. The pepperonis were thinly sliced and laid on top of the cheese and pepperoni - well balanced and easy to eat! The other pizza was a small Hawaiian without sauce --- sadly, it had NO pineapple on it. How do you forget the pineapple on a Hawaiian. Since it was delivery, there was nothing we could do. So, we ate what equated to cheesy bread with Canadian bacon on it.  \n\nWe also had 30 wings with medium sauce on the side - and ordered them extra crispy. They were perfectly cooked and the medium sauce was good (when getting delivery or to go, getting the sauce on the side keeps them crispy!) It included two small (2 ounce) ramekins of ranch, so we ordered 6 extra (which was only 30 cents each, much cheaper than the nearby Stumpy's cost for ranch).\n\nThe Hawaiian (well, cheesy bread with Canadian bacon...) pizza's crust was much thinner and crispier than the large pizza. Just something to note - the crust was completely crusty. Which is fine, just know it wasn't soft like on the large. We were quoted 35-40 mins and paid cash... But it arrived closer to 25 mins. I do recommend this place. Despite the goof on the small pizza, the friendly service, quail delivery and wing quality leaves me with 4 solid stars.\n\nIf this review helped, let me know with the voting buttons.

I went to the store to pick up a bottle of Peachy Canyon Zin, and grabbed my pizza on the way back home. HOLY COW, my pizza was huge! Oh well, I'll have leftovers. It seemed like it took forever to get home because the pizza's aroma wafted through my car and drove me crazy! I got home opened the box, and marveled at the sight of my yummy pizza. The pizza is not sliced into triangles, rather, they are sliced into squares. I grabbed a couple squares and noticed the GREASE that oozed through the cheese on the pizza. Uh oh. I grabbed a few paper towels and firmly patted my pizza. I thought to myself \"This is one greasy pizza! This is going to be awesome!\" I felt guilty and rebellious taking the first bite of my pizza. I was immediately struck by the sweetness of their sauce! It wasn't too terribly sweet, but I must say I like a slightly sweet red sauce. It may catch some people off guard. The meat on the pizza was delicious! The sausage was flavorful and I think it's home-made. I ended up sticking the leftovers in the freezer for future indulgence.

I even once looked into shipping Aurelio's for a birthday present and quickly realized that that was insanely expensive. \n\nFast forward to this summer when I discovered a review on Yelp that mentioned that there used to be an Aurelio's here in AZ that eventually became Spinato's. Well my husband insisted that we get in the car that moment and check it out. The sweet marinara is exactly what he was looking for and while not exactly the same this is the closest pizza in Arizona to his beloved favorite.

When she finally did, 20 minutes after the pizza, they were free.  But still, she was hungry.  The service didn't take away from the fact that the pizza was SOOOO cheesey and delicisous.

But I recommend making it a little more fun by adding mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, and tomato. The salads are tasty and come in a good sized portion... For example, a side salad is good for 2, entree is good for 2-3. My go to pizza is the Mamma Spinato's which includes spinach, tomatoes, garlic, and toasty cheese tossed with love! I always add onions for that extra kick.. Pizzas can be shared and split into 2 different combinations (they even separate it with a line of tomato sauce so you know which is which) dessert is the only department they lack in.. Cannoli's are no bueno :( the dough tastes old and the cream filling is too sweet.  Overall, this is definitely on my top favorite list of restaurants in the valley..

As I asked her a few basic questions I didn't get the the most speediest of replies that I would like.

So at the end of the ordering process I asked her to repeat my order and she did and I felt OK. At the beginning I asked if there were specials and she told me but when it came time to pay the price was significantly different, she had to get a manager because \"she did not know what was going on?\" Ok whatever I thought lets just get this done I have a house full of hungry friends LOL! So it was done and they deliver- 30-45 minutes that's pretty reasonable I thought. An hour and 25 minutes later there was a knock on the door...FINALLY FOOD!!!!

I didn't have the energy to call and complain so we just sucked it up and made pb and j's. The girl on the telephone had us starving.

He then went on to say that my note said extra sauce and since I didn't pay they didn't put it on. Yet A) my note never said \"extra\" and B) I always got the phone call from them in the past saying if you want extra sauce you have to pay the driver 50 cents. No phone call this time. I assumed that my directions in basic English would be clear to the average Pizza Hut worker. He said it's how they \"interpret\" the note.\n\nThere is another Pizza Hut location closer to me, but for some reason this is the one that is assigned my address for delivery. Apparently the credit that they wanted to give me for the blue cheese is only good if I order from their location again. What a joke. I told them to not bother with the credit and hung up.\nI guess from now on we will only be eating Pizza Hut if we want to pick up our order, since we're done with this location for good.", "business_id": "zwJX3eetOhpi-gv4-E4rcQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-10-17", "type": "review"}

I have been ordering from this location for maybe a year or so and always get the gluten free pizza. Well I guess we've never ordered on a rainy-ish Friday night because our pizzas took well over an hour to arrive, which was stated when we ordered on our iPhone app. When they arrived, the driver neglected to bring us our Pepsi. Wish I would have realized it before I left him a very generous tip. But as soon as I did, I ran down the driveway after him (in my jammies no less) and he said he'd bring it right back. We live about 1 mile from the store. We were starving so dug right in but were very disappointed because they were cold. I mean not even warm, at all, simply downright cold. We only had a couple pieces and were finished when the Pepsi arrived. I briefly talked to the driver about our displeasure and he said to call the manager. I did. I talked to Alexander who, when I asked to speak to a manager, asked why. I gave him the sitch. I was on a brief hold when Alexander came back and said all the managers were too busy to talk to me. Okay I get it, it's a busy Friday night and maybe they're short staffed or whatever, but you should never be too busy to talk to a customer who is unhappy. And who orders frequently. I mean, I just spent $30 on 2 cold and quite frankly, not very delicious pizzas, and you can't come to the phone and offer to make things right? Really. I told Alexander exactly how I felt about this, stated that I would be Yelping and ended the call. \nI have ordered from other locations in the past and managers usually acknowledge when they've made mistakes and customers are unhappy. It's rare that I've been unhappy with this chain in the past, but when I have been, they've always been willing to make it up to me. This location was clearly not interested in making things right and is hugely disappointing. And because of that mistake I will no longer order from this location. I am happy to go to another pizza establishment that caters to customers and quite frankly has better pizza.

We happened along this place by accident while enjoying a \"stay-cation\" at a local resort. We were starving and not looking to pay resort prices for dinner. A quick little drive and we saw a sign that said pizza. The best accident we had! \nLocation is in a strip mall and not terribly inviting, but go anyway because once you hit the front door it's like you walked into a friends house. Great smell from the kitchen and a small little bar with plenty of good beverages and cold beer. \nSo take a look at the menu, ask for suggestions. The sausage is homemade and fantastic. My favorite crust is the thinner \"crispier\" crust. and there is no expense spared on toppings smothering edge to edge. So if you like to actually enjoy your toppings & sauce not just get a mouthful of dough this is your place. \n\nWord of warning, everything is big! The small salad easily feeds three & do try the garlic ranch dressing. The spaghetti is good, with homemade meatballs and the sauce...well let's just say the sauce is more of a sweet sauce full of taste and not just tomato paste. So our favorite pizza has quickly become the peperoni & sausage. We like to add sweet peppers too. But really you can go wrong. And even the Margarita pizza is outstanding. \n\nWe have dined in & they deliver. Just got to the website & place a web order.

I was browsing their website and one of my coworkers saw my computer screen.  He gave me the thumbs up and told me that Spinatos was his favorite.  I decided to try it out.  I called in my order for an 11 inch Mama Spinatos Signature Spinach Pizza.  Drove down and picked it up.  Here is how it was.......\n\nSpinach Pizza-  I parked my car in a random lot and decided to dig in.  The pizza is Chicago style thin crust.  They cut it into small triangles and squares.  It looked amazing.  It was topped with cheese, spinach, tomatoes and garlic.  The ingredients were fresh as can be plus they were plentiful.   The taste was great!  The sauce was a little sweet, the cheese was melted nice, the spinach and tomatoes were awesome plus it had a nice garlic punch too.  The crust was just alright though.  It was a little too soft for my liking.  Maybe because it was for pickup?  Maybe it had too many toppings?  It wasn't horrible but if it was more crispy, it would have been way better than it already was.\n\nService was extremely friendly on the phone and during pickup.  Bonus points for having fantastic napkins!  They are basically 2\u00d72 squares of thick paper towel like napkins.  Possibly the best napkins I have ever been issued for a takeout spot lol.  I will be back to try out some other pizzas in the near future...probably dine in to see if the crust is crisper.  Overall, I was impressed though.  It was a very good pizza!", "business_id": "pF7uRzygyZsltbmVpjIyvw", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-09-10", "type": "review"}

We got there and found out that there was an hour and a half wait.  Forget that!  I talked my wife into coming down here to Spinatos.  I had gotten a pizza from here a week or so ago and it was pretty delicious.  We drove down here and decided to eat here.  We walked in and were seated outside on the patio right away.  We went with a Greek Salad and a medium pizza with pepperoni and garlic.  Pepsi products to drink.  Here is how the food tasted...................\n\nGreek Salad-  We got the \"entree\" sized salad and it was plenty for the two of us.  This thing was packed with lettuce, feta, tons of split olives, pepperocinis, onions etc.  We each had about 2 plate fulls worth.  Their dressing is delicious.  Creamy but not layered on heavy.  It was a great salad.\n\nPepperoni and Garlic Pizza-  My last pizza from here was for pickup.  It was a bit soggy when I got it.  When you eat in, it turned out to be much better.  Still a tiny bit greasy, but still delicious.  Our pizza was cooked proper with a little brown on the cheese.  Their sauce is fantastic and the pepperoni and garlic was a great combo.  Their sauce is a tad sweet but not too much so.  A medium pizza is perfect for two people.  Its a great Chicago thin crust.  I definitely want to try out some of their other offerings. \n\nThe reason I am giving this 5 stars though is because of the service!  The hostess was great, our waitress was on point and when we were leaving, everyone wished us a great evening and thanked us for our business.  Speaking of that..........while we were waiting for our check, an older gentleman came walking around asking tables how everything was.  It turns out that it was the OG himself...Ken Spinato!   The guy who started this place back in the 70s.  We chatted for awhile and got into a good conversation about our move from San Diego and how we were going to go to Grimaldis but came here instead.  He was impressed that we had driven from Surprise to come here.  We had a great conversation about pizza, their sauce, Phoenix in general etc.  It was a great way to end the night.  I'll be honest...Grimaldis is still my favorite pizza in the Phoenix area, but Spinatos is definitely creeping up the ladder.  Definitely the best Chicago style thin crust I have ever had, plus the service and overall friendliness of ALL the employees I have encountered will keep me and the family coming back!  I can definitely see why they are a Phoenix institution and why people love them so much.  It was a great 5th anniversary and I'm glad we spent it eating dinner here at Spinatos!", "business_id": "pF7uRzygyZsltbmVpjIyvw", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-09-20", "type": "review"}

Makes me forget Ledo's Pizza, which was my previous favorite. Have eaten here several times and never fails to deliver the goods.\n\nThe atmosphere is kind, though sitting outside is preferred. Sets the mood for the food. Inside can get noisy. But with some chianti, or a seasonal brew, add a dinner salad and you'll be on your way to not caring ville. I have been told to never go on a Friday. Saturdays are very cozy though, once the dinner rush dies down. If you go around 8-9 you should be good. \n\nObviously food is a matter of taste. Literally. I have heard their calzones are to die for but I can't seem to get away from the pizza. I used to enjoy the get meaty pizza but the garlic started to get me where it hurts a little too much. Have recently discovered something called The Super Six and this seems to be the one that hits the spot. My wife doesn't eat meat so she enjoys the \"other mama's.\" This shall be your first lesson. There is \"Mama's\" and \"Other Mama's.\"  These are good for the veg heads. Both good. Just different. Garlic fiends will want \"Mama's\" though. Carnivores will probably want to stick with the get meaty. The Super Six has most of those meats, minus the beef (and garlic too!), along with mushrooms and some peppers. The best of both worlds. An interesting side note is their lack of bacon. I love me some bacon. But being a rebel myself one has to respect anyone who bucks the trend. \n\nThe sauce is what makes this pizza so tasty. I'm a sauce guy, so there. Ledo's was the same way. You either love it or hate it. Have seen many that don't. I think it's the best though. To each their own. Give me good sauce, thin crust, fresh meat, lots of cheese and I'm good. Oh, and not sure where the cheese stands without specifying \"extra\" because we always do. But really now, who orders pizza without extra cheese?\n\nSpinato's is perfection every which way. Food, service, atmosphere. It's all here. With so many places down sizing their portions, changing their menu and skimping when it comes to service, after four plus years for me Spinato's seems to understand that not all change is good and only gets two thumbs up from me because I'm not a mutant and therefore can't give it more.", "business_id": "pF7uRzygyZsltbmVpjIyvw", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-09-21", "type": "review"}

Been here twice since the re-opening. Food service is rather slow. Both times the waitress did not pay enough attention to our table.

Use a coupon from the mailer? It better total at least $25.00 to the penny or you won't get your $5 off. Even if you mention at the start that you have the \"$25/$5 off with two drinks\" coupon, the waitresses will not tell you if you hit the $25 when you make your order unless you ask them to, and I don't trust them to do the math anyway. What's worse, none of the staff nor the manager has the latitude to honor the coupon if you fall a little short. One time we were denied use of the coupon because our order had totaled $24.95. A FREAKING NICKEL SHORT. We talked to the manager and it was very apparent it was not his call to make and that he would have gotten in trouble for cutting us a break.\n\nOn our first visit to the  re-opened Uncle Sam's,  the service was so painfully slow they should have - any good restaurant would have - comped us something.

That's right decades!! 50 years is no flash in the pan, in fact most restaurants fail to see a 20th birthday. There is a reason why Red Devil continues to grow throughout Arizona and the reason is quality. Everything is fresh. The pizza is awesome. I was born in Brooklyn, NY and I do really like pizza. I won't compore this to NY pizza because it is not. That being said I find it just as good as any pie I have ever had in NYC. The pizza stands alone! I have never had pizza that compares to Red Devil. The crust is not to thin and not to thick. One of my favorite parts is the outer crust, it's lite, it's got a little fluff and has a chew to it that makes it very unique and very delicious!!! All components to this pie are fresh. You can watch them \"open\" a pizza crust. That means you can stand in front of the pizza window and watch them take a giant dough ball and turn it into pizza crust by slapping it and throwing it in the air. \n So the Pizza is excellent; But how about the rest. What Red Devil does well is stay away from pretentiousness. The dishes are classic, simple and don't come out wearing sequins. I know what I'm getting when I dine here. The food speaks for itself. Like I said, it's Chicken Parmigian and I love it for what's on the inside!! The marsala dishes are very good. I will say that the Alfredo here is some of the best I have ever had. The only problem is that sometimes this sauce can \"break\" that happens when the butter and heavy cream seperate. When that has happened they take it back and make a new dish. The bottom line is this place is very good and continues to prove it by staying aroound through 3 recessions and continuing to grow.

In the past three years, Red Devil has declined in food quality and taste and the prices have sky rocketed. It has gotten to the point where we now push for our celebrations to take place somewhere else, because it has been a consistently disappointing experience for all of us.  Our visit today prompted my review - we once again visited Red Devil for a birthday celebration. We opted for a medium cheese people because if you opt for one of their specialties you're looking at about $15 for a medium - they also have pasta entrees that share the prices of a high quality Italian restaurant, which they are not. We were there with a group of about 10 people and the rest of the place was literally empty. It took them 15 minutes to get our drinks from the time we sat down and another 40 minutes for our food to arrive after we ordered it.

The service alone deserves 5 stars + and much praise.\n\n I was greeted immediately upon arrival by young man at the host stand. I was looking to sit at the bar, but it was Thursday night and football season, so there were no available seats. The young man not only walked around the bar to see if anything was available, but also searched around the restaurant to see if he could find me stool to squeeze in. He insisted I sit at one of the 3 large, patron-less booths in the bar area even though I was a party of one. Being in the business myself, I was hesitant, I didn't want a server to lose out to a party of 6 that could comfortably sit in this booth.\n\nAmber was my server. Amber was phenomenal. She greeted me with a comforting and inviting smile. I immediately told her I would move if she had other opportunities for the table, she insisted I stay even after room at the bar  opened up. Amber rattled off the specials with ease, ($2 pints, some good ones too, as  well other great specials during NFL games) gave great suggestions when I was between items ( I had fried zucchini there and a build your own calzone to go) and was amazingly, on top keeping my beer full, and making sure I had everything I needed. Again, I'll say Amber hit the nail on the head with her hospitality. \n\nThe restaurant is huge, clean, and inviting. The food was great, as was the atmosphere. Everyone had a smile on their face and was eager to help. Those are the reasons I'll be back, as well as sending many others their way. Ask for Amber! \n\nKudos Red Devil Bell Rd, and of course Amber, thank you for a great experience.", "business_id": "0gQrhOYWdO0XVZEKtOrvaA", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-10-03", "type": "review"}

I've been aware of Red Devil since the 70's, but I've always lived on the west side and had never visited before. Making plans with my Bestie, I decided this would be the day. We were going to a movie in Scottsdale anyway; let's have lunch at the original McDowell location....except the website sez they don't open until 3:00 on Sundays. Drats! Backup plan: visit the one on Bell Road!\n\nGreeted and seated without delay in a friendly fashion. Major props to Amber for excellent service throughout.\n\nThe bruschetta appetizer was huge. I expected, perhaps, 4 thin slices; this order was the size of Cleveland! Fresh tomatoes, fresh garlic, fat bread - deliciously presented.\n\nI would not have guessed that the soup of the day at an Italian joint might be clam chowder. Let that be a lesson to me, and yes, it was mighty tasty.\n\nB's order was pasta with white clam sauce. It comes with about 475 clams and just as much garlic as you care to request. Manna from heaven.\n\nI had seafood marinara with linguine. The sauce was perfect - not too thin or thick. Several Olympic-sized shrimp, and scallops one could shoot hoops with. My parting comment about the clams above? Oh, yeah, this, too.\n\nEnormous portions. We didn't finish anything and took all of the rest to go. In order to pay penance for all those years I neglected to visit (and because I live 60 miles away and have no idea when I'll be back), we ordered a pizza to take with us.

I had been to most of the \"good\" pizza joints near work and I kind of wanted to try something new.  Enter Red Devil.  I looked up their website online, picked up the phone and placed an order for a small cheese pizza.  The guy told me it would be about 25 minutes.  That was perfect timing since Red Devil is about a 20-25 minute drive from work.  I get down there, park, go up to the take out window and give them my number.  The guy looks at me and says, \"You never ordered a pizza...we don't have that number in our system, plus, I was the one taking orders for the last hour and we don't have your pizza\".  I know for damn sure I ordered it, had my number, drove all the way down here and was not hallucinating on ordering a pizza!  I show the guy my phone with Red Devils number on it and my minute long conversation.  He goes, \"Um...yeah...that's the Red Devil down on McDowell\".  My dumb ass ordered it at the wrong location.  I felt like such an idiot!  The dude was like, \"No worries man, I can whip you up a pizza in about 15 minutes\".  I passed because it would have been pushing the limits of my lunch break and I sadly walked away with my tail between my legs and with no damn pizza!  Bummer!   Fast forward to today.........\n\nI called the correct number this time, and placed my order for a small cheese pizza with fresh garlic.  The guy said it would be ready in about 25 minutes so I drove down Bell to capture my pizza.  I walked up to the window, gave the guy my order number and he handed over my pie.  A small (10 inch...that's what she said!) pizza with garlic came out to $8.64.  I gave him $10.00 and told him to keep the change.  I took this pizza out to my car and dug in.  Here is how it was...............\n\nSmall 10\" pizza-  I opened the box and was impressed with what I saw.  It was cut into 6 small slices and it smelled great.  It had a ton of melted mozzarella as well as globs of minced garlic everywhere!  The crust had a nice little char/brown to it and you could tell it just came fresh out of the oven.  I picked up a slice and took a bite.  HOT AS A MOFO!  I should have let this thing cool down a bit.  The flavors were so good though, I didn't give a shit and motored through that first piece burning the roof of my mouth as I went.  Good cheese (a tad greasy), great tasting sauce and a ton of garlic did this pizza right!  The best part of this pizza was the crust!  It's a medium/thin dough..more on the thinner side but with a little \"body\" to it.  Right when I bit in, I knew it was great!  It had a slight crispy crunch on the bottom and then enough of a doughy chew to compliment it.  I studied the crust and noticed a whole bunch of little air bubbles in the dough.  I LOVE dough like that!  It's almost like eating fresh baked bread out of the oven.  It was mighty fine pizza dough and crust!  I mowed down my 6 slices in a matter of minutes and was sad when I was chewing my last piece of that amazing crust!  I would put this crust up there with La Grande Orange as being my favorite in Phoenix (strictly on crust rating/preference).  Both places have the same type of texture, and both places are absolutely fantastic!\n\nOverall, I thought it was pretty damn good.  Red Devils have been around since the 60's and I can definitely see why.  I would not hesitate to come back for another pizza (Their Mediterranean pizza sounds awesome) and can hopefully make it through some of their other menu items, too.  Add this to the list of another great pizza joint in Phoenix!  It was great and with a few more visits, I can definitely see this becoming a 5 star joint!", "business_id": "0gQrhOYWdO0XVZEKtOrvaA", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-10-23", "type": "review"}

It's basically the perfect crust. The sauce has great garlicy flavor with loads of yummy spices, and the cheese they use is YUMMY! I'm guessing it's provolone?\n\nWings - I typically order the mild wings, and they still have a kick to them.

Let me suggest a paradigm adjustment.  Don't think of Fatso's as a pizzeria.  You'll only be disappointed.  Instead, think of it as a bar with really cheap pizza.\nI say this because Fatso's has a fantastic beer selection for a little neighborhood place (biased; it's my neighborhood).  They have some of Oregon's finest combined with the Southwest's finest, and that is some damn fine beer.  You're not very likely to find places around here with a similarly diverse + good menu of choices.  It's a great environment - very homey - with live music on a regular basis.  I can't speak as to the quality of the music, but I'm optimistic.  The owners are nice and friendly and treat you like a neighbor should.\nBut then we come to the pizza.  And I have to admit I've only tried the pizza, and not any of their other offerings.  The pizza is just not that great.  In particular, I dislike the sauce.  I feel that it doesn't do any justice to anybody, and that it probably comes out of a can.  The crust could be okay, but I think it gets brought down by the sauce, and, eh, I dunno, I'm just usually not a fan of really thin-crust pizza unless it has other things going for it.  'Fresh' isn't a word I would use.\nBut it is REALLY cheap.  It is cheap as hell.

Add fresh garlic to your pizza of choice and you will never want to eat a garlic-less pizza again!\n\nFatso's has a surprisingly large selection of beers on tap and a number of bottled craft beers (Stone, Rogue, etc.).  \n\nLastly, treat yourself to a Fat Cookie.  It is100% worth the thousands of crunches you'll need to do to work it off!", "business_id": "u5o4H8h0sIVhqa8Lcusi5g", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-11-27", "type": "review"}

But what makes this place is the simple atmosphere, beer on tap, and local vibe.  Not a fancy place at all, but that turns out to be a good thing for this establishment. This is the place to come for a game, or fun night and you can be ensured that the service is decent despite the number of patrons versus servers. We came on a Monday football night and only 2 people were working. We never felt neglected. The food was decent and I would come back just for the comfortable atmosphere. I normally don't give 4 stars to restaurants that aren't food worthy, but the family that runs this is so friendly that you can't help but love it. Thank you for making our experience seemingly to be catered to us (you changed the tv to our station). Is this a foodie destination? Perhaps not, but it is most definitely a neighborhood joint that everyone must go to. The atmosphere and people are the crux of this place.

I've been looking for a new neighborhood pizza joint and hoped that maybe this place could be it. no No NOOOO WAYYYYYY!!!\nFirst: I ordered hot wings, all drummies and extra crispy. The rep said that I couldnt have my requested order because the wings come \"pre-made\", in \"oven-ready containers\". When someone orders wings, they take it out of the fridge and place the container in the oven to heat it up. Therefore, unable to take special requests.\nThe pizza arrived piping hot but I had asked for well done with the cheese brown and bubbly. The cheese was melted. I have to agree with the other reviews, there was an odd taste to the sauce and cheese. I'm from Wisconsin so I can taste real, quality cheese. This was very odd tasting \"cheese\". \nThe wings were absolutely disgusting. Barely warm. I put them under the broiler after they were delivered and they still tasted rubbery. The skin was drenched in sauce but unable to get crispy, even after my broiler attempt. Very fatty.\nOn a positive  note, the delivery was quick. I wish they would have taken the extra time to at least make an effort to make the customer happy. Honestly, (and my own personal opinion because I'm no expert) I dont think the wings were even at health dept standards. \nThis was the worst $30 I've ever spent.

I've actually Googled some of their specialty toppings at the table to figure out what they are, the cheeses so specific to regions around the world that you'll want to learn more on why they are notable.\n\nOriginal crust is thick and buttery, yielding heavy toppings and tender strands of mozzarella.  I'm a big fan of the Schriers pepperoni on a margherita pizza, laden with fresh garlic and torn basil.  Salads are hearty and plentiful, with a killer Spinach Salad (crisp bacon, egg, crunchy radishes and grape tomatoes) and White Balsamic Dressing.\n\nWaitstaff at this location are bustling while still managing to be endearing.

We've actually left with two pizzas in hand - totally unasked for but very appreciated.\n\nI don't really compare the pizza here to other thin-crust pies - it's so specific of a taste, it's almost its own thing.

Decor - comfortable and clean.\n\nTried a bruschetta sampler and have to admit it wasn't as good as it could be.  The toppings were fine.  The toast wasn't.  Normally, bruschetta is served on lightly toasted, thickly sliced bread that is crunchy on the edges and softer in the center.  This version was served on what amounted to a large crouton.  Completely hard and not very tasty.  The waiter assured me the \"bread\" was made in house but I suspect that's not the case.  I think it's purchased in a pre-toasted, fully-realized crouton state.  Either way, the pizza more than made up for the appetizer!\n\nI chose the Yukon Gold pizza which comes with VERY thinly sliced potatoes, pancetta, gorgonzola, mozz, rosemary, and olive oil - a white pizza.  I'm a vegetarian and they are SUPER nice about customizing.  I asked for mushrooms instead of pancetta, and added onions.  It was outstanding!  Wonderful, Neapolitan style crust perfectly baked in a wood fired oven.  One of the best pizzas I've ever had, actually.  The rosemary was fresh, not dried which made a huge difference.  \n\nI love a restaurant that stays open all day and just has a single menu, not lunch and dinner.

The guy that greated me as if we've been friends for years, also took my drink order! Fresh Squeezed! Hell YES! I'll take 3! \n\nSome small talk as I asked questions about the menu, then some grub. At this point, I want to just hang out, I think his name was Dan..or Dave..we were best friends by this point and I thought it rude to request his name once again.\n\nFirst up (1 Fresh Squeeze down, 1 on deck!) I ordered a special item..the Chefs Board. Brilliance on wood! Every item was displayed like a picture in a world class cook book. Chef Ramsey would have nothing but praise for this wonderment of delicatessen delight! Maybe some dill pickles added is all I'd say..but even if not, I'll order this every time I'm in town.\n\nEntree. (2 Fresh Squeezed down, switching to iced tea..which is fresh brewed, and tasty). Gluten free pizza with Real! Olive Oil..no sh#%..you can taste it's legitimacy! Cheese, chicken, bacon and pepperoni. I can't imagine ordering anything else. It was all super good, real...fresh made on their own, combined together for an amazing conglomeration of palate igniting insanity. After my food erection went away, my new best friend, D-simething, told me about the mint chocolate chip Gelato..so, since his advice has been spot on thus far, and we are now besties, he hooked it up! And all I need to know is...where...where can I buy this by the pint? \n\nMind...BLOWN! Thanks Dan..or Dave..eh.. you're my new Phoenix go to guy! Thanks for the touristy suggestions and just all around badass experience you led me on! I WILL be back!  \n\n - a very awesomely stuffed (with good, quality food!)

The order taker told me my food would be ready to pick up in half an hour. When I arrived to get my food, I was informed by the manager, whose name is Scott, that my order was never placed or get lost or something, but the food was not ready. He offered to give me the food for free at that point, so I had to kill 25 minutes shopping for wine at a nearby Fry's Market while my order was prepared.\nWhen I returned, my food was ready and I picked it up and headed home to eat dinner with my wife, an hour later than our usual dinner time. The next time I ordered from Rosati's, the same manager was on duty when I walked into the store to pick up my order. A lady came in behind me to pick up a pizza she had ordered and the same manager who had been on duty when Rosati's lost my order the first time was on duty again. He couldn't find the lady's pizza order. He told her he'd make her a pizza and that it would take around 25 minutes. She said to the manager, \"How did you lose my order?\" The manager said, \"I don't know, somebody must have not entered it into our computer order program. The lady replied, \"Don't you watch what people are doing to make sure things are done right here?\" Scott answered her, \"Hey, don't blame me, I didn't take your order!\" The lady sat down to wait, obviously frustrated. I asked her, \"You have to wait here for 25 minutes to get a pizza that should have been ready when you got here because they lost your order? I'd chew out the manager for the hassle and inconvenience of making you wait here all this time just for a pizza. Isn't he going to do anything for you to compensate you for your wasted time?\" She said unhappily, \"No, he didn't offer me anything for having to wait for my pizza.\" I called Scott, the manager, over to the counter and told him in front of the lady whose pizza order was lost, \"How many orders do you lose here? Don't you think you should do something for this poor lady to compensate her for her time?\"\nScott told me, \"I'm going to give her a free pizza. I took care of you, didn't I?\" Shaking my head with a sad smile, I commented to Scott, \"Wouldn't it be better business all the way around to do things right so your customers get their food when it's promised and you don't have to make it up to people by giving food away for free while they sit around killing time?\" He didn't say anything in rebuttal, just walked toward the kitchen area of the store. I mentioned to the lady who was still waiting for her pizza, \"The manager said your pizza would be at no charge.\"\nShe thanked me for my help and commented, \"I feel a little better now but I'm still unhappy about having to waste my time waiting for a mediocre pizza.\" I asked her, \"Why do you order here?\" She responded, \"It's not too far from where I live. Why do YOU order here?\" I grinned and quipped, \"Same stupid reason. Half the time they leave something out of your order, like a salad or salad dressing or garlic bread, or they leave four inches of crust without toppings around the edge of your pizza so you're eating plain dough. Yuk. And they really don't listen to constructive criticism. They just keep stumbling down the path of carelessness and mediocrity. I think I'm done ordering from Rosati's. There are better alternatives, even if it means driving a little further to get there. Try Riazzi's sometime, in Tempe. Best pizza in Phoenix and great Italian food, too.\"\nThe lady nodded at me and agreed, \"I think I'm with you on that. Who needs this hassle for food that isn't anything to write home about?\" \nHey, don't take my word for this. Make the mistake and find out the hard way, if you insist.

I've been here once before and was not at all impressed so I wasn't expecting too much. Well, it was even worse than the first time! My son, being a kid, opted for a slice of cheese pizza which was still in the oven so at least that was fresh. I opted for some spaghetti.  I watched the server put some noodles into a black plastic bowl and top it off with sauce. I looked away for a second and the bowl was no longer on the counter. We stood there  for a couple minutes, looking at the server and others behind the counter for some sort of a cue to see if we should stay there or move toward the register or something. The next thing I see is our server kneel down and pull my spaghetti out of the abyss. I asked if she had just pulled it out of a microwave and she said yes. I told her I didn't want it then to which she replied \"well, we microwave all of our food\". I guess that explains part of the reason why it tastes so bad! I think almost everyone knows that you DON'T microwave anything in a plastic dish that isn't meant to go in the microwave! Even the ones that are meant to go in the microwave are questionable. If my kid wouldn't have REALLY wanted pizza we wouldn't have bothered to purchase anything from them. Don't waste your money here or risk your health by getting toxins from microwaved plastic!", "business_id": "kvrgvuxO6A6i9fXYaUKqcg", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-11-17", "type": "review"}

So I had to notify Groupon for a refund--that took a few days but I eventually got my refund processed.

Well, I had actually ordered the veggie slice to be on a white-garlic sauce style, but the sauce wasn't prepared yet (boo) so I had to get it in the traditional style. \n\nThe mushroom/spinach/tomato slice was very sad-looking. The mushrooms were the canned kind!!! Blasphemy!!! And the amount of veggies was pretty skimpy. The sausage/mushroom slice was not my cup of tea, but I don't know if I'm just not fond of the Sicilian style. \n\nMy husband ordered the calzone and was veeerrrrryyyy disappointed with it. The crust wasn't good and overcooked to the point of being rock-hard so it was kind of a pain to eat. Usually he scarfs down his calzones quickly (it's his first choice at italian places), but we left with 3/4 of the calzone intact and I ended up having to toss it when I was cleaning out the fridge because he didn't eat the leftovers. \n\nAll in all, it wasn't a great meal.

That said, here I go.\n\nOrdered the Turkey Feast for Thanksgiving because in the past Buca always represented a good value. \n\nHA WHAT A JOKE!  Their use of the word Feast borders on deceptive advertising. \n\nA \"Feast\" as defined by Webster:\n\na : an elaborate and usually abundant meal often accompanied by a ceremony or entertainment : banquet \nb (1) : something that gives unusual or abundant enjoyment\n\nThey should be calling it a Turkey appetizer, but before I expound further, I want to explain that my wife and I usually share an entree, so you'll know neither of us is a big eater. We went to Buca because we expected to have lots of leftovers over the weekend. NOT\n\nBuca claims it can feed 3 but I could have eaten the six (6) MINISCULE, REHEATED, COOL slices of white meat and 4 tablespoons of dressing by myself. What a RIP-OFF for $24.95!!\n\nThe extra side of salad was missing the usual pepperocini (only contained 1) so we had to request some on the side.\n\nThe baked Rigatoni pasta was DRY, DRY, STICK IN YOUR THROAT DRY and we had to request extra suace.\n\nAnd let's not forget the bread... whoever currently orders this for Buca doesn't know the meaning of Italian bread. What they served wasn't much more firm than Wonder bread and certainly a far cry from REAL, Crusty, Coarse Italian bread like you find at Brio, Maggianos or any other restaurant with Italian roots. You can find better Italian bread at COSTCO than at this place... in fact, they'd make a huge improvement in the authenticity of the meal by getting their bread from COSTCO instead of the bakery they are using.\n\nAnd yes, we could have sent all the food back, but we decided to be Thankful for our ability to go out and enjoy a beautiful day, as well as not cause a scene in the restaurant and spoil anyone else's enjoyment of the holiday. Our response instead  will be to never visit one of their restaurants again.\n\nPLEASE do yourself and your family a favor by avoiding Buca de Beppo at all costs. This company should be out of business so something better could fill the space.\n\nGo to your local Italian restaurant, run by a local family, rather than this corporate theme restaurant that has forgotten the quality and value that made them famous in the beginning.\n\nIf we could rate ZERO stars we'd have done so.", "business_id": "sllZXXYijYUs-n80uSa96w", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-11-25", "type": "review"}

I loved to look at the eclectic photos.\n\nFood is really good.\n\nWaitstaff is kinda in-your-face.  We were greeted with \"Hi are you here to celebrate something?\" thinking that we were going to be ordering lotsa wine and a ton of dishes to honor the whatever it was we were celebrating.  No, we were there just to have a nice dinner.  In addition, she brought the wrong dish, and then wanted to argue about whose fault it was.  We had to argue with her. Then begrudgingly took it back and said under her breath \"I guess that what I'll be eating later\".   Then to punish us, she never returned to fill our water glasses or ask us if we would like to have some more bread.  MAJOR FAIL as a waitperson.\n\nMy composite 3 stars is a generous rating, and would have been much lower - except that the food is good, and the d\u00e9cor is interesting.  Buco is really a 2 star restaurant.  It would appear that Buco Di Beppo is now on the downhill slide, and is trying to boost the bottom line by cutting portions and raising prices.  I call that the \"death spiral\" and is a precursor to going under.  And, in addition, they hire wait persons who are unskilled and do not know how to interact with the public (that's us, BTW).\n\nIt is unlikely that I will be returning - even if my family ties me up and blindfolds me.

The obvious big draw to this place is the massive organ and the very talented organist. Truly impressive and charming. While we were there he played several songs, all from different genres. My very busy bodied 7-year-old was very entertained. \n\nWhen you first enter the restaurant you go up to the counter to order. We ordered a simple pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and mushrooms. We also ordered a \"small salad\" which is salad bar style, but there are several signs up that ask that you only take one trip to the salad bar. Lame. And again, seems like cheap skate business to me. Then when we went to pay, found out that they take CASH ONLY -No debit or credit cards. This is such a pet peeve of mine. It is 2014. Who carries cash anymore?! Add $0.05 to each item to cover the costs of having a credit card machine and call it good. Quit being ridiculous! They do have an ATM in the restaurant so, we quickly got cash out and then went to order our drinks....which are down the side of the counter and you pay separately for as well.  Again, annoying. Why are the multiple stations necessary?? \n\nThe dinning area is seat yourself and we found a nice little spot in the corner. It was very busy but we could still see pretty well. You are given a number on your receipt and the numbers go up on a big board in the dinning area, similar to a bingo board. Our pizza was ready pretty quickly but, the food was mediocre, at best, and very overpriced for what we got. For the large pizza, two small salads, and two sodas- it was just over $40. For a dinner out, that is pretty typical for that kind of order but, again- I was annoyed by the lack of service and inconveniences, and when I go out to eat, I want the food to be fantastic...this wasn't.\n\nI would however, highly recommend checking this place out AFTER having dinner somewhere else.

The machines work about half the time, whether they are out of tickets, swallow tokens, etc.  Trying to find an employee to fix it, is next to impossible, by the time they show up, kids have forgotten about it so their tickets are lost and so is the token.  \nThe hand stamping at the entrance is a double edge sword. On one side, kids can't leave, but on the other... parents DO!  This last time we went, there were these kids basically stealing tickets, tokens, etc from other kids, climbing on the equipment (cheating), they were told I don't know how many times to stop.  Myself and another parent got fed up with these little punks, frustrated unable to find these kids parents... We complained about it, we were told... \"oh yeah, those kids have been here for a while, they won't stop or listen, I think they were dropped off\", so, why don't you call the cops??? You can't just drop off your kids and leave!  \n\nI wouldn't say it's \"dirty\" in the sense of being neglected.  That is one thing I do see, is somewhere always walking around wiping things down, but still doesn't fix the fact some people are just gross, walking around with food and greasy hands, leaving it everywhere sometimes it falls in the games... kids walking around with food in their mouths (taking big bites and realize it's too big of a bite while playing a game and spitting out), again, comes down to lack of oversight by parents...  \n\nEmployees are polite and patient (you have to be to work here), I would say is bad customers who ruin the experience... One group of them is enough to ruin many other family's experience.  Maybe asking people causing trouble to leave??? I mean they do it in bars and restaurants, why not a kids play place???

I watched it come out (she put it out) at least 5 minutes earlier. We were sitting right next to it, I don't know why she would lie about that. So the pizza was good, but I had ordered a cup of soup and it was still cold... like it was for sure frozen before coming to our table.
