It's where you go when you have to go somewhere. But on my Yelp homepage at the top, it's asking me if I've ever been and if I'd like to review it. I had some time on my hands so I figure what the heck. Let's talk about the CLT airport.\n\nIt's actually my second favorite airport in the US, Denver being the first. We can't compete with the Denver airport with its super cool art shops and the fact that during one four hour layover I had a full steak meal complete with bison ribeye and a bottle of red wine. CLT-Douglas doesn't have bison ribeyes. They do, however, have a Bad Daddy's... But without the bison. My hubs and I eat at Bad Daddy's in Dilworth for all of our burger needs and always ALWAYS upgrade to the bison. It's delicious and so much better for you than beef. So we were pretty excited to learn they were opening an airport location. Why the airport location cut the bison (and robust beer list) from their menu, I'm not sure. So in that case, I switch to the turkey burger, which is actually pretty juicy and delicious itself. \n\nBut I digress - the airport... I really like our airport. It's clean, modern and easy to navigate. Security is rarely super bad, and if it is, you can hoof it down to either A or E concourses and usually get right in. I'm not going to say that every person I've encountered at a ticket counter was a ray of sunshine but I don't remember any particular incidents to count toward the negative. I love the rocking chairs, which are dispersed throughout the airport, usually in front of large windows so you can rock and watch the planes if you so choose. \n\nAnother recent addition is Beaudevin, which I LOVE. It's an upscale sort of wine lounge, where you can chill on a chic sofa and sip on some wine, or get a snack if you're feeling peckish for something other than fast food. Even though it's right in the middle of the main thoroughfare, it still feels like a quiet escape. The d\u00e9cor is so very not-airport, with artsy chandeliers and those chic sofas I mentioned. (They do have table seating if you want to tuck into some food in a more serious manner.) \n\nThey've added more charging ports in waiting areas now so that's a convenience. I don't think they have as many as some bigger airports do, but it's definitely better than it used to be when every one at the gate was competing to sit on the floor by the one wall outlet. Progress! \n\nIf you're after Starbucks, the lines can get a little long and each location in the airport doesn't serve the same snacks. I waited in line at one and wasn't able to get the breakfast sandwich I so desired. (I would've honestly rather had an airport bloody mary to be honest but I was traveling with my boss for work on this occasion. Because that's part of the fun of airports - morning bloody marys because you can.)\n\nThere aren't any special shops I find the need to hit when I go to the airport like there are in Denver, but I kind of feel like this is a plus for my home airport. I'm there so often that it would cost me a lot of money to have a go-to shopping destination every time I travel. I get by just fine with the choice of Bad Daddy's (if I'm hungry) or Beaudevin if I just want to have a relaxing beverage while I wait for my flight. Sadly, I don't often have time to enjoy the rocking chairs, but I still like knowing they're there. \n\nOh, and my dad introduced me to the valet parking and I haven't been able to go back to regular. Especially while they're working on the new garage construction. I'm too spoiled. Sure I could spend that money on a billion other things, and I should, but there's something just so fancy about being able to walk off the plane, pay a fee and have my car brought right to me.

We debated on trying to get out of staying the second night, but decided it wasn't worth the trouble (the office had a sign posted saying there were no refunds after 10 mins of check in). We decided to rough it the second night.

We booked a room with two queen bed because we had friends staying with us for one night. The room we got had a king size bed and a gross looking pull out couch. There other rooms we supposedly booked so we had to deal with it. \n\nThe room itself was very hot and we had to call maintenance to come look at the HVAC. When he came he had to go in the ceiling and switch the unit from heat to ac because the units were the same units they installed in the 80's and you have to manually switch from heat to cool. He let us now that the room would more than likely get cold in the evening because the temp that night was supposed to get down in the 40's but he would gladly come back.

The floors by the way really need to be steam cleaned. I walked around in my socks and they were brown after just a few minutes. Very nasty. \n\nThey give you three bath towels and have signs up that ask you to reuse your towels. That is fine but with four people we requested more towels and additional bedding for the pull out bed. After an hour a gentleman finally brought up just sheets. They were hot which made it seemed like they were washed when we called. A large hotel does not have sheets clean and ready to go? I called again to get towels but no one came. It was late so we just gave up. In the morning I just went and got them myself. \n\nWe barely slept at all the whole time because the walls are paper thin and all we heard all night was sirens which sound like they are right outside your window. \n\nThe whole time I stayed there I thought I was getting sick because I was stuffed up and sneezing. Did not start until the evening we checked in. On the day of check out I happened to glance up at the vent close to the ceiling and was absolutely horrified to see black mold growing on the bathroom wall. I took a paper towel to see if it was just dust but it was not. I informed the front desk but they just insisted it could not possibly be mold. Not one person even offered to go look. I will be reporting this hotel. \n\nIn summation.... AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!!!!", "business_id": "74dAKJ9Lx0cYmb3GOxdFEA", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-03-24", "type": "review"}

Luxury is stretch limousines. Luxury is diamond tiaras and Rolex watches. Luxury is Bentleys and Beverly Hills; bone-in filets and \"bon appetite\". Luxury is throwing some glitter and making it rain.\n\nI once thought luxury in its truest form was to only be attainable by the rich and the powerful - but boy was I wrong. People -- luxury IS attainable. I know this, because I recently experienced it at the Country Inn and Suites outside of Madison, WI. \n\n Whether you opt for an \"inn\" or spring for a \"suite\" - you're going to love this fucking hotel. Upon entering the palatial lobby, a charming bellman presented me with my own personal luggage dolly, even though it was clear that my strapping, young body was more than adequate to carry my small, nylon duffle bag. The Sconnie at the front desk even put me up on the top floor of the resort (floor 3), which offered views of one of the most gorgeous bodies of water I had ever seen. \n\nThe ice bucket was a nice touch. It was large, though not too large as to take up much of the expansive counter space the room provided. There was even a plastic liner for the bucket--which I scoffed at. To think, who would even consider using it in such a pristine, meticulously manicured suite? I quickly tossed it, and when I did I couldn't help but notice the luxurious mini-fridge down below. Let me tell you, there was nothing \"mini\" about this fridge. I fit an entire case of Coors Light in there, along with some Gatorade, and cheese curds to boot. It looked so cool and cozy that, at the end of the evening, I wanted to curl up and sleep in there.\n\nThough it wasn't easy -- I refrained from sleeping in the mini-fridge. I mean, how could I sleep in there with one of the most luxurious beds I had ever seen staring me in the face? You could fit John, Kate, and the 8 on this bed. I never would, though. I'd kick them all out and keep all of the fresh pillows and down comforters to myself-- because THAT'S luxury, and Kate is mean. If it wasn't for a call of nature which I battled until my bladder nearly exploded on all of the luxurious bedding, I might STILL be laying in that fluffy wonderland of extravagance. \n\nNow, I've peed in some nice bathrooms... very nice bathrooms actually. Once, I came across a bathroom SO nice, I couldn't pee in there. I held it, and peed in my less fortunate bathroom at home-- but this bathroom? This bathroom was so luxurious; I HAD to pee in it. I couldn't unzip my fly fast enough (literally, I peed a little in my pants). Thankfully there was a cornucopia of fine soaps and lotions at my disposal. I would bet that royalty uses these same soaps - they just had that royal smell about them. When I was done drying my hands, I squirted a little more of that soap on them and didn't even wash it off.\n\nSummary: In hindsight, this is really only a place you want to stay at if you're celebrating something really special-- a honeymoon, for instance, or a significant wedding anniversary. I would've stayed someplace else had I known the Country Inn and Suites was so luxurious. Now, back at my home, I fear I may never taste that royal tang again. Enjoy your stay here; cherish it. I know I sure did.", "business_id": "hmYAW7mhIz_o8ArencdkDw", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-05-22", "type": "review"}

Handicapped-accessible primarily meant a larger bathroom/bathtub, which is always a good thing. The Continental breakfast was uninspired but not skimpy either: breakfast breads, yogurt, fruit, cereal, prepackaged muffins, and a waffle bar. In short, the La Quinta was a good value, and I'd be happy to stay there again.", "business_id": "ftjhXiYI0CFOk_px-lafWw", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-04-24", "type": "review"}

She offered us a good deal compared to their normal pricing but we were all a little tight on funds so we were nervous about upgrading. She asked the manager to come over and after chatting with all of us for a few minutes (she was so super sweet and informative about the history of the hotel and an absolute pleasure to speak with) she worked some kind of wonderful magic and brought the room down to a killer deal that was completely mind blowing. All of us were so excited because not only did each of us now have a bed to sleep in, but it was going to save us money so that we had a bit more to spend at the Con. \n\nThe room had a separate living room with a couch bed, desk, chair, and foot stool. The bedroom had 2 full-size beds and a nice desk. The view was of downtown PHX and it had 2 nice-sized closets and 2 bathrooms! This was perfect for 3 girls and 2 guys since we all had to get ready at the same time. \n\nThe hotel is beautiful. The lobby is quaint and well appointed. Obviously being a historical landmark it is older and smaller than the gigantic contemporary resorts that many of us are now used to, but it's so much better in many ways. It was warm and friendly and felt like a loved one's home. Honestly I would stay there again anytime. \n\nThere is talk about it being haunted but I didn't get a scary vibe from the hotel at all. I will say that without knowing anything about the haunting history I did step onto the elevator by myself to go up to my room and all of the sudden I smelled some sort of fruity  perfume smell that was not present when I first got into it and the elevator which was set to go up took me down to the basement even though the B button was not pushed and my room was on the 5th floor. The doors opened revealing the basement and I said \"Hello?\" There was no one around. It kind of creeped me out a little bit later when I found out more about the history of the hotel and it's haunting stories. \n\nI highly recommend the Hotel San Carlos for those of you who appreciate history and don't mind a hotel with character. \n\nOh and the parking isn't awful. It's just a little jot up the street which for those of you who don't mind walking a short ways, is just fine.

My room was nice, with a microwave and fridge, which I do not see often. This was prefect for a yelper on the hunt for great food; meaning I could bring things back with me. My bed was comfortable and room service cleaned everyday, placing things just where I left them if they need to making the bed or cleaning the sink. I was able to control the heat in the room! Big screen tv with hbo. Coffee maker in the room, iron in the room and FREE WIFI were a plus!\n\nI also loved the workout room. While small, they had a few machines that could keep this girl happy. This room was next door to me and I barely heard the machines being used on the other side of the wall! Thanks for thinking of me! The wokout room was also clean.

The rooms are very nice. I love that there was 3 separate sink areas (with mirrors and counter space). I was staying with one other person, but if someone was willing to stay on the pull out sofa, we could have easily done 3 ladies. \n\nThere are two separate rooms in each suite, with a door. In the first one as you walk in, is a small sofa and chair with ottoman. There is a good-sized table and chairs and a small sink area with a fridge. There is also a bathroom off to the side which was well equipped and decent sized. I never felt like we were in each other's way and I never worried about visiting with other people in their room, there was always plenty of space.\n\nThe other room is quite large with 2 beds (or perhaps a king, not sure, we stayed in a double, obviously), a wardrobe, and an area with another sink/mirror/counter. Very nice for two women trying to get ready in the morning.\n\nI cannot talk to the shopping or how far it was away from anything. We pretty much stayed in the hotel or went to specific places.

When we show up at the counter, we get right in with no delay and are greeted by Darius (also a terrible musician's name - should've been my first clue). Before ever offering the vehicle class I reserved, he says \"No self respecting man drives a minivan, but I can put you in an Expedition or Tahoe for $40 extra per day)...um no thanks dude. He tells me the only minivan they have available is a Kia Sedona. I wouldn't mind having that for three days, but nine? Do you have ANY Caravans or Town and Country's? No, he flatly replies, but for $10 per day extra you can have a Toyota Sienna. WTF? (Note that the Sienna was parked directly across from a Budget owned Town and Country). A minivan's a minivan, but apparently the Sienna comes with wings or a jet pack - not sure which, so it's $10 per day extra. I don't want a damn Kia for nine days and I just got off a 6.5 hour flight from Anchorage, so fine - I'll take the damn Sienna and call customer service later to flesh this out. Which I do, and the CSR agrees saying that the Sienna squarely falls within the guise of \"or similar\". He says while he cannot modify an open reservation, he'll notate my reservation that the up-charge is not warranted and is to be removed upon return of my rental. Fast forward to the return to PHX: the return agent scans the car in, I explain the situation and she points me over to the FastBreak counter. I am \"greeted\" by three short bus all stars who explain that because the Sienna has this flimsy piece of shit jump seat for the middle row (which is only available on the absolute base model Sienna, ironically), that its 'eight passenger capacity' versus a standard minivan's seven seats warrants the extra charge. I point out the notation from Budget corporate, to which they don't blink and instead remind me that I 'agreed' to the charges, thus I owe for them. (They'd make model date rapists). I ask for a manager who promptly comes over with the standard issue fake friendly, I'm not really listening demeanor they all have - who reiterates all of the above. I asked her if the Sienna is indeed a 'premium' minivan, where is the option at the website to reserve as such and pay the difference? Of course, she can't answer that because that option doesn't exist, hence the bullshit up-charge; but that doesn't stop the prepubescent punk at the desk from rolling his eyes and shaking his head at the question. The manager even went as far as to assure me that this was 'no conspiracy'; to which I calmly replied no one on her staff was competent enough to execute one. This was your rental agent's feeble attempt at shaking me down for an extra $90 + tax I did not owe for on a paid in full reservation. She quickly dropped the friendship act and said 'it seemed' I was accusing her staff of being unethical; I replied that's exactly what they are - and the conversation was promptly concluded. Since we were about 3.5 hours early to the airport, I had nothing but time to kill - so I called the 800 number again and had a brief chat with a friendly CSR that agreed with my assessment and the previous CSR's; she even went as far as to run the car's number through her system and it decoded as a minivan - the class on my reservation. She apologized profusely and reversed the charge. Morale of the story: PHX Sky Harbor Budget is staffed and managed by a bunch of horse's asses, while the national 800 number is quite helpful. Can't wait until they have the best price on my rental again...", "business_id": "FYCVF_1qYm3x5DYCbmmK1g", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-03-02", "type": "review"}

The rental center itself is convenient, and the process of returning your car is efficient, but driving there is a disaster.\n\n- Food options are limited once you go past security.  Not much going on there.\n\n- Gates have insufficient seating.

You may come out to your car one morning and find a large truck parked next to you at some crazy angle that makes it impossible to open your car door; (2) because of the lower price they had to cut a few corners (no regular housekeeping for short-term stays, pillows were lousy, the closet has a curtain instead of a door, don't get as many TV channels as other places).  \n\nBut honestly, none of these were a big enough issue to detract from the savings.  If I have to quote-unquote \"deal\" with having a curtain as a closet door in order to save $100 a night, I'd take it every time.  Stated differently, the good (significant cost savings) outweighs the bad (some cut corners) by a mile.\n\nAll-in-all, we were pleasantly surprised.  We would not hesitate to recommend to friends or to stay here again.", "business_id": "rI7d_L0BCKemotT9XD5wAg", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-04-05", "type": "review"}
