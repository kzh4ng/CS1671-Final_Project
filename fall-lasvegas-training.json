I went to this location on Craig based on the good reviews.\n \nI told the man who was helping me (he was super nice by the way) that I wanted a certain tire. He checked it out and they were out of the tire I wanted. So he recommended I get a different tire instead of waiting for the ones I picked out, because this other tire was better quality plus it was currently on sale.\n\nNaturally, I thought he was trying to take advantage of me and make some extra cash by selling me this \"other\" tire... so I took a time-out and looked up tire reviews from my phone. Turns out I was just being a paranoid freak because he was being completely honest. The tire he recommended was actually MUCH better than the one I had picked out (I just didn't consider it because it was out of my price range online). In the store however, it ended up being only a couple dollars more than the tire I originally picked out because it was on sale. \nSo I came out winning thanks to the super nice, honest Discount Tire guy! Yay!\n\nLong story short-- this was the first time in my life that I was actually wrong about getting ripped off at a car-place. I've had my new tires for a few weeks now and I LOVE them.

When I saw the sign for Einstein Bagels, I passed over Starbuck's.\n\n  The fact that I passed over Starbuck's for Einstein Bagels is testimony that their coffee and value is better. For $2 more than Starbuck's, I brought bottomless coffee and a toasted bagel with cream cheese. Let me say that Einstein Bagel's Coffee is underrated. If I was to come up with a list of underrated places, Einstein Bagel's coffee would be on it. There were four blends of coffee, including Autumn Blend, Neighborhood blend, and decaf. I know that the  coffee is good when I pass over mixing in flavored syrup to add flavor to it. Regardless they fall short of the goodness of New York bagels, they come close. By the way, I recommend the toasted blueberry bagel.\n\n    Whereas Einstein Bagels is a great value when you order a bagel with coffee, the value factor decreases when you order higher priced items. My complaint about Einstein Bagels, which I addressed in previous reviews, is not including a side item such as potato chips or potato salad with the sandwich. I believe that their customer base would grow if they included a side item.\n\n   I have a mixed opinion as far as service. The employees were friendly at  the same time that it seemed understaffed. One employee juggling the order line and register line resulted in an extended line. Eventually the manager would help out at the order line. If I had an important place to be, it is strong possibility I would've walked over to Starbuck's.\n\n   Because the lobby is large with lots of tables and windows, it is an inviting place to relax with a coffee and bagel.

I always tend to drown my pupusas in the tomato salsa because it's soo good, but I noticed that no one else really does that.

The bread with olive oil and vinegar for example.  Delicious.  And the paper table cloth to draw on, childish but still fun.  Also great for passing the time between your servers visits and when the food comes out.  Speaking of the food, I was less than impressed.  My table consisting of myself and three co-workers started our lunch with two appetizers.  We tried the goat cheesed stuffed peppers which were probably the best part of the meal.  They were sweet and creamy and topped with a drizzle of thick balsamic.  They came out a lot smaller than I had expected.  Still good though.  We also tried the spicy sausage and peppers.  This dish was okay but not wonderful.  The peppers had a spicy and slightly smokey flavor.  The sausage was crispy.  Almost too much so for me.  For my lunch I ordered the chicken and mushroom canelloni.  It looked great but was lacking a very important feature.  Mushrooms.  I think I found one piece of what looked like canned mushrooms.  That was a disappointment.  And the chicken was not like what I expected.  It was small chunks of chicken that seemed previously prepared and arrived in bulk.  The pasta itself was dry as if the dish was put under a heat lamp or into an oven before the sauce was added.  The quality and freshness of food here was just lacking from my perspective.  as for the service, not bad but not outstanding either.  Our server, Chris, was new and claimed to be fresh out of training.  He was noticeably nervous. He did get all the orders correct and I give him credit for that.  I have to knock a few points off overall service though for seating four people at a table with clearly two settings and wating until we asked for more before bringing more.  We told the host/hostess that we were a group of four and waited 10 minutes for a table to be \"prepared.\"  I would think with the time that passed they could have managed to put to extra settings on the table.

They pick and cut the meats how they want to and bring it out, sometimes I've noticed as I order the same dish, usually brisket and beef tongue, the sizes either get smaller and smaller or the quality of the meat decreases as well. \n\nRice and salad are included, but I usually wouldn't recommend the rice unless you're getting marinated meat, because you'll fill up on it and eat less meat. =] \n\nThey have an al la carte menu which is decent, I usually get it if I'm going in for lunch or late night and just want some tofu soup. They have a variety of tofu soup all at the same priced, slightly more than $8 each. It's a good deal, you also get rice with it. Just don't dump all the rice in at once, otherwise the soup will disappear very quickly!  Oh also, they put the egg in right when they bring it to the table. \n\nI've gotten the spicy chicken and bulgogi from the al la carte menu, don't really remember the pricing, but it wasn't too bad. A friend liked the al la carte menu better because it's cooked on a stove top so the meats retain more of their juices and she found it more flavorful. \n\nEverything you order comes with some side dishes, which include kimchi, seaweed, this type of fish thing (sorry I forgot the name), korean panakes, jap che, and a few others.", "business_id": "UKKz4HdQC0aH9j5lLi4u8Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-11-30", "type": "review"}

I got there around 10:00, and signed my name on the list. Boy was the wait long. We had to wait 30 minutes for a party of 3. Once we sat down, we ordered out food quickly.  Our food arrived pretty quickly because we were cooking it ourselves. We ordered my favorites which is beef tongue, brisket, pork belly, and sliced ribeye (my friend assumed ribeye was a good thing. She didn't know it was bulgolgi.) The beef tongue slices were pretty small, but everything else was delicious. We also ordered the soup which is a bean paste soup. Over the years, they have tried to reduce costs. They no longer include tofu in their soup. :( I love Korean bbq.  \n\nI love when my pork belly is crispy and I love to dip my meat in samjang which is a sauce you are able to ask them for as they don't automatically bring it out.  I love the salad that comes with it. It tastes awesome!\n\nService was a little lacking. They were super busy, which I can understand. $13.99 is a great deal for Korean bbq.  At first it didn't matter because we were just eating and enjoying our food. But eventually we did want our waters filled, and we did want squid.  They do have pretty awesome bancahn. I love the japchae and the fish cake. I prefer my kimchi to be riper. \n\nPretty good deal for $13.99. I think the tofu soup is horrible here. Go to Mr. Tofu for that. It's just across the street!

The consistency of the cake is just perfect, not too firm/not too soft, and the buttercream frosting is amazing! \n\nAs for the food:\nCaesar Salad - Not bad, the only thing I dislike is that their \"Caesar\" dressing tastes nothing like Caesar salad dressing, but the chicken is seasoned well. Doesn't have that tangy anchovy or lemon taste you expect.\nPasta Salad - Personally not my favorite because it has a strange taste, but it isn't terrible; it's just not what you expect pasta salad to taste like. However, I believe they use the same ingredients to make the coleslaw and it works well with the coleslaw, just not the pasta salad.\nGumbo - Their gumbo is very good. Being a person of ethnic background I was surprised just how good it was. The bread it comes with it quite tasty as well.\nChicken Salad Sandwich - This is also pretty good.\nPortabella Panini - This is good depending on what day you get it. Sometimes it's WAY too greasy (especially since there's no meat in it) and the veggies are over cooked and slide out because there's so much grease, but I've had it a few times when it was made perfectly, with not much grease and just veggies that still have a bit of a crunch. Overall the flavor is always nice.\nLemonade - you might walk in and think that there's dirt in their lemonade container, but IT'S FRESH VANILLA BEAN, and my god it's the most genius idea to put fresh vanilla bean into lemonade. It's not something you would expect to taste good, but it's seriously delicious.\nBeef Bahn Mi Sandwich - it's very good also, but very spicy so be careful if you don't like spicy food because the jalapenos had my mouth on fire.

I will say that the salad was not very good - so I would either skip it or try the table side ceaser salad (maybe next time)....\n\nIt looks funny from the outside, but has cool history inside (this is where the Rat Pack dined - can't get any cooler than that :)  I love the dim lighting - perfect for a nice dinner. Oh! and their golden cow sign outside is just funny! You must appreciate this place for what it is - a classic steakhouse...", "business_id": "YZuHOgbKiP3dN4_ROOUyDQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-11-29", "type": "review"}

I had the misfortune of trying several different options before finding Bell Trans.  Since finding them 3 years ago, I have never used another transportation company in Vegas.\n\nTo get from the airport to my parents' house via taxi is anywhere from $65 to $95 depending on route and traffic.   For the return trip, we've used a shuttle service and it was $50 for 2 people and we were crammed into a shuttle bus with 6 other people.\n\nMaking a reservation online for a towncar was quick and easy.  We paid via credit card and had confirmations days in advance, plus we could do things like request a driver that was professional and courteous but not chatty.  \n\nA round trip for 2 people in a nice, clean car with a professional, well-dressed driver was less than $100.  Pick up at the airport was $47 and the trip back was $42 (My parents live out by the Red Rock Casino) -- Way cheaper than a one-way trip from the airport in a smelly taxi PLUS we didn't have to wait in the insanely long cab line at the airport. \n\nThey meet you in the baggage claim area with your name on a sign and know exactly which carousel your bags will be on.  They assist you with your bags and escort you to the towncar area.  They are on the ball as far as having GPS so they can find residential addresses with ease.\n\nWhen it comes time for them to pick you up, they call to let you know when they are nearby so you can have your things ready to go and they will come to the door and help with bags.  \n\nGratuity is not included so be sure to have some bills to tip the driver.\n\nFor the price, I cannot think of a better or more comfortable way to travel.  If you are going to the Strip or Downtown, using their shuttle service is not bad (I have been satisfied the 2 or 3 times I have gone straight to a hotel from the airport) especially for the price, but you will be crammed into a shuttle with a bunch of other people and may need to wait to be dropped off until the very end.\n\nFor towncar service, though, I would not use any other company in Las Vegas.", "business_id": "uE8UZzb8xMMULary5sXHpQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-11-13", "type": "review"}

Going back to the airport, my brother-in-law was going home around the same time as us.  So I asked if we could take him and drop him at the other terminal.  Once again, no problem!  So, so awesome!\n\nI'll be going to Vegas again in a few days and ordered a limo again.  I'm excited knowing that I don't have to worry, it will be a pleasant experience and I will get back to the airport on time.\n\nThank you, Presidential!  I will always call you when I visit Vegas!  There's no other car service as far as I'm concerned!  \n\nPeople seriously...order the airport transfer online.  You won't regret it and you'll be hooked!  It's a must!!", "business_id": "upmnxJvYe5aOYE9wVNkGaw", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-11-03", "type": "review"}

The representative that booked my reservation was professional and thorough. I arrived at the airport with a party of 6 and we were greeted at baggage claim by our driver, Alonso. He was very professional and courteous. I originally wanted to get a six-passenger limo but he told me to upgrade to a super-stretch limo for more comfort. He was right as we fit perfectly in the super-stretch and I think we would've been cramped in the regular size limo. My booking was for 2 hours since it was an early flight and we had time to kill before check-in. \n\nOur first stop was to the famous Welcome to Las Vegas sign. Being from Seattle, I coordinated everyone to wear Seattle Seahawks apparel so that we could take pics in front of the sign. Our driver, Alonso, happily took pics of us. Our next stop was to the Mandalay Bay. There was a new Air Jordan shoe release at one of the stores there (Suite 160) so I had to get my hands on a pair before they sold out. Our final stop before the hotel was to the liquor store that our driver recommended. We found everything we needed and at decent prices. \n\nWe arrived at our hotel on time and we had Alonso take a few more pics of us posing in front of the limo. It was a very memorable experience and Presidential Limo made sure of that. First-class service at its best! I will definitely book them again and refer them to all of my friends visiting the Las Vegas area!", "business_id": "upmnxJvYe5aOYE9wVNkGaw", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-11-06", "type": "review"}

Also visit Little A'le' Inn-where numerous documentaries and movies including \"Independence Day\" have been filmed.\"\n\nAfter the tour stops to enjoy an Alien Burger at the Little A'le' Inn, next up is the location of the infamous \"Black Mailbox,\" where numerous ET sightings have occurred and then to the absolute perimeter of Area 51 through a strange and deformed-(from ET radiation) Joshua Tree Forest.\n\nThis will blow your mind! There are guards (The Men In Black), detection devices, motion sensors, listening devices and cameras mounted among the cactus. The signs outside of Area 51 read, \"The Use of Deadly force Authorized\" and you can be sure they mean it.  It's fun to wave at the heavily armed guards in the 4x4 parked on the desert hillside but they don't wave back, they just watch from behind their darkened windows-ready to pounce on you should you penetrate their perimeter.\n\nAs much as the United States Air Force has denied the existence of Area 51, we know it is there but no one knows what it is they do there. This is how you can find out! Remember-NO PICTURE TAKING ALLOWED!  This is an Extreme tour to the world's most top secret military facility, the real home of the X files! Not to be missed! Any UFO fan worth their alien authenticity needs to make sure to get on this tour and check Area 51 out!\n\nThe Area 51 Tour is a  full day sightseeing tour that lasts approximately 8 hours and the van picks you up at your hotel around 7:00 a.m. It is scheduled to operate on Wednesday only , but as long as there are 4 or more combined people up for some extra terrestrial stalking, the tour can go out.

The rice was not cooked well either, I can make perfectly fluffy white rice with my eyes closed (w/ a rice cooker of course), so I have low tolerance for bad rice.

Most often you can't taste the alcohol in a frozen drink and the buzz sort of creeps up on you.

My drink is mixed with something called category 5, and I may be on my way to being out old soon. \n\nMy lovely lady had the superman which is really delicious. It's not as strong as the magnum but it has a bit of a kick to it. She typically doesn't like blue frozen drinks, but this one hit the spot. \n\nWe had the smallest cup which are 16 ounces, so it's more than enough drink. For 2 cups and 2 Jell-O shots, it was just $20 bucks. For all the alcohol\nIn the cup, it's really a steal. \n\nThe bartender was really cool and even disposed of our plastic jello cups after our lips were on them. Talk about service. He was also very knowledgeable about the drinks and gave good advice on what we should choose.

Back home in the good mid-west Ohio we have several to choose from and I was lucky enough to grow up just miles from one of the best. Fresh hand scooped flavors that changed once one flavor was favored and ran out. The next being better then the last. At an early young age my stomach sang a song for Blue Moon, it's bright almost neon blue color and a taste some would say is like fruity pebbles. **drooling** I never get home in the summer time which is only when they are open so I miss this place a lot especially my Blue Moon unless I can convince my Mom, Sister or Grandma to tightly wrap a quart for me that can last in the freezer for four to five months. Now that I have hopefully painted a picture of what I miss most of home, a wonderful ice cream shoppe, which completely lack in this town I'll move along to Luv-it's. Luv-Its should be a nice substitute to hold that craving at bay but should be are the key words.  \n\nThis was not as good as I remember it being the last time I had it which was awhile ago, probably four to five years. I begged my BF to take me to satisfy my ice cream shoppe craving. I mean I begged and pleaded him to drive to the the other side of town to get it. I was super stoked to find a B1G1 coupon on the 8News website! I made sure to read the fine print about it needing to be printed. None found so off we went. I was so excited!! \n\nWhen we got there they wouldn't take my coupon because it needed to be printed out. I said it did not specify that, the cashier yelled for someone finally she came out and said the same thing and I said again it didn't specify that. She said that it's per owner they couldn't take it. Ugh! I don't have a laser printer to quickly and randomly print unnecessary things so I wasn't going to print it just incase. I told her they should contact the website to make sure they put that on the coupon. But this wasn't keeping me from getting the custard, as annoying as it was. \n\nI got the Western Sundae and he got the Brownie Sundae.  His was bigger and cheaper then mine, around $5.65(I forget exact amounts) his had walnuts, fudge and brownie pieces. Mine was around $5.95 and had caramel, fudge and pecans. Hmm wonder who did this math. The taste was not that of homemade custard or of what I remember it being years ago. BIG SAD FACE!! I was only left with a bigger craving for my ice cream shoppe ice cream!! \n\nA lot of the reviews were bad because of the location. Yea there were two cop cars at the gas station next door handcuffing someone and a homeless chick in the garbage, I just laughed because that stuff doesn't scare me. A cop is there and the lady is just wanting dinner. That's not what would steer me away from this place, the bad ice cream and the non caring staff will.

Then found out that the guys upstairs don't start until 8 pm but we had to be elsewhere...and in 30 minutes, no one came to take our drink orders.\n\nSo I complained and asked for either a refund or to allow us to return another night, manager openly and boisterously laughed at me saying \" we don't do refunds\", and began looking for a girl to make her start dancing. Having no choice we played along. The girls were nice enough, money hungry, but not beautiful or sexy, maybe the better girls come later...still. open to the customer means OPEN...we were there to see guys and girls as advertised, must have missed REAL HOURS OF BUSINESS on website.", "business_id": "YZxA6w82eFJFntwqJLln6w", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-11-09", "type": "review"}

My interest peaked when I noticed that this restaurant was participating in the Restaurant.com certificate program. Also a participant in the 2010 Entertainment Book. Located in the Commercial Center, in between a Mexican restaurant and a Japanese restaurant. \n\nThe interior looked different than what I remember. I like the semi-private alcoves (booths- ok a little weird, because my feet were off the floor and if I were a bigger person, might be a little uncomfortable; the table was very close to the booth- just saying. My husband's feet were almost off the floor) with the pretty artificial floral arrangements. We were seated in one corner of the room. There was a banana plant situated in the middle of the floral arrangement- my husband said it was funny and when I looked at it, I noticed there was a sign \"Please don't touch.\" Aside from that, much better ambiance here, as compared to other Thai restaurants. \n\nThe menus are wooden which make it really heavy- you could knock someone upside the head and knock him/her out- seriously. Pretty large menu- including vegetarian selections, family dinners (highest being $31.95 for two people with several courses), and lunch specials (only mon-fri). Drinks were soda, hot tea, thai iced tea, and perrier. \n\nThere were two other parties besides us. I don't know if this was typical of a sunday afternoon for lunch. The host and server were very nice. The server's uncle is the owner of the restaurant. He shared with us that this restaurant was the second Thai restaurant to open in Las Vegas. \n\nWe ordered the spring rolls (one order is comprised of two), chicken curry dish with potatoes (with steamed rice) and combination (pork, chicken, beef, and shrimp) thai style fried rice. The spring rolls were crispy and came with two sauces. The chicken curry dish was fragrant (mmm) and was served in a large blue and white bowl; came with a bowl of white rice. The chicken was fall-off-the-bone tender- excellent. It was a good size but there could have been more potatoes. My husband loves the sauce, but we had to get it mild because my husband's spice meter is pretty low (I like medium-hot). The thai style fried rice was huge. I like the fried egg, the cucumbers, and the tomatoes- really sets it apart from Chinese fried rice. Good flavor- sweeter than Chinese fried rice. We had leftovers. My husband said we found our replacement for the Mix Zone Cafe ( we all got sick on our last visit).

It felt a little like Mexico but ...whatever.  \n\nMy major complaint was the photographer(s). ( tipped separately luckily for them before you see the pics).  The photographers were awful.  LIKE high school photography class- this end is the lens awful. We got a package with 14 ceremony pictures included and we are literally having major issues selecting more than 3 shots that we want .  The shot selection was bad AND the attention to detail was poor.  \n\nShot selection- the photographers got lots of shots of our hands (wtf?), like lots of shots of our hands, the minster, and other random things. We even took the time to fill out the questionnaire to let them know what we wanted (no bouquet or ring pics etc) AND rediscussed with photographers when we got there. But we got them all anyhow which would have been fine if we also got what we wanted (candids of guests, family pics) \n\nAttention to Detail-Pics included the side of my head, the back of my husband's head, us badly off center with no one else in the pic? One clean shot where we both looking in the general direction of the camera....nope.  \n\nThe non- ceremony (see below) pictures are just as bad.  Not one group picture had everyone looking at the camera (we had a group of 18), even our family shot of four didn't look good. They also took pics of us getting out of the limo....there is a shot of every person in our limo literally getting out of the limo- like in that awkward half standing half sitting position right BEFORE you get out. WHO WOULD WANT THAT SHOT?  Again, common sense in shot selection....In front of the limo- maybe, inside the limo- sure that's cute I guess BUT literally getting out in hunch-back position ummmm no thanks! Also head shots of the entire guest list.  Helpful, if you are say making a year book, but not so much for wedding pics. \n\nBased on the pics, the pricing is outrageous. It's like 700 bucks to get digital rights to all the pics or 95 each to the rights to just some.  Either way is over 500 to be able to provide any pictures to family and/or friends and get copies of the 9 pictures out of 100+ that we wanted copies of.  \n \nBTW-ceremony pics mean during the ceremony by the main photographer only ( Also nothing from the second photographer is included). So couple shots, family shots, dress shots...NOT INCLUDED BUT shots of the unity candle and the back of your spouse's head? Pictures of your hands as your saying the vows? Yup !!!! 14 of those are included with the right package.", "business_id": "rdLy9FgD5iJbEoDmd_0i9Q", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-09-11", "type": "review"}

She called the Sahara location to see who told me that quote. Originally I didn't get the name of the person who quoted me.. Which pissed off the lady at the Sahara location and caused her to accuse me of lying, and she scolded me on when I call places to get quotes I need to make sure I get people's name when I get quotes. Then she accused me of lying. I told her \"mam I'm getting married in two days.. I don't need a lecture from u.. If this is not your price I will go somewhere else.\" She then said that's our price. I said ok. And I left.. It didn't end there. I received a call from the Sahara location and missed it. I called right back.

We'll can u see of someone called Tiffany, I just got the missed call\" she shouts \"Did anyone call a Tiffany?\" She gets back to the phone \"NOPE!

I'm not sure if it was the fact that I was starving and craving for authentic Asian cuisine that day, but this place has the best AND cheapest Filipino food I've ever had! Plus they offer decent size portion at a relatively low price!\n\nI had a two items combo with sisig, bangus and rice, and I also added an order of sinigang. Everything was delicious and authentic in my opinion. My favorite was the bangus. They didn't just give me a tiny little piece like a lot of Filipino fast food places do, they gave me pretty much the whole fish. It was done just right; not too dry but it was crispy enough. The sisig and sinigang were both good, and had enough flavors. I actually took some of the bangus and sisig to go because the portion was huge and I didn't want to waste good food. After a 12 hours drive back home, the bangus and sisig were still in good shape; and most importantly, they still tasted good after re-heating! I was totally amazed and surprised...\n\nThis place overall is clean and the staff is nice with good customer service. The only downside is that it is off the strip and definitely not walking distance from the strip. But the good thing is that it is easy to get to this place when you have a car.

We arent going to groom your dog, something is wrong with you for asking those questions!\"\n\nI ask the groomer if there was a problem because he is telling me that she is matted and he thinks that is a bad question to ask a groomer?  So he makes one of his employees go get my dog.  He says \"If you are going to ask those questions, I am not going to do your dog!\"    \n\nI cant believe it.  I have done NOTHING wrong, except ask if everything is ok.  To ask if they have a problem.  I am trying to be NICE and he thinks I am being mean?   Fruit case!   \n\nI look at the dogs they have there, and realise its smart if I leave because the cuts look horrific!   I tell the guy \"I dont know what is wrong with you!  I simply asked if everything was ok.. you are telling me there are problems with my dog, and I already knew that.  I am sick,  I have just gotten out of the hospital because I have cancer and its taken me two weeks to get down here and you are going NUTS for no reason!\"  \n\nI tell the guy \"You know.. I came here because I am a lesbian and this is a gay establishment!  I drove out of my way to get here and you treat me like this?   WHY?  I wanted to know if my dog was going to be fine with you and you loose it!

It was way less crowded than the Bangkok location. Lighting seems brighter than the one in Fremont, CA, and I can't recall at all the location(s) of the other chain outposts I have been to.\n\nThe menu still have some of the regular old school items, but it has definitely been revamped in the last 6-8 years since I ate at a Tony Roma's. The Steak & Wild Mushroom Flatbread in the appetizer section and the Basil Pesto Mahi Mahi & Vegetable Linguine in the pasta section both look really good, which I have to try next time.\n\nBut here's my review on what I ordered for dinner on this visit:\n\nI was craving the Original Back Ribs with the TR's Original BBQ Sauce, which came with cole slaw and I opted for the loaded mashed potato as the other side item.  It came out of the kitchen before I could finished reading a page out of a book I brought with me.  Was told it was because they were slow.  So who knows how long it has been waiting in the kitchen to be served.  The full slab of ribs looks kind of small, it didn't even cover the length of the oval plate, and I knew I would have to order more food.  The flavor was good, but the ribs didn't match my fond memories of it.  Ellis Island's ribs is definitely the way to go for me while I am in Vegas.  (ribs 2.5-3 stars)\n\nOrdered a Chopped Wedge Salad after the ribs arrived, and as simple as it was, it was a highlight of the dining experience (the rice pilaf was the other - crazy! I know).  (4 stars!)\n\nFrom the Seafood section I ordered the Norwegian Salmon Pan Seared with Sesame Crust and finished with Thai Sweet Chili Sauce. It was served with great rice pilaf and steamed broccoli.  The fish was prepared well, but it would have been better if it was not cooked all the way through.  (3 stars) The best part of this item is your ability to customize your salmon or mahi mahi and the cooking method and finishing options.\n\nService was friendly, and attentive.  There were only 3 tables my waiter was responsible for, and only 2 at the most were in the restaurant at the same time, so it wasn't hard to check up on the guests and bring refills.\n\nThey also have a full bar, but I didn't order anything interesting from them.\n\nAmbiance/Decor: 3/5  Had some pictures and such as wall decoration, the lighting at the booth were fairly bright which I like for taking food pictures, and music playing in the background.  Nice feel but nothing special.\n\nService:  4/5  Pleasant.\n\nFood:  3/5  Portion is noticeably smaller with the ribs, flavor still the same, but the salad was refreshing and tasty.\n\nPrice:  3/5  Comparable to other casual dining competitions, and has options that will meet the needs of those on a modest budget (under $15/person) and others that can slightly splurge a little more.\n\nDuring lunch they have the 7 for $7 promotion, and their happy hours are from 3pm to 7pm and also from 9pm to close.\n\nLocation:  West.  Not at all close to the Strip, so it is for locals.\n\nParking:  Plenty to select from, as it is in a large strip mall complex with several large national retailers such as Best Buy.\n\n3 stars!  But the ribs will no longer be the reason for my future visits.", "business_id": "CpUPzwk4rsV6UUgqEu1nqQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-09-22", "type": "review"}

I was aware that my power steering might be an issue... he called a dealership for the part (yikes.. they no longer have that part and require a whole replacement process for the part... $600+... ). Jesse was very honest with me - \"not worth it\" and provided me with a lower cost alternative.

By the afternoon, it slipped my mind completely and I forgot to mention it when I was getting the oil change.  Of course, once I left and had to use my blinker, I remembered!  I called and left a message to see if I could bring it back in.  Jesse promptly returned my call.  Jesse had told me that things like this are at no charge during oil changes.  I felt bad going back in today to have them fix it so I brought them some tacos (Taco Bell is next to the shop) to say THANKS!!!  I am glad I did... they were so apologetic for not remembering to do it yesterday and apologized for inconveniencing me.. no inconvenience...

I have made it one of my life's missions to steer clear of Wendy's. I mean, they have SQUARE burgers. And before you give me the whole, \"You realize that you can shape round patties into other shapes\" speech, I know, and understand that. I also don't want to eat a heart patty, or a star patty for that matter. I like my burger's round. Just like God intended. :P\n\nHubby and I were driving around in north LV shopping and we were starving. As I was checking my Yelp app and he was driving we kept passing a bunch of ma and pa places that had horrific reviews. I haven't eaten Wendy's in forever because I don't like the square patties. Back in the day I'd eat chili or a baked potato. I decided that if I was going to attempt a square burger, it may as well be in good ol' Las Vegas with my hubby. Libby R. and Sandra Z. swear by how awesome Wendy's burgers are that I feel that there must be something that has changed. \n\nI ordered their 1/4 lb. cheeseburger combo with a baked potato. The meat was... eh. It actually tasted the same as McDonald's. The fixings were great and the bun was nice and soft. What would make me go back is their baked potato. It was very tasty and a nice change from the regular old fries.\n\nSince this visit I had the chance to eat Wendy's again but declined. Maybe Wendy's just isn't for me.", "business_id": "pcIPHOoQZuQFfarij73Qcw", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-11-19", "type": "review"}

SAM'S CLUB HAS MARKED AISLES TO HELP SHOPPERS!\n\nThe bakery area had a pretty good selection! The bottled water area offers more of a selection than Costco.\n\nMeat department was ok. Not much fresh seafood! The quality of the red meat did not overwhelm my eyes/tastebuds! \n\nFrozen food area was quite large, but I did not recognize many of the high quality food manufacturers I prefer.\n\nThe produce area was not very impressive in a non-refrigerated area, located between the meats and frozen foods.\n\nThe candy section was two long rows filled with everything sweet getting ready for Halloween. Nice to see!\n\nPhoto department lady was very friendly and thorough explaining how they process.\n\nSurprisingly, there was no line at the pharmacy! Also, a minimal wait at the food court to enjoy a delicious Nathan's hot dog, despite the dried out bun! \n\nMembership department had no sign detailing annual fees, so I had to wait over 10 minutes to inquire with a lady who was nice, but unable to effectively communicate membership details; requiring a manger to better explain membership options.\n\nOverall, this Sam's Club offers many excellent product selections; especially for families with growing children. However, many specific products I regularly purchase were not offered at this Sam's Club. I am a creature of habit when it comes to grocery shopping and prefer to not start over with substitute products that I am unfamiliar.\n\nSam's Club has several convenient locations valley-wide, specifically this Trop & Pecos location. and Sam's Club is $10 less than Costco for an annual membership. and I think Nathan's hot dogs taste delicious when eaten with a soft bun! However, based on my family needs, I renewed my Costco membership!\n\nYELP 250 CHALLENGE 2015: #230", "business_id": "fdpSckVuIARSUdI9Us4C9A", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-10-16", "type": "review"}

We got geared up and was given a lesson on climbing and belaying by our super friendly instructor. Climbing up my first wall with my husband belaying me, I didn't want to sit back or let go of the wall with fear of falling but the guy working, Bryan or Ryan, made me feel comfortable enough to trust the rope tied around my husband's waist, and sit back 30 feet up in the air. \n\nIt was all smooth sailing after that. My husband and I took turns climbing a bunch of walls for almost 2 hours, and by the end of the night, I couldn't climb one more wall because my arms had no strength left in them. My husband played around with bouldering because he's strong enough, but that wall with the little concave in it killed us both.

We've always had good to great service here. I've never had horrendous service in all of the times that I've been here. The only problem I see is that they seem understaffed by 1-2 people. This place gets insanely busy on most evenings and especially on the weekends. The waiters seem to be a bit overwhelmed at times, but never rude. \n\nAnother thing - people complain it's overpriced. First of all, they have half off wine on Mondays. That's a rarity. And think of all of the other places you drink wine or beer at. Everywhere is over priced for alcohol. They have to, in order to make money. This place does not do anything in the price difference compared to other $$ cost restaurants in town. \nWith the food - come on, guys. It is not overpriced. It is a higher quality than you're going to find walking in any chain restaurant. If you want cheaper prices, go stroll down the street until you find yourself in an Applebees. They offer fresh fish. Not fried fish sticks. \n\nThe top dishes I recommend - \n\nAnything with Halibut or seabass. Most of the times I come here, I get fish - and I'm not a fish lover. But they always have the best sauces that compliment the fish so well. \n\nThe filet oscar - each time we've had it, it's cooked perfectly to our request, topped with crab and it's served with asparagus and mashed potatoes. It's very flavorful and very tender. \n\nThe pork chops. I love them here. I'm always scared to get them at restaurants. They never seem to taste right and it's always with weird sauces. The pork chops here are thick, juicy and they have a great sweet wine sauce served on top. \n\nI love that they always have a good amount of specials on the board too.\nI'm pretty sure there isn't anything here that I haven't enjoyed. I've had so much, but there is a reason why we keep going back. \nAND there is a reason why this place is always busy - IT'S GOOD AND PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO PAY ABOVE AVERAGE FOR ABOVE AVERAGE FOOD. ;)\n\nDon't let these bad reviews scare you away - try it for yourself.", "business_id": "3MIy-ca6QVtKWXNzerQxWw", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-11-05", "type": "review"}

It was my first visit and I am impressed.  The place does not stand out physically by any means.  Not from the outside anyhow.  When you first walk in it does not seem any better.  The front counter looks like any Chinese take-out place.  Nothing special about it.  But I was quickly greeted and seated in a very friendly manner.  Service with a smile is a truism here.  The dining area is very clean and not in the least bit gimicky like some other Chinese places around town.  This is classy without being gaudy.  The blue floral print on the benches and seats if soothing and comfortable.  It also brightens up the room a bit.\n\nI began looking immediately to the noodle section of the menu.  I wanted chow fun noodles, my new favorite.  Before I found the dry style beef chow fun and decided on that, I was brought a pot of hot tea, a glass of ice water and a bowl of crispy fried noodles with sweet and sour.  It was like they read my mind.  Soon, the waitress came back to take my order.  She asked me if I ever had the dish before and told me a bit about it.  \"Fun with bean sprouts and beef\" and \"True Hong Kong style\" were how the dish was described to me.  I was also assured this was her favorite dish.  Maybe it is and maybe it isn't.  I sure liked it though.  The noodles were not as dried out and chewy as at some other places I have ordered chow fun from.  They were still tender but with that trademark chew of a rice noodle without being like rubber.  The beef was tender and delicious.  Maybe a bit sparse but honestly, with the bean sprouts and green onions mixed in with the noodles, the amount of beef was hardly disappointing.  I still came away full and floating away after a pot of tea and three glasses of water on top of my meal.  \n\nI'll be checking this place out again.  The food is good.  The service is excellent.

I am by no means a sushi expert. I am fairly new to sushi, so my review is based my personal tastes. \n\nI arrived with my wife just before 9pm. We were waiting on another couple to join us. We were hoping to sit at the sushi bar, as I find it more enjoyable, and enjoy talking to the sushi chefs as they work. The very small bar did not have four seats next to each other, so we sat at a table as we waited for our friends. A server took our drink order, and asked if we were ready to order. I told the server that we were waiting for two more people and we would wait for them to arrive before we ordered. While I appreciate the staff's desire to get our order, we were approached not less than 3 more times (all by different servers), and told them the same thing, that were waiting for friends. \n\nWhile we were waiting for our friends, seats opened up at the bar, so we moved there. I counted at least 6 chefs behind the bar, and it took several minutes for any of them to greet us. Since we were up at the bar, my wife and I decided to start ordering, My initial order consisted of Ahi Tuna, Crab Roll Sushi and a Philadelphia Roll. My wife is not a fan of sushi, but she did enjoy the crab roll sushi since it was fully cooked. The Ahi Tuna was decent, but a much smaller portion than I receive at other sushi places,  The biggest problem I had was with the Philadelphia Roll. It was tiny compared to other Philadelphia Rolls I have had, there was a very tiny amount of rice on the roll, and it was obviously not rolled tightly as it fell apart on the plate, and the rice simply started flaking off the seaweed. VERY disappointed in this roll. My wife actually decided to order another crab roll sushi since she enjoyed the first order so much. To end my experience, I decided to order the Tiger Roll, a specialty roll. It was fairly decent, no real complaints about that. \n\nOne interesting situation that occurred was when toward the end of our meal, One of the (less experienced, I assume) chefs was telling a story to another, and he pointed right at my wife and I, while speaking in a different language. The other (more experienced) chef quickly noticed the strange look on our face, and immediately explained he was telling a story about his friends that were sitting in that spot, and did not mean to disrespect us by appearing to talk about us in a foreign language. \n\nIf some of my friends really wanted to go to Yummy Sushi, I would probably join them, this place would not be my immediate first choice of Sushi restaurants.", "business_id": "bpGFetX8muk0GxAT3Oea3Q", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-09-11", "type": "review"}

Some things however, are unacceptable.\n\nThe extent of which your patio had spider webs, under the table, on the chairs, and on the ceiling is beyond unacceptable.  I understand it is outside and next to the water, making that a challenge, but it is a challenge that comes with such a space.  I imagine the investment in a power washer would be wise.  Especially since your patio is essentially your prime seating area.  If you get nothing from reading this, get that.\n\nIn terms of service, some things need to happen.  First, and more important than anything else as far as improving service at your establishment goes, is seating points.  It hasn't happened every time I have eaten there, but the one time it did happen was rediculous.  The server painfully, obviously, had either no regard or no idea what seating points are.

We enjoyed our time very much and the food and service were basically good.  Reservations for the patio help.\n\nSo why only three stars?  Value.  The food was good but not outstanding.\n\nCaesar's Salad: Take it--very good but an expected rendition.\n\nSteak Tartare:  Leave it--enjoyable, but the meat had tough spots and the quantity of capers overpower the mild beef.  The meat was too mild to hold up to the overwhelming capers.  Even the poached egg yoke and buttered toast was overpowered the meat.  The salted shallots to the side was the right compliment to the tartar.\n\nMaple Leaf Duck:  Leave it--There were tough veins in the duck but tender portions, too.  It was cooked perfectly.  Yet, it didn't really have flavors that enticed my taste buds.  The quince was a nice touch but didn't enhance the game.  The other side flavors were non descript.\n\nRoasted Chicken:  Take it--clearly the best dish we tried here.  Chicken sounds boring but it was much better than the duck.  The seasoning was subtle but done well.  The Spaetzle was enhanced with an herb reduction, which is more German than French, but who cares because it had an abundance of flavors that complimented the chicken.  We both thought this dish was extremely well executed.\n\nSides:  we only ordered the Mac and Cheese.  I hate mac and cheese but with the Gruyere (a type of Swiss cheese) they put in it, it was excellent (it has black truffles, too, but there is no way truffle is going to sneak through the Gruyere).  The cream of this side overpowered the duck but who cares, it was good.  Just don't order the duck.\n\nWine:  selecting a bottle of the wine in the store and then drinking it at the table was a novelty.  However, the prices are well over retail and the descriptions are a bit deceptive at times.  Look at the review next to the wine and it might have a 90+ rating.  Yet compare the vintage and it will be several years off.  Not honest in the wine world yet it can be informative.  Of course, then you add another $10 to open it at your table.  Fortunately, they offer wines as low as $15 so $25 for a bottle is affordable.\n\nService: we got excellent service and the fact that the waiter spoke with a French accent only made the night more romantic.\n\nAmbiance:  who would of thought that Tom Petty music could be romantic?  Well, the way the musician of the evening sung, he is.  And all the other great 80's music as well.  The live music was enjoyable but the uniqueness of dining on the water, with the moon dangling just under the patio, this is what one comes to Marche Bacchus for.\n\nDon't bring a generic gift card; they won't be able to get it to work.  And if you bring some special discount, they'll add gratuitiy immediately.  I don't think there really is such a thing as gratuity here; there is always a reason to require it so really there will always be a standard service charge of 18%.\n\nSo okay, it's a very high 3 stars, 5 if you only consider romance of it all but 3 if you consider the culinary aspect.", "business_id": "lqx--hrRwe0oK6WnFYNXlg", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-10-17", "type": "review"}

Usually, that is. This particular location's odd, uninviting customer service has just about ruined it for me. They really don't seem to have a clue what they're doing or how to do it.\nNot long ago, after ordering a taco combo plate, I had to return it because it was smothered in sour cream (for the first time in many visits). No big deal. Stuff happens, right? Well, everyone behind the counter acted like I was somehow at fault. The menus (paper and board) plainly list all of the stuff that comes on each item. Sour cream is listed in neither place, but they acted like I was being difficult for only wanting what was advertised on my tacos. \"No crema?\" over and over again. No...because it doesn't come on it! Granted, it was in Spanish, but the entire staff seemed to spend the next 10 minutes loudly debating the situation, the cook rolling his eyes and the server repeatedly checking the paper menu for proof of my mistake. Even on the 5th time, it still didn't say anything about sour cream. I will say that the manager did quickly step-in and tell them to remake my food, but even he seemed not to believe that they had messed-up in any way, that it was my fault. Eh, it is what it is. Everyone is entitled to an off day, right? Then last night, when my wife and I went back in, I made it a point to just go ahead and avoid any possible confusion by ordering my food without sour cream (that it obviously isn't supposed to come with in the first place). \"It doesn't come with it, sir.\"? Really? No shit? Well, maybe you should inform the rest of your staff because they clearly didn't get the memo. Anyway, when my wife tried to order a small plate of nachos, the cashier told her that they only had large plates left, so she had to order a large nacho instead. My wife asked why they couldn't just put the small portion on the larger plate for the appropriate price (It wasn't her fault their stock order was short), but the girl just smiled, said something that I think was mumbled Spanish and cheerfully said \"No\". That was that. Now, neither experience is some kind of massive, unbelievable offense, but they were both rather frustrating and, far beyond that, textbook examples of substandard, lazy, utterly unconcerned customer service.

Unfortunately, the reality of Sonic is a far cry from what is represented by the company in both written and visual advertising. \n\nLet's start with the service. The \"quick serve\" drive thru lane consistently has a faulty speaker system that makes it extremely difficult to place an order without having to repeat it several times. When I asked a question concerning its expansive menu, I would often receive a dead silent reply and no answers forthcoming. Add this to to the consistently long wait time for the food, and it leads to extremely high expectations to justify the wait. Unfortunately, this justification is also in vain. \n\nThe food quality has been extremely disappointing on all visits. Though I can say that the pretzel dogs are a shining light, the tater tots are consistently mushed together and served well below what I would consider to be an adequate temperature. \n\nThe value just isn't there either. I have no problem paying a premium for higher and fast food (like In N Out, for example) but Sonic just doesn't deliver on this aspect either. \n\nOverall, I am extremely disappointed  with both the food quality and service at this local Sonic and I simply cannot recommend it to anyone.", "business_id": "W3z8TV-MZIYkWgfN6cyJPg", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-09-07", "type": "review"}

While seeing a vet back home in California for this issue, he prescribed a $20 bottle of Gentizol and said to squeeze a few drops in her ear whenever I notice the infection returning. Easy peasy. And cheap.\nAt CRAH, the vet wanted to prescribe upwards of $150 worth of three or four different meds with lengthy instructions for care. I had to fight to only get the RX for the Gentizol, and even then the vet said that without the other meds, the infection will come back. Well of course it will come back, she has droopy ears! And as I knew, as soon as I got home and squeezed a few drops in her ear, it went away...and hasn't come back yet.\n\nAnother time, and another vet at CRAH, said that my dog had a heart murmur and wanted to order THOUSANDS of dollars worth of tests. I said no, and when I went back to California again, saw the same vet and he said that it wasn't a murmur at all, that because of her high level of energy, her blood tunnels because her heart pumps it out so fast. No big deal, and free advice to boot. \n\nThey do keep a clean facility, but I've never encountered another clinic that charges so much and trumps up every issue.", "business_id": "z0DM0MIg3dhNQHNNg99iGw", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-09-19", "type": "review"}

The waiting area is overall clean, but the front desk staff seems to at times be scattered. We brought in our elderly Jack Russell due to the fact that he was obviously in pain. He was shaking, softly whimpering and was becoming incontinent. They move you along quickly from the waiting area, but then you wait an eternity for the vet to come into the room. The rooms are not well ventilated and it starts to get pretty toasty really fast. I've had to leave and go into the waiting area to cool off several times.\n\nWhen the vet did come, she couldn't provide us with many answers. Her guess was that he tweaked his neck jumping off furniture because he refused to turn his head a certain way. We opted for blood work to be done and although there were some \"concerning\" things, since they were not accompanied by additional symptoms the vet dismissed them as possible causes for concern. She sent us home with six different medications ranging from antacids and a medication to help coat his stomach before the strong pain and anti inflammation pills were administered to tramadol and other medication for the inflammation and spasm. \n\nAbout a day later our dog started having seizures; 2-3 a day lasting a few minutes each. When I brought this up to the vet she felt that this was what caused his pain. He must have fallen during a seizure we missed and tweaked something. She was going to have him put on yet another medication to treat his seizures. I am not sure how we would have missed his previous seizures and suddenly started catching on after he started taking the meds. A few days later his seizures seemed to stop. He even looked like he might have started to perk up a bit. Until the late evening when he vomited his entire undigested breakfast. He started to hide in odd, dark places and soil himself. The next day he passed away as I held him in my arms. It was incredibly heartbreaking, but we found solace in the fact that he was no longer suffering and he passed surrounded by those who loved him the most.\n\nUltimately the visit to the vet and the money spent were pointless. All the medication did was cause him to suffer even more by adding seizures to the list of ailments. After doing some research I found out that tramadol was notorious for causing seizures. That should have tipped the vet off when we spoke on the phone a few days later. Instead she assumed this was happening all along and we just somehow missed it.", "business_id": "z0DM0MIg3dhNQHNNg99iGw", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-09-29", "type": "review"}

We decided to come check them out since most places were closed on Thanksgiving, but bars will be open even if the effing Rapture comes.\n\nSo I was feeling a beer, but there wasn't much selection (at least for a craft person like me). Grabbed ice teas and we shared a \"tall\" (24oz, $5) of NewCastle. This place has some really cheap pitchers (I believe they range from $5-9 bucks during game times/happy hour)  so it's a good spot if you like whats on draft (Bud, Bud Light, Miler, Coors, Newcastle, Fat Tire, Pyramid Hefe). \n\nWe got some appetizers:\n\nFried Mushrooms ($6.99)- these were quite nice. The batter was nicely seasoned and stayed very crunchy despite it holding a watery vegetable. I really like fried mushrooms but most places don't have a batter that holds up. \nArtichoke&Spinach dip ($6.99)- pretty standard, but done right. Melty, creamy goodness. I appreciate that the chips were warm. \n\nDinners:\n\nI grabbed the Red Rock chicken sandwich (grilled pineapple, teriyaki sauce and melted swiss cheese- $8.49) and got it with a side of potato salad. The sandwich was juicy and had a good crispy char. It was rather tall once the lettuce, onions, pickles and top bun come into play so it's a fork and knife kinda situation. The potato salad is the usual mustard mayo base and what I would describe best as a \"family picnic style\" w/ some shredded carrot, black olive, hardboiled egg, and a bit of macaroni. \n\nThe BF got a turkey club ($7.99) with spicy fries. The key with a club is crispy grilled bread (both sides), crispy bacon, quality turkey slices and fresh veggies in a proper ratio and you're golden. The spicy fries are not spicy, but more \"spice-y\" with a good layer of seasoning. \n\nYeah, we had a bit of room for dessert and grabbed a Xango (Deep fried banana caramel cheesecake wrapped in a pastry crust rolled in cinnamon sugar, topped with chocolate syrup and powdered sugar and whipped cream, $4.29) This was okay. Posed a bit of problem with the filling gushing out, but the flavors were decent. \n\nFYI- I posted pics and prices to help out, there is a usmenuguide for this place, but it is outdated. \n\nOriginally we dropped by a few days ago and while we were perusing the menu, the GM said they can't serve food because of a grease fire occurred a few hours earlier and it'll be a while. He apologized since he blanked out on it, gave us his card and invited us back to give them a try. He was so nice so we definitely made it a point to come back in. He did give us a discount for our meal, but definitely it was some solid bar food. I'm slowly starting to appreciate American food...haven't before and it's little quiet bars that are changing my mind about it. The only place for me that it lacks on is beer selection. I go to Big Dogs down the street if I'm feeling beer, but their menu at night is stripped down.

Crunched it.  His fault, and his insurance took care of it.\n\nI took it to Ultimate, and in a few days, my bumper looked good as new.\n\nLast month, some fool decided that he didn't want to get on the 95 on-ramp here, threw his car in reverse, and crunched up the front of my car.  Just smashed it to pieces.  Again, his fault, and insurance (after dragging FOREVER with this guy), took care of it.\n\nThis one was not a \"Quick and easy\".  This one took 15 days to fix.  But when I got it back, it looked like it rolled off the showroom floor.\n\nTwo days later, I had a small issue with my car.  Apparently, something hadn't been adjusted properly during the extensive repairs. They took the car in, tossed me in a rental, and then sent me on my way two days later.  That said, it was starting to become comical how many times I had to stop by this car place during the course of my Summer.\n\nThese guys are professionals.  They do a great job, and they are thorough.  And when I mentioned my remaining issue after the last repair, not one argument, stalling tactic, or \"drive it around a few days to see if it clears itself up\" nonsense I've heard from other repair places.  They asked me to bring it in, and now it runs even better.  Clearly, getting my car banged up has resulted in a better handling car in the long run.\n\nI'm very grateful to Ultimate for their solid, solid work.  Nice people, efficient staff, and reliable quality work.  They made a miserable Summer of unintentional demolition derby far more bearable to handle.\n\nAll the same, I hope I'm not in their business any time soon.

The last few times I have been here it has been frustrating. \nI go here every 3 months to get an oil change and car wash. I also have been bringing the hubby's car and he said no more after this last visit. \nNOTE: I drive all the way from Mountains Edge to get my cars serviced and washed. \nI was just there (10/6/13) to get my routine oil change and wash and it took OVER 2 hours! And when I got there, there was no one in the oil bay and only a few cars in the car wash area. When I checked in for the oil change they estimated about an hour to complete oil and wash (inside and out). Which is acceptable.  Once the oil change was complete, they ran it over to the car wash side and it literally just sat in the cash wash bay for over an hour. I was so tired of waiting, I walked over to see what was going on and there were 5-7 car wash personnel just hanging out. One guy was sitting in the passenger seat of my car texting on his phone. They are typically teenagers working here, which I don't mind because they usually do a great job, but these ones were slacking. When they pulled my car out of the bay, NOTHING had been cleaned! I had to tell them to re-clean everything. This is the last straw for me. This similar situation has been happening the last 2 or 3 times I have been here. I am sad to have to write a bad review for them but I am finding a new place to go now.\nDespite the bad car wash experience, the oil/lube people are always awesome! I just don't think its worth it for me to drive all the way to Summerlin anymore to wait over 2 hours for an oil change and car wash.  \n\nOverall, I give the cash wash side of this 0 stars and the oil lube 3 stars, which on average is about a 1.5 star.", "business_id": "s94k9HYj-Sk9veYM4fq8Eg", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-10-08", "type": "review"}

Dr. MacLeod cured me of an auto-immune disorder that the medical profession claims there is no cure for. So what the hell does this mean??? Is MacLeod Jesus or something? Because all I know is that my auto-immune disorder must have ascended to heaven after he was done with it. \n\nSummerlin Medical Center is really ritzy, clean, and technologically advanced. The Doctors here are no joke. Log off yelp and do your research for a bit.... google every Doctor with a private practice in this area. 90% of them got their medical degrees from overseas Med Schools located in places like Portugal, Uzbekistan, England, and the Caribbean. Most states will not allow individuals with degrees from those schools to practice. Nevada is one of the only states that allows unaccredited MDs from these Euro schools to practice. Now, google every doctor at the Summerlin Medical Center....you will see that all of them went to the very best medical schools in the united states. For example, Dr. MacLeod went to Western University of Health Sciences in Pomona California, which is fully accredited in all 50 states and rated by every major medical accreditation organization as the #1 school for Osteopathic surgery and medicine. This is practically the \"Harvard Law\" of D.O. medical degrees. It's the best you can get. And that's the kind of Doctor you get here. \n\nI recently went to an Urgent Care in Spring Valley which had all 5-star reviews from the Elite Squad. This place had a doctor who got his degree in South America. I spent the next 2 weeks recovering from adverse effects from a medication that hasn't been widely prescribed since world war II.

She brought me back a dress that was absolutely beautiful. When I put it on I cried an so did my bridesmaids. It was the one. It was my dress. I couldn't believe everything I wanted an dreamed about my wedding dress being was this. It was perfect. I couldn't thank her enough for making that day perfect for me. It was the first place I had been an it was my last. I absolutely love her. I recommend her to everyone. She is the best. Because of her I am getting all my bridesmaids dresses there an accessories. I can't wait to go back an work with her more. She knows her stuff an is very caring, patient, an knowledgeable. She listens to you what you want an does 100% to make you happy.

Knowing her before knowing she did hair was a plus.  I first started visiting her to have my eyebrows waxed.  Everytime she would wax them I would get compliments from people.  They were nice and even, but now I have waxed them too much that the hair rarely grows in and I only occasionally require my tweezers.  Now I just have her do my hair.\n\nTwo-three years ago I had fairly long hair and I had her shorten it little by little.  Two years ago this month she gave me a super cute A-line cut.  She used clippers in the back and scissors in the front.  I received so many compliments.\n\nNow I'm back to letting my hair grow long.  The night before I saw her this past January, I had a dream about a sideways braid.  Well, she was cutting my hair the day of a friend's wedding so I told her about my dream.  She did a great job at creating a braid going down the side of my head.  Many compliments once again.\n\nLast month I went to Mexico and they put my hair in braids at the beach.  I knew it was really damaged, so when I visited her last week, I told her to cut off whatever needed to go, even if it i shorter than I preferred; that's how much I trust her with haircuts.  She did take 2\" off and such but it still looks cute.  I don't want anyone else cutting my hair.  I have really curly hair and many people just don't know how to cut curly hair.  \n\nMy only regret is I cannot afford to have my hair colored at the salon.

Not sure why someone inexperienced would be working the VIP line. When I made the reservation I asked if it was possible to check-in early. No problem they said, as long as there was a room available. Well, we arrived early asked to check-in and there were no rooms available. However, the couple we were meeting checked-in at the same time and they had a room. Not surprisingly, they found a room for us too.\n\nOn to the room. We were given a room in the Ocean View tower and the elevators made really incredible noises, shook and jerked as we made our way up to our floor. The hotel was built in 1973 and it appears general maintenance and paint have eluded each of the owners through the years. The room was clean enough although there were some minor maintenance issues. The grates on the A/C unit had been moved so that they covered the controls. The strike plate on the bathroom door was loose, so the door stuck each time it was closed. There was a vanity with mirror, but no electrical outlets. When I decided to plug in the phone charger, I noticed there was only one open outlet in the entire room. I tend to walk around in socks while in the room and noticed that the bottoms were picking up dirt from the carpets, even though housekeeping had allegedly vacuumed the room before we checked in. Lastly when I decided to get ice, there was no ice bucket. Housekeeping delivered a plastic beer bucket for me to use, which meant repeated trips to the ice machine.\n\nThe service was okay. Generally the staff was friendly, but appeared overwhelmed. The valet was also the bell desk clerk, which meant either your car or luggage would be delayed at any given time. They also weren't sure that our room was occupied. At 4:30 in the morning I was awakened by pounding at the door. When I got up they announced themselves as \"housekeeping\" and wanted to know why I was in an unoccupied room. Shortly afterwards an alarm began sounding from the service elevator. I assume it went out because staff was using the guest elevators to reach floors. \n\nAt check-out I was presented a bill and told that my credit card was not charged enough for the \"room hold\" and that they would have to add another $25. I had to argue that I had not charged anything to the room. I finally left with a zero balance due.\n\nIt's obvious that the property is in bankruptcy and running on a shoestring. take advantage of the cheap room rates, but be aware that this is one instance where you will definitely get what you pay for.", "business_id": "KJnVuzpveyDrHARVNZaYVg", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-10-21", "type": "review"}

It's a five minute walk or so, and it's also directly opposite the monorail station at MGM so it's pretty easy to get around from here.

There was never a line for a taxi and always a taxi outside waiting, while across the road at MGM there seemed to be dozens of people waiting for one.

The fries were ice cold and hard as a rock, my girlfriends sandwhich had onion on it and my wings were over cooked as per usual on a slow night.

So we call the manager to come over. \n\nWe explain the situation to David, and he offers to remake the food for a third time and claims to see no hair after I pick up the pickle and show it to him. We say no we dont want to we want to leave. So he says were more than welcome to leave our food has been comped. \n\nSo we leave as we are leaving, I see David talking to another guy who keeps looking over at me, and nodding his head so I stop. David walked back over to me, and I asked what the problem was. He said nothing but you are more than welcome not to return to the resturant. I asked him why he said oh because we obvisiouly cant make you people happy. Ok fine. \n\nI go back today and speak with Bill the general manager.

My fianc\u00e9 and I went in because he wanted a new truck, Kyle was so patient and showed us what our best options were. We found a few trucks but at first they didn't have the one my fianc\u00e9 wanted. Kyle showed us one more truck and we test drove it, then we bought the truck. Our finance guy Kevin, was just as great also. He did his best to give us a lower apr. Explained to us the best warranty for the truck. They didn't have the floor mats in the truck because they said people have been stealing them so they ordered us new ones & we just picked them a few days later. Thank you Kyle, Martin & Kevin for all your help!", "business_id": "gwCWL6Vc9imaTNNpO7sfFg", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-09-24", "type": "review"}
