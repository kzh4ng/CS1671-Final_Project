I really love their 365 Brand and I'm just resigned to not being able to buy everything I want at one grocery store. Eg. I would love it if Whole Foods sold non-frozen Ezekiel's bread. \n\nI actually buy  a lot of basics here and some of them end up being cheaper than  Trader Joe's or Giant Eagle.\n\nThings I always buy at Whole Foods and no where else, bec. I have found it way better in price/quality:\n-365 Brand Tofu (MUCH better that Trader Joe's tofu that has  weird texture)\n-365 Brand dried beans/canned beans\n-365 Brand butter (no BST)\n-365 Brand Edamame (is far better than Trader Joe's Edamame which has a strange smell).\n-365 Brand whole wheat flour\n\nOf course I prefer Trader Joe's for their peanut butter(bec. it has no salt) and Ezekiel's bread. And I do end up buying their coffee, bec. it's slightly cheaper than the Allegro Coffee at Whole Foods.

If the zucchinis at Market District looked a little weak, give Whole Foods a try.

I've been brushed on the leg and knee multiple times by cut-throat drivers in that parking lot.  I believe they would park INSIDE the store if they could).\nI don't complain about the prices, because the food, and health benefits, are worth it in the long-term.  Not so long ago, I was forking out hundreds of dollars a month in prescription medications because my diet was HORRIBLE.  Since making the decision over two years ago to be more active and eat solely organic and Non-GMO, I'm off all of my medications, and the price of organic food is NOTHING compared to medications and prescriptions.  I'm actually saving money.  And No, I don't even make $20K a year - so it's all about choices.  I'm not \"rich\" at all, like most people assume, since I regularly shop there.  In fact, I'm usually dead broke.  But to me, eating whole and healthy and protecting my body is not a luxury, it's a necessity.\nI also like that there is no pharmacy in Whole Foods.  That should say something.\nMy love for Whole Foods resides in the Organic Salad Bar, and Prepared Foods section.  Their salad bar is so fresh and so delicious, that eating salads anywhere else becomes TASTELESS.  Organic makes all the difference.\nMy favorite Prepared Foods is their Vegan General Tso's \"chicken\".  Little popcorn nuggets of Seitan, drenched in the best General Tso's sauce I've ever tasted, with steamed broccoli.  Molly's Sesame Noodles on the salad bar is our favorite side dish to this prepared foods treat.  I swear we eat it at least once a week.\nWe also love their Bulk Section where we can get bulk quinoa, granola, lentils, and all kinds of things for a really decent price.  \nThe secret to shopping at Whole Foods?   BUY WHAT YOU NEED TO EAT THAT DAY.  It's not smart to bulk shop organic produce, because it goes bad faster.  Buy what you KNOW you're going to eat.  You won't see 10/$10 deals, because the food isn't crap, and you're not supposed to stockpile fresh foods.  You're supposed to eat it when it's fresh.  And buy your dry stock at Trader Joe's or the East End Food Co-Op.\nI love Whole Foods.

I have never seen such expensive rice! Here is the bro-down...\n\nThe food: Plentiful and too expensive to even think of buying. The freshest fish that isn't in the Strip...but you need to take a second mortgage to buy fish for a family. I bought sushi rice, a piece of fish and a salad, my bill: $25! The salad with lettuce, carrots, chick peas, onions and about 5 pieces of chicken was $11+\n\nThe employees: Hipsters with thick-rimmed glasses, tattoos and facial piercings that slack like I have never seen \"workers\" slack before. In fact there was a sign above some fresh fish stating \"We will prepare you fish any way you want, just ask\" HA...HA! When I asked to have a tiny fish to be filleted (something that would take me about 10 seconds at home) I was scoffed at by the so called fish monger who was obviously not a trained fish monger, but got his job because of his Progressive music of the soviet era bachelors degree . It took him the better part of 20 minutes to fillet a f-ing fish! All I got was a chopped up piece of crap that was useless. And scoffing is what these people are good at. Pushing your cart down the aisles is like running a scoffing gauntlet. Staff huff and puff when you get in their way?! The cashiers just stand and talk to each other or run to get organic iced tea to drink WHILE they ring you up...they don't even do that at Giant Eagle!\n\nThe other customers: This one is a peach! If you're not pulling in a good $60K a year you are dirt to these people. I was at the salad bar (it is a good salad bar, but expensive) an older woman in a mink coat bumped, no, pushed into me then stared at me and turned her nose up at me, can you believe it? She actually turned her nose up at me! Others in the aisles will grunt like cantankerous old people if they can't get through. They push ahead in line, give you dirty looks, and act like it's a class struggle...it kind of is!\n\nSo unless you have a lot (i mean A LOT) of disposable income, have never needed to use coupons, drive a $50K car (parking is terrible there), are the president of the United States, CEO of Microsoft, a widow whose wardrobe is more extensive than the explanation of the formula explaining an event horizon or a hipster who looks poor, but lives off daddy and mommy (though they'll never admit it) you shouldn't and really won't be able to afford this place...but why would you want to?\n\nI'll stick with Trader Joe's for my alternative market, thank you!

The first time that we stopped was on a Sunday morning when the cart came into view with all of its nice looking breads.  I have walked by the cart and store many times before without really stopping to check it out.  That day we decided to though since I was hungry and did not want a full meal and boy am I glad that we did.  Originally I was just going to get one of the loaves of bread to have a bit then and save for later but then I noticed some true french bread pizza (aka pizza toppings on top of a slice of french bread) which I ended up getting.  While I was ordering that my fiance noticed some Sfogliatelle and she ended up ordering one of those as well.  I think the total cost was $3 and Jimmy told us the story of how the sfogliatelle was created while chomping on his cigar.  Both of our items were good and both my fiance and I were espcially impressed with the sfogliatelle.  It had a lot more filling than we are used to getting as well as a more orangy flavor which made it extra good.  Honeslty she was just happy to find a good Sfogliatelle in Pittsburgh.  She is Italian and is used to getting them with some family members at some Italian bakeries in NYC.  The second time that we came here was once again at the cart on a Sunday when Jimmy enticed us with sfogliatelle that was fresh out of the oven and still warm.  Finally the last time that we came was on a Saturday and so the whole store was open, not just the cart.  It was interesting to look around inside and see everything that I had been missing by walking past it all of these years.

It's just.....chocolate, as far as you can see.  Gourmet, imported chocolate.  And some other types of candy as well, in old fashioned glass jars, or artfully displayed on a table.  Candy from Asia, candy from Britain.  Chocolate from Europe, South America, Africa.  Some of the bars looked incredible - some were priced at $15 or more, which totally blew my mind.  They had an intriguing section near the front devoted to baking chocolate, with chips, whole bars, and cool things like butterscotch and white chocolate baking pieces.  They also have gelato, and some unwrapped candies that look fresh made, behind a front counter.\n\nWe bought the aforementioned lavender sea salt caramels, and a few other bars.  It's a pretty pricey store, but it was clearly an incredible place that any chocolate fan should explore.  It's hard for me to judge since candy is not my favorite, but I enjoyed what I tried.  The caramels were coated in dark chocolate and did have a really interesting, herbal quality from the lavender.  I also tried an Irish Whiskey truffle bar that my boyfriend got - I don't care much for dark chocolate so it was too rich for me, but i liked the creamy center.\n\nDefinitely for the chocolate fan - especially if you like dark chocolate, they have countless varieties of it.

When i got them home I noticed that the baba was watery and didn't look normal. I tasted it (and so did a friend) and could not serve it to guests. I then opened the hummus and was surprised that it also did not taste very good. I served it anyways and it was left uneaten by the crowd. I also was surprised that some of the olives I purchased were dried out. I wonder... what is happening to one of my favorite stores?

As good as it gets!\" rating. This place is as good as it gets for Italian grocers and delis in Pittsburgh, but is it not quite as good as my all-time favorite, DiPaolo's Dairy on the corner of Grand and Mott in NYC. Short of making the seven hour drive to Little Italy, this place is truly the best in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe star attraction of Penn Mac is their deli. They have a wide selection of nearly one hundred cheeses from across the US, to imports not only from Italy, but around the world as well. The people working the counters are very nice and helpful no matter how busy they are or how little you know. I remember I was there one busy Saturday afternoon and said \"I am looking for a cheese to go with this sopresatta.\" Rather than roll their eyes and say \"NEXT!\", the lady and gentleman behind the counter broke out the cheese knives and handed me half a dozen slices of different cheeses. I ended up buying a pound of Spanish manchego and a pound of trugole, what they describe as an Italian table cheese.\n\nRight next to the cheese counter is the meat department. Again, while Penn Mac definitely specializes in cured Italian meats, they also have a very wide selection of meats from around the country as well. \"Is the Genoa salame from Genoa priced a little out of your league? Well then try this Wisconsin hard salame.\" Quotes like that fly back and forth across the deli counter so many time it is hard to keep track. To me, that's what customer service is about. The people there get it. They understand that by being nice to me, and helping me, and letting me try what I am buying before they slice it, they may not make a sale of something that sells for thirty dollars a pound, but they might mak a sale of something that is fifteen dollars a pound. Better to make a small sale than no sale. By treating their customers with such hospitalityand respect, not only am I going to come back, but I am going to send all my friends there too.\n\nDon't think that Penn Mac is only good for meat and cheese either. They are a full on Italian grocer. My godmother is a full blooded Italian who spends six months out of the year in her parents' old house in Italy, and she would be impressed with the selection at Penn Mac. They have a pasta and sauce section that has almost every variety and brand of dried pasta fdrom the US and Italy. Right as you come in there is also a fantastic spice selection as well, maybe not as wide a selection as Penzey's but then again that is whay Penzey's specializes in. Penn Mac also stocks a plethora of olive oils and balsamic vinegars. Do yourself a favor, swing by and after you get your cured meats and cheeses, pick up a bottle of really good extra virgin olive oil, a middle of the road balsamic vinegar, and an expensive bottle of balsamic vinegar. I dropped almost a hundred bucks on a bottle of very very good balsamic vinegar (I am not saying which because I want it to still be there when I go back) and let me say, the cheap stuff you gett at Giant Eagle has nothing on this. It is sweet and salty and rich and complex. Sometimes I just drink it. \n\nPenn Mac also has a very good bakery. The downside is that if you go there any time past noon, most of the bread is gone. What I have been able to get has been good rustic bread; soft and chewy on the inside and insanely crusty on the outside. Kind of like me come to think of it. If your cholesterol is making you feel guilty about all the meat, cheese and oil, Penn Mac is also home to a very nice little farm fresh vegetable section.\n\nTo sum it all up, Penn Mac is everrything a good deli should be. Wide variety, friendly staff, and a great location. I can't wait to go back.", "business_id": "niW0ggRVPW5fafcfImdK7w", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-05-21", "type": "review"}

We have a friend from D.C. who makes a point of shopping here when she's in town. I ask: Isn't there anyplace in DC (well, Tacoma Park) like this. The answer is \"no\". \n\nI like that he owners have worked hard to create a destination for food; they keep fiddling with their formula. I have been shopping here for at least 30 years and have seen it get better and better over the years. It used to be a rough-ish semi-wholesale place (e.g. minimum cheese cut was 1lb). The area around there had 5-6 produce stores, and a general feel of a terminal district. But there were changes, Nino broke away, produce stored faded away. Over time the area has turned into something more of a destination for a safely exotic Saturday excursion. As others have pointed out. Penn Mac has kept up.  On Saturdays I try to shop 8-9am, before the place gets crazy.\n\nI go there for cheese (varied, fresh and sometimes cheap) and deli meats (a decent though limited selection; porchetta and smoked pancetta appeared only in the last couple of years; prosciutto salami disappeared), as well as staples (pasta, oil, flour, capers, etc). On Saturdays they stock fresh Breadworks bread (in artisan Italian styles) and fresh pasta (from some place in Ohio: yummy). \n\nSome useful hints: by the end of Saturday, before closing, the bread goes down to an agreeable 1/2 price. They're open Sundays and seem to be way less busy. They are open during the week, and pleasantly uncrowded. They have a nice selection of flours, and dry pastas. Their balsamic selection seems to have mostly slid down to the fancy-looking bottle end of the spectrum. \n\nMore globally, Penn Mac comes across as a local institution. It's very different from a comparable store in Italy, or even in Canada. Those tend to be tidier and more business-like. Penn Mac tries to be a shopping \"experience\". But it works. \n\n(Personal wish: a real Italian butcher shop in Pittsburgh.

Having grown up in New Jersey and being a frequent NYC visitor, I know a good Italian market when I'm in one.  Penn Mac?  Is a GREAT Italian market, and when I walked in and smelled the delectable funk from the cheese counter I knew I was going to be dropping a lot of money and packing those coolers full.\n\nIf you're a cheese lover you need to come here, for it has literally hundreds of different types.  Deli meats?  Got you covered.  Olive oil?  Lots in barrels ready to decant.  If you love pasta you just might lose your mind.  Tomato products?  Everything you want and a few of which you've never heard.  Breads, desserts, olives ... pardon me for a moment.  (discreetly wipes away drool)  Add in a super friendly and helpful staff and surprisingly reasonable prices and you have one of the better shopping experiences.

When I handed him a package of mortadella he immediately opened it and popped a slice into his mouth--and almost wept with joy.

Not at all, but it's not obscenely priced either.\n\nA quick note on the cheese counter - large and global, and the few times I've bought a hunk, it had obviously been well cared for, but EF's, down the street, is larger and more locally focused.

It was colorless, tasteless, looked like paper the sandwich was wrapped in, the cheapest of the domestic imitations IOWs. \n\nTHIS is what Parma prosciutto  looks like: bright pink : http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Prosciutto_di_Parma_-_affettato2.jpg/640px-Prosciutto_di_Parma_-_affettato2.jpg\n\nI ate the transparent slice of prosciutto on its own and still could not taste any of it, you'd probably need a much thicker slice to get any flavor. \n\nI went back inside and checked the cold cut counter and sure enough not one of their 4 types of prosciutto on display looked anything like it. So what you get in a D&D sub is a thin portion of cheap domestic cold cuts pretending to be imported.\n\nI called the manager, he said he would talk to the chef about it (I smell bull) and refunded me.

Yes, prices are high for most students, but low compared to other local health food stores.

They have a lot of local produce, though the selection obviously things during the winter. The local aspect allows you to discover just how good truly  fresh produce can taste. Eating local actually brought more variety into my diet, such as \"watermelon\" radishes, which are pink fleshed, and the delicious alien-like ground plant known is the kohlrabi. Other great local items are the goat cheese and the artisan bread from nearby Monticello (wish it were sliced though). \n\nThey also have a bulk section with nut butters, spices, teas, grains, and pasta, which is nice since it allows you to buy what you need. Other more typical health food staples are here too, like Reed's ginger ales, brown cow yogurt (yum!) and Newman's Own cookies.  \n\nThey also now sell local meat from Triple S Farms, which is grass-fed and pasture-raised.  \n\nThe other bonus of coming here is that if you join you can get involved with potlucks and other events the Co-op plans. These are fun and a great way to meet people in the area and hear about developments in the local food movement.\n\nThere is currently a membership fee, which is refundable if you relocate and you can try it a couple of times before you join. However, soon they are planning to open it up completely to the public.\n\nLocation is a plus.

Sadly, when I took my first bite, out spewed a white, mayonnaise-like substance. The burro's filling was more like a fish salad of sorts and it tasted off. Very off. And the fish wasn't hot. Actually, nothing it the burro was the least bit warm. And the guacamole was on the side--not inside the burro. But again, I was starving at this point so I took it down. Every last bite.\n\nI knew immediately that something was wrong. I considered removing the food from my body as soon as I got outside, but I decided to keep my finger out of mouth and let things settle. Big mistake. There would be no settling. I consider myself to have an iron gut, too. I can basically eat anything in any quantity (not that I do this often) but normally I have good luck. I haven't been this sick since eating food from a middle-of-nowhere farmstand while bike touring in the Caribbean.\n\nI'm giving La Tolteca two stars because I did like their hot sauces--all of them. And they have cheap beer, too ($2 Coronas all day, every day). However, as Michael S. noted in an earlier review, everything I tried tasted off. Tangy is fine when that's what a place is going for, but everything I ate tasted slightly tangy in a ugh-this-is-going-to-make-me-sick sort of way. Not cool.\n\nSo that's that. I really don't think I'll be back. I have no desire to explore the bakery case and there's way too many small taquerias around to take any more chances with this high-volume, supermarket of a restaurant.", "business_id": "apCfJVnRyaw6oVUBKujpUQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-05-03", "type": "review"}

They have a small grocery section, to where you can even get yourself a 40-quart tamale steamer, obviously you can use it for other uses as well. They sell masa, and anything else you would need to make your own dishes at home. \nThey have an extensive bakery with fresh baked goods that they are continuously bringing fresh baked goods out. They make cakes, flan, tres leches, and many other delicious desserts, and can customize an order for you and make you anything you'd like. They even have samples available, and of course I'm one of those guys who goes hog wild on samples :)\nThey have a meat section too, to where you can get 1/4-whole chickens, ribs, and other meats. They make fresh guacamole, queso fresco, and many other delights.\nTheir food selection is huge, and it would take me awhile just to try everything from the 5lb super torta, he super burrito, soups, breakfast items, and many other foods.\nThey even cater!\nToday I had my usual, three mini cabeza tacos, refried beans, and horchata.\nTheir cabeza is the best I've had. It's juicy, crisp, flavorful, and not greasy in one bit unlike most places that make cabeza.\nThe beans were delicious and moist. They weren't dried out of pasty like you may find at some quick stop Mexican restaurants or chains.\nHorchata is great no matter where you go.\nPrices are inexpensive no matter what you get, and for someone on a budget like myself, it's a great deal. You can fill yourself up on food and not break the bank.\nI highly recommend stopping here and trying something new, it's not some Taco Bell so don't come in here expecting some Americanized garbage.

I had to return the fruit because my friend was unexpectedly called out of the country.

Not only was it embarrassing, it was time wasting, and really..do that many people try to sneak in and return Dragon Fruit from somewhere else?\nI did go home, combed through the trash, found the receipt, brought it back and returned it to the manager.  I told her I had never had any issues at this store in the past, (I've always been dealt with  courteously and professionally) Her response was \"we have to follow the rules\".

I went with five other guys who ordered a mix of their signature sandwiches (Doughboy, Bizmark, Manhattan), and all agreed you can get a similar sandwich at grocery stores and preferred even the likes of Sack's to this place.

I'm a huge fan of their smoked Linguisa and their' Chorico. They also have these odds and ends mixed sausage-brat-hotdog skewers for like 2 bucks a pound,and I'm a real sucker for those! The prices are awesome, you can get out under $20 with a great mix of sausages and brats for the grill.

Grilled the linguisa.  It had a great, mild  taste and the casing cooked up to a beautiful, crisp delight.  Put the smoked linguisa in a sort of Spanish stew of tomatoes with lots of paprika, garlic and onions and chicken and it was great.  For me, the andouille was a standout.  It's a bit spicy, which I like, with a perfect meld of flavors.  I crisped it up in a pan and served at breakfast with eggs and caramelized onions.  Really great.

It started off innocent enough.  I would browse every now and again and marvel at the array of products.  Back then, I would never really buy anything, but I would promise myself that I could have whatever I wanted once I renovated my kitchen.  It took me a long time to achieve that goal, but eventually I did.  Then the flirtation blossomed into my first purchase.  My torrid affair with Williams-Sonoma has been raging for a couple of years now.\n\nIn Phoenix, the Biltmore Fashion Park store is my favorite Williams-Sonoma location.  The one at the Fashion Square is okay, but it feels cramped.  I travel for business and I seek out Williams-Sonoma stores on the road.  The one in Oak Brook (suburban Chicago) is nice.  The store in Walnut Creek, CA is also nice.  The new flagship in Union Square in San Francisco is like Williams-Sonoma Mecca!  It's four floors of everything Williams-Sonoma carries as well as artifacts from Chuck Williams' own kitchen.  It's like a Williams-Sonoma museum combined with the entire product line.  As a side note, the original Williams-Sonoma store that was on the square in Sonoma has been closed.  The Union Square store replaced it.\n\nWilliams-Sonoma is the best!  The products are all of the finest quality and they stand by everything they sell.  If you ever have a problem, they will take the item back with no questions asked and give you store credit if you don't have your receipt.    \nI've bought everything at Williams-Sonoma from my Le Creuset Doufeu to Fleur de Sel French sea salt.  If you love to cook, this is the place for you.  If you bake or cook a lot, be sure to check out their All-Clad Stainless Steel Measuring Cups & Spoons.  The measuring cups are adorable because they're miniature versions of the All-Clad saucepan.  For standard measures, they offer sets of both four cups and spoons: 1/4, 1/3, 1/2 and 1 cup; 1/4 tsp, 1/2 tsp, 1 tsp and 1 Tbs.  The really handy items are the odd-size sets.  They offer sets of both cups and spoons in the following odd sizes: 2/3 cup, 3/4 cup and 1 1/2 cups; 2 tsp, 1 1/2 Tbs and 2 Tbs.  All the spoons stack together into a cute space-saving group.  All four sets of measures make an awesome gift!\n\nDon't overlook their website.  Sometimes they will have Special Offers for products online that can be upwards of 50% off of the same items in the stores.  This drives the BF a bit crazy because he thinks their pricing should be consistent across all retail channels, but I'm willing to check their website frequently as I have found a number of bargains online.", "business_id": "31bXixwy2GNmRlhpl21reA", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-05-28", "type": "review"}

Maybe I'm spoiled with the shelf space and layout of the one on Mayo in Scottsdale (a flagship store built in 2008), but this Shea store is about a third of the size, if that. EVERY time I have gone there (it's much closer to me than the Mayo location), they NEVER have what I need. Whether it's a type of hummus, cosmetic, vitamin, flax oil, it's never there like it is on Mayo. They just don't have the shelf space.\n\nToday, I tried one more time for Barlean's flax oil. Oh, they had it, but the 16oz sizes had been sitting on the shelf since November (it says on the bottles when they are created) and due to expire in one month. Shows how little product they move. They just don't have the customer turnover. I looked for a hummus they had at the Mayo location and they didn't carry that either. When I asked about the brand, they tried to sell me something else that I didn't want. Weak. \n\nMy other major complaint and apparently it is a common one according to the staff, is that they have a HUGE display of bath salts (open) and soaps sitting out near all the food smack in the middle of the store. If you want flax oil, you'd better be good at holding your breath. It was so strong that just from walking through the area once, my boyfriend asked me \"what is that smell, it smells like cheap perfume soap or something\" on me when I got home. Wow. It's really bad for anyone with perfume sensitivities which is a lot of people in AZ, one of the worst allergy zones in the country. \n\nI mean, Whole Foods is supposed to be a mecca of health, not stench and inconvenience. \n\nThis long-time customer will be exclusively shopping (and dropping lots of cash) at Mayo from now on.

I am not sure how it would be on a summer day in Phoenix, but March was perfect, especially with umbrellas to cover from the sun. Our food arrived fairly quickly.

I had the albacore tuna sandwich which had jicama in it! I've never heard of such a thing, but I have to tell you it was delicious! We sat out at the picnic tables soaking up the rays eating our sandwiches and drinking the homemade lemonade which wasn't too sweet or sour...just the way I like it! : )\n\nThe Farm's menu consists of sandwiches and salads..but boy, do they have tons of little \"treats\"!  Cookies, tarts, pies, and so much more...but only one that caught my eye was the this thing I'm calling the \"Coconut Ball\"! It looked sooo good and was looking forward to getting one after my lunch..but I was too full! BOO!!  So if anyone stops by that place and tries it, you'll have to report how good it was! : )  - I'd definitely stop by here again the next time I'm down this way!", "business_id": "MLcXtnpzygZvQ9BtseLLlw", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-04-16", "type": "review"}
