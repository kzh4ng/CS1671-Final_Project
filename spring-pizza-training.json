You see we were looking at eating it there and they have no tables.  Thankfully it was nice outside and they did have a couple of seats in front although that left us subjected to the cigarette smoke of the workers and a crazy group of loud people right next to us.\n\nFor our dinner we decided to order a XL cheese pizza and also a large white pizza.  We started with the white pizza and boy did it hit the spot.  The crust was crunchy, the garlic and herbs in the oil sauce were tasty and the cheese was decent as well.  Our red pizza was a similar experience as I imagine the cheese and crust were the same and while the red sauce was good, it lacked a little of the oomph that white sauce had.  Overall though they were two very solid pizzas that I enjoyed.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in the future.

My family and I went to this place Saturday evening based on the reviews here on Yelp and other sites such as Urbanspoon.  4 of us ordered chicken Parmesan, a pretty good yardstick for determining how the food is in any Italian restaurant.  After each of us took our first bite, we all lookedvat each other with the sort of face you make when you are wondering what was that.  The look was followed by universal disdain for this so called meal.  The chicken was inedible , the sauce was nothing resembling tomato sauce found on 99% of all Italian meals.  We should have been tipped off when the chicken was grilled not breaded as is the case with this dish.  BLAND.  GROSS.  TERRIBLE.  Now comes the part that totally caused me to write this.  We sent it all back.  We were asked \"would you like something else?\".  Not a chance.  If this was the indicator for the so called cuisine we wanted nothing to do with it.  The \"manager\" came to our table.  \"You have to pay for the entire meal\".  Seriously?  Seriously!  Now again in 99% of the time when food is returned, the normal proper way of doing business is to say \"sorry you didn't like your food.  We will deduct the cost from your bill\".  LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.  In the face of protecting my family from the embarassment of the police being called, I paid $83 for this CRAP. $83!!!  As I left I suggested the manager change this policy.  It was met with a smirk and defiance.  In the face of my saying the social media world will hear about this, she couldn't care less.  So, here it is. For those of you who gave this place a positive review, I have to ask \"Seriously?\".

That's how long my four-year-old son and I waited from the time we sat down until we received our lunch. Granted, my son is more patient than most children his age, but after about 20 minutes, he started to ask about where his food was. This occurred on Good Friday between 1:30 and 2:30 pm.\n\nI guess I should have been alerted to this situation from the moment I walked in. No one greeted us, and it took about three minutes before we were even acknowledged. We wanted to sit outside, but after 60 seconds of debating with a colleague, the gentleman told us there were no outside seats - although we clearly saw two empty tables. Then, the shirts on the employees said, \"Unique like a Brooklyn accent.\" I really should question a company that doesn't use proper grammar. (It should read, \"Unique, like a Brooklyn accent.\")\n\nThe person who seated us also took our order moments after we sat down. I asked for apple juice for my son and was told they were out, so we switched to iced tea for him and water with lemon for me. We shortly received our drinks - sans lemon. \n\nAfter we were there about 10 minutes, a large party of 10 was seated near us. Half were small children my son's age and they received lemons with their beverages, so my thought that the restaurant was perhaps out of those too was erased. Unfortunately, our waiter never checked on us, and I actually had to flag him down as my son was whining for food to get a water refill and ask - again - for a lemon. It was then that he told me he'd check on our food.\n\nFINALLY, 35 minutes in, our food arrived. I think we were so hungry at that point that dirt would have sufficed. My son doesn't usually like mac and cheese that is penne with cheese sauce, but he ate nearly all of it. My eggplant lasagna was certainly not the best I've had. Neither of our items was baked, so I'm still not sure what the holdup was. And, by the way, the table of 10 received their food before we did and came and left in the hour we were there. While I'm complaining, my son's ice cream was so frozen I almost needed a knife to cut it for him.\n\nI would like to say the poor service was because the restaurant was understaffed. Although the place was full, I counted seven employees, including a manager. Other tables were receiving much better service, so I'd have to say the problem was more with our server (who never shared his name). My son and I eat out about once a week, and I always leave 20% for a tip, but this time I left $1 on a $16 bill. At first, I felt badly about it, but then I remembered, \"Oh yeah, it's not like I'm ever coming back here.\"\n\n*** On 4/5/10, Alana, a representative from NYPD Pizza sent me an e-mail when she came across my review and offered her sincere apologies, a follow-up call from customer service, and a coupon for a free pizza / meal. I was very appreciative of the response, and as I told her, I've been to other NYPD Pizza locations with much better results; I think this episode was the result of a new or poorly trained server.", "business_id": "TqHTtjPANCBKGsjGBjDoQQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-04-02", "type": "review"}

After buying one of those playing card decks with restaurant discounts, we finally tried Spinato's (after living in Phoenix since 2003). Yes, I fully realize how ridiculous it is that I hadn't been here sooner. \n\nThere are so many great things about this restaurant ranging from the service, food, deals (coupon and daily deals), and conveniences (order ahead while waiting for a table). From the time we sat down (both visits), the service was top-notch and friendly. \n\nFirst visit, we had the specialty spinach pizza with plenty of garlic and tomatoes ($15 for a medium). It was delicious but way too much pizza for us 4 when we paired it when their large order of ravioli and two meatball. That was so good too! Oh did I forget to mention the garlic cheese bread that we ordered with the baked bread and butter. Both, simply amazing. Clearly I was aiming for the food going straight towards my waistline. I also had a glass of wine since they are half off on Sundays and made sure to get some of their chocolate chip cookies to go. \n\nFor the second visit (a week later), we dialed it back a bit. Of course we had to have the garlic cheese bread, kids ravioli ($5 for the ravioli, a breadstick, drink, and scoop of gelato), small specialty pizza ($10 and plenty for my husband and son to share) and I had the \"lil\" spinach calzone (7\" for $5). That calzone was so delicious, I couldn't save the half I set aside for lunch. Add two glasses of wine (half off), and two piccola brownie desserts, and our total bill was $45. For a family of four with drinks, an appetizer and 2 desserts???? Pretty damn reasonable in this day in age. And it has been a long time since I was that blissfully satisfied with a meal (or two).

I have had one bad experience after another with these guys.  The pizza is great, IF you ever receive it after they tell you it will be a 30-min. delivery, then you call back after 1hour and they tell you \"the driver is on his way\", then you call back after another half hour and they can not locate your order... WTF???? have you ever heard of a COMPUTER system where you LOG orders when people call????  I know, what a fantastically high-tech concept but then maybe people would get the pizza they ordered.  I am finally writing this review because i just had the same experience at a Domino's in Phoenix ( I live in San Fran and usually order from there), (COULDN'T BELIEVE IT), so this seems to be a widespread problem.  I will never again give Domino's my business.", "business_id": "wWIK4pP8eTVRiTQIUQ6O9Q", "stars": 1, "date": "2008-04-02", "type": "review"}

The atmosphere is fun but a restaurant needs to have more than a fun atmosphere. The food is less than average. Our most recent visit was for a large group of people and we were put at a booth with a round table  pushed up against it, with the end leaf of the table slanting down, making it very difficult for the two people sitting at the end to eat. (me)\n\nOur waitress was unfriendly and all business. No personality at all. The whole time i felt like we were just an pain in the ass for her.\n\nNow on to the food. We ordered a caesar salad which i could not even eat because the whole thing tasted like fish. I'm ok with a slight anchovy flavor but this was un-eatable. Apparently the dish comes with anchovies standard or on the side. I guess there is no getting around the nasty fish taste, even if you ask for no anchovies at all. The other dishes we ordered were the macaroni rosa, manicotti, and chicken marsala. The macaroni rosa was only slightly warm and lacked flavor. I've had pink sauces before and this was no where close to them. (Maggianos has a great vodka tomato cream sauce) The manicotti was probably the best of the worst but really...how can you mess up manicotti. It's a noodle with ricotta cheese in it. The chicken marsala looked so good with huge mushrooms and a rich sauce. I took one bite and was done. The sauce was so overwhelmingly sweet that i though it was a desert.\n\nThe only reason i went was to see some family out of town and the decision was out of my hands. I thought, what the hell, I give it another shot. Buca  Di Beppo. Yet another disappointment.", "business_id": "sllZXXYijYUs-n80uSa96w", "stars": 2, "date": "2008-05-12", "type": "review"}
