The broth was really spectacularly flavorful, and I had to think hard to come up with the bare few examples in my life when I have enjoyed marginally better pho broths.  The quality of the other ingredients (I had the chicken) was excellent.  All in all, it was a wonderful chicken pho.\n\nAt just under eight bucks for take out, I consider this a great value.  I look forward to going back, and will undoubtedly do so soon--I'm looking forward to trying their bun.   And the sandwich recommended by Greg R...\n\nI vacillated on four vs. five stars, and ultimately decided I could only give four based on a single take out dish.

I started working in Phoenix/Scottsdale about 15 months ago and was always craving a bowl of pho when I started to miss D.C.  Given my love of Yelp! you'd think I'd have just got on here but it just never occurred to me.\n\nI found this place purely by happenstance when  going to lunch with co-workers at Buffalo Wild Wings.

Tea Light definitely scores in my top 10. \n\nSo specific to the pho.  Tea Light is more of a vietnamese cafe/restaurant that has pho than a \"pho spot\" where the menu might be 20 variations of pho.\n\nSo here go the important parts:\n\nThe broth - spiced to perfection. I will admit my palate prefers a saltier pho.   That being said I could show up daily and have them put some broth in a thermos and I could drink it all day.  \n\nThe noodles - the rice noodles have just the right texture and the right quantity.\n\nMeat - Compared to more pho specific spots Tea Light only offers beef or chicken compared to flank steak and round eye or tripe and brisket.  Though it's limited to beef or chicken I feel the meat is consistently of good quality and portion.  The meat appears butchered properly and I never find myself trying to resolve some giant chunk of fat.  Very lean and very yummy.\n\nVeggies - A little lacking.  Typically you get twice as many bean sprouts, jalapeno peppers and cilantro.  I'm willing to assume though that if I actually asked for more they would give it to me.\n\nI'm sorry to say that given the quality of their pho I never tried anything else on their menu.

Ha! No wonder I love it so much myself that it was always on the weekly dinner rotation when I lived in OC. Alas, I moved to North Phoenix and I dont have little pho shops or boba cafes on every street corner. I've learned that I have to drive a ways to Chandler/Mesa to satisfy these cravings. Imagine my surprise when the husband and I noticed Tea Lite Cafe when we changed up our movie theater location this past weekend. Of course, we had to try it out and we'd been dying for some pho for months now.\n\nWe both ordered the beef pho and took a seat. The place is small but there's plenty of seating and still feels spacious. The cashier up front was super friendly and welcoming which was nice. We didn't have to wait too long for our food to arrive...another plus. \n\nThe pho itself has really tasty broth and the beef was nice and tender. I was disappointed by the small portion of bean sprouts, mint leaves and limes that accompanied the soup. I'm used to overflowing plates of these veggies so I can load up my soup to my heart's desire. In fact, my hubby usually counts on me doing this since I end up eating all my veggies and leaving most of the beef for him. Double ha! But the lack of sprouts and mint leaves didn't put a damper on the great taste of the pho. What I did miss was the traditional pho ingredients like tripe, rare steak and tendons. I know, I know...sounds intense but trust me it makes pho taste soooo good. I guess I just have a usual when it comes to pho so I was a little disappointed when I couldn't satisfy my craving to the utmost degree. Woe is me. \n\nBut let me conclude by stating again that the pho here is really good and has a great flavor to the broth.

It found me driving to a kind of shady part of Mesa, while braving the cold winds in search of a perfect bowl of ph\u00f2.\n\nMy new holy grail of Vietnamese restaurants is Ph\u00fa Th\u00e0nh, located in a rundown strip mall on Southern and Extension. A good Vietnamese restaurant is usually kind of old, slightly dingy and super cheap, and in this case all the basics were met and exceeded.\n\nPh\u00fa Th\u00e0nh is a no-frills kind of place. Inside it screams for a makeover. Though clearly from another era, it is clean and functional. The service is friendly and the kitchen is fast.\n\nThere might be a slight familiarity here the owners of Ph\u00fa Th\u00e0nh and my favorite central Vietnamese joint Da V\u00e0ng are brothers. The menus of the two places are almost identical, and they offer a lot.\n\nThe No. 50 Ch\u00e0 Gi\u00f2 ($2) is what good Vietnamese cooking is all about. Two golden-brown, crunchy egg rolls filled with shrimp and pork are hands on and interactive. Served with a plate of lettuce leaves and herbs, you wrap the egg roll in lettuce and garnish with mint and cilantro, then dunk them into the house-made n?\u00f2c ch\u00e2m, a sweet and spicy dipping sauce. The fresh lettuce and herbs cut through the richness of the egg roll, which on its own might be slightly oily.\n\nApplying the same hands-on approach, the No. 54 B\u00e1nh X\u00e8o ($3.95) replaces the rolls with a pan-fried rice flour crepe. The exterior is slightly crispy, while the soft interior is filled with shrimp and bean sprouts. Of all the B\u00e1nh X\u00e8o I've tried, this version is by far my favorite. It's full of flavor and texture.\n\nPh\u00f3 (pronounced like the bad word) is not only fun to say, but fun to eat. Eight versions of the noodle soup are offered, from traditional beef to chicken. Pay attention to the menu description when ordering since you might wind up with unfamiliar cuts of meat.\n\nI'm adventurous and love the textures of beef tendon and tripe, so I was in heaven when my steaming bowl of No. 1 Ph\u00f2 Ph\u00fa Th\u00e0nh ($4.95) arrived. The broth was incredibly fragrant with clove and star anise. This really should be made into an air freshener.\n\nAlong with the condiments at the table, the soup comes with a plateful of basil and bean sprouts. But also include limes and chilis to add texture, flavor and depth to your pho experience.\n\nFor something hearty and comforting, the No. 7 M\u00ec B\u00f2 Kho ($4.75) is a bowl of chewy egg noodles filled with a beef stew. Tender pieces of stewed carrots and beef grace the rich and complex flavors of the dark and tasty brew.\n\nIf you're carbohydrate loading, order a slab of French bread to absorb all of the bone-warming elixir at the bottom of the bowl.\n\nFor food like this, a little shady is worth the drive.", "business_id": "IXB3PGgSmw4bjTe9ll-tQw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-02-08", "type": "review"}

It's larger, has a huge presence outside of the typical hidden strip mall, and looks promising. \n\nRest assured, Phu Thanh is different from most Vietnamese restaurants on the east side... it's very very bad. During a one-hour dinner in their dining room, I noticed three tables that were covered in dirty dishes upon my arrival, and still covered in the same dirty dishes upon my departure. Not to say this ruined my experience, but it sure was disgusting to look at. The waiter service here was actually nicer and more helpful than most, a which is the saving grace here. They offered a refill of my water (rare) and even came back to see if I needed anything else (very rare.) The clientele here seemed like predominately young married couples and young families of non-asian descent. \n\nI had been craving a bowl of Bun all day, a rice noodle dish served with julienned veggies, your choice of meat, and a nuoc mam (fish sauce) to give it a nice flavor. I also ordered spring rolls  prior to my meal, and was a tad surprised when, having ordered in Vietnamese, the server asked me questions that made no sense. My order of Goi Cuon garnered a respose of \"fried or not fried\" which definitely threw me off since fried would be Gha Gio, an entirely different dish... did you ask this because I'm white? He then asked \"you need fork right?\" No, I just gave you my entire order and said hello in conversational Vietnamese... this wasn't a tip off that I know how to eat your food? The spring rolls were very small and contained little filling. I'm used to Goi Cuon bursting with veggies pork and shrimp, not little tiny thunb sized things. When the Bun came, the noodles were all broken, which made it almost impossible to eat in anything other than tiny bites. The Nuoc Mam had an overwhelming fish sauce smell and flavor and was easily the worst I've ever had, and completely lacked chili, garlic, or anything to mask the fish sauce. Utterly awful. I also felt like the Bun portion was incredibly small compared to other Viet restaurants in town.\n\nI would hesitate to give this place any sort of recommendation, given it's proximity to some of the best Vietnamese restaurants in town. The quality seemed to be on par, and service was somewhat decent, but the combination of small portions, bad tasting food, and lack of ability to clean a table earns this restaurant a solid two-star review. Also, eating Vietnamese more than three times a week, I've had a good run of over two years and haven't become sick from a place. This one has had me burping for the past 12 hours and feeling kind of queasy... nothing major, but definitely something didn't sit well. I'm honstly not sure what the appeal of this restaurant is.

But the egg rolls (#1) are a must have! The spring rolls (#2) are also tasty if you're looking for something a little healthier.  For entrees, I love the chicken pho (#14) when I want something simple or the rice and egg noodle soups (#18 and #19?) when I'm looking for more variety. The noodle bowls are awesome as well--#28 is nice because they'll chop up egg rolls and put them right in your bowl. Yum! As a plus, prices for any of the above top out at around $6.95.\n\nThe only thing I wouldn't recommend is getting one of Saigon's few fusion dishes--teriyaki chicken, for example. Stick to a strictly Vietnamese dish.\n\nI would score a 5/5 for sure except a friend of mine did get sick there once a few years ago. I haven't had it happen in 10 years, so it may be a fluke.

Although I still think Saigon Pho is quite good and an excellent value, unfortunately I had to downgrade my rating from last year's review.\n\nTonight I ordered 2 orders of chicken pho, 1 order of spring rolls, and a Thai iced. My total was $18.36! Now that is unbeatable price wise.\n\nUnfortunately, my Thai basil was old and brown and not a good portion. Same with the bean sprouts. And the shrimp in my spring rolls were not cleaned (you know what I mean!). EW.\n\nI know the economy is still sluggish and money is tight. But I think it would be better to up the prices slightly than serve old food. For me as a customer it is awful to expect the quality you're used to, and to open your box to find rotting sides and poopy shrimp.\n\nDisappointed tonight.

The other table also ordered the BBQ Beef.  In general all the food was pretty good probably a 5 but the portion sizes leave a lot to be desired.  I as well as some other in my party had been here before noticed that the portion sizes were noticeably smaller.  In addition the lady waiting our table messed up our spring roll order for fried egg rolls and blamed it in us with an attitude (maybe if she wasn't soo distracted), though she corrected the problem.  Our other table ordered a second order of Fish Filet with Special Sauce after they had eaten theirs and asked how long it would take for the second order.  The server said 5-7 minutes--it took almost 30 minutes!!\n\nMaybe it's just me, but most of my experiences at Chinese/Vietnamese/Asian restaurants within the past few years just seem to be bad.

Saigon Pho is a neat small Vietnamese restaurant located conspicously from its flashy bar neighbors Iguana Mack and Dos Gringos.\n\nI was feeling beefy and brave that day so i got the #10 (thank you Yelp reviewers, nice choice), brave btw is for the portion of an uncooked beef on my hot soup, which i didn't eat but added a distinct flavor. #14 Chicken broth is spot-on good broth (which i got on another day). Shrimp and vegetable rolls or egg rolls are crunchily delicious if you are up for an appetizer.\n\nNow it is true that a full bodied beef broth is flavorful and it is what makes a Pho stands out, but i have to say for the purpose of eating healthy, the more flavor there is the more fat and calories, not to mention the sodium if it has one, there are in the beef broth. This one, though, falls a tad short on the flavor, so i just season it, a good thing because it gives me a choice without compromising the freshness of the bean sprouts and mint. \n\nMy friend and i stayed here for about thirty minutes on a Sunday afternoon and although they don't have a maximum customers, i notice the waiters are hovering around our table a lot as if they wanted us to leave, which i think is the only negative experience i have with this place.\n\nThree stars and i would most likely come back.", "business_id": "jJlOPkv4Xl6vxNzr51fnYw", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-02-28", "type": "review"}

It's very cool inside - there's a big painting across one of the walls and there's an old, retro-style light post in the middle of the room (think The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe).  The interior of Cyclo isn't very big by Phoenix standards (I suppose it's enormous by NYC standards), but it's certainly large enough that things aren't cramped at all.  There's good, mellow music playing at a not-too-quiet-or-too-loud volume.\n\nThe menu has a decent number of choices, but isn't overwhelming.  All the prices are very reasonable - an entree will be around $8-10.  We started with Spring Rolls and they were good - the shrimp inside had a really good flavor to it.\n\nThen we moved onto our entrees.  I got Saigon Rice Vermicelli, which was a big bowl full of vermicelli and various meats.  All the meat had *fantastic* flavor.  I spiced the dish up with some of the chili sauce that was on our table and really enjoyed it.  The dish was a good size, although I can eat a house so it didn't quite fill me up.  She got Pho with beef (sorry, I can't remember exactly what it was called).  It was MONSTROUS.  Seriously, I've never seen a bowl of pho this big.  Anyway, the flavor of the pho was excellent - the broth, the meat...everything was just awesome.\n\nThen we got our bill for dinner with one appetizer and two entrees - it only came out to $25 and change (plus tip, of course).

It's all about the broth for a good bowl of pho, and it tasted like they just used beef broth from a can.  Additionally, the brisket smelled like it was spoiled.

The pork chop and the crispy noodle cake were thumbs down, with the verdict rendered on the noodles because it was impossible to tell apart the different types of protein that were supposed to be served with it.  Two had the mint chicken which was given an OK, although the broken rice was a bit plain for both eaters' tastes.  I had the Hanoi vermicelli and it was to die for.  Incredible broth, perfectly grilled meat, great herb accompaniment.  So folks, it all boils down (pardon the pun) to what you order.  By the way, heard no f-bombs from the owner who was her delightfully sassy self as well as being an efficient server and a really snazzy dresser.  Friday night and the place was at capacity.

Lastly, the quality of, what I call the extras, i.e. Thai basil, white onions, bean sprouts, jalapenos, &etc. \n\nThe second dish I usually judge a Pho joint is by the quality of the spring rolls. Now, I've been to many places where the spring roll just plain sucked! It's hard to find a place that has all the elements of a good spring roll. i.e. the shrimp, not too over cooked. The pork, is it flavorful? Is the vegetables mushy? and the overall quality of the flavor, not too much vinegar, a slight touch of mirin, and of course the quality of the peanut sauce. Makes me hungry as I write this! This place hit all the mark! \n\nNow, let me say this, when a place is called Pho Kim Long...Pho soup is the way to go! Enjoy what they are known for! With that being said, the bowls of delectable Pho has to be one of the better ones in Vegas. It's not to say that the Banh Mi sandwiches are not bad, to be exact, it's actually pretty good! \n\nService is very prompted, friendly, and professional!

There are lots of buddha figurines in different sizes.  The fresh water fish tank is nice with expensive variety of fishes. The plants need to be taken care of because they are covered with dust.  The restroom needs to be clean because toilet paper are all over the floor.  By the way they haven't upkept since the remodeling.  The place needs better ventilation because I can smell lot of pho flavors when first entered.  \n     The beef noodle soup here is reasonable.  First, the soup come out really fast.  The broth has a distinct cinnamon flavor, which is typical.  I prefer a balance flavor broth.  The price for the beef noodle soup is fair.  The seafood soup here is overpriced because the content in the soup are 3 pieces of shrimp, 2 fishballs, 3 slices of cuttlefish, and egg noodle in a blanched broth.  The BBQ duck is tasty which has a balance flavor of crispy skin, duck with fair amount of meat,  and good price.\n     The service is unpredictable.  They have all male servers with a serious look on their faces most of the time.  You have to ask for service. One upswing is  they give you the right utensil for your needs.

I like Pho So 1 too and find I prefer their broth but last few times I smelled so strongly of smoke BBQ that it was unpleasant to be that tired and can't crash into bed because I can wake myself up with the smell.\n\nI'm forgiving about Asian service. They are fast about serving in most places and then run off in their own world and you gotta wave em down for things like the check. I'm just happy to get food fast and not be held hostage waiting for a check this late and they do refill my drinks regularly enough so not gonna dock them down for the few times I needed to wave down to ask for something.", "business_id": "FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-02-19", "type": "review"}

A great place to go after a night out.  The inside of the restaurant is pretty spacious and better looking than the outside... which isn't impressive and the parking is frustrating because of the extremely narrow parking lot (more like a parking strip).  I usually order #13 steak & brisket noodle soup.  Their meals are decent.  Not great, but still pretty good.", "business_id": "FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-02-19", "type": "review"}

The menu is very extensive in terms of various Vietnamese dishes - it's not just pho. My friends and I had breakfast here,and ordered the pho dac bi\u00e8t and b\u00fan t\u00ect n\u00fa\u00f3ng. One friend wanted the pho ga as well as the pho dac bi\u00e8t, so she ended up asking if she could have the pho dac bi\u00e8t with the t\u00ect ga in it and they were more than obliged to do so! My other friend ordered the bun t\u00ect n\u00fa\u00f3ng but they gave her chicken instead of the beef. My friend not being so picky ended up eating the dish, which turned out to be pretty good.  The table adjacent to us ended up getting her dish instead. The waiters knew they made a mistake as did we and surprisingly acknowledged their mistake, which is always great and rare for any pho restaurant to do. Good thing we're not picky eaters, plus we were on a time crunch so we were more interested in eating and going.  Our food came with a good amount of meat so it turned out to be very filling.  I do believe the dishes are priced a little high but since I did not see too many other pho restaurants I guess competition is scarce.  All in all a good place for Vietnamese food, almost like home cooking.  I enjoy eating off the Vegas strip.", "business_id": "FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-02-22", "type": "review"}

It was surprisingly very nice and clean for a Vietnamese restaurant, but maybe I'm too used to 'the dirtier, the better' mentality of Viet restaurants in Little Saigon. \n\nThey had a huge selection to satisfy all of your Vietnamese and Chinese cravings, not just pho. However, I just got my usual Pho Ga (I loove dipping chicken in the ginger sauce). Definitely DE-LISH!\n\nIt definitely had the whole Vietnamese-people-running-around-busy atmosphere. They were too busy running around that they forgot to bring one of our friend's bowls... and she was the only one sitting there without any food when everyone else had ordered the exact same thing. Goodness.\n\nBut I'm glad to know that I can always satisfy my late-night-after-clubbing pho craves.
