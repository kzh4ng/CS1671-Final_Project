I remember coming by with my family and having no serious problems getting a quick bite at all. These days, though, the staff definitely don't have their act together, and I guess management doesn't want to tell them so. I can't remember the last time I got out of their drive-thru lane in under 15 minutes. At first I thought maybe it was a fluke. Now it's become a long-term occurrence. The last time I came, they had the audacity to say \"We'll be with you in just a moment\" - twice! - and they left me hanging. Each. Time. I ended up staying just to see if they even remembered I was there. They did, after I sat so long that it would have been too long a wait at a sit-down restaurant, let alone in a fast food drive-thru line.\n\nThe only reason I keep coming here is because their food at least meets Wendy's standards and gives me something to keep me going between my appointments throughout the day.

I think it may be less confusing to some if the menu boards were simplified to reflect this.\r\n\r\nAs to the food, it's pretty decent.

Their chicken choices definitely top my list over their steak (sometimes tough), beef (sometimes greasy), and pork (usually dry).  The chicken, in the words of Goldilocks, is \"just right.\"  Every time.  The regular chicken burrito (with extra hot salsa, please!) is always a winner.  However, when I'm in the mood for something with a little more pizzazz, I go with the pesto chicken burrito or formerly, the retired mole chicken burrito.   And when I'm in the mood for something naughty, I go with the queso chicken burrito.  The Naked Burritos (without the tortilla, for you low-carbers) are good...but I leave still feeling hungry.  \n\nSince we go to Qdoba regularly, we've signed up for the Qdoba Card, earn points each time we visit, and have gotten a handful of free burritos over the past few years.

Then I see our waiter come out of the back eating food as he is getting our drinks, meanwhile no manager in site. Finally after about 20 mins the manager Lewis comes out of the back for just a bit to talk to a couple waitresses and drinking margaritas the night before.

My best bud Polo is a big dude, and accordingly a rather big penny pincher.

As we waited for our orders a group of elderly folks strolled by, donna summer was playing on the radio, impulsively i blasted her sweet disco melodies as loud as my car speakers would allow, and we had an improtu dance party in my car as they stared in horror and confusion. the gal who worked at yoshi's opened the drive thru window, laughed and handed us our orders. We took my groceries and our Yoshi's bowls back to my pad, had a quick refresher, and dug into our Yoshi's bowls as we watched always sunny and spent the rest of the afternoon with full belly's of joy.

I have been to this DQ several times with minimal complaint. It is small and seating is limited but that never really bothered me. Today I brought my daughter and we purchased ice cream and food and the cashier told me the bill total was $8.00 even. I gave him my credit card and he ran it. At first I didn't think he was going to give me a receipt. I guess they just have a slow credit card machine.  He finally handed me the credit card receipt, not the actual receipt the cash register produces and I noticed that the card had been swiped for $10.00. At first I thought maybe there was a fee for using a credit/debit card and next I thought, wow, that's ridiculous. When he delivered the food, I asked him why the bill was $8 and the receipt showed my card had been charged $10 and he said, \"oh\" and walked back the register and instantly popped the drawer open, took out $2 and ripped the receipt off and walked over to me. He showed me the total and said, \"you were right\" and handed me the $2. Umm....ok. So basically, my advice is to watch your receipts very closely, ask for both copies, the credit card and the register one, and maybe even pay with cash cuz last time I checked the 8 and the 10 weren't \"next to each other\" on a keyboard and I am not sure there's a plausible excuse for this accidentally happening. I am thinking that that employee thinks he's running some kind of scam where he skims a couple bucks off every credit card transaction and pockets the extra money at the end of the day and that's some bullsh*t. I will be contacting the store directly tomorrow to voice my concerns with their manager although maybe he or she's in on it too.

I went inside instead of the drive thru because I like to replace my biscuit with a small bun so I can make my own chicken sandwich with mash and gravy on it. (I know, kinda weird). Every KFC I go to has such a problem with this, its unbelievable. This store in particular just really pissed me off because when i asked Gloria if she could do that, she gave me a dumbfounded look and in a rude way said \"ummm, hold on\" and then had to ask 2 other people. Then those other 2 people looked over at me and then laughed to Gloria and said \"i guess\". Gloria was the cashier that day and was a sour puss the moment we walked in, so her attitude had nothing to do with my so-called complicated order. She didnt greet me and my boyfriend when we walked in, she just stood at the register staring at us until we ordered. My boyfriend had the doublicious sandwich, which he barely ate because it was so disgusting. The bun was ice cold but had grill marks in it, so most likely it was just sitting there for a while. The cheese wasnt melted at all, and the only thing that was warm was the chicken and that was just as big as a silver dollar!! I ordered the 2 piece boneless chicken breast meal. Of course, instead of subsituting my biscuit with the snacker bun, I got charged 1.50 for the bun. Gloria didnt ask me if I wanted dark and white meat, so when I realized that one piece was dark, I asked if it was possible that I can have 2 white meat pieces. She had an attitude about that too and rolled her eyes as she walked away with my meal to replace the dark meat piece. It took her forever to come back with my meal and im 100% positive she gave me the smallest pieces of chicken in the batch. My chicken was so dry, i almost choked on it. The only thing that was good was the mashed potatoes and gravy. No one said thank you or have a good day as we left either. We paid $16 for one of the worst meals ever. I will never go back to this KFC again. Im not even sure if I will go to any KFC anymore. Their prices are way too high for the quality of food and the customer service sucks! There are so many people that would be grateful to have a job, not Gloria!", "business_id": "y9hLY6sdKhxz1puWrp5f2Q", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-10-04", "type": "review"}

But recently they've changed their menu so I ended up with Pei Wei Spicy Beef combo which, per usual, had chewy meat, not enough sauce and too much rice. I also ordered the Thai lettuce wraps and let me just say STAY AWAY FROM THESE! It was such a confusion of flavors.. it was tangy and there was the hint of cilantro and mint... MINT! Gross! My boss took one bite and almost puked, he's a bit picky so I tried it and almost puked as well. We also ordered the Steak Lettuce wrap which was gross too.

It was your typical Wendy's experience. No bells and whistles, except for the drink machine...which, by the way, appears to have several HUNDRED possible drink combinations. The decor looked like it has since I was a kid (p.s. a long time ago)...dated, to say the least.\n\nEven driving up to the Yelp Event, I barely recognize the building. From the outside, you can see that there have been MAJOR renovations done. There are sleek, dark, tinted windows all along the roof line, coupled with ceiling to floor tinted windows surrounding the new seating area.\n\nAfter checking out the Yelp table (and picking up a couple of \"Here's The Beef\" t-shirts), my family and I went in.\n\nUpon passing through the second glass door, we were IMMEDIATELY lost. EVERYTHING had changed! \n\nThe first thing that caught our attention was the all new seating area immediately to the left. There are two sets of two chairs facing one another, making for a rather intimate setting. Hung on the wall is a beautiful HDTV. But, the piece de resistance for the seating area was the faux fireplace. It was absolutely beautiful!\n\nThe overall decor has been completely modernized. The old, tired booths and seats have been replaced with updated seating. On top of the dividing walls, there are beautiful glass accents. Where there used to be boring run-of-the-mill booths on the left of the dining area, there is now a gorgeous \"Arizona Room-esque\" glass palace. Within this seating area, there is another, albeit smaller, HDTV hung in the corner.\n\nNow, on to the service. I know there was a Yelp event going on, and you always put on a good show for company, but the management at this location really seem to have embraced the change that Wendy's is trying to make. Three different managers were walking throughout the dining area, greeting all of the customers, and handing out coupons for free things (burgers, fries, frosties, etc.). In fact, one of the managers offered to carry our food, and escorted us through the dining area to our seats. I know it's hard to get excited about the service at a fast food restaurant, but at least there's a ray of hope after today.\n\nBased on what I saw, it looks like Wendy's is well on their way to righting the ship as far as their restaurants are concerned. I'm sure they spent a pretty penny on these upgrades. If they can keep up the great service, and ride the wave of the buzz created by these renovations, I'm sure they're going to see a FANTASTIC return on their investment!\n\nThank you to Lindsey and her team for making my first Yelp event an awesome one!", "business_id": "En2GuQV7FoOGHhXX5SMEBg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-09-13", "type": "review"}

The fries are crispy but not in an unnatural way. \n\nMake sure you are aware of the not-so-secret menu. I usually get a burger protein-style, animal-style, with mustard instead of spread.

Before starting, let me just say my expectations are not set high as if it's any other fast food place (del taco, McDonald's,  ect.). I expect the workers to typically be a high school student with a bad attitude. That being said they've somehow managed to lower the bar. They're reliable for bad service, screwing up your order & being easily overwhelemed. Recently they have gave away an order to the wrong person of the lady in front of me. They made her get back in line and start over and she still had to pay seeing the person in front of her got away with a free meal! They have screwed up countlessly, for example my brother got a subway MELT & because he requested the bread to not be toasted the sandwich was cold, meaning NO melted cheese & the bacon was RAW. I mean unthinkable situations they make possible. & if you dare order toppings they scarcely clump each selection on one area of the sandwich. Common knowledge of making a sandwich is easily overlooked. Avoid this location at all costs. No matter how many workers or managers this place goes thru they will never get it together. As noted, I'm not requiring a gourmet meal and over the top exceptional service. I don't imagine working at subway is the highlight of anyone's career or reason to get up in the morning but it is your paycheck so a little effort won't hurt.

What really sucks though is no matter how much you spend on a meal, when they come by with your meal and the condiments don't ask for ranch or bbq sauce because it's extra. This petty nickel and diming is a real big turnoff and that definitely deters me from eating here. \n\nThis location is easy to access and has a drive-through, which I think most of them do but I figure not everyone reading these reviews have been to whataburger so here you go.....\n\nBurgers are good and whataburger likes to emphasize on the fact that there are thousand and one possibilities for making a custom burger. Whatever your bag is, they can make it. The fries are pretty decent, sometimes they're a bit more saltier than I like but they are good. The pies are yummy! And of course last but not least, my favorite is the honey barbecue chicken strip sandwich on Texas toast. Delish!!!! I don't stop at this establishment a lot, primarily because they don't have a lot of locations but when I do that chicken strip sandwich is my jam! \n\nJust a side note, is it just me or has anyone noticed that whataburger seems to hire people on the low end of the spectrum to work here. I get the whole minimum-wage thing but sometimes I really question the mental stability of the person taking my order. Not trying to be mean or unheartful (I made that word up) but sometimes I feel like someone's a sandwich short of a picnic if you know what I mean. Hats off to them though, because even though I feel their employees are somewhat questionable, mainly appearance- they have never messed up an order.

I've been working at this mall almost a year, stopping by here for a drink or sandwich or snack quite often. They are always so nice and the food is fresh. If I have to wait a few minutes it's okay, I know they are preparing  it right then. Today I went in for a meal. While waiting for my delicious #1  I met the nicest lady. Her name was Jeannette(sp?) and I'm pretty sure she was in management or marketing. She came out of the back of Chick- Fil- A with the owner I think. As soon as she saw a customer she ran right up to him to take care of his needs. I just wanted to say I thought that was cool. There were plenty of staff around to take care of him, it was just automatic to her and I think that speaks volumes about her character. We had a nice chat and she told me about some upcoming promotions she was doing. A couple of things were for kids.

She is fairly new that I can tell of the past couple weeks.  She never smiles and is always curt.  Today, upon buying 3 large drinks (and I wasn't happy that the prices went up on this, too to $1), I handed her my debit card and my daughter's school ID.  She said she cannot accept the school ID and that I will not be getting a 10% on the drinks.  She said they are already discounted.  I said they raised the prices like about a week ago.\n\nShe told me the drinks are normally $2.50.  I don't think they've been that price in ever, not even in Vegas are they this much.  She said we were already getting a discount and they don't do discounts on their $1 menu.  I said, well, the sign right there said, they always give 10% to students (with IDs), veterans, military, senior citizens.  Then, she went on to say, it's only for the veterans and military that they will give 10% off.\n\nAnyway, she refused and it's not even that I need or even care about the stupid 30 cents, but the principle.  I told her yesterday I got the 10% off, but she didn't address that.  How they she say they only give 10% off to military when the sign there clearly says to whom.  And, the sign does not have an asterisk stating that the 10% is for certain items only.\n\nWe frequently other Carl Jr's around the valley and have always gotten the 10% off our drinks or whatever we are buying.  Anyway, I'm really ticked and called another Carl's that is closer to our house that we go to.  They said they always give the 10% if you show your ID for those groups no matter what you buy.\n\nI will be calling this Carl's Jr and complaining about her and see if this is true, that they will not honor the 10%.  If they don't, then they will completely lose all our business.  Guadalupe also said all the other fast food restaurants charge $2.50 also. Well, that's absolutely not true - I checked the large drinks with Burger King, Chipotle's, Dairy Queen, Subway, McDonald's, Jack in the Box, KFC, Wendy's, Whataburger, Arby's, Sonic, Rally's, In & Out, Panda Express and NONE of these places charge $2.50 for their large drink.  I think one of the places even offered a 1.5 liter for maybe $2.29 or something like that.\n\nAnyway, I will be voicing my complaint to this Carl's for her rudeness, for stating things that she just made up, for being very non customer service oriented.

I am not a huge fan to be honest. However, I am going to be optimistic and at least mention what the best thing on their menu is. \nFor the longest time, I honestly hated Chipotle and couldn't put my finger on what it was that I disliked. Then I finally hit the nail on the head. Its the meat! I have tried all of their meats and all have sucked honestly. The steak and chicken are tough, don't have much flavor, and tend to have pieces with grissle. Barbeqoa is wayyy too fricken salty. Carnita's are probably the lesser of the evils but is wayyyyy to peppery. If it weren't for the hubby being a huge fan of the carnita's and guac here, I would have never gone back. But since he loves Chipotle so much and requests it once a month, I had to find something to order that is decent. \nAfter trying tacos, salads, quesadillas, my go to meal turned out to be the vegi burro. Please don't give this review that look. Its actually good and it comes with the guacamole! Yes, I love meat and rarely order something vegetarian. However, Chipotle is the one place I prefer something vegetarian over something with meat because like I said, the meat is soooo horrible. Now when I am forced to go to Chipotle, I get a burrito with rice (I order extra), black beans, corn salsa, hot salsa, pico de gallo, extra sour cream, and guac on the side. These are the best items Chipotle has. I have to admit, their rice is actually tasty, their tortillas are soft and huge, the corn salsa is downright delicious (but who doesnt like corn), and their pico is always fresh with a pretty good flavor. Betcha noticed that I make no mention of cheese huh? Don't get me wrong, I love cheese but Chipotles cheese seems too strong for my taste. Anyways, let me sum up the food by saying that although you get alot, nothing accept the veggie burro is acceptable in my book. Even this vegi burrito is simply ok and tolerable, once in a decade craveable. \nNow as for the service, some of the locations seem to hire people that lack intelligence and this location is no exception to that. Many times, there seems to be too many people behind the counter running around like chickens with their heads cut off. Also, the burritos tend to have holes in them because the roller doesn't know how to roll. \nI will say that I am absolutely puzzled as to why Chipotle has such a huge following. To me, its far from being sensational. Luckily, I have found something decent to order but this is not a place that I get really excited about. About the only time I got stoked to see a Chipotle was in NY after eating multiple overpriced downright depressing meals. Maybe I was just looking for something familiar after being away from home for a week. However, when other Chipotle cravings emerge, I satisfy them and then head to the drug store to get a certain test because obviously somethin aint right!", "business_id": "Cv4kZH9zN0wpN2Drn0qkLg", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-10-08", "type": "review"}

I looked across the parking lot and saw My Big Fat Greek Restaurant- a place carrying a scathing review from yours truly. It hit me. We were sitting outside and there was a major lack of cockroach. I know they are not supposed to inhabit restaurants, even the outside areas, but after my experience at MBFGR, I figured the area had a veritable infestation, Brooklyn-style. Not so. We didn't see one.\nWe did, however, see a cute little kitten running through the bushes. Not begging for food. Just being cute. Awwwww.\n\nI ordered the ravioli di magro with pomodoro sauce- not a fan of gorgonzola, but it was an option. Tasty. It was perfectly al dente. Hubski had the fettuccine alfredo. That was lighter than most I have tried and it was tasty. One time, in NYC, I tried a fettuccine alfredo which was made at the table with steaming pasta in a gigantic wheel of cheese. It wasn't as good as that, but almost.\n\nWe'll go back- especially for the bellinis.

For example, I've eaten at countless barely passable \"Chinese\" joints in mall food courts that, other than their liberal use of soy sauce (mostly manufactured in Southern California) are technically about as Chinese Hong Kong Phooey.  But it's just Asian ENOUGH to satisfy most people.   Now when I say \"most people\" I don't mean those Japanophiles or Sinophiles or anybody with enough yellow fever that they get all huffy when you include Kurosawa in with Woo or any other of the Hong Kong oeuvre.  Oh, and Asians too. I assume \"vaguely Asian\" probably isn't enough to satisfy most Asians of which I am one though only vaguely.\n\nHowever, Asians themselves can be faulted for this feeding into the Vaguely Asian experience.  I used to frequent, only because of its proximity to my office, a terrible Chinese place that served sushi but was run by a Vietnamese guy.   Add in a few Korean waiters and me, the Filipino customer, and it was the Pacific Rim of Crapitude.  It was as if thousands of years of pan Asian culture had been boiled down into a single crucible of misery and suck represented by rubbery lo mein and rice not fit to be given out by UNICEF. And yet curiously, I found comfort in all this. It was all so pleasantly vaguely Asian.\n\nThen again, my mother sometimes complains that I'm too American for her taste.\n\nAnyway, I knew all this when I went to Pei Wei. I didn't expect much in the way of authenticity. Actually I didn't expect ANY authenticity. I expected a lot of rice, soy sauce and ginger in odd places. I expected Vaguely Asian and, well, that's what I got. OK, it's not quite to the whitewashed level of say, a Panda Express, but I sure as hell ain't gonna find any chicken feet boiling away here.\n\nThe space was nice. Nods to authenticity if not attempts to actually meet it. (Unused) woks hanging decoratively from hooks, dark woods and the obligatory chopsticks which, really, are impossible to eat with unless the rice is sticky.  The set-up is fast casual which indeed is fast, but always puts into question whether to tip or not.  Dishes range from \"Thai\" to \"Korean\" to \"Chinese\" and, well, they're really not any of the three, but it's good enough for government work.  I kept thinking to myself, \"Man, this is like visiting a poor man's P.F. Chang's,\" when lo and behold, I discovered it WAS a poor man's P.F. Chang's as in, they're sister chains. Ah so, Grasshopper.\n\n In all, it wasn't HORRIBLE per se. The food was edible if not impressive. Since none of the dishes were over $10, the prices weren't that bad. The many, many, (sigh) many kids around me seem to be digging it.  The service was perky (though the cashier made me feel older than McCain's grandpa.) Finally they had Sapporro in large bottles which helped me to handle the many, many, (sigh), many kids around me.  So if your knowledge of China is less Sun Tzu and more General Tso, then you'll do fine here. I'll give it 2.5 stars and round up because, hey, I'm visiting.", "business_id": "WixkMVXXFCx-lYsr6JoF6Q", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-11-11", "type": "review"}
