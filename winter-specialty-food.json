Homewood? Garfield? Wrong. it's the Whole Foods parking lot. Since I drive a Mini Cooper, it's considerably easier for me to zip around and dodge the Lexus SUVs that fly at you from every angle in this jungle of a parking lot, but I'm not sure how you people with normal-sized cars do it. Compounding the problem are the abandoned shopping carts rolling about and sometimes filling the already-limited parking spaces, thanks to the shortage of shopping cart corrals. Cold and tired, I found myself seriously considering abandoning my cart when I noticed that the nearest corral was on the other side of the lot. Don't worry, I didn't succumb to the temptation, but judging by the state of the parking lot, I think I'm in the minority.\n\nIf you actually make it into the store without any physical injury (you will be psychologically scarred, trust), there's definitely some good stuff to be had. As others have noted, the store is really small, causing the selection to be less than extensive. It's also too crowded. I like to spend a lot time in the grocery store checking out what's new and reading labels and such, but I feel awkward doing that when there's a swarm of soccer moms lurking over my shoulder and zigging and zagging all over the goddamn place. ANYWAY...some notes on various departments:\n\n1. The produce here immediately stands out--it looks so much more appetizing and fresh than at Giant Eagle. Even the bagged salad greens are more vibrant. Unfortunately, it's a tradeoff for the smaller selection of produce, but they have all the basics covered.\n\n2. This past trip was the first time I bought meat from Whole Foods, and the cuts were noticably neater and more consistent than at GE. Not sure if this is a regular thing, but they didn't have any filet mignon (I know, I'm high maintenance. I'M WORTH IT!).\n\n3. The cheese department! I like how GE Market District organizes their cheese a little better, but Whole Foods has a much more interesting and varied selection.\n\n5. The food bar is hit or miss. Some days it's the best thing ever, other days not so much. The sushi is gross. I always seem to forget this and try it over and over again with the same fishy, mealy results. Don't be stupid like me, avoid it.\n\n6. Market District recently got rid of a lot of their natural & organic chip selection in favor of more varities of their store brand. Thankfully, Whole Foods has everything GE used to have and more, which totally makes the extra shopping trip worth it. If you're a fat kid like me, that is...\n\nI don't come here for everything, but there are definitely some advantages here. Plus, the prices here are not THAT much worse than Market District in most cases. And I have no idea how I just wrote so much about Whole Foods?", "business_id": "wfCLz9-aeShbPB7CaTY-qQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-12-09", "type": "review"}

I think it gets a bad rap, which I think is largely unfair.  I love food, and I know that sometimes things are legitimately \"overpriced,\" but just because something is expensive doesn't mean it isn't worth the cost.  So I don't believe in rating Whole Foods low just because their organic produce, ethically raised meat, and super hard-to-find ethnic ingredients cost money.  Nice things cost money.\n\nThis is not one of the glorious meccas - the Whole Foods in Lincoln Park in Chicago is definitely one of those - but this one is all right.  Pretty decent produce selection, and they always have some fun, mysterious finds.  I like their seasonal treats like meyer lemons, and their well-priced organic local produce throughout the summer.  Small fish and meat counter, but the quality is excellent.  My coworkers love the soups, and we all really enjoy the salad bar.  I love that I can find really unusual things here - their Asian section is small, but they always seem to have what I need.  And the prices on the Whole Foods store brand are really not that bad!  Seriously, like a can of beans will only set you back 99 cents, not that different from your Giant Eagle.  You can find affordable products here if you take the time.\n\nI wish their bulk section was bigger, and I wish they had bulk spices because those make my life amazing.  Whole Foods is like, where I want to do all my shopping when I grow up.  I hate shopping at Giant Eagle, because there's no love and respect for the product.  It's just crap, and OVERPRICED crap spilling out of the aisles, begging for your attention.  Whole Foods has a lot of specialty products, made and sold by people who love to eat, and love to cook.  There's respect for the ingredients here.  To me, that's the best sign of a good grocery store.\n\nIf you don't have a lot of cash, like me, then it's good to only shop here when you need to (like for a weird cut of meat, some kind of unusual hot pepper or mushroom, flavored oil, rare cheese).  Every time you come, buy something new, just for fun.  There are so many surprises here!  I just wish it was bigger.\n\nAnd yes, the parking lot is small and crowded, but like - so what?

Cuz let's face it, how could I seriously compare this location to the original, gigantic, amazing, fresh, wonderful, healthy, gorgeous Whole Foods in Austin? Instead, I'll limit myself on reviewing the ever so friendly staff and parking lot. \n\nFirst, the employees. I've been to several Whole Foods around the country and I always got the impression that Whole Foods prides itself on customer service. Maybe this place is the exception? I was shopping here yesterday and a lady kindly asked an employee if she could squeeze in behind his veggie cart to grab something. The employee actually had the audacity to say, \"When I'm done\". And he did just that. He finished stocking his fruits and veggies and when he moved his cart and the lady thanked him, he didn't say a word. Also, the lady bagging my groceries didn't say one word to me. Not when I said hello. Not when I said thank you. Not even an \"ok\" when I said have a nice day. She didn't even smile at me! Where is the love? Actually, where are your manners?  I don't need you to love me, but don't be rude or ignore me. \n\nSecond, the parking lot. I'm pretty sure this is the only Whole Foods in all of Pittsburgh. However, the parking lot seems to be built for Pittsburgh, population: 50. It's a small lot - good luck finding a spot without creepily following someone to their car and fighting an SUV for the spot. Luckily, I've never truly had a problem parking because I go at off times and park farther away. But I'm suspecting one of these days I'll come out and find my car dented or scratched. Maybe by a car, maybe by a shopping cart......maybe by the lady who was bagging my groceries yesterday....\n\nSo two stars docked for the above mentioned.

The parking is atrocious, with only probably only 75 spots for a pretty popular store.  And have fun just getting into the parking lot from Centre.  Okay, I'm going to a negative place right now....\n\nI stop in here one a whim when I'm out in the area if I'm really craving sushi, because it's way better than the Giant Eagle's sushi down the street.  It's still not he best fast sushi (Giant Eagle Waterfront), but it does the job.  Again, they're almost $3 more than at GE.

I will tell you why.\n\nMany Yelpers have docked stars for the parking lot. I think that's irrelevant. The parking lot, which is actually shared by Starbucks, Wine & Spirits, Walgreens, PNC, and more is two levels and is enormous! Walk a little. You can even take your cart up the elevator.\n\nThe Pittsburgh location is not a superstore. Other Whole Foods have a restaurant, brick oven pizzas, smoothie bar, coffee bar, many more food bars, wine, beer, and so forth. This is a teeny weeny Whole Foods. For its size, the selection is pretty impressive. For example, my mom saw something on Dr. Oz called Lingonberry Jam and asked if I would look for it, and there it was. Never heard of it before, but they had it. \n\nWhole Foods has that \"whole paycheck\" reputation. Granted, this is true if you're spending your whole paycheck on rare, gourmet, specialty foods! If that's the case, you might want to rein in your spending a little. \n\nI actually took a notebook to Trader Joe's, Giant Eagle, and Whole Foods when I first moved to Pittsburgh to compare prices. Giant Eagle (Greenfield location) was the most expensive by an overwhelming margin! Trader Joe's was the best value overall, but Whole Foods was very close, and sometimes a little better quality might be worth it. Their 365 brand is especially reasonable for your regular grocery staples.\n\nAs for the occasional splurge, this is a good place to try something different.

The parking lot is a mess of aggressive drivers acting like the extra 50 feet of walking will negatively affect the environment more than their driving around the parking lot until a better space opens up. Once you get a space and finally get inside, the experience mirrors that of the parking lot. Everyone is in each others' way and trying to be the first one to find the best organic orange or grab the last package vegan general tso's in the store.\n\nTo be fair, though, the experience is still 100 times better than going to the Market District a few blocks down the same street. Similar in-store and in-lot experience, but with a better and higher-quality selection. The staff is always really nice and super helpful, and their trays of fruit and veggies are excellent. We've ordered them countless times for parties and have never been let down. Pricey, but excellent quality. The prepared foods are delicious, and their prepackaged prepared foods are also really good...but like nearly everything else in Whole Foods, a little pricey. For example, their yummy tomato bisque is $7. Hardly cheap enough for a quick lunch, but it is yummy. Their baked goods are delicious as well. We're constantly picking up bread from there (and the occasional doughnut), and we're never disappointed.\n\nTheir meats and seafoods departments are also excellent. They have a great variety and are always helpful in answering any questions that I've had (although we still opt for our meats from DJ's). Of course, if you're at Whole Foods your'e likely there for the organic options, and as to be expected, you're not going to find a better selection anywhere else. More unique, perhaps, but their inventory just won't be matched any time soon for those foods.

It's a great option for those nights when you just don't feel like cooking. There are $6, $8, and $10 meal options, and all come with two sides. There is also a large selection of dips, spreads, and large take-away sides as well. I think their prepared foods are worth every penny, and if you don't load up your salad with heavy items, you can easily get a dinner-sized salad with a little meat or egg for $8 or $9.\n\nSome of my favorite items at this location include the fresh fruit packaged in containers. It's super expensive, but always fresh and delicious, and I love treating myself to it, especially during the summer. I also love the fish selection-it's pretty extensive, and you can always find fresh harder to find items such as red snapper.\n\nThe raw nut offerings are extensive as well, as is the chocolate...\n\nMy favorite thing to buy at this WF is coffee.

I could go on and on.  \n\nBut BACK to Mon Aimee Chocolat and the great ole' US of A.  Sitting in a display at the store was a Cadbury bar.  It was almost radiating light at this point!  I confirmed with the person working there that it was, in fact, a Cadbury bar straight off the boat, airplane, cruise ship, etc. from the UK!  I was so excited I just had to buy it!  Even though I'm an only child I can be ok with sharing sometimes.  Especially if it's an amazing food!  Since this chocolate was so good I just had to share with my coworkers.  They all thought it was just as life changing as I had described it.  \n\nOf course, since I had discovered this, one of my coworkers had been over to Holland and tried a type of candy that became one of her favorites.  Of course we had to go back to Mon Aimee to see if they carried it and sure enough, it was there!  It's such a treat to have this specialty store here in the burgh!

We stacked loaves of bread in the car as well. Seeing all the salted fish (for the upcoming feast of 7 fishes) was beautiful. The most memorable part of the visit, however, was in a small, rather grimy room that boasted huge canisters of home-made wine and small glasses. Initially under the impression that I was intruding upon the staff holiday party, a smiling worker told me that customers were welcome to sample the wine. I was a little wary of trying the un-labeled wine, but it was wonderful and warming. While not available for sale, the wine tasting was a delightful way to warm up from the particularly vicious cold and mingle with other customers.

If you've never been to the Strip before, Penn Mac is one of those places that's a must-see.  (Other merchants I'd place in this category are Wholey's, Enrico Biscotti, and Mon Aimee Chocolat, all of which we also visited.)  They have the widest array of Italian foods in PGH, as well as several other staples that you can use to round out your shopping (milk, fruit/veggies, etc.), and the prices aren't bad at all!\n\nOn my trip, I ended up picking up some goat cheese, as well as some miniature star pasta for homemade soup, some regular Barilla pasta, some milk, and some oranges.  (I'd already picked up most of my produce from Stan's and Market Outlet, but all of their oranges looked sketchy.)  Although I didn't pick up any cheese other than the goat cheese, since I'm on a healthy eating kick at present, I was impressed by the array of cheeses, as well as the olive bar (even though I don't really care for olives).  As others have mentioned, they have about a gazillion types of pastas (dried and fresh) and sauces, as well as a nice array of bread featuring Breadworks loaves.  Although the desserts look tempting on the way out, I'd recommend giving them a pass and visiting Enrico Biscotti or Colangelo's nearby to satiate your sweet tooth instead.\n\nBecause I live in N. Oakland, Groceria Italiana and Donatelli's are my go-tos when it comes to picking up authentic Italian ingredients.  However, I visit the Strip occasionally on weekends to have lunch, so the next time one of those days and plans to make an Italian dinner coincide, I'll be sure to pick up ingredients here.

The menu is a standardized but plentiful list of fruit-based smoothies broken down by general category of what you might be looking for.  For example, if you are looking for a sweet splurge, try the Indulgence category.  Want something lighter?  Try the Trim Down category.  \n\nAlong with your mix of fruits and juices you can also add on any of an number of supplements or 'enhancers.'  All the usual suspects here- vitamins, caffeine, anti-oxidants, fiber-blend.  If this is your bag, you can pump up the nutritional value (and price) of your smoothie.  You can also ask to have any smoothie made \"skinny\" whereby they leave out the honey and/or turbinado.  I actually prefer this, as you can taste the actual fruit in the drinks and they are not so cloyingly sweet.  \n\nFor those a little more hard-core, they also offer smoothies with the powdered supplement packages such as MetRx meal replacements.  You have a choice among three different sizes and the prices go up as you go bigger and the hike is not a good deal till you get to the biggest monster, a 40 oz. but then what single person needs a 2.5 pound smoothie?\n\nBesides smoothies, the store also has a small bulk food set-up with snacks such as gummies, yogurt covered pretzels and a number of fruit and nut mixes.  Prices are by the ounce and can get a little pricey as there is no nearby scale to check your purchase till you get to the register.  They also sell of host of supplement bars and others snacks, many vegan or low carb.  \n\nAll preparation is quick and, unless there is a line, I am rarely in the store more than 5 minutes.  Nice and snappy, and the staff doesn't spend time trying to up-sell anything.  \n\nJust know that even the small size smoothie is going to run you about $4.50.

You have your ready-to-eat/deli, your barista, your bakery,  your confectionery, your butcher, cheese etc. all in one place.  The best part: the staff are knowledgeable and friendly, plus you get to taste samples.  I used to turn my nose up at ready-made dips or sauces, but this place has some great ones.\n\nTry the Bread and Butter Pickle Jalapeno Dip by Fiesta - mix that with some cream cheese and you've got one tasty dip!  Make sure you don't accidentally buy the overly spicy Texas Longhorn brand.  Their Roasted Red Pepper and Onion dip is delicious too.  \n\nIf you're looking for a hard to find vinegar, oil or seasoning - chances are, you'll find them at Dean and Deluca (albeit at a slightly higher price point).\n\nI like buying bread there and on my way out, I grab a Chai latte - they make the best!", "business_id": "hODaBUYzv0AbApej_bfZ-w", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-02-26", "type": "review"}

Where's Zabar when we need them? The espresso is very good, I stopped for an espresso and a croissant and there again was that inviting glass of \"fresh\" orange juice in front of me.

To me the big deal is that pasteurizing always changes the taste of the juice, even if it's \"flash pasteurized\"\n\nBoth young ladies behind the counter swear high and low that it's fresh squeezed and that's what they are instructed to tell customers.  I buy it, taste it, inform them that it's indeed pasteurized, demand to see the bottle and promise to apologize profusely if I'm wrong. The cashier asks me if I want her to check what the bottle says, I say please yes and she runs off to do it. The girl is back in a NY minute later and tells me \"I'm sorry, you were right\" \n\nThe manager runs over and refunds my breakfast, her dumb excuse is that \"they don't have a machine to squeeze oranges\". I tell her that's no reason to train the personnel to lie to the customers (no answer) and that they don't need to squeeze oranges any way, Fresh OJ is sold by the gallon anyway. I got lots of sorry, sorry but no assurance that they will stop that shoddy practice. I'm pretty sure that they will keep on marketing it as \"fresh\" anyway. \n\nThis is inexcusable: Harris Teeter retails fresh OJ for $0.08 a fl oz - http://shop.mywebgrocer.com/shop.aspx?strid=E277212 - since D&D charges $2.75 a glass, they could buy it at FULL RETAIL  ($0.48) and still make a 500% markup!!\nLike I said , no excuse and that's their second location were I caught them doing this.\n\nOh and yes their soups are excellent BTW", "business_id": "hODaBUYzv0AbApej_bfZ-w", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-01-01", "type": "review"}

So, we splurged in order to fill up our freezer and went for it. \n\nFirst, I counted the number of items (joking at first) and noticed that we only got 89 items. Not a big deal but it essentially negated the discount / groupon we were using. \n\nSecond, almost everything was mislabeled! Cube steak was hamburger patties. Chicken breasts were chicken tenders. Beef hamburgers were bratwurst patties. Pork cutlets were sausage patties....etc. Again, not a huge deal but annoying when you plan ahead, thaw an item for meal and end up having to improvise in the end anyway (hamburger stir fry isn't bad, neither is a bratwurst cheeseburger).\n\nFinally, I am not sure it was an outstanding value. We ended up with about 70 hot dogs, assorted bratwurst and assorted bratwurst patties which are quite inexpensive. Of the remaining items, portions were quite small and anything expensive was bulked up by wrapping it in bacon. Also, the assorted kabobs we got were simply flavored by dusting them with powder flavorings. They were still good, just not very gourmet and something I could have done easily myself. \n\nOn a positive note, the chicken Parmesan cutlets/patties were amazing!!\n\nAlso, the over the counter items always look and smell great!

Chances are, the fine folks at Natural Gourmet can help you out.  Gaye and Co. are wonderful at helping you find just the right item, whether it's a food item, a natural personal care product, or just the right supplement.\n\nLocated just west of Biaggi's, Natural Gourmet is easy to find.  The store is small, but absolutely packed with goodies, from natural snacks to baking supplies to awesome bulk bins containing spices (both the usual and the not-so-usual), teas, and coffees.  They also have an entire aisle of various supplements, vitamins, and herbal remedies.  I always know exactly what I'm looking for when I go, but the employees, especially Gaye, the owner, are extremely helpful when you're not quite sure what you're looking for.  I have several friends who are regulars there, and all they have to do is describe their symptoms, and Gaye knows exactly what they need and where to find it.  She's amazing!\n\nThey also have an amazing selection of food items, particularly baking supplies.  They carry a wonderful array of teas, both loose and bags, and are the only store in town that carry one of my favorite varieties (although I'm not going to tell you what it is, because they're almost always running low on it when I'm there to begin with!!).\n\nNo place is perfect, and NG does have a few cons.  Produce selection is very limited, to the point of being almost nonexistent.  Also, the small space of the store means that items are very densely packed on the shelves, which is both a plus and a minus in my book.  True, shopping is efficient, but sometimes the shelves look a bit \"cluttered.\"  This probably won't bother most people.  Also, the aisles are very narrow, which could produce a problem with traffic congestion, but I avoid peak shopping hours and have never had a problem.  The other con is that they close at 6:00 PM, so if you do all your shopping in the evening, you're out of luck here.\n\nPrices are reasonable and on the whole comparable to Strawberry Fields; some items may be a little more, others a little less.  The energy of the place is far better than Strawberry Fields, in my opinion.  It's hard to explain, but if you're sensitive to energy, it helps to know where the good juju is.", "business_id": "KFbxRthy3tKt-oi1Jp7XdQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2006-12-08", "type": "review"}

I can pull out a random fish from the freezer to ask them and they'll give me the name of it and how to cook it to perfection. \n\nI feel like every time I got, which is mostly weekly, there is something new that shows up among the regular items.

First, if you're looking for Korean food, this is not the place. So correction to my last review, you won't find everything you need. That's not the reason why I'm giving Far East 2 stars. The last few times I've been there, there were crates of raw meat left out, unrefrigerated. I'm not sure what is going on with that. I know that when I leave meat out for a few hours, it won't be fully thawed. But that's just for personal consumption. There's got to be something banning this sort of thing. Even if there isn't, this is an unsavory practice as a business. Who knows how long the meat has been left out. Perhaps they're letting certain items thaw so that customers can cook immediately after purchase, but now I'm just justifying their behavior. I would avoid the meat. And I would avoid the produce. Most of the produce looks fine, but I purchased some garlic and upon opening them, they had already grown sprouts. Too old. Too old. Far East, you're worrying me.

Given that Yelp never fails, the deceptively named La Tolteca Mexican Foods was presented before us as an attractive option. Hesitant as to whether it was actually just a Mexican grocery store, we hustled in to see what the buzz was about. Now, I know I live in the Northeast (veritable Mexican food desert), but \"Oh. My. Gahhhhhhhhhhhhh...\" This place is amazing. \n\nOne of the most appealing things to me about La Tolteca was its no-nonsense approach to everything. Food is ordered from a board menu above a counter and prepared in a small kitchen area in front of you. Slightly further back lies the grocery store component which does have an interesting (Maybe typical for Phoenix, but what do I know?) variety of Mexican groceries and specialties to recommend it. Back to the food though... that really was the main event. I ordered a chicken burrito which came out quickly and was f---ing enormous. Imagine the beams of light shining down from above when I turned around a spotted the salsa bar! I was able to taste all of their salsas including the piquant green chili pepper one which I am still thinking about. There's a vast dining area to the back where you can bring your food and beverage to gorge and take in this amazing experience. Maybe I just love Mexican food too much... Who knows, but I was really a happy camper here. \n\nWe looked over and spotted some people eating burritos that were literally the size of loaves of Wonder Bread, so consider that as one more reason to go (though even I, self-proclaimed food eater extraordinaire could not fathom eating one of those). The prices are ridiculously cheap, and the food was amazing, flavorful and truly memorable.

On Google it's rated 5 stars.  Here it's 4 stars.  And only a single dollar sign!  So we drove over.\n\nThe place looks like something you might find in Mexico.  No hostess.  Walk up to the counter, order your food, wait for your number to be called, walk into the dining area (ducking under a low arch if you over 6' tall) where you are greeted with basic tables and chairs.  Seriously...if you didn't know you were in Phoenix you'd swear you were in an eatery in Mexico.  They also have a bakery and a market attached to the food counter.\n\nOn to the actual food.  As this was my first time here I ordered the chimi.  I usually do that so I have a basis for comparison to other places.  My wife had the albondigas soup.  We both liked our dishes.  The chimi was done perfectly.  A light crunch of the shell.  Not overcooked, not greasy.  The chicken was moist and tender.  And it was a pretty big chimi.  I think one does need to add some pico to it because the chicken's seasoning was very mild.  The pico added just a bit of flavor that really made the difference.  And the Mexican rice was very nice.\n\nI wish it wasn't so far from home (Gilbert) because I'd love to make this my \"regular\" spot for Mexican food.  I would say it blows away just about every place else I've found in the Valley, and is neck-and-neck with Guerrero's (in Tempe).  I can't choose between the two at this moment.\n\nI hope to return here, and will be trying something different.

The green chile and cheese had whole strips of green chili and lots of masa, but Tolteca uses cheddar cheese and my preferred choice is some sort of white cheese for tamales.

The rice was good as a side dish, real mexican rice, but the fresh guac was also brimming with jalapeno's, so this was also a hot guac.

I mean, to me meatloaf and stomach pumping were always used in the same sentence, so I should have ran when I saw the meatloaf in the AJ's display case. \n\nPerhaps it was the hunger pangs (pains), perhaps it was the artistic way the bright red glaze embraced the loaf... It really makes no difference, I was hypnotized and had to have it!  This is the best that I ever had..\n\nTheir meatloaf is always juicy, beefy and perfectly spiced (for me) add the savory, somewhat spicy chile sauce based glaze....mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm... For me a yummy meal for about $5.00. \n\nBased on the above mentioned childhood trauma, I may lack the knowledge of of really really great meatloaf... and AJ's is just \"OK\"... so if you have a favorite meatloaf place, PLEASE email it over... now that the meatloaf scars are starting to heal.. it may be time to experiment and try more!", "business_id": "Mng1FUcW-xRSdsDkowQm2Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-12-07", "type": "review"}

This store has an Italian Kitchen, where they serve fresh pasta dishes, pizza, and more. Trivia, this is where legendary pizza chef Chis Bianco got his start.

Since they are not opened on Christmas day, we went and picked it up on Christmas Eve. It came with reheating instructions. When we tried to heat it up, the heating instructions were no bueno.

When I first started shopping here it was a pleasant experience but over time the customer service got worse. I am not sure if this was due to new employees or management. Although, I must blame management because the attitudes and treatment that I received usually travels from the top down. I had the most issues with a couple employees that work in the deli area. They were both always rude, short, and unpleasant. Every time I said hello to one of the women she NEVER responded. Not so much as a head nod to acknowledge my presence. I brought this to the attention of a cashier and she told me that she would speak to the manager about the service. I continued to go to AJ's but nothing changed and I received bad service over and over again. The last straw for me happened last week. I went to the deli area to get breakfast. I greeted one of the deli workers and she AGAIN said nothing. I was sure that this was on purpose and not her just having a bad day because it had happened so many times before. I asked her why she never responds and seems to have bad customer service. She dismissed me and said \"actually, I was just about to ask you how you day was going\" I thought this was amusing considering she just neglected to respond to my greeting... I told her that she had done this on a number of occasions and it was quite frankly rude and disappointing. She then jumps to want me to get my manager... Like she could care less about fixing the situation for the customer, apologizing, or making things right. \n\nSuper disappointed with my treatment at the AJ's. Will stay away from here from now on and I would definitely NOT recommend anyone else to shop here.

This location also has a special Italian Kitchen (Cucina Italia!) department behind produce that has fresh baked wood-fired brick oven pizza and pasta.\n\nAJ's differentiates from Whole Foods by focusing less on the \"all natural\" and organic slant and more on gourmet (expensive), unique, and imported items.  They are big on merchandising neat little themed vignette displays instead of traditional end-caps.  They'll have many more imported items and go up to a much higher price point (check out the olive oil and wine) than a Fry's Signature store.  Unlike Trader Joe's, they carry a wide variety of brands, and don't focus as much on packaged and frozen foods.\n\nThe prepared food is hit or miss.  I've had a bad monte cristo, awful turkey, good pizza and pasta, decent coconut shrimp and salmon, and amazing mashed and scalloped potatoes.  The soups are good.\n\nThe bakery is really fantastic (the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e is cheaper than Whole Foods, while the pecan pie and bar, Boston cream looking pastry, brownies, chocolate mousse, and more are all delicious).  Note that they carry some indulgent locally made baked goods (Fairytale Brownies and Tammie Coe Cakes).  Their organic AJ's brand sliced packaged bread beats OroWheat and Safeway's version.\n\nTheir gift selection is pricey but well-edited.  It definitely gives the market a more European or \"country chic\" vibe, more Anthropologie than the sleek natural-centricity Whole Foods embodies.  Holiday clearance is a great time to buy stuff 50% or more off!\n\nAJ's does carry \"normal\" national brands to balance out their imported/gourmet/organic assortment, so if you NEED something like Ritz crackers or Bounty paper towels, you'll find it here, as opposed to a generic or a pricey organic brand you'd find at Trader Joe's or Whole Foods.\n\nSome of the employees are unprofessional late at night, but to be fair it gets pretty empty compared to Whole Foods.  Maybe opening up a Wine Bar next door would help?  I think they're finally opening back up the coffee counter in the morning, which is a good business decision, as the bakery gets way too busy with coffee bar orders.\n\nDo I shop here often?  No, but it is great for a treat or to buy a gift.  Since they're local, I feel a little better about throwing down money (\"I'm helping the Arizona economy!\"). Shopping here doesn't give me that \"so healthy\" feeling of Whole Foods, but I do get a \"so fancy\" (or \"indulgent\") feeling, knowing it's just a little more special here.\n\nInsider Secret: Check their website for events like Floral Happy Hour (50% off) Fridays at 4pm.", "business_id": "Mng1FUcW-xRSdsDkowQm2Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-01-03", "type": "review"}

They usually have some cheesy holiday decorations out.  It's cramped and not that pleasant.  I usually get my lunches to go.\n\nTheir sandwich menu consists of about a million pages printed out from an inkjet printer and taped to the wall, along with some hokey signs that say things like \"Today's Special: So's Tomorrow.\"  There's nothing slick or pretentious about it.  It's obviously just a shop owned by some guy and his wife and daughter.\n\nSo yeah.  The sandwiches.  I'm a vegetarian, and they have a simple yet elegant veggie sandwich that I find myself craving a lot.  It has cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, avocados, and some kind of dressing.  I get it on a wheat sub roll.  Not fancy, but oh-so-tasty.  I wish they had more veggie options, but this one satisfies me.\n\nI bring friends who eat meat here so I can tell them to order the Doughboy and enjoy it vicariously.  Their deli meat is high quality and there are loads of options.  It looks like the sort of place my grandpa would love and I want to bring him there some day.  No one I've brought in has been disappointed.\n\nThe sides are delicious.  I am a fan of the macaroni salad and the pasta salad that has the olives and italian dressing.  If I'm feeling indulgent, I'll get a brownie, a piece of cheesecake, or an ice-cold sarsaparilla.\n\nThe lack of atmosphere doesn't bother me; my one gripe with this place is how early they close.  There have been many times I haven't gotten moving early enough and haven't been able to get there before they close, which is 4 PM.  Those times I do get my rear in gear and errands all finished before 4, I do love to treat myself to Cheese 'n Stuff.  I highly suggest you try it.", "business_id": "UWrB5H3G-hhiHMy3iKV2ew", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-02-23", "type": "review"}

I only recently noticed that they also stock Cajun tasso, which is a cured pork product used for flavoring diishes (think pancetta... but not as fatty, and with a spicy Cajun twist). I must warn you though, this tasso is a bit fiery. I had to sample it at home before deciding to use it in a pasta alfredo-type dish and the cayenne was up-front and in my face! Yikes! Ahhh, I do like the burn though...\n\nI also consider this one of my sources for German meal ingredients. They have the authentic weisswursts I grew up on, and they sell cans of kraut and rotkohl if you don't want to make 'em from scratch.\n\nFor lunch, they feature a limited selection of their house-made sausages on a bun with chips and a drink for $5 as their daily \"Brown Bag Special\".

It all looked a bit pricey, so I have not sampled their wursts yet. I have, however, done some great stocking stuffer shopping here--they have a good selection of German grocery items. I was thrilled to find their display of Kinder Schokolade-\u00dcberraschungseier (chidren's chocolate surprise eggs). Everybody (including adults) appreciates the complexity of the prizes you find inside these eggs. Maybe it's because of superior German engineering, but Cracker Jack ought to be ashamed of the prizes they offer when compared to these! The eggs were pricey though... $2.50 a pop (but worth it for the novelty).\n\nI also found myself impulse shopping for German candy Ahoj-Brause (basically fizzing pixie stick dust), mustard-in-a-tube, and Knorr seasonings. With all my Christmas stocking stuffer needs met, I was lucky to get out the door without buying too much more.\n\nI'll be back (\u00e0 la Schwarzenegger) to try the wurst here. The smell of their sausage counter still lingers in my mind...", "business_id": "fhLb0v5NBj93D7PLQpFXfQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-01-15", "type": "review"}

I have to say it took awhile going thru the store to find something that the kids would like and look like it was not sitting out for a long time. The roasted chicken was dry. It must be the fact that they use chickens that are not Pumped up with salt water (was talking to someone about their chicken). The seasoning was good though. Broccoli Crunch was good, kids like it, the crunch was from the fact the Broccoli was not cooked and it had almonds in it. Flat Bread was OK, can't complain about it. One thing I must say a positive about Whole Foods is the Cheese selection, you don't see that set up in too many places (at least where I can go that's a few minutes away). They had a sampling of Cranberry Cheddar out, the kids tried it and got their approval. Oh we also had Potato Leek Soup which was really good in my opinion. \n\nFresh Produce, Cheese, Wine, Desserts, Coffee, kitchen cooking hard to finds (if you like to cook), Fresh Fish and Meat.

Whole Foods, John Mackey's little baby he has turned into a behemoth within the industry. I am so torn by Whole Foods, of course most everything is more expensive. This could stem from when Mackey started the business as a democratic socialist and was not making any money, yet people were complaining about pay and high prices so he then turned into a free market libertarian - you can blame your high prices on that if it makes you feel better. Mackey is also a Vegan, but has said if he didn't sell animal products it would be bad for business(if the business even existed), yeah I get it, but I don't like it. Does anyone even care about the innard workings of the company CEO of the store they love/hate? Ok I'll cut this short.\n\nThis Whole Foods is an older store, not the real old school hippy-esque store, but it's nothing like the newer flagship stores around the country(like the one on Mayo). This obviously means they have to cut back on their selections to a degree but they still do a good job of cramming everything into this much smaller, albeit more \"quaint\" store. If I go to the Mayo store I am gone for 2 hours but only come back with a bagful of stuff because I was lost in a trance \"browsing\"; this makes my girlfriend very angry.\n\nI don't buy all my groceries here because I don't think some things are worth what they charge but in all honesty you can only find certain things at Whole Foods that you can't find anywhere else(Trader Joe's, Sprouts, Sunflower, etc). The Vegan/Vegetarian selection is massive compared to those other stores, they simply carry all the latest and greatest - it may not be the cheapest, but they carry it. \n\nOne last item, and this is for pizza loving vegan fools - Whole Foods was one of the first places to carry Daiya cheese. They actually sell shredded containers of it in the refrigerator section, but they also have it available at the deli. The usual counter worker isn't that friendly which is a shame and always seems put out but that doesn't make the pizza any less tasty. You can get one of their \"surfboard\" pizzas which will feed 2 for 2-3 days with a couple of toppings with Daiya cheese for $15.99.

I was disappointed to learn that the Cornucopia Institute did a study on cereal and discovered that Whole Food's brand 365 corn cereal was over 51% GMO corn.  They promote themselves as being GMO free.  Also, the sushi they sell is good, especially the brown rice sushi, but they come with little packets of soy sauce and I contacted the company to ask if the soy is GMO soy or not, but could not get an answer.  I left messages, but never received a call back.  This being the case, I suspect that it is GMO soy.  I had an Einstein vegetable juice today--freshly made juice, it was delicious.  They also have some kale chips that are to die for.  The Tuscon Tamale Company sells frozen organic blue corn tamales in Whole Foods in the frozen food section.  They're delicious.  I did contact the Tuscon Tamale Company, because I wanted some basic nutrional info on their product.  They never answered my email and when I called the girl said she didn't know anything about the tamales.

Thank you Naomi for you kindness and your spot on cheese suggestions!\n\nAs for at least one member of their management team, I can truly say she seriously lacks in the customer service area!  This is what happened.  As I passed by the registers I noticed one of their signature black sample tables.  On it was an open clam-shell container with 2 cookies inside.  I grabbed a cookie and proceeded to go to the produce section.  A few minutes later I was finally ready to check out.  As I was placing my items on the conveyor belt, a short woman with short brown curly hair and black glasses about 15 feet from me began to yell.  I looked up to see what the commotion was about and realized she was yelling at me.  \"Ma'am... ma'am, just so you know\" she exclaimed bitterly, \"those cookies were NOT samples!\"  I was so shocked and at that point everyone within earshot was staring at us.  I said I was sorry and I offered to pay for the cookies, and she retorted nastily with \"If you want to.\"  The bag girl looked horrified and I was thoroughly humiliated.  At least the cashier realized I made an honest mistake (I found out later that I wasn't the first one to make it) and tried to redeem their store's reputation by reassuring me \"it was OK.\"  However she didn't appear to be surprised by this woman's ridiculous and senseless behavior.  I wonder if she makes a habit of berating customers and her employees?  A customer from the other side of the next register actually came around to offer me comfort after this vicious verbal assault.\n\nIn taking the cookie I made a blunder but I already had over $80 worth of groceries in my cart, it wasn't like I was trying to get away with some kind of cookie heist.  This manager should have handled this situation in a more professional manner.  She should have approached me in a kind and informative manner (smile preferred) and brought the error to my attention in a normal conversational volume.  It is BAD business to publicly and uproariously mortify paying customers!\n\nBottom line, I will not ever return to this store!", "business_id": "wepFVY82q_tuDzG6lQjHWw", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-01-26", "type": "review"}

The sides were a whopping $30.  The ham $56, but hey it's family coming.\n\nWhen Sunday came along, we followed instructions, heated the ham and sat down to eat.  The ham was extremely dry, salty, tough and fat. Totally inedible, The sides, no better than Kraft or Marie Calender in quality and hardly enough to go around. Everybody was disappointed and couldn't wait for desert.\n\nSo, I went back with the awful ham in hand on Monday to get a refund.  Waited at least twenty minutes to speak with the manager.  He handled the refund himself, but would only give me back the $56.for the ham.  He grudgingly said he had credited us back on the the American Express card we used to pay originally.\n\nJust got our Amex statement,  Not only didn't he credit us back at all, he charged us another $56!!!.  So we are now out over $140 for a meal no one could eat.\n\nWhen I tried to talk to the manager again yesterday, some one over there said he was too busy to talk and would call us back.  And of course that never happened.\n\nMy advice.  Want a good ham and want to be really overcharged?  Go to AJ's.

You are not able to just walk around looking at produce in the warehouse (which I admit was my anticipation) She said if we would like to see anything specific, one of the guys would take us to the product and then back up to the front. \n-During the week Monday-Friday you can only buy items BY THE CASE. This is VERY IMPORTANT to know if your visiting for the first time. \n-They do a Farmers Market on Saturday Mornings and that is the only time they offer items to be sold individually. (EX 1 head of lettuce VS 1 Case of lettuce)\n-The prices are extremely reasonable and if your into juicing this is your place!

It was amazing.  I can't believe this is only 15 minutes from my cookie cutter stucco house.  It's almost hard to believe it's even in Phoenix - though to a native like me, it's just one more reason to remember why Phoenix is so great.  \n\nWhen most folks used to think of South Phoenix they thought of crime, blight and anything else associated with being on the \"wrong\" side of the tracks.  Sure, there may have been areas right next to downtown that were like that, but most of South Phoenix was all farming community.  While some of this still exists - especially near and in Laveen - most of these farm plots were sold off during the years to individuals for their own homes - and any of the large lots were sold off to developers in the last 10-15 years or so.  Most of these became mass produced houses (like mine) or shopping centers.  The Farm is off of 32nd street (with property stretching back almost to 24th street) between Baseline and Southern.   To put this in perspective - there is a huge Target/Fry's/Ross/Applebee's kind of complex at 24th and Baseline - and the South Mountain Community College is just North of that on 24th.  At 32nd and Baseline there is the Raven Golf course, with lots of condos all around it.  That all seems a whole world away once you pull in to The Farm.\n\nI'm attaching some pictures from their web site www.thefarmatsouthmountain.com.  I've been only to one of the restaurants so far - The Farm Kitchen which is their lunch spot.  But I plan to visit Morning Glory soon.  All the stores are amazing - and it's so cool to see where it all grows.  As we walked by the gardens it was great to see some kids (and adults) having the process explained to them of how they grow the food organically here - and it could end up at one of their restaurants, in one of the nicer restaurants in the valley, or sold at their Farmers market to be eaten in their own home.\n\nCheck out their menus online.  Yes - it's a bit pricey.  I was hesitant that I'd think it was \"worth it\".  But oh it was.  I can't explain it any better than stealing from a commercial - You can TASTE the freshness!  Everything just tasted so much better.  Not that the atmosphere didn't help - but it wasn't the only factor.  One interesting thing to mention - pets are ok.  There were two folks there who brought their dogs.  The doggies seemed quite happy to have some run around space (leashed of course) and then a nice meal by a picnic bench.  \n\nI'm planning to go again - bringing lots of friends and family at different times.  I'd love to try out their yoga and/or gardening classes too! This will definitely be on the short list of places a visitor needs to go when visiting from out of town.  Better yet though - it's one of the few places you can go in town and feel like you took a day trip out of the valley.", "business_id": "MLcXtnpzygZvQ9BtseLLlw", "stars": 5, "date": "2006-12-28", "type": "review"}

He seemed like the nicest man and was so happy to pair a person with the perfect loaf.  My fiance didn't get that from watching him, but I could tell.  We went over to buy some bread and he was in fact one of the most genuinely jolly people I've met - and I don't use the word \"jolly\" very often, but it fits him perfectly.
