My truck had been shuddering and shaking badly at certain RPMs & speeds. The dealer diagnosed the problem as my catalytic convertor and replaced it. After driving my truck for a day, I could tell the problem was not fixed and even felt worse.\n\nRather than go back to the dealer, I thought it was a good time to sever ties and try some place new. They had to keep my truck a few days to fully diagnose and repair the issue and actually took the time to drive the truck, first to recreate the problem, then to be sure it was fixed. Doesn't seem like a big deal, but the dealer clearly did not do this. They kept me updated throughout the process (what tests they were running, possible causes and next steps), offered me rides to and from the shop and a loaner car when they had to keep my truck a few days. Turned out to be a spark plug issue, adding to my frustration with the dealer, as the technician there had even written, \"probable spark plug issue\" on my receipt/work order, yet failed to fix it. However, their lack of follow through and poor customer service forced me to find these guys, who I feel like I can trust, so all is good in the end.\n\nI went into the situation a little standoffish because I knew my fix would be expensive, but I left feeling good about the service I received. They also warranty their work, I believe it's 2 years/24,000 miles? I've been to other shops that will fix your car for cheap and do a quick-fix repair that will mask or even fix issues for a time. If that's what you're looking for, don't bring your car here. These guys work hard to find and fix the source of the problem, not just the symptoms.", "business_id": "M-MFa0YErVBbFW2IJhGJmw", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-04-23", "type": "review"}

Nothing to write home about but still good. \n\nThis time... Wild tiger turned into wild sloth. Arguably just as cool in animal comparison but the tiger could, if he so chose to, rip apart the sloth with vigor. \n\nThe hostess was hard to find and inattentive. Se really wasn't present or rememberable. We sat down and ordered. Waters came out. Then our app. It was some roll thingy. It tasted like frozen shrimp wrapped in rice paper for 9 bux. Oh oh oh it tasted like the rolls you get at the sushi place in Safeway. Yea no thanks. Plus the waiter seemed to disappear. A while later the food was delivered. Hhmm. Pad Thai you say? Uh nope! Well if you call over cooked noodles shoved under a huge pile of cabbage pad Thai the yeaaa.. I guess. \nCurry you say.... Hmmm nope just over spiced over cooked and tasteless except for the over spice thing.., which is just down right confusing. \n\nThe waiter never came back to check on us. My lady dropped her eating utensil on the ground and I went inside to get another. Standing at the empty hostess station looking around....looking....still looking....oh oh hey  hostess can I have a.. She cuts me off. \"I'll be back\" denied!!!! By the drive by host from a terminator movie. \nWell waiting still. Find someone. Utensils. Cool. Thanks. Sorry to be a bother as a paying customer.   \nThen I sit back down. Take a few bites and realize everything tastes the same. Cold, over cooked and over spiced. \nSo in effort to try to salvage this meal I try to ask for some limes. Guess what... Shocker..... It took me getting up to find someone. Cool got em. Cool, great, not real limes. Just little ones, like the ones you use for Mexican food!! Wtf!!! \n\nAnyways. Forcing it down cuz I'm sick of the search party of two game that they have thrust upon us, the waiter still never came back. The lady bussing the tables cleared our stuff except for the untouched pad Thai. We actually tipped the bus lady she was nice and a very hard worker.\n\nStill\nWait\nIng\n\nOh wait I forgot the rules of the game.... I got up to search for the check. Yeaaaa! At what point do I win? And really what could the prize be?   Oh nothing. I guess you could say I win by not ever having to go back there. \n\nSad really. Was a good place. I understand running a place like this has challenges but no care was shown from beginning to end about the customer experience. Oh well except for the bus lady she was cool....

We arrived around 6:15. We were told there would be a 20 minute wait. As we waited we noticed several tables open. I asked about this and I was told they were preparing tables for a large group and once they were done they would assess the seating availability. The open seats were booths and a small table for 2 on the patio. A large group would not use any of these open tables. We Waite some more and when I went to see how much longer it would be I was told about 10 minutes. I reminded the hostess of the original 20 minute wait she originally stated that we were already beyond, and once again pointed out the several booths and tables that were open. She then tells me they only have 3 servers and that is why they're not seating all tables. If the hostess had been honest with me from the beginning I could have made the decision to wait or not. Instead my time was wasted. I could see the owner busy cooking in the kitchen. I would suggest she spend a little more time on the front. We wound up leaving and ate at a very nice place called Sushi Station. It wasn't Thai, but it's a very nice place, and the Sushi is really good. You should check it out. As for Wild Thai, I may give it a second chance, but the first impression has been made. I usually have my Thai fix at a wonderful little place called Sala Thai.

I couldn't believe that I had never been here before and I was excited to try a new place, so I could Yelp about it, of course!\n\nMy co-workers and I walked up on the wrong side of the cafe and came through the patio area.  Normally, I don't think this would have been a problem, however this night they had the majority of the patio roped off for a private function and we looked like we were trying to crash it.  Oops.  No harm done, they still let us into the restaurant.\n\nWhile waiting for everyone in the group to arrive, the two girls at the hostess stand were watching us with little to no expression on their face.  I felt a little uncomfortable, they were not friendly and welcoming by any means, but they eventually sat us none the less and our service was great from there out.  We decided to sit inside as it was a little warm outside.\n\nThe server was nice and even joked around with us a bit.  I ordered the Orange Beso margarita.  It was good, since it was made with vodka instead of tequila, it wasn't quite a margarita for me, but hey, it tasted good.  Since they drop off the shaker so you can refill your own, it was the margarita that seemed to never end.  That made me happy!\n\nPlenty of other people have mentioned the cool assortment of chips and the great salsa so I won't get into details.

You should find a job that doesn't involve customer service.\n\nMy friend and I were super excited today for Wing Wednesday ($9.99 all you can eat wings). We walk in and are greeted instinctively but the female bartender who also tells us to sit wherever. I choose a table next to the double doors that leads to the outside seating area. For 10 minutes we sat there without even so much as eye contact or a smile from any of the waitresses. I see that there are two moderate groups outside (6-8 people each), but don't give it a second thought. Still no acknowledgment from anybody. After 15 minutes, my buddy walks up two managers who were fiddling with a tv monitor and 3 other waitresses surrounding them. My buddy goes, \"Umm, can we get some service??\" The female manager immediately appoints someone to go to our table. \n\nThis blondie informs us that **Brittany** is our waitress, but she would take our first order. A few minutes after she takes our order, the lovely Brittany shows up. We had already watched this girl walk right past our table about 10 times back and forth prior to talking to the managers. She apologizes, like a child whose been forced to do so, for \"not seeing\" us. A) Simple acknowledgment would have sufficed. B) My buddy is a BIG tall guy with a mohawk wearing a bright red shirt. How the heck could she not have seen us? She then makes a pathetic attempt to explain that she got slammed, and says that she will now take our order. I tell her that our orders have already been taken. We get our first round of wings in a fair amount of time after the order was put in by Blondie. I asked for ranch and never got it. My buddy's cajun wings were too salty so he only ended up eating 6 wings. Brittany came back and only asked to refill my friend's drink. He told her Mr. Pibb, and she brought back coke. She took his plate away and didn't bother to ask if he wanted more wings since it was all you can eat. He's a big guy!!! Oh that's right. She didn't take our order so of course she didn't know. Shortly after I finished my own round of wings. Typically, the girls will see that you have finished your wings halfway and immediately ask you if you want the next round put it. No one asked us this. So I finished my wings and asked my friend if he wanted to go or keep hoping that the service will improve. BTW, those big tables were long gone by then. It was actually pretty empty by then. The whole time we just watched Brittany try to calculate her tabs and collect her tips. \n\nMy friend wanted out, and he said he'll refuse to pay if they asked us. We head straight to the door and NO ONE bothered trying to stop us. Instead we heard Brittany,\"Sorry guys.\" as we left. They knew what was going on. This is the very worst service that I have ever had. I would have still tipped had we stayed til the end, but it was so terrible. My wings weren't even that great. \n\nIf you come here, and you get a girl that is tan, has shoulder length curly hair, and is named Brittany, ask for another waitress.", "business_id": "qsWxbgQwuomXvMseg23DGg", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-04-11", "type": "review"}

Especially for my fellow vegetarians.\n\nBut the tides have changed, my friends. Yesterday, because they are close to work and I was starving, I decided to hit up Zoes for the only thing I ever really eat there - the Grilled Pimento cheese on rye which I highly recommend! Sometimes the cheese doesnt melt right and its lumpy but the flavor is divine. No boring grill cheese there. The rye adds a lovely added dimension of grilled-cheesiness.\n\nNow for the new, sexier menu, there are a few more veg options. \n\nI had the hummus and salad plate and I was so surprised at the awesome flavor. The hummus was as good as my homemade hummus and the salad is very well done with real lettuce (no nutritionless iceburg here) and fresh veggies and of course, the requisite Zoe's feta cheese. The cucumber Raita was just the right touch. \n\nSoooooo tasty!\n\nNow I'm not a fan of any of their sides, till now. The Braised white beans are a dream. I dont know what spices they used (ginger maybe?) but I couldnt believe my tastebuds. So proud of Zoe's.\n\nTwo notable changes:\n\n1)There is now a separate charge to grill the Pimento cheese sandwich (10 cents - really????) in addition to the 22 cent price hike.\n\n2) Chips no longer come with the sandwiches but are an extra 65 cents. (cheaper than the vending machine at work still)\n\nEither way, I'm compelled now to patronize this little spot more often.

If you're not, it's a bit confusing and overwhelming. We asked our server for suggestions, and we were pleasantly surprised with how knowledgeable he was about the cheese selections. Apparently, all of the cheese are flown in (no sure from where), and then held until they reach the prime age for serving. We ordered the three cheese plate with the Roaring 40's blue cheese, a sharp cheddar, and a Spanish cheese that I absolutely cannot remember the name of. All were delicious and were fantastic recommendations that paired nicely with our wine choices.\n\n We had also heard great things about the macaroni and cheese, so we decided to test them out. They have several variations on this old classic, so we chose to try the Blue Cheese and the traditional. The traditional was delicious- not overly cheesy (both literally and figuratively), and was baked. Yum! \n\nHowever, if you're on a tight budget, I wouldn't recommend visiting outside of Happy Hour. We ordered two glasses of wine, one soft drink, one three-cheese plate, two bowls of macaroni and a lasagna and found ourselves on the receiving end of a $70 bill. \n\nWhile the service and food were delicious, I thought that the price was a bit extravagant for the portion sizes. Overall, I enjoyed my experience, and will definitely return during Happy Hour.", "business_id": "muCl5p-9ut1sY0aKeUeRhw", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-03-23", "type": "review"}

This place is not easy to see from the street because it is in the middle of this industrial looking strip mall.  Be mindful of that. The drive to turn into the rear parking lot is just west of the building.  The building is on the north side of McDowell. \n\nThis was the perfect place for a Sunday afternoon dinner.  A lot of families coming in for Sunday dinner and tons of laughter and friendly banter filled the room.  The menu is full of Sal Vadorian favorites and I had an interesting time perusing the menu for a selection.  I ordered 2 things.  I ordered El Plato Tipico and   Ensalada (not a salad, but a fruit drink with fruit in it.).  \n\nI especially enjoyed the flavors of the Ensalada.  It was surprisingly delicious and sweet. I don't usually care for sweet drinks; however, this drink was refershing and the sweetness wasn't overpowering.  The chunks of fruit was nice too, but caused a bit of a challenge when I attempted to drink from the straw.\n\nOne of the things I love about South American restaurants is that there is always some type of \"typical meal\".  At a Colombian restaurant, you order the Bandeja Paisa.  At a Guanaquito, you order \"El Plato Tipico\".   This dish comes with an array of things that allow you to sample some of the simpler offerings.  My favorite part of the meal had to be the cheese and meat pupusa,  This is quite similar to the Indian paratha in style, not in taste.... A pancake stuffed with goodies.  The pupusa was so tender and moist with the appropriate amount of cheese and the hints of meat.  I savored every bite of those.  I also enjoyed the tamales.  Their tamales are wrapped in banana leaves and was the most moist and tasty masa I have had in ages.  I wasn't crazy about the chicken, I wish I'd gotten a pepper or veggie tamale, but ... still very tasty.\n\nReturn Factor 100%.", "business_id": "rbiRLiFTG098z9JaK3Nshw", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-03-29", "type": "review"}

We all decided to change our orders when our waitress came out and offered us the pancakes. We assume the cooks did not want to be bothered making more pancake batter and asked the waiter to tell us they were out. \n\nSome time had passed and we were all out of water with no service. I asked another random waiter for water and our free bread basket that every cocos normally provides. He gave me a dirty look and went into the back. 25 mins later our waitress comes back and finally asks if we need anything. I asked for the bread basket and she rolled her eyes and explained that they didn't have any bread and started walking away.

I am not sure I would have gotten as much enjoyment out of it if I'd had to pay $5 to get in...\n\nThe little desert rat-sqirrels, and rabbits were totally fun to try to find hiding in the many different plants and burrows.  I felt like a little kid ooh-ing and ah-ing at the different varieties of cacti and desert wildflowers, and have to give this place the ultimate rating .  If you're ever in Arizona, please give this place a try, it's very well put together and a beautiful site to see.", "business_id": "qMkIbQFrROSnPaQ7at85-w", "stars": 5, "date": "2007-03-12", "type": "review"}

You know..the date where its totally time to head out, you both have overstayed your welcome at the bar you are at, but its so not time for you to two to part just yet? Wait...really? Awesome, HIGH FIVE! But wait.... what if the date is *drumrolls* DURING THE DAY!? Yes, that's right, a day date! Where do you two go on a crisp Spring day?! THINK QUICK!\n\nGood ol' Jefe had this occur recently. My pretty little sidekick wanted to continue our date, and in a spur of the moment, I chose Desert Botanical Garden. Why? Its pretty....about as pretty as her. Right? Right? RIGHT?! So you go here and can quickly find out if she is a keeper! Easy: if she whines about being among the wilderness, there's your sign fellas. Ditch her and go frolic and try to catch butterflies....I'll allow it! Thankfully she was a keeper and we continued on. The weather was gorgeous and so were the views. Walking among the endless flowers and cacti, you can clearly see all of the amazing fauna Arizona not only supports indigenously, but can support from other locations. Broken into numerous sections, from the Native American Era Southwest to a \"Butterfly Garden\", this entire location is bound to please anyone. The views are beautiful, and so are the fun evens they put on all the time at night and throughout the year. It truly is an educational experience, and one I have enjoyed since I was a wee little Jefe in Elementary school field trips. Now as a man, I can enjoy it....in other ways.\n\nIt loses a star however for prices. $22? Seriously? I was not going to be a cheap ass and get my student ID discount on a first date, but c'mon man? 22 bucks? The zoo might be worth that....but flowers? Ahhhh! Also, they have a gorgeous selection of eucalyptus and other huge trees fenced in just beyond our reach....WHY can't I stand near the trees and enjoy their epic smell? Why...sweet Botanical Gods?!

Additionally, the personable staff at this section will tell you the whole life history of the particular animal you have fed. These animals -- giraffes and zoo staff at this section -- are among the best and top of class of any zoos I have visited thus far.\n\nMonkey walk\nFor free, one can go inside an enclosure where small monkeys are running, swinging, and otherwise monkeying around.  \n\nStingray petting \nFor a nominal fee (I cannot recall), one can get up close and personal (as close as Mandalay Bay's Shark Reef allows) and even pet/feed/whatever the stingrays. Seems like a highlight, although I would not know, since the staff at the pay booth refused to do their jobs because it was ten or fifteen minutes before closing. Did not realise it required arriving an hour early just to purchase an admission ticket to a small section. Note to Phoenix Zoo: Fire everyone at the stingray exhibit working the admission booth.\n\nWolves \nThe Phoenix Zoo has wolves. Some other zoos have them as well, but there they are used exclusively as companion animals to cheetahs and thus are not on exhibit to the regular paying patrons. In Phoenix, they have a relatively large enclosure which gives them room to run around, although the downside is that it affords them plenty of opportunity to find hiding places.\n\nOn an additional editorial note, I have to congratulate the Phoenix Zoo for their efforts on animal conservation. I read somewhere sometime ago that they took an endangered species -- on the verge of extinction -- and, successfully bred them to the point of being able to reintroduce them into the wild.

I arrived at the Chinese Cultural Center at about 4pm, after Dim Sum had ended at the Golden Buddha, so I decided to give this place a try with my Taiwanese boyfriend and visiting family.  The prices were a bit of a rip off for the portions that were served.  I order the vegetarian chow fun for $1 extra than it would have been as \"chow mein.\"  I'm assuming we just received the American menu, but who knows?  The service was conducted half in English and half in Chinese, which is typical when our mixed race party shows up at a Chinese restaurant.  I sampled the lemon shrimp my father ordered.  The sauce was a bit too sugary, like lemon drops, and the shrimp itself had such a thick, hard shell of batter that it was hard to taste the shrimp.  No drinks were suggested; we were left with only the water that was refilled every 5 minutes.  When we boxed up some leftovers, they did not give us the rice to take home, which makes me wary that it is being re-used.  A child was with us, and there was no kid's menu, which was a bit of a disappointment.  The food overall tasted alright, but I have definitely had better (and better service too!)

Rooms were very clean & pretty modern (except for the dated wallpaper). I think the hotel's located about 10 minutes from downtown Phoenix.\n\nSuite had:\n- Small counter w/a microwave, mini-fridge (actual fridge, not a mini-bar fridge, so you can store your own beverages in it), 2-cup coffeemaker (with coffee, tea, Half&Half creamers & sweeteners) & a teeny-tiny sink\n- Living room w/leather couch & fabric armchair, kind of flimsy coffee table & a flatscreen TV (Note: Remote was reaaaaally annoying to use b/c there was a 2-3 second delay each time you changed the channel)\n- Bedroom w/very comfy King bed, nightstands w/an alarm clock on one, a dresser & another flatscreen TV\n- Very clean bathroom, with 2 doors: 1 leading to living room, 1 leading to bedroom. Oh & must mention that this is also where the closet is. Yes, you read that right: The closet is in ... the bathroom. Huh?? (Closet had ironing board, hangers)\n\nEveryone at the hotel was very nice & accommodating, I was always met with courtesy & top-notch customer service everywhere (Front desk, lobby shop, bar/grill, valet, etc).\n\nHotel also had a lobby store (which sells beer & wine, for anyone who'd prefer to have a quick drink or 2 in their room without hitting up a bar), a lobby bar & restaurant, an indoor pool (which I didn't get to try out because I forgot to bring my bikini with me).\n\nMy only complaints (really minor):\n- Good yet Cheap Eats: Only place to eat at the hotel (without driving somewhere) was the hotel restaurant. Wasn't very happy with paying $15-$20 for mediocre (but edible) food each time I wanted to get a quick bite to eat. The lobby store had some snacks & Cup o Noodles, but that's about it.\n- Noise: Since the rooms face the atrium of the hotel, noise sometimes traveled up from the bar area & I was able to hear some loud laughter constantly at night. It wasn't crazy loud & didn't keep me up, but even from the bedroom, I was able to hear it a little. I guess my own stupidity was that I didn't shut the bedroom door, but I guess the comfy bed made me too lazy to do so.\n- Parking: Is $11/day, which luckily my man & I were exempt from due to a special deal he booked.\n- Elevators: Only 2 out of the 3 seemed to be working, for the most part they ran ok, but sometimes were a bit slow so there was sometimes a line of people waiting in the lobby for it.\n- A/C: It was kind of on the cold side in the room, even though I kept raising the temperature, it kept blowing out cool air.\n- No Safe: Didn't see a safe in the Bathroom Closet (feels weird saying that! haha).\n\nOverall though, would definitely stay here again!", "business_id": "urBWfXQjyyWIO5B7FvnOpg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-04-13", "type": "review"}

I expected to bite into my sandwich and be wowed. While I really enjoyed the mozzarella and soppressata sandwiches we split and certainly found them both more enjoyable than many sandwiches I have had in the Phoenix area, I just don't think this place is deserving of the Salvation Army of fans that seems to be willing to fight a holy war for that mozzarella sandwich. \n\nIn my eyes, what makes Pane Bianco's sandwiches good (and still worthy of 3 stars) is the fact that they are simple. Unlike some yuppy establishments where Arcadia ladies \"lunch\" (think Wildflower, Acacia Cafe or Chelsea's Kitchen), Pane Bianco (and by the transitive property, Chris Bianco) clearly has the European sensibility of \"less is more.\" A sandwich doesn't need to be piled high with garlic aioli, carmelized onions, and herb goat cheese to be good. If the ingredients are high enough quality, the bread and a few fillings should be able to stand alone and make for a great sandwich. \n\nI guess that's where my problem with Pane Bianco comes in. The individual ingredients of the sandwiches just weren't that great. Certainly, the mozzarella is good but I have had better mozzarella from nice local grocery stores and of course, at countless Italian places. I also agree with Kristin S that the soppressata was overly salty, which obscured the flavor. Finally, I didn't think the bread was as delicious as I had pictured it would be many times before actually coming. It certainly tasted fresh but I thought it could have a bit more flavor complexity (as it was, it tasted very white-bread and didn't have the slightly sour kick that housmade bread often does. \n\nI've got to be honest that after trying Pane Bianco, I am convinced that I would be a bit disappointed if I waited in line to eat at PIzzeria Bianco. While I can definitely appreciate a simple but delicious Pizza Margherita in a world where buffalo chicken pizza is somehow an appealing dish, the individual pizza ingredients would have to be better than the ones at Pane Bianco for me to truly feel like the wait was worth it.", "business_id": "-AAig9FG0s8gYE4f8GfowQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-03-03", "type": "review"}

His simple honest to goodness approach to food is not only inspiring but down right delicious. If you're one of his fans who don't mind waiting 4 hours for one of his amazing pies at Pizzeria Bianco, then you're in for a real treat. While they don't serve pizza, one of my all time favorites, Pane Bianco is now serving dinner and no serious wait either! In addition to ordering one of their famous sandwiches, you can expect an ever changing menu of rustic Italian inspired plates.\n\nIf you've been to Pane you know the drill, go in, order at the counter then either decide to take your score home, or eat there on one of the communal outdoor tables. No wine or beer is served at this time but there is talk of Pane expanding into the Lux Coffee space next door which will eventually offer inside seating and hopefully wine by the glass. If all of this goes down, Lux will simply move to the adjacent building also getting a larger space. For me Bianco's food just screams for a glassed of red wine.\n\nOrdering the Crespelle ($12) had me really excited due to the unique nature of the dish itself. Basically an Italian crepe made the garbanzo bean flour; it's filled with luscious ricotta cheese, hints of spinach then bathed in a slightly sweet tomato sauce. It was clear that after the first bite I was in love with this dish, I simply couldn't stop though glares from my dining companions made me to relinquish the plate. \n\nI can't sing enough praises for Biancos Housemade Mozzarella ($8), thick slabs of hand pulled cheese is paired with fresh tomatoes, a few leaves of basil, olive oil and a sprinkling of salt, that's it. The resulting texture and flavor is so toothsome and fresh that I've yet to have another as good. The salad comes with bread which I put to good use soaking up every drop of the salads milky elixir. \n\nServed on house made flat bread, the Soppressata with Aged Provolone ($8) which also comes topped with a healthy shave of Parmesan cheese and slices of roasted onion. The pungency from the provolone is a nice compliment to the pork-tastic slices of soppressata. \n\nBianco is dedicated to local purveyors and for good reason, they make some of the best Phoenix has to offer. Take the Sausage with beluga lentils and polenta ($10) for instance. The sausage comes from our very own Schreiner's Fine Sausages over on 7th Street and let me just say, this plump link had just the right amount of meaty well seasoned punch to compliment the hearty lentils and super moist polenta cake.\n\nIf you're more of a lighter eater, I'd suggest the highly flavorful Roasted Seasonal Vegetables ($5). On my last visit the pan was filled with long thick spears of asparagus, sweet potato, cabbage, radishes, broccolini and cloves of garlic. Grab a loaf of their chewy bread ($3) and you have yourself a vegetarian option even a meat eater like me would love.\n\nNow if they added pizza to the menu, my life would be complete.", "business_id": "-AAig9FG0s8gYE4f8GfowQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-04-24", "type": "review"}

I like the place.  The trivia host is entertaining and the place feels worn in, but not worn down.  I feel comfortable and welcome every time I visit.  Most weeks I end up ordering a couple beers from the rather large selection.  The drink prices, while high for some people's tastes, are comparable to what I've seen in other places.  Imports are going to cost more, it's the price you pay to have a selection of Boddington's, Murphy's and Guinness all in one place, among other things.\n\nNormally on trivia nights I don't end up getting food, as although I find their portions proportional to the prices, I don't feel I need to eat half my weight in fish and chips in one sitting.  I have no qualms with the quality on the few occasions I've grabbed some eats, for example the curry chicken is very flavorful and highly recommended.  The dragon wings are another of my favorite, spicy but not overwhelming.  The fish and chips, as previously mentioned, are served on a giant platter and have generally been excellent.\n\nI recommend at least one visit to this bar.  Don't be scared off by the divey look of the pub-front.  The F.C. scarves adorning the ceiling, British booze advertisements on the walls, and the cozy but not claustrophobic seating arrangements make it a unique place in the middle of the desert.

The teachers are overwhelmingly good, with a few exceptions, and the experience is as positive as one can have in a high school environment. \n\nThe all-dude \"fratmosphere\" can be a little off-putting, but it is surprisely beneficial in a four year timeline. By senior year, the comfort of single-ed classrooms far surpassed the need to ogle ladies and allowed for many fewer inhibitions and insecurities as in a typical co-ed setup. \n\nBy the time I arrived at college, I felt more prepared than the vast majority of my classmates and even more mature, in certain ways. I am a far cry from a die hard Catholic, but the Jesuit style encourages and facilitates renaissance learning, which should be the goal of any educational system, as I see it. \n\nEvery high school has its downfalls.

The only thing that is frustrating is that they are always busy and the situation to get a table can be a bit irritating when you have been waiting all week for cheat day...and speaking of cheat day the pizzookie or whatever it is called is super good as well if you are in the mood to pack on about 2500 calories in one meal these guys are one of the best places to blow a clean eating streak.", "business_id": "ML1RJdeZ7bbfMrHvJ7m99A", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-03-17", "type": "review"}
