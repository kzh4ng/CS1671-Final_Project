Who has been wearing glasses since I was 5 years old so please take this review seriously.  I know my way around a pair of eyeglasses.  Wow am  I getting old , that would mean I have been wearing eye glasses for 20 years.  \n\nDo me , you and everyone you care about a favor and avoid this location.  The service is here so incredibly inconsistent.  I have nothing,  I mean nothing good do say about the service that I have received here .The eye glass assistants are rude.  The way you are treated is sub par.  America's Best (I even hesitate to use that name because it's obviously not the best in America) just sucks.  \n\n Due to my terrible eye site I have to spend EXTRA money for thin lens.  So normally what I do is,  once a year I shell out $200.00  no insurance to buy two pair of glasses, paying cash.  The frames are alright but nothing that great. \n\nBesides my lens not being great another thing I  have a problem with is the poor customer service. On more then one occasion through out the years I have been talked down to. \n\n I have been wearing my current prescription from AB for about 10 months. This prescription is not good for me, before I had a magnified prescription that made everything BIGGER. My poor little blind self I have an astingamstism in both eyes. Two years ago I got good lens with nice frames but in 2012  I got shit lens with an okay frame.  I don't plan on returning to America's Best , it's just not worth it.", "business_id": "gX96CYY9T3K-jiippnnXDA", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-01-11", "type": "review"}

As a patient myself, I would like to help out fellow patients with a little insight I received during my shopping experience.\n\nMy consult resulted in a 'prescription' for PRK - one eye was too unstable for LASIK, according to BDPEC. However, I shopped around and a competitor said I was a great candidate for LASIK. I questioned this, as BDPEC said this was not the case - but the actual surgeon I met with said I would be fine. Ultimately I chose the competitor for LASIK.\n\nAfter much digging and personal research, I found that there are many things that can disqualify you for LASIK at BDPEC. They have a tighter set of qualifications. This can be great for people who actually qualify for LASIK there because 1) they are so conservative with risk that your surgery will probably go completely hitch-free and 2) their price for LASIK is actually pretty great. The problem comes in if you DON'T qualify for LASIK. They won't volunteer the information that their guidelines for 'prescribing' surgery are strict - they'll just tell you that you don't qualify. And if you don't shop around or if it's the first place you go, you'll probably just believe it! It was only after I went to the competitor and started asking more pointed questions (such as, 'What exactly is it about my cornea that disqualified me?' and How did you arrive at that conclusion?') that I was given the answers I needed in order to make the best decision for myself.\n\nI am now three days post-surgery from LASIK with the competitor. I did have a complication in the eye (the same eye that was flagged at BDPEC, which may or may not have actually been what they were actually concerned about. BDPEC had said I was at more risk for halos and starbursts, while the complication was that my eye dried out during my post-surgery nap and I dislocated the flap when I opened my eye - which turns out is frightening and not terribly comfortable, but also not the end of the world, at least not for me). However, the complication was easily solved during my next-day follow up when my surgeon just re-wet the corneal flap, laid it flat again and put a contact over top for me to wear through the weekend. It was removed today and I am quite pleased. Instead of having both eyes in discomfort and blurred with temporary contacts through tomorrow (as would have been the case with PRK) and the slower-to-realize results of PRK had I gone to BDPEC, I am now the happy, comfortable owner of great vision - on my own terms. I also think I will be getting a better ultimate result in vision from my procedure, as I had Custom LASIK instead of PRK (custom LASIK uses a laser that corrects more finite errors in refraction than the laser used in PRK or regular LASIK. I liken this to the difference between Zeiss eyeglass lenses and regular eyeglass lenses...when I was in eyeglasses, the step up in vision to Zeiss lenses was incredible and worth the extra cost).\n\nAs I said at the start of this review, I give BDPEC three stars because I am certain they provide fantastic results to the folks who qualify for LASIK. I am even certain that their PRK results would be great. However, I take issue with the fact that they will disqualify you from LASIK very easily - and won't be particularly transparent about why and won't tell you that other places might be able to treat you with the surgery you want. I suggest going to BDPEC and listen to what they have to say. You won't be meeting with the surgeon, but you'll meet with an optometrist and your surgery plan will be reviewed by a surgeon prior to your surgery date. If the optometrist says you can have LASIK, you'll probably be very happy - I am confident that they won't treat you unless your surgery will be an easy one (but do your own research on LASIK vs Custom LASIK, because they just have regular LASIK). However, if you don't qualify, make sure you ask why so you can shop around and see if other docs are capable of accommodating you. They will not offer this information voluntarily - you need to ask, and you need to ask very specifically. I just hate to think of myself having gone through PRK because that's all my eye could supposedly handle, and later find out I could have had the surgery I really wanted if I had been more informed and shopped around a bit. A friend of a friend just had PRK done (not sure where) and is still in pain two weeks later and 'wouldn't recommend it to anyone'...supposedly her eyes were 'too bad' for LASIK and I can't help but wonder if she could have had LASIK if she had just gone somewhere else. Thus, I feel I must share my experience and insight for the sake of other patients.\n\nBest wishes to all in the quest for great vision! And, as with any surgery, always remember to get AT LEAST a second (maybe even third) opinion", "business_id": "4R8uKEIwTVzHGLa3Edub0Q", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-01-12", "type": "review"}

But I found myself in the ER recently. The facility is clean and bare. Not much there to spread germs that's for certain. No magazines, children books, newspapers laying around. The wait was forever long, I guess my pain was not an emergency in their eyes so I got pushed to the back over and over. I choose JCL North Mountain because It is my intention to volunteer here. They give a lot back to the community and they are rated as one of the best places to work (that also has a low stress factor- how that can be in hospital amazes me). \n\nThings are pretty laid back here in the ER. You sign/write your issue down instead of verbalizing it to the entire wait room. I like that sense of privacy. You aren't openly asked a bunch of billing and payment questions before all else. This amazed me. And they seem to have two waiting areas once your vitals are taken. One for the injured and one for the sick that keeps you from becoming ill if you are just injured. Or at least that was the best I could figure from the way separated me and another injured person. If this is the case that is very wise planning. \n\nMy wait was 4.5 hours! With that said I was disappointed because I was in pain. I placed my pain at 8 on their 1 to 10 pain scale with 10 being the highest. Maybe I should have cried and screamed out in pain? Then maybe I would have been taken more serious? I don't know. Maybe they are understaffed? Well with that wait I saw a Doctor's assistant for all of 10 minutes and was told that what I was doing was all that could be done! Gee can I get a job here too then?! \n\nReferred to an outside source for a dental emergency and released. I thought since they have a dental emergency clinic for Children there might be someone there to help me. Wrong! \n\nNow I only fear the bill for this useless wait and even more useless visit of 10 minutes. But since I have never had a dental emergency before I'll say the place is A-OK based on it's cleanliness and sterile enviro and the fact that they take privacy to a new level. \n\nSO if you are doing anything freaky that hurts you, you might consider this ER if you're in a pickle and might be embarrassed by the actions that bring you there. The hush hush sense of privacy at the door where you fill in a form to tell them your trouble/ or situation keeps that all quiet for you so go here rather than to Good Sam or some other ER that has your verbally explain the situation in ear range of noisy other people.", "business_id": "Z9ogOCIkHasuKVELa8mQ_w", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-12-23", "type": "review"}
