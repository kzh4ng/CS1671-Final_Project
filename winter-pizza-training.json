Just so you all know I have tried almost every dish on the menu but will stick to what in my opinion is the best. I did not leave 5 stars because I do think it is a bit overpriced. The last time I went my server was really impatient and snobby when I was asking questions and trying to decide on the wine.  I arrived before the dinner rush on my birthday so I could take the time to really dine with my boyfriend. \n\nWhy I crave Pizzaiolo? Mozzarella di bufala. I know for a fact that every Thursday they fly in many choice ingredients directly from Italia. This creamy delicacy is by far my best loved. It either comes on the DOC Margherita pizza or mixed in with some of the pasta selections. I always order the DOC as an appetizer then the Rigatoni Alla Siciliana. They also only use San Marzano tomatoes in the marinara sauces which introduces a bold rich flavor without as much acidity. The key to these dense, deep red fruits is that they are grown in the fertile volcanic soil in Italy.  The Siciliana is an eggplant based dish that I find myself desiring often in my favorite dish spankbank. The perfect texture of the al dente pasta combined with the melt in your mouth salty, tart smoothness of the mozzarella and eggplant in the sweet heavily basil based garlic sauce is a party for the taste buds. I just keep eating until I am uncomfortably full. The wine selection is also above par, I enjoy the Berro Barberra. Full bodied, spicy, splashes of berry, and low in tannins. \n\nAs for the pizza, it is reminiscent of the famous brick oven pizzas of Da Michele found in only Napoli. The crust is extremely thin, light. and crispy. Follow that with my \"Pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance\" mozzarella di bufala, tangy san marzano tomato sauce, and fresh leaves of basil you will find that simplicity is more.

These changes ambush me without warning: not long ago I stopped putting Splenda in my tea - cold turkey. I started liking pastrami instead of corned beef. I stopped watching the news on TV. Is this a function of aging? I don't know.\n\nOne of the more dramatic changes has been my growing appreciation of the overall \"character\" of a restaurant. I find myself much more willing to overlook small gaffes in the food preparation if the staff is friendly and knowledgeable, or if the ambience is cheerful and interesting in some way. It doesn't have to be fancy - but it can't be gloomy and boring.\n\nThis was brought home to me today at lunch. Our friend Sue picked a place I had never been to - Spinato's Pizza. It's a family owned and run local chain with four locations. We went to the one at Bell and 16th Street. Sue brought along her friend/employer Lee. It happens that Lee's grandson works in Spinato's kitchen. He always makes it a point to arrive 35 minutes before his shift begins so he can take advantage of employee dinner and he appreciates being treated like family. The place is cute - decorated in red, green and white. There are striped awnings above the booths, and trellises with vines. The chairs are white with green (or red) seats, and the table tops are white with the Spinato logo in the corners. The patio has tables with red-checked cloths. We were warmly greeted , and our server arrived promptly to offer drinks.\n\nKen and I ordered a large Spicy Italian pie ($19.50) with added ricotta. We also got a salad ($3.99). Lee requested garlic bread ($3.99, $4.79 with cheese), and a small spinach calzone, one of the house specialties ($9). Sue got spinach too, but in the form of a \"lil\" (smaller than small) pizza ($7.50). The salads arrived first, notable mostly for their large size. While the ingredients were fresh, there was nothing exciting there. The olive oil and balsamic vinegar served with them were of good quality. The garlic bread, eight pieces in the order, was outstanding - lots and lots of fresh garlic and a generous amount of butter. You have to make sure that everyone you'll be talking to in the next few hours has eaten some too. The staff checked in frequently to ask if we were happy. The pizzas were served on a wire rack, a great idea since the thin crust remains nice and crisp. Instead of slices, our pie was cut into many small squares. I found that for some reason this caused me to eat less. The pizza wasn't loaded down with sauce, and it had plenty of toppings. I tasted Sue's spinach pie and it was really good. The spinach is marinated before being put on the pizza, and there's tons of fresh garlic. Lee's calzone was quite large - he took half of it home.\n\nThe menu isn't extensive. Besides the pizzas (10 varieties, plus design your own)  and calzone (there's a spaghetti and meatball one) there are two pastas and five sandwiches. We didn't inquire about dessert. The story behind Spinato's is told on the back of the menu. The family was worried that when they left Chicago for Phoenix, back in the \"70's, they wouldn't be able to find good pizza. What choice did they have but to open their own pizza parlor?! As the family grew so did the number of parlors. While the prices aren't low, you can go to lunchclub.com and get a 25% off the entire bill coupon. Aren't coupons great!!\n\nI have to say that if I was doing a blind taste-test between Stumpy's pizza (see the archives) and Spinato's, I'd probably give the nod to Stumpy's. But if you add in those other factors which have become important to me, as a dining destination Spinato's wins. It's also won awards from Phoenix New Times, the Scottsdale Culinary Festival and City Search.", "business_id": "YldXB1hRpnE1CWLF3mvgpQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-01-14", "type": "review"}

And there's also a decent little area for dining in, including arcade, but who knows when we'll ever make the time to stay. Maybe if there's ever a band on the stage?", "business_id": "NTgVdfRLbU0aKJH_9h3VCw", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-02-27", "type": "review"}

I can't believe I only just now found it! Being Italian, I'm pretty picky about my Italian food and this place is so good and is reasonably priced! At the outset though, I had my doubts because their bread is a really poor excuse for Italian bread. It's soft and not anything like the crusty Italian bread I'm used to. Normally this does not bode well for the quality of the food. However...\n\nLasagna and eggplant parm were very good (don't think I'll ever find any as good as mama's or my own). Salad with house Italian dressing was quite good (no wilted lettuce as another reviewer experienced). Trio pizza (ricotta, tomato, basil) and clam pizza were excellent! Never had clam pizza before. It was garlicky and wonderful. They also made me a red clam sauce version. It was good too, but not as garlicky as the white. Also had pasta with broccoli and sausage... Excellent. Only thing is that the clam pizza and pasta were a bit oily for my liking. Next time I'll ask them to cut back on the oil.\n\nThey make their own Sangria and oh my! Love it!! Nice and fruity, not too sweet and not too dry. Finally, I had the cannoli--hands down the best cannoli I've had in a LONG time.  \n\nThe other thing I love about this place is that it's family-owned and you can tell they love what they do. All were so warm and friendly. I went for my birthday dinner with my husband and they really made it special. But get this... they didn't even know it was my birthday! I had finished my sangria and thinking about how I'd love another when the waiter came over and asked if I wanted what was left in the carafe, which turned out to be a full glass. Then when he brought the check he served us a cannoli on the house! When I thanked my hubby for telling them it was my bday, he said he hadn't! \n\nDefinitely returning often... Especially for the special pricing on their pasta dishes on Mondays and Tuesdays!", "business_id": "hgb1RihLYRSpFBjBhn8rZw", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-12-13", "type": "review"}
