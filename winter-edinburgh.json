No? Ok. Next! discussions out of the pain) and helped me narrow down the available restaurants according to the Silent Reviewer's specifications down to um, The Doric. So, our options were relatively limited, but it was such a good thing, in this case. It was a cold, miserable December night, the pub downstairs was heaving, the restaurant upstairs the same. But, all the meals were great, service was pretty damn prompt, with nary a person left without a drink too long, and our meals were all served together. With a big group, it's often that this fails, especially in the catering style poor quality party food that makes an appearance. Not here, and in fact, there was a non-festive menu still available to choose from that just made my heart sing - all too often the Silent Reviewer is left with turkey as his birthday meal option year after year.

Ein Sainsbury Local (ein kleiner Express-Supermarkt) ist nur ca 100-150m entfernt.\n\nIn der stylischen Lobby gibt es kostenfreies WLAN, das Hotel-eigene Restaurant bzw. die Bar lohnen sich eher nicht - gegen\u00fcber gibt es zwei Pubs, die beide besseres Essen in authentischerer Atmosph\u00e4re f\u00fcr weniger Geld bieten.\n\nDas Personal war sehr freundilich und ist bei Bedarf mehrsprachig. Unser Zimmer war in Ordnung, einzig im Bad befand sich etwas Schimmel (mehr dazu unten bei Contra 2). Der versprochene castle view war allerdings nur erahnbar, wenn man sich ausreichend verrenkt hat.\n\n\nGro\u00dfes Contra 1: Die Lautst\u00e4rke.\nWeniger von draussen als viel mehr vom Flur und den Zimmernachbarn. Die W\u00e4nde bestehen scheinbar aus Papier und man h\u00f6rt wirklich alles (ja, leider alles!) was im Nachbarzimmer so vor sich geht. Hinzu kommt, dass die T\u00fcren konstruktionsbedingt von selbst zufallen - und das ziemlich laut.

Hierzu muss ich sagen, dass dieses Problem scheinbar in den Zimmern im alten Teil des Hotels nicht besteht.\nIm neuen Teil allerdings lassen sich die Fenster aufgrund der stylischen Glasfront nicht \u00f6ffnen - Was dazu f\u00fchrt, dass die einzige Frischluft durch die schwachbr\u00fcstige und nicht regelbare Klimaanlage kommt. Besonders interressant wird das dann, wenn Morgens nacheinander 2 Personen duschen - Abends ist es dann im Zimmer immer noch warm-feucht und muffig. Dadurch, dass die Feuchtigkeit nicht anst\u00e4ndig abziehen konnte hat sich im Bad auch entsprechend Schimmel gebildet.\n\n\nAbgesehen davon ist das Hotel eigentlich empfehlenswert.

Happy birthday!\"\n\"Bro, my birthday was in June.\"\n\"I know. I'm taking you to Petit Paris. Woah, look at this city, it's PERFORMING! What's THAT building? And that one?\"\n\nThis was the exchange that occurred when my excellent brother stepped off the train at the beginning of his visit last month.\n\nNow then. There are two reasons that Petit Paris was the first place that sprang to my brother's mind when he wanted to take me out for a meal in a city he'd only actually visited once before. The first is that he didn't really know anywhere else. The second is that he was genuinely impressed with it when he came to Edinburgh last and he doesn't like to give shoddy presents; he's good that way.\n\nWell, I see why he was impressed. The waiter who took our coats and saw us to our seats (table complete with cute gingham tablecloth) was cheery and warm, and plenty patient as we ummed and ahhed over the delicious-looking menu. We began with snails to share - yes, folks, I do the snail thing, and if you have not done the snail thing, Petit Paris is probably the place to do the snail thing. Rich in a garlic and parsley sauce, and blissfully un-chewy, they nestled in indentations in the special snail-dish like happy little blobs of buttery snaily joy. That dish, by the way, makes the process great fun and also, when you're sharing as we were, easy to ensure equitable division of the very good goods.\n\n(I like to imagine that I am a hedgehog when I do the snail thing. That's just an irrelevant little side note for your entertainment.)\n\nMy main was the goat's cheese and vegetable pie - utter bliss. The number of times things get passed off as pies when they're really just tarts is so disappointing. The difference, of course, is that a pie should have pastry on the top. This, to my delight, did, and the pastry was superb. Likewise the filling; the goat's cheese was liberal although it could have perhaps been more evenly distributed as it took me a couple of forkfuls to find it, hiding as it was under its pastry blanket.

Good thing that I didn't actually had an hangover otherwise I would have been really annoyed during this visit. \n\nThe owner / manager showed us to our table. Which was nice, close to the heater. He took our voucher for the brunch and asked if we wanted coffee or tea. - huh? I sometimes like simple, non fuss choices this wasn't one of those moments though. I did find out from the drinks menu there were slightly more choices, but I got the idea that on the voucher it was either coffee OR tea.\n\nWhen our coffee & tea arrived I noticed no sugar on the table - or any table - so it was something that should have been served with the order - so I got up to ask the waiter/owner/manager for some and promptly he did bring some. - It should really be served with the Coffee & Tea (since that wasn't really that complicated of an order to start with)\n\nWe ordered our waffles; mine with bacon and maple (?) syrup and the wife scrambled egg and salmon. The waffles were of the very thin, round Tefal waffle-maker variety. Shame, as I was expecting a nice thick square Belgium waffle. But yeah a waffle we did get. The bacon was OK and crisps, the syrup tasted golden NOT maple and very little was served.\n\n*sigh* here we go again..\n\nI had to ask waiter (non owner / non manager) for extra maple syrup and some butter to moisten the waffle. - which was not offered nor were we asked if anything was to our satisfaction. \n\nThe Bloody Mary was big, nice. No celery stick, not nice. - and here I went again.. this time asking for Worcester sauce and white pepper. - no white pepper on the premises - but celery salt was offered - thanks.\n\n Too many times I had to ask for additional things that you'd expect to be on the table or served with an order. - that staff was not easily approachable. I did try from my seat, but to get things I really had to get of my seat and go to the bar/serving/kitchen area. \n\nIt was in all a bit of an disappointing visit.\nit is difficult to complain about having to ask for something and if it was only one thing fine.. but so many things that needed to be asked for was very annoying.", "business_id": "QopG-46G0EIeePT8q-4JtQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-12-23", "type": "review"}

As far as independent/arthouse cinemas go, the Cameo has a couple of nice tricks up its sleeve. First is the membership which will set you back \u00a330 a year but gives you discounted rates on tickets as well as concessions and also includes three free tickets to any movie or your choice (which goes some way to discounting the membership price.\n\nThe second thing the Cameo has up its sleeve are the double bill Sundays where they'll show two semi related movies back to back; the first usually being a recent movie which is nearing the end of its run and the second something vaguely related to the first (for example today they showed Machete followed by Planet Terror). The good news with these double bills is that they're the price of a regular ticket OR free if you're a member (again knocking a few quid off of that ticket price). There's no obligation to stay through both and it can be a good way of killing a lazy Sunday afternoon.\n\nThe final thing that the Cameo has up its sleeve is a bit of personality.

Well it was fun, staff were friendly and attentive, they coped well with our ever increasing table (well, we squeezed in as we're a friendly bunch) and offering a separate brunch menu is a nice touch.\n\nAs Jenny L explained, its not an extensive menu but it is full of 'brunch' type offerings so does ok and offers big breakfasts, breakfast rolls, veggie and gluten free options. The gluten free option (one listed) is ok if you don't have a problem with eggs. Yep, I'm weird. I like omelet's, tortilla and frittata but try and feed me an egg scrambled, poached, fried or boiled and I freak out. It can't even be on the same plate. \n\nLuckily Hamilton's cobbled together a gluten free option (bacon, beans, tomato, spinach, salmon and mushrooms) for me. It was ok, but 3 starts only as the spinach was really grainy. Like chewing on a mussel which wasn't cleaned properly and getting silt and sand. I ended up leaving some on my plate as it was really off putting. Everything else was ok, but as David J mentioned, another rasher or two of bacon would have been great, so a very big plate, but the portions appear smaller. \n\nI would go back here - not sure for brunch but poor Hamilton's is probably being reviewed on the back of me weaning myself off Dottie's in San Francisco where I became addicted to brunch (10 days since Dottie's - not a happy celebration). \n\nI think it would be a nice option for lunch with a group of friends and it seems to be dog friendly too so I think I'll be back here in the next few weeks. I'm not sure how GF it would be for lunch having not viewed the menu, but having some awareness of GF and allergies and this is noted on the menu, is a start and I'm sure there would be a few choice items worth sampling.", "business_id": "KqgeyLdYbfsd9veyR6UGtw", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-12-04", "type": "review"}

The table space required for our group of 15 was misjudged which followed with a little shuffling and squeezing as there were no extra tables to add on (when you just want to sit down and get on with the munching on a lazy Sunday). However, I thought the staff gave great service, especially when add-ons to the order were regularly requested at different ends of the table which resulted in the them continuously going back and forward to our table.

Whilst I can only remember that I had pan fried chorizo with cider, lemon, chilli and tomatoes for my starter which was presented in a cute mini frying pan with a generous serving of bread to soak up the juices and was oh so delicious; I do recall being impressed with their menu.

It being Hogmanay, the place was packed and we were lucky to get a walk-in table (possibly the last one!), and it being day time it was more specifically packed with babies! Lots and lots of new parents meeting up with their friends for an end of year get together, and bringing the weans along with them.\n\nThe fact that it was so busy meant that my steak ciabatta sandwich took a little longer to arrive than it probably ought to have, but this was understandable and forgivable. Otherwise the service was largely fine, I mean it took us a while to flag someone down when we wanted to pay but again, it was hoaching in there.\n\nMy sandwich itself was tasty, with good chunky chips and a little pot of gravy (for pouring? dipping? I dipped but I guess it's up to you), and nicely cooked.  My criticism would be that they'd been a bit mean with the steak.  It wasn't one piece, it was several chunks, and only a few at that - areas of the ciabatta were steakless.  Which, for nearly a tenner in price, isn't good.\n\nMeanness of steak aside, Hamilton's seems perfectly nice.  Any service issues can be explained by it being packed.

Fo' sho! We had a lovely little booth by the window. There was banter, there was chat, there was delicious cocktails. I had the berry flirtini, of course!? It was fruity and spot on!! I then had the Mistral Royale which just as tasty, but sadly about half the size! There was also munch, I plucked for some spicy potato wedges and Mussels which came in a vodka-y/vermouth-y broth. Both hit the spot, although I thought the broth from the mussels lacked flavour or a certain punch, which I had been expecting. Overall this visit was good!! Only down point being I did feel like they were maybe rushing us a little, I get it, we are sitting in at a food only table, but I certainly was not in any scramble to leave.\n\nSecond visit was specifically for the mulled cider I had seen advertised on the previous visit. My friend and I had spent the afternoon trampling down Princes Street 'trying' to get some Christmas shopping done. It was not a very productive afternoon, and the Saturday rush was beginning to get to my head, the only sensible solution - Mulled Cider. He utterly agreed, of course, who wouldn't!? So we headed to Villager. He was rather impressed by my choice....... and the cocktail menu. So we had some cider, it was perfect-o, warming, not too sweet with a lovely hint of orange. Then of course he wanted to try one of the cocktails, so I just had to have one too. He went for a cucumber-based concoction, which was not to my tastes, but he enjoyed it. I had some lethal tequila lovely yummy tasty thing. It was as good as my last experience of Villager cocktails. Only problem this time, lack of comfortable seating if you are just having a drink.

My wife and I are big fans of Alexander McCall Smith's 44 Scotland Street series of comic novels in which V&C is featured as part of the setting in Edinburgh. The characters pop in to Valvona & Crolla for their sun-dried tomatoes, olive oils, wines and other delicacies. Angus' dog Cyril once surreptitiously ate a small salami that was knocked of a shelf. Having never been to Scotland, I didn't know if V&C was a creation of the author's imagination or a real shop. I Googled and discovered that it is indeed, real. Next, I found a perfect gift for my wife, a Valvona and Crolla shopping bag. After setting up an online account, I began to input my PayPal and shipping info, only to discover that there is no provision for shipping outside the UK. Alastair and the Despatch Team to the rescue! He answered my questions, got me a shipping quote, and gave instructions on filling out the forms. My order is now on the way to Texas via Royal Mail. Hooray and it occurs to me that Mr McCall Smith is also a fan of this fine establishment, since he features it in the novels.

Personally, I thoroughly enjoyed Dynamic E!\n\nVisited a few days ago (in January), so had the place pretty much to ourselves. In our visit there we travelled back in time, stood in a volcano, strolled through the Ice Age (it was a walk in the park), stuck our tongue out at a big ole (plastic) lizard in the rainforest, watched a 4D movie and moved one step closer to the stars.\n\nIt's cheesy but good, suitable for kids of all ages, well paced, entertaining enough for wee yins but with enough info posted around to keep from patronising the oldies. I've got to say though, the experience was heightened by the awesome, friendly bunch of staff. Their information tripped off the tongue, they were approachable and engaging. They weren't too full on as you sometimes get in these places. I got the impression their opinion really mattered, so rather than seem like they're complying to a glossy gimmick their personalities shone through when delivering shows. Their chat was definitely spontaneous, so we learned more as a result. And I do love to learn!\n\nAside from the staff, my highlight was David Tennant's narration of the cataclysmic tale of the universe. The movie was touching and inspiring, not to mention easy to understand. \n\nI didn't make it past the gift shop alive - they've got GEMSTONES. I ended up buying myself a bloody cuddly parrot as well. How old am I? Never too old for Dynamic Earth!

You are taken on a journey from the Big Bang to the shaping of the Earth and at no point during this journey are you at all bored, unless this stuff doesn't interest you at all, in which case why did you go?\n\nI feel this place just gets everything right. Instead of having you wander around aimlessly to begin with your left to watch a series of documentary like movies based on some of the main events which have shaped our world. These movies, narrated by John Hannah(the mummy) are the perfect introduction into the Dynamic Earth scene and do fantastically well to keep the guest interested. Then to end the day with a Bang we finish off with the beautifully done 'We Are Astronomers', an inspiring short film telling the story of the incredible progression of Astronomy today and how we are all joining together to delve deep into unraveling the answers to some of life's biggest questions about the Universe and the beginning of, well everything really.\n\nWell thats the exhibits done, now lets focus on the other little things that make a big difference. The staff were amazing. I didn't feel they felt forced to give 5 star service, I felt they just genuinely wanted to. The gift shop had all you could expect, magnets, mugs, postcards, books, cuddly toys, selection of sweets, stationary, and all those little silly science type toys kids would love to waste there money on. I spent \u00a330, I was happy with that.\n\nIn the cafe they had a great choice of food and I enjoyed my chosen meal.

The Antiquary sure felt like home from the onset.\n\nAs newbie musicians to the Stockbridge area, we were here for a folk jam, with a slight problem: we don't play folk. We had thought it was an open mic. Turns out, it's just friendly folks playing music in the corner and anyone can join in/take their turn. Or you can have a drink and just savour the sounds. If you're somebody who wants to dip their toe into the live music scene, this would be ideal because whilst there's an appreciation for the music, it's very relaxed with light chatter going on in the background. The musicians who lead the night are really very talented; a pleasure to the ears. What was really lovely was that we came in with our guitar, sat at the bar and thought that it might be best to sit the night out and listen, but the kind lady behind the bar told us that we shouldn't be shy and that it was an open forum. She even sang a song later in the evening, which was sweet. \n\nThe friendliness continued when we took up seats closer to the jam. Before we knew it we played some original songs and our tunes were brought to life in ways we'd only dreamed of. - There's only two of us, and we long for a bigger sound! The musicians couldn't have been friendlier and really set the tone of the pub. Bar staff, musicians and drinkers alike were appreciative that we'd come along to join in and we're already looking forward to next time. \n\nI'd really been missing my previous local and their live music, roaring fire and undeniable friendliness. - The Antiquary seems to have filled that void.", "business_id": "71Jz93r-PIkXpAP9Od_YwA", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-12-11", "type": "review"}

One Yelper *coughJoeAcough* really, really doesn't like them. Something about a pizza incidence once?\n\nFor me, having lived in Glasgow, I can say Lothian Buses is miles ahead of the Glasgow network. First off, a set fare for any route in the city. Glasgow charges by the distance travelled. Yes, the price has succesively gone up from \u00a31.10 to \u00a31.20 to \u00a31.30 and most recently \u00a31.40 in the past two years. But that's still cheaper than what I payed in Glasgow 5 years ago.\n\nEdinburgh is a city of many villages. Stockbridge, Leith, Canonmills, Newington, Bruntsfield. And they're all connected by Lothian Buses. The routes are really great, they suit pretty much any route from A to B. The buses are frequent. The app, and the on-street electronic signs, are always accurate. The app is really pretty good.\n\nI think at the moment, given the Tram Works interrupting the whole city, the bus routes are disrupted. This can be annoying. But it's not the buses fault.\n\nThey also in the last year recently brought in a whole fleet of energy efficient buses. These new buses talk to you and do all sorts. Impressive.\n\nYou can't help who uses the bus, and yes the bus may often have questionable characters on it. But I think the Lothian Bus network keeps all of Edinburgh very well, and frequently connected. Their prices are fair, the bus routes are very convenient, and when you need to get from A to B they do the job.", "business_id": "9mW3X0VkQ61QWlJWWSGs7g", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-02-20", "type": "review"}

There were no specific problems, but it just wasn't as crisp or accommodating as other Hiltons at which I've stayed, particularly Boston and Amsterdam.  I suppose that it's difficult to maintain a standard of service across hundreds of hotels worldwide.  For instance, instead of agreeing to have a cab waiting for me at a certain time of the morning, the desk clerk insisted that they could get me a taxi at very short notice and that I should just wait until I came down in the morning.  So of course it ended up taking about ten minutes.  \n\nWhen I checked in, they sent me to a second building across the street a few doors down.  The room was actually the smallest of my entire trip (a variety of lodging types) but was quite comfortable, except that I needed to pack for home and there wasn't quite enough surface area.  The shower/tub had a weird half-door which caused me to get water all over the place in the morning.\n\nThis Hilton is only two blocks from the Dollar Rent-A-Car on Haymarket Terrace, and maybe 3-4 blocks from the Haymarket train station.

The source of my positionality stems from my new found love for the city of Edinburgh. \nThe city is so beautiful complaining about a hotel seems incredibly obtuse. I shall however not digress and give you an insight into what the stay was like.\n\nNow what does a hotel have to do to gain browny points with me? Answer is simple, They can't be taking the buiscuits! Nothing spoils my ritual of having a brew before settling into my alien hotel bed watching an early 90's flick on sky movies than bad biscuits. You can imagine the horror when upon checking in I discovered that the biscuits were absent! \n\nThe staff at the hotel were extremely friendly, and catered for all my room service needs in good time. Parking is an issue, if like me, you didn't want to pay for it. Hotel does NOT have a guest carpark! Yes I know it's silly to expect to NOT pay for parking in a city centre. My theory is if I can get around it in Manchester I can get around it anywhere!  As it turns out you can get away with it but only 2 hours at a time, at the various Tesco stores located around the city centre!  Return to your hotel at 6 (after parking charge hours) and you can park outside the hotel for free, RESULT! However plan an early activity as you'll have to move the car in the morning! \n\nA second factor in my browny points book for hotels is its restaurant. On any given occasion when you don't want to venture out to have a meal, I feel the hotel should be able to cater for your taste buds! I am here to report that the restaurant indeed IS more than competent in this department. The menu is a little limited but the food I had was deliciously cooked and served in good time, although that might have had soemthign to do with the fact we were the sole diners that eveing at the restaurant. (It was midweek on a chilly January evening)\n\nAll in all a happy and satisfactory affair and whilst it may not be the best hotel in town, it is in close proximity to most of the atttractions Edinburgh has to offer.", "business_id": "e8wCD4XNCcxSeTSrAU6xLA", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-02-13", "type": "review"}

Irn-Bru is like the Coca-Cola of Scotland.  I can't say what it tastes like since I went with a glass of wine. \n\n I also had the Scottish haggis, haddock in cream sauce, and sticky toffee pudding.  The dinner was fantastic and went beyond my expectations.  I think everyone in our group participated so we had a packed house.  The restaurant itself is cozy and the hotel is a small bed & breakfast.  It's a gorgeous venue located down the street from our hotel.  The service was great.  Our table happened to be the first to be served so that was nice and we were closest to the bar.  Anything we wanted to get from the bar was paid for separately so that was easy.   If you ever wanted to try haggis, this is where you want to have it.  It was served with taters and nips pureed on top with a whiskey cream sauce.  The haddock was flaky and delicious.  The sticky toffee pudding is delicious.  The food was phenomenal.  \n\nWe were also treated to the musical stylings of Andy the Piper.  He happened to be the Queen mother's favorite piper and has played for the Queen on numerous occasions, including a performance right before ours.  He told jokes and played some traditional Scottish songs with his bagpipes.  He posed for photos and was quite awesome.  It was a lively dinner and it was a great time had by all.", "business_id": "EDEZNi_8fgQnQK7U98pCeA", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-01-14", "type": "review"}

There is a great selection of freshly squeezed fruit juices and Sudanese teas (including spiced black tea and the ubiquitous mint tea). My wife had the mango juice, which was delicious, and I had the mint tea, which was served in the classic tiny glass cup with a giant bowl of sugar, of course.\n\nNow let's get serious here. I'm a self-confessed houmous snob and have tried houmous from Marrakesh to Baghdad. I can honestly say that the houmous in The Nile Valley Cafe was some of the best I've ever had. The falafel was also absolutely first rate.\n\nI had the ful for my mains, and you might not think that a plate full of beans could be that appetising, but it was absolutely delicious.

He disappeared for several minutes to return and inform us that none of the staff *said* they took a bottle with wine left in it but he brought us two glasses as an apology.  It was a nice gesture and was appreciated, though there was something about the way he worded it that sounded as though he didn't believe us but was going to humour us anyway.  \n\nIn any case, by that point we were done being shoved around by the increasing crowds and we left for more relaxed climes.  \n\nIn short - expensive drinks, poor beer selection, heaving, and a mixture of too-eager and slightly off-putting staff.

We arrived at 1pm, an hour before our check in time so we decided to wait in the bar area. There is an extension on the side with a windowed outlook onto the bowling green and tennis courts across the road. The barman greeted us and was very attentive and welcoming and took our orders for food and drink. Food came swiftly and was well presented and delicious. An hour soon passed and we checked into our room, The James Suite.\u00a0\n\nAs you walk in it's a breath taking moment as the room is extremely well presented and very spacious and decorated to a high standard. There is a lovely comfortable leather suite, smart lamps, gorgeous comfy beds and a beautiful bathroom. Our party of 2 adults and 2 children had plenty of space to chill out and relax and do what we wanted.\n\nOur room rate included breakfast and this was absolutely delicious. A full English/Scottish breakfast can be had and lots of fresh coffee and toast as well as cereal etc.\u00a0\n\nThe one thing that really sets itself apart though is it's staff. They are all excellent and welcoming. Nothing is too much trouble and they're happy to advise on local attractions and buses to catch etc if you don't want to pay for parking in the city centre. The bus is only 8-10 minutes to the centre so you're situated in an ideal location.\n\nWe had a 3 night stay and during this time we absolutely loved knowing that at the end of the day we had a beautiful, comfy room to go back to and welcoming staff to help us enjoy our stay.\n\nOn our last day we had a really good chat with the owners and you can tell how much they care about your stay and some of the nicest people you could hope to meet.\n\nI highly recommend staying here especially in The James Suite and advise you to book early.

Otherwise I think that the average diner for whom a restaurant with these price points is an extravagant treat is mainly paying for the maintenance of an extensive wine list you mostly can't afford anyway.

Overall, it was a outstanding and very romantic experience. As we walked down the tiny alleyway to the entrance of the restaurant you can't help feeling slightly whimsical. Our table was reserved in the 'Secret Garden' section of the restaurant. \n\nI do have to agree with Jonas B. below on the bread situation. I had tomato and rosemary focaccia which was good but I think you can expect better at restaurants of this calibre. I had foie gras as my starter - which you don't see on too many menus here. It was heavenly. For my main I had the hot smoked salmon. My partner had a fillet of limousin Scotch beef which included grilled marrow. We were both impressed with our meals. We shared an excellent bottle of Chenin Blanc and creme brulee for dessert.  We were offered complimentary espressos and a latte which came with macaroons and fudge. The macaroons were somewhat stale but the fudge was divine.\n\nI think the restaurant does really well because it presents a really lovely atmosphere and experience. I've been to fine dining restaurants in other cities and there's a magical element to The Witchery that other places lack. I suppose being in the backdrop of the castle helps!\n\nI would love to come back for lunch when there's natural light shining through as the restaurant is fairly dark (this isn't a criticism, I liked it dark). \n\nI found the service excellent - not too inquisitive on how our meal was. Very professional and knowledgeable. \n\nWe finished our meal around 11ish and there were a few tables that were just being seated.

I'm not spoiling anything.  This is not a predictable plot with a Shyamalan-like fifth act twist.  By saying this early, I can make you wet your imaginative appetites (see what I did there) as you contemplate how this place could possibly look better that Inamo or Claridge's. \nThe Witchery matches Claridge's in their dedication to offering a fine dining experience over just good food.  I've been thinking about that, about how I prefer to have a dining experience.  I would never go out \"to get food.\"  \"Let's get something to eat\" would be replaced with \"Let's go out tonight.\"  This is why I haven't eaten fast food in five years.  I go out for the treatment and the experience as much as the food eaten.  As I sat down and took my first glance at the menu, I knew I was in good hands.  Our third water had come down with water after the second had brought the menus.  As the rain fell outside, we enjoyed the warmth of the Witchery.\nAnd then we ordered haggis.\nI know what you were thinking with that statement.  \"...and this was when it went downhill.\"  Haggis has a rather tepid reputation amongst westerners, squarely because of various negative images and connotations.  For me it, it was Highlander, where a French actor playing a Scotsman explains what haggis is to a Scottish actor playing an Egyptian.  When hearing that haggis was sheep's stomach stuffed with meat and barley, the Egyptian played by the Scotsman retorts, \"How revolting!\"\nBut let's analyze what haggis really is.  To do that, you must come face to face with the realization that you've been eating its brother for most of your life. Sausage, it's the same stuff in a different package.  Where haggis employs a stomach, sausage uses intestines.  This process continues today, though most industrial manufacturers have cheapened out and switched to synthetic cases.  So haggis can be looked upon as just a sausage ball.  How much harm could come from that?\nYou're probably thinking the other shoe is going to drop, but no.  The haggis was the first ordered, the first arrived, and was so overwhelming delicious that it sullied all dishes to follow.  The skin gave way the moment you scared it with the fork.  I'm so hooked on haggis now; I could eat it for breakfast, second breakfast, elevensies, luncheon, afternoon tea, dinner, and supper.  It was so good; I'd forgotten to take a photo.  I know; I'm naval lint.  The haggis was 9.50 and a bargain.  From there, we took in the d'Hote Menu, basically what we have been doing nearly everywhere else.  Between meals were offers of bread, the same as Claridge's.  My mother ordered wine to my water, the same as Claridge's.  Three courses were 30 quid.  Does that sound good?  It's less than half than Claridge's, so this place just got an A+ in value.  The actual starter after the haggis was offered as three options.  My mother elected for the grilled Irish oysters, pancetta, spinach, and hollandaise while I had the Tamworth ham hock en gel\u00e9e, piccalilli, with grain mustard mayonnaise.  And you couldn't have a more complicated and more delicious way of saying \"spreadable meat and mayo on bread.\"\nWe both decided the main should be the grilled gigot of new season lamb, rosemary potato cake, with aubergine caviar and tomato jus.  Alas, this is where the Witchery falters.  We must have been missing a point to this because the lamb was almost entirely fat.  It was a nearly inedible minefield of grizzle forcing us both to spit portions back onto plate like we were Gordon Ramsey in a kitchen nightmare.  The sides were good but this meal was ultimately a disappointment... what a shame.  In retrospect, I should have gone for my first choice, the butter-poached potato gnocchi with garden peas, broad beans, ricotta and mint.  The mean was redeemed with organic carrot cake topped with mascarpone ice cream blueberry syrup. \nThe Witchery was sizing up to be the greatest restaurant of the trip.  It did everything else to perfection, from service to d\u00e9cor, to every other dish.  It still gets extremely high praise from me because this one poor dish just wasn't enough to sour the entire experience.  I would definitely return.  I would also say that you won't regret going and should do so, just avoid the lamb.\nFood:  8/10\nService: 10/10\nPresentation:  10/10\nValue:  8/10\nRecommendation:  9.3/10", "business_id": "4dIzmqGAhFIcuHfI8CySig", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-12-20", "type": "review"}

The room is spacious and well decorated as a time piece, but not ostentatiously so. More thought should be given to adding closet space though. It is very clean and comfortable and WARM in these winter months. Complimentary continental breakfast arrives at the moment that was requested; delicious croissants, porridge in iron pots, and creamy yogurt were favorites. \n\nRESTAURANT: We had dinner in the original dining room. We almost did not because of some of the less than positive comments in other Yelp reviews. I'm glad we did, though, because it was as if those disappointed yelpers had dined somewhere else.\n\nSimply put, our dinner at The Witchery was one of the finest meals we've had anywhere. The room is well appointed, mysteriously quiet and candlelit. The service was comfortably impeccable. The lamb Wellington (served for two) was the tenderest of meats I've ever had, and deliciously prepared. The duck was equally tender and flavourful. The sides of whipped potatoes, ratatouille were sublime.

I must say for all its classiness, I did feel extremely out of place when I said no to wine to have not been offered any other alternative! \n\nAfter a hesitation I then became very embarrassed to ask for which beers they served, if any at all (yes I did think that!), I am just very surprised that they didn't offer an alternative when I said no to the wine menu.

Unfortunately, they have.  \n\nI ordered the steak tartare as the starter.  Presentation was great but I thought it lacked seasoning.  Of all the steak tartare I have eaten so far in Edinburgh, this has by far the least ingredients and seasoning.  I also felt it was a bit dry too.  This was priced at \u00a312.50 and I do think that you can get a better steak tartare starter elsewhere for a cheaper price.\n\nI had the Seabass as the main.  I have a picture and if you see the size of the fish, it is just too small to justify its price at \u00a328.  The presentation - great but again taste was very bland. The fish was also not de-scaled properly and from the picture you can see 2 scales still left on the skin of the fish.  I eat a lot of fish and from the smell and taste, the fish was not that fresh at all.  I have been to its sister restaurant at The Tower and you get a whole seabass for the same price and it was the best seabass with brown shrimp I have ever eaten in Edinburgh.  This is just a plain rip off.\n\nCreme Brulee as the dessert priced at \u00a37.50.  From my picture, the portion is great and worth it but unfortunately, it came out as thick custard and not a consistency of a real creme brulee.  One of the lowest ranked creme brulee in Edinburgh for me.  The highlight of the whole experience for me was the mango sorbet that came together with the creme brulee.  However, the creme brulee was not sweet enough that when you return to eating the creme brulee, it just tasted even more bland.\n\nUnfortunately, I have to rate this well known restaurant 2 stars - one star for ambiance and another for its service.  Sure, if you want to pay for the decor, ambiance and service this is the place to be to impress.  However, the quality of food and certainly its value for money has failed to impress me.

Turns out by the time we got there, we had something to celebrate! After Belfast we were in London where my boyfriend proposed. So our celebration dinner was at The Witchery. It was, by far, the fanciest restaurant I've ever been too. The wine list was crazy long so they also had a wide price range too. We had the wood partridge as an appetizer, how can you not when it said to take care when eating as it's wild game and may have shot still in it! It was definitely good. For our entrees we had the Scottish Salmon and the duck. All excellent. The only negative thing - and this is not their fault of course - the place is small with tight quarters and for the bulk of our meal there was a mom with her two kids (American I embarrassingly admit) and the daughter talked SO LOUD about everything that was going on with their life.

The menu says that there is a cream sauce, but there was definitely no sauce on this, just melted cheese on top, however I thought it was delicious, although there could have been more chorizo in the enchilada.
