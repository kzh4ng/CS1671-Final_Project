Somehow they manage to smother nachos with delicious shredded beef, cheese, jalape\u00f1os, and other kinds of yummy-ness, without the nachos getting overwhelmed or overly soggy.    \n\nEat at Atria's.

This was my second supremely dissapointing Primanti's experience in nearly a decade of living in this fine little city.  I guess the fascination with this place must be that it it 1. has a bar 2. you don't have to order a side of fries or coleslaw because it's all gonna be slathered on your sandwich.  Bleh!  On my first Primanti experience, I ordered a corned beef sandwich as it shoud be, no fries or coleslaw on it.  So I was served 2 slices of bread and about 1.5 slices of corned beef.  What a rip off.  2nd experience, today, equally as awful.  But as i said... waitstaff was great.  I ordered a \"Pitts-burger\" with coleslaw and fries on the side.  Seriously, the quality of the burger I was served made 7-11 mini mart burgers seem gourmet.  I guess you really see what their overpriced, crappy sandwiches are truly made of when you strip off the fries & coleslaw.  Their fries are also soggy and gross.  Not a whole lot goin' on here except for cutie/attentive waitresses.  \n\nIf you want a decent, GIANT-sized sandwich and a real PGH experience, go to Peppi's.", "business_id": "NeUf9FyCCIN4MEseNyqkXQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-02-17", "type": "review"}

Their sandwiches were always tasty, worth the wait and the trouble of finding parking etc. So, when my parents came to visit, and we made a trip out that-a-way, I knew that would be a lunch stop. We ended up coming into Pittsburgh on Sunday around 1pm. I knew it would be crowded and anticipated having a wait. We got a table after 15 to 20 minutes and quickly sat down before someone else did. It took the waitress about 10 minutes to come and clear the previous customers remnants, which was ok. \n\nWe ordered our beers and were told that she'd come back and take our order. She came back 20 minutes later, with the beers and took our order. After that, we sat around and waited for our sandwiches for 35 minutes. When we did finally get our food, it was ice cold. The fries in the sandwich were completely soggy and cold, and the meat was barely warm. Our table ran out of napkins, and we asked for some, but they never came, finally, the table next to ours handed us a few. Maybe it was because it was cold, but the sandwiches weren't that great. I had very little meat in mine, and more coleslaw that anything else. Also, the thickness of the bread seems to have increased since I last ate here because about 60% of my sandwich was bread. We were fairly disgruntled about the whole thing, but were still going to leave a tip for the waitress. \n\nThen, my dad went to the bar to pay. He stood there for 10 minutes, behind another customer. The server came up to them and said 'what the hell are you doing up here?', in those words!! My dad was so stunned be just stood there, the guy in line ahead of him told her that he was waiting to pay his bill, so she cashed him out and then turned around to do something else, when my dad said 'excuse me, i need to pay too', she replied to him ' Jeez, you guys are so demanding! Why the hell are you in such a hurry\". That is when their tip went straight out the door with us. \n\nWe were ok waiting for a table, we were even ok waiting for our food; it took them one hour from the time we sat down, to the time we got our food, and then the server had the audacity to behave in that manner.

We found Zorba's on the corner and considering how cold it was neither of us felt like walking to search for food.  \n\nWe stumbled in here after reading the outdoor menu mentioning specials. The hubby  ordered the buffalo chicken salad which is the special on Wednesdays. I went with the gyro salad which came with a side of pita bread.

At first I thought they were a little scant on the lamb meat but  almost like the loaves of bread that Jesus fed to the hungry, it just kept showing up.

I hate those big crunchy chunks that you find close the root, they are so bitter no matter how much dressing you use. \n\nSo the reason I give this place only 3 stars is because of my salad. Crunchy bitter lettuce, gyro meat was a luke warm instead of hot which after 5 minutes made it cold because of the chilled dressing.

Two (yes, two) flaky, buttery whitefish fillets generously coated in a cornmeal-based batter and fried to golden, crispy perfection.  The sandwich barely qualifies as such, as it wears its bun like a hat.  I would note that tartar sauce if pretty much obligatory since the fish, while firm and flavorful, is naturally a bit dry.  I would recommend two people and an allotted half-hour naptime to conquer the large.

Matt suggested the Sandwich Shop with a description of a \"quiet, low key, good food atmosphere\" which was much preferable of any other options at that early hour. So naturally, we are hungry after escaping the hipsters of Remedy we are down for some regular chill.\n\nWe seat ourselves outside to wait out some of the crowd and drink the remainder of our 6 pack of PBR cans [remember we had just come from hipster/lawrenceville] when out of nowhere our simple pleasurable time is disturbed with the outbreak of a 10 person fight! [we got lucky because this is apparently unusual] -- there was even astonishment from the participants [\"REALLY? We are having a fight at the Sandwiche Shoppe????\" - yup pronounced that way]\n\nAnyways, there was much scramble to break up the fight and not stub out eyes with cigarette buds and the chefs did quite a job at driving the trouble makers away. Surprisingly, no cops came checking anything out just drove along liberty ave.\n\nNeedless to say this delayed our now greatly awaited sandwiches which we received for free in the process. [we tipped very well that night] The guy making our food brought us our food and engaged us in a friendly chat for about 15 minutes [much needed to restore his nerves]. Also surprising, we were lucky enough not to be involved in this altercation. \n\nAll together this was a great late night adventure, with dinner AND a show!!!

I had not had a Dominos pizza for a while so I wanted to see if they had improved the quality of their product. I went online to place the order and the process for that was pretty basic and simple. Pretty good site. A large Brooklyn style half extra cheese, half cheese and hamburger for my 8 year old. Also had to try some little chicken/bacon/cheese bites just because. \n\nOk, I've got to tell you, when the \"pizza tracker\" popped up I had to give them credit for making me feel better about waiting.  Very inventive. I placed the order at 5:01 and got a message that at 5:02 Jason had begun making my order. nice Jason. The tracker told me my order was being prepped, then they were firing up my pizza. A little while later when someone yelled, \"Is the pizza here,\" I said, \"No, the pizza tracker says at 5:16 it was finishing baking and Jason was double checking it for perfection.\" Nice.  \n\nThen at 5:25PM. when I'm in the other room watching the playoff game, my computer starting talking to me telling me to be on the lookout for the driver as she, Rachel, had left the store. Oh wait, 5:32PM and Rachel arrived.  That's awesome!! super fast accurate delivery. They crushed everyone else by a long shot.\n\nSo for the important stuff.  How did it taste?. Well out of the gate there is really no way any fast food, mass produced company can really make the best pizza for the prices they sell at so that is just a given for me.  That said, while it is not Vinnies neighborhood pizza from Brooklyn, it is pretty great.  The Brooklyn style was a hand tossed much thinner and much more like a NY style pizza. Not a bready as the normal pizza so a plus in my eyes.  They also slice them in larger slices like un north so one big piece almost has you full.  The extra cheese side was better than the regular cheese and hamburger but overall it was much better than I ever remembered and I will use the online service again.  Their service really crushes everyone else and I've got to say that the quality of the food was every bit as good, if not better, than anything else we could have had.  Nice work Dominos.

Overall I'd recommend Rusty's, but there are better places to eat.  The restaurant is long and narrow and when I came in was very busy.  The ordering system is very convoluted.  You wait in line to order at a window.  The person at the window though was also making sandwiches so there was a wait, about 30 seconds, between each group to order.  The menu board is on the sidewall of the hallway  (parallel to the line) so you can't really see it until you get up to the front of the line to order.  It would have been better to place it above the order window (perpendicular to the line).  And you thought you'd never use geometry after you got out of high school.  Then you head around the corner to the left to another line to get your drinks and place your order again at the cashier and pay.  The layout of the place kind funnels people this way, but why do I have to order twice?  Maybe this is so they can start working on your order and have it ready when you go to pay.  I was lucky to grab a table as I witnessed several parties hovering nearby looking for a place to sit.  If you have more than two people in your party I recommend that after make your first order you send someone to snag  a table while the other goes to pay.  I ordered a cheese steak sandwich and fries.  It took a while to get my food.  You would think they would have started working on it when I first placed my order, but that was not the case.  With the volume of people in the place I anticipated a wait, but it seemed to take longer than it should to get my food.  The cheese steak sandwich was OK, nothing special, but it was hot off the grill.  I should have known not to expect too much when the menu said it came with lettuce, tomato, and mayo.  Toppings that are fine for a burger but that should never be mentioned in the same sentence as a cheese steak.  I left them off of my cheese steak.  The fries on the other hand were great.  They were thick cut, hot & crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.  Overall nothing spectacular, the fries come close, but good hot food.  The tab came to $10.46 for sandwich, fries and drink, which is not too unreasonable.", "business_id": "WkD7OrSIHLzgOQo9wQHu-A", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-01-13", "type": "review"}

So, I ordered the chicken cheesesteak, fries and some coleslaw. This is not authentic if that is what you are looking for. the cheesesteak was soggy. I got mushrooms which were runny. What was more disappointing was that the chicken was like steakums and it was one layer of chicken on top of a glob of mayo, tomatoes, onions and mushrooms. Basically there was no chicken plus it tasted like shoe leather. The fries were ok. Not as crispy as others stated and they needed SALT! I didn't eat them all because they got cold and kind of gross.  The coleslaw was full of mayo, so I didn't eat all of that either.

It was cooked perfectly. thick cut and cooked to crispy but not burnt. Soup was good as well.  Well seasoned and a thick soup as a creamed soup should be. There are definitely other things on this menu that I would like to try. I will say that the 5-10 customers behind me had one of two sandwiches, a phillysteak of some sort or the meatball sandwich.

Sorry... the lamb did not look appetizing.  It look liked dried processed meat.  Reminds me of the movie \"Bridesmaids\", LOL.  I ordered the seafood platter and I knew it was fried but I didn't experience the sea-smell so I was quite confident that that the fish was not spoiled.  I believe the fish was flounder but it was quite thin - well, actually VERY thin.  At least they didn't overcook it.  And baby shrimp.  OK, I'll accept it.  But I would have been more impressed if the shrimp was larger.  Coleslaw was questionable... not sure how old it was... the mayo seemed kinda \"sticky\".  Husband ordered the tenderloin dinner.  We were advised that it was not beef but pork.  I recommend that they specify that on the menu.

I didn't want to eat any of the other chain garbage that all the other tourists were eating near the hotel. Enter NOTO. What an awesome little find!\n\nAfter reading some of the reviews, I wanted to try a little bit of everything. The woman at the counter suggested we try the Mardi Gras Combo and the popular Shrimp Po' Boy sandwich. I wanted to try the dirty rice and was told that I could substitute the regular rice in the Combo for dirty rice. Yes, please!\n\nFirst, I'd like to clarify that the sandwich is NOT as big as other reviews may make it out to be. It's a standard French roll with a standard amount of fillings BUT the flavors are admittedly some of the best I've ever had. The juxtaposition of creamy, tangy sauce with the crunchy, juicy shrimp combined with the fresh lettuce will have you swooning for more.\n\nOn to the combo... What a cornucopia (nods to Candice G.) of beautifully tasty french creole goodness all nestled magically in compartmentalized order without any compartments in the take-out box. It traveled several miles successfully in the manner as well. The warnings of the menu and lady at the counter on the spiciness of the dirty rice and shrimp creole were accurate. It was a flavorful, creeping sort of spice that increased with each bite. Absolutely fantastic.\n\nThe name \"take-out\" is rather misleading because there is ample seating inside the place and many interesting jazz memorabilia to peruse over while eating so eat-in instead of taking-out as the name suggests.\n\nI'll definitely be making a stop here again whenever I'm in the Madison area for some good ol' N'Orleans style cookin'.", "business_id": "cpGv6ES2hzPCtCUQgipwXw", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-01-08", "type": "review"}

Anyway, it was the experience we were looking for, and my wife had been here before. \nWell, we started off with a brand new waitress, nice girl, but zip on the training, than a girl with three months experience came out, again, no training. Both of these girls would seem happier in a less than Victorian life. We asked about teas and blends, but had no assistance. They only offered a couple and you had to share the pot! What is the deal with that - for $19 bucks a pop I wanted my own pot of earl grey while my wife sipped on apricot! \nWell, one waitress was quitting that day and decided to slam her boss over and over again to us, we were about to leave when the owner came out - we said it was not the experience we were looking for, she apologized and the service got slightly better. Where were the tea cups - we had punch glasses and cracked porcelain with stains. No plates at first, the tea was nothing to write home about. \nMy daughters tea was ok, the cookie was boring, artless and lacking in any frosting or style. The finger sandwiches were pretty good - not quite British, more like deli style, but tasty. The scones a bit dry and the jam, maybe WalMart strawberry.  The worst was the dessert. COSTCO SPECIAL! Little dainties of mini eclairs and mini cheesecake squares still frozen with some Rheddi Whip Cream on the side. My six year old loved as she has a dairy intolerance and took an enzyme and she got to splurge. All of this with the griping trainer and the poor helpless trainee for 19 bucks a person. What else could you ask for? A REFUND - which the owner graciously gave us. The place has potential - but needs to work out the kinks, up the presentation, get a better scone recipe, take some time to learn about teas and train their staff, and YES - learn to bake desserts! A 3 tiered plate for presentation and some real tea cups would be nice too! Sorry TEETER house - my Christmas special was a bomb - the best part of it was I did not have to pay for it.", "business_id": "gBcpDl0quCLABsg5OuSFww", "stars": 1, "date": "2008-12-20", "type": "review"}

It feels like a dining hall inside or even like a dark corridor with six-tops scattered throughout.

For 2 people to have lunch, I though $19 was a little steep, but we tried to stay optimistic as we found a place to sit. The environment was great- roomy, clean, bright, colorful.

I probably should have said something, but instead just went up and asked for a fork and a knife. \nFlavors were good, nothing special.

Before I became a chicken salad fanatic, I had tried their gyros and hamburgers. Fan of Feta? This is your place. I ordered the Feta Burger once... once. The patty was obviously from a frozen pack of processed burgers that one could easily buy at Costco, but that's not a major gripe.

The tiropita is tasty as well, but without the addition of spinach it's a bit too rich. For a \"Greek\" restaurant, there is a varied selection of food. Reubens and patty melts, french fries and fresh fruit. Of course, a staple of any great Greek place; baklava. My colleagues and I ordered so much food from Athenian Express over the last year that they recently gave us an entire tray of baklava as a thank you and an invite to their employee Christmas party.

I was soured on anything that Chris Bianco could come up with after the absolute pain in the ass it was to eat at Pizzeria Bianco. However, aside from the pain in the ass parking, them not taking reservations, being herded into his cramped almost non-air conditioned bar for overpriced drinks for hours, then being made to sit at the bar instead of a table; the food was very good. NOT worth the hassle, NOT worth the time, NOT worth the money. The man does know how to cook though. The grilled vegetable platter and pizzas are amazing.\n\nHowever, this is not about his pizza joint. This is about his sandwich joint. Pane Bianco is in a tiny building attached to a trendy coffee shop (shocker) and needless to say the parking situation is horrible (another shocker). The menu is very limited with only 4 sandwiches and 2 salads. And don't even think about ordering a regular water or soda because there is none to be found. You will be stuck with a bottle of designer water and the same for the soda. Anyway, after receiving our meals we opted out of sitting at one of their many community picnic tables due to overcrowding and ate in the car. There is of course no seating in the actual restaurant and the coffee house next door was filled as well. But in his defense it does say \"take out only\" on the website.\n\nOur party of 3 each ordered one of their sandwiches. The market (I forget the name), Mozzarella, and Soppressata. They were all excellent and very tasty. The bread he uses is fresh, hand-made and some of the best I've had. Everything was about $30 so it was a bit pricey for 3 sandwiches and a water, but I guess that is the price you pay to have one of Chris Bianco's creations.\n\nI can honestly say that the food was top notch, but the only way I will eat food from one of Chris Bianco's restaurants again is if somebody went and got it for me.", "business_id": "-AAig9FG0s8gYE4f8GfowQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-02-04", "type": "review"}

My primary interest here is getting Bianco pizzas to go.  The menu has 4 of the 6 pizzas that are featured at Pizzeria Bianco plus a market pizza.  In my previous review I had expressed severe displeasure with the fact that although they do carryout orders they will not take orders over the phone.  I think that is a flaw, and should at least be better communicated.  \n\nAnyway, this time I called in advance and found out what the market pizza was (smoked mozzarella and sopresata), and asked them what the typical wait time was.  I was told about 10 minutes, which seems very reasonable.  I drove over there (it is only about 2.5 miles from my house) and put in my order for a Magherita and a Rosa.  There was some in-door seating available (it was a bit too cold to wait at the outside tables) so I sat and waited.  Chris Bianco came by and we had a nice chat.  My pizzas were indeed ready in less than 10 minutes.  I actually lost a couple of minutes when they failed to notice that they were to-go orders and put them out for table delivery.  They were a little colder than they should have been because of this, but the new setup (with seating in the part where Lux once was) was only in its first week, so I ave them the benefit of the doubt.  The pizza was wonderful, I had just partaken of a Rosa at Pizzeria Bianco about 3 weeks earlier and could not see any difference.\n\nI am withholding one star due to the phone order issue and the screwup on the to-go order, but this is the deal:\n\nPizzeria Bianco has what the NY Times claimed to be among the best pizzas in the country.  You have to wait an hour or two for a table.\n\nPane Bianco has the same pizza, and you can have one, either to eat in or take out, in about 10 minutes.", "business_id": "-AAig9FG0s8gYE4f8GfowQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-12-07", "type": "review"}

We like to sit outside, weather permitting - which really people, we live in Phoenix, so that's almost always - and slurp Coke from the bottle.\n\nI was a little disappointed with my experience today, although I am sure it was somewhat tempered by the fact that I wasn't accompanied by my man, but was instead grabbing food to go for us.  Apparently you can call in to go orders, which I didn't know, but numerous people cut in front of the long line by simply saying \"I called in my order.\"  Well, excuse me!  The long lonely line is one thing, but the kicker was the tuna salad that didn't have olives as advertised and the bean/veggie soup that really wasn't anything to write home about - it lacked salt for sure.\n\nThe girl in front of me wanted to order pizza and was told you can only order pizza at dinner time.  She was pissed and really, I can't blame her because we stood in line a long time.  But sweetie, really, go to Pizzeria Bianco if you want their pizza.  (PS: We ate there for dinner last night and I will post a separate review...I guess the holidays bring out my Bianco cravings...)\n\nAs I'm re-reading this, I realize it kinda sounds negative.  Which really doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things because this place is hugely popular and will continue to be I'm sure.\n\nTake away: yummy sandwiches, not cheap but that doesn't bother me if the quality is there - and it is.  Go early or a little later to avoid the lunch rush and enjoy!", "business_id": "-AAig9FG0s8gYE4f8GfowQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-12-15", "type": "review"}

I expected a slightly tomato broth with lots of garlic and firm beans with small pasta-more like a soup-what I got was a bland plate of rigatoni with mashed beans. No parmesan even to round out the dish.\nI think Pane Bianco has some growing pains before it reaches a stellar status and I am confident it will.

Since the last time we were here, they added a cool full service eat-in dining room where the cafe next door used to be. \n\nOn this visit I had the Market Sandwich which this time was an Egg Fritata with spicy sopresota, manchego, tomato, greens and onion.  I actually thought the locally grown tomatoes were the star - much beefier and tastier than the grocery store tomatoes we get at home. I wanted more sopresota, but I got my fix with a piece of my sister-in-law's sopresota sandwich with aged provolone and wood-roasted onions. This is my favorite sandwich on the menu, which I ordered myself the last time we were at Pane Bianco. According to our server, the most popular sandwich is the mozzarella, followed by the sopresota.  I'd put all of these sandwiches up against any of the best sandwiches served anywhere.  Our kiddos loved the focaccia as well. \n\nThey bake the awesome round bread in the wood-burning hearth you see when you walk in, they make and smoke the mozzarella on the premises and the veggies are locally sourced as well.

And it's been there for 60 years!!!  I'm slackin' in my mom & pop shop dex duties!  \n\nHad to run some errands in the area so I Yelped sandwich shops looking for one I had never been to before and came across this one.  I looked at their menu and immediately saw a bunch of items that appealed to me.  I still couldn't believe I had never seen this before, especially since I'm sooooo in love with Cheese!\n\nThe poor people behind the counter must have thought I was nuts!  I get the impression they are used to people knowing what they want when they walk in the door rather than having me stare at the menu for a good 10 minutes, again.  To my credit, the only lunch meat I ate growing up was a slice of bologna once a year and I've eaten the same Subway sandwich for 20 years so this whole deli thing is new to me.  I asked about a number of sandwiches and they were very helpful in answering all my questions.  \"You can have that hot or cold\".  \"Sourdough or rye\".\n\nI settled on  a chicken salad sandwich, surprisingly.  I usually shy away from \"salad\" sandwiches because most places use too much mayo, or there's funky ingredients like walnuts or raisins or grapes.  I was feeling mighty brave today I guess.  The sandwich was AWESOME!  Great flavor and not drowning in goo.  They have a huge selection of chips or you can try their homemade potato or macaroni salad.  \n\nI can't wait to bring the hubby back for him to try.", "business_id": "UWrB5H3G-hhiHMy3iKV2ew", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-02-02", "type": "review"}

I want to eat as many of them as possible from as many different places as I can.  And let me tell you, there is just something about the sandwiches from Cheese 'n Stuff.\n\nIt's not big on atmosphere.  There's a deli counter and then a few picnic tables with plastic tableclothes, some shelves stocking Swedish foodstuffs for sale as well as the store's backstock of chips, soda and paper towels.  They usually have some cheesy holiday decorations out.  It's cramped and not that pleasant.  I usually get my lunches to go.\n\nTheir sandwich menu consists of about a million pages printed out from an inkjet printer and taped to the wall, along with some hokey signs that say things like \"Today's Special: So's Tomorrow.\"  There's nothing slick or pretentious about it.  It's obviously just a shop owned by some guy and his wife and daughter.\n\nSo yeah.  The sandwiches.  I'm a vegetarian, and they have a simple yet elegant veggie sandwich that I find myself craving a lot.  It has cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, avocados, and some kind of dressing.  I get it on a wheat sub roll.  Not fancy, but oh-so-tasty.  I wish they had more veggie options, but this one satisfies me.\n\nI bring friends who eat meat here so I can tell them to order the Doughboy and enjoy it vicariously.  Their deli meat is high quality and there are loads of options.  It looks like the sort of place my grandpa would love and I want to bring him there some day.  No one I've brought in has been disappointed.\n\nThe sides are delicious.  I am a fan of the macaroni salad and the pasta salad that has the olives and italian dressing.  If I'm feeling indulgent, I'll get a brownie, a piece of cheesecake, or an ice-cold sarsaparilla.\n\nThe lack of atmosphere doesn't bother me; my one gripe with this place is how early they close.  There have been many times I haven't gotten moving early enough and haven't been able to get there before they close, which is 4 PM.  Those times I do get my rear in gear and errands all finished before 4, I do love to treat myself to Cheese 'n Stuff.

I was surprised my hubby liked it, because he doesn't usually like anything with raisins.\n\nTo me, this is my comfort food.  It reminds me of my family back east, and I'm so glad my husband has embraced it like he has.\n\nThis was actually the 2nd time we've been here, and both times have been successes.

I've been wanting to try Scott's for years. I love deli, and I was very disappointed by the food, service and overall experience I had at Scott's today. \n\nDuring the end of the lunch rush Scott's was empty. That should have been a sign. The restaurant was filthy. The temperature was hot and sticky despite having the the door open (it was about 72 in phoenix today.)\n\nThe booths had exposed cushioning, tables hadn't been cleared or cleaned and the floor looked like something that belonged in an episode of kitchen nightmares. Ignoring these details was a poor choice on my part. \n\nMy friend and I finally found a clean-ish booth and sat down. Our table was dirty, and when the waitress came by I had to ask her to wipe it off even though there were visible crumbs and our menus were sticky. She acted like it had never occurred to her to clean a table off before. She actually tilted her head when I asked her to do so, as if she had been confused by the request. We should have just left. \n\nWe ordered our food. I got a pathetic bowl of matzo ball soup, my friend a sad looking chicken noodle. I had one very tiny measly looking matzo ball, and the veggies had been cooked to death. There were chicken bones in my soup. The flavor tasted like it had been seasoned with a generic version of Stouffer's dressing mix. \n\nI ordered a lean pastrami and asked for it to go. It came to our table without fries  accompanied by the saddest, wilted coleslaw. It was not prepared to go. The pastrami was fatty (despite the menu bragging about how they don't charge extra for lean) The pickles were great, and house made. The pickles were the only bright spot of the meal. \n\nMy friend asked if they had soda by the bottle, the waitress forgot that they carried Dr Brown's (a deli staple) and I had to jog her memory. She forgot the request twice and after being reminded twice she finally brought the soda.\n\nBy this point I was so over it I just wanted to leave. I asked for a box, she over charged us, I didn't give a flying fig about that and over paid just to be able to leave. \n\nSix hours later my stomach is upset. I won't be returning. I may be calling the health inspector.

Mine was 8 or 9 bucks for a 4oz side and a sandwich. \n\nMy cousin got the ham w/ spinach and some kind of mayo. She said it was good. And her friend got the sandwich with the genoa salami, she also said it wast tasty.\n\nTheres plently of seating outside, a little cubby to the side of the stairs, and apparently seating upstairs as well.\n\nWhen I am in town again I want to return to try another yumfest sandwich.

Side options, so many to choose from and not just the normal potato salad or pasta salad. They have those too, but sides like cottage cheese with herbs, southwestern salad, egg salad and more\n\n4. Bread, meat, spreads and cheese selections too - I haven't tried all of them, but they all look delicious\n\n5. The gift store... I'm always looking for a place to bring out of town visitors and this will be one of them. Its an airy building with cute items and some would be useful around the house too\n\n6. All of the seating options, upstairs, downstairs, in the wine bar area, outside with live music, even midway on the stairs\n\n7. Friendly service from the people taking our food order to the bartender taking our drinks\n\n8. Live music in the courtyard area, such peaceful music that is not blaring loud. I can hear myself talk and enjoy the music too\n\n9. That its next to Copenhagen Furniture. Yeah... most wouldn't care, but give me a break, I'm looking for furniture.\n\n10. Half size options. I still take half of my meal home, but at least I'm not eating multiple meals of it.  \n\nI haven't tried the coffee or their breakfast, but I'm sure its good too.

It was a place where we got to spend time together and bond, which was rare because as an  OB/GYN, my dad was frequently on call and at work. \n\nI was pleased to recently find out that after all of these years, Duck and Decanter has not lost its honey feel, warm ambiance, and quality of their food. \n\nThis June, I took my dad there for Father's Day lunch. The sandwiches were as good as I remember. Nothing extravagant or peculiar, just classic sandwiches. Fresh breads, crispy lettuce, vine ripened tomatoes (among other things) and yummy mayonnaise. Not to mention their meat is very high quality and fresh-- all still at the amazing quality I remember as a young girl- fantastic. \n\nThe staff is nice, helpful and super friendly. They give the place a warm feel to it. \n\nWhile you're there, make sure to shop around a bit, as they do have quite a few little trinkets and specialty food items like hot sauces, chocolates, and jams. All of their items are fairly moderately priced as well. \n\nTo eat, you can either go upstairs to their loft area, sit on their tucked away yet lively patio, or in the lobby area of the restaurant.

Lush grass, big and plenty deciduous trees to provide plenty of shade and make that cool sound when a breeze comes through. It is very simple and tranquil to dine at.

After showing them around town on Sunday, Dec. 29th we were all hungry around 1pm. With the numerous dining options in Central Phoenix we decided to go to the Duck and Decanter on E. Camelback.  Friends in town have been raving about that place for years and now this was our opportunity to try it and show our friends a good time.  We arrived last Sunday a little after 1pm.  Outside was very busy but managed to find a an empty table for the four of us.  I decided to wait at the table to save it as it was the last one available. The others went inside to place our orders. My first impression was. Not good. There was no landscaping, vegetation or flowers. Felt like we were sitting on a concrete slab in the shopping center parking lot.  Also looked a bit trashy with several dirty tables left unattended. Ambiance a big Zero.  After about 25 mins of waiting outside at the table the rest of my party came out with brown paper bags and drink cups.  In that amount of time we could of had a fabulous sit down and served lunch at one of the many great caf\u00e9s in the neighborhood. They said it was busy ordering the food and only two persons working behind the line taking orders.  On a busy Sunday afternoon this is unacceptable. I ordered a BLT on sourdough bread with a side of coleslaw.  For almost $8.00 per sandwich they could afford to be a little less chinsy with them. The sourdough bread was just cheap white bread that you can buy at the grocery for 99 cents per loaf.  There were exactly 2 slices of over cooked bacon with a piece of brown wilted lettuce on mayo.  The only ingredient they were generous with was the whole tomato that was sliced and piled on the sandwich to make it appear that it was a heartier sandwich.  I didn't order a big fat tomato and mayo sandwich. Shame on you Duck and Decenter.  My side of coleslaw was practically inedible.  Coleslaw swimming in watered down slaw sauce (more like mayonnaise and warm milk) was not at all tasty.  Another person in my party ordered an over priced spinach salad with barely any spinach.  She never told them when ordering yo hold the spinach. Really people!!!! Also she had to wait another 25 mins to get her ice tea because she was told that they had run out. Couldn't they have told her when she ordered it and let her make a different drink choice.  While eating our less than acceptable meal a man was playing the guitar and singing.  He sounded okay but his volume was way way to loud. We literally could not even coo in ate with each other being at least 50 feet away from him.  This total experience at the Duck and Decanter left a bitter taste in my mouth and not just from the awful food. We will never be back.

They liked their pizza, minestrone and garlic bread knot thingies.  The girls got kids sized spaghetti and meatball, a coloring paper menu and crayons.

You'd think that would  be so they knew which table to bring the food to, but this wasn't the case.  The lady who brought our pizza out, just stood there, confused, she looked over the dining room, turned back around and went back into the kitchen... then she came back out, looked at all the tables and diners again, then went back to the kitchen still holding our plates.  I could see that she asked someone which table the order belonged to, twice! and when she came back out the third time, she started asking random tables if it was their order, I called to her and asked if they were with the toppings we'd ordered, and she said yes.  The place was busy, but not crazy busy.\nPerhaps it was just an off day for the server or maybe she was new, but what was the point of giving me the number if they weren't even going to use it?", "business_id": "TqHTtjPANCBKGsjGBjDoQQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-01-18", "type": "review"}

We hadn't been since the remodel and we were very shocked at how nice the dining area looks now. We had rarely eaten at the restaurant previously because it felt too cramped, but now it's definitely a lot more open and inviting. Since it was a nice day, we sat outside which was also very nice. Our table wobbled quite a bit but our served fixed that quickly. The only negative about sitting outside was there was a man who kept comimg outside to smoke, even though it cleary says no smoking all throughout the patio. We were not affected since we were far enough away, but other tables asked to be moved inside due to his smoking. I was surprised that none of the employees said something to him. Makes me wonder if he was also an employee. \n\nWhen we order take-out we normally get the Brooklyn, which is our favorite.  A 16\" is normally a good size for the three of us. This night we decided to order our own 8\" pizzas. My husband did the brooklyn, I got the chicken pesto, and my son got the cheese.  If you're hungry get a larger pizza. The singe pizzas are very small. For me, it was perfect, but my husband was still pretty hungry at the end of the night. If you have a bigger appetite I definitely reccomend ordering a larger size. Overall the flavor was very good on all three.\n\nDrinks, I ordered their locally brewed Phoenix St. ale and it was very good! my husband had a mojito which was too sweet. We had a coupon for two free cannolis. They were less than impressive and I was very happy they were free.\n\nOverall NYPD is one of our go to restaurants for pizza and if you stay away from the mojitos and cannolis, you will not be dissapointed.", "business_id": "TqHTtjPANCBKGsjGBjDoQQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-02-17", "type": "review"}

I despise everything about you, Miracle Mile.\n\nUnless someone had cued me into the fact, I never would have guessed that you were trying so hard to duplicate NY deli-style fare. Why so? Because every NY staple I've tried from your fetid excuse for a deli has sucked so effing hard it just about pulls grey matter out through my ears. \n\nStale and mealy defrosted cheesecake that was as unappetizing to look at as to consume. Matzo ball soup so bland I had to keep looking down to assure myself I was indeed consuming something other than hot air. Wilted salads guaranteed to deflate my hopes upon first bite. Vegetable soup that was so flavorless as to be nearly nonexistent. Are you trying that hard to fade into the background, you wallflower? It's no wonder the median age of a patron in your restaurant is pushing 80. The near total annihilation of my taste buds is the only way I would ever step foot through your doors again.\n\nAnd then there's your pathetic excuse for a sandwich, Mile. Pastrami and corned beef sandwiches piled (not so) high with bland, fatty meat that's been slopped with reckless abandon atop your choice of bread, guaranteed to disintegrate in five seconds flat. All topped off with a slice of sweaty Swiss cheese that adds zero flavor and flops listlessly atop a piteous excuse for a sandwich. If it weren't for the spicy mustard at each table, I'd hardly have tasted anything at all! Bravo! You surely deserve an award for the most poorly constructed sandwich in all of Phoenix! \n\nAlthough I guess that dubious honor should clearly be bestowed upon your brusque, monosyllabic cafeteria line workers. \"Next? Bread?\" Unappetizing slop of meat, slid down the line to the next guy. \"Fries?\" Heap of fried garbage, liberally applied, slid down the line. That is, unless you're asking for something outside of the crap-sandwich-and-fries box. At that point your request will be wordlessly acquiesced to with a scowl and a slop. \"Drink?\" No! Please! NO! Just get me out of this slovenly pit of cafeteria hell. What do you want, I'll pay anything! Anything!\n\nWait a tic. That's your whole ploy all along, isn't it Miracle Mile? Brainwash the masses with mediocre food and overcharge for everything to make it seem like it's a privilege to be dining upon such slop.\n\nWell I'm on to you. I've given you plenty of chances, Mile.

Armed with a menu, I called down to place a \"to go\" order.  You can't begin to imagine my delight when the guy answered the phone in a French accent so thick it was hard to understand.  I placed my order for the \"half sandwich and side\" deal (extremely reasonable at $5.60) and ran down to get it.  I ordered the mozzarella sandwich minus the prosciutto, and the pasta salad for the side.  Regular readers may know that in my opinion, nothing beats a good mozzarella sandwich, so I was absolutely thrilled to find that it was delicious.  Nice crunchy baguette, fresh mozzarella, and flavorful tomatoes.  The pasta salad was also very good... very simple, just cold pasta with some olive oil and seasonings.  I'm not a super adventurous eater, so while I loved the pasta salad I would guess that others might find it a tad boring.\n\nToday I had the tomato basil ravioli soup, which was very good except that it was a little skimpy on the raviolis.  Flavor was delicious, though.  It comes with a few toasted slices of baguette.  Personally, next time I'll just order a fresh baguette to go along with it.\n\nThe entrees and full sandwiches are a little more pricey, but I'm a light eater, so the half sandwich/side deal is an absolute steal for me.

The wife ordered the Weekend special only to find they were out of that too? It's the Weekend special on Friday! She settled on salad and Beef Borguignon. The salad was wilted and the dressing was so mild it was hard to tell what it was. My best guess was a quarter-teaspoon of Grey Poupon and 2 oz. of olive oil. Soon my sandwich arrived and it was a slice of lunch-meat and a half slice of Swiss on a grocery store sesame-seed hamburger bun. At that point I was done, I sent it back and asked for the bill. The Chef / Owner had the nerve to come out and ask what was wrong with my sandwich! No joke, a grocery store hamburger bun, smashed flat in a Panini iron, and he is wondering why i didn't want it?

They have a wide selection of food and everything at least USED TO BE great. Seems to be a few months ago something changed... Delivery now takes forever, orders are wrong, customer service is nonexistent, the wings contain little meat now, and no managers to be found. \n\nThe way they've changed their business makes me regret that I had my whole office ordering from them. Granted if you order a cheese steak sandwich, it could be confused with cheese sticks. That's why an order taker should repeat your order back to you. \n\nLast time I had a problem with them was the first time I've ever had a problem. I was hoping it was a one time thing. The manager at the time rectified it with fixing my order and offering me 20% off my next order. Good deal. Even though I had to wait 2+ hours to receive the wrong order, I try to be understanding. \n\nThis time there was no rectification, not even a call returned. I had to wait over an hour for my food when I was quoted 30 minutes. When I called to find out where it was, I was told they were busy. When the delivery driver had to inform me they were out of something (the reason I ordered from them in the first place) AND the order was wrong, I was hungry and cranky to say the least. I called back in to speak to the manager because they gave me an appetizer instead of a sandwich, he was conveniently not there. The order-taker offered to make me a sandwich and deliver it to me personally. I was satisfied with that. To my dissatisfaction, he called me five minutes later with another excuse that it was the end of the night and they had turned off the machines. It's obvious lack of management when a business is open for 15 more minutes and should be taking orders in that time to maintain profitability. So lazy employees decide to take off early. \n\nHopefully they will change back to the way things used to be and I can order in confidence once more. Until then, if you order from them - pick it up so you know if it's wrong right away and you don't have to wait at least twice of the quoted time. If you order delivery, I suggest ordering the exact opposite of what you want. This way, they might get something right. \n\nWhy, Frank's?

I thought they had the best bagels in the world.  I thought it was sooo cool that I could get a salad and a coffee drink at the same time.  The one that was between my house and my mall had this awesome big solid wood table that could sit 6 easily and it was my favorite thing in the world to hang out at that table w/ my bagel, random coffee drink and the newspaper spread all over the place.  \n\nHere's the thing.  I didn't know any better.  I wasn't wrong to like what I liked - but I was wrong to think they were quite as great as they were.  What did I know about independent coffee shops?  I should have realized that the black and white photos all over the place were just as corporate as the faux-antique newspaper crap all over the inside of the neighborhood Subway.  But they were in frames and somehow that made them different.  \n\nAs I've gone new places and tried new things, I've still occasionally eaten at an Einsteins.  Folks bring bagels into the office.  I'm looking for a better than drive through salad in a hurry and it's nearby.  And it's never been \"bad\".  Problem is, it hadn't been really great either.  It's fine.  It totally gives you what you order.  But nothing more.  \n\nI went to one recently and found that it's menu had again almost completely changed since I'd been in last.  I ordered a chicken sandwich and an iced tea.  I chose a Caesar salad as my side.  Salad = 1/1/2 stars.   Not good. Sandwich was 3 stars.  Totally just ok and nothing more.  Interesting flavor - but quickly forgettable.  I do like their green tea.  But for almost $9 for a sandwich and an iced tea I found myself thinking about how much better I could have done.  \n\nBagels for the office - fine.  Go for it.  They'll even pre-cut them which I think is a great option.  And they almost always have my fav (pumpernickel) available which gives them bonus points.  But for lunch?

I love the fact that the have at least 20+ unique combinations (or you can make your own) and that every sandwich comes with freshly baked chocolate chip cookie! It's just delightful! My favorite combination is the turkey sandwich with cheese, sprouts and stuffing! Probably defeats the healthy factor of ordering a turkey sandwich in the first place but well worth it! They also have a great Thai noodles salad side (just $1). They are fast and efficient but super popular.

I like that they seem to think about how the sandwich is constructed physically as well as flavor counterpoints.  I have never had a sandwich fall apart in my hands here or thought something was too bland.\n\nI appreciate the inhouse made side options the rotini salad being my go-to.  I'd love to taste their version of a German style potato salad.  If you go for their combo deal they put a baby cookie on your plate.  Its a pretty good cookie that makes you wish it was a big one.  This is probably how they sell their take home cookie dough.\n\nThey don't get the fifth star for two reasons.  One, the two different combo options are not explained on their menu board.  Considering it is an upsell for them they must perform routinely through out the day it should be clearly posted.  Second, the high ceiling and sealed concrete floor can make it difficult to have a conversation in there when they are busy unless you are lucky enough to get a seat in the alcove.

Hello?!  BYOB!  What more can you say.\n\nYou bring the beer or wine and they'll give you the glasses, corkscrews, etc.  And there's not corkage.\n\nBackground:  There's a family of pizza places in the western suburbs of Chicago called Aurelio's.  Aurelio's is great!  My boyfriend is from Chicago and grew up eating Aurelio's.  Well, the from what I understand, the Spinato family worked with/for the Aurelio family and decided to come out to Phx in the 70's.  They opened an Aurelio's pizza place here in Phx.  It did well, but things transpired that I do not know about and now it's Spinato's.  \n\nThis is Chicago style pizza.  But not that deep dish business, this is Chicago style thin crust pizza, a round pizza cut into squares.  The sauce is a little sweet and they use just the right about of cheese.  I love the peppers they use -- a mixture of hot and sweet (they're not really hot).  My fave is the Super Six -- cheese, ham, pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms and peppers.  I prefer it with extra cheese instead of sausage.\n\nTheir antipasto salad is simple, old school with a great Italian dressing.  \n\nFor less than $15 we can have salad, dinner and BYOB.  \n\nI prefer to eat in for the super hot pizza.", "business_id": "YldXB1hRpnE1CWLF3mvgpQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-01-14", "type": "review"}

These changes ambush me without warning: not long ago I stopped putting Splenda in my tea - cold turkey. I started liking pastrami instead of corned beef. I stopped watching the news on TV. Is this a function of aging? I don't know.\n\nOne of the more dramatic changes has been my growing appreciation of the overall \"character\" of a restaurant. I find myself much more willing to overlook small gaffes in the food preparation if the staff is friendly and knowledgeable, or if the ambience is cheerful and interesting in some way. It doesn't have to be fancy - but it can't be gloomy and boring.\n\nThis was brought home to me today at lunch. Our friend Sue picked a place I had never been to - Spinato's Pizza. It's a family owned and run local chain with four locations. We went to the one at Bell and 16th Street. Sue brought along her friend/employer Lee. It happens that Lee's grandson works in Spinato's kitchen. He always makes it a point to arrive 35 minutes before his shift begins so he can take advantage of employee dinner and he appreciates being treated like family. The place is cute - decorated in red, green and white. There are striped awnings above the booths, and trellises with vines. The chairs are white with green (or red) seats, and the table tops are white with the Spinato logo in the corners. The patio has tables with red-checked cloths. We were warmly greeted , and our server arrived promptly to offer drinks.\n\nKen and I ordered a large Spicy Italian pie ($19.50) with added ricotta. We also got a salad ($3.99). Lee requested garlic bread ($3.99, $4.79 with cheese), and a small spinach calzone, one of the house specialties ($9). Sue got spinach too, but in the form of a \"lil\" (smaller than small) pizza ($7.50). The salads arrived first, notable mostly for their large size. While the ingredients were fresh, there was nothing exciting there. The olive oil and balsamic vinegar served with them were of good quality. The garlic bread, eight pieces in the order, was outstanding - lots and lots of fresh garlic and a generous amount of butter. You have to make sure that everyone you'll be talking to in the next few hours has eaten some too. The staff checked in frequently to ask if we were happy. The pizzas were served on a wire rack, a great idea since the thin crust remains nice and crisp. Instead of slices, our pie was cut into many small squares. I found that for some reason this caused me to eat less. The pizza wasn't loaded down with sauce, and it had plenty of toppings. I tasted Sue's spinach pie and it was really good. The spinach is marinated before being put on the pizza, and there's tons of fresh garlic. Lee's calzone was quite large - he took half of it home.\n\nThe menu isn't extensive. Besides the pizzas (10 varieties, plus design your own)  and calzone (there's a spaghetti and meatball one) there are two pastas and five sandwiches. We didn't inquire about dessert. The story behind Spinato's is told on the back of the menu. The family was worried that when they left Chicago for Phoenix, back in the \"70's, they wouldn't be able to find good pizza. What choice did they have but to open their own pizza parlor?! As the family grew so did the number of parlors. While the prices aren't low, you can go to lunchclub.com and get a 25% off the entire bill coupon. Aren't coupons great!!\n\nI have to say that if I was doing a blind taste-test between Stumpy's pizza (see the archives) and Spinato's, I'd probably give the nod to Stumpy's. But if you add in those other factors which have become important to me, as a dining destination Spinato's wins. It's also won awards from Phoenix New Times, the Scottsdale Culinary Festival and City Search.", "business_id": "YldXB1hRpnE1CWLF3mvgpQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-01-14", "type": "review"}

April 3, 2013 I did my weekly visit to the restaurant to enjoy pizza and drinks with some friends.  In walks a young man and a young woman who were set at the table just next to me a few feet.  On his waist band was a 9 MM pistol.  I am fully for gun rights, as I own one as well, however what I am not for is eating dinner in a family establishment with loaded handguns strapped to other patron's waists.  Every one with in distance of the gun (which had a significant clip attached to it) asked why he felt he needed it in the restaurant.  What we all concluded was this establishment must not be safe if he feels it is necessary to arm himself as he did.  Spinato's allowed this man to carry this in to their establishment as under Arizona law they could choose to keep them out.  I loved you Spinato's, but I simply don't feel comfortable sitting three feet from a random stranger who is armed to the hilt and could take every one out in a matter of minutes.  \n\nI think it is fair to say we can all enjoy your pizza without a 50 clip strapped to our waists.  Or is your establishment so unsafe I should arm myself next time I come?  Unfortunately, I won't ever take the chance again.  I DEFINITELY will miss you...\n\n(I changed my rating from 5 to 3...the food I give a 5, the environment I now give a 1---makes 3 a good compromise).", "business_id": "YldXB1hRpnE1CWLF3mvgpQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-12-08", "type": "review"}

How they have been in business this long is beyond me. I'm Italian and I'm embarrassed for these people. This is the worst sandwich, pasta, salad, macaroni salad, and pizza. I'm so mad they have $16 of my money. I wish I would have lost that money so at least I could be happy for making the day of who ever was to find it. But instead I feel ripped off. F$%#ing disgusting, the health department needs to go in here and shut them down. What a disgrace to Italian food.

Well, most places sell you a sandwich that is packed with a cheap cut of meat, such as Capicola, then maybe a few slices of Salami, and if you are super lucky, you might get a slice of Prosciutto, which will bring the cost of the sub to at least $10.\n\nAt Tony's, they offer the standard Italian sub on their menu, but they allow you to customize it to your liking. An Italian sub, is whatever you want it to be..you choose your cuts of Italian meats, and it's a done deal. I often get Prosciutto, Sopressata, and Salami, and they don't skimp on the quantity of meat either.\n\nIf I were to take the Prosciutto off the sandwich, have them weigh it, and buy just the meat, it would cost more than the entire sandwich does. This is one of the nice things about a family business, they take care of their customers. The bread is authentic, and the flavor of the quality meats really make for an authentic, flavorful, Italian Sub. The best part, is that it only costs about $6.00, which is unbelievable.\n\nIf you aren't looking for authenticity, then this is not the place for you. Authentic is the key word here, and I think that some of the negative reviews I have seen are due to ignorance and not understanding what it takes to run a business of this type in this part of town for so many years.\n\nThey have one of the biggest selections of imported Italian groceries that I have seen in town. They have everything from fresh bread to dry and frozen pasta, to sauces, imported peppers, fresh made Italian Sausages, which are amazing as well. The store is packed with goods, and there may be a little dust on some cans here or there, but come on, it's an old family business with a huge amount of authentic, imported goods. These places are what you want to have around when you want groceries that you only find in the Old World or in big cities, such as San Fran or New York City.\n\nThis business has so much more to offer and I urge anyone who appreciates authenticity and a good down to earth, family owned and operated business to check this place out and write a review that is fair and that applies to the type of business. This place should not be compared to a typical grocery store, or Subway, it's more like an under appreciated, awesome dive bar, but instead, an Italian Grocery Store...lol \n\nI know that the right people know what I'm trying to say. :)\n\nThe bottom line is, keep this hidden gem in business, and then post some deserving reviews on here!\n\nCheers! :)", "business_id": "unPzS1QJJctlZyLGFSk_HA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-02-07", "type": "review"}

Each time was a real treat! I feel that I really need to try to drive the Yelper's who appreciate quality, authentic, simple, old world food to make stop at this place.\n\nif you aren't cultured, and do not appreciate the simplicity of old world food, then steer clear and don't waste your time writing a negative review due to your ignorance.\n\nTo be a qualified reviewer, you must first have an understanding of what it is that you are reviewing. Unfortunately, a great majority of the younger generation in this semi-metropolis have not had the cultural exposure that many of their own age in old school and well cultured cities, such as San Francisco, Los Angeles, or New York City have grown up in and around.\n\nWith that being said, old world, simple dishes, made with simple ingredients and a whole lot of love are often under-appreciated. I urge you to research the importance of things such as bread, cured meats and olives, peppers, homemade sausages, etc. in the old world countries, and even well cultured US Cities.\n\nA physical location that has been around for 30 years in this town that serves up old world cuisine, at an old world price, with a ton of love from the family who has been there from the start deserves a certain respect for those qualities alone.\n\nIt is apparent to me that the typical American these days, seems to consider a true sandwich incomplete without Mayo or Mustard. The truth is, that those two additions are fine, but your tongue is uncultured. A true sub should not have such ingredients to cover up the subtle flavors of the cured meats and cheese. A little oil and vinegar add the zing that Ashley C. was speaking of. Again, no disrespect to her lack of knowledge, but knowledge and understanding are power and lead to a well rounded palette. \n\nThe sandwiches are only one small item in the full spectrum of this old world rarity, in a not so favorable part of town. The fact is, that this part of town may be a couple of miles out of your daily travels, but it is only a hop, skip, and a jump off the 51.\n\nAny true Yelper who appreciates the few, true Phoenix greats who sometimes fall into the unknown needs to make their way to this abode and see what you think and how you feel. If you feel the way that I do, then I think that the weight that I currently have on my shoulders about helping this quality place to stay afloat, will transcend to you and our team efforts will unite to get these old school purveyors back in the spotlight that they deserve to be in.\n\nLet's keep the growth of true culture and diversity alive in this town before it ends up like Old Town Scottsdale. There, you have a bunch of places with different names and decor, but the majority of the same food and lack of culture or ambiance are spreading like a wildfire that is depleting true cultural experiences and the small and simple places that don't get the love and appreciation that they deserve. \n\nForget the fancy menus with a fancy plate made in China, you can find that anywhere and they are in a completely different market. Take yourself back into a different time and into a different culture, it will make life more enjoyable and you will be more appreciative of the things that you have this day in age, as well as the roots that the things of this day evolved from. it's like thanking your parents or grandparents for the wisdom that they gave you. :)\n\nCheers!", "business_id": "unPzS1QJJctlZyLGFSk_HA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-12-27", "type": "review"}
