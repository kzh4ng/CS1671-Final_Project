I can tell you this is not the case everywhere. I also like that I can message back and forth with my Doctor. If there's something I have a concern about I can take a picture send an email and I normally get a response within 24 hours. Also when I have had tests done I have received calls from my Dr. Not his nurse or an office person but my actual Doctor. This is a rarity now a days.  I do have to say sometimes you might have to wait a few weeks for an appt but they do have a waiting list you can go on and they'll call you if a place opens up. If it's something you feel is urgent let them know and they will do everything they can to get you in asap.

Christopher Jenny. During which I told him that the Ambien he had previously prescribed caused a \"zombie like\" feeling the next morning. I take care of my 11 month old on the regular by myself, and do not want to be in any kind of \"off\" mental state. This was a lengthy discussion about the Ambien, during which I told him I did not want to take it anymore, and asked if we could peruse different options, that would not have such a lingering side effect, as I did have trouble sleeping. He replied, to take more of my prescribed benzodiazapam to help fall asleep as needed, and to follow up if I needed something else.\n\nAbout a week passed and I messaged him via their patient portal. Stating my concern that I was using too much of my benzo, and that I would need something else, or more to compensate for my lack of sleep. His response almost 48 hours later (even though their website clearly states that messages would be returned within 24 hours) informed me that he had called in a prescription of Ambien for me at my local pharmacy. Ok....did I imagine that whole appointment....and conversation about how I DON'T WANT TO BE ON AMBIEN.\n\nWell in response I expressed my concern over the lack of note taking and listening/attentiveness during my last appointment and that I was concerned about that. It is a little disheartening to learn the person who is supposed to be caring for your well being obviously had no idea,  or didn't care enough to look at my chart or even take notes in the first place. I am an EMT, i know the importance of patient history, and it is clear that Carolina Family Healthcare has zero concept of that.\n\nI was also approached during my last visit about my negative review about the practice, The office manager asked me to stay after my appointment to talk. I explained that everything I wrote in my previous review I still felt true, and that the reason I even came back after they screwed up one of my wife's appointments, as well as scheduling my then 6 month old while the office was at lunch leaving us standing in the rain, was to give them a second chance.\n\nWell it wasn't until I removed my more positive re-review of the practice after my terrible experience with PA Jenny that I received my certified letter informing me that I would no longer be treated at their practice. The kick is that it was signed by Dr. Kanelos, who never even had talked to me or approached me about anything. I have never even seen the man in real life, but he dismissed me from the practice. I believe this has a lot to do with my Yelp review. Although I may be harsh with my reviews, I tell the truth, and have not lied about a single thing written here. \n\nAMA guidelines establish and I quote \"Discontinuing patient-provider relationships should be undertaken only after a serious attempt has been made to clarify and understand the expectations and concerns of all involved parties.\"\n\nThis NEVER HAPPENED, or even close. Again proof that this office JUST REALLY DOESN'T CARE.\n\nI will spread the word of the complete lack of professionalism, as well as the dismissal based on a yelp review. I do not believe questioning why I was prescribed Ambien, after telling them I don't want to take it would get me dismissed during the middle of a new prescription plan, leaving me to find a brand new doctor and office to try and continue what has been prescribed. \n\nGood luck dealing with this office, and good riddance.

But fear not! I found a couple of great classes- my favorite easily being turbo kick (Meredith C and Anna K are such great motivators- and they will leave you with a killer workout!). I also really like total strength and cardio strength. Recently I tried rock-it-cardio strength which left me very sore and thus I will probably add that one to my repertoire as well. \n\nClasses that are iffy include Wednesdays Athletic Conditioning which in itself is difficult but a particular female instructor Becky, is a screamer (in an echo-y gym) and doesn't explain directions well so my first class had to be my last...I left with a big headache! The other iffy one is zumba which I feel focuses too much on the dance aspect and not enough cardio itself - thus it's hard to follow along with the hand gestures but doesn't really give me as intense of a work out as turbo-kick.\n\nIt took me a few months to figure out I could park in the church lot (and walk in the back area near the pool) but since then I haven't had an hassles in the parking lot as there are almost always spots there. \n\nTemp-wise the gym is a little stuffy and gets really crowded. I also wish they capped some of the classes...and specifically offered the weight classes in a room with mirrors (at least the beginner classes) - it makes it easier to keep a flat back and watch your positioning.  \n\nFinally if any ladies are reading this - the locker room is just downright uncomfortable at times. Shower curtains are there for a reason and no, I don't want to sit in the hot-tub with you while you're naked after you worked out-gross!

I think I pay more in taxes than I actually net on the small amount of additional income it gets me, so I'd hope any bias I have is well-tempered.\n\nAs someone whose been to almost all the county's Ys, I'm a big fan of the C-K.  Tucked into the Wachovia (now Wells Fargo???) One building, and adjacent to the Hilton, this beacon of sweat calls to the uptown corporate crowd and those in town for just a few nights.  Hint: almost all the traveling shows for the performing arts center give their crew and cast passes to come and use this Y.  I've met dancers, singers, and performers of most of the bigger shows here.  Humorist David Sedaris (and his sister), for example, were in town recently for a one night performance- they both came to swim and had a great time (he even mentioned the visit during the show!).\n\nSo why this Y?  3 main reasons.  First, this place is not so gargantuan that you would get lost making your way from the lockers to the gym floor.  This also means the crowds are manageable and people tend to know the other people around.  I don't find this so much at the Dowd, for example.  The friendly aires here are just a little more appealing both for motivational and enjoyment of the visit purposes.  \n\nSecond, the cardio and weight equipment is well-maintained and logically laid out.  They just put in new free weights and redesigned that part of the gym with some new machines to boot- which was a nice upgrade.  People here generally care enough to wipe down the machines after they are done and don't mind letting you work in for sets.  When you are on a schedule, this helps.\n\nThird, everything you want is here in one place.  Group Ex classes, a pool, an indoor track, personal training and basketball half court.  If you get hungry, check out the food bar at the entrance- it's get a nice selection of food options that aren't fried or wrapped in cheese and bread.  I also find at least the men's locker room to be amply sized, with plenty of shower stalls, a steam room, a sauna, and plenty of lockers for day use.  \n\nLunchtime tends to be busiest, but the early morning crowd gets decently sized too.  The after work rush is much more subdued lately, no real idea why.  If you want the place almost to yourself, come in between 8:30 am - 11:00 am or 2:30 pm - 5:00 pm.  Amazing how things empty out then.  \n\nOne note of clarification- parking is free for up to 2.5 hours in the Wachovia/Hilton deck so long as your are out before 8:30 am or enter after 4:30 pm.  The times do not apply on the weekends, though I am sure the gym here is closed completely on Sundays.  Whatever you do, just make sure you stamp your parking ticket with the Y stamp at the entrance.  The parking deck attendants have little mercy for those who do not follow the restrictions.  Comprende?\n\nI'm a morning person and the best part of this gym, for me, is the community of regulars who also make the daily pilgrimage to burn some calories before the sun rises.  There are some serious athletes who train like crazy and some desk jockeys who live for their exercise highs outside of the office (that's my hand raised in the back of the room).  In all, it is a great mix of people who will open up if you take the time to talk to them.

I was able to sit in on a couple of meetings, but the rest of the time the director had nothing for me to do.

This Susan was massively overweight (I only note her weight in case someone at Presbyterian cares enough to read these reviews and wants to know who these horrible people are.

I went without pain meds for 16 hours and was in terrible pain. \n\nAlso while we were here, they sent someone in to ask for money. We were current with all of our bills at the time and have never made a late payment so there was no reason to come in with their hand out.

The assistant who called to tell me that they had called a new Rx in to the pharmacy said that she couldn't tell me what type of infection my daughter had.

Of course that part of the message didn't get through because he called me 10 min. later while I was drivng and could take down the name of the infection.  From what I could remember of the type of infection, when I googled it, I couldn't find anything, so I still don't know what it was, and have put in another call.

By far the biggest problem they have is their phone/support staff.\n\nI certainly don't expect CFP to diagnose me over the phone, but if I contact them for a follow up on an appointment I had, it's like pulling teeth to get a call back.  Calls typically take multiple business days to be returned - if they are at all.  This includes the time that I was in pain to the point I was spending 1/2 the day in bed.  Or the time I was traveling and forgot my prescription, and asked for a small quantity to be prescribed as I was 2000 miles away from the only bottle I had.  I've even called and spoken with management about not getting timely callbacks, but nothing has changed after months!\n\nTheir patient referral service isn't any better.  I've been called and \"told\" by their staff when my referred appointment was - without any input from me on what fits my schedule.  I've tried asking them for the name of the doctor so I can make my own appointment, only to be told they don't have that and only the referral person does.  Or the time I was in pain making it impossible to leave bed, and the only doctor they could refer me to didn't have any appointments for 1.5 months - and they had no other suggestions on where to go.  \n\nThe final straw was when I inquired about a preventive medicine for me.  The response I was given amounted to \"I've heard of that, but I don't know enough about it to be comfortable prescribing it.\"  There was no willingness for the doctor to research and follow up to me.  He couldn't even recommend a specialist who was familiar with it - and this wasn't an experimental treatment - this was a relatively new, but manufacturer-recognized use of a 10+ year old medicine.\n\nI don't think I've ever felt that CFP was customer-focused.

Offices can run a quick test for strep on the spot, they can also send one out to a lab. The Doctor decided she wanted both. In my foggy haze I'm trying to put the pieces of this puzzle together but I just can't quite get there, but I also know it doesn't add up. \n\nTime passes. \n\nDoctor comes back and says their test shows it's not strep.

I'm terrified of needles, and had a bit of a meltdown.

For a doctor of this sort, Dr. Cyr is AMAZING. I have been to many women gynos (sorry, no dudes up in my lady-business) and I've had good ones and I've had atrocious ones.\n\nMy atrocious experiences have all been in Phoenix, so I had been without an ob-gyn for several months until a co-worker recommended Dr. Cyr. Lucky for me, I struck GOLD! Dr. Cyr, you're not allowed to retire. Sorry. (Don't worry, she's young; she won't retire anytime soon).\n\nCut to the chase. Reasons why Dr. Cyr is amazing:\n\n1) She doesn't make me feel like a creepy weirdo for not being married nor wanting kids anytime soon. SERIOUSLY, I got grief from ob-gyns for 'not being ready for a family yet.' Um, guys, I can't even feed myself on a regular basis, and you want me to have a kid? Major fail. Dr. Cyr DOES NOT DO THIS. She didn't even bring up me wanting kids now or in the future. Thanks, Dr. Cyr!\n\n2) I didn't wait a million hours to see her! At my last gyno doctor (who shall remain nameless), I waited 2 hours for my appt. Wtf?? Here, I waited no more than 20 minutes, and that was because I was filling out paperwork. YAY!\n\n3) Dr. Cyr answered my questions professionally and fully. She didn't shirk around my more... awkward... questions, and she explained the options to me in plain English. She reassured me on some things that I was worried about, and she even made me laugh in the process. I NEVER laugh at the doctors! This is amazing!!\n\nOn a less quantifiable basis, I felt Dr. Cyr just 'got' me. It's hard to explain, but I felt comfortable talking to her and felt I could bring any issue up and she wouldn't judge me for it. \n\nShoot, I think I want to have a baby with Dr. Cyr now. Wait.. that's not quite what I meant... anyway, go see Dr. Cyr if you have lady-parts!

I just recently came from the Portland VA system, which is IMO is one of the best ran VA systems.  My First visit was to the Phoenix VA Women's Clinic in FEB 2012, after getting home from the Philippine's  I had no mail for my VA visit results so I called to receive them via mail to provide to my unit.  In SEPT I received my Test results I had done in FEB/ the letter was dated JUNE!? 3-4 months to mail a letter? Ok, I have to give this VA System the benefit of the doubt because there's no way this is how this Hospital operates so let's see how my first Doctors visit goes.  After me and my husband waited for 8 Months to get our initial appt. just to assign us a primary care physician. We were asked to show up 30min before my 2:00PM appt. I did! 1:30 show up/ check in was great thanks to Daniel who was very personable/ 2:15 Vitals were taken, 2:30 Back in waiting room/ 3:00 still in waiting room/3:30 I go to front desk to ask what is going on with my 2:00PM Appt. I was here at 1:30PM for? They checked with the DOC (DR. TONG) Diamond Clinic/ She is running behind \"because she likes to spend time with her patients\".  4:15pm! Still in waiting room :/ Apparently she likes to spend time with her patients at the expense of her other patients who have been waiting for nearly 3hrs!! I and my Husband look around to find ourselves to be the only people in the waiting room now and the Hospital quietly closing up.  My frustration starts to boil and tears start to come to my eyes with anger... This is the VA system we are enrolling in??? The Clinic door opens; Dr. Tong addresses us as if we shouldn't be upset at the unreasonable wait... seriously!  I had scheduled a 2:00PM appt specifically to make to the LAB for workups I knew I would be requesting, but because of her inability to perform her tasks with time management in consideration I had to request the test and run the stairs in platforms to get to lab by 4:30, My Superpowers kicked in and I MADE IT 4:25PM! Thank goodness! I dreaded the thought of the drive from Buckeye to this VA again just for Lab workups or to wait in emergency for a blood draw because Dr. Tong was considerate of other patients at my and my husband's expense.  After everything was said and done I had requested for my test results from DR. Tong/ a week later I get a letter saying everything is \"essentially normal\".  Wow! Where are my test results and what does \"essentially\" mean? Come on! Apparently, there's no regard or STANDARD to informing the patient of their test results and no standard for when the patient will be notified of their test results and among other deficiencies in this VA System.

I went to the ER AFTER going to my assigned Emerald Clinic, and the effiency of the ER really highlighted how poorly the Emerald Clinic handled themselves, once again. This review honestly doesn't include the VA's ER department. I'm not sure if the intense nature of emergency medicine puts all the most skilled doctors, nurses, and staff in that department, whatever it is, they are miles ahead of the Emerald Clinic from when you first see the person at the front desk, to when you leave.\n\nAfter taking a job offer in another country, I was informed five days before leaving that I need a health examination done. I went into my assigned Emerald Clinic hoping that they could help me out. Now, I knew my situation was far from critical, but I was more than willing to wait as long as it took to get this health examination. I explained my situation to the lady at the front desk, and she told me, \"I'll do what I can.\" After about thirty minutes I asked her my status, and she gave me a \"thumbs up\" so I was pleased that I'd be seen. After waiting another hour, I was called in back and told, \"sorry, we aren't going to help you today. You need blood work for a physical, and it's too late to start doing that.\" It was approximately 1:30pm. I mentioned the time, and said, \"we literally have hours left in the day, I can go do what you need me to do right now.\" She just sort of shrugged at me. I asked if we can skip the bloodwork, and just do a quick check up (I didn't need bloodwork for the job). \"Nahh. We can't do a physical without bloodwork. And nobody else will,\" (lie number 1). Her dismissal attitude, and apathy was shocking to me. What came next though really upset me. Another thing I was told was that, \"your health care provider is pregnant, and not staying til we close, she's leaving early, so even if you get the bloodwork, we still aren't going to help you.\" Unprofessional. \n\nI asked her if she had any suggestions for me. She told me, very confidently, \"oh yeah, go to the hospital on 7th Ave, past Roosevelt, and they do physicals for vets for $20. They'll have you in and out quick too,\" (lie number 2). After wasting my time and gas money driving to the hospital on 7th Ave, they looked at me like I was crazy, and said they do not, nor have they ever, done walk in physicals for only $20. The bottom line is that it was 1:30pm on a Friday when I was in the Emerald Clinic and they didn't want to take a walk-in patient after 12:00pm. So after refusing to help me, I assume the lady I saw lied to me to me to get me out of there quickly.\n\nThe person I saw at Patient Advocacy literally shrugged it off and said, \"It's Friday. They want to go home.\" Like that is completely acceptable behavoir. Luckily, I got a little empathy at the ER, explained my situation to nurse Sharon (who was awesome), and like I said, I was in and out in less than 2 hours, WITH a health examination. I don't think Emerald Clinic's laziness is fair to the ER, who in my case, blatantly had to pick up the Emerald Clinic's slack. Making me wait almost a hour and half just to tell me they wouldn't help me was another upsetting fact. That's not how you treat people, and it's certainly not how you should treat vets in a veteran's hospital.

I had such a traumatic experience trying to visit this place!\n \n. . . and I never even got past the front desk. When I arrived for my appointment, the receptionist who greeted me from behind the desk was extremely angry, unpleasant, and rude. The first thing I hear is her yelling at me, \"I'm on the phone!\" as she rolled her eyes at me. So, I nervously signed my name, sat down, and waited to be called. After waiting for quite a while, she grumbled my name and asked for my completed forms. I told her that I did not have any forms with me and no one told me about any forms. She then just rudely pointed to boards hanging on the wall, rolled her eyes one more time, and ordered me to complete it. She also asked for my insurance card; however, before I could even pull the card completely out of my wallet she just snatched it out of my hands, sighed, and told me to go sit down. At that moment, I could not believe how bad I was being treated as a brand new patient for absolutely no reason. I felt so uncomfortable, unwelcome, and threatened at a place where I came to feel safe and get help. I told her that I was canceling my appointment. She just looked at me and laughed. I left that office in tears, called the primary number and left the Office Manager a voice message. She later called me back and told me that they never had such an experience at the office and that I was the first patient to ever feel this way. She went on to tell me to find a different doctor as I was not a good fit for them. A couple of days later they called me and told me that they had reviewed my complaint and had decided not to accept me as a patient. I am speechless that a new patient trying to obtain mental health care in a new state with a new doctor can be treated with such hostility and neglect. And then after trying to notify them about these problems I was treated as if I was at fault and told to go find help somewhere else. \n \nUnfortunately, now after seeing these other reviews, I don't think I am the first to have this experience.

It was Thanksgiving eve and instead of preparing food for my family I had no other choice but to go get scene to make sure everything was OK. With the pain magnifying each second I sat more and more hunched trying to find the right position to stop the pain from hurting but with each little move I made, pain shot right into the center of my upper back. Tears rolled down my face as I could not hold them back, the pain was so horrific, it was the only thing that I could do but cry. Ashamed that everyone saw me crying, at that very moment I didn't care, I cried and cried hurting more and more. \nWhen i Finally looked at my phone it said 1:30, why was I left to sit and suffer so long, nurses and doctors, medical staff walked out and around me for 4.5 hours and no one bothered to ask if I was OK. I finally got enough strength to slowly get up walking to the counter hunched over, 23 years old and walking like a 80 year old with paralysis. I asked the lady at the counter with a beat red face full of tears,\" Why are you guys doing this to me, I have been here for 4 and a half hours in pain, I can barely sit, let alone walk.\" She then notified a doctor who opened the door and  came out and and said, \"We have 4 serious conditions ahead of you and 3 minor ones in front of you, what is the issue. Trying to talk in between tears I said pain is shooting into the center of my upper back with each movement, I am nauseous and feel horrible, Ive been waiting for the last 4.5 hours in this same condition. He then said OK well do labs and x-rays, he then had me walk to the get my labs done.When I had got back to take my x-rays, the woman who was providing the x-rays had informed me that we need to do certain poses to get chest x-rays on me, she informed me to stand up straight and place my arms above me on the bar, unfortunately I was in no shape to do such poses. I stood as straight as I could(although it was not much)  and told her I cant grab the pole. She then snapped at me and said,\" I have more important cases to handle if you cant stand up straight and grab the pole,\" by then I was exhausted, overwhelmed and have been the most humiliated, a human being can be, I told her ,\"its OK, since you have more important cases to handle, I will just leave,\" shaking and crying she was leading me to the door, still griping at me, telling me that if I cant stand up straight they cannot determine what pain meds to give me. I looked at her and said, \" I am not here for the pain medication, I am here to make sure I did not majorly damage myself, I am 23 years old and can barely walk, each time I move I have pain shooting throughout my upper back.\" she then felt ashamed of treating me with such unethical and unpractical medical practice that she knew she was in the wrong, she offered again to try to help. After x rays, I then walked back to where the patient beds were and the doctors all looked at me, it had felt like time had stopped, childbirth had felt like a breeze at that moment, with the amount of pain that I was in. The same doctor from before then told me,\" go back and sit in the waiting room, until we get the x-ray results and labs. I could not believe it, I walked out feeling as low as a bug, ashamed, humiliated, hopeless, by then it was 2:30, I could not take waiting another second in that hospital. I could not believe no one cared there, I would never recommend this hospital to anyone, the doctors, nurses and medical personals do not hold none of the AMA code of medical ethics, I am highly ashamed of how I was treated and would not want anyone else to feel the same humiliation I did.", "business_id": "p2rwsM4zoQ32jeybGYPT-A", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-11-28", "type": "review"}

I will update this review later.**\n\nHave had ongoing right knee pain for the past 6+ years. As athletes, most of us aren't a bunch of wusses when it comes to pain and tolerance for it. Walk it off, damnit, walk it off!   \n\nWell, one week, there was no walking off anything. It was getting in the way of my training. After losing a season this year because of surgery, my Coach and I went into panic mode to figure out what this was. \n\nAfter an MRI  found some awesome chondromalacia and patella - femoral malignment (Thanks a lot, hammer throw), my PCP referred me to see Dr. Cummings. \n\nFront office staff was very friendly, and I had plenty of time to fill out of my paperwork. I will say they were running about an hour behind, but it wasn't a problem for me - at least not that day.  \n\nHad some X-Rays of both knees done on-site while waiting for the Medical Assistant to download the images off my MRI disc. \n\nDr. Cummings actually introduced himself to me as Dean when he walked into the room, which I thought was pretty cool! \n\nConfirmed everything found on the MRI, and told me I'm experiencing something called \"dyskinetic chain\". Cause? The joint of my big toe. INSANE! Never would have expected that. No surgery necessary, just need some top-notch physical therapy.\n\nNot once did I feel belittled by him as other reviews and peers of mine warned me. Not even a little hint of specialist arrogance. Nope! \n\nI also appreciate the fact that he didn't try to \"used car salesman\" me to use their on-site PT Clinic. \n\nHe sent me to his colleague (Dave Hogarth, DPT in Chandler), who specializes in this specifically.\n\nWhich by the way, that guy scares the holy crap out of me with his manual therapy techniques. * shudder *  Makes the PT I saw for post-surgical rehab this summer seem like a trip to the Massage Therapist (and that guy beat up on my surgical sites pretty bad - Trevor, please don't hate me for this!).  \n\nBut my range of motion is improving with this program, so can't complain. Oh, and he's a former decathlete who *gasp* actually understands the hammer throw! \n\nHopefully the next time I see Dr. Cummings, I'll be discharged. \n\nI HIGHLY recommend TOCA for your orthopedic concerns and specifically Dr. Cummings especially if you're a high level athlete.

I think if you avoid \"peak\" times when calling the office, you have the best chance of getting an appointment with the smallest amount of frustration.

Long story short, they told me I was not a candidate for LASIK because of my high prescription.  Normally they'd recommend ICLs (implantable contact lenses) but the anterior chamber of my eyes were too shallow.  So they said there was nothing they could do for me and told me I was better off in contacts/glasses.  I was pretty discouraged until an optometrist friend of mine recommended getting several other opinions (she worked for a LASIK center that did eyes worse than mine) ... and I did.\n\nHere's where I learned the truth of BDPEC... apparently within the local ophthalmologist community, they are FAMOUS for pushing ICLs.  So let me save you some time here.  If your near-sighted prescription is worse than -6.00, they will recommend ICLs (below that they will do LASIK).  FYI - ICLs cost a lot more than LASIK, too (ka-ching!).  Anyways, if you don't fit that ICL bucket, they'd rather let you walk.  After doing more research, I discovered that a high-prescription ALONE does not a bad LASIK patient make, which is what BDPEC led me to believe.  In fact, the other doctors told me that because my corneas are way above average in thickness, my risk for complications is much lower!  Imagine that!  \n\nI'm sure that if you fit into the BDPEC business model, you will get great results.  However, I STRONGLY encourage anyone considering refractive correction surgery to do your research and get at least 2 or 3 opinions outside of BDPEC.  They operate on a business-first model vs. clinical-first.\n\nGood luck!", "business_id": "4R8uKEIwTVzHGLa3Edub0Q", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-09-27", "type": "review"}

They use a mathematical calculation based on the age of the patient - this means the exam at your local Target is better quality, as you would receive an exam for both portions of your bifocals.

Not once have I had an issue and every single time there is nothing but helpfulness whenever I have to have yet another crazy unheard of test ran. They've spent countless hours working on the paperwork I need to submit with all the results without appearing hassled or bothered. They've also promptly called me when my results are in or for any other status update I request.\n\nAdditionally, they are very patient when my prescription company acts like an asshat. Due to circumstances I needed to have a 6 month fill of my prescription rather than the typical 3 month I receive. When I emailed my prescription company, they told me this was possible if the doctor's office called it in. However, my doctor's assistant tried several times and got nowhere. Today I was there with her and she patiently tried one last time and made sure my prescription went through as requested. It was something that she really didn't need to do but kindly did for me despite how much of a pain in the ass it was.\n\nWithout a doubt I recommend Dr. Bauer and her assistant 110%.", "business_id": "yS6tXY9skBQ4eLZLQaDlEg", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-10-15", "type": "review"}

It is HUGE but they have a map at the entrance of the parking lot. When you walk in, you are immediately greeted by the girls at the front desk. They promptly take your information and have you sign the remaining paperwork if you didn't finish it online. You then wait for another lady to take your co-pay. From what it seems this office runs like a well oiled machine, but I thought it was interesting that the woman was copying the co-pays on paper in an old fashioned receipt book. It didn't take long, so I don't really care, I just would have figured since they have online technology for their patients that they would have something for themselves.\n\nAnyway, a nurse came and got me and did the whole vitals thing and checked height and weight and what not and then I was placed in a room to wait for Dr. Bauer. It took her about 5 minutes and she was in and introducing herself, reviewing my paperwork and talking to me about me. She was really nice and straightforward which I liked - down to business. Please don't take it for her being impersonal because it isn't, shes a busy doctor and wants to give you the best focus she can and I like that.\n\nShe checked me out and everything was fine as I knew and she also quickly gave me a referral for an ENT in the same building and had me request my old records. For a first time visit, this only took 45 minutes which was less than I was expecting.\n\nDr. Bauer and the staff are great and I hope when and if I need anything more serious I can prove them right even further as to how good they are.

I honestly felt trapped.\n\nThis is the wonderful help i've gotten.\nDr Daveys sat outside the examining room talking on the phone about his upcoming vacation for well over 15 minutes while I listened. It had only been an hour wait getting in to examination room.\n\nThe receptionist are the biggest bunch of rude obnoxious.......they have just about done everything but give me the finger. \n\nI can't tell you how many times my insurance company didn't ante up so they will call you up to the front of the waiting area and in front of EVERYONE ask about it and ask quite rudely. Then tell me they \"tried\" to call  so I deserve being called up to the front of the class. So embarrassing, especially when your sick. They even called me up when my husband (who had a different insurance plan) had not paid. AND told me I couldn't see the DR because of it! Thats after I had waited fifteen minutes already. I have no idea what I was supposed to do. Go beat up his insurance company?\n\nThen there was the time I was prescribed medication that sent me to the ER. Wait no hold on there was the TWO times that medication was prescribed to me that sent me to the ER.\n\nAnd the time they told my son he had loose joints when in fact he had scoliosis. Where you get loose joints from curvature of the spine is anyone's guess. \n\nAnd then when Dr. Bauer accused me of being a smoker, when I told her I wasn't. She told me I was lying....because you know thats what I do. Lie to GP's....Its a bit of a sinful delight for me. I always hope it gets me improved care......oh wait. \n\nThe long waits where always enjoyable. If I got out of there in less than a hour it would have seemed nothing short of a miracle. You better plan on a lonnnnnng wait. They are making vacation plans after all. \n\nI could go on for days. This place is awful. **AWFUL***  Please, go somewhere, anywhere else.

When walgreens calls in the refill, the doctors office doesn't respond - I've had to follow up each time.  When I call the doctors office to check the refill status they say \"have you seen the doctor recently\" ... what??  Obviously I saw the doctor which is why the first prescription (that was only for 30 days) was issued by him and also the refill is pending his approval.  Then they say \"oh - I will have to pull your chart and call you back\"... what is going on with this place?  Why does it take my call to get them to process the refill?\n\nFortunately I am moving so I will search for a new doctors office.   I think office take on too many patients, and too few assistants handling many doctors at a time.  Either insurance isn't paying enough so they take on too many patients, or they are too cheap to hire more help.\n\nDoctor Davies is very friendly however, and he does not push prescriptions on you.  I do like the doctor, but I cannot take the process of working with the office.\n\nGood luck if you decide to go with them.

Upon going into the office and going through the 2 hours worth of tests, to ensure that I was a candidate, Diamond and the entire Sales staff explained what was involved.

Laura then helped secure the financing portion for me which meant a lot considering I was super nervous about not only the surgery, but also the financing portion of it. \n\nThe day of surgery I showed up, and as expected was extremely busy.

Recently, the moved \"down the street\" to a new, updated offices.  I am writing this review because it seems that MANY, many people use Yelp to find...anything.  Dr. Kuhl and his staff make going to the doctor as pleasant an experience as it can be.  Not only is the Staff extremely courteous, professional and cordial, they are actually friendly and nice!  They remember patient names; spend the necessary time with a patient when necessary, even if it means someone else will have to wait.  Dr. Kuhl, naturally, is a Board Certified physician, which should be important to anyone choosing a physician.  He is thorough, explains anything and everything about which you have questions, and goes over every test result with you, one by one.  If Dr. Kuhl thinks you need to see a Specialist, he is the first one to make that recommendation.  There is no \"ego\" involved.  I think the most telling thing I can share with you is a memory of something that happened in his waiting room when I happened to be there - many years ago.  The waiting room was full.  He was running late.  Suddenly the door opened, and there stood Dr. Kuhl.  He APOLOGIZED for keeping everyone waiting, but said, \"I have a patient that simply needs more time than we had scheduled.  I promise each of you, if YOU were that patient, I would do the same for you.\"  I think it is rare that a physician ever apologizes for keeping you waiting, even when they walk into the exam room.  This was extraordinary.  I would recommend any of the physicians in this practice without any hesitation.  Also - if you have an emergent situation, they find a way to see you - that day!

There's nothing like running the tip of your tongue over clean, smooth and fresh teeth. So, you can imagine my excitement when I decided to go in for my quarterly cleaning. \n\nHaving received a voucher in the mail, I figured 25$ off a service was enough of a draw to get me in. Granted, this voucher wasn't mine - it was for the previous occupant of my apartment. But, hell, the dental office didn't know that. \"A friend gave it to me,\" I told them when I presented it proudly at 8 a.m. one morning. I was then told that's for birthdays only, and when my birthday comes around, I'll get mine to use. Oh. Well, I was already there, so I might as well stay - without the voucher even. Good thing my dental insurance covered the cleaning. \n\nAfter 30 minutes of waiting, I'm escorted back to a regular, average-sized dental office. You know, all decked out with the typical dental chair and machinery. That's when I'm told that the X-rays I emailed weren't going to be enough, so they had to re-take 'em. WTF. Ugh. \n\nFirst off, I hate stuff being stuck in my mouth. It pinches my cheeks and hurts. So, when the dental hygienist said, \"You have a really small mouth,\" I wasn't surprised. It wasn't the first time I heard it. Nor was it the first time I had ever had X-rays taken. Hell, I got 8 beautiful veneers last year. You don't get those overnight. That's one helluva process, which includes way too many impressions (translation: gooey-ness and mouth pieces stuck in your mouth for at least a minute.) \n\nSo, I sucked it up. It had to be done. It was the means to an end, I told myself. Besides, my dental insurance should cover it. \n\nThat's when I was told they then had to measure my gums. An assistant was called in and the poking and counting began. I didn't mind, but it was more of my time devoted to routine practice... and not the cleaning I had been dreaming of. Oh, sweet cleaning, why were you playing hard to get?!?\n\nImagine my frustration when, after the Gum \"stuff\" and X-rays were taken (a few re-taken due to bad shots), I then had to have my mandatory consultation with the dentist. I guess he, himself, had to poke and prod around my gums and teeth. That's when he wanted to talk about replacing a couple caps and taking care of a cavity I have. Uhm, now? All I wanted was a cleaning. Seriously. \n\nPlus, he heard that a friend referred me. \"What friend?\" He asked. \"Uh, Christy.\" I lied. \"Christy who? I only ask because I like to thank my patients when they refer their friends.\" I was cracking up inside. Of course he did. \"I don't know,\" I said, \"I don't really know her that well.\"\n\nThat's when I checked the time. It was close to 10 and I had a meeting. Was this really happening? I told them I had to get going because of work. Ok, so maybe I didn't look like the young professional I am when I'm sitting in a dentist chair with flip-flops, jeans and an old t-shirt on. Not to mention my hair was haphazard in a pony-tail and my face was free of make-up. Who was I trying to impress anyway? \n\nBottom line, I had to get going. The friendly hygienist (who, turns out, is from Michigan) said the cleaning would take about 20 minutes. I let my office know I was running behind; then, I relaxed into the dentist's chair.  Time for the cleaning! \n\nAh, the cleaning... bliss... pleasure... oh, sweet jesus...\n\nThen, ugh. Fluoride. I was told I couldn't eat or drink or rinse for 2 hours. WTF. My stomach rumbled in anger. \n\nAfterwards, I was given the usual bag of goodies. Upon check-out, the woman at the desk had already drafted up the coverage and cost for the procedures the dentist said I needed to get done. Cool. That's helpful, I thought. Right on. But then she wanted to schedule the appointment. \"I need to check my schedule,\" I said. She looked surprised again, as if to say, \"Oh, you work?\" Yes, g'dammit, I work!  After telling her about 2-3 times that I would have to get back to her, she finally let me go. \n\nThat's when I sped out of the parking lot with 15 minutes to run home, change (no time for a shower, grr!) and get my arse to work. I hate-hate-hate running late. I didn't know that a routine cleaning scheduled at 8 a.m. would take 2 hours. \n\nSo, why the 4 stars? I can't knock how thorough this office is. I just wish they would have told me ahead of time, then, the working gal I am, I would not have scheduled an important meeting that morning. I would have saved it for the afternoon, esp. since I had to lead a meeting on an empty stomach with Fluoride breath.

Melissa, in particular, has been a joy to have as my hygienist. We never seem to lack for things to chat about --- which is a challenge when you're having your teeth cleaned! You'll never feel nervous or uncomfortable in her care. She's the most thoughtful, gentle and considerate hygienist anyone could ask for.

With that said If you have to go here then go but...\n\nA little over a year ago I had to go to the ER and after waiting for over two hours when there was no body in front of me and it was early and not busy I finally got seen by a doctor for like two minutes who was rude and then I never saw him again. \n\nI had a lady come in and mop my room while the nurse was putting in an IV in my arm!!! Uhhh, hello, do you think could have maybe come back a little later?\n\nI had another nurse who was there to take my blood pressure info just leave the machine on and it beeped for the next 15 mins until finally in all my pain (I later found out I had a kidney stone) I got up and asked someone to turn it off. \n\nMy nurse wouldn't give me any information about what the tests I was getting were for. The room was 71 degrees and I had to ask 3 different people for a warm blanket even AFTER my boyfriend called the nurses station from work to get them to bring me one. \n\nThe place seemed dirty and unsanitary, I mean I guess it was due to all the construction they had to wheel me through but even that was ridiculous. Oh yeah I almost forgot to mention the left over sticky things, the ones that they use to connect your heart to machines, in my gown that I noticed. I was never hooked to a heart machine... That means they were who ever had the gown on before I did. That's gross!.\n\nThen I had to deal with all the payment info and not one person I talked to yet has been helpful. They all seem to be \"busy\" and rude and they act like I'm bugging them for calling the 800 number to get my payments squared away. Ugh! \n\nNow, I have to deal with the billing folks again. Why, you ask? Oh because they decided not to send me my last bill and even after talking to mulitple people asking them to send me a bill to my new address and them agreeing to. I guess it was just easier to put my bill into collections. Thanks JCL! You guys are swell folks. So today I call in asking to see if we can get this fixed. That I WANT to pay my bill. That I had no intention of not paying it. That there was no reason for it to go into collections. Pat (the lady I spoke to) was no help, so I asked to talk to a supervisor or manager. She put me on hold for about 8 mins and then some how the phone call got disconnected (nice). So I called back, she didn't answer so I left a message. That was at 8am it's now 6pm and no phone call back. Geez that's great customer service.\n\nIf you have to go then go but if you can hold out for a better hospital then I recommend the extra driving in the end it will be less of a headache.", "business_id": "8rMSbtMFVtEien-2EfFu6w", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-11-09", "type": "review"}

We should have drove the extra few miles and went to Phoenix Childrens. This was THE WORST hospital experience I have ever had. \n\nWe arrived at 4:30. My daughters hand was sliced open and wrapped in paper towels. We had her blood all over us yet we sat in the initial waiting room for over an hour and a half while people with coughs who came in after us were seen first. I finally walked to the receptionist window and asked if it would be possible to get some sort of bandage for my daughters hand as it was bleeding through the paper towels. She said \"There is toilet paper in the bathroom.\" Seriously? 10 minutes later the triage nurse came out and looked at my daughters hand and said \"meh, its not that bad and wrapped it and went back in.\"\n\nwhen we were eventually seen by a different triage nurse she commented on how bad it looked and how she would \"fast track\" us so that we would be seen sooner. she then proceeded to tell us they are not really equipped for small children and that if they needed to sedate my daughter they would need to transport her by ambulance. So, if you're keeping track, we went from being told it was no big deal, to being told it might be serious enough that we would need an ambulance. We were completely freaked out. JCL should probably train their triage nurses a little better, as parents with small children scare easily when their children are injured. \n\nWe were then moved to a SECOND waiting room where we sat for THREE HOURS! we sat and watched people with colds, aches and pains go back before my daughter. Keep in mind we were \"fast tracked\" yeah right. we saw two nurses looking at us and whispering and one of the nurses approached us to apologize for the wait and explained they were really backed up and a mistake had been made when we had been fast tracked. We were taken to a room (that was still being cleaned) and waited to see a DR. except a DR. never showed. We got a PA. \n\nWe waited, and waited and finally at 10:30 the PA called in staff to put stitches in my daugters hand. 30 minutes prior she had a nurse come in and clean her hand and apply numbing cream that was supposed to lessen the pain of the stitches. Right before they did the stitches the gave her a nasal sedative and said it would kick in instantly. Well as soon as they started the stitches my daughter was screaming at the top of her lungs. She was in pain. They gave her a shot of lidocain and continued. She was still screaming. I asked the PA if she was sure it was numb and she said \"oh yes, she's probably just crying because of the pressure. My daughter is 2 and knows pain. She was screaming ow every time she put the needle in. it was awful. she required 5 stitches on her tiny hand. went in at 4:30, got out at 11:30.\n\nWhen we took our daughter to her follow up appointment with her pediatrician he commented on how poorly the stitches where done.\n\nNever coming back here.", "business_id": "Z9ogOCIkHasuKVELa8mQ_w", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-11-03", "type": "review"}

She is savvy with insurance, warm with patients, funny and so very kind!  \n\nI can cite lists and lists of reasons why you should visit this Dentist...\n--My son fell off the jungle gym (or something like that) at school and dislodged a tooth - and Dr. Simpson checked his tooth immediately upon arrival, explaining what had happened and giving us our options.  It was a baby tooth, but my son was pretty shaken up and we wanted to make sure it could stay in his mouth for the balance of it's short life (it did!)\n--My husband (then fiance) hadn't had his teeth cleaned in a while and wanted to have then cleaned and x-ray'd....only to find out he had periodontal disease!  Dr. Simpson was on it immediately and I am told he enjoyed a thorough cleaning with some relaxing gas and tunes from his iPod - reportedly the most comfortable cleaning of his life (seriously?  I think they scraped his teeth down to the roots!)\n--And ME!  I have pretty good teeth but Dr. Simpson reminds me of how to keep them that way, and he's saved me from a couple exposed roots and some tricky plaque deposits!  Whew!\n\nWhat makes this more impressive is that we tried to LEAVE Dr. Simpson when insurance issues made it tough for us to stay...and we tried another dentist and everyone BEGGED me to let them go back to Dr. Simpson.

He was my wife's doctor for our first pregnancy and we had lots of questions. Appointments lasted 3-7 minutes. At one, I brought a notebook with several questions written out. As I went through the questions, Dr. Nelson gave answers such as, \"Google that ... doesn't matter... Google that ... Don't worry about it... Google that one... etc.\" He had no interest in giving us information. \nWe had a difficult labor/birthing process. My wife's water broke before any pre-labor or contractions or anything. We were already 6 days late, and figured the baby was on the way, so we went to the hospital. The hospital gave us a 24-hour deadline to deliver the baby because of risk of infection. So we went through different stages of induction, and none of them worked, and Dr. Nelson was not present for anything. He spoke to my wife once on the phone to scold her for not being induced days earlier, which was something he had mentioned as an option. He said on the phone she would probably have to have a C-section because she didn't listen to him. This was very frustrating because we actually did want to listen to him and get advice from him, but he never gave us any instructions, and when we were at the hospital he wasn't there, so we went along with the recommendations of the nurses. I feel his attitude toward my laboring wife was completely inappropriate. \n36 hours after the water breaking, Dr. Nelson said he would come in during his lunch in a couple hours to do a C-section. We asked if he could come in sooner. Since the C-section seemed inevitable, we just wanted to get it over with. Was he upset that we wanted him to come before his lunch? \nDuring labor, my wife's epidural did not work; she still felt the pain of contractions. This was concerning as she was about to have major abdominal surgery, so we expressed concerns. The staff assured us she would be numb before surgery. The anesthesiologist gave my wife a \"spinal\" since the epidural wasn't working. Unfortunately, this only worked halfway. They did this test where they poked the location of the incision with a needle to see if my wife was numb. She was not numb on her left side. They asked, \"Are you sure you feel sharp pain, and not just pressure.\" \"Yes, I feel the sharp pain.\" Their solution to my wife's numbness was to use local anesthetic, which numbed only the surface of my wife's skin, and Dr. Nelson did the incision. As the other parts of the surgery progressed, my wife was pleading with the staff to stop because she could feel the pain of the surgery. I don't know why Dr. Nelson did surgery on my wife when she wasn't numb. I've heard from a couple other doctors that they would never perform surgery on a patient who wasn't numb. They said to me, \"I don't know what he was thinking.\" He continued with the surgery while my wife pleaded and cried, and once he got my daughter out, he gave some signal to the anesthesiologist who pumped her with something to knock her out.\nOn top of all of this, my daughter almost died. I doubt this was Dr. Nelson's fault, but her first \"breath\" resulted in her completely blocking her airway with mucus or something. Staff had to work on her for a while before she was breathing on her own. It was traumatic.\nAfter surgery, my wife had a horrible recovery. She could hardly move or walk for a couple of days without a lot of pain, and she experienced moderate pain and difficulty for weeks. My wife's second delivery also resulted in a C-section, but the recovery was way faster and better. Every decision Dr. Nelson made resulted in more pain for my wife. The way he handled her organs and uterus; the way he performed surgery on my wife who wasn't numb, and the way he had a student or intern stitch her up all caused my wife a lot more pain compared to the second time with a much better doctor, Doctor Grayson Guzman. It was as if Dr. Nelson was taking out his anger on my wife.\nI suspect Dr. Nelson resented my wife and shared frustrations with his colleague, Dr. Erin O'Sullivan, since she also scolded my wife. At 4 or 5 am on the first night of our stay at the hospital, there was this knock on the door, and Dr. O'Sullivan came in and turned on the lights. We were both in a daze and had no idea who this woman was, but she introduced herself and proceeded to tell us off. \"Hi. I'm Dr. O'Sullivan and I work with Dr. Nelson, and just can't believe that you wouldn't take Dr. Nelson's advice. He has a great C-section rate, and you're ruining it because you wouldn't listen to his instructions. It's your fault you had a C-section and I don't think it's right that it's going to reflect badly on him. \" She said something along those lines and left. Her only intention for coming into our room was to spite my wife. I don't think I've ever experienced anything as rude or unprofessional as the actions of Dr. O'Sullivan that night. It was awful.", "business_id": "nEaJwY77drRqQkJqcd9LRg", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-09-16", "type": "review"}

It seems she has a penchant for targeting people's most sensitive topics for some really inappropriate and unfeeling comments.  Could this be a bad habit, emotional obtuseness or is it condescendingly deliberate?

I'd had a bad experience with Dr. Nelson with the delivery of my daughter in 2009 (Considering him to manage your pregnancy? Don't do it. He's dangerously incompetent.) Due to my not wanting to see Dr. Neslon, I decided to schedule with Dr. O'Sullivan. Big mistake. She is bitter, angry and *unbelievably* unprofessional. This woman is a poor representation of the medical community. She started off by noticing that I'm starting a topical progesterone supplement this month. And so she asked me who had prescribed it, and I told her it was my physician who manages my thyroid condition. She asked me right away if it was a \"Naturopath, or something like that?\" & I informed her that, it was an MD, Integrative Medicine who had prescribed it for me. She then goes on to ask me what am I trying to achieve. Umm...  I told her hormone balance. Duh! WTH do you think I'm trying to achieve? I explained that we had tested my levels and my progesterone level was low. She proceeded to ask me what my symptoms were. Basically, I felt like she was grilling me as to why I would be supplementing with progesterone. Aside from the fact that my freaking blood tests showed it was low? She then goes on to say \"Well, the only proven benefit to supplementing with progesterone is sleep. It's not going to help with weight loss, or anything like that. Generally speaking, if you're still getting your cycle then you are fine, and I would not recommend supplementing with progesterone. But hey, sleep is important too, so that's okay.\" I'm sorry, but #1 I never mentioned weight loss (I'm already at a healthy weight) and #2 I'm pretty sure that progesterone supplementation is proven to correct a low progesterone level. How about that benefit? So then she is asking about other things and I mentioned that I'm in the early stages of a separation/divorce. She then tells me how she thinks happy marriages rarely exist, and how she knows maybe 2 happy marriages out of all the married friends she has. Well, that's uplifting. Thanks, Doc. So a little later in the conversation she goes on to say how awful the dating scene is today, and that \"It's really disgusting out there. These women think they're okay since they've been married/only with one person for all these years, so they go and have sex with some guy whose slept with 300+ women while you've (she's) been married all those years. And they end up with herpes.\" And then she follows that lovely story by telling me \"The only people who are dumber than my teenagers are the 40-something divorced women.\" I'm pretty much in shock at this point. So she goes on to say \"... So just be sure and protect yourself and use a condom when you're out there sowing your wild oats\". I could not believe my ears. My family life is falling apart, the last thing I'm worried about right now is \"sowing my wild oats\", and even of I were... what a $&*# stupid and wildly unprofessional thing to say to a patient, or anyone, for that matter. I think she's the most unprofessional physician I've ever encountered. Needless to say, I'll be finding a new OB.", "business_id": "nEaJwY77drRqQkJqcd9LRg", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-09-22", "type": "review"}

After finding them on an internet search for prenatal services, I called and spoke to a couple of women.  After answering many of my questions over a few calls, I was ready to make an appt.  ask me what my choice of Dr was and I simply ask them to set me up with the one they preferred... enter, Dr. Gregory DeSanto.\n\nI was always told that picking your maternity doctor was quite the chore.  It's joked about in movies and a matter of stress for many women.  I'm a lil more laid back than the average woman about such matters but, after I met Dr. DeSanto, I really didn't see the need to go to a dozen different doctors and stress.  He's relaxing, knowledgeable and does things himself that other doctors pass off to technicians - like my ultrasound.  He did an excellent job explaining everything he was doing, getting great angles of my lil baby and even showing me the gender before others say they can tell.  It was the most amazing experience to see my lil guy flipping around!!  I'd heard other women say that their ultrasound tech didn't tell them much and actually had them worried by not talking and explaining things but, there was none of these issues with DeSanto.  I'm a fan of his calm demeanor and simple, easy-going approach to things.\n\nThe reason for taking away a star is that on both visits, I've felt there could be a lil more communication with the the ladies in the office.  The first visit, I told them on check-in that I had 2 appts and even wrote in the information on the sign-in sheet but, they never sent me down to my first appt.  I didn't know there's almost no wait time at this clinic, (unlike other doctor's offices) so I sat there waiting forever and finally ask when it was almost time for my 2nd appt. because I was afraid they were going to overlap.  Luckily, they were able to fit me in for my 1st appt after my 2nd appt but that whole situation could have easily been avoided with a lil more communication.  On the 2nd visit, after my weight/vitals check, I was told to that I needed to start a test but then she left me without any instructions on where to go or what to do after that test.  I think it was assumed I knew the drill already because I am in my 2nd trimester, but that was only my 2nd appt.  \n\nThose lil glitches were barely noticeable though compared to the satisfaction I feel with the clinic overall.  \n\n* Dr DeSanto is knowledgeable, calming and explains things well.  And Jamie was so helpful with many of my misc. questions and helping me get set-up!\n\n* They have their own lab and ultrasound machine in their clinic so you don't have to run around, wait, or make separate appts for lab work!\n\n* Everyone is friendly enough and it feels like a cozy, comfy environment.  \n\n* There is little waiting time before your appt starts and they must keep gaps in the day because you can get in to see the Dr. in a timely manner.\n\nI'll be back next month for my 6 month check-up!\n\nSee ya there!", "business_id": "ZcaBYLRDDY4ecAPDGWBQzA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-11-06", "type": "review"}

As a previous reviewer mentioned, she was laptop-focused and efficient.\n\nLeft a quick sample (verified hematuria w/in a few minutes) and received an order for anti-biotics (to fight off any potential kidney infection) and an ultrasound - and told to try and get one right away (to look for stones).\n\nGot an appointment and took care of the ultrasound that afternoon.\n\nThe following evening I experienced some pretty severe flank pain in the middle of the night, but it subsided on its own.  I logged into their patient portal and left a note to that effect.\n\nTwo days later, not having heard anything back (odd as the radiologist's office indicated results would be sent to my PCP next day), I called the office at around 1:45p, and was told that the NP had not reviewed the results yet, but that they would take my callback number and send her message to review the ultrasound.\n\nAt first, I was kind of annoyed, but then, I was actually kinda of happy to hear that it wasn't a priority (must not be that bad).\n\nLater that afternoon (~5:30p), I receive a message via their patient portal from the NP asking if I had gotten an ultrasound and rather curtly telling me that I really need to go get that ultrasound...  HUH?\n\nSo, I sent a reply letting her know that I had gotten the ultrasound and contacted the office earlier that afternoon.\n\nThe next day, I get a call from a pleasant person from their office (not an NP or doctor) letting me know that a doctor had reviewed the ultrasound, and it was clear/normal (no cysts or stones).  OK - cool.  So, of course, I asked, great, what next?  I'd really like to get to the bottom of this... And the answer was literally, \"Well, I don't know, but at least the ultrasound was clear!\" (and I could hear the very genuine smile on the other end).\n\nIt has been 3 days, no response to the message I sent in reply in the patient portal.  No follow-up.  No posting of the ultrasound results to the patient portal.  Nothing.  Silence.\n\nMaybe my expectations are skewed, as I have been somewhat fortunate in never having any real medical issue to date, but when I see myself pissing blood and have unexplained flank pain, I really, really wanna understand why - and I kinda feel like my care provider would generally follow-up quickly on something like this - or at least tell me if there's nothing to follow-up on.   \n\nReally.  You don't even have to call me.  I like technology.  Use your patient portal and copy+paste your notes... Really.\n\nAt the end of the day, I suppose I'm responsible for my own well-being though, and so I will.  I've got an appointment with a new doctor tomorrow afternoon :-).  Maybe it's nothing.  Maybe it's something, but I'll keep looking until I find a care provider that can/would-like-to help me find out.", "business_id": "0-KOpYSe9aQTAfM38f47HQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-10-13", "type": "review"}

In comparison the office appeared mildly run down.  There was a slight hiccup in my paperwork, there was another patient in their system with the same name, but the office staff was organized and proficient enough to rectify the issue seamlessly. \n\nI've read a few negative reviews (not on yelp) on this office, particularly pertaining to the office staff, so I think I'd like to offer my two cents. The office staff does not have the bright perky young receptionist feel that I've come to expect in a stereotypical Scottsdale private practice.  The office ladies will probably not light up when you walk through the door or make small talk. They, however, work in a matter of fact manner and seem competent and accretive.  They needed minimal information to get the insurance information for my visit and realized their mistake in assuming I was a different patient instantly.  Others who are expecting and that may be accustomed to a cheery greeting might find the demeanor of the office cold, however I find that they are simply busy at their work.\n\nThe ophthamic assistant/tech was friendly, she managed myself and another party with two young boys rather well, with minimal waiting during the exam preparation process without rushing anyone.\n\nThe optometrist, Dr. Christensen, was very patient with me.  I had been neglectful in taking my contacts out before bed, and he gave me a gentle warning that this was causing visible scratching and scaring on my cornea without making me feel uncomfortable.  He took the time to explain the development of an astigmatism in my right eye, and gave me a cost comparison on the normal lenses I was accustomed to and the toric ones I could buy for the most clear vision.  I was given the opportunity to try both types of lenses (the normal ones and the toric) and he was completely unbiased to the options that I had to choose from, which was appreciated.\n\nI liked the lady who helped me pick out my frames at the end of the visit.  I had a good idea what my insurance covered (VSP), but wanted to verify it, and she was very knowledgable and helpful.  She calculated the difference in cost on whether using my insurance benefit on my frames or lenses (as it would only cover one) was more cost efficient so I could make an informed decision.  I picked up a pair of Dior frames that were discounted to $189 (before my insurance coverage) and I'm super happy with the find!  I was informed that my glasses would be ready in 1-2 days, which was more than reasonable.\n\nOverall, I would recommend Paradise Valley Eye Care, especially to those who have eye insurance coverage.

In October 2012, I came to this establishment saw the doctor and received the prescription. I did not get my glasses right away because there was a mix up with my insurance and I would need to wait until January until my insurance reset. \n\nCome the new year I called the office to set up time to get my glasses. At this point Paradise Valley Eye Care had informed me they did not have my prescription on file because I saw Dr. Christiansen. Well come to find out the doctor had no record of my visit. It was not until April that they found my prescription and had it sent over. I went and ordered my glasses-finally there was light at the end of the tunnel! My appointment was for early June to order pick out my glasses. I was told my glasses would take 2-4 weeks to arrive. July comes around and I have yet to hear if my glasses had arrived. I called the office and they stated my glasses arrived three weeks ago. Assuming positive intent and the possibility the my cell phone did not receive the call, i let it go. I went in to try on my glasses and became incredibly sick due to the stigmitism. They said nothing could be done and I would need to see the doctor again to be re-examined. I had my appointment the next day and it was determined I would not need a prescription with stigmitism. Reordered my glasses and started to play the waiting game. \n\nAgain I was told it would take 2-4 weeks. 4 weeks had gone by and again I never heard about my glasses and had to call. Again I was told I was called 3 weeks ago and they had my glasses. I had them double check the number to make sure they were calling the right person, my information was correct. I arrived at the  Paradise Valley Eye Care, and the ladies at the front desk had informed me I must have been mistaken because they did not receive my glasses and did not give me a call. I reminded them that I called them and they told me the glasses were there. After more research the front desk had said that they had record of the glasses being received and even signed for them-but they could not find them. They offered to have me pick up a new pair of glasses and wait 2-4 weeks or go with the ones I had. I really liked the ones I picked out, so I decided to go with the glasses I had originally picked up. Again the same old story, I would need to wait 2-4 weeks and they would call me to pick up my glasses. As you can imagine the same situation occurred again, where they \"supposedly called me\" and the glasses were there. \n\nNow on September 14th, I went in for hopefully the last time to get my glasses. Again tried on the glasses, and what do you know-they only removed the stigmatism from one of the lens. So I knew immediately when I started to get sick. Come to find out there were two prescriptions, one that showed no stigmatism and the other that showed one. Ironically they could fix this problem on the spot (It is my wonder why they did not do this the first time around)-Finally after almost a year of getting my initial eye exam, I have my set of glasses. \n\nNow Eric and some older women who would not give me her name (which I found really odd) were very sympathetic to my situation. They gave me a eye glass case, a pretty one. But truth be told after this ordeal I expected something more than a damn eye glass case. In summary this office is unorganized, unprofessional, horrible customer service and a place I highly recommend on not using. The office had several opportunities to show great customer service in all of my times that I went back to the office-but they severely failed every time!", "business_id": "7hmTTGJHKfAw82uT4kIxvQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-09-14", "type": "review"}

Do NOT go to see Dr. Erica N. Bigos  (formerly, Erica N. Elannan). I have never had any issues with my teeth. I had a cavity that I got in my 20's. The filing was getting old and I had it redone. About 6 months later I changed dentists to Dr. E bc she is a cosmetic dentist and I was interested in pursuing veneers for my two front teeth, which are mainly composite (from a gap that never closed with braces and from several chips).  After her first visit with me she told me the tooth I just had the filing redone on needed to be crowned because there was a lot of decay. She appeared to be very knowledgeable and I went ahead with her proposed treatment plan.  She's very personable and makes you feel great, like she's the best in the business, don't bother driving to Scottsdale she says, bc she can give you best treatment in Anthem, same lab, cheaper price, and her work is perfection.. so she says. Getting the crown was extremely painful, it did not go without a hitch, and after this experience I would not get veneers in her office. I referred my husband to her for a cleaning bc new patients got free teeth whitening. My husband went and got his teeth cleaned and walked away with a laundry list of items he needed to get done, including more crowns. After getting a second opinion, he did not need the work she recommended, he did not trust her integrity and never went back. I stayed with her bc I had a routine cleaning coming up. During this visit she said I needed another crown on a tooth where I had a filing. Apparently her x-ray showed decay and in her ledger notes she wrote I needed to get it \"taken care of ASAP or risk a root canal\". This concerned me, bc my typical appointments with dentist run very smoothly, aside from the 2 cavities I had in my early years. After a second and third opinion, I was told her assessment was absolutely ridiculous, no crown was needed. I gathered my xrays and records, including her ledger notes, and had them reviewed by two other dentists. The crown she did put on my tooth (the first real dental work I ever had) was never needed.  Three years later, the crown she put on my tooth fell off only to find out that she mined my tooth down to nothing and there was no tooth structure left in which to put a crown on. I have rare and extreme curvature in my roots and will possibly need oral surgery and an extraction. SEVERAL other residents in Anthem have had similar complaints and lawsuits!........ Thank you to the wonderful doctors at Family Briggs Dentistry in Scottsdale and Dr. Robert Roda, President of the American Board of Edodontics, also in Scottsdale! Both are extremely highly recommended, very experienced, and highly credentialed dental professionals who took care of me. It took several months and many drives to Scottsdale to rectify what Dr. Bigos did to me, but what I learned in this experience is DO YOUR HOMEWORK. If you don't trust my review that is fine, do your research and you will find the complaints and lawsuits bought up against Dr. Erica Bigos (formerly Elannan). You may have to dig, but they are there. I find this article interesting and speaks to her character: http://staugustine.com/stories/121608/news_121608_002.shtml \nNorth Valley Family Dentistry did pay for ALL of my treatment to have my tooth rectified... as they should have!", "business_id": "iIIuKm65Uv5EmZ44TJiIOw", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-09-02", "type": "review"}

They are very competitive with their pricing too. I have referred friends to them that got estimates from other companies and Desert Dentistry more than beat their competitors. Its nice not to pay an arm and leg for stuff insurance won't cover. Thank you so much Desert Dentistry for everything you do!

He's truly exceptional and terribly pain relieving!\n\n(Although I guess he could get a lower rating for being too far from my house, but really, that's not fair and he's overcome that objection by being so awesome.)\n\nA few months ago I was in a lot of pain. I called 2 other Chiropractors near to my home and explained the pain and my severe, nearly immobilizing, discomfort.  Much to my chagrin, they mentioned that they could schedule time for me 2-3 days, even a few weeks, out in their schedule. I couldn't believe it. I was nearly crying on the phone.\n\nThat led me to YELP and to Dr. Nemanic.  What happened on the phone with him was as remarkable as what happened in the office.  \"Can I see you in 45 minutes?\"  he said!  Yes, in less than an hour I was experiencing less pain that I had experienced in months...and just weeks before my summer tour of Utah and Iowa and Wisconsin, I was able to sleep through the night without waking up in tears.  \n\nDr. Nemanic not only adjusted my back and neck to ensure a predictable and continued recovery, but he offered additional advice on other areas of intrigue (my legs not pointing forward, my lower back pain, my workout efforts, etc.) and encouraged me to move forward slowly but surely into a healthier status that I was before the fateful \"fall\" that brought me to his doorstep in the first place.  \n\nI highly recommend this Dr. no matter where you live in the valley...drive there, enjoy the experience, and don't forget to thank me and the other YELPers who have led you to this place of blissful painlessness.", "business_id": "wNzNiCNab2FqXxcTlXYYEg", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-10-03", "type": "review"}

Although there are reviews for this office they are over a year + old so here is a current one. \n\n I took my daughter here for an issue she had from a previous dentist and the doctor we saw was OK BUT the billing practices are to say the least questionable! I gave them my insurance information on the spot and was told they would get back to me on the cost of the work that my daughter needed to have done. Later that evening I actually received a call from the office requesting I pay my deductible right then. I advised I would not do that and wanted to wait to see what the actual bill came to after going through my insurance but they insisted it was a \"fee for service\" based office and I needed to make that payment. \n\nI obliged and sent in a check for the full deductible against my better judgment and I WAS  RIGHT!  A few days later I got an explanation of benefits from my provider that stated the \"contracted and allowed amount\" was only 1/2 of what they charged me for. After a lengthy and frustrating call to their \"office manager\"  she insisted I was incorrect that they had a \"fax\" that showed what I should pay \"if I came in she could show it to me and go over it with me\" and I would have to call my provider. So, as if I get paid to do their job,  I took time from my own business to do their job and spoke with my provider and again I was RIGHT. \n\nThey are trying to charge me for charges that were not allowed by my provider..... When they finally  receive their copy of the explanation of benefits (not a generic fax) they will see they were incorrect. Now, lets just see if they make right with me and refund me the amount I overpaid. \n\nKeep in mind the next visit they wanted me to just hand over  $ 617.00 because they said that is what that charge will be...

I know I chose the latter for a good portion of my life and knew the day would come when it would \"bite\" me in the butt.....sorry. Low and behold at the ripe age of 31, 16 years since my last visit to a dentist, three wisdom teeth decided to show me who's boss. Looks like this dental plan is about to pay off...\n\nI'm in a new state, I don't have a dentist or a doctor....... or a psychiatrist (if you were curious). Where do I go? Luckily I have a boss and friend named Amber Williams (plug) who pointed me in the right direction. Also conveniently located around the corner from my place, Today's Dental was the \"place to be\". Nervously, I made my call to schedule an appointment and was immediately put at ease by the almost impossibly friendly staff. But I knew what was coming, they couldn't fool me. \n\nIn I walked and signed in at the front desk, their smiles and helpfulness, there's no way this is real. I was called in and taken on a tour of the facilities, and I thought that was very very very very cool for some reason. I must have looked like I was 6 years old walking around there. Like a giant 6ft 3in six-year-old. I got in my room and there's TV's on the wall, on the ceiling, all playing Sports Center, are you *^&%^*&ing kidding me??  I was so excited at this point I didn't care what they did, just let me sit down and you guys can get to work. By the way, I'm sorry if this is not at all exciting to you because you go to the dentist all the time like a normal person, but this is crazy to me. \n\nIn short of losing site of the actual review I'll sum this up. My dentist was Dr. DeMark and he's pretty much the coolest guy you could ever hope to have ripping bones from your head. I was at no time uncomfortable and actually wouldn't have minded another 20- 30 minutes. He really might be the coolest guy I've ever met in general now that I think about it. Believe me, this was no easy surgery, but I walked out of there with a giant swollen smile on my face. I was thoroughly educated in how to take care of myself during the healing process and got a phone call later that night from the Dr making sure I was alright and checking that I understood what to do. I mean if this is the typical experience then I'm surprised, it was a pleasure all around and I will never go to another dentist. \n\nIn short, if you're like me and have been an idiot for not going to the dentist, or if you're new to the area looking for a new dentist...go here...because I said so. I honestly can't wait to go back.", "business_id": "CGne_Sr7m9HT4ztsWQw6Aw", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-10-27", "type": "review"}

Wow!\n\nSarah, the dentist hygienist finished up the exam (ditto above adjectives, really so nice) and then I was scheduled to do the extensive dental work just two days later (turns out I needed work on two teeth and a second crown had to be made).\n\nWednesday - Met again with Dr. DeMark (superhero of dentists in my opinion) and Yhony, his assistant (ditto above adjectives). My gums were numbed with topical ointment first (always appreciate that) before Dr. DeMark did the injections (which he did very easily and quick - thank you!). Both were so great - explained everything, worked quickly/confidently, answered questions, and entertained me with goofy dentist silliness - as they fixed my dental dilema.\n\nI couldn't believe they fixed the first tooth and gum as fast as they did and then started on my second issue. I loved watching Yhony sculpt my new tooth on the computer (still think he should have signed his initials to that work of art!).

We looked through the selection of frames that I had gathered and she gave me opinions as to which she liked and why one would be better suited for my prescription, I never felt pressure to leave or be rushed, she looked up my insurance and explained in detail how it worked, then kindly thanked me for coming in. I was so impressed I scheduled an appointment for my husband that same day, and yes they stayed for me to accomplish this as well.
