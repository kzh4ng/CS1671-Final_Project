I've visited Whole Foods locations around the country, but this Pittsburgh location is one of my favorites. It's a small store, but it feels homey and comfortable.\n\nStaff: Most of the staff members are super friendly and willing to do just about anything to help you find what you are looking for. I had one staff member begrudgingly help me out, but I assumed he was having a bad day or was very busy. Either way, it's nice to treat others with respect. \n\nThe cashiers here are so fantastic. They are never rushing and throwing food into bags. They take their time, ask you questions and treat you like a person instead of another number in a long line. \n\nDeli/Made-To-Order: The deli and made-to-order foods are currently my favorite. Sometimes I would rather spend $20 on lunch here with my boyfriend than go to a restaurant or get fast food. My favorite is the vegan chicken salad on foccacia bread. I adore this bread. It's just the right texture, it's nice and herby and deliciously buttery. Topped with swiss or muenster, it's a super delish sandwich. If I am extra peckish, I get extra veg. chicken salad. Yum yum yum! \n\nThe tomato bisque they have is something I newly tried. I'm very picky about my tomatoes and tomato products. This soup delivers. I wish I could have it every single day. It's so phenomenal! My boyfriend got it today alongside a cheddar biscuit that paired beautifully with the soup. \n\nCheeses: If you want fancy gourmet cheeses, the Whole Foods deli counter might be the best choice. We purchased a small amount of Midnight Moon Goat Cheese Gouda and made the most expensively delicious grilled cheese sandwich. We're grown-ups now, say goodbye to gross American cheeses! The cheese counter is so great because all of the cheeses are labeled with the kind of rennet used in the processing. You can easily find a high-quality vegetarian cheese with just a glance. The cheese experts are also willing to talk cheese to you for as long as you like. \n\nStore Selection: Overall the store has great options, but they don't carry everything that I wish they did. Unfortunately, they discontinued one of my favorite products - Field Roast Deli Slices. They bring in new and trendy foodstuffs though, so it's enough to keep me happy. \n\nWhole Foods can be pretty expensive, but if you don't fall for the tempting packaged foods, you can get away with a reasonable grocery bill! I primarily shop here for special items though. \n\nP.S. Their selection of natural body and haircare is great and affordable.

And boy have they been a great choice!\n\nOn my first visit it was Easter and I wanted to bring a treat for the family. The staff member who helped me suggested the cinnamon bread. It was probably one of the best decisions I've ever made. Not only was the bread fresh, but the cinnamon sugar was throughout the entire bread. There wasn't one piece, or complaint, from anyone about it lacking flavor (as cinnamon breads can sometimes be as you get to the middle of the loaf). As the holiday went on, many family members were grabbing it instead of a cookie or other treats around. I did also grab a few \"Almond Torte Bites\" instead of the full torte to give it a try as well. Even though they are good, they are VERY sweet and not what my tastebuds are looking for. I was very glad to have gotten the bites instead of the larger cake itself.\n\nMost importantly, the staff was super helpful, patient, and attentive even though the store was in full swing, with a line basically out the door.\n\nMy most recent visit was today for #nationaldonutday! There are a lot of options, but there is something about the traditional glazed donut that takes the cake. I don't remember the last time I had a truly good homemade donut like this - it literally melted in my mouth. There's also something nostalgic about it that makes you feel like you're reliving a moment in your grandma's kitchen.

I've always found the service to be friendly at both locations, and the treat to be just the thing for either a hot summer day or warm summer evening. Bring friends. There's really nothing like sharing an experience like this with friends. That's how I first learned of this place, when friends from work invited me along for a Friday afternoon \"meeting\".", "business_id": "ciRNik0_EdguibEypTspFA", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-06-19", "type": "review"}

If i have one complaint, it's the excessive use of butter, which I can taste on my lips after every bite of almost every item on the menu. Then again, butter makes it better right?", "business_id": "2r8jGeuYvMkyP2ik_X-Bxw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-07-04", "type": "review"}

So finally I got to try cheesecake from the factory - at one half of the listed price.  I went by myself and ate my treats in private because I didn't want anyone to see what a junkie I could be over cheesecake. \n\nCheesecake!  Instead of 8 bucks, I paid 4 for a slice and decided to get two.  Yes, two slices for the price of one.  Ordered the plain slice because I wanted to taste it naked and also the Dutch Apple Caramel Streusel.  And you know what, I even asked for a slice of their carrot cake which was $8 (full price because it wasn't national carrot cake day).  \n\nIt was national cheesecake day - did I mention that already? - and I couldn't wait to taste what I thought would be the best damn cakes in the cosmos. \n\nNot!  Not!  Not!  So ssaaad.\n\nI must have set expectations too high, because I was not impressed.  My naked cheesecake tasted like it was thinned out.  The dutch apple tasted better with better crust too, but not enough for me to give accolades.  And the carrot cake tasted like it didn't have regular flour in the mixing.  I can't really describe it, but  you know how there are sharp notes and flat notes in music?  Well maybe there are sharp flours and flat flours in baking, and this was made with a flat flour.\n\nI dunno.  Didn't finish either of the 3 treats.  Needless to say, I won't be considering any of the other flavours.  Not even on next national cheesecake day.  \n\nHowever, I may be back for a salad or salmon rolls.", "business_id": "2r8jGeuYvMkyP2ik_X-Bxw", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-08-10", "type": "review"}

It's definitely one of my top two lunch spots for yummy quick eats.  I've sampled quite a bit of the menu and my second favorite sandwich is the O'Keefe.  It's basically chopped chicken, saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, melted Swiss, avocado, lettuce, tomato and honey mustard served hot on a soft baguette.  The honey mustard gives it just enough tang to really bring out the flavor of the seasoned chicken.  My only \"beef\" with this sandwich is hot lettuce.  I'm sorry, but there are some things in this universe that were not meant to be, and lettuce being served on a hot sandwich (or on a hot Mexican food plate; more on that later) is not one of them!  \n\nMy most favorite sandwich here is the Symphony.  I like to think of it as a turkey club with a twist.  It's loaded with fresh turkey breast deli style meat, bacon, avocado, tomatoes, LOTS of alfalfa sprouts, cream cheese and mayo on wonderful 12 grain bread.  I usually hold the mayo, because that's just the kinda guy I am.  You might say, that's how I roll. But I say, I'm just not a mayo kinda guy...\n\nThe best part about lunch at Sacks is the silver dollar sized warm chocolate chip cookie you get with your sandwich.  And yes, it's been reported that the Tiki sometimes eats the cookie first, but having no photographic evidence, you can't prove it and I'll plead the 5th.  And speaking of tiki's there's a really cool Tiki at the Tutor Time just a few doors down to the north.  Check it out!\n\nOkay, I said the cookie was the best part of lunch at Sacks, but I lied.  The really super dooper best part about lunch at Sacks is the Market Spice Iced Tea.  Some days it's too weak, some days it's too strong, but on the days that it's just right, it will blow your socks off, so you might want to bring an extra pair, just to be safe!\n\nMy only dislike about Sacks is that is can get pretty loud at lunch.  It's usually crowded between 12-12:30 so I try to go early or after 1 pm.

The most popular question is often \"what is the alcohol content in this?\" If you get there too late for the sofas or tables, you will be seated in white plastic lawn furniture accompanied by TV trays. \n\nThey can only seat 45 people. The tasting starts at 6 but people start getting there as early as 4. Depending on what they're tasting it could be full before 5, certainly 5:30. You can find out what they're tasting by subscribing to their email blast or reading it here: http://cavecreekwines.com/discussion (You can also read about the other fun stuff they organize here). \n\nFair warning: There's no warm fuzzy apology or begging you to come back another time if you get turned away. \n\nYou can bring your own snacks and buy a bottle (or glass) to enjoy while you stake your claim to seats for the main event. There are quite a few regulars but they are welcoming and friendly. Don't be afraid to share your snacks with them. \n\nShortly before 6, Bob (of Bob & Lisa, the owners) will make an announcement that the food is ready. You can help yourself to bread, olive oil, cheese, grapes and, usually, some hot item like brisket, ravioli or meatballs. Though, sometimes it is a cold item like pasta salad. \n\nTasting starts promptly at 6. Make sure your cell phone is off and plan to pay attention or you'll get teased. Another warning: there will be a joke of some sort. \n\nUsually it is a distributor doing the presentation. Sometimes, it's the actual winemaker. \n\nEach of the 6 generous pours, (probably close to 2 oz. each) is introduced. You will learn something about the grape varietal, growing conditions, the winemaker, the region, the process... and, by tasting it and hearing the explanation so close together, over time, you will learn to discern what you like and why you like it! You can and should ask questions! That's how we all learn!! \n\nFinish your pour before they come around with the next one. There's no waiting. You snooze you loose. And, for God's sake, it's not like it's a full glass - no dumping! If you don't like it, surely someone else near by will finish it -- at least offer! ;) \n\nThe wines that are tasted are 10% off that evening. \n\nOne last tip on how to find it: it's on the northeast corner of Cave Creek and Rose Garden. The first light north of the 101. It's behind the Shell station, and the most visible sign simply says \"WINE\" in red letters. \n\nSeriously, it's a great value. I've been going for about 3 years. For about 2 of them, it was my Friday evening ritual. I learned a lot as a result. I'm grateful. I'm paying it forward...", "business_id": "bo7pxmvcRlZURzhfmIL4zw", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-08-16", "type": "review"}

The smoked mozzarella pasta salad entered the realm of the inedible and found its way into my garbage can. If I lived closer, I would have returned the poor excuse for lunch. The issue was that they undercooked the main ingredient - the pasta. The tubes were hard and the salad was loaded down with so much mayo that it seemed like i would have been eating mayonaise salad had I continued down that path. Also, the Hatch chiles they claim that they put in the salad could not be tasted and the cayenne pepper kick that identifies this salad was not there either.

I have been making it a conscious decision to get nearly all of my produce here now. I also buy my bread, raw honey, and dates here. Why do I make the extra effort? Because the fruit barn is that incredible. Here are just a few examples of why I love this place...\n\n1. The staff is \u00fcber friendly. Anyone who says otherwise either came on an off day or a super busy time.\n\n2. The prices are incredible. Some of the prices may be comparable to grocery stores, but never higher AND a lot of the prices are MUCH lower. \n\n3. It is a small local business. I love that I get to support this business and they are providing my family the best quality products they can. Grocery stores don't do that.\n\n4. After I shop there, I feel happy. Sounds crazy right?!? Have you ever been to Walmart? You know how you feel when you leave there... frustrated, exhausted, like you never want to go back? This is the exact opposite. In fact, I often call my husband to tell him how much I love the fruit barn when I am on my way home from there.\n\nSo if you have the luxury of living nearby (or just being nearby), go there. You will get some great produce at fantastic prices and you may just leave happier.  And if possible bring CASH.

I know the French Dip ($5.99) sounds strange on a bagel, but it was surprisingly really good. The roast beef was decent, and the garlic bagel he chose added a little something special.

Just a few days ago we went in and bought over two dozen packages of strawberries for 3 for $1 and chopped and blended for strawberry \"ice\".

I just wait until an hour - ish before closing time and everything is fairly quiet and sometimes they're putting out veggies for the next day. WOO HOO! Forget the early bird, I'm a night owl.\n\nAs for the \"weird smell\" as one yelper described, I ignore it. Truth is, I'm used to it and I know it's the same smell of any asian market, hell even parts of Chinatown in San Francisco. I've smelled worse things while traveling the world. Lee Lee's your typical Asian market (shout out to 99 Ranch in the Bay Area!), but better organized than other markets I've been to. The aisles are clearly marked - Chinese, Indian, etc. If you can't navigate it, then how you navigate the roads here makes me wonder if you should be driving at all.\n\nSince I'm hard pressed to find inexpensive Filipino food here in the valley, I find I have to make it myself. Lee Lee's carries all the stuff that I need to try (really, it's try, but never accomplish) and replicate my mom's dishes.\n\nIt's also really nostalgic for me as well when I go down the cookie/candy aisle and see things like the Strawberry Pocky sticks or the chocolate Pocky sticks...It reminds me of going to Japantown in San Jose on Sundays after church so mom could get the ingredients for her menus of the week. But what really makes Lee Lee a winner in my eyes is the desserts from Goldilocks Bakery as well as their assortment of breads.\n\nI'm a total starch slut, so seeing Pan de Sal and the Filipino desserts makes me happy. I buy a few things and then put them in the fridge so I can munch on them during the week.\n\nI also love their frozen food section as well - you can find such a variety of frozen potstickers, Indian food, sea food...it's a wonder one even thinks of going anywhere else.\n\nI like Lee Lee's a lot and their selection of fresh fruits and vegetables is one of the better places in the valley...unless you support your local farmers.\n\nService can be rude, but I don't expect hearts, flowers and puppies in places like this.

Ok, not really, but the moment you step inside Lee Lee Market, you'll feel like you've been transported to a different part of the world.

Granted, some of it I will never buy (pig heads, chicken feet, live catfish, and what is that crazy looking fruit!?!) but you are guaranteed to come across something new every visit. Definitely worth an hour or two of your life to wander through the store! \n\nIf you're looking for a specific item, call ahead or go straight to an employee for help. While items are grouped together by type (cookies, fruit, noodles, spices), not everything is organized logically. Sometimes you'll find foods stored together by country (Vietnamese foods, Thai foods, etc), but certain ingredients will be in another part of the store. Ask for help if you're unsure. Large selection of beer and booze that is reasonably priced. Produce is always fresh and you'll find a much larger variety than an American supermarket. If you eat a lot of rice, buy in bulk (giant bags are right by the entrance).  \n\nThey have a jewelry store inside the supermarket, but I've never purchased anything there. One section of Lee Lee Market has trinkets, home decor, and traditional oriental items that you can give as gifts.

I don't love the tables and chairs, definitely not the most plush but serviceable.\n\nThere is a counter - complete with a bakery case - where you place your order, When it is busy you have to wait in line and are assigned a table - during slower times you just sit wherever you'd like. \n\nThe staff are all really nice and helpful.\n\nThe food is delicious. It is a bit expensive for a fairly casual place, but the quality makes it worthwhile. My favorite meal is breakfast - the demi breakfast, pancakes, and bakery items are all amazing, especially the blueberry scone! I always think of scones as being dry and not very flavorful, but theirs are exactly the opposite: moist and tasy, served with a ramekin of whipped sweetened cream. My husband and I always split one with our breakfast. \n\nDinner is great, too - my \"go to\" is the Flatiron Steak with Mr. Pibb Marinade and Fresh Veggies, super good and a perfect portion ($19) Don't leave without dessert! The Red Velvet Cake or Ice Cream Sandwich are perfect to share (the ice cream sandwich is made with two big chocolate chip cookies and vanilla icecream, cut into quarters) If you're too full, get a Salt River Bar to go (Salty and Sweet gets me every time) \n\nThey have some cool local beers. mimosas for brunch, and good coffee - their Peppermint Mocha (which is a seasonal Christmas drink) is my favorite.\n\nWeird note: Don't miss the bathrooms - each bathroom has a different theme with decorations and a specialized soundtrack (farm, recipes, Tuscany). Very fun.", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-06-14", "type": "review"}

When you are ready you place the order and then are seated if it is busy they give you an number and assign you a table it is very convenient so there is no confusion on where to sit. I have eaten here a few times and have ordered breakfast, lunch and dinner at one time or another they have never let me down. They always have amazing weekend specials that are well thought out and executed by the chef.  If you like coffee or love coffee like me you have to visit the coffee bar for anyone of the drinks. We will definitely  be going back on a more regularly basis.

Most of the time I can get what I need on my grocery list, but there is the occasional time that I will need a specialty item that I'll have to drive down to AJ's for. I do have a few issues with the store, one being that there are never enough cashiers on hand. It seems that every time you get in line to check out, there is only one register open and 10 people in line. Also, I cringe when I have to go to the deli counter because the service is usually atrocious. Nine times out of 10 there are a few workers behind the counter, but rarely do they look up at you, or if they do acknowledge you, you will end up waiting until they are done slicing their meat or mixing their salads or whatever else they're doing that is more important than waiting on the customers. I don't find that to be the case at the meat and seafood counter. I have always experienced the meat and seafood folks to be very friendly and helpful, and answer any questions that I have about cooking fish or how to season things, etc. Overall I continue to shop at Safeway because I like the family friendly store, I like getting discounts on gas, and it's a well maintained and clean location.", "business_id": "CxgFoyQl_EDf2uyVnU1Gsw", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-06-10", "type": "review"}
