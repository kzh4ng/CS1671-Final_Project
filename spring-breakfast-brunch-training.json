I decided to explore the McKees Rocks neighborhood and came upon Marge's Place.  I hadn't heard much about this place, but after reading the few reviews I could find, I decided to give it a try.  \n\nInside, it's bigger than I expected but still has that down home diner feel.  My guess is that most of the people there were regulars.  The wait staff was friendly to those they knew but also welcoming to me, someone they had never seen before.  I picked a table in the corner so I could observe what I imagine was a typical Sunday morning.  I ordered the breakfast special: 2 scrambled eggs with bacon, potatoes and toast.  Any place that has Mancini's Italian toast already gets thumbs up in my book.  Being in McKees Rocks, though, they really don't have a choice.  The potatoes were thin sliced with onions and very flavorful.  The only way I can think of to describe the bacon is...porkier.  Is that even a word?  I just don't know how else to descibe it.  The combination of foods was served in generous portions at a great price (under $5).  \n\nOne random note: I liked the tables and chairs.  They were comfortable not just for sitting and enjoying a cup of coffee with my morning paper but also very comfortable for sitting and eating.  Good distance between the table and chairs.  That may sound silly, and I thought so, too, at first.  But when I go to a place and the booth is too wide or too narrow, it can hinder my enjoyment.  \n\nNot only will I return, but I will also recommend Marge's Place to anyone in the area.  It was a surprisingly good find.  I like places like neighborhood businesses like this where they make everyone feel like they belong.", "business_id": "r8BwdblCW-ZUES37BL0khw", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-03-13", "type": "review"}

Once you enter the doors of pancake heaven you are greeted with friendly staff and the delicious smells of pancakes and meat on the griddle and other various breakfast aromas.  We came Sunday for breakfast and, boy does this place fill up!  \n\nThe Dor-Stop has gained fame from Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives, but that's not what I care about! I just want the food!  So, that's what I did, I ordered the food after ordering my coffee.  Their menu has all of the classics including their signature pancakes, omelets, french toast and eggs cooked to suit.\n\nMy coffee cup and water were kept full and while sipping on my caffeinated beverage, my meal came.  The Dor-Stop produced my order of two eggs over medium, and two large banana, chocolate chip pancakes.  I was speechless once I took a bite of that cakey, breakfast goodness (the pancakes not the eggs!).  The pancakes are really delicious. They have the perfect texture, the perfect taste, the perfect look, the perfect smell... need I go on?  The eggs were good too, I don't want to leave them out, but what egg is going to win again the battle of pancakes v eggs?\n\nBreakfast Breakdown,\n\nThe Food: Delicious!\nThe Value: I believe my two egg combo was $7.99. Breakfast for four with coffee was close to $40. That's not too bad.\nThe Experience:  It's a small restaurant full of happy people! I happened to glance at the table next to us  and saw the breakfast burrito.  It's massive!\nWould I return?: Why, yes. I wish I lived closer so I could eat them every Sunday.\n5 stars?: I've been to a restaurant that claimed to have the best pancakes in the world.  They were wrong. The Dor-Stop has the best pancakes and for not claiming to have the best, they get 5 stars, because these pancakes were heaven sent!\n\nBonus game!: How many times were pancakes and breakfast mentioned in this review?

Note I definitely said TRIED, as if you arrive after 11, you better be very patient.  This place is small and people love to relax and stay a while.  However, this is one of the few spots I will leave the house for before noon on the weekend.\n\nYou might have seen the spot on the Food Network.  If not, look it up.  The owner and her daughter are crazy endearing.  The focus here, of course, is on the pancakes.  This is the only place I know of that serves pumpkin pancakes year round, and it is for a reason.  These are dense and sweet, enough that even I don't syrup them.  A little whipped butter in a paper souffle cup and a dash of salt (hey, don't knock it 'til you try it), I can clear three or so in a few minutes.\n\nThey also have staple breakfast items, along with the jumbot. At least one of the guys in my party always goes for the ham on the bone/jumbot.  If you can fit this thing in your body, go for it.  The only other unique item to try would be the stuffed french toast.  Personally, between syrupy fruit filling (compote is too kind a word for this ice cream topping inside) and then topped with more fruit syrup, it tastes more like a heavy dessert for me, but I know those who swear by this as their weekend treat.\n\nIf you find yourself on the other side of the Liberty Tubes on an early morning, you need to go get pumpkin pancakes.  You can even call ahead for it to be ready for take out and avoid the mess of hungry Dormont-ers along the Potomac sidewalk, but then you'd miss making new friends with your slightly brash waitress and the infamous specials on the tiny chalkboard.  Either way, depending on your timing, this diner will hit the very top on your breakfast list.", "business_id": "2Igiyhi82R8_QaaPplRmCw", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-03-20", "type": "review"}

Expect to hear some good music, too (Bowie, Creedence, the Dead). In the wintertime, you can warm up by sitting at the counter across from the grill and watch your sandwich come to life in front of you. Just remember, it's cash only.\n\nIf you're coming in for lunch, and not breakfast, I recommend the fish sandwich. It's of Lenten church fish fry quality, flaky and greasy and crispy all at once.

These types of menus are generally red flags for me because they say: I can do a breadth of styles good, but not one style great.\n\nWe started off sharing the mezze plate.

I have always been curious about the Wrigley Mansion so I was excited when we made plans to go here for Easter brunch. \n\nThe brunch was good. Our server was friendly and funny. There was a decent variety of food and it was tasty. My only complaint about the food would be the desserts. They were not labeled, the cakes and pies were whole so people cut their own slices and they became a mess. Overall I just wasn't impressed. I've seen better dessert spreads at casino buffets. \n\nAfter the meal we wandered around the building, exploring the rooms, peeking around corners and checking out the history. The bummer is that it's obvious that the money isn't there to keep this place looking its best. Some of the bathrooms were run down (burned out lights, doors that didn't lock), in one room the curtains were torn, walls and flooring showed signs of wear and tear, and furnishings just looked tired in places. It wouldn't take much to clean this place up and have it look amazing. I'm sure when the Wrigley family lived here it was incredible and it's sad to see such a great home being neglected. I'm sure if they fixed it up they would book more parties and weddings and it could be a prime location in town. \n\nI hope someone will take the time and money to invest in one of our rare glimpses into Phoenix's past.

Nice.\n\nWe got there early to avoid the crowds and it was perfect. We were also greeted instantly and told to sit wherever we wanted. The server showed up faster than if I had a magic wand. He informed us of the specials while he got our drink orders going as well as bringing us a complementary plate of some of the best tasting buttery croissants I have ever had before. We asked a few questions and he happily answered us with no hesitation and was most informative.\n\nWe started with the Smoked Salmon Quesadilla with Dill & Horseradish Cream for $10 and it was delicious. For entr\u00e9es, the ladies ordered Saut\u00e9ed Salmon with Herb Rice and Basil Beurre Blanc for $12.50 and Beef Bourguignon with Mashed Potatoes for $14. I selected the Seafood Skewer with Pesto Sauce and Scalloped Potatoes for $13 off the specials menu. We were all amazed at how nicely the vegetables were cooked just right. The fresh ingredients, textures and flavors were spectacular with all the dishes. Could not help asking for another plate of croissants to sop up all the extra juices and sauces since I was told by the wife not to lick the plate. When we thought we were done the server brings each of us a small plate of flourless chocolate cake topped with a mini scoop of vanilla ice cream and a drizzle of chocolate syrup.

But a few notes: no, it is nothing like a European cafe; no, it is not an actual wine bar; yes the service absolutely sucks.\n\nWe came here for a friend's birthday party. Her mother had arranged ahead of time for 10 of us to be there and to have wine brought to the tables and poured and some appetizers brought out while we were waiting for the guest of honor. But before that, let's start with parking. \n\nYou can't park in the residential streets because you need a permit. Fine. I heard they had a valet and there's nothing on their website about parking so, whatever. I head to the valet who asks me if I am dining at Postino's or La Grande Orange. I say Postino's and he says \"Ok, that's $3.\" I asked if they seriously were charging me for valet parking based on which restaurant I was going to and they wouldn't answer. I asked if there was an ATM since I had no cash and they told me there is one but it doesn't work. I got back in my car and drove around looking for a place to park for about 15 minutes. Fantastic.\n\nWhen I get there, about 6 girls from the party are standing at the front waiting for someone to notice them. Finally, a very unfriendly gentleman pointed to two tables and said \"Those are yours. Those other tables where people are eating are also yours but they're not done yet. We told them when they were seated they needed to be done in an hour but they're still there.\" Ok, so now we only have two of our four tables. Great. Finally they seat us at our two tables. Another unfriendly staff member comes over and plunks down a few wine glasses and asks if we want a glass of temperanillo. She pours one of the girls a random taste and then walks away. Upon her return I asked if this was the wine we were supposed to have because it was a Malbec. She argued with me about that for a few minutes until I pointed to the label. She said \"Oh\" and walked away. I never did find out if we were supposed to have the Malbec.\n\nAt this point, the other two tables had been cleared. No one brought any other glasses or put the tables together, so we did it. Also, no one opened the other bottles, and yes they were screwtop, but still. So I opened them. Finally, everyone else arrived. We still only had 4 wine glasses. After trying in vain for several minutes we finally managed to flag down the unfriendly woman and asked for more wine glasses to which she responded, rudely \"We don't have any more.\" and walked away. I had to ask three different rude, uninterested staff members for wine glasses and managed to finally get another few but still, not everyone ended up with a glass. \n\nSeriously? Anyway, the bruschetta came out. While the menu offers a lof of different ones, they are all so deplorably bland and under-seasoned that they felt unfinished. The fig, marscapone and prosciutto should have been good but the poor pig that gave its life was disgraced. Dry, flavorless. Most of the bread pieces weren't even cut all the way through so we were all man-handling the pieces to get them apart. The bread was obviously just grocery store bread and I doubt anything is truly hand-made. The issue is, the quality of their ingredients sucks. They obviously buy the cheapest grocery store crap they can and then mark it up. Everything, even the apples on one of the bruschettas were lacking in any real flavor when they should have been tart and crisp instead of dull and mealy. \n\nAnd as for a wine bar? Seriously. A joke. They have a half of a sheet of paper, one side, as their wine list. No flights, no tastings. But for the audience it attracts who are easily impressed by over-priced glop and wine in a trendy area, they'll continue to do just fine.

My girlfriend got the carnitas burro and was very happy with it, but she agreed the chicken is where it's at.\n\nWhen we went in, it was about an hour to close, so the place was mostly dead, which may be why our service was so good. But, they seemed to genuinely want to make their customers happy, so I wouldn't be surprised to see the same level of service when it's busy either.", "business_id": "qgJZUKNVY-LbGKk6XEP3JA", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-03-23", "type": "review"}

When I enter the restaurant I get a homey feeling which scream: Mother/daughter date.  My favorite part of this restaurant is the breakfast food.  Lunch/dinner aren't that great to mention.   However they do have coupons for dinner which give you starter, entr\u00e9e, and dessert for a good price.  So for that reason only I would go for dinner.  \n \nNow on to the breakfast.  The meals come with your choice of juice and some even come with a muffin.  My favorites on the menu are the eggs benedicts.  For the original: the flavorful ham center the dish.  It's a bit tough for me and the saltiness overpowers the dish.  But it does add a nice contrast to the gooey egg and sauce.  I would say the eggs are \"over-cooked\" for egg's benedict compared with some other restaurant.  I would've preferred over-easy or even over-medium eggs insteads for an eggs benedict.   The hollandaise is thick enough so that it isn't runny that would drench the dish, however still thick enough to have that creamy consistency.  I wish it had more flavor though.   It comes with red skin potatoes on the side.  With just the right amount of salt, it complements the eggs benedict well.  Try the florentine, and crab cake florentine eggs benedict for a twist on an old favorite.   \n \nWake up early for breakfast or brunch for an eggs benedict and shop 'til you drop at the mall after you have satisfied your tummy.  However don't expect too much from this mediocre restaurant unless you have a coupon. :D", "business_id": "-6Roo-EHgSdUa4rP3tWyRw", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-05-15", "type": "review"}

I wouldn't classify it as an overly greasy , greasy spoon.  I think it's a very comfy place that reminds me of little Mom and Pop's from back east. Since I seem to stick to the breakfast MO... it's been good each time.  They have good diner coffee, nothing exotic, nor was I expecting it.  The waitresses are all very nice, with just the right amount of chattiness to make you feel at home, but not too much.  My breakfast today was a mushroom and cheese omelette + spinach.  My plate of food was huge and very tasty and with Coffee and Tax only $10.  I'll have to stop by here more often.\n\n- Mushroom and Swiss Omelette + Spinach", "business_id": "bEQjf7c-9qkNWgXvriSGZw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-05-07", "type": "review"}
