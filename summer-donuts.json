But hey, hard-core mustard fan as I am, I know better \nthan to start the day with all-you-can-sample-mustard, right?\n\nSo the BF and I surfed Yelp to find a decent breakfast stop and Lo, right down the street from our campground was C's, so we figured we'd stop in.\n\nNow, it was Father's Day, which we realized when we walked in, cause the place was packed. \n\nIt's pretty much your standard breakfast food, with some specialty bakery fare.

(This made me happy, as I like meat at breakfast after a night of rainy camping, but am allergic to pork.) The skillet had turkey, potatoes, onions and green peppers mixed together, with toast and 2 eggs on top. The eggs were perfect, which impressed me, given how crazy busy the place was. I do have one complaint about my food 'tho, the onions, peppers and potatoes were not cooked enough for my taste. In fact, the onions were damn near raw. Luckily, they were finely shredded, so it wasn't too bad, but I take away a star for that .\n\n(BF says his potatoes were underdone too. Not raw, but not quite done enough.)\n\nWaitstaff was very good about keeping coffee filled. And, since it was a bakery, we HAD to at least try a cinnamon roll.  It was a good roll, and they even warmed it up for us. \n\nI noticed that they had a LOT of baked goods specializing with Strawberry and Rhubarb, which is in season right now. To me that's a good thing, even though I'm not big on rhubarb. Tends to indicate a reliance on seasonal (and hopefully locally grown) produce. \n\nIt being Father's day, they had a special on Steak and Eggs and a fresh berry topped waffle special too.

I asked if they were as good as Rainbow, but she had never tried Rainbow.\n\nSo - we decided to do a taste test.  Three of us in the house - so we would get 3 different (but like) donuts from each.  The plan was to bring them back home, cut to sample size, and note flavor, texture and overall preference.\n\nThe guy roommate's favorite is glazed raised.  The gal leans to sugar raised and I figured glazed old fashioned is a safe baseline for taste testing.\n\nWe went to Rainbow first.  No problem getting the donuts we wanted.  I also picked up a half dozen donut holes.  Was not thrilled to be charged $0.50 for the box, but c'est la vie.  Girl roommate also got a watermelon frappe type of drink.  A bit sweet for my tastes, but very, very watermelony.\n\nNext stop Bosa.  They didn't have regular sugar raised - used powdered sugar instead.  (I have a hard time trusting that the regular sugar didn't stick - somehow they managed to make it work at Rainbow!)  So the granulated vs. powdered sugar raised would not be as scientific a comparison, but we'd make do.  No problem with the glzed and old fashioned.  We also picked up ham and swiss croissants.  One can never have too much pastry, right? :)\n\nResults - \n     Glazed raised - Bosa was slightly denser and chewier - more mouth satisfaction.  Rainbow was cloudlike fluffy and light.  Great texture, but we didn't feel satisfied from chewing.  Rainbow was slightly sweeter.\n          ~Votes - 3 for Bosa.~\n     Old Fashioned - textures were identical.  Rainbow had a slight lemon (or maybe aspatrame?) flavor in the back end of the tasting.\n          ~Votes - 1 slight lean to Bosa, 2 Draw~\n     Sugar raised - texture of donut was identical to glazed raised above.  (duh - same donut, different topping.)  The gal roomie likes granulated.  The guy roomie preferred the powdered.  I liked both.\n          ~Votes - 1 Bosa, 1 Rainbow, 1 Draw.\n\nSo, Bosa comes out with a slight edge.  And we came out with a slight sugar rush.

So close to work and VERY good quality donuts! My boyfriend and I were thinking about going to a different donut place on lunch but we didn't like how greasy they normally are. We were driving around work, seeing what other places we could check out. We decided to drive down Charleston and passed by a place called \"Real Donuts\". We were thinking, \"Real donuts? As opposed to fake donuts?\"\n\nWe stopped in and there was a super friendly person in front. I saw a ton of cake and crumb donuts, my two favorites. Heaven. Already. After looking around, we were asking a ton of questions wondering what we should get. We planned on only getting a few, maybe one for him and one for me. Well, that went out the window real quick.\n\nWe started with a blueberry cake with white icing.. then moved to a bavarian creme filled chocolate glazed donut. After that, it was all bad. We found out that they had a blueberry fritter, my boyfriend's favorite thing in the world. We got two of those. We got an orange glazed cake donut, a crumb cake donut, a crumb covered apple cinnamon filled one... We decided to just go with the dozen at that point and decided to get everyone on our team donuts. We got a cinnamon roll, a cinnamon roll mixed with devil's food cake, some swirly one that I forgot what it was, a chocolate cake donut with chocolate icing, a regular cake donut with chocolate icing. I honestly don't remember all of the donuts that we got but the guy in front ended up throwing another one in for free. Then... we asked about one last donut and he ended up throwing that in for free too! So awesome!\n\nI was weary of the orange-glazed donut but it was so amazing. It tasted like a creamsicle. The blueberry cake donut was SO flavorful, I couldn't believe it. I really am stuffed and my whole team was raving about how good the donuts were. I didn't want to end up eating all of the leftovers, for sake of my hips, so I walked around my office and started handing them out. Everyone was talking about how good they were!\n\nI will definitely be coming back. The service was great. The quality of the donuts was AMAZING and the flavor was perfect. I can't wait to come back and try all of the other donuts we didn't get this time.", "business_id": "259TmptwDUjXWgPlKf52Tw", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-06-29", "type": "review"}

I got the maple bar and a regular glazed donut. Both were soft, sugary treats which I inhaled in less than 2 minutes.

It took until I had enjoyed one of their creations through a reseller (The Goodwich) that I really experienced the magic.\n\nRegular donuts are $1 each, but nobody is really going to buy just one. More likely options are a dozen regular donuts for $9.50 (max. 2 jelly-filled donuts) and half a dozen donuts for $5 (1 jelly-filled). They have higher prices for fancies ($1.50/$8/$15). I was actually looking for the day-old donuts but missed the boat on it. I guess they must sell out of those close to their opening hour of 4am (your time to shine, early risers).\n\nSo yeah, that blueberry fritter. It was my magical introduction to Real Donuts. It's not apple (which is also good). It's better. Sweet, moist, crunchy, blueberry-y, Not sure what more you can ask for... except a second. I also tried the raspberry jelly-filled donut and the maple cruller on day 1. There is an absurd amount of jelly in the middle of that treat, but thankfully it's not too sweet. The cruller is pretty airy and reminds me of cream puff dough. Almost feels like a healthy option... almost.\n\nNext day, I finished the rest of the donuts off. I guess I got the day-old donuts that I wanted after all. The orange cream glazed donut was okay but didn't stand out. The cinnamon raisin bun was still very moist, and it was sweet without having a huge portion of glaze as you might see as other places. The old-fashioned chocolate donut was pretty average too (note to self: skip). Finally, blueberry fritter #2 was just as awesome as the first.\n\nDefinitely would recommend Real Donuts for people who are in the area or who are donut fans. Haven't thoroughly explored the rest of the Vegas donut scene, but I'm already pretty confident this place will end up as one of the mainstays.", "business_id": "259TmptwDUjXWgPlKf52Tw", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-07-25", "type": "review"}

The maple & peanut covered cinnamon rolls, cherry frosted french crullers, bear claws, the classic Simpsons doughnut (pink frosting & sprinkles), maple bars, and nearly everything in-between. \n\nNot to forgot my savory side, I also bought a jalape\u00f1o croissant stuffed with turkey, swiss cheese, and chunks of my favorite spicy pepper.

This treat is a must if your taste buds like to live on the spicy side. \n\nBefore I left I asked about the two giant doughnuts that looked like they were drawn on a board behind the cash register.

This last visit I stopped by in the early afternoon and they still had a good variety of donuts available. Inside is small, but it was packed with customers. I like that they keep fresh stuff coming out throughout the day. The workers are always nice and upbeat. There is a check-in offer on yelp for a free regular or filled donut and they are good about honoring it. A half dozen donuts only set me back $5 which is a good price and the donuts tasted great. They have coffee and other pastries available also including a couple of donuts that are larger than normal in size and usually require some notice to ensure being able to grab one, so call ahead. This is a hole in the wall donut shop that's been here for a long time and for good reason. It's not the decor bringing customers back it's the friendly employees, fair prices and most of all delicious donuts in my opinion. \n\nInverted Cinnamon Roll - This one has swirls of devils food cake in it. Easily one of my favorite donuts here. The donut is just nice and soft and has great flavor. I'd recommend getting at least two.\n\nInverted Chocolate Iced - Not swirled with devils food cake or cinnamon like the previously mentioned, but still sporting princess Leia buns covered in chocolate. I wish I had saved this one for the following day with my coffee, it would have paired better. I enjoyed the donut however it was a bit heavier than the nice and soft inverted cinnamon roll and could have handled being dipped in coffee or tea just fine.\n\nBlueberry Fritter - Very good! When I heard they had apple and blueberry, I decided to try the blueberry and my hubby went with the apple which I sadly didn't taste. I loved the texture of the blueberry fritter and I tasted blueberries in each bite. \n\nTwisted Chocolate Iced - I picked this one out because it was covered in chocolate and looked good. When I got home and took it out of the box it resembled a wiener and balls to me. Oh well it was tasty and I swallowed the whole thing.\n\nFilled Bear Claw - Very good. This donut was a good size and nice and soft with a good amount of apple filling inside. They also have smaller bear claws that are not filled if that's your thing..\n\nRaspberry Filled - The outside of the donut was glazed nicely and inside there was a fair amount of raspberry filling and it tasted great.", "business_id": "259TmptwDUjXWgPlKf52Tw", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-06-05", "type": "review"}

I don't even like donuts but those were very tasty.\nAll vegans visiting Las Vegas should go buy a box. Do it or you'll go hungry! :)", "business_id": "w4SGmsvFzqyAIs7CSQ_J-g", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-07-23", "type": "review"}
