Despite the 20 minute trip from my house, I purchase all my cakes from here. The cakes are incredibly moist and the butter cream icing is just the right amount of sweet. My favorite cake is a yellow cake with FUDGE icing (not chocolate but FUDGE)!! I've also had the raspberry filling and would recommend that as well. They are incredibly creative with their decorating of the cakes including wedding cakes but if you want something specialized (nonstandard icing, etc) be sure to call ahead and place your order in advance. Warning: Saturday mornings you will surely encounter a very, very long line whether picking up your order or just swinging by for some goodies. \n\nEven better than their cakes are their petit-fours (chocolate with chocolate icing or white with vanilla icing). I've ordered them for bridal showers or just stopped by to pick one up for myself. They are the perfect size for one person (if you aren't on a diet). They do sell out of these so place an order ahead of time if you want a large order or stop by early in the morning to make sure you can get them. \n\nI've gotten cookies from here and they were average. I think this is the best bakery in the Burgh for cakes but not necessarily all other pastries and breads. \n\nThe only reason I didn't rate the bakery 5 stars is their customer service which is borderline horrific. They are never friendly and whether you are calling to place an order or standing at the counter, they just want to get the order taken and move on to the next person in line. The cakes are good enough that I put up with the service but be forewarned.", "business_id": "7wT532x2Qz5Hw9BqtBapqw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-08-30", "type": "review"}

I love that they have slices of many of their cakes and cheesecakes available for individual purchase.  I purchased an assortment of these to take to a dinner party and they were all gobbled up and it was a great way to allow everyone to try small bites of a variety of treats.  My personal favorite was the Chocolate Mousse cake because I love chocolate and it was sweet without being overly sweet, creamy, with the right balance of sweet and bitter from the chocolate.  I also sampled the tiramisu which was delicate with just a hint of espresso and the cream was perfect.  The best thing was that while the desserts were all obviously sweet they weren't so sweet that it was sickening as I've experienced with more commercial cakes from grocery or big box stores.  The other cakes that I bought and all of which the dinner attendees loved were the lemon cake, the oreo cheesecake, one called the sweet spot that had chocolate and peanut butter, and finally a white cake with chocolate frosting.

Paddy Cake is an old school bakery, and it may not be one of your new-fangled bakeries like the French joint in Squirrel Hill with pastries that you can't pronounce that look delicious but end up tasting like old parchment, but this place is a great bakery! \nYou will find homemade breads and rolls, cookies, cakes, pies, along with some very delectable pastries, all with names you can read and pronounce. Some of my favorites are the cherry & cheese turnovers- they're called double or half/half or something- because they have a cherry side and a cheese side. Best of both worlds! And the breads & rolls, of course I am a bread girl.... They have the best chocolate thumbprints, hands down! And even though I am NOT a doughnut person, I find myself nibbling on a doughnut when the BF brings them home. \nIf you like grandma's old fashioned baked goods, you'll like this place, if you like le almond croissants or le chocolat whatsacallit, then maybe not.", "business_id": "Msfys8NloDpAsWmhvC9T6A", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-06-23", "type": "review"}

I had been wanting to try Pitaland since I first saw it on the boulevard and was excited to finally make it there.  Whenever we finally made it inside, it was not what I had expected but in a good way.  The store was super clean, bright and open with an olive bar, central aisle of grocery items, deli and then a food counter with bar seats.  They also have some tables outside so that you eat there if the weather is nice.\n\nFor my lunch entree I decided to go with the chicken shawarma in the donor size while my father went with the gyro in donor size.  While we were ordering I noticed a rather clever tip jar sign that had something to do with \"pita\" spelled backwards.  After placing our order we decided to sit inside at the counter on this day since the sun and humidity outside would have made for a miserable experience.  After only a few minutes of waiting, our lunches were handed over to us.  My chicken shwarma came out to me on a large pita with lettuce, pickle, onion, tomato and what I think was a a garlic mayo sauce?  The size of the pita was pretty large and I knew that by the time I was finished that I wouldn't need anything else.  Sadly I was disappointed with the sandwich and that mainly had to do with the chicken.  Since it was done rotisserie style I thought that meant that the meat would be good and moist.  However, it ended up being super dry and seemed to be overcooked as well.  The rest of the sandwich ended up being good though and I really enjoyed the larger pickles that were in my pita.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I might head back here again in the future.  While my chicken shwarma ended up being somewhat of a disappointment to me I think that this place has potential and I would like to give it another try.", "business_id": "gCiKiqPGAC_ZVt5bBcwnrw", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-06-03", "type": "review"}

I can't say much for their other treats as I have partaken in few. However, the Burnt Almond Torte will not disappoint..unless you do not have a palate.\n\nI keep the logic with food simple- if a place is \"famous\" for serving a specific item then try it. In this instance, the Burnt Almond Torte is a heaven sent delight. The two layers of moist light yellow cake suspended creamy rich custard, covered in lightly sweetened and fluffy pastry cream with an outer layer crusted with toasted sweet glistening almonds. \n\nI am thankful I did not discover this dessert until I was married. I would have easily polished off this cake after a rough exam or breakup. Fortunately, my husband can share the caloric intake with me. Then again, for those with more self-control they offer a significantly smaller ration in the petit four style presentation. I have also had the pleasure of tasting this version which did not disappoint.\n\nNow for some other items on the shelves. ..the brownies look much more appetizing than they are in reality. The chocolate lacks richness and depth and the batter is drowning in nuts. It is one thing to highlight a brownie in nuts, it is another to forget you are even eating something other than chopped nuts. I've also had a few of their cookies. Hrmp. Nothing bad but nothing good that was memorable either.  I say stick with the torte. \n\nAlso, I must note that the wedding cake tasting is a complete disaster. No worries, I did not deduct points as I might have caught them on a bad day and I did not try the cake. Whilst still engaged two years ago...Prantl's was my top choice until I arrived for the tasting. Imagine many brides in such a small area and limited staff to assist- provided a cow-herd atmosphere to the tasting. Not my thing- I walked in and walked right back out.

As the bakery who baked our wedding cake.  When it came down to it, I knew from the beginning that I was doomed to have a Prantl's Burnt Almond Torte as our wedding cake.  This unassuming, simply decorated, flavor powerhouse is the epitome of love it/hate it relationships of those in the burgh...  and I happen to be on the love it side.  Our cake ended up being ABSOLUTELY fantastic.  Definitely not a looker, but man did she please.\n\nWhat didn't please us is the customer service.  After placing the order for the wedding cake at the Shadyside location, the wife and I followed up with a question at the Market Square location (we both work downtown and were told we could modify our order there for convenience).  What ensured was what I can only describe as a sales commission war, with the bridal rep downtown more or less abducting us from the Shadyside location and even calling us to complain when we didn't call her directly thereafter.  Up until we first saw the cake the day of the wedding, we honestly weren't even sure what we were getting (we had to actually calculate the bill for the rep downtown...  yea.).\n\nDespite all of this, I just simply can't bash the cake.

The combination of textures was the most unique I've ever tasted in a cake, and between the fluffiness, creaminess, and crunchiness, it was oh-so-satisfying.

And boy have they been a great choice!\n\nOn my first visit it was Easter and I wanted to bring a treat for the family. The staff member who helped me suggested the cinnamon bread. It was probably one of the best decisions I've ever made. Not only was the bread fresh, but the cinnamon sugar was throughout the entire bread. There wasn't one piece, or complaint, from anyone about it lacking flavor (as cinnamon breads can sometimes be as you get to the middle of the loaf). As the holiday went on, many family members were grabbing it instead of a cookie or other treats around. I did also grab a few \"Almond Torte Bites\" instead of the full torte to give it a try as well. Even though they are good, they are VERY sweet and not what my tastebuds are looking for. I was very glad to have gotten the bites instead of the larger cake itself.\n\nMost importantly, the staff was super helpful, patient, and attentive even though the store was in full swing, with a line basically out the door.\n\nMy most recent visit was today for #nationaldonutday! There are a lot of options, but there is something about the traditional glazed donut that takes the cake. I don't remember the last time I had a truly good homemade donut like this - it literally melted in my mouth. There's also something nostalgic about it that makes you feel like you're reliving a moment in your grandma's kitchen.

In addition to the wedding cake, the package includes cookies, 5 extra specialty cakes and chocolate covered strawberries. All of which are delicious.The only negative criticism I have is that the cake design did not turn out as glamorous and classy as I had pictured it in my head. However, I developed the design. If I would have went with one of the designs that they suggested, I'm confident that it would have looked better. The package also includes a mini ou wedding cake topper for your one year anniversary. Therefore, there is no need to freeze your cake topper and eat dried out cake for your anniversay. I loved our wedding cake so much, I'm having my husband order one for the birth of our first child, due in two weeks.  \n\nIn addition to a great deal for your wedding, Signature Desserts has awesome speciality cakes for birthdays, dinner parties or any excuse I can come up with!

I won't rewrite what I posted last year about our issues with the dessert table and the attitude of Linda, but what I am posting about now is our 1 year anniversary cake top.

This is not what our wedding cake was.  When I called and asked if there was a mistake I was told someone would call me back.  Of course, they didn't.  So, I called again and spoke with Steve who LAUGHED at me when I asked why we didn't receive a cake in our wedding flavors and then had the audacity to say 'well, you got a free cake.'  Really?!  It wasn't good and it was a plain cake I could have made myself.  When I said 'that's not the point' he said 'what do you want me to do?!  Another cake, fine.  When do you want to pick it up?'

Even when the place is getting slammed by waves of morning commuters looking for their sugar and caffeine fix, I always get a smile and courteous service.\n *  Always love me some free wi--fi.  Never had a problem connecting or with download speeds.\n * The noise level indoors always seems to be a soft murmur, with some relaxing music wafting in the background.  Never had a problem carrying on a conversation with my table mates.\n * When the FDA approves Alterra Coffee for intravenous use, I'll be first in line.  There are always are four or five roasts to choose from and I've never had a skunky cup.\n\nThings I don't\n *The \"cash only\" thing was so hip in the 18th century, but it's 2013 now.  Start taking plastic, people.\n * The baked goods are not inexpensive.  It's usually worth it, but it's annoying as hell when I lose the muffin lottery.\n\nIt's a solid three star option with lots of upside if the bakery improves its consistency.", "business_id": "ShEYKerTwb2LSORE5o_s7A", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-08-28", "type": "review"}

I do have one complaint about my food 'tho, the onions, peppers and potatoes were not cooked enough for my taste. In fact, the onions were damn near raw. Luckily, they were finely shredded, so it wasn't too bad, but I take away a star for that .\n\n(BF says his potatoes were underdone too. Not raw, but not quite done enough.)\n\nWaitstaff was very good about keeping coffee filled. And, since it was a bakery, we HAD to at least try a cinnamon roll.  It was a good roll, and they even warmed it up for us. \n\nI noticed that they had a LOT of baked goods specializing with Strawberry and Rhubarb, which is in season right now. To me that's a good thing, even though I'm not big on rhubarb. Tends to indicate a reliance on seasonal (and hopefully locally grown) produce. \n\nIt being Father's day, they had a special on Steak and Eggs and a fresh berry topped waffle special too.

I got a gyro sandwich and it was enormous, delicious, and only $4.50. \n\nI love Banzo, which is the obvious point of comparison for People's Bakery, but I'd probably choose PB given that the food is just as good an a whole lot cheaper.

The bread, cookies, bars, dessert loaves, etc. are all incredibly good and good every time: moist, flavorful, fresh, well seasoned, and wholesome. The bread is substantial with a well developed crumb -- not airy or light -- and that's the kind I like. \n\nThe occasional specialty breads are to die for. I once took a loaf of the monkey bread to work, and it was mobbed. People from the office made a beeline to Great Harvest to buy more to take home. Some of the savory items are just as good -- the pepperoni rolls in white and the heavenly veggie rolls in wheat (although they aren't available as often). They now offer sandwiches to go, but I haven't yet tried one.\n\nBut it's the day in, day out everyday loaves that make Great Harvest such a great bakery. Their whole wheat breads are especially superior -- chewy and richly flavored. Their white breads and challah are good, too. If the bread is seeded or includes something like nuts or berries, you can be sure there are plenty worked through or across the dough, too. And they will slice just about anything, unless it's a very odd shape.\n\nI've even tried their carb control bread. I won't say it is a good diet choice, because you won't be able to stop eating it. It's denser and less tasty than the regular items, but much better than the other low carb breads you'll find, even in specialty stores. Great Harvest also offers a brochure about making diet choices, for those with diabetic or other dietary restrictions.\n\nWhen you enter the bakery, you'll be offered a slice of bread, buttered and with jam if you want, as a sample. You'll also find some nice gourmet foodstuffs and kitchen items that go with the bakery theme. \n\nGreat Harvest Bread Company is one of our local treasures. Nothing at Great Harvest tastes like it comes from a franchised bakery, and in fact, owners of each shop are allowed (and often do) alter recipes and offer their own to suit local tastes and use local ingredients. \n\nI can't recommend this bakery enough!", "business_id": "-ACBdnpO32tpCaCQmScDGA", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-06-09", "type": "review"}

So I recognized immediately what Karsh's was using. Both cupcakes were made from a mix. The fudgy frosting is a commercial product. I know. I used it. The white frosting is made with vegetable shortening, not butter. The black & white cookie was like no black & white I have ever had. It was so thick and cakey- not at all a crisp cookie. Neither my husband nor I cared for it. The rye bread barely tasted of rye, although it had a decent texture. It was pretty heavy on the white flour. I've had better from Fry's.\n\nFor me, Karsh's was a big disappointment.

I ordered a birthday cake for my husbands birthday. i ordered apricot and it tasted more like pineapple or a sour peach, and the cake itself tasted like sponge cake. I called to complain and the \"manager told me to bring it in\". I was appalled that i had to \"PROVE\" it was bad.  When I got there she right away told me it was the apricot i ordered. i told her it did not taste like apricot (and neither did the other 8 people in our party) she tasted it and said its apricot. i said well maybe its a bad batch because it did not taste like the usual apricot we order or eat on their cookies. after thinking i was going to say okay and go home, i told her to take it to the owner so i could get my money back. they had me waiting for 10 minutes before this emormous man (6'6 and 340)comes out from the back room. He said with his deep voice  \"i tasted MY cake and its fine\". i could not believe this man actually tasted the cake. this just set me off. i told him you think your a big man and your going to imitimidate me by your size? he got sassy and said do you want me to get down to your level? i am 5'4. what a complete idiot. now remember i have been buying items at this place and their prior location for over 30 years. he argued with me for over 5 minutes and believe me i arged right back with him, he wasnt going to try to intimidate me (which i am sure he is use to because all of the employees couldnt believe i wasnt backing down to him).\ni am soooo disappointed with the actions of the owner and the manager that we will NEVER go back.

That meant I was going to miss my little sister's baby shower! :(  That made me incredibly sad.  What made me even sadder was her tearfully explaining to me that the baby shower her (bossy) mother in law was organizing for her was a hot-ass mess, AND that her mother in law was refusing to provide a cake for the shower!\n\n\"Ah ha\" I thought!  \"I can save the day from my hospital bed AND provide a kick ass cake for her baby shower!  Yay!!\"  \n\nSo I called Karsh's because they have some of the most YUMMYTASTIC cakes I've ever tasted...  Well, my first call to Karsh's didn't go so well because the first employee I spoke to didn't seem too interested in helping me AT ALL (it was close to closing time apparently) so I decided to call back the next day.  On my second call to Karsh's I reached an employee who said he was a manager, so I explained to him that I was stuck in the hospital, but that I would like to order a baby shower cake for my little sister's baby shower in a couple of weeks and that I would pay for it over the phone with my credit card and that my husband would pick it up for me the day of the shower.  He said he would be happy to help me with this order.  I told him what size I needed and what flavors we'd like for the cake and then he asked me about a decoration for the cake and I told him that her baby shower theme was baby turtles and baby owls, and maybe could they do something with that theme in mind...?  He said 'sure' and I assumed that dealing with a professional bakery and all, that they'd do something nice within those parameters.  \n\nHoly Mary, Mother of God, was I dead wrong about THAT.\n\n\nYou see the day of the shower arrived and my husband ran over to Karsh's Bakery and picked up the cake (and trust me, it wasn't a cheap cake) and then he brought that big, pink bakery box over to my hospital room so that when my little sister popped in to see me before going to her shower, I could surprise her with a beautiful cake to take to her party.\n\nWell, let me tell you what, my husband opened the tape sealing the edges of that pink bakery box so I could get a sneak peek and my face just froze in an expression of utter horror...  The idiots who decorated her cake over at Karsh's Bakery went and printed out an ugly black and green edible image of a giant sea turtle and plastered that monstrosity across the front of my sister's baby shower cake!!  And then in teeny tiny pink letters at the bottom of the photograph wrote \"Welcome Baby Emma\".\n\nI have never cried so hard in my LIFE!!  I think my nurses were worried I was going to go into labor I was so upset and sobbing.  Seriously, I was a wreck.\n\n\nI was crushed.  It was the ugliest, MOST disastrous mess you've ever seen.  I seriously cried for hours and I couldn't even look at my little sister when she came to my room to see what the \"big surprise\" was that I had for her that day.  I hid my face in my pillow quietly sobbing and pretended to be sleeping when she came by.\n\nIt was the most unprofessional thing you've EVER seen.  :(  \n\nWe should have taken a picture of it for the cake wrecks blog, but I was so distraught that I didn't want to look at it anymore.\n\nMy family still put on a brave face and took that monstrosity to her baby shower, while I hid in my hospital room and sobbed, and while everyone who saw it all agreed it was hideous, they also said it was quite delicious.  \n\nThankfully my sister was quite a good sport about it and thanked me profusely for the gesture.  I think she knew my intentions were good.\n\nSo there you have it; take it for what it's worth.  Karsh's makes delicious cakes, as long as you don't mind your 'adorable' baby shower cake looking like some Jacques Cousteau nature photograph out of a dusty old circa. 1960's textbook with some tiny, unprofessional greeting piped out frosting at the bottom of the ridiculous photograph.", "business_id": "vaqmESluryt5i4Wbkb6KRA", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-06-25", "type": "review"}

(You know, hungry and angry.) I couldn't decide where I wanted to eat and that meant my poor husband had to make a decision. Driving around downtown Scottsdale, my husband saw a new restaurant with bright colors and decided that would be the place. Unfortunately, there wasn't any parking out front, so he drove around back. After we got out of the car, he saw Au Petit Four and knowing that I love French food, decided to take me here. \n\nWe didn't look at the menu posted outside, just walked right in and were slightly confused. The space is rather large and sectioned off into two areas - a bakery on one side and a restaurant on the other. A man and a woman were behind a counter in the restaurant side and asked if we wanted to sit down and dine. My husband said yes and we were seated in the completely empty dining section. In the entire building, it was just the two employees and my husband and me. (Awkward...) There was plenty of seating and open space. The walls were brown brick with pictures of Paris scattering the walls willy-nilly and all tables were covered with plastic red and white checkered table cloths. I didn't particularly care for the table cloths because they stuck to my legs. \n\nAfter looking at the menu, I shook my head at my husband saying I wasn't sure what I wanted to eat. After much indecision (the poor waitress had to come back a few times) I finally decided on the prosciutto sandwich and my husband ordered a savory crepe. \n\nWhile waiting for our food, I went to the bathroom. It was down the long entrance hall, passing by several open doors to the kitchen/storage closets. The bathroom was in dire need of some cleaning and restocking (barely any soap and I used the last paper towel). \n\nWhen I got back to our table, it was only a few short minutes before my sandwich arrived and shortly after the crepe. My sandwich came with the option of salad, chips, or pasta salad. I went with salad. The salad was basically mixed greens and salad dressing on the side. (The salad dressing was good, but I expected tomatoes or something else on the salad.) The sandwich itself was really good. The prosciutto was thickly sliced with even larger slices/hunks of slightly melted brie. There was also pesto spread, tomatoes, and lettuce. Overall, I loved my sandwich. The bread was fresh and really hit the spot. \n\nMy husband said he liked he crepe, but he only ate half of it. I tried a bite and preferred my sandwich much more.\n\nOverall, the only good thing in the entire experience was my sandwich. The fact that there weren't any other diners during lunch, the bathroom was lacking, and the \"just ok\" crepe, I can't say that I will be back. There are plenty of other places to get fantastic crepes and fantastic sandwiches. \n\nPerhaps their desserts are amazing?", "business_id": "wftoNIA0Q8nX-Da47psBCA", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-08-16", "type": "review"}

While they looked yummy and simple come saturday they were hard as rocks...blah..I dont know when they baked these but it couldnt have been on Saturday they wouldn't have been hard already...reallly?", "business_id": "vv1uvJRBUqi707TA5GuhCg", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-07-09", "type": "review"}

I am seriously addicted to their Pink Champaigne Petit Fours (TO DIE FOR!!!), and their frosted sugar cookies are a big hit around the office! I haven't gotten anything here that hasn't been fantastic! One of the best tiramasus I've had in a long time, and their cupcakes rival Sprinkles all day long!\n\nAlong with the delicious treats and beverages comes generally GREAT customer service, the gentlemen that work in the afternoon are super friendly and helpful! I did, unfortunately, have one bad experience with the woman they have working there Mon, Tues, Wed. mornings, she was not pleasent or welcoming in any sort of way, and honestly made me feel like I was rather inconveniencing her by being there. I was SO shocked by the whole experience since I've been going in pretty regularly for a couple months now and had never had anything negative to say, until then. I remember thinking, \"Geez, I sure hope that's NOT Barb, and if it is, perhaps she's best suited for strictly baking...in the back...as far away from customers as possible!\" LOL\n\nSo, I do definitely recommend Barb's for cake and cookie lovers alike, you will DEFINITELY score big points with friends, family and co-workers!! Although, I would encourage all my sweet toothed brethren out there to not go Mon, Tues, Wed. mornings, so as to avoid the cracken, she's just awful!

Because to get anywhere cool other than Downtown Chandler takes google-mapping and planning for drive-time and checking for construction on the 101, 60, 202, I rarely leave my 'hood. Sad. I know.\n\nI kept hearing about LGO from friends, coworkers and others who've apparently always dealt with driving everywhere and don't see this as a major pain in the ass. Poor souls just haven't lived where walking and public transportation are all you really need, and everything awesome is just a short walk or train ride away. My god, I miss NYC... but I digress.\n\nLGO.\n\nMy friend Monika and I planned to meet for breakfast at The Farm at South Mountain (yet another place to which I hadn't taken a \"road trip\" in these 3 years). When we got there, it was closed for summer. Oops. Guess we should've checked. Standing in the parking lot across the street, stomachs rumbling, beautiful morning... She says, \"Oh, how about La Grande Orange? I know you haven't been there, and you'll like it.\"\n\nMonika is a non-local local and knows everything about everywhere. She is one of the people who has most influenced my decisions on which places I've decided to go check out and she's always spot on with her recommendations. So LGO it was. She already had me out, and I had a full tank of gas. Let's drive. \n\nAnd drive we did (well, more than I like to, or am used to, but truly it was maybe 15-20 minutes from The Farm when all was said and done, on a Friday morning, after 8AM).\n\nWas it worth it? The food (at least this time around), not so much, but the overall experience, definitely.  The breakfast I ordered wasn't \"oh-my-god-the-best-egg-white-omelet-i've-ever-had\" but it was good. It was also the first egg white omelet I ever get that is not covered in oil, isn't huge, and isn't overstuffed. It was a normal portion, for a normal person, with an average appetite. It's called the Daybreaker: egg whites (they come like that, it isn't an extra $1.50 like it is at some places), turkey, and a tomato-avocado salsa. \n\nI tend to order healthier breakfasts, though I always fantasize about the pancakes or waffles. If I can share those with someone, then I'm game, but I know Monika and I both tend to sit on the \"healthy\" side of things, so I didn't even suggest it. She ordered eggs, toast and jam. Pretty simple breakfast, but again, very normal sized portions, nothing looked shiny with oil. \n\nI know you all were probably hoping I'd dish out rave reviews about something else, like the pastries in the case, or their breads... I promise  I'll return, and I will indulge in something other than egg whites, in the name of Yelping.  But truly, my fairly-priced Daybreaker omelet was good - not great. The tomato-avocado salsa truly gave it that \"mmm\".\n\nI also noticed on the sandwich menu that they have a Cuban sandwich, aptly named Cubano. Not so sure it'll taste authentic, but I'm not a Cuban food snob, and if some non-Cubans are giving it an honest try, even putting their own spin on it, I'll try it. And I'll probably love it (or at least like it a lot). You can't go wrong with a Cuban sandwich, especially one whose special spin is Gruyere cheese and spicy brown mustard. I'll let you know. Promise. \n\nThey have sushi (which I won't eat, ever, anywhere, any kind), salads, and some other breakfasts - egg dishes, yogurt/granola, oatmeal, burrito, etc. Nothing that really calls to me. So I'll likely just return for the Cuban sandwich and pastries.\n\nIt wasn't really the food that was good about this place. More than the food, I just loved the environment. Yes, there were people having conversations on a phone or with another person. People on laptops. Some tourists. So what? Live and let live, you know? \n\nWe spent 15 minutes eating and then 2 hours perusing the shop/market. They've got some unusual items, gourmet/specialty candy, ingredients, mixes and other foods, some really neat gifts for people and pets and some awesome art. Not sure how often or what kind of variety they carry. When I went they had these really interesting vases, one-of-a-kind, with things written on them. They were funny, or twisted (or both), and totally thought-provoking. The artist is Kaelyn Loes. I may pick up one or two for some good friends who I know appreciate \"word art.\"\n\nAs for parking - it sucks, but we got lucky. The parking lot is across the street and tiny, and I can see this being a problem. In fact, others' reviews mention that too. I read somewhere that the designer for LGO did this on purpose to encourage foot traffic and make this place a \"community\" gathering spot for the area locals, so I appreciate the concept. and you won't find me bitching about the parking situation. \n\nFinal word? If you live in the valley, go at least once. It's not like any of the boring, personality-lacking chain places at every strip mall. A diversion from the predictable crap on every corner in suburbia.", "business_id": "R8VwdLyvsp9iybNqRvm94g", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-06-26", "type": "review"}

With that said, I think we may have an ugly baby here. Don't get me wrong, there are some redeeming factors here, but for the most part I think that there might be a bit more hype than anything going on these days at La Grande.\n\nI went here for lunch today not recalling that 50% of their menu is not available 100% of the time and that kind of bummed me out because that means no pizza until 4 pm during the week unless it is Friday or Saturday and no burgers unless it is Friday or Saturday.  Either way, 11:15 am on Wednesday means I have a full choice of sandwiches, pastries, salads, and breakfast choices.  Many will say that those choices should be more than enough to choose from if I am willingly going to dine here.  Well...it wasn't my day to pick the lunch spot.  A work colleague actually picked it which is amusing due to my second gripe: between the loud music, gabbing hikers, lunching ladies on their way to or from the Biltmore or Fashion Square, the place doesn't necessarily lend itself to normal conversation.  That is assuming there is a place for everyone to sit. Just because you are alone, with your latte and laptop doesn't mean that you need to take up an entire 4 top to yourself.  The place itself and the atmosphere just doesn't feel as \"phoenix\" as I recall when I first went. Something has changed. I feel like all of the LA transplants come here to recharge and then go off again to do their thing. It only made me laugh harder when I was leaving the restaurant and noticed the sign on the door that read \"LGO now open in Santa Monica.\" Yahtzee! That is exactly where I thought I was anyways during lunch so I guess it makes sense that they opened another one out there.  I also think that the flow can be improved from finding parking, to the ordering, to the waiting at the end of the counter for your food, to finding a seat.  I would think for all the hassle I was going to get served a plate of food that was made from the water of the fountain of youth or at least a hint at the secret of life.  But alas my $8.00 tuna salad sandwich only came with a couple of pickles and a watermelon wedge.\n\nWhile I will say one of the redeeming is the food (although an $8.00 sandwich has to be pretty damn fantastic to be $8.00). My tuna salad on 9 grain was fresh, not too much mayo or other junk in it.. It is served with tomato, cucumber, apple and greens. I will be honest, the tuna is stacked high, but the bread is overly toasted and I hardly tasted the apple. But I repeat, the tuna salad itself was pretty good.\n\nI know when I first tried La Grande I liked it a lot. I thought the breakfast was great and I truly enjoyed the scene there. These days it just seems like it has lost a bit of it's luster for me. I am sure I will be back in the future and will give it another chance. It will probably be when I can get dropped off, have called in my order ahead of time and it is between the hours of 4 and 5 pm on a Friday so I can freely order from the entire menu.", "business_id": "R8VwdLyvsp9iybNqRvm94g", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-08-12", "type": "review"}

Tammie coe has great things too, but Cole is awesome!\"\n\nCole IS awesome indeed. GREAT cookies! ***\n\nI haven't yet had the pizza, but it's on my radar, and it's only a matter of time. I'm also intrigued by their white sangria.\n\nAnd did I mention how much I love all the artsy, unique and/or kitschy items they have for sale in the shop area? I HAVE to remember to come to LGO the next time I need to buy someone a gift. So many fun (and some, USEFUL) items!", "business_id": "R8VwdLyvsp9iybNqRvm94g", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-06-07", "type": "review"}

LGO is the reason I live in the neighborhood! The only down side is the tiny parking lot fills up quickly, weekend mornings and most evenings for dinner. One reason I chose to move near LGO was so I could walk or ride my bike to breakfast. I have had almost everything on the breakfast menu, and loved everything. The muffins from Tammy Coe are to die for. I always stop in the Grocery to grab bread or cheese for nice dinners or even a picnic lunch. \nStopping by after work for pizza and gelato has also become a bi-monthly occurance in our house. The pizza is light, crispy with amazingly fresh ingredients (if you eat breakfast there, you will see the chefs chopping and preparing the fresh veggies, pepperoni, salami, etc. in anticipation of the evenings pizza and salad orders).\nI recommend LGO to everyone I meet, and it is always my dinner suggestion and favorite place to take out of town guests!", "business_id": "R8VwdLyvsp9iybNqRvm94g", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-06-09", "type": "review"}

Bringing my laptop as my date, I took advantage of their free Wi-Fi service to create some clever rap review, but hit a road block. NOTHING rhymes with \"orange!\" Sure, I could've came up with something more clever, but I found myself easily distracted with this new tidbit and had to share it! :)\n\nOkay, okay...now back to LGO. I grabbed a fresh smoked salmon chopped salad ($8.25), which had bits of asparagus, sunflower seeds, couscous, tomatoes, craisens, and a side of champagne vinegerette dressing on a bed of romaine lettuce. Not being a fan of the dressing, I was more impressed with the generous amount of fresh smoked salmon, which was delivered at the right temperature mixed with the fun texture of couscous. Adding a bottle of water, it was the perfect and delicate lunch to balance the heavy, 98 degree weather. The portions at LGO don't look large, but they always fill me up. Maybe it has to do with the backdrop of super attractive, earthy, trendy looking people in sunglasses, chic capris, yoga wear, and sandals that keep my appetite in check? Either way, LGO is a great place to grab breakfast, lunch, or dinner with their casual menu. I'm slowly becoming a fan of their pizza as I'm getting use to the taste of sourdough crust, but love, love, love their array of freshly baked pastries, muffins, cookies, cakes, etc. Many slices of heaven await my eager and grubby hands as I fog up the glass case, while admiring their perfection. The price points are a tad high, but considering they use fresh ingredients and bake in-house, it's quite reasonable. When the weather is cooler, the patio is a great place to seat and catch up with friends. A lot of bikes are usually parked along the brick wall, adding a bit more flair and color to the place. The music is always on point with an eclectic mix of Jay-Z, Kings of Leon, indie pop, or electro-often making me want to bottle pop from their large selections of wine. Not only do they carry an array of vino from the floor to the ceiling, they also have a classic candy isle with modern day pricing, pet and kiddy goods and treats, a coffee bar (not a fan of it personally) and lots of other unique trinkets and gift items to browse through while you wait to order.\n\nWhich now brings me to the only 2 things I dislike about LGO: The California-like traffic in their parking lot and grocery store/restaurant/pizzeria/coffee bar and...that nasty coffee. If you come during rush hour, you should expect to fight for a parking spot or be cautious of someone backing out (hopefully, not into you), and those randoms (don't assume they're  all Asian :P) driving the wrong way. If you survive that, you'll be entering into a mess of people browsing up at the menu, with those that are annoyed because they know what they want, with the \"regulars\" who are actually in \"line\" to order, to the people frozen in place looking at the pastries, in-between the \"pick up\" area where people are actually picking up their orders, standing next to those who are still waiting to pick up their order, while getting in the way of the people in line at the coffee bar who just want to order their damn coffee and OJ, and the rest are now just trying to grab their silverware and napkins to eat. Just remember to breath...and breath. Kundalini. Some how, some way, you do end up with a seat somewhere and actually enjoying your meal. Otherwise, come in at an off beat time where the place is yours for the taking :) As for their coffee...have ordered it 3 different times and still hate it. They rank 2nd to Pita Jungle when it comes to the worse coffee I've ever ordered, which is too bad since the open air ambiance would perfectly compliment a great cup of Joe.", "business_id": "R8VwdLyvsp9iybNqRvm94g", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-06-11", "type": "review"}

I took home a red velvet cupcake to last me a few days, and it was wonderfully moist with cream cheese icing.  \n\nThe atmosphere seemed to be a fun chill vibe with somewhat friendly employees.

I did not realize valet is complimentary (well free + tip).  I drove around forever, and it was crazy with cars everywhere. The residential areas within a 1-mile radius require a residential permit, or the car gets towed. So, beware of this prior to going!

I've been here about a zillion times yet this is my first review.\n\nI really hate going here but I love to eat here.  Let me explain:  The parking situation is a complete clusterfuq as is the ordering and seating process.  It is basically a yuppy free-for-all in the place.  The place where the line forms is full of stupid bric-a-brack and chatzkies.  All that crap should be removed for more seating and hopefully a less cluttered area.  Aside from that, the ordering your food and picking it up process is pretty haphazard and is not helped by tons of people trying to make their way through the place filled with shelves of random stuff.\n\nHOWEVER.....\n\nEVERYTHING and I do mean EVERYTHING on the menu is delicious.  Breakfast to lunch and everything in between is excellent.  You really cannot go wrong.  Even their pre-made salads are excellent.  Their menu is not too complicated but it is very well thought out and I bet they have some of your favorites, but with their special twist.

That being said, the other muffins are typically marginal at best, so if you are in the mood for a lighter breakfast, I would suggest the brioche bread or go with one of their english muffins.

I was expecting something completely different. I showed up around 11:45am on a Wednesday and the place was PACKED. I had to park across the street.  The grocery area is where you order lunch. It was shoulder to shoulder with other patrons, most professionally dressed. I don't really see the appeal of coming here on your lunch hour squeezed in with everyone else. \n\nI chose a Caesar salad from the case as I was in line. I asked the girl at the counter if I could add chicken to the salad and was told she had turkey breast. But it was sliced, lunch meat style turkey. \"No thanks\" I told her. I would have thought they would carry grilled meat to add to the salads. \n\nNow to find a table..ugh. I snagged one as a group was leaving, I felt like a lurker. So we are there to chat with our client and eventually talk business. The techno music was so loud, I could barely hear myself or my client. Gosh, I feel like a Grandma here, but it was just not a conducive place to have a business lunch. \n\nProps do need to go to the dessert case.  That thing was packed with amazing treats, some from Tammie Coe.  I had a mini cupcake, a white cake with a cream cheese frosting with shredded coconut on top.  It was AMAZING!\n\nI would give LGO another chance, possibly for the pizza everyone says is so fabulous. The manager contacted me the day I went to LGO.

I don't even mind that there is a parking issue most of the time, I mean how can you blame them for that? It's in a great neighbosrhood and I think they have made the most of the parking space they have - I've never really viewed the popularity of this place as a negative.  \n\nTwo: For such a busy place, I think they do a great job with customer service.  Because of the nature of the restaurant (ordering at a counter, picking up your food when they call your name) you don't get a lot of chances for one-on-one rapport building and encounters with the staff are pretty brief, but always pleasant.  I love that it's efficient and on the rare occasions I already know what I want to order the staff behind the register can somehow quickly sense my determination and call me to the front.  If, like yesterday , I want to peruse the menu, there are usually girls walking through the line handing out menus so you don't have to stare up at the chalk board.  I originally grabbed a salad out of the cold case and brought it up to the register. I asked if I could have it without cheese and extra beets, they made me a fresh to-go salad in no time and were super friendly about my requests.  \n\nThree: Every single thing I've had here has been delicious.  I try to get different things every once in a while and I've never been disappointed! Yesterday I had the Sonoma chop salad which is amazing and also grabbed a thai chicken salad for a friend and it's my new favorite thing.  \n\nI hope people will continue to patronize this beautiful little eatery that we are so lucky to have in Arcadia.  If you are new to LGO, keep an open mind and I think you will find that the great things about it absolutely outweigh the \"bad.\"", "business_id": "R8VwdLyvsp9iybNqRvm94g", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-07-14", "type": "review"}

The parking situation can become an issue too, but for my time and money, it's worth it.\n\nLGO is top notch in my book and you can find me there pretty regularly.", "business_id": "R8VwdLyvsp9iybNqRvm94g", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-08-07", "type": "review"}

It was our first time and even though parking was difficult I had really high hopes going in. I read up on the reviews from my fellow yelpers out there--and was ready for the challenges that eating here brings. Even though I knew about the long lines and needing to find a table first--I still found it difficult to navigate through this place! \n\nOnce we got to the counter and we ordered, I was shocked that our bill was over $25. I had the oatmeal with an English muffin and he had the Daybreaker--egg white omelet--we each had OJ and that was it! I asked for a little side of cream and some butter for my oatmeal and it didn't come with our meal. When my husband politely asked for it--the gal at the counter showed little in the way of customer service skills and pretty much treated him as if she didn't have time to deal with his request--a common denominator from other yelpers as well. \n\nMy oatmeal was decent (although I've had better at Taylor's Cafe--costing about $2 less, much bigger portion and it comes with fresh blueberries, strawberries, banana's as well as cream, butter and brown sugar! :-). My husband's omelet was completely tastless--it was an egg white omelet with smoked turkey breast with avocado and tomato salsa. The tomato's were nice but the omelet had no flavor except for the salt from the turkey. If you're expecting cheese in your omelet--be sure to ask to have some added! It contains exactly what the ingredients lsited on the menu reads--no more, no less. The smoked turkey is your average sliced sandwich turkey meat on top of the egg white rolled up with the tomato's and scant avocado pieces tossed on top. \n\nI'm so disappointed--maybe we just ordered the wrong things? When looking around we did see some delicious looking sandwiches and it did seem that people were enjoying their food, we were just wishing that we were enjoying ours as well. We finished quick and got outta there. \n\nWe'll probably give it one more shot some time down the road. We had the same reaction when we ate lunch at Chelsea's about 6 months ago. Not much in the way of portion for the price you pay. Knowing they're owned by the same company--it sure explains that taste and atmosphere didn't make up for the sticker shock.", "business_id": "R8VwdLyvsp9iybNqRvm94g", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-08-15", "type": "review"}

If it is something to buy and use in some other form or fashion then it is more than likely a great at whatever it is.\n\nThe area where liking La Grande Orange becomes a challenge is that it is always soo overcrowded with customers that the lines and wait for orders can be pretty long.

Not only do they serve up some pretty incredible eats, but also the atmosphere and energy are infectious. I always leave feeling like I did more than have a meal: I leave feeling like I had an experience. \n\nFor a place that sees as much foot traffic as LGO, and for as little space as they have in the market/counter area, they do a great job of controlling the line and making it so you don't wait too long to order up. I was there during that odd hour in the morning when it feels like you may have missed out on prime breakfast time, but it's too early to order lunch. After going back and forth a bit, breakfast won out, and I got a Venice Beach Burrito with a side of potatoes and a 'Sunrise' (their tangy blend of grapefruit juice and pomegranate). Food came out fast, and I was meeting a friend who had already snagged a table: Two bonuses in my book.\n\nEverything tasted great, but I've never been to LGO and thought otherwise. The VBB  with tofu chorizo, mushrooms, corn, spinach, potato, egg whites & charred tomato salsa rolled in a wheat tortilla packs a flavorful punch, but didn't leave me feeling so full that I couldn't go back up and get a cookie later! Breakfast was SO good in fact, that on my way out I decided to get lunch too, and grabbed their stacked turkey sandwich to take back to the office. Knowing that I'd be eating it a bit later, I asked for it dry, and asked them to hold the bread and wrap up my turkey in that same tortilla that my breakfast came in. They are always open to substitutions, and never give me a hard time when I start swapping things around.\n\nEven more enjoyable than the food is the diverse and eclectic crowd. LGO has become a gathering spot for business-folk hosting working lunches, moms taking a break from the kids and groups of friends reconnecting.

Ladies and gentleman: the perfect amount of cheese, avocados, proscuitto, fresh basil, and lemon zest.

Didn't get a chance to meander through the shop, but honestly, I wasn't there to shop. \n\nWe parked in the back and basically walked through the kitchen (which is in the shop) and the shop to get to the pizza place. There are far too many entrances. We had to walk through 3 doors, and then walk to the other end of the restaurant, just so the hostess could see us, and walk us back the way we came to seat us at a table. Kind of felt like I was walking in circles. Not so good if you go hungry. But all that can be overlooked because the food is fantastic!\n\nWe got the avocado pizza and added prosciutto and spicy chilies. Now, let me preface this with the fact that I'm not really a pizza person, unless i make it myself. Generally the crust is just blah and there's too much sauce. I am now a LGO pizza person! the pizza was just big enough for the two of us, the crust was thin, hand-made and perfect. The toppings were fresh, and you could tell. I didn't have a problem with the topping ratio, either. Usually I find that there's too much of one thing, not enough of another, but this was not the case. Avocado, 4 cheeses, prosciutto, tomatoes, spinach and chillies. No red sauce. Right off the bat, that made me happy. The flavours were perfect, the crust was perfect, it was pretty much a perfect pizza. \n\nOne issue I had with the meal: no refills on sodas. They give you a can, a short glass and 2 (yes, really) ice cubes. Kind of a let down. Stick with iced tea, or remember to ask for a large glass with ice. \n\nDessert. it was my birthday dinner, so of course dessert was a must. Our friends (who got the same pizza as we did, sans chillies) got the million layer red velvet cake with cream cheese frosting. I got what they call the Old Timer, which is essentially a homemade Hostess cupcake.... on crack! I'm a fan of red velvet cake, but i'm super picky about it. This was moist and perfectly done, and the frosting was finger-licking good. My Old Timer was just ridiculous. Cream filled devils food cake with chocolate ganache all around the outside. The cake was perfect; moist but not mushy, the ganache was rich but not so rich you couldn't eat it and the cream was fresh. \n\nI can't wait to go back for a date night and try an appetiser, maybe a different pizza and a different dessert.

I always get the eggs and bacon, because they prepare them so well, I'm never disappointed and I pair that with a fresh-made english muffin, that will absolutely make you question your assumptions about carbs - because you'll never be able to pass one up, once you try it.  The place isn't inexpensive, but you do get a lot of food for your $$$, so it's worth it.  I have been literally dozens of times over the last year + and it has been great every time.  I love this place.\n\nThe service is always friendly, it's a GREAT hang-out, especially after a nice quick hike up Camelback.  The bathrooms are clean, and very spacious, the parking is sometimes a pain, but it's worth paying for valet if you have to.\n\nWhatever it take, just go.", "business_id": "R8VwdLyvsp9iybNqRvm94g", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-07-25", "type": "review"}

Lets get the not so cool things about this place out of the way first...\n\nCons:\n-Parking lot is silly small for how popular (and amazing) this place is. Although, this well NEVER deter me from going here. Even if its just to grab a quick coffee.\n\nOk.. now that I really sit and think about it, that is the only Con to this delightful establishment. Walking through the shop you can find the most darling and useful items including: funny/witty random items, coffee mugs, to go cups for iced drinks (a MUST in AZ), t-shirts, books, art, calendars, magazines, etc... You can also purchase cold beverages outside of the restaurant or coffee bar and they also have a huge selection of wine for a small store. I purchased a darling La Grande Orange to-go coffee mug and if an art piece my boyfriend loves is still there when I arrive next friday.. I will be getting that for him.\n\nThe coffee bar smells amazing and even though I have only had one  iced toddy (AZ friends, i'm catching on ;))  from them, I am in love. The barista was super knowledgable and friendly and guess what ? She managed to not screw up something as simply as an iced beverage. I also purchased a bag of their Organic Ethiopian coffee. It is sitting in the apartment in AZ just waiting for me to come back! They bake all sorts of delicious treats daily and they have a food menu outside of the restaurant. They offer lots of quick fast goodies to take on the go as well as breakfast options for all of us loungey-coffee/brunch/patio-with-our-laptops people. ME. \n\nWhile I was there I dined in the restaurant and our experience was great. We ordered cocktails while we waited for our table and they were fresh and delicious! So nice to have a real drink outside of UT. We were seated quickly and our server was very helpful, friendly but also very laid back which I love. We ordered the  grilled artichoke which was of course amazing, a vegetable pizza and another round of drinks. As we finished up our dinner we walked around the shop one more time to take in all the amazing random stuff they sell all while a great AZ storm was starting to brew outside. \n\nThis place is amazing.

The little shopping area is great to browse around - when you can figure out a way through all the people in line! Don't get me wrong..the food is fantastic. I just like a little more relaxation on my weekend than fighting through the hordes just to get that amazing english muffin. It's worth it, but then I just feel tired.....annoyed.

He bought a few nik naks there during our visit. \n\n3rd time visiting: Tried their pizza for dinner and OMG!!!! I swore on that day that it was the best pizza I've EVER had! We had the Magrherita and it was just divine. The buttery crust was the right level of crispiness and the mozzarella was gooey and perfectly melted.

Of course, everyone talks about their commuter sandwich, but my absolute favorite is the tuna salad on 9-grain. I always come into LGO intending to try something new, but I can never stray away from that sandwich. The thin apple slices paired with the perfect consistency of tuna salad, placed between two pieces of crispy toast, is like heaven in my mouth. Their freshly squeezed orange juice is also a great boost on the weekend mornings!\n\nI love LGO so much that now they've opened a location in the Sky Harbor Airport, I ALWAYS make a point to go to that terminal (even if my flight does not depart or arrive there), JUST so I can get my fill of LGO. Recently I tried their sea salt chocolate chip cookie, and is smitten. It is an incredibly rich cookie, but I love the chunky texture of it and how it looks so fresh and homemade. Plus the shaved sea salt perfectly balances out the sweetness of the dark chocolate! It is a humongous cookie though...and it is very filling.\n\nLGO also has a display of the cutest and quirkiest items on sale in the front.

Great event.  I was very happy that I got the chance to have b'fast with 2 yelpers I have not seen in a while, Joan G and Meagan G - so nice to see these ladies!     I had the egg-white omelet.  That was fantastically delicious.  A lot of people love their English muffins too and they sell them by the half-dz.\n\nSo, I am finally, after 4 years of shopping here, writing a review of LGO.  \n\nI love coming here.  Everything about this shop screams hipster and I like hipster stuff too.   I love the lunch salads.  Their salads are often creative and delicious with fresh local ingredients.  Just grab a salad from the cooler in front of the main counter.  \n\nI love the pizza.  IN fact, the pizza here is some of the best in the valley to me.  The star of their pizza, to me, is the delicious crust!  the crust of their pizza has an appropriate balance of crisp and chewiness.  I have also enjoyed some of their cookies.  Certainly the last Yelper Cookie recipe in July 2013  was the best cookie I've had from their Bake Shop.\n\nI know they sell wine and a bunch of other stuff.  I always feel like I'm running into stuff on displays for sale in there; but to be honest, I've never paid that stuff any attention.  I don't know what is on those displays in that store.  When I was in there today, I noticed a children's book on one of the shelves and remembered thinking, odd.  But maybe people buy them and read those books whilst they eat lunch. (?).  \n\nThe parking situation at this corner of Campbell and 40th street is typical of most central phoenix eateries - frustrating, limited, best-to-valet - to name a few adjectives.  Which is why I normally get what I want from LGO to go.  They have convenient \"to-go\" parking spaces right in front that are almost always vacant.  I park, run in , grab what I need and come right back out.    \n\nUntil this morning, LGO certainly had a round-up-able-to 5 star rating in my book.. I had to knock them a star for the following TWO  reasons: \n\n#1 this place doesn't lend itself to large groups at all if you come for lunch or breakfast.  No reservations.  Just dispatch your buddies to hold seats with cell phones, napkins and whatever else you can use as place holders.  \n\nRCV Alert:  \n#2 They got rid of or lost the Tammie Coe Cake's  Red Velvet Cupcakes.   I came to know TCC's RVC when I stopped in to have lunch at LGO once and that's where my love of TCC's RVC originated.  When I stopped in some time ago and saw the RVC cupcapes in the display.  I instantly knew something ewas off/wrong.  It didn't look like my beloved TCC RVC cupcake.  I inquired about the cupcake and why it looked different.  I discovered that TCC's was no longer being sold there, a person working at the counter told me LGO's RVC was just as good as TCC's.  Uhm, Houston, we have a problem, that sales person MUST have fallen and bumped her head!  I don't think so.  I've tried the RVC made by LGO's bake shop 3 times to see if it came close, the cake itself is not as good as TCC's.  The cake itself lacks the appropriate flavor.  The taste is off..  The cake is moist enough, and the texture is just right.  but the lack of enough flavor is where they loose the battle.  The cream cheese frosting is perfectly done.  If their cake's taste popped more, they'd be in a position to take on my #1 RVC in PHX.  Certainly a contender in my Top 5 favorite RVC's in Phoenix.  .", "business_id": "R8VwdLyvsp9iybNqRvm94g", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-08-17", "type": "review"}

I can not lie.\nI went here for the August Breakfast Club UYE. The breakfast sandwich I had was as good as I thought it was going to be. Their sourdough English muffins are great. Add bacon, egg and cheese to that and it is even better. Now here comes that big but I was talking about. They do not to breakfast service well here. It fact they don't do it at all. There is no service at breakfast. You can order breakfast sandwiches and stuff but then you have to go next door, stake out a table, go get your order when it is ready, then get your own silverware and water and coffee. After you are done they want you to bus your own dishes. The funny thing was that some people weren't picking up there food so someone would bring it over and track them down it give it to them. Hmmmm that sounds like maybe something they should do all the time. Probably a crazy idea.\nSo I will come back for more baked goods and to try the pizza but I don't think I will stop for breakfast again. Maybe without a large group it wouldn't be so bad but still they need to have some kind of service at breakfast or close off the dinning room.

The problems? Many!  We went there again on Sunday morning, November 24th.  The girl taking our order didn't even know what a basted egg was, so I had to order over-medium eggs. La Grande thinks it's cool to have their music blasting so loud you can't communicate with another person.  The bigger problem- counter workers yell out your name when the order is ready, but you can't hear your name being called because the music is so loud.... then they let your hot food sit on a counter with no heat lamps making zero attempt to find the customer.  If La Grande is going to keep the current system in place, which does not work (cold food and too-loud music), they will need to install an intercom speaker which cuts off the music when a customer's order is ready for pickup, so customers can hear their name being called.  By the time I found our food it was completely cold.  (btw, the food is never more than warm here). Upon complaining, a young woman offered to place the eggs, bacon & English muffins in the oven lol.  I refused & asked them to prepare the meals again.  Even after remaking our order, the over-medium eggs had runny whites, the scrambled eggs luke-warm at best & the English muffins were barely toasted (as usual) and barely hot enough to make butter melt.  The latte was plenty acceptable.  I openly told the counter worker, I've been coming to La Grande for many years, but have mostly stopped the past two years because the music is always ridiculously loud and the food is always cold. I expressed my disappointment in spending $30 for breakfast (which I have to pick up at a counter) and never being able to get a hot plate of food. Cold eggs, cold English muffins...YUKK!  I frequent their other restaurant Chelsea's, which does not appear to have any of these problems.  Additionally, what has happened to the \"Grocery Store\" Part of La Grande Orange Grocery???? Most of the cool metal racks of gourmet food items have been replaced with garbage trinkets such as candles and t-shirts!!!  On top of that, the pastry case has gone way down hill since the exit of Tammy Coe's baked goods.  On this trip in, we wanted something from the pastry case, but saw nothing that even looked appealing, so we purchased nothing from the case!!!  The display tables offering merchandise are far too close to the ordering and food pick-up areas, creating an environment where the customers can barely move past each other within the establishment.  Recommendation- delete 20% of the trinket selling tables in favor of respecting your customers need to walk through the place!  This place has some problems that have been going on a very long time (cold food and too-loud music top the list of issues), plus many new problems.  The owner needs to revisit the concept of \"Restaurants 101\"....

BIG family b-day party), I wanted to share my absolute delight for Cole Turner, and his bake team at LGO.\n\nAs we are HUGE fans of LGOs Key Lime pie, we had hoped that they would be able to craft a gender reveal pie for us to celebrate our pregnancy. However, we weren't exactly sure what we wanted or how to make our random ideas work. Cole listened to our suggestions, and ultimately created a beautiful marriage of what he knew would be successful, from a Pastry Chef's perspective, with what we wanted our guests to experience. His ability to relate to how special we wanted this moment to be and find any way to make it work, was outstanding. When we cut into the pie, it was exactly as he described it would be, it was delicious, and it was the centerpiece to a wonderful holiday celebration.\n\nWhen it came time for the baby shower, we knew exactly who to call. This time around, I gave Cole extremely short notice, and asked for dozens of miniature versions of their classic pastries. Assuming that we would be out of luck, he and his team found a way to make it work. Cole appreciated having our repeat business, and ultimately thanked us for our loyalty to LGO. But remember, we were the one's giving him the smallest of windows from which to work. I couldn't believe his dedication to the customer and their ultimate satisfaction. Once again, the desserts were 100% on point and the talk of the party. In fact, they pretty much stole the show. \n\nAs months pass between each request for their delicious baked goods, Cole is still my #1 contact for any desserts that I need catered. And each time I contact him, he remembers my name, asks about how my family is doing, and makes me feel valued. Customer service is the end-all-be-all in my book, and the bake team at LGO, led by Cole Turner gets my highest recommendation.

So, I have no information on the shop or the service, only the taste.  \nAnd let me tell you, it is definitely NOT worth making the trip to the bakery.  I received four samples, White Chocolate, Strawberry Rum, Raspberry, and Chocolate.  The cake was light and fluffy, but honestly resembled the kind of cake layers that you get from a grocery store.  You know, unnaturally light and fluffy.  (If you've ever made a cake from scratch, they are more dense than that from a box.)  There is no way this cake was made with fresh ingredients.  But, this doesn't matter to everyone, and the taste of the actual cake was not that bad.  Also, there are some decent boxed cake brands out there.  As for fillings, there seemed to be a layer of pudding, (vanilla and chocolate, depending on which cake you try) and it, too tasted like it came out of a box or a can.  My guess would be from a large tin can, which certainly has it's place on a Chinese food buffet, but not on a supposed gourmet cake.  In addition to the pudding, there was the flavor of choice for the cake.  One was a layer of strawberry jam, which said it was strawberry rum, but I couldn't taste the rum at all.  The raspberry was also a jam and pudding combination.  The chocolate was the least offensive of the cakes (a majority vote by the two friends I had with me) and the worst was the white chocolate, which my friend's 6 year old son tasted and then made the most hilarious face before asking if he had to eat anymore.  (And we're not talking about a picky kid here.  He routinely eats burritos from Chipotle with spicy barbacoa and guacamole, which is not something you'll see a picky eater do.)  To top it all off, no pun intended, the frosting was a non-dairy whipped cream.  Are you kidding me?  Spring the extra $1/gallon for the real stuff!  You've clearly skimped on the rest of your ingredients, so how about you go nuts on this part.   \nIn case there was any doubt left in your mind, no, I did not decide to order cake from Fleur De Lis.  If I wanted a grocery store cake, I'd go to a grocery store and probably pay a hell of a lot less.  Sadly, they have quite a few pictures on their site, which means lots of suckers have shopped here.  It is \"unforgettable\" for sure.  I will definitely remember not to recommend it to anyone.  Save your money and just get your wedding cake at Costco, or go to a better bakery if you're looking for gourmet.", "business_id": "Rd5SDxM3S9QUvRayhqZl4Q", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-06-15", "type": "review"}

There were very attractive young busty women in tiny blue shorts and tiny white handkerchief blouses.  They changed the uniform color and had mayonaise for the pomme frites...other than that?\n\nSo this Panera \"clone\" is okay, its food,  the sandwich was pricey (probably airport mark-up at this location) and not that special-the bread seemed \"store-bought\" and the turkey was grocery store grade.  The cookies are good, however; sugary and dripping with fat.\n\nI did see someone else mention service. They have a bad production set-up and workflow and the kids working don't really care (I understand that, sadly) and hundreds of rushed angry people a day can't be any fun.  However, noticing the sandwich in front of you and calling out the number should be a minimum requirement.\n\nWhen I noticed my number had been skipped, I waited jealousy while a few more people behind me in line were fed and walked back over and asked about it.   The young woman looked at me blankly; then down at the sandwich on the counter.    A pause for a few more seconds, then, \"Oh yeah, forty-six\".  I took my sandwich and walked away worried about our society's future.", "business_id": "Cm1jT60fxb1DjwpqjWJ8EA", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-08-24", "type": "review"}

We could only handle Einsteins and Gag-in-a-bag some many more times. We decided, what the heck, let's give Azteca a try.\n\nAfter all, we had partaken in El Norteno and La Canasta (both really salty in our book) and were like, come on, we live downtown, there's got to be at least one place with a decent chorizo and egg burrito? Well, low and behold, Azteca is better than most. The tortillas are probably the best part in my book - really tasty.\n\nMy favorite is the Egg and machaca, although its like mostly machaca and little egg, not a bad thing. Don't forget to ask for cheese with it though, my preference for sure. My wife likes the egg, potato and cheese, and I have to admit its tasty as well.\n\nBefore you leave, grab some pastries - specifically the empanadas. I'm typically not a fan of mexican bakeries (they always seem bland in my book), but the empanadas have a little flair.\n\nNot my choice for lunch this place, you can do better at Asadero Toro or America's Best Tacos in my book.\n\nGive a shot, you'll have fun.", "business_id": "d2AeNB4xw67E1Bzpo1Pm7Q", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-06-11", "type": "review"}

Granted, I take partially responsibility for that - how about not assuming that all customer's eat BEEF and PORK and ask them their meat preference. \nFurthermore, when speaking with the young lady there was no recommendation to try to fix my order, no apology, no nothing to try to amend this. \n\nAzteca update your website to reflect chicken/beef/pork or what have you instead of assuming that or a great majority of them eat BEEF. \n\nYou live and you learn huh!
