Service isn't too bad, but could be better.\n\nD&B is a great place for adults for sure, but the prices for tokes or \"game play\" is a little ridiculous.  Some games charge 6.9 credits to place.  Thats almost saying $1.50 a game and some of those games are addicting where I know most of us keep playing.  \n\nI also thing D&B isn't the cleanest place either.  The bathrooms near the arcade are always nasty in my opinion.  Doesn't seem like they keep up with it.

Meals and service are deliciously consistent, yet there's enough experimentation to keep things interesting. My dad and I visited this week, specifically, for Pastafest and - as usual - the meal was nothing short of spectacular. \n\nWe began at the bar where I mentioned a favorite drink no longer on the menu: the Malbec margarita. The bartender was quick to dig out the recipe box and whip one up to sweet and sour perfection. Happy hour prices make a stop at this bar one Shadyside's best options for higher end post-work cocktails. \n\nSeated in the bright (though slightly stuffy patio), we began with Casbah's exceptional calamari. Lightly breaded and fried, the squid was tender and deliciously sauced with a garlicky aioli and the sweet and sour Italian agrodolce (ahhhmazzzing), the combination made for a crave-worthy bite. \n\nPastafest provided tasting portions of some old favorites and chef's creations. We shared three: \n\nGemelli, jumbo lump crab, sweet corn, guanciale, tarragon: sweet and bright, this dish was summer on a plate.  \n\nDoppio Ravioli, eggplant puree, goat cheese, sweet & spicy peppers, marinated fennel: creamy and rich, the sweet and spicy pepper sauce was just the acidic kick the ravoli needed to balance perfectly.  \n\nSheep's Milk Gnudi, pork rag\u00f4ut, baby kale, grilled scallions, orange sea salt, extra virgin olive oil: gnudi is an all-time favorite and the pork ragout was incredibly tender, a gussied up version of BBQ and pasta salad.\n\nWe ended our meal with the milk cake which was moist and sweet and lovely with the last few sips of wine.

But at 8pm I was ready to eat anything and Bado's was on the way home. So I parked and walked I'm and the place was packed. Good sign. So a seat at the bar opened and the Pens were playing. So I ordered a bottled IPA and read over the menu. I needed to power carb after a long day of sitting in a hospital waiting room. The bartender who doubled as a pizza chef told me the white pizza was exceptional, so I took his advice and ordered a medium, figuring I could have it for lunch the next day. What arrived was this wonderfully thick, cheesy, reeking of garlic in a good way, just what I needed, comfort food that instantly made the days worries seem distant. The first bite was heaven, chewy center, crisp bottom, olive oil coating my mouth, ooey, gooey italian cheeses, saltiness from the black olives I ordered as a topping. This was pizza!

The server took the plate back to the kitchen so that Rachel could be re-stuffed, and for the rest of the evening her initial guts laid right there on the floor. Kim #2 had a fried fish sandwich, which looked a little withered, and then there was my Reuben. More like an Ewwwwww-ben.\n\nThe bread was dry as chalk, and the corned beef had been so overdone, it looked like bacon sticking out of the bread.

I ordered the Mahi Mahi over rice, and I wouldn't have finished it if I wasn't starving - the Mahi was really dry, and they added so much spice to the dish that whatever flavor was there was killed. Granted, it is a sports bar, but I've worked in Sports bars before that served amazing fish dishes. If it's not going to be good, it shouldn't be on the menu. After flagging the bartender down (again), we finally got our bill and decided that we definitely would not be back to eat, but maybe just for drinks.", "business_id": "-6JY1T0w4XETux5kGOj84g", "stars": 2, "date": "2008-08-04", "type": "review"}

The good reviews you see on here most likely can be from employees and vendors. What happened to me and a buddy this past Saturday is something I am pursuing thru legal channels. Dont make a good night go horrific by going in here and getting scammed by the whole staff. They are all in on it and will take you for thousands or tens of thousands. IF YOU GO IN, take a roll of quarters, a exorcist , and not your credit cards. So far managment has agreed to reverse $3400.00 in charges. I am awaiting the other $800.00. They (staff and bouncer) were refusing to let me leave and all I wanted to do was settle a bar tab . A 35$ dance can end up being thousands or whatever number the dancers say , they can do what they want to put on it to scam you and skin you alive. The manager did say \" that's not how we roll and I have reversed the $3400.00 in charges\". They roll people alright.Just because you go in there and have been drinking and they see that, they have a responsibility to make sure you are okay and cognizant. If you aren't and I was not ;that does NOT give them the right to commit fraud and thievery .  I have contacted my attorney and we are meeting with the District Attorney and Channel 9 is weighing in as well. What they are doing is not right and needs to stop immediately. Charlotte does not need to be represented that way to business travelers , much less their own citizens . The explanation I was given was that dancers are in business for themselves (independent contractors) . Well then, the staff there must be \" on the take\" for we were told we could not leave and the bouncer and bartender were right there and I am sure they dont work independent of the club. \nDo yourself a favor and either throw yourself in front of oncoming traffic because you'll pay less at a hospital. I can go on and on but it looks like Action 9 and the District Attorney's office want to look seriously into this matter . This place is a skid mark on Charlotte's underwear.

At its worst it is the epitome of a townie joint.  I've seen both over the last five years.  When I first visited the Boar it was a dive.  My college roommate had a job tending bar and we would from time to time take up his offer of free drinks in return for keeping him company.  The barstools were often filled with the usual regulars, drinking under a thick pall of smoke.  There is a certain charm to dive bars and I'm sure for some the old Boar had it, but not for me.  \n\nFortunately the owner completed renovated the entire bar, and this happened right about the time I moved out to MIddleton.  In place of the dingy walls was stylish wood paneling and tile floors instead of linoleum.  The ceilings were raised and the ventilation was improved, and while it can certainly still get smoky my eyes don't burn anymore.  There is a sand volleyball court out back and bar leagues during the summer.  The jukebox is relatively standard, but there are a few gems tucked in amidst the usual country & hard rock options.  The regular crowd is still around, but a good deal more young people can be found at the Boar these days.  Some nights are vibrant and fun, some not so much.  I can't say that I've tried much of the food.  I know from my old roommate that there is a small grill in back, which was added during the renovation.  The Emil's pizzas are good as always.  All in all the new Boar is a complete improvement over the old one.\n\nThere are still a few things that keep the Boar from being my favorite in Middleton, namely the tap selection.  I am a beer snob and proud of it, so when the only local tap option is Spotted Cow I call foul.  I can't think of another Middleton bar that doesn't have at least one Capital tap, or at least Esser's Best.  What really seals it for me is sometimes the Spotted lines aren't even clean and the beer comes out flat and a bit funky.  Another complaint that I frequently have is some of the bartenders know next to nothing about proper drink mixing.  It is usually the same bartenders that act put upon to even mix a drink as opposed to just grabbing a bottle.  Some of the older bartenders are very good, but you almost have to know the schedule to avoid the others.", "business_id": "c5awCF5eu0ZkxUf_i94uPA", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-06-04", "type": "review"}

So I look up - and there is our waitress flirting with a group of guys at the bar.

Finally, after much gab, the Waitress/Bartender comes up to our tables and says 'Hi' then proceeds to stare at us.

You walk in and are immediately struck by the warm, safari-esque decor.  Giant palm frond fans twirl lazily above, while a cool blue backlit ceiling dominates the heavy wood fixtures.  This time, we went straight into the bar and camped out in one of the over-sized booths.  The restaurant was not as busy as I remember it in the past, and we were there at about 5 pm on a Saturday.  Still, there was a good crowd.  \n\nOur service was impeccable, as the servers were very attentive and efficient.  The food came out fast.  Since it was happy hour, we ordered a bunch of their discounted appetizers.  Sometimes we like doing \"picky food\" as we call it.  We started with the coconut shrimp skewers and the butterflied fried shimp with cocktail sauce.  Both were elegantly served and very tasty, perfectly cooked and quite enjoyable.  The sauce had a nice little kick to it, without being too hot or bland.  Next, we moved on to the Vietnamese spring rolls, which unfortunately were chilled and a little weird, stuffed with shrimp and vegetables.  They were almost a little jiggly, and as I have texture issues with food, I had to be careful here.  The peanut sauce served on the side was tasty and saved the day for me, but I would have preferred the spring rolls cooked, as I'm not a fan of sushi and this sort of reminded me of that.  The vegetable relish in the middle of the spring rolls plate was pretty good, though.  \n\nNext, we shared the hummus, which was also very tasty.  We did run out of the hard pita chips (I would have preferred soft pita but that's just me), but it was so good I finished off the hummus with my fork and practically licked the plate, until my partner slapped me up side the head and told me to stop being a pig.  Finally, I ordered the $3.50 tomato soup, which came looking somewhat oily and liberally laced with sour cream.  It tasted really good, despite the oily appearance, and it was quickly scarfed up.  With beer, our total for all of this was under $30, so I'd say it was mission accomplished in spades.  The prices are reasonable and the food portions are ample but not gargantuan.  Overall, I give this a B+.  Good service helped ticked that up a notch, and we will be back.

My family loves it.\n\nThe truth is, if you read the reviews, they are all spot on in one way or another.  Yes, its cash only.....   yes, they make you stand in a second line to buy drinks, and salad, and ice cream.  yes, the pizza is not drawing Oprah Winfrey to it to declare it the best pizza in America.  \n\nBUT....\n\nThis is the most unique thing you will ever see.  The food is good enough, and priced about what you would expect.  In fact, I think the quality has actually gone up over the years, but pizza is like coffee - snobs abound speculating what makes a pizza great.  At the end of the day, this pizza is pretty good for the family.  No one complains, everyone eats full amounts.\n\nBut unlike other \"unique\" places that are \"unique\" because they have funny pictures of people urinating in the bathroom, or kayaks on the walls or whatever, this actually has an oddly unique entertainment concept.  \n\nWe have tried it several ways, and do note, if you have not been, there is a method to the madness - if you swim with the fish, its far easier than swimming against the school.  What I mean by that is this:\n\nThe place gets PACKED.  When it opens there is a HUGE amount of people outside.  But their business goes in waves.  All the people crowd in, and order pizza at the same time, get drinks at the same time, sit at the same time, and for all practical purposes, leave at the same time.\n\nThe first \"Set\" is all old folks and families with tiny kids.  If you go with this crowd, get there 15 mins before it opens and don't freak when you are in a big line - you will get the seats you want.  \n\nBut, the interesting thing, is that if you go later in the evening, at the end of each set, a large group of people will leave all at once.  This ends up being the best time to go, because there are no lines, and you get great seats.   It's inevitable, if its packed, wait 3o minutes and half the crowd will leave, all at once!  \n\nThe organ itself is massive, and the instruments littered all over the roof, walls and back of the restaurant are controlled in time with the music.  In many cases, you can't really figure out which pipes are playing, but \"big\" songs like ITS A SMALL WORLD, and STAR WARS seem to use every instrument and its amazing.  Kids love it, old folks love it, everyone loves it.  (fair warning, I was one of those people that grew up with this place as a kid, in the 1970's.....  LOTS of great memories here, and my kids get the same experience that I had back then - it hasn't changed that much).  \n\nLater in the evening, things like the Canadian Flag descend and the Canada anthem plays, with lots of people getting up and singing and crying, followed by the Star Spangled Banner and Old Glory, Followed by Mickey Mouse Club flag, etc.  This is the kind of place, that you better stand and put your hand over your heart or you WILL get a WW2 Vet punching your jaw.\n\nWe bring all sorts of family and visitors here.  Do we bring them to show them that we have found the worlds best Pizza?  No.  A great Micro Brew selection?  oh no....  The best music you ever heard?  No (things played on an organ sound different).  But we take them here because when you add up all the small parts, its the most unique thing you have ever witnessed.  It comes off as one of those little niche concepts that some crazy inventor came up with that may work no where else but on this street corner.\n\nBelieve it, people come here to celebrate 50 yr wedding anniversaries and stuff - they read them out loud and its amazing.  This place, with all its random uniqueness is part of the culture of Phoenix and Arizona - which, is why it lands on lists for good dating experiences, etc.  If you propose to your future wife here, yes, you have no taste, but bring your kids here?  Then you are a cool dad! :-)", "business_id": "VRxelK__tuQD0KBxx2LzeQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-08-09", "type": "review"}

I rolled in by myself, the place was still hopping, grabbed a seat between a guy that was leaned back against the bar sleeping, and some native american old timer  who was about 3/4 of the way through what appeared to be a whiskey and coke served in a small 32oz plastic pitcher.  I could sense out of the corner of my eye that he was staring at me for what seemed like a good solid five minutes after I sat down.  I did not make eye contact.\n\nThe crowd was pretty ethnic if you will, I felt a bit uncomfortably white walking in there, but nobody seemed to mind or pay attention.  Seemed to be about half the crowd was folks from the reservation, rounded out by mexican, some black guys, samoan/polynesian even.  I was one of the handful of honkies there, which included on old biker dude, and two guys and a girl in their 20's or so.  Most everybody was relaxed and all smiles, just having a good time playing pool and socializing as an assortment of Nightranger tunes played on the jukebox.\n\nThe decor was indeed pretty divey, wood veneer paneling on the walls (is wood veneer paneling even manufactured anymore?), christmas lights strung about here and there, the standard dive bar issue string O' promotional flags.  The drop ceiling looked like it had been spraypainted christmas tree green.  The best part of the bar IMO was what appeared to be a \"karaoke corner\".  Imagine a corner wall mural of Monument Valley, done in the style of a black velvet Elvis painting, with glow in the dark neon colors.  And a coyote howling at the moon. Truly an enchanting sight. \n\nAs far as knife fights and the propensity for violence to break out at any second, I didn't pick up on that last night.  I was thirsty so I pretty much guzzled down my $3 Miller Chill without attempting to make any small talk.   Headed out the door, and that was that.", "business_id": "p8Lx4U-5uvp7TAhT08-wkg", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-07-26", "type": "review"}

It has the glitz and glamor of casinos, plus the digital sound of slot reels spinning, chiming bells. Mind you, it isn't Vegas, so take it for what it's worth and what it is: a quick-fix. Racketeering laws apparently don't apply to Indian casinos, because more often than not the machines will eat your money faster than a pig would slop, often not even teasing you with even a slight return. It isn't as big as a Vegas casino and there aren't nearly as many around Phoenix, which translates to more crowds. Smoking laws do NOT apply to sovereign Indian nation soil, thus making the environment unsuitable for those sensitive to cigarettes. \n\nThe area has grown from a casino outpost to a full resort, complete with dining options, a hotel, golf course, the new Rawhide tourist trap, a museum and more. \n\nAs an alternative to the flight or drive plus hotel and dining expenses of Vegas, Gila River Casinos function well.
