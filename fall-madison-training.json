Associated has screwed over myself and many others close to me time and time again. They always make sure to screw you over in any way they possibly can. Make a purchase and know it's going to take 5 days for it to go through so you make another and get paid in two days? You better believe those transactions are going to go through early and your paycheck is going to go through late.\n\nConstantly travel out of state and tell the bank not to flag your account if you go there? Welcome to your new world of pleading with the cashier to not take your card from you while you scramble around trying to make calls so you can pay for gas!\n\n\n5 stars for the personal banker Kiefer! My boyfriend got me a gift through his account and we never got the purchase. We put up a dispute and got denied it. The company the gift was from apparently likes to lie and told us it was Associated's fault (screw you, BlackMilk Clothing). That's a long story, but after dealing with this issue for 10 months now, we decided to go in and meet with a personal banker until the problem was solved. Enter Kiefer. Kiefer spent quite awhile looking through their system and talking on the phone. He talked to a higher up that we had been dealing with. The guy tried to just tell him all the same things he told us, but that didn't solve the problem. So Kiefer kept at it. After coming up with nothing, he suggested that maybe BlackMilk was lying. I wasn't sure about it, but Kiefer gave so much proof that the bank wasn't at fault I really didn't think it was Associated. He signed and notarizing papers for us stating the bank didn't have our money. He was so terribly nice through out the whole process and so legitimately wanted to help us. I was incredibly impressed and thankful. \n\n(Also, to end the story above. BlackMilk was lying, tried to blame it on PayPal, and finally admitted they should send us money.)", "business_id": "tOXZrihuRjPnyJK_O6iH1A", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-11-05", "type": "review"}

I never miss a chance to grab a walnut burger and hot chips when I'm back in town.  \n\nThis is just a wonderful neighborhood bar.  The food is still \"bar\" food but it's quality, tasty and made fresh to order.  The pizza is good, too.  Good beer selection and a truly local atmosphere.  The Harmony fits right into the vibe of the neighborhood.\n\nOh how I miss you, Harmony Bar!", "business_id": "KHOHjA8HOcTlFBCtMQFv8A", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-09-09", "type": "review"}

Overall, it took about 2 hours which isn't bad for a Saturday afternoon. When I returned to Firestone later that afternoon, they gave me a huge list of things wrong with the car which I knew before I came in the place. I didn't get my car completely fixed but I had a wonderful conversation with a woman named Christine who works there. She gave me so much great advice and I appreciated her honesty! If I asked a question about the car and she was unsure, she would walk through the garage to find someone who knew. I appreciate that more than anything because some people will just tell you what they think you want to hear.", "business_id": "Yn89vJYXcdprx9U_w1qmMw", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-11-19", "type": "review"}
