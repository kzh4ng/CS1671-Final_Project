Located in the old town area, I thought that a small, family-owned french breakfast place would be the perfect refreshing break from the trendy (Read: untsss unttsss untss music) mimosa-brunch places and overly-priced-food restaurants. I wanted something fresh, homemade, french and delicious.\n\nWe ordered an iced latte, a nutella crepe with fresh fruit and whipped cream, a croissant with egg and sausage and a normandy creme (ham, cheese and egg). The food came in before the waters and drinks, and unfortunately, they seemed prepared ahead of time and left to sit.\n\nMy normandy crepe looked (visually) delicious. When I started digging in, I noticed that it was a little cold (aka not prepared fresh) and that the cheese was barely there and already solidified and not gooey. The flavors were ok but the crepe contents were very flat, so they were very stingy on the portions of their ingredients. The crepe was topped with a sunny side-up egg but had no sauce or added flavors to it. I tried adding hot sauce but it really didn't make the dish any better. That was about $8. My iced latte was approximately $5 and really tasted like coffee with whole milk - and the coffee was not a great quality. Not an enjoyable meal.\n\nMy friend ordered the nutella crepe but was delivered a crepe stuffed with fresh fruit instead. Apparently, the order is EITHER a fruit crepe or a nutella crepe, not a nutella crepe served with fruit. When they took it back, they returned the same plate with a hint of nutella placed on top (my friend has already cut into the crepe earlier). The whipping cream was not your typical type: it was very dense and heavy, a weird combo between whipped cream and thick evaporated milk.\n\nThe service was decent but we were the only people at the restaurant besides from 2 other ladies who were just having coffee. The place was very empty, which is sad to see considering the 3 breakfast places adjacent to it had a 30-40min waiting line. I really want Au Petit Four to succeed but they need to overhaul the quality of their food and the attentiveness of their staff. With no customers to make them busy, there is no excused for stingy cold food.", "business_id": "wftoNIA0Q8nX-Da47psBCA", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-11-12", "type": "review"}

My only complaint about them is that they aren't bigger. I was literally rationing my croissant throughout my meal so that I could have a bite of it with every bite of my spinach & mushroom omelette - which by the way was also fantastic - and that's coming from someone who's paranoid about undercooked eggs and NEVER eats eggs unless they are cooked in her very own kitchen. \n\nWe ended up wracking up an almost $60 bill because we brought home a doggy bag of baked goods from the attached bakery.

In a pissed off voice she says \"Oh so you want a free meal???\"  After some arguing she said she would not charge for the food.  \n\nTwenty minutes later I received a call from the drive.  She told me her boss said not to charge for the food but demanded... \"you have to tip the driver\" over and over again.  I told her she could talk to my boyfriend when she got here.  She then called back three more times yelling that we had to tip her.  My boyfriend told her just so you know I was going to tip you but when you deliver food 2 hours late you shouldn't call your customers and demand that they tip you.  Tipping is optional and it's based on performance.  When she got here she rang the doorbell 8 times in a row (No i'm not making this up) \n\nNeedless to say at this point we did not tip her and will no longer be ordering from Croque.

No one was expected to do anything that made them uncomfortable. It was very clear that safety was a priority. \n\nThis was an awesome time. I'd recommend it for locals or tourists.

I ate them in that order, because I knew--while all should be delicious--the scallops would be amazing. And they were, on all accounts.

Three huge (like, the size of my hand) raviolis stuffed with spinach and ricotta [if I'm remembering right] and a brown butter sauce were easily split between our group. The brown butter sauce was a bit understated, but otherwise was a really good dish. The gnocchi--dang, I love gnocchi--were tender and cradled in a delicate tomato sauce. I'm generally not a huge red sauce fan but this was executed wonderfully.

I went to Marcellino's this past weekend with my wife and some close friends and I have to say the evening was an experience.  Everything about this place screamed romantic Italian dinner from the live music to the tucked away location set back behind Barrio Queen in Old Town.  In many ways the presentation is a throwback to decadent dining where they bring you a view plate of the pasta before the meal while the well trained waiter tells the story of each type of noodle and the delicious dish its served with.  It's something that I enjoy because it reminds me that I'm dining out, and this is a meal that isn't to be rushed.  The food they make here takes time and should be enjoyed accordingly and slowly perhaps with an accompaniment of a few bottles of carefully selected Italian wine. I ended up going with the squid ink pasta with muscles, clams, and half lobster tail in a flavorful red sauce.  In my opinion they had me at squid ink, but beyond that everything was quality, and the juice from the fresh clams and muscles gave a nice seafood flavor to the sauce.

First, I wanted a 2016 model. Was told first that all that was available from Lexus was 2015. I was also told that they didn't have the color I was looking for which was white. After them scrambling around for 20 minutes they came back and said they have a gray one. After looking at the vehicle I pointed out that it is a 2016 model on the window sticker. My son after looking at the lot found a new white one that we brought to the dealers attention as to what stock they had available ?  After 45 minutes and asking for a price since they said they had a special sale going on and everything had been priced to sell, I finally told them I couldn't wait any longer.  Dave the Manager came over to shake my hand and say he thanked me for coming in?  Not apologizing for taking an hour of my time or that he could get me simple prices on the vehicles ?

They run the train continuously but there always seems to be a line (get your tickets and get in it). Tickets are $2 per adult for a short ride around the grounds. The train ride is fun, you get to go over a couple of tiny bridges and through a covered tunnel. The track circles the entire park so there's plenty to see. It is a hit with kids and adults and is well worth the two bucks. They also have an all day ride pass for about $10 which would be a great value if you or your kid loves trains and plan to spend the whole day. \n\nAll of the train exhibits and the small merry go round require tickets to enter.

We even dug through our back seat looking for their coupon in the sunday paper for a discount! We walked up and sat down and saw their DIRTY patio furniture... wtf?! Don't these people own a hose?! That was so dirty, I couldn't imagine trying to have a nice al fresco dining experience there! Luckily for me, it was the dirtiest part of the resturant.\n\nWe approached the door when a very loud man came and opened the door and exchanged pleasantries over and over again and was very happy to see us. Ummm... thanks? but can we atleast order our drinks first? He was a little happy. I unno - I was in a good mood, but I sorta just wanted to be left alone to eat. We got our salads and the greens were semi wilted and the cesar salad needed to be refilled but didn't :( and so I was left with some odd franken salad I threw together on my own. It wasn't that great - but that's my own doing. \n\nTheir pasta salads and cole slaw and some of their fixin's looked very old and unappetizing! I couldn't even imagine eating them! I wished they had potato salad or carrot slaw (is that the word?) and macaroni salad... it wasn't good. But things did lighten up when I came across the soups.\n\nI loooove soups!! They are my salvation after a hard day. I cozied up to a lil bowl of tomato based soup with mini shell pasta and veggies, it was delish! So was the Veggie Beef soup. I wish it didn't have so much onion,but I'm not a big fan of onions. and their tacos were GOOOOOD... not write home and tell everyone about it good... but very good. They remind me of the kind of tacos you make at home, out of a box but not all craptastic like how they come out when I do it. I honestly liked it. \n\nThe cornbread was dry and my mom said her baked potato was too. The pizza looked too old to touch, so I unno about that one. \n\nThe service was another thing... the same man, who I'm assuming is the owner always kept talking. Even when my mom said something along the lines of just wanting to enjoy our meals and we thanked him for his hospitatlity. But damn... SHUT UP! I felt like he wanted to sit down and talk shop with us... but we weren't there to meet with him... we were there to talk with one another. But he always refilled our drinks and cleared our plates away quickly. So he got to keeep a star. \n\nTo my fellow yelpers: if you're in the area and want fresh salads, this might not be the place for you... especially if you want to eat outside cafe style on nice clean patio furniture... but if you want a nice cozy bowl (or several like me) of soup and decent bread sticks then this place will hit the spot.

While our marriage has been wonderful, our experience with London Gold since has been a complete disaster.\n\nAs we got closer to our wedding day, my wife returned to London Gold to purchase a wedding band to add to the engagement ring. She gave them very specific instructions that she did not want the two bands soldered together and that she wanted a light brushed finish. Unfortunately when she returned to pick up the ring it was soldered and heavily brushed. (D'oh).  She was upset, but we weren't going to let this ruin our big day.\n\nEventually after the honeymoon and we had some time to settle down, we followed up with London Gold to let them know that we were unhappy with our service. They brushed the problem aside. We pressed for a resolution and they told us to write a formal complaint letter, so we did. We received no response!\n\nYears later we needed to take the ring to get resized, as my wife hadn't been wearing the ring for over a year since it didn't fit. We attempted to avoid London Gold because of our bad experience, so we went to both the Shane Co. and Hamra Jewelers to see if they would resize the ring for us. Both of these stores told us that there were issues with the porosity of the gold as though it had been damaged years ago when London Gold first soldered the two bands together. We were horrified. When my wife confronted London Gold on this issue, they insisted that there was nothing wrong with the ring and that it was simply a matter of the other jewelers trying to steal their business.\n\nThey were disrespectful and condescending both on the phone and in person. It was clear they didn't want to help us or cared about us at all, they were just trying to get rid of us.\n\nAfter they attempted to resize the ring, they melted the two bands together even more. We brought this to their attention and they also shrugged and didn't think it was a problem. We also saw small dark spots on the inside of the ring and pointed this out to them. They called all of this 'normal'. They said they could have the jeweler try and etch a defining line between to the two bands as a possible solution. We let them give that a try but then their etching went off the seam!\n\nNeedless to say this has been a complete nightmare and you would be best served by going somewhere else!", "business_id": "6nzXPSmJ-ukrk8sl1n15VQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-09-29", "type": "review"}

I saw another reviewer talk about this place recently on yelp, and thought that I MUST go check it out.  I can't believe I've lived here for 7 years and never heard of this place. How is this possible?\n\nAnyways, Scott W and I came here and I really liked it.  I think its probably the best Deli that I've had since having moved here.  For starters, they have a really great full menu. TONS to choose from, and a small deli case with some side items in there to choose from.\n\nSome of the things that won me over about this deli are the following. For starters, they serve Beet Borscht.  This, my friends, is by far one of my absolute favorite Jewish dishes.  My grandpa and grandma would make this from scratch when I was growing up, and bring it over to the house when I was a kid. It was always a treat to eat, and I haven't found anything as good since.  There's a few deli's in Michigan that serve it, but nothing out here that I would recommend.  I didn't get a bowl of it here, but the fact that they serve cold beet borscht is going to make me come back and visit again.\n\nSecondly, they have real gefilte fish!  They serve it by the piece here, and it looked like it was supposed to look in the case...large with a carrot on top.  This, my friends, is the way to my heart.\n\nIn regards to my food, I really enjoyed my brisket sandwich.  I got it on challah with a side of fries.  Really really good, and it came with au jus sauce. I was able to plow through half the sandwich, and brought the other half home for later.\n\nIt was also a really a good sign to see other Jewish grandmas in there when we ate.  As someone who is not only Jewish, but has a high bar for Jewish food expectations, this place is awesome. I do plan on going back in the future for more, as I was really happy with my experience here.  Plenty of seating indoors and out, I really wish they had waitstaff instead of ordering from the counter.  This is a million times better then Chompies any day of the week, and I will gladly drive back here in a heartbeat to get more food.\n\nSolid place, worth the drive.

When I finally got to the window, it was then another almost five minute wait. I asked the guy what was going on and said \"there was a mixup with my food\". Huh? You mean my lonely little chicken sandwich with ranch and pickles? Jeez, sorry to confuse you all!\n\nWell, i finally got it, with like 5 minutes to spare before my movie. There was barely any ranch on it and it was cold. Blech.\n\nThis just reinforces why I never eat at crappy places like this. I guess it's my own fault.", "business_id": "TX44pKdAmynE8E3TaH0q3A", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-10-24", "type": "review"}

I don't know if it's the \"economic downturn\" or what -- but one used to get great service and a great wash here. No more.\n\nFirst, a lot is missing/gone. They used to have a tinting business and a lively detailing team. Now, you're lucky to see anything getting detailed. The bays are empty most of the time. They used to have a decent selection of refreshments inside. Now, there are empty coolers and a huge one full of weird off-brand bottled water. They do have fountain drinks, as evidenced by the steady parade of employees coming in to fill their cups. No customers filling cups, though.\n\nThe customer service experience is awful now, at least at the front end. As you drive up, two sharks begin circling you. The first shark is the guy who used to just take your wash order and give you a receipt. Now, it is Upsell Man, a strange and powerful supervillian whose mission is to sell you detailing services... you know, to fill those empty bays. He will stop at nothing, offering free washes, discounts, all kinds of stuff. Today he was lackluster, only asking, \"You okay on waxing?\" I did just get my back waxed the other day, so I guess the answer is yes. He went back to the cigarette he was forced to set down when I pulled up. Cool.. I had gone all day without walking through second-hand smoke, so that was good. The second shark is Auto Glass Man. You know him. You've had to dodge him at gas stations, supermarkets, maybe even your work place. I need say no more about Auto Glass Man, but he is now circling your car looking for cracks and dings. If he spots one, Jebus help you.\n\nIf you make it past this gauntlet, the actual workers will start vacuuming your car. They are pretty good at this. Then the car proceeds through an auto wash. While this is happening, you go through a large depressing room to pay for your wash. Today was extra exciting because the cashier appeared to have her young children on hand. Why pay for child care? They sprinted around the room, yelling, crying, crashing into chairs, into myself, and so on. The boy of about 2 or 3 carried an open bottle of Sprite which splashed merrily about the floor as he ran. The cashier alternated between standing behind the counter texting and yelling things at the kids. I enjoyed this scene for a while and then paid my tab and proceeded outside. There are some sad remnants of further upselling that used to occur, the \"wash booklets\", but the cashier now has no time or interest for such things.\n\nNow when you get outside, you witness the area where the real work is occurring. My car was shining with water and now being attended to by a man who dries it, cleans the windows and interior, scrapes bugs off the front, and so on. I paid $20 for the \"Super Works\", which is supposed to include a \"deep clean\" of the doors and dash, among other things. Like a previous Yelper, I considered this expensive but hopefully worth the money. I have kids and the car gets amess. One has to keep up appearances. The guy worked hard and appeared to pay attention to all areas of the car. He even covered some areas I don't usually see them cover. When he was finished, I inspected the car, tipped him, and left.\n\nNow, 5-10 minutes after you leave the Auto Wash is what I like to call the \"WTF Zone\". I call it this because that's when you start noticing the stuff they missed, but you are too far away to go back because you have already burned your lunch hour. In this case, he missed the insides of the back windows (which are still covered with my kids' fingerprints), the leather wrapping of my stick shift (dirty/dusty), and roughly half of the steering wheel (half is glazed with protectant, half is dirty). \n\nWell, whatever. No one is perfect. There used to be two or three people working on each car, in better days. Now you get one and they miss stuff. He did scrape off the melted wax that had gathered in my center console when my daughter left crayons in the car, which I had been avoiding for weeks. Worth $20? No way.", "business_id": "gnBgJD6LYsYhSneYVFDmhw", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-09-25", "type": "review"}

There are some situations where adding star ratings simply doesn't provide enough real-life context. Allow me to begin with a timeline.\n\n1. Found a FREE car wash postcard on my new 2015 Mustang Premium after work one day\n2. Drove down to the Arizona Auto Wash for my FREE wash the following weekend\n3. Was up-sold to a full detail on-site which would include a free ride to and from work\n4. Received a free car wash\n5. Scheduled my detail appointment including free ride to and from work\n6. Received full detail as well as rides to and from work (more on this below)\n\nI have waited until now to provide this review because I thought it only fair to wait out the total service term. I learned during my visits here that Arizona Auto Wash has been around for 20+ years. That's nothing to sneeze at. Now for a basic breakdown.\n\nTHINGS I LOVED ABOUT ARIZONA AUTO WASH\n\n- I loved the people. During my first visit, I met Chris. Chris is the young guy who up-sold me to a full detail from a measly free wash! While other reviewers have referred to this salesmanship as \"harassing\", I understood it to be an expected part of Chris' job. He in no way caused me to feel pressured or threatened. In fact, the only vibe I got from him was that he cared about the work he was doing and sincerely believed in the quality of the service he recommended. I literally witnessed this hard-working young man RUNNING from car to car, from car to office and back, etc. He was working very hard and took his job very seriously. I value this immensely. I later found out that Chris has been with the company for many years (7+ if memory serves...).\n\n- When I brought my car back in, a couple weeks after my first visit, for the full detail, I was fortunate to meet Oscar (I hope I'm spelling that correctly). Oscar was an exceptionally helpful, professional, and qualified individual. He was friendly and gave off a very trustworthy vibe. I learned that he, too, has been with the company for some time - well over 16 years, in fact! His love for the job and the sincere pride he took in his work was evident throughout my entire interaction with him. Once again, I value this highly.\n\n- Arizona Auto Wash offers a FREE WITHIN 5 DAYS Desert Rain Guarantee, which basically means that if it rains within 5 days of your wash, you can come back for a free one. I think that's pretty great.\n\nTHINGS I DID NOT LOVE ABOUT ARIZONA AUTO WASH\n\n- After my initial wash, I was surprised to notice that my pretty red calipers were still dark with dust and dirt. This was disappointing to me. I have blacked out rims and the red looks pretty sick when it shows through, but it's hard to tell the calipers are even there when they're dirty. I was disappointed, yes, but didn't make a big deal of it. After all, the wash was free.\n\n- When I arrived for my full detail, I was thankful that Arizona Auto Wash was willing to drive me all the way from Indian Bend to just north of Frank Lloyd Wright for work while they performed the 3-4 hour detail. However, my jaw just about dropped to the floor when they pulled MY OWN CAR around for that ride!\n\nNo joke, I drove down from where I live at Raintree and the 101 to Indian Bend. Oscar got in the car with me and I drove us both back UP to Frank Lloyd Wright and the 101. Oscar (a complete stranger to me, by the way) then drove my brand new not-inexpensive muscle car back DOWN to Indian Bend for the detail. When the detail was complete, I received a call and was offered to receive a ride back down to the auto wash (which I obviously needed). When I asked whether they planned to use MY car for that ride, the answer was yes!\n\n*** They were going to drive MY CAR all the way UP from Indian Bend to Frank Lloyd Wright so that I could drive their driver back DOWN to Indian Bend so that I could then drive my own car back UP to work at Frank Lloyd Wright!! UNBELIEVABLE. I was floored by the stupidity of this. I'm sorry guys - this was a bad turn.\n\n- After receiving my newly detailed car, I drove back to work, only to find that Arizona Auto Wash had neglected to put my branded Mustang windshield visor back into the car. This meant now a THIRD trip down to Indian Bend to retrieve it.\n\nIMPORTANT TAKEAWAYS\n\nArizona Auto Wash, if you're ever reading this, a few things you should know:\n\n1) Keep working hard and loving what you do. It matters, and it shows.\n2) Get a freaking company vehicle. After all this time in business, you should know better! I don't want a \"courtesy ride\" in my own vehicle on my own gas, and I CERTAINLY don't want a complete stranger driving my beautiful car any real distances!\n3) Remember the small things. How can I trust the quality of a supposedly meticulous detail when you can't even remember to replace the ONE ITEM I had in my car post-detail?\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWill I ever return to Arizona Auto Wash? Very likely not. :(", "business_id": "gnBgJD6LYsYhSneYVFDmhw", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-10-15", "type": "review"}

I've been here multiple times over the past 4 years of living in the neighborhood. But, yet again, customer service has driven me away. A few years ago, the manager steered me in the wrong direction which led to my purchase of $100 of chemicals that went down the drain, and then admitted his wrong doing in the subsequent visit after I confronted him, but only after I confronted him. He made it right by providing more chemicals on the house after some reluctance...This was 2 years ago.\n\nOn a more recent visit, I encountered a young lady. She was very nice, chatting with the people in front of me for 15 minutes while I waited in line to have my water tested. She did not acknowledge my presence and continued to chit chat with them. Granted, I was the only other person in the store, so I brushed it off. She then proceeded to have an attitude with me like I had done something wrong. Today, this young lady was working again, and again, was helping another customer..perfectly happy go lucky. When it became my turn to check out, I requested a price match to leslies.com for some shock as it was a few bucks cheaper. She then proceeded to tell me the SKU was different and that she could not. Now I understand this is a corporate policy, but it's the same exact product. And I wasn't asking for a 50% discount, it was $3. Seriously? At that point, she picked up an attitude with me. Same type of attitude she had the previous time. As a customer, I felt disrespected with her general attitude and lack of understanding. I could care less about the $3.

The caramelized onion contrasted with the bleu cheese was phenomenal! I think I ate about 7 of them!\n\nThis was paired with Caymus' 2008 Conundrum; a blend of Napa and central coast varietals. This was my first experience with a blended white, and I am a fan! Vanilla, melon, pear, mild acidity, really amazing.\n\nThe combination of the sweet onions, and the vanilla and citrus of the Conundrum, made for a fantastic finish. Yumm!\n\n\nOut next course was an heirloom tomato salad with burrata cheese  (mozzarella), arugula, and diced beets.\nI'm not a fan of tomatoes by themselves, but these were delicious, hearty, and very fresh. And the spice of the arugula paired with the acid of the tomato, and the creaminess of the burrata, made for a delectable salad. I finished it off, even the beets.\n\nThis was paired with the 2007 Mer Soleil Silver Unoaked Chardonnay. Very fruity, creamy, beautiful golden wine.\n\nPaired with the acid of the tomatoes, and the creaminess of the burrata highlights the richness of the wine wonderfully.\n\n\nFor the main course we were served peppercorn-crusted New York Strip with Bordelaise Sauce, Sauteed Escarole and Fingerling Potatoes.\nThe strip was what other cuts of beef aspire to be. The preparation is what other chefs aspire to accomplish.\nSimplistic, subtle, yet very powerful in both mouth feel, and flavor.\nThe escarole was topped with shaved hard-boiled egg, which was unique, and definitely changed the impact of the escarole. (I'm not particularly fond of it myself)\nThe fingerling potatoes were perfect.\nThe bordelaise could have been delivered in a cup and I'd have happily drank it up.\n\nPaired with this course were two Cabernet Sauvignons; a 2000, and a 2008.\n\nThe 2008 had far too many tannins for my liking. I don't want to pucker up like I've just eaten sand and have dry mouth.\nThe 2000 was much more mild, and was rather delicious.\n\nBoth paired wonderfully with the grilled meat, and the saltiness of the herbs on the potatoes meshed well with the reds.\n\n\nFor dessert we were served Berry Trifle with sour cream pundcake and amaretto mascarpone Cream.\nOMG. I died and went to heaven. Which I don't believe in. But almost could have.\n\nTopped with toasted almond slivers, this dessert was pure bliss. The berries floating in the rich mascarpone, resting atop that delicious yet sinfully good pound cake.\n\nAs if that wasn't enough to knock your socks off, they paired it with a 2004 Mer Soleil Late Viognier that alone could make you think you were drinking pure sugar, with great flavor.\nApricot, honey, orange, balanced acid make for a lush and long finish.\n\nAn amazing dinner and dessert, but in addition to the fantastic food, we were connected via videoconference with Chef Russell Skall; Fleming's Executive Chef, Chuck Wagner; owner of Caymus Vineyards, and Marian Jansen op de Haar; Fleming's Director of Wine. They fielded questions from several locations that were all conferenced in, making it feel a bit more personal. :)\n\nAs if all that weren't enough, one of the servers mistakenly switched my tab with another party's. That didn't really bother me, as I understand that mistakes can happen.\n\nHow it was handled made me want to reserve my 100th review for them; Mike Head, one of the Operating Partner's for the Fleming's in the Scottsdale Hilton, had introduced himself during the event, and had provided me his business card.\nI was expecting a deposit the night of the event, so the next morning I checked my account, which was how I noticed the disparity between my tab, and the amount my account was debited. (It was a triple digit charge)\nI emailed Mike, explaining the situation, and requested he contact me.\nLater in the day I hadn't heard from him, so I called him.\n\nLong story less long; he was going to contact my bank and, calling as a merchant, attempt to reverse the charge. He called me back to inform me that, rather than take a chance on there being any delay in me getting my funds back, he just went ahead and took cash to my bank, and deposited it in my account.\n\nNobody does that. Ever.\n\nMike Head of Fleming's did.\n\nHe even returned my gratuity for the mistake having been made in the first place.\n\nAnd after all that, they still gave me a gift card to entice me to return.\nMike Head, and Fleming's of Scottsdale, epitomize what customer service should alway be about.\n\nThank you Fleming's, Caymus Vineyards, Chef Skall, Mike Head, and most importantly, Shwaag, for such an amazing evening.\n\nAnd thanks especially to my date, for being so beautiful. :)\n\nIf you haven't been to Fleming's, do so at your earliest opportunity.", "business_id": "9AbyBqGWHYZC73GlyAuTrQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-10-04", "type": "review"}

Warm, inviting and not pretentious.  If I had to pick nits (and I do) I would just say the service can be breathtakingly fast - so if you're going to linger over martini's, make sure your waiter knows not to fire your order until you're ready.  Oh yeah, the martinis are large, cold and good.\n\nOtherwise the service is top notch.  I really like a place where waiters are trained to observe every table, not just their own.  When we needed something, as soon as we looked around for our waiter, another waiter noticed and came over immediately to assist.  As soon as we were done with one course a passing waiter picked up the dishes, checked on our experience so far and asked if there was anything else they could do. That makes for a great dining experience.\n\nThe Porcini rubbed tenderloin in gorgonzola sauce was great.  Ask for extra sauce on the side and you'll get some chunks of gorgonzola in it.  The added texture really helps the sauce. \n\nThe scallops in lobster cream sauce were equally good.  Slightly crisp outside, sweet on the inside, perfectly complemented by the lobster cream sauce.  The vegetables served with the scallops were perfectly done.\n\nThe mushroom ravioli is a must-get.  We always share it, it could easily be a perfect light entree for one.\n\nThe atmosphere is dark (as a steak house should be) but not too dark.  There is none of the pretentiousness of some other houses and the staff are willing to accommodate almost any request.\n\nThanks Nick! \n\n5 stars!", "business_id": "9AbyBqGWHYZC73GlyAuTrQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-10-19", "type": "review"}

I mean who doesn't enjoy an extremely well prepared Filet Mignon accompanied with a succulent lobster tail? Oh Yeah!  So of course we had to go pay Fleming's a visit with some good friends.  We go to Fleming's for their steak because they know how to prepare it better than most!  \n\nFor starters we were treated to a warm, rosemary loaf of bread.  The bread was already very good by itself, but the butters were even better.  I don't remember what each butter flavor was but I liked them both.  I preferred the orange (sun dried tomato maybe?) looking one.  The white one had a bit of a feta cheese taste to it.  We quickly polished off our whole loaf of bread.  Shortly after that, our soups and salads arrived, nothing special to write about here.\n\nNext came our steak and lobster.  The server waited while we cut into our steaks to make sure that it was cooked to the precise way we had requested.  My lovely bride's steak was so small it looked as though it was meant to be on a tasting spoon and not part of a surf & turf. The server apologized and was embarrassed he had not noticed it prior to bringing it to our table and quickly sent for another one.  My steak was perfectly cooked, mid-rare but I could have used a bit more seasoning.  The lobster tail was the highlight for my meal. The lobster came out served on top of its tail shell, but then it was removed by the waiter, (as if I could not handle it on my own :-) The lobster was not at all dry, which I worried about.  It was moist, tender, and was pure lobster deliciousness!\n\nAs we dug into our steaks, we were given sides of asparagus and Fleming's potatoes.  I found the asparagus to be seasoned and cooked very well but a bit overly oily.  The Fleming's potatoes were like layers of lasagna, covered in a creamy sauce.  I've never been a big fan of any creamy potato dish, but this was exceptionally good.  \n\nFor the finale we had Chocolate Lava Cake ~ a rich chocolate cake with a hot molten chocolate center, served with vanilla ice cream and sweet crisp wafers. The warm hot molten center with a scoop of the cool vanilla ice cream was the perfect way to end this wonderful meal.\n\nFleming's is a fantastic place to dine for a couple, family or with good friends.  They are a chain, but they know how to cook steak very well and they are consistent. They have an exceptional wine list, which is what I recommend. Their well drinks are a too pricey (vodka & water X 2 = $24) so stick with wine.", "business_id": "9AbyBqGWHYZC73GlyAuTrQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-11-19", "type": "review"}

Seattle, Washington, high school Senior Prom dinner. Yeah...That far back. That location is now closed, but I digress. When I moved to Scottsdale, I was excited immediately because there were multiple Flemings locations. It quickly became my go to special occasion dinner option, as my wife loves it as well. \n\nIn short, the food is phenomenal. I've had multiple cuts of steak there and different preparations and they're all amazing. Last time I had a 6oz Filet that was stuffed with jumbo lump crab...Just let that sink in for a minute. Their sides and salads are also really nicely done, and their wine list and bar is one of the best out there. They also have a very good happy hour which is a pretty well kept secret. It's 5 items for $6 until 7pm Monday through Friday, and they also have $6 glasses of wine and cocktails as well. \n\nObviously the food should be great, but the thing that sets Flemings apart for me is the service and commitment to quality. A brief story, if I may...\n\nIn July of 2011 I made reservations for my wedding anniversary. We got to the restaurant and were seated, everything started out fine. It took longer than usual to get the bread course and to get our order taken, and since it was a Wednesday night it was a little surprising. Everything was taking forever, but the biggest disappointment was the food. I ordered a New York peppercorn steak medium rare. When it came, it was well done. Brown inside and tough...I sent it back and they were apologetic for the mistake. It took nearly 20 minutes for me to get my second steak (my wife was done eating hers by this time), and while it was still overcooked for my liking, it was edible. The rest of the service continued to take way longer than necessary, the waitress wasn't attentive, and at the end of the meal, there was an issue with the bill that took another 15 minutes to resolve. It took nearly 3 hours (and not in a good way) from start to finish, and was not a good dining experience in the least.\n\nI ended up writing Flemings the next day to express my disappointment, because it was a special occasion, and I'd never before been unhappy with the food or service I received. Within 24 hours, I had an email from the President of the company saying that he was very sorry and he'd have the GM of the restaurant reach out to me to amend any issues. The next day I got a call from the GM Mike Head and we chatted for a few minutes about our experience. He too apologized and asked me for my address so he could send something to make it right. Two days later I had a letter with a business card and a note saying \"please call me personally to arrange your next reservation\", along with $150 in gift certificates. I was floored.\n\nWe've since returned a few times, and the food and service was back to it's absolute best. You will rarely, if ever, see business done like this, and it's the reason I'm happy to keep Flemings as my special occasion go to.", "business_id": "9AbyBqGWHYZC73GlyAuTrQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-11-02", "type": "review"}

Both of us are first-timer at Flemings but really enjoyed our nights. \n\nReservation at 6:30 on a Saturday night in the private room section, a perfect seating for us as it was much quieter. Our dinner consisted a shared plate of calamari, two petite filet with a side of grilled asparagus and sauteed mushroom. \n\nCalamari plate was very big, pre-mixed with the hot n sour (though it says hot and sweet) sauce, not the typical calamari I had tried, especially there were sauteed red pepper, onions and some very sour jalapenos. Overall it was ok, the outside layer of calamari isn't as crispy as I wanted, probably because it was already mixed with sauce.\n\nNow to the main dish, steak!! We both opted for the petite size, it was perfect for us, very well accompanied by the grilled asparagus and sauteed mushrooms. My medium rare filet came out very nice and juicy. If only my mom doesn't eat her steak at well-done, i would have ordered a bigger steak to share (of course to save money too!) oh well, we both only want what we like :p\n\nFor dessert, we chose the famous lava cake. Well, it came out very neat looking with two scoops of ice cream and a little candle, but the cake itself was a bit too bitter for me, it was very very dark chocolate. I normally do like dark chocolate, but this lava cake, if no ice cream was accompanied, i don't know how many bites I could take.\n\n Our overall experience was great, very nice staff and attentive services! And because we went for birthday, yay for a $25 gift card for the next visit !!", "business_id": "9AbyBqGWHYZC73GlyAuTrQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-11-13", "type": "review"}

Now I've been to this location numerous times but granted I did dress in a long sleeve express shirt, jeans and a pair of buckle dress shoes. Not the nicest outfit compare to what people said that if you didn't have a suit on then you didn't get service but I decided to put it to the ultimate test and by the way every man should own 1 nice outfit at least but that is besides the point so here is what I did. \n\nI decided to go as casual as I could. I literally wore a pair of dark grey slack shorts, with a Hurley shirt and pair of old school D.C. Shoes. Now take into consideration I\"m covered in tattoos as well. I had nothing nice on and even wore my ever day citizen watch which I bought at Costco for 250 bucks along with my hundred dollar gift card for 80 bucks which is always a must if you going to Fleming's. Now we went on Sunday for the Prime Rib special and only drank WATER besides a Heineken I ordered after already sitting the second time my waitress came by. Now I keep track of how many times our waitress and her helpers check on us and after 12 times I decided to stop counting. We never had an empty glass of WATER, we never didn't have service, food or anything else we needed. At one point my glass almost got half way empty before it was filled up. Our waitress was amazing and knew the menu back and forth and also was kind enough to suggest any specials they were offering. The manager on hand came by to make sure our meal was to our expectations and stayed to chat with us for a while. \n\nWhen our meal was done our waitress had our extra food bagged and it was not because it was a slow nice. Every table in the main dining area was full and she had her hands full. The service and food was amazing and if you looking for a nice night out and an amazing steak with specials almost all the time and a casual atmosphere then Fleming's is a place for you. Out the door for 3 Prime Rib Specials that included a soup or salad, a side (which for an extra 8 dollars we upgraded to the lobster mash potatoes which were amazing and would recommend doing if they are serving it) a big Prime Rib and dessert for 39.99, plus coffee & beer we only paid $146.00 and of course left 190.00 for the superb service. If you going somewhere nice it's just part of eating. Tip your servers if they work their butts off. Was a great night out with my mom and girl and will be back again soon.

Parking was easy, it's right off the main road so if you're going west on Mcdonald you turn right into the lot.  The inside is decent enough,nice Chicago decor, a few autographed pictures and placards.  The temperature inside was a bit discomforting but since I was picking up a to-go order it was tolerable. We ordered a large cheese pizza, some chicken tenders,and some fries. The chicken was your basic breaded, nothing special, chicken tender, probably bought from Sysco or wherever they purchase their condiments from. The fries were the biggest dissapointment though, they tasted like they'd been microwaved, they were super soft and rubbery, had no texture at all, flavor was ok but way too mushy. The pizza was also dissapointing, it looked like it was gonna be good but I judged it by looks. Its cut into small squares which is fine,but the crust was just not a good thin crust. Maybe they use regular tap-water to make the dough? With the type of tap water we have here it's a big mistake to use it unfiltered.  So you have a great quality cheese,great sauce and flavors,but it's baked onto a crust that is pale,hard,inconsistent, rough to bite through. Maybe it was just me, but I will go back and try some other things because the service was friendly and the hot dogs looked great. Maybe its a better place to eat inside at,because I've never had fries that were so mushy.", "business_id": "n_HvrTuGUgxXJM0yq39-0g", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-09-03", "type": "review"}

Yesterday, I called ahead to make sure our measurements were there, so I could pay for the install and pick countertop options and carpeting.  I get there only to find out they had zero laminate countertop samples because the samples were left in the rain due to the remodel.  He advises me I can drive to a different store to see them.  Keep in mind the next closest stores are far away.  So then, I asked if I could do the paperwork for the carpeting and counters at the same time, since both the sales people were sitting at the desk next to each other, and I had to pick my son up from school (I'd already wasted about 30 minutes while the salesperson found paperwork etc.)  And here is where I should have walked out.\n\nWhen I asked if I could handle both at the same time, the counter top sales rep looked at the carpet rep and said, \"Been a long time since I heard a proposition like that, Kevin.  Both of us at the same time, ha ha ha.\"  My three year old son was in my lap.  I turned bright red.  I was in shock and honestly I should have walked out then and there.  But we have a tight deadline for the project and so I stayed.  The carpet guy walked away and the countertop sales person continued, taking a very long time to complete everything.  I said I had to come back and do the carpet the next day, because I needed to get my son.  I asked if I should come in at the same time, and he said, \"Yes, there will be two people here.\"\n\nSo today, I arrived at 2:15, a full hour before I needed to be anywhere.  The other countertop salesperson was there and said there was only one guy to handle carpet, so I asked about how long it would be.  He went over and asked Kevin, the carpet person, and he said 10-15 minutes, so I waited.  And waited.

I always use their call ahead so we don't have to wait (since they definitely are busy on the weekends).  This weekend they seated our party of 13 Sunday morning as soon as we got there.  \n\nBustling, animated and fun- Chompie's not only offers high quality breakfasts and lunches but a dynamic, fast-pace for dining.  You may need to wait a little bit for your food since they get so busy- but that's part of the experience.  Just keep busy with the various football games displayed on their tvs throughout the restaurant. It's nice too that you can walk through the restaurant and the staff gets to know who you are- that sure doesn't happen at big chains. \n\nPersonally I enjoy their coffee over ice with hazelnut creamer, Chompie's egg breakfast with loose scrambled eggs with american cheese on top, and their everything bagel with olive pimento cream cheese.  Their potato pancakes are incredible with sour cream and apple sauce.  Yum. \n\nGretchen is by far their best server with her 100% accuracy for orders and her charming attitude.

Since I was in the area I decided to stop by for lunch.  The place was packed and I had to wait a few minutes to be seated. While I was waiting I browsed the Bakery side of the joint.  I didn't realize it was a Bakery & a Deli.\n\nThe Bakery had a ton of awesome looking Desserts....I almost scrapped lunch in favor of a Dessert or two, ha!  But my name was called and I went to be seated.\n\nThe food menu is pretty large and I had a tough time selecting a dish.  I asked my server for her opinion and she suggested trying the Sliders and making a combo with the Original Jewish Sliders (Mini Challah Rolls, Brisket, Potato Pancakes, Jack Cheese, Brown Gravy) and the Western Sliders (Mini Challah Rolls, BBQ Brisket, Cheddar Cheese, Onion Strings).....there would be 3 Sliders of my choice and Fries for $11.99.  I decided to go for it and ordered the combo with 1 Original Jewish Slider and 2 BBQ Beef Sliders.\n\nAfter a short wait my food came out.  I couldn't wait to dive into it.  I went for the Jewish Slider first.  I've never had anything like this before.....it was dripping with Gravy.  Took one bite and could taste the Gravy, Potato Pancake, and Jack Cheese immediately....then I could taste the Brisket, which was very moist.  It was pretty good, but I'm not a big fan of Gravy unless it's Thanksgiving.\n\nNext I went for the BBQ Brisket Sliders......they were very tasty.  The proportion of BBQ Sauce and Onion Strings were just right to give it that Sweet & Tangy flavor.  Of the two types of Sliders I prefer the BBQ Sliders over the Jewish Sliders.  The Fries were Breaded Wedge Cut Fries and were awesome......crispy on the outside and moist & soft on the inside.  The spices on the Fries were very good too.\n\nOverall, it was a good meal.  My server was very friendly and checked up on me often to make sure I was satisfied with my meal.  She offered to replace the Jewish Slider if I didn't like it.  I told her that it was good and then she suggested Pumpkin Creme Brulee for Dessert.  I wasn't planning on Dessert, but couldn't resist and said yes.  It came out and the portion was pretty big.....there was no way I could finish it but I gave it a good shot and ate 1/2 of it.  It was very flavorful and gave my meal a nice Holiday Touch.\n\nI enjoyed my meal here and got my money's worth.\n\nWill I return?

I knew I wasn't going to go here for the pizza, but from their menu, I thought I had a good shot at getting a decent hot corned beef on rye with mustard. Wrong. I have ordered a lot of items from Chompie's, the majority of them very good, which is why I gave them 4 stars. They are unique, their menu items are novel and I enjoy the variety. Where they fail, oddly enough is in the basic deli items. Their corned beef was not as tender as it could be. It was not sliced thin, there was not enough fat. Mo H remarked how good the pickles were? Really? I felt they were too soft, and not tart enough, although I do prefer a half sour.\n\nWhere Chompie's hits the mark is with their unique menu items. You must try the \"Jewish sliders.\" This is basically a shabbas meal put on a challah bun. Brilliant. The brisket is amazing. So tender, like butter, the potato pancake is perfect, I don't know why they add cheese, but I would ask them to refrain. It is terrific. Their matzoh ball soup is one of the best I have had. The broth is superb. Not too chickeny, although the cup contains a bounty of carrots and celery, the soup is not overpowered in their flavor. The matzoh ball has the perfect density.\n\nIf you are in for breakfast, try the breakfast skins, but make sure you have about 8 people with you to eat these. Another novel take on something which has become so common, potato skins. Who would have thought about taking a bagel, topping it with scrambled eggs, potatoes, cheese, onions, sour cream. It works, and it is delicious.\n\nThese are the kinds of menu items Chompie's does right. Unfortunately, the corned beef sucks.\n\nDon't leave without buying from the bakery. It is not the best bakery in the world. Canters in LA does better cookies, White Plains bake shop puts everyone else to shame with the cakes, but for Scottsdale, AZ, the black and white cookies are pretty good.", "business_id": "IM-9thHqQbBK5tX5MfTzBQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-09-24", "type": "review"}

To be honest, I am not sure how they stay in business as they lack customer service, attention to detail, etc.  This time I called in a pickup order as I was out running some errands.  Spoke with a gentleman to place the order which consisted of TWO number #1's, scrambled, American Cheese, Bacon on Toasted Gluten Free Bagels.  I swung by and picked up the order, paid $13.08 and then left to go home.  My second mistake, was not checking the order right then and there.  \nWhen I got home, I went and sat down at the kitchen table.  I opened up my first bagel sandwich and sure enough it didn't have any bacon on it.  I also noticed that the Bagel wasn't toasted as I had asked for.  The second bagel sandwich was the same way.  \nDid I pay extra for Bacon?  Of course I did.  Why does this keep happening?  What goes wrong with your process that doesn't allow the credit order to get back to the kitchen to make the sandwiches?  Very frustrating!

I've gotten the Rachel's Ruben every time. It's a turkey Reuben and very tasty. I also have always gotten a bowl of the matzo ball soup with my sandwich. The entire reason I like this place is because of this soup. I wish I knew how to make it, it would save me a lot of money. I love the stuff. The sandwich is good too, but usually I'm just still on cloud nine from the soup I forget that I'm even eating a sandwich. I've had a few different desserts from the case. Very good but a little underwhelming, but that won't stop me from trying more. Last time, we got our food to go, which I kind of preferred. With the exception of the first time being there, we have gone at odd hours of the day and service was lackluster. Barbie is fantastic and we had her during lunch service the first time we went, but since then we have been seated and then NO ONE has come to our table. This is three of the four times we have had a meal in the dining room. In fact I think two of those three times I've had to wave the host down to tell her and another time I waved a server down and she hesitantly said she would be our server. It's just so bizarre. Even though our tab is usually around $35, I hate throwing away another $7 to a server for lousy service, but I also think it's lousy to under tip as I am a server myself. So that's my two cents on that. I think we have resolved to just get take out from now on. Save the extra $7.

I don't care, because I love this place! I grew up eating here, and now I come here every single time I visit Scottsdale - AND I recommend it to everyone I know who visits as well. I've probably eaten twice my weight in Szechuan Stringbeans over the years, and triple my weight in Szechuan Eggplant + Tofu.\n\nHere's why I love it:\n\nIt's NOT OILY like most Chinese food places. It TASTES AMAZING (I highly recommend the Szechuan dishes). And they are willing to add or substitute items to your dish to FIT YOUR CRAVINGS. Beat that, Panda Suck-spress! And it's all MADE FRESH and FAST in a hot wok, right there in front of you!\n\nRecommendations: Get the loose-leaf hot tea, it's delicious and served in a fun mug. Get an order of the Szechuan Stringbeans (with your choice of protein, I recommend tofu), and an order of Szechaun Eggplant (also with your choice of protein), and douse everything in some healthy scoops of chili sauce to hike up the spice factor. You'll notice that the Szecuan sauce varies from dish-to-dish. The stringbeans are very sweet and savory with a thin sauce, while the eggplant's sauce is much thicker and more savory. Totally different, but equally delicious.\n\nHaving moved to LA, China Lite is like the \"one that got away\" - I measure every other Chinese food restaurant I try up to them, and everyone else can't help but pale in comparison.", "business_id": "aLZoFhOmDtonrWJzUzh8TA", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-10-23", "type": "review"}

Probably my favorite Caesar salad right now, great sides and their burgers and ribs are amazing.\n\nLast night, I had the Hickory burger and a caesar, while my wife had a salad and a baked potato. Both of us thoroughly enjoyed our meals, and the service was impeccable.  Seems like the service really sets Houston's apart from a lot of other restaurants. My water glass would be close to empty, and then all of a sudden I'd look over and it would be full...They must hire food and water ninjas that sneak up on you and provide great service. I'm not complaining.\n\nI've yet to order a steak there, but I hear they're good. There are a lot of other places that I'd rather order a steak though, so I think I'll stick to my standbys.  \n\n4 stars because it's always a wait...Always. I know, I know, it's not Houston's fault, it's the fault of the country club snowbirds that park their range rovers and make me jealous that I don't have that kind of money. Kidding...Sort of. Seriously though, if you go on a Wednesday at 4:30pm, expect to wait 10 minutes. Lunch can be a 15-20 minute wait usually and peak dinner times can be 30-45 minutes. Houston's does take reservations, so if you're planning on going there for dinner, it's best to call at least an hour ahead and make a reservation. \n\nIf you've yet to dine at Houston's, do it ASAP. If you haven't been in a while, go back. Highly recommend.", "business_id": "jBb5KHHAj4s8hcXVS6QXDg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-11-24", "type": "review"}

We were greeted and seated immediately. We started with a couple cocktails: martini for me, Manhattan for my mom. Our server was very nice and respectful of our request to catch up over our drinks. \nFor old time sake, I had to go for the Chicago-Style Spinach Dip. I do wish they had a better selection of starter. It's between the dip and some smoked salmon thing. Talk about limited ...\nFor our entrees, we went for salads: Ahi Tuna for me and Thai Noodle for my mom. Both came out perfectly prepared and timed. We also switched to wine with our entree salads. The wine list is nice, high quality selections. Something for everyone. \nI'm not the biggest chain restaurant fan, but Houston's does it right.

My cat gets better dental care than I do! \n\nDr. Visser and his staff are very welcoming, compassionate, and informative. You know how sometimes you get the sense that your questions and concerns seem like a burden the staff at a dental or medical clinic (human or animal) would really rather not, or simply haven't the time, to deal with? Completely opposite experience here.\n\nWe were referred to AZVDS West by our regular vet, who noticed signs of gum and periodontal disease on our cat's last check-up - and we owe him some serious gratitude. After Dr. Visser took a quick peek into my (very terrified) cat's mouth, checking his teeth and tonsils, he walked me through a prepared presentation explaining what he was likely to find once my cat was put under for x-rays, and gave me the opportunity to voice any questions/concerns I had before bringing his patient into the back  The administrative staff then came in to go over the estimate with me - point by point. She was very pleasant, and more than happy to indulge me in looking at a few photos of what my cat really looks like, when he isn't hiding in the back of a carrier.\n\nThey kept me updated on my cat's status throughout the surgery, even emailing me pictures. When I went to pick my cat up, Dr. Visser again sat with me, showing me the x-rays that had been taken, as well as pictures from the surgery, and invited me to ask questions. He made sure I had a copy of the x-rays and photos, as well as a copy of the bloodwork, a breakdown of the anesthesia administered, a log of my cat's vitals during surgery (at 15min intervals), antibiotics, pain killers, discharge instructions, the Doctor's cell number and a secondary contact - just in case.\n\nI felt great walking out the door, and even better when, later that evening, Dr. Visser personally called me to check that his patient was doing well - and not a quick \"How is he?\", he asked direct, pointed questions so he could be sure the cat was recovering well. He also gave me yet another opportunity to ask questions.\n\nAnother reviewer pointed out the cost. It is high, absolutely - but I'd mention that, after receiving the estimate, I called my vet at Banfield to compare. He recommended we continue with the surgery at AZVDS nor only because it was more efficient - Banfield lacks the dental x-ray machine and since cats need to be put under for the x-rays, it's much safer to have the work done at the same time, but also because the cost difference would not have been significant. \n\nIf you've gotta part with the money anyway, Arizona Veterinary Dental Specialists offers a great deal for it.", "business_id": "ki7fhvs8IctEtqltTpZTYw", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-10-21", "type": "review"}

I just want to temper the reviews with some reality about what to expect...\n\nInitially I ate breakfast only, and generally the same item, #8 (2 eggs, two bacon or sausage, hash brown or country potatoes, and toast). They learned to cook my eggs perfectly, my bacon crispy, and my country potatoes crisp and with onions (the hash browns are tasteless and not crisp at all). I also occasionally enjoyed Randy's Breakfast, substituting a waffle for the short stack of pancakes. I tried the chicken fried steak and eggs, but the chicken fried steak was soggy (not crisp) and pretty tasteless, and I tried their corned beef hash, which was very salty and tasted canned. That was easily solved by sticking to my favorites, which have been consistently excellent.\n\nMorning service was always GREAT! They have wonderful staff, ALWAYS make you feel welcome, and work to ensure that your order comes out correctly and QUICKLY. They are super fast and super attentive!  \n\nThat said, as long as I stuck to my familiar breakfast items, I was on very safe and tasty terrain. \n\nFast forward to my more recent experiences since older (much) friends of mine have encouraged me to venture beyond breakfast at Randy's. \n\nI haven't had anything from their lunch or dinner menu that was better than average - at best - but often sub par. I'll give them props on their mashed potatoes, but the commercial gravy is awful, and I can't speak well of anything else except that their seasonal daily specials are only $5.50, and that buys a great deal of forgiveness for so-so cafeteria quality food.\n\nIf you are not that picky, you will be fine, but there is nothing remarkable for which to be here after breakfast unless you just want to fill up. \n\nI don't object to the lack of ambiance - the staff more than makes up for it - service trumps all. I also have no quarrel at all with their cash policy. It isn't as if Randy's is pretentious. I wouldn't compare lunch and dinner here to home cooked food, unless you expect food overcooked, and a great deal of the home pantry to be filled with processed ingredients.\n\nAfter such great breakfasts, I was seriously let down by the rest of the menu.  I'll continue to return for the things that I love, and leave it at breakfast.", "business_id": "68_EJEA9Ibo55EDp3d-nOg", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-09-08", "type": "review"}

I was coming off of a horrible, stressful Monday in Corporate America. I was greeted by a friendly receptionist and also the owner of the spa, Heidi Lamar. \n\nIt's nice to see someone have a dream and pursue it with passion and excitement. Heidi Lamar is doing just that. The interior of the spa is nice and clean. It has a natural feel with all of the hardwood floors throughout the building. \n\nI was invited to start ridding myself of stress by doing a paraffin dip on my hands. That was heavenly and I felt my cares melting away slowly. I then was taken on a tour of the entire facility. The place is HUGE and very nice! I went back into the common area and was invited to have a chair massage... ahhhh this evening is getting better and better! After my massage, I had my gnarly brows waxed. It's amazing what a little hair removal can do for your face. I highly recommend getting your brows done here to guys and girls! The aesthetician that did my brows was not only good, but she was educational about my skin and brows. After all that, I sat down to get my makeup touched up. This is where I wasn't as pleased. Bless the guy's heart, the artist had NO clue on what colors to use on my skin. He was SO excited to do my makeup, so I let him just go to town! I looked like a really dark Barbie with really BRIGHT lipstick... can you say radioactive tangerine lips? If you want something done right... do it yourself. Ahh well, my makeup is a mystery to many artists. It wasn't his fault. He tried.\n\nIs it the Phoenician? No. It's an \"Everyday Spa\" that is comfortable and clean with super friendly and professional staff. I hope to visit Lamar Spa again, to spend the day and be pampered! For now...

Go in here expecting just that, and you won't be disappointed.  While the amenities are a bit older than other spas, and a bit more basic, if you get a service such as a massage, it includes use of the facilities for the whole day.  We had a couple's massage here, and the massage therapist did a pretty good job with working out the omnipresent knots in my back and shoulders.  It was a good mix of relaxation and therapeutic massage.  At $210 for both of us, it seemed a bit pricey to me, although since it is a spa environment in Scottsdale, higher prices are to be expected.  They also have a harsh cancellation policy that I wish I could get away with at my own business and still stay afloat!  If you cancel within 24 hours of your appointment time, they will charge you the full amount of your service.  To be charged $210 if an emergency or something happened within 24 hours and I couldn't make the appointment made me feel a bit uneasy- good thing it was a normal day for me!\n\nWe were excited to try out the facilities, but there are a few things that need to be updated or fixed.  For instance, the steam room was lukewarm and it seemed like the controls were broken.  The steam room itself is very basic, with blue tile, and just steam, no other therapeutic scents.  There is a pool and jacuzzi outside, which we used for a bit.  There were a lot of leaves in the pool, and there was some dirt both in the pool and the jacuzzi accumulating.  They have flotation noodles and pool rafts for you to use to float in the pool with, but the pool rafts were very dirty and caked with sand, even after trying to rinse off all the dirt with water.  The whirlpool itself is a nice hot temperature, but the knob to activate the \"whirlpool\" feature was missing so we sat in hot, calm water rather than whirlpool type water.  Another option that I found missing was a \"cold\" room so that you can alternate between a hot environment and a cold to invigorate the senses.\n\nThey have a bar with fresh fruit, iced water, iced tea, coffee, and a nice selection of hot teas to choose from when you are relaxing in the atrium.  \n\nIn general, while Spa Lamar is a decent place to get a spa service from, it isn't the most posh.  So far I'd say the best experience I've had in Arizona would be at Joya, but prices here are more reasonable than Joya, so it is true that you get what you pay for.", "business_id": "EaziHWcmjm5nGmPF-CJgQA", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-09-10", "type": "review"}

We are Hilton Honors members so we checked out Hilton facilities first. The reviews we read before booking concerned us a bit because there was a few complaining of the \"Tired\" condition of the property. Yet when we examined the location, the ability of this Doubletree to address all our needs and at a reasonable price compared to other hotels, we decided to book it and make the best of it.\nWhen we arrived we were pleased to see we were in a wonderful neighborhood. The hotel grounds were expansive. Yes the exterior was dated but still retains the old town Scottsdale charm. The lobby was clean, inviting and modern. When we walked to our room we were greeted by the aromas of the lush landscaping right after a good downpour of welcomed rain. One of the benefits of an older facility is the maturity of the landscaping. We passed by many inviting pools and fountains and a lovely Cactus garden. Our room was lovely and clean with an inviting patio to sit out and enjoy the early mornings with a hot cup of Joe. I was awaken early by the beautiful singing of hundreds of very happy birds gathering in the trees. So much nicer than hearing cars. As I stepped out onto the patio I was able to observe rabbits down on the lawn feeding. \nWe went into the dining area to have breakfast. We were very pleased with the vast selection of food from the buffet. It far exceeded our expectations. \nLater in the day we headed over to the bar to have a drink and watch the Monday night football games. Unfortunately the games we wanted to see we couldn't. The bar does not have the NFL package. But they did have a great bartender and a decent selection of quality libations to drowned our football viewing disappointments. Fortunately we had our phones and could watch our game on our phone at the bar. Before we knew it we had several other customers watching our games with us and having a great time meeting new people. We wanted to eat dinner but didn't want to take our game into the elegant dining room. Our bartender Scott showed us the bar menu and informed us he could order us anything on the restaurant menu also, to eat at the bar. Sweet! We ordered the bacon wrapped shrimp appetizer and the lobster/crab cakes. The food was presented and served beautifully. It was done to perfection! \nThe next night we ate at the restaurant. Our server James was so professional.  He was able to answer all our questions about the menu. I being a foodie was a little scared about what the food was going to be like. There were very few customers in the restaurant and I automatically assumed that equated to poor food because it isn't feasible to keep a quality chef on staff when there isn't the customer base to support one. I was so wrong. All the food we had at this hotel was wonderful! We stayed here a week and only went out for one dinner to meet with others on the other side of town.\nThe classroom we booked was a stadium style seating, class. It had new carpet installed. All the desk/table tops had outlets for our students to plug in their laptops. It worked perfectly for classroom needs. The food we ordered to feed our students was served elegantly and was far better than any other lunch we've had during class/teaching events we've been at across the country. All our students whom attended the 2 day class were asking if we could do this again soon because they enjoyed so much the facility and the food. They said it made class enjoyable. Way to go Doubletree!\nThe bar area was the place many guests would gather after the work day. All the bar and restaurant staff got to know us and they were all very good to us. \nThere were just a few things that we would recommend that the hotel may want to address. The bar area should be updated cosmetically. The ceiling, lighting of the lounge could use an update. If you had the NFL package you could keep your guests from having to leave and go to other locations to spend their money and watch the games. I know your not going for the Sports Bar feel in your bar but you do have guests staying there during football season and it was sad to see so many guests scrambling to find somewhere else to go to watch a game when they could be in your bar, eating your food and buying your drinks. Most importantly not getting out onto the road having had a few. Hence why we watched the game on our phone at your bar.\nOur overall experience with this hotel was very good and we favor good food, good drinks and above all good service when staying away from home. Therefore we will definitely be returning for all our Phoenix visits.", "business_id": "CD-2yHTSObgvAhW-pYHfMw", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-09-24", "type": "review"}

Sadly, we dId not realize that until we were unpacked and settling in.  I would definitely have made a change had we seen the bathroom before unpacking. Not sure what else might have been available though, the hotel seemed full, we decided it wasn't a big deal.

Delivered promptly and, once again the staff was great.\n\nThe housekeeping staff kept our room looking great.  \n\nAnother frustration though was the way each standard wastebasket was divided into two. One side for trash,the other for recycling.  Not terribly practical because of the size.  They seemed to constantly be overflowing... Seems like one full receptacle dedicated to either would have been more efficient.  I know. Picky, picky.\n\nWe would return, making sure we had a more functional space for our needs.

The prices were higher then I would like, but reasonable.   This place is HUGE!  I was lucky enough to get a close room, but others in our group had long walks to the other side of the hotel.  The room we stayed in was nice, decent beds, great window/sliding glass doors and view.  We stayed in a double in the Hilton Honors Member first floor hallway and it was rather large with lots of space for luggage.  The wifi was great when you were on it, but I had to continuously log back in on both my phone and iPad, which is a bit annoying, I prefer the wifi servers that let you stay logged in as long as you are connected to it.  The fridge was OLD and did not get cold at all, plus it was an old mini bar fridge and still had all the separators inside, so nothing can sit flat.  The doors on the cabinet were really junky too, I was sure they were going to fall off at some point, luckily they didn't while we were there.  Good luck to the next peeps!  \n\nThere are 2 pools, so you can pick and choose if one is really busy.  The North pool felt more like the adult pool with lots of lounge chairs, a cocktail/snack bar plus a hot tub.  The South pool has a playground next to it and lots of sand which meant lots of bugs when we were there.  The lobby bar was pretty decent but closes early.  I didn't eat in any of the restaurants, but my friend was excited they had a Starbucks counter in the cafe area.  We did have a catered brunch event in one of the meeting rooms, which was really nice. Food was good and service seemed pretty efficient too.  The hotel location was nice for me, with a few stores within a mile for anything I needed.

Resorts have guest-room doors on the inside.  This is a motel.  It's a nice motel, but when you drive up to your room and walk to the door of your room, you are staying at a motel, not a resort. \n\nSecond, when you check into a resort the desk clerk does not reply with a curt \"Name!\" when you tell her you've used the online check-in.\n\nThird, resorts have nicely appointed rooms, not rooms with strange empty spaces and mismatched furniture. Resorts also don't have large empty cabinets that don't seem to serve any purpose.  There's room for a refrigerator in the 3 empty cabinets, but none exists.  As I consider my room, I'm pretty sure I'm sleeping in converted meeting space. \n\nHousekeeping departments at resorts get plenty of training and are provided checklists that prevent dust from collecting on lamps an picture frames (like the dust had collected in my room).  I didn't dare check under the bed. \n\nResorts have plenty of food and beverage outlets that are available for their guests' convenience.  This place had everything closed before 8pm except the lobby bar that was staffed by only one person.  She was very nice and deserves to work at a better place. The pizza was OK. \n\nFinally, resorts have beautifully appointed grounds.  This place may have that, but at night the entire area is dark and creepy, so I couldn't really tell.  It's really really dark. It's also accessible from many different areas from the parking lot.  If I wasn't a big burly dude, I would not feel safe. \n\nIf I can find another Hilton property, I'm checking out of this motel early.", "business_id": "CD-2yHTSObgvAhW-pYHfMw", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-09-13", "type": "review"}

Outside noise is seldom heard and never loud enough to disturb. The breakfast buffet is phenomenal and includes tons of choices, as well as fresh made to order eggs and omelets. Room service breakfast also arrives quickly and piping hot. There is a pool and hot tub at each end of the hotel, and every room has a balcony or deck. Most of the rooms are arranged around a central courtyard and the views from the balconies are pleasant. There are multiple tennis courts, a putting green, a bar, and a restaurant on site, and for those of us who like to sleep in, the rooms have black-out drapes that actually do keep the room nice and dark.

Dr. Mike talked us through our options and it became clear that our little guy was suffering and was not going to get better. We made the difficult decision to put him to sleep a few days later.

The vet came in and was so soothing and understanding, giving our boy a full check-up to make sure the diagnosis was correct before putting him down.

It doesn't really matter if you want to go big or be frugal, I'm sure they have something for you. \n\nLastly, I peruse the accessories.  This is where I get into trouble.

It's natural, when you have people taking them to parties and doing all sorts of God knows what in them... but I think some of them need some serious work if I'm going to pay good money to rent them. I wanna look good, damnit!\n\nHappy costuming!", "business_id": "uPGeM_erzusd2oRc6rZvyg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-10-26", "type": "review"}

The goal was to have a common area to meet during the night, yet sleep in separate quarters.  Many hotels had connecting rooms, but not the living space we desired.  Most condos or villas were either too expensive or required a weekly reservation.  Hilton Resort seemed to have it all including a separate pool for the villas away from the main hotel.  \n\nUltimately I'm torn between liking and disliking the villa unit.  The amenities were great and everything we wanted was included (separate rooms, living room, close parking, a pool), BUT the furnishings were dated, worn, and in some cases in disrepair.  The bar chairs were ripped, the patio umbrella wooden spindles broken.  The pool was super small with low end chairs and no tables.  The room was dark and the patio area faced a wall and the backside of other villas.  The saving grace was the cost in comparison to other accommodations with the same amenities.  Would I go there again?  Maybe.  Was it worth it?  I guess.  Does it look like the advertised pictures?  Definitely not.  Would I stay there for an entire week?

My first complaint is the lack of staffing either available, or willing to help.  Rarely do they have more than one or two aisles open for checkout, and even the self service checkout is run by one of the cashiers inconveniently located at the single open checkout lane.  Therefore, anyone checking out in self service that has (1) any alcoholic beverages, (2) any coupons, (3) has to input their phone number for their Bashas \"rewards\" because they don't have their card with them ,(4) wants to pay by check, (5) has fruit/vegetables that don't show up on the screen as options, (6) well....you get the point - ALL have to wait for the cashier to leave their station to come re-instate your checkout after it's been frozen by the automated system.  In addition, this morning I ran into Bashas on my way to work for my staple morning Diet Coke, and EVERY lane (including all of the self checkout lanes) was roped off except one.  There were no less than 6 people in line ahead of me, all with significant groceries, and the checkout clerk (who was working at the speed of molassas) didn't call for additional assistance until 4 more people joined the line behind me.  And even then, no one came to help.  \n\nIn addition to the terrible (and terribly slow) service, the location of products on occasion mystifies me.  Why is the canned tuna located in the Asian section?  Why are tortillas located at the end of the chip aisle (rather than the Mexican section?)  The don't even CARRY Truffle Oil!  \n\nThe only thing I really like about this Bashas is it's cool wine chiller.  Place a room temperature bottle of wine in the chiller for no more than 4 minutes, and you're ready to join your party with a perfectly chilled Chardonnay.  That is why they get the one star I'm offering them.", "business_id": "X2CvejXoxpIOr8j6O-gM7A", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-11-05", "type": "review"}

Naturally, we ate there for dinner on the first night...I was shocked by the service and quality of the food in all the best ways.  There are two sides to the restaurant - the bar side and the dinning side.  We spent all our time in the dining side because of our group size, but 1-4/5 people would do just fine in the bar side of things.\n\nThere's a menu left in your room at all times so you can order their food as roomservice and here are all the things I tried:\n\n-The Cowboy Club: Amazing variation of a club sandwich that I will have to make at home because it's probably one of the best i've ever had.\n\n-Bbq Chicken Pizza: Shared on the first night, this thing is massive but for 6 people was just the right size (a personal size pizza is about the size of a medium 10 slicer from pizza hut while the full size is as long as the round table we were sitting at).  Highly recommend this one, amazing flavours!\n\n-the 1/2 order Macho Taco done with the breaded fish fillet: unless you can eat a horse I don't recommend doing a full order, these things are huge, but they are so insanely good you have to try at least one!!  I did mine with fries and honey mustard dip.\n\n-Soups:  I did the Gazpacho, the Chicken Tortilla, and the Chicken Noodle...I loved every single one of them.  The chicken noodle was on the menu the day the bf needed it the most and we all had some with garlic toast.\n\n-Garlic bread basket: you get a ton but it's absolutely delicious!  Soft and flavourful, not dry and crunchy.\n\n-Fries: If you get the sweet potato I suggest you ask for the chipotle mayo, if you get the regular they're lightly battered like some fries are and they're great with any dipping sauce.\n\n-Scottsdalian chicken salad: Massive but absolutely delicious!  The pinenuts and pesto sauce just make it work.  And they aren't skimpy on the chicken!\n\n-Onion Petals or Fried Zucchini: I suggest you go for both...seriously...the onion petals were just right on the onion to batter ratio, and the zucchini came as rounds not sticks and the batter was seasoned so they were super delicious and not so juicy they were scalding like you normally get!\n\n-Florentine Cheese Dip: it's like a queso cheese sauce done awesome.  You get enough to share and it's got a huge punch of flavour you just won't get enough of!\n\n-Chicken Tenders: Again not skimpy on the chicken and cooked just right!  Highly recommend with either the bbq or honey mustard sauces.  Done buffalo style they're delicious!\n\n-Rib Eye steak dinner: Great steak, they know how to treat a rib eye cut properly!  The baked potato needed a bit more sour cream but I'm a sour cream addict so it may be just right for normal people ;)  The vegetables that came with the steak were simply impossible not to inhale!\n\nThe front of house manager was a hoot the entire time we were there, though we only saw him the first two of the dinners we had in the restaurant proper, and as a treat for their anniversary he had a dessert brought out which was their brownie sundae...not recommended for a single person (unless you skip dinner), it was absolutely delicious and very easy to polish off between the six of us.\n\nThe manager also was kind enough to send a bottle of merlot to their room as a surprise, what a nice guy!\n\nWe will definitely eat there again even if we're not staying in the hotel next time.", "business_id": "bx5Yc7-_E8wz3Lahpq88mQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-11-16", "type": "review"}

We spent one week with them as a family, had rooms side by side so that we could interact with each other without interfering with other people, and we were stationed right by the elevators so getting our golf clubs up and down from the rooms four days out of the week was a snap!\n\nThe hot/cold breakfast included was amazing - we never went hungry and the quality was incredible considering it was free!  No cheap-ass muffins and dry toast...you had eggs cooked to order, french toast, pancakes, sausage or bacon (or both as we discovered if you asked nicely), cereal, hashbrowns, so much food you left stuffed...\n\nThe hotel restaurant also did all the roomservice and the portion sizing was amazing considering the pricing and quality...you got amazing food and you almost never had room for desert.\n\nThe housekeeping staff were friendly, quick, and didn't touch our personal stuff unless it was to condense it to one spot so they could clean around it, so very honest.  I even found one of the lightbulbs had burned out two nights before we were to come home and after leaving a note with the bulb on a counter, we came back from golf to find the bulb replaced and working again.  If we had a spoon for stirring hot chocolate filched from breakfast, they never took it away.  The extra blanket we'd ordered on the second day was never taken away like they normally do in other hotels - they just let you have it until you either check out or ask for it to be removed.\n\nThe gift shop was significantly lower on their pricing than the airport for the same items, so i was happy that I'd bought stuff there rather than wait until later.  Everybody was super friendly!\n\nThe property was clean, quiet, and although you could hear the fountain from the sitting room the bedroom could be completely closed off by two sets of doors (one set on either side of the bathroom door creating a mini hallway).  It was bright, cool, and the only issue I had was trying to open the bedroom window which was a bit stiff.\n\nThe hotel is 15 minutes walk from Old Town Scottsdale, and a 2-5 minute walk from two amazing restaurants - Taggia and the Roaring Fork.  It is within easy 5-30 min drives from approximately 200 golf courses, and we even did a sidejaunt up to Taliesin to see Frank Lloyd Wright's home and still-functioning school for the Taliesin fellowship for architecture.\n\nWe will definitely be staying there again.", "business_id": "Xe-zwcsX5EikIK6Ul5bGlw", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-11-16", "type": "review"}

It about a 15-20 minute walk to Fashion Square. It's also close to Old Town. \n\nWe were able to get good savings from hotels.com. I have seen Living Social offers so discounts so there are other ways to get discounts. We were able to save quite a bit of money since the hotel offered a free shuttle to and from the airport. They also offered free hot breakfast that was made to order. There was happy hour from 5:30-7:30 pm. \n\nOur room included a living room, kitchenette, two TVs, and an additional sink in the bedroom. The additional sink was great for my aunt and I especially when we needed to get ready at the same time. \n\nThere is also a Dollar Rent A Car on site. Renting a car is easy, and they do offer an AMEX discount. Concierge was very helpful as they booked our Sedona tour prior to our arrival. Some of the front desk staff were more friendlier and nicer than others. \n\nUnfortunately, the place especially the courtyard area did not look as pretty as the pictures. Although the rooms are nice and clean, I agree with other Yelpers that it does need a renovation. \n\nI recommend this hotel if you are not going to be on site the majority of the time and for the great amenities.

Sister and dad had a cheeseburger and for whatever reason I decided I was really hungry and to go for the The Big Bopper Burger (double decker burger with melted american cheese and Kenny's special sauce). Wow. I have eaten a lot of burgers but this thing was about 3x the size of any double cheeseburger I've ever had.

We ordered a Maytag dishwasher, paid for installation and when the delivery guys showed up, they said they can't install because we have copper plumbing. When I made the purchase, the sales rep only mentioned that the hoses might not be long enough. He never mentioned that their delivery company can't install dishwashers with copper plumbing. The delivery guy said to call the store and they should be able to get people to the house who can install the dishwasher. But when I spoke with Home Depot, the employee told me it was \"unheard\" of for copper plumbing and he would have to get back with us on this. Unbelievable! So I called another Home Depot in Scottsdale and was told this was wrong and very strange and to discuss with the store we bought the dishwasher from. Well, they don't seem to care. While I write this, we should have a new dishwasher but it's sitting out on the back porch. Thanks Home Depot for nothing! Lousy lousy lousy service. We called a plumber and will get this installed next week. We did get a refund over the phone for the installation charge without a problem. The odd thing is the employee didn't even care. It seems this issue was too difficult to deal with so he'd rather refund us. So sad to see such bad service. Next time Lowe's. Home Depot NEVER AGAIN! If you buy from this store, make sure you ask lots of questions because the sales people are only interested in getting your money and don't care what happens after that. Good riddance Home Depot!!!\n\nUPDATE: The store OPs manager called me in regards to an email I sent to Home Depot's Customer Care department. He apologized and informed me this was a \"training\" issue and was being dealt with. He did go on to explain that the salespeople in Appliances had a lot going on with all the recent flurry of sales but \"this isn't an excuse\" he made sure to point out. In my opinion, telling a customer their salespeople are swamped and overloaded really only makes things seem worse. Why would someone shop at a store where the employees get overwhelmed during sales or busy holiday seasons and can't function properly? I worked at a department store, a grocery store and in customer service so I understand retail and certainly would never consider making this kind of statement. I think \"training issue\" is the standard customer service reply and should stop there. The OPs manager did offer to have their plumber come out and evaluate the situation but I declined.

Thought I would give it a try.\n\nAfter reading several reviews on Yelp, it helped me to decide this was the place to get my lunch. I walked in and Tina was eager to welcome me and quickly take my order. I mentioned that it was my first time and knew they were a cash only establishment so I wanted to make sure I stayed within the cash that I had on hand.\n\nGot a half Italian with onion and just the way they make it. Nothing extra or added. DELISH!!! The aroma from the oil blended with the herbs were the first thing that I smelt when opening the sandwich. The bread was soft and contents were fresh!\n\nI opted to get a side of potato salad from reading the reviews of it. OMG!!! I don't know that anything can take me away from NOT ordering that every time I come back. The potatoes are cut almost like an au gratin type cut which makes it so nice and filling (even with the small cup that you are served). It was creamy and the blend of sweet and tart made it just a wonderful delight!! Who doesn't love a good potato salad!\n\nNext I got a cannolli. Being born on Long Island, New York and going back to visit family, that every time you go you have to visit the bakery to get fresh cannollies to bring them home to the parents back in Arizona. THIS CANNOLLI WAS EVERYTHING THE REVIEWS SAID THEY WERE. The cream was just sweet enough filled all the way though the shell (the way it should be!!!) and creamy as can be. PERFECTION!!! I just found my new place to get my parents their craving for New York style cannollies!\n\nWhen I get the craving for a sandwich, I'll be putting this place on the map of go to places first!! To get all that I did on just over $7.00 for lunch it was perfect!\n\nMy co-worker is now planning on visiting for dinner for her and her husband tomorrow night on her way home!", "business_id": "kEyCMHBnohaWc81omLDfYg", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-09-06", "type": "review"}

I showed up with a friend of mine for lunch on a Monday (I had the day off work) and we were informed right away it is a CASH-ONLY joint....so we took a trip down the strip mall to the grocery store to retrieve cash and came back.  We both opted for the Italian Sub with two large drinks, which came to around $17.  I would say the sandwiches were about 10inches long and they came with no accompanying side dishes.  The meats on the sub were good with the perfect amount of dressing so the bread didn't get all mushy.  And the drinks came with free refills.  You can tell the place has been around for a very long time and the people who work there are very nice.  I thought the food was decent, but I lived in Europe and and an Italian neighborhood in NYC, so my expectations are very high when it comes to Italian delis.", "business_id": "kEyCMHBnohaWc81omLDfYg", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-09-20", "type": "review"}

They also have a lunch menu but I typically stick to breakfast. \n\nYou really can't go wrong with anything on the menu and if you are looking for a classic breakfast at a reasonable price, this is your spot. Be warned that they do get crowded on the weekends,", "business_id": "GhhpkAkGl4JE_M_Szwegeg", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-11-12", "type": "review"}

In fact, one visit to US Egg a few years back resulted in the worst experience with a waitress we ever had, they were rude and said, \"absolutely no substitutes\" and other events that day that meant my wife and daughter now boycott the US Egg..anyway..back to my review of The Good Egg. \nThe entire staff is super friendly. They act like they enjoy working there. I think they actually do! So it is a very nice, friendly place to be on a weekend morning. And even when they are packed, they have the whole system figured out. \nOk...now for the extra impressive part. Not only did they change the pumpkin pancake with pecans to be a pumpkin pancake without pecans...they made cinnamon butter for us and they do not even have cinnamon butter! But wait there is more! They made a grilled cheese sandwich for my wife and it's not even on the menu! \nIt's just everything you want in a breakfast place.

I was on my way to the airport to fly out later that afternoon, so we wanted to eat somewhere close by, and this place was near to where she lived.\n\nWhen we went in, the place wasn't busy at all, we were seated right away, and the server seemed nice enough.  I requested some warm water and lemon wedges (as I drink warm lemon water in the morning before I eat anything), and the server obliged.  For her main, my friend ordered eggs, potatoes, pancakes, and orange juice, and I ordered the avocado toast with basted eggs.  I asked the server how were basted eggs prepared; she admitted she wasn't sure, and smartly went to ask someone who knew.  She came back and gave me the description (sunny-side up eggs fried on one side, then flipped over and steamed), which I appreciated.  That avocado toast was ON POINT!  It was incredibly delicious and satisfying, with a little bit of lemon squeezed over the top.  YUMMMM!  The basted eggs weren't flavorful enough for me, but a little bit of salt helped out in that area.   Unfortunately, the server forgot to bring my friend her orange juice at the beginning of our service, and she had to flag the server down two or three times to get her attention.

My son is now 5 and in his fourth play at DST.  This time he plays Asst to Drake and Asst Police Officer in Annie Jr. and has two lines to say, \"Call him!\" and \"Yes sir!\"  The amazing part of all this is watching him develop as an actor and also his love for theatre.  \n\nSince he is 5, I don't put any pressure on him when it comes to \"learning his lines\" and play practices and it touches me that despite the rigorous play practice schedule, he never says he doesn't want to go to practice.  In fact, he looks forward to it.  He's there because he wants to be there.\n\nAnd it surprises me when he comes home and tells me things like \"we are going off script next week\" and life skills like \"even when you forget what you are suppose to do, don't stop, just keep going\", \"smile when the audience is watching you\", \"show up on time.\" \n\nAnd it surprises me even more when he starts singing the songs memorized from attending play practices and reciting complete scenes playing the different characters.\n\nThe best part though is that I know he's old enough now and DST is a completely safe environment  that I just drop him off at the backstage door and I no longer go in with him for play practices.  It's like a rite of passage that he's growing up.\n\nSpeaking of rites of passages, I've observed other actors who stuttered or were very shy when I met them 2 years ago stuttering less and becoming less shy.  It just touches me that there is a nuturing place like the DST for the children to come.\n\nNot to mention the directors are always amazing and wonderful.  For each of his plays, my son has worked with a different director and each time, I am blown away and completely impressed at the maturity and vision of the directors.  The cast is big because they want to give as many children as possible the opportunity to be in a play and every time, by the time tech week is over, the play is entertaining and professional.\n\nThis time, the director was Angela Kreiss and she was just unbelievably fantastic.  Annie Jr. is a fabulous play to watch for both adults and children.\n\nYou can't go wrong whether you are thinking of getting your child into theatre or want to watch a play by coming to DST . . . have I mentioned how great I think this place is??", "business_id": "VlHp9AFc9repIF6braYCCg", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-11-30", "type": "review"}

I am a very social person and I consider this as over the top behavior. \n\nI visited the Scottsdale Fashion Park location this weekend already knowing whats in store from the sales people based on experiences I've already had there. My girlfriend and I reluctantly went into the store to within moments have a sales girl follow us around with her obviously forced small talk. I picked up a shirt as my girl browsed a separate rack trying to get her away from us, but she didn't take the hint. The sales girl then went on to try to convince me to purchase an item I already put back on the rack...seriously? She asked what I do for a living which is fine although bordering on personal. Among the onslaught of irritating interaction and unnecessary, obviously forced questioning she was pestering us about where we live and what we were doing . This continued as we were pulling the dressing room door shut. Seriously, take a hint and let us at least try things on in peace. I left some clothes at the register and we ran out of there with out the purchases we wanted to make, we couldn't deal with the awkward and annoying behavior any longer. \n\n(I'm serious, while I'm pulling the door shut she is like \"so where you guys from!?\")\n\nNow all of these questions might seems harmless and I get that some sales folks are generally trying to build a rapport, I have worked in retail and restaurant service in the past...I get it. Whatever Lucky Brand has come up with in these new changes is almost as though they are reading from a script with the line of questioning as it is identical at several locations. Your staff needs to be able to identify when people aren't interested in playing along. I am here to buy clothes, not for a speed dating event with your staff. People skills are not something you can really teach but social cues should be obvious when guests are bordering on anger trying to get away from being pestered by staff in a small shop. \n\nI hope this review finds its way to a senior staff member because I love the merchandise but we hate the idea of returning because of a recurring problem.", "business_id": "RIPOZpFE32uPP1JEQQPTCg", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-09-03", "type": "review"}

The total came to $70 for all ten items and included two seaters that needed significant de-pilling and one that needed an alternation.\n\nI believe I spoke with Geralyn when I first came in on Tuesday. I told her I was new to their place but had heard great things. She took the time to go through each item and let me know which service -- Diamond or Silver -- would be best. I thought for sure she would say \"oh Diamond for everything\" to make more money. Nope. She even said that some items don't need Diamond especially since the designer tag will increase the price 20%-50%. I appreciated her honesty: she seems to care about the quality of the work over the price, meaning if she thinks the item will fantastic with the cheaper option she won't recommend the Diamond to you. \n\nAll of the clothes look BRAND NEW. I am amazed at not only the friendly service and attention to detail paid to each item when I dropped off my clothes, but the quality of work here is fantastic. My sweaters look as if I just bought them a month ago. I could literally see the difference just by looking at the clothes through the bag. My boyfriend tried on his polos and said he noticed a difference.\n\nI also love their automated valet system. It is only available for Diamond and Silver level items but I was able to pick-up my stuff after dinner last night to wear this weekend without have to make a separate trip like I usually have to with other dry cleaners.\n\nYes, this place is more expensive but I didn't find their pricing exorbitant. A Hugo Boss dress shirt with the Diamond level was $4. A Burberry tie with a stain was $7. You might pay $3+ more an item but the quality is so worth it, especially if you have designer labels. Those pieces are an investment so when you use a great dry cleaners your clothes will last longer and look great for months. If I had known the work here was so amazing -- and not been scared away by all these reviews of insane pricing -- I would have come here a long time ago.

Just writing an honest review on my experience there recently.\n\n1) Overall/ Intro\n2) Sales reps\n3) Selection process\n4) Price negotiation\n5) Conclusion\n\n1) The staff was very comforting and professional. I've never been shopping for engagement rings before and the people there made it great. I knew exactly what I wanted going in, my girlfriend had sent me a bunch of creations off their website (which is an awesome resource) and I picked out the few that I liked.  It certainly helps to know the color differences (D, E, F, etc.), cuts (cushion, princess, emerald...) and clarity( VVSI, VSI, IF, etc.) before going in. That's just my personal preference. Whenever I'm buying something that's costing me twice as much as I paid for my car (which is a good ol reliable civic), I like to do my homework. But the staff is very knowledgeable about EVERYTHING jewelry. The big pluses of Shane Co for me personally include:\n-lifetime guarantee on products: pretty much fix anything you buy from them, for life. Except if it gets lost or stolen\n-60 day refund or exchange after purchase\n-6 month interest free loan to pay off whatever you buy. amount depends on cred score.\n\n2) These guys have to be trained on being low pressure. Because they let you browse around however long you want. And I must have been asked by 3 employees how I was going to propose to my gf.\n\n3) First we picked out a setting, then we went to stone. They run you through spiels about where diamonds come from, even bring out 3 mystery stone related to what you're looking for and let you guess the 4 C's. Kinda of fun. Let's you see what's important to you. After I picked out the stone, that was it. I made a down payment before leaving, got my cool IGI certificate for the diamond and then picked up the ring 2 days later.\n\n4)A big question I had before going in that I couldn't find the answer to on the internet was\"Can you negotiate prices?\" And the answer is YES. The Shane Co rep gave this away when she asked me after I first walked in \"What out-the-door price were you looking at today?\" After she wrote the amounts for the stone, setting, and tax on a little notepad I made an offer below the price. She walked away and got it cleared by her boss. I only bid about 5% off the price and was kind of wishing I had bid lower. But bottom line: Don't pay the tag price! \n\n5) Overall, I'm pleased with my purchase and comforted by the fact that if something were to happen to the ring I can always take it into any Shane Co location and know it's getting quality repairs for FREE.", "business_id": "BUsmaloKEZeOvXLrSjKWSQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-11-14", "type": "review"}

They don't get judge mental or condescending as most people would get. Every person who walked in was treated with just as much respect. A nice lady even helped me work the free super cool coffee machine they have going and made me a pretty nice drink. They let me review the center diamond to verify it's microscopic imperfections inside (just a tiny, almost non existent cloud) so I could know this is how mine looks like and it will be the same once I get it back. Pretty sure to prevent people from switching out diamonds. They said it was going to take 4 days to so they could get the white gold back to its original shine, we went for it, I mean why not? its free. We come back and I reviewed it for that special little mark and sure enough it was mine.

I thought of her today while visiting Shane Co. in Scottsdale. With the holidays almost here a peek was necessary. Walking in I felt a tiny bit like Marilyn. \n\nSpecial. \n\nAnd I was wearing pink lipstick.* \n\nThe warmest voice greeted me and treated me like royalty. There to peruse items with perhaps less bling then Marilyn I was surprised by the variety of options. Financing is available (thru Wells Fargo) and layaway (!) for up to one year. Mr. Shane will hold special items for up to one year, no restocking fee, no interest, fully refundable, provided payments are in good standing.\n\nUseful information. \n(There is no excuse not to buy a nice engagement ring.)\n\nBut *not* why I was there.\nAfter lingering over engravable necklaces I passed the Service Department. All work is done in the open. (Technically, behind high security plastic/glass. But you can see!) The space is nicely designed with a designated viewing area that has direct sunlight.\n \nPurchases at Shane Co. are worry free. Should [gasp] a stone fall out from normal wear and tear the store stands behind the sale. Any engraving work has the same promise. Should letters/numbers buff or polish off Mr. Shane will replace the item free.\n\nUseful information.\nItems are not mass produced. A purchase from this store is current on style. You aren't likely to run into someone else with the same item.\n\nUseful Information.\nThere is a 60 day return policy. Yup. The store is high on sharing education. I'm not in the market for a diamond. But the staff was eager to share the characteristics of a diamond.  (And Rubies. And Sapphires. And Pearls!)\n\nJust for fun - and channeling Marilyn - I asked to try on jaw dropping diamonds. My wrist will never be the same. It has felt the weight of a 10 ct. 20K tennis bracelet. (My heart was already a puddle from one hundred and sixty-nine graduated diamonds around my neck. By all means, I'd like it very much. On my wish list for a mere $16,750. Free shipping!)\n\nThanks Chris P! I very much enjoyed shopping with you!\n*Marilyn wears a pink dress while singing that song.

She was patient and knowledgeable and answered all the questions we had. \n\nLater, she turned things over to Sarah who really made us know we were shopping at the right place. She knew that at the age of 21 I was a little young to commit to anything that day but spent time out of her day to educate us on the diamonds and what makes each one unique all while not making us feel pressured or uncomfortable. \n\nAt the end she went over all the pricing options so I left with all the information I needed for later on down the road. Before leaving, Sarah took notes of the size, style and stone we picked out so when we are ready we won't forget (which is good for all you guys out there). I know that is what they are paid to do but they do an excellent job, which made me want to come back when I'm ready to pop the question.\n\nOverall, the girls that helped us out ended up making our day by giving us a fun, informative and stress free experience.", "business_id": "BUsmaloKEZeOvXLrSjKWSQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-09-23", "type": "review"}

Maybe thats why I have such an issue. I cant speak much for the sales part, my husband did all of that. He had a decent experience, the sales people were kind, helpful, no pressure, educational and that whole bit. But, I'm starting to think this place is some huge kind of rip off. My band is nice, nothing crazy, fairly expensive (for what it is) and its basically a piece of crap. Its all pave stones, and a halo of them around the diamond. When you're buying the ring they don't bother to inform you that you're going to be driving out there constantly for the rest of your life getting them replaced. I AM NOT KIDDING, the pave stones CONSTANTLY FALL OUT. I've had thins ring for probably 2.5 years and have had to come in.... I can't even tell you how many times because the stones fall out. After driving out there to turn it in, you have to go back about three days later to pick it up.... Annoying. Every time I talk to someone about this all they tell me is I can \"upgrade\" my band... ok, so spend more money because your band you sold is a joke? What kind of crap is that? Yes, its free to have replaced, but what kind of quality is this for the money you're spending? Is this how Shane Co. gets you to spend more money? They offered to \"retip\" my prongs to hold the stones in, so now my ring doesn't sparkle because it has gobs of white gold covering the already tiny stones. Oh, another thing, when they replace my missing stones, they put in a bunch of junk grey/black stones and then try to tell me its \"polish\" under them.... Lastly, this last time, i took my ring in a few months ago for the inspection, and because my wedding band was missing a stone (same type of ring, same story) and they kept all 3 of my rings to replate and clean... They fixed the band with the missing stone, and gave me back the rings, only to have the wedding ring now missing a stone... Great inspection. So, I take it back, they tell me again come back 3 days at 4, great. I go there at 4, wait because its \"not ready\" until 4:15, then they come back and tell me its going to be another 15 minutes and want me to keep waiting. Its absolute BS and I would NOT buy another piece of junk from Shane Co. or recommend it to my friends anymore, either.\n\nUpdate. Despite being told they would reach out via email, Shane Co has not, pretty sure that's just their standard rebuttal. I inquired I store on their upgrade policy. To upgrade your band, you have to spend DOUBLE your original price. Insane.", "business_id": "BUsmaloKEZeOvXLrSjKWSQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-11-16", "type": "review"}

The service was terrific, the food was above-par for a typical bar, the prices were fairly reasonable although a tad bit upscale and there was a vast amount of seating that would allow you to watch virtually any game in comfort.\n\nNow other than the seating, pretty much everything else has changed.   The last two times I've been here the service was lousy, downright apathetic, there seemed to be no shortage of servers and wait-staff in the place but they seemingly vanished at times without a trace.    \n\n\nNow the worst part.     The menu was overhauled almost entirely.  Previously it was filled with good stuff, at reasonable prices.    What they've managed to do at Fox Sports Grill in terms of an amazingly epic  transformation is to completely destroy the menu, drop the quality of the food tremendously and yet somehow RAISE the prices.\n\nNow you're stuck with overpriced, dry and unappetizing sliders, food that tastes of dirty oil and more.       Their pizzas in the past were fantastic, the crap they're serving up nowadays reminds me more of generic frozen-food aisle grocery store pizza(not even Digiorno).     So the food tastes awful, but they've had the audacity to raises the prices.\n\nNow you're sitting there, paying way above-par prices for sub-par food.   WTF man?      This place used to be fantastic but evidently some genius decided that they could make more profit by offering crappier quality at higher prices.      I'm not buying it.      There's too much competition, too many other options for this sort of nonsense.         \n\n  I can head to Zipps down the road, The Arena(yeah, its standard bar food but it won't cost an arm and leg) or best of all, Casey Jones Grill where I can pay less and somehow get much better food and service.\n\n\nBottomline, this place has jumped the shark completely.    Whatever they had going right for them is pretty much gone.

At least one of them is there at all times.

She always remembers what I want...even down to asking if I'm going to get \"regular mayo or chipotle mayo this time\". I love it. It makes me feel like she really cares about her customers. I love that she wraps my foot long as 2-6 inch sandwiches. This makes it easy for me to eat half right away and save the other half for later if I wish. Prasad...well...I think maybe it's a cultural thing about women that causes him to come across as kind of unfriendly to me. My ex bf and I used to go in a lot and those two men got along famously...but I see a completely different side of  Prasad if I go in now on my own. He makes my sandwich well enough, but he doesn't really speak to me and it's slightly uncomfortable.

Maybe other menu items taste better, but for the price I paid I am not likely to return in hopes I get something that tastes good.", "business_id": "aI_RzGMU35cFL1St2HgPkw", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-10-30", "type": "review"}

I decided to use some points for a trip to Phoenix and stay there in a one bedroom for three nights. We wanted a king bed and got one of the last one bedrooms available. The room was a recently renovated room. The first thing you will notice here is that the parking and the rooms are FAAAARRRR apart. It is about a hundred yards from the parking lot to the 800 building. This made for a long walk with all the luggage. There really isn't a place to pull up close and unload either. The bell staff did offer us a ride if we needed it. But, being the young athletic folks that we are, we opted to walk... but found an alternative for the other times when we needed to park and get to the room. \n\nTHe room was gorgeous. The windows are double pane with mini blinds inside of them. Granite countertop. Nice colors. Its clean and very beautiful. The tub is a jacuzzi tub for two and the shower is big. The shower fixtures seem outdated and the hot water is difficult to regulate. THe mattress is a tempupedic type and very comfortable. there are flat screen tvs in the main room and the bedroom. \n\nI really liked the place and felt it was very nicely done. The staff is very nice and helpful. We did not use any of the ammenities of the resort, but were able to see the golf course. It was clean, well maintained and very nice.

We were attracted to this hotel because if its large in-room jacuzzi tub.\n\nAs we were checking in, the lobby of this hotel is small (more like a \"room\" rather). Staff were chatting among themselves when we arrived around 1pm. It did not seem very professional to me. As I was in the lobby, I learned that this is actually a timeshare of the Shell vacation club. No wonder the the rooms are big with kitchenette (no stove, just sink, fridge, and microwave), dining table, and a large sectional sofa.\n\nI was given a room close to the parking lot, on the second/upper floor. The room decor was decent. Not brand new, but \"okay\". As I mentioned before, the whole reason we booked this hotel is because of its in-room jacuzzi tub. So as I was enjoying the tub at like 5pm, someone kept calling and calling the hotel room. We didn't answer as we were in the tub, and we did not expect any call to the room. Then someone even BANG on our door. My husband answered the door, who claimed to be 2 security personnel. They said downstairs ceiling was leaking water and wanted to inspect our room to see if \"everything is okay', and if \"anyone is injured\". They inspected the room, the patio, and wanted to inspect the bathroom as well. However, I was in the tub and my husband asked if they can you come back in 2 hours (around 7:30pm) for the inspection. They agreed.  Then later in the evening, th towel bar fell down. So we called the front desk about the shower bar (and asked to have someone to come fix it), and we also asked if the security guards were still coming, since it was already 8pm or so. The person who answered the phone said \"we were just waiting upon your permission for us to get in.\" We were like, \"ok, you can come in now\", but I thought we had a prior arrangement for them to \"arrive in 2 hours\"? Why the person was so rude and made it like we did not allow them to come in? Then soon after, a guy came in to fix the towel bar, who said that someone already figured out that the downstairs leakage is due to the plumbing issue, and not related to us.  So they did not need to come in to inspect the tub.  We were relieved and continue our vacation.\n\nThen the second night of our stay, we were enjoying the hot tub at around 11pm. Again, someone kept calling our phone in the room, and we answered. The lady, Josie, in the phone said, \"you have to move NOW\" and did not give us any other option. So after we packed up everything, we called Josie again to clarify the situation. She said people staying downstairs said WE were told not to use the tub. HUH? nobody ever told us not to use the tub? They even came to inspect and found out problems were not in our room? Then Josie said the \"downstairs people refused to move\", but so are we, at 11:30pm? they EVICT a hotel guest at 11:30pm at night given we did not anything wrong? We did not flood the place, we did not bang holes on the wall... and she said, the ceiling of the downstairs is falling off, and if we do not move, and BASED IN ARIZONA LAW, if we notify the hotel guests that there maybe danger in the room and the hotel guests do not comply, they will not be responsible for any accident or damage. After the threats, she offered that we could continue to stay in the room, but someone would have to come up to inspect the tub the next day and we could not use the tub. I really do not understand - when there is a plumbing issue with the drain, why someone keeps need to inspect the room? Most important is, we gave them the chance to inspect the room the night before - but they CHOSE not to come to inspect it.\n\nSince we already packed up everything, we decided to move to the room in the next building anyway at 11:30pm.\n\nWhen comparing the 2 rooms, I found out there are quite some decor difference in the bathroom tiles and decor, and even the microwave is different for the 2 rooms... sofa was a bit older, but still ok.\n\nSo the last day of our vacation, we were able to use the tub without disturbance. The hotel manager kept wanting to talk to us, but I do not think there is anything he could do that could make us feel better. He charged us 1 night less for the room - but that's not what I was looking for anyway.\n\nThis is such a horrible experience that I would NEVER ever recommend anyone to stay at this hotel. If the hotel is has such a serious plumbing issue, then they shouldn't make hot tubs inside the room (if their drain cannot handle it).\n\nI felt being prejudice against - either by age or by race (we are Asian).\n\nStay at a real hotel, don't stay in this type of timeshare with poor staff training and poor service.", "business_id": "40B5TbtZbiGV4blFR9S6Dw", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-09-21", "type": "review"}

There were flat screens in the living room and bedroom, and a full sized fridge to store our leftovers and drinks. The pool area was really nice, with a pool bar. We had a spacious patio that overlooked the golf course. Also, the staff were soooo nice! It felt like everyone went out of their way to make us feel special. It felt like home towards the end of our stay! :)\n\nCons: There were only 2: We stayed in building 6, which was a pretty far walk from the parking lot. If this is a problem for you, I'd recommend staying in buildings 1-4. (But we were close to the pool). Also, the doors to the bedroom weren't solid doors, but those kind with the slots in them. It provided privacy, but when my husband stayed up later than I did one night when his buddies came over, I could hear everything as if I were still sitting on the couch hanging out with them. (I wound up just getting up and rejoining the conversation, cuz it felt like I was eavesdropping lol) So, if noise privacy is an issue for you between the bedroom and living room, I'd keep that in mind!\n\nOverall, since parking and the non-doors on the bedroom were the only problems, I would recommend this place to everyone and everyone!!

The hotel and surrounding streets were not very well lit so finding the main entrance and check in area was a little tricky. Once we did find the check in area, the doors were locked but all you had to do was ring a call button and someone came out to greet us. The lady working the check in was as nice and bubbly and very informative at giving us information about the hotel. I know you must be thinking that this is what they are paid to do but I was not expecting that at 3:30am. The person checking us in did let us know that parking would probably be hard to find that hour but she did direct us to the closest parking lot to our rooms and told us in which area we were more likely to find parking and sure enough, right where she told us to go is where I found a couple of empty spots in an otherwise packed lot. \n\nThe hotel room itself was your pretty standard hotel room, living room/dining area with a full sized fridge and microwave, dishes and utensils. The bedroom was in a separate detached area to the living room with a very small TV mounted in the corner of the room. Each room also came with its own private balcony with patio furniture but the bathroom area was where I was most impressed. Each room came with its own jacuzzi tub, his and hers bathroom sinks, a small closet area with bath robes, the toilet area and a stand up shower. The shower head is a little short for a person who is six feet tall like me but it wasn't that much of a problem. Every day that I came back to the room, it looked as good as the day I checked in, the room was spotless and any dishes or anything else that was used during the previous days was always replaced. Again, you may say that this is a standard procedure at any hotel but I have stayed at some hotels that will not replace soap bars or shampoos if you still have some from the previous days. \n\n\nOverall, I have to say that the Orange Tree is one of the best places I have stayed at so far and I would definitely book here again.", "business_id": "40B5TbtZbiGV4blFR9S6Dw", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-09-19", "type": "review"}

He of course made a volcano - but oddly no fire was lit (maybe safety regulations) all in all he was very entertaining.

I asked the server if I could have some Shrimp sauce (yummy yummy sauce). He said they did not have any- it isn't out in this region. He told me it was more Midwestern and southern. I don't think Arizonians know what they are missing. The sauce MAKES fried rice taste even better than it already is. I don't get why any hibachi restaurant doesn't have it out here.

He was incredible, engaging, and just so much fun.\n\nNow for the 4 star review, our server was horrible. I went out to eat with 7 members of my family (8 total) and received a female server that I can't even remember the name of (did she ever even mention it??). She was hardly attentive, my girlfriend waited up to 15 for a refill on water, ended up getting up and grabbing the pitcher to get it herself. Then when Hiro started making our food he had to run and get the rice bowls (while our rice was cooking might I say) because our server forgot them. Needless to say Hiro was a little embarrassed, but we encouraged him we were fine. Hiro did an absolutely amazing job with our table and we all loved him. We were cracking up at his jokes and in awe with his tricks. He absolutely made our trip and I'm very grateful we had a chef of his caliber at the table.  When our server came back we asked her if we had to tip Hiro personally (because honestly we felt he deserved more of our tip than she did), and she told us no. We understood and jokingly said we wanted to give him money, and she responded with \"No, he doesn't need it.\" She then proceeded to tell us the chefs salary and they \"usually make between $100-200 a night from the servers, we need it more than they do.\" This caught all of us off guard as none of us needed to be told that information, and it felt incredibly rude to respond in that way.\n\nAll in all the experience was great, I'd rather of had Hiro as our server AND chef though!

I would give it about a 2.5 based on the quality of food, portion size, & cost. I ordered the greek salad with falafal ($10) and my boyfriend ordered a gyro lunch special ($10). The falafal balls were simply not good. They were dry & dense and lacked the crispy on the outside/soft on the inside freshness of good falafal balls. The salad itself was really small - I expect a larger portion size for a $10 salad. I will say the feta on top of the salad was quite good but there were only 3 small slices. My boyfriend thought his gyro was average and that the greek place down the street (taste of greek) made a better one. The french fries were good, but that is not so hard to do. All the seating is indoors which really is a shame in a place with good weather.

We went during an off time, so there was no wait and no issues with seating. We did notice them try to seat a single woman at what must be the worst table in the restaurant, odd given that half the tables were empty, forcing her to request a different table. \n\nThey promptly served us a carafe of ice water and an insulated pitcher of coffee. Unfortunately, the coffee was barely warm. A consequence of dining at an off time, I suppose. They replaced it quickly. The Spanish omelet we ordered was solid. The pecan pancake, a single thick pancake that covers an entire plate, pecans baked in and not just sprinkled on, was very tasty and filling. It was served upside down, however, with the nice side of the pancake facing down on the plate and the crispy less than nice side facing up. No impact on the taste, of course, but a basic presentation issue that a better breakfast spot would not allow. I must say I feel like one of those overly picky Yelp reviewers making this observation. Still, we all have our pet peeves.\n\nMy favorite thing about the restaurant is how they greet young diners at the table. Show up with your little ones and they will immediately offer you a small serving of dry Cheerios and fruit. Such a great idea! It's surprising that more restaurants don't do this. It gives parents peace to fully examine the menu, enjoy some coffee and then order. Works a lot better than just crayons.\n\nA used, sticky, pitcher of syrup was our only true complaint. But I don't mind a little stickiness, I guess, if the alternative is having to beg for mini cups of syrup like you have to at some other pancakes spots.\n\nWe used a coupon sold to us by students from a local high school. Thank you The Good Egg for supporting them and for making our meal more affordable. We'll definitely give you another try to consider adding another star.\n\n09/20/2014 UPDATE: I've been fantasizing about that pecan pancake since my last visit, so we decided to give The Good Egg another try, this time visiting late on a Saturday morning. The coffee was piping hot when served this time around, a great improvement. The server did not offer and seemed confused when we requested Cheerios for the kids before the meal. Do they not always do that here like other locations? I'm confused now too. \n\nMy pecan pancake was served upside down (bad side up) again. I know I'm being anal, but it makes for such a bad presentation. A much bigger problem this time. The pancake was not cooked through. I was treated to a mouthful of raw batter. The server observed me peeling back the middle of the cake to expose more raw batter and, to his credit, quickly replaced the pancake. \n\nAnother problem with our order. A request for no sour cream on an omelet was not honored. We scraped it off, but it had contacted the omelet and spoiled the meal for our family's sour cream phobic diner. The kids enjoyed their Minnie Mouse pancake and the Triple Play. They shared and it allowed each to have pancake, bacon, eggs and fresh fruit. Neither, uncharacteristically, drank their milk. Don't know if it was the temperature or the taste. \n\nReturned fully expecting to raise The Good Egg's rating to four stars.

My expectations were the food would follow the presentation standards. I ordered the Sunrise Benedict. My server came over to apologize for the delay that I hadn't noticed.  After all, I just thought the food might take some time. When the food arrived it was a good presentation. I say good because there was an avocado peel still on the plate, ok, mistakes happen. The hollandaise was hardly there, another detail I can get over. The poached egg had fallen off, okay again not a big deal. I notice small details, but I try not to let them get the best of this breakfast that I'm about to enjoy. Then I cut in, and this is where my review takes a turn south... The yolk was great, but the white were still runny. This is a huge part of the reason I prefer poached eggs. The white is fully cooked without the slimy texture, yet the yellow is flowing. Also, everything was cold. How is it possible to have a [I assume] freshly poached egg, and be stone cold? The tomatoes were not ripe, and the brown core was in the tomato. The English muffin was soggy and wouldn't hold together, so I ended up just push it to the side. The potatoes were okay, completely crisped on one side and no crisp on the other. \n\nI understand mistakes happen, but I will definitely not be back to visit The Good Egg.

We have noticed and always wondered what it was about. Tiny little place with a pretty \"hole in the wall\" look. Small parking lot and always open late. So, at 9pm on a Monday night with likely limited choices on where to go out to eat, we decided to venture in. \n\nThe place has a pretty unusual setup. The chinese food part is on the right in what looks like a little take out store front. The middle is more open with tables and a raised covering, dart boards and open ends to the air. On the left, the bar in its own little enclosed area. Piped music, sounding almost live, througout. Lots of folks drinking, eating and having a good time playing darts. Loud 70s and 80s rock with a very rare hip hop song interjected. \n\nWe picked up a couple menus and sat. Our server came out quickly and got our order. We chose apple pork and dan dan noodles (spicy). Our food came very quickly in take out boxes (perfect for the left overs to go home with us). \n\nThe dan dan noodles were definitely spicy! SG thought them just a bit too spicy, medium would have been better if it had been an option. I personally thought they were good, but really prefer a wide noodle dish over the thin noodles. The apple pork is much like sweet and sour pork. The pork, great white chunks with no fatty bad pieces at all, breaded and deep fried. It was in a sweet sauce that had a very distinct apple flavor. It was delicious!!!  \n\nI would gladly try any of their unique dishes like the apple pork, beef or chicken again. It was a breath of fresh air to have a chinese place like this with so many choices that I had not seen before. Places all seem to have the same menu and this one sets itself apart, but in menu and setup of the restaurant. \n\nDEFINITELY venture on in and check it out.

I'm in early at work, and in the mood for Chinese...I remember that dinky hole in the wall I passed by on a daily basis with the giant star in front and  the remotely Chinese name. I go in, and turn right...but not before noticing that on my left is a long fully stocked bar with some crazy Rock paraphanalia hanging on the walls...a few picnic tables in between the left side and the right. Greeted by a young-ish rocker guy, who introduces himself as Jamie, who I believe is also the owner. Hell of a nice guy. I take a quick look at their take out menu...which is a very impressive selection, and pretty comprehensive collection of most fast food chinese fair and then some. I get a few standards, won ton soup, and mongolian beef. Prices are very good. I take it with me....unwrap, and enjoy...The wonton soup is surprisingly dark and stuffed to the brim with veggies. This was personally a turn off, as I normally order won ton soup for the broth, dumplings and maybe some bbq pork bits....not a garden salad. Definitely edible though, so i scarf it down and move on to the mongolian beef, which i found to be good (great portions as well) if maybe a little rich...covered in what seems to be a good thick brown goop...harkening of potential hours in the lavatory come midnight, but still definitely edible. I take a longer look at the menu...and finally \"get it\". One of their feature dishes is called the \"Wok-Star\"...and the theme dawns on marble head.... I love it...The Punk Rock collides with Chinese take out thing warms itself to me...and I remember the bar and the owner and how chill the whole thing seemed.\n      So, why only three stars do you ask?\n\nA few weeks later, I call in a delivery for my second shot with Chop-n-wok. A Garlic Shrimp dish....and quickly get a sense of deja-vu. The very same  thick brown goop that came with the mongolian beef seemed to find its way into this dish as well....\n\na week or so after that, I call for thirds...im in the mood for lighter (make me feel healthy) food....I decide to opt for chicken and brocolli as I know that's usually fairly light fair. Open it up and...yes you guessed it, smeared in the very same thick brown goop.\n\nJamie told me when I had first gone in, that the Chef, though of Mexican? nationality, didnt seem it, that he had cooked in China for a length of time....I loved so much about Chop-N-Wok in regards to the style and attitude of this place...I really wish the  guy had learned more than one sauce recipe while he was over there.\n\nAh, well...the bar still most definitely calls to me....and I hope to make it in at some time...I have a feeling that that experience will win over that next star....but unfortunately...for now...its gonna have to be about the food....and all I can say is thick brown goop.", "business_id": "iZR96moKSAWYROyL5-qeuQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-09-08", "type": "review"}

I am pleased to report that while staff members are quick to welcome guests and offer assistance, they know to leave you alone if you \"just want to look.\"  The reps I'd met yesterday and on the first visit knew much about their products, and even if they didn't, I had the feeling they'd go to great lengths to find out.  I can't say the same about my second visit, unfortunately, but it was late in the day, fifteen minutes to closing time as a matter of fact, so I didn't mind, since I knew that all of the info I sought was online.  On the other hand, if I wasn't lucky to have internet access and/or reside nearby, I don't know if I'd have cared to return again had I not purchased a Groupon, especially after noting that the rep wasn't inspired enough to look for the info either from printed or online databases, irregardless of the time of day.  I found Ashley to be very helpful during today's visit.\n\nI really like that MOST of the products sold here are parabens-free and MOST of the cleansing products are sulfates-free.  I find that I am not able to sample many of the products offered here due to food allergies**, but it's refreshing to find more and more businesses that strive to offer products using natural ingredients- sometimes even organic!  Not only does Lather strive to help people who are looking for natural alternatives in facial, body, hair, and aromatherapy products, but it also gives back to the environment (by packaging their products in containers made from recycled materials, by offering 10% off purchases to customers returning Lather recyclables, and by purchasing carbon off-sets) and to charities by partnering with and contributing to the following three organizations: Carbonfund.org, Cleantheworld.org, and Headaches.org.  To find out more about Lather's mission, history, and the products offered (and their ingredients), check out www.lather.com.  BTW, do you know that Lather only has three locations in the U.S. (CA, GA, and AZ), and that its products can be found in upscale hotels, such as Las Vegas' Borgata and Wynn, and Canyon Ranch?  Granted, I've never been to any of these hotels, but I know of their reputation, so I'm impressed to hear and read that these hotels endorse Lather products.\n\nI like the slatted wood soap dish I found here, as it prevents water puddles from forming, thereby extending the life of my exfoliating lavender soap.  If you use delicate glycerine- and olive oil-based soaps, you may find this dish a nice investment, as well.  I hope to update my review in a few months' time (maybe sooner) to write about my experiences with the products I'd bought today, specifically the Vitamin C Peptide Renewal and the Shine Control Face Lotion.\n\n**I realized many years ago that those skin rashes and breakouts I'd get from time-to-time were allergic reactions to specific natural ingredients, such as carrot, avocado, corn, rice, and any orange variety, be it orange, bergamot, tangerine, neroli, and so on, to name a few.

OH MY. \n\nI believe you have put yourself in, if nt above the entire class of Sushi in the desert. Sushi and fresh seafood seem to have some challenges when you're hundreds of miles from the water. But Sushi on Shea sees that as NO EXCUSE. If you read on their website they make some great statements on how sushi should be etc... They MEET and EXCEED all expectations I had.\n\nSo let's get to the review. I've been to many Sushi places in the Scottsdale/PHX area but never had any with ingredients THIS fresh. Even eating Sushi in the NW of the country in Seattle and Portland few have had as fresh an ingredients and I'm a very tough critic. \n\nI actually went today for the first time(on my birthday) with my roommate for lunch. What a treat. We got the deep fried scallop roll, sweet potato roll, vegetable roll, eel&cucumber roll and california roll. We also got shrimp and vegetable tempura. As well as a small bowl of Miso.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\nMiso-AMAZING and flavorful.\nCalifornia Roll-SO FRESH. My roommate said it was the best California roll she ever had.\nTempura-Vegetables were FRESH. Shrimp was as succulent and juicy as a shrimp could be.\nSweet Potato Roll- Very unique never heard of or had one, very good.\nVegetable Roll-The prettiest looking vegetable roll filled with ingredients. And again FRESH(catching a theme here?) LOL\n\nAnyway, bottomline is that if you are new in town, been scarred by horrible \"desert sushi\", are a first timer when it comes to sushi or just need a new place to try of QUALITY. Go, you won't be disappointed. Og yes, and as other reviewers have said the surroundings in the restaurant are very nice, big fish tanks, chill music, AMAZING service.\n\nKeep Yelipin Peoples!", "business_id": "Y2Lfzulh_D9nNcuH49UT4w", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-09-11", "type": "review"}

We walked in early in the evening, and the place was virtually empty.\n\nSitting at the bar, we started with the miso soup with clams.  This was actually superior to the same dish at Yasu; the soup was less briny, and the clams were a little more plump and flavorful.  I knew at that point that this would probably be a good meal.\n\nThe first items we ate were the live jumbo clam and the kai snapper sushi from the specials menu.  Let me tell you - the clam was one of the freshest, most delectable seafood items I've ever eaten.  The owner recommended we eat it straight, without soy sauce - its flavor is so delicate and so perfect that you don't need to soil it with something else.  The kai snapper was also tasty; it was seared, with a bit of skin to give it a strong, unique flavor that you don't normally get from nigiri.\n\nAfter the clam, we were served a half dozen oysters, which were topped with ponzu sauce (made in-house).  The oysters were good, but I felt like the sauce was a bit too overpowering.  I'd have cut the sauce in half.  Usually when I eat oysters, I only lightly drizzle them with mignonette, because I love the flavor of those scrumptious little bivalves.\n\nNext, we had the yellowtail collar off the specials menu (I forgot what it's called, but the owner explained that it is prepared with garlic and ginger, and that her restaurant is the only place you can get it prepared that way).  It was absolutely delicious.  I'm not normally a fan of cooked fish, but this was probably the best cooked fish I have ever tasted.  It was fall-off-the-bone tender, rich in flavor, and the Japanese eggplant soaking in the soup was just delicious (and I don't even like eggplant).\n\nWhile showing off her fresh uni (not as fresh as the just-killed-it-and-scooped-it-out uni I've had in California and Portland, but still fresh), she suggested trying it with squid and quail egg.  So we did, and it was delicious.  (As a side note, she did say that she gets live sea urchin from time to time; she had been expecting it to arrive with the live clam, but it didn't.  If you time it right, you might be able to get live sea urchin here.)\n\nAfter the uni, squid, and quail egg sushi, we had our main sushi and sashimi platter.  We went with king salmon sushi, aji sushi, and blue fin toro sashimi (all from the specials menu).  Yes, king salmon tastes different, and better, than your run-of-the-mill salmon.  And blue fin toro tastes different, and stronger, than normal tuna.\n\nAt this point, we decided we were not quite finished.  We ordered the tuna carpaccio and the yellowtail citrus roll (which was on the specials menu).  The carpaccio was my friend's favorite item; it is tuna topped with creamy horseradish mayo and wasabi and black tobaiko.  I'm not sure exactly what was in the yellowtail citrus roll, but it had yellowtail on the outside, and something cooked and flavored with a chipotle seasoning on the inside.  It was spicy with a hint of citrus.\n\nMy verdict on this place is that it is an extremely good sushi bar, with plenty of interesting cuts of fish that you don't see at the generic places outside of Scottsdale.  It is also not trendy sushi, and everything is nice and fresh.  Sushi On Shea has to be considered one of the best sushi bars in Phoenix; I'm not sure if I enjoyed the overall dining experience better than the excellent meal we had at Yasu, but this seems to be better place to get traditional sushi and less common fish.\n\nA final note: the owner said they do omakase meals.  I didn't inquire about the price, but I will most definitely be back eventually, just to see how they do with that.", "business_id": "Y2Lfzulh_D9nNcuH49UT4w", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-11-15", "type": "review"}

In fact, the amount was troubling and we feared the worst.   After contacting a couple of leak detection companies who were listed on this site and not receiving any assistance what-so-ever, we contacted an award wining high-end custom home builder for a possible lead.  They immediately gave us John's number at Underwater Operations who we contacted that evening.  After speaking with John regarding the details of the leak he said he would be out first thing tomorrow morning.  He arrived earlier than expected to our home (called ahead to let us know he was ahead of schedule) and had a great demeanor right from the start.  We showed him the pool and described what had been done to that point at which time he gave us the \"plan of attack.\"  After retreiving his tank and gear from his truck and returning pool side, I asked him what we were looking at in terms of cost for finding the leak?  He said there would not be a charge unless he found the leak and was able to fix it. Before I could get another word out he submerged with dye in had in search or the leak.  After about twenty-five minutes underwater he resurfaced with a perplexed look on his face and said \"Do you have a pool maintenance company?\"  I responded \"We did but we just let them go as the pool was not getting cleaned, filters were not being serviced and overall performance was poor. Why?\"  What he said next surprised me.  \"I found the leak and it looks like VANDALISM!\"  Suffice it to say I had to see this with my own eyes so I changed into my trunks, grabbed my mask and dove in meeting him at the bottom of the pool where he directed me to the leak and then demonstrated the dye  test and I watched the dye disappear into a hole in the leaf basket/strainer at the bottom of the pool.  I was shocked!  When we both resurfaced he explained the rarity of the leak and the reason for the diagnosis of vandalism.  It made perfect sense and given that the leak started shortly after we dismissed our pool maintenance company it seemed that much more reasonable... In any case, John said he had the materials to perform the repair underwater and that following the snapping of a couple of pictures and a short video (which he provided with the invoice) he would have us leak free in thirty minutes or so.  WOW!  I was impressed.  Following his repairs, we shut off all of the pool equipment and checked the water level making a note of its location, checked again twenty-four hours later and it was holding!  I called John to inform him of my findings, thanked him profusely for his service and demeanor and said I would definitely be referring him to family and friends...

Unfortunately, when I went to do some research on local cooking classes, most of them were way out of our budget.  That is, until I spoke to Marti at Sweet Basil.  \n\nMarti was extremely accommodating and I was pleasantly surprised to hear that the pricing for our group was reasonable compared to some of the other cooking schools that I was looking into.  There was a great selection of menus to choose from as well.  I went with the \"Easy Entertaining\" option, which included recipes for the following items:\n* Baked Brie with Shallots & Roasted Raspberry Chipotle Sauce\n* Smoked Salmon Cakes with Lemon Dill Aioli\n* Grilled chicken Satay with Ginger Mustard Sauce\n* Bloody Mary Shrimp\n* Pork Pot Stickers with Garlic Soy\n* Pepper-Crusted Steak with Horseradish cream\n* Mini Caramel Pecan Pies with Bourbon whipped Cream\n\nWhen the group arrived, there were aprons for all, and Marti introduced herself and Chef Linda prior to us beginning.  Our group was ready to get our hands dirty right away, but we did have to be patient as Chef Linda walked us through each recipe... From there, we buddied up (except for Emi H who bravely took on the Chicken Satay on her own) and were on our own with the large kitchen and ingredients.  Tiffany and I did the Brie which was by far the easiest, but we had fun with it and it turned out incredibly (if I can say so myself)!\n\nAll in all, this was a fabulous evening, and great for team building too... but if you do book Sweet Basil, a couple of things to keep in mind that may be helpful:\n*While SB does provide iced tea and water, they allow BYOB, so if your group is anything like mine, I do recommend taking advantage and bringing some wine!\n*You'll likely begin your class promptly at 6:30, but won't be digging into the food for quite some time, so you may want to grab a bite prior to arriving or ask about purchasing some snacks to nosh on while you eat.\n\nIn addition to the above, note that SB is also a fabulous store for all kinds of cookware, kitchen accessories, and more...

But now that I'm a \"grown-up\" I can honestly say that I can cook! It took major life changes and the possibility of starvation to do it, but through cookbooks and the internet, I can boldly say that I am able to cook anything as long as I've got a recipe! So when we went to the Sweet Basil cooking school for a work outing I was excited to put my cooking skills to the test.\n\nWe started off with Linda our instructor giving us an overview of what we were cooking and she had us volunteer to break off into pairs. She asked for one person to go solo and I raised my hand. Our menu for the evening was \"Easy Entertaining\" and were a mix of sweet and savory dishes. I had the task of making grilled chicken satay skewers. It took about 90 minutes for everyone to finish cooking and we ate the dishes as they were completed. Each recipe was easy to prepare and there were a handful I'd choose to make at home for parties. My skewers needed to be grilled and that's a skill I've never honed so it was nice to do something new! Our instructor Linda was very nice and she reminded me of the days when I used to cook with my grandmother. She was very encouraging and made me feel really great about my dish! I think in my next life I will go to culinary school and become a chef! Not so I can open a restaurant per se, but simply because I enjoy creating dishes and making folks happy through food!\n\nGreat team building exercise and a nice change from the regular sit down dinners.

But I can't ignore a few things that may or may not happen when you dine here.\n\nIt took a long time to get our starters, around forty minutes but timing went very well after that.\nWe both thought our starters were good. We had the Kale salad with grilled blood oranges and the Foie Gras raviolis in consomm\u00e9. It was a nice added step to brown the raviolis in butter.\n\nLike I already said the Jidori Chicken was on a level that blew me away. The chicken was so moist and flavorful. I'm not a skin eater but this skin was incredible. The chicken could not have been better. This dish was mostly chicken and garnished with some potato risotto sprinkled with English Peas and Fancy Carrots.\n\nThe grilled Scottish Salmon was prepared to perfection, slow cooked with a nice crust and really perfect between medium and medium rare but the fish was fishy tasting. NOT SPOILED but not fresh tasting. I have to remove a star for not fresh. The fish was passable but not enjoyable this way and is a reason that some people won't eat fish. The vegetable side dish that came with the salmon was somewhat disappointing because the broccoli had a strong broccoli taste.\n\nDesserts were a little disappointing as well. The souffl\u00e9 had great chocolate flavor but was over cooked and came out like cake. The beignets weren't really right because they lacked the lemon flavor I was expecting since they were suppose to be lemon ricotta and came out hollow and I can't say they had ricotta either.  I do note the side sauces for the beignets were excellent especially the blackberry coulis. I sort of liked it on the chocolate cake. For me desserts weren't worth the calories.\n\nI guess if everything goes well you can have a five star experience.

At first I was a little apprehensive, expecting a hoity toity atmosphere and snobby employees, but I am pleased to agree with other reviewers that that was simply not the case. \n\nIt was pretty quiet when we arrived around 8pm on a Tuesday, but we were warmly greeted by the hostesses and given a nice little \"date table\" on their patio. \n\nI started with a delicious glass of Sauvignon Blanc; my date had a Pinot Noir. Our server recommended the ahi tuna \"steak tartare\" appetizer which was absolutely yummy. I was a little sketched out to see it served with rye bread, but somehow all the flavors meshed very well together. \n\nAfter debating between the salmon and the scallops, I went with the latter. I am a huge sucker for scallops *wink wink nudge nudge to any prospective dates ;)* To be honest I'm not even sure what all the pretty sauces and garnishes on my plate were, but I liked it! I know the black sauce was squid ink, after being cautioned by our server that it has a distinct taste that you either like or you don't. I didn't find it to be offensive, and actually dipped one of my lightly breaded shrimp in it. The scallops themselves were very good. I cleaned my plate! (Is that bad first date manners? I couldn't help it!)\n\nMy date had the flat iron steak which came served with truffle fries. He's a Zinc \"regular\" and claims the steak is his favorite thing off the menu. I didn't try it, not a huge red meat eater. But I did steal a few fries which were tasty with their house made ketchup. \n\nIt was a very pleasant dining experience, unfortunately I didn't save room for dessert. Our server was there when we needed her and absent when we didn't. The busboy was prompt with water refills and removing dirty plates. Although Zinc has a heftier price tag than I'd probably pay for myself, I'd go again if asked on a second date!", "business_id": "GIGI8bJfN6HyPzmEW-QqjA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-10-31", "type": "review"}

Their fries - truffle parmesan and otherwise, with tasty unique dips - are addicting. The zinc burger, mac and cheese, hanger steak are all very good. I loved the haricot verts and shitakes and ate the whole plate myself. \n\nHowever, the best thing I've had here, which is in the top things I've ever eaten in my life I'm so enamored with it,... is the dungeness crab crepe.

Matchstick fries were good but we need to remember to tell them to hold the paprika. Several other excellent salads are on the list. Several sandwiches are there too. I enjoyed the omelette main course once, the bouillabaisse another time, the asparagus side several times, the Mac and cheese once, the oysters several times, and the mussels many times.

Might be slightly overpriced but for the ambience, location and being French I think it's to be expected. I'd recommend the Diver Scallops. \n\n\nLong Version: Came with my wife on date night before a movie starting at 9:30. It was Saturday night around 7:30 when we got there and got in right away with no wait. Service was great and our server was personable. We split the French Onion Soup which is good but a bit overrated if you come in with knowing the hype of it being on \"Best Thing I Ever Ate\". Also, at $14, it's overpriced. Moved on to the Flat Iron Steak (medium rare) with Truffle Fries which was cooked perfectly medium rare (people usually overcook it) and the fries were good and comparable to Zin Burger's fries if you've ever had those. Nearly identical really. Also had the Diver Scallops which were our favorite for the night. Perfectly seared and comes on top of a bed of Risotto, Roasted Corn and Crispy Shrimp. The Shrimp was a pleasant surprise but the three huge buttery seared Scallops were perfect. That was definitely the highlight of the dinner. Next time we might try the dinner for two which is $112, I believe, and comes with your choice of fries or salad, a prime run steak and their souffl\u00e9 which I'd definitely like to try next time.

Visited on September 6th and won't be back. From the second we arrived I could tell that wasn't going to happen. It was pouring rain and when we walked in the hostess had her back to us and was having casual conversation with another staff member. She made eye contact and kept right on talking. When she finally stopped talking to her friend she didn't even say may I help you just looked at us like we ruined her night. Told her we were meeting friends there and gave her the number of people and the name and she corrected me because I was off a number and said that \"party has already been seated\". Duh! that's why we said we were meeting people there. She walked us half way to the table and said they should be in the back on the right, which was wrong but we found them anyway since the place is so small but would it have killed her to walk us to our table. Our waiter was only half bad and just seemed overwhelmed which I won't fault him for because they did get busy but I only received one refill on my glass water after asking twice and the wait time for our food took longer than it should have for what we ordered. The food was just ok nothing to write home about. My husband ordered a simple salad and was the last one at the table to be served.  My salmon was cooked so oddly (over cooked in some spots undercooked in others) I only ate half. I usually will give a place two tries before writing them off because everyone can have an off night, but I was not impressed at all and won't be back", "business_id": "GIGI8bJfN6HyPzmEW-QqjA", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-09-07", "type": "review"}

If I could, I would even rate them higher.\n\nMy AZ restaurant week adventure took me and my wife to our second upscale restaurant in 3 days. Our taste buds took us to Zinc Bistro on a rainy Saturday night.\n\nFrom the outside, the bistro looked very ordinary. A simple restaurant sign, glass and wooden door, and some patio seating for the romantics. Nothing intimidating and nothing too fancy.\n\nInside the bistro, it was different. You are immediately transported from AZ to NY. The place turns from ordinary to exciting. The vibe becomes alive. Unlike other upscale restaurants, this one is upscale but not a stuck-up. In fact, this one is quite inviting. I felt like I can laugh around my friends while enjoying my wine and enjoy some stories while not rushing my meals.\n\nAmbience... CHECK!\n\nWe were greeted at the door, then the receptionist led us to our corner table. The usual. Nothing extra ordinary. Soon as we settled at our table and our server (Dylan) greeted us and gave us the menu, from there on, the service was quick, efficient and VERY attentive. I can't even remember when and who filled our glasses with water. I usually measure service by how attentive the staff is, if your glass of water is always full and ice cold, that means someone is always looking after your table. At Zinc, my glass was never empty. For me, that says a lot about their service. Our server (Dylan) was also at the top of his game. He made sure we our enjoying our food and also made sure we enjoy our experience by offering the best that they have. You always feel comfortable when servers approach your table with a smile. Service was simply EXCEPTIONAL...\n\nService... CHECK!\n\nEver had a meal that made you nod your head every time you take a bite? As if telling yourself that you made the right choice and you did a good job choosing the right meal. That's Zinc bistro food for you. You know you made right choice on every bite. We ordered the Smoked Duck Terrine and Pastrami Cured Salmon Burrata. The smoke duck terrine filled my mouth with all the texture you would look for. It had both a crunch and velvety bite from the terrine and pistachio. Also gave the salty flavor from the duck while balancing it out with the apricot and vinaigrette. You also get the freshness from the carrot and arugula as you mix all the component in one bite. The pastrami cured salmon on a burrata did not fall short as well. There perfect balance of texture with the burrata and salmon while you get the freshness from the roast beet and butter leaf salad. The appetizers alone made me nod on every bite. The main course was just CRAZY GOOD! The flat iron steak was perfectly cooked. The crust from the outside complimented the tender and juicy medium rare center. Make sure though that every slice you take has some caramelized shallot or else it might be too salty for your taste. The caramelized shallots balances the flavor to the sweet, salty and partly tangy perfect bite. My wife had the confit lamb shank. The lamb was so tender and the meat falls off the bone easily. It was perfectly complimented by the Beluga lentils, medjool dates, roasted turnips and crushed almonds. Again, the texture and flavor was well balanced. We also loved the slight touch of the crema fresca that cut through the gaminess of the lamb. If you hate lamb, this meal might just change your mind.\n\nLastly, the dessert. I alway want my dessert to be sweet but not overly sweet. I want it to make me feel like it satisfied my sweet tooth without making me like I ate a whole box of cake. We had the brown butter cookie w/ peanut butter nougat and salted caramel. It was a very sexy Snickers bar on a plate. When eaten w/ small bites of mint leaves, it takes the sexy snickers over the top. We also had the grilled pineapple tarte tatin w/ toasted tahini and cardamon ice cream. The cardamon ice cream cuts through the tanginess of the pineapple. Since the pineapple was grilled, the natural sweetness of the pineapple comes out. Oh and the chocolate souffl\u00e9 ( their top dessert ) is a must have. How was it? It was so good that only tasting it on your own can explain the experience.\n\nFood... CHECK!\n\nOverall, it was a perfect experience. Which is worth the money you are shelling out. The food was awesome. The service was exceptional. The place was alive and inviting. Truly deserving of a 5 star.\n\nmore reviews at \nhttp://themealexperience.blogspot.com/", "business_id": "GIGI8bJfN6HyPzmEW-QqjA", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-09-28", "type": "review"}

Delicious spinach salad with bacon dressing and lots of pieces of bacon along with a perfectly soft poached egg.  Followed this with delicious, super fresh mussels  in white wine, cream, and herbs which were perfectly cooked.  The mussels were an appetizer size serving, but in combination with the other things I ordered, I had plenty to eat.  Finished off with the chocolate souffle with Grand Manier chocolate sauce and french press coffee.  The coffee was disappointingly weak (water to coffee grounds ratio was wrong).  The chocolate souffle and sauce needed to be a bit sweeter and richer and did not live up to the other reviews that I read.  Next time I would skip the souffle and coffee and try something different. Cost of dinner was $38 including tax, before tip. It was a very enjoyable evening and I would definitely go back. I agree with others who have said the prices are a little high.  I kept the price of my meal down by ordering 2 appetizers rather than ordering an appetizer and an entree. This saved $10-$15.  I also did not order anything to drink.

As for the burger, I would highly suggest to not order any burger here. Both of our burgers came out and I felt like it was the Wendy's commercial all over again...where's the beef? The beef patty was at least 1/3 smaller than the bun and that's being generous. I've eaten here in the past and it was wonderful. However, the burgers lacked taste and were not filling at all.

Boy, I'm glad that I did. \n\nThe food was amazing, and for not having a children's menu, the waitstaff was uber attentive to my children's wants.  Everything we ordered was fantastic.  One of my kids ordered the Mussels.  I tried one.  The mussels were divine, and the broth flavorful.  The grilled shrimp were of hearty size, and the side of mac and cheese was awesome.  My other child ordered the pork-chop, and I'm not a pork guy, but my wife said is was the best she ever tasted.\n\nMany dishes you'll find elsewhere, but the play with unusual ingredients really works.  I ordered a wedge salad to start, and thought that the added toppings would take away from the overall wedge experience.  But I was wrong.  The toppings really worked and it was the best wedge salad that I've ever had. The filet topped with foie gras was simply to die for.  My wife said that her chicken dish was great.  \n\nFrankie, our server, was simply the best, and I would recommend that you ask for him.  He knew the menu well, and knew what our children would enjoy.  Thanks, Frankie, if you read this.\n\nThe overall experience was a 10 out of 10.

They missed the opportunity to make our customer service experience a relaxing and carefree experience.  It happened at lunch the other day to me and my friend who was in town on business.  We arrived late in the day to avoid any crowds.  Our experience was a series of missed customer service opportunities throughout the meal.   \n\nIt began with two special orders that we placed with our server.  He wrote these requests down and made it clear that he understood what we wanted.  The order gets delivered by someone else.  When the server comes to check on the order, we let him know that both of our orders didn't reflect our requests.  He looks at the plates with a disappointing look and sweeps them away.  He delivers the special requests a few minutes later with his apologies and lets us know his manager is going to come out and \"talk\" to us.  It sounded more like a threat than an attempt to smooth over the mishap.  The manager comes out and gives a weak apology.  Missed Customer Service Opportunity #1:  He wasn't really interested in explaining what happened to our orders or whether it was an inconvenience.\n\nSo I ask myself, who was ultimately responsible for the order, the one delivering it or the server.  The server showed his disappointment and made us think it was the one delivering the order who was at fault.  The restaurant is not busy and they have time to make sure orders get out correctly.  Where is the quality control that I see on \"Hells Kitchen\"?  Restaurants can't afford to get it wrong these days.  \n\nShortly after the entrees were delivered, our order for French fries made it to the table.  Anyone looking at the plate of fries would have noticed that they were overly salted.  We were busy talking so we didn't notice at first.  After a few bites, we both began to feel the burn in our lips from the salt.  Frustrated that they don't really care, we just didn't eat them.   Missed Customer Service Opportunity #2 :  The server never came back to check on the quality of the French fries.  Worse yet, he should have seen that they were overly salted.\n\nWe finish our meals and I request a doggie bag for my leftovers.  The server brings out a container and bag.  I asked my friend, why don't they bag the leftovers anymore?  I noticed that this is a service they no longer provide at many restaurants.  Are they concerned about contaminating my food?  They just served my meal so I don't think that's the case.  Are they too busy?  Missed Customer Service Opportunity #3:  Please, someone tell me why this little act of service is beneath them now.   \n\nI won't be returning anytime soon, sorry to say.", "business_id": "ewZlgc22xN5NNQ1H7U6Y7g", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-11-17", "type": "review"}

Well, tonight I did and I'm glad I gave it another shot.\n\nLets get the negative things out of the way first: \nThe hostess was not very friendly & made me worry that it had been a mistake to go back. The bartender seemed like he was not happy to be there or to talk to us about drinks. It was a little cold in the dining area, but seemed to warm up as the evening progressed.\n\nNow for good things:\nOf course, I got the chicken madeira because I ALWAYS get it and it's ALWAYS delicious. I think the portions are getting a bit smaller these days, but I still had leftovers. Drinks were...meh. I would love if they had a better draught beer selection myself. None of the beers were too exciting so I got a martini and it was...drinkable...maybe. For those prices I'd expect better. Calamari was decent. Cheesecake is always great. \n\nFood was good, but what made tonight's trip overcome the few negatives and past experiences and warrant a 4 star rating was the service. Mandy was great...very friendly and not snooty like some servers in the Scottsdale area can be. She also did not flirt with the guy I was with hoping to get more tips. I hate when servers do that. \n\nThere was one mistake by the kitchen where peas were added to a dish that was requested without them, but they realized before it even came out and Greg (who I can assume was the manager on duty) came over to apologize personally and offer a soup or salad while we waited. We appreciated it but declined the offer. Mandy was attentive and was taking good care of us so we really didn't feel like anything was much of a wait. She mentioned that she is fairly new, but had she not told us, we wouldn't have guessed. \n\nOverall a great trip.

With such an extensive menu, it took us a while to figure out what we wanted.  It was difficult to read the menu as we were on the patio and the lamp overhead had a burned out bulb.  We used the small tea light on the table to shed some light on the menut. After consulting with our waitress, Kourtney A., we ordered the chicken marsala and the fried shrimp platter. In the interim, we were served warm breads with butter.  Really fresh warm bread.  The fried shrimp platter was  amazingly large .  Lots of shrimp, fries with a delicious coleslaw.  Small sauces for dipping were also provided.  I couldn't believe how tasty the shrimp were--not greasy, not too much breading.  The chicken marsala ,which was served with bow tie pasta ,was perfectly cooked and delicious. It was a generous portion-- A real winner of a dish.  \nWe really enjoyed the service Kortney provided as well the good meals we had.

Be very afraid:  Being  \"managed\" by a huge property company means that the on-site management can do or say as they please (or do nothing) and hide behind \"the company\" since there is no one you can get ahold of in the event of a problem or dispute.   The legal practices are questionable - like not showing you the entire lease until the day you move in - then you are surprised with some incredible terms:  Sure, you don't have to sign - but this is on the day you have abandoned your old place and arrive with a moving truck wanting the keys ...    Also - don't be fooled by the seemingly incredible discounts (if you sign a 13 or 24 month lease) - they are indeed too good to be true - and you will indeed regret being fooled.   I assume they can only get away with these practices due to the economy, perhaps with so many people trying to rent instead of own - but this is only grasping for a reason that the company and management behave so badly   Be aware of any company that seems to have as many lawyers than maintenance staff  (they lawyers respond faster than maintenance!)

We've ordered for delivery, plenty of times.  Food is decent, typical deli type food.  But, being a former New Yorker, I don't expect to get an attitude when you screw up my meal that I have had delivered.  They messed up my order and I was very nice about it and asked if they would just give me an IOU for a replacement next time I ordered.  They agreed.  So I took them up on their offer today.  When I called in, to have it delivered, since I am super busy, when I explained the situation, the girl on the phone was very nice and had to ask if they can accommodate me.  The man in the back said \"I don't have time to deliver it! Tell her if she wants it to come and get it!\"  So, reluctantly, I did.  When I picked it up, it was sitting on the counter and the man, who I take it as the owner, pretty much threw it at me. I very nicely said \"Thank you so much\"  Well, he said NOTHING and when I walked out, I said \"Thank you again and I will have a GREAT day too!\"  It's unfortunate that this is the only place in the Kierland Area who delivers salad, but I'm pretty much over this place and the New York Attitude.", "business_id": "8pqdYVXF17grawfgP2fZTA", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-09-04", "type": "review"}

There is an awesome sign draped over the cash register with a woman talking on her cellphone and says \"We WILL NOT serve you while you are on your phone.\" Good for you Jolta Java! Get those annoying people to separate the phone from their ear as a courtesy to the rest of us. \n\nNow, here are the little things that I noticed that makes this place stand at the top. The sandwiches are wrapped in heavy duty paper, not that thin, flimsy wrap that other places have. Love the fruit cup side that is offered. They keep your info so that every 10th drink you order is free. Talk about investing in your customers and community. \n\nI am a huge fan and will continue to take my business to this fine establishment!", "business_id": "I2_yeLfTzXHGwi8an0tL4w", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-11-17", "type": "review"}

It was a 30 minute drive for us.  I poured over at least 70 or 80 reviews that afternoon.  When it comes to oriental food there is a distinct separation into Americanized and Authentic in our population, you need to be aware of what group you belong to. Flo's is definitely for the Americanized palate:(  a group we don't belong to.  But family is family so along we went.\nWe ordered 5 Appetizers: #1-Salt & Pepper Chicken Wings (Seasoned with spicy chile salt and tossed with bell peppers, fresh chiles, and onions) and told there would be a 15 -20 minute wait, no problem.  Also ordered #2-Thai Style Calamari & Chiles. (Breaded calamari seasoned with chile-pepper salt, diced bell peppers, green onions, and a hint of lime). Next #3-Chinese Lettuce Wraps. (Chicken in a sweet hoisin sauce with water chestnuts, mushrooms, and green onions.  #4-Pot Stickers (Pork), and #5-Singapore Chicken Satay (Skewers of tender chicken breast drenched in a rich peanut sauce). The chicken appeared to be ground and somewhat gritty but the peanut sauce was tasty and worth 2 1/2 stars.\n#1 & 2 were listed as spicy, - NOT, no heat at all!  The wings were crispy and had a nice flavor, alone I'd give them a 4 and the Calamari were quite tough and chewy, cut in long thick strips and had a \"fishy\" taste and no spicy taste I'd give a 1.  Also decided to order their Chinese Hot & Sour Soup - A thick and hearty soup made from an old village recipe with chicken, shrimp, tofu, mushrooms, eggs, cilantro, and green onions.  that had rated several rave reviews, I wonder which soup they really had.  No hint of spice, a strange aftertaste and a rather large portion that didn't taste like any other hot & sour soup we have had. Rated it a 1.  The lettuce wraps had no water chestnut crunch and little flavor and rated a 2.  The pot stickers were somewhat dry but with fair flavor and their accompanying dip needed help, gave them a 2 1/2 as I would also give the Lettuce wraps.  The restaurant environment was attractive, appeared clean with rather dim lighting.  Service was fairly good and friendly.  My bill was almost $30 without the tip.

Despite the words \"resort & spa\" in the title, I'm certain I would never come here on vacation.  Overall, the Westin Kierland is well-kept, professional, and wonderfully planned, but in the end winds up feeling a bit sterile for a vacation.\n\nOne star is knocked off because our group requested early check-in, and upon arrival at 1:00 (which isn't very early), they didn't have any rooms available.  Instead, they suggested we take showers at the spa before our 2 p.m. business meeting.  Umm, no.

Westin's typically have their trademark dual-shower-head contraptions in place, but this shower seemed beyond my usual Westin shower experience.  I didn't want to leave.  Ever.  But as I mentioned, I only had the half an hour to shower, etc before our meeting.  \n\nThere is both a lobby bar and a saloon (located on the first floor) in this hotel -- the lobby bar seems to cater more to couples or more professional business folks while the saloon was full of post-conference people looking for a good time.

Also, anyone cleaning up when people leave?  At 6pm only.  Ick.  This needs a major overhaul.  We also really enjoyed the power washing going on outside the pool.

The only saving grace was the banquet facilities and the restaurant staff.\n\nI recently was in town for a business event that took place at the Westin.  We were discounted room rates (although still paying $200/room).\n\nI guess my dissapointing experience started when I pulled up to check in, and needed to promptly leave for an event directly after checking in, and was forced to valet my car (could not leave it in the entry for a few minutes).  They were definitely not very accomodating.  (on a side note, the valet option is one of the only options $27/night, otherwise you end up walking about 1/4 mile to a \"guest\" parking lot.

The walls were paper thin, we could hear everything going on in the room next to us, as well as the maids in the hallway.

(seriously?? pinch some more pennies)\n\nI will say the bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in, and the food from room service was pretty good.

There you will find a \"history\" of Geronimo that calls him a man who \"struck terror into the hearts of settlers\". Nearby is a painting of gallant American soldiers riding horses called \"An Apache Raid - Ride to the Rescue\". How lovely to see soldiers on their way to slaughter or deport the local men, women and children. A quote from Geronimo is nearby where he describes how much he loves the beauty of Arizona and wishes more than anything he could be buried there and inspire his people to survive. Of course he was never able to return. Arizona would become a territory where the new settlers would boast about surviving in the \"rough\" and \"wild\".\n\nThere are a few more pictures and write-ups in this area that characterize the federal government as slow and full of excuses, and that make the job of rounding up locals and pushing them into internment camps sound like a noble and justified day's work -- like pulling out the native weeds to put in asphalt and golf courses.\n\nMeanwhile, downstairs by the meeting rooms, overlooking the nauseating grass hills artificially watered and fertilized to fight back the native beauty of the desert...there are quotes and photos of the early land developers. Herberger is quoted saying \"I would rather have land than money anyday\". He bought land that no one else wanted (too rough and wild) and said it was a beautiful place. No kidding? All that stuff Geronimo said was right? Too bad you lost 100 years and violated human rights before you found this nugget of wisdom. I guess the irony of destroying all the locals and their appreciation of the area and stealing their land is lost on the curators of this homage to genocide. Maybe that's why they don't put the exhibits on the same floor. Instead they give giant kudos to a department store manager from Minnesota who somehow figured out in the 1950s that Arizona is pretty enough to develop for football and golf. \n\nOh, look, a picture of Ronald Reagan. Excuse me while I wipe my vomit off the nicotine stained carpet. Yes, the hotel reeks of smokers. Even the cushions outside have the unmistakable odor of cancer. \n\nAlthough I was asked to stay here for a conference, I refused after seeing their sad and lopsided \"view\" of history plastered all over the walls. This hotel is a shrine of ignorance that makes settlers look like they were defending themselves as they steamrollered over the native people of this land...and then they claim that beauty was really discovered by property developers? I want nothing to do with this hotel.There are many other fine places to stay in the area obviously that do not openly celebrate genocide as justified. And if I wanted to golf I would go to Scotland, not Scottsdale.\n\nOne last point. The help at the restaurants are beyond clueless. It amazes me to watch these kids wander aimlessly among the tables. I was surprised when one finally worked up the courage to ask me if I would like to order a drink. In three hours of sitting outside my party was only able to order once, we then had to pay as soon as the waiter said his shift ended and he disappeared without bringing us change or a receipt. Before trying to eat here I would never have believed servers could be this untalented. My favorite server to watch was the young woman who hovered and doted on an old man three times her age for half an hour, bringing him drinks and free food, while a half dozen tables were completely neglected nearby.", "business_id": "SYqTY48DJa1cYhglvmgvsQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-09-19", "type": "review"}

I came here for a long conference and stayed for many moons, so I really got the chance to get to know some portions really well (and others not so much).  I didn't get to play in the lazy river or golf, but others with me enjoyed this immensely. I did get to take a night in the adult pool and jacuzzi and hit up the spa for a pedi and appreciated having those services. Other than that, it was meeting rooms, hotel room, eating and courtyard for me, not always in that particular order.\n\nThe rooms are nice and I was really happy with mine. I asked for one close to the elevator because I knew how long I was staying and am glad I did. It's a big hotel and I saw other people have to walk a ton. Great bed, great shower and I had a giant balcony. Totally satisfied with that, and I like the $5 voucher they give you every day you decline room cleaning.  The wireless and cell sucks throughout the place, and being without decent wireless for a week-and-a-half was absolutely painful. That's pretty unacceptable when so many people are there for conferences, we have work to do! I like the notion that these people are into fresh air, but this concept is completely lost when you walk out on the courtyard and they are selling cigars. Ugh. It's gross enough but to advertise that you're into clear air while you sell those just is wrong.  The meeting rooms were nice and the buffet food and sack lunches (different meals, different days) were decent. Always huge quantities, meh on selection at some points.  The best was a private meeting working lunch (wow!), the weakest were huge quantites of whatever they could make large quantites of. It stinks that the bottom level of rooms has no wireless or cell at all.\n\nThe food selection gets very old very quick and costs an arm and a leg. Deseo is awesome and worth every penny, but they are only open after a certain time and only on certain days. That leaves you with the Saloon and restaurant downstairs, which is the same kitchen as for room service.  If you are in your room or in the restaurant, you can't argue with the promptness, but if you are in the saloon or the courtyard, sign over your evening now. Everything takes so long, it is impossible to get a lunch and get back to a meeting. There are only a couple girls working it, and half of them are none-too-pleased at that idea.  If you have the time (or the energy after a long day), walk over to Kierland Commons and eat there. If you are on vacation, you have no excuse. Go. They have a ton of different choices there from burgers to sushi, so something for everyone. It's too bad though because the courtyard is a lovely place to hang out for the evening. The temps drop, the company is good and it is a great place to run into people. But it is a better place for drinks and laughter than a meal. If you're into fruity drinks, grab a strawberry daq. They pack a powerful punch! And plan to shower as soon as you get in your room so your hotel doesn't reek of cigars\n\nOverall, it's a nice place in a nice area. The views are lovely, you can walk and eat and shop, and the rooms are nice. Best sleep in awhile!  I can even forgive the bagpipes, which I'm not a fan of, but I think they could step it up with the food offerings and wireless accessibility.", "business_id": "SYqTY48DJa1cYhglvmgvsQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-09-28", "type": "review"}

Looks like every room had one.\n* Staff - I was greeted by literally everyone working at this place, including a super cute little old lady in the lobby who was the fancy equivalent of a Walmart greeter.\n* If you give up daily housecleaning, they give you a $5 food/drink voucher. Being by myself, it was not an issue to not have maid service each day. I had plenty of towels, etc and the front desk replenished toiletries if needed.\n\nCONS:\n* Pricey.  I did my research before I got here and purposely rented a car so I could eat elsewhere. My room had a refrigerator so I stocked up on a few things at the grocery store. Came in handy.\n* Internet - ugh. HORRIBLE. I'm not sure how internet is this bad in 2011 but it seriously hampered my ability to work while I was here. Took forever to connect to pages; I timed out twice while trying to check in to my flight online. Really?\n* Somewhat strange layout - I probably walked 1/8th of a mile from my room to the elevators several times a day. This maybe isn't entirely a con because the exercise was good....but it's a bit inconvenient when you um, forgot your cell phone in your room and don't realize it until you're in the lobby.\n* Some stuff in my room didn't work - a couple outlets, for example. \n* I've never in my life seen a hotel where they provide you with a toilet plunger. Never a good sign, and it doesn't get  better when you actually have to use it. Ick.\n\nI didn't eat here other than a smoothie at the coffee store (yuck, tasted like Pepto Bismol) and what was provided at the conference. I went to Kierland Commons(which can be walked to) or drove a little ways to find other options. If you are even a wee bit adventurous and have a car, you'll find treasure just a few miles away and your wallet (or your expense account) will thank you.\n\nI also was not subjected to the resort fee, unless it was tacked on to my room rate and I didn't know it.", "business_id": "SYqTY48DJa1cYhglvmgvsQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-11-15", "type": "review"}

I just think it's another branding where they can sell less-attractive or fashionable clothes for seemingly less money. \n\nAlthough, if I were to get a suit - I'd certainly give this place a go because suits are all the same and they have pretty decent prices on nice suits. Dress shirts as well - which also are all the same as far as I'm concerned. For hipper clothes, I don't think this place has much going for it. They have all the name brands you would expect to find, but the lines they carry aren't hip and recent memory tells me most of that stuff hasn't been hip. \n\nYou can certainly find better bargains at thrift stores and second hand shops and the clothes are about as stylish. Also, having been to Off 5th Avenue at Arizona Mills, I can say that that place has a much more contemporary and 'hip' selection of clothes and at a better price I think. \n\nThis is just my opinion as a guy - women might have a different experience.", "business_id": "WowrRUKvjiLX4zT12xU_yw", "stars": 3, "date": "2007-10-09", "type": "review"}

Brought a comforter and a suit jacket in two weeks later thinking maybe they just had a bad day the first time. Nope. Both came back looking like they'd barely done anything to them. Stopped going there after that.  \n\nBut that was nothing compared to how my mother was treated here. They shrunk one of her fancy dresses and she brought it back. They took the dress and told her that the owner would be calling her to resolve the issue. Never called. She went in five times over the next two months and just got the same story over and over. \"The owner will call you.\" Nothing. The owner hides behind his employees and does not deserve your business. They do terrible work and when they damaged her dress not only did they not stand behind their work they took the dress and never returned any phone calls or addressed the problem. If you look at the other Yelp reviews there are numerous people here who had the same experience. Ruined clothes, phone calls that never get returned and a company that does not stand behind their work.

Ugh. Big mistake. \n\nFirst off--they have A MILLION sales people there who creepily stalk you from the MOMENT you get in the door. You end up walking around the store trying to avoid the guys/girls in black shirts who continually ask you if you need help and try to sell the furniture. (Um, yeah, thanks but it doesn't matter to me if this piece is your favorite or what warranties it comes with...I need to measure and visualize this piece in my home which only I can do, hopefully undistributed...) It's WORSE than buying a car. It makes you want to leave the store but you can't because you need/want furniture...\n\nI did like a few of their dining room tables and couches but everything was SO expensive. Like, overpriced expensive. I don't mind paying more for quality or customer service but I just felt like I was getting ripped off every minute I was there. However, at the end of the day I walked away with a table in mind and went home to confirm measurements. \n\nI ended up checking a few more stores to make sure it was \"the one\" and I actually found one that I liked WAY better and was $150 cheaper at Mor (with NO pushy salespeople).\n\nOh, and they don't include measurements on the item tag...I think this is ploy to make you talk to a sales rep because they all carry tape measures but they only let you borrow it while they linger around and watch you take measurements, talking the ENTIRE time\n\nBottom Line: Ashley's stuff is fine and you can probably find something you like and want to buy, but their sales approach and prices aren't worth it--shop around. The furniture stores I visited after Ashley (Razmataz, Mor, random other stores, had NORMAL sales people who asked you once if you needed help and then left you alone).", "business_id": "1JtBZRcuyLnFn9pGmwMddg", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-09-15", "type": "review"}

(yes, I probably need help) \nAnyways, I found someone new. \nThe one I have been waiting and hoping for. \nAmber @ Choppers. \nShe was friendly, funny and incredibly helpful.( Has great taste in shoes too! ) \nAnd may I say, I look fabUlous! \nShe took my hair from BLAH to \"Ohhhh, Ahhhhh...yea baby!\" . \nMore about how fabulous I look in a moment.... \nThe salon was very cool! I walked in and loved the leopard print, the toolboxes that holds all of the stylist's gear..it was cool and hip, I felt like I was in NY or LA, NOT pretentious or intimidating at all. \nAll of the other stylists were friendly , everyone smiled, good environment! \nI had explained to Amber my hair woes and she immediately knew what I needed. She played around with my hair and asked it I would be interested in this or that, she was very attentive... Loved it! \n My hair was medium length (past shoulders a bit) with very uneven layers and ZERO style, (very drowned rat-ish) \nNow, my hair grazes my shoulders and is kinda like a bob cut, all one length. It looks neat, classy ,sexy and very stylish. \nI am so freakin' happy! I have never had a hair cut , where when I get home after the hair cut , I walk by the mirror and scream, \"I love it!!!!!\" (perhaps too much caffeine?) \n\nThis is huge for me people...I recommend AMBER at Choppers. I will go back to her again and again. Boyfriend is away and I am not going to tell him about my hair, would like to surprise him.

Erica was my stylist and I explained the new color I was looking for- I had tons of re-growth and wanted a new warmer color perfect for fall and and a partial foil. I said \"give me honey.\" Wow, did she ever. She lightened my roots, left the underside pretty dark ( my natural dark brown) and blended in a few shades of gold and amber that are simply perfect. It's so much more than I described to her! I am already getting compliments and my boyfriend loves it. Did I mention that she also blew it out straight AND flat ironed at NO EXTRA CHARGE??!! I walked out paying a little over $100 (after happily giving her a 20% tip) with a huge smile. She was amazing, friendly, and totally welcoming. Oh, and a glass of white wine while waiting for the color to process wasn't too shabby either :)\n\nI'm in no hurry for this gorgeous color to grow out, but know I'll be there seeing her again when it does!", "business_id": "0nUI6eiZ5uT70qD1Ht9VMg", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-09-18", "type": "review"}

As a person who is very anxious when it comes to getting my hair cut, I turned to Yelp to see what was available around here and found Choppers. Based on the reviews that I had seen, this place had to be good. I was wrong. It was AWESOME. I saw Erica just for a hair cut at the time, and she did an amazing job. I don't typically get my hair cut very often, so I don't usually remember the person who did it, but she did such a great job that I remembered her name almost a year later, when I reckoned it was time to go again, so I called up and scheduled an appointment with her again, and also an appointment to fix a terribly gross and faded home-done bleach/dye job. As a person who isn't terribly picky, I wasn't looking for perfection, but perfection is what I got and I was thrilled with the results. She's fantastic, and as someone who has issues with anxiety around other people, she makes you feel comfortable and at ease. I know who my hair stylist is going to be as long as I'm living in the area. I'd highly recommend her.\n\nI haven't scheduled appointments with any of the others there, but everyone that I've talked to who worked there is super nice as well. Go there.

He was friendly, knew his stuff, and that portion was a 5 star. \n\n  The 2nd part is my 1 star rating in the department of false advertising. Posted everywhere this close to the holiday is SALE SALE SALE up to 50% off. Steve said it was an employee type of sale pricing that happens twice a year. We picked two items, put the 20% down, and just needed to proof the order online for delivery. We accidentally forgot our dimensions of measurements so we went online to check. Right online In black and white it said the couches we were buying were 1299 a piece including delivery the store's price on the specific items said 1599 a piece, and our invoice stated 1099 each, we got free delivery from the balloon pop special but the extended warranty put us above 1299 as stated online included everything. Reality is we didn't save the 3-400 per item, but in fact paying full retail!!!\n\n  I called the store to remove the extended warranty, which nobody could help me with, which in turn delayed our delivery date & only our sales rep could do this? (Really??), You can see my order, but you can't update it, thus delaying my delivery? I asked about the online pricing versus the instore pricing and the guy (not Steve) specifically said they raise the prices on inventory 2 weeks before the sale to cosmetically make customers believe they are getting a huge savings & the website doesn't always update properly. Online is wrong, store is correct. I said to him \"let me get this right, all year it is 1299\"? Yup, \"1299 includes delivery\"? Yup, \" & 2 weeks ago all stores jack up the prices & buying them at the all year price of 1299 from 1599 is done for cosmetic reasons to lead customers to believe they are getting a huge bargain\"? Yup, as he giggled & said delivery are balloon pop items to be included at the 1299 price, so all you are really saving is the delivery charge per item and since you are getting 2 items, they deduct it off both bringing your price down to 1099.\n\n  We love the couches we picked but will be canceling our order unless they honor the 1299 price and give us the 3-400 dollar savings as stated we saved. They probably figured I would never check or a small percentage does, just as I thought this review would be helpful to others. \n\n  Happy Holidays!!", "business_id": "Oqd9hAQUAN128Nr1QcbdjA", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-11-26", "type": "review"}

NOT.  i really did shoot 4 over through 9 but i'm definitely not a 6-handicap.  anyway, the course is in great shape, and the services are killer.  they even have refridgerated carts!  how do they do that, you say?  they have ice boxes on the carts and blowers to blow cold air on you as you drive around.  it's actually pretty nice even though we played around sunset so we didn't need them too much.  good resort and good course and good facilities.  knock off only one star for being way too easy.", "business_id": "QaKtwJTSoIgQE1Yg3qiEXA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-10-12", "type": "review"}

They will even special order stuff for you.\n\nOn Saturdays, they are only open between 10-2, and closed on Sundays.  They advertise as being by appointment only, but you can walk in and shop just like I did.  I was greeted by a young lady who was professional in every way.  I asked her a lot of questions, and she was able to answer every single one for me.  I told her I just needed a few every day bras, nothing fancy or exciting.  \n\nShe had me step into a fitting room, and measured me for size.  She brought in a variety of bras, and I tried on each one to see what I liked best.  To my delight, most of the bras in the store were all reasonable in cost to what I would spend elsewhere...between $40-70 dollars.  \n\nI should also mention that the measuring was obviously at no charge.  I was so thrilled to actually have someone who knew what they were doing during the entire session!  No pushy saleswomen, no bad information, no trying to upsell me on a bra I didnt want or need.  \n\nI also found out that they have a location in Tucson, and that has been around for about 50 years, and thier Scottsdale location has been around for about 15 years.

After an intimidating sales experience, I left with an uncomfortable bra that I couldn't bring myself to wear.\n \nI decided to cut my losses and get a new bra at a different store: Alice-Rae. I wore the other bra (because I was embarrassed by all the other ones I own!) and after seeing the red marks around my chest, Julie told me it was way too tight. After measuring me, she brought me some bras to try on. Unlike the other store, I felt comfortable saying what I didn't like about each bra. She apologized and told me she doesn't carry a lot of bras in my size (which I now know is a 34C) but that I'm very average and should just go to a department store. She put an extender on the bra I wore in and t fit perfectly. Rather than sell me a new bra (which I was totally ready to buy) she remedied the one I already had for $3. \n\nOn top of all this, before I came in, I called for the hours. It was just after 5 and she told me they usually close at 5 but she would be working a bit late so I could come by. So she ended up working late for me and still was happy to just help me with the bra I came in with. \n\nFinally, she works with an organization that collects used bras for domestic violence women's shelters. What great people.", "business_id": "jOu97u0aiyD9IWxZO8YB0g", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-10-18", "type": "review"}

In fact, they can be vastly different since they are managed independently.  We came from one of the nicest Y's possibly in the country in University Park, Texas.  The Scottsdale Y is OK.  The gym has a good variety and number of cardio machines.  I have been very satisfied by the adult offerings.  They also provide 2 hours of child care a day for members, which is nice.  My kids love the playroom there and usually don't want to leave.  I have been very disappointed with the kids programs which is why we chose the Y over LA Fitness.  We almost joined swimming for kids, but after watching a few lessons, I decided to go elsewhere.  It appears that the teachers change every week.  I watched a private lesson where the instructor didn't even get in the water with the kid, but barked commands from the edge of the pool.  How awful.  We recently tried the Itsy Bitsy sports.  It is supposed to be an intro to t-ball, basketball and soccer for toddlers.  On day one, they tried to have my 4 year old dribble across the court, do chest shots and lay-ups.  C'mon now.  They did give me a refund for the class which was nice.  My last comment is that the pool is really gross.  We've tried to swim there with the kids, but the water just doesn't smell very good and there are hairballs everywhere.  The locker rooms are also not super clean either.  But if you just stick to the gym, the adult classes and the child care, you should be fine.   The last perk is that I have been able to use other Y's across the country due to my membership here.  It's definitely a great value.", "business_id": "NKKt_CxHCggMvuvrqJEjSA", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-11-02", "type": "review"}

So to avoid further harassment from my daughter we decided to look into joining a gym about a month ago.  After doing some research the YMCA seemed to be the best fit for us.\n\nWe joined as a family about a month ago and so far I am really enjoying the YMCA in Scottsdale.  If you are looking for a well maintained gym that has a pool, tons of classes, and a day care (at no additional cost with the family plan) and not full of muscle heads this is the place for you.  \n\nI have taken about 10 spin classes so far and Lisa is a great instructor at 5:30am so definitely recommend giving her class a try if you can get your butt up early enough.  Every time I have gone my day has seemed to be more productive.\n\nFor those (and I am one of them) that need extra motivation to work out the YMCA uses a progress logging system called Fitlinx.  You can sign up for a free intro to the machines that are part of this system.  Each time you visit the gym you log in and those circuit or cardio machines (and there are many) that are tied into the Fitlinx system it will record your progress.  The YMCA even reports weekly progress of top members so for those competitive folks this is the perfect incentive to getting off the couch and into the gym.  I know its working for me as I don't like seeing my name so far down the list.\n\nFor the price the YMCA is definitely worth checking out if you are considering joining a gym.", "business_id": "NKKt_CxHCggMvuvrqJEjSA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-09-20", "type": "review"}

Before that I've tried many big box gyms like LA Fitness and Ballys. This place is definitely different than those other gyms.\n\nFirst the good stuff:  \n\nFor everything they offer, it's pretty affordable.\n\nI love that I have never have a problem finding a treadmill (even at peak hours), there are no time limits on the cardio machines, and each treadmill has an individual TV screen with all the basic cable channels. If you are a techie like me, you can also download tv shows and movies to your iPod or iPhone watch them on the treadmill's TV via an Apple specific adapter.\n\nPersonally, I have not tried any of the classes, but there are TONS (there are 2 studios) and they aren't all offered in the middle of the work day like a lot of the gyms I had previously belonged to.\n\nI've been doing weight training with Teri, a personal trainer there for the last several months and have really enjoyed the experience. She's extremely knowledgeable and encouraging. The personal training is also very affordable.\n\nThe not so great stuff:\nIf you have kids, you're probably going to think this gym is awesome. However, I do not have kids and I usually find myself wading through big crowds of children just to get to the locker room and then again on the way to the exercise room. Many times there unsupervised children running around, screaming and playing in the small locker room, which I find slightly (ok, REALLY) annoying.\n\nThe weight area of the gym is can be crowded during the hours of 5:30 - 7 pm when I am there. This was more apparent in the summer, now that it is winter time it seems to be less of a problem. Finding parking can be a problem, though there is another lot near by, you just have to walk a little farther. The locker room is usually a mess with puddles and clutter. I think my usual workout time must coincide with the youth swim team. Those kids must not be too concerned about their stuff being stolen because they leave their bags and and backpacks out all over the benches. There are only 3 toilets in there and it seems like half the lockers don't have a working latch that can be locked.\n\nFinally, they are usually closed on holiday weekends.

We were not greeted upon arrival and trying to find someone to help us was impossible. A lady actually looked at us then pretended to be busy on her iPad. Fantastic.\n\nI returned about a week later as they had some items I wanted to buy, in particular a French cloche that they have on display during the holiday season. I went to the store and was completely ignored by various members of staff. The couple behind us were greeted. \n\nI went to the 2nd floor to find someone to assist me with my purchase. A lady looked me up and down and obviously I was deemed below par. I asked where I could buy the cloche to which I was told it would be an online purchase they don't carry them in store. What store doesn't'carry smaller items?  My son who is 9 wanted to go up to the top floor where they sell some toys etc. I was approached by a male store employee who was actually the first person to acknowledge our existence.  I explained to him my disappointment about the customer service so far and felt that the staff were quite condescending and rude.\n\n I think customer service means moving your head from the 45 degree angle that it seems to be permanently stuck looking  at an iPad, a smile isn't too much to ask for.\n\nI leave the store after having waited for around 15 minutes for some items that  my children wanted. I'm told my necklace is \"sweet\" and asked if I made it. What on earth......\n\nI leave the store pretty pissed. I'm British and we are known for being pretty reserved  but I'm so annoyed I call RH customer service. They take note of my experience and want full descriptions of the staff members who treated us like crap. Let it be known I didn't rock up to the store in my pyjamas nor wearing a track suit but was treated like I was.\n\nAnyhow, I decide to place an order online for the cloche and also four pairs of the faux fur slippers. Ten days later and $17 postage down the drain I receive my items. The slippers are below hotel quality - back to the Uggs for us. The bloody Cloche is the smaller version that I did not want. This is why they should sell items in store so you can actually see the damn thing rather than guessing from the 18 different styles online.\n\nI call the scottsdale location to explain that I would like to exchange my cloche as I have the wrong one. The sales person is quite clearly having difficulty understanding my BRITiSH accent. I proceed to spell out cloche phonetically and she ends up with croche!?  Sales lady keeps saying hello and then corrects me abut the item even though the website lists it as a cloche. By this point I'm seriously frustrated. I ask if there is someone there who would be able to understand me. She then asks if I'm speaking English . I don't think I have ever been so directly insulted. \n\nI go in to the store. Ignored once again. My husband wonders why we have been overlooked in the queue once again. I finally get to speak to someone. I am refunded for the scuffs. I am then asked to place the order for my new cloche. I am told I will not be refunded by the store for the glass vase and it will be put back on to my visa debit circa 15 days. Thanks RH you now have my money AND my item and I'm left with zip.\n\nI decided to call their customer service line again and they are pretty disgusted. They can't believe that once again we have had a horrible experience in the scottsdale store. I am refunded immediately for my returned item and my new cloche is dispatched by expedited mail with an added 20% off. The sales lady was super nice and actually won me over or else I would have not ordered again.\n\nPlease note RH Scottsdale staff, you WORK there, you don't own the store. You work in retail, customer service is everything. Learn to smile and stop behaving like you have the most taxing job in the world.  West elm is right along the street. I went there I was greeted immediately. 2 sales reps went the extra mile to make sure I was happy with my purchases and guess what - they were polite and friendly to my children! \n\nI won't order through RH Scottsdale again purely based on their customer service and their demeanor.

The roll I got before eating was harder than I would have liked, but the pesto/olive oil that came with it was quite pleasant. On the recommendation of the server, I got one of their chef's special dishes, the Ciambotta Di Pollo e Salsiccia. Again, nothing was wrong with it.

The chicken and peppers were roughly cut in all sizes. Then the biggest problem with the whole experience was the price. For my lunch of only iced tea and an entree, I paid just over $20 after tax and tip. Now I don't have a problem with paying $20 for a meal, not at all. But for that price, I expect quality.

Salads were nice and fresh.  Prices were in line with one would expect to pay.  The menu has many dinner choices.  Although we didn't get dessert, it looked delicious.\n\nI will return here on my next visit to North Scottsdale.", "business_id": "fmWyI5ec05F8PJpx3eNpLg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-10-13", "type": "review"}

We wanted Italian food and remembered a place we hadn't been to for a few years. It is well organized. A minute after we were seated ice water and bread were served. The bread had the look and feel of a small Rhodes bread loaf if the product still exists. It was very white and quite substantial. The dipping sauce was not memorable: olive oil (I think) and some vinegar (I think) and some mystery herbs. Everything was better from there.  We skipped appetizers, salad and soup. The salads looked good. My wife loved the gnocchi, my chicken, sausage and noodles were great. One friend loved the ravioli and the other the chicken breast. Food prices were fair. Desserts made up for other food prices: spumoni for $7.50 seems high and same for cheesecake. The wine was also expensive  $7 for house merlot is expensive though $7.50 for a glass of Sangiovese not so bad. Service was good until it got busy.

It took several questions to determine a recommendation.\n\nI ordered the recommended veal and my wife ordered the recommended eggplant Parmesan.  Surprisingly nothing came with the food.  The pasta on my plate was disappointing and bland.  The veal itself was paper thin and rather tasteless and tough.  The eggplant parmesan was good according to my wife but nothing special.\n\nFor a 4 star restaurant we expected better tasting food and far better service.\n\nWhen it came time to pay, the waitress brought the bill and then disappeared for over twenty minutes.  Given how small the restaurant is, this was no easy feat and yet she buzzed by various tables purposely not looking our way.\n\nThe waitress seemed to be more outgoing with other tables, just not us.

While I haven't quite experienced what i would consider poor patient care i have recently experienced poor service from staff. \n\nMy west highland white terrier was a patient at Scottsdale hills for a few years and during that time had some tests, xrays, etc. performed.  Recently when pet became ill i contacted Scottsdale hills to obtain any records that they had because i was seeing a couple specialists (cardiologists and internal medicine) who wanted to see all history dating back as far as possible.  Having had X-Rays and other tests completed at Scottsdale hills a few years ago i figured this would be a good place to start collecting data but they had none.  In fact they had no record of me what so ever and blamed this due to a newly updated system.  \n\nThe service representative i spoke to initially could not find any records using my last name, pets name, or phone number as points of reference.  I then mentioned family members which share the same last name had been there within the last few months and had fairly consistent visits prior to that.  The service representative searched for every last name starting with the first two letters of my name with no results then asked if perhaps i had another last name?  Then asked if i had contacted the right establishment. After becoming rather frustrated i was told that someone would look into the matter at once and call me back.  A couple weeks (or more) later i receive another call from same service representative asking me to remind them if they ever found my pets records.  I said no, she searches again and no record of anyone with my last name.  At this point its too late anyway because i've already seen specialists so i politely say that its okay but mention that i will be reviewing them.  Around 10 minutes later i receive another call mentioning that they have managed to find info on one pet belonging to a family member but nothing on mine.\n\nIf you're looking to a long term vet i suggest looking past this establishment because their inability to store, archive or properly maintain medical information that you are paying them to accrue may be lost and you just might find yourself in my situation.  I understand the need for businesses to modernize technology but find it surprising that there was no method to search data stored in a previous system or that my request was not prioritized until i mentioned the word \"review\".", "business_id": "ul28DO_afdK_gWDLqmudeA", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-09-10", "type": "review"}

But when I got it home, it didn't work. I thought it might just need a new fuse. And rather than schlep around to the lighting department of the big box home repair stores looking for the right fuse, I decided to check with the experts. So I took it to Valley Light Gallery where Becky Wasserman helped me. \n\nIt wasn't the fuse. It needed a new plug. I would never have figured that out on my own (or with any DIY help from the home repair stores). I'm so glad I visited Valley Light Gallery because they fixed it for me in just a few minutes. I didn't have to return the gift to the discount retailer for a refund.\n\nThey fixed a light that I purchased somewhere else! That's what I call great customer service.\n\nWhile i was there, Becky also looked up the replacement bulbs it would need. They are not standard, so she printed out the page from their bulb catalog so I could include it for my friend. Now he has an amazing light, and he knows where to go to get the replacement bulbs (and the part number) when that time comes.\n\nI love supporting our local community businesses. And I heartily recommend you check out Valley Light Gallery for any lighting needs you have. Not just to purchase new lights, but also to get your favorites fixed when they need that. \n\nWhile i was there, I spent some time checking out their collection of industrial lighting and fell in love with a two of them. Now I'm daydreaming about putting one of them as a chandelier in my home office.\n\nThank you to Becky and the great staff at Valley Light Gallery for turning around my potentially frustrating and disappointing retail experience. I'll be back!\n\nPS My friend loved the light!", "business_id": "UnoVA__qAASAMbPnrm_puQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-10-31", "type": "review"}

The guy works there his name is Jim  suggested me to use DHL because is shipper than ups . I agreed so he asked me all the informations such as who is the receiver,what is in side the box and how much is the value ,I honestly told him everything with nothing hidded . The estimated time he showed and also on my receipt was  Sep30. \nWhen the item arrived at chengdu , the DHL Carrie contacted my brother right away get identification from my brother and a letter from him because  custom needed for some reason.My brother gave it right away . 2weeks later Till October 13th the item still hold at custom . I have been keep calling DHL customers service for past week  they could not tell me a reason why the custom holding my package so long it's almost 20days ! At the same time my brother was contacting China DHL for almost every day .Finally DHL said something about by law . People can't Shipping two phones to China. It's against by law . So DHL asked my brother see if my brother has friends works in custom to get our package out otherwise custom would keep it .\nSecond day my mom had to  to take train from where we live to chengdu to talk to custom officer .I mean really ?????that is so stupid that DHL even asked my family to go .so my mom took a day off at work had to come all the way from city to another city to talk the custm . Custom told my mom it's illegal to send two phones from United to China. my mom had to explain my situation to the custom.Finally custom felt very sorry for us and told my mom they understand its DHL s fault in United state because it's there responsibility to tell the shipper all the informations before the item was shipped ! So China customs did a special consideration let it went through clearance !\nI felt so mad at this point . \n1. It was a gift for my brother and sister in law for a special event I paid international express mail  it surposrly deliver in 3-5days  we waited 20days !\n2. The guy works at the center did not tell me about by law I can't send two phones together . If it's not my mom went all the to chengdu talk to custom my brother won't get phones and the custom would keep it ! \n3. It wasted me so much time to call DHL deal with all the rude representive.no one was help but saying they don't know .\n\nAt this point I felt so irritated and I feel I should get full refund !so I called DHL again they said they can't process refund because I paid at ups store not directly to DHL . They told me contact ups to file a clam and DHL will refund the money to ups and ups have to refund me. Okay I contacted James at this ups store. I was hoping he can help me out . But no he said there is nothing he can do about it , he got the address right he done his job right ! I tried to explain to him by law In China  you can't ship two phones but he never told me what is custom requirement .He answered \"how am I suppose to know \" that's bullshit because every time I went to usps ship clothes to my brother usps would let you know what's the policy of that country! Also ups or DHL should have knowledge of customs requirements that's by law. It is unacceptable when he said how him suppose to know !!!! He wouldn't work with my at all !!!! \nOver all I want to let people know DHL is worst carrier don't waste your money and also I would not  come to this ups store if I want ship anything in the future . I am not sure if Jim  is the owner or just employee works there but the fact is he careless about your mail get on time And safely to destination and he thinks his job is weight the item and get right address calculate the money and you pay for it and Nothing else ...\nBe aware !!!!!!", "business_id": "dG4jjy-a_s4zvYNBfKF5KQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-10-14", "type": "review"}

We have been to this restaurant a few times and while we love the food and atmosphere, the lack of customer service and class that the owner/manager showed to us tonight was absolutely inexcusable. After we ordered our food, the waitress told us that their credit card machine was down but that it should be fixed soon. After we ate our meal, we were presented with the check without a word about the machine. We figured it got fixed. When the waitress brought our credit card back to our table she said that the machine was still down. She told us we had to leave the restaurant and find an ATM that we could use, then come back to pay cash. I told her that I really didn't want to have to do that, considering we had a small child with us. I offered to pay by check. She checked with the owner/manager and he said no. She apologized to us and said that she would have taken the check if it were up to her. All of a sudden the owner/manager comes to our table and starts yelling about the situation. He said that he was \"stuck\" and that there was nothing he could do about it. I offered again to pay by check but he told me that there was \"no way\" he could take that. I said \"so you will run the risk of all these people leaving to go get money instead of offering an alternative way to pay, such as a check?\" Then he started blabbering about God or something like that. I also told him that we will get charged a fee to pull out of the nearest ATM, then he said \"well how much can that fee be? Here take a couple bucks off the bill\" I said \"forget it, don't bother\" He was throwing his arms up in the air and he was very loud, which was completely embarrassing to us. This was a Saturday night around 7pm, and it was very crowded. My small child saw that the man was yelling at me so she started crying, saying \"mommy!\" We could have made an even bigger scene since we did nothing wrong and were being treated so poorly, but we chose the high road. Needless to say, we left to find cash and brought it back. We will never return there again and I will be sharing this experience with our friends and family.

The first thing you should know is that this place gets packed during peak hours at all times of the year.  This isn't just a snow bird place and is more of a neighborhood joint.  So, make a reservation or be prepared to wait.  Also, the place is a bit cramped (cozy?) but there is not much that can be done about that.  The service is always excellent and the prices are a bit high.  All the entrees I've tried have been excellent.  It is best to stick with the Italian basics of which this place does the best in my opinion.  They try to be creative with some of their dishes (ex. caprese chicken) which they don't pull off as well as would be expected.  My favorites are he gnocchi and lasagna which are some of the best around.  Their homemade pasta dishes are also very good.\n\nThe only thing that pisses me off about this place is their bread which is plain and blah and that they charge you an extra $5 to upgrade their crappy side salad to a Caesar.\n\nAnyway, it is nice to have a cozy, friendly, Italian spot with good food so close to home.", "business_id": "gHKB66up5VluCWT4vuSZpw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-11-13", "type": "review"}

Even at the discounted Restaurant Week price, this is a pricy restaurant.

First course, 3 had Caesar salad, which was \"pretty good,\" according to the family. I had onion soup, which was tasty and very hot. Not exceptional or deep in flavor but \"pretty good.\" All 4 of us ordered the 6-oz filet. I think they lacked seasoning and were not as tender as I would expect from a high end restaurant.  They were \"pretty good\" (way better than Outback, not nearly as good as steak houses mentioned above).\n\nWe did the rounds of dessert: chocolate mousse, cheesecake, chocolate souffl\u00e9 and creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e.  Souffl\u00e9 was rubbery. Mousse was proclaimed \"excellent\" by my son. Cheese cake and br\u00fbl\u00e9e were \"pretty good.\"\n\nSo I have to call the entire dinner just \"pretty good.\"  Food was not worth the hefty price tag but the service was very nice.

Therefore, Mortons gets one star! The business is extremely homophobic- so be cognizant of that. I was with my husband and we were celebrating a rather joyous anniversary dinner. The waiter walked by and saw me sitting on the same side of the table as my husband. He approached and said \"sir, you can sit opposite your friend if you'd like\". I informed him that he is my husband, not a friend.  Further, I was quite comfortable in my seat. He seemed bothered by that answer. About 5 minutes later he walked over and ask me \" Sir, would you and your friend mine not holding hands. It is offensive to some people- we don't all agree with your lifestyle choice\". I asked him to stop calling my husband my friend, and I told him I have every right to hold his hand. He was extremely agitated at this point. After dinner I gave my husband a quick kiss on the cheek as I gave him the watch I bought for his anniversary gift. The waiter walked up and set the check on the table and said \" you and your friend can't kiss in here. It's not appropriate\". \n\nWhy does he keep calling him my friend? \nI corrected him 2 separate times. \nA few other couples were holding hands and no one approached them. I saw several kisses that were far more involved then my simple peck on the cheek - no one asked them to stop. \n\nThis place seriously needs to learn to respect it's customers.

Upon arriving we were seated immediately and then waited and waited , yet the restaurant was half full.  Finally our server appeared.  When I asked for the Halloween special    menu, at first, she appeared to not know what I was talking about.  Finally she admitted there were a few specials but said that there was nothing written down.  She proceeded to tell us what the special menu was.  It was difficult to understand her as the music was very loud and English was not her first language.  Finally after repeating it several times for us it was not what I had read so I pulled out my phone and brought the menu up so the other members of our party could read it.  How difficult is it to print off a special menu, unless you don't want customers to know about it.  It took forever to get out wine, while she kept asking us if we wanted to order.  Finally the wine came and we ordered.  Two in our party ordered the filets and said they were \"fair\".  I had the Chicken Christopher and although it was good, it had a large amount of garlic, which masked the chicken taste and was a very large portion.  All in all, our meal was rather lackluster, which is not what one would expect for two hundred dollars.  The service was average at best.  Immediately after signing the check I saw a hand come across in front of my face and the server's hand snatch up the check -something I find inexcusably rude in any restaurant - especially a place such as Morton's.  I guess checking the amount of the tip I left was more important than manners.  On the way out I mentioned it to a guy standing at the front desk when he asked how our meal was and he said \"Give me more details\" which I tried to do but he was too busy looking at the computer screen in front of him and he never asked who the server was.  Obviously he did not care.  \n\nI have never been a big fan of Morton's but have always left the door open as restaurants do improve, this is a beautiful restaurant and located very close to our home, however, the door is now shut and I will never return nor recommend it to anyone.", "business_id": "_YswYrpv6YdO3R3CP8R8oQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-11-01", "type": "review"}

The bartender served us up and we enjoyed the drinks and the game. After about 20 mins we asked for menus and the service went downhill after that. We were stunned.

No big deal but the other two ate while the third in our party waited without any excuses or apologies. I could go on and on about the lack of service but why?

RA always has a great selection.  This was the first time going to this particular location.  We were very disappointed.  Our waiter took more than 4 minutes to even come to our table and greet us and take our drink orders. Just a little information before I go on....this was at 3pm on a Saturday and they were not busy AT ALL.  He finally gets our drink order (sodas) and it takes him a while to deliver them.  We place our food order, several minutes later we get our food but never received our soups as our appetizer.  That got corrected after bringing it up to our server.  Now all our drinks were empty and needed refilled.  We had to flag him down and ask for refills, he had his hands full so would be \"right back\".  He didn't come back, we had to again track him down to get more soda.  While we were waiting I went to the restroom, it was gross, papertowels overflowing and trash on the floor.  The restaurant itself looked a lot like this also.  There were wrappers and debri all over the dining area.  You would think being in North Scottsdale Keirland things would look nicer.

Well I decided to come here just for that last weekend. It was not busy at all which is very strange as it was prime time on a weekend night and we were seated outside. Let me bottom line it: the food has completely gone downhill and the service is TERRIBLE. Our waiter was nice but seemed kind of new because he would rarely come around to check on us... like 20 minute intervals at least. My husband didn't like his iced green tea so he asked he send it back, he forgot my husband's replacement drink order until we asked again for it. He said he \"comped\" us for the iced green tea even though we drank hardly any of it and asked for it to be sent back. He never brought us water, I had to walk inside and ask the bartender for water. He forgot the soy sauce and ramekins for our sushi, so my husband had to walk inside and ask for this as well. We're not particularly picky people but when we get a night out we expect basic service. \n\nNow on to the food, I used to LOVE the crazy monkey rolls. I mean I craved them so much it's the reason I went there last weekend. To my disappointment, it was sloppily put together and there was more cream cheese in there than anything. It actually did not even taste good.\n\nLong story short, due to the terrible service and decreasing quality of their food we will not be returning unless it only for happy hour drinks or something. There are far better sushi places in the area with comparable prices, Sakana is amazing for example.", "business_id": "nk6_ipMkmUvUtq6Xvncf0A", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-09-02", "type": "review"}

I actually work at a nail bar and love it but was getting sick of the colors we have. I decided to go to a different place for a full set gel and was super nervous about it. I got there and was greeted by both of the owners who were super nice and lead me to their gel polishes. They have a nice little bar area too but if you dont mention a drink they wont ask if you want anything... Anyway, Im so indecisive about the colors and just had my tech start doing my nails while I thought about what color i really wanted. Corrina (sp?) was my tech and was very nice. I am so so picky about my nails and criticized everything she did. I finally just stopped watching her and started relaxing. She did however make me look at my nails here and there to make sure it was how i wanted it and it was!! After deciding between neutral colors to a black color, i finally went with a tiffany blue and Corrina was very patient with me while i decided. The prices are pretty reasonable for the spa treatment you get. Mind you the manicure does not come with a massage so if thats something you like add it on! They also prefer cash tips and do not do CC tips so they have an ATM machine for you to get cash out, the man-owner was very nice and even gave me back the $3 surcharge the ATM machine charges!  \n\nOver all, i would definitely recommend this place!! :)", "business_id": "Q-hSD_aOi3S5s2zWNvwD4w", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-09-21", "type": "review"}

She referred me to Rachel. I asked specifically not to have a toner put on after the highlights; that I wanted to keep my natural hair color including the gray as much as possible and just have the highlights on the regrowth. Once Rachel rinsed the product out, she said she had to put on a toner. When I told her I was frustrated by this because it was specifically what I did not want, she brought Alicia over to talk to me. I was surprised when she told me it was my fault; that I should never say what I don't want. It felt like she was angry with me. I felt very uncomfortable and just wanted to leave. Rachel seemed like a nice person. I would have preferred to deal just with her rather than feel belittled by Alicia.\n\n\nUPDATE: After Alicia's response, I thought readers should know all the messaging that went back and forth after I wrote this review. \n\nAlicia B.\nOwner \n\nRachael, I'm so sorry you felt so uncomfortable and were embarrassed. However it would have been in more integrity to have written me a letter personally  than post a BAD review over the internet about me and my salon. I understand and get that you were frustrated and angry.   This is a real Back at YA.  I got the message and will be more careful.  Thank you\nAlicia\n \nRachael A. \n\nI hear what you are saying Alicia.  I thought Yelp was suppose to be a forum to give upfront reviews - not filtered. Maybe I'm wrong and will think twice before posting any reviews.  As far as sending you a personal letter, you made me feel small and insignificant.  You are fairly intimidating, but I think you know that.  I did not want a second helping.  This is not meant as a \"Back at Ya.\"  It's meant to be a \"Here was My Experience.\"\n \nAlicia B.\nOwner \n\nThank you for your feed back, however i'm not sure of the second helping, Your feedback on yelp is pretty damming to me over the internet and for the public to see and view.  It is obvious your motive is for others to see your experience instead of letting me know, you posted it for the world to see.  That is so hurtful and mean.  I am so sorry that you felt uncomfortable, I hurt  your feelings.  Its your responsibility to handle your feelings and let the other person know what is your feelings so we could have talked about that or a letter to share your feelings. She came and got me because she said you wanted to talk to me.  I only relayed what I understood and heard.  I am so sorry that I ever came to handle a situation which was obviously wrong on my part.  You make me sound like I am some one no can come and talk to which is not true. Again I apologize and you were right for your feelings, however it is better to talk it over than post for the world to see to be so hurtful and damming towards me.  It would be integrity to remove the review and I will please ask you to do so on my salon's behalf.  Again I am so sorry and never intended for you to feel so insignificant, which I didn't know.\n \nRachael A. \n\nAlicia, I'm not sure what else to say.  Yelp is for people to tell their experience.  You are asking me to not tell my experience because it wasn't a perfect one. I appreciate the follow up. Best of luck in the future.\n \nAlicia B.\nOwner \n\nI'm not asking because it wasn't a perfect one.  I'm asking because it's so daming .  I would have appreciated a phone call or a letter communicating to me directly instead of the internet.  Your experience was what was happened about your feelings, and she had me come to you  because you were so angry and obviously very upset and came and got me.  I stated \" maybe it would be better to communicate what you want instead of what you don't want.\"  It was a suggestion and not intended to be belittling.  I simply made a suggestion and was taken the wrong way.  I am again so sorry that she did not listen to you and that what I suggested seemed so belittling to you.  We were both wrong for not listening more attentively and second for making a suggestion.  She heard something different from you. That's why I suggested it.  So if you feel this is right to tell your experience then so be it.  I am very sorry.\n \nRachael A.\n\nThank you for the apology. It is certainly appreciated.", "business_id": "fRlXdqjH-7Xaxmrcb7ugwQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-11-12", "type": "review"}

We shared a 1/2 pitcher of sangria which was pretty tasty. Their tapas portions are pretty generous and we completely over-ordered. Here's what we got: \n\nCalypso Chips: plantain chips with black bean dip. I love plantain chips and the black bean dip was very flavorful. I nearly attacked the waiter when my boyfriend told him it was okay to take the left over plantain chips from our table.... Never take plantain chips from a hungry girl!\n\nTamal Cubano: A tamale with bits of pork in it. I thought it was good, my boyfriend really liked it. I think I'm spoiled with the homemade tamales my family gets at Christmastime. \n\nFrituras de Camarones: These are exactly like crab cakes, but made out of shrimp. I ordered them because it came with romesco sauce (an amazing sauce made from almonds and roasted red peppers). I slathered the romesco sauce ontop of the cake and squeezed some lime on top. I loved it, but I guess it could have been almost anything doused  in romesco and I would have liked it. \n\nEmpanaditas with shredded beef: Good, but was hoping for a little more flavor. \n\nYuca Frita: I was too full to really eat much of this, but I wanted to try their spicy banana-guava ketchup that came with them. We looked up Yuca (or cassava) and it's defined as a \"woody shrub\". That's kind of what the yuca fries tasted like: kind of dry and woody. The spicy banana-guava ketchup was good though - I'd just guess the sweet potato fries are a better bet. \n\nService was a little slow (our waiter had a huge rowdy table he was helping).

And the avocado dipping sauce had the perfect amount of spice to compliment the fritters.  We also ordered the plantain chips with black bean sauce.  Also wonderful.  The plantain chips came out warm and lightly salted, which worked well with the black bean sauce.  Then we split the Masas de Puerco Fritas - the pork \"morsels\" in a garlic-lime sauce.  The pork was very moist and tender with the right amount of crispness on the exterior.\n\nOf course we had to try dessert too, and split the Carribean Candy Bar - coconut flan with candied coconut, almonds, whipped cream and a drizzle of chocolate sauce.  It was delicious!\n\nOverall, the service and food was wonderful.  We will definitely be back.  My ONLY gripe is the plastic chairs...", "business_id": "8v1MWkAeU3nEuqGd27jZeQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-11-13", "type": "review"}

We eat here at least 1-2 times per month. Very authentic, rarely crowded, and nice servers.\n\nFood: I love the masas de puercos fritas ( fried pork nuggets kinda similar to real carnitas) when I am super hungry and I love the pargo veracruz when I want something lighters. I also love the calypso chips (fried plantain chips).\nOddly enough the bread they serve before the meal is some of the best!\n\nWould highly recommend!", "business_id": "8v1MWkAeU3nEuqGd27jZeQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-11-29", "type": "review"}

What time is Happy Hour on Sunday? How about this; ALL DAY 4-9p!! \nSuch a wonderful waitress that seemed thrilled to be working there and knew the menu in and out. Why? Well because she was Spanish. I haven't been to a Cuban Restaurant before and always assumed Cuban Food was Cuban Sandwiches, well that's Cuban Fast Food. Cuban Cuisine is more like Spanish Food with their own Island Twist! Also very similar to Puerto Rican Food with a slightly different twist as well.\nSome awesome specials on food and drink. We kept it simple with a basic Mojito that was great!!! x3 :-P \nWe ordered some food from the Happy Hour Menu and some of their Tapas off the dinner menu. \nI will list them out for ease of reading. \nSeviche-Basic but good! Loaded with fresh fish and veggies! \nFrituras de Camarones-Think Shrimp Cakes/Patties with a great sauce!\nCalamari Frito-Calamari fried in Almond flour, crispy but not caked in batter, really the best Calamari I've ever had! \nCroquetas de Pollo-Delicious crispy little chicken treats with an awesome sauce\nYuca Frita-Great little Yuca fries with another awesome sauce\nPastelito de Picadillo-Great little puff pastries filled with seasoned ground beef\nAlbondigas-Little tender balls of beef with an incredible brown gravy! \nRepollo Relleno-Cabbage Leaves stuffed with Chicken and veggies covered in a creamy lime sauce! \nMojo de Ajo-Warm Garlicky lime and oil that is great for....Well, EVERYTHING to be dipped in! Great for bread dipping!\n\nJust a fantastic experience for us since we loved Tapas Bars in Chicago and ate our way though Puerto Rico for a Week! We will definitely go back for a Full Dinner as our mouths were watering over their Seafood and Pork dishes! Semi-Local place with a nice Island feel as soon as you walk in the door. Also take a look at their schedule for music and dancing as they clearly like to party it up there and make you feel like you're 2000 miles from Phoenix! :-) \nGreat stuff! Thrilled we found this place. Strangely enough because we were sent to a dive bar next door and saw this and knew we needed to go back. \nTake the previous LOW reviews with a grain of salt. I don't like to insult other people but I will guess they're just not up to speed on what Spanish and Island food are all about. This menu was put together like Pros!", "business_id": "8v1MWkAeU3nEuqGd27jZeQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-09-09", "type": "review"}

I kept seeing groupons for it (which I didn't get), and decided...why the heck not. \n\nVery nice decor, reminded me of some of the places I visited in Florida. Immediately seated, very friendly waitress!\n\nWe started with the 1lb of steamed mussels, which were very tasty! The broth was great for dipping the bread in.  Pretty great price, honestly. \n\nThen...I we shared a cup of the pumpkin soup, which is seasonal. Holy moly was it good. Creamy, pumpkiny, a little spicy. The more you ate, the more you wanted it. I could easily do a whole bowl of that with some bread and call it a night! The waitress said people would call in August for it...but it's only available now, and it goes quickly. I can see why.\n\nI had to be cliche and have the cuban sandwhich, which was very good. Side of black beans and rice with fries, nothing to complain about!\n\nFriend had the Chicharrones de Pollo (fried chicken). Pretty basic friend chicken dish made with masa rather than traditional friend chicken batter. Interesting flavor, very juicy, quite good. \n\nWashed it down with some negro modelos, and we were good to go. \n\nIf I had any con to add, it would be that it was a bit pricey. For most items, if the prices were about 40% cheaper, they would be a better value. But, it is what it is.", "business_id": "8v1MWkAeU3nEuqGd27jZeQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-10-05", "type": "review"}
