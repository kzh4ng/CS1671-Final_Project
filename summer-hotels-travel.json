The good thing is that they have free parking. You have to go through the gate and the receptionist inside will give you a token to leave the parking lot. \n\nTiming is everything. If you go in beginning or end of month then it's generally busier. Saturdays are busier. It turned out I went on a Saturday at the beginning of a month (probably the worst time to go) and waited about 100 mins. The staff who processed my application was pleasant and made the process flow well once it was my turn. \n\nIt also depends what the customers are there for. Renewals take just a few mins whereas new registration and titling take up to 20-30 mins depending how prepared the customer is (i.e. do they have their previous title, insurance papers). Based on # of staff members x 20-30 mins/customer/staff member you can get an idea of what your wait time will be. I did not see a staff member process more than 3-4 applications per hour.\n\nI went in for a new title & registration and the process took about 25 mins as I was fully prepared with all the right paperwork. One thing that the AAA people will do here is go to your parked vehicle in the parking lot and physically verify the VIN on your vehicle (so no need to trace your VIN or go to a notary to get a picture of VIN notarized or anything).", "business_id": "-raHHPz6kBnQgBH-oCuDFA", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-08-01", "type": "review"}

The tiny and I mean very small bar, with three tiny tables and three bar stools is big on properly made drinks. \n\nI sat at a stool which isn't high enough for the bar which made for a rather uncomfortable seating. My friend Katrina has known the lone bartender, Nikki for years and has been wanting to get me out of my comfort zone and try new places. I beat Katrina to the Priory and found a lot of free parking out front (after 7 pm street parking is free) and went inside. \n\nNow situated, I sat down and looked over the menu and decided on a Monktini, citron absolute, fresh lime juice and razzmatazz. Perfect for a warm summer night, not heavy or filling, a little sweet, a little tart. Refreshing! After Katrina arrived another couple walked in and sat at one of the small cafe tables, the tiny room induces conversation with others, especially when the bartender introduces you to everyone. \n\nTime for a bite and this is where Monk's Bar lost a star (the uncomfortably high bar and low stools cost them a star as well) but as a practicing vegan, there were no options I could enjoy. Sandwiches are served on pretzel buns (monks invented pretzels) with options like a ham and turkey club, turkey, creamy chicken salad, and a few others I forgot. I did order hummus but it wasn't filling at all. I did enjoy the house made Lemoncello, although I have made this in the past, Monk's makes there's with grain alcohol which I found to be too strong. I'll continue to make mine with 100 proof vodka and forgo the impending hiccups. \n\nIt was a very interesting night, made new friends, found an interesting new spot and a really cool building I'd love to explore more of.

When the concert was over, we called the hotel and within about 15 minutes the bus arrived to take us back.  Really great service.\n\nThere isn't much around the hotel, unless you like dead shopping malls.  Parking is plentiful right in front of the hotel, though shared with an office building.

Check the reviews folks (I sure wish I had) and you'll see that this place has been under construction for at least four years!\nMy family, and I'm sure countless others, initially had trouble even finding the place and had to humble ourselves to ask directions at the nearby Doubletree Hotel. But even with directions, we drove right past the Clarion because: 1). There are no hotel signs; 2). We were arriving at night and the building was completely dark; 3). There were no parked cars visible from the road; and 4). The entire front of the building was boarded up.\nWhen we located the correct driveway and approached the construction zone, which once represented the entrance to the hotel, we saw a tiny sign directing us to the \"Temporary Lobby\" in the back of the hotel. The makeshift lobby consisted of a hotel room with a clerk sitting at a desk. The clerk initially could not locate our reservation on her computer, but found it as soon I had dug through my luggage to find a copy of the confirmation email.\nWe were given a room on the second floor, thus we walked past stairwells that were closed (because of endlessly drying 'wet paint') and an out-of-order (and leaking) ice machine, until we located the elevator. Well, let me tell you folks, Disney's Tower of Terror ride is less frightening than this elevator. It looked like one of those service elevators that the public never sees. The floor was covered in dead bugs and the ceiling had holes in it, leading to the conclusion that someone must have taken the globes off the ceiling lights and just dumped the dead bugs onto the floor.\nWhen we got to our room, the carpet was so covered with nasty grease stains that we wanted to keep our shoes on. We did the preliminary check of the beds and found some stained sheets, but thankfully no bugs. We also checked for the free Wi-Fi signal and found that it was completely useless (maybe that's why the desk clerk couldn't locate our reservation).\nFinding the complimentary breakfast in the morning was like a scavenger hunt, where you look for clues on small paper signs in the hallways. The adventure actually took me outside of the hotel and then back into another part of the building (thankfully it wasn't raining like it had been all night). I then realized that I had just entered the main construction zone and the outside route must be the only passable route to the dining area.\nThere was yet another sign outside the dining room which said something about Complementary Breakfast and the strange phrase \"Gratuity Included.\" But inside the dining room there were at least two clearly-marked 'Tip Jars.' Now, I've been at some pretty trashy hotels in my travels, but I've never seen a tip jar in the dining room. I've also never been in a hotel dining room where it looked like a bomb had gone off, but there were drop cloths, power tools and all sorts of debris everywhere.\nWhen I got in line for the grub, I learned how the attendant earned her tips: she was there to help patrons identify the food. The person in front of me inquired about the gray-looking sausage-like links and was dutifully informed that they represented turkey sausage, adding, \"Because Clarion cares about your health.\" I'm not kidding (who could make something like that up?). Anyway, I tried this so-called health food, because the only other hot alternative was French Toast and I did not want any syrupy food that morning. Guess what? The sausage had some kind of sugary additive to make the links taste like syrup! Real healthy, right? Thus, I ended up just getting a cup of coffee and returning to my room to pack up. The coffee was okay, by the way.\nIn conclusion, I would not have stayed at the Greentree Clarion had I not made prior reservations and had not been coming back after midnight following a music festival where it rained all day. Plus, we used our loyalty points for this room, so I couldn't even request a discount.\nBelieve me, HUD would shut this place down if it was an apartment building and the Dept. of Homeland Security would never even consider housing immigrants there. But, of course, you and I are welcome to pay upwards of a hundred bucks a night to stay there.", "business_id": "Ml6Up5SH9GbJQ8oyIJsj_g", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-07-31", "type": "review"}

Instead of running school buses, the school district gave high schoolers bus passes to get to class, and I have used the bus since 1997.\n\nI've had a great experience using the bus in Pittsburgh. I didn't get a driver's license until I was almost 19--the bus (\"Miss Pat\"--another nickname) and my bike got me everywhere I needed to go. There will inevitably be delays and problems, but that is common to all modes of transportation. The price is right (especially with a \"free\" bus pass; students see below) and if you live and work in the city, you should consider making the bus your main means of commuting.\n\nThe system is largely built on the legacy of pre-World War II trolley lines, so the neighborhoods that were developed before 1950 are fairly well-served, while more recent developments can be harder to navigate by bus. The system just had a major overhaul (in spring 2010) but still travel many of the same routes.\n\nThe route numbering system is complicated, and there are many exceptions, but as a rule, the routes are numbered in a counter-clockwise fashion from downtown. The \"oughts\" and 10's go north, the 20's and 30's go west, the 40's and 50's go south, and the 60's, 70's, 80's an 90's go east. Routes that are just letters are express or flyer routes, which may go on one of three \"busways,\" transit-only highways that bypass traffic jams. The light rail (known as the \"T\" or the trolley) serves southern city and suburban neighborhoods above ground, and has three underground stations downtown, with a major construction project underway to extend trains to the North Side, projected for completion in 2011.\n\nThe University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University (among others) have agreements with the Port Authority to allow students, staff and faculty to use their university IDs as bus passes. Others can purchase passes at $75 per month or $20 per week, while a local one-way fare is $2.00. Port Authority is supposed to be rolling out a \"smart card\" digital payment system (\u00e0 la WMATA's SmarTrip or London's Oyster) soon, but that remains in development.\n\nOne especially great value is the 28X, a route serving the Pittsburgh International Airport from Downtown and Oakland (the university district) via the West Busway. Fare, as of mid-2010, is $2.75, compared with taxis and other shuttles costing $30 or more. The 28X runs every half hour and takes around 35 minutes to get to the airport from downtown, or 15 minutes longer from Oakland.\n\nThe Port Authority's fare revenues cover only a fraction of its expenses, and the state and county's perennial budget problems have caused several funding crises in recent years.", "business_id": "1n0n_-Iz0e3iVpH8sereiA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-07-12", "type": "review"}

I went to the University of Pittsburgh for SLI: Summer Language Institute from '05-'07. The university, in an effort to accommodate out-of-state students as much as possible, provided \"free\" bus passes (these were factored into your cost of attending). With my full scholarship and pass, I had every intention of keeping this trip on the cheap by walking everywhere I could and using public trans for everything else.\n\nMy first experience with the Port Authority was taking the 28X Airport Flyer from the International Airport to the Oakland campus, which is roughly 20 miles away. The bus runs from 5:20am to 1:01am every day of the week. The opposite direction is just as convenient and starts at 4:25am with last pickup at 11:51pm. The trip takes about an hour and there are buses every 30 minutes or so. The drive is very scenic and gives you a good feel for all that Pitt has to offer.\n\nThroughout the week students of Serbian, Russian and Bulgarian came together and went on little excursions to pass the free time. The major super market in the area is Giant Eagle (\"Jynt Igel\", if you want to get local). There was one within walking distance of campus, but it was much more of an adventure to take the 61A, 61C or 61D to Squirrel Hill (\"Skvirel\", if you want to get Slavic with it) and shop there. We also preferred this since the main street is lined with Greek, Russian and Jewish stores and restaurants. There is also a good number of family owned arts and crafts shops, handmade goods stores and other small businesses.\n\nIf we were feeling like we really wanted a change of scenery, we'd ride the 61C or 61D farther down SW and cross the Allegheny to Homestead, PA. There is a large shopping center with all the luxuries of corporate America from AMC Loews Waterfront 22 and Target to Chick-Fil-A and Dave & Busters. The distance is only 6 miles, but it always took forever and a day. You're looking at 45 minutes in perfect traffic conditions.\n\nAnother shopping option was the Southside Riverfront. It was a mere 3 mile ride and could be accessed by hopping on the 75 or 54. We rode it many times to visit H&M for cheap clothing and REI to get travel essentials (many students end up going abroad through their respective language programs). This area was also the place to be on weekends and has a number of eateries and dive bars.\n\nOne little known fact about SLI is that you are not saved by the bell. When class is over you are still a student of the linguistic arts and expected to practice as much as possible. This includes lunches with your professors and peers, dinner dates with other students, and cultural excursions. The American Serbian Club was considered the mecca of the language students, regardless of which language they were studying. It is also located in South Side, so the 75 or 54 will get you within blocks of its doorstep. Both run pretty frequently, all day and all night.\n\nBut my absolutely best memory of the Port Authority has to be my first day back in Pittsburgh in 2006. I had decided to skip staying in the dorms and opted to go even cheaper by renting an apartment nearby. I had just arrived and was getting to know my roommates. We went for a walk around campus and ended up somewhere just NW of the school. It started to downpour and as we were scurrying for cover, a little shuttle bus driver pulled over and offered us a ride. We asked him where he was headed and in perfect Pittsburghese he replied, \"Wherever yinz is a goin'.\"", "business_id": "1n0n_-Iz0e3iVpH8sereiA", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-06-02", "type": "review"}

Living in Oakland, PAT offers buses to many places I need to go (downtown, the grocery store, the airport, etc.). As a PITT employee, the price (free) is right.\n\nHaving said this, I have several gripes:\n\n1.) Buses almost never run on time, and there's no way to know when the next one is coming other than asking the other people at the bus stop how long they've been waiting. Come on, it's 2014--a GPS-enabled device should be in every bus so you can check to see where it is, or there should be a SMS alert system.  Singapore had this for their buses in 2010!\n\n2.) Some drivers can be surly or just downright ignorant. More than once, a bus has passed me when waiting at a stop for no apparent reason, or has failed to hold on for 5-10 s. as I huffed and puffed to catch it. For whatever reason, the outbound 28X seems to be especially problematic.  True story: Last time I rode it, the driver didn't know where she was going, and we ended up crossing the Liberty Bridge, despite pax telling her this wasn't the route. To make matters worse, this was the last 28X of the night, so due to this detour, I didn't get home until after 1am.\n\n3.) Regardless of which route you ride, the clientele can be a bit sketch. Some drivers will also let homeless people ride without paying/a voucher out of pity. On one occasion, a pax regaled the bus with nonsensical poetry (not sure if he was under the influence or just mentally incapacitated...), and the driver did nada about it (though it was amusing).\n\n4.) The system of when to pay is nonsensical.  Despite having a terminal degree and having lived in PGH for 3 years, I still haven't figured it out, and have to rely on cues from the bus driver. While I understand the reason behind it (the free zone downtown), there must be a less confusing solution.  Get on it!\n\n5.) For those who don't have a PITT or CMU pass, fares--including monthly passes--are expensive ($2.50 per trip). Pro Tip: For a round trip, when you pay for the first leg, ask for a transfer and use it on the second leg--this shaves $1.50 off your fare.\n\n6.) Even in Oakland, where route options are better than in most areas of the city, there are no direct buses to some areas I'd like to visit (e.g., the Strip). Also, other than the P1 from downtown, buses serving the East Busway only run during rush hour on weekdays, and even the P1 only runs hourly off rush hour.\n\nI've ridden public transit in other cities, and for its size, PGH should have a better system and lower fares.  For starters, the T (light rail) should be expanded to run east-west along the busways, given that it's currently a line to nowhere.", "business_id": "1n0n_-Iz0e3iVpH8sereiA", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-07-12", "type": "review"}

I was able to leave my vehicle PARKED right in front of the hotel for nearly 2 hours while I sorted it out. The valet staff and front desk staff as well were VERY helpful in allowing me the time I needed to sort out my travel disaster,  extending every courtesy in the process. In particular, Jean Stefan was the most helpful. My booking agent made a transcription error shortening my stay - and that mistake was quickly corrected by Jean.\n\nFrom the super high ceilings in the room, along with the much larger than usual sq/ft of both the room and bathroom, I will not choose to stay at any other downtown Pittsburgh hotel. The \"courtyard\" is lovely, well decorated, and amazingly comfortable on summer evenings. The proximity to the convention facilities next door are MORE convenient than the Westin, which is directly attached to DLCC - but actually a much longer walk (to get to DLCC Hall B anyway).\n\nMy only suggestion to improve the guest experience: leave the courtyard open until midnight (or even better, never closed) instead of 10:30pm - and simply warn loud guests that the courtyard will be closed early if they can not keep it quiet.\n\nKudos to the staff, for making my third stay the best one yet.", "business_id": "uILvDDCgw63_KJsZMO9GvA", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-08-18", "type": "review"}

I rode the Capitol Ltd. to DC this past Feb.  The biggest drawbacks of this train are the inconvenience of the arrival and departure times (PGH is in the middle of the route, which terminates in Chicago) and its tendency to be late.  When I rode the Capitol Ltd., the worst part of the experience was its 5 hr. late arrival (10:30am)--I thought this train would never show up, but thank goodness, it finally did.  Once we were on the train itself, it was good times. Since this is a long-distance train, it's a double decker and includes a dining car and lounge car.  For the majority of the trip, I hung out in the lounge car and enjoyed the scenery, which was very pretty for most of the way.  I also had lunch in the diner, and was pleased with the quality of the food (I had a chicken salad with fruit) and service.  I found the seats, both in coach and in the lounge, fairly comfortable and the temperature acceptable.  The diner and lounge also offer a great opportunity to mingle and chat, which I took advantage of, having conversations with several interesting people.\n\nI've ridden the Pennsylvanian to Philly on several occasions to visit my family, who live in DE.  Although I used to ride Megabus, the Pennsylvanian is now my preferred method of transportation to do so.  The seats are much more spread out and comfortable than the seats on the Megabus (and you can actually get up and walk around!), the ride is extremely scenic, esp. west of Harrisburg, the wifi is pretty reliable (although it's only available in the vicinity of the cafe car) and, in my experience, the crews are much friendlier than the Megabus drivers. Also, although one of my bags is slightly over the allowable dimensions stated on the website, none of the crew members have ever complained, though the Megabus crews have given me trouble even though this bag is *under* their stated dimensions!  The biggest drawbacks are that there's only one departure time (7:30am, earlier than I'd like, personally), and the fare price ($110, round trip). In addition to these, the temperature of the cars has been quite frigid on several occasions, so be sure to dress in layers or bring a blanket. I also recommend bringing snacks, since the offerings in the cafe car are limited and pricy.  *Pro tip: The eastbound Pennsylvanian stops in Harrisburg at around 12:45pm for 15 min. for a smoke break, at which time it's possible to disembark from the train and buy lunch at the snack shop in the station, which has much more variety and is much more reasonably priced than the cafe car. *That is, if it's on time--if it's running late, all bets are off.  The clientele is also more varied and generally a bit classier than the clientele of the Megabus (though I did get stuck between some rednecks on my last trip--I spent most of the time west of Harrisburg in the cafe car avoiding them).  Although fares are more expensive than Megabus (by about $20-$30 round trip) and the trip is slightly longer due to more stopping, I don't mind paying more to have a more enjoyable experience, given that it's a long trip no matter which mode of transportation you take!\n\nAs for the PGH Amtrak station itself, it's not much to see, consisting of one room with no windows, a ticket counter, some bathrooms, and a TV (usually tuned to CNN).  I recommend getting there 15-20 min. prior to departure time--just enough time to comfortably catch your train without becoming bored. However, if you're on the Capitol Ltd. and it's running late, you may get stuck here for awhile, so be prepared and bring some entertainment! 3.5 stars.", "business_id": "2bBxE8pEbLBETejCi_aBeg", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-07-06", "type": "review"}

I love the idea of staying in an overpriced hotel at a discount rather than emptying my wallet for the privilege of hanging out in the penthouse suite.\nUpon arrival at the Renaissance, I was greeted by one of the front desk staff...let's call him \"Mr. R.\" I asked him for a nice room with a view. He chimed, \"no problem.\" That was, until he called up my reservation which indicated that I had booked from another vendor.

Now, I was livin' large!\nAll kidding aside, the staff was friendly, professional, and attentive. I had forgotten some of my toiletries at home. They had them up to my room in no time at all.\nThe lobby is grand but a little confused in style. It is a combination of old time tile and marble with seventies disco-bordello, dark, red lighting. \nThe last night we were there we watched a stunning fireworks display from our room after the B-ball game at PNC. It really capped off a nice weekend in Pittsburgh.\nSo, Mr. R. came through for us after all and I have to admit that it was a 100 times better than the hotel room in New York City where I had a lovely view of the air shaft!", "business_id": "A38wziZJdYoijhC5S6uWCQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-07-24", "type": "review"}

We already had dinner reservations and show tickets, we just had to find a hotel room. The Renaissance Hotel is literally next door to the Byham Theatre where we had show tickets. I walked in and there was a wedding on the iconic stairs in the foyer! It was so beautiful with guests not only seated on the lobby space but also in the balconies on the second floor. I came in just as the ceremony was finishing. and when they were pronounced husband and wife, those in the balcony threw flower petals upon the couple. The hotel handled those like myself who were not part of the wedding very professionally so the ceremony would not be disturbed, but still service incoming guests. \n\nCheck in was very swift as my husband went to the restaurant to meet our dinner reservation while I checked into the hotel. I was able to take the luggage to the room and return to the restaurant a couple blocks away without even being late. I really liked the makeup mirror since I have to take off my glasses to apply my makeup.\n\nWe had dinner and enjoyed our show. We got out of the show and went to the bar for a late night bite and a drink. We got there at 10:45pm and waited and waited. At 11:04, a blonde waitress finally came to our table after delivering food to another table. We asked to see a menu, but was informed that the kitchen had closed at 11pm. We finished the drinks we had ordered, but had to pay the bartender because the waitress had left for the night. The bartender was a gentleman as I had two bills stuck together when I paid him and he found us outside to return the other one. We had to go across the street to another establishment to get something to eat.\n\nOther than the snafu in the bar, all the staff from check in to check out were very nice and professional. The room was very clean and comfortable. As the need comes up, I will probably choose this hotel when I need to stay Downtown again. It is so close to PNC Park across the Clemente Bridge and it is in the heart of the Cultural District, so all the theaters are very close by.

The Renaissance is a beautiful hotel in an ideal location of Pittsburg. I was in hotel heaven when I walked into the lobby. It looked expensive and well taken care of. The customer service at check in was spot on. Laura (Lori?) was incredibly friendly and seemed genuinely happy we had chosen the Renaissance for our stay. She saw we booked our hotel through Priceline, and that didn't even affect her demeanor. She asked us a few questions about why we were in town and made me feel like I picked the right place to stay at. She then informed my husband and me that she happened to have a complimentary upgrade to a corner junior suite available. I didn't even ask, which is what made this even more wonderful. She confidently told us that we would love the room. \n\nWow! That room was insanely amazing. Laura was right! Panoramic views of the city, river, bridges and two stadiums. I felt so special having this upgrade and couldn't have asked for a better room. It was great watching the sunset with the option of looking out of any of the 7 windows in the room. The room d\u00e9cor was classy, modern and the bed was super comfy. I made sure to let Laura know that this really exceeded our expectations. \n\nThe reason my experience wasn't five stars was because of the room service. Ever since I was little, I have loved to order room service. It's just something I have to do. My first call in to room service was for a bottle of wine. I was quoted a 30 minute wait, which was reasonable to me. It took about 20 minutes, which I was pleased about. I signed my bill and added my tip. When the gentleman left, I was looking over my bill and thought it seemed really high. I completely didn't realize that a 20% gratuity was already included on top of the room service fee. I had tipped him $5 already, so he made out with $10 in tips. I felt really silly after that and tried to justify in my head why spending $43 on a $27 order was okay. My husband made me feel better by saying it is vacation, don't stress about it. \n\nThe next morning I really was craving a croissant and a beverage. I asked if they had croissants a la carte, which they did. The gal said she could have my order in 15 minutes, but probably less. Wow, that's great, I thought. However, don't overpromise and under deliver. If you are going to claim it will be 15 minutes or less, then I am expecting that. After 30 minutes of waiting, I finally called only to hear the lady tell me my food was on the way. When it arrived, it was the saddest looking croissants I've ever seen. They gave me two mini, stale croissants. I took a picture and couldn't stop laughing about how tiny they were. They obviously were not fresh either.", "business_id": "A38wziZJdYoijhC5S6uWCQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-08-12", "type": "review"}

Seems like a hotel of a bygone era.\n\nBut...\n\nValet is a mess.  Located on a two lane street with no pull-off, one must be lucky or patient to be able to pull up to the curb.  We came in on a busy Friday, but I knew it would be busy (it's a summer weekend) so why are there not more valets?\n\nAs I returned both Friday and Saturday.  I had to park the car, exit and stand there, waiting for someone to take my keys.   Friday it was about five minutes. I had to make sure I locked it myself, since the valet simply came and took my keys and stuck them on the rack.  I had to point my car to him.  Didn't really trust what was happening among the chaos.  \n\n\nSaturday upon return.  There was no valet in sight.  I parked, exited, waited.. and waited and waited.  Finally a guy comes running across the street and nearly snatched the keys from my hand, as if I was keeping HIM from taking MY keys.  \n\nCheck-in: I mingled in with a wedding party and other weekenders.  Again, a busy weekend (summer weekend and a wedding and Pirates in town) yet only two desks are working for check-in (the third was off with the wedding planner).  Took about 15 minutes to get to the desk and two minute check-in.   I understand the big wedding, but we're paying guests, too.\n\nThe room was huge.  King bed, nice sized bathroom.  But very very cold.  No matter the setting, it remained freezing.\n\nIf you request a river view be prepared and forewarned.  We were neither.  River view means stadium view and with a game going on, means lights, noise from departing crowed and that loud obnoxious so-called music from the plastic bucket-banging guy, the pirate Santa and some other keyboard playing dude, all trying to get a few bucks from the departing crowd... until well after 11 PM.\n\nYes, for some 11 is not late.  However, we rise with the sun for work during the week, so we do the same all weekend.  \n\nDid I mention the noise from the ballroom right below us?  Party Friday night, wedding reception Saturday night.  At least Friday, the noise abated about 9 PM.  Saturday it's 10:32 and the party still thumping right below us.  (picture that annoying bass thumping car that you drive by, but instead it cruises right with you ... all night.)\nCouldn't really enjoy watching a movie, reading has been a challenge.\n\nCalled desk manager who said the party was supposed to have ended at 10 P.M. and he was going to check on it.  Thirty minutes later, nothing.  He said he'd \"adjust our rate.\"  He said he didn't understand our room placement and blamed \"being busy\" as a reason we were stuck in this room.  \n\nI understand there's an expected level of noise and light in a city, but had there been any indication of such, I'd have been sure to request a room on a higher floor and away from the river.  No notes on the room selection and not even a mention at check-in.  I guess being sold out, some guests get screwed.  Of course, by the time we figure it out, we can't request another room since we're in bed already and the hotel seems sold out soooo....\n\nOh that wedding?  In the main lobby Saturday afternoon.  So that beautiful lobby that might have been a joy to sit in and read and enjoy a coffee?  Off limits.  \n\nMostly, I\"m annoyed by room selection.  A peaceful relaxing stay it isn't.    For the rate we are paying, I expected a much more comfortable and relaxing stay.  \n\nI will not stay here again. \n\nBeware and be warned.\n\nUpdate 8/29/15:  the reception ended at 11 P.M.

The hotel was very nice all around.  Efficient , friendly staff and genuinely hospitable.  The rooms were in good condition and well-maintained.  \n\nSo were looking forward to returning for a woodworking symposium at the Lawrence Convention Center.\n\nI'd say lots was the same but some of the changes were irritating and so to be fair, the negatives first (ending on a high note).\n\nFor the game, a room. For this time, we had a King suite.  19th floor.  View okay but not great as advertised but hey, you're not there to sit in the hotel all day, right? :-)\n\nWell I had booked a corner suite but there was a bit of an issue with my profile on SPG and so they were \"de-feathering\" the room and it was taking forever. So I said, another corner suite was fine.  Except it wasn't.  It was a suite alright, but in the living area where one would expect a sofa, sitting area and TV, etc?  There sat a 4 top dining table with a hole in the middle. Turns out that lots of business travelers like this arrangement for meetings and all the suites below the 11th floor have this.  \n\nSO LOOK OUT before you book, people!  :-)\n\nBut seriously it wasn't a huge deal as they were more than happy to move me. And they did - to a complimentary upgrade King Suite that you could a tech startup in.  Very spacious, with dual closets, very nice sitting area with couch and two comfy chairs, two huge picture windows about the size of patio sliders.  A vanity area outside the (smallish) bathroom.\n\nAbout that bathroom. A couple things bug me when I travel.  One, is that some downtown hotels don't have a fan/vent in the bathroom, and so the mirror fogs up big time.  Not a huge deal and I use the hair dryer so I can see, but really? can't they do something?\n\nThe other thing is this:  I hate rain shower heads. I'm an old dude, I like my water pressure, not a rain forest gently wafting over me. I want velocity!  Hit me with that H20!  And yes, I know that we need to conserve water, but I have a seriously great low flow shower head at home and it cost 20 bucks on Amazon.  Sheesh!\n\nAnother gripe:  There were exactly two places to recharge a device in the entire suite, and both were at a side table about 12 feet from the bed (and only halfway across the room)!\n\nNow, between us we have 5 devices to charge including phones. I use mine for my alarm and like it right there.  So really, can't we have a retrofit so grown folk can charge their whatsits?\n\n\nFinally, the elevators. What?  How can that be an issue? Well, since our last visit, they installed a software/hardware package that eliminates the buttons inside the elevator. Instead, there is a touch screen at each floor.  One selects the destination, and the screen lights up with a large number telling you which elevator. \n\nWhich SUCKS.  I'm sure they're using some kind of load-management software to optimize elevator use, and I'm sure that the goal is more efficient utilization and less latency.  Well it ain't makin' it.  You wait and wait and wait.  Then sometimes - if you're like me - you forget which elevator you were supposed to take.\n\nI did find that, it seems that if you go press all the screens with your floor and perhaps those above, the software sensed increased demand and sent an elevator quicker.  Hacking an elevator. Who'd a thought it?\n\nNow to the good:\n\nThe staff were super friendly, warm and helpful.  So when I asked, they found a power strip and a 25' orange extension cord and I ran it over to the bed along the wall.  Sort of the Clampetts come to city with my cord running all over the room. Nonetheless, we had power to our devices.\n\nThe room was otherwise nice and quiet.  Did I mention that it was large? \n\nThe hotel restaurants are good. Penn Grille is more relaxed overall and Bill's is more of a \"joint\" but the burgers are great, as are the nachos.  The service in both is excellent and the staff are unfailingly friendly - really hospitable the way we mean it here in the south.\n\nThe hotel is attached to the Lawrence Convention Center, which was nice as it rained some each day. We made it to the various events high and dry.\n\nI would say that the high point of the hotel is without question the attentiveness, courtesy and genuine friendliness of the hotel staff.  Not that fake, I'm polite but really looking down on you courtesy that we've experienced at the Ritz in Chicago (which I reviewed last year).\n\nIn fact, if this hotel was sited next to the Ritz, and the price was the same, I'd choose the Westin, hands down. And given that the rooms were less than half that of the Ritz, that's a good indicator of how well we were treated. \n\nMy wife tipped the housekeeping lady $300 because she was so nice. What else can I tell you?  Stay there.\n\nAnd Pittsburgh, you are an awesome town.

The one with the bad a/c and dirty carpet?  The one with the barely functioning electrical outlets and tiny, almost useless, kitchen?  Well if you ever want to relive that experience, stay at Shadyside Inn Suites!\n\nI spent six years of my medical training in Pittsburgh and found myself with a few days off last month.  Why not take my wife and young son back to my old stomping grounds in Oakland and Shadyside?  We've found that when traveling with a young child, staying at suite-type hotels (with at least some sort of kitchen facilities and a separate bedroom) is very useful.  The most convenient suite-type hotel to Shadyside is the Shadyside Inn Suites.  Unfortunately, since this business has a virtual monopoly on the area, it must believe it can put its clients up in deplorable, nearly unsafe conditions. \n\nThese comments are based on our experience with the building on S. Negley Ave.  I believe there are at least two other buildings the hotel maintains as well as \"Mansion Suites\" which are reserved for VIP's or people staying for very long periods.\n\nGeneral Complaints:\n1.  Exposed electrical and cable wiring (see pics).  We tried to spend as little time as possible in the room because I didn't want our 19 month old to inadvertently touch exposed wires.\n\n2.  Dirt.  Everywhere.  When we were getting ready to leave, I did a quick last run through the room to make sure we weren't leaving any of my sons toys behind.  I made the mistake of peeking underneath the couch.  Yuck.  Food remnants, dirt and debris from who knows how long under there.  Disgusting.\n\n3.  General poor maintenance of the building and its parking lot (see pics.)\n\n4.  The furniture in the rooms looks like it has been there for at least 15 years.  Our dining table was strikingly similar to the one I had in college.\n\n5.  No dishwashers.  Not unexpected given the age of the building.  But if you're not going to give your guests a dishwasher, at least give us sponges so we can wash our own.\n\n6.  When you check in, the hotel bills your credit card for the entire length of the stay ahead of time rather than vice versa (completely the opposite of every other hotel in this country.)  Keep this in mind if you want to leave early after seeing the condition of your room.\n\n7.  Three separate keys are required to get into the building and your room.  Again, completely out of date and not particularly secure.\n\nAlso, the vaunted customer service that they crow about on their website must be limited to special guests and celebrities. \n\n1.  When we asked for an extra blanket to be delivered to our room, we waited for over an hour with no response.  Ultimately, we had to drive back to the main office and retrieve the blanket ourselves.\n\n2.   The remote to the DVD/VCR combo had no batteries in it.  I had to get the AA batteries from the main office (I didn't even bother to attempt to ask them to be delivered to our room) and had to wait while the office staff repeatedly found AAA batteries for me.  I was told the AAA batteries fit the flat screen TV remotes in the rooms.  I had to calmly explain that we did NOT have a flat screen TV in our room, rather we had a non HD CRT TV that was at least 10 years old. \n\n3.  Daily cleaning of the room costs EXTRA.  Be sure to read the fine print.\n\nPerhaps some of its other buildings are more modern and in better condition.  Perhaps we had the worst unit in the entire complex... but I doubt it.\n\nUnless you absolutely have to be within walking distance to a business, client or family in Shadyside do yourself a favor and find a more modern, cleaner, safer and better hotel.  Shadyside Inn Suites should be ashamed of itself for the condition of its facilities.\n\n\n(6/11/10) UPDATE...

Why did they put my family in the oldest, most dilapidated room? \n\nAs far as moving to a different room, any one who has traveled with children would know how difficult  it is to move from one hotel (or hotel room) to another.

I knew we wanted to stay in a \"real\" neighborhood, and most of the new hotels are plopped down among concrete structures and shopping malls... and they're $$$! The Shadyside Inn is a few blocks from Walnut Street, a quaint, upscale block with shopping and restaurants. I wasn't necessarily looking for an all-suites hotel but the added benefits of a full kitchen and free laundry services definitely didn't hurt. And as a bonus, free parking. Sold.\n\nWe called to make sure our room wasn't on the ground floor, and we were assured it wasn't. But when we arrived, all the windows faced the parking lot at the back of the building. We were also a little disappointed at the finishes... it all seemed cheaply renovated and kind of unfinished (the hallways were totally torn up and the apartment didn't quite seem done). We called to try to get another room and were upgraded to a 2-bedroom in the main building. It definitely wasn't super high-end, but this unit seemed at least finished. The hallways and apartment were simple and clean, and we really appreciated some of the antique touches, like the exhaust fans in the kitchen and bathroom.\n\nFrom here on out, everything was great. We loved staying in Shadyside, and having space to spread out. Considering all the other hotels I looked at, this has to be one of the best values in pgh.\n\nOverall, it was a 3 star experience, but I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt that they're still under construction and they'll work out some of the kinks.

The individual rooms, all named for varieties of apple, are spectacular.  We were in the lovely Northern Spy.  The bed was wonderfully comfortable, the linens unbelievably soft and luxurious.  L'Occitane bath products smelled divine.  The Shadyside neighborhood outside of downtown is quiet but still conveniently located to all the Pittsburgh doings.\n\nBreakfast each morning, cooked by the hospitable Chef Jackie, is pure pleasure.  Each night on your pillow a menu card appears; check off what you'd like in the morning, what time you'll be eating, and drop it off in the dining room.  The next day, Jackie is ready and waiting with a fresh fruit plate, the pastry of the day, and fantastically strong and flavorful coffee.  Omelets and fritattas are made with local produce and eggs.  Irish oatmeal is served with milk from a nearby creamery.  Toast bread changes daily but is always whole-grain and delicious.  Breakfast meats are lean and filling.  \n\nAfternoons, iced tea and cookies are set out, and in the evenings wine and cheese served.  Enjoy them in a rocker on the front porch, relaxing on the back deck retreat, or in the privacy of your room.  \n\nStaff is not only eminently professional, but warm and gracious.  Heidi at the front desk was beyond helpful in making suggestions for what to do in the city or where to eat (I will be forever indebted to her for recommending what was probably our best meal of the trip at Soba).

The Sunnyledge owner offered a deal and graciously gave the 4 of us a round of mimosas.  Along with this deal, we had an incredible brunch.\n\nThe 4 of us were sat on the porch, overlooking Fifth which wasn't that loud.  The brunch came with an entree and a buffet.  I love perfectly-sized portions and this one was it.  I had a lobster club sandwich which was great.  The brunch buffet was held in a room in the lobby, which was quaint and small.  Caviar.  Small pastries.  Just the perfect balance of sweet and savory.  Even though the crowd here were a little more upscale and classy (one of the few places that I saw valet parking), I never felt that I was treated any less (I was a poor graduate student with a love of food).\n\nThe only drawback was that the tables and chairs were somewhat cramped.  I had to struggle with getting out of my chair each time to go to the buffet.  But this was a small negative compared to my experience at Sunnyledge.\n\nI hear that Sunnyledge is known for their cocktails as well as their stay.

Biggest mistake of my first 2 years. And yes, I had a fake ID so I could get into most places. \n\nWell, Sunnyledge is kind of a bed and breakfast type lodging but on Fridays from 6-8, they have their happy hour. 1/2 price Martinis. These martinis are unbelievable. They are pretty strong and taste delicious. They have so many different martini's on their menu so just choosing one/two/three/four will take a bit of time to decide each time you re-order.\n\nSo the martini comes in a regular martini glass. Well, you also get the leftover martini mix poured into a small glass container. They put dry ice in your glass before they pour your drink so the drink actually starts to bubble and puff up whisps of smoke which is so cool. There is also a larger piece of dry ice in your glass container which keeps your extra martini cool until you're ready to drink it. \n\nOnce your finished the first glass, you pour what's in the container into your martini glass and voila, it comes out to a second martini. Granted that these martini's are kind of expensive, on half price happy hour, you are pretty much getting 2 martini's for the price of one.\n\nThey also have a free tiny buffet appetizer where they have different things each time. I've had cheese and crackers, bruschetta, cole cuts crackers and cheese, etc..\n\nThe menu isn't too bad either. I had their duck wrap and sliders one time. The fries were different. Not bad. but not exceptional.

Our experience with the Mansions left much to be desired. This place touts themselves as a luxurious experience, but they are truly anything but. The Mansion itself is in disrepair, particularly in the guest rooms.  This is something we did not notice in our initial tour, but were really disappointed once we spent some time there overnight on the weekend (we stayed Friday and Saturday nights).  For how much money the Mansion charges to have your wedding there (about 10K to rent the place for the weekend), we had expected much more care and attention to be dedicated to our wedding. \nThe wedding manager Nicole is ok, but nothing special. She appears helpful but she is not what you would expect as the wedding manager of an upscale wedding venue.  It is clear that this is not her main priority. She calls you about 2 weeks before your event to lecture you on not stealing anything from the mansions (towels, hangers, etc.) and to NOT use the white bath towels to wash your face with.  We are all adults here and paying good money to have our event here- is that really necessary? It seems that those darn black makeup remover towels are where all of their attention is at.  Stick the \"Mansion Rules\" pamphlet in each of the guest rooms and don't read it out loud on the phone to us.  \n   I have brought all of the above to the attention of the Mansions the after our event, and they did not respond for over two weeks. Eventually, they gave us a half-hearted apology and said they are sorry our experience was \"not as we expected\". That's it.  Save your money and have you event somewhere else. I wouldn't even recommend this place to stay at overnight as a B&B. The morning \"B\" (breakfast) left much to be desired- picture fruit flies everywhere, lukewarm coffee and overcooked eggs. Yuck!\nFurthermore, I spoke with the Mansions chef and other general manager who were present the morning after my wedding and they completely agreed with all of the concerns that I brought to their attention.  They told me to email Nicole after the wedding which we did (with no reply for over 2 weeks until a follow-up e-mail was sent). They essentially said that we are certainly not the first patrons to bring these things to their attention, but not much can be done since the owner (Chukky Okabi) is a cheapskate and is running his business into the ground. He hires his friends to do any repairwork/maintenance/housekeeping and it shows. Apparently, this place used to be great several years ago when the first started doing events, but now it is more of a wedding-factory type show. Disappointing because we read so many great wedding reception reviews from 2010-2013 time frame!! \n\nNow on to the \"exclusive vendors\" of the Mansions. The florist, Posy, is a joke.  While Paulette is a sweet lady, she does not know how to run a business and keep track of anything. She completely messed up the centerpieces for our reception and started crying at my wedding when we mentioned they were NOT what we had discussed in our previous meetings. Not professional at all. Also, her husband jammed his phone into my face as my now-husband and I were taking wedding portraits outside the mansions. I asked him who he was and he grunted \"its for posy\".  Totally rude and unprofessional- we were shocked!!  Furthermore, Posy threw away all of our flowers (INCLUDING MY BRIDAL BOUQUET!!!) after our wedding.  We had told Posy that we wanted to keep our flowers, we have contacted her after the wedding but she will not respond to us. We engaged the Mansions for help with contacting her but they won't help us with anything now that our event is over and they are paid.  \n\nYou have to use Big Burrito group as your caterer. Danielle, the catering manager is WONDERFUL. She is extremely helpful and attentive (A++). The food was wonderful, although the \"head waiter\" at our event was rude to my husband and I- we were mingling with guests as we were making our way into the tent for dinner and he approached me and said in a snarky voice, \"Sit down, you are holding up dinner\".  Also, we had asked for BBG to pour wine during our sit-down dinner and they did not.

However, it appeared to me that the money would have been better spent on updating the rooms themselves.

As a nursing mother I was hoping for a fridge in my room, however a pageant taking place at the hotel meant all were taken.  The staff were nice enough to let me keep some things in the employee fridge which I really appreciated.\n\nThe beds are very comfortable so you can get a good night's sleep.\n\nThe food at the main restaurant/bar was decent with very large portions.  In typical southern style, it was covered in sauce(s) but good enough.\n\nThe not so good:  The main picture posted on Yelp (and on SPG.com) leads you to believe the hotel is nicer than it actually is.  The hotel is very average and does not appear to have been significantly updated in the last 10-15 years (except for the beds which were quite nice).\n\nThe website advertising a 24-hour on-demand shuttle, however the on-demand part is only when being picked up from the airport not to be dropped off (which would have been helpful for them to mention at check-in).  There were 3-5 of us that were ready to go at 5:45am (because our flight departed at 6:50am) but were told that we had to wait until 6am because it only leaves on the half hour.  They also would not let us ride with an earlier van that carried crew members and informed us that a taxi would take 15-20 minutes to call.  Overall, seemed frustrating as to why they could not have a van make a trip to the airport when there are 5 people waiting to go.\n\nI'm not sure if this is an SPG systematic problem or not, but the hotel charged me for internet on my bill and I had to ask to have it taken off (since I'm a platinum member).

I always coordinated with Kandace Stafford in events, who is on the ball and will make sure you are well taken care of.", "business_id": "zwwmnQXk8jhFs4wwU8I4Ow", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-07-27", "type": "review"}

The shower pressure was adequate, but there is no place in the shower to put your shampoo, soap, washcloth, etc.  That's just dumb.  Toilet paper sconce is behind you and a pain to reach.  An overall bad layout, design, and decor in the bathroom.\n\nThe room is very dark with just some dim lamps scattered around the room.  There is a desk, but its shape makes it painful to sit at (there was a wooden part jabbing into my legs) and you have to unplug something if you want to plug in a computer, a short sighted setup on their part.  Because I was here for work I was too busy to eat their breakfast or spend any time at the bar, but I did need to get some stuff done in the room and the above features made that difficult and unpleasant.  \n\nAlso, you have to park in a public lot behind the hotel and get your ticket validated by the staff to not pay there, but you still pay Dunhill $12 per day for the parking.  Not convenient, and one time I forgot to get the thing validated and therefore ended up paying more than just paying the garage itself.  Bad system there too.\n\nBut overall the bed was comfortable and the room was quiet and getting around is easy.

For some, it might seem too 'far' from downtown (3 blocks), but for me it's in great location. Walk to everything, including the Stadium, Convention Center, Downtown, and the Epicenter. \n\nService is great - I would expect it! It's the Westin! From the time you get out of a scorching hot taxi (even with air conditioning on) up until the time you leave at 6 in the morning 3 days later. I haven't experience a single hiccup (except a spider in my bathtub that scared the hell out of me one night). \n\nAmenities are great:\n\nRoom - 4 stars. Last time I was here, I got a room with a great walking shower bathroom. This time, it was the regular small bathroom. Last time, my friend managed to get a room with a treadmill (yes, they exist!), this time they were all sold out. I got stuck on the 6th floor, she got stuck on the fourth floor. This was an upgrade for me, as last time I was on the 4th floor as well. Ok, enough bitching. The rooms are great. Beds are called heavenly for a reason and all the condiments and towels and sheets are so fresh you feel energized be mere being in the room. Air Conditioning is a bit loud so either turn if off for the night or bring ear plugs.\n\nGym - 5 stars. From the variety of the workout options to the gym facilities - everything screams class. Perfectomundo! Individual TV screens for every machine (bike, elliptical, treadmill) help time pass by while working out and watching \"True Blood\" on HBO. Hmmm. Plenty of channels to choose from, though. Sauna, showers, and the locker room are squeaky clean with plenty of extra shampoo, lotion and mouth wash.\n\nPool - 3 stars. Even though this is a great big lap pool, it's too shallow - only 3  1/2 feet deep. I understand that they don't want kids to drown there if unattended, but come on, waist-deep pool is not very appealing to me.\n\nEmber Grill - 4 stars. I have only been here for breakfast - I can't complain, except for the prices. $18 for breakfast is a little steep. However, you can eat all you want from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. and nobody will kick you out (not that I have done that, I swear!).\n\nBusiness Center - 1 star. Ok, what they call a business center is actually a 50 square foot room with 3 workstations, a printer and a fax machine. Internet is pay-per-minute, except to check in on your airline's website and print the boarding pass (which was actually all I needed from the Business Center). However, for travelers who actually need a business center - better bring the laptop and stay in your room with $12.95/day internet service.\n\nAirport Transportation - 5 stars. Checking out at 4 a.m.? Take advantage of the flat rate towncar that will take you directly to the airport. Air-conditioned bliss!\n\nOk, let's summarize: I would give this hotel a solid 4 stars and would definitely stay here again.

This still seems expensive, but it was a popular weekend so we didn't shop around much more.\n\nThe wait for the elevators was ridiculous! I guess that there's not much that can be done about such a thing, but waiting for 10 minutes at a time because every elevator that stops is FULL TO THE BRIM with people was annoying. At once point, my husband took the stairs back to our room WHICH WAS ON THE ELEVENTH FLOOR after visiting the Starbucks in the lobby. Oh, and it's not a full Starbucks so they didn't even have iced coffee...???\n\nThe room was nice- we were on the end of a hallway, which I had heard was good because of the views and tons of windows. There were a ton of windows, but they overlooked construction and highways. Meh. The shower/bathtub situation was pretty awesome, also with tons of windows (there were shades, if you wished to pull them down!). There seemed to be no fan in the bathroom, though, which surprised me. \n\nAlso, there was a burnt out bulb in the bathroom, right near the magnifying mirror; when we called down to the front desk to have it replaced they said it would take them a while...and it did. Also, this is a small thing, but they put lotion in the shower instead of shampoo (next to the conditioner). So I washed my hair with lotion. Yeah.\n\nWe visited the bar on Saturday night between 10 and 11 and it was insane. It took us 40 minutes to get a drink, which we expected, but people behind us were being served first! I guess that's our fault for not being savvy enough to know how to get served in bars? Also, one bartender with red curly hair was making drinks kind of ridiculously- packing more ice in when she ran out of something and choosing things at random to pour in the glasses. We were glad the the person who finally served us (our overpriced cocktails) seemed to be measuring a little more carefully.\n\nA few more details: Parking is $18 and they bill it to your room; pretty standard for a downtown Charlotte hotel, but not exactly a welcome charge on your bill. The pool is inside. Someone on Yelp said that there is a rooftop bar at the Westin, but they must have gotten rid of it because we were told there was no such thing when we asked.\n\nIn conclusion, I think I prefer the Courtyard Marriot a few blocks over, on Tryon.

Westin hotels are also known for their comfortable beds though I personally do not notice much of a difference compared to Marriotts.  The Westin in Downtown Charlotte definitely delivered on Westin's contemporary image and comfortable rooms.\n\nThe rooms are not incredibly modern, but they are contemporary and have a simple and good neutral color scheme.  The design is definitely a notch above a lot of Marriotts that often feature an unappealing color scheme and ugly carpets.  The bed at this Westin was comfortable--excellent linen too and a comfortable room temperature.  The bathroom had a great look and featured a rainfall showerhead.  While I do not have status with Starwood, I did like the nice touch of two complimentary bottles of water with each night (it seems every Starwood member, even non-elite members, enjoy this benefit).\n\nThis Westin also has a great location.  It is right on College, which leads to several Downtown Charlotte restaurants and even some of Charlotte's nightlife like a dance club and a dueling piano bar.  This Westin is also within walking distance to several key Charlotte attractions including a minor league baseball stadium, the Carolina Panthers (NFL) stadium, the Charlotte Bobcats (NBA) arena, and the NASCAR Hall of Fame.\n\nThe fitness center was big and had several machines.\n\nThe lobby was nice too.  It was spacious and there were several sitting areas if you are waiting for someone.\n\nI tried a little bit of their catering for a nightly event in their restaurant as well as in one of their banquet rooms for breakfast.  The food was definitely subpar for a Westin.  A lot of it was due to poor preparation and the effects of having buffet style food as the scrambled eggs were not that fluffy, the waffles were very soft and the flatbread was limp (it had definitely been sitting around for too long).\n\nService throughout the hotel was friendly though I felt that housekeeping was a tad slow to service my room on some days.\n\nPrices are high, but the hotel is nice and the location is very convenient.\n\nFor travelers looking to explore Downtown Charlotte, this Westin is a great option.  The rooms are nice and the location is near perfect.  Downtown Charlotte is not my favorite downtown city.  It is a tad sleepy though not as quiet as Phoenix or as small as San Jose.

First off, I was staying here for a conference and had requested a higher floor room, but was given a 4th floor room - which is the lowest floor for rooms. I had also requested a King size bed since my wife was travelling with me, but we were given two double beds. In addition to not being able to sleep with my wife during the stay, I couldn't even fit comfortably on the bed (I'm 6' 4\" so I always get a King bed). But I usually don't make a fuss about these kind of things when I'm at conference because I'm not paying for it anyway. The room itself was just okay - nothing wrong with it, but perhaps the most underwhelming room I've ever had at a supposedly luxury hotel. The only positive is that the bed itself was comfortable - would have been nice to have that King bed though, of course. \n\nMany of the hotel staff seemed rude and inappropriate in situations - including the onsite Hertz staff. Obviously management is not training well for customer service at this location. Plus I had went to the front desk to get my key card \"keyed\" for use in the parking garage because I had rented a car there, but they couldn't even manage to get this right. I never could get the key card to work in the parking garage. \n\nConference rooms were poorly set-up, freezing cold, and loud! The walls were paper thin and it was at times very difficult to hear the presentations because sound from the other presentations next door would drift through - this was especially a problem in the back of the conference rooms. Attendees often were left standing at the back of the room because not enough chairs were set up.\n\nPerhaps for Charlotte this is a nice property, but for those of us who have traveled around a bit, this place falls very far short on the luxury scale. If you are in Charlotte for travel and have an option to choose where to stay, I'd recommend the much nicer looking Hilton down the street - that's a nice looking property and Hilton is always good. \n\nNot recommended.", "business_id": "4nFqPL-glgDm9v7bZptskQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-06-30", "type": "review"}

The front desk staff is very, very good, in addition to the banquet staff when it comes to accommodating colleagues that are in for a convention. \n\nThe bar area across the floor from the front desk is one of my favorite places to network with professionals as much as I do drink. Known as \"The Lobby Bar\", the area is set up strictly as one to rendezvous with business associates and friends during events primarily after 5 PM. The menu is moderately reasonable for beer drafts, yet a little pricier for hors d' oeuvres and cocktails. If you can get your company to approve drinks and appetizers under T&E, it is highly advised. \n\nParking is so-so. While the convenience to park within the underground lot is appreciated, I really think that it should be marked better with regard to where the elevator is in relation to the section of where your car is. It took me nearly 20 minutes to find my car at one point!\n\nAltogether, the Westin Charlotte can be a place to really enjoy. A little pricey, yet worth it if you prefer a downtown (they call it uptown in Charlotte) location while either traveling or on business.", "business_id": "4nFqPL-glgDm9v7bZptskQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-07-05", "type": "review"}

There were no pickles or grain mustard. Then the next night I ordered a turkey club and it is exactly what it said on the menu. The customer service is awesome but they need to  follow what their menu says. Other than that I had a great time.

The first room I was given smelled strongly of smoke (it was a non-smoking room) and I asked for a new room. They gave me a new room and it was much better. Some of the rooms have this weird basin thing -- instead of giving you a sink in the bathroom, there's a sink outside the bathroom, with this weird tall basin that is hard to use. If you don't like the room with the weird basin, ask for a different one, because they don't all have them. \n\nThere isn't a free breakfast, which is sort of weird, I think, and the room's supplies weren't as nice as some other Holiday Inns I've stayed at. The best thing about the room was that the clock-radio thing had a spot for your ipod, so you can listen to your music in the room (and it charges your ipod, too!). \n\nAmenities -- The pool on the roof is a uniform 3 1/2 feet in depth -- yeah, I know, exciting -- and not very big in terms of length and width, either. The fitness room features a few treadmills, a few bicycles, and a bowflex thingy -- not even any free weights! There is a \"jogging track\" on the roof, which is really just a path painted on the roof so you can run around in a circle on the hard concrete. It's really pretty up on the roof on a sunny day, but even the most hardcore runners in our group couldn't stand that running path. \n\nThere wasn't anything wrong with the place.

Safe in room, but other than that, no in room bling. Not a fan of the open shower at all. I like a nice shower with good water pressure. The shower in this room has a seat and a hand held shower head. It's not enclosed and there is no tub.

Final bill is shoved under your room door on the morning of your check out.\n\nBar/Restaurant is typical. Overpriced, but you have other choices. Dining options immediately around the hotel are limited. Subway, The Great Wok, Cedar Street Tavern are within short walking distance and are fine if you don't want or need to go downtown for better dining.\n\nThere is a CVS and a Harris Teeter also within short walking distance.\n\nParking is $13 a day in a structure next to the hotel.

I simply do not understand any hotel charging for Wi-Fi access in room when it's free in the lobby and other public spaces of the hotel.\n\nMinor quibbles, but If I were attending a multi-day conference at the Convention Center, I'd look for a hotel closer.

We stayed here because of the location across the street from the Nascar Hall of Fame and it's proximity to the downtown area.  We were also right across from the Speed Street street fair, very nice.  The close proximity to the highways worked out well as we made it a point to visit South Carolina as well as other areas of North Carolina.  I recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Charlotte for business or pleasure.  The only ding, if I may, is the parking which is a little limited and there is a nominal daily fee.

Overall the staff was very tentative to any need or concern. Mathew who seemed to be an all-round staff member assisted me several times and went way and beyond on. On one occasion he took quite a bit of time to explain and tour the best route and shortcuts to get from my car to hotel elevators and what garage floors to park on. Way to go Mathew.  The front desk was always helpful. We had an issue with room noise one night at 10 PM and it was handled in the best possible way with no hesitation either Lynn or Carolyn (not sure who was on duty that night) fully addressed this concern  to our 100% satisfaction the next day. The shuttle is really great the driver saw us in the lobby looking around and asking directions to local restaurants and  JB stepped right in with a very enthusiastic attitude and offered to take us wherever we needed. That impressed me because usually the guys working a shuttle would rather avoid having to take anyone any where. JB even gave us his card and instructed us to call him when we where ready to be picked up. The breakfast is offered in the lobby and is not free but worth the price. I would advise to get a package so its included with the cost of your room rate with parking. It works out to be less that way. At the breakfast buffet the cooks will prepare you several items all of them are really nice an attentive. Nelly, Lupe and Laura where great and Lupe is a gem, thank you for having a box with breakfast to go for my wife every morning.  This hotel offers room service from 5-10 PM and the selection was good as well as the food. My wife had the pork almost every night , it was that good. Overall this hotel is very clean and centrally located to down town. The parking is good and the views as well, but the great staff was the best feature by far.

Luckily, it's 7:30pm, but somehow from the presence of the earplugs provided in my bedside drawer, I'm not sure that the party's going to end by the time I need to call it a night.\n\nThe same goes for inside the hotel - a couple nights ago there were some folks in the hall, obviously having come back from a good night at the bars - and I could hear every. single. thing. that they said to each other.  It was all in good fun, I wasn't anywhere close to calling it a night - but that doesn't mean that others with their Privacy Please signs weren't.\n\nOther than the noise pollution issue, though, the place is pretty nice.  Rooms are decent-sized, and provide the expected amenities - including flat-screen TVs (which shouldn't be a surprise in this day and age, but somehow can be).  Their Wi-Fi is charged at $10-$15 per night, based on bandwidth, unless you subscribe to their frequent guest program, which means they'll take it off at the end of your stay.\n\nThe lobby connects directly to the Epicenter or the BB&T building by walkways, and also opens up directly to the Bank of America Center, which makes it pretty much an awesome location for business travelers.  There's a Walgreens in the lower lobby, as well as a Starbucks, Chick-Fil-A, and several other quick-grub places.\n\nOverall, it's a nice place to stay with some minor issues - the location as a whole could use an update, but I've stayed at plenty worse places in my time as a business traveler.", "business_id": "QThlnQ7AvzZwXHKD5DjdCw", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-08-22", "type": "review"}

Made a reservation here and was also here for memorial day weekend and was very underwhelmed. The Omni hotels have always ben known to be a very nice place and this location was not up to that standard. It was not horrible but for the price some people pay I would expect better. \n\nWhen staying here I ordered room service several times and it was okay, but nothing special that I could not get anywhere else. I thought the food eas delicious though I just think that for the premium price they ask for you would get more. The portions were a nice size though and they always give you condiments which not a lot of places do. \n\nThe hotel room in general was very BLAH. Nothing exciting, but nothing gross. Every think seemed out dated and very pale and boring. You think they would have spent more time and money in making it more up to date. The carpet as well was not gross, but just kinda looked like it had been there a while and needed to be replaced. \n\nAs a whole, the hotel was a nice place. The weekend I was there I also saw there was an Indian wedding going on. I thought it would be a great place to hold a venue, but I would not want my guest to stay in the room I did if they are all pretty much similar. I also felt that the 3 stars is mainly due to the rooftop pool they had which was amazing on my long weekend. That alone could have made the hotel better. I think that if this location spent some more time and money they could live up to the standard that all the other locations do. Charlotte is a nice city and all the other hotels are more up to date. Omni would gain more business if they just did some minor changes", "business_id": "QThlnQ7AvzZwXHKD5DjdCw", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-06-03", "type": "review"}

I've looked up other hotels in the area and have decided upon the Omni. The Omni is very overrated. When we checked-in, they had a five day wedding celebration in progress. No bell captains available upon check-in. When we got up to the room, I was very surprised to see how outdated it was for the money. Ripped curtains, blown out light bulbs in bathroom. And most of the extra electrical outlets did not work. I had my cell phone charging, come to find out the outlet never worked. I switched it to another outlet, and, again, no charge. Upon my morning cup of coffee in the room, the mini creamers were sour. I called room service, and they never brought them up. Nor did they refresh the coffee station when they cleaned the room. No fresh creamers and two sugars for two days! I take my coffee serious. Lol. The second day in the morning starting at 7:00 AM, I was woken by a pounding sound of music coming from the courtyard. This was the ritual going on for the wedding. It continued for two hours. If the wedding was going to be honored on the lower floors, they should have put the other guests on the upper floor to avoid all the commotion. The garbage cans on site were overflowing with garbage for two days. No one took the responsibility of emptying them. We paid good money for a nice, clean, quite break. Only to have nothing but a out of date room, tons of noise, and a unclean looking surrounding. Guests should have been forewarned of the wedding festivities when booking. Although, the staff was very accommodating, they weren't on a mini vacation, we were. The only thing we were offered was free coffee or a breakfast beverage in the morning ! Also, be aware, if you don't join their rewards club, check your bill for a $9.95 a day charge for Internet. We were really disappointed in this hotel and will not be returning at all.

I surprised my wife a couple months ago with a round trip adventure from Charlotte to NYC on the Amtrak. I should mention I won the round trip tickets for two on the auction site bidoncharlotte.com for only $200.00 total. This site is updated quarterly by the local radio stations and multiple businesses participate with their local deals, so keep an eye on it. \n\nOur experience with the Amtrak is best described as laid back. The train ride was going to be 12 hours long, so I decided we should depart CLT at 2AM so we could sleep the majority of the way. We arrived at the station, parked our car, hoping parking was free (it was), stepped out with our luggage and entered the station. We had our tickets printed out already, and stepped into line. The man never announced the departure, just began leading this line onto the train. No one checked our baggage, there was no hand raping from a TSA agent, just walk in and board your train, I finally had to start a conversation with an Amtrak employee to just make sure this was the Crescent train we were suppose to be on. He said yes and told us to pick out our seats. We put our bags overhead and sat down, still haven't shown anyone our tickets and off the train goes. Around an hour later the guy stops by and asks for our tickets. We oblige and he stamps it, and that was the entire process. \n\nHaving flown for so many years, I felt like we were getting away with a crime. This laid back procedure surely wouldn't fly on our return trip from Penn Station in NYC of all places, I was wrong. In Penn Station on the way home, they post what train to board on 15 minutes before its departure, you board yet again with no bag checks or pat downs, and they check your ticket like 30 minutes after the train has left. I could never shake the culture shock of that feeling compared to flying, but it was so convenient and relaxing. My only regret was not packing liquor, I guess next trip I will. \n\nAs far as the train experience itself, you get large wide seats with built in leg reclining via a side lever. The drop down eating trays from the airplanes are there, and the best perk of all your very own wall outlet with two plugs. The views in the morning are beautiful, traveling through all the small quaint downtown and mountain ranges. The train does stop at every station along the way, but usually only for a couple minutes. \n\nWe thought 12 hours would be almost unbearable, but we were surprised how fast it went being able entertain ourselves with electronic devices at all times, sleep together in our double seats, and have the ability to get up and explore or stretch whenever we wanted. The snack car is nice, for drinks, sandwiches, or candy. On the way back we made a dinner reservation and it was very nice to be able to sit down and eat a full dinner with beer and desert while watching the countryside pass by. (See photos) \n\nAfter the experience we both agreed we would do that again anytime we found a deal, but that 12 hours was about as long as we would be willing to spend on board. Luckily Washington DC is only around 8 hours away, so I believe that will be our next train voyage. \n\nBig fan of the Amtrak now, the low hassle and freedom on board totally outweighs any of the seediness that comes with this form of low income travel.", "business_id": "3lr10jxwg-ObDwtCKxEBgA", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-07-27", "type": "review"}

When I was first stuck in this airport for over 5 hours because of a delayed flight, I wanted to charge my phone. Well, I don't know why they have so few outlets, but when you find one it's like winning the lottery. People were scouring the airport everywhere looking for outlets. We happened to find one and everyone in my group just used it in turns. I even saw some people sitting in the bathroom next to an outlet charging their phones and laptops.  The outlet situation is crazy!\n\nI found the restaurant and food choices to be rather limited, but at least there was something. \n\nAs we were flying back through Charlotte to catch out second flight, we had to go through immigration and customs, because we got off an international flight. As we made our way into immigration, the line wasn't super long, so many people just ducked under the ropes to avoid walking through many rows of empty lanes. These people didn't cut in front of anyone, they just wanted to avoid having to walk pointlessly through empty zig zag after empty zig zag of the line. There was a very angry woman who came running and yelled at everyone. She made them all get back out of lines and walk to the end. She then forced them to walk through each empty section of the line. They actually ended up in the EXACT position, since they hadn't skipped in front of anyone anyway.  This lady was crazy. She was all the talk in the Immigration line. She was definitely channeling Nurse Ratched (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest). We had hoped to get through immigration quickly as the line wasn't super long, but we were wrong. The immigration officers were awfully chatty and there weren't many of them. So, it took an exceptionally long time compared to the length of the line. Customs went much more quickly. \n\nIn the future, I will avoid going through this airport, but if I have to be there, I'm bringing a lawn chair for the immigration lines and a power strip to share outlets with others.", "business_id": "3Q0QQPnHcJuX1DLCL9G9Cg", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-06-25", "type": "review"}

What I didn't hear about was how congested it gets once inside.  Let's start from the beginning....I made a trek from South Carolina to Charlotte Airport and I ended up noticing  that there aren't many gas stations on the way to fill up.  I ended up finding a tiny gas station that did the trick.  Thank goodness.  I ended up driving back to the Hertz lot and dropping off my car.  The rental buses are relatively quick but the guy that was DRIVING -- SUCK!  Let me make that clear - HE SUCKKKKEDDD!!!  I clearly am not the type to ask too much from anyone so when I ask you very nicely and say 'Can you please help me get this into the bus?' and you just look at me like I'm crazy I seriously contemplate throwing my cell phone at you (not that I'm violent).  It's not that it was so heavy, it was more so that I had my work stuff, my purse, and the suitcase.  I was going to do the majority of the lifting, I just needed an ounce of strength. So naturally, he didn't want to help so I took my sweet time -- holding everyone else up because this idiot didn't think that the faster I could get this woman in and out the faster these people can get to the airport.  Anyways,  we get finally get to the terminal and just because I was annoyed I waited until everyone was out to see if the driver was going to at least ATTEMPT to ask me if I needed help.  Nope he didn't, so naturally I just stood there and looked at him and he decided to get my bag (as well he should).  **Caveat** The way he was struggling with that bag made me think his weak a** could've used more bag lifting to get some more strength in his arms.  Moving on.....\n\nThe US Airways terminal was packed as usual, I expect no less.  I'm a United flyer and have always, always dreaded flying US Airways but I had no choice.  I gritted my teeth and checked my bag.  I prayed that I would get there at the same time my bag did.  Going through security was ridiculous -- I have status -- and it was still ridiculous.  I was even told by one of the TSA gate agents multiple times to make sure I'm an \"Elite\" passenger.  Little did she know I know what the hell I'm doing.  I've only been traveling all of my life.  What she should've been doing is assisting those SAME people that kept walking through the metal detector with BELTS and COINS in their pockets.  My security episode was only 30 minutes -- 15 minutes longer then it should've been.  I get through security and notice the tight space of this terminal.  I just don't understand why this place is so tight and I realize there is NO SPACE to move around.  Annoyed I see the Chili's and want the strongest drink they have.  I was really excited to see that the waitress felt my pain and told me she would help me out that day.  I had a little burger and a few strong drinks and tipped her quite well!!  I was surprised US Airways boarded the plane ON TIME!  First for EVERYTHING!  There are a few things I do NOT like about US Airways but I won't share them on this post since we're only talking about CLT.  \n\nBottom line:  CLT can use some work just with overall efficiency.  TSA Agents could do themselves a favor and not nag the hell out of people in the security lines and focus on those ones that seem to be holding up the line.

If you A and B are slammed busy, walk down about 50 yards to C or D and the lines are almost always shorter and typically faster. Most people congregate to A and B since they are closer to the beginning of curbside drop-off. Fear not! On those buys travel days, seek out the slimmer lines of the other TSA's at C and D. You'll be happy you did. \n\nGlad to have a very accessible and friendly airport in town. Happy to fly out and even more excited to fly back in!

I do not have sufficient words to express my absolute disgust and disappointment with Ms Owens' lack of compassion, flexibility and courtesy.  \n\nWe have flown with our daughter many times in the past eight years, usually taking US Airways because your crews have been unfailingly helpful, sympathetic and courteous.  Until now.  \n\nCamille is now twelve years old, nearly 100 pounds, and almost five feet tall.  She is non-ambulatory, non-verbal, has autistic-like sensitivities, and often will require one or more diaper changes on a long flight.  Consequently, we always sit as close to the back of the plane as possible, as she is much too large to change in the tiny bathroom, and past flight crews have been very accommodating in arranging to either block off the aisle, screen off the last row of seats, or allow us to use the floor of the galley when everything is locked down After service.  \n\nWe were explaining this to the flight crew and Ms Owens when she took it upon herself to insist that that absolutely could not be done, that we were only allowed to change Camille in the bathroom, which is physically impossible, and to aggressively verbally berate my wife Christina over wanting to make some arrangement so that we could get to our destination with a minimum of discomfort and inconvenience to ourselves and our fellow passengers.  \n\nHer aggression set off our daughter into a loud and prolonged screaming fit.  Rather than wait for the meltdown to pass, or to back off and give us a chance to calm our daughter, Ms Owens immediately contacted security to have us removed from the plane, which was unnecessary, humiliating, and a tremendous inconvenience.  \n\nThe security manager, Mike, was extremely kind, courteous and helpful as he assisted us from the plane, and consequently rebooked our flights for tomorrow, and set us up at a hotel near the airport. Nonetheless, this has made a difficult and stressful trip even more so, and has caused us to have to scramble to rearrange things at our point of arrival.  We are also stuck in a hotel without most of our luggage and some of our prescriptions. This has been, overall, a horrible experience, and certainly will make us think twice before flying US Airways or its affiliates again.  In addition, I cannot imagine that Ms Owens' actions were in any way acceptible per the ADA.  \n\nI attempted to call to make and resolve this complaint, but the agent and supervisor I spoke with insisted that it could only be addressed through a web form, promising contact in one to three business days, which I find to be completely unsatisfactory. \n\nOn the positive side, Yvonne J, another gate agent, was tremendously helpful and compassionate.  We also received assistance from an airport maintenance man, whose name I did not catch, in replacing a bolt on the wheelchair that broke as we were bringing it up the gangway.  \n\nI would appreciate a response as soon as possible, which should include a plan of action for training your personnel to deal with the needs of disabled passengers.", "business_id": "3Q0QQPnHcJuX1DLCL9G9Cg", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-07-29", "type": "review"}

For starters they got rid of the carpet and replaced it with the more logical tile covering.\n\nThe main atrium is beautiful and contains quite a few different food and shopping options - even if I do always follow my nose to Cinnabon. The wall of windows lets light in and the trees are a pleasant addition that I don't recall having seen in any other airports to date. Lastly, why is everybody hating on the white rocking chairs? It's quite obvious these things are Charlotte's touch of southern charm. I, for one, have never even had the chance to sit in one because they appear to be so loved by all the other travelers. There are of course the power outlets there too.\n\nAs far as getting to the airport and checking in, it runs smoothly.

The bathrooms were busy and the bathroom attendant was a hindrance to everyone trying to get in and out of there quickly.  People don't need to be told when they go to the bathroom where the toilet or the sink is, and there was no purpose in having the person there.  And then you feel guilty for not tipping, because there is a big tip jar there.  Why would you tip someone who hasn't provided any type of service for you?  Then I worry, what if she is actually the janitor, and they made her \"bathroom attendant\" so they could pay her crappy wages and claim she was making up the rest with tips?  Then obviously few people are tipping her, so she would then make less than a normal janitor.  I hope that is not the case, but who knows?  I thought it was very weird that there was a bathroom attendant in there and I will be avoiding those bathrooms from now on.\n\nTwo stars for the horrible bathrooms, five stars for the restaurant/bar choice, 3-4 stars for all the other relatively minor aspects of the airport.  I will settle at 3 stars because the whole bathroom thing was so bothersome to me.", "business_id": "3Q0QQPnHcJuX1DLCL9G9Cg", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-08-27", "type": "review"}

We've been here when it's been quiet and also when it's been teeming with people. When quiet, it's lovely: there is an airy, open central food court that has a lot of light and open space. There are some neat art pieces and mobiles/suspended kinetic sculptures which are cool, and rocking chairs in which to relax. The airport's signage is clear and everything is really well-marked. The airport itself has always been really clean whenever we've been through it. There are many bathrooms and all are clean, too. Each bathroom has an attendant who offers mouthwash and mints and various supplies (you either appreciate or don't, these bathroom attendants. For me, they've all been pleasant, wishing me a nice day, and there's never been pressure to use their supplies or tip them, so I don't mind them. I find them to be a throw-back to an earlier, more refined time. I can understand others being off-put by them, though).\n\nWhat's not so great is the lack of stores and better restaurants here (this can be problematic when you have a longer lay-over here), and how the place is a total cluster-f**k when it's busy. It just seems like the US Air terminal isn't large enough to accommodate all the people they service at busier \"rush hour\" times. I've seen people literally trip over each other, trying to catch connections, when it's busy. The terminal perhaps should have been made larger or wider, so more people could more safely move about.\n\n(As a side note, I think it foolish to downgrade this airport's ratings due to flights being delayed or cancelled, as some reviewers have done. The timeliness of flights run by all the various airlines is often - usually - not controlled by the airport. That's like blaming a mall for one of it's store's questionable return policies.

One of my sisters has lived in Charlotte for the last 3 years- making that a common drive.  Then I moved to Memphis.  The drive got a wee longer.  Then I moved to Denver- no way in hell I am driving from there!\n\nThen I found out one of my ex-gfs that I have some bad blood with (and I don't even know why, but whatever) works out of CLT for US Airways, I had absolutely no intention of ever visiting this airport.  I am better off just flying to ATL, and then driving.\n\nHowever, this past weekend, I didn't have that option.  I actually had to fly.  I burned some skymiles to make the journey.  Since I was flying Delta, there was not a direct flight from DEN, I opted to fly through MSP.\n\nWhen I arrived to CLT, it seemed like a cozy airport.  It looks like Delta is based out of A terminal, which is nice and small (and easy to get to).  There is a walkway taking you to other parts of the airport via foot or moving walkway.  During that small walk, they have a bunch of posters of movies that had been filmed in Charlotte- a cool little piece of history.  \n\nAt the end of the walkway, they have a small observation area with rocking chairs you can watch the runway and other gates, if that is your thing.  \n\nExiting was a breeze, and I got picked up in no time.  I was surprised though to not see traffic people kicking idle vehicles out of the way.\n\nWhen it was time to return, my mom dropped me off as she was on her way to drive back to Atlanta. This was Monday morning.  You would think the place would be a zoo, but it wasn't!\n\nOne thing I did notice, was the amount of on-site parking, and how cheap it was!  5$ a day long term parking!  By far, that is the cheapest long term parking I have ever seen!  I do know they have plenty of shuttles to that will take you to/from the terminal.\n\nI went back to A terminal, which was easy- there were only 5-6 people in front of me at the security line.  It looks like each terminal has its own security line.  That is helpful in terms of keeping the flow of things smooth.\n\nFor getting picked up and dropped off, this is a pretty simple airport.

The first time was 3 years ago prior to being a Yelper and, I had experienced several delays, and was late to my destination. However last week, I visited NC and went through there twice to make connecting flights. \n\nFirst I must say the amenities and the sheer number of options of restaurants and shops is impressive for a small airport. They have fried chicken places, vegetarian restaurants, a bookstore, nail salon, almost anything you can think of needing here. It's well kept and clean, and the bathrooms were nice. They also have free wifi and rocking chairs which are a pretty neat feature of the airport. \n\nHowever, the biggest issue I had with this airport is that getting to the other side of the airport was a slow and arduous process. It's kind of small, and during rush hours and in consideration of making a connecting flight, it can become very cumbersome to travel through. The reason why this is is because it is much smaller compared to others and its aisles aren't very wide. Yet at the same time, they have these large transports going around ferrying people to their destinations. Not a problem, except they stop traffic behind them sometimes and make it difficult to get past them because of the rush. I was also upset that the woman driving an empty one was moving so slow and stopping to chat with people when in fact I was trying to get past her and couldn't because the traffic going in the other direction was moving fast. I think they need smaller transport vehicles here, because bigger is certainly not better as far as this airport goes. \n\nAs for the staff here, they are ok. A bit rushed at times, and as I said earlier, there was a woman who held me up and almost made me late for my connecting flight which was at the opposite end from where I landed. \n\nOverall, this isn't a bad airport, I just had some bad experiences here.

My son and I stayed here last night after his flight coming into Charlotte got in 5 hours late. It was after midnight and we knew we'd have to be on the road first thing in the morning so I went cheap rather than pay $120 for a HIE. Made a reservation thru Priceline on the parking shuttle and got there around 1am. There were two people wandering around the parking lot with no shoes and backpacks. And it appeared that some of the guests are permanent residents. The office smelled bad and I conducted business through the 1\" thick glass barricade. Was too tired to care at that point so we stayed. The room was so small that one of the two double beds was up against the a/c unit. Speaking of... The a/c was not turned on in the room so it was like 90 degrees in there when we opened the door and it took an hour to cool down til we could sleep. The bedding looked and smelled clean, thankfully. But the room was smelly and dusty. We slept fully clothed, didn't use the shower or towels and just rolled out of bed when the sun came up and left. So I suppose for the $50, we got a decent enough nap. But I have expected my car to be broken into in the morning. Not that we would have used it, but the pool was closed.

However, the people who run this location are entirely incompetent. \n\nFirst problem: Since I already had a reservation, I was forced to use this extremely bizarre video chat system where I picked up what equaled a pay phone and video chatted with a representative. This was while there were available representatives on site. The manager who \"dialed\" the rep didn't explain the process at all.\n\nThe representative I spoke to was fine, but she misled me and tried to up-sell me twice and then completely lost interest in helping me when she realized she wasn't going to make her sales quota through me. This whole process was entirely confusing and I don't know why a company would EVER consider doing this. \n\nSecond problem: We were told where are car was parked, and although there were reps available, no one took us to where the car was. They just kind of pointed and said, \"It's near the fence.\" Um, the entire place is surrounded by a fence! \n\nThird problem: They gave us no inspection paperwork. We had to get in the car, drive around and ask for it and then inspect the car ourselves. They took the paperwork afterwards, but who knows what they did with it!\n\nFourth problem: We returned the car 1 hour late, which meant we incurred a $30 fee for a late return. I understand that this is the policy, but didn't know before hand. The manager said he could do nothing except give me a gift certificate. Tough luck for me since I already swore up and down that I would never rent from Hertz again.  I resolved to call when I returned home.\n\nFifth problem: I called and emailed customer service about my charge. WHen I finally got a hold of someone, they told me that there was nothing they could do since I already accepted the gift certificate, and because I accepted it, it meant that I agreed the issue was resolved.\n\nThat's when I was really incensed since no one ever said that by accepting the certificate that I agreed I was OK with being charged $30/hour. Because I most certainly was not! As a \"goodwill\" gesture, she reduced my fee by a whopping $15.38.\n\nConsider this your fair warning. If I could give this company zero stars, I would.

The ineptness of the management of the place bordered on comical.\n\nNot only were people being showered-on while bordering the bus, with nobody around to care or fix the gushing water, but the bus drivers weren't smart enough to scoot up the pick-up point 15 feet so people wouldn't get wet -- and no manager was around to think for them and move the pick-up point to a drier spot. I have videos of this farce.\n\nI was referred to Hertz by Marriott by a call transfer when I booked the hotel at the airport...and unless Marriott wants to risk being guilty by association, they better run away from these jokers until they figure out how to manage, think and behave responsibly, even when they're busy and making lots of bookings (and revenues) -- and to have more respect for the time and needs of their clients.", "business_id": "eThu9hCL8NOjOxswQ-cFSg", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-07-30", "type": "review"}

Prior to reserving, I joined Hertz gold plus rewards to get any additional discount available. Arrived at hertz, lobby was packed. A woman walked along side the line and asked were there any gold plus members. Of course I said yes. She informed me that I didn't have to stand at the back of this line, I could go to the gold plus member location. So off I go. Walk into the booth, sales person asked my name and said you can pick up your car at at #'d stall. That was easy!\nGet to the car, it looked fine as far as I was concerned. I get to exit booth where they electronically scan your vehicle before leaving lot. At this point the attendant asked if I want to prepay for gas. Not being a frequent renter of cars, I ask...How does that benefit me? She says that when I get back, \"We will fill the tank up at a rate of $3.11\", which is cheaper than the street. I agree. There's no price quote before they run my card. I get a long folded receipt, my mistake was in not trying to hold up the line, knowing what my daily rate was, I didn't look at it. I get home and look at the receipt...WAIT A MINUTE!!\nI was charged for a vehicle upgrade, SiriusXM radio and $60 bucks for gas prepay. \nI call the Hertz center where I got the car from, explain to them what the discrepancy was. \nThis  \"CHICK\" on the phone says \"well why did you leave if it was wrong?\"\nI try to explain to this \"BIRD\" that I reserved what I thought was a Nissan Altima, Or comparable car, a standard vehicle. I received a Chevy Malibu which as far as I am concerned was a standard vehicle. It doesn't list anywhere on the vehicle what class it's considered nor does it list upgraded features. On top of that, you don't get the detailed billing statement until you're two(2) tires off the lot!! \nShe ask me to hold, I get transferred to their corporate office. The individual says she doesn't know why they transferred me there but she will have the supervisor from the location call me. I wait about an hour, then drive back to Hertz. I explain again!! I was very clear in what was wrong. The attendant says \"well, the system says this is what it is\". I tell him that I don't care what your system says. I have an emailed confirmation with all the terms I agreed to. He asks to see email. I show him and he says o.k. Makes changes to the system and gives me another long folded receipt. I go through it and I see he did take off for the SiriusXM radio but not the vehicle upgrade. I approach again and explain that my confirmation was at a very specific daily rate for a standard car. He asks to see email again and says well you have a full size car which is more $$. I say \"then give me the standard vehicle at the rate I originally agreed to\". Needless to say, I kept the same car at the lower rate. This was more of a pain in the butt than I care to write.\n\n   Upon returning the car, just knowing that the tank was about $15 - $20 bucks shy of being filled that I would get the difference back @ a rate of $3.11 per gallon.\n Wrong again!! Now I was explained the add'l $60 deposit differently, Now it is for the convenience of them filling it up, no matter where the tank was. When I questioned it, the attendant starts talking about.. because you went over 100 miles a day, so forth, and so on, just jargon! I explain that I had unlimited mileage. I get more jargon.\n\n  It cost me an add'l $60 bucks for the \"Gas Tank Riddle\" when I could have filled it up just outside the airport for no more than $20 bucks. This is after the hurdles I already had to jump through to get the price I was originally quoted.\n\n  Overall, it was not a good experience!!

The upgrade process and service have always been excellent and seamless, which is very important to me since I am usually rushing to a meeting. However, upon arrival at the Charlotte, NC (CLT) airport location, I wanted to upgrade to a corvette parked with a \"splurge\" sign. Now usually, the garage attendant checks/adjusts my reservation and gives me the keys. This time however, I was asked to go back inside to the reservation counter, and call my Amex to check on my insurance coverage. I have never been asked to do this before at any of National's other locations, and being an executive club member, I have rented from most (LAX, SFO, PHX, JFK, LGA, SAN, etc). I have also been able to upgrade to The highest luxury vehicles at these sites, Mercedes, Maseratis, Corvettes, etc. without issue. I tried to explain to the attendant and the manager on site, that what they were asking me to do was unusual, and that I was in a hurry to a meeting, but they didn't care. I refused to call Amex, and went ahead with my regular full size rental. Not only did National @ CLT result in my first disappointing experience with the brand, they also lost out on an additional $100/per day upgrade fee. Needless to say, this single experience has prompted me to diversify my rental fleet, and for my Denver trip earlier this week, I rented from AVIS.

I actually hardly saw the place, to be honest as we arrived at 12:30 AM on a Saturday night, the night before the Coca Cola 600 NASCAR race.  After a painless check in, where the desk person provided us with some cold waters, we trudged off to our room and fell into bed.  We had a HEAVY suitcases as we'd been vacationing a while and were bummed to have to carry them upstairs, but they hotel was sold out and our bad... our profile asks for a high floor, which I didn't think to check when I booked here.  Ah well.  We used Marriott points to stay here so not sure what they were charging for that weekend, but I don't think it was too much because they provided some pricing for the following year in the rooms and it looked affordable.\n\nWe sleepily rolled out of bed when we awoke, showered, dressed and headed to the free breakfast.  It was the usual fare with hot and cold foods.  Liked that they had biscuits and gravy (love the south!) and they had waffles, eggs, assorted breads, etc.  The usual.  nothing was spectacular, but it filled the void, the staff and guests were friendly and we were in and out, headed off to our event.\n\nWhen we got back late again that night, same drill... up the stairs and into bed and then we headed out at the crack of dawn to catch a flight home, so no time for the breakfast that day.\n\nI was glad that we were so busy or I would have been disappointed to find that there was no Jacuzzi at this location.  I think thi sis the first RI that I have been to without the Jacuzzi and that is a deal breaker for me when I travel because I don't have one at home.   They do a have a pool, but it's pretty dinky, and a tennis court.\n\nBecause they were booked up, parking was tight, but we managed to get spots both nights.\n\nLots of construction taking place on the road around it, so it's a little tricky getting in and out of there, but otherwise, this was a good stay.\n\nGreat AC, good shower (except that it didn't drain properly... how do cleaning people miss this stuff???), comfy bed and even though I didn't use it, love having the kitchen.  It worke dgreat for the short weekend visit... don't know if I would be happy there on a longer trip, though.\n\nAlso, lots of stores and restaurants nearby, so that is handy.  Location is AWESOME for hitting up Charlotte Motor Speedway.  It's like less than 5 miles away and on the same street!  Although, I think if I were to do it all again, I would probably have selected a property near the airport since we were flying out so early in the morning after the race.

The next morning, we had to be up and out early for freshman orientation.  So, at about 5:20am - key card in hand - I sauntered out to cut through the pool area to the main lobby.  Pool gates were locked so I had to walk around front, which I understand for safety purposes.  However, once in the front vesibule, the inner doors wouldn't open. I saw someone sitting inside and he motioned to pick up the phone (didn't see it, no java yet).  It rang and rang.

There are lots of chain restaurants nearby with TGI Friday's sharing the same parking lot.\n\nWe arrived in time for the (free) happy hour. We were given two drink tickets, good for beer, wine or mixed drinks. My husband and I both went for cocktails, which were good. They also had a lot of food set out, including pasta with meatballs, hot dogs, nachos, veggies and salads. Definitely much more than expected from a free happy hour and enough to make a light dinner if we didn't already have other plans.\n\nOur room was a pretty standard hotel room, but it was noticeably clean and clearly well-taken care of. I think they allow dogs at this hotel, but you would never know by how clean the whole place is. Wifi was also free in the hotel rooms.\n\nThe bed was a little on the harder side from what I'm used to at home, but still pretty comfortable. In the mornings they have a free breakfast buffet with items like biscuits and gravy, waffles, scrambled eggs, etc. Unfortunately, we slept too late after the concert to make it by the cut-off time (9:30 AM).\n\nThey also offer free soft drinks and popcorn all afternoon until the evening for guests of the hotel.\n\nOverall, as mentioned, this is a pretty standard hotel as far as the standard rooms, but the extra free perks, the reasonable price and the cleanliness of the place make this a hotel that I would definitely recommend to others when looking for a place to stay in Charlotte.", "business_id": "Lvk4P_Npmueqs-n1hAxxWw", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-06-27", "type": "review"}

The hotel is pretty outdated...but makes up for it in the hotel staff. My flight from Ca was delayed twice and I did not end up getting in to Charlotte till 2am. When I first got there an older gentleman greeted me and immediately made me feel extremely welcome. He checked me in quickly, gave the quick run down on all the hotel amenities and even offered me some warm pop corn and said I could get some soda from the beverage machine in the dining room.  I had room 303 which was super clean and comfortable. \n\nThe next morning with very little sleep I was starving so I headed down to the complementary breakfast. The small buffet had scrambled eggs, sausage patties, home frys, biscuits & gravy, bagels, oatmeal, yogurt and you could make homemade waffles. They also offered coffee & juice plus soda if you want. I personally did not care for it and that was only morning I ate there. It wasn't cause the food was bad... I  don't eat eggs, sausage or oatmeal....it is a texture thing. I much prefer the freshness of Embassy Suites breakfast. Again it is just a preference thing. \n\nLater that afternoon was the evening reception. Each adult is issued a card where they can order 2 alcohol drinks for free. I don't drink alcohol so I can't really say what the offered...however I did see wine and beer on tap. They also offer a hot buffet..most nights it was pasta, meatballs, baked potatoes, chili, another soup of the day, a very very tiny salad bar, hot dog and nacho bar plus the soda and pop corn. \n\nDuring the first nights buffet a HUGE group of teenage rugby playing boys all came with their chaperons to the hotel...later that evening around 10:45 pm they were all still downstairs in the lobby / atrium doing rugby moves jumping over furniture and being as loud as if they were at an outdoor concert. To heighten the craziness the hotel does allow dogs and my neighbor had a small dog that they had left in the hotel room for most of the day and almost all of the evening. when a small dog is lonely he barks a LOT... Because of these two issues I went down stairs the next morning and went to speak with the lady [Amy] at the front desk. Amy was EXTREMELY apologetic..Poor thing I was like the 6th person to talk to her about the issue.  she changed my room, she also discounted my bill which would have been fine just those two things however 10 minutes later there was a knock on my new room door and it was Amy holding a bag with a handwritten note. In the bag was 2 bottle of water, fruit snacks, cheese and crackers, candy bars and a bag of trail mix, Talk about going above and beyond, you never see that anymore. The rest of my stay was very quite....I am now a lifetime customer Drury hotel chain.", "business_id": "Lvk4P_Npmueqs-n1hAxxWw", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-06-29", "type": "review"}

If you look them up in the KOA directory you'll see that they boast about on site camp store, Blimpie, gas ,etc.  This is  because the campground is located AT THE GAS STATION.  The camp store isn't a camp store...it's a gas station convenience store with a Blimpie in it.  And worse than that, connected to the convenience store is a neighborhood dive bar.\nThe pull through sites are very long but most have just rocks and no smooth spot at all.\nThey don't have any fire rings yet sell firewood at the store.  We asked about making a fire and the gas attendant, uh Blimpie worker, uh convenience store worker, uh campground worker told us to just make it on the ground...IN THE GRASS! (The rocky pull through site was so bad that we asked to be moved to a grassy back in one)\nHere's the worst part...the dive bar gets crowds at night and they allow them to park up into the campground.  Supposedly they have security in the front but we drove right past them coming back one night.  One afternoon, I went into my cooler to find out that beer and wine were stolen from it...no doubt from the drunks leaving the bar.  This was a first for me.  It forced us to clean up everything we had outside, put it away and lock all of our storage compartments. \nThis campground appears to be a 1 night stay over place on your way to somewhere else.  I suppose it's ok for that, just don't leave anything outside and make sure you get a site WAY in the back so you don't hear the motorcycles and cars starting at 2am when everyone leaves the bar.

Definitely try the juice blend - you won't look at orange and cranberry juice the same way again. \n- The company: On the weekend we were there, we (late 20s/early 30s) had the pleasure of staying with younger groups of people.

Earlier this year, I had a one-bedroom suite for almost three months.  A family member was in the hospital at UW-Madison during this time and this hotel was more than accommodating for the specific needs in our situation.\n\nI'm not going to go into the specific details of the accommodations partly to protect individual privacy.  The other reason not to get so detailed is simply because I think the staff went so far out of their way that these \"favors\" may potentially be abused by other guests if they were aware of the extreme kindness.  \n\nAs I mentioned, this hotel offered many special accommodations.  This allowed us to truly  feel like we had a \"home away from home\".  Most of the staff knew me by name.  They were sensitive to the fact that I had a loved one who was in the hospital and critically ill. I wasn't alone in this, though.  There were many other guests in a similar (if not same) situation as me.  This hotel could be a pilot for partnering up with hospitals in a win, win, win scenario that benefits the hotel, hospital, and the guest/patient.  In addition, I would not be surprised if they have special training for their staff in the area of customer service and handling special accommodations.  \n\nThe manager, Brad, is visible and on-site on a regular basis.  He and his staff organize and manage a social for their guests three nights a week.  The social offers a free meal and drinks (including beer and wine) for a couple hours in the evening. And, as the name describes, it allows their guests an excellent opportunity to socialize.  \n\nThere are several hotel options recommended by UW and we tried three of them.  This one may be five miles away from the main UW hospital, but it is a straight shot along University Avenue.  Now that UW purchased the Best Western Intowner, there is much more of a push with them recommending their newly owned property to UW patients.  The Intowner is fine, but the best thing going for it is how close it is to the hospital. The Staybridge-Middleton, outshines them in so may ways - indoor pool, hot tub, laundry facility, garage, large suites, kitchenettes, socials, breakfast buffet,and most of all...the staff.\n\nUnfortunately, I can not remember all the names of the staff that I would love to thank.  Our housekeeper was perfect.  She cleaned only when we needed it and got to know our preferences.  For instance, she asked if we could use an extra box of Kleenex because she remembered us requesting an extra box the week before.  She always did a great job cleaning and freshening up our room and never invaded our space. \n\nI noticed how well the staff work together as a team and support each other when the need arises.  It's obvious that the staff members are cross-trained to manage various work areas and different shifts.  For instance, I first met Bonnie on the shuttle.  She arrived at UW Hospital to pick me up.  She even showed me a quicker route back to the hotel during rush hour.  During my stay, I also saw Bonnie at the front desk, at the breakfast buffet, in the kitchen area, in the dining area, managing the socials, and even came to our suite to fix the television!  It turned out that the remote needed new batteries - which she was prepared for.\n\nI also feel like I got to know Ana pretty well since she worked the breakfast buffet many mornings.  Between her and Bonnie, I just don't know how they always seem to make everything run so smoothly.  \n\nThere is another lady with short blonde hair (sorry, I can't seem to remember her name)  that always worked the socials.  She was so welcoming and learned what I like to eat and drink.  She even encouraged me to take food \"to-go\"  when I needed to rush back to the hospital.  It was like being with family.\n\nJan, Justin and Bobby are always a pleasure at the front desk.  Not only are they welcoming, but they go out their way to get answers to your questions and take care of any requests.  \n\nMy final comments are definitely not the least important.  During my stay, I noticed that there was a team of about three housekeeping staff members who appeared to have cognitive/mental disabilities.  I was so pleased to see this and know that this hotel and the manager recognize the need to utilize talents that are so often overlooked. There may have been moments of inconvenience for the guests or perhaps mistakes made by these staff members.  However, this is how they learn and become an integral part of society.  I commend Brad Cook for making diversity a priority.\n\nUntil my next stay...", "business_id": "rKNtd_M2kWDW8sQKYzetKA", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-06-04", "type": "review"}

We were super excited to get a \"3.5star plus\" hotel for a really good deal. It's too bad there were so many things that worked against making this a truly awesome hotel: \n\n- The fact that there is no carpet between the pool and the elevators, so the floor is often dangerously wet. \n- The fact that the bathroom door opened onto the toilet - you had to sidestep it in order to close the door. \n- The fact that the night desk clerk, when counting the register, set the cash tray on the counter nearest the customers. It would have been an easy, quick jaunt out the front door with it.\n- The 20min it took to get extra towels\n- The empty ice bin in the vending area\n- The desk clerk who came out to talk to customers while still chewing food\n\nBy far the worst offense was the fact that check-out time was noon, yet housekeeping tried to enter our room at EIGHT IN THE MORNING. I can't imagine it's that hard to find out which rooms are ready for cleaning, and which are not. \n\nThe only real pro was the bedding, which was luxe and fluffy.

I've logged over 50 nights at this hotel so I think I'm decently qualified to offer a balanced review.  This last stay will be my last overall.  Although the staff is generally friendly & professional, their competence is questionable.  I could offer a list of offenses but it would take too long & most aren't major, just a little annoying. Concierge lounge is fine, no complaints.  Overall, the hotel gives the impression that it is too large for its operating budget and the competence of the staff.  It greatly lacks attention to detail.  I frequently have to call for things that have been left out of the room (missing hairdryer, washcloths, double body wash but no shampoo...and so on).   The linens are old and tired (holes in the sheets & duvet covers, limp towels, some with stains).  I am a platinum member of Marriott and am always booked into a King room.  This time, they put me in a room with 2 doubles for no reason.  I immediately changed rooms and the TV did not work.  I then plugged my laptop into the lamp and it made a loud \"pop\" and blue sparks came out.  All of the power in the room was then knocked out.  This is unacceptable, as the wiring in that lamp was obviously faulty & dangerous.  I was lucky my computer was not fried.  The last straw came when I killed a large fly in the room with the first thing I could grab, which was the paper breakfast menu.  I then crumpled the menu and threw it away.  The next day, the housekeeper had removed the menu from the garbage can and placed it on my pillow.  I know it was the same menu b/c it was creased exactly where I crumpled it up.  Outrageous.  Anyone who would think this is acceptable service is out of their mind.  I will not stay here again and do not recommend it for business travelers.  During a single stay, I have never heard so many staff say, \"I apologize for that\".  Sorry isn't enough, I'll be trying the Hilton Garden Inn next time.

Airport hotels tend to be very outdated and there is typically little incentive to do a renovation because the hotel has a steady stream of customers due to its proximity to the airport and convenience of airport shuttle transportation.  This Marriott has a similar look as the Philadelphia Airport Renaissance.  Both hotels feature an open atrium that goes up 9 to 12 levels high.  You do get a nice look onto the open atrium as you ascend on the quick glass elevators at this property.\n\nUnfortunately, this hotel is very out-of-date.  The lobby and cafe looks like something from the early to mid-80s.  The rooms are a little more contemporary though parts very dated; at the kitchenette sink, there was a bottom cabinet that may have been a dishwasher at one time; instead, it was empty with lots of dust and exposed piping (not nice to find at any hotel).\n\nThe breakfast buffet did not inspire freshness either.  The food quality was not horrible, but a lot of the food was quite salty.  Food options included bacon, sausage, breakfast potatoes, scrambled eggs, smoked salmon, continental breakfast options, and an omelet bar.  In addition, the poor lighting in the lobby and throughout the hotel made the food and other stuff maybe feel worse than they actually were.\n\nThis Marriott is still a comfortable place to stay and has good customer service.  The rooms are comfortable with good beds and linen.  The room temperature was fine though the unit did not seem to consistently keep the room cool.  The shower was fine.\n\nThis Marriott has many suites so you have a good shot of getting upgraded if you are a Marriott Rewards Gold or Platinum member.  The suites are spacious and the bedroom is separated from the living room area with a door.  Their suites are outfitted with a mini fridge, kitchen sink (as mentioned) and a microwave.\n\nOn weekends, Marriott Rewards Gold and Platinum members get an offer of full breakfast buffet for two per Saturday and Sunday or 750 Marriott Rewards points per Saturday and Sunday.  This is a new nationwide Marriott benefit for Marriott Rewards Gold and Platinum members and the hotel is only obligated to offer a continental breakfast.  I have been to a few properties (Santa Clara Marriott, Minneapolis Marriott City Center) that are only doing the bare minimum--continental breakfast--so this Marriott is definitely going above and beyond in this area (though the quality of the full breakfast buffet, as already mentioned, was not that great).\n\nThe front desk was nice and helpful.\n\nRoom rates are good, but this hotel is not in Downtown Madison.  It is only a 7 to 10 minute drive to Madison though.  However, I am not sure if getting to Downtown Madison on a Wisconsin football game day is challenging.\n\nThis Marriott would not be a good property for a long stay.  This hotel just does not feel fresh enough.  It is a comfortable enough spot for a short stay though due to their comfortable rooms and good service.  If you are a Marriott Rewards Gold or Platinum member, they do treat you well here and maybe even better than some Marriott properties.\n\nThis Marriott has its own free parking lot.

I found this La Quinta because it was a comfortable halfway point along our vacation route, and it takes pets for free.  FREE.  We have paid up to $100 for our two dogs to stay for one night in other hotels, so the reason I booked was completely out of value. When we arrived, we noticed that all of the hotels in Champaign are basically near the mall, and on this same block, so why pay more when you can have the location affordably?\n\nThen I read about a previous issue bedbugs, as we drove into town. Now bedbugs are common in hotels, and they can't treat for them until they know about them.  The problem is people who go from one hotel to the next don't even know there were bedbugs in the previous hotel, until it's too late, and they have spread.  There were no bedbugs in our room, and the certificate from the health inspector was clearly displayed (with tape) in the front lobby window, which helped ease my mind.  My OCD was on fire, though, and I kept itching all of my mosquito bites from vacation for the first few hours. \n\nWhen we got to our king suite, I was pleasantly surprised.  The decor was current, the carpets and bedding were all very new (I did a bedbug check and found only a few hairs and minimal lint under the edge seam of the king bed and pull-out sofa mattresses. The TV worked well- better than some nicer hotels, and there was one in each room.  The bathroom was basic, with a 2-in-1 shampoo/conditioner, and a soap for each sink and shower. Pretty clean.\n\nIt looks like an airport meets Target.  I don't know how better to describe it.  Artwork is generic photographs of leaves, train tracks, wood, things from nature. Walls are stucco-textured. Outdoor landscaping is almost nil, but the pool was very clean and had dated patio furniture, with ashtrays on tables. We found a long strip of \"poop patch\" for our dogs along Neil Rd., but there was litter EVERYWHERE, including broken glass, so keep that in mind.  It looks like the landscapers just mow right over the garbage people throw from their cars. \n\nI slept really well on the bed and pillows, and the in-room fridge kept our beer and gogurts cold. Breakfast the following morning was great for the kids- two waffle irons for like 120 people made for a very tight breakfast area, and the coffee was extremely weak, but was changed out and improved once I mentioned it to the service staff. \n\nI'd give the spot a \"totally fine\" overall.

My boyfriend and I live in AZ and he wanted to celebrate his birthday by having a staycation downtown so we could have fun with family and friends without worrying about a way to get home at the end of the night.

From the moment we got to the hotel to the time we checked out, our stay was anything from dissappointing. The staff was nice and let us check In early. Before we parked we talked to the valet service and asked for advice on parking. They could have given us excuses to use their service but instead, they pointed across the street and let us know that on the weekends, parking in those spots were free. Awesome! Free parking. \n\nOnce we got to our room, everything was clean and the room was a nice temperature. The rooms are small and the bathroom is even smaller but I didn't expect anything else. Its a little ridiculous how many people complained about the raised up part of the floor you have to step over to get in the shower. Wahhh. I barely noticed it, and anyone with a brain should have no problems stepping over it. Also, the shower does fluctuate in temperature when someone flushes a toilet, but it was never an unbearable cold or heat. Once we got settled in we went to the pool, its a cute little pool but by the time we got out there the sun was covered by the building surrounding it, so that was a bummer. \n\nFor lunch, we went next door to McCaffery's. They have great food and our bartender was great. \n\nHonestly, I have no complaints about our stay. Its a cute little hotel and for staying on a Saturday night, there were no dramatic noises going on and I didn't hear anyone talking in another room, having sex, or going to the bathroom.

That's so 10 years ago, but there are still some out there who do it. The free breakfast was nice and helped to keep the cost of the trip down, my only gripe was that the waffle machine destroyed your waffle, no matter how much non stick spray you applied to it. \n\nMy other gripe is the AC unit in our room. I'm not exactly sure what was wrong with it, but every time ti kicked on it woke both of us up, which is not exactly something you want when you are only getting about 5 hours of sleep. \n\nOverall, this place was pretty good. Close to the airport and freeway, lots of free amenities make this place A-ok in my book.", "business_id": "CfzoA3TQ8YQcFTOncJFbQQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-08-10", "type": "review"}

Super close to the airport and the price was right. \nStayed here for one night on 6/14. My friend had already checked in earlier than I did since my flight was coming in later that evening. \nThe property was clean,  the room was nice and comfy, the shuttle driver that evening was sooo very polite/nice/helpful &  the breakfast was perfect for our road trip up to Sedona.\nMy huge complaint and the reason for a 2 star. I called a few days before my arrival asking about the airport shuttle:\n1.) What do I do when I get into Phoenix Airport to notify I need a pick up? The clerk says just call when you get in and we'll pick you up\n2.) Is there any fee? She said no \"complementary for guest\" but, tip is not included. \nOkay great that's super easy. \nI get in around 10pm and I did exactly what the clerk told me.  I called the front desk but,  at first no answer.  I called my girlfriend having to see if anyone is at the front desk and I call again then Sam, front desk answers.. I'm super happy someone picked up and I told him I need a shuttle pick up and I'm at Terminal 3. Now,  this is my first time here at Phoenix Airport.  Sam tells me I need to get my luggage and figure out how to get to Terminal 4, door 1. So Of Course I asked where is Terminal 4, I'm at Terminal 3. He said I have to ask and figure that part out. But, I'm sending my driver now over to Terminal 4, door 1. Ok,  I asked one of the airport workers if they could help me find Terminal 4. They told me it's about 20 minutes from here. I have to walk up to the 2nd floor, catch a Tran that'll take me to Terminal 4. Walk down this long hallway and I'll be at my destination. \nI finally get to terminal 4, door 1 took me about 20-30minutes. I see the shuttle bus and wave him down,  I'm exhausted coming from a 6 hr flight,  my legs are tired,  and I'm happy to see the driver.  I apologized to him telling him so sorry I was at Terminal 3 and this is my first time here at the airport.  Sam told me to go to Terminal 4 and the driver was questioning why?  And I had no clue just thought it was the standard pick up area. The driver told me he could of picked me up at Terminal 3 and not have me walk/Tran this long. \nSo I checked in with Sam and we (the driver/I) asked Sam why didn't he have the pick up at Terminal 3. No remorse on his face,  no apologies only a straight face saying \"well you friend called and said to have the shuttle pick you up at baggage claim\" so I was in no mood in complaining super exhausted, it's about 11-11:15pm already,  and just wanted to crash, deal with this later.\nHowever,  when we woke up the next morning to have breakfast I did let the front desk know about my experience. \nNow,  this is what should of took place prior to my Phone call\n1.) They should of asked if this is my first time to the Phoenix area?\nIf so,  they should of explained more details of where to go and they should of inquired more details of my flight to see what terminal I would be coming in\n2.) Sam should of accommodate me as soon as I said \"I'm at Terminal 3\" and not make it difficult for me to go out of my way to accommodate him. \n3.) Professionally Sam should of apologized to me and the driver for his inconsistency information\n4.) Being that it was dark and late Sam should of at least escorted me to the building instead of having me tryna find my way in a dark alley... no lights to direct your path and kinda scary for females in an unknown area\n\nWould I stay here again if ever travel back to Phoenix probably not", "business_id": "LO3uvzhh3fUtEQD3AJUxWw", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-06-26", "type": "review"}

Enterprise had no problems with my reservation and they had a driver pick me up from my apartment (providing an hour window) and straight to the rental car location.  \n\nThe actual location is very clean so they apparently really stepped up their game.  Its definitely not as chaotic as a airport rental company and the car they selected was clean and pretty impressive for a Hyundai.  The attendant also reviewed the entire exterior of the car with me before sending me on my merry way.  Returning the vehicle was also straight-forward.  Since I had to catch a flight immediately after returning my rental, they gave me 2 options: (1) Call earlier that day and schedule someone to drive me to Skytrain for free, (2) Call 10 minutes beforehand and they arrange to have a taxi waiting.  Since I did not want to risk taking the Skytrain for the first time, I opted for the taxi and they gave me an agreement slip which made the cab ride a $12 flat rate (the meter read around $12.60 so I saved some spare change).\n\nOverall, everyone was professional and friendly and I would highly recommend renting a car from this location.  As corny as this may sound, this is truly one of the best rental car companies I have come across.\n\nOne tip: I believe the hours listed on Yelp indicate that they open at 7:30 AM.

I just got back from a 5 day trip to Phoenix.  The hotel staff is extremely helpful and always has a smile on their face.  The atmosphere was very quite and relaxing.  My room was very clean and well kept, kudos to the hotel maid  and housekeeping staff!!!  The hotel has a shuttle service which took me to and picked me up from the convention center.  Very convenient.  \n\nWhen there I just decided to eat at the hotel restaurant.  Since the hotel was pretty quite you could hear the water falling from the waterfall which is very relaxing.  The only complaint I have is that the service though good could have been better.  It is seat yourself (which is great) however a couple times I sat there for about 10 minutes before someone came over to me.  Once they realized I was there I was taken care of.  The food was pretty good, didn't really like the pulled pork sandwich.\n\nAll in all, I really like this hotel and would definitely stay there again.", "business_id": "urBWfXQjyyWIO5B7FvnOpg", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-07-28", "type": "review"}

Hoped to relax. \n\nSeemed like friendly staff. Sat at bar.  I didn't order alcohol because I'm pregnant. Ordered a pineapple juice. Maybe that's like a big FU to bartenders. \n\nAsked if anything on TV on other side of bar besides fox news. It was so hateful and such lies.  Bar/banquet manager said he and the server standing next to him loved fox news.  Not sure if they were joking,  but then he said,  we can put it on Sesame Street. What was that about? \n\nOrdered Chilled shrimp and avocado cocktail.  Normally $12. Thank goodness paid during half off.  Avocado only a thin smear of puree on bottom. A few Lettuce pieces drenched in white sour sauce. (that I didn't mind being pregnant) Only 4 shrimp.  (I ate one before I realized first picture didn't take.  Maybe that is my Yelp legacy,  pictures with one bite missing. \nBut yeah,  not even worth half price of $6.  Menu says chunky tomato compote.  That was nowhere to be found on the plate. \n\nSweet pea soup.  Only saving grace,  it was only $4. \nSays served with crispy croutons.  Um,  maybe before laid on the soup.  more like thin waffle fry chips reduced to soggy mess. Needed to be strained,  I think it was just ground up whole peas with no spices. \n\nWaited to try and get a refill on juice to wash out nasty tastes.

I was worried that it wouldn't be enough food, but by the time the dessert course rolls around, you will be plenty full.  The scones are the best, they are served with clotted cream, raspberry jam and lemon curd.  Simply decadent and heavenly.  The piano player adds a nice touch.

I'd like to paste in a sixth star for this one but Yelp! won't let me. \n\nI spent three nights here and from the moment of arrival I was astounded at the high level of customer service. Everything from the little things to the big ones are taken care of and they go above and beyond.\n\nI pulled up in my rental car, handed it over to the valet, and he asked my name. I gave it along with the keys and walked inside to check in. Before I even reached the check-in counter I was greeted by name and welcomed (way to go, Mr Valet, radioing ahead like that. Pretty slick. I didn't even see your radio.). Free lemon water and snacks await in the very nicely-apportioned lobby. I didn't try any but they looked nice sitting there like an oasis in the middle of the desert. \n\nRooms were also well furnished and roomy with great views of the surrounding areas. There is also an in-room safe which I always need for my valuables. Not. I don't even have any valuables that aren't actual living creatures. Like a few humans and a dog...but I digress...\n\nAbout the service...okay so keep in mind I'm basically a blue collar guy living a white collar life. It can be pretty confusing for me at times. And I suffer an identity crisis in places like this. Like, for example, when I see staff running for the front door to open it for me each and every time, I want to beat them to it. I want to say \"Chill out, young man. I open my own doors.\" \n\nBut they are quite determined and it became a bit of a competition between me and the doormen to see who could get there first. By about the middle of my stay, I learned how to time it right so that when they were distracted I'd sneak up and open it myself. I often managed to beat them to the outer door, but then they'd slip inside and open the inner door for me. \n\nRats. Foiled again.\n\nEvery time I walked out of the hotel they asked what they could do for me. Need a ride? Directions? Coming out for a smoke? We'd be happy to light it for you. Interested in a cigar? Can I have a drink brought out for you? \n\nNo. I just want to experience the dry heat. Leave me be! \n\nBut it's all good. If you want, you could just act like you're accustomed to such royal treatment and say something like \"Very well done, Andrew. A little faster with that door next time would be simply fabulous.\"\n\nBut I couldn't do that with a straight face. \n\nLet's see...local area is very nice. The Biltmore Shopping Center is right across the street. You're there in about five minutes (walking). It contains a high end outdoor shopping center with many restaurant choices, including some chains you'll recognize and a few local options. \n\nAn earlier reviewer mentioned the desk chair in the room looks like a fugitive from a dining room, not really an office chair. I thought this was funny when I saw the chair in my room because he was right. I've included a photo of the \"fugitive chair\" just for laughs. But for a fugitive, it is a comfortable chair. It's okay, Ritz. We'll let this one slide.\n\nAt the end of your stay, they call you in the room to ask how your visit was and if they could improve anything. At first I thought it was a recording but then the person said my name and waited for my response. So I'm really glad I didn't make a sarcastic comment while she was talking at first (like I usually do). But wow...how much time must that take to call each room? \n\nPretty impressive.", "business_id": "HLQUH1VAw4KbSV-IhxOPEw", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-06-02", "type": "review"}

I recently visited the Ritz Carlton for a high tea lunch. When my Mom and I arrived, we realized that we were the only two guests who had made a reservation for high tea and we started to think twice about having high tea. While we were in the midst of contemplating our decision, Jeffrey walked up to us with a smile on his face. He was so friendly and welcoming and encouraged us to do high tea. He was so welcoming that we immediately made up our mind and started our very own private high tea experience! Although we were the only two guests doing high tea, they still \"put on the Ritz\" for us by bringing in Jeffrey to serve us and a pianist to play the baby grand piano during our tea. We felt like royalty! \n\nJeffrey isn't a server. He is in charge of the high tea and incredibly experienced. He is a tea sommelier and in fact, makes the teas they serve himself! After seating us, Jeffrey went over the tea menu with us. Knowing that we were in the presence of an expert, we asked Jeffrey to take the lead and pick the three teas for our adventure. Our first course included a variety of tea sandwiches along with our first tea which was a peach tea. We leisurely enjoyed our tea and sandwiches and enjoyed the beautiful piano music. Because we were the only high tea guests, we had the undivided attention of Jeffrey which was a treat in itself. The second course consisted of delicious scones and three different jams presented in chocolate contains that we could eat! It was truly delectable. The tea to accompany that course was an herbal raspberry tea. Our final course was a three tier tray of small deserts, some of which were infused with the house-made teas! We enjoyed chocolate chai tea with this course. Every bite was delicious and the entire experience was girly, classy and royal. \n\nThere's a reason the Ritz Carlton coined the phrase \"putting on the Ritz.\" Even though we were the only two guests who reserved high tea, they still pulled out all the stops and treated us like royalty. Jeffrey knows the secret to customer service and because he walked over and made us feel welcome, we stayed and ultimately had an experience that I will always remember. \n\n**** Note: they do several events throughout the year to go with high tea, including ladies social events, hat events, etc. Keep an eye on their calendar so you too can \"put on the Ritz!\"", "business_id": "HLQUH1VAw4KbSV-IhxOPEw", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-06-08", "type": "review"}

It was a sweet affair-- Sophi got to dress up and I had the pleasure of serving as her first date.  Jeffrey, the tea sommelier (yes, TEA sommelier) was very kind and attentive to us dads in attendance.  He described the options, then my daughter and I chatted of tea, snacks, and little desserts.  It was a joy to watch her smile and excitement beam through. And when Jeffrey sang Butterfly Kisses, I and another dad were choking back tears as inconspicuously as possible-- \"My what fine crown molding up there on the ceiling.  Ah-hem!  Yes, fine workmanship!\"  \n\nFather-Daughter High Tea at the Ritz is one of Phoenix's quiet gems on an experience.\n\nThis past weekend, I was there again, but for a conference.  Very attentive staff as is the standard at the Ritz.  Even though it's somewhat hidden, the facilities are maintained well and the conference was a supremely comfortable experience.

The room is surrounded by glass and only part of it is frosted so it's easy for guests walking around to see in.\n3.  Most of the staff was pretty friendly during both of my visits.  However, during my most-recent visit, my husband called to request for more hand-towels (we wanted to use them for the fitness center not knowing that they are already provided inside).  I should've asked for the woman's name but when she delivered the towels she was extremely rude.  She didn't smile or say hi, which was no biggie, but she delivered bath towels.  Again, no biggie, we ended up needing them anyway but when I nicely told her that we had requested the smaller hand-towels, she rolled her eyes, started speaking into her radio and walked away.  Wow!  She came back 10 minutes later, again, no smile or hello, no apology but this time with face-towels (the small square ones).  Oh well.", "business_id": "FQudBiBiz9bGQLF_kK8UCg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-08-20", "type": "review"}

We checked in late and got our choice of rooms. Summer is off season for Phoenix, so you can snag some good deals.\n\nWe got a suite on the top floor (no heavy stompers above) with a view of the pool. I only ever have one request when choosing a hotel, no matter the region and that's a pool. I love to swim and spend my days tanning poolside and at night - taking a swim after dinner and before bed. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XFp3kd2f0TIC5rLAnIIOAA#tVE5NMyVymqDfFGavl5aIg\n\nOur room was really nice with a livingroom with kitchenette, bathroom and bedroom with a balcony. You can really make yourself feel at home and that's just what we did. Stock your own fridge with beverages and snacks, heat things up in the microwave and make yourself coffee and tea in the morning. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XFp3kd2f0TIC5rLAnIIOAA#C8_Wxh9oVUyFRpPPBNohyQ\n\nEach morning you can expect a free complimentary breakfast buffet. They have a omelete bar, so you select your ingrediants and get what you want. They have a wide variety of breakfast choices, so you can have whatever you want. This is mine. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XFp3kd2f0TIC5rLAnIIOAA#0kBypK_17X-X6tWGg6dRfg\n\nMost days I was out and about and others I spent at the pool. I ordered drinks and lunch from Omaha Steakhouse, which was quite tasty. I really took advantage of the hotel ammenties and enjoyed my stay. \n\nEach night they have a Manager's Reception that provides a free Happy Hour to guests. Drinks of your choice from cocktails, wine, beer to soft drinks. The snacks included pretzel bites, chips, dips, hummus and pita chips. \n\nI always enjoy staying at the Embassy Suites and had a great vacation.

Everything was about 10-15 min away in every direction.  Also, Biltmore Fashion Plaza and AMC Dine-in Theater are across the street so there are definitely things to do even within walking distance.\n  \nThe hotel is about 5 stories high, has Omaha Steaks restaurant in it, a sizable gym, nice looking outdoor pool, a nice indoor koi pond and lots of areas in the atrium to sit/hang/eat. \n\nStaff (with the exception of Edith - which i'll get to that later) were very welcoming and friendly.\n\nThe hotel itself is older and definitely shows in it's appearance.  It's very outdated.  The carpet getting to our rooms were very worn and needs to be replaced.  You can actually see a stark contrast in what the carpet USED to look along the edges of the pathway.  The first room we were given smelled like urine!  Front desk immediately rectified that issue and switched us to another room a few doors down that smelled fresh.  \n\nThe living room area was bit outdated with mismatched furniture and curtains.  I didn't understand what the theme was or how it was all supposed to tie in together. \n\nI was quite surprised to find the condition of the bathroom the way it was.  Visibly it appeared clean, however, there were many things over looked... there was mold in the grout, a crack in the sink that had a small hole in it that water was seeping through.  You can't get to the sink because the sink unit closes it off.  I can just imagine what mold in it!  The bedroom light fixtures did not turn on.  You had to walk into the dark room and turn on the light in the middle of the room to see.\n\nThe Manager's Reception was fine. The snacks were an interesting combo. Stick carrots, broccoli florets, ranch dressing, some interesting looking coleslaw, Fritos corn chips, onion dip and pop corn.\n\nIan the bartender was AWESOME!  I haven't had a drink in maaaaaaaaaaany years, so I let him choose a cocktail for me.  It was a Mai Tai.  It was really great and perfectly made.  Hubby and I wanted a hole in the wall local place to eat and he suggested a few to us.  He also confirmed what every other Phx local said - Nogales Hot Dogs has the best hot dogs!  We ended up there for a late dinner food run! YUM! \n\nAll the hot breakfast items were behind the counter so you placed your order with Edith and she made your omlette and asked you what else you'd like.  She makes a super mean (literally) but tasty omlette.  \n\nNormally, rude people just roll off my back, but in the customer service industry, there is no room or excuse for it.  Edith was the first staff member I saw Monday morning and she was outrightly rude to me, rolling her eyes and shaking her head, all because I asked her what other hot items were available.  WOW!  It was the last day I was getting to spend with my son before his school year started so I was already bummed but thinking good thoughts.  I gave her the benefit of the doubt and thought maybe she was having a bad day herself... but still not cool.  It threw off my good-vibes morning flow for a bit.\n\nThis stay was just OK.  Not what I've come to know for Hilton, though.\n\nIn all honesty, all those issues (not including Edith) really aren't a big deal.  I've stayed in \"OMG! check-out-in-the-middle-of-the-night\" bad motels to luxurious deep pocket resorts.. Every brand has a standard and at the very least, you should be able to expect that standard when you stay.\n\nAt this particular stay, I had the expectation of the Embassy Suites standard and experiencing something other than that was very disappointing.  Even though I didn't enjoy my stay, I'm sure I'll be back.  It's a great location and walking distance from shopping and entertainment.

There was freshly cut fruit and condiments of all kinds.  The best part was the made-to-order grill.  Delicious omelets with fresh veges, french toast, sausage, bacon, pancakes, and actual eggs were all made fresh in front of your eyes.\n2) Well stocked gym.  It had many treadmills and ellipticals.  Free weights were also available which is kinda rare in hotels these days.\n3) Shuttle bus was free and the driver could take you anywhere in a 3 mile radius including the airport.  He was even kind enough to pick me up at the baseball stadium even though it was out of the operating range.\n\nCons:\n1) $5 / day parking fee.\n2) My room smelled like the guy before smoked in there\n3) The hot water in the shower took forever to heat up.  It was about 5 minutes, no joke.  I could've sworn the hotel ran out of hot water.\n4) The card key readers were finicky at best.  It took at least 3 tries before I was able to open my door.  Pulling it out at different speeds didn't matter\n5) The internet was also finicky.  First of all it was not free except for Hilton Gold and above members.  The internet wasn't fast and the connection would die quite often.  The wifi was so weak in the bedroom that I gave up trying to use it in there.\n6) Very little counter top space at the bathroom sink.", "business_id": "-nWigG5EhFLjdSgGZthS3Q", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-08-26", "type": "review"}

Our room was a large casita at the corner of the property, resulting in a very quiet and private experience.  Walking around the resort, you feel like you're really (as lame as it sounds typing this) in an \"oasis in the desert.\"  The other guests have those silly, serene looks stuck to their faces.  The staff is always smiling.  Everything just seems so...leisurely.\n\nDon't even get me started on T. Cook's.  The service and food are impeccable.  At first, the portions may seem a little smaller than you're used to, but the flavors more than make up for this.

We loved our rooms and that they were located in small casitas and not a huge block hotel. The landscaping and grounds are absolutely beautiful.

Cooks restaurant was extremely good and has been one of the best meals I've had in the Phoenix area. \n\nWe spent a day at the spa and enjoyed ourselves. The facilities are small and very pretty. We were asked to wait in the 'relaxation area' between treatments.  It was a lovely area with nice chairs, drinks etc... The very surprising thing was that it was basically the only place people could walk through, so it ended up being the least relaxing place. Every few minutes some one from the staff has to walk through the room to get from the treatment area to the front desk. Once someone even brought what looked like large laundry bags through.  It was a beautiful place and our treatments were great.  I just think the layout and timing of maintenance needs to be rethought.\n\nFrustrations: Check in and check out was slow.  The 'front desk' area is very quaint but too small when several people are needing attention at once.  Plan to wait a while if there is anyone else waiting.  The resort made several mistakes on our bill. They fixed it but only because we caught it. Also, when we came back to our room one afternoon our door was ajar.  We checked the room and nothing was missing.  We called resort security and they were able to trace back who last opened the door with their key card (a resort employee).  It was all ok, but we could have lost our jewelry or laptop if someone had decided to take advantage of the open door.\n\nI loved the food and beauty of the resort, but I don't think I'd stay here again because of the slow check in and out and the security problem.", "business_id": "rLAeltELaGdQKh_LYIllEA", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-07-22", "type": "review"}

My wedding reception was at Royal Palms almost 10 years ago...if I could have Yelped then it would have definitely been 5 Stars.  Have stayed many times over the years and have always enjoyed returning to this special place...I would classify all as 4-5 star caliber visits.  The property remains beautiful and the location can't be beat.  Most recently returned for my wife's birthday this past weekend.  It was once again a terrific weekend, but there's clearly room for improvement.\n\nPro:\n1. Beautiful property - perfect location\n2. Great room (designer casita #118)\n3. Good service\n4. \"Surprise\" birthday dessert in room was a nice touch\n\nCon:\n1. Time to jazz up the pool area: one poor server running around like a chicken sans head does not make for a relaxing environment...and the little shack of a bar does not exude opulence.  Try to be more like a miniature version of the Scottsdale Four Seasons Pool area.\n2. T'Cookes has not recaptured it's mojo from the glory years gone by - good service and food, but it used to be head and shoulders above typical resort fare.  (this could be another review if I had time).  \n3. They ran out of souvineer coffee mugs - this in and of itself is no big deal, in fact they gave us a token discount on a set removed from a room.  This would have been much more appreciated if we didn't find coffee residue in the mugs when we got home.  Not the end of the world, but annoying nevertheless.  \n4. $25 \"Resort Fee\" is irritating.  These nickel-dime charges and fees everywhere you turn these days are really getting out-of-control.  I'd rather pay the advertised price and take care of my own tips and such.  \n\nOverall, I'd say 3.5...rounding down in this case.\n\n**************************\n8/24: Updating from original 3 star level.  After reflecting on all the hapiness that Royal Palms has brought into my life, I just can't leave this as 3 stars.  The place deserves four...kind of like a lifetime achievement award.  I wrote the original review the day after consuming 4 lemon drops by the RP pool, a Boodles martini and an Anchor Steam at the Jade bar, wine and Irish Coffee at dinner at T'Cooks, a bottle of Champagne in the room, and a bloody mary and another anchor steam at brunch the next morning at Dick's Hideaway.

I was quickly checked in and given all of the information that I needed.  Afterwards, the bell man/valet come to escort you to your room with a quick overview of the property.  After walking me to my Terrace Casita Room, he did everything from lay out my suitcase to fill my ice bucket.  The best thing about their wonderful service is that all of the tipping (except restaurant & spa) is included with the resort fee ($30 per day).  \n\nThe room (210) was marvelous!  We enjoyed the soaking tub that was so deep, I kept slipping under water =) as well as the huge shower, comfy king sized bed and our nice little patio.  We had a chance to take a swim in the pool as well and while there were several people out, it wasn't too crowded just yet.  I love their turn-down service (when do they even come in?!?), the yummy candies and bottled water they leave bedside and the concierge.  We booked last minute reservations through Mona at a swank French restaurant (separate review) and had no issues.  We were even given a complimentary glass of champagne as thanks to her sending us over. \n\nI genuinely loved just about everything here.  The grounds are quiet and well appointed and the hotel is close to some great shopping and fine-dining.  \n\nIf I had to fuss it would be to say that our toilet in our bathroom kept running.  After a couple of jiggles of the handle it was all fine so no real complaints there.  We also went to T. Cooks Lounge around 10pm one night but was a little disappointed that we missed the live entertainment for the night.  The food and drinks there were just okay and we ended up sending one item back (smoked brie).

I was more than thrilled when I found out we would be spending two nights there! \n\nSince my fianc\u00e9 had to work one of the days, he invited my girlfriends to accompany me to the hotel pool. Upon arriving, the resort was as impressive as I had hoped for and we were greeted nicely by the valet service. We asked for self parking and was directed to go down to the garage located nearby. The other two cars ended up using valet but they weren't offered the self parking option and ended up tipping the valet. No big deal but the option would have been nice.\n\nThe reception area is a small room with two love seats and while intimate, it wasn't as grand as I expected. Checkin was fast but since we arrived at 9:30am I was told that we could use the pool until the room was ready and we could change in the spa. We made our way to the spa and the grounds are very beautiful. Everything is green and lush, a big contrast from the desert this time of year. There are lots of fountains and intimate seating arrangements through out the property. The spa staff was friendly but the spa did seem a bit small. The locker area was small and only two stalls with toilets and another two shower stalls. Again, this is a boutique resort though and it matched the architecture and the finishes were all nice in the area. \n\nThe pool chairs are very comfy and have large towels that won't slip down the chair.  I was surprised to see that one of the towels on my girlfriend's chair was nearly warn through in several places. That's not something you see in a five star resort.

After looking around further, I realized there aren't speakers except in the bathroom. I've never been to a resort pool without music so it was a bit... quiet. I'm all for quiet and relaxing but at times, it was TOO quite. On the second day there was a family there with their kids and it made their splashing and loud talking all the more noticeable. Also, they had three pool floaters that had definitely seen better days. I'm not sure why this resort wouldn't replace them? It seems like such a small, easy and inexpensive thing to do. Pool service was a bit sparse and several times we had to make our way to the bar to order items.  We always had to ask for everything which was unusual. Menus, towels, water....nothing seemed preemptive on their end. Additionally, the second day, the area was a mess. Towels everywhere, chairs not setup for the next guest, empty drinks on several tables. I think there was only one person working but I still wouldn't expect to see that at a resort of this caliber. There were also several ugly crows in the area that were very aggressive.  One landed on my friend as she ate her lunch and the waiter told us a story of how just the other day one dive bombed a customer and took her taco. Ummm, aren't there bird wranglers or something? \n\nOur room was ready by 12pm and we were in an upgraded Valencia Casita. We were way in the back of the property and were directly next to another resort. Upon entering the room, they did have a nice plate of chocolate fudge and fruit and said Happy Birthday on the plate. Unfortunately, my birthday wasn't until the next day but it was a nice gesture. \n\nThe room was nice but it did seem a bit dark. The ceilings were low and the exposed beams on the ceiling added to the feeling. The furnishings and the bathroom finishes were nice. The tile floors added some character and it was nice having a Keurig machine in the room.  The shower had great pressure and nice tile. Our bed was comfy but it was really high off the ground so it was a definite jump to get in. The pillows were both flat, one down and one regular cotton fill. The nightly turn down service gave you two tiny water bottles on your bedside and filled the ice bucket. On our second day, we left the room at 10am and returned at 2pm and the room had yet to be cleaned. Our turndown service came around 7:30pm the second day and left a dirty plate outside our door. \n\nOverall, the resort is nice but that's just it. Nice. For the value and the reputation, it wasn't up to my expectations. I expected to be wowed by this place but it just never happened.", "business_id": "rLAeltELaGdQKh_LYIllEA", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-06-25", "type": "review"}

You almost forget you're in Phoenix; all the plants and flowers are so lush and green. The room was cozy with a large 4 poster bed. The room had a Kuerig machine which was nice to have, even though we didn't get a chance to use it.

The resort also includes a daily resort fee so that way you don't feel obligated to tip at every turn.  All the staff were extremely polite. \nThe only issues I had was with the spa and room service. The $50 spa credit could only be used on a 50 minute service. I really wanted a pedicure and we were gonna pay out of pocket for a second pedicure so we could do it like a couples treatment but it wasn't an option. Also, it was 40+ for breakfast for the equivalent of a Denny's grand slam breakfast and it didn't come with any juice or anything just water.\n The resort fee does allow you access to the fitness center, pool, hot tub and into the spa to use the showers and eucalyptus steam room which was so refreshing and relaxing.", "business_id": "rLAeltELaGdQKh_LYIllEA", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-08-24", "type": "review"}

Maybe I'm spoiled since I travel a bit and go to southern CA once a month. \n\nHotel:\n\nPros: The valet/bus boys were SO friendly and accommodating-always smiling, upbeat and ready with a cold bottle of water as your left for your summer excursion in Phx. Jenna the customer service manager is over-the-top customer service oriented, she was SO helpful! The yoga teacher was friendly and after over a decade of doing yoga, I learned some \"new\" mudras that I found extremely helpful. Gratuity fee of $15 covers all tips so you don't have to always be reaching for your wallet. And \"Royal Palmers\" (ice cold Arnold Palmers) when you check in!\n\nCons: We reserved a Montevista Suite with a big bathtub and were \"upgraded\" to a casita, which sounds good, but was in reality a handicap room that lacked a certain charm that was situated along a walkway and had the world's shallowest one-person bathtub. When we asked to be moved to the room we actually reserved, we were told they were all taken (!!) for the night and we moved the next morning. The beds were not great and the one in the handicapped room was actually quite mushy and uncomfortable. The thermostats in the rooms can be set to lower than 72 degrees, but turn off at 72 degrees at night. Well 72 degrees sounds cool, but we needed to have a fan brought in to be cool enough to sleep (and we live in Tucson so heat is not new to us). Drinks at the pool are apparently $20 each according to our bill (!!). Yoga is outside in the mornings which during monsoon season means mosquito-central. \n\nRestaurant/Bar:\n\nPros: Chuck the bartender at the Mix Up bar was also top-notch as he chatted us up and explained the specialty drink of the day. Our waiter at T Cooks for dinner was friendly enough and the food there is great! Try the antelope or the tasting menu. \n\nCons: Can't think of any. \n\nWarning: Not knowing any better, we bought the BOGO free deal which listed room rates as $450/night with one night free came out to $225/night. The thing is the rack rate on their website for those nights was $179 and $139. So we could have saved money by getting the rack rate which I found irritating. Luckily Jenna the customer relations manager lowered our rate to the rack rate, but we had to ask and the woman who checked us out was none too happy about me asking to make sure we'd gotten the rate everyone else paid. \n\nOverall, a mid-range \"resort\" which a decent pool area, pretty gardens/grounds and at times excellent customer service. Overall I'll rate it A-OK, 3 stars. Not great, but certainly good enough (at the reduced summer prices).", "business_id": "rLAeltELaGdQKh_LYIllEA", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-07-11", "type": "review"}

My husband and I went here for an overnight stay to celebrate the fact that it was our first time away from our kids, um ever in two years (no big deal) and it was a Father's Day gift. We had booked through hotels.com and relayed the importance of our visit in the reservation. I upgraded the room to a private casita and chose the option to pay at the time of the booking, as opposed to paying later. \nImagine my surprise when, upon check-in, I am confronted immediately with,\"we need a credit card for this reservation\".  \"I thought I paid ahead, but ok....\"  The front desk attendant then informs us of the $30 resort fee and $15 overnight parking fee. Really? Y'all can't even spring for free parking for your patrons? At a so-called 4.5 star resort? Please. \nThe valet gave us a tour of the grounds and he was great. Informative, funny and honest. When we tipped him he made sure we knew that a tip was already included and wasn't necessary. We knew but he deserved the tip anyway, it was just nice of him to be honest.\n\nThe stay was nice, the room was fine and dinner was good-but for a $250 check for two people I was expecting more. But what was really great happened next. Once we got home a few days passed and I spoke to my mom. She said she was surprised she didn't hear from me for a big thank you. I asked why? Well it turned out my parents paid for our stay as a nice gesture since we never get out. Odd, I thought, considering the first thing the front desk attendant did was ask for a credit card when my parents sent their info in and wanted to pay for any other incidentals above and beyond the room. I called and talked to the front desk attendant and told her the deal. She didn't sympathize, she didn't apologize, she just transferred me to the accounting department to leave a message. The following day, Eric from accounting called me back. We figured out that my card wasn't charged but there was a $300 hold on my debit that would \"disappear in a week or so\". Now, I don't have a lot of money, so for $300 to be tied up for a week was kind of a bummer. He keep repeating the same info about booking through hotels.com and how sometimes people who pay for rooms want to remain anonymous (I was asking why I wasn't told the room was paid for, why was I even asked to present a card when that part was handled?). He was droning on and I said, \"I don't care about that, what I care about is...\" I couldn't finish my sentence because Eric from accounting interrupted me and said that if I didn't care what he was saying he couldn't help me any further. Then he HUNG UP ON ME! I mean come on! Where's the hospitality? I was furious. I wanted to be done with the shitty ordeal but my friend persuaded me to call again and let management know what happened. So I did. I told her that I didn't want anything from them, that I simply would never come back. She assured me that she would take this higher and have it corrected. With all the awesome deals in the valley during the summer why throw it away on this place?

The Grand Canyon was spectacular and Tim was so accommodating taking our pictures along the way.  \nTim was the highlight of the trip.

There were four of us on this trip and we wanted a tour to the Grand Canyon that didn't involve a huge crowd. We were picked up at our resort  in Scotttsdale at 7:30 am in a van that had  6 other passengers -- so we spent the day with this nice group. The minute we got in the van, the tour began. Princely, our guide, is a walking encyclopedia! He knows everything and is willing to share it all. As we traveled through the Sonoran Desert we learned about the desert, the different types of plants and cacti  and why they survive... We traveled through desert, mountains and farmlands... Princely knew the ins and outs and avoided traffic with his shortcuts...  We stopped in Sedona and had the opportunity to take in a couple of different vistas while there. Princely was great at making sure we had family photos -- always offering to snap shots at each stop we made. I felt like we were the only people at the Canyon upon arrival. We came in through the \"back door\" as it were -- avoiding huge crowds that enter through the main entrance. It was wonderful. Driving along the rim we saw elk feeding and Princely \"banged a u-ie\" and went back to the spot so we could take pictures. It was great! We made several stops at the Canyon to take in the beauty and views and snap lots of photos. I highly recommend Southwest Tours... We could have never done so much on our own -- it was nice to kick back, relax, listen and look! Thanks for making our day a great one!

What a dick move for an upscale hotel, right?  Well... wait wait wait HHonors member, you get exclusive access to the Executive Lounge on the 4th Floor for a lovely complimentary breakfast with eggs, potatoes, maybe some other hot foods, muffins, bagels, doughnuts, fresh coffee, juice, yogurt, and a staff member there just for you!\n\nOh, and don't forget that we have a lovely, HHonors member only evening reception with libations on the cheap and some lovely finger foods - sandwiches and such.  Relax after your long day, and partake in some CNBC or other hi-def programming on one of our HDTVs\n\nBack in your room, $9.95 for a day of Internet access?  Not so, HHonors guest!  Type in your information and we provide you 24 hours of Internet access completely gratis.  (And surprisingly, for non-free Internet access, it's not particularly fast.  I was only hitting 0.5Mb/s down)\n\nI get giving your best customers special perks, the evening reception for one, but some of these really should be perks for all guests.  I will give the Hilton Phoenix Airport a lot of credit otherwise.  The staff is incredibly friendly.  They have a complimentary shuttle that will take you to several nearby locations.  I've made a few trips to Chase Field when the shuttle drops me off and picks me back up from the 44th and Washington Valley Metro Station.\n\nThe rooms are fantastic.  Clean, well appointed (I'm sure it's those fine, European linens, Serta mattresses, and Crabtree & Evelyn soaps), HDTV in every room.  One big criticism is as of my latest trip in August 2011, they've disabled the TVs from switching to a secondary input - alas, no plugging my PlayStation 3 into an HDMI input for some gaming/movies/Netflix.  A second criticism, no mini fridge or microwave in the room.\n\nThere is an amazing fitness center.  Plenty of room, full rack of dumbbells, benches, treadmills, ellipticals, weight machine... Needless to say, it's well equipped.  The pool is also pretty big - long enough to get a few good laps in without crashing into kids.\n\nThe price on this place is always reasonable, especially compared to other hotels of its caliber in the area.  I still prefer the Doubletree up the road, but for the price, this is a decent choice if you have an HHonors membership.  Otherwise, I'd suggest trying someplace else.", "business_id": "KnRRMCqQQqlyMphif6cTaA", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-08-17", "type": "review"}

Typically we enjoy our stays at various hilton properties - for they have earned our appreciation and ratings through the years of corporate stays as working professionals.  \n\nSadly this location fell short of the high standards the hilton brand has set.\n\nWe stopped of in Phoenix for a day on our way home from a Sedona retreat.\n\nTired and hungry, we were picked up at the airport by the shuttle driver promptly and quick deposited at the hilton airport Phoenix location.\n(Good driver and prompt transport, which we both appreciated ).\n\nThe reception staff were prompt and courteous, w rapid checkin and bottled water to ease our parched throats due to the outdoor 106 degree temperature.\n\nThe Hilton hotel staffs across the board have been exemplary in Arizona - but this location has a very dated, tired decor and is need of a facelift.  The carpet leading to our room was faded and worn in places.\n\nOnce we arrive in our room, we learned our lovely balcony view overlooked the noisy freeway and parking lot and we could barely stand on it - though we wouldn't want to, given the view.  No help for that since this is a location at the airport, which we both understood.\n\nThere was also an odd, unpleasant smell in the room which dissipated eventually (though it was more resigning ourselves to the odor since we were just too tired to repack and move).\n\nWe left our bags and went down for a meal, only to learn the main restaurant was closed on Sunday afternoon at 5 pm and we could only eat in the loud and noisy sports grill, so we did.\n\nLiz our server was wonderful and would do well in a 5 star restaurant w impeccable service.  The food had good points as well as poor.  My bacon grilled chicken wrap was excellent, the steak fries accompanying it were large and underdone while my husbands steak tacos were so- so.\n\nWe turned in early due to our exhaustion and woke incredibly early, so had room service. (Very unusual for us since we are out and about early).  Rick our waiter was prompt,  bringing fresh toast due to a mishap in the kitchen, and soy milk for the coffee.\n\nUnfortunately the coffee was lukewarm (barely) and the toast, despite dressing it up w real butter and strawberry preserves, barely warm despite being brought promptly to us.\n\nThe bed was decent, but not the lovely comfort bed we expected from the Hilton brand.  The temperature was off in the room despite being set at its coolest setting, it was still quite warm, almost uncomfortably so.\n\nThis is definitely a mixed review - fantastic service and mentioned staff worthy of a 5 star resort while downgraded drastically w the decor of a dated decades past.  Food also a mixed bag, I don't think we will return to this location.", "business_id": "KnRRMCqQQqlyMphif6cTaA", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-06-02", "type": "review"}

We mixed up the directions (we're both new-ish to Phoenix) and ended up walking 16 blocks east. We then realized the place we were trying to go would be another ~50 blocks north. That obviously wasn't happening. My poor dog was not doing well. She laid down in some shade by a fried chicken joint and was panting heavily. I never would have brought her along had I known our walk was going to be so far. It was 109 degrees out. I was very concerned and didn't think she would be able to make it the 16 blocks back without getting serious heatstroke.\n\nI called Discount cab. The dispatcher told me dogs are allowed in the cabs and it would be a 5 to 20 minute wait. The cab came in less than 5 minutes and the driver was great. He was very friendly and good-natured about my Lab hopping in the backseat. He said he got dogs all the time, but would just need to take the cab to a carwash afterwards. He brought us back downtown and the entire ride, with tip, ended up being approx $8.50. Well worth it. My dog is fine, btw. ;)", "business_id": "6InaHoU8KNlDeGP48RqzBg", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-07-09", "type": "review"}

I called the nearest Best Western for a room, and they recommended Discount Cab.\n\nTalk about a day saver! When the little green cab pulled up, I almost cried tears of joy. The driver, Laura, sprang into action and loaded my bags into the trunk. I gave her the hotel's address and we were off.\n\nShe was really sweet, and we chit-chatted. Not being one to hide my emotions, she found out about how my day had gone. She asked if I'd like to stop at a store for some grub. Would I!\n\nNot only did she pull through KFC so I could order half the menu, but she dropped me off in front of Safeway so I could grab a bottle of wine (yes, it was THAT kind of day) and some provisions. We swooped back to KFC just in time to grab the food, and were off to the hotel.\n\nThen, AFTER I paid her, she waited in front of the hotel to find out where my room was so she could drive me around to the door. It gets better. She then parked and helped me carry my bags up the stairs to my room.\n\nLaura is a gem, and I am grateful that I was referred to such a great service.

I reserved a mini-van as we had considerable luggage and two small kids.  Everything was set for a 6:30 AM pick-up.  Needless to say these guys are horrible.  Here's a summary of events:\n\n6:40 - Called Yellow Cab because the cab we reserved had not arrived at our house.  I'm told that the driver is running late and will be there in 5 minutes.\n\n6:46 - Driver still not there.  Called Yellow Cab and am informed that nobody is en route and they don't know when a driver will be available to pick us up.  Two things wrong with this.  One, I had a reservation.  Two, the previous dispatcher told me someone was on there way and would be there in five minutes.  I ask Chris to secure a cab for me and call me back in five minutes to let me know when they will be at my house.\n\n6:57 - I call Yellow Cab again.  No cab.  No return phone call from Chris (the dispatcher).  At this point we are going to miss our flight if we don't jump in our car and head to the airport.\n\n7:00 - I pack up my car, put the car seats back in my car, load up the family, and start heading to the airport.\n\n7:07 - I call Yellow Cab to talk to a supervisor.  I'm put on hold for ten minutes.  I hang up because I'm tired of waiting.\n\n7:18 - I decide to give Yellow Cab one more chance to explain themselves.  I also expect them to pay for my parking bill at the airport which will be about $250.  The dispatcher informs me that a supervisor will not be at work until after 8:00.  So why was I not told this when I called previously?  Why was I on hold for ten minutes?\n\n8:16 - I call looking for a supervisor.  I'm given the cell phone number for someone named Rob.  I call the number and a guy named Jesus answers.  He explains that he's a supervisor for the drivers and not for dispatch.  Tells me I need to talk to someone in dispatch.\n\n8:21 - I call again looking for a supervisor.  I'm given someone's voicemail.  I leave a message and yet nobody returns my call.\n\n1:40 - I call again.  I'm placed on hold.  Yellow Cab hangs up on me after 13 minutes of being on hold.\n\n1:54 - I call again.  I inform dispatch that I will filing a law suit against Yellow Cab for the costs incurred as a result of their negligence.  I leave a name and number and suggest that someone call me back to resolve the matter.\n\nSo.... that's where we're at.  This has got to be one of the worst companies I've ever seen.

I went for spring break with my fiance.  I get that part of this has to do with the fact I am there in a high tourist season, however our hotel at a decent place was less that what it cost us to rent a Kia Soul.    We were not allowed to change our car even though we had no desire to be driving that.  We were basically harrassed about insurance for ten min.  They told us that we had to top off the fuel within a five mi radius and bring in a receipt with this information, as that failure to do this would incur a penalty.\n\nTo put another driver on the vehicle was more than twenty per day.  In some cities in a non tourist season you can get an economy car for that price.\n\nThe USB connection ports didnt work so charging iPods ect wasnt going to happen.\n\nThe major complaint happened at check in.  We were in a rush and I left some items in the vehicle.  I noticed that I left them when I was in the line for Southwest (that was a horror show as well), I called three times from the airport, once from the plane and once from our layover.  Then I called from St Louis where we landed.  Each time leaving messages.  I got a call a day later.  A majority of the items werent found.\n\nThe woman in the lost and found was nice, however couldnt explain what happend.  I spoke with her manager who told me that she would look in to it and call me the next day.  That was three months and five left messages by myself ago.  All she needed to do was say that they looked at the video tape.  Thats it.  I heard story after story from the Lost and Found woman about what they did, however it really never made sense.  Why some and not all of the items were recovered doesnt make sense until this day.\n\nSo while I understand that I didnt have to go to spring training and then it was my fault that I lost things, this was a rip off with a serious lack of courtesy to the end user.", "business_id": "FYCVF_1qYm3x5DYCbmmK1g", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-06-16", "type": "review"}

The 'security' guard I had to pass in order to get to the metal detectors was more interested in her split ends than in looking at my photo ID or checking that it actually matched the name on the ticket.  The Express flight gates are all housed in a small separate building that one must walk through an outdoor area in order to reach.  The entire terminal smells vaguely of mildew and disuse.  And all but one of the eating establishments is either boarded up or roped off and the place that is open...ewww.  \r\n\r\nI ordered a pastrami and swiss from the less-than-friendly counter person and after discussing the appropriate change I should have received back for my $20 bill, I traveled down the smeared glass to pick up my to-go sandwich.  Which had morphed into ham.  I didn't order ham. Well the ticket says sandwich special and that's ham.  Excuse me, but your board says 'special Pastrami and Swiss or Ham and Swiss' and I did not order ham - I don't EAT ham.  Sandwich maker goes down the line to have discussion with counter-person.  I wait.  Impatiently.  I am exceedingly hungry as well as minorly hung-over and I just want my *&$%(#$&  food.  Finally, I get my pastrami and swiss on (grudgingly admitted) good rye bread.\r\n\r\nOne star for the friendly sky-cap who took my luggage (OUTSIDE the terminal) and one star for the good bread.

I'll start off by saying that it's all about which Terminal you use. If you're travelling Southwest or US Airways, you will unfortunately have to use Terminal 4. While it is the new and largest Terminal, it is also the busiest....by FAR!!!!! I can never accurately predict how busy it will be. On any random Friday, I can expect a LONG, SLOW security line-especially when I'm running late. I still fail to understand how they will only man 2 of the 3 i.d check stations when the lines are long......and don't get me started on the security and x-ray stations. I got to experience the awesome new airport in Singapore and thinking about while in line at Terminal 4 at Sky Harbor almost makes me cry every time.\n\nWhere this terminal is the best is in the choice of food and drinks. This is where Terminal 4 shines. They close early though, so if you're leaving after 8:00pm, forget about a drink, Pizza Slut or Cinnabon.\nTerminal 2 is quite the opposite-fast and easy to check-in and get past security. It is a BREEZE and about as stress free as you can get in the U.S. The flip side is that there is ONE bar and it is lame. So there is absolutely nothing to do with the spare time you have, having anticipated that security was going to take forever after experiencing Terminal 4. \nSo to sum up, Terminal 4 has lots of bars and food venues that you WON'T be able to experience because it took so long to get through security. And as stressed as you are after security, it really sucks because you'll NEED a drink-but your flight's leaving in 6 minutes.\nYou will probably be relaxed with time to kill if you use Terminal 2, but HOW you kill that time is going to be problematic.", "business_id": "hW0Ne_HTHEAgGF1rAdmR-g", "stars": 2, "date": "2008-07-27", "type": "review"}

I had to share.\nMy grandmother, bless her heart, wanted to buy my ticket with her flyer miles. On Friday night we arrived at the ticket counter and they appeared to be closed. Though I believe that we went to the wrong counter. We vowed to come back at six the next morning and by golly I was up at 5:22 a.m.\n\nI'm not a happy morning person so I'm quite asleep. My grandmother is awake and on a mission. We pay $4 for parking and walk up to the ticket counter, no line, no waiting. Things are looking pretty good.\n\nMy grandmother says she wants to buy a ticket for me using her flyer miles. The ticket lady looks at us and asks us if we had made a reservation.\n\"What, we have to make a reservation to come to the airport and buy a ticket?\"\nMy grandmother is irritated with the lady and it hasn't even been 2 minutes. She doesn't let this show, but I can feel it.\n\nI tell her I need a ticket from Phoenix to Dublin and I tell her Sept. 15.\n\"Booked,\" she replies.\n\"Well, try the sixteenth.\"\n\"Booked.\"\n\"The fourteenth?\"\n\"Booked.\"\n\"Try everything from the thirteenth to the twenty-first.\"\n\"Booked, booked, booked, booked, booked, booked, booked, booked, booked.\"\n\"Really? This is more than a month in advance? A friend of mine just bought a plane ticket to France three weeks prior to her departure date. Try another airline, maybe Aer Lingus. I found round trip tickets from $768 and one-ways for $459.\"\n\"That's a really good deal you should probably go with that if you can get it.\"\n\"Well, how much is a one-way ticket for Aer Lingus on the 15th of Sept.?\"\n\"$2,000.\"\n\nI was afraid that my grandmother was going to have a heart attack. She gasped and stood there with her mouth open. We walked upstairs and sat at a table to call the flight fund people that were supposed to make a reservation for us and magically bestow the flyer miles.\nAfter giving the guy on the phone her life story for computer input on his end he asks, \"So where is your grand-daughter going?\"\n\"From Phoenix to Dublin.\"\n\"Ma'am I'm sorry this is US only. I'll have to transfer you to our international department.\"\n\nI sit and stare at the people walking through the airport at this ungodly hour (for me anyway.)\nNow she is talking to a woman in the international sector for the miles.\nThe woman asks what my return date is and my grandmother tells her that the ticket is one-way. I am going for school for a year and have no idea when I will be back.\nThe woman kindly informs us that unless I am a citizen of the UK I can not get a one-way ticket to Ireland by using flyer miles. But I can get a round trip ticket and then just change the date for a fee of $275! And also to do that my grandmother is 20,000 miles short, she only has 30,000 miles which would have been enough for the one-way ticket.\n\nMy grandmother asks how much would it be to just buy the 20,000 miles and the woman on the other end tells her that it would probably cost as much, if not more, than buying a regular ticket.\n\"Well how much is a regular round trip ticket?\"\nMy grandmother turns white as a ghost. She is breathless as her mouth hangs wide open. I am afraid her heart actually did stop.\nShe looks at me as she writes the figure on the paper in front of her.\n$4,798.\n\nI tell her to hang up. We are going home and I'm going on the internet.\nI bought a one-way ticket from Phoenix to Dublin leaving on Sept. 15th for $530.\nFunnier yet, I actually got the ticket for the two airlines the ticket lady said was either booked or expensive...

Where do I start? Driving to the airport is easy. It is centrally located and I would rate it high in the convience department. After that, it's downhill. I don't park there -  I use a shuttle service such as the Parking Spot and get dropped off right out front. Much easier. Inside the terminals are good, most of the times the lines move, although why people cannot figure out how to use the self check kiosks, I don't know. It isn't rocket science. Security lines are rarely long and move quickly, but once inside you are stuck with limited services. Sure there are stores and Dick Clark's on the outside, but be prepared to fly hungry or wait in long lines on the inside. I fly Delta a lot and in terminal 3 you have a choice of Wendy's or the blue burrito...or vending machines...maybe pick up something at the newsstand...\n\nFor me the major issues are driving through the airport. The terminals are not user friendly. They are adequately marked 1-4 and have north side and south side. When picking up someone ask which door number they are coming out of - because you cannot stop long. Once the wheels on the bus stop going round and round security emerges as if by magic to instruct you to keep moving. Sit there and ignore them long enough and the ticket book appears - that's when it;s time to circle again (thanks, Bin Laden). Terminal three has one inconvenient turn while you are waiting for emerging traffic during your continual loop of the terminal - I have almost been t-boned a few times there. Another thing I don't like is their short term parking - it appears instantly and goes up a ramp. It is always in a spot I am not thinking it should be, so I miss it. Instead use the cell phone lot and wait for your party to call, circle around and take your chances with security.\n\nOn a positive note, the airport is a great place to people watch. I always follow the guideline of 2 hours early, so I get to sit and watch. People hanging in the bar getting drunk and forgetting they are flying when their name is paged, people late and OJ'ing it through the concourse, people wearing interesting outfits and being an international airport, you can see people from all over the world. Not to mention the occassional disruptions - is it a wonder SouthWest made a reality show about people in the airport? If you don't mind being hungry and bored, arrive early and watch the people.

But while that only happens here and there and I can't judge an airport based on where I'm flying to, this review will be about the airport and not my traveling adventures. \n\nI'll start with my likes. \n\n - I like that they have some reasonable parking options that don't leave you $25 poorer everyday your motorized vehicle sleeps over. \n- I like that they have a Paradise Bakery \n- I like that they have a Borders Bookstore. My pocket book doesn't. \n- I like that they have Cold Stone Creamery. My waistline doesn't. \n- I like that on most occasions, I can get through security in under ten minutes, but I might have to give the crappy economy a point for this one. \n- I like that they have free wi fi. \n- I like that the flights are normally on-time. \n- I like that the staff is friendly \n\nWhat I don't like...\n\nIf Phoenix International Airport was the only airport I'd ever visited, I'd probably give it four stars, but unfortunately I've seen what a truly fabulous airport can look like (I'm talking about you, North Carolina Airport and you SFO International Airport...the list continues) \n\nI don't really like that the food varies based on the terminal. For example. I love frozen yogurt...as if you couldn't tell. Well, TCBY is only in terminal A (I think) but I'm always sent to terminal C or D...so then fro yo is a no go and my sweet tooth argues with me the rest of the trip. \n\nI don't like how incredibly creepy the airport feels after 9 pm. Every time I've taken a red eye, the airport was eerie and nothing was open for me to get a drink or snack. I thought the airport knew the term \"midnight snack.\" \n\nI think that's about it what my likes and dislikes. When it comes down to it, the airport does its job --- it sends people to their destination and it welcomes them when they come home. I guess they shouldn't make it too comfortable because then they'd find lurkers trying to eat at the restaurants all the time instead of just when they are in fact traveling.", "business_id": "hW0Ne_HTHEAgGF1rAdmR-g", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-08-06", "type": "review"}

You'd most likely have to go on a 30 minute hike to find out if there's one closer to your terminal before realizing there isn't and you're forced to eat at someplace else which is more expensive and not as tasty in order to avoid missing your flight.\n\nThe good thing about this place though is that everyone I met who worked there was incredibly friendly.

It was up in the air somewhere after they checked it in at the gate, said there weren't any more spaces in the overhead bin. Of course, when I get to my seat, there's a vacuum of space, and the flight attendant didn't check to see when my flight was landing in Cabo. I had a four hour lay-over.\n\nThis gave me plenty of time to wander around Phoenix Sky Harbor. This airport is massive. Shaped like a giant rectangle with four gates connected by long corridors and automatic walkways, it's kind of amazing how much space there is. But take a peek outside the expanse of windows, through the sweltering 110+ degree midday glare you can see why--there's simply not a lot of stuff in Phoenix but desert, a few buildings, and a range of mountains.\n\nThe food here isn't much to write home about, a lot of repeat offenders like Starbucks, Burger King, Cinnabon, and a few local eateries. There's also a few really sad California Pizza Kitchen ASAP kiosks here that are so small they don't even serve pizza, they've got just enough room for a fridge packed with salad. Strange.\n\nSo I'm wandering around the baggage claim area, hoping they didn't lose my luggage. I look at my ticket my baggage re-routing order, \"Grey with green and white plat.\" WTF.

They are more than likely all true.  I'm looking for other options now but if it comes down to just staying put I'd rather do that, personally.  I'll never fly U.S. Airways again. They didn't even give my husband and I seats together. After more research I discovered that this is a trick that they do to pump more money out of couples.  \n\nThe days of \"Thank you for flying with us\" or \"Happy travels\" is a thing of the past. We all know why but the scary thing is that there are not any checks and balances In place for the TSA.  They have no fear of being as horrid as they wish. If you give them any offence they threaten with the police who are all but ready to go nuts on anybody. \n\nHowever, they were not as bad as the TSA and actually helped us a little.  Since there's a monopoly now with airlines they do not have any need to be pleasant and believe me U.S. Airways is the worst from the obnoxious and loud flight attendant, to the old nasty planes, to the pilot that says on loud speaker, \"Keep it moving one bag on top and one on the bottom you are delaying the plane.\"\n\n We had all just gotten on to board and it's as if the pilot was already blaming us for his enviable lateness.  \nNothing can compare to what TSA did and it's unbelievable.

The second Soup Nazi was giving me orders and I honestly thought that she wanted me to lift my shirt so I did.  You should have watched this bitch put on a show like I had offended her deepest core of her soul.  I feared that she wouldn't recover from the shock and I'm telling you I'm cute. LOL.

The only good thing that I can say is that U.S. Airways did refund our money and so did Expedia.  However, we missed our trip and lost $500.00  for a psychodrama workshop. Oh, one of the TSA agents asked me where I was going. I thought that saying Berkeley, CA would be  a good thing because it's one State over.... How likely am I to highjack a plane that's going two hours away? He grunted back to me...\"Berkeley why do you want to go to Berkeley\" as though I had said Death Valley.  Once I answered the psychodrama workshop he had no response because he had no clue what it was. LOL. \n\n \nI have spoken with a friends of my mother's who was a child in France right before the Nazi's invaded. She said that America has that same eerie feeling right now that she cannot shake. I didn't really get it until Thursday but I agree now. I don't think that it's a color thing... I think that it's a new American Terrorist group called the TSA from Homeland Security and it's them or us.  We are seen as pesky insects that are trying to get them and they have to get us first. It's as if no one said to them look, most of these people are just business or vacation travelers so be pleasant and do your job.  \n\nThey definitely need checks and balances and someone there to handle their misconduct. They are completely out of control.  What happened in Afghanistan has nothing to do with this ongoing horror that has been unleashed on the American public. Perhaps, we are just getting ready for what is to become once the Chinese takes over. LOL. \n\nOh, and just because U.S. Airways claims that they allow carry-on pets every employee there treated us as if we had a patient with Leprosy with us from the ticket booth through TSA.", "business_id": "hW0Ne_HTHEAgGF1rAdmR-g", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-08-07", "type": "review"}

He asked if we had food I said one piece of a hamburger left maybe like 2 inches and he yells \"IS IT PORK?!\"and I proceeded to say ,\"no I believe it is meat,you can take it if you'd like\" and he yells back at me, \"UH NO THIS IS NOT TRASH CAN\" & let me inform you this is in front of my family my mother,little sister,& grandmother so we just look at each other like OK?so he informs us to put our suitcases on the machine to have them go trough so we start out with my 70 year old grandmother who's bag weighs about 26 pounds this man yells at her!Saying\"DON'T THROW IT ON THERE\"now tell me how is my 70 year old grandmother going to throw a 26 pound bag?!so we proceeded to put ours and once again yells at us to not throw it,I'm not sure if this man needs a nap or a raise but he was scum and deff needs to be talked to. So that experience sucked so finally got our baggage re checked for our next flight now to head to the security/TSA department now let me say something really quick I am NOT racist I am Hispanic & most of my friends are Caucasian but how I was treated in the TSA department was HORRID! We got our Passports checked and were told to go through the security as is everyone else, well we were on one side,there was a group of Indian decent men in front of us,a Caucasian family behind us & in the booth next to us only Caucasian people.So we put our stuff through the machine next to a TSA machine & also a metal detector.I'd like to know  how come the Caucasian woman working sent the Caucasian group of people next to us all through the regular metal detector but had my whole family and the Indian men in front of us go through the TSA machine but as soon as I'm waiting for my turn in the TSA this woman let the cacusian people behind me just go through the metal detector!!!!!! I'd like to say that's some bullshit especially because all I was wearing was a tank top shorts and flip flops NO JEWELRY! What could it had hurt if I went through the regular detector!!!!This makes no sense to me and as soon as I walk out the TSA machine ANOTHER woman working there stops me and rechecks me with a hand metal detector!!!! are you shitting me?! My family just standing there looking at me like are you serious?! So this makes no sense to me and is just pushing me to make even a bigger uproar.So when she was done I proceeded to get my belongings and walk out but the flapping door wouldn't push open so I had to pull it towards me to get out and the woman YELLS,\"NO it's the other way PUSH IT!\"seriously if it worked the other way I would have I'm not an idiot it says PUSH but it wasn't exactly even on the sides so it wouldn't. Finally we had gotten out that area and proceeded to our Terminal where all the seats were taken up and 6 were taken up by a Caucasian man who felt the need to sleep across all the chairs we tried to wake him to move but nope nothing so we proceeded to tell the  woman working can you please have him move but did she do anything??oh OF COURSE NOT so we were left to sit on the ground!! Thank you! I have to say we were so disappointing we heard Arizona was disliked for some of their racial issues and also are being attacked by LULZSEC and the hacking of Arizona police but DAMN REALLY?No wonder it's so hott it is HELL.\np.s.

The rental car area is miles from the actual airport and there was no express way for the buses to get in and out.  It is an extraordinarily inefficient mousetrap that adds on at least 20 minutes to your commute.  On top of that, the rental vehicles are expensive, and there isn't a gas station remotely near the rental car return center.  If you are local or a frequent traveler you probably figure all of this stuff out, but if you are a first timer, it is very frustrating.\n\nThis could have just been the day I was there, but the security lines were woefully understaffed.  They only had 2 of 6 lines running the day I was there.  Because of this, a bottleneck was being caused by the priority treatment that families, those in wheelchairs, and business class elite receive.  I am all for this preferential treatment, that wasn't the problem, but because the line moved so slow, there were periods of time where these were the only folks who were moving through at all.  The security folks were having a tough time simply keeping up with them.  It took 45 minutes to get through a line that was only 50% full.  I perish the thought of  what it would be like if they had a more substantial group of travelers.\n\nOn the plus side, I found the airport clean, but that is a base expectation for an airport.

Even baggage claim has a Starbucks.  \n\nThe above is mostly about Terminal 4 but Terminal 3 has good food options but the terminal is very dated.  Has a fairly confusing layout to the unfamiliar.\n\nTerminal 2 is even more dated.  Shame that United and other carriers use this terminal when spaces are available at 3.\n\nOne of the biggest problems I have with the airport is how the off-site parking shuttles are positioned.  The best way to describe the area is chaotically dangerous.  It is literally at the end of the airport where traffic at different points merges and in front of the corporate cars.  Just imagine a parking or hotel shuttle trying to get in and a corporate car trying to get out with traffic whizzing past between 35-50 mph.  Herding cats would be more orderly.", "business_id": "hW0Ne_HTHEAgGF1rAdmR-g", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-06-14", "type": "review"}

Chang Rock n Roll Arizona marathon. Finding that cheap airline ticket from HNL was the challenge in itself, but it was totally worth it. PHX is about a 10 minute drive from downtown Phoenix, so it wasn't too bad, although they also have a public transportation that's pretty noteworthy too. Using Delta Airlines as my prime carrier of choice, I connected through Salt Lake City, before boarding the small regional jet to PHX. There were some direct flights to PHX, but it was on US Airways, an airline I don't know much about, or do I really want to fly with anyways. I stick with what works and makes me happy.\n\nPHX itself is a regional airport, but is large enough to support a large flux of commuters and travelers getting into Phoenix and other destinations within the surrounding region or across the USA, if not farther than that. There is not much in the way of shopping here, unless you were to do the usual snacks, restaurants, and other pickups of souvenirs you want to snag at the airport before leaving for your final destination.  Getting in and out of this airport is similar to other sized airports, just go to follow the directional arrows to the baggage claim and pick up your luggage before heading to the rental car counter or shuttle, taxi cab area, or the waiting area for your friends and family. \n\nI definitely love PHX and the city of Phoenix and Tempe. Just like most airports, the ticketing area is very much together, unless mentioned otherwise. I do love the airline DIY kiosks, since I know I can do it myself without having to do much of anything. I normally just check in on my iPhone and print out the paper boarding pass at the airport. Sometimes, I should just use my iPhone app to go through security, just to save a little bit of time. Then again, I do like to keep those boarding pass mementos of 1st class seating, just because it's just an awesome feeling to be in 1st class rather than in economy. For now, economy works right now, since airline tickets are getting to be a pain. There is free wifi connectivity here at the airport, so that's a good thing when you need it. \n\nThe baggage claim area at PHX is smaller than I thought, but it's pretty good. The only problem would be that airport prices for food and amenities do cost an arm and a leg. That's the crappy part of the entire flying experience for me. While I know they have to make money somehow, try to find some other way to gauge the flying public, please! I know I shouldn't really grumble about it, but I'm blessed to be flying when all I am doing is running marathons in every state in the United States. I probably won't come back to PHX in the future. If I do, it will just be passing through to other destinations still undiscovered by me.\n\nFly away!\n\nB+", "business_id": "hW0Ne_HTHEAgGF1rAdmR-g", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-08-13", "type": "review"}

This was a fast and painless experience and only took about 10 minutes total. Once I got into the airport and got my boarding pass I went through security check within about 5 minutes. There were a lot of people there, however, the people from TSA were working fast and were still checking everything from what it seemed to me at least. So within 20 minutes of arriving to the airport I am already inside the airport and able to get to my terminal if I were in a hurry.\n\nSince I wasn't in a hurry because I give myself plenty of time to get to my destination when flying, I ended up getting something to eat at Round Table Pizza. This airport has a lot of shops and restaurants to choose from that will keep you occupied or get you what you want in a flash if you're in a hurry. I always find friendly people here that start up random conversations which I particularly enjoy doing while I travel, it makes the time fly by (pun intended).\n\nWhen I have flown through here from when I moved back to Buffalo, I was happy to be back to my favorite place I have ever lived in my life. I walked around in here until my flight was boarding just looking at the great looking landscape that is surrounding you outside. There are some hot spots in the airport that you can feel the heat beating through with the sun throwing down 110 degree heat, but it's a nice feeling of being back. The entire airport is obviously air conditioned, but it's nice to have Arizona throw me some nostalgic beams of heat to remind me what this great state does best, melt everything! hehe.\n\nOverall this is my favorite airport I've ever been to, and there's a reason it's called the Friendliest Airport....because everyone here is very nice, and helpful.

F*ck you. \n\nI flew into PHX from Jacksonville, FL a few days ago. When I was in the security line at JAX, I realized I had forgotten my driver's license in my running shorts at home. I freaked and broke out in a cold sweat. I thought for sure I wasn't getting on the plane. Then I remembered I have a concealed weapons permit, took it out and hoped for the best. \n\nThe TSA agent that checked my ID was very pleasant and said the ID was fine since I also had alternative means of proving that I was me. Those other items were my social security card, and believe it or not, a SAM's Club membership card which has my photo on it. They let me through, no problems. \n\nFast forward to today when I'm at PHX and trying to head back to Jacksonville. \nThe TSA agent says that my concealed weapon permit won't work even though I also showed him the same pieces of ID that I showed the agent in JAX. He called a manager. The manager said I could go through but would have to be \"escorted\" by him as a +1. Let me explain to you what a plus one means...\n\nIt means they make you go through the peek-a-boo - I see you - X-Ray machine, THEN you get pulled over to the side and thoroughly frisked like a prison inmate, THEN they thoroughly go through all your shit even after it too had just passed through an X-Ray machine. Due to this, I had to throw away my hair product because apparently it was slightly too many ounces. Not happy about this. That hair product has passed through a number of airports with no problems BUT NOT AT PHX! \n\nAnyway, I'm sitting here in the terminal waiting for my flight, writing this review, stewing. I know I should be happy that I got through but Im not. \n\nThe TSA website says (I checked it before I ever came today):\n\n         'Adult passengers (18 and over) are required to show a U.S. federal or state-issued photo ID in order to be allowed to go through the checkpoint and onto their flight.'\n\nOn What Planet is a Concealed Weapon Permit, issued by the STATE of FLORIDA Not a STATE ISSUED photo-ID? \n\n        - It has my photo on it, my name, DOB, sex and race.\n        - It's Issued by the state of Florida\n\nWhat am I missing here!? So it doesn't have my address on it... Big f*cking deal! Why do you have to know my address!? You're trying to identify me, not pick me up for a date! \n\nIn addition, I had to go through an extensive background check to obtain that concealed weapon permit. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS BREATHE AND KIND OF KNOW HOW TO DRIVE A CAR to get a driver's license. \n\nLook.... I know I'm the dumb ass for forgetting my driver's license but at what point did people lose the ability to use common sense? This was a ridiculous waste of everyone's time, in addition to being very frustrating. Have the terrorists won by default? Maybe they have.\n\n//end Ode\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo why 2 stars? Why not 1? Why not zero, half a star, a quarter of a star, negative stars? Well... because that isn't an option. Although, as anyone who has been through a shitty experience like this can attest, it would be phenomenal if it were possible.\n\nThe other reason for two stars is because this listing is for the PHX Airport as a whole and not just the TSA. \n\nI look at airports like this:\n\n1. Security is 60% of the review and what causes the most amount of anxiety                            for me so it weighs heavily on the total rating. \n   \n2. Then there's 25% for dining and drinking options\n \n3. 15% Everything else.\n\nThat said, PHX as a whole is decent. They have free WIFI which is always appreciated and they have a convenient bus system that runs on the regular to take you to the rental car building. \n\nI didn't get to peruse the dining options so I can't comment on that. Even if I had, I couldn't stomach dropping more than 2 stars after today. \n\nI know I'll be going back to PHX Airport. There's no way around it for me. I can certainly tell you that I won't forget my driver's license again. And with 100% assurity, I can also tell you... the PHX TSA WILL NOT be getting a Christmas card from me this year.", "business_id": "hW0Ne_HTHEAgGF1rAdmR-g", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-07-29", "type": "review"}

You'll have to make that drive twice, a second time to return the car -not a fun drive in the afternoon rush hour, with road signs directing you to the airport, not the car rental!\n\nIf you are going on the light rail system to downtown Phoenix, you will also have to catch a bus to get to the nearest light rail system stop on the very edge of the airport, but not within walking distance.  Undoubtably the taxi companies vetoed any light rail stop in the center of the airport, so they won't lose business!\n\nIf you are returning a car, and taking a taxi to downtown, you have to return the car to the car rental area, take a bus 6 miles to the airport, and then catch a taxi to downtown.  No taxis at the car rental area!   \n\nOn the positive side, the airport is only about 7 miles and a $22 cab ride from downtown Phoenix.  \n\nI don't know why they have the word 'harbor' in the name of the airport, as the ocean and harbor is at least 400 miles away.

I always park in economy and use airport shuttle to get to my terminal. $9 a day is ok with me, it's easy to get in and out without too much fuss. There is a shuttle that circles both the long term parking for East and West Economy that will cycle around all the terminals; don't use these if you are at all in a hurry because you will find that the path they take, must be derived from some calculation from corporate offices and one of basic simplicity. Just yesterday we were picked up, and rather that drive to the parking lot next to the terminal, West economy where we were parked, they drove past the entrance to West economy parking and away towards the next terminal; since it was going to take 20 minutes to loop around to our stop or longer, we got off and walked to the car. So if your trip is over, hop on the tram, enjoy the A/C and relax until your at your row in parking.

However, since I know that's about a 30% likely and I've never missed a flight it's a minor gripe  in an overall successful process. I always get to the airport an hour early, so take that in mind if you don't. There have been 2-3 times at TSA where we are all in a panic wondering if we can remain civil to the process any longer. I don't know how many times the TSA end of the line steward will yell out, to go to another terminal C TSA for NO waiting. Man, if those employees aren't busy then move them over here!\nThe post TSA food choices are OK, nothing that exciting;  Wendy's, Subway and Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf.

The airport is very clean, the staff members friendly, there are great food options throughout the airport, and going through security is never a hassle.\n\nLets face it, no one likes going to the airport, but throughout all of my visits to Sky Harbor I have always had a pleasurable experience. The airport is located very close to downtown and only takes minutes to get to. Since it is so close it is not a hassle for friends to do a quick drop-off or pick-up from the airport. Additionally, a cab fare does not cost very much to get there and if cabs are out of your price range then you can always take the Light Rail to the 44th St. stop. From that stop that Sky Rail takes you straight to your terminal (T5 coming in 2015). I love the location of Sky Harbor and how easy it is to get there.\n\nMy favorite part about SH has to be the short wait times at security. Only once have I ever had to wait more than 15 minutes to make it through the entire line. These TSA agents mean business and do their jobs very efficiently. For those with worse luck than me or less patients I would recommend getting TSA Pre-Check approval. This allows you to cut the majority of the line while going through security. Another perk is that you do not have to remove and items from your bag (including laptops, liquids) and you do not have to remove your shoes, belts, or jackets. It is the BEST! If you apply and are approved it is good for 5 years. The app is $85 and you give them permission to do a background cheek and finger printing.\n\nThe only reason will not give SH the full five star rating is because I have visited some pretty extravagant airports before in the Middle East that made me realize that most airports in the US are missing a cultural and artistic value. SH does have a number of great artist that have contributed to its design but nothing that was breath taking like I have seen elsewhere.\n\nGreat airport!

It has vastly improved over the years and once the new light rail was up and running, it became a lot of fun for me to head out to the airport (without anyone having to take me) to catch my flights. But I have to be honest about things. This airport is a little quirky. Originally, the light rail would take you to 44th Street and Washington and from there you would take a nice air conditioned bus that would glide through to all of the terminals and work it's way back around to the parking structure and back to the bus stop across the street from the light rail stop. \n\nHowever, once the SkyTrain came on the scene Sky Harbor decided the shuttles were no longer needed to pick folks up from the light rail station. This is a mistake in my view. The reason this is important is because the SkyTrain ONLY goes to terminal 4. After that it turns around back towards the parking structure and back to the end of the line where the escalator meets the long hallway that leads to the light rail station. \n\nThe problem is having to get off of the SkyTrain and head downstairs to the nearest shuttle stop and wait for one to take you to another terminal. There are only a few signs telling you where to catch the shuttle and so it is easy to get lost looking for where to go. Additionally, it takes much more time to get to your terminal this way. In this regard, because the SkyTrain is not complete yet (despite the city promoting it like it is) Phoenix is still behind Las Vegas, Dallas, and LA. And that is a bit annoying. \n\nRegarding the security lines and the TSA. They are not the slowest I've seen, but at busy hours it can be a little while before getting through. Contrast that with Las Vegas, which had many agents working to make the lines go faster and to get us all through quickly. There's a noticeable difference in our security versus others in the region. I know it isn't necessarily Sky Harbor's fault, but it does factor into how people view the airport. \n\nIn terms of changing terminals, I've done it twice and it is a nightmare. Time consuming and because of the \"Arizona-style\" outdoor nature between the terminals, you will have to go through TSA security again. And that's never fun to do twice in a day let alone twice in the same airport with limited time between flights. \n\nThe seating and overall atmosphere of terminal 2 is shabby and outdated. It is a relic of Arizona history, which shows you a glimpse into a time when Phoenix only needed a small terminal to service everyone coming and going. The bathrooms look like they are from the 1980s and it sucks to be there. Terminal 3 is slightly better, but still with outdated seats and areas where the carpet is screaming to be cleaned or changed out. And terminal 4, the flagship terminal of Arizona, well it's average at best. The food options are more plentiful than the others, but there is far more foot traffic and the seating is still only decent with few plug-ins or outlets for electronic devices. Quite far behind even an airport I was at in Guatemala. Seriously. \n\nDespite the criticisms I outlined here, Sky Harbor could be much worse and my flights have always been on time here. The SkyTrain will eventually be finished, thus shutting up my major gripe about the place and the people working there really are friendlier than other airports I've been to. In the end, it isn't good as Dallas or bad as LA. Just about where Phoenix always is, right in the middle. Average. Decent.

I can remember only having Terminal 1, the passengers walking across the tarmac to the terminal as we stood on the roof watching; waving.  \"Here comes Aunt Mamie!\" we'd squeal as they rolled out the red carpet and she'd walk down the stairs wearing her fox stole; in for the winter from New Hampshire.  Always exciting.  In high school that was a good cheap date too - go watch the planes at the airport and steal some kisses under the stars in the dark, thick night.  Then the sprawl and growth of the 70's required a bigger airport and it grew and with each new phase we would be in awe and remember the old times.  It grew and grew and became the rather hodgepodge of an airport.  I love the new train to the terminal and hope to utilize that someday soon but otherwise the airport lacks some character, local flavor and charm and is not the most organized of airports.  I will say the Sky Harbor employees were some of the most courteous that I encountered on our trip. Despite having to work in the blistering heat they were very kind and helpful to us. We had a very pleasant wait at the gate and the boarding was civilized and easy thanks to the ticket agents.  The moving sidewalks are a blessing for having to get to the gates quickly and is highly appreciated.  It does same time and prevents you having to RUN from one end to the other.

I was smart and only brought a carry-on bag and was ready to jet as soon as the airplane doors opened as I only had 20 minutes to catch my connecting flight due to some unexpected maintenance in Puerto Vallarta.  I walked very briskly from one of the last B gates hoping in the back of my mind there was not a long line in customs and that I wouldn't have to go through the TSA again to get to my connect terminal. \n\nFirst roadblock, customs, alas had minimal lines but I was a little confused by the self checkout passport scanner devices. It did seem to help decrease the lines though. I sauntered through the customs/immigration counter and continued my hustle toward the A gates. I know there is some method to the madness but I think it's kind of silly how you can come out of the international arrival gates go out through customs and have to basically circle back around if you're trying to get to the A gates. Anyway, still going at warp 9 speed I picked up my bag and ran up the steps to the shops area and found a departure board hoping my gate was near. Realizing it was the A gate and there wasn't any signage stating were A was I hollered at one of the people at the customer service desk who pointed me in the right direction. Visually sweating at this point as it was like 90 degrees in the terminal as opposed to the 110 or more outside and with a jacket on mind you, since the plane was a little brisk I got to the A gate. \n\n\"Hay dios mio!\", I exclaimed still reeling from my trip to Mexico as I came to roadblock #2, TSA. With no time to waste, I started to disrobe. We all know the drill, coats, shoes, belts, laptops out of laptops, liquids in clear bag outside of your carryon and etc. I threw my coat and shoes and liquids in one tote and put my carryon on the conveyor. I stepped into the body scanner and grabbed my stuff off the belt. Forget about putting yourself back together! I slid into my shoes and wobbled my way onward until the back of my shoes slipped over the back of my heels. \n\nI see A8 in the distance and the crowd of travelers weaving in and out with several people frozen in confusion as they are unsure where they are or where they should be. Warp 10 kicks in and soon I pass A3, then 4 then 7. There is no one left in the A8 waiting area. The emotions start to override hope. I see a man walking by with an ipad that works for the airport. I ask, \"how do I get on this plane? The one that is sitting in the gate.\" He mumbles some things that show he's confused as to what I'm asking. He checks the ipad and again mumbles information that doesn't help answer my question. Then like a ray of sunshine a woman appears from behind the secure gate door.

Never.\n\nI had the unfortunate experience of riding Greyhound just after graduating college.  My experience was that the facilities and buses were dirty. The facility lacked adequate security.  Now I find out that they are targeting the very people that keep them in business by charging those who most need their service HUGE service fees.\n\nMy latest experience:  It was horrible.\n\nMy sister, who is staying with me while she completes testing and assessments in consideration for a liver transplant, needed to return to Yuma immediately to provide care for another family member.\n\nBecause my sister does not have checking or lines of credit, she asked me if I could book her ride for her online.  She wanted to make sure that she had a spot reserved.  I went to Greyhound.com to arrange for a ticket and transportation for my sister.  Greyhound quoted a price of $34.32 for a one way ticket. As I completed the forms online and proceeded to checkout, the cost of the ticket had changed to $52.32.  As I researched the change further, I realized that Greyhound has a policy of charging an $18.00 fee if you buy the ticket but are not the person using the ticket.  Greyhound listed the fee as a \"Gift Ticket Fee.\"\n\nI contacted Greyhound customer service. Based upon my conversation and the lack of English spoken by the rep, I am assuming that Greyhound has outsourced its call center function overseas.  The CSR I spoke with explained to me that the fee is a policy of Greyhound and it is charged to cover the additional costs and for convenience.  I asked him to breakdown what additional costs they were incurring?  He was unable or unwilling to justify the fee.  He kept reiterating that \"this is our policy and you must pay Gift Ticket Fee.\"\n\nMy feeling here is the Greyhound has instituted a policy that is direct fee on the poor and indigent.  This policy has the DIRECT EFFECT of raising rates on those who can least afford it.  In my sisters case, the cost for me to book her bus fare was an INCREDIBLE 52% INCREASE over the advertised fare.\n\nGreyhound...it is no wonder your ridership is in continual decline.  It is no wonder that your company is on shaky financial grounds.  Wake up.  Take a look at your reviews online.  Read what people are saying about you.

I called the transportation company back 10 min later and by 7:57pm was told that they couldn't give an ETA and that they had lost control.

What delightfully witty banter.\n\nThat commercial encompasses the vibe you get when you stay here. The HIE is always ready to remind you how Smart you are for staying here. In fact, everything in the room from the pillows to the shower curtain to the bars of soap all incorporate the Smart \"theme\" in their branding.\n\nSince my company pays for my trips to Phoenix, I can't comment on the value of the hotel, but I can speak to the experience. For such a SmartHotel, the room layouts are inefficient. the bathroom counter (completely covered in little pamphlets advertising the smartness of the various items strewn about the room) is massive while the main room (a combination bedroom, office, lounge, dining room, etc) is an ergonomic nightmare.\n\nFor instance, once I removed the 17 pamphlets from the SmartDesk, I realized that the SmartLamp and the SmartPhone left little room for my laptop and mouse.\n\nI then picked up the crusty staticky SmartPhone, ordered SmartRoomService (which comes from the Hilton Garden Inn kitchen next door), and upon the meal's arrival had to remove my laptop from the SmartDesk, since it's the only thing which remotely resembles a SmartTable.\n\nI then turned on the SmartTV, A boxy Zenith CRT circa 1956, and ordered a SmartMovie, presented only in full-screen for $11.99+tax. After several attempts at setting the SmartAlarm, I just called the front desk on the SmartPhone, also circa 1956. Are you noticing a trend here? The same crappy, out-of-date appliance as any other Holiday Inn but with the word 'Smart' slapped across it and a pamphlet resting atop the closest hard surface, boasting how clever the aforementioned appliance is and how Smart you are for staying in a hotel that contains such a Smart appliance.\n\nOkay, on the good side, The SmartStaff was very friendly and accommodating and provided me with complimentary SmartToiletries I has taken from me by airport security. They were also kind enough to remove a SmartMovie charge on my bill from when I accidentally ordered some SmartCrappyMovie on Pay-Per-View.\n\nThe complimentary SmartBreakfast provided me with plenty of healthy and tasty options. The SmartCoffee was adequate. If you were Smart enough to read through this entire SmartReview, but you think my constant use of 'Smart' before every other word seems annoying, then you now know what it's like to stay at a HIE.", "business_id": "cvQ1wNSFaBTzrxB5fMLc3Q", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-07-06", "type": "review"}

They were snappy, condescending and they have a way to belittle you with their words. \n\nIris was one of them. She gave me attitude whenever I requested fresh linen. In one occasion she had the audacity to question me on why was I requesting clean sheets.. She said \" didn't you get house keeping yesterday ?\" And I had to explain to her that my one year old son have had an accident on them and that they were wet. I had to explain my self in front of other guest and that was so embarrassing. Iris is rather pushy, not a good quality for a customer service job. \nAlso during my three week stay twice I had to demand that she sent the house keeper over to my room to clean it ,  Iris kept making excuses on why the maid was not able to make it to my room on my scheduled day etc.. In addition to the above, two different occasions Iris informed me that this establishment had run of toilet paper and Kleenex , which I find impossible to believe as i requested it them in two different weeks and I know you are not going to rent the rooms to new guest with out toiletries. I honestly had to start buying my own as I did not want to deal with her poor attitude, But my discomfort comes mainly from the fact that your website advertises free toiletries and the house keeper did NOT provide me with any the two times she cleaned my room. Also one time she asked me twice to wait a minute because she had to look at her cell phone.. Even  as I was about to check out I called Iris and asked if the front desk would have any empty boxes, Iris promised to check and call me back but I never heard from her. \n\nThe other employee is Stephanie.\n\nStephanie doesn't not make eye contact and she stares at the computer while you try to communicate with her.. ..

Kind of unfortunate for us considering we live here now but its nice to spend a night away in a resort.  I'm giving it 4 stars but it really should be 3.5.  Its just above average.\n\nAnd this is quite a resort.  I am personally not a fan of the mega huge family resort; mainly because its so hard to find your way around and it takes forever to get from point A to point B.  When its 115 degrees out these walks are particularly trying.  \n\nChecking into the resort left less than a favorable impression on me.  I was laden with a heavy suitcase, laptop bag, as well as my husband's suit and my dress.  After I helped other guests sort out the line situation (seriously, why would you stand around in a huge crowd? Form a line!)  I asked the desk attendant to call a bell hop to take my bags to my room because it was a considerable walk away.  \"Oh, you can just go down that flight of stairs out to where the valet is and find a bell hop.\"  Hmm, ok, no.  If I wasn't laden down with bags perhaps I could walk down the steps but I have all this heavy stuff which is why I asked for the bell hop in the first place!  How does a front desk not call a bell hop for you?!  As I later found out I was supposed to receive a welcoming package from my husband's company that the front desk failed to give me.  Stellar.\n\nOur room was nice and large; they are all suites.  The room service menu has to be the most reasonably priced room service menu ever.  Some of the items were cheaper via room service than in the restaurants!  Our room overlooked an \"adult pool\" that had kids swimming in it.  This really grinds my gears...especially when the resort has a waterpark!  The waterpark is an experience....there are kids everywhere, three slides, a lazy river, and a wave pool.  Its all on a small scale.  They have two restaurants at the \"Oasis\" which both serve the same menu.  At night when the slides close they show a movie over the wave pool area.  \n\nThe formal events (dinner and receptions) that we attended were well done, the food was good in all instances.  The bartenders were very nice and quickly learned the drinks we were ordering.  \n\nWould I stay here again?  No, not if it wasn't for a business event.  Would I suggest it to friends visiting?  No.  Its not really in an easy location and with all the options available in the Valley I wouldn't consider this to be at the top.", "business_id": "I941jBn1KURuN-2wygJ_5A", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-07-05", "type": "review"}

Two theories: either our company had its sales meeting here within the last 5 years and negotiated the sweet rate (which is possible, since it's our brand of paper products in the bathrooms), or it was August and no one goes to the Arizona resorts in August due to the heat and/or potential for monsoon weather.\n\nI stayed in the villas, which were very nice.  Each room had a kitchenette with sink, fridge, and microwave.  The beds, covered with crisp, white linens, were quite comfy, with lots of fluffy pillows.  The bathrooms were nice and new.  Only odd thing was that the window to the outer hallway (down which all the guests walk to enter their rooms) was in the shower.  High speed internet access was free and easy, and the TV was a new hi-def flat panel.\n\nOur sweet room rate also included breakfast in the lobby grill, overlooking the golf course (the tee on the island).  The breakfast included had plenty to choose from: two eggs, choice of meat, choice of bread, and hashbrowns.  All was quite tasty, particularly the array of jams that came with the bread: jalapeno strawberry, pear and rosemary, and blueberry.  My favorite was the pear and rosemary, but I did have second bites of all of them.  After nights of heavy food, my coworker opted for the fruit plate instead of the included breakfast, and by the time he got fruit, coffee, bread, and OJ, it ended up costing him $30!!  That's a little steep for a la carte.\n\nThe staff was friendly enough, though it was annoying to have to keep valeting the car since there wasn't ready parking by the lobby.  Also, when we checked out a 5am on Friday morning, we weren't the only ones, and none of our bills had been pre-printed, even though that must be something they do since the woman behind the counter asked us if they were correct.\n\nWould I stay here again?

I can't recommend Rustler's Rooste enough - just a great place to eat.  It's not Mastro's in terms of quality/steak...but it's pretty darn good.  And there's sawdust on the floors and a country band playing...what more could you want!?

He guessed it was a 4oz pour. I'm having a $100 dinner, and your waiter doesn't know how big of a pour you have for your wine? Isn't that like training 101?

So I'll need to rate it on several different criteria:\n\nThe good:\nHotel lobby & rooms: very beautiful, spacious and well appointed. Our family of 4 enjoyed the layout. Very much like an upgraded embassy suites - which works great for a family of 4! The valet people couldn't have been nicer.\n\nOn-site Water park - yay! 2 tall slides, a lower loopy slide (my fave) a lazy river and a wave pool. Free towels, plenty of shade, and decent chair service. Plus a good amount of self serve icy water. Very appreciated. Plus regular pools and hot tubs near your rooms.\n\nThe bad\nThey are trying to save money in every direction, which makes it all seem very thrifty in a luxury setting.\n- Lots of signs and Chatter about buying a timeshare\n- They closed the lobby sundry store before 7:00 pm!!! Both nights!! Posted times were open weekly until 9:30.\n- you are charged a $40.00 resort fee per suite that covers a bunch of stuff you don't need, but includes 2 good items: free wifi (although it's slow) and free water park admission. So it's a wash for me. I don't need the free valet - its a 10' walk, nor the USA today delivered, nor a one way shuttle to the mall.\n\nThe ugly\nI was smoking mad about the lobby store closing before the posted time. My plan had been to stop in after our dinner (we dined in their lobby restaurant) and pick up some breakfast items, plus some wine. Instead we paid $30 for a bottle of wine at the restaurant, and $50 for breakfast room delivery. And on that, it was late, and several items were missing. We had an early appointment, and couldn't use the lobby restaurant. Total bust.\n\nWhen I called the lobby reception to ask about it, they couldn't have cared less. They said \"well yeah, they leave if it's dead\".\n\nThe cost of keeping an employee in there is $15.00 an hour. They would have sold 100.00 based on myself, and the 2 other couples that we're not sure why it was closed. Sadly, this just points to a very inexperienced manager in the economics area. Basically, 1 customer an hour will break it even.\n\nWould I stay here again? Yes. The Rooms are great. But it's just not a high end experience. We ate at 2 of the restaurants, and both were marginal at best.\n\nIf you have kids, stay here. But don't eat here (it's really overpriced for crappy food).

You know how people say it's the details which can make the difference between a so so hotel and a good one?  My recent stay was full of little disappointments.  I am a very generous tipper...to the Room Service team, and to the housekeepers, hence I expect to see the small things done right.  When I arrived, the front-desk honored my request for a high floor room.  However, I found the elevator, no more than 30 feet from my room to be out of order, and it remained out of order for two additional days.  Shouldn't the front desk be aware of this?  Every time I've stayed at the Hotel, there has been a coffee maker in my room.  In this instance, no. I called Housekeeping and they brought one up...however, it all dusty, like it had been sitting on a shelf for weeks.  Then I noticed there was only one Remote Control in the room, whereas, there has always been two...one for each of the two TVs. I use decaffe coffee every morning, and one morning none was replaced, and I had to call Housekeeping again.  Does not the Housekeeper see the empty coffee container and therefore replace like for like?  Then after using the coffeemaker on the first morning...I suddenly saw what looked like tiny ants on the Wetbar.  Over my five night stay, I had to call Housekeeping on two separate days to do something about the ants.  They did, and promptly, but how did this happen in the first place?  The coffeemaker?  One morning I used the iron and ironing board, the iron continually leaked water onto my clothes...water already in the iron, and I couldn't figure out how to drain it.  Each day, I would receive my wake up call.  I would pick up the phone to acknowledge it, and then ten minutes later receive another call, which again I had to answer and acknowledge.  Shouldn't the system recognize I had answered the first?  Finally, I enjoy using Room Service, and some of the Room Service staff remember me from me from previous visits.  The one annoying thing this time is with each night's dinner delivery, they nicely told me that, if I wanted them to come back and pick up the tray, to just call them.  Then, starting about a half hour later, I would start receiving calls, repeated calls, asking if I wanted them to pick up my tray.  If I wanted them to do this, I would have called.  So obviously, I've gone on probably too long.  But, again, the devil is in the details, and the Grand missed with this stay.  Should not the Housekeepers have a standard checklist they use each day...Coffee maker present? Check.  Coffee replaced?  Check.  Two remotes? Check.  And what is always mildly disappointing for me with every check-in, is that as many times as I've stayed at the Hotel, each time I arrive it's as if I'm a first time visitor.  It is a small thing, but wouldn't you think that a 4-Star rated resort would have a computer system sophisticated enough to remind the front-desk that this is your 31st arrival.   Believe me, I'm kind and courtious to all the staff, they work hard...I'm not a complainer nor rude,  In this case Arizona Grand...you need to ratchet your service back up.", "business_id": "I941jBn1KURuN-2wygJ_5A", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-06-30", "type": "review"}

We did not buy that deal, we were regular customers...\n\nOk, starting at the beginning.  \n\n- Check-in is 4:00pm.  We got there at 3:50pm, arrived to a line of no less than 30 people.  NO rooms were available for us.  They temporarily checked us in and said we could go to the water park and call back in an hour to see if a room was ready... but, the only place to change was at the Athletic Club clear on the opposite side of the park.  By the time we hiked over there and back it was 5pm.  Our room wasn't ready until 6:40 (we called about 5 times until they finally had one ready.)  \n\n- The room was HOT.  It was on the top floor and really never cooled down, even after we removed a gross, dirty air filter (I'll be posting a picture in case you're into looking at icky stuff.)  If you're one of those people who likes it very quiet to sleep, top floor is bad.\n\n- Also, on the noise topic, our bathtub dripped so bad it sounded like the faucet was on a slow trickle the whole time.  Water wasters!  Side note, the bathroom was so small you had to step out of the way to shut the door.  A large person might need to step into the tub to shut the door. :(\n\n- Gross... there were several places of STICKY on the carpeting.  2 were right in places where normal people put their feet all the time so that was annoying and nobody should have been in that room until that was cleaned (but they were completely sold out because of the LivingSocial.com deal.)\n\n- The railings along the walkways to our room seem 'flimsy' to an acrophobe like me.  If you have small children, or rowdy older kids, you might ask for a room on a different floor.  A lower floor, closer to the ground... safer.\n\n- The Oasis water park was ok, but the staff had no continuity.  One person would allow a 47\" child to ride the slide, another wouldn't.  One day they didn't care if your floats were by your seats while you ate lunch, the next day they were collecting them just for getting out of the water.  And so on and so forth...  And any time you get a bunch of people staying at a resort they wouldn't normally be able to afford, you're going to get a class of people that are... sub-par.  We saw at least 2 instances of people just taking other peoples chaises, even when they clearly had their personal stuff (shoes, shirts) stored there.  There was considerable pushing and shoving to get in the water, lots of unsupervised, rude 8-12 year old kids.  All of this was a nuisance that probably is not a regular issue.\n\n\n\nTHE HOTEL DID TRY TO MAKE RIGHT BY US.  We only complained about having to wait for a room for so long and they ended up cutting our hotel rate in half (which was then less than those LivingSocial.com folks) and giving us vouchers for drinks (6) and enough vouchers to cover our lunch (for 6 people.)  So they were aware of how screwed up things were.  We didn't complain about the room or the park as it was so incredibly busy it didn't seem worth it.", "business_id": "I941jBn1KURuN-2wygJ_5A", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-07-29", "type": "review"}

From the old days of being South Mountain Hilton till now, it has remained modern and first class.", "business_id": "I941jBn1KURuN-2wygJ_5A", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-06-21", "type": "review"}

Someone recommended the Arizona Grand Resort and we couldn't be happier. It's a short drive from the airport, I think a taxi is around $20. We stayed in the Sedona Suites and also held our meeting there. The lobby is beautiful, the meeting room is perfectly adequate with a nice veranda, the guest rooms were nice, the catering was great, and there were two swimming pools in the courtyard. It's also just a short 5 minute walk to the waterpark and the gym. No one in their right mind holds a meeting in Phoenix in August, so the place wasn't crowded and the staff were very accommodating. I don't know the exact prices, but daily room rates were around $109-$139 (minus resort fee) - pretty sure that's a low season rate because it was over 105 degrees every day.\n\nThe meeting room was standard hotel stuff, AV worked fine, no windows. The nicest part was having a veranda right across the way so we could have breakfast outside. The staff were always present and courteous. The catering food was much better than expected (especially the chicken and steak fajitas and the salads), since those that tried the on-site restaurants were very disappointed. Someone tried the stone massage at the spa and really enjoyed it. The fitness center is huge with a lap pool - it really is like a full gym rather than the typical hotel gym. They have short hiking trails around the property - too hot to enjoy, but a couple of us managed to do about 20 minutes of walking, where we got to see cacti and rabbits. The main lobby also has a nice bar and pool table.\n\nBest of all, it was a hit with the kids (ages 2-9). No child likes having their parents stuck in a meeting all day, but easy access to the water park was a great consolation. The most popular attractions were the \"lazy river\" inner tubing and the water slides. It's so hot you can only stay for a couple of hours, but the guest rooms were a short walk away so you can slip back into the cool air conditioning (and eat in your room rather than at the park to avoid the high prices). The catering also allowed for kid-friendly food like cut fruit, cookies and brownies, chicken tenders, quesadillas, muffins, and egg sandwiches. Other highlights for the kids were being driven in golf carts (seriously, one of their favorite parts) and visiting the Heard Museum of American Indian art and history.", "business_id": "I941jBn1KURuN-2wygJ_5A", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-08-12", "type": "review"}

I am here to participate in a charitable volunteer training/mentoring weekend.  I haven't stayed here since it changed hands and left the Hilton brand several years ago. It didn't have to use \"grand\" in its name because it was but it's not anymore.  \n\nThe change in hotel management was almost immediately apparent the moment I set foot inside the re-located lobby which is neither grand or befitting of a resort with that name. It looks like the timeshare property it has become.  The original lobby was located in what is now the conference center which ironically looks more like a lobby than a suite of meeting and ballrooms.\n\nThings went south during the check-in process which was just minutes before 4 pm, the customary time of arrival.  Low and behold, after checking in my traveling companion, I was informed that my room was not ready.  I can understand how that happens in smaller properties but in a resort of this size, that is indicative of poor management vis a vis housekeeping or allowing late check-outs of guests.\n\nIn any event, I was willing to let this faux pas slide and deal with it until about a half an hour ago, (nearly 9 pm) when I attempted to enter my room.  Mind you now that I had to RETURN to the front desk, wait in line AGAIN for another 10 minutes to determine if my room was ready and get a key.  I got the key but it was the wrong size!  Apparently this property has card locks with different widths because the key I was given was too wide and would not fit into the activation slot on the door.  So . . . . \n\nI had to call the hotel from my cell phone . . . get transferred to the front desk and then wait about 10 minutes for security to arrive to let me into my room while I stood in the shadows with my luggage scattered at the entry door.  Now I am waiting for him to return (it's been a half a hour) with the correct key.  Good thing I'm not an early to bed kind of guy.  At least I have time to finish this scathing review.\n\nThis property is old and tired.  The employees are young and come from a generation that is unfamiliar with the value and meaning of genuine guest services.  They are awkward, lacking confidence and apparently even basic check in skills.  The correct procedure would have been for them to call me when my room was ready, meet me at the room and present the key to me.  I've experienced more professional service at a Rodeway Inn.\n\nThe cost of my room and some meals has been covered by the organization sponsoring this event but that should not be an excuse for sub-par service and inexperience.  I am glad that I did NOT pay for this less than memorable experience. We had a buffet dinner in the Grand Ballroom which was Mexican themed and acceptable but not remarkable.  Glad I didn't pay for that either.  I count my blessings that I wasn't charged the $40 per day \"resort fee\".  Why don't they just add it to the room rate anyway instead of collecting it separately?  It's not voluntary.  I've gotten nicer hotel rooms on Priceline for $40 per night in the off season down here in the Valley of Hell.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how the remainder of this weekend goes.  If it's anything like the last 5.5 hours it's not going to be very pretty.\n\nAs for the rest of the resort . . . I presume the on premises water park is still enjoyable and maintained.  Unless you're coming with your family in tow to enjoy the lazy river and water slides, save yourself some frustration and go to a known brand like the Westin Kierland or Marriot Desert Ridge.\n\nBy the way, Mr. Security said he'd be back in 5 minutes with the correct keys.  It's been nearly 45 minutes so I called the front desk and a bellmen arrived about 5 minutes later.  I wonder if they would have shown up if I hadn't called to remind them.", "business_id": "I941jBn1KURuN-2wygJ_5A", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-08-23", "type": "review"}

Everyone was very friendly and welcoming. As for the resort itself, I'd give it 0 if I could. It was far from what I expected for a family vacation. The website made it appear much more GRAND than it really is.\n\nThe rooms are outdated and dirty. We got a king suite and the size was OK except the bathroom. It was very small and all the fixtures felt cheap. The air conditioner was turned to 61 but the room didn't get below 78 degrees the whole time we were there. We were traveling with our 2 girls and the plan was to have them sleep on the pullout couch in the living area of the suite. First, when you pull out the sofa it obliterates all living space. To get out of the room we had to climb over the coffee table. ( I considered putting it outside the room, that's how difficult it was to move around.) When the girls went to lay on the sofa bed it was actually painful. The mattress is all springs with no mattress left. It's obviously old and the resort is obviously aware of this. When we called to say that the bed was unacceptable they brought a couple of pieces of foam which succeeded in covering the springs but made for a very hard surface. Luckily the hard surface was a moderately acceptable solution as it was the only one the hotel had, other than paying hundreds more for a Villa. The king bed in the bedroom was old and tired too. \n\nThe general building and grounds are TIRED!!! I opened my french doors onto the \"deck\" and couldn't even step out there it was so covered in something undefinable. Clearly, this area does not get cleaned or maintained at all. Some of the areas appear to have been updated recently but those are few and far between. For the most part, the grounds were dank and dreary. \n\nHousekeeping must be overworked. They didn't clean our room daily though their cart sat outside our room most of the day. I don't know if daily cleaning would mitigate a cockroach problem but we found a few and they were HUGE. Also, when we called for more pillows, blankets, robes, etc. if they ever arrived it was after a very long time. For 2 of our requests, slippers to cover our feet from what felt like a very dirty floor and an additional robe, the requested items never arrived. \n\nFor on site restaurants, the website led us to think there were several choices on site. Two of them were either a long walk away or a golf cart ride. The breakfast in the lobby restaurant was decent quality. Aunt Chilada's was worth the walk: delicious nachos and excellent margaritas! Didn't try the steak house. \n\nThe Oasis Water Park was not as advertised... The wave pool was a joke. They turn on the \"waves\" every 10 minutes. It's difficult to tell the difference between when they're on and when they're off. The 8 story slides are cool but the lines could become 20 people long at any time of day. The other slide was fun but again, long lines. The lazy river was always packed with people. If you wanted to eat while at the water park you were forced to order their mediocre food at outrageous prices. \n\nThe most positive part of our stay was the staff, with the exception of housekeeping. Everyone was friendly and helpful. \n\nIf you're planning a water park or resort vacation I'd recommend you look elsewhere until they upgrade the rooms and grounds. There's not much the Resort will ever be able to do about the overcrowding in the Oasis. It's a big hotel and everyone who stays there has access to it.

The hotel should include breakfast for what it charges. The food is extremely expensive but served in large portions. Went on the 4th expecting some festivities or for the pool to be open later. Nope. Wish the pool hours were 10:30 am to 10:30 PM at least instead of 9:30 to 9:30.

The Oasis Waterpark has two large slides, one smaller, winding slide, a nice, long lazy river, a wave pool as well as other swimming areas.  There are tons of lounge chairs and shade.  The area is nice and clean.  There is one way in and one way out which, as a mom with children, I appreciate.  Summer, during the week, is an awesome time to go.  \n\nAlthough check in is at 4pm and check out at 11am, you can start using the facilities at noon on the day you check in whether your room is ready or not.  And, on the day of check out, you still have to check out at 11am but, you can stay and use the facilities until they close that night.  That alone made the trip worth it!  We had looked at several other local waterpark resorts and they all had a 4pm check in and their water park closed at 7pm and didn't open until 10 am the next morning but check out was at 11am and they did not allow you to use the facilities either before or after check in so, if you were only there for one night, you got a total of 4 hours water park time.  \n\nThe rooms are all suites with either a king bed or 2 queens and then a queen pull out sofa.  The pull out bed is beyond ridiculous.  The mattress is so thin you can see and feel every spring.  It's brutally uncomfortable.  I requested an additional comforter from housekeeping to try to cushion the mattress but they refused saying they could only give us a blanket.  They ended up bringing us a very thin, worn and stained blanket which really did nothing to help the situation.  Next time, We will bring a comforter or an egg crate or something from home to cushion the mattress.  But, the rooms are clean and large.  \n\nAlso, the elevators and ice machines weren't in working order.  We were on the first floor - sent to the 3rd floor for ice but the ice machine wasn't working.  Went back down, called the front desk again who sent up back up to the 4th floor - opposite corner - for ice.  Pretty irritating after a long day at the pool.  \n\nOther than that, we enjoyed our stay.  And, if you're a return guest, they offer great discounts. \n\nWe ended up not eating at the Lobby Grill this time because they didn't have the breakfast buffet.

The beds were worn spring mattresses that were sunken down in the middle - especially the bed positioned in front of the TV (yes, only one bed has a direct view of the TV unless you angle it). The elevator by our room was also broken, which sucks when you are traveling with a disabled family member. We had to walk to either end of our building to access the elevators, which was a pain in the ass since we only needed to go down one level. The ice machine on our floor was also busted, so I had to hike up a level several times to retrieve ice throughout our stay.

It is a huge place, but staff will give you a ride anywhere you need to go in the complex, and some places outside. \n\nI've read some reviews that say the place is very dated, but I only found that to be moderately true (though they still only have a CD player clock next to the bed...I can't remember when last I saw one of those dinosaurs). \nThe rooms are very spacious, and the beds are comfortably made.\n\nI stayed in the Camelback suites.. The pool is awesome and the courtyard has a very rustic euro-mexican feel. The elevators are SOOOO slow though, I feel sorry for those assigned to the top floor rooms.\n\nThe room mini fridge cooled anything in it down to about 80 degrees. Staff told us \"it's not really for keeping things cool..don't leave perishables in it for more than a day\".. Soooo.. whats the point of even calling it a fridge? The temperature inside it was warmer than the temperature of the (excellently) air conditioned room...\n\nAre you starting to see what I mean about mixed feelings?\n\nI agree with other reviewers that the water park food and beverage prices are exorbitant..especially considering the $40+ resort fee we were paying.. I could even live with this if they allowed paying guests to bring their own non-glass beverages, but they pretty much frisk you at the entrance and then price gouge the hell out of you when you get a little thirsty inside.. This was very disappointing. \n\nRoom service meals came to the room very quickly, but were of mediocre quality. If you want to eat, go to the Lobby Grill which is excellent. With room service they add a 23% service fee and a $4 imaginary fee...and when the meal is delivered they still expect a tip. By this time you are paying 40%+ of the room service menu prices, which are already very high for such mediocre food.\n\nMaybe I should have given 2 stars, but I really had a pleasant stay and enjoyed the large rooms. \n\nMy feelings were so mixed about this place, but with the great low season rate I got on Priceline, I won't complain too much. At a high season rate, none of this would have been acceptable in the slightest.", "business_id": "I941jBn1KURuN-2wygJ_5A", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-08-15", "type": "review"}

I tried to explain we had 14 people and still they said no reservations, just walk in. Not satisfied with the answer I called back and asked to speak with the manager. He said they do in fact take reservations and that they were no longer accepting reservations for the evening because they were full. Isn't that a better answer than saying we don't take reservations? He said if we were to walk in it would be about an hour and a half wait and rushed me off the phone.

It was near Arizona Mills and Fry's Electronic Store. For some reason though we had trouble locating the check-in lobby when we got there and had to turn around. \n\nCheck-in:\nCheck in was mediocre with an explanation of things on site. They end up giving you a little card packet with your mini-bar key, room keys and WiFi Password\n\nRoom: \nRoom was really just...okay. I felt that for the amount of money that we paid ($250+taxes+resort fee) that we would have had a little better room. We even upgraded $20/night to be closer to the water park. The beds was not very comfortable compared to other hotels well below this price range and forget sleeping on the sleeper sofa. If you like to feel the springs poking on your back, then I guess that is the place for you. I had to use the sofa cushions as extra cushions for my kids so it would not poke them. Also, DO NOT eat anything from the MINI-BAR...that is unless you want to pay $4.50 for a $0.50 pack of M&M's. I made sure to keep this key away from my kids. \n\nPOOL:\nAgain, I was not completely impressed with the pool considering the high price of the resort. They had a wave pool, a lazy river and some slides. My kids would have been happy with just the pool section as they were not even big enough for the slides. \n\nRESTAURANTS: \nWe had the \"Stay and Play Package\" which gave us $50 credit towards two restaurants on site that also allowed us to have kids Eat Free under 12. We ate at both restaurants called Lobby Bar and Grill and Aunt Chilada's. If you find my review on Yelp of Aunt Chiladas, you'd find out that I would rather go to a Taco Bell again rather than this place. It was really bad and I'm not even sure how they can call most of their food \"Mexican Food\". Lobby bar and grill was delicious though and if I were to do it again, I would have eaten there each day to use that $50 credit. Also, eating in the pool area is extremely expensive..and if you want an alcoholic drink be prepared to pay up. It's $11.25 for most mixed drinks that are not even that strong. \n\nPrice: \nI felt that they had a lot of charges on top of charges, There was the base price, the room tax, room fees, resort tax, etc. The Resort Fee was $47/night!!!!!! Yeah, that was the highest resort fee I've ever paid. Just for comparison, both the Bellagio and the Wynn in Las Vegas have a resort fee of $32/night. \n\nOverall: \nI would probably never stay at this resort again unfortunately. It was just too high priced for what was given. For two nights with the stay and play package it was around $550.

The property is truly beautiful; the rooms were clean with soundproof walls; the beds were comfy; the Oasis water park and other on-site pools were superfun; and with the exception of a newer (young female) desk employee in the spa, the service we rec'd from everyone on staff was top notch.  \n\nThe Oasis water park was so much fun!  Loved the slides and Lazy River. My family had a blast playing water volleyball and basketball in a pool adjacent to the wave pool.  So many pool possibilities.  Not crowded on a Friday and a relief in the 108-115 degree heat.  \n\nWe enjoyed breakfasts and a room-service/late night dinner from the lobby restaurant, as well as desserts and drinks in the lobby bar.  All times, we rec'd great quality food and presentation.  The entire wait staff was wonderful, as well. While we didn't get a chance to check out the on-property steakhouse (Rustler's Roost), we did have dinner at the on-property Mexican restaurant (Aunt Chilada's) one evening.  It is similar to an El Torito's or Chevy's franchise restaurant - not bad, but not great either.\n\nThe reason I'm not giving full, 5 star status is due to an issue we experienced relating to a lack of time management and customer service at the spa with coordinating multiple spa packages.  While the services themselves were wonderful, there was confusion and a lack of coordination, as well as incorrect times given for our party of 4.  Needless to say, it didn't lend to the stress-free environment we were hoping for.  It also didn't help that a newer female desk employee was terse, snitty, and not exactly customer-friendly to my husband (who was celebrating his birthday that day) over the phone when he called down to verify spa appointments - especially since spa staff never contacted us with verification of our services. \n\nOn-site costs for services, meals, and sundries/goods are understandably pricey (you're paying for convenience), however they were comparable to other resorts we've stayed at.  The overall value for a family of four staying in two separate/adjoining suites - including roundtrip airfare from CA and a rental car - was affordable and reasonable for our middle-class budget.  The $47/day resort fee was expected and also reasonable.  It included passes for the Oasis water park as well as access to all property pools, the spa, the athletic club, and adjacent hiking trails.  It also included on-site parking and WiFi which - contrary to others' experience on here - was decent.\n\nAll-in-all, I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a fun family weekend, romantic getaway, 'staycation', or girl's weekend.

The first car they tried to put me in was a Camry with the front bumper hanging off. The next two cars were extremely dirty: windshield had so many bugs and dirt you could barely see through, stains on the seats, etc. I would recommend going a few miles out and finding a better rental place or even a different Enterprise in nearby Gilbert or Scottsdale, where the cars are actually clean and nice in those areas.", "business_id": "-5bLhMLNGbIVyoPOVl0yLg", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-06-28", "type": "review"}

After a long drive from Los Angeles, I was extremely pleased with this location, except you don't have to make a U-turn to enter.  Very nice helpful staff. Was pleased to see the parking big and bright. Night time desk was quick and helpful. Up to our 2nd floor no-smoking room by elevator,  Walking to our room, I was impressed at how clean everything was.Yet it did smell from cigarette smoke. Just why do these smokers get a floor for no smokers?  Our room was big and clean. Bathroom was fantastically clean; no scum  or mold anywhere. No paint peeling. Shower was awesome. Didn't use the soap dispenser because the labels were all gone and I couldn't tell what was what. But then again, who travels without their soaps? All room amenities worked. Large screen T.V.,fridge,microwave,coffee maker,all were clean and worked perfectly. Even had a iron and a board.  Arizona is known to be hot, and it was 110 (June 1st)  but the room A/C worked great. Bed pillows, for me were too soft...but that's me. I was hoping for a area with fresh eggs and rolls, Got a room with dispensers of OJ and apple juice, waffle maker, some rolls, cereal and yogurt. No eggs. :(  \nBest part was the check out, Carol is a doll!!! She is sweet and personable...not the norm for hotels with incense and poor English speaking desk people with bad attitudes from lands that tolerate bad service.  I will have to come back....at least just to say hi to Carol!\nThe word for this place is CLEAN!", "business_id": "a-U3SLb6j_M3AYzMAKwK_g", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-06-03", "type": "review"}

Some are white (newer) and some are a really dingy off-white. I don't think that they realize this when they drape the smaller ones in layers over the bigger ones. The really dingy ones really stand out against the newer white towels. The older dingy towels also have frayed edges etc. \nThe room was ok. Nothing fancy but had a bed and couch and desk. All cheaper stuff, but the place is safe.\nIt is located in a super location. It is hard to find at first as it is behind a McDonald's and a Denny's. So they are easy walking distance. In fact if you give your room number at the register at Denny's then you get 20% off your bill and Denny's is open 24 hours so that is a good thing. Also there is a large mall on the other side of it so all kinds of stores in the general vicinity. \nThe free breakfast isn't bad. You get cereal, milk, orange juice, danishes, scrambled eggs (always were super dry), sausage links (actually really good!), gravy which I didn't try. Also yogurt and bread for toasting. Oh! and a waffle maker. \nWe were gone from our room most of the day. The first day we left the room at 6:30am and returned at 8pm. Well the housekeeper decided to save the hotel money and turned OFF our AC and it was August! ugh! We made sure to leave a note on the AC from then on to leave it where it was set. At midnight the first night the room was still in the 90's as the small AC just couldn't bring it down quickly.\nRemember to get your free newspaper at the front desk each morning too.", "business_id": "bgTN98cv4PVgy_RJ9QOzyA", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-08-27", "type": "review"}

We stayed there for 3 days if I remember correctly. It was clean and reasonably priced with our government discount. We had a dbl queen room on the 3rd floor. I don't remember to much more about this stay.\n\nThe most recent stay was on August 5th. I stopped here again due to location and rates. I did not have a reservation but they had several rooms available. I opted for a King Deluxe room this time (I have stayed at other La Quintas and stayed in the King suites; if you don't need that separate sitting room and couch the King Deluxe is sufficient). It has a nice desk with office chair, another sitting chair, recliner, dresser with flat screen TV. and to night stands on either side of the bed. It also comes with a mini fridge and microwave. \n\nThe hotel was clean and the staff was very friendly. I paid $86 for a Friday night (very reasonable- the king suite usually runs you about $100) It is cheaper if you book on-line or have a Government or AAA discount, I believe the accept AARP as well. On-line booking usually saves you about $20.\n\nThe best part of it is they accept pets at this location (some of their locations do not). They do not charge extra for pets, they just have you sign an agreement about damages your pet may make and give you a list of rules like having your pet on  a leash at all times (your usual pet policies). \n\nThey have a continental breakfast from 7am - 10am; I did not try it but there were a lot of people partaking in the breakfast. They also have an outdoor pool. \n\nThe only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was due to the noise level. You can hear people in the hall when you are in your room and  you can hear people in their rooms when you are in the hall. The other reason is they did not have a vending machine or ice machine on my level (level 2).
