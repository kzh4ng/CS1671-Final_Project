My husband generally orders Chicken Parm, which is very good. Their sauce is quite good. They serve fresh bread with a plate of olive oil and balsamic vinegar for dipping -- yum.\n\n I generally order one of their house salads (think it has a specific name, but can't recall off the top of my head) which has mixed greens and I get it with blue cheese, pine nuts and their yummy vinaigrette. A tad pricey for a salad that's just lettuce and cheese (I want to say about $8 with the extras), but really good. (Especially with some cracked black peeper.) I tend to follow this up with a smaller plate like their red pepper app or the greens & beans. \n\nThe place has sort of a rustic atmosphere and can be on the loud side. It has a comfortable feeling. It also has a solid wine by the glass selection -- better than a lot of places in the 'burgh. \n\nUnfortunately, we've never had dessert there b/c we get so full of bread and dinner!", "business_id": "P1fJb2WQ1mXoiudj8UE44w", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-08-15", "type": "review"}

It was a large portion made up of 2 sliced zucchinis.\n\nWe ordered a variety of dishes.  The pasta dish was dry with more pasta than sauce or meat.  Those who ordered the fish special thought it was delicious.  The shrimp dish was enjoyed as well.  I had the chicken marsala which was pretty good.

In the short time that he was there, a man who was behind the bar looked at him and then turn away without saying a word or notifying anyone else. He then turned to a waitress who had approached the service area of the bar and asked her if  we could have a server take our drink order. She said \"yep\" and then abruptly turned and walked away. At that point, he asked to see the manager  who came a few minutes later. When my friend told him of what had occurred, the manager said \"What do you want me to do\"?\n\nMy friend said \"An apology would be a good start\" whereupon the manager looked back at him and said \"Get out and don't come back\" ????????

Was trying to go to a different place. Glad the Pizza Gods were looking out for me. Ordered a caesar salad with anchovies and a large pizza with sausage and mushrooms. The salad was fresh and excellent. Dressing was made fresh and the anchovies were top notch. There is a wide variety of anchovies when it comes to quality and they use excellent ones. There was also plenty of them as usually you get a sparse amount. The large salad was more that enough for my wife and I. They serve a bread basket with two styles of bread. Pepper cheese and a standard Italian with a harder crust. They were both so good I purchased a loaf of each on the way out. Price per loaf was only $4. No way they make profit on the Pepper Cheese Loaf. Best value in bread in quite some time. I will stop in for the bread whenever I am in the area. The Pepper Cheese I would rate a 9.5 out of 10. The Italian was as good as it gets. I am a Pizza snob and getting a good review from me is tough. I am so tough I do not review if I think its bad. There Pizza is excellent and I would recommend it to anyone remotely close to the place. I would ask for a little less sauce. I would call it almost NY Style. Slightly thicker crust. I asked the waiter if I should order it well done and he said order it as is. He was correct and it came out perfect.

The chicken had a nice golden color to its breading and tasted pretty good although a bit salty.  I can take at least some credit for that though as I may have used the Parmesan that was on the table quite liberally.  Meanwhile the broccoli was over cooked for my tastes and seemed mushy whenever I bit into it.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I might stop by here again in the future.

It ended up being a small little restaurant in the middle of Point Breeze which I had been past many times previously but never really noticed.\n\nThe restaurant was swamped whenever we got there, probably due to a combination of it being Friday night and restaurant week, so thankfully we had made reservations and were seated almost immediately.  I decided to start off my meal with a salad while my girlfriend had the tomato garlic bisque.  My salad was good and came with goat cheese, pears and a vinaigrette which all tasted nicely.  It was nothing amazing but I think it takes a really special salad to be amazing.  I also tried my girlfriends bisque and unsurprisingly found it to be a bit tomato-y since I do not enjoy tomatoes very much but she really enjoyed it.  For my entree I decided to get two small plates instead of a larger entree and settled on the mac n cheese and fish tacos.  The tacos were a bit sloppy/wet but had some nice flavors (cilantro, aoili and pico) in them along with some chili sauce that gave it a nice little kick.  My mac n cheese came out in its own little cast iron type pot and was good.  There was an adequate amount of cheese throughout and I liked that they even had some ricotta buried inside the dish.  I was also able to try the Arrabbita that one of our dining companions had ordered.  Wow was it good and it packed quite the spicy punch too.  Immediately I regretted not ordering it although I still did enjoy my two small plates.  For my dessert course I ended up having the White Chocolate Creme Brulee.

I started off with a mixed green salad with grileld pears, walnuts and goat cheese. The pears had a nice smokeyness about them that complimented the sweet vinagarette. For my entree, I chose the Arrabiata with rigatoni. The dish was very good but much more spicy than I had expected. I feel that they should have informed me of this or explained the spice level on the menu. Luckily, I enjoy spicy food but I was unable to finish the entree due to the spice level. It was slightly less spicy when I finished it for lunch the next day. My husband had the veal and risotto which he loved. For dessert, I orderedthe peach mille feuille. The portion size was enormous and the peaches were ripe and tasty. However, the marscapone filling hardly tasted of marscapone. I had the opportunity to try my husband's white chocolate tiramisu and was pleasantly surprised by the light but still rich flavors.

I selected the baked eggplant caprese appetizer, Lazy Man lasagna Florentine and then the panna cotta for dessert. \n\nBaked eggplant caprese: the breaded eggplant was a soggy mess. \nLazy Man Lasagna Florentine: it was essentially two huge lasagna noodles sandwiching huge clumps of spinach (I'm talking like a 3-inch high pile of clumped spinach) with a few mushrooms peppered in. The spinach ratio was out of control and I honestly ate a few bites and couldn't even continue. \nPanna cotta: this was the most decent of the items we ordered.\n\nMy friend ordered off the regular menu, which she advised not to do since her food would come out at a different time?? Why? \nWe tried my friend's appetizer of the Italian Fries, which are described on the menu as sounding very similar to the amazing fries at Point Brugge...but it was just a bowl of regular French fries, which were lackluster and misleading. She also got the house soup with chickpeas and it looked like Spaghetti-o's and tasted even worse.\n\nI don't know where all the positive reviews are coming from.

Both the veal chop and the cutlet melted in our mouths.\n\nAll in all, after a couple apps, two entrees, a bottle of wine and a couple cocktails, we got out for about $260 after tip.  That said, I've eaten at some amazing restaurants in my time, and I can say with confidence that last night's dinner is easily one of the top 5 meals I've had in my lifetime.  I can't wait to find an excuse to go back.\n\nWell done, Alla Famiglia.\n\n\nUpdate:  Visits 2 and 3 to Alla Famiglia were just as spectacular as the first.  My wife and I have ordered something different each time we've visited, and normally I'd say something like 'we haven't been disappointed'.  However, that would be an egregious understatement.  Every visit to this wonderful restaurant has been nothing short of  astonishing.  The food is truly breathtaking, and the service is top notch.\n\nIn my humble opinion, this is without question the best restaurant in Pittsburgh.\n\n\nUpdate 2:  As you can see by the number of check-ins I have here, we find every excuse we can to continue to come here.  It is still the best restaurant in the 'Burgh.", "business_id": "qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-07-18", "type": "review"}

I have never eaten there before last night, but I have eaten at Davio's and that is what the atmosphere reminded me of.. we were there a total of 3 hours start to finish.. 3 hours until our main course was served. But, many courses are served as you wait... most of them were delicious. They bring you out fresh, delicious, warmed bread at the beginning with a garlic oil sauce dubbed \"holy oil\" and it truly is heavenly. They also have a bowl of cheese and garbanzo beans to eat atop of the bread. Delicious. There is also a cheesy spread available. All were wonderful. Then about 45 minutes later, they brought our appetizer. It was a soupy-looking mushroom appetizer with a sweet flavor. I do not recommend this app. It wasn't good. Then about 35 minutes after that, a salad was served. It came dressed and was one of the best I've had. 35-45 minutes after that, the HIGHLIGHT of the dinner came. Pasta in a bowl. It was the best part of the dinner. Finally another long time after that - our main course came. Mine looked only slightly better than it tasted. I got the seafood diavolo and it was a huge disappointment.\n I really liked our waiter - he was very busy but attentive - but I cursed him under my breath for recommending this main course. I was so close to ordering a pasta dish, which I'm certain I would have loved and devoured. But I was talked out of ordering pasta, because pasta comes with dinner. I wish our waiter would have asked me what I liked; sauces, etc before recommending this dish. $68 for something you give to your cat is a hard pill to swallow. I love seafood, but I enjoy it in butter sauces, lemony butter sauces, Alfredo sauces, wince sauces with garlic... not this red soupy dish.\n It was literally like eating cold tomatoes and water with Tabasco sauce poured in. It looked like \"seafood soup.\" All the delicious seafood was drowning in a dark red, spicy, soupy mess. I wanted to cry when I saw it.. then I tasted it and really wanted to cry. It was gross. This is the last dish I would have ever ordered had I known how it was presented. I looked around at my date who had a massive veal tenderloin in front of him and I was so jealous.. wishing I had went with my first instinct - the pasta - or even the Halibut.. anything that wasn't drowning in a spicy red soup. I just hope that staff read this and never recommend this dish to a first-timer.. especially someone who enjoys seafood they can actually TASTE that isn't drowning in some spicy tomato sauce. If this dish wasnt so awful, I would have given 5 stars. The only other bad dish was the mushroom appetizer, and it was also a soupy mess. but, i would eat the mushroom app 3 times a day for the rest of my life if it came down to that and the seafood diavolo.", "business_id": "qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-08-15", "type": "review"}

We had reservations for 7:30 on a Tuesday, so we obviously figured we would be seated immediately.  The brother and his girlfriend arrived a couple minutes before the reservation and were told to go up to the bar while they set the table and wait for the rest of the party.  I arrived about a minute after and my husband a few minutes behind me as he needed to park due to the lack of valet during the week.  There was no one at the host stand when either of us came in.  So we went up to the bar, declined a drink... and waited, and waited.  The bartender soon became deeply involved in picking a wine for a couple at the bar, not his fault.  The brother eventually was able to flag down a waitress to ask if she could check on our table.  She looked very annoyed.  She eventually went over to the phone at the bar, called down, hung up the phone and said, dead pan, \"no, it's not ready yet.\"  Not a smile, not a sorry, not a \"can we get you a drink on the house?\" Meanwhile, there was an open table for 4 on that floor.  The bartender eventually told us \"that's for a reservation.\" \"Yes, we have a reservation... for 25 minutes ago.\"  \"They must have specifically requested that table.\"  They did, however, offer us the table right next to the door on the first floor though - the one with the 10 degree breeze coming in that night.  No thank you.  We were very insulted by the lack of table for our reservation, but more so by the lack of acceptable service.  We decided to leave and spend $20 on pizza instead of $100+ per person and enjoyed much better service.. which is never the way it should be.  Hopefully they solve this problem soon.  We'll give it one more go when the insult has worn off.\n\nMy husband won't hesitate to tell you what his favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh is: Alla Famiglia.  And to be honest, these days I agree with him!  \n\nWhile my husband enjoys many of the more \"up and coming\" restaurants with smaller portions and interesting flavor combinations, he often finds himself longing for the same quality food with better cuts of meat and bigger portions.  This is where we satisfy both of our appetites for big flavor and, well, big portions.  But to reduce Alla Famiglia to those two things alone would not do it justice.\n\nLet's start out instead with addressing the two biggest critiques of this place: its location and the price.  Yes, it is in Allentown, but they also have plenty of parking and valet if you prefer.  Honestly, we drive almost everywhere to get dinner, so this is not an issue for us.  The other thing I always hear about is how expensive it is.  Some of those complaints come from people who I know have no problem giving their money to the big steakhouse chains, while getting a lot less value.  No, it is not cheap.  You will likely pay upwards of $50 for your entry.  The veal chops are close to $70.  But, that's not all you get.  You get delicious, fresh baked bread, a spread, dipping oil and gustoso for same, a delicious salad, and homemade pasta served family style.  If you wanted to be especially frugal, you could approach this place like an Olive Garden senior special: feast on the freebies and take your entree to go.  But, even if you're full, it may be too difficult not to savor the meal as it comes out...\n\nI've been here twice and my husband has been here three times (lucky - he got to go for work and he said they ordered almost every appetizer, all of which were apparently delicious).  The first time I ordered the filet with gorgonzola.  It was one of the most delicious and largest filets I've ever had.  My husband ordered a veal chop with prosciutto which I don't think I recognized on the current menu, but he absolutely loved it.  The veal chop is one of the largest bone-in cuts of meat I've seen and the sear on it was absolutely perfect.  We also ordered the mussels, which were spicy and delicious, and the meatball appetizer, which I remember being tasty, but nothing too out of the ordinary.  I think there are other things on the menu to try first. \n\nThe second time we came I ordered the Milanese veal chop, breaded, slightly citrusy, and absolutely heavenly.    He had the cowboy ribeye which was also large and an absolutely beautiful cut of meat.  The husband has a thing about fatty cuts and avoiding anything that is the least bit chewy, and he barely had to leave a piece on his plate.  We also got the calamari appetizer, which was perfectly, lightly fried with a savory, garlic sauce that sets it apart from the sweet sauces often served with calamari.\n\nFinally, I should note that the service we have received here has always been exceptional.  Everyone is always professional and courteous.", "business_id": "qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-08-15", "type": "review"}

The salad is one of the best salads I remember eating and could easily be enough for an appetizer.  The pasta tossed in a vodka sauce was just ok.  The homemade pasta is not actually made in house (I asked), but it is 'fresh,' which I'm assuming meant bought from a store on the strip or a market district.\n\nWe had also ordered the calamari and the meatball appetizer because we were starving and that proved to be way too much food for a family of 5.  If you must get an appetizer, I highly recommend the meatball, you will not regret.\n\nThe veal chop is easily the best thing on the menu and where Alla Famiglia really shines.  From all the pasta plates and steaks and seafood dishes that were ordered at our table, the veal chop was by the unanimous favorite at our table.  Incredible flavors and tender cuts, but by the time you get to the main course, you're full with the bread, salad, and pasta that comes before you can't really enjoy it fully.  Most plates come with a side of their grilled veggies (which again were ok), but some dishes come with nothing so I would make sure to ask if you need a side.   So long story short, this is a marathon and don't expect to be done in an hour and a half.  Pace so you can really enjoy that veal chop at the end!\n\nWhen you first walk in it seems very small, but there are back rooms and stairs that go up one or two floors.  There's also a back patio one floor up from ground floor.  It's tight sitting spaces, but very cute and authentically Italian.  \n\nSo now that we established that the ambiance and food are pretty solid, the thing that earned this 3 stars is how we were hosted to our table.  We had a reservation at 7:30pm and were 30minutes early, which we recognize is nowhere near to our reservation time so we elected to grab drinks and sit on the patio.  When 7:30 comes around we inquire about our table only to be told that there was not a sitting space yet, which would be ok minus the fact that there were multiple tables open that we asked about.  7:45 we asked again and were told that they were setting up a table immediately.  8:10 comes around and we're still not seated so had to ask the hostess again, which apologized and sat us at the table we had asked about 40 minutes ago when our reservation time was.  It took 40 minutes to seat us at our table for our reservation time of 7:30 when there were tables open.\n\nIt was a frustrating experience because everyone was hungry and we weren't even offered bread sitting on their patio...  The frustration unfortunately set the mood for the dinner and although our food was great, we didn't really enjoy the time we had here. \n\nWe really wanted to love Alla Famiglia.  Perhaps we'll try one more time and hope our experience is better.", "business_id": "qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-06-20", "type": "review"}

Both dishes were cooked perfectly - the Milanese was pan fried and a bit delicately flavored, but wonderful.  The service was very good, and all the staff were working very hard and quick, but were available to answer questions and assist us when needed.  I would recommend making reservations well in advance and trying to get one of the tables upstairs - a more quiet and intimate setting, also slightly more comfortable temperature wise for me.

Flavorful spinach and cheese pillows of pasta cooked al dente and smothered with tomato basil sauce with a touch of cream. Damn good pasta, my friends.\n\nCons:\n-Menu items price out a few dollars higher than similar Italian joints. But, the value is here, though, because of the increased portions. \n-Restaurant set up/ambiance: Is a bit odd.

It was not what I expected at all. Tiny I expected because I'd seen it driving by many times. Diner-esque inside, completely unexpected. I knew they are BYOB but after eating lunch here, I can't imagine any scenario where I'd take more than a couple of beers with me. Not a place to linger over a bottle of wine. Tables on top of each other, cramped and kind of a low end divey diner, uh uh.\n\nI wanted the mussels for lunch but was told they were out of them. Not terribly disappointed because our server had just run through the lunch specials and one had caught my attention enough that I mentally considered changing my mind anyway. A fried zucchini plank sandwich with melted mozzarella and side of sauce. I do love a good zucchini plank and had never heard of anyone creating a sandwich out of them, so no hardship to change my order. \n\nThat was a greasy, good lunch sandwich....heavy on the greasy but, I've always loved some tasty 'fried deliciousness!'\n\nHubs had the sausage sandwich... good...but mine was the clear winner.\nStarter soups were homemade and tasty. Hubby had black bean and I had the chicken pastine, aka wedding soup. The broth rivaled my premium homemade Christmas chicken soup broth so no complaints on that. \n\nOverall: ambiance 1star, mine and hubby's sandwiches 3 stars, soup 4 stars. Average is a 3 - not rushing back but I'd clearly have lunch there again, if I'm across the street.", "business_id": "q_BKmbdlYfQJroJVHfYMUQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-07-04", "type": "review"}

Friends told me it wasn't worth it but I persisted to the point that we went there for lunch yesterday. My first reaction was not a pleasant one. The cheap plastic chairs, the small close together tables, the tacky decorations, not a good feel but I pressed on. \n\nNow, I didn't avail myself of the BYOB (might have resulted in a higher rating!!) and it was only lunch so I can't comment on dinner. Regrettably, I won't ever try them for dinner so this is the best I can offer.  I think Legends in their name only applies to the sports heroes and not any legendary food experience you'll find here. \n\nThe place is essentially a diner. Diner atmosphere, diner chairs, diner specials, diner everything. Not that I don't appreciate diners, I do. But this atmosphere is BLAH.  I'd rate it a max of 2 stars. Max. \n\nFood on the other hand is ok. Not great. Ok. Worth going out of your way for? Absolutely not. I had the Parma hot sausage with a bowl of black bean soup- both things I love!!! We're these memorable? Not in the least. It's generous to say they were adequate. \"Mama's gravy\", a marinara sauce of sorts, was lackluster and flavorless. The sausage was just a split link of hot sausage and something I could replicate at home with ease. The black bean soup was listless and uninspired. Sad because i was expecting (hoping?) for so much more.  I wish I had ordered the chicken parm that the guys pressing up against me from behind ordered. It looked way better. But I'll not have that chance cause I won't be going back. I'll drive by this place a thousand times to go to other more deserving places on the Northside. \n\nSorry. Didn't do it for me.  Can't even imagine coming here for dinner with a bottle of wine. Would be awful.  I wanted to give it 2 stars but felt a little generous today.

That one word sums up our group of 15's experience at the Spaghetti Warehouse. This restaurant has been a Pittsburgh institution for so long; however, it left many in our group unsatisfied and hungry at the end. My mom ordered the roasted garlic shrimp and her dish was dry and the shrimp were over cooked to the point of too chewy. I ordered the chopped salad \"warehouse style\" as my main entree and it was a big salad. Yet the veggies in the salad weren't fresh and the warm chicken was burnt and wilted the lettuce with its heat. I sent it back without eating it (at least the waitress was kind enough to take it off of our bill). My fiance got the lasagna and chicken parm off of the classic combo section of the menu and his chicken was ok but not great. The lasagna was good too. However, neither were great.  My aunt and father were unimpressed with their dishes as well but I'm not sure what they got so I can't speak to their food quality.\n\nAlso, it took us an hour after we ordered to receive our food and our food was cold. Granted, I understand we have a party of 15 BUT the restaurant was not packed by any stretch of the means. In fact the room we sat in had approximately 10 open tables. I can't speak to how filled the other rooms of the restaurant were though. But there should not have been a hour wait nor should we have gotten cold food as a result of it. \n\nWe have booked this restaurant for our rehearsal dinner for our wedding but, considering how poor the food was and how incredibly slow the service was (no fault of the waitress), we are looking to change our reservations to a different restaurant. We chose the Spaghetti Warehouse because it is close to the hotel where all of our guests for our wedding are staying. Given how slow the service was, we can't afford to be there til 10:30pm at night when we have to be up at 6am the next morning for a very long day. (Another reviewer said that their rehearsal dinner group took 3+ hours to get out of there).  \n\nJust my 2 cents.  I wish the food quality and service were better.

Well you'd better get on that, so you can brag to all your hipster friends that you know the best bartender in Pittsburgh.\n\nSeriously though. Best.\n\nWe found Papa J's at random on July 4th last year because, in typical Pittsburgh fashion, it was raining. We were en route from the Point to Station Square when the skies opened up, and the nearest bar to duck into was Papa J's.\n\nWhat you need to know first is that Papa J's is a historic landmark - it's the oldest standing former brothel in the 'Burgh. The wall behind the bar is actually fitted with a headboard (rumored to be that of the brothel madam), and there's a red light at the stairs.\n\nThe decor is all deep wood, low lighting, and mysterious feel. Better yet? Papa J's is rumored to be haunted.\n\n(Because if cocktails at a haunted former brothel doesn't get you excited about drinking in Pittsburgh, nothing will.)\n\nOh, and that's where Frank comes in. Frank is the friendly older gentleman behind the bar who will go out of his way to serve you the finest cocktails and martinis in downtown Pittsburgh. They've got a great house drink list (including a Bloody-Mary-esque beverage called the 'Angry Malkin'), but Frank also has a 'secret' list that only us 'real serious' Papa J's guests know about. \n\nFrank's policy is this: if you can give him the list of ingredients and he has them, he will make you any drink under the sun. If he makes it and you think it's great, he writes the recipe down in his notebook and recommends it to others. One of his specialties is the Black Eyed Susan. It's the signature drink of the Preakness, and he'll tell you the story of how he learned to make them (spoiler alert: it involves an A+ bartender going out of his way to help a sweet little old lady who loves the horses). \n\nAfter attending a Mixology class with Linda (that's Linda W. of Yelp fame!) where we made Prohibtion-era cocktails, I was in love with this gin drink called a Bee's Knees. It involves the use of honey syrup, which is not a common bar ingredient. Bless Frank's heart, he figured out some concoction of simple syrup and honey, and made me a Bee's Knees!\n\nYou can also choose to eat while at Papa J's, if you can tear your eyes away from all the drink menus. I recommend the bruschetta (almost always get an order of this - it's sooooo oniony, and sprinkled with cheese and a hefty serving of diced tomatoes - so good!), and any of the pizzas. Last time we stopped in, we had the chicken pesto pizza which had PINE NUTS on it!  PINE NUTS! (Those things are edging out beets as my favorite 'why-hello-there-how-did-you-get-on-the-menu' food in Pittsburgh restaurants lately.) The crust is perfect. I don't think I'll ever even try anything else on the menu, since I can't get past these awesome pizzas.\n\nSo, Papa J's is the perfect place to go if you want great booze and good food at decent prices in a neat atmosphere. They're in a great location downtown, and I've never had trouble getting a seat at the bar. I still haven't found any ghost activity, but as long as Frank is serving drinks, I'll certainly keep looking!", "business_id": "SzHTdZR3yY1WBYUxkVxmUQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-07-15", "type": "review"}

You know how when you get a jokey waiter when you're not \"that kind\" of table, you expect the waiter to get the hint and be more professional? Well I had the exact opposite experience. My very small office was saying goodbye to one of our coworkers, so we went to Lidia's for a boozy lunch. We were in high spirits and having a great time. The waiter was perfectly courteous and professional, but I thought he should have gotten that we were a more personable table. Anyway, I didn't knock off a star for this, it doesn't seem important enough. But it did taint my visit. I remember the waiters attitude more then some of the food.\n\nOh, and don't bother with the tiramisu, it's all cream, almost no cake.\n\nBut the atmosphere is great, they really went all out with the interior design. The menu isn't particularly veg friendly, but it's not too bad. Lidia's does high-end traditional Italian without being too pretentious or too predictable. But I have no desire to eat what I ordered (the daily special pasta trio) again nor do I have any interest in trying anything else on the menu. Months later I decided to lower my stars from four to two. I really wanted to like this place, but I really didn't.\n\nAnd I gotta talk about that wine list again, it's Lidia's only shining star.

Well, I'll try to fill in the blanks.  This may be one of my new fav' brunch spots.  I'm not a fan of brunches as I detest most buffet style dining (has to do with my germophobia), sneeze guards...etc. Howeve, this is the type of brunch I can deal with.  First let's start with the space.  It's a beautiful restaurant that's been here for a few years.  Lidia of PBS fame has only three restaurants I believe (one in nyc, one in kc, and for some reason one in pgh).  As an aside I was told when I asked that one of the reasons lidia chose pittsburgh is because the ratings for her cooking show are better in this small metro than any other urban setting.  I dont' remembe all the details of the space except there were very high ceilings and ornate chandeliers (sp?).  We sat at the long bar and had a great professional bartender.  The bar offers a birds eye view into the open kitchen with many \"back of the house\" folks running about in organized confusion.  It's a bit busier today than usual Isuspect because the matriarch herself \"lidia\" is here barking orders and checking plates.  I'm told she only visits a few times a year and is here for the tomatoe dinner...Btw, Lidia in person looks very much like her profile on tv,,, she seems warm, genuine and very...how should I say...\"grandmotherlike\".  She comes out of the kitchen signs afew autographs and then has a seat by herself sipping an espresso watching the show go past...Okay, onto the food one of the main reason's I like this brunch is because the brunch entree's are cooked to order and offer some interesting options outside of your typical brunch fair.  It's relatively reasonable at $22 for everything including a \"well\" bloody mary.  The brunch starts with a delicious assortment of warm bread from the in house bakery served with three flavored butters.  I believe they are one with \"crunchy\" sugar, apricot and strawberry.  I like the crunchy one the best and quite frankly could have made a meal out of the bread and butter alone.  The buffet portion (if you will) has some fun options such as a great antipasta platter, all cheese and meats served at the perfect temperature with some house made pickles.  Also, there is a nice frittata (think italian omelette) along with a couple assorted salads and fruit.  You then have your choice of about a dozen main courses...everything from there famous pasta tasting trio for those who really want to \"carb up\" to beef tenderloin and chicken.  Annie orders this DELICIOUS duck pasta.  I don't think it's on the traditional brunch menu but it is soft pillows of al dente' pasta stuffed with a savory mix of duck and spices served in a small bowl with a dusting of cheese.  It was quite good.  I order the chicken livers, which are flavorful quick seared chicken livers, about medium rare served with polenta and fried onions.  I'm not a big polenta fan and the dish could have used some sauce, but overall it was a nice flavorful brunch.  You also get to peruse the dessert menu for the $22, but we skipped it.  We found the food quite good and the service outstanding.  Now, granted the boss was there so it was everyones \"A game\"...I don't care even without the best efforts I'm guessing this will become a somewhat regular stop for us.", "business_id": "XmdTkxKyJd7TuDLoiic1kg", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-08-21", "type": "review"}

Is PBS treating you well? Is your wallet getting fatter by the second? I hope so. \n\nI finally dropped by your restaurant in Pittsburgh's Strip District this evening. I know you've been begging me to check it out for years, but quite frankly, I just haven't been in the mood for pasta. You know how I am... carbs and all. \n\nYou know, I must give you props for the restaurant's layout. The fancy wall art, the color of the paint... I must say Rockwell did a very good job, and watching the sun set over the Allegheny River while dining on our meal was simply delightful. \n\nAt the behest of our server, each of my dining companions and I ordered the prix fixe pasta and a few antipasti. The antipasti were lovely - the lightly seasoned calamari was divine and the fresh mozzarella and olive platter was splendid. A terrific way to start the meal.\n\nNow Lidia, I know you'll never indulge me, but what on earth is in the dressing on your Caesar salad? It's smashing! There's definitely a hint of pear in it, but other than that, I'm flummoxed. Oh, and the imported cheese really bolstered the salad, sending a usually ho-hum affair into the stratosphere. You've really outdone yourself, my dear. \n\nAnd then came the prix fixe pasta trio. Lidia, darling, you know I'm a fan, but it really wasn't your best effort. The imported eggplant was overpowered by the tomato sauce, and the broccoli and sausage rabe was good but not great. Only the goat cheese-stuffed ravioli was better than average, but just marginally. Our server informed us that the ravioli was infused with thyme, but spank my bottom if I didn't taste a thing! Over all, not your best showing. \n\nDessert was quite sterling - the strawberry panna cotta was perfectly prepared, although a bit much with the cookies. Really, who has room for all that. I know you chide me constantly with your incessant \"mangia, Joe, mangia!\", but I had really eaten far too much and the champagne had gone to my head as well. \n\nSo there you have it: my visit to your restaurant in Pittsburgh. Not quite five stars, but certainly not 3 stars. I'll give you a four this time, if only for the blandness of the prix fixe. Do give my love to Joseph and don't be a stranger.

The salad was very good as were the breadsticks and bread with sea salt on the top.  \n\nAs for the main entrees that my girlfriend and I had...let's just say they left a little to be desired.  The pasta trio sounded good until I heard that almost everyone had mushrooms in it.  Lidia's is definitely that italian restaurant that is trying too hard to be cutting edge.  Why not go with some standard italian dishes?  Their menu doesn't include really any.  My girlfriend tried to play it safe with the lasagna bolognese and they should have just called that a mountain of over-salted meat.  There couldn't have been more than two sheets of pasta and two tablespoons of sauce in that dish.  There is nothing worse than dry lasagna and if my girlfriend wanted to eat just meat she would have ordered just meat.  Lasagna does in fact call for pasta.  \n\nI ordered the halibut with polenta.  I'll start with the polenta.  Basically I should have just eaten my napkin because that had more flavor than the polenta.  The dish came with San Marzano Tomatoes, Olives, and Capers over top of it and water passed off as sauce.  Nothing annoys me more than when someone tries to go crazy with a fish dish.  Let the fish do the talking.  There were so many onions and capers on it that I needed to really dig for the fish.  The halibut was good but it's a shame that the piece was incredibly small because the rest of the dish was subpar.\n\nThe desserts were very good however.  We went with the Tiramisu and \nSemifreddo di Cioccolato e Caramello (Milk Chocolate and carmel ice creams, chocolate cake, toasted meringue, crushed toffee).  \n\nThe decor was definitely cool inside too.

I looove to go here for lunch and get the pasta trio. For lunch, you get unlimited servings of three different pastas (one of which is imported from Italy) brought out fresh and served table-side from the skillet plus soup or salad for $14. Their Caesar salad is delicious and they offer some unique soups which are a refreshing change from the normal wedding soup or minestrone. It might be on the high side for lunch but it's well worth it!   Warning:  you may want to nap when you get back to your desk.  They also serve fresh breads with spreads. I prefer the green spread which is a bean base and contains who knows what else. The dinner pasta trio is a little more expensive ($18 for just the pasta or $29.50 w/salad, trio and dessert). \n\nI've had soooo many different pastas there, I couldn't begin to name them all. Some of my favorites include the pear ravioli, goat cheese ravioli, penne a la vodka, penne arrabiata, gnocchi in a Gorgonzola sauce and the list continues. They typically serve one pasta that contains meat and two meatless pastas but they'll make a third meatless pasta for all those vegetarians out there. I don't typically order off the menu but I've had the salmon and been pleased. \n\nI also recommend their brunch. It's $25 per person and includes a variety of anti pasta (probably a rotating sample of 10 or so that includes anything from soup, Caesar salad, various other salads, meat trays, bean based dishes, marinated vegetables, quiche, etc), fresh breads with an assortment of flavored butters (strawberry jam butter is my fav), one mimosa or bloody mary, the pasta trio or some other entree, coffee or tea, and a table full of various desserts for sampling.

The Strip was a ghost town on a Saturday night (during the Kenny Chesney concert). Upon opening the doors to Lidia's, the interior was bustling... with old people! While the decor seemed modern and edgy, the clientele was decked out in rinestone-encrusted tshirts and argyle. Yikes!\n\nWe kept changing our reservation number throughout the day, and by the time we arrived, our party was officially a party of four instead of six. I'm not unsympathetic to needing to do some table switching to accommodate us, but it appeared as if the hostess meant to solve the problem and then forgot about us once another problem arose. After a fairly long wait off to the side, one of our party went to the podium to ask about our table. Apparently, they had forgotten about us, but we were seated quickly after the mistake was realized. (Sidenote: the hostess' outfit was really unintentionally inappropriate. Part of her top was sheer, and would have been tastefully so if she didn't have her bra and underwear sticking out in awkward places, unbeknownst to her.)\n\nAnyway! I guess I can see how people think Lidia's is too much like an Olive Garden, but once you look at the ingredients and the preparation methods, it really isn't at all. I guess people see \"unlimited pasta\" and their minds go somewhere a little less sophisticated. Don't fall into this trap! Everything was expertly prepared with balanced flavors and appropriate portioning. \n\nI had the pasta trio (like everyone else, amirite!?) and indeed, the beginning portions of the pasta were small. The point is to sample, and then get more of what you prefer, even if it's all of them. I wouldn't want huge globs of pasta on my plate (getting cold, cheese and sauces congealing), so I appreciated this approach. Your followup portions come by with waiters carrying large metal pans of small-batch prepped pasta. All of the pasta tasted freshly made (not dried) and with exceptionally light and  balanced sauces. Perfect.\n\nI feel like you have to get the pasta trio at least once. The other entrees looked amazing as well. If I lived in the neighborhood, I would focus my ordering on the rotating seasonal entrees. \n\nMy Cesar salad was a little overdressed for my tastes, but still very flavorful and fresh. The bread basket was above-average, with at least three different warm options and two spreads (an olive and pesto spread). \n\nDessert was inventive, a lemon cake with a basil layer and poppyseed ice cream. The other elements escape me, but it was nice that my table mate gave me a bite. \n\nService was great, if a little slow towards the end. I enjoyed their wine selections, though one of the reds was much better alone (not with food), and probably  shouldn't have been on the menu. Though the wine list is quite extensive, there's a smaller, curated list of bottles for $28. It kept our choices (and bill) a little more manageable. So glad I got to try Lidia's!", "business_id": "XmdTkxKyJd7TuDLoiic1kg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-07-02", "type": "review"}

We arrived a bit early for our reservation and they were able to seat us right away.  Even with a fairly packed dining room, the place wasn't too loud.  If you have any old people in your group, they can seat you downstairs as I don't think they have an elevator (I prefer being upstairs overlooking looking the dining room, it's a nice touch).  The Lobster Arancini were cooked perfectly with no crunchy, undercooked risotto inside.  The only downside was that there were just 3 (we had 4 people) and they were tiny so it was almost impossible to split them.  As for entrees, the gnocchi topped with a duck ragu are a fantastic dish, not too rich and the gnocchi simply melt in your mouth.  The Zuppa di Pesce has a wonderfully balanced broth which wasn't oversalted (a surprise given the amount of shellfish) and tasted like it might have had Sherry wine in it.  I think I counted 7 or 8 different items in this seafood hodgepodge.  As for service, it was quite good and we were done with 3 courses in a bit over an hour.  Lidia's certainly ranks up there as one of my favorite Italian restaurants in the city.", "business_id": "XmdTkxKyJd7TuDLoiic1kg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-07-14", "type": "review"}

Just outside of downtown Pittsburgh (by Wholey's and The Heinz History Museum), this restaurant has soaring ceilings, a beautiful Chihuly-style glass chandelier, and friendly waitstaff. It's great for a date night, business lunch/dinner, or celebratory dinner (we've celebrated new jobs, birthdays, and anniversaries here over the years). It was started by famous chef Lidia Bastianich and features a wonderful selection of pastas, wines, and desserts. The meal always starts with a bread basket filled with crunchy cheese bread sticks (they taste like gourmet Cheez-Its), herbed foccacia, and Italian bread and the breads are served alongside two different \"butters\" (olive and pesto, I believe). There are some amazing dishes on the menu (my mom loves their gnocchi with duck ragu and the arugula salad and rarely gets anything else, while my dad and brother are more willing to try different things from the menu, like wild boar ravioli or caprese salad), but the best choice on the menu by far is Lidia's Pasta Tasting Trio. Offered either on its own or paired with a Caesar salad and choice of dessert, this meal consists of endless servings of three different, freshly made pastas. The pastas and their sauces change each day, but you can usually count on at least one butter-based sauce (usually butter and sage or butter and thyme) and one tomato-based sauce. The pastas are always different--last night, they had bucatini, papardelle, and ravioli--and they are always freshly made. The servers bring out steaming saute pans filled with the fresh pasta and you can eat as much pasta as you want (the servers will stop by every so often to offer another serving). This meal is a great way to try new types of pastas and new sauces and, with three types served each time, you're bound to like one. I've had spinach and ricotta ravioli, tagliatelle in a thyme-butter sauce, linguine in a creamy tomato sauce, bucatini in a spicy tomato sauce with caramelized onions and bacon...I've had too many pastas and sauces to count and I've always enjoyed this meal. I highly recommend getting it with the salad and dessert--the Caesar salad is lovely and they usually have some tasty desserts. They always offer delicious ice creams and sorbets (we've had lemon sorbet, olive oil ice cream, chocolate espresso ice cream, and strawberry sorbet, to name a few) and they usually have some sort of decadent chocolate dessert available. \nThe restaurant is definitely dressy, but there's always the one table with the idiots who came dressed in jeans and a tee shirt--please don't be one of those idiots (wear a cute dress or khakis and a polo). They offer valet parking, but there's a large, relatively inexpensive parking lot right across the street. Reservations help, but usually you can get in without one (unless it's a weekend evening). I recommend coming in with an empty stomach, because with all of that pasta, you'll need some room in there.", "business_id": "XmdTkxKyJd7TuDLoiic1kg", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-06-16", "type": "review"}

The changing station in the bathroom had wipes, a small sitting area and it was almost private. Fabulous. But the best part was they gave us a cradle-type thing in which our baby slept like the angel he is most certainly not. If he wasn't sleeping in it, he was just laying there playing and we could have brunch with our adult friends without having to entertain or keep an eye on our little love. Thanks Lidia's - you won me over with those two things alone.\n\nThe brunch itself was fantastic. The bread with three sweet, butter spreads was my favorite. My mimosa was actually a mimosa and not just orange juice with a splash of champagne. The buffet was 90%vegetarian and never looked empty because the staff was always bringing out new dishes.

I've been there for brunch in the past and had good meals, so I thought it'd be a nice place to take my Italian hubby. We both selected the prix fix menu with wine pairings. ($35 + $22). \n\nIt was apparent when we sat down that they were understaffed. The hostess began taking our drink order because our waitress was busy. When the waitress finally got to our table, we told her that we wanted to do the wine pairing and she offered us a few tasting options. They had a decent wine selection, and both her recommendations were delicious.\n\nWe both started our meals with caesar salads. The salads came out and the plates were a little sloppy in appearance. They were over-dressed and way too big for a starter salad, and the croutons were soggy as if they had been sitting in the dressing for a while. At this point, we hadn't seen our waitress in a long time; maybe 15 minutes had gone by and we were nearly done with our salads before the wines came.\n\nFor the main course, I selected the gnocchi and grilled sausage. The sausage was made in-house and was very flavorful. The gnocchi, however, was so burnt it was like eating dehydrated, crunchy noodles with a dense chewy inside. Very unappetizing and I was unable to continue eating.\n\nMy husband had the pasta trio, which is a table-side serving of three different pastas. The first was a spiral noodle in red tomato sauce, which was good. The pasta was cooked al dente and the sauce wasn't too sweet. The second pasta was gnocchi in a sage cream sauce, also good. The third pasta was supposed to be linguine in a mushroom sauce, but the noodles were extremely under-cooked, some of them still clumped together at one end, and there wasn't any sauce in the pan. Even the server commented on the lack of a sauce. It was inedible..\n\nAgain, our waitress was gone for a long time and one of the nearby servers noticed that we weren't eating our meals and we were actively searching for our waitress. He came over to our table and we explained the situation. He was really nice and immediately went to find the manager to get it fixed. In the meantime, our waitress did stop by and we explained again to her. She also went to find the manager. The manager came over to our table almost immediately. She was very kind and apologetic, indicating they were having a very bad day in the kitchen. She offered us new plates of food, but at this point we weren't very hungry and still hadn't eaten dessert. The manager offered to pay for our meals and dessert. I had a Nutella tart and my husband had tiramisu, both yummy, but too large to finish.\n\nBefore leaving, our waitress told us we should come back, especially after they had plans to remodel in the near future.

I finally decided tonight that I had to try it for myself.\n\nWhile the food is above average, the ambiance does leave a little to be desired. The evening started out with a bread basket, which was (oddly) comprised of three somewhat bland pieces of white bread and about 20 little squares of butter. Very strange. Even in my most gluttonous days, I find it impossible to average 6+ squares of butter per slice of bread, but maybe that's just me.\n\nMy dish, the linguini with house-made cream sauce and mushrooms, came with a soup or salad, of which I chose the broccoli and cheddar soup. As a vegetarian, I was pleased to see plenty of options on the menu for me to choose from. The broccoli and cheddar soup was rich and creamy, albeit a bit salty for my taste. The linguini however, was great. I could immediately tell the sauce was homemade - it had a certain fresh and rich flavor that pre-packaged sauce tends to lack. (Unfortunately, I'm sure the amount of calories I consumed in that dish reflected the amazingly rich flavor, but I'll just ignore that.) As pleased as I was with my own menu luck, I found my boyfriend's dish - the gnocchi with pomodoro sauce - to be a tad bit lackluster. The pomodoro sauce and the gnocchi itself were forgettable. While I loved my own dish, the lack of consistency throughout the menu makes ordering a bit difficult.\n\nOverall, this is a pretty good neighborhood Italian restaurant that is priced rather decently.

Yes, this place looks like it hasn't been updated for many decades. However, I find that kind of charming -- I imagine all of the steel workers of yore, boots dirty and hands ragged, gathering at the local watering hole after a long day's work to unwind with their neighbors and enjoy a cold pint and some good food.\n\nAnyway, I digress. I've been to the Pleasure Bar several times, and I have always left relatively satisfied. I've never encountered any service issues, and the food has always been decent. Now don't get me wrong -- the food isn't super modern, light, amazing Italian cuisine. It is, however, good \"Pittsburgh Italian\" --  and by that I mean that many of their dishes are heavier, richer, and more dense. Yes, I just made up the term \"Pittsburgh Italian\", but for a city that puts french fries on its salads, I think it fits. For example, one of their more popular and delicious appetizers is their potato balls -- as the name suggests, these are deep fried balls of mashed potatoes. Delightfully crispy on the outside, and warm, smooth and creamy on the inside. Their gnocchi is delicious, but very dense -- it's not the light, pillow-y type of gnocchi that some other Italian restaurants serve. That being said, I have no problem with starchy, dense gnocchi. I often get it tossed with mafalda sauce, which is one of their signature sauces that is a combination of marinara and alfredo. Sinful!!  So yeah, their food is the type of food that is rich and delicious, but you're definitely not going to be running a 5k after eating it (then again, running a 5k is overrated anyway ;) ) \n\nSo for what it is, I think Pleasure Bar's food is actually pretty good. However, the last three times that I've visited, I've had -- hmm, how to say this politely? -- \"intestinal issues.\"  The first time it happened, I thought maybe it was a fluke, but then I went again a few weeks later, and once again it was a gastrointestinal race to the finish home. I gave it one final try, but met the same fate.  So there is clearly something about their food that doesn't agree with me (and for the record, this doesn't ever happen anywhere else). To be fair though, it's very possible that my body is just weird, because in all cases my dining partners have not gotten ill.\n\nSo I'm kind of torn -- my brain wants to give Pleasure Bar 4 stars, maybe 4.5, because I really do like their food. But my GI tract wants to give them a 1 or a 2. So I'll split the difference and go with 3.", "business_id": "-Nanlb7SYXObqQ6dZ49UOg", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-07-21", "type": "review"}

It was very crowded due to Little Italy Days in Bloomfield. I didn't mind waiting 45 minutes for a table as it was busy, but they seemed really understaffed which was strange since it was Little Italy Days.\n\nOnce we were seated, we waited 15 minutes for our waitress Misty to greet us and take our drink orders. She complained about how busy they were and how this was the second double in a row she was working. She told us she was thinking of getting wasted that night and coming in the next day hungover... I can not stand when waitresses/waiters see that we're younger (I'm 25, my friends are in their early 30s) and assume that they can drop all professionalism and talk to us like we're their friends. I sympathize with you being slammed but I don't want to hear you complaining nor do I want to hear about you getting wasted. We should have requested another waitress at that moment.\n\nTwo other tables who were seated 10-15 minutes after us got their food about 20 minutes before us. Two other waitresses were working the room and seemed fast and competent. We were the only table with Misty, who was working both the bar area and us. She never checked on us, took forever to get our food to us (which I'm assuming was sitting back in the kitchen for quite some time) and after we finished, we sat there for 20 minutes before we finally flagged down the hostess for our check. From the time we walked in to the time we walked out was a little over 2 hours. Would never consider going back.\n\nThe food was good.", "business_id": "-Nanlb7SYXObqQ6dZ49UOg", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-08-31", "type": "review"}

But come on people, who can actually write a review of an ITALIAN restaurant when they've only eaten the tuna or a hoagie? PASTA is in their name, so you should probably try the PASTA before commenting on something that isn't their SPECIALTY. Sorry for the sarcasm.\nI've been going to Alexander's for years, and I can't remember ever getting a bad meal. I love that you can pick what kind of pasta you want, what sauce, and the toppings. My favorite is the marfredo sauce. It is spaghetti sauce mixed with alfredo sauce. So freakin good!!! \nMy only \"issue\" is that they never seem to add enough sauce on your pasta, but you can ask for some extra on the side and they bring you a little bowlful. It's perfect!!!\nI get hot sausage on top (which isn't too spicy) and broccoli (which is always steamed just right, so it's not limp). \nThe bread always comes with olive oil and parmesean cheese that you can dip it in. I love that.  \nWe always get a carafe of their Chianti. It seems to go really well with the pasta. \nAnd lastly, the price is right. Why pay $20 for a plate of pasta? Alexander's agrees. With wine and 2 dinners, we get outta there for under $50. Not bad.\nThis is an all-around good italian restaurant.

I went there with my girlfriend and my parents on a Saturday night, and from start to finish the experience that Alexander's gave us was simply awful. First, when we arrived around 6 pm, the restaurant was half-empty (bad sign #1). The hostess seated us at a table in the center of the very cramped and very small dining room (bad sign #2). Then, our waitress did not even come over to take drink orders for another 10 minutes (bad sign #3).\n\nOnce the waitress finally arrived and took our orders, the food itself offered no relief. My girlfriend and I ordered the Caesar salad - the salads were drowning in Caesar dressing, the croutons were badly burnt and inedible, and there were too many croutons to begin with. This restaurant couldn't even get a simple salad right, but I hoped against hope that the entrees would be an improvement.\n\nUnfortunately, the entrees were no better. My girlfriend ordered Chicken Alfredo. Not only was the dish absurdly light on chicken (3 small pieces total? Come on!), the alfredo sauce was thick and gummy to the point of tasting like glue. My mom ordered the Mushroom ravioli, which was completely bland. I ordered the Veal Diablo with Shrimp; the plate came with 3 pieces of veal sliced extremely thin, 3 nice sized shrimp, and... that was it. No pasta, no garlic bread, nothing but an ocean of very mediocre marinara sauce. I finished my entire plate, the remaining half of my mom's plate after she was finished eating, and as much as I could stomach of my girlfriend's Alfredo (which was only a couple of forkfuls, as that Alfredo sauce was one of the foulest things I've ever eaten), but I still was left hungry.\n\nThe dessert course offered a distinctly rotten cherry on top of this already heaping garbage sundae. We were initially assured that all of the desserts were made in-house, but that soon proved not to be the case. Indeed, for several of our desserts, a store-bought version would have been an improvement. I ordered a cannoli, figuring that even a crappy Italian restaurant can't screw up a cannoli, as it is a violation of Italian Law or something. Unfortunately, their \"fresh-made\" cannolis consisted of a pre-packaged cannoli shell, pre-packaged cannoli filling (which, by the way, was gritty, as though someone had dumped in white sugar but not mixed the cream thoroughly enough for the sugar to dissolve), and put the two together in the kitchen. Needless to say, my cannoli was awful. My girlfriend ordered the tiramisu, and what she received was about as far removed from tiramisu as one can get. There were almost no ladyfingers, and the ones that were in the dish were drowning in coffee. On top of that, the dessert was swamped with an excessive amount of coffee-flavored cream that essentially destroyed the dish. My uncle's chocolate cake was dry and uninspiring; a store-bought cake would have been more moist.\n\nI did not pick up the check - my uncle was nice enough to do that - so I did not see the final bill. However, they could not have paid me to eat this often-inedible food. The service was slow and inattentive, the food was simply awful, and I left hungry. Do not waste your time, your money, or your energy with this place, as you can get better Italian food virtually anywhere else in the city.", "business_id": "5MChfa-jZfMo3vBpolkSbw", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-07-11", "type": "review"}

My date and I were told there was a 30-40 minute wait and after almost leaving, we made our way through the restaurant to wait in the wine bar.  Hmm a bit misleading.  It was quite humid and crowded.  I am patient and was in great company but...there were some negative moments.  On our way up the wine bar stairs,  I held the door as a hostess directed a party down the teeny stairs to their table, only to be squished by patrons coming up who thought I was there for their convenience and more than happy to hold the door as they pushed past.  Also some of  the patrons at the bar seemed displeased that new faces were coming in and did not seem to want to budge to make any room for ordering beverages.  Anyway, I do not drink so I had literally stand still (think sardines) until some people were seated elsewhere.  I was then able to find comfy chairs to sit in.  There were some appetizers sweating and/or floating in olive oil on the windowsill which I found a little gross.  A not-so-polite employee cleaned up the space and extra drink glasses around me.  Giving me a dissatified \"thanks a lot\" look that made me want to justify myself as not being the slob that left the glasses and plates!  But my date returned and relaxed with a glass of wine as we chatted.  We were seated surprisingly promptly.  We were lead to a small two top near the door.  While not ideal, it was do-able.  I had a salad and the pizza with te arugula while my date hads the fpur cheese.  I loved my pizza and besides one of the cheeses my date also enjoyed his pie.  The pizza crust was slightly sweet and baked just right. (Like I said, I really enjoyed mine and the food is why I gave 3 not 2 stars.)  Thankfully my date was able to help me finish my pizza and there was some to take home.  Our waiter was nice and somewhat attentive.  I did have to hunt him down for red pepper flakes, a refill on water and our small table became quite crowed and yet he did not remove the bread basket/plates.  I grew up in Mt. Lebanon and know that sometimes the neighborhood can be a bit \"snooty-pooty\" but I would go back.

Discussing amongst ourselves while scouring other tables for evidence of portion size we eventually settled on one appetizer, two pastas, and a pizza...we then began the agonizing process of deciding which option sounded best.  \n\nBaked in house the first basket was had only three options while the second arrived with a fourth.  With each bread a great example of its particular type the baskets featured a smoky Rustic Italian, buttery Semolina Vienna, amply sour sesame seed crusted Sourdough, and a buttery moist Foccacia.  While I rather wish the pairing would have been a nice olive oil as opposed to butter neither were really necessary with all the sauce that required mopping up.\n\nBeginning the meal as the sounds of eager diners bounced around the wonderfully decorated brick and tile interior was a delightful Arancini with creamy arborio rice providing a slightly toothsome contrast to velvety fried Mozzarella.   An ample portion for a mere $6 the dish was only enhanced by resting the crispy balls of cheese in a pool of house-made marinara.  Remember the comment about the bread - a whole basket was used to dredge the plate clean of the aromatic and slightly acidic sauce.\n\nSelecting two of the eighteen pastas the pair was delivered simultaneously and looking back I still cannot decide which was better.  Beginning first with the Paglia E Fieno, a spinach and egg tagliatelle with peas, prosciutto di parma, parmigiano-reggiano, and cream I was stunned by the bouncy texture of the pasta to tooth yet its undeniable melt-in-the-mouth texture upon mastication...al dente done just right.  Complimenting the pasta were sweet and snappy peas, a smooth and salty prosciutto, and a pungent parmigiano-reggiano that added texture and pungency.  All balanced by a somewhat sweet cream sauce the entire dish was well thought out, well balanced, and divine.\n\nNot to be outdone, Gnocchi Di Ricotta featuring Ricotta Gnocchi, Butter, Sage, and Parmigiana-Reggiano was a dish that would have the three of us fighting for the last dumpling.  Simply prepared, as one expects from a rustic dish like gnocchi, the dumplings were undoubtedly the star of the dish-literally melting puddles of potato and ricotta cheese that provided little resistance to tooth, yet enough body to support and absorb the subtly sweet and aromatic sauce.  Topped with a quick grating of cheese and cracked black pepper the gnocchi was one of the best I've ever tasted-a skilled hand, perfect cooking conditions, and largely un-fussed-with.\n\nEnjoying all the previous efforts so much the \"star\" of the afternoon was nearly an afterthought-and one heck of an afterthought given that it is where the restaurant made its name.  Opting for the Provola with Smoked Mozzarella di bufala, Cherry Tomatoes, Fresh Basil, Parmigiano-Reggiano, Baby Arugula, and Extra Virgin Olive Oil we watched as the dough emerged from the temperature controlled room, was rolled by hand, topped and was placed inside the stone oven for a mere 90 seconds.  Emerging bubbly and charred the pizza was topped with a heap of fresh arugala, drizzled with olive oil and a quick shredding of Parmigiano-Reggiano before being plated and brought to the table.  Squeaky and smoky the cheese was a perfect foil for the cornmeal accented and yeasty dough.  Crisp and toasted around the circumference of the 13 inche pie and sopping wet at the center each ingredient was pronounced in flavor with the super sweet tomatoes and basil forming the foundation and the bite of the parmigiano and bitterness of the Arugula providing a nice compliment of flavor.\n\nArriving quickly and in ample portion the house made desserts were both presented simply and unadorned.  Beginning first with the Tiramisu-a rather standard example with buttery lady fingers, smooth mascarpone, high quality cocoa, ribbons of chocolate, and a hefty shot of rum-it was good, but like many pre-prepared versions it was largely unbalanced with the rum soaking the bottom layer and cream dominating the top.  Significantly more impressive was the Cannoli, a crisp and slightly cinnamon accented shell housing a lightly lemon tinged ricotta cream.  One end dipped in crushed pistachio, the other in chocolate chips, and sitting atop a bed of hand whipped cream-light, refreshing, and authentic.\n\nGreat service, everything expertly prepared, and prices that fit the quality of the ingredients I was very happy with every aspect of our meal.  Honestly, when the pizza, one of the best I've ever had was the \"worst\" savory...that is saying something.

I was so happy we chose to eat dinner there, especially when we got a great, people-watching table right next to the window. Very relaxing before our 5-hour drive home the next day.\n\nIl Pizzaiolo has a great, rustic atmosphere. Dark wood, tan walls, delicious pizza smells. And a full bar. Very important.\n\nThe service was eh. It took the waitress at least 10 minutes to greet us and take our drink order, another 5 to get drinks and tepid water for the table. (Ew, chill the water. I know you're going for a Euro atmosphere but you're not in Europe. Chill the damn water.) The appetizer got there after another 5 and then the pizza took forever. I don't know how since the menu claims they're cooked in 30 seconds in the wood burning oven. But no matter. On to the review.\n\nT got a beer and I got a mimosa. They were out of the peach juice that usually goes in a mimosa so it was made with blood orange juice instead. Delicious. \n\nFor our appetizer we ordered a sort of potato stick with cheese mixed in. Forget the exact name and they don't seem to have a website where I can check. They were ... okay. A bit bland truth be told but the Parmesan cheese sprinkled on top helped a bit. There was no salt and pepper on the table and our waitress was a bit absent so we sucked it up and ate the bland potato stick things.\n\nHowever, the pizza improved a somewhat mediocre appetizer. We got the Diavolo with spicy salami and chili flakes. Amazing. The crust was thin and chewy and not too black on the bottom. The cheese was salty and creamy and the salami was spicy and really tasty. Much better than pepperoni in my opinion.\n\nI suppose it's a good spot if you're in the mood for Italian.

My mother and aunt live in Mt. Lebanon and my husband and I visit a couple times a year, and on a night we had to ourselves decided to have a late dinner here.As it was a Saturday, the place was packed and had a couple groups waiting. Because we were only needing a table for 2 we were able to get seated promptly. \nThis was one of the evenings when the daytime temperature was over 100 degrees and was still very hot after sundown; the restaurant was boiling hot. They have a wood burning pizza oven so I am sure that they cannot keep the place as cool as some eateries (most are too cold for me). Service was very fast and very attentive, and very nice. We had cold water on our table in under 30 seconds of seating, were given just the right amount of time to look at the menu, and received our appetizer within 10 minutes of seating. Our food arrived about 20 minutes after ordering, with enough time to not be rushed through our appetizer. \nI cannot remember what our appetizer's name was, but it was a dough pocket filled with mozzarella and had yellow and red tomatoes to the side. It was well done, but I felt like it was simply too huge a portion to really be an appetizer/salad. Giant mound of mozzarella + only 4 thin slices of tomatoes seemed off somehow; still tasted great though.\nMy husband had Linguini alle Vongole- clams in a white sauce. He absolutely loved the meal, and the dish arrived with more clams than I would ever have expected. \nI ordered Chicken Piccata, as I was wanting something lighter than pasta or anything packed with cheese. The lemon was so refreshing and the sauce done very nicely- not too buttery, with more of the lemon and wine coming through- definitely nice after such a seething hot day.\nThe quality of the food shines through, even from the menu. I appreciate a place that used San Marzano tomatoes, real buffalo mozzarella, huge sprigs of basil, , etc. The prices were a little steep but I didn't leave the place lamenting over the cost.\nThe last comment I will leave is that the place is ungodly loud when full. Now, I am not a local, and I have always noticed that in general Pittsburgh restaurants are much louder than what I am used to (San Fransisco CA, Louisville KY, Washington DC, Baltimore MD and Philly). I usually chalk it up to a Pittsburgh thing, but this place was wayyyy louder for whatever reason. There was one group of maybe 10 (noise wasn't so much from them anyway) people but otherwise all small groups. I say this merely b/c a couple people have said it's a great date spot. I would agree, but NOT FOR A FIRST or any getting-to-know-you dates- you won't hear half of what your date said and who wants to have to scream so everyone around you knows it's a first date? :) \nOverall, a great restaurant and I cannot wait to come back try their DOC pizza- it looked superb.", "business_id": "6-rJjW6ITl5o_FliiNgZRA", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-07-08", "type": "review"}

Don't get me wrong, the food has always been good, but not fantastic and a little over priced. Yes, I've had the pizza. Yes, I've had several pasta dishes. None of which has changed my mind. I don't understand why there is always such a long wait for a table here. \nMy latest trip was on a warm Saturday night. I met a few friends on the patio for dinner. I arrived a llittle late and with baby in tow. I specifically asked for them to order me a glass of wine so it was on the table when I arrived. Unfortunately, for my dining companion, I miscalculated the size of baby + diaper bag and knocked over the glass of wine spilling it all over his yellow shirt. It almost looked like a tie dyed effect. The wait staff rushed to our side bringing him a glass of seltzer water and me a new glass of wine (I later found out at no charge). Seltzer water had nothing on the masterpeice I created. The shirt was officially retired. Once we got settled, I ordered the insalata misticanza. Despite the fancy name, it's a rather typical salad with balsamic, greens and some typical veggies. Nothing extravagant here, especially for 11$. For my entree, I had the fusilli ala ragu di bracioli. The pasta was cooked well. The beef was a little dry. The sauce was ok. I decided to not take home my left overs. Overall, my bill ended up being 40$. For a salad, pasta dish and 1 glass of wine. This same meal would average at least 5 dollars less at an equivalent restaurant. The best thing about the meal was the service. The server was knowledgeable, attentive and friendly.

There were several items that were really good, but yet there were a few areas that left a bad feeling in my mouth.\n\nThe arancini - the Sicilian and Neapolitan Fried Rice Balls - were top notch and I would get over and over.  There were four little fried balls of risotto that were so good.  We also had the insalata misticanza - which they graciously split in half for us.  It was your typical salad.\n\nWe then had the cavatelli con rapini - with sausage and rapini - as well as the bucatini all'amatriciana - with Guanciale and onions.  Both dishes had unique flavors.  However, the cavatelli came out luke warm and I had to send it back to be warmed.  It also had too much sausage - it more than dominated the pasta.\n\nSo - that's the food review.  As for the staff - it left a little to be desired.  First off - we had a reservation and I had requested an outside seating on the phone.  In essence, they told me they don't take reservations for the outside - it's first come first serve when you get there.  So - when we got to the restaurant I asked and they told me that it would be a good 30 minute wait.  So we sat inside.  Then after we ordered our drinks, I went to look at the patio b/c I had heard it was very nice...and there were several open tables.  I didn't understand where our 30 minute wait was.  Then when I get back to my table, I see the waitress seating a couple outside...who came in after us.  If it's first come first serve for the patio - how come it was a 30 minute wait for us, but not for the other couple?  I just felt that they might have catered to people who were their 'regulars'.

I too once loved this restaurant, but we have had far too many terrible experiences to ever return.\n\nOur first bad experience was a year and a half ago.  My parents were visiting from out of town and my husband and I decided to take them here.  We were told the wait would be 30-45 minutes.  We were lucky enough to find two seats at the wine bar so we could share a bottle of vino and take turns sitting.  An hour went by... then an hour and fifteen minutes... We began to notice that some parties coming into the bar area after us were seated before us.  Then, we were finally told our table was ready and to follow them... only for one of the hostesses to stop the waitress who was seating us.  She told the waitress that the table was for someone else.  We then watched as they sat a party who had been waiting for less than 20 minutes.  I can only presume these people were friends with one of the hostesses.  At this point, over 90 minutes had passed and we were understandably upset.  I complained to the manager, a middle aged woman who showed absolutely no concern for the situation they had caused.  We should have left, but instead we ordered another bottle and waited another 20 minutes for our table in the extremely noisy front dining room.\n\nMy husband absolutely refused to go to this location after that incident, so our next incident was not until this past week.  We made reservations for a Friday night and I specifically requested a quiet table in the wine room if one was available.  I noted that we would be willing to switch our reservation to a half hour before or after if that gave us a better chance, knowing they can't completely control such things.  When we arrived, the hostesses appeared to be the same teenage or 20-something girls who worked here a year ago.  I don't know if they were or if this restaurant simply has a steady stream of insolent young girls from which to draw.  The girls looked at each other, continued to giggle and continue whatever conversations they had already been having, and eventually pulled out a couple menus for us.  They led us to a table for 8 which already had 4 people.  They then gestured towards the table and asked \"is this okay?\".  We responded that no, we had made a reservation and there were at least two open tables in the front dining room, so we expected to be sat there, outside or at the wine bar (we checked - there was a table open in the same room as the wine bar and one outside).  The girl then informed us that it would be another 20-30 minutes if we didn't want to sit at someone else's table.  I have never known Il Pizzaiolo to be communal seating so this was completely unacceptable.  We left and gave our business to another restaurant on the same street, where we had excellent food and excellent service.\n \nThis portion is regarding the other location downtown:\n\nOur third bad experience was the Market Square location this past Sunday.  We have had one less than favorable experience there before (they told my husband and I it would be a 2 hour wait for a table for 8, then told someone else from our party it would be 15 minutes only 10 minutes later... ), but we were willing to justify it and hoped it was an anomaly.  Sadly, they now seem to hire from the same pool as the Mt. Lebanon location.  We were told it would be a 20-25 minute wait for an outdoor table as 3 different 4 tops were finishing their dinner.  They said they would call us so we took a walk and returned 15 minutes later.  We waited at a public table in Market Square and WATCHED as the host and hostess cleared and then sat the 2 of the 4 tops.  When we went in to ask what was going on, we saw that all three 4 tops were actually resat.  We reminded them we were waiting and asked them when they would have our table ready.  We were told it would be another 20 minutes.  Goodbye!  Ciao, Il Pizzaiolo!  Never again.  We were able to be seated at Sienna immediately.  \n\nOwnership should be ashamed.  I don't know whether it is nepotism in the host positions or a complete lack of respect for their clientele.  I should add that on every occasion, a remark was made to at least a hostess, if not management, and no one offered even a sincere apology.  It is sad that people are willing to put up with this level of service.  There are plenty of other fine establishments in Pittsburgh, particularly Italian ones.  I have a whole list of Italian restaurants that have as good or better food, that would never treat their patrons like this.", "business_id": "6-rJjW6ITl5o_FliiNgZRA", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-08-15", "type": "review"}

After the salad, I was served polenta with mozzarella, escarole, and cannellini beans: a peasant dish that balances a light red sauce with bitter-ish escarole, and with rich cannellini and mozzarella. I notice that Girasole gets mixed reviews here on Yelp for quality and portion-size, but each visit I've ordered the polenta and found it well-executed and too much for one meal (I take home the sauce and later serve it over pasta).\n\nWhen I departed, I said to the host with a smile, \"Thank you.

Personally, I can't imagine enjoying what might be a nice meal when folks are treated like we were. GET ORGANIZED WITH A SYSTEM OR LIST, COMMUNICATE WITH THOSE WHO ARE WAITING PATIENTLY, DON'T CRAP ON NON-LOCALS, AND DON'T MAKE FOLKS WAIT THAT LONG WHO HAVE A RESERVATION (and if we have to wait, talk to us and share the situation and DON'T seat locals in front of us who arrived much later). Sort through and read the many other reviews and you will see a similar trend in the owner's pathetic seating protocol (or lack thereof).", "business_id": "xgK6AAhJ-cYBUCSaLzgTuw", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-07-23", "type": "review"}

However, Calabria's is vey good for what it is- casual italian foods. I would say it's closer to Armstrong's or Little Oasis. I stopped here for dinner with a friend at 8pm on a Saturday night. We asked to sit outside but were informed that the patio was \"rented\" out for the night for a party. When I walked into the dining room, I was immediately frightened and seriously considered going elsewhere. It looked like they clean with pepto bismal. Everything is a very ugly pink color. Tables, booths, chairs, decorations- pepto bismal pink. We were also the youngest patrons by about 20 years. Stomaches growling, we decided to stay and were very glad we did.\nI ordered the grilled chicken with a side of pasta with vodka sauce. The entrees also came with a salad or soup. I chose the salad with cheesy garlic dressing. Yes, the dressing is called cheesy garlic. It was a creamy, cheesy italian dressing. Delicious. I can definitely see using this dressing as a sauce for subs and chicken. The salads were also served with italian bread with a oil, balsamic and spices dip. Perfect compliment to my meal. Our entrees arrived quickly. I was very pleased with my choice. The chicken was juicy and tender with good flavors. The penne with vodka sauce was delicious. A wonderful combination of tomatoes and cream. When I asked for parmesan cheese, I was directed to the bottle of shaker cheese on the table. Not quite what I was looking for. Our waitress quickly brought me a small cup of grated cheese. Throughout the night the service was exceptional. Now, that might have to do with the fact that there were only 2 other tables at that time but regardless, it was great. I decided to save a piece of chicken for lunch the next day and get dessert. We were looking for chocolate cake but the closest thing we found was a chocolate brownie ala mode. Other than the decor, dessert was the reason Calabria's got 4 stars instead of 5. The brownie was on the hard and thin side. Overall, I would definitely head back to Calabria's for dinner but will pass on dessert.", "business_id": "Ln34kwDUNZPLhVhUqauLWQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-07-02", "type": "review"}

Despite being far from authentic, I typically enjoy their food about once or twice a year.  This time we had a gift card, so that was incentive enough to go.  They currently have a 2 for $25 which is okay, but the portions are a lot smaller than their regular entrees.  Yes, you get unlimited salad and breadsticks, but it's just iceberg salad.  The deal also comes with either a small app or a dessert to share.  It was enough for the price, but they should mention the portions are reduced.  Contrary to LR's review, I have ALWAYS taken leftovers home from OG.  I easily ate the whole entree after eating salad and breadsticks.  Unless they just reduced their portion size since the last time I went, these were definitely skimpy and did not come with that much chicken either.  The smoked chicken was decent.\n\nOur friend got the unlimited soup, salad and breadsticks for dinner (yes they offer it for dinner for $3 more) but our less than friendly waitress snagged 2 of her breadsticks off of the table before she was finished. Why would you snag breadsticks from right in front of someone in the first place, let alone someone who has them as part of their meal. The spicy sausage soup she first ordered was mostly broth.  \n\nAll in all, it's not that good and there are better places you could go and not have to wait 45 minutes for a table.  Try a real, local Italian place, like Libretto's up the road or Portofino's on Park Rd.

Delicious food (the gnocchi was amazing), excellent wait staff, wonderful atmosphere.  If I was a \"playa\", I'd take my date here for the sure win in the restaurant category.\n\nWe were in town for the Charlotte Heroes Comic Con and stopped here for dinner.   When we walked in, I immediately felt under dressed.  Even though every other customer was in fully casual attire (more likely due to the nearby comic event), the restaurant immediately strikes you as an upscale, formal attire venue.  The decorating is simple, yet beautiful, with large white columns, soft romantic lighting and a big brass chandelier over the main dining area.   \n\nEvery single course was interesting, beautiful and delicious.  A bread basket with a variety of bread was brought with a small bowl of oil and cannelloni beans.  The bread as a bit on the hard side on the outside, but still very tasty and just filling enough to curb your appetite.  We ordered the calamari for an appetizer, which comes with fried calamari, topped with shredded and fried zucchini, with two different sauces for dipping.  We were both surprised by the shredded zucchini, but it was delicious and an excellent addition the crispy yet soft calamari.\n\nFor entrees I ordered the gnocchi, and my gf ordered the pesto.  They were both delicious.  The pesto had lots of flavor, with the pasta being soft and tender.  It was great.  Here's the thing though.  The gnocchi was so good, it almost ruined the pesto.   I've had a lot of Italian food, and tried gnocchi a few times.  Each time I've tried gnocchi, it's been prepared al-dente which imo has made it too much on the chewy side.  This gnocchi was soft.  Not mushy, but soft and the texture combined with the large chunks of fresh mozzarella  was wonderful.  The tomato based sauce it was in, was easily some of the best I'd ever had.  The flavor wasn't complex.  It was just the best of the flavors in tomato sauce, amplified.   It was not only the best gnocchi we'd ever had, it was one of the best Italian-style dishes I'd ever eaten.\n\nFor dessert we ordered the Semi-freddo.  It's a small sweet bit of ice cream with some sort of yummy nougat inside, with a few assorted fresh berries on the side.  It was tasty, and the flavors of the ice-cream and fresh berries mixed perfectly.\n\nThe restaurant isn't very large, but that only adds to charm and intimacy of the atmosphere.  The hostess was professional, and personable and sat us at a table out of the way.  Our waiter was polite and friendly (but not too friendly.  You know what I mean.).  It's important to note, that the entire wait staff was sharp, clean and well dressed.  None of that half-assed, \"I'm abiding by the dress code, but I really just rolled out of bed\" look.  I'm ok with that most times, but the wait staff of the night obviously put some effort into looking crisp, and it added to the high class feel of the place.  \n\nIn addition to looking and behaving posh and professional, the wait staff also managed to always be near enough to get you something if you needed it, but rarely so intrusive that they were a bother.  The small size of the restaurant and the number of staff hit the perfect balance of availability and perceived absence.  We never felt annoyed at their presence or lack thereof.\n\nAs for the price, well,  \"If you ain't got no 'monay, take yo broke ass home.\"  (or to another, more fiscally friendly venue, whichever)", "business_id": "z24h6ZYnZiWjlDTuLXG9jw", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-06-06", "type": "review"}

I started with the panzanella salad there wasn't much taste in the dish it was under seasoned just plain.

The dish that not only looked really disappointing but as I was told by my guests I brought along with me it was tasteless too.  I'm not going to lie their chicken dishes looked like a lean cuisine you know those teeny tiny chicken breasts that come in lean cuisine meals well folks that is exactly what they got.

Luce is a small restaurant that sits at the foot of the Hearst tower.  If you are not paying attention, it is possible that you might miss it; even if you are looking for it.  I have worked uptown for a while now and did not know it was even there until someone took me there.  In fact, when we were walking to Luce's I thought that maybe the people I was dining with meant Lavecchia's.\n\nRegardless, once I got there, I was impressed with the atmosphere.  It was small and well appointed.  I think this would be a good place for future business lunches or dinner.  A date might be nice here as well.  The dining room is dimly lit but not too dark and I swear all of the waiters are fresh imports from Italy. All are very attentive and have a strong Italian accent.\n\nWhile you wait for your meal, you are presented with fresh bread and olive oil with beans and some sort of spice, a  bruschetta of sorts, to munch on.  For lunch I had a pasta dish made of spinach pasta and a heavy cream sauce - an alfreto of sorts with prosciutto.  The flavors were amazing.  The dish had a certain richness to it but was very light.  Although I have not been to Italy before, I would suspect this to be very authentic.\n\nI was impressed by my experience at Luce's and look forward to returning again soon.", "business_id": "z24h6ZYnZiWjlDTuLXG9jw", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-07-23", "type": "review"}

Their 3 course meal menu had a wide variety for the occasion. Upon walking in, it wasn't what I thought it would be. It was smaller than what I imagined, but that was expected after looking at where it was located. Under the Hearst Tower.\n\nNow, I imagine this place to be a local place to go to for office workers after a day at work and want to go to drink at a bar. For me, I think the only reason why I'm here is because its during restaurant week (and I thought the menu looked tasty, and I felt like eating italian.) On another note, the seats weren't extremely comfortable, but it was doable.\n\nFor appetizer, I ordered the fried calamari. It also had fried vegetables, except it was in a string form. My mother ordered the grilled octopus with capers sprinkled on top which I thought it was well cooked and tasty. My brother ordered a salad as an appetizer as well.\n\nFor the entree, I ordered the stuffed pork chop. I felt that even though there was sauce, it still tasted a little dry in my mouth. So to counteract I had to vigorously add sauce to my pork chop. Half way in was when I noticed stuffing because I tasted mushrooms and I was wondering where the hell is this from?! I thought it was a nice surprise. \n\nMy mother ordered the fish of the day which I thought was tasty. What made it was the lemon taste with the fish because of the olives as well as lemons themselves. \n\nMy father ordered off the restaurant week menu and got the Red Snapper. I thought it was very tasty. My brother thought it was very tender, mixed with the tomatoes it went well at the same time it kept with the Italian flavor. I and also my family enjoyed the hint of garlic on the fish.\n\nMy brother ordered the \"Osso Bucco\" which is veal. I thought it was delicious. The flavors of the veal as well as the sauce mixed really well. However, the risotto that came with it was mixed with cheese and we agreed that it wasn't cooked all the way through.\n\nLastly for dessert, I had the tiramisu and my mother had the vanilla custard. I felt as mine was tasty, but if I had to choose the dessert I think I would have gone with the custard. \n\nOverall, Luce did a wonderful job and it's a wonderful placed to eat for those special occasions.

The one saving grace was the pieces of pancetta scattered throughout the dish.  The third dish helped bring us back closer to our starting point.  The veal milanese was very simple with a veal cutlet pounded out, lightly breaded and fried, topped with arugula, cherry tomatoes and Parmesan cheese.  The cutlet was huge and left me enough for dinner the following night.  I ended my meal with the nutella pie, a delightful combination of nutella, marscapone, and peanut butter in a graham cracker crust.  Fantastic.\n\nThe food was very good and the service was excellent.

Big points here. \n\nSince I've been here so many times, here is a rundown of a few of my personal favorites:\n\nGoat cheese & marscapone dip: Exactly the nom-ness you would expect. Warm creamy dip topped with tasty tomato sauce and served with grilled crostini.\n\nPasta Primavera: Pretty basic, but a light and colorful veggie angel hair dish. I've only ordered this with the EVOO sauce but I'm always adding extra spice to give it a kick.  \n\nButternut squash ravioli: There is a fancier name to this in house, but you'll see what I mean. Delicious, tender butternut squash raviolis with an orange creame sauce, bits of proscuitto, walnuts and sage. It's ass  on a plate and it's amazing.\n\nIt's been a while since I've had dessert here, so I really can't comment on that.

Not sure what made it taste so fantastic but it might have been the olive oil that it was sitting in.  Then, my mom and I split the family style dish \"Pollo Bianco\".  Again, this meal was very good.  5 chicken breasts smothered in a delicious sauce and mushrooms.  We got the garlic mashed potatoes as a side.  Yum!  I, also, ordered Mama's Mojito which is a bit pricey but delicious, nonetheless.  I would definitely go back.  And since they serve family style, I think this place would be great for big groups.

Then my bill would have been about the same or less, I would have gotten what I wanted, and I wouldn't have had to fight for a reservation at the most popular spots. Had I done that at  Mama Ricotta's, I would have ordered the Warm Goat Cheese and Marscapone Dip and Butternut Squash Ravioli or the Cannolicchi Pesto Di Pomodoro Secco.  My taste buds would have been doing the happy dance, because those are my \"go to\" dishes at Mama's, and they never disappoint.\n\nInstead, I had the Mozzarella and Tomatoes Salad, which was good and should have been, because that is a tough dish to turn into a hot mess. I also had Mama's Pesto Pasta, which was on the bland side at the restaurant, but the leftovers were much better the next day after overnight marination. My main course was Veal Milanese Primavera, which was just okay. Judge me if you want, but if veal is on a restaurant menu, I'll generally order it. Like lamb or venison, it is something I'm most likely not going to prepare at home, only because I wouldn't know what to do with it. However, I've sampled quite a bit of veal in restaurants, and this veal was nothing special.\n\nOne of my dinner companions actually did order off of the regular menu, and chose the Canneloni Al Forno. It pains me to say this, because I generally like Mama's, but it was not good. I didn't even know this was possible, but it was fairly flavorless except for the aftertaste, which to me was sour. My companion disagreed on the aftertaste, but felt that it was below average in general because it lacked flavor.\n\nOther companions had the Penne Alla Vodka and the Pollo Carciofi, which they enjoyed.\n\nThe Nutella Pie, though, was more than large enough to share, and was creamy and full of hazelnut and chocolate delectableness, and frankly was what drew me to restaurant week at Mama Ricotta's. As always, the bread was warm, garlicky carbohydrate joy. Service was amiable, if a bit slow on entr\u00e9e delivery and water refills. The half-price wine on Monday nights was also a plus. \n\nFour stars are being given to Mama Ricotta's for their usual fare. For Charlotte Restaurant Week's offerings, I wouldn't be that generous.", "business_id": "MQnNtW1lHS-eid3QNUoUIw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-07-21", "type": "review"}

A lot has changed over the past 15 years regarding what people in America are looking for in food, they've been able to stay relevant while not losing their credibility and identity.\n\nAs for value, it is in line with other quasi-casual Italian restaurants around Charlotte, which (IMHO) are all generally over priced, there are some more fairly priced options but you do have to look for them a bit more.\n\nAll in all you should not be upset with your experience at Mama's.", "business_id": "MQnNtW1lHS-eid3QNUoUIw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-08-28", "type": "review"}

I look through my other shrimps and they all still look very gray.  I ask others at the table and they agree.  When the waitress comes by to check on us I genuinely asked for her opinion as well and she too says it doesn't look cooked - it's raw shrimp! She takes it to be re-cooked and it comes back all well and good but now I'm not really feeling the shrimp so I avoid it.

Call me crazy though, but I would hope places I go to eat would help me avoid getting food poisoning from their food.

Any who growing up on the west side of town, I loved going to beauregrad's to eat, from the salads, to the burgers everything is just great.  I try and visit Beauregard's every time I go to visit my grandma, I went to see her this past Saturday so I decided that I needed a Beauregard's grilled chicken salad in my life.  I knew that they had the Murder Mystery thing going on, but I didn't think it was as big as it is.  So I called my food in like I always do, and went to pick it up about 10 minutes later.  I got there and it was no where to park, this is something that I'm not use to.  So I had to park further down then I was use to, I think the spaces made just for pick up were all taken up by the murder mystery people.....shame.  Any who, I got out the car and wow there was a crowd of people waiting to get in the door.  It made me feel like this was the last place to eat at on Freedom Dr.  Can any one say fire hazard?  Tried to get in the door, and the rude people waiting at the door were too snooty to be there.  But I gave them the benefit of a doubt, made my way in the door no one wanting to move, or being nice enough to do so.  So I had to push my way in, got the same excellent service as I always do.  Leaving I had to again push my way through the door, the rudest people ever.  Made me say hmm I don't think I want to go back if I'm visiting my grandma on the weekend again.  But I shouldn't let butt holes ruin my time with Beauregard's.  I just wish they could better plan this event, make it so that the people waiting to see this show come in on the other side of the building and let the other door be for those who aren't there to see the show, and those who just want take out.  Other than that, the food was great as always, I ate it so fast I don't remember what it taste like.

We didn't wait too long for initial server visit, and I could tell by her fumbling through notes that she was probably new.  When she couldn't tell me what the seasonal draft was, but quickly told me that they only had bottles, I should have asked for another table.  We ordered our appetizer and boys' food first, then our entrees.  \n\nThe food came out in a timely manner, but then we didn't see the waitress for a while.  We were all hoping for a refill and I kept looking around, but never saw her even walking near the registers.  All the other wait staff were moving around, checking on tables, but ten minutes goes by before even see her, and had to flag her down.  \n\nI asked for refills on sodas and water, and for a draft of another brew, then another ten minutes goes by before she returns with refills and news that all the draft beers were back in bottles.  \n\nWhat? \n\n\"They don't have any more drafts.\"  Fine, another bottle.  Still no entrees.  Five minutes later she returns with a bottle, puts it on the table, walks on.  We have empty plates and cups sitting on the edge of the table, and start looking around for her again.  No sign.  \n\nFinally, after flagging her down again and ASKING about our food, she goes into the back, then comes out and tells us that our food has been delivered to another table, and would we like the kitchen to start plates for us to eat in or take-out. \n\n Blank stare.  \n\nI asked if the kitchen almost had ours ready since there was a mix-up.  No, she says, she has to tell them if we are taking it out. I ask \"What did the manager on duty say?\"  She said \"He's in the kitchen.\"  Blood begins to boil: \"We will Not be eating in OR take-out, please just give us our check.\"  Comes back a few minutes later, bill is $49+ and she walks off.  I look over the ticket: double charged for drinks, charged for draft brews that apparently didn't even exist, and No response from the manager.  \n\nI ask the nearest server if she could could kindly summon the manager for me.  He was out in less than a minute, very courteous, and asks what is wrong.  I explain, in this much detail, what had happened.  He informs me that he has no knowledge of any misdirected food NOR has he taken anything off our ticket.  He then took the ticket and cleared it out except for the two bottles of re-bottled draft.  I left a minimal gratuity based on charged beverages alone; I hate being lied to.\n\nWill not be returning to this location. We MAY try another franchise, but with so many other restaurants that actually TRY, why should I bother?  The chain as a whole has lowered standards too much to be taken seriously as a restaurant.  They are pretty much a bar with extra tables nowadays.", "business_id": "qZ1bDtcercwUw4w7trpVjQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-08-11", "type": "review"}

He never came to check on us once we got our food or asked if anybody wanted to order another drink. Before he brought the checks I asked for 2 of the Tennessee whiskey cakes. He then brought the checks and didn't add the cakes in. My total was $19.52, so I paid with a $20 and we were all going to leave a tip collectivity. I was the only person that paid cash. When he returned to the table, he brung everyone else their cards back, kept my change and receipt, and didn't return with my cake. He said y'all have a good night. I then asked him where my cake was because at that point I wasn't worried about the change. He says \"oh, damn... I didn't put it in. You still want it?\" DUH! That was the purpose of me telling you I wanted it! He put the order in, brung the cakes, then says y'all have a good night. I'm thinking that because he had such horrible service, the cakes were free because he didn't bring a check. He watched us get up and leave out.

Tough, clearly overcooked, and just downright horrible.  I think I would have had better luck buying frozen at the grocery store.

My family and I go here from time to time, but I think today's visit will be our last.  We got a table right away, but we waited about 15 minutes before our waitress arrived.  She apologized and said no one had told her that we were there. I ordered bruschetta and salad and my companions had soup and salad.  Olive Garden's soups are pretty good, I'll grant them that.  But the bruschetta was just awful.  It was just toast with chopped tomatoes, no garlic, salt or olive oil at all.  The breadsticks and salad  were just ok; I don't see why people rave over them.  Salad did have pepperoncini peppers, which were a nice touch. The waitress was polite but seemed to be either new or overwhelmed. She never refilled any of our drinks and just seemed sort of distracted. We left her a nice tip though.  I've been a waitress and know how hard it can be, especially at a chain restaurant where the crowds and their demands are never-ending.  \n\nI'm no food snob, but Olive Garden seems to aspire to lowest-common-denominator, faux-Italian food for people who've never had the real thing and don't know what they're missing.", "business_id": "H0D2HYqLd9MRCq68rtbTyQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-07-30", "type": "review"}

After about ten more minutes the waiter showed up with the breadsticks and salad. At that very same time our main entree came out.

Ten minutes go by while we gnawed on old cold breadsticks and soggy salad still waiting on my drink and our appetizers while intently listening to our waiter recall his hometown antics with the table next to us.

We decided to embrace a restaurant with a ridiculous, punny title, and a cartoon picture of a man with a wonky, paintbrush mustache.  Great decision.\n\nThe Great Impasta is a half block east of Neil Street in downtown Champaign and despite teh fact that their outside tables were covered in construction worker dust, the staff was friendly and self-effacing enough to jokingly clean them off for us so we could enjoy the balmy Saturday evening (on nights like these, if I close my eyes, I can pretend I'm back home in San Diego, sigh).\n\nThe stuffed mushrooms were good, although not the highest quality, but the bartender was ON POINT.  I asked him on a whim to make me something \"silly and dangerous, with a hint of vanilla\" (because i'm an ass and I can ask things like this.  Don't try it at home).\n\nHe came back with a mix of kahlua, grand marnier, vanilla vodka, bailey's, and a chocolate liquor.  He then apologized for putting a bit more vodka than he planned, but it was fantastical.  We named it a \"Cow of Color,\" since brown cow sounded too...cliche.\n\nOur server, Lara, was funny, outgoing, friendly and helpful with charm and a great attitude.  She helped us choose some delicious pasta dishes that weren't too heavy and just flavorful enough, and I admit I went for a cream/chicken dish.  Whatevs.  I'll run tomorrow while hating my new waist size.\n\nMore important, however, was the slightly hilarious decor provided by one of the staff, who paints pictures, including watercolors of her fellow employees.  Imagine our surprise when Liz and I saw the busboy's painted visage staring prominently at us from a main wall.  It was more fun to pretend to be interested in buying the painting just to make him uncomfortable.\n\nThe Great Impasta lost their lease on that corner so they're only in business on Church Street until December 31.  Then the spot becomes a bank (WTF), while they hunt for a new location.  Go while you can.  The food is good, the bartenders amenable, the staff fantastic.  Go now.  Log off the damn computer, hop a flight if you have to.  I'll even pick you up from Willard airport if I have to.

My favorite is the Market Monday prix fixe menu with ingredients selected from the saturday farmers market.  to go from fresh local ingredients on saturday morning to a full 5 course meal and wine pairings by monday night is pretty spectacular.  The last couple market night meals that i have been to have been around 40 dollars, and for an additional 25, you can get some awesome wines (highly recommended). The courses are so elegantly prepared with amazing presentation and you won't go home hungry.

Back then (about 30 years ago) it was one of the few restaurants in town, so the wait was considerable. That lobby is still there with the same stand-up video games and circa 20s sofas (reupholstered of course) and the restaurant still seems to be a place for an adventurous child to find hidden secrets and exotic places. Back then the wait to sit in the trolley (since removed and replaced with a replica) was over an hour. As a child the mystique of its cavernous faux Tiffany-style glass-enclosed \"rooms\" was a wondrous delight that could now only be matched in adult scale by the extravagance of the Winchester mansion of California.\n\nI've been back 4 or 5 times in recent months and am consistently surprised that for a restaurant that could seat a thousand, I must wait 10 to 15 minutes for a table. Tonight I was making my way back across the cavernous lobby to leave when I was called to be seated. I should have just left.\n\nOnce inside I discover why the wait is so long. Every table as far as the eye can see is covered with dirty dishes and glasses, but no one is sitting at any of them. How long they have been in such a state is anyone's guess, but tonight I was able to sit in the fake trolley and so was afforded the opportunity to see that only 2 of them were cleared throughout my entire meal. What a disgrace! You all should be ashamed of yourselves!\n\nOur server was extremely attentive and did his job with careful precision and punctuality. The only major error was when he kicked a piece of trash in the small walkway between trolley tables to a nearby corner. Oh my God; I just wanted to get up and go over and pick it up. Was that a crust of bread??!?!?! When he first arrived at our table, I asked if he needed some help clearing all these tables. What a disgrace! He told me that when he walked in, there were 130 people waiting in the lobby.\n\nThe food was exactly as expected -- somewhere below the quality of an Olive Garden. I think someone else here may have made the same comparison. Pasta overcooked to the point it can just barely hold its form anymore; meat sauce so gritty you wonder if this is what Manwich tastes like. Meatballs well formed and of overall good taste, but spiced with powdered everything, and old powder at that. Parmesan passed my test with little recognizable filler and of good body. Didn't taste like sawdust.\n\nBread obviously ordered by the hundred thousand, and obviously arrived frozen and partially cooked, Shamrock style, with the finish in a quick-heat just before serving. The cutting boards still have a second indentation for the garlic butter, but none was served. The butter that arrived was nothing like butter, but instead a whipped watery creamy colored stuff that should be the last straw that finally convinces you to throw down your napkin and sue \"I can't believe it's not butter\" for false advertising.\n\nThe salad was mostly dismal. The only redeeming ingredient in the entire meal was the olive oil used in the \"balsamic\" vinaigrette. I had to take several concentrated bites to try to convince myself that the red-wine vinegar they were trying to pass off as Balsamic was not actually cleaning-grade white vinegar, but the olive oil was really nice. Never mind  the basil or parsley or the whatever-name-you-can-come-up-with tasteless flakes in the dressing that had to be at least 20 years old. Ew.\n\nThere are times when I wish I could go back. I wish I hadn't dined under the artistry of chefs who celebrate the creation of cuisine. I used to be able to enjoy this crap, oblivious to the talent that's out there. Unfortunately Phoenix is slowly but surely returning to its roots. Where is our talent?

Money was tight back then and TOSF soon became one of our favorite eats.  I hate to compare this place to a fast food restaurant, but this place is like the \"McDonald's\" of Italian food.  Now let me explain that.  When you go to McDonald's, it doesn't matter where in the country, or in the world, you are, when you order a cheeseburger, you know what you are going to get.  It's consistent and it's inexpensive.  The same can be said for TOSF.   It's decent quality Italian food, at very fair prices.  \n\nI've sampled many things on the menu over the years, but lately I always get the same thing when we go out for dinner; Spaghetti and Meatballs.  I know most people wouldn't think to order something that you can make at home out, but I like a good meat sauce and my wife would rather have marinara.  So, for me, it's a treat.  She adores the spaghetti with mizithra cheese and brown butter, although, last night she ordered the meatloaf and said she found a new favorite dish.  I'll have to try it next time.  I'm usually the one that goes for the \"soul food\".  Dinner is usually served with a salad, and their creamy pesto dressing (similar to a ranch) is really amazing.  Remember to save a little room for desert, because you always get your choice of a scoop of ice cream, spumoni, or sherbet afterwards.\n\nTOSF is definitely kid friendly.  It is a true family restaurant.  The trolley car in the middle of the restaurant is always a draw with the little ones.  There can be a wait sometimes.  Call ahead and put your name on the list, since they don't take reservations.  The 1980's era arcade games are great to pass the time and bring back many memories of wasted quarters of my youth.

I was excited we might eat at one of my favorites along Central (Postino, Fez, Windsor).  But, since it was really my friend's day, when she asked about restaurants, I deferred, \"What did you have in mind?\"  She said \"How about The Old Spaghetti Factory\".  I tried not to let my lip curl in disgust (I dislike all chain Italian restaurants).  But, again, deferring to her, I said \"Sure, I always like to try new places.\" \n\nWe were seated fairly promptly.  The decor was kitschy, but we had a nice table with comfy chairs.  Our waiter brought bread and took our drink order.  I asked if their iced tea was caffeine free, he said \"Oh yes, we brew it ourselves.\"  WHAT?!?.  Just because they brew it instead of taking it from a soda gun doesn't guarantee it's caffeine free.\n\nHaving been there before, my friend knew she wanted the lasagna.  Being Italian, I never order lasagna in restaurants as I know mine is better ( I make 2 kinds of lasagna, regular that just takes a few hours, and then the grand dame,  lasagna bolognese, which takes 2 days, with all the braising and creating 2 separate sauces).  I had a bad vibe theirs wouldn't hold a candle to even my \"lazy\" lasagna.  I chose spaghetti with mizithra and brown butter, supposedly their signature dish.  All entrees come with bread, soup or salad, and tea or coffee.\n\nOur waiter took our order.  My friend asked for the lunch portion of lasagna.  The waiter replied \"Oh, we don't have lunch portions of the lasagna, just dinner size.\".  My first thought: it's FROZEN.  My second thought: nice way to up-sell buddy.  She had cream of broccoli soup and I had salad with pesto ranch on the side.  Our waiter delivered the soup and salad, but forgot the dressing.  He said he'd be right back with it.  When we flagged him down 5 minutes later, he was surprised I had no dressing, saying \"I told the busboy to bring it to you.\"  This must have been the same busboy who was so busy doing anything but his job that a nearby table remained uncleared during our entire meal.  Soon, he dropped off a small silver dish containing a pesto ranch popsicle.  Yes, the dressing was FROZEN.  I had to stir it so it would thaw enough to pour.  The salad was a big plate of pedestrian iceberg, cabbage and carrots with packaged croutons that appeared as if they had been chopped in half to stretch them.\n\nMy friend was sorely disappointed with her lasagna, saying it didn't taste like she remembered from past visits.  I told her it was probably because it was frozen pre-packaged, which was why they couldn't cut it into lunch portions.  My spaghetti with mizithra was so bland, I'm sure any finicky toddler or nursing home patient with a digestive disorder could have tolerated it (and I'm not insulting seniors or anyone with digestive issues, as my husband suffers from one, I'm just commenting on the utter lack of flavor in this dish).  Where's the garlic?  Where's the nutty goodness of brown butter?  I don't think what they used ever came from a cow, I'm quite sure it was industrial grade margarine.  \n\nSadly, even their bread wasn't all that flavorful.  It looked and smelled good when it first arrived hot to the table, but shortly after, it seemed extremely flavorless and the \"butter\" added nothing.\n\nAll I could think was \"Robert Irvine would have a field day trying to fix this place on Restaurant:  Impossible!\", then I remembered he doesn't work with chains.  As Daniel D alluded, Olive Garden would have been a better choice.", "business_id": "DlCtdbceo4YNSI53cCL2lg", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-06-12", "type": "review"}

At least, not to anyone I liked...\n\n\nThe Expectation:  Her Dad wanted to take the two of us out for dinner, and his wife had suggested 'The Old Spaghetti Factory'. I had never been to the place before, but I know a few of my family have went there on separate occasions with nothing but good things to say. So, I figured we'd try it, I'd say I was even eager to do so.\n\n\nThe Wait:  We arrived for dinner, roughly about 6pm on a weeknight. We were told by the hostess that it would be about \"ten or fifteen minutes\" to seat our table of four. At first, I thought that was a little weird, seing it didn't appear ridiculously busy from the lobby or by the amount of cars parked outside, and it wasn't like we were an abnormally large group. But it was cool, they had what seemed like several waiting rooms with different types of chairs and sofas to sit on, and some cool, old \"stuff\" to look at.\n\n...Twenty minutes later.\nIt seemed like there were at least three different, larger groups of people that came in after us, and were seated before us. I wasn't really sure how that worked, but, just as I was just about to approach the hostess podium to inquire about our wait, the hostess called our party's name and began to walk us to our table.\n\n\nThe Service:  Our hostess sat us at a four top table, located in one of the corners of the main dinning room. She apologized for the wait, noting that the area we' were sitting in was supposed to be closed, but they were making room in order to seat us, she also mentioned that our waitress should be by in a minute or so. It didn't take long for our waitress to come by to tell us she'd be right with us, but then it took forever for her to return and take our drink order.\n\nOne of the least pleasant particulars of the evening was our waitress being super short with us at every encounter. It was like we had done something wrong by sitting in her section. By the time she returned with our drinks, I think we all knew exactly what we were ordering; which seemed to somehow catch her off guard, as if she was stressed to take our order.\n\n\nThe Meal:  I had the Chicken Marsala which came with Mizithra Cheese & Browned Butter, and my girlfriend had the Spinach & Cheese Ravioli. Both entrees included bread for the table, and the choice of soup or salad. I had a Caesar (upgraded at an additional cost.) and she had a side salad with vinaigrette.\n\nThe salads were alright, iceberg lettuce, which was 'meh' and the Caesar came with tomatoes, which I scoffed at, just a little. My entree wasn't horrible, although, it did seem like a pretty measly serving for the price. It tasted just mediocre, - I could've swore the tomatoes/sauce on the Raviolis was canned, whatever it was, it was pretty bitter. \n\nI'm usually not one to complain about the waiting staff allowing you to enjoy your meal in peace, but that was not the case in this instance. The waitress rarely came by the table to check on us, at all. She came by and asked us if we enjoyed our meal, (laughable,) if there was anything more she could get for us, or if we needed to-go boxes, while taking our dishes away. She left us, again, for an eternity. Returning with our check and some small boxes.\n\n\nThe Outcome:  I tried to keep the group positive while we sat, as others around us seemed to be enjoying themselves. But without another, much improved dinning experience, I would probably go elsewhere. Honestly, I don't love/hate/mind Olive Garden, but this place wasn't even that good.\n\nI walked my girlfriend back to our car with a disappointed stomach, and a sad little to-go box, both half-full of mediocre food. - Maybe we can go somewhere good on Friday night...", "business_id": "DlCtdbceo4YNSI53cCL2lg", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-07-04", "type": "review"}

When we first arrived, I told them who I was and we are early. The hostess said that we were going to need to wait for our reservation time. While I was in shock, I asked her. So if we just walked in now and asked for a table, we would be seated now? This is when she said one moment so she can talked to her supervisor. She sat us when she came back and apologized. I told her there was no apology needed. She asked us if we needed them to keep the birthday cake Denise baked in storage which was very helpful.\nNatalie the birthday girl was in awe on the decor of the restaurant and very excited that we ate in the trolley. I ordered the gluten free baked chicken and pasta. It was better then I thought it was going to be. At my age, I am trying healthier food options. Although the chicken was a little dry, pasta was very good. The two girls had spaghetti and meat sauce and had no complaints from them. Not going into detail on what everyone else had, but there was no complaints from them either. When we were finished, they came out with the cake, ice cream, and sang Natalie the birthday song. I believe this is going to be a great memory for her. I know that Natalie never had the chance to experience things like this.

Even though I'm from Buffalo, NY, a city with as many pizza joints as Phoenix has Circle K's, I like Pizza Hut.  It was always the excursion for us growing up.  Sure, we could get a $5 large delivered from the place down the street, but Pizza Hut was an evening out.  A restaurant for pizza, complete with the low-hung light fixtures and the red plastic glasses, it was a special occasion.  And although their pizza was nothing like normal pizza, I developed a special fondness in my tummy for the pan pizza.\n\nAnd, I'm about to write a review for Domino's as a comparison to this debacle.\n\nWe ordered online + 1 star. The website said that it would take 90 minutes - 1 star.\n\nThey have blue cheese + 1 star.  The restaurant called to say that they no longer carry blue cheese - 1 star.\n\nWe ordered wings that were actually pretty spicy +1 star. They were breaded and had something sweet and sticky on it - 1 star.\n\nThe marinara sauce was watered down - 1 star\n\nThe delivery guy got lost, forgot the credit card slip and forgot the soda we ordered.  Then he had the nerve to ask me if we still wanted it.  Then he said it would take him an HOUR to return with the pop. -1 stars.\n\nThe order was delivered in less than the estimated 90 minutes (minus the pop), he did come back to deliver the 2 liter in less than 30 minutes, and the food was as mediocre as I expected it to be. + 2 stars\n\nI would give a zero if I had to leave the house for this kind of service, but since dinner was delivered they earn 1 star.", "business_id": "avPNEqlXgyBvTXjb-ujQFA", "stars": 1, "date": "2008-06-04", "type": "review"}

We ordered the 10\" size which had 6 pieces ... I'd say this was the right for two if you're hungry & also get appetizer to share. Lastly, we finished off with snickers cheesecake. I personally wasn't a fan of it, especially compared to other cheesecakes I've had in the past.\n\nOverall, the impression was that everything was just good ... Nothing great that you'd rave about to friends & family but nothing bad either; we're undecided whether or not we'd go back.", "business_id": "PEHJjxdw11TGFma9Zhz3ng", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-06-01", "type": "review"}

I had fries, they were parmesan and herb sprinkled, and good. Macaroni salad was fine, nothing special, but I always hope for mac and cheese. The wedges were also excellent, and as I said, three of them were almost an entire half potato.\n\nBut the chicken was the star. The outer coating was crispy, not as puffy as KFC or other fried chicken, and somewhat reminiscent of home cooked chicken. The inside had more of that roasted taste with very little if any grease. It's like getting rotisserie chicken with a fried coating.\n\nJust writing this review has me considering going to get some broasted tastiness later today.\n\nOh ya, service, etc. It was fine.

We just moved to Anthem from Dallas Texas and were looking for a great pizza/Italian place to eat at, but this is NOT the place.  We entered and there were only two other  dinners in the place, one was a family of 5 and the other was a family of 3, we were a party of 2.  We were seated and told that are waitress would be with us in just a minute.  Well, that minute turned out to be about 10 minutes.  Having had time to read the menu about a dozen times while we waited, when our waitress finally did show up we were ready to order but she ask us if we wanted to put in a drink order?  Really???  So we did put in an order for 2 glasses of wine and asked for water as well.  About 10 minutes later we received our wine (very small pour indeed) and no water?  As we were waiting for our food order (I'll get to that train wreck in just a minute) we noticed that the other two occupied tables were having issues with their orders and all we could hear was the waitress consistently apologizing, we also watch as the other tables food was delivered, ONE freaken plate at a time, first one child got some breadsticks, then about 4 minutes later the other child got a salad, then about 10 minutes later the father got his order, then they apparently asked for water and it was delivered ONE glass at a time by the same server (not waiter???) then we experienced the same absolutely mind numbing food delivery, with the exception that I had ordered the 10\" pizza (which was pretty good after a 20 minuet wait) but my wife had ordered a chicken pasta dish, which we never received.  The waitress brought the pizza and two plates and started to walk away and I ask where my wife's meal was and she looked stunned, walked away and came back and told us that she had turned in the order but the \"kitchen\" must have misread it, but she would re-enter the order, well that was about 2 glasses of wine each and one very small pizza later, which had already taken about 55 minutes....duh!  So we simply told her to cancel the order and we would just pay for the pizza and wine and be happy to leave.  It was one of the worst dinning experiences we have ever had.  The \"manager\" was there, tending a small bar, at which NO ONE was sitting, but he did manage to go and clean the back door glass while all of his customers were waiting for service.

Was I disappointed.   \n\nMy $8 tuna sandwich, straight off the menu, was supposed to come with fancy olives and red onion and came with neither - just tuna and copious arugula on spongy flatbread.  I was surprised, considering they make the same three or four items over and over, and disappointed, since I was craving a richly texured, crunchy construction. The tuna tasted fine - I think they put some lemon in it and maybe there's an olive or two pulverized beyond recognition into the paste - but it's no better than when I open a can of albacore at home and add a little horseradish or curry or what have you and slap some water chestnuts on top - or when I go to Subway and pile black olives, tomato and cheese on a larger, cheaper sub ( on admittedly inferior bread).  The bread here was round and chewy, spongy, but not crunchy at all - reminded me of the bread at Schlotsky's - the whole thing was just kind of flat.  \n\nMy son had the salami and provelone and said it was \"good\". Not great or amazing. Just \"good\".  We spent $21.62 on two smallish sandwiches and creme sodas to go. No sides. Meh.  \n\nThe girls in front were friendly and efficient and the food came out incredibly fast - so quick I wondered if (dare I say it?) my sandwich was PRE-MADE. Mine tasted like it could have been. I dont know if the bread was intended to be warm or not, but after a 10 min drive home, it wasnt.  They use nice heavy paper to wrap up the food and a cute paper \"to-go\" bag with a handle. \n\nThe waiting area is small and there's one (1) metal folding chair for people to sit on. I guess the idea is to walk around and peruse the tiny $16 bottles of imported capers instead, and since it's 110 outside I really wouldnt expect more air conditioned seating from the guy who makes folks wait hours for pizza across town instead of simply taking reservations. \n\nSomeday, I'll come back to try the mozzarella and tomato cuz I still remember how good his cheese tasted a decade earlier, and Chris B's track record has certainly earned him a second chance, but I wont be burning my gas or wallet on return trips this hot summer, based on today's experience.", "business_id": "-AAig9FG0s8gYE4f8GfowQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-07-22", "type": "review"}

I got the tomato, basil and mozarella.  And I also got the sopresetta and provlone with roasted peppers. \n\nThe sopresetta was one of the top 5 sandwiches I have ever had.

It was definitely a bit of a drive, since I'm all the way out in Glendale right now, but I figured it would probably be worth it. \n\nThey have a very small storefront; the bulk of the space is the baking operation and sandwich-making in the back - and I could tell because it was all open. I love being able to see the food I'm about to eat being made (who doesn't?) and seeing/smelling the fresh bread coming out of the oven definitely upped my anticipation. The staff was really friendly, which is always a plus. I ordered two sandwiches, the tuna and the soppressata, and they were ready within 5 minutes, still all nice and warm. Unfortunately, I had to cart them all the way back to Glendale so my boyfriend could get his, so I didn't get to taste mine fresh.\n\nHe said his was awesome, and had never had roasted red peppers that were so delicious, but I was slightly more on the fence about my tuna. Not that it wasn't good, it was a great quality sandwich and the bread was amazing. I think it was just the flavor combination for me, I guess I'm used to my tuna being seasoned a certain way, and having something so different wasn't quite up my alley. But knowing their quality now, I will certainly be back to try something else.\n\nI will say that the price was slightly high, which I expected, but I was a little disappointed that the prices on their website are incorrect. My sandwich was $9.50 and my boyfriend's was $9, instead of the $8 posted on their website. \n\nIn summary, good food, good experience, I'd come back if I had some extra money in my bank account and was craving a delicious sandwich on high quality bread.", "business_id": "-AAig9FG0s8gYE4f8GfowQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-07-07", "type": "review"}

Oh, so close!\n\nI've stopped in to Pane Bianco a couple of times and have enoyed the non-commercial sandwiches here.  And by \"non-commercial\", I mean the type my Italian Mom used to make when I was a kid.\n\nOn my first visit I had what amounted to the caprese sandwich (mozzarella, tomato & basil.)  PB is known for its mozzarella, so I wasn't surprised by its goodness, but I swear the sprig of basil must have been just picked that day...so flavorful and fragant.  It really made the sammy!  The price was about $8.50.  If I would have stopped there, PB would have have five stars.\n\nOn my second visit I had the Market Sandwich (mortadella, peach relish, pecorino and greens).  The mortadella seemed a bit flavorless.  It was sliced thin (which I love) but could have used an extra layer.  It just seemed as though the pecorino (perhaps due to the saltiness) and sweetness of the peach relish (a slight departure from the website description) overpowered the mortadella.  In fact, the sandwich was a bit on the dry side and could have used a bit more of the relish for moisture, especially in light of the fact this type of bread tends to be on the dry side.  The relish really shouldn't be any sweeter as, it too, runs the risk of overpowering the flavor of the meat.  If Chris Bianco can find a way to add greater volume to the relish without adding any additional sweetness, I'd give PB five stars!  Now, if only something can be done about the $11 price tag, this could be an \"A+\" sandwich!\n\nFeel like getting experiemntal at home?  Be sure to grab a freshly baked loaf before you leave.  A bargain at just $3.\n\nMy only real disappointment is that PB isn't open on Sunday.  Hopefully, they'll expand once Lux moves from the space they occupy next door and Pane Bianco will have reason to expand both their space AND their hours of operation.  Who knows...maybe even offer some vino???\n\nI still crave Pane Bianco and can't wait to go back,  I'm already salivating over the Soppressata with Aged Provolone & Roasted Peppers.

Having made my pilgrimage to the eponymous pizzeria during my first trip to Phoenix, Pane had been on my radar since the day I moved to town but given the lunch-only hours and my office location in North Scottsdale I knew a weekend would be best and as luck would have it a new website (http://www.pizzeriabianco.com/) and seven day 11a-3p schedule had been rolled out just the week prior.\n\nArriving at the surprisingly large space (especially when compared to Matt's and JoBot from earlier that day - and compared to Pizzeria Bianco as well) shortly after 11:30 and allocating parking in the free lot juxtaposing the Light Rail I debated for a moment whether dine-in or to-go was best and opting for the former made my way into the restaurant where two couples already sat.  Greeted by one of two servers it was suggested I could take \"any seat I wanted\" and opting for a bench in the center of the room where a menu awaited I sat down to browse the menu as well as the daily specials listed on the chalkboard - almost all sounding appealing, but a bit different than the Saturday special listed on the website.  With a small list of beverages available I was asked soon if I was ready to order or if I needed a few minutes I deferred and requested a glass of water that would never reach even half-empty despite me drinking from it consistently and the restaurant soon filling to capacity.\n\nHaving debated the specials but eventually undeterred from the reason I'd come in the first place I soon placed my order for a sandwich and an 'appetizer' which I was told would be 'just a few minutes' and as while I waited I checked out the small market at the Take Away section featuring the famous focaccia, cans of tomatoes, dried pasta, and apparel before returning to my seat where my items would arrive shortly - the first a Manchego and Tomato Sauce Focaccia del Giorno featuring Bianco's delectable wood fired focaccia in all of its spongy glory topped with sweet, ripe tomatoes and an ample layer of briny Manchego; at $4.50 probably the most expensive \"Grandma Slice\" I've ever had yet at the same time also probably the best...or at least on par with that at DiFara in Brooklyn for best of its genre.\n\nMoving next to the original target of my desire, a sandwich of Bianco's House Made Mozzarella, Tomatoes, and Basil on Wood Fired Focaccia my first thought was \"wow - that is a lot of cheese\" while my second, after a bite, was \"wow - that is a lot of flavor.\"  Perhaps as pure of a sandwich as you can find and the result of exquisite ingredients on top quality bread there is really nothing 'special' about the composition of this sandwich aside from the fact that it simply works - a largely unmanipulated masterpiece only improved by a touch of sea salt and cracked black pepper.\n\nLargely unaware on entering that Pane serves dessert it was with much delight that I realized soon after sitting down that three options were available that day and while the flourless chocolate cake I saw emerge from the kitchen to the table next to me looked quite nice there was simply no way I was passing up the Organic Vanilla Bean Rice Pudding with Candied Pecans - another simplistic stunner with creamy Arborio rice imbued with a rich vanilla custard flicked with whole vanilla beans and a few pecans for crunch.  Delicate and smooth, flavorful without being overly sweet, and *almost* thick enough to stand a spoon up straight it was not quite the best rice pudding I've ever had - but a top five contender without a shadow of a doubt - a reason in and of itself to return to Pane Bianco...though to be fair, if I returned it would take pretty spectacular daily specials to prevent me from ordering the exact same trio of items once again.  With Chris and his team now two for two it is only a matter of time before I make my way to Italian Restaurant... and honestly, that time is likely measured in hours and days as opposed to weeks and months.", "business_id": "-AAig9FG0s8gYE4f8GfowQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-08-13", "type": "review"}

Seriously...this is one of the few spots on Central not open late!\n\nI made it at 7-ish, not realizing they closed at 8. I didn't want to be THAT GUY, but staff was definitely still eager to serve a first timer. We kicked off supper with bread and olive oil. Theirs was the best olive oil I've enjoyed on this side of the Atlantic. Delicious, even if the thick, fresh bread was a tad sweet for my taste. \n\nIn mere minutes, I was delightfully presented with the \"Sonny Boy\", a simple pizza with soppressata + kalamata, or in painfully layman terms, pepperoni and olive. I usually hate olives, even kalamata, but these were good. There are limits to any desirable quality in a pizza. We don't want it to be too salty, and surprisingly this was not. We don't want the sauce, crust, or any singular element to overpower another aspect, and for the most part, it was all well balanced. I was able to appreciate it all. \n\nMy only criticism is the cheese itself, which would be refreshing in a caprese or on a white pie, but was just not BOLD enough. It was too milky. Too fatty, even. After doing the most extensive research that has ever gone into a review, perhaps this is from using a more local product rather than the rare Mozarella Di Bufala variety that's hard to get your hands on, but has an unforgettable taste. \n\nIt was so, so close to perfection. Or perhaps I've got some leveling up to do before reaching the status of a true cheese aficionado. Feel free to give your input. \n\nOverall, this is very VERY good pizza, decent bread, and great service. As they closed, they even gave us a complementary loaf to-go.  I was honestly hoping to just grab a sandwich, which I will return to do on the rare occasion I'm not on Central for the nightlife. I wish I could give a 4.5, but since they were nice, a full 5 stars it is.

The service was 100 percent completely horrendous. I will break it down nice and easy for ya:\n\nThe boy and I took our friend Brittany S. for a birthday lunch.\nBrittany and I were seated, while the boy finished a phone call outside.\nBrittany and I placed our orders. I, a slice of pizza from their lunch menu, and she a house salad with chicken. We informed the server the boy would be in and would also be ordering something.\nThe boy finally arrived and we placed his order - a Bollo Pasta from the lunch menu, and a toasted ravioli appetizer. \nBrittany and I's food arrived first. Mine was fine, or rather, correct (the pizza tasted horrible), while hers was missing the chicken. She called the server over and asked if she could have a side of chicken and he looked at her like it was the most ridiculous request he's ever had. He looked at her strangely for a minute or so, until finally he said \"oh, did you want chicken on that?\". DUH. \nAt this point, Brittany had gotten up to make a phone call, so Mike and I requested a birthday pizzookie for her. You know, they would embarrass her with the whole singing cheesiness bit. We specifically explain this to the server and he nods his head and asks what kind of pizzookie we want. Great! Or so we thought.\nSo after that Brittany and I slowly eat our food, thinking the boy's would be out at any moment. 10 minutes.. 15 minutes... 20 minutes... 25 minutes passed by and still no food. The joint wasn't busy so we were a little confused. Our server must have noticed our confusion because he came over and asked us if we wanted to order some more food. REALLY?! \"We already ordered his food - 25 minutes ago\". \"OOOOH, ok, I'll put that in for you\" was his dumb-ass remark. OK, thanks, bud! \n15 minutes later the rest of the food arrives, and our server says \"oh, now that wasn't too bad!\" - yeah, except we waited a total of 40 minutes for a goddamned bowl of angel hair with marinara. \n\nSo Mike ate his food and we chatted, when the server came over, gave me a look, and pointed his fingers at me, and said \"oooh, gotcha\". I'm assuming he forgot about our pizzookie as well, and quickly remembered upon the \"I'm going to kill you\" look I gave him. \n\n10 minutes later we see him coming with the pizzookie. Here we are, expecting some big embarrassing birthday song (because they DO do birthdays at Oregano's), and all he does is set the cookie down on the table, looks at Brittany, and says \"so, it's your birthday?\", then awkwardly looks at Mike and I like we are supposed to know what to do. WHAT?! NO BIRTHDAY SONG?! He smiles awkwardly and walks away. \n\nBy this point Mike and I are so furious that we are ready to stand up and scream in this guys face. We eat the cookie and he brings us our bill. Hell no did he charge us for EVERY single little thing he forgot. He also didn't give us the lunch special prices (we ordered before the cut off) Come on, we weren't expecting you to comp our entire bill, but seriously. Don't charge us the $2.50 for the chicken you forgot, or the two dishes you forgot, or the birthday cookie that you totally screwed up and still had the nerve to ring in as \"birthday\" and charge us for it, or overcharge us for the lunch plates. SERIOUSLY?! \n\nWe threw down and left. Pissed. Pissed that our server forgot every single thing we ordered. Pissed that we spent almost two hours on lunch because of it. And pissed that he didn't even once acknowledge our frustrations. I won't be coming back here again.

BE CAREFUL: People who have been drinking tend to drive out of there without even looking. Do not leave any valuables visible in your car, not even a CD. The area around 10th St and Camelback experiences a lot of smash and grab theft and even assault, so be aware of your surroundings.

And because I live in this neighborhood, and we have found Oregano's most unreceptive to working with the neighborhood residents to overcome parking and litter problems, and an increase in crime associated with these problems.", "business_id": "ML1RJdeZ7bbfMrHvJ7m99A", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-06-27", "type": "review"}

There is always a ridiculous wait time here. It doesn't matter when you come, it is ALWAYS busy. Always. \n\n2.) I love the food. It's definitely a bang for your buck and man, is it good. \n\n3.) PIZZOOKIE. Nuff said.\n\n4.) Gibbilinni Bellini. Again, nuff said. \n\nThe service is usually great...perhaps to make up for the outrageous wait times? Anyway, my last visit here was rather hectic; my mother was in town so we planned a dinner here for her with most of our extended family (a 20 person group). I understood this might be difficult considering the size of the place, so I called a couple of days prior to see if they could in fact accommodate us. Sure, they said. Because they don't take reservations over the phone, I would need to go to the restaurant the day of to put our name on the list. They assured me \"no worries, we'll take care of you and have everything ready.\"\n\nSo I head to the restaurant around 1 pm to put our names on the list for 6 pm. We get there at 550 and are told it's going to be a 45 - 60 minute wait. Wait, seriously? So then why did I make a trip several hours prior because that's what you told me would ensure we're seated on time? \n\nSo our party of twenty is waiting outside in the hot parking lot (because of course there wasn't enough room in the waiting area) for nearly an hour. They were very accommodating with water and drinks while we waited, which was nice. The only thing that was really irritating about the wait was the whole time thing: we were constantly being told, oh, it'll be just a minute, or oh, they're bussing it now. When all we needed to do was step is side and see that nothing was actually happening, so we felt like we were being jerked around so we wouldn't leave. What's with restaurants not telling it like it is with wait times? So annoying, especially in the heat. \n\nAnyway, so we're finally seated in the only area that can hold us, and we're totally cramped. But we're a close family, so lucky for us! Our server was really great with filling our orders and accommodating our needs. Like I said, he totally made up for our outrageous wait with good service...and what was at first a hectic, stressful evening, turned out to be an entertaining one. \n\nOf course I'll come back to Oregano's time and time again..there is that something that constantly draws us back.", "business_id": "ML1RJdeZ7bbfMrHvJ7m99A", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-07-15", "type": "review"}

We love eating here and we've got it down to a science.  Here's your gameplan for a fantastic Oregano's experience in under 90 minutes.  Print it out and take it with you (yes, you can laminate it if you want).\n\nINSIDER'S GUIDE TO OREGANO'S:\n\n1) Make plans for dinner (lunch is an impossibility unless you have two-hour lunch breaks ... you lucky dog).\n\n2) Get some fun friends together (Oregano's is great in groups of about six - keeps all seating options open)\n\n3) Grab a deck of cards or two (you'll see)\n\n4) Get the whole group to show up at 6 (they won't put your name on the list unless you're all there)\n\n5) Hang out and talk or play cards with your friends for forty minutes or so (now you see why they need to be FUN friends)\n\n6) About 20 minutes before your scheduled seating, order two things: DEEP DISH PIZZA and GUACA-TONY.  These both take a while but the waitstaff will put the order in and have it cook while you wait.\n\n7) After you get seated and get drinks, put in any SALAD OR ENTREE orders.  As you do, the guaca-tony will show up right on cue.  Your friends will admire both your foresight and your appetizer selection.  It's an amazing Italian guacamole with a thin-crust pizza for dipping.  Unforgettable, as Old Blue-eyes would say.\n\n8) The guaca-tony will be mostly gone in a hurry, so have the obligatory \"no, you take the last slice\" discussion, and reluctantly gobble down the rest of it (way to take one for the team, champ).  Just as the pan is cleared, here comes the pizza and other entrees.  Perfect!  But don't let that waiter escape - order your PIZZOOKIES now! (ideally chocolate chip, but I won't judge if you go for peanut butter or white chocolate macadamia nut).\n\n9) Devour the pizza.  Their deep dish is so very good.  It's extremely filling, so it's best to calculate about 1-2 slices per person.  Don't worry, it's tasty reheated.\n\n10) Just when you decide you can't eat another bite, the pizzookies show up ... and, well, you might as well have a little.  Generous scoops of vanilla ice cream on top of a half-baked cookie in a pizza pan, and drizzed with chocolate syrup.  The best.\n\n11) Grab the check.  Your friends will think you are very generous, but it turns out eating at Oregano's is really affordable in groups, since you split most things.  Without alcohol, it usually works out to about $10 per person, including tax and tip.  Of course, you can just ask everyone for the 10 bucks or, if you're feeling unscrupulous, ask them all for 15 bucks.  For the awesome meal they just had, they'll probably pay it!", "business_id": "ML1RJdeZ7bbfMrHvJ7m99A", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-08-27", "type": "review"}

We got a Hawaiian and a simple peperoni. Both were tasty, not out of this world, but good. The Cesar was very good, love the dressing. \n\nWe also had a cocktail while we waited for our order. It was a little difficult to get a drink, the bar was packed so we flagged down a waitress to take our order, took a few minutes, but finally we got our drinks. I got a Bellini, looked amazing! tasted good too, but it was strong so I couldn't finish it, as our food arrived a few moments later. \n\nIn the past I remember them having great salads and very yummy aps, like the BOMB dip and cheese bread, a few walked by us and I seriously regretted not order them to go as well. \n\nA few tips, if you are going for dinner get there with time to spare and have a cocktail on the patio while you wait for your table, they pretty much always have a wait, but the misting system out there is nice. Also, the cookie dessert is amaze-ballz! Get one for sure!

I mean it, silly.  We ordered a pizza and the waiter immediately asked us if we knew it was at least 45 minutes for a thin crust and an hour for a deep dish?  Huh?  What in the name of God takes that long to assemble a pizza?  I can *almost* understand the long wait on a deep dish simply because of the cooking time, almost.  But 45 minutes for a thin crust (we're talking a crust so thin it's almost like a huge circular Saltine cracker) is friggen ridiculous.  Sorry, Oregano's, but that is just too long.\n\nSo rant about the ridiculous wait time aside, the food here is actually pretty good, and they can make a side of calamari like nobody's business.  It's delicious.  My toddler and I mowed through a serving of calamari and had enough to take home to snack on the next night.  I also had a mojito and it was very good, crisp, refreshing and yummy.  And as far as the pizza goes it was very good, and my husband throughly enjoyed it.  It was just the right amount of cheese and the crust was perfect.  Good pizza, awful wait.   \n\nLike my last sit-down dining experience this waiter also somehow managed to completely ignore the presense of my toddler and I finally had to ask him to get us a cup of water for her.  Rant Alert!  I seriously do NOT understand why wait staff ignore the babies and small children of paying patrons.  Yes, it's true that my two year old won't be tipping you, or placing a food order, or even mentioning her experience on Yelp, but her mommy sure as hell will, so at least acknowledge that when you take drink orders every living, breathing human being at the table probably needs their own beverage and may need to order their own food too. \n\nKnowing the wait on the pizza I got clever and called over our waiter and asked him to put in an order for a pizzokie (sp?) for us, to go.  I explained that I couldn't make my toddler behave much longer and he graciously told me that he didn't mind noisy babies, which was great, except I bet all the patrons around us WOULD mind it if my daughter decided she was done being nice and was ready to start banging the salt shaker on the table while bellowing out 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star' at the stop of her tiny lungs.  ;)  So after some puzzlement at my (apparently odd) request to take dessert to go he finally got it sorted out and we were able to pay and leave with our delicious dessert before the impending meltdown.\n\nSo all in all this was a nice visit, but that wait time on the pizza needs to be shortened.

We had the hot wings ('of fire'), and they were a little weird tasting but certainly hot, the stuffed rigatoni (tasty pasta with even tastier garlic bread), and the chicken Caesar salad, which is, by far, my favorite item at Oregano's. The chicken Caesar is so good because the chicken is spicy and delicious...that's it. This is a must order. Will I be at Oregano's again?

I have never had an issue finding parking, and since I do not mind the heat, I have never had to wait to get a seat (ample patio seating - if you do not mind friendly pigeons). The pastas and salads have been consistently tasty. For starters, I recommend a small Simple House Salad - it is plenty to split between two people.\n\nLast night the Wings of Fire (medium) were not up to par. Previous orders of the wings have been outstanding, but last night was quite a disappointment. The sauce seemed different (runnier), the wings were small, and there was a rubbery texture on a few of them. I am hoping that it was just an off night for the quality of the wings and will be trying them one more time. Also, if you are a fan of the taste of calamari and traditional preparation of it, do not order the Bistro Calamari. The fried coating was way too thick and took away from the texture and taste of the calamari. \n\nBack to the positives! The Brussels Sprouts are delicious (note that they take about 20 minutes to cook). Both the Alfredo the Dark and the Big Rig Pasta (with meatballs) are delightful. They have a slight spice to them and the pasta is cooked perfectly (to my standards at least). The bread that accompanies the pastas adds a nice touch to the meal. \n\nIf you have room, I suggest ending your meal with The Original Pizza Cookie - Chocolate Chip! My only complaint is that there is not an option of regular peanut butter flavor. Ask for a refill of your beverage in a to-go cup, it is refreshing for the drive home.\n\nOf course I suggest trying Oregano's! :)", "business_id": "ML1RJdeZ7bbfMrHvJ7m99A", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-06-16", "type": "review"}

I lost my appetite after that and I didn't ask for the manager but jukes had him come out he did apologize for it and said he was embarrassed and because of the service I give them 3 stars .

Mr. T is Japanese & I lived in Japan for @4 years, so take my word it's authentic.\n\nThe mix of foods is not so strange if you're familiar with restaurants in Japan. The ramen is Hakata style, made with a pork broth & may be heavy/oily for some people, so why not please everybody? Be sure to ask for \"Cha Shu Ramen\" to get a few more pieces of pork. (extra $)\n\nThe salads are also fantastic; warm lightly fried (10?)Shrimp on a fresh spring mix base with mango dressing,  Shanghai Duck salad, and the Chicken Caesar was perfect, not heavily dressed like some \"roadhouses.\" \n\nMr. T & our daughter loved the Eggplant in Miso Sauce, & even the California Roll was good.\n\nIt's said Japan took the best of each country's cuisine. So there are French pastries, German beer, Italian pasta, and Indian curries. Save the banana bread for dessert if you can, or get one of their pastries. I've never have enough room.\n\nIf you like good WHITE bread, buy one of the Pullman loaves on the table by the front door. My first extra 20 pounds in Japan came from the good bread!

The noodle dishes here are eight or nine dollars and have huge portions.  I ordered the haruki yakisoba noodle stirfry with pork and shrimp - which came to me in a large bowl and steaming with soy and ginger flavors.  The Korean spicy noodle bowl also outdid itself with sliced beef strips and a wonderfully hot hot hot taste.  If that's not your thang, they have rice bowls, sushi, salads, about 20 Italian/Med dishes and several vegetarian and tofu dishes.\n\nYou'll find that they have an open kitchen so if you're close to it you can spy and  salivate over everyone else's food.  The servers were all very prompt and courteous after a slow start.  A solo diner next to us was raving about the place and how much he loves it. \n\nMy favorite part of the food was definitely the complimentary cinammon bread crisps and bread basket that came with BANANA BREAD?!?  Wtf, whew, that came out of left field.  An awesome and delicious surprise that was.\n\nThey had a small wine list that was half off for that night -- as a nightly special.  Did you hear that?  HALF OFF!!  All the sudden that $30 bottle of pinot looked pretty damn good.  So for $15 we had four glasses of wine on the cheap.  The owners know the one way to my heart -- wine specials!!  Yes, it's official.  I'm easy.\n\nWhen I got the tab did I realize that dinner here (with the wine) was CHEAPER than breakfast earlier that day at Orange Table.

I have never seen a restaurant that is so eclectic... you have traditional noodle dishes, both hot and cold, from Japan, along with Sushi; pasta dishes from Italy, and some items from SouthEast Asia! There is more than enough diversity in their menu to satisfy the most discriminating palate. Despite their diversity, CherryBlossom Noodle Cafe does not stray from the basic tenant of Japanese Cuisine: food items are never too salty or too sweet, and are never bland; you can call it cooking subtlety.\n\nFor starters I ordered a California Summer Roll (Vietnamese) for my friend and myself. Unlike the Vietnamese Summer Roll spiced with mint, and usually accompanied by a lime dipping sauce; CherryBlossom's version was accompanied by a sauce comprised of sweet Sesame Seed / Soy Sauce dip. A Summer Roll contents include Shrimp, Rice Vermicelli, Crab strips, and Cabbage wrapped with a thin Rice Paper \"tortilla\". Anyone used to the Vietnamese version will see CherryBlossom's as probably a little bland... but you have to remember the philosophy behind Japanese cooking.\n\nMy friend also had Miso Soup with his meal. Unlike the soup yesterday evening, he said the Miso Soup was very good.\n\nWith every meal, you will also receive a bread basket ( http://cherryblossom-az.com/cherry-bread.gif ). The basket contains three types of breads: a soft and warm French Roll; a slice from a dark and sweet Blueberry bread; and a crispy Butter Biscuit. There is enough variety in texture from all the breads to satisfy anyone.\n\nMain dishes...\n\nI ordered for my friend Grilled Orange Roughy. The Orange Roughy was grilled to perfection and was accompanied by a sweet and salty dipping sauce concoction. Sides consisted of Japanese sticky rice.\n\nI ordered for myself the Beef Nanban Soup with thin Soba (Wheat) Noodles, rather than the Udon Noodles, accompanied by a bowl of Japanese Sticky Rice. \n\nMy friend does not drink, but I ordered the Rasperry Fruit Punch, a very good drink made from Raspberry Wine with Fruit Punch... essentially a Raspberry Wine Cooler (but stronger). This drink also had an umbrella \"thing\" spearing a whole strawberry! Very good and refreshing!\n\nI had my usual coffee after the meal which surprised me a little... an Amaretto laced coffee was brought out. The aroma was very enticing! Would make a coffee drinker out of anyone!\n\n100% of capacity, with 30% Asian; 20% Hispanic; rest Caucasian. First time I've been to a restaurant that was packed with NO seats left! A very popular spot!\n\nCherryBlossom is very heartily recommended so long as you remember the tenets of Japanese Cuisine... no extreme flavors... nothing will be extremely spicy, salty or sweet. This makes it easy to grab a little from this dish, and something from that dish without disrupting the flavor of either.\n\nThere was something that was a little disconcerting, though... The state of the men's room. For such a highly rated establishment, it seemed like no one had checked on the men's room for about two to three hours... toilet paper thrown around, stains around the wash basin. Nothing really objectionable, but a little surprising considering the number of staff for such a small establishment. This establishment has to be aware that a restaurant is judged by it's back-room as well as it's front room. Won't take anything off... but it is highly noticeable considering...\n\nAnd the diners of CherryBlossom has to share the same restrooms with Tokyo Express (right next door), both of the businesses are probably owned by the same management group. \n\nThe interesting tidbit is that we both spent MORE for a worse meal last night at Bamboo House... AMAZING! My friend said his dishes from the Summer Roll to the Grilled Fish was some of the freshest tasting dishes he ever had; good compliment from him. In fact, he wanted to go back to CherryBlossom the next evening... but this is my last night here in the Phoenix area.... sigh....\n\n(I really think everyone is reviewing CherryBlossom under the wrong spelling.... It's CherryBlossom, not \"Cherry Blossom\". Take a look at their sign or their website.)", "business_id": "AkOruz5CrCxUmXe1p_WoRg", "stars": 5, "date": "2007-08-15", "type": "review"}

I would have preferred, buttery or white wine or other flavors, but there were only green scallions to fight for dominance. The clams were ok, but some were gritty. I ordered a spicy salmon roll and that was very good. I liked the roe on the outside of the roll and the roll stayed intact as I brought it to my mouth. My partner got the Ahi with glaze and it was prepared perfectly, although the glaze was heavy handed. The tea was nice. My Raspberry Spritzer had a flavor I couldn't determine and I didn't like it as much as I thought I would. I actually added water to it, to soften the flavor and that's not something I've done often anywhere. The dessert case didn't have all the selections, but from my partners perspective the cheesecake looked nice, but when it was delivered it looked like the flan selection. oops.

We shared a dessert despite saying we wouldn't try one again. I got a pineapple cooler despite saying I wasn't going to try the drinks again. Listening to myself next time on both desserts and drinks. Promise.\nFood: The Penne Marinara was not spicy, but it was good said the daughter. It was $7 and the serving was plenty. She was ok with it. She lamented that we didn't pick Pizza a Metro again. I think I may have spoiled my ability to grab just any old pasta to suit her after eating there.\nMy Nagasaki Udon had some good flavors, but there was a bit of burnt in it, sort of what happens some times at Panda Express with their noodles, but it was nice to have calamari and the shrimps. I added my sushi soy/wasabi sauce to it and the red pickled things from my partners curry dish and that livened it up. The sauce consistency was a bit ew at the end, so I didn't finish.

We grabbed two sushi rolls for appetizer, one crunchy roll and a spicy yellow-tail. Both were fine, but again \"Spicy\" wasn't there. I think this place hedges itself on spice and for those that seek it, may feel disappointed.

The left or right side of the road?\"\n\"I unno\"\n\"What do you MEAN you don't know?

Soon we were parked infront of a soon to be Domino's Pizza and headed to the cafe of my lil yelp dreams... Only to be met with a 20 minute wait. We were then outside and I was left to fight off the queens who seriously considered going to Tokyo express instead! And then FINALLY our names were called and we were seated.\n\nOur waitress was very nice. I want to say that it's the little touches that make CBNC great. The fresh  thick lemon wedge and fresh sprig of mint in the water pitchers. The way the servers are so friendly. She even complimented on my Japanese pronunciation! :) I didn't want to tell her the origin of my great accent...  watching Kill Bill a thousand times. \n\nShe helped us order sushi. I wanted nigiri and they didn't have it. I was disappointed but still went with her suggested crispy rolls and alaskan rolls. They were AMAZING! I loved the crunch and the flavor. With the soy sauce was scrumptious. We wanted to cancel our orders and just get more sushi! The alaskan was great as well. I loved it. Even the queen who never had sushi before liked it. \n\nAfter devouring the sushi our food came. I ordered the beef soba noodle soup with tempura. It came with chicken instead. (boo!) but the tempura was perfect! (yay!) and I never had soba noodles, I usually get udon or chinese noodles. but I really liked the flavor and the fresh spniach that was wilting more and more as time went on. The slight flavor of the sliced green onions really made the dish something special. I loved it. I am just so sad that I couldn't finish it all! :(\n\nOne queen devoured the beef yakisoba noodles at once! I was able to sneak my chopsticks inbetween his bites and I got a taste. it was CRAZY yummy! each of the veggies had a great difinitive flavor and yet melded together amazingly. I loved it. \n\nThe other queen was pleasantly surprised at the taste of his Spicy beef rice plate. He couldn't finish his eaither but it was really. A lil too spicy for my tastes, but it was still awesome. \n\nWe then ordered a bottle of wine and a sip here and a sip there and we were all in heaven! Talking to our waitress about the Navajo sushi chef behind the sushi bar who she was trying to hook up with one of us... but we couldn't tell WHO she was trying to hook him up with! One of the queens or me?! Said chef never made it to our table - and it's just as well... we were in food heaven savoring our delights and wishing we had bigger stomachs to take it all in!

Initially, I was impressed at the management of a huge table (we had like 20 people) and the waitress had no problem doing separate checks and was quick upon return with the checks and change.  Yet when I went with just another person, although crowded, the service was not that great. \n\nThe one thing that was odd - some food came out fairly quickly, yet others' orders took forever.  Some of my friends waited about 20 minutes after everyone else received their dishes, and it's not like they ordered something totally different. In fact, some of the orders were identical to the other friends. Then again, we did have 20 people.  During the time I was just with another person, it was a similar thing - my food came out way earlier than my friend's. \n\nI ordered the summer rolls that were quite tasty, and the prices were very reasonable. I ordered miso soup and edamame which were both delicious. My mom ordered the pad Thai and loved it. I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of food one could order for a decent price.  \n\nThe parking could likely get to be a problem. I managed to find a spot, but during busier hours with the other surrounding businesses, I imagine it would be messy.

I'd forgotten about my one glorious trip to the Noodle Cafe until tonight, so it got my vote. (The Noodle Cafe is not forgettable - it's just that we're always trying new places so sometimes we forget to go back to places we love.)  \n\nJust like last time there were people waiting outside and we were told it'd be 20 minutes before we got a table.  It was really only about 15, but the food is SO worth the wait.\n\nTonight we ordered 3 sushi rolls: the crispy California, double crispy shrimp and the caterpillar roll.  All were super tasty! I love that they roll some of their rolls (the \"crispy\" ones) in panko crumbs - you seriously have to try one.  I think we may have ordered the same rolls last time because they're just that good! \n\nLast time we went I enjoyed the Spicy Korean Beef dish SO MUCH that it was really difficult for me to try something new this time.  I made a last minute decision to try the TanTan-Men Ramen dish which is a \"Sichuan Style Very Spicy Noodle Soup with Minced Pork.\"  I was worried about the \"very spicy\" part only because I'm not usually that tough when it comes to Asian spices.  However, since the Spicy Korean Beef had been that perfect amount of spicy - the kind that makes your lips numb but isn't painful - I decided to be brave.  I am not kidding you - this is the best Asian dish I've ever eaten!!!  Don't get me wrong, kids - it's SPICY.  My lips were numb, my tongue was tingly and my nose got a little runny.  At one point I may have told The Boy my stomach was on fire.  But I loved every minute of it!  And the best part is they gave me an enormous bowl full - so I had plenty to take home for a second round of yumminess!\n\nThe Boy has ordered the Pad Thai and Hakata Ramen - both tasty, but neither as tasty as my dishes! :) :)\n\nIn short - HA too late - DEFINITELY try  CherryBlossom Noodle Cafe.

I have eaten here many times in the past and have always liked the food (especially the Thai Beef Salad) and the price.Today I realized I had not been in a few years so I took an out of town friend here who loves ethnic food. I made the mistake to do a weekday lunch during normal lunch time. I think that  might have been the first time I did that and probably my last. (live and learn I guess)\n   The food was just OK, not great, not bad. They usually have unique and wonderfully tasty desserts but the carrot cake was just average. Maybe they had run out of their cool tarts and ethic fun treats. In the past they had always given out their wonderfully delicious banana bread free with their bread baskets( worth the trip alone) but not today. I did get their little cinnamon toasts though. YEAH!) My Chicken Slaw Salad was fine, good, but again not great. So I guess I am not sure if they have changed the way they do things or maybe it was just an off day. I just wasn't as wowed as I used to be and the place was ridiculously packed. \n   The thing that always gets to me in an annoying way here is how surprisingly bad the service is. It has always been terrible and continues to be so. Sad. I waited ten minutes to even be acknowledged when I walked through the door. The food service wasn't great either. They have always needed more help so it confused me when they expanded several years back. I see they still don't get it. If you are a busy, popular establishment please staff accordingly.  \n   If you want to try dining here there are still some positives. I would just go off hours and somehow get them to give you a slice of their Banana Bread. lol!

Our waiter kept telling us he'd be back in 2 minutes but eventually we had to flag down a different waiter just to take our order. On the flipside, he gave our table comp. adamame and eel sauce, no charge to make up for our wait. We received our food promptly after that. I was impressed with how much you get on the Bento Box. The salad had like an ounce of dressing on it so that wasn't all the great. The rice stuck together and the steak had a little bit too much fat still on it. The sushi was great and I liked the soup too. The best part was the eel sauce everthing could be dipped in.\n\nI was so pretty bummed at the service, but I understood it was the lunchtime rush and the place was filled. Probably won't be going back soon though.", "business_id": "AkOruz5CrCxUmXe1p_WoRg", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-08-10", "type": "review"}

There are few noodle dishes out there that can satisfy the palate as well as a solid bowl of ramen. The key to good ramen is the excelling of three primary ingredients: the noodles, the broth, and the protein. \n\nThe noodles here are very well made with good consistency, texture, and fantastic compatibility with the broth. The broth itself has that signature creaminess, saltiness, and thickened smoothness that ramen broth should have. It gives the noodles a fine delicious dressing.\n\nAlas, the cha-shu pork is where the dish fails to amaze. While the BBQ flavor of the pork is adequate, CherryBlossom chooses to go the lean route in the preparation. The result is a piece of pork that is thick and devoid of fat. This flaw is a fatal one. Ramen noodles were designed in such a way that its fullest potential can only be achieved with fatty pieces of meat. In a true ramen dish, one seeks out the fatty piece of meat and treasures every bite as it enhances the richness of the broth and is counterbalanced by the starchiness of the noodles. CherryBlossom foregoes this authentic vision and opts for a healthier alternative. While it still delivers on most fronts, my inner samurai still desires that extra reach of flavor.\n\nOther reviews on Yelp also recommend their banana bread. However, I must condemn their banana bread and anybody else on Yelp who sponsors it. Their banana bread is incredibly dry and has a grainy texture quality to it. The flavor itself is very bland and the banana element is barely detectable. A shame.\n\nHowever, the dinner rolls that do come with your meal are quite good! They have a softness and fluffiness about them that nearly rivals Hawaiian rolls. Freshly baked and packed with flavor. An unexpected surprise!\n\nAt the end of the day, the entire experience was pretty good but far from great. CherryBlossom offers an eclectic mix of different cuisines and dishes. Though the ramen could not satiate, I am willing to return to test the other dishes. To be continued...", "business_id": "AkOruz5CrCxUmXe1p_WoRg", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-06-30", "type": "review"}

My husband decided he would give it a shot one night, and it turns out that their Italian dishes are equally as good as their Asian dishes. \n\nHere are my favorites:\n- Hakata Ramen: a flavorful Ramen, with coconut milk and pork, one of the few places that offers Ramen in Phoenix, and also one of the best!\n\n- Pad Thai: This is pretty authentic, the sauce had great flavor and the portion is generous\n\n- Rei-Shabu: slices of rare beef, with noodles, and a flavorful sesame dressing, perfect for a hot day\n\n- Bolognese: This sauce is homemade and very flavorful with lots of meat\n\n- Chicken marsala: Not very traditional as it's more of a cream sauce, but it still tastes great, is full of flavor, and the spinach noodles add a nice touch\n\nThey offer reasonably priced lunch specials and sushi too. My only complaint is that the service can be a little slow, so don't come here if you're in a rush. However, they're always very friendly and nice.

We walked in at 8, two hours before close, and one hostess was hunched over the counter doodling.

She grabbed two menus and motioned for us to sit down at the closest table, which happened to be sandwiched in the corner of two other populated tables.

Skip the tantan-men, which is billed as a spicy soup and tastes like little more than that:  spice in soup.  As for rice dishes, the katsu is decent, but avoid most of the appetizers:  shrimp shumai were mushy and flavorless, the Korean spicy rib lacked the spice, richness, and tenderness you'd want from a dish with that title, and the gyoza are less than noteworthy.\n\nThe lunch special is another great reason to come here:  for under $10, you can get a filling combination, like your choice of noodle soup with inari or a California roll.  Although the sushi isn't a reason to visit Cherryblossom and the California roll isn't something I'd jump at ordering even at my favorite sushi joint, it's a great deal.  And when you're really there for the noodles anyway, how can you beat that?", "business_id": "AkOruz5CrCxUmXe1p_WoRg", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-08-04", "type": "review"}

I've had the smoked salmon ramen and the udon stir fry. Neither were very good. Ramen was too salty and the udon was bland.

The little scallop pasta appetizer was pretty good, and so is the bread they served complimentary when you are there at dinner (not happy hour). The sushi is about par with the grocery stores. Desserts look good in the dessert case, but I've never tried any. My biggest gripe is the terribly slow service! I've been there twice. Once on a Saturday around 3:30pm, once on a Friday night at 5:30pm. Both times, it took over 40-45 minutes to get our food. The last time I went, which will also be the last time I go, we waited close to 45 minutes and when I inquired with a waiter, he threw his hands up and in a joking tone,and said \"it's happy hour, there's always a wait.\" He didn't bother to check on the status of our food. His attitude was, \"Hey, we've got more business than we can handle...suck it up!\"  If you have time to wait for mediocre food -- be my guest!", "business_id": "AkOruz5CrCxUmXe1p_WoRg", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-08-05", "type": "review"}

That said, there's a few things that have been amiss at this place pretty much every time I come here.  The food has been average at best and the atmosphere isn't quite my thing.  Tonight exemplified this feeling for me during a dinner with family members.\n\nFor starters, this restaurant has been around forever.  Even many of the staff members have been here forever (our waiter had worked there for decades).  Between the long time staff and the decor, the feeling of this place is old school all the way.  It has some of the feel of an old school italian restaurant, though not so fancy that you have to be super dressy here.  In fact much of the clientele here is quite casual.  The customer crowd here has also typically been much older as I suspect many of their customers have been coming here for years.  I rarely see anyone younger than their forties or fifties in there, so interpret that however you want.\n\nThe food is old school classic italian from the pastas, the seafood dishes, the chicken and veal plates, and the steaks.  Tonight I went with the chicken francese.  Essentially a breaded chicken covered in a lemon butter sauce and topped with mushrooms.  First off, I'm not a mushroom guy so thats my fault.  But the chicken and breaded tasted pretty bland even with the sauce (which was way more butter than lemon by the way).  It was edible, but not that great.  I've had similar experiences with a couple of their pasta and veal dishes as well.  Each dish gets soup and a salad to start.  As usual both were okay, but again nothing special.  The prices are actually pretty reasonable so even if the flavors don't impress you, you can count on leaving full.\n\nIt may well be that I'm not the target audience of this restaurant.  Its an old school restaurant with old school grub, so maybe they're just looking to appeal to the old school crowd.  I'm not opposed to old world recipes as long as they're done well.  From my multiple visits here I find their cuisine adequate, but not much better than that.  There's plenty of italian joints in the Phoenix area.

When it came time to escape Ohio, initially with a very good friend who wanted to move to Tucson to acclimate us to city life (I was raised in a village of 500+- people, including the rural setting of my parents) and within five years move to Phoenix, just so we didn't suffer culture shock. Remember, I'd only been in Phx for 3 days up to that point in my life, with neither friend nor family binding me to Arizona. However, he decided the week before our departure date that he wasn't ready to move so far away from family. I, however, had turned in my month's notice to both my full-time job as a journalist and part-time job at Wal-Mart (don't judge me! The employee discount was worth it) so had to make a decision: Tucson or Phoenix. It was during the final minutes, literally, that I mapped out my trip to Phoenix. See, my dad's a truck driver and I have some of his ability to navigate through cities and states using this amazing invention called an atlas. Thanks to Grandma O'Neill, I had such a magical device in my possession, and wrote out in a matter of minutes the best route to drive my Kia Sportage and U-haul trailer from Northwest Ohio to Central Arizona, avoiding toll roads and steep inclines. Unfortunately, I had to drive through the panhandle of Texas, where I almost decided I'd had enough and was going to return to Ohio. But, I drove on. And on, and on... \n\nWhat this has to do with Pizza Heaven is simply background information. After 2.5 days of driving and sleeping in a truck stop one night, I was ready to settle in and have a filling meal. A pizza, actually. And something that would inaugurate my coming to a new home: Mexican Pizza. Refried bean and cheese and green onions...it's a shame I couldn't find it on their menu after returning a year later. But, PH managed to offer specialty pizzas that filled that void (almost :( ) and has been a stand-by for several events at a friend's house. [My friend's house is outside their delivery range and we gladly pay the extra fee, which says a lot.] \n\nAlthough I've only eaten inside the restaurant twice, and must agree that service tended to be on the slower side, this did allow our groups to mingle more and enjoy the pizza and wine at our leisure. \n\nThanks for the memories, Pizza Heaven. You've remained solid in my heart since the day I drove into town and stayed at the only hotel on the only street I could recall in this wonderful City.

My first experience was not so good. I called in my order and the lady who answered was a bit rude. My food was supposed to be ready in about a 1/2 hr but that was not the case. One of the guys gave me and my brother-in-law a piece of pizza to sample since we were waiting so long. Apparently there was some confusion about my order being pick up or delivery. An hr after I called in the order, my food magically appeared. It was sitting on top of the oven. I was angry. But when I bit into the vegan delight, all my anger subsided. The BEST vegan sausage and vegan cheese I have ever tasted. \n\nMy husband and I fell in love w the vegan menu and I'm embarrassed to say we went there 4xs in one week. It is that good!!! We picked up the same pizza 2 nights later and then dined in and our waiter was phenomenal. Not like the lady who answers the phones. The vegan starter w veggies and bread was so Delish. I think it was called the Mediterranean Medley. The next time my husband picked up vegan sandwiches and the veggie ball sandwich was out of this world!!! Food is fantastic!!!! Now if they could just give the phone answerer an attitude adjustment, this place would be perfect!!!", "business_id": "auorqdHiATGZHVd-sd79ZQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-08-24", "type": "review"}

Secondly, the spaghetti & meatballs was bland - I had to add my own salt, and the meatballs tasted like they were frozen and not handmade, they were watery on the inside.   Lastly, the Vegan pizza was horrific! I didn't even finish one slice!  The sauce was bland, the dough was tasteless and the slices could barely be pulled apart.  The veggies ontop didn't have muchtaste either and I definitely bit into something bitter.   They threw old wilted basil all over it and it wasn't even fresh green basil - it was gray.  And anyone that know anything about cooking knows once basil loses its color and then gets cooked it will taste bitter.  I feel like I wasted the $30+ that I spent on the meal.

We get there and there are only about six people in the restaurant. Our waiter is attentive at first but things slowly grew worse and worse. This was one of the worst experiences I've ever had at a restaurant. I ordered the veggieball parmigiana , now here's the tricky part apparently. All I asked for was actual cheese and not vegan cheese. I wanted the  whole sandwich to be meat free and just have non vegan cheese. Simple enough right? Wrong, I thought the server's head was about to pop off. He simply could not grasp this simple order, the sandwich comes with a side so I ordered the salad. So time goes on and he brings out my order, ya not so much. He brings out veggieballs I will give him that, but it's an appetizer not the sandwich I ordered. So he takes it back and brings out my salad. Then he proceeds to bring out my actual sandwich with a side of fries. I didn't ask for fries I asked for the salad side. So now I'll be charged for a salad and fries. I'm with my boyfriend, who is not a vegetarian, and the server says that his order will be out in thirty seconds. TEN minutes go by and my food is getting cold because I would like to eat at the same time as my boyfriend. The server finally comes over and says it's going to be a little while because they made two veggie sandwiches. Why did they do this?! My boyfriend ordered a sausage sandwich! So now that's two food orders they have to throw out because the server is incompetent. Enough was enough. I gulped down my wine and asked for the check. I paid for my salad and my wine because that's all I ate. Nothing was comped and I spent ten bucks on a wilted salad and a glass of wine. Grossly inadequate and unacceptable.

Well, it depends on who you ask to a certain extent. \n\nMy unbiased opinion of what makes this the perfect sandwich, starts with in house, slow cooked, thinly sliced, Beef, with a blend of Italian spices and it's own natural juices. You add that to the perfect type of roll that is dipped in those juices, a slice of provolone cheese is added to the steaming beef and roll, then top it off with house made giardinara, made of Zucchini, Olives, Serrano Chilies, Carrots, and Olive Oil, and boom....There you have it! Top it off, by pouring a cup of the beef stock over the sandwich before you put your bib on and create a dam of napkins on the table for the inevitable mess that the authentic sandwich is going to create. ;) \n\nNote to those who get all hurt and flustered about the house made giardanara because they use Serrano chilies, they do offer the pickled giardanara as an alternative option as well. So don't shoot them down before you go and give the place a shot. \n\nThe fries are crispy on the outside and like a mashed potato on the inside. \n\nThe Polish, and Brat are real sausage links from their own supplier, not the crappy hotdog like sausages that you get from a hotdog stand on the street of a crappy neighborhood or from a place like Lobby's in Tempe. \n\nThe only thing that sometimes throws off the consistent experience for me, is that at times when I ask for a side of the beef stock, it isn't stirred before they dish it up, and it has a thick layer of oil in the cup, rather than the aqueous layer beneath which contains all of the flavor. This is something that they could take as a constructive criticism at times.\n\nThe only other establishment that serves up a perfected version of this beef sandwich is the owners brother who just opened up Chicago's Taylor Street. He was the best maker of theses sandwiches at Lukes for years, and recently opened up his own spot. It's great to see some competition in this Valley, especially with a couple of brothers competing with eachother. It should help keep the standards high, which should create a good product for us.\n\nTry out both of these spots and write an according review to spark up the competition to the two current greats in the Valley of the Sun.\n\nCheers! :)", "business_id": "Tk2dSL0TwQeI_zNJmb442A", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-07-06", "type": "review"}

I must say that it was very good.  The only reason that I did not give it 5 stars was because of the peppers, and giardinieri.  The meat was excellent, as was the bun.  If I was rating the sandwich strictly based on that I would have give it 5 stars.  The au jus was fantastic as well.  And they dipped it perfectly.  It was soggy like it should be, but I could still pick it up and eat it.  The only issue I had was the peppers and giardinieri.  I get mine with both hot and sweet peppers.  The giardiniera lacked something.  For one thing there was not enough of it on the sandwich so it was missing that spicy kick.  The sweet peppers were not cut up, so it was just one big roasted red and green pepper.  Slicing it up smaller helps when eating the sandwich.\n\nThe only other issue I had was the price.

Definitely the best in Phoenix and quite possibly better than most that I have had while I lived in Chicago too.  The bread is quite delicious.  I'm not a big bread eater, but a little dippy-dip-dip of the sandwich in the au jus and I have to sample the bread a little bit.  See, the Italian Beef is on a very dense bread that can hold up to single, double and triple dips in au jus!  Trust me when I say this, if you don't get your Italian Beef dipped, you're missing out on something special!!!!  I also had the giardiarano peppers on my sandwich.  Those were tasty but with little to no heat.  Not the best I've had.  The star of this sandwich is quite frankly... the beef.  Where's the beef?  Oh, Luke's has got it baby.  The beef on that Italian Beef melts in your mouth real real good while exploding with mellow saltiness and HUGE flavor in your mouth.  OH!  Goodness, I could scream that beefy goodness was just delicious!  The best tasting Italian beef I've had in a long long time.  Better tasting that Port..'s.  \n\nThis place is conveniently located right off the 51 on Indian School.  Very easy to locate.  Look for the sign with the little Chicago Gangster on it and the Pepsi products on the sign (they have 7UP, RC cola, etc).   It is a small place, so I would not say it is good for large groups.  But certainly you can go with a group of 6 or less and should be comfortable, provided they don't have a crowd already there.  The menu has a lot more to choose from, ever heard of a Chicago style hot dog?  Uhm yeah... i've heard Luke's dogs are good too!  They close fairly early, 8pm.\n\nSo, why the 4 star, well, I docked them for the lack luster peppers and the fries.  My good Yelping buddy Anthony P swears by these fries, but the fries were just *aight* for me.  So, I had to dock them for not providing an all around amazing experience.  BUT still... my friend and I are returning this week.... for round 2.  Trust me... That thick giant beefy sandwich is worth it... and my friend likes the polish sausage too.

The place is also small and I don't believe can set 50 people more less 25 comfortably. Now, on to the food;  I've yet to try everything on the menu because I went for one thing only: the Italian beef. While the beef is thinly sliced, something about the seasoning is off.

I'm not sure if Luke is from Chicago or not, but this is not Chicago styled food.  \n\nI just moved to Phoenix from the Windy City in January and I had a hankering for an Italian Beef sandwich.  I started to try out Rosati's which is closer to where I live, but decided I'd yelp first to see what options I had.  Luke's was one of the more popular recommendations.  I stopped by this evening and there was a group of ladies in front of me.  I took a moment to look at the menu, but I already knew what I wanted- mostly just filling the time until the guy at the counter was ready to take my order.  As the girls took to their seats, I was expecting the guy to greet me or ask me what I was having. Not everyone's big on small talk.  I get it.  Welp, the guy walked past me and avoided eye contact, heading into the back.  I waited at the counter, and he came back out within seconds... And walked right past me again.  He was apparently getting some cups for the ladies who were in line before me.  A simple \"I'll be with you in a minute\" would do.  None offered.  So I finally place my order and give the guy my credit card.  He swipes it and sits it on the counter and walks into the back again.  I wasn't sure if he'd actually collected the payment or what, so I left it there.  He comes back out and is shuffling around a bit, finally noticing that my card is still on the counter, then asks me if it's mine.  Then he remembers that I still need to sign off on the receipt.  I get my food, and leave.  Bad service, I'm hoping the food at least makes up for it.  \n\nWhen I get home, I can't wait to dig into my Italian Beef.  Oh boy!  It was dry and the beef tasted like it had been re-cooked.  People, I'm from Chicago.  You can get this quality of Italian Beef from any hole-in-the-wall place in the city.  Thing is, it'll be about $4.  If you want a better quality sandwich, you'll probably go to an Al's beef location and spend about $6.  For $7.20 here, this place is ripping you off.", "business_id": "Tk2dSL0TwQeI_zNJmb442A", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-06-24", "type": "review"}

Still early for lunch.  No one around, see?\nI walk in and the place, it don't look like no sub shop, ya know.  Looks solely like a nice little authentic Italian grocery, you get me?  I like it.  They got everything there, and my eyes are buggin outta my head like *this*, see?\nI mean, I'm lookin' at this quaint package that looks like it could either have a bottle of, emm... a Sangiovese, or maybe even a nice Dolcetto for the lady types.\nAnd, then they got these tins of all kinds of olive oils.  They got these dried salamis and a big thing like *this* of Prosciutto.  There's a nice little case there of homemade pastries that were tasty just by lookin at 'em.  Jars of authentic sauces up the wazzoo!\nI dunno, what am I sayin'?!  GET OUTTA 'ERE!... they ain't got no Safeway stuff here, c'mon!  Hckck!\nI just ain't seen so much authentic Italian stuff.  And the place, you know, it's 'bout as small as one-a those swanky studios downtown, and they got it packed to the chin.  But hey, I digress, look at me!\n\nSo, I looks up at the menu and I sees they got \"Italian Sub\" up there as one of their six or seven sa'mmiches.  It's nice, ya know?  So hey, anyone can claim to make an 'Italian' sub, so I gotta ask to make sure.  I ain't a fool!  Hahaha!... ok, knoggitoff, listen!...\n\nThis guy comes up to the deli case and he looks to be a nice enough gentleman.  He's got his apron on to keep himself proper, a conservative pair of prescription sunglasses that you can still see him look you politely in the eyes like you're family, and the guy even cleans his hands before he's ready to listen to what I gotta say.  Hey, that's class, and respect!  Other places don't know about that.\n\nSo, this is what I asks, I asks this right here... I says, \"What's in the Italian sub?\"\nGuy goes through a quick list with his fingers: \"Three meats, cheese, tomato, lettuce and dressing.\"\nHey!  That's perfect!  You can't get anymore honest than that, and that's the best that I need to know.\nSo, \"Ok\", I says, \"I'll have one\", and he gives me a nod.\n\nSo, this guy gets to putting my sub together, and I see he's just graceful at it, like he's just pulling the elements outta thin air.  Not like those kids over there at Mr. Subways, acting all confused and empty like a clan a-mice with hats on, forced to stand two inches from one another for 8 hours!\n\nI mean, this Niccoli guy's just effortless, putting a little a-this, a little a-that, and - DONE!\n\nI sh*t you not, jerky, it takes this guy no more than 40 seconds to put that thing together!\n\nI ask for a bagga chips, too.  He asks if I might want a drink, but I thank him and pass, since I got one back at work.\nNine bucks and change it costs me.  The size of this thing, though, they aren't faking 'cuz I can see this sub's an honest foot!  And, I can already smell the dressing and salami from it!\n\n\"You have a good day\", he says.\n\"Thanks.  You too\", I reply.\n\nI get back to my desk, and I unwrap this thing, and it's just like the guy said: it's stacked, but not too ridiculous like.  It's holding everything nicely and naturally like.\nI take my first bite, and it feels like... it feels like... I'd been reborn.  This thing is the best sub I've had since... since I been born!\nIt's dripping a little with the purest most wonderful olive oil I ain't tasted before, and that bread roll I tell ya, it's keeping fresh and crisp like it's just meant to be!  I can't believe it!  I had to set the thing down as I was chewing, sit back in my chair and close my eyes, and just... LIVE!  That salami, too!  And, there's provolone and ham!  It's all fresh.  And, there's even some herbs in that dressing that made me feel like an a**hole in heaven.  I ain't never been treated to a sub like that.  THAT'S Italian!\n\nYou gotta get one a-these!\n\nHey, you got some schmootz there on the side-a your mouth from droolin.  Go over there to Niccoli's.

Unfortunately I was going to an event, otherwise I would have purchased a sandwich. However, I did purchase two rolls to make a sandwich later! During check-out, I began chatting with the owner's lovely wife who started giving me kitchen tips. She even gave me a recipe for a summer pasta sauce! She took the time to carefully explain the recipe to me and then wrote it down. I feel like I received a special gift! I've already tried the meal at home and it was just as amazing as she promised it would be!\n\nIf you're in the area and want some delicious Italian products, or you simply want a tasty sandwich, this is your spot!", "business_id": "T5HYqRADhAL6VPRAacz74Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-07-08", "type": "review"}

BEWARE: the Sicilian pizzas are HUGE! If you've got two or three people to feed - the half size is PLENTY!

I ordered Da Works Sicilian and was VERY disappointed - which surprised me because I LOVE THEIR REGULAR STYLE PIZZAS THEY ARE TO DIE FOR! Anyway, the Sicilian is NOT A DEEP DISH - it's extra dough, under cooked and they didn't even have the courtesy to warn me HOW DOG-GONE BIG IT IS!\n\nOtherwise, their regular pizzas are amazing!

You can order at the counter for a grab and go option. I saw quite a few people come in an pick up orders that they called in. They also offer delivery. Of course there's a dine in option as well. They have a small bar where you can sit, as well as indoor and patio seating too. After coming here twice, I've had an overwhelming feeling that the tables inside are in desperate need of reorganization. It feels a bit too spread out in there. \n\nThe service has been good on both occasions that I have gone. Everyone who works in the restaurant seems to be very friendly and welcoming. I've only been on weekdays and both times I think the bartender was also serving as a waitress which made things a bit held up when the restaurant unexpectedly filled up around 8 PM on a Monday night, but the staff handled it well and did their best to make sure everyone was taken care of.\n\nThey have a decent draft list of beers, about 5 options, with one of them being an NYPD custom beer. Some happy hour specials too which included discounted beers and pitchers. \n\nAs for the food - I have tried a few different things. The garlic knots, bruschetta pizza, bruschetta appetizer, and penne ala vodka with sausage and peppers. All of it was very good. The portions on the pasta are BIG!

So after some hemming and hawing, I bullied him into it. The next question, Where do we go? I told him about this recent episode of Triple D and to my amazement he had seen it to and suddenly he was all happy about a birthday dinner. \n\nLike most places nowadays, they don't take reservations. My brother called ahead and was told it should be fine for our time for a table of 8, a Wednesday night mind you. We were seated and take everyone else's word if not mine, the restaurant is small(read:TINY). There are probably 12 tables, max. We were given menus quickly and had our drink orders taken and brought out promptly. The table started with a mixed bruschetta of a traditional tomato and basil and a pesto with tomato. Both were excellent. They have a bunch of other choices as well. We also had the caprese salad, fresh balls of mozzarella, tomatoes, and romaine covered in balsamic vinegar. This too was great. \n\nDinner choices were varied. I had a fettuccine with chicken, green chilies, and sun dried tomato. It had a garlic-wine sauce. Sprinkle on a little red pepper flakes for a little extra heat and you'll be happy. Get the fresh pasta, pay the extra buck, and you'll be one smiling mother#$*&er! Fresh pasta makes a world of difference. I sampled everything at the table. The macaroni and cheese with prosciutto, the ravioli, and the penne with sausage. The regular plain old red pasta sauce they use is great! It had such a nice sweetness to it I could have had a bowl of it.  Get the mac & cheese.  It is baked to perfection!  We aren't talking Kraft mac and cheese here either people.  This has real cheese, not some powder cheese.\n\nWe also indulged in dessert and coffee. The flour-less chocolate cake with vanilla bean gelato was delicious. The cappuccino was great too. I was told the key lime cheesecake was good as well. \n\nThe dining experience was nice. I thought the prices were reasonable and the serving size ample. We spoke with the owner, Richard, for long stretches throughout the meal and he was very personable and answered any questions or gave suggestions on meals. He saw me taking a picture of my food and asked if this was going to be on Yelp! I assured him it would be. He told me I wasn't getting anything free because of it, with a smile and a laugh. Love the NY attitude. \n\nFor those that gave a bad review, I'm sorry, but I just don't get it. NO other Italian restaurants in the valley use fresh pasta, maybe Pasta Brioni.

Skimming the menu, I'd say the average entree is about 12, appetizer is 8, desert is 5.  \n\nSo by the time we got our food we were starving, but we managed to drive home which was about 5 min away.  They gave me a few pieces of bread for my pasta which was very good (and very surprising because bread is on the menu for like $5).  The pasta was overcooked and the sauce was WAAAY salty.  The portion wasn't what I expected for the price I paid at a \"dive\".  The sandwich was a little better, but nothing special.  I work at a hospital and I'd say their chicken parmigian is better.\n\nAll in all, this wasn't the best experience.  I say if they want to charge so much, open an actual restaurant.  Then maybe they can serve some liquor instead of just having pictures of wine bottles everywhere and empty vodka bottles holding flowers.  (Its BYOB, $5 corkage fee).  I'm very disappointed in Food Network.  :\\", "business_id": "VpW40mznMS43CqdbelX2wA", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-06-23", "type": "review"}

I generally do not go out for Italian, but decided to give it a try because my girlfriend and I were a bit burned out on some of our other locals.  Let me just that I was wowed.  Their eggplant parm is fantastic -- thinly sliced, breaded, and served on top of a bed of homemade penne pasta. (All of their pasta is homemade in fact)  Their bread was also very good.  It quickly became one of our favorite regular restaurants.  \n\nI loved their eggplant parm so much that it was difficult to stray away from it and try other items on the menu.  When I finally did though, it was equally delicious.  It was penne and parmesan dish with asparagus and red chili flakes.   I highly recommend it. \nMy girlfriend loves the lasagne.  The pear salad also is very tasty appetizer.\n\nThe waitress Cindi is great.  She always remembers us and treats us likely regular weekly customers even though we only make it over to that neighborhood every couple of months or so.  We really could not ask for more personable service.  The owner is nice as well.\n\nThey now have a lot of pictures up from the Triple D visit, but they were very excited about it.  It was a big deal to them and I don't think that should be a knock against them. (Personally, I did not know who the guy was...old school, no cable)  As for the price and food portions, I think that iGiuseppe's is both fair and filling.  We always leave there filled. (Eat more bread or try the pear salad if you are really hungry) As for the price, most plates are between $10 and $14.  For 2 1/2 people (one four year old), we usually wind up spending between $45 and $55, which includes a healthy tip.  This place is far better than some corporate chain in Old Town (Buca's, Olive Garden, Oregano's, etc) and it is worth the money.", "business_id": "VpW40mznMS43CqdbelX2wA", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-07-03", "type": "review"}

I'd heard of it before, but hadn't ever felt like making the trek out here from Glendale.  On one hand, I'm glad I did.  I've been lucky finding good Italian food places as of late.  It's also nice to know what people are fussing over with places like this, that get noticed after being on tv.  On the other hand, the overall experience I just found lacking.\n\n\nYes, I know it was on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives.  Even though I suspect it falls into the first category, I still think it could have been better.\n\nThere was a wait.  Which only shocked me since it was an off night, so be aware of that.  Reading many of the previous reviews, I had caught that it was BYOB.  So we had run over to the Sprouts next door and grabbed a few bottles.  Surprise!  No more BYOB.  Oh well, wine never really goes to waste.\n\nThe place was cramped, and my party of 5 was squashed into a tiny corner table.  Then, what made that even more exciting, was the roving guitar player that started as we sat down.  As far as ambiance goes, he and his female vocal accompaniment left a bit to be desired.\n\nThe food was good.  If I were to rate solely on that, it's deserving of 3 stars easily.  The eggplant appetizer was thin sliced and breaded, though I would have liked more of the red sauce on it to combat the dryness of the breading.  I can't comment too well on the bruschetta appetizer, as splitting 4 different types 5 ways doesn't allow for a sizable tasting.  The bolognese I had was very tasty, and the inclusion of ox tail to it was a very very good one.\n\nBut in the end, the pretty good food couldn't save me from an overall \"meh\" dining experience.", "business_id": "VpW40mznMS43CqdbelX2wA", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-08-29", "type": "review"}

These should be dinner prices.\n\nThe Ragu came with homemade pasta which was a nice change, but there was barely enough sauce to taste on the pasta. I didn't want it drenched, but I would like to taste the sauce. The sauce was a little dry tasting, which was a bummer. My wife's sub was a good proportion but the bread was really dry and lacking meat. Overall the service was friendly and prompt, but not worth returning.

With time to kill and looking to fill my stomach I asked for a recommendation from a bartender and he sent me to Giuseppe's.\n\nI found a small restaurant in a shopping center.  My guess is this place is packed and stuffy if you go at a peak hour.  I was there before 5pm so only a few of the tables were occupied.\n\nThe waitress was prompt with menus and drinks.  Friendly too.\n\nBolognese Ragu was my dinner selection.  The sound of homemade pasta is sauce and six meats sounded fantastic.  I was given a basked of fresh Italian bread while I awaited my dish.  The bread was fresh and tasty (from a local bakery according to the website).  I am partial to oven fresh bread so I was slightly disappointed at first but, hey, you can't always have it 100% to your taste.\n\nI was very impressed with the ragu.  Granted, I have nothing else to compare it with but I loved it.  \n\nSo, why only 3 stars?  I'd like to give 3.5 but I can't so it gets 3.  The prices were not satisfactory.  The ragu and a can of coke came out to over $21 with tax.  For the price I paid I found the portion a bit small and $3 for a can of Coke is lunacy.  I understand a local restaurant needing to charge more but I think they could shave some of the cost off.  Especially on the pop.  To be honest, the prices will keep me away for a bit.  I'd love to try more of the menu but I can't afford to eat here too often.  One day, though, I will return.

You will have found Nirvana, as have I!\n\nUntil now, I had almost given up hope for what I call \"Old World Italian Food\" prepared with love and the most incredible ingredients available. It is here and being served in a friendly small environment by a knowledgeable and wonderful wait staff.  Not to mention that  the Owner is usually present and generally talks to everyone, making certain that all are satisfied. Now I ask you, is that PRIDE or what?\n\nBased on talking with adjacent Diners, everything on the Menu;  both the \"Today's Menu\" (Changes sometimes daily) and the \"Full Menu,\" seems to be pretty fabulous and receiving \"Rave Reviews\" from my fellow Diners!\n\nLooking at previous Reviews, as well as Guy Fieri's recommendation, I had to have the Bolognese Ragu on my first visit. I have yet to have everything on the menu, but here are the choices I have made on my visits to date and each is NOT to be missed:\n\n        Bolognese Ragu - Don't ask! Just order it. Seven meats and homemade  \n        Pasta that lives up to all of the previous fabulous Reviews! Like so many \n        before me, I am not certain I can eat here ever without having this incredible \n        dish, which leaves little room for anything else. Share with a friend so you can \n        have more of their remarkable dishes.\n\n        Burrata (Appetizer) - Mozzarella like you have never had. Do NOT overlook it \n        if  it is available. The description doesn't do it justice, but it is described as \n        a \"ball of mozzarella filled with shredded mozzarella and cream.\" If you love \n        Mozzarella -this is \"MOZZARELLA MECCA!\" \n\n        Antipasto (Appetizer) - An absolute work of art! Do NOT be fooled by the \n        Menu designation of Small (they also have Large), it is NOT small, but can be \n        shared by two (I refuse to share!)  Incredible morsels of meat, cheese and \n        vegetables, with the proper amount of dressing.\n\n        Pasta e Fagioli (Appetizer) - I have a friend who says you can judge ALL \n        Italian Restaurant by their Pasta e Fagioli. This is a light (meant to be, it's an \n        Appetizer!) flavorful mixture of beans and pasta that is oh so satisfying, with \n        just a hint of spice.\n\n        Spaghetti and our Famous Meatballs - Not to be confused with your Mothers, \n        as she probably could not make this rendition. The meatballs in my sampling \n        were made from Veal with Ricotta and other special ingredients. If spaghetti \n        and meatballs were like this everywhere, we would all be Italian! Hint - you \n        can have the meatballs alone as an appetizer or a side dish.\n\n        Bread and Olive Oil - Nothing remarkable about the bread here, which is a \n        surprise, but it is the Olive Oil (with Giuseppe's label on it) that is the star. No \n        Balsamic needed, just pure goodness with salt and pepper to your own taste. \n        Take a bottle home (I have!) and pair it with your favorite bread.\n\nGiuseppe's has definitely replaced The Restaurant (Now Pizzeria Bianco) as my favorite Phoenix Italian Restaurant. The love, pride and caring that has gone into each and every dish is more than apparent. There is no need to go elsewhere, unless for a diversion you wish to go to Andreoli Italian Grocer for their bread!

I can't think of anything that I was unhappy with, which is why I'm giving this place 5 stars.  I made a reservation for my boyfriend as a surprise birthday dinner last week.  I was a little hesitant planning a birthday dinner at a new restaurant.  What if we didn't like the food or the service was poor?  When we walked in we were immediately greeted by a guy who I'm pretty sure is the owner.  After checking out the menu and FINALLY deciding on a dish (everything sounded great), my boyfriend ordered the seafood risotto and I ordered the rigatoni primavera, a vegetarian dish.  Each dish was served with a salad or soup and they also served fresh bread at every table.  While we were waiting for our food we noticed that the crowd there was much older.  I think we brought the median age down by about 30 years!  I also noticed that the guy who seated us was visiting every table, and chatting with everyone.  It seems like most of the people who were eating there were regulars, and knew all the details about this guys family.  Our salads arrived, and although the portion was small the Italian dressing was delish!  Next came our main dishes.  My boyfriend's plate was packed full of seafood including shrimp, scallops, mussels, and clams.  A bit too fishy for me, but he loved it.  My dish was amazing as well, with lots of flavor and tons of vegetables, including mushrooms, zucchini, and cauliflower.  In past reviews I always mention how it can be difficult to find vegetarian dishes with lots of flavor unless you are at a vegetarian restaurant.  That was not the case here at all, this place delivered.  The portions were big, so my boyfriend and I both ended up with some to take home.  We were both disappointed in knowing we had dinner plans the following night, as we were looking forward to eating our leftovers!  This restaurant was a nice change of pace from our usual loud and crowded old town restaurants.  The place was nice and quiet, with some light music playing in the background.  Overall, it was a great experience, and   I will definitely eat here again.", "business_id": "PAtgWCLCFRQd_fjnihISOg", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-08-27", "type": "review"}

Full disclosure:  we tried four times, each time it was around 8:00 pm. Two of the four we were treated pretty poorly by a female hostess. There were still patrons eating in the restaurant, but she told us they were getting the main dining room set up for a big event the next day (both times) and sat us in the bar. Last night, there was a basketball game on in the bar...I would not mind eating in a pub atmosphere if we were paying pub prices. So, when we told her that the noise was too much and asked to be reseated in the restaurant she refused. I don't think was too much to ask, for just the two of us. And it's interesting the other two times we went, the male hosts gave us the choice, and sat us in the restaurant.  Food has been inconsistent, but not all that bad.  Pasta on two visits was all small pieces (spaghetti one night and fettuccine another) like we were getting the dregs. I'd be more tolerant of that, but for the price of the food, we expect a more pleasant dining experience.   Too bad.

Looking more like a disco studio than today's refined simple modern standard for restaurants, it's a time warp.\n\nAnd all the staff evidentily were there on the opening day in 1970 as well, but that isn't a bad thing.  They have a very defined \"script\" they follow of an old school Itallian restaurant, and do a good job of it.\n\nAfter being scolded for trying to take the napkin to my lap while my wife's was unfolded by the waiter, I decided to go with it.\n\nWe did the $59 4 course prix fixe menu.  Ask for it if it isn't offered.   All the food was good, most of it ranging from excellent to amazing.  \n\nI ordered the ceasar salad, while my wife ordered the caprese salad.  The ceasar salad was excellent, and while dressing was heavy, it was so dang good I ate every last bit of green.  The caprese salad was different than most, with no vinegar, and over a pile of greens that looked like basil but didn't taste the same.  My wife liked it, but prefers vinegar.\n\nNext I had egglant parmesan, which was a nice small portion and very tasty.  It wasn't fried, which was interesting, and had a cream base to it.   Extremely good.\n\nMy wife had the pasta trio, which was outstanding, because it's clearly homemade.  I mean, melt in your mouth pasta.  Not enough to share, but perfect for a pasta course for one.\n\nNext came the entrees.  I had been tipped off that any fish that came with parmesan encrusted, was MUST TRY.  Mark these words.  You will not go wrong with the parmesan encrusted fish, even if you aren't a huge fish fan.\n\nI ordered the Sea Bass, as I generally prefer that to the Paresan encrusted option, Salmon.\n\nMy sea bass was just okay, but the lemon butter sauce with capers and artichokes was outstanding, and so made up for it almost.\n\nBut my wife's salmon was a thing of beauty.  I mean, perhaps the best salmon I've ever had.  And that's saying a lot.  Lemon butter sauce was even better, parmesan was terrific, and I found myself stealing 1/3 of her dish because I couldn't stop myself.  And I NEVER do that.\n\nSo if you take away nothing from this review, if they offer some fish parmesan encrusted, go for it and don't look back.\n\nLastly, was desert.  I had the recommended creme brulee, and my wife had the cannolis.  The canoli was good, maybe very good.  No complaints.  My creme brulee was just okay.  It has less of a custard consistency than I was used to, and had very little burnt sugar top, which is really important for the experience of creme brulee.  Had the requisite blue berries.\n\nSo that was it.  $65 for two, as we only had water since we started a bit early.  Well worth the price, no doubt about it.\n\nSo if you want to go to a restaurant with outstanding food, see a glimpse of what dining ina  1970's restaurant was really like, and be surrounded MOSTLY by people in various stages of retirement, I highly recommend Avanti.\n\nI wish I tried more of their fresh pasta.  If I was going back, I would probably share a pasta dish with my wife, each have the permasan encrusted fish of the day, and skip desert.  \n\nGood luck and here's to making it back out of the 70's time warp!", "business_id": "vvA3fbps4F9nGlAEYKk_sA", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-08-18", "type": "review"}

For entrees I had the tortellini portofino and my husband had the chicken parmigiana. Both were absolutely amazing.  My husband is also obsessed with the meatballs here and orders a side every time we have dinner. \n\nFor dessert, we shared the tiramisu and it was perfect; one of the best I've had. \n\nI also love how old school this place is, they still have handwritten bills, see pic!

That should've been red flag number one. We waited at the entrance for a few moments before we were greeted by whom I guess was the owner. He said he had been expecting us, sat us at our table and disappeared for the remainder of the evening.  Our waiter was odd; he seemed to be in a rush and irritated even though the place was empty. For starters we ordered the pasta trio sampler and the Oyster Rockefeller.  The only thing memorable about the sampler was the gnocchi which was as good as most yelpers mentioned. The Rockefeller may have been the worse I've ever had; the oysters were so tiny I could barely discern them in the heavily creamed spinach. I'm not sure how something so creamy can be so utterly bland and flat. For the entr\u00e9e I had the Salmon which again was drowned in a weird sauce that covered the entire plate. The salmon was moist but the sauce was putrid. It tasted at least 3 days old. The sides were cold oven roasted potatoes which again were covered in that odd sauce. For the finale, I tried the Cr\u00e8me Brulee, again that was a mistake. It was ice cold and had chunks of pineapples in it which is not normal nor was it ever mentioned. The top of the brulee was not properly browned and didn't crack when my spoon hit it. I look forward to cracking my Cr\u00e8me Brulee, darn!

This restaurant was the whole reason I even joined Yelp. It has and will always be my favorite restaurant in the valley. You may not get it, but that's because you probably suck. \n\nFirst off, this place is totally dated. It's dated because that's part of it's charm. This was the place to dine back in the 80's and early 90's. My grandfather only ate at 3 restaurants in the valley back then: Avanti, El Chorro on Lincoln, and Don & Charlie's. He liked being treated well and these places never missed a beat. Of course, times change, but this is why I will always love this restaurant. It has been consistently good my whole life. Also, it should be noted, if you treat your waiters well, they treat you well. Gramps was a big tipper and he got treated very well. When he made a reservation, he made it with the same waiter, for like 20 years. Ok, maybe not that long, but long enough that he saw my mom through two marriages and several relationships. Well, maybe 20 years isn't off the mark? His drink of choice, vodka on the rocks with anchovy stuffed olives, would be sitting at his table waiting by the time we sat down. Not many restaurants can pull that off. \n\nSo yeah, I am probably biased. But I am biased because I have had some great times in this place over the years. To this day, I never order gnocchi anywhere else. It's always a disappointment. \n\nIt's true, though, the vibe isn't the same as it once was. For one, nobody knows how to dine anymore. Dinner used to be an event. You ordered at least two rounds of drinks before you even considered ordering food. How are you supposed to get a buzz on otherwise? Then you would order some apps/starters, then a main course, then dessert and after dinner drinks. This is the kind of place you spent some time in. This is the kind of place that used to require some proper dining etiquette. I don't find this happening much anymore at Avanti. There hasn't even been a need for valet on my visits over the last several years. That's not a bad thing. Just an observation. Times are changing, and people don't have the money to spend on dinner they used to. One thing that hasn't changed, though, is the food. So I will continue to go back, even if I don't have the time to \"dine.\" I will go back, even though it will always have to be without my grandfather. I will go back just to get a sliver of what this place used to be back in the day ... which was, wait for it, legendary.", "business_id": "vvA3fbps4F9nGlAEYKk_sA", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-08-29", "type": "review"}

The food is excellent and the atmosphere reminds me of an old mobster hang out - not the gritty kind you see on B movies. Rather, it is casually posh.\n\nLocated just east of 27th Street on Thomas road, this cozy place is a quiet gem. There is plenty of parking in front of the restaurant. No valet needed, which is a nice perk in Phoenix. When you walk in, the d\u00e9cor is purposefully outdated in black and white art-deco design, mirrored walls and little alcoves where you can sit in semi privacy. It is usually subdued here - no need to shout at your dinner mates. I really like that.\n\nEven better, the food is superb! I've never eaten in Italy, but I imagine this comes very close to Italian perfection. The pasta is so flavourful, I imagine a little old Italian lady, rolling the stuff by hand. Perfection on a plate. My favourite is their gnocchi. Little pillows of heaven, I tell you, and the accompanying sauce is amazing! I even secretly swiped my finger across the plate and licked it clean when no one was looking (don't tell on me!). I've tried several of their entr\u00e9e dishes too and have yet to be disappointed. The double pork chop is cooked to perfection - tender and juicy on the inside, nicely seared on the outside; and served with a delicious risotto that has me wanting to lick my plate again. If you are looking for a hearty pasta dish, I recommend the Pappardelle with the braised beef ragu. \n\nOne of my favourite things about this restaurant is the atmosphere. From the moment you walk in the door, you have the impression of being in an old, Italian family restaurant from the center of Little Italy New York. Fogeddaboutit! Posh enough to take your date to, but not snobby by any means. Our wait staff have always been personable, attentive and casual. Prices are very reasonable, especially considering the quality and quantity of your meal.  We generally spend $20-30 per dish, plus an appetizer and some wine.\n\nOh!
