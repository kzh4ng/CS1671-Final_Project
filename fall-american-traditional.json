After receiving guidance, she brought me to a table towards the back.  It had not yet been cleaned after the previous guests had dined.  So, she quickly got it cleared off, grabbed a rag, and wiped it down.\n\nThe waitress came rather quickly to take my drink order.  She was extremely friendly.

I ordered the Cinnamon Swirl French Toast Special - Three slices of French toast made with Pittsburgh's own Jenny Lee\u00ae Cinnamon Swirl, two farm-fresh eggs, with bacon or sausage (I chose sausage), and your choice of potato (I went with the cheesy hash brown casserole).  I also added an orange juice.  She went and put my order in, while I waited, and came back with it after not too long.   The eggs were cooked exactly how I wanted them, the cheesy hash brown casserole and the french toast were both delicious.

'Rocky' would definitely describe the experiences.\n\nOn the first trip, I went to try their (at that time)raved about Reuben. And YET to find a true good Reuben in da burgh, I tried it.\n\nWell, they were out of the proper bread, and the guy had to run to the store to buy the closest thing he could find, which was not the proper bread, and instead of one of their 'raved about' Reubens, I received two mini-Reubens, which basically took the guts from one Reuben, and spread it out onto two sandwiches on regular sized bread. I ate it. It wasn't great, but they swore it was because they'd run out of the bread. Bread or not, it still wasn't great. The atmosphere was pleasant in that 'blue collar bar' kind of way, and the staff was very nice, but not a winning pitch on the Reuben.\n\nThe second trip was after a long day of moving furniture with the same friend. Sat in the back room, instead of the bar, which felt more like a restaurant, of course, with the big screen TV covering the sports of the moment.\n\nI was in the mood for dinner this time, and after a scan, decided on fried chicken and mashed potatoes with the salad bar. My friend ordered one of her faves, the breaded pork chops.\n\nWe hit the salad bar, which was uber-basic. Three soups (mostly vegetable loaded, which left me out), basic iceberg lettuce mix (very probably out of a bag), a few veggie toppings, and three or four dressings. It was a basic salad, no big deal. More or less an appetizer filler before the meal.\n\nThe mind-blower in this trip was the ordering of the fried chicken dinner. Our waiter looked like a 19 year old gas station attendant, skinny little blonde guy with a sweet but incredibly naive face, and an air of vapidity, which was confirmed when I placed my order. I asked what chicken pieces came in the dinner, and asked if it was possible to only get dark meat. I never imagined how confusing a question that could possibly be. It literally took him two trips back to the kitchen to 'ask', and the child honestly had no clue what 'white meat' and 'dark meat' meant. The first answer he came back with was that the chicken came in a pre-portioned prepared bag, kind of Kentucky Fried Chicken style...which didn't answer my question, thus prompting the second trip. \n\nAfter the second trip back I heard the cook holler 'Tell him I'll fix him up'. \n\nWell, the chicken was prepackaged dreck like you'd find in the freezer case of Walmart, tiny and not good, and the potatoes had that slight tinge of chem-spuds flavor, laden with some kind of chopped up green (parsley?), and a side of that basic brown gravy served up in 5 gallon buckets.\n\nThank goodness for the basic salad bar.\n\nEven my friend admitted that her pork chops were different and not what she'd expected. They also appeared to be from a freezer bag.\n\nThe irony was that the boy who didn't know white meat from dark meat, was chatting with some other customers...about baseball...and he was a genius about the mindless sport of baseball. Ahhhh da burgh.\n\nThird base? Nah...why bother when there are so many other options around. Go on in a grab a beer and chat black and gold if you happen to be in Carnegie...they can help you out all types of ways in that area. Just don't go hungry if you actually have tastebuds.\n\nFrom what I understand it 'used to be' really good homecooked food.

Two different businesses (one a popular watering hole & one a game & entertainment business) were right next door to each other. The two young owners were friends and quickly realized that combining their businesses made perfect sense. So they opened the first combined D & B in  . . . . no, not Little Rock, but Dallas! To this day there are no D & B's in Little Rock. Not sure what is up with that! But lots of other cities have been the beneficiaries of these two friends combining their businesses.\n\nThe one in Pittsburgh is the only one I have ever been to.  When I lived there, a group of friends and co-workers (and me, of course!)used to go there for Happy Hour & Power Hour . . . . at least once a week. We had a blast!  A great place to kick-back and let the worries of the work day melt away.\n\nWonder if they'll ever open one in Marin County, CA? Shucks!  Probably not. Not a Marin County scene, for sure. \n\nWHAT A BLAST IT WAS THOUGH! I miss going to D & B. They have all the classics, like billiards & shuffleboard, plus over 200 interactive & video games. A rechargable Power Card provides an easy way to access all the games.  \n\nPOWER HOUR is game HAPPY HOUR - - an entire hour of classic and video games for just  ten bucks.  \n\nA GREAT BAR, WONDERFUL FOOD AND SERVICE! A RELAXING AND FUN WAY to spend a Friday or Saturday evening. You'll never want to leave.

They immediately set up the table while about 4 of my friends and I waited; the hostess, after taking my name, never spoke to us again. She did not tell us when we could sit, how long it would be, or any other information. And then they made us wait for 75% of our party to show up before they would seat us. Mind you, there was no one else waiting, and the table was ready, and we were ready to order. But they didn't tell us this; I didn't even know why we were being forced to wait until I heard a supervisor whispering to the waitress about making us wait. I still have no idea why we were forced to wait. \n\nWhen my full party was finally seated, we were helped by two waiters who were perfectly polite and nice. BUT, our service was rather haphazard. People would order drinks and food, and get things at wildly different times. One person was done eating appetizers and drinks when another was just getting their first drink. I know there was chaos to a big party, but it got a little out of hand.\n\nThe food is pretty standard American chain food, comparable to Appleby's and Chili's - not offensive, but nothing to knock your socks off. It has a decent selection, and a few good desserts and appetizers, and everything was competently prepared. Overall, it is a fine enough meal for a large group before going to enjoy the arcade at fairly reasonable prices, but some of the service standards are poor. In the future we will probably eat at one of the other restaurants in the area and then move over to D&B's for games.\n\nBar: 1 Star\n\nDrinks are predictably expensive, but there is a wide variety. The problem is that about half of them don't even kind of resemble what is on the menu, and most don't have enough alcohol to even taste. Worse yet, while you can get a drink at the bar in the arcade, the staff is either completely non-interactive or just rude. You have to track them down, and then have a minimum of interaction before they stomp off like you ruined their life.\n\nArcade: 4 Stars\n\nThere are a lot of great games here to play, and many that are fun with groups or pairs. It is a great place for a large party, because you can mingle with all your friends playing many different very fun games. If you are a couple, there are also many great selections that everyone enjoys. The staff on the floor is helpful and fast to fix games that have problems, and are typically polite. The ticket prizes are cheap as expected, but kind of fun, and the people in the ticket shop were always nice and quick to help.\n\n\nOverall: 3 Stars\n\nIf you want to hang out here, I would suggest eating somewhere else, and then playing games and having fun here, but only order beer at the bar and don't expect a smile.", "business_id": "sbW8qHJgzEIH42B0S-3New", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-09-29", "type": "review"}

Second, I actually experience all of it while here.  We will start with the food/service.  Staff, you were wonderful.  You were polite, you greeted us as soon as we walked in the door, gave us no qualms while ordering and were swift with your delivery.  Food, you were not wonderful.  I ordered the BBQ chicken breasts.  This came with a side of broccoli and their type of mashed potatoes.  The chicken was a bit dry and in some places you can tell it was left on the grill a little too long.  There were actually some bites that all I could taste was charred meat.  There wasn't enough BBQ sauce on the the chicken either.  The broccoli appeared to have been cooked prior and then thrown back into a pan to be seared.  Some of my broccoli actually had some burnt crisp areas on it.  Also I noticed that there were still some leaves left on the broccoli.  The mashed potatoes I wanted to like (which I hoped would be the best part of the dish, I'm a bit of a potato freak), but alas, I was let down. *sad face* They were cold and such a tiny portion.  With a tiny amount of shredded cheese and bacon but into that divot they made with the scoop to get it out of it's container.  Oh food, how if I didn't need you to survive, I wouldn't complain about you.\n\nThe building right now is in disarray.  They are in the midst of a remodel with lovely plastic curtains covering up certain sections of their dining area.  No bar out in the dining area right now and the pool tables were absent as well.  If you wanted a drink you had to go back into the game room.\n\nSpeaking of the game room, by far the best part.  With the meal I ordered I got the $20 play card (the best part of the meal, super charge it for $3 more and it's even better).  The game room  you can tell is in need of an update.  The carpet is worn and other signs of wear are noticeable as well.  One good thing is the games.  They change them up so often that there is always something new once you return.  Who knew that playing Connect 4 could be so fun, or for that matter Skee Ball rises to the top of my list to play.\n\nI will return again, but only after I eat elsewhere first.", "business_id": "sbW8qHJgzEIH42B0S-3New", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-10-22", "type": "review"}

It seems there are so many breweries out there that offer great beer, and slack off on the food. Unfortunately Rock Bottom is one that falls into that category. Let's be honest, when you go to a brewery, you want the full experience. If it was only about the beer, I'd go buy a growler and take it home. \n\nSo, about the beer....EXCELLENT!!!!! The Jagoff IPA is with out a doubt one of the best IPAs I have ever had! They only I can think of that I think is better is Dogfish Head, but that's a matter of opinion. The beer selection is constantly changing, and they always have some excellent seasonal beers. You can't go wrong, there's bound to be a beer everyone will like. \n\nAs for the food.......it's pretty much a crap shoot. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's terrible. My biggest problem is there is absolutely no consistency when it comes to the food. One time it's perfect, then maybe it's cold, or it's burned, or it tastes completely different from the last time you had it. Unfortunately, it seems there is zero attention to food quality. \n\nThat's pretty much it. This place fixes it's food consistency, and it's a five star place.

He a wheat beer of their brewing, me my fave Bloody Mary with Absolut Peppar.  The hubster deemed the beer acceptable, but wouldn't go out of his way to come back just for another one....yes, he DID order another one \"just to be sure.\"  My Bloody sucked.  Watered down tomato juice with no discernible Peppar of any kind, let alone any other seasonings.  Even a good standard mix would have been better.  Our very efficient and friendly waitress took it back and watched while it was remade by the other bartender.  Nope, no better at all.  That went back and I went with a you-can't-screw-it-up Amaretto sour.  It was fine.\n\nHub ordered a Reuben - why, I'll never know because they simply never measure up to the gold standard of what used to be at the long-lamented Gazebo in Shadyside.  You younguns wouldn't have a clue of the establishment of which I speak.  He said this one was \"fine.\"  I had the Texas Fire steak with jalapeno butter which I enjoyed very much!  Packed a punch of heat and flavor, but the sides were uninspired.  Steamed veggies.  Any flavor was steamed out in the process - eh.  Cheddar mashed potatoes - there was cheddar in there?????  No way!\n\nThe tab was reasonable - we DID have a Living Social deal that took $30 off, so our check was for $12 and change, not including tip.

We put our names on the list and went shopping around the area. About 25 minutes later, our table was ready. Parking was a cluster since the lot is shared with Dave & Busters and a karaoke bar called Sing Sing. Tom dropped me off at the door so I could secure our table.\n\nOur server, Jackie, approached me almost immediately and brought two waters to the table to start. She was very attentive and funny, and probably the best part of our experience at the restaurant. Tom ordered a Red Ale and to his surprise, didn't care for it. Jackie gave Tom three free samples of beers she thought he would like after talking to him about his beer drinking habits. He loved all three, and chose the most bizarre (and expensive) beer. Jackie switched the Red Ale to the beer of Tom's choice, and charged us for the less expensive beer. Very nice of her!\n\nWe started out with the Ball Park Pretzels with Jalapeno dip. The pretzels came out quickly and they were very fresh, not to mention huge! We only ate one and took the other to go. Very good app though! \n\nTom ordered some sort of bacon cheeseburger, and I got the Chicken Fried Chicken, which was a pounded chicken breast, breaded and fried, over white cheddar mashed potatoes with a side of gravy and some apple coleslaw.  Tom's burger came with a small handful of fries, and my meal was very spread out on my plate, like something was missing. Not very good presentation at all.

Tom said that his burger was mediocre.\n\nAnother note: The bathrooms are shared with the Sing Sing karaoke bar that is in the same building, so expect drunk singing women in the bathrooms and brides-to-be puking in the stall next to you after enjoying too much alcohol at their bachelorette party...

The one chain that I can't break from is rock bottom. \n\nTheir beer is always good- as far as their staples go, I really love their white ale. Their seasonal IPAs have been good and my favorite seasonals of all time included their chocolate raspberry stout (...yes, it tasted as good as it sounds; they had it last year around Christmas) and their smoky BBQ brown ale (tasted like summer, complemented BBQ amazingly ; they had it this past summer, I bought a growler of it lol). \n\nAs far as their food goes, I typically stay away from the appetizers. $10 and up is a little too pricey for me as far as appetizers go. I've had their southwestern rolls and they were good but not worth $10. \n\nAlmost every time I go I order the Baja chicken sandwich. It's my favorite chicken sandwich! So good. The chicken is actually grilled (which goes for all of their chicken sandwiches) and I love the charred flavor that it has. The bun is soft but sturdy and doesn't fall apart while eating the sandwich, the sauce is amazing, the onion frizzles are the best and last but not least... There's a half of a fresh avocado on this sandwich. Mhm! I love it. My boyfriend usually gets the hickory BBQ bacon chicken sandwich and loves it as well. \n\nAnother item I ALWAYS get... Their apple coleslaw. I've yet to find better coleslaw in a restaurant. So simple, yet oh so good. \n\nThey also recently changed their fries and these are much better than their old ones. \n\nTheir side salads are awesome as well. They are decent in size- spring mix topped with sunflower seeds, raisins, half of a hard boiled egg (which I give to the boyfriend), chopped cucumbers and tomatoes and croutons. Yum! \n\nI usually order the same thing every time I go. I steered off my normal path once and ordered the buffalo Mac and cheese and found it to be quite tasteless.

I was so glad they were paying cause  I was low on funds at the time.\n\nWe arrived on a friday night and of course it was busy there. We waited about 10 minutes to get a table which wasn't bad considering the crowd. We looked over the menu and they have so many great choices. Pizza, pasta, appetizers, seafood, burgers, salads and sandwiches. \n\nAfter ordering two mango lemonades that were wayyyyy over sweetened we ordered our food. We both are going gluten free which is tough but UNO's gave us a nice selection of dishes to choose from. Plus! They make a thin crust gluten free pizza which taste great. My hubby ordered the mediterrean thin crust because he loves kalamata olives and I ordered the Guac-alicious burger with a Caesar side salad. My salad came out pretty quick which was nice but it had a little too much dressing on it. I didn't complain, it still tasted great.\n\nI'm not into red meat so I tried to order a black bean burger or get chicken instead of beef, but the ran out of black bean and they couldn't get the chicken so i just ordered it anyway. The burger was piled really high with all the toppings including guacamole and it was very creamy but i couldn't get over the taste of the burger because it just didn't have any flavor. Very saddening. I ended up just eating the veggies and discarding the meat. I snacked on some of my hubbies pizza even though it was only a small amount. \n\nWe came here twice in one week. The second time we ordered the 9-grain deep dish with mushrooms, parmesan and a garlic white sauce. Was this pizza amazing or what?? I will probably always eat this pizza whenever I come. \n\nOnly down side is slow service. It took 20 minutes for our pizza to come out and my hubbies was a little over cooked.

You have your corporate headquarters within walking distance and this is all you can serve up? \n\nMy husband and I were craving a late night snack after seeing a movie a couple weekends ago and decided to try this Eat 'N Park location for the first time. I had always been adequately satisfied at other locations so I thought this restaurant would be worth a try.\n\nI ordered several items - Sweet Potato Fries with Apple Butter Dip, Hot Chocolate, and Pumpkin Creme Pie. I think my husband ordered some sort of burger or sandwich. Anyway, every item was problematic in some way. The fries were good, but the apple butter was oddly thick and sweet. The hot chocolate had \"creative\" chocolate syrup drizzling, that was running all down the cup and saucer. I had to carefully drink the beverage - which was OK - because I was afraid that I would get the syrup all over my hand, face, and clothes. The pumpkin creme pie looked like it was sliced by a 5 year old. It looked like it had been carelessly cut and plopped onto the plate, where it appeared very flat and unappetizing.\n\nHowever, our waitress was the sweetest, middle-aged woman! Our food took a little time to get to our table (not too bad though) and she comped two of the items (I believe the Hot Chocolate and the pie) from our bill. She was very attentive and kind while we dined there, and I made sure that my husband gave her a good tip.

A cozy enough atmosphere (although I have to say AGAIN in a review of a restaurant, if you've got multiple TVs in the space, for gods sake, can ONE of them NOT be showing SPORTS coverage??) and a pleasant crowd of patrons. \n\nDuring my last visit, there was a large family gathering at the next table. A nicely polished middle-class clan, ranging in age from gramps to granddaughter. At one point, dad received a phone call on his cell...and actually stepped OUTSIDE to have his conversation. As I was leaving I had to pat him on the back and thank him for being one of the few remaining decent guys with manners!\n\nBottom line...Rusty Nail is comfortable. It's not a drive-out-of-you-way destination for dining. It is what it is. A great little neighborhood spot FOR the neighborhood. \n\nBut do bring cash. The don't take credit cards. Believe it or not, they WILL actually take a check.", "business_id": "ucKQlQvOeJxETLNkpKcaSw", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-10-13", "type": "review"}

I enjoyed a sausage omelet with American cheese and my husband had a Denver omelet.  The omelets were well prepared and served with toast.  Potatoes were and extra $2.29, but a serving of potatoes was enough for two.  Breakfast for four adults was about $50 including tip.  All adults had coffee or tea and a full breakfast.\n\nThe service was friendly and prompt on the day we were there and coffee refills were offered readily.

However I have had dinner here before.\n\nI like Dunnings because it is not tying to be anything other than an old school, family friendly, bar-restuarant. It is a Regent Square staple, and the folks that come here seem to be staples as well. There is a Cheers vibe (early 80's sitcom\nabout a Boston bar where \"everyone knows your name\") and that seems to fare very well with the local residents. After living in Los Angeles for all of my 20's, I find this kind of environment comforting and  refreshing.\n\nFor the life of me, I cannot remember what I had for dinner here. I guess that may be a testament to the mediocre food.\n\nSo, if you are looking for a low key, mellow, old school (dark wood, framed pictures of landscapes a'la Rembrandt) place to check out, have a casual drink and appetizer, Dunnings is your spot.   I feel bad that the previous folks had crappy service, but if you come here with an open mind and the correct expectations, you will love this place as much as I do.\n\nAlso, it is Regent Theater adjacent, so it is also the perfect spot to have a quick drink/ appetizer before a film.", "business_id": "XQ7elqSFIRogvqpiTZz-Wg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-09-06", "type": "review"}

It's turned into somewhat of a running joke with us: the staff expect to be slow but they get slammed every night we're there! So the servers end up with 10 tables or so. And there's never a hostess to seat guests, so people just end up wandering in and seating anywhere. This adds to the chaos. It's almost painful to watch. But the staff is very friendly, for the most part. Only once have I been upset at service and it was with a to-go order. The bartender took my order and didn't write anything down. I knew it was a bad sign but didn't say anything. Sure enough, the whole order was f'd up. We called and complained and they comped us a meal.

They just need to have four things\n1. ESPN\n2. Nachos pilled high with all kinds of stuff\n3. beer specials\n4. big screen TVs.\n\nWell Sports Rock failed on all accounts.  I was encouraged when we walked in and saw individual TVs on each table.  Of course we picked the one that didn't work!  Then we realized while there were many out of market games, the Virginia Tech one was nowhere to be seen. So we politely ask for ESPN.  Not ESPN U or 360 or anything fancy.  Plain old regular ESPN.  Then we get some story about how they only have six recievers.  Thats fine.  But why am i watching the Maine/Iowa game.  SERIOUSLY.  I was also annoyed that when the cute girl walked up to the bar, he had the Georgia game on within minutes. \n\nThe nachos were absolutely disgusting and my wrap just leaked oil and disgustingness.   The fries were even terrible, but i found if you dipped them in the gross nacho cheese, they weren' that bad.   \n\nPlus, beer was 4.75!  Multiply that by a 3 hour game and you're paying a lot.  Service was awful and i think i would get better reception on a tv with rabbit ears.  Overall this place sucked, although i will give them credit as we were finally getting up to leave and go to an Irish Bar that was able to show ESPN, i noticed the hokie game all the way back in the corner.  Took them long enough.\n\nIf you're ever in Pittsburgh in need of watching ESPN heres my idea.  Grab a permanti brothers sandwich and a six pack of beer and watch it in your hotel room rather than waste your money to sit and watch Maine vs Iowa on a crappy little tv with no reception.", "business_id": "HDTv_rnmSL8AQ04_zTWARA", "stars": 1, "date": "2008-09-01", "type": "review"}

Granted I was only 7 or 8 years old then, but I can recall everything (how can I forget the taste of those pancakes?!). Since then, I've been to quite a few diners, including diner-restaurants (i.e. faux diners). I would go particularly on the morning after a night of partying and/or drinking, when I'm feeling too lazy or hung over to cook something decent without burning myself and my kitchen. On these mornings, I would typically order pancakes or omelettes with a side (usually hash browns) and coffee. Honestly, I've never eaten anything other than these breakfast staples at a diner.\n\nMy friends and I arranged to have a late brunch one day at Ritters Diner. Now, I didn't have much to eat the night before, so I couldn't wait until we met to have something to eat. So, I came to the diner having already eaten a light breakfast. A quick observation of the diner made me realize that this isn't a traditional diner; instead, it seemed more like a diner-restaurant. Oh well, there was still the service and the food to worry about. We sat down at a booth in the large room in the back of the restaurant. The waitress greeted us and took our drink orders immediately: two cups of coffee and two glasses of water. Several minutes later, we got our coffee and water, but weren't ready to order just yet. We spent several more minutes deciding, and when we were ready, we placed our menus in a neat stack in the center of the table to show that we were ready to order. We waited...and waited...and waited some more. Minutes turned into half an hour and longer. By that point, my friends were getting quite hangry. I was sitting there feeling sorry for them and very concerned with the poor service. This whole time, I was monitoring discreetly the other diners who had our waitress and arrived after we did. A few of them actually have gotten their food, have paid, and have left. After what seemed like an eternity, our waitress suddenly materializes and takes our order.\n\nWe get our food: chocolate chip pancakes; club sandwich; spinach omelette with cheese and buttered toast; and something else (sorry, I must've had too much coffee). My omelette was decent; I would have preferred if they hadn't used too much cheese, especially what I think was American cheese (it could've been cheddar, but the taste didn't seem right). The toast was good, but I was too full to keep eating. I did try a bite of the chocolate chip pancakes, and it was so rich and delicious! My other two starving friends pretty much inhaled their food in minutes.\n\nBased on this one experience, I would come only for the pancakes. Service was really bad even though the place was half empty. I might experiment with this diner once or twice more to get a better feel for it.\n\nSo to summarize: not a real diner, service was bad, food was decent, and come for the pancakes.", "business_id": "--UE_y6auTgq3FXlvUMkbw", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-10-10", "type": "review"}

When my boyfriend asked our waitress if the food would be coming soon, she again acted extremely annoyed, as if our presence was a nuisance. She told us she did not know when the food would be up because \"Sundays are really busy.\" When the pierogies came we were disappointed to realize that only three came in an order.

It had mixed reviews so my curiosity got the best of me. \nThe menu is lengthy. I am a huge breakfast food fan so I decided to order breakfast. I usually go the eggs and bacon route, but flipped the script when I saw the Coco Loco pancakes. They are pancakes with chocolate chips and coconut. I also ordered a side of bacon. My son got bacon & eggs that came with toast and home fries. \nWhen my pancakes came they looked like your typical pancakes with a light sprinkling of coconut and chocolate chips. There was also a drizzle of chocolate syrup. I was a tad disappointed. I ate the top pancake and it was incredibly delicious. I thought \" it's too bad this is not in each pancake. Still hungry I started eating the two remaining pancakes. Oh. My. Word. There wasn't any coconut in them but they were packed with chocolate chips. I'm talking packed!  They were some of the best pancakes I've ever had. The side of bacon was a little salty which was needed to break up all of the sweetness of the pancakes. My son eats \"dippy\" eggs ( runny sunny side up). I'm not a fan but he enjoyed them. Living in the Burgh we are used to getting Italian bread as toast but this was true blue white sandwich bread. He cleaned his plate so that should tell you that he liked it a lot. \nThe diner is exactly that-a true diner. It has never been updated. The menu has probably been the same for more than 25 years. But if your parking lots (they have 2) are filled that means you are doing something right. The cars were everything from old beaters to Porches. That says a lot as well. \nWe will definitely be back to try other menu items!!", "business_id": "--UE_y6auTgq3FXlvUMkbw", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-09-27", "type": "review"}

Despite living two blocks away and having driven by many times, I'd never dropped in until now.  Given that I needed an inexpensive and convenient place to meet someone who also lives nearby, I figured it was as good of an opportunity as any to try it out, so I suggested it and we met for Sat. breakfast.\n\nFortunately, my friend arrived 15 min. before I did and was able to secure a table, since Ritter's gets quite crowded on Sat. mornings.  Also fortunately, the interior is quite large, which is necessary given its popularity at peak hours.  Once I was seated, our server promptly took our orders, which was appreciated.  However, it took almost half an hour for the kitchen to get them out, which seemed long, given the amount of time that my friend had already waited, and that I've received prompter order fulfillment at other diners, such as the Dor Stop.\n\nOnce it finally emerged, the food itself was pretty standard quality diner food--nothing to write home about.  Given that it was Halloween morning, I ordered the pumpkin pancake special ($5.99) with a side of bacon ($2.50).  I could definitely detect pumpkin in the pancake batter, which was nice, but I've been spoiled by the Dor Stop's pumpkin pancakes (which are available year round, BTW), and these didn't hold a candle to them.  The bacon was also disappointingly chewy, to the point that I didn't even finish part of my last strip.  My friend ordered the chicken sandwich, which seemed of similar mediocre quality, though I didn't try it.\n\nOverall, Ritter's met my standards for diner food, but didn't exceed them, and failed to meet them in some respects (chewy bacon--argh!).  One thing Ritter's has going for it is that the prices are quite reasonable; however, come prepared as only cash is accepted.  I realize that a lot of their business comes from inebriated customers late at night, so if that describes your situation, it probably hits the spot.  If you're willing to travel and are looking for a good weekend morning breakfast, though, I recommend the Dor Stop in Dormont or Central Diner and Grill in Robinson, both of which illustrate that diner food can be better than mediocre--in fact, it can be great!", "business_id": "--UE_y6auTgq3FXlvUMkbw", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-11-02", "type": "review"}

They're known too for great fish and steaks though I had burger after burger every time I went.\nI went with friends, another time with my kids, occasionally by myself and sat at the bar. Always good. The wait can be crazy long and they don't do reservations.

I've had famous burgers such as the ones at Mr. Bartley's up in MA or the french bread burgers down at Rotier's in Nashville as well as regional burgers like the green chili cheeseburgers of the southwest.\n\nAfter it all, I still see Tessaro's as one of the best burgers I've had ever (my other top burger joints are scattered throughout the midwest where the beef is as fresh as fresh gets).  I started out with medium rare burgers when I first started going there, but eventually I toned down the knob to rare.  My cheese choice is always a slice of American.\n\nI typically like my burgers griddled with only burger bun and cheese, but since Tessaro's serves up \"Pub Burgers\", I find it okay to eat with rabbit food (lettuce, tomato, onion).  Ketchup on a burger is blasphemy.  There is never a reason to add ketchup on a burger unless the burger is of poor quality.  Ketchup on a good burger is like heading to a prime steakhouse and asking for A1.  Save it for when you overcook your burgers at home or when you're at McDonald's.  Mustard is okay in reasonable quantities since its texture and taste complements the burger as opposed to covering it up.\n\nMy first thought was wow. These buns are huge. The top bun was awkwardly round and I had squish it a little to get a first bite that consisted of both burger and bun. It worked out in the end, as the buns were able to sop up all the excess beef juice without getting excessively soggy and difficult to hold. The patty itself was perfectly cooked. A full half pound of loosely packed coarse ground beef. I'm not sure what blend they use (definitely more than just chuck), but I want to guess around 75-80% lean, which is perfect in my book. The beef itself had an amazing texture and wasn't heavily seasoned. The beef itself tasted remarkably fresh and just the right amount of \"beefy\". I usually order cheeseburgers over hamburgers as the slice of cheese makes the burger more forgiving to being overcooked and dry; however, at Tessaro's, this was not the case. The slice of American cheese was perfectly melted and added the textural difference between the soft buns, the crisp lettuce, and the beefy patty. The lettuce and onions added additional contrast with their crunchy attributes, and the acidity from the two tomato slices balanced out the cheese. The soggy pickles were overshadowed by the red onion slices which offered not only a crunch but also a spicy kick, and I did not notice them at all.\n\nMy side choice is always home fries.  They come slightly charred and taste of delicious butter.  I had half my portion \"naked\" and paired the half with the traditional Heinz ketchup. Honestly they didn't need the extra boost of flavor from the ketchup as they were amazing beforehand already. With the addition of the Heinz, the subtle tones of the char and butter were covered up, which was a pity.\n\nWhen you go to a steakhouse you order a steak.  When you go to a coffeehouse you order a coffee.  When you go to Tessaro's you order a burger.", "business_id": "vgXE1I7c9ElcfYyZfQiN1Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-10-01", "type": "review"}

IMHO, if you added some ground chuck you would get even better flavor but overall they have some of the best tasting burger meat out there.\n\nThey cook on a griddle that is heated by burning hard woods, an interesting concept but to be honest I could not taste any smokiness to the meat. Also, IMHO, grilled meat tastes better, but griddled meat is juicer.\n\nThe burgers are served on what appears to be a Portuguese style bun, rather plain tasting they add very little to the burger itself. Toppings are simple lettuce, tomato, onions, etc. Their goal is to highlight the meat and not cover it up with lots of toppings or sauces.\n\nOn the side I had the home-fries, which they suggested, and to be honest they were disgustingly gross. Overcooked lumps of potato and onions saturated in grease that not only looked bad but didn't taste very good either.\n\nI like the ambience of the local burger joint, but thought a burger for $ 9.00 was pretty spendy. Service was good.\n\nBottom Line:\n\nSome of the best meat that I've had in a burger, it was cooked perfectly and very juicy - skip those home fires (yuck).\n \nIf you are burger purist, enjoying a plain all American hamburger with nothing fancy you will love Tessaro's, if however, you like a more complicated burger with lots of dressings / sauces and complex toppings you will find Tessaro's lacking.\n\nSo why three stars? 1 off for the home fires and 1 off for not grilling the burger over that hardwood.", "business_id": "vgXE1I7c9ElcfYyZfQiN1Q", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-10-01", "type": "review"}

One, I moved here from South Florida, where the best burgers in town came from your average diners.  They were the last bastion of American food in South Florida, so they served up REAL American food.  If you wanted a real burger, you went to a diner.  After returning to Pittsburgh, I found that every diner here has turned to serving up those frozen gray hockey puck patties and passing them off as burgers.\n\nSecond, (until the recent explosion of good burger joints in da burgh), I actually HAD been a fan of Tessaro's, until their hostess/manager flat out offended the hell out of me and my party of three.  The result is that I have never, and WILL never return to Tessaro's.\n\nMy best friend is a 62 y/o blind woman that I met doing theater in the 90's in Pittsburgh.  She lives with her 91 year old mother, and her father (the driver) passed away several years ago.  I don't drive, and rely on the bus system that Steve Bland is intentionally systematically destroying, so any outing that we make must be carefully planned.\n\nShe and I had met once at Tessaro's.  It was her first time being there.  She took the Access van for the disabled, and I met her there after work via bus.  I walked in, she was seated, having a drink, waiting for me to join her. No problem.  We had a great meal, with an awesome burger.  I can't say enough...they really do have mouthwatering burgers.\n\nMonths later, we decided to go again, and the plan was pretty much the same.  She took the Access van to the restaurant, and I was going to meet her by bus, and this time a new friend was going to join us, coming by bus from Oakland, and new to Pittsburgh.\n\nMy best friend called me at 4:30 (we were supposed to meet at 5) and said that her van had come early, and that she was already at the restaurant.  I told her I would get there as soon as I could.  I left work a few minutes before 5 pm, and arrived at the restaurant 5:15.  They were busy, but I was surprised to find my friend still standing in the doorway.  The blind woman had been standing there for 45 minutes.  \n\nI made my presence known, and the hostess/manager acknowledged, asked about our other friend. I explained that he was ten minutes away and coming by bus, new to the city, but WAS on his way.  She walked away from us.  We stood in the doorway fro another twenty minutes.\n\nFinally, the manager came back, and I caught her attention, and motioned my head toward my blind friend, and asked if we really had to keep waiting?  She'd been standing there in the doorway for over an hour.\n\nThe next statement sealed the deal on us never returning to Tessaro's.  The manager slapped her hands on her hips, and started barking:\n\n\"LOOK!  We don't have many rules around here!  In fact, we only have ONE, that you don't get seated until your whole party is here!\"\n\nAnd THIS is what really sealed it:\n\nThe woman thrust her thumb in my BLIND friend's direction, who had only been to Tessaro's ONCE before in her life, with me, and said:\n\n\"And SHE oughta KNOW that!\"\n\nShe oughta know that?  Exactly HOW should she 'know that'? The only other time she'd been there, she arrived before me, was seated, waited, and I joined her.\n\nAdditionally, the 'rule' was posted...on a piece of 8 1/2 by 11 copy paper, taped to the wall at the end of the counter, behind several rows of water pitchers.  I couldn't see the 'rule'...a blind woman certainly wasn't going to 'see' it!\n\nFinally, after another ten minutes standing there, the manager 'allowed' us to take a table and wait for our friend, who came five minutes later.  We ate our meal, paid our bill, and we left.\n\nAnd we will NOT return.\n\nYou can treat me badly, and if there's something I really love about your business, I might come back.  But do NOT badmouth a blind woman, or anyone else for that matter, who is disabled, and in need of a slight amount of extra consideration.\n\nTessaro's, you might make good burgers, and you'll continue making a fortune off them.  And I'm sure you really don't give a crap about how your manager treated this lady.  But we will NOT drop one dime more in your restaurant.  We'll take our business to Burgatory.", "business_id": "vgXE1I7c9ElcfYyZfQiN1Q", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-10-19", "type": "review"}

I lived about an hour and a half outside of the city. Coming here was usually pretty exciting. (Here as in the city, not Silky's.) I had a friend who lived here in the East End and on the street I reside on now. \n\nSeveral times we found ourselves at Silky's Pub. I love the corner building, the way it looks out onto Liberty Ave. It looks so welcoming. Especially in the summer. Outdoor seating, always pretty well packed with people.\n\nI'll come right out and say that the crowd that frequents Silky's isn't my usual crowd, but unlike some bars I'd never had an issue with someone wanting to start a fight with us because we look like a bunch of dirty malcontents. This place is just not our usual dive bar.\n\nThursday night my boyfriend texted me that he was there with a mutual friend. Living less than a city block from there I headed over. I needed a beer and some hockey/world series action to distract me after the Halloween parade. It was as busy as usual. A few seats remaining and I managed to snag one right at the bar, front and center.\n\nI hate to say this because I don't remember this happening years ago when I went there. I was not even acknowledged. I get flagging down a bartender in a crazy busy bar in the South Side on a Friday night. I don't like it but I get it. This was a moderately steady Thursday night. I wasn't standing behind the people's sitting at the bar. I was the person sitting at the bar. There were two male bartenders both bartenders asked the guy next to me multiple times if he wanted anything else to drink. \n\nBy \"multiple times\" I mean 6 or 8 times. The person sitting directly beside me. They wouldn't look at me. I tried to make eye contact with either of them and it was as if I wasn't even there. Eventually the boyfriend's beer emptied as well. This is about 20 minutes after I arrived. I've had people walk in and stand behind us and the bar tender or waitress was on them immediately. After another 5 minutes of the boyfriend's beer being perched precariously on the edge of the bar and the bartenders standing there chatting he had to ask the bartender for a refill and if I could have a drink.\n\nThe bartender looks up at him, grabs his pint glass angrily from the bar and says, \"Oh, you wanted another?\" \n\nReally? I was so angry at that point that it took everything I had not to ask the guy what his issue was.  I later saw him drop a pint glass and stumble into something so many he was drunk.\n\nThe food that other people ordered smelled and looked great. Even the seafoody bits which I normally hate smelling. The tv's are plentiful and newer. I just don't know if I'll ever get to go back and try the food as I hate being slighted by a business owner and treated as if my business isn't appreciated.", "business_id": "3zgswf_NfBJpeAoWeTkgMA", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-10-29", "type": "review"}

They have a few TVs which always is showing the big game and usually has good specials during Penguin and Steeler games. Silky's also boasts a shuffleboard table and darts to keep people busy and having fun.  The shuffleboard is a must to try.\n2.  The beer and food are grade A bar quality.  Nothing pretentious here, just good wings, a huge burger, and unique selections.  The beer list isn't huge, but they do carry a few microbrews and some of the local swill.  \n3.  No smoking.  \nSilky's in Bloomfield also has plenty of tables and bar stools and isn't over run with drunk yinzers it attracts a mix of college students, young professionals, and old dudes from the Bloomfield area.  \n\nIf you're searching for a new bar to have some food, play some games, and drink a beer look no further than The 'Chester.", "business_id": "3zgswf_NfBJpeAoWeTkgMA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-09-02", "type": "review"}

Tonight, we sat outside and our waitress (Nikki) walked past us four times without making eye contact.  In fairness, I dont think it's an issue with the waitress being bad as much as they really need to hire more waitresses, bc it seemed like there was only one waitress for the entire restaurant.\n\nOur tabletop was sticky and so after waiting for 20 min for service I decided I really needed a drink and went inside.  The bartender (Olivia) did not want to serve me bc we were sitting outside.  \"Your waitress will be right with you.\"  me:  \"But you are here now, can I please have a Shocktop Wheat?\"  \"Ill tell the waitress.\"  me:  \"Please may i just have my beer?\"  She served me, but then the waitress walked up to me and was like, \"Oh, I didn't see you, weren't you outside?\"  If you didn't see me how would you notice I was outside?\n\nIts ok, I felt bad for her bc she was so busy but like--I'm easy to please.  All I needed was a beer.  I got one, so the waitress and I were then \"cool.\"  She then proceeded to never come back to our table, but that's ok i think we pissed her off.\n\nThis has been a common thread:  not enough waitstaff so you have to beg for your food or drinks when the wait staff does come by.  It's extremely frustrating.\n\nThe time before last we were there we ordered food and the waitress told us that we could expect to wait over an hour bc they had a group of 15 come in.  We thought she was kidding, and had our beers, so we rolled with it but she was not kidding.  We waitied over an hour for our food and the waitress made no apologies.  Also, our friend came and ordered food before ours came out, and this was around 10:30.  after waiting and waiting and waiting we asked the waitress for an ETA on his burger, but it turned out she forgot to put it in, and hte kitchen had closed.\n\nThe service sucks but what really sucks is the staff is never apologetic about it bc this place is a neighborhood bar w locals so they kind of dont care about apologizing bc they know you'll be back.\n\nBut I come here bc like I said the food is ok, but you've got to come here and be very very patient.", "business_id": "3zgswf_NfBJpeAoWeTkgMA", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-10-05", "type": "review"}

They did switch the games around while PITT was at half but as soon as that game started the LSU game was back relegated to the corner. The manager even made some comment that our group didn't appreciate but whatever it's not like I will be back anytime soon. If you are looking for some good bar food I say stop on by.

Sure, where do you wanna go?\n\nYou should really have an easy answer to that question when someone asks you, but lately I haven't.  I've lived in Bloomfield for two years now, and have yet to identify \"my spot.\"  I love the neighborhood -- great restaurants, bars, local business, art spaces, etc.  I like several of the bars, but just haven't figured out which is my go-to spot.  \n\nLast night I asked a friend to meet me for a beer and she suggested Lot 17.  It is literally right around the corner from me.  (And when I say literally, I do NOT mean \"figuratively,\" which so many people do, by accident I suppose, but they're saying exactly the opposite of what they mean! Grrr)  It's right around the corner, and since I had actually never been in, I thought it was a perfect choice.\n\nThe first thing you notice is the classy wooden decor.  Everything is all really nice hardwood.  It has a very simple style -- the traditional wood, simple chalk board beer list, a couple of nice HD TVs -- none of which stands out or tries too hard to grab your attention.  The bar and a few tables are in the front while several more tables for dining line the back area.\n\nIt was nearly empty.  We were there late -- from about 10-11pm -- on a freezing cold Tuesday night.  A young couple sat quietly at the bar, another guy in the corner chatted up the bartender, and I grabbed a seat a little further down the bar.  I ordered a Full Pint Festivus draft, which is a great brown ale from a brewery in North Versailles that I've heard wonderful things about.  \n\nAfter a few sips my friend came in and joined me.  She had a Guiness, I had another Festivus, we chatted about this and that.  It was quiet, low key, and comfortable.  It's a place that looks really nice yet had a friendly almost dive-y vibe.  I was only there for an hour and no one else was really there, so I shouldn't jump to conclusions.  However, I will definitely be plopping myself down at that classic bar again in the near future, and who knows, maybe Lot 17 will become my neighborhood go-to spot for grabbing a beer on a whim.\n\nThere was a new, shiny, fancy looking, electronic jukebox that I will definitely have to give a try next time!

My boyfriend ordered the Reuben with Cajun fries.they have several other menu items that looked good: a salmon blt, crab cake sandwich, turkey club on focaccia, and many burgers that are very good from what my boyfriend says.

Menu items I have tried since my first review:\n1. Turkey club on focaccia (Our own oven roasted turkey breast, bacon, and Swiss cheese with lettuce and tomatoes served with a roasted garlic mayonnaise on focaccia) $8.50\n2. Salmon BLT (Grilled salmon served on hoagie roll with dill mayo, bacon, lettuce, and tomato) $12.00\n3. Grilled chicken wrap (Chicken breast, sundried tomatoes, olives and feta cheese wrapped in a spinach tortilla with balsamic dressing) $9.00\n4. Calamari (Fried calamari served with peppers, onions, marinara sauce and lemon) $9.00\n\nMy favorite out of these would be the chicken wrap, although I wish the dressing was already inside the wrap because the wrap was packed so tightly it was difficult to get the dressing ratio right in the wrap. The turkey club also had a lot of flavor to it as well and the garlic mayo gave it a nice touch. The salmon BLT was not as good as the ones I have had at Piper's Pub but still adequate. I'm not a huge calamari fan so it was just ok for me.

The temperature was just about perfect for a fall night to eat out on their patio. The outside seating gives a really nice atmosphere to wind down after a long day at work.

Waitstaff has a pretty poor knowledge of their own drink menu.\n\n2- The food will be overpriced/sub par. On one occasion me and my entire party got food poisoning from their fried calamari\n\n3- You will be seated somewhere awkward/uncomfortable. The interior is cool looking but not functional, gets very congested when there are big crowds. \n\nThere are plenty of other bar/restaurant destinations in Pittsburgh that can deliver and execute the same idea in a much better way.

Though I trust her recommendations, I really wasn't anticipating that much. The name -- Harris Grill -- seemed a little ho-hum, and I was expecting your typical Pittsburgh-type place with basic appetizers and lots of Yuengling.\n\nHowever, as soon as I sat down, I knew this place was going to be different. First of all, it was packed! The cute little patio had lots of young professionals ranging in attire from girls in maxi dresses to guys wearing dress pants, button-ups, and ties. Thankfully, one of my friends had arrived a few minutes before 5pm and secured the last available table on the patio. Lots of local residents were taking advantage of the absolutely incredible weather to sit outside.\n\nAfter quickly becoming intimidated by the enormous drink \"book,\" I just took my friend's recommendation and ordered a frozen cosmo. Wow! Delicious!! It was the perfect blend of cold but not too icy and not too sweet but not too sour. I could drink these things every day! Well, maybe not every day... because they pack a serious punch! I was warned not to order the additional shot when it was offered to me, and thankfully I heeded the warning. After two of these beverages, I was definitely tipsy! In my opinion, two of these little frozen cosmos pack the same amount of buzz as 3-4 glasses of wine.\n\nIn addition to amazing frozen cosmos, I enjoyed trying their appetizers. The spinach dip and pita was tasty, and the pierogies, though very different from the pierogies that I have had in the past, were out-of-this-world good. I was tempted to order a second round of the pierogies but didn't want to appear gluttonous. \n\nService was pretty good, especially considering how busy the restaurant was and how tightly we were packed onto the little patio. Our waiter both resembled and acted like Conan O'Brien, which was just the icing on the cake of a great happy hour experience.\n\nAnd, finally, the check arrived. My jaw nearly fell on the floor. Three of us girls drank 7 frozen cosmos and ate 3 appetizers... for $40. How is that even possible? If I had known in advance that the frozen cosmos were $3/each, I might have just chugged them and taken a cab home.\n\nNeedless to say, I'll be back!", "business_id": "rgmptwPbBH1wLpiBHcbIhA", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-09-08", "type": "review"}

Once you waited for the food to be replenished (about 10-15 minutes) it was just average. The buffet had an omelet station, mac and cheese, waffles, potatoes, bacon, bagels, fruit and salad. I was disappointed that they did not have any pastry items.  I recommend going for happy hour as they have discounted draft beers and frozen cosmos-their specialty and they are delicious!

The host informed us when we entered that they would be leaving soon.

My friend and I had just finished crawling the art galleries downtown, and were in the mood for some libations and grub.\n\nWe started off with some drinks.  Upon opening the drink menu, I was struck by its length and breadth.  I was initially tempted by the lavender-lemon concoction, but ultimately decided to go with a white Russian, since I'd never had one before and my lab manager had talked them up, and I enjoy my drinks sweeter as the night goes on.  It was a nice little drink--very smooth and strong, and I enjoyed the blending of the vanilla and coffee liqueur.  The best part, however, was the graham cracker crumbs on the rim!  My friend went with the painkiller, a favorite of his.  I had a sip, and it was also quite good, even though it involved coconut and I'm not usually much of a fan of coconut flavor.  Later on, he also ordered a beer (forget which kind) and a shot of yellow cake (he explained that this is a tradition because [insert backstory involving hung-over friends here]), whereas the white Russian was sufficient to quench my alcoholic thirst for the evening (I'm a lightweight when it comes to drinking).\n\nIn terms of food, we ordered the large plain macaroni and cheese.  (He doesn't eat much seafood, and I don't eat beef, which precluded all of the other options.)  Given that I'm a mac and cheese connoisseur, and that another friend recommended the mac here, I was excited to try it.  When it came out, it looked quite attractive, with interesting noodles and a sprinkling of bread crumbs on top (I'm a fan of bread crumbs on my mac).  While the flavor of the cheese was pleasant, the cheese:noodle ratio was way too low, to the point that I ended up scraping the plate to get enough of it to cover my noodles. This should never happen with a quality mac and cheese!  Even my friend, who'd had the side dish mac and cheese before, said he thought the cheese was lacking in quantity.\n\nBecause there wasn't any seating available on the patio, we were seated inside the door to the left, against the wall between the hallway and the bar.  The lighting was pretty dim, which made it a bit hard to see.  The atmosphere was definitely casual, and service was acceptable (though perhaps could have been a bit more attentive).  For the items listed above, we spent $50 + tip, which seems a bit steep.  If I were to return, I'd try to come during happy hour, since they have some nice deals on drinks and food.  3.5 stars.\n\nEDIT: I think the lack of cheesiness in the mac and cheese that I received was a fluke, based on reports from friends and the owner's comment (see below).  I'll have to come back another time to resample it--if I do, I'll update my review accordingly.", "business_id": "rgmptwPbBH1wLpiBHcbIhA", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-10-01", "type": "review"}

Yes it's packed, but we always manage to find a table.\nService is good, the waitresses are very friendly and attentive. The juke or the bar'J plays good to exceptional ol'school hip hop, alternative, rock, 80s.. you name it. Have heard very obsolete tunes by Biggie, Tupac that most have never heard, that's some music nerdiness I dig. I see a mixed crowd everytime, not just millenials. There is an outdoor space in back, where smokers can do their thing.\nOverall, great place to catch the game, eat some wings, have some beers, listen to good tunes, and chill ;)\nNow what is in that kitchen sink sauce?!

I had been wanting to come here since I randomly caught it on an episode of \"Diners, Drive-ins and Dives\" and last night was the perfect night for us.  The outside of the building is unassuming and we drove right past it before noticing that we had.  The inside of the building is not much better as it looks like your normal neighborhood bar with a bunch of flat screens T.V's on the wall, a U shaped bar on one side, booths and high top tables on the other and a back dining room.  My girlfriend and I tried to sit in the back but there was something going on there and so we eventually settled into one of the booths.\n\nThe bar seemed quite full for a Tuesday evening and our waitress (the bartender) told us that she would get to us shortly after we had seated ourselves.  After only a short wait, she was at our table taking our drink order.  I was actually impressed with how efficient she was by herself with the large crowd.  For dinner I decided to order the famous fish sandwich and a plate of pierogies (3) while my girlfriend went with the buffalo chicken wrap.  Our food came out within a reasonable time period and looked good with both of our sandwiches served with cole slaw.  The pierogies were absolutely enormous, almost as long as my hand and fried slightly, topped with onions and came with a side of applesauce.  Our waitress had asked us if we had wanted sour cream with them to but we politely declined.  They tasted pretty good as the slight fry gave them a crunchy exterior while the interior was soft and tasty.  By the time we were done with them, we had also eaten all of the applesauce as it made a good dipping sauce and helped keep the pierogies moist.  My sandwich was also pretty good as the breading on it was fried nicely and tasted good while the fish was mild.  I topped it with hot sauce and like a true Pittsburgher even put my cole slaw on it which helped to make it taste better. My girlfriend told me that she enjoyed her buffalo chicken wrap and the single bite that I took gave me a nice buffalo flavor.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I am glad that I came here and might be back again depending on what I am looking for.  The food was dirt cheap with our whole bill coming to $22 and it exceeded the expectations that I had given to it whenever we walked in.  However, with that being said, the building is fairly run down and it is bar food and so I wouldn't expect it to be the greatest food you have ever tasted.", "business_id": "ufyh6h4GsR-RYY2lC_Iz7w", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-11-08", "type": "review"}

The service is SLOW! We came here twice before on a Sunday. There is no waiting and we got seated right away. Thinking since they weren't so packed, that the service would be better. Not. Every time we have came here when they are busy service has been great, but when they are slow they ARE slow. Maybe not enough motivation for the staff? Don't know what's up.... However cheddar bay biscuits make life better :-)\n\n--------\nOriginal review posted September 2015 \n\nMy husband and I came here last night for all you can eat shrimp around 6:30pm. The wait for 2 was an hour n a half long so we decided to eat at the bar (no matter what time, this location always has a wait). I usually don't like eating at the bar, but our bartenders were awesome! Before we even ordered we were given the cheesy bay biscuits and waters. Score! We both ordered the all you can eat shrimp and our order came out in less than 15 minutes. We were also provided drink refills no questions asked, which was great because I hate when you sit there with an empty glass and they don't refill it without you asking. \n\nIn addition, there were 2 other couples next to us enjoying all you can eat shrimp. Eventually the bartenders caught on and starting bringing out shrimp by the dozen. Without even ordering another round they would present different shrimp options to us. It truly was all you can eat shrimp!!! It started to become humorous because at one point they brought out more shrimp, but we were all so full and no one wanted it. Needless to say we left full and with boxes of extra shrimp to take home. \n\nThe only reason why I gave this 4 stars over 5 is because we did have slow service once in the dining room, but the food was delicious so no complaints from the food category.", "business_id": "BO0zz8gort7o-6KuecIv3Q", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-09-27", "type": "review"}

WOW then Jeff should explain the 45 minutes we waited for our 8 minute steaks. (keep in mind there was only about 4 tables occupied, including ours, in the whole place)\n\nfinally finished our meals and we would've left $1 tip instead of the $5 bill, but that was the smallest bill we had and we had to leave.

Alexander Michael's is tucked away from the Uptown skyscrapers in the residential section.  You probably wouldn't see it unless you knew it was there.  It looks like it could be just another house on the quiet street.  There are no big signs for it and not a lot of discernable noise from the outside.  \n\nOnce we got inside, though, we saw that it was quite packed.  We were lucky to get seated right away in the crowded room that resembled something of an English or Irish pub.  The lighting was low and the casually dressed crowd was \"older\" than a lot of Uptown bars, so we felt like we fit in with the 30- and 40-somethings. \n\nWe started with a Woodchuck Cider (not everyone carries ciders!) and it was sweet, bubbly, and refreshing.  We enjoyed that our server wasn't overly attentive, but she was there whenever we needed to order and checked up on us only when necessary.  I tried the blackened catfish and my partner had the honey chicken.  Both were delicious.  Mine (accompanied by spicy black beans) had just the right amount of cajun flavor.  And the portion sizes were just right -- not enough to overfill you, but not enough to leave you hungry when you left.  \n\nIt was definitely an enjoyable experience, and I look forward to returning to this new (to me).

When we arrived, at about 5:30, it was still very quiet but began filling up fast (including other tables obviously going to the Carbon Leaf/Big Head Todd and the Monsters concert.) As soon as we walked in a server approached and guided us to a booth. \n\nFood: We started with the Crab meat Supreme Quesadilla app ($7.60). My girlfriend had the 4th Ward Stroganoff ($13.75) and I had the Feta Chicken ($13.95) as entrees. For drinks, she had a Duvel and I had a Hefeweizen and Oktoberfest on tap. \n\nAs for the starter, I was not very impressed with the quesadilla. The menu advertises it has pepper jack cheese but I detected no pepper jack, just regular monterrey jack cheese. Also, I personally got two bites of crab meat (my girlfiend had several). Given the very mild flavors of crab and monterrey jack, this was a very bland quesadilla. Granted, it did come served with sides of sour cream and salsa and I thought the salsa was pretty good. I just would have preferred the actual quesadilla to stand on its own a bit. \n\nFor the stroganoff, my girlfriend really enjoyed it and would have clean-plated it if she wasn't a carb watcher. I did steal a piece of the beef and thought it was very tasty with the red wine definitely coming through. My Feta chicken was also good (how can you go wrong with Feta?) with extra props going to the sauteed veggies that make up bed along with the penne pasta. They consisted of broccoli, mushrooms, red and green peppers and red onions. I thought they were very well cooked and the white wine/garlic saute was very tasty. The chicken itself was good though a touch overcooked but not enough to ruin the plate. Be advised that, as advertised, it does come sitting in a \"broth\" so is a wet dish. \n\nOur meal, including two pre-concert tequila shots ;-) and an appropriate tip, came to about $90 -- not cheap but we did splurge on alcohol a bit. \n\nService: Our service was excellent with our waitress obviously very familiar the menu and restaurant. As a plus, as it got busier two owner/manager types stayed available in the dining area helping out and making sure everyone's visit was up to par. \n\nAtmosphere: This must be one of the big draws as AM is in an old converted house right in the middle of a residential neighborhood. All dark wood with a gorgeous bar, its easy to imagine coming here after work to just hangout for awhile. A couple of HD TV's are present, as well.

It's rare to see restaurants uptown remain open for 27 years, but you'll quickly find out why.  Its a pub with the charm of the Cheers bar (in a converted 100 yr. old house) and food that cannot be called \"grub\".\n\nI visited last week and felt immediately welcome in this cozy tavern. Despite the busyness of that night, we were served promptly  The server was quite friendly; she offered suggestions of her fav dishes and the most commonly ordered ones.  After seeing the positive reviews for the London Broil sandwich, I opted for this sandwich with onion rings.  .   The London Broil sandwich was moist and bursting with flavor, like it was slow cooked.  The onion rings tasted homemade.  My friend ordered the copious bread pudding dessert and found it quite tasty as it was covered in caramel sauce.\n\nI think Alexander Michael's exudes \"chill\" and this is what is so attractive about it.

It truly is a throwback to what I imagine old neighborhood bars were like where yes, everybody did know your name and you always left with a smile on your face. Others have said it here, but I am going to go ahead and reiterate that this spot is truly a gem and all the people inhabiting the 4th Ward of Charlotte are lucky to have it. \n\nWhat makes it so special? Well, as alluded to above, the quaint neighborhood feel of the restaurant itself goes a long way and its impact cannot really be done justice by words--you just have to go there! The staff is welcoming and friendly, and you most certainly are made to feel like a regular (even if you are not like this guy). The few times that I've been here, the tavern is always filled with jovial conversations, laughter, and a real community feeling. \n\nThe food is typical American pub food fare but done extremely well. I've never been disappointed with anything that I've ordered here, nor has anyone that I've come to Al Michael's with. In terms of starters, the spicy crab soup is excellent and the black bean hummus also hits the spot. For your main grub, the ruben, half pound burger, London broil, and quinoa black bean vegetable burger (did I mention they have a surprising number of healthier options?) are staples when we go. The side dish options also bring the goods with choices such as fries, Cajun fries, spicy black beans, or a big ol' baked potato (this option probably gives you the best bang for your buck!). \n\nRight now your taste buds are most likely waking up but you're concerned about what you're going to wash all that delicious food down with. Well, stop your fretting because this spot has a rotating line-up of high quality draft beers with a huge emphasis on North Carolina beers and an even greater emphasis on Charlotte specific brews. Problem solved! On top of that, there is also a full bar and a few selections in the wine department. \n\nOh, and when is the best time to check this spot out? Right before you head out to a Panthers game of course!", "business_id": "ePP0Eqz8JKSbtdt2phiB4A", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-11-18", "type": "review"}

I felt like I had walked into a mans bachelor pad with the black and silver ultra mod vibe. We were seated and given water from back waiters quickly. We discussed the menu, which we had already reviewed online before we picked which restaurant we wanted to try, therefore we knew what we wanted. \n\nWe made a decision on a bottle of wine we wanted which we ordered from the manager. At this point we still had not seen our server. Once the server finally made his way to our table he was very pushy about trying to get us not to eat off the restaurant week menu. It was obvious he was disappointed that we were there to partake in RW. \n\nWe finally made the server understand that we weren't going to do anything over than RW and wine. I ordered the tuna tartare as my starter which took a very long time to reach our table but was delicious. My second course was the Filet (Med Rare) prepared Oscar style with Bearnaise sauce on the side. We waited and waited... Then waited some more. \n\nThere was a large private event which I am assuming took preciseness over us. Even with that being said our server just disappeared!!! I poured my own wine refills. We were sitting there wondering what was taking so long for our steaks and he didn't come by to offer an update. When the steak came out I cut into mine and it was Well Done!!!! My boyfriends steak was also over cooked, he ordered Rare and received MedWell! They took our steaks and then we waited again... Mine comes out covered in Bearnaise sauce!!! I requested sauce on the side because I don't like sauce on my steak, only on the asparagus. Eventually they bring my steal out correct. \n\nWe ate our dinner quickly because of how hungry we were. Very little apology from the staff about the horrible experience. Our table was cleared and the server brings out the dessert which AGAIN was wrong! He rolled his eyes at us when I told him, this isn't our fault that he is getting our order wrong! \n\nEven at the discounted price we paid for Queens Feast we felt robbed. Our server still made good money from us, we never tip poorly but we felt he didn't deserve it. The experience was absolutely horrible and my boyfriend and I vowed to never visit again. \n\nI received an email, from the automated system, asking how our experience was so I wrote the manager telling him about our experience and he never even bothered answering me. \n\nIf you want to enjoy a nice steak dinner take your money to Capital Grille or Flemings!", "business_id": "Lt9o2RmacVY2L-IWLA8uTg", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-11-16", "type": "review"}

There's a good selection of beer both on tap & in bottles. The prices are pretty on par with any bar/restaurant located on Tryon in Charlotte, so I can't really complain here. They also have a couple pool tables, and a lounge upstairs if you want to get out of the main bar scene.\n\nFox & Hound won't blow you away with anything, especially if you're there to watch a game.

We had a party of approx. 10 people. We were seated in the back corner and given plenty of space for our party which was nice, considering it was primetime on a Saturday night.\n\nThat was pretty much when the good things I have to say about the restaurant end. Our server, from beginning to end, was slow. I would post his name, but I don't know if that's against Yelp rules. I ordered a honey dijon chicken sandwich with french fries. The fries were mediocre at best (not hot, plain tasting) and the sandwich was pretty poor. I don't know how you can screw up grilled chicken, cheese, bacon and honey dijon sauce. The bottom of the bun was completely soggy and the sandwich as a whole was bland. Our guest of honor (the birthday girl) ordered a steak which she had to return because it was almost raw inside. She had asked for medium well. Several members of our group DID, however, like their food.\n\nGoing back to the service, several members of our party waited several minutes for drink refills. Also, we had to flag our waiter down for our checks after waiting close to (if not more than) 20 minutes. Even after we gave him our checks and credit cards, he took close to another 10 minutes to bring them back. \n\nOur best guess is that he knew he was adding an 18% gratuity to our checks because of our party size, so he took his time doing everything. I seriously considered crossing out the 18% and leaving 10% and noting on the tab that the service didn't warrant the 18%, but in the end, I opted against it.\n\nDefinitely will not return.", "business_id": "ym9QwkmB5ZKTyj7q5huTDw", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-11-20", "type": "review"}

The bright red signage makes it easy to spot (we parked at the 7th St garage and it was a short walk).  Surprisingly when we arrived at 5:45, there was already a 30 minute wait (Bobcats game, Panthers game tomorrow, a few other \"events\" in addition to the small venue concert that we were going to were going on).  But true to what the hostess said, exactly 30 minutes later our buzzer buzzed.  \n\nLovely restaurant, although very dark.  And when walking to the restroom, I though I was being led out into an alley, it's a hike.  Wide selection of menu items, it was hard to decide what to get.  Comfy seating. \n\nWe decided on the Jalapeno Spinach Cheese Dip which is served with tortillas to start with.  It was DELICIOUS.  Creamy and cheesy, the tortilla chips held up to dipping without breaking and they weren't overly salted.  The dip had a little bit of a kick to it without being overwhelming.  Very good start.\n\nI ordered the 2:00 am burger, which is a burger topped with a fried egg, cheese and bacon, with a hashbrown underneath and mac n' cheese as a side (mac n' cheese is an upgrade from the fries side, so you'll be charged a buck for this - it says it clearly on the menu, so no big...).  The burger was meh - not bad by any means, but lacking flavor.  I ended up asking for some ketchup to try and do something to it.  The bun held up well to all of the toppings though, so I didn't even up with a soggy mess on my plate that I would need to eat with a knife and fork, so points for that.  The mac n' cheese was very good.  Nothing fancy, but well done.  \n\nThe food was more of a 3.5, but our waitress was amazing, great service even with a packed house, so I will go with a 4.

Another review, and this time from the well known Rock Bottom in downtown Charlotte. I came here with a friend who wanted some of their beer as well as their food. And sadly, I wasn't impressed. Inside though they completely changed the outlay of the dining area from the last time I came here, which was about 2 years ago... They added ramps as well as new things to look at and admire, such as the glass between booths and some paintings. But, overall it's all the same with the looks and what not.\n\nI had two things from the menu: Fish Tacos (RB Taco) and the Southwestern Chili.\n\nNow, the good first. Southwestern Chili. It was awesome, I felt like it was very good and chunky. However, I wish the portion was just a wee bit bigger just because it was so tasty!\n\nAnother plus was the service. My friend ordered a steak and it was a little overcooked, the waiter completely understood and took it back to get another steak cooked medium rare. It was fast and I believe even the manager came up to fix the problem. They offered a soup or whatever, but my friend declined (I was wondering why he didn't get me another chili!)\n\nNow the bad. Eating the Fish Tacos was like grabbing a handful of seasoned salt and then eating it. Every single bite was just a burst of not just salt, but just sodium with a little heat kicked in, but that was probably from the amount of salt and it made it seem spicier. After drinking water, it was still stuck in my mouth. Kick back the salt Rock Bottom and pull out that flavor of the fish! After all, it is a fish taco.\n\nOverall, not bad, food is average. Service is pretty good though. Next time though, I'm sticking away from those tacos.", "business_id": "ym9QwkmB5ZKTyj7q5huTDw", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-11-27", "type": "review"}

This was a very poor impression by getting the cops involved and not being able to handle this while my group was still in the restaurant and the cops informing my group that we would be all going to jail if a $120 tab was not paid. \nPointers for Andrea the \"manager\" communicate directly with your clients about open tabs left before calling the cops. Learn how to manage the floor to close out the bill since everyone at the table is no longer ordering. And last calling the cops to resolve issues you should handle yourself should be your last resort if the group left the restaurant already. \nSeriously, these were our VIP Japanese colleagues and we did not come to Charlotte North Carolina to get a free meal... There are no free meals in America Andrea! \nAnd if you fear about losing your job because you couldn't manage the floor to close out tabs... Then you don't belong in management! \nWe will never come back here for any meals on our next convention and maybe be corporate will not care about it... Maybe they will....\nBottom line is #Rockbottombrewery will never have any of my business or my colleagues business of patronism ever again when we come back to Charlotte, NC ever! \nI wouldn't even give this place a star for this reason!", "business_id": "ym9QwkmB5ZKTyj7q5huTDw", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-09-13", "type": "review"}

We went to this Stool Pigeons on Church to watch Sunday football and were told that Mich Ultra and Bud Light were on special for $2.25. We're not picky beer drinkers, we would have enjoyed the Bud Lights just as much as the Ultras, we just wanted the cheapest beer because we were drinking a lot. So we start to order buckets after buckets of beer. It started out with 3 Bud Lights and 2 Mich Ultras and then the last bucket somehow ended up being all Mich Ultras. Well of course, when we get the bill, we find out why the waitress was bringing us so many Mich Ultras in comparison to Bud Lights. Mich Ultras were $3.75 a PIECE (not on special like she told us), which is absolutely insanely overpriced for a domestic beer anyway and the Bud Lights were $2.25. She was trying to get the bill higher for a bigger tip by lying and telling us that something was on special and it wasn't. I'm a waitress, I know how this stuff works (although I'm at least an honest up-seller, not a deceitful one.) The bill was over $100 for 25 beers, Nachos (which were not actually nachos, they were cheap veggies thrown on top of about 7 tortilla chips with tater tots underneath. Yes, tater tots. What is that?!), and wings. \n\nShe tried to argue with us about the prices and what she did or did not say, something about the special not counting towards the buckets? Who knows what the hell she was talking about, the girl obviously needed to get her info straight. So we of course ask for the manager who comes over to tell us that we drank them and we had to pay the $3.75 a pop. We were pissed needless to say. The manager actually ROLLED HIS EYES-SEVERAL times and was YELLING at us. I was stunned. He actually yelled at us. Funny thing is, I'm a business major, currently in school and we are learning (even though, common sense) that customer satisfaction is key. Had the manager given us the lower price, they wouldn't have even lost anything because we all know that a Mich Ultra in the store is barely more than $1, so they are still profiting from us. We would have been HAPPY customers, willing to come back since this is a regular Sunday occurrence. But now, we're so ridiculously angry, it was the worse experience at a restaurant EVER. The waitress and the manager were rude and stupid. I guess you can't expect much from sports bars like that anyway. Uneducated morons run the place. \n\nI hope the owner of this restaurant is reading this. Maybe you'll learn something. If a SERVER makes a mistake, you don't make the customer pay for it. Even if the mistake is the customer's, you still don't make them pay for it. It's called good customer service. It's what will keep people coming back. Ever heard \"The customer is always right\" ???? (Even though we were, something like that would have never happened where I work) Now, we will not EVER be back here, nor will we bring any of our 10-15 people Sunday crowd, and we will tell everyone how awful of an experience we had here which will cost you money.

Omelets, waffles. eggs your style, hasbrowns, and all the usual breakfast meats. While I usually skip the meat, I do appreciate the fact that turkey sausage is always an option.  Service is speedy and the ladies who constantly walk around will make sure your drink never goes empty or that your coffee always stays refreshed- no matter if they took your order or someone else did.  Now that's some customer service.  \n\nAnother thing I really like is that they recycle newspapers from earlier guests.  I can usually find several whole local papers stacked up in a central location to be read and returned as \"community paper.\"  I can get caught up on the affairs of the day and pass it on.\n\nWhat you'll really love here is that the prices are so easy on the wallet.

The smallish 11 oz  prime rib is $20 and comes with only one side. Keep in mind that  prime rib is ALWAYS very fatty, I trim about 1/3 rd of it.  What was left was less than 1/2 pound. Worse is that I asked for the fried sweet potato and it's now the frozen, pre-seasoned fast food type where it used to be simply real potato. \n\nThe prime rib was as rare as I asked but -as it's often the case- the chef had rubbed way too much salt on the slab before cooking it and there's no desalting it. Most people do like it prepared that way but what about those who don't or who have to cut their sodium intake? \n\nIt's way too obvious that it's a franchise and management cuts way too many corners for the prices they charge. Physically it's still the same location but the food is like Orlando, FL.\n\nThen I think about the Texas Roadhouse. I hate that type of theme restaurants with peanuts, overly cheery (and overly young) servers ... but know what? For those same $20 I got a large 16 oz prime rib every bit as good or better as Harper's, a couple of decent sides ( the sweet potato was baked but it was a fresh potato) they threw free appetizers at me and we drank five buck Margaritas or Martinis. \n\nSo the place is messy, full of kids and has no class but the economy is tough these days.

It was just ok.  The chicken looked like it had been shrunk...it was pretty dry.  It was basically like what you would get in a frozen fajita meal.  You know how the chicken is small, salty and fatty?  The lettuce was chopped but dry and looked like it came straight out of a bag.  The cucumbers, red peppers and onions that were supposed to be in the salad must have been playing hide n seek.  I think I had one piece of each.\n\nOthers are my table tried another steak salad, blackened chicken pasta and the burger.  Everyone pretty much had the same response...\"just ok.\"  In fact, my friend tried to justify her reasoning for choosing Harper's by saying, \"wow, I haven't been here in so long.

I thought that was super classy because we didn't even have to bring it to their attention.  I can't complain about something that was free but I'll let you know we tried the warm cookie that came with vanilla ice cream.\n\n\nI know Harper's is a family favorite for so many so I don't want to burst any bubbles and I can see why people like it.  They have a diverse menu, nice atmosphere for couples or for families, nice location, etc.  They aren't super expensive but I don't think they are priced right for their quality but that's just my opinion.  Overall, I stand by my 3 star rating...they are just \"a-ok.\"", "business_id": "hIQRiE3UsYH7UsrsDwJwLA", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-11-12", "type": "review"}

Their menu is timeless as is their history in the South park area.  Yes but try telling that to the hostess who greets you by chewing gum and texting on her phone.   Yeah, I get it, sometimes you just got to get your tweet on, I agree, OMG LOL, I can't believe this guy who just came in here to get his to go order, #LMFAO.   Now don't be discouraged to dine in and sit in the bar area, where if you truly want to feel disconnected from your date, then the touch screen monitors are perfect, for you or the hostess.  After all who sits and talks with each other at dinner any more? The food is on par with an Americana type mid level restaurant, however the service leaves a bit to be desired.  When my salad came with a dried up crusted chicken breast on it and no dressing, I called to speak to a manager, but they were busy. Apparently a Tuesday night is busy for the manager (not the hostess).  The veggie burger tastes like cardboard, although the bun gives it a sort of layered cardboard effect which is not bad, if you're washing it down with tequila.  The filet even if ordered med. rare, comes out med. edible, and asking the wait staff for a refill is like asking the DMV for an estimated wait time; you're probably not going to get what you're looking for.   This is particularly sad because I used to love this restaurant, but even with prepubescent couples or online match dates who sit in the bar area to have the touch screen monitors mediate their awkward conversations,  it's still probably not the right fit.   The ribs are good, but the sides aren't.  If I was going to take anybody here, it would have to be my next door neighbor who lets their dog crap all over my lawn and never picks it up, or my grandfather who doesn't have any taste buds left and isn't bothered by slow service, because it takes him two hours to finish a bowl of soup anyway.

My boyfriend and I just had dinner here and it was such a fantastic experience that I hopped on here immediately to write a review on the drive home. I mean, it was FANTASTIC. \n\nWe only waited about 5 minutes to be seated (LOVE when that happens on a busy Saturday night) \n\nThen, the best part of the evening, our waitress came by. Brianna was her name and she was absolutely wonderful. She knew everything about every item on the menu, and was just beyond pleasant. Seriously, servers make or break my dining experience in most cases, and she definitely made it. Next time we go, (I'm not kidding) I'm going to ask that they seat us in her section if she's there. She's THAT amazing.  \n\nIt was like she was reading my mind when she asked if I was interested in trying the daily soup (potato cheddar) because I REALLY wanted to try it but didn't want a bowl of soup. She brought me an adorable little cup of soup and OH MAN it was good. It was creamy, just a little spicy, and had the perfect amount of crunchy little scallions to add some texture. Then, the real food came out. My boyfriend got the brisket which comes with your choice of BBQ - vinegar based Eastern Sauce, or ketchup based Western Sauce. He chose Eastern, and it was SO good. The brisket was cooked to perfection and he devoured the mashed potatoes and slaw he got for sides. My burger was REDONK. I mean, I ordered a burger, so I expected just a burger. I read the menu and saw that it had a Hickory BBQ sauce and cabbage, so I thought, \"yum, BBQ burger\" but I was NOT prepared for the deliciousness that graced my palette. I can't even describe how this burger tasted. They found some kind of magical combination of flavors that had me going \"oh my..\" in between every bite. I know it sounds ridiculous to say so many things about a burger, but I am so serious. Then, my boyfriend ordered a cappuccino (which Brianna made herself), and he loved it. \n\nNow, you guys know what the atmosphere is like so there's no point going into too much detail. It's awesome. I absolutely love being in this restaurant. The lighting is intimate but abundant and the tables are perfectly sized and spaced. Table spacing is a HUGE bullet point for me, and I have never been unhappy with a table here. \n\nOverall, the food was ridiculously above par (even better than the other times I've been here), and I am SO glad we got Brianna as our waitress.

The potato pancakes were pretty good, but not the best I've had.  The turkey sausage and pancakes, on the other hand, were the best I've had in Charlotte.  In my experience, turkey sausage is just something that restaurants keep on hand to please their selective customers (again, this is South Park we're talking about), but I actually feel like the Original Pancake House cared about the quality of even their more obscure ingredients.  As for the pancakes, they were simply the best I've had, which says a lot considering I'm not a huge fan of pancakes in general.\n\nThis filling lunch was well worth my $8.

Of course I didn't think of the fact that at 10ish it's packed with people who just finished the cancer walk (the confusing part is this is not the closest one to uptown...).  I was pretty impressed with the quick turnover of the tables.\n\nThe menu is big (literally and figuratively).  They don't offer the typical breakfast combo of eggs, meat, toast/biscuit, hushbrown/grits. But you bet it that pancakes come with almost everything. I ended up with the corned beef hash breakfast, which come with 2 eggs and pancakes.  I love mixing my corned beef hash with grits, so I had to order a side of grits (boooo!).  My sweet tooth of a boyfriend ordered an oven baked apple pancake with chocolate chips added.  It's way more exciting to write about his food... that thing is huge and thick, and it doesn't look like a pancake at all.  More like bread pudding or something.  It's not too sweet, but sweet enough that you don't have to put syrup if you don't want to.  He managed to finish it (with a little help from me).  I swear I don't know how he stays so freaking tiny.  My breakfast on the other hand was ok.  The corned beef hash was not as salty as others.  The pancakes weren't as good as I would have expected from a place named \"Original Pancake House.\"  It's a little mushy if I have to say.\n\nI do have to say I wasn't happy with the service at first.  The lady wasn't exactly friendly.  I was without silverwares for longer that I should.  I know this place was crowded, but it's always crowded, so that's not good enough of a reason. But oh well...

In my pre-gluten-free life, I would have really enjoyed the extensive beer selection. They probably had 75-80 beers available. Saucers hung throughout the restaurant celebrate those who have successfully tasted 200 beers at Flying Saucer. OK. I might be off on the number. I think it was 200. I could be wrong.\n\nSince I was unable to enjoy the wide selection of normal beer, I settled for the gluten-free Lakefront New Grist beer. Not bad. It's no Belgian white, but it wasn't bad at all.\n\nThe German plate with two brats was delicious. I love a good sauerkraut with a brat, and Flying Saucer definitely hit the mark on both.\n\nMore importantly, the wait staff was great.

There was a wheat beer on special so I immediately ordered that without even looking at who brewed it. It was delish so I drank that the rest of the night. My husband ordered various beers throughout the night. They have so many beers on tap! We are huge microbrewery fans and love to support local breweries....so we usually stick to the NC ones (Lonerider, Natty Greens, NODA, etc, etc, etc). \n\nThe food is basically German with some American dishes. We ordered the soft pretzals with beer cheese. We have ordered this many times in the past and new it was a winner. Dang those pretzals are awful for you but so good. The beer cheese is some of the best we ever tasted AND we recently went to Germany! \n\nSpent the evening drinking beer, watching football, and playing darts. It was great!

I will be filing complaints to the BBB, health department, and whom ever will listen (or watch the videos). I have a Video of all of the following. Your bartender completely ignoring our party of two, as we are speaking directly too her, and her making us repeat ourselves 3 times and still didn't answer our question. I confronted her about her lack of attention and being disrespectful. She stated it was busy and that other people needed her attention too we weren't the only people there. There were 6 people total sitting at the bar including our party. Even then she continued to have her conversation with the manager about (Facebook, instagram ect.) One of the employees at the establishment knew my friend who I had come to pick up from there. She (the employee) left without paying her tab. The bar tender proceeded to tell us that someone needed to pay it and it wasn't going to be coming out of her money. I explained to the bartender that if she made an arrangement for her co worker to come back and pay that is not our responsibility. After about ten min of conversation and the bartender speaking to us like we were animals I asked to speak to the manager. The bartender refused to close out my friends tab until either her co worker came back or we paid for her drinks. The manager never came, the bartender continued to be excessively rude. Slamming things around ect. Finally after being stuck in your establishment against our will for 45 min with the manager no where in sight.. the employee who left her tab open arrived. On the way back from using the filthy restroom, with a hole in the wall where there used to be a urinal and the sink that looked like a crew of diesel mechanics came through, I saw the manager on my way back to the front of the restaurant. I stopped and asked her if she was the manager. She was in the process of asking the cook to make her food stating. \"You know I'm a good person ill pay you back.\" Also at this point the employee who had left is now standing there and so is the bartender. I asked to speak with her and ask her if this was normal practice for your bartender to say to a guest who has never been to the establishment before (or even someone that knew the employee) has to pay for an employees drink who walked out on there tab. After I said that I had never visited the establishment before the bartender who is standing to the side says \"YES YOU HAVE\" and I again told her that I had not at which point she has thrown her arms in the air and storms away. At that same time the cook who the manager was just bribing sticks his head out of a service window and says (he also sounded intoxicated) \"I've heard him being very disrespectful the entire time\". Now don't get me wrong I was not very pleased that we were forced to stay there while the bartender withheld my friends credit card, but i was not disrespectful. At that point I had informed the manager that I had been recording this circus act unfolding in front of me. Her response was \"awesome\". As she sputtered making no sense something about the bartender and it being her friend, she proceeded to tell me \"I didn't have time for this or you right now, I appreciate that so go back and watch your video\". And walked away. I've tried to explain in the best of my ability what had transpired that night but the videos are unbelievable. I will never again visit a Baileys, I frequent Fox and Hound regularly with work functions and your bartenders there are less than favorable but bearable. I would appreciate a rapid response to this issue, preferably a phone call, and I never want anyone to have to deal with such barbaric people as my friend and I have. You might want to think about new staff. Especially the manager stealing food from your company.

Although the parking lot was full (I had to wait for a car to leave before I was able to park), we were able to find a table immediately on entering.\n\nThe inside is well decorated, clean, and inviting.  We were approached fairly quickly by our server, who asked for our drink orders.  We needed a few minutes to peruse the beers on tap listing.  From that point on, our experience was unbelievably bad.\n\nIt took us all of 2 minutes to figure out our drink preferences, but it was 10 minutes before our server returned.  She took our drink order and would have left straight-away, but we stopped her and asked for potato cakes as an appetizer, as we were famished.  It was 20 minutes later that the appetizers arrived, and we had to ask the runner where our drinks were.  5 minutes later, they appeared.\n\nWe were completely done with our appetizers (and still hungry) when our server finally returned and asked (in an incredulous tone) if we wanted to order dinner.  If you're not keeping track, I'll remind you that we've now been at McHale's for 40 minutes!  We ordered fish and chips (for me) and a veggie sandwich (for the wife), thinking that would be among the quicker-to-prep items on the menu.\n\nIt took just over 30 minutes for the food to arrive.  At least it was hot.  The fish was fine -- standard pub-style cod -- but the fries on both of our plates were only the end pieces, as though they had run out of full-figured fries and were dredging the bottom of the bag to find something to serve.  They were all crisp, no potato, and no flavor.  My wife's veggie sandwich was very plain.\n\nI'll spare you the remaining saga, but I'll bet you can guess that it was more of the same as it took us one hour and fifty minutes before we had paid our tab and were able to leave.  I understand that sometimes  as a table you end up in a perfect storm of minor mishaps, and I would never give up on a restaurant for that alone.  But through all of this, our server only showed up at our table 4 times, and was dour and terse to boot.  \n\nWe were in no rush.  In fact, we had planned on taking our time so we could enjoy the live music.  But poor service ruled the day.

My 2 rating is due to the following reasons 1) my husband and I went to watch NFL kickoff last Sunday.  Ordered our beer and then attempted to order our food.  I said attempt because they didn't have much to offer.  Every time we made a selection it was either 86 or a component was 86. The explaination we were given was it was very busy Friday night and ran out of stuff - hello it is now Sunday afternoon. You are advertising watching the games at your location.  I pointed out that there is a grocery store within walking distance.  The reply was the owners won't let us buy anything.  I ordered shepards pie which is supposed to be a meat potato and veggie dish. When it showed up at the table it had at least 1/2inch of melted cheese on top a fact not mentioned in the description. After scraping that off I proceeded to dig in. Unfortunately the dish was made with less than an ounce of meat alittle bit of peas and corn and a pile of potatoes. I had the honor of paying $10 for that.  2) OK everyone can have a bad day so we returned this Sunday.  Once again they were out of things but not as bad as last week.  I ordered a specialty burger for $11 Safe right?  Wrong. It came out as any basic burger would except for the fact that the actual patty looked liked someone took a bite out of it.  I called the server over to show her the burger and to ask where the special burger was - her reply - it looks like someone bit into it.  When I asked about the bun vs bagel - oh we don't have those anymore!  There is much more that I can say but this is already a novel. Long story short. The food sucks and we will not return.  One other thing when I told our server about our experience last week she stated that she served an English guy that complained that the shepards pie was the worse he ever ate - I agree.

Many places take advantage of the simplicity by rushing things along.  You end up with edible but uninspired eats.  Though my breakfast arrived shortly after it was ordered, it was cooked properly and with care.  My sunny side up eggs were perfectly done, the whites well set and the yolks warm but properly runny.

I could almost like eating breakfast out, if every place served breakfast like this.\n\nService was fast and friendly.  Coffee was the usual diner style, weak and plentiful.  The bar looked capable of producing a solid bloody mary, but alas this went untested.  Prices were as cheap as the day is long.

Unfortunately, that's about all it has to offer, unless you enjoy food that is extremely greasy, and of mediocre quality.\n\nDetailed review: Our fish fry crew decided to give Stamm House a try after we'd read good things about it on a fairly well known fish fry review website.  Normally, those guys (the reviewers) are pretty spot on, but they've completely missed the mark when it comes to the Stamm House.  Not even close to being a top-10 place, no way, no how.\n\nWe sauntered in to the Stamm House at around 5:45 on Friday night and were shocked to find the place darned-near empty.  The bartender greeted us immediately - very friendly guy - we ordered a couple of New Glarus Nakeds and a Spotted Cow.  After downing the first round, we went to order a refill, and whoops - Naked went empty, and there wasn't any more left.  Drat.\n\nAfter downing a second round of beers (Cows all around this time), it dawned on us that we probably needed to inquire about a table.  So, we wandered upstairs where a friendly lady told us she'd have an opening at around 6:45 or 7:00.  Odd, the place was empty... but, we took it and went back downstairs.\n\nWe ordered some cheese curds and the onion rings.  The bartender warned us ahead of time that the curds were \"standard-from-the-bag\" curds, but said the rings were hand-battered and delicious.  They arrived quickly, and once again, the bartender was spot-on with his description.\n\nThe curds were Sysco curds and were not cooked well at all.  I don't think the fryer was hot enough, because these curds were drenched in grease - so much so that we couldn't eat them.  Disgusting.  And the ranch dipping sauce was like water... you know what they say about oil and water... \n\nThe rings were decent, but again - the grease was ridiculous.  It really made for a bad first impression.  So, we ordered some Whiskey Old Fashioned Sours to help cut through the grease film that was sitting so heavily on our palettes.  \n\nOur table was ready by 7:00-ish, and much to our surprise, when we went upstairs this time, the place was packed.  Where those people came from, and how they got up there without us noticing remains a mystery... our waitress stopped promptly, checked our drinks, and took our order - fried perch all the way around with hash browns on the side.\n\nDinner salads came first and were nice; fairly fresh, fairly tasty, and just the right size.  Fish came out slightly later - served family style - along with our hash browns.  First bite of the fish?  UGH - it tasted awful.  Extremely fishy flavor (and I love fish).  Think \"stinky NJ ocean shore line flavor\" - not delicate, flavorful, flaky, and enjoyable.  No sir, this was the nightmarishly bad fish that we all remember from our grade school days - you know, the stuff that was about 2-3 days away from being used as feed for the sea lions at the zoo  \n\nSo, we doused it with lemon and gave it another go - and once again, the fish was so overpoweringly fishy that we reached for the (gasp!) ketchup.  That helped a bit, but it still wasn't an enjoyable fish fry.  The fish was cooked well - not too greasy, and it was breaded rather than battered.  If only it weren't so obscenely fishy...   \n\nHash browns were tasty - fried nicely (crisp and tasty).  Service was fantastic - our waitress was fun, helpful, and did a great job of checking in with us.  Total bill for three with a round or two of drinks was $45-ish.\n\nStamm House = FAIL\n\nFood: 1 star (grease, grease everywhere; horrible fish fry)\nService: 4.5 stars \nValue: 3 stars\n\n\nSummary: waaaaay too greasy + waaaaaay too fishy fish = fail.", "business_id": "IEmqrFe96NOhU07TA0rZdw", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-09-20", "type": "review"}

I thought I'd head east and come here for lunch since I didn't find anything better. Years ago, this used to be a place called Stockade and I loved it. Now it's a Badgers/Packers bar and grill. \n\nVisible from I-90, just west of Madison, there's a cheese place (Mouse Haus I believe) and warehouses for Pepsi and Walgreen's nearby. The Rodeside Grill resembles a log cabin style fort from the outside. Years ago, this place used to be called Stockade.\n\nOnce inside, it's quite spacious with high ceilings and an all wood interior, except for the tile on the floor. The whole place looks very clean, not grungy and aged like so many bars in Wisconsin. I sat down to eat at the bar. All along the bar counter, there were blurbs and excerpts of Packers and Badgers accomplishments underneath the laminated countertop. The place even had green-colored ductwork, so I knew I was deep in Packers territory.\n\nA big screen TV aired game highlights from the Packers-Saints NFL season opener from the day before. Large men with mustaches came in for lunch, typical Wisconsin body types. I kept a low profile and my Chicago origin and calmly requested the Friday fish fry special. Having traveled up north on many occasions, this wasn't the first time I was surrounded by Packer fans. It's not hard to deal with them if you don't disclose where you're from and stick to the menu items or make a positive comment about Jordy Nelson being an awesome rising star on the team.\n\nThe fish arrived in a few minutes and it came with a side of fries that were seasoned and coated - quite tasty in fact. Coleslaw is also a can't-miss item north of Illinois and this place has it right too. I found the meal quite enjoyable. The bartender got me another iced tea and then spent a few more minutes of admiring the place. The Packers highlights gave way to NASCAR on the TV, but I was on my way, 150 miles from Chicago once again.\n\nWhile I went for the fish, Rodeside also has some good burgers, from what I saw around me at lunch that day. Worth a stop on your way to the Dells or Lodi for that matter. Just leave the Bears stuff in the car.", "business_id": "O_Pu4mKGOqQVlmH07Zbnhg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-09-21", "type": "review"}

I don't know the east side of town all that well but I do know that I like the Ale Asylum A LOT.  I seem to be successful in getting everyone to go there about 25% of the time; otherwise we end up at the Sports Pub.  I've spent quite a few nights here and I can't really say I've ever had a good time.  If I could I'd rate this 2.5 stars, because really this place isn't that bad.  It's just that there are so many places with better beer, nicer bartenders, friendlier crowds and better food.  Every time I've gone to the Sports Pub there have been good aspects of my experience, but something always goes wrong and I leave with a bad impression of the place.  \n\nThe first time, several years back, I remember having a really tasty burger, but the pitcher of Capital had little bits of gunk floating in it and the bartender tried to blame that on me.  That was enough for me to cross it off my list, but my friend really likes the place and I've been back multiple times since.  Last weekend, for example, we went for the second half of the Badger game.  It was crowded to be sure, but the service was good and my sandwich was pretty decent.  Unfortunately this was marred by the fact that we could not see a television from where the table was positioned, which kind of defeated the purpose of going to a sports bar.  I also got into a ridiculous argument with some drunk at the bar over something trivial, and I spent the rest of the afternoon hearing him loudly talk about me from across the bar.  Again, that's not really the fault of the Sports Pub but I just can't seem to have a nice time at this place.\n\nThe menu is actually pretty broad, with traditional bar food done up right.  The appetizers are the standard fare, and the spicy curly fries are really tasty.  The tap selection is on the low side of OK.  There's usually a Capital and Spotted, and aside from the aforementioned incident I haven't had a major problem with quality.  There's a foosball table near the door where I once schooled a plastered townie five games in a row before hubris got the better of me and I was resounding beaten by his girlfriend.  There are outdoor volleyball courts and leagues during the summer.  I'm sure that if I lived near this place I'd probably find it a nice local hangout.  But I don't, and every time I've made the trip over from Middleton I end up regretting the experience.  I just can't recommend the place, though I'm pretty sure that I'll find myself back there in the not so distant future.  Maybe then it won't be so bad, but I'm not holding my breath.", "business_id": "qQvpS262VPEHKZvM6j5uhQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2008-10-02", "type": "review"}

I went there with a friend and business partner I have known for years.\n\nThe non-alcoholic \"tropical\" drink selection had a variety of maybe 10 drinks and they all sounded good.  I had an \"Island Paradise\" - Pineapple and coconut complemented with pomegranate grenadine and a splash of Sprite.  It was very good.\n\nWe ordered a quesadilla appetizer and it was pretty tasty.  There was plenty of chicken, cheese, and vegetables between the tortillas and the portion was just right for us.\n\nWe decided that we would both order something different so that we could share and try other foods on the menu.\n\nI ordered the \"El Cubano\" a traditional Cuban sandwich, made with ham, cheese, roasted pork, pickle and mustard all pressed inside two slices of Cuban bread.  It was average at best.  My friend ordered the BBQ Cheddar Burger and it was excellent.  The burger is just as it sounds, consisting of a bun, beef patty, BBQ sauce cheddar cheese, lettuce and tomatoes, with fried onions.  He gave me half and it was a lot better than the sandwich I ordered.  I did not even finish my half of the Cuban.  My sandwich did come with sweet potato chips which were pretty good.  I am not usually a fan of sweet potato but found myself munching on these chips.\n\nI don't know much about Jimmy Buffett, but the name of this place is actually the title of one of his songs.  There are 38 locations in 17 states, all in places very far from Hawaii.  Maybe it isn't supposed to be like Hawaii, but I feel like it looks like what Hawaii might be envisioned by someone who has never been.  There was no version of the burger made with pineapple slices and teriyaki sauce...but maybe that's because Buffett supposedly wrote \"Cheeseburger in Paradise\" in the Carribbean...which changes everything.  Maybe that's why they serve the Cubano, which was still subpar at best.\n\nOverall, the food was satisfactory.  If I am ever in town again or happen to pass by a Cheeseburger in Paradise, I might go back because the drinks are good and the burgers are yummy.  It is a decent meal that won't break your wallet, but take a hint by the restaurant's name and order a cheeseburger.  WWJBD...what would Jimmy Buffett do?

Most days the food is tasty if unimaginative, they can accommodate groups, and they usually can get you in and out pretty quick despite the lobby being packed to the gills on weekend mornings. \n\nFor the last few years I've avoided Perkins on the whole because of sub-par food and service from another location (an annual stop after a camping music festival due to their being open on holidays and ability to seat 10-12 of us with no reservation), but my man friend really likes their breakfast and, more specifically, not having to wait for breakfast like you do at most places downtown. Over the summer I had an avocado/queso/english muffin creation that actually really surprised me with how good it was and breakfast potatoes that were clearly deep fried but similarly surprising in how much I enjoyed them. The breakfast combo price was right ($8ish dollars), and for some reason one of the available sides was a muffin, so I came away with breakfast the next day, too. \n\nFast forward to a couple weeks ago when we stopped back in. Sadly, my breakfast find had disappeared from the menu and they appear to have done away with the bonkers muffin side. Nothing was really striking my fancy on the most recent menu, so I decided to pick one of the most ridiculous offerings, an apple cinnamon muffin that was sliced into thirds and turned into french toast. I'm sure it was terrible for me, and while the flavor was surprisingly good, muffins just aren't stable enough to hold up to being battered and so it was kind of mushy mess. Compounding my meh meal was the fact that it took close to 40 minutes for our food to arrive, tracking down our server was difficult, and my appetite was put off by how dirty the ledge under our booth was. We were seated in one of their tiny (but cool) two-person booths along the window and with the morning sun pouring in I could see all the crumbs, bits of paper, and rusty bobby pins on the window sill. If anyone from Perkins happens to read this, please, please clean that up. The fact that the pins were rusty tells me it's been awhile since a vacuum has made its way to that area. Yuck. \n\nWhile my most recent visit was definitely a two-star experience, they've been just fine on other visits so I'll leave my overall rating at a three. Not the best choice in Madison, but a reliable stand-by\u00a0on the whole.", "business_id": "yYIEKwgQUHJpySOcVdCAkg", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-11-10", "type": "review"}

I went there a couple of weeks ago and when we walked in not one person said hi to us, and the lady behind the counter was on the store phone (understandable) but after she got off the phone she just walked away...another worker came up near the Counter to ring someone out & still said nothing to us.

I had to raise my voice to let her know we had been there first and had been waiting several minutes. I went there again 2 days ago. My friend got her food about 10 minutes before I got mine & the waiter had just walked past setting the food on the table without even asking if she needed anything else right away. She had no silverware and our waiter then disappeared for 10 minutes until he brought my food, at which point her food had gotten cold. She was able to tell him we needed silverware when he dropped off my food, but took several minutes to bring it back to the table and then did the same thing he did before-set it on the table and walked away. All my food was cold besides my eggs, and my toast was cold, hard, and only one piece had been buttered. When we told one of the waitresses we wanted to talk to a manager (because our waiter was MIA once again) the manager came over and listened to our complaints and then said \"Oh well someone ordered toast with no butter so yours had to be remade\" and then walked away.

Well, we all have to eat somewhere, why not Monty's? The first time I laid eyes on this joint, it was a few weeks ago after skipping dinner and going to Bo Burnham. I wondered if it was a bar or a restaurant, a week later, I found out that it's kind of both! It's a classic diner that happens to serve alcohol. I ordered and enjoyed the mushroom and swiss, but I came in on a mission. To order a burger. Their menu almost distracted me from my mission by offering breakfast all day. Oh, I shall return to conquer the idea of Breakfast for Dinner another time!\n\nWaffle fries! need I say more on this topic? Well, its Yelp, so yes. Just the right amount of crispy and not too many. I also managed a dessert on my first visit, that portion size of the Oat Fudge Bar was enough for me to have skipped the fries or the burger, it was huge! Sadly there were nuts mixed in (personal preference), but that didn't stop me.\n\nI didn't opt-in for a shake, but I should have.

But none of the flavors that should've been present stood out. The salty bacon was lost in the grease of the bread. There may not have been any tomato.

The atmosphere is delightful, food is well curated and prepared, and the prices are very affordable. Easily the most well rounded \"American roots\" style breakfast we've had around town so far.\n\nWe ended up at Monty's on a Saturday morning after the farmer's market because we didn't want to wait for a table at any of the downtown options. We walked in and immediately got a seat at the bar. If you're a Yelper make sure you check in to get a free bottomless coffee!\n\nFor a main course I ordered the sweet potato hash, which came with assorted fruit, a biscuit, and eggs cooked to your liking (scrambled with copious amounts of cheese please). The was cooked to perfection with just the right about of browning on it. The eggs were not wet or overcooked. The biscuit and fruit, well, you can't really mess that up. They were great too! The coffee was about what I expected from a diner. It wasn't Starbucks (don't you dare have that expectation, you Yelper-McSnooty face), but it got the job done.\n\nOur service wasn't AMAZING, but it was acceptable. The diner was absolutely slammed at the time because it was brunch hour so I'll let it slide. I wasn't left waiting long enough that I was hangry, and my coffee was always topped off. As far as I'm concerned service gets a check-mark in satisfactory from me.\n\nWe enjoyed the meal so much that we returned Sunday morning for brunch with an out of town friend. The second meal I had almond milk French toast with cinnamon swirl bread. The toast was perfectly dipped and not soggy with the right level of crunch to it. Unfortunately, I was still quite hungry after this plate. The portion size seemed much smaller than that of the hash the day before.\n\nI am looking forward to my return trips to Monty's for brunch, but we absolutely need to come back to try the pumpkin bourbon cocktail shake!

It took me almost 5 months to get here which is kind of unfortunate, because it is GREAT!\n\nThe first thing I was told about Monty's was that it is like an upscale diner that serves vegan and vegetarian food.  This is kind of true, because it is a diner, it is nice inside and not super divey and you can order lots of dishes as vegan, vegetarian, or gluten-free.  However, I would definitely not describe Monty's as a vegan/vegetarian restaurant because half of the items contain eggs or bacon, as any good diner should.\n\nThe first time I went I ordered blueberry pancakes, the short stack, and a simple glass or orange juice.  I passed on the free bottomless cup of coffee that you get when you check in because I had already had my coffee for the day.  The pancakes were good, nothing fancy, but solid.  Two was plenty for me as they were a large-ish size.\n\nSecond time I ordered the Monty's breakfast sandwich which had bacon, avocado, fried egg, herbed goat cheese, and something leafy I think on cheddar jalepeno bread.  It was served with their American potatoes which remind me of the potatoes I got at Grampas brunch.  The sandwich was tasty, though I was disappointed a little by the bread as it didn't have much jalepeno or cheddar flavor and mostly tasted like toasted white bread.\n\nThird visit I went with the Blue Plate Special Omelet that had bacon, avocado, and cheddar inside with salsa on top served with American potatoes and a biscuit.  I also finally got one of their mimosas that are very popular among Saturday brunch goers.  The omelet was really tasty, only needed a little salt and pepper on top and as always, the potatoes were awesome.  I also had an outstanding biscuit, warm, moist, flaky and crumbly at the same time with a nice crust on top.  Nomnomnom.  \n\nOverall Monty's is an excellent choice with solid diner food, friendly service and fairly reasonable prices.

I've taken the parental units there twice, and they agree. The ambiance is great (if a wee bit noisy): a throwback to a classic, 50s-era diner, with the requisite neon lighting, \"lunch counter\", and bar stools. The portions are huge, so this is truly \"brunch\"! So far I've tried the chilaquiles and the breakfast burrito (yes, I like my Mexican/Southwestern fare!). Both were fantastic, especially when paired with a Mimosa. The menu is extensive: from  humble \"bacon & eggs\" selections to omelets and elaborate ethnic creations. \n\nIf weekend brunch is what you have in mind, I'd suggest arriving early--as in, no later than 8:30 a.m. After that, you'll likely have a long wait. (In the meantime, you can ogle the impressive bakery case.) The staff are friendly, and the service is fast. Despite its location in the busy Atwood neighborhood, I've never had issues finding parking at Monty's. The only slightly negative comment I'd make is that the booths, although they can accommodate 6 people as far as width is concerned, are a bit on the tight sight with regard to the distance from seat back to table. I'm a thin person, so I can imagine that this might be uncomfortable for those with a stockier build. \n\nMonty's is my new go-to breakfast joint.

The place is T-I-N-Y tiny, but that's not a bad thing.  There are a handful of tables around the outside of the bar, and about 25-30 seats at the actual bar itself.  A low ceiling lends to the really smallish feel of the place.\n\nGreat jukebox, great service, good value.  We really enjoyed hanging out at the Villa Tap.  \n\nDrinks: we tried the whiskey old fashioned sour.  Lost points for not being muddled and for not using Squirt.  It was decent, regardless, and a great value; three old fashioneds came in at under $10.\n\nFood-wise - mixed results.  The appetizers (onion rings and cheese curds) were excellent.  Some of the best we've ever had, even if the curds were \"out of the box\" curds.  They were cooked perfectly, didn't show any signs of grease, and were absolutely wonderful.\n\nThe fish - we had deep fried cod all around - left much to be desired.  It was cooked better than any other fish we've ever had - it was so perfectly prepared... the batter was light and crispy; it was served piping hot; no signs of grease - it had all of the makings of a great fish fry.\n\nBut it was too fishy tasting; not in a good way, but in a bad way.  Cod shouldn't have a strong fish flavor.  Save that for bad Ocean Perch or Smelt... and that's what this cod tasted like.  :-(  So, despite being prepared to perfection, it failed to deliver on taste.\n\nThe fries were perfect, which is such a shame.  The Villa knows how to fry a mean dish - just wish the fish wasn't so \"off\" tasting.  We'll give them another shot, though.  I'm sure the burgers and other offerings are going to be good - The Villa was spot-on with everything else, so the fish may have been a fluke.\n\nVilla Tap = No Win/No Fail - it's a tie\n\nService = 4 stars (fast, prompt, spot-on)\nFood = 2.5 stars (fish = fail; all others = win)\nValue = 4 stars ($40 for 3 people with appetizers and fish)\nMisc = 4 stars (atmosphere, homey feel)\n\nDefinitely a great little bar; we'll give the fish another shot at some point and we'll certainly try the rest of the menu items!", "business_id": "J2AiPQnKWBxBwc4MMkbH8w", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-10-10", "type": "review"}

I normally don't like \"pub fries\", which is what I think of when I see the fries they offer, so I was unsure about the bottomless fries, but I ordered a burger (the Black & Bleu) and I upgraded my bottomless fries for 99 cents to the Garlic Parmesan Fries and got the garlic dipping sauce for the fries.  They were amazing and I did get a second helping of them (second batch was double the size of the first).  I ate every last bit of my meal.

Decent sides, cheap drinks, decent service, but extremely tiny and easily packed - especially on Friday nights.\n\nDetailed review: the fish fry fanatics crew selected Toby's Supper Club as the target for our taste buds this week.  We were \"warned\" by a co-worker that it was a \"local/townie\" type place, but it didn't deter us.  We ventured out to Toby's, found a parking spot, and muscled our way into the place.\n\nI say \"muscled\" because the place was PACKED.  We arrived at around 7:30pm that evening; we didn't get seated at a table until nearly 10:00pm... It was ridiculously full.  And hot.  Too many people and not enough A/C, for sure!\n\nDespite the packed-to-the-gills nature, we were quickly served by the bartenders.  Talk about \"machines\" - the two folks that were tending the bar were going non-stop, multi-tasking, and never missing a beat.  May not have been the friendliest service, but they were literally giving change while mixing a drink and taking at least 2 additional orders... all at once.  Free pretzels were a nice touch as well.\n\nOh, and did I mention the drinks were cheap?!  Whiskey Old Fashioned Sour: $3.  Beers - dunno, but we drank for 3 hours on $30.  That's good by my book.\n\nThe ordering process is interesting... you'll be sitting/standing at the bar, and out of nowhere will appear a waitress.  She'll take your order and will then grab you when your food and table are both ready.  We ordered: Baby Pike, Cod, and Lake Perch with a side of cheesy hashbrowns.\n\nAs mentioned, the wait was incredibly long - at least 2.5 hours.  But it was worth it.  Our table became available, we were seated, and we enjoyed a pre-dinner salad (nothing fancy, but fresh and tasty), and the customary carrots/celery/radish/green onion bowl of veggies.\n\nThe fish arrived, and wow.  Wow - that's about all I can say.  So wonderful.  Lightly breaded, fried to perfection, and not a single hint of grease.  Served piping hot, to boot.  What we all liked about the fish was the fact that the fish was actually the star - the breading wasn't overdone and it didn't steal any of the thunder from the fish.  \n\nThe hashbrowns were huge and perfectly cooked - dark/crispy brown crust with a perfectly melted cheese blend on top.  Just a hint of grease, but we're picking nits here...\n\nThe bill arrived - $44 for the three of us, including another round of drinks.  Our server, Rhonda, was absolutely stellar as well - she took fantastic care of us, and it turns out that her son and his girlfriend were the bartenders.\n\nSummary: Toby's Supper Club = WIN\n\nFood: 4.5 - 4.75 stars\nService: 4.5 stars\nValue: 4.5 stars\nAtmosphere: 4.5 stars (classic supper club: paneling, dark wood)\nMisc: Dinged slightly for the long wait and sauna-like heat\n\nSummary: It's worth the wait to get fish here on Friday nights.  Just dress comfortably, bring some cash for the bar, and be prepared to wait.", "business_id": "FIR1SRvSAMNTO3VvNaJn2g", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-09-12", "type": "review"}

Nothing special at all. My husband had the New York Strip which he said was just OK. Nothing he would rush back again to order. He also had the hash browns and was not impressed.

There's good reason - they have 4 pinball games!\n\nFirst of all, Pooley's is home to Mad Rollin Pinball (AKA Madison Pinball) - I haven't made it out for a tournament but it's exciting that they host. Madison Pinball is a group of local collectors and enthusiasts and the games you see at Pooley's come from them. Currently they have: Addams Family, Space Shuttle, Star Trek, and Fun House.\n\nI love Addams Family, in fact it's my second favorite pinball in Madison! It's a very fun game with some cool magnet effects, including a seance mode (you just have to check it out). Space Shuttle is really fascinating for an older game but may be slow-moving for folks who are interested in more modern pinball. Star Trek - variations of this game are common around Madison but its still a favorite game of mine. I first began to understand pinball strategy playing Star Trek and think its a great game to start a pinball obsession for anyone. Fun House is frustrating but a classic as well, another solid game. Next to Rossi's, I think this is the best place to bring a group for pinball. \n\nOutside of the games, Pooley's gets a win because the bartenders are always kind and a few of them are pinball nuts too.", "business_id": "yrBo3c3OTKVO4H1ttBxadw", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-09-08", "type": "review"}

I really have no desire to return ever again. \n\nMy roommates and I had heard they have some pinball machines, and wanted to check that out. Who doesn't love pinball?! Well, their pinball machines ares mostly pretty lame. The only machine worthy of your time or money is the Star Trek machine, which is pretty awesome. The others aren't so great. The Addams Family machine looks awesome, but man does it cheat!\n\nSo we did quickly glance at Yelp regarding their food, and we thought it was probably going to be mediocre...but we were hungry.  And it was indeed mediocre. My chicken sandwich was pretty basic California Chicken. It came smothered in some sort of spread. If you are going to use a cheap bun, you can't just smother both sides! My sandwich felt apart immediately. Ugh. The chicken was a little underdone as well, verging on pink. I didn't get sick from eating it, so that's a plus. I gave half of it to my roommate and he didn't get sick either. So the three of us all ate mediocre chicken sandwiches and we survived. People seem to like their pizza, so maybe go with that.\n\nThe crowd was also interesting. A bunch of bros and bottle blondes. That sums it up pretty accurately, actually. I felt some hard glares from across the bar from some sketchy looking dudes. With limited physical strength, I would absolutely not feel safe going to Pooley's alone on a Saturday night. Absolutely not. Maybe the daytime crowd doesn't look so threatening. \n\nThe bartenders were friendly, and did a great job. They should migrate somewhere else, because I'd gladly order from them again. But, I will not return to Pooley's.

I come from a fantastic food scene in Salt Lake. Oh you didn't know that? It's actually our hidden little secret. SL isn't historically known for the BBQ, but I've had my fair share of wonderful smoked, barbecued, and grilled meats. \n  My wife (and 10 week old) left pleasantly surprised that we found a four-star BBQ place here and mentioned we'd be returning sometime in the near future. It was a Friday night after 7, so not super busy, but it had a good crowd of families and some couples' date nights.\n  Ambience/fell:  You stand in line cafeteria style, with relatively small menus along the wall to be ready for your order up at the upgraded cafeteria bar. As you order, they put a few quickly served items on your red tray and a couple plastic name tents on their for anything that'll be served in a few quick minutes after you sit. The line went pretty quick (about 15 people=7 minutes), giving us a time to look over the moderate-priced, moderately sized foods (it does give a single $ under the name). There are plenty of items in the $4-$7/8 range, but some impressive-looking ribs and other cuts of meat in 'plates' (+2 sides) for about $12-$15.\n  My meal:  I got the pulled pork sandwich. It was good. The pork wasn't seasoned to taste, but moderately juicy and absorbed the sauce well. I thought I'd take him up on the mix of spicy and not spicy BBQ sauce - the sandwich came smothered in it (messy, but just the right amount of sauce in my opinion) on a soft bun. The portion was plenty for my moderately hungry appetite, but I was definitely over it by the last few bites. \n  Sides:  I added sweet potato fries (we love SP fries, and the friendly regular in front of us said he doesn't get anything else) and were looking for another appetizing side. The 'server' or worker gentleman recommended the mashed potatoes since I said my wife wanted to stay away from spice - I guess the Ranch Beans \"have a little kick.\" Needless to say, you don't go to a BBQ place for the fries and mashed potatoes. SP fries were significantly overcooked and slightly burnt and the mashed potatoes were a step above KFC's - perhaps a bit like a cracker-barrel style with a scant amount of light brown gravy.\n  Wife's meal:  My wife ordered the pork nachos. And we actually really, really liked the nachos. When we return, that's definitely going to be a repeat. The chips taste homemade, crispy and flavorful and are smothered in pinto beans (with juices), a plentiful helping of pork, and this really yummy queso sauce (kind of tastes like the queso dip from Chili's). Everything was really well dispersed too, which doesn't always happen at places. If we were more shameless, we would've licked the plate clean.\n  Sorry for the long post, but hopefully it helps.", "business_id": "0kRBRm5xOWclzemsLl9iQA", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-09-04", "type": "review"}

This place is right across the street from the station. I sat by myself at the bar, but there were plenty of others riding solo as well. It was THAT kind of place - where the locals can come and drown away their sorrows. Actually, it was much more than that - this place seems to have a little bit of everything. There are pool tables in the back, so you can get that sort of crowd. There are larger tables as well, so you can see some large groups of students gabbing away. There are a good amount of TV's, so there were some people watching the evening college football games. There are decent sized booths, so I saw a couple people typing away on laptops. And there's a jukebox, so some people are silently rocking out to the classics. And perhaps best of all, there were plenty of townies around for some great people watching. At one point of the locals who had clearly had too much to drink began serenading a nearby booth with the Canadian National Anthem. Although he didn't get the words right, I gave him an A+ for effort. The bartenders called the guy a cab and made sure he got home okay. It felt like I was inside some sort of insider club where everybody is friends, and even the students are cool with the townies.\n\nThe beer selection was surprisingly good. There were a lot of good import options available, although I stuck with $2.25 Bud Light drafts. Remember, I was taking the Amtrak home, so that shows you how much money I wanted to spend.... They have $1.50 PBR drafts too, which is what the locals stuck to. The food was pretty good as well. I had a simple cheeseburger and fries. Although not my favorite burger/fries combo, it was definitely worth the $4.50 I paid. The \"fixin's table\" they have is nothing more than onions, pickles, and tomatoes next to some condiments and sauces - Nothing special there. But there was something cool about being able to put that stuff on yourself, I guess.\n\nThe charm of this place lies in the characters that visit, and for that alone, I am giving a 5 star rating. The cheap food and beer is an added bonus. And I almost forgot, free peanuts! If I return to Champaign any time soon, I will definitely be back to this place.", "business_id": "pPWre8lbVAssER6CN0uWMw", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-11-03", "type": "review"}

Its journeyman efforts will win friends and a few high fives, but it is not the flashy varsity letterman. \n\nFood here is just fine, and very reasonably priced. I have been disappointed with the size of their appetizers once or twice, but their entrees are a solid value, cooked dependably to be exactly what you expect in pub grub. Prices are very good for downtown Champaign, but they lack the booze selection of a Radio Maria or Blind Pig. The gross looking jar on the bar is infused vodka.\n\nService is always friendly, and fastest at the bar. If you sit at their pretty awesome outside tables, the trade off is that you're gonna get ignored. You can order lunch ahead and pick up 15 minutes later. The free peanuts are priceless, as are the friendly patrons who are more likely than other crowds in town to strike up a convo with you. \n\nAll this sounds pretty complimentary, but the fact is that this place is not stand-out awesome in any particular way. If you want to take your friends from Chicago to visit 4 places in downtown Champaign that are all different from each other, to give them an idea of what the \"new\" Champaign has to offer, you aren't going to stop at Esquire. Of course, that's just fine with me.

It's also the place I had my first legal drink, the place I arranged my first (extremely underwhelming) one-night stand, the place I had my first post-breakup talk ... the list goes on and on. In short, the Esquire is a place of firsts for me, and for that reason it holds an unimpeachable place in my heart.\n\nIt's a good place, even taking none of the above into account. The prices are reasonable, the service is friendly, the drinks are stiff, the food is tasty, the jukebox kicks much ass (except on one night a few years back when some doucherocket fed about a million dollars into the machine and played Pogues records all night, but I am willing to let bygones be bygones). There's a nice array of seating options: small tables, mid-size tables, large booths, and the bar itself, which is the best place to sit if you want super-fast service and a good vantage point for eavesdropping and people-watching. There are also some tables outside, which are nice places to park your ass if you're a smoker or like keeping an eye on the goings-on along Walnut. The outdoors is heated during chilly weather, and although it doesn't too a ton of good in the dead of winter, it's lovely on brisk autumn nights.\n\nThe people who frequent this place are an interesting mix. Some townies, some students, some regulars, some noobs. You're just as likely to see a gaggle of hipsters looking vaguely out of place as you are to see a group of middle-aged business types in dad jeans. Every once in a while some truly fresh and interesting personalities will be present, such as a trio of cackling cougars sipping pineapple margaritas and flirting with any male under the age of 26, or two sharply-dressed men having a snappy but ultimately friendly conversation you ache to be a part of, or a crusty old man with a walrus mustache who will pound your table with a hammy fist and yell something that sounds friendly but is completely unintelligible. Oh, and every once in a while Tim Lash of Hum fame will be hanging around, which I think we can all agree is pretty delightful. (I do not advocate drunkenly pestering him, of course, but if you do want to say hi be assured that he's about the nicest dude on earth and will receive your attention with much grace and warmth.)\n\nOne of the best, most endearing things about this bar is its all-around friendliness. I often go here by myself in the evening with whatever book I'm currently reading, fold myself into a corner, and order a few beers. Not once has any patron or staff member given me grief over this, and for that I am truly grateful. Yes, the linoleum is hideous and yes, the bathrooms are a little iffy, but all the bartenders remember my name, and that's something that can't be beat.", "business_id": "pPWre8lbVAssER6CN0uWMw", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-09-28", "type": "review"}

You could say I grew up throwing peanut shells on the floor and stomping on them. (For the record, I still throw the shells on the floor, but I no longer do the accompanying dance--that stopped being cute around age eight.) Before my family moved away from Champaign, this was the number one place we would take out of town relatives visiting. Even as objectively yummier, cooler places opened up around town, Aunt So-and-so and Uncle Whatshisface would always demand to be taken back to Esquire, and we were always happy to oblige. It's a comfortable, unpretentious bar, and that's what you needs sometimes.\n\nIt's all about the ambiance, really.

I grew up in this bar, much like Jackie H's review.  One of the bartenders was my little league baseball coach, then I played on the bars soft ball team.  Even though I have not lived in Chamaign for about 10 years, I can still find people I know, and bartenders that remember me.\n\nWhen I was little I would order kiddy cocktails from the bar, then get change to play on the only pinball machine.  Then stomp on all the peanut shells on the floor.  I have seen expansion many times.  Originally from one bar and a few booths, to a wrap around bar, then finally to the pool hall and extra bar area that you see now.  I have met U of I basketball coaches here, there are pictures of former Cubs players kissing my Mom (wait, what).  My parents originally met here.  It is safe to say my family has a mullti generational history here.\n\nAnyway, beyond the nostalgia, it is one of the best pubs to visit in the downtown area.  Just a great place to relax and have a few drinks.  Along with the evolution of the bar, so has the menu.  Now there is a mix of pub grub like burgers, fish sandwiches, etc.  Which I don't think are that great.  Though the various pizzas are very good.  As are the wings, which I am not typically a fan of.  Though these are baked, not fried and battered like most.  The Asian Dumplings are great as well.  The service can be hit or miss.  Depending on the time you come, and where you order.  Bar service is pretty good, but the waitresses can be a bit confused when trying to find you after you place the order.  Though they work hard, and always take care of anything that might be wrong.\n\nDrinks are pretty standard.  There are a handful of good micros on tap.  Usually something from Two Brothers or Dark Horse as the main micros available on tap.  A bit more extensive selection in bottles.  The rest is typical drinks for a neighborhood bar.\n\nOverall, not perfect.  Though the goods far out way the bad.

I was hanging out at home when I got the call to hang out with this guy for a low key night.  I had to remind him it was Monday Night Football and the NLDS game of Phillies v. Rockies.  So he suggests we hit up Majerle's, which I'm down for because it means more sport watching and less talking.\n\nSo I find my way down here, and say screw it to paying for parking.  After the whole $20 to park at Westgate, I'm down to take my chances at getting a parking ticket.  It's ridiculous how much the city makes off of parking, parking tickets, and the ever illustrious DUIs.\n\nAnyways, I go into Majerle's, completely ignored by the hostess out front.  Glad to know she's getting paid $8.50 to not talk to anyone and act pretty...  Settle down at the bar and order a Blue Moon, because it's a Monday, it's football, it's baseball, and I'm preparing for another laborious date.\n\nHalfway through my beer my date arrives.  Which wouldn't be cool, but I need to get good and drunk so I deal.  He automatically decides we need to get wings.  Thanks for deciding...because I have no thoughts of my own.  Apparently him being a gentleman meant he would talk shit on the wings I wanted, then reluctantly give in to getting the boneless buffalo wings.  Which are $5 along with four other appetizers during their 4-8 pm happy hour.  Good deal there!\n\nThe wings come out within 15 minutes or so and they look...odd.  It looks like someone sliced tofu and lightly fried them, then dipped them in excessive amounts of sauce.  Definitely not the most appetizing item to look at.  I wished they looked better, because then I wouldn't have the hippie making fun of me the whole time.  They tasted okay, but the look alone was too much of a turn off to enjoy.\n\nThe bartender disappeared after we ordered the wings, so we spent some time waiting for her to discover us again so we could order our entree.  Oh how I wished she had taken our order earlier.  I had to listen to the douche hippie talk smack on the Angels and how people die all the time so Adenhart's death didn't matter.  Yeah...that deserved a total smack in the face.  Or complete beat down.  Don't ever hate of my Angels or commit blasphemy against Adenhart.  I will not stand for that, especially if I've had a few drinks in me.\n\nAnyways, so I eventually order the veggie wrap with chicken and he gets the chicken parmesan.  Not too much time passes, so I could enjoy the flat screens and watch the Dolphins show Mark Sanchez how to play a real football game.  The wrap comes, and it's huge!  I enjoyed the fruit salad of pineapple and grapes.  And the actually spinach tortilla and veggies were good, but the chicken just dragged the wrap down.  It was so bland and tasteless.  I wish I would have just gone pure veggie.\n\nI had a couple rounds of beer after that, just to pass the time until the Dolphins could be declared the official winners.  Conversation came and went with the people at the bar, far more interesting than the person I was with.  The beers came and went, and soon it was time to peace out.

I really covet being wowed, I like being pleasantly surprised, and I can have a perfectly merry day with a run of the mill meal. Unfortunately, there are some experiences that don't fit in to any of my \"I will return again and again or at least recommend to friends\" template.\n \n Majerle's is one of those experiences.\n\nI know that I should definitely give this place another try but only because I had such a bad time I think that it must have been entirely abnormal because it would be out of business if it was run this way daily.\n When I arrived on Sunday afternoon (right as the Cardinals game was about to start), there were several content tables already enjoying their beer and bar fare. I must say that the food wasn't terrible. I wouldn't classify it as anything special or something that I would crave on any particular day. But the wings were crisp, the salad was fresh'ish' and the burger was prepared to the temp I ordered. This is where the one star came from. Decent food (good temp, tastes like what it's supposed to, sans hair, ect) deserves some credit.\n \n   If I could give negative stars for service, this would be a -5 Stars type of place. Our server was either hung over or was just entirely uninterested in doing ANYTHING that her job description calls for. She greeted us about ten minutes after we sat down (although it was a Cardinals game day, the bar was probably about half full). She took our drink order and returned with our drinks ages later (well, another almost ten minutes). I was starving and ready to order food but wasn't able to because she slammed the drinks on the table and left again. I flagged down another server and he was so kind as to send ours back. FINALLY I ordered. Again, the food was fine. It wasn't, however, fine enough to cancel out the fact that our appetizer was delivered 20 minutes laster followed IMMEDIATELY by our entree's. Ok. Fine. But, the salad was wrong the first time (Note: When your guests are ordering, it helps to listen to what they actually want. It is NOT a good practice to forget and then just 'guess' what they said). And our server didn't even deliver our food so we couldn't order another drink until we flagged her down again. We ordered another two beers and waited. And waited. And waited. I saw our beers sitting on the bar and our server chatting in the corner to another associate. We couldn't get her attention so my dining companion/boyfriend went to the bar himself to get them. In fact, we didn't see our server again for the rest of the meal. I was so irate at this point that I wanted to leave immediately and spend our Sunday afternoon football watching/beer drinking pennies elsewhere. I flagged down the same server I asked to find my server the first time and had him do my bidding again (he seemed to be working, why couldn't I have sat in HIS section?) She came over, mumbled some apology about having to get our own beers and dropped our check. \n  Bright points: They have a great tv set up for football watching. Multiple tv's tuned to every single game you could imagine. \nNot so Bright Points: For me, watching football at a sports bar has necessary accoutrements (steady flow of beer, timely delivery of food, ect) to make it enjoyable. This mark was completely missed due entirely to the complete disregard our server had for her job. Or her guests.\nDownright Dim points: Well, this review pretty much sums it up.\n If I'm in the area and kind of desperate, perhaps I'll try it again. Probably Not.", "business_id": "45puCRQ6Vh_IIAy7kkfFDQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-11-20", "type": "review"}

To top it off the they have top notch service. I have never had a problem, compliant or been disappointed. You can tell the employees love the place that they work out and enjoy to serve the patrons.\n\nMy office has had several private parties at this location. They have two areas where you can throw parties. My favorite is the Cotton Room. It is a private room that is very hip, urban, all white with glass mirrors surrounding the room. Kinda like a mini retro dance space. It has plush leather white seating, big screen tv's and a private bar.

It was Sunday morning prior to kickoff and the place was just beginning to fill up.  To make matters worse a different waitress assisted every step of the way: one took my order, one brought the food, another went for my refills.

It was easily located across from my hotel and it was a weekend, which meant I could catch both the collegiate and professional football games as well as playoff baseball.\n I take Hooters for what it is, pretty decent fried food, a restaurant that caters to men, and always has a game on. This in mind, I didn't anticipate anything other then a beer and something to eat.\nI sat at the bar both times and the bartender, Brittany was extremely friendly and made a point to learn (while IDing) and remember everyone's name-- which I thought was a nice touch. She was always willing to change channels to make sure everyone's game was being aired which was appreciated as well. They have a good football special-- 10 boneless wings with all you can eat fries for $5.99 during any football game.  The $3.50 25oz Shock Top beers were a deal as well. \nIt was odd for me to see a kid's birthday party in the restaurant on Sunday, but to each their own.", "business_id": "qsWxbgQwuomXvMseg23DGg", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-10-14", "type": "review"}

Granted, my expectations weren't super high, I've been to other locations and they've always been consistent.  And sure enough - the Arizona Center location did not disappoint.\n\nWe were in a group of about twelve, and we all ordered beers and food before going to a movie.  Service was great - (reading other reviews - we may have just been lucky) but seriously everyone was friendly and prompt.  We had multiple servers helping us since our party was large.  My fiance and I ordered a couple of beers (domestics of course, but we made do) and their famous wings.  I ordered two that were the hottest level of spice they came in.  Honestly - they weren't hot at all to me but my fiance must constantly remind me of my lack of taste buds (I recently took on the infamous ghost chili and won - but that is a story for another time).  Everyone at the table thought they were spicy, so order with caution.  We ordered them Daytona style - which means they were grilled - and they were yummy. \n\nThe girls were of course pretty!  ;)  They even sang happy bday to our two buddies - who had the biggest smiles on their faces EVER!\n\nThe negative to this particular Hooters is the location itself.  The Arizona Center becomes a ghost town at night - and parking in the lot is tricky.  Even with validation you still have to pay after a certain amount of time passes.  Maybe I'm just spoiled - but when I go out to dinner or a bar I don't like having to pay for parking.  It's not like we're in New York or San Francisco!  \n\nRegardless - parking issues aside - a really fun time with a good group of friends.

So I scrapped the beans/slaw and got the fries. I'll address the cheese sticks first. My friend got the puniest, most pitiful looking cheese sticks I've ever seen. She said they weren't all that great (which is really sad cause its hard to mess us cheese sticks right?). My sandwich came with some curly fries that were horrible. They looked as if they hadn't been cooked long enough (they were white instead of that golden brown we all know and love), and some seasoning salt was sprinkled on top in an effort to distract me from how terrible they were. The sandwich though, was actually decent. There was a huge chicken breast patty dipped in buffalo sauce, sitting on top of a bun. So I enjoyed the sammich, but pretty much hated everything else. \n\ncustomer service was good, hence the two stars. If it wasn't for that, they wouldn't have gotten any.

I have never written a negative review in my life, and it takes a lot to fire me up. I have NEVER experience worse customer service or rude behavior in my life. I was prepared to spend $8,000 on 1 event, as I did last year, and I can't even get a phone call back. In September 2013, I rented out the TGI Friday Front Row suite box at Chase Field for the January 2014 Super Cross for my company's marketing event. We had 50 people in attendance and spent over $8,000.00. Just a couple months later, I emailed Alan, my contact there, and let him know I wanted the box again for Super Cross. I had first right of refusal, seeing as I let them know I wanted the box, it does not appear that I refused this at any point in time. I was recently contacted by their marketing manager Tracy and I once again told her that I wanted the box. However, when I rented this out in January, I was promised 10 seats and they ended up selling 8 of them to other visitors. I was not upset, but I needed to make sure the same thing would not happen again this year. I made it very clear to them that I wanted to go speak with them about the seating chart prior to making anything official. I was out of town for work when I received an email letting me know that someone else was interested in the suite and that I had 3 DAYS to get to downtown Phoenix and get them a check. Naturally I did not get the email until I was back in town. This was more than 6 weeks earlier than I provided them a check last year, and still more than 5 months prior to the event. Even worse is that the reason I wanted to meet with them face to face was because they messed things up last year. Knowing that I had told 2 people that I was absolutely going to reserve the suite, it is so wrong to me that the general manager Lyle made the decision to release it to someone else. I have now been trying to get in touch with Lyle, Alan and Tracy for 2 weeks. Why won't they call me back? Simple....THEY KNOW THEY ARE IN THE WRONG AND DO NOT WANT TO FACE ME. I spoke with Alan on the night of 8/22/14 and gave him some strong words. He promised me that the general manger, Lyle, would contact me the morning of 8/23/14. Well, here we are on 8/25/14 and still no phone call. \nLesson learned. These large companies truly do not care about hurting the smaller people because they will get business no matter what. These employees would not make it in the real world where they actually need to work to obtain business. \nTo add salt to the wound, we already have this event on our business calendar and ordered the marketing material for SuperCross at TGI Friday's Front Row. More costs we will not be able to recoup because of their awful customer service.", "business_id": "1-1VcGTL3GyCqUpXZLFTZA", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-09-10", "type": "review"}

It's small and doesn't have much of a street presence so it's fairly easy to miss if you aren't paying attention.  The diner is a classic boxcar that stays true to it's roots.  The outdoor seating area looks quite enjoyable for a late night snack, though I'm not sure if they are open that late.  Gotta love the outdoor ordering window.  You're best best inside is if you can catch a seat at the corner of the counter.  You not only get a great view of the chef doing the cooking but have a nice fat fan behind you to cool you off.  \n\nWe arrived shortly after it opened and chatted with the cook to get his suggestions on what to order.  Very friendly and funny.  The counter's got various coffee table books full of quotes and handy worst case scenario answers.  \n\nI had the Garfield which was a fried egg sandwich specialty.  I can't really recall all the ingredients but the salsa in the sandwich was amazing.  My girlfriend ordered the grilled cheese and it was knock out.  Prepared with olive oil, it was by far one of the best grilled cheeses I've ever had.  The french fries were done just right and the seasoning on them really hit the spot.  The total for both of us including a couple of ice teas was under twenty dollars.  A great deal anywhere.\n\nJust a friendly reminder that it is CASH ONLY!  I had to run to a couple of nearby gas station ATMs since the first was out of order.  Pretty embarrassing but the chef didn't seem to mind and trusted us to return.  Can't complain about any part of the meal and would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Phoenix or any locals that have been snoozing on this gem.", "business_id": "tb24fvNJfHhyKEXkKn12Xw", "stars": 5, "date": "2007-09-04", "type": "review"}

Outside of the Five & Diner franchise, I hadn't been to anything resembling an authentic diner in the Phoenix area.  Ever.  So what a surprise to find an old diner transplanted from back east into the downtown Phoenix area.  It's a little on the fringes as the immediate neighborhood is a little sketchy, but we were going for a late breakfast on a Saturday so I didn't worry too much about my car.\n\nThe diner itself truly is a timewarp.  The interior is a simple 9 stool diner with a cooking area just as tiny.  You can't help but converse with the waitress and the cooking staff since they're basically right in front of your face.  If you're looking for more room (and want to keep an eye on your ride), there's picnic tables with umbrellas outside.\n\nWe got here around 11am so my girlfriend and I didn't feel too self conscious ordering drinks.  I got the mimosa while she got the bloody mary.  I'm not sure what they put in those drinks, but they had some kick!  They weren't overtly alcoholic, but just spicier than other mimosas or bloody marys I've had.  As for the food, I came here for one thing.  A biscuit sandwich.  More specifically, the Big Jim.  Fried chicken, country gravy, bacon, and cheddar on a homemade biscuit.  Unreal.  The biscuit was flaky, buttery heaven.  The batter on the fried chicken was delicious and the gravy wonderfully hearty.  Easily the best biscuit sandwich I've had in the Phoenix area.  My girlfriend got the Andouille Scramble which was basically an omelette with andouille sausage, peppers and onions with a side of potatoes.  She saw how much I loved my biscuit so she added a biscuit with honey to her order and was equally impressed.\n\nWe so wanted to save room for the beignets, but we were stuffed.  Total for the two drinks, two entrees, the add-on biscuit, and tip came to about $40.  Had we done non-alcoholic drinks it would've been a little under $30.  Their ingredients are locally sourced so you pay a little bit of a premium for that.  But considering the quality of the food and the unique experience, it was money well spent.

There is a sense that they want you to have a great experience while you enjoy eating.  \nIt's got some super items on the menu and they are working on creating a full bar.  They have large multi seat tables that look similar to picnic tables outside under umbrellas so there is more seating of the weather is good.\nThere are several items on the menu I will return to try but on this particular trip, our first, we had the Holy Puerco & the Peanut butter Bacon Cheddar Burger.  Both were amazing.  I felt a bit like I was back in New Orleans with the fried cheddar grit cake, cracklins, & Crystal sauce.  Not to mention the burger reminds me of one of my favorite burger joints in NOLA, Yo Mama's Bar & Grill. They also have a Peanut butter Bacon burger.  \nI like the list they have on the wall behind the counter that names all the local businesses they purchase there produce, meat, and goods.  It shows the intent to buy local and support other local businesses.  \nI will be back, I witnesses the making and devouring of a sandwich named Big Jim, a fried chicken breast, country gravy, bacon & cheddar on a large homemade biscuit.

With just a few counter seats inside the trailer that houses this diner-style joint, you may want to order through the window and post up at one of the many outdoor tables, especially if you're with a group. Try a cocktail to start while you wait for your order - they're strong but delicious, typically served in mason jars or goblets, which matches the laid back vibe of the place. \n\nThere are a number of great dishes here, but among the best are the Fried Green Tomato sandwich and the poutine. The tomatoes are perfectly fried, light and crispy, with greasy flavor enhanced by the slightly sweet zest of corn relish and the subtle heat of chipotle sauce. Served on toasted local bread, it's got just the right amount of crunch and flavor. Plus, it's unlike any sandwich you'll see on other menus around town. The poutine is also a must-try. Served with country-style gravy and perfectly distributed melted cheese on top of thin, crispy fries, it's not a traditional poutine but one of the most delicious versions in the Valley. If gravy's not your thing, the fries are just as delicious on their own. \n\nOther highlights include the fried chicken sandwiches, which come in a number of variations featuring ingredients like honey, country gravy, and buffalo sauce. Although the biscuits they're served atop can be a bit dense, the chicken is perfectly moist and flavorful and never too greasy. The side of watermelon completes this southern-themed dish. And, if you're a burger lover, try one here. The meat is well-cooked with great flavor and the patties are perfectly portioned. \n\nThe service at Welcome Diner is casual but friendly and efficient. You'll get real attentiveness at the counter and maybe some small talk. Don't expect anything too formal - this is definitely a neighborhood joint, but you can tell the staff takes pride in their place of employment. And why wouldn't they?

John Luther (Awesome name, btw!) took our order and was very friendly the entire time. The three of us ordered the No Way Jose Burger which came with a choice of fries or cole slaw. The price is pretty reasonable: $10.75 for the burger and fries. We each also ordered 3 Hess Cream Ales and 3 burgers for a grand total of $55.82. \n\nThe atmosphere was very chill and the clientele, for the hour, was very friendly.

It is completely in the middle of no where ... and in fact, for a minute or two as we were driving down Roosevelt St, we really thought that Siri was getting us lost. We got to the diner at the perfect time, however, because they were just turning on the lights and the small outdoor restaurant space was illuminated, making for a perfect setting to enjoy a Saturday night meal.\n\nAs far as the food goes, I left thinking, \"yes, fried chicken, absolutely delicious ... Everything else? Well, it was just alright.\"\n\nWe ordered two Hurricanes for drinks and a Bumblebee, a Big Jim, and the Poutine Fries for our meal. It was still happy hour (goes from 3p-7p ... pleasantly surprised that it was also on a Saturday), so the Hurricanes and Poutine Fries were $6 each (instead of regular price, $8). The Hurricanes were tasty but after a few sips, it kind of tasted like orange juice & liquor (not complaining, just saying it wasn't anything fancy). The Poutine Fries, in my opinion, had too much gravy but my date enjoyed them. I kind of wish we would've just gotten a plate of their regular fries because the fries themselves were really good. Their sandwiches were of course huge, very messy, and a little difficult to eat, but the fried chicken with the honey on the Bumblebee was so tasty, it was worth it. I removed the chicken off the biscuits and the biscuits were ignored; also, I thought that the honey mustard was unnecessary and I'm not a huge fan of pickles so I picked those off too. I'd say that I really wouldn't mind just ordering fried chicken and honey next time if/when we go back. My date enjoyed the Big Jim. He liked the combination of cheese, gravy, and chicken all together.\n\nThe people who worked there were really nice and came by and asked us if everything was good. After a while though, I could feel that what I had eaten was way too heavy. In hindsight, I probably would've ventured to try the Vegan Jackfruit Po'Boy or the fish po'boy since those seem like lighter options.\n\nDefinitely a place worth checking out ...

Very disappointing to see all the customers that were in line after myself getting their orders ahead of us.  Our friends were finishing their plates when my order finally arrived, small, burnt and nuclear hot on the inside.\n\nWhat really capped the disappointment was when the waiter came by to ask how all the food was tasting and I told him I don't know because we have no food to taste, it had been 50 minutes on a 30 min promise and our food still was not here.  He asked what our name was and went back to check, then came back and said they have started working on it now, to which I replied, \"What were they doing for the last 45 minutes if not making our order?\" to which he had no reply.\n\nThe Welcome burger looked big and nice and I was really excited to see what I was going to get for a grilled cheese with 3 different cheeses.  When it finally did arrive, it was burnt on the outside and cool to the touch, but Scorching hot on the inside.  They must have used a microwave to re-heat the sandwich, because I can still feel the burn on my mouth the next day.  Not only was the grilled cheese hot, it was also extremely small.  I was thinking something substantial after seeing the mac and cheese on the \"Snack\" menu the size of a small child's head, but the grilled cheese sandwich was more like an appetizer for one, not an entree.\n\nIf only I could give them 1/2 a star for the unlimited cold ice water, and the outdoor patio dining room, which were the only good things about the restaurant.", "business_id": "tb24fvNJfHhyKEXkKn12Xw", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-10-25", "type": "review"}

My friend and I walked over on First Friday after a guy recommended it to us and described it as a place with great \"comfort food.\" It's a few blocks from the more populated, business portion of Roosevelt. Since we were walking at night, it was a little sketchy given it was dark and there were barely any street lights. But the food and service were well worth the 5 minute creepy walk. Plus it made it more of an adventure ;)\n\nThis places feels like an outdoor diner, located on a residential block. You order your food at a window and then find a seat outside in the cute little lot. Despite the fact it was First Friday, the wait wasn't long at all. I think this is because, as I mentioned, it's a bit off the main strip of Roosevelt. We were able to easily find a comfortable place to sit and the service was great. I loved how patient the woman taking our order was and her enthusiasm describing their menu :) There's nothing worse than when you're excited to try a new place and the service is lackluster. This woman took her time and even checked on us later once our food arrived.\n\nI tried the crunchy peanut butter, bacon burger with pickles and cheddar cheese. I know, right?! Sounds crazy! It was highly recommended by the person in front of me in line. And just way too weird for me to not try ---and man, am I glad I did! It was SO GOOD! The flavors actually really complimented each other, especially the saltiness of the peanut butter/bacon and sweetness of the peanut butter/pickles. The bun was also fantastic and fresh. Descent beef portion too. It came with a side of fries which were cooked to perfection. \n\nI will definitely be returning. There are a bunch of other delicious sounding items I'd like to try.

The staff are invariably polite, friendly, welcoming and just (dare one say it?) plain NICE people. The food is good. Exactly what you'd hoped for but usually do not find. The service is fast and accurate even when the place is packed. We moved into a large condo building near by, and we have met many of our neighbors at Coco's. Seems the whole building dines there at one time or another.  \n\nThe other evening our A/C in the building failed and was out for about 6 hours on a 100+ degree afternoon and evening. We went over to Coco's for an ice tea, and we mentioned to them what had happened with the failing AC. Along with the Iced Tea, they gave us some of their wonderful Cocoanut Creme Pie 'on the house' in a thoughtful and kind attempt to cheer us up after living with no AC for several hours.  This little kindness mean so much to us and certainly it was not expected... but that bit of reaching out to cheer us up did in fact make the whole world look brighter for a while! We survived the heat, loved their iced tea and when we got back home the AC was running again at last! \n\nIf you're in the area, stop in. The food is good, the service above your expectations and the people are incredible.  Much more than we would have ever expected from a small chain-type restaurant.

In a mad jumble of antiquities ranging from the 20's to the 70's every item is either a conversation piece, memory or a must have.  I bought a mod 60's chappeau my baby brother picked out as being \"me\" and I am eyeing a full bonnet hair dryer the size of a rice cooker :p\n\nOnto the soda fountain.  There are egg creams, hot fudge and a toe curling number of flavor possibilities. I always want to cook up something outrageous to try but seem to drift toward their amazing executions of classic favorites.\n\nThe regular menu is exactly as it should be.  I have yet to be bold enough to try their Hawiian cole slaw (so 50's) but all of their soups, sides, etc. taste home made with reasonable prices.  I was reading through the reviews here and saw a couple mentions of split pea soup ... how is it I've never been when they've had it?!?!  I am now on a mission to go when it is being served.\n\nOn a side note, MacAlpine's serves stuffed tomotoes!  Your choice of tune or chicken salad, I imagine they'd do egg if you asked over greens and surrounded by lots of veggies, etc.  It's the kind of dish to inhale after killing yourself at the gym and you won't feel all that bad about it.\n\nP.S. Sometimes the service can seem a bit oddly timed but when you take into account the division of labor and the nature of the place it does make sense.

Well, with Macalpine's, there's no illusion.  It's legitimate.  I mean, the place has been in business since 1929, which is quite a testament in a modern-obsessed city like Phoenix.  In fact, I'm not sure much has been done to the place in terms of renovations, as the business itself both looks and smells its age.\n\nI'll be honest, the food here isn't really anything to write home about.  The toasted cheese (my personal favorite) and the generously gigantic club sandwich are good, but I can't say much about their burgers and dogs.  If I only cared about food, my rating would be lower.  But we don't come here for the food - we come here for the sweets!

But the delicious ice cream sodas are the reason for our repeat visits. There are many combinations worth trying, most notably the Velvet Elvis, Bozo, German Chocolate, Hubba Bubba, or even your own sugary concoction.   There's also a variety of sundaes all made using Thrifty ice cream, but we've never quite made it that far. \n\nIn addition to the actual restaurant, there's also a thrift store that sells various used items.  I've never bought anything, but always like looking around.  An archaic dentist chair, cigarette machine, and old school irons.  I consider the place an homage to a time when home appliances weren't all made out of plastic.  There's also a room entirely dedicated to clothing, which I often imagine is where kids take their grandparents' wardrobes after they die.\n\nService is always good, prices are fair, and you're unlikely to find another place quite like this in Phoenix.

That speaks volumes of coolness.\n\nThere is little to distinguish this from any other Denny's, and during the day it is the mild-mannered place we are all familiar with.  But at night, and particularly in the wee hours of the morning, the alt crowd arrives.  Many people from Goth and LGBTQ clubs pile in here for food at that time after dancing and socializing.  My wife and I went here after our visit to Sanctum--she walked in with her Gothy attire and no-one batted an eye.  The place had quite a crowd at 2am and they were mostly a fairly young, hip group.\n\nFood was. . .Denny's.  Service was fine.  If you go here at 2am, you know you're not going for the food in particular but for the crowd and maybe some people watching if you're into that sort of thing.

Less doughy and fluffy and chewy and more like a thin, flavorless, store bought, pre formed crust.  (And I'm sorry, but if you run a special for a $6 12\" pepperoni pizza and the customer asks for just cheese, why not drop the price a tiny smidge, considering that you aren't having to provide any pepperoni on their pizza?  Almost $23 for a small pizza, two dozen wings and one large Pepsi is kinda high.)\n\nThe wings also weren't up to par this visit.  They were badly overcooked, so much so that the drumsticks had all pulled away from the bone and shriveled into little balls of overcooked cooked chicken at the end of the drumstick.  (I can't think of any other way to describe it...)  I like my wings well cooked (like chicken jerky) but last night's wings were just ridiculously overcooked.  They were also woefully skimpy on the sauce, and too boot the butter that makes up the base for my beloved Long Wong's mild wing sauce was kinda off too.  It tasted a tad rancid.  Not enough to make me not eat the wings, but still I could tell it wasn't very fresh like it normally tastes.  It made me pretty sad.\n\nAdding to all that the damn Pepsi wasn't as rich and syrupy and delicious as normal.  This time I could CLEARLY taste the carbonated liquid underneath the Pepsi syrup, and the carbonation was the dominant flavor.  They obviously changed the ratio at the fountain drink dispenser.  (WTF??)\n\nOverall this visit was extremely disappointing.  EXTREMELY.  I am a huge Long Wong's fan, and I live right down the street so I tend to come here a lot, but after last night's visit I am not sure when or if I'll be back...\n\nLong Wong's Management, heed my words.  If a die-hard regular like me is contemplating finding another wing place, you need to take a good, hard look at what you've changed and CHANGE IT BACK.  Whatever penny pinching you did with the pizzas was NO BUENO.  Also, the stinginess on the wing sauce and the Pepsi mixture was not a good move either.  Those were THE things that we loved about your restaurant, and would come and brave the less-than-sparkling-clean conditions at your establishment to enjoy.  If you kill the food quality by skimping on cheese, using some crappy pizza crust, being stingy with wing sauce (ON WINGS!  The VERY THING you are known for!!  DO NOT TAMPER WITH A FAN FAVORITE!) and the syrup mixture on the fountain dispenser then there is almost no way I am braving that frenetic, overcluttered, hot ass mess of dining room restaurant to come back.  Normally I can ignore all that junk on the walls while I savor the delicious food, but now that the food isn't distracting me, I can hardly ignore the random junk dangling from the walls and ceiling.\n\nI am willing to bet you that others will agree here.  You may have saved a little on the ingredients that you just cheaped out on, but it'll cost you a ton in lost repeat business over time.  Penny wise, pound foolish.

I was starving, it was somewhere around 10 pm, I'd missed dinner, and the hospital cafeteria wasn't going to be open for two more hours.  Luckily I had some family members in town who brought me a burger from Long Wong's.  I devoured that thing and it tasted just like those $15 upscale burgers across town.  I had no clue where it had come from.\n\nSince then, I've actually been to Long Wong's restaurant.  I was completely in shock when I walked in - the outside building and interior didn't match up at all with what I had imagined.  It's super kitschy, with old-school video games lining the walls alongside that talking Mr. Fish that my grandpa has.  It's definitely not a date interior - pretty sure this must be a popular hangout for high school kids and anyone else stoned out of their mind - but the food really hits the spot when you're in a burger mood.  Much better than those big name fast food restaurants and much cheaper than those big name slow food restaurants.\n\nAll in all, I'm a fan and Long Wong's remains on my go-to list of unhealthy treats.", "business_id": "BT2Vls7h6sWrCKa5gGXbKg", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-11-13", "type": "review"}

Lone Star is one of the restaurants consistently in our orbit. We used to dine here for special occasions. Unfortunate circumstances put us into lots more restaurants for meals these days. \n\nOur favorite foods, like so many other Yelp*ers are the pork chops with sweet potato on the side. Cinnamon & butter on the side please. Mom goes big for the half rack of ribs and sweet potato. We usually take half home. I enjoy the salad wedge/steak wedge or steak salad. I'm taking a liking to the French Dip, Sweet D is eating burgers more these days with their fat, hand formed sirloin patties. \n\nSpeaking of hand formed, Lone Star's steaks are aged off-site, but are hand cut in the back room. The bleu cheese dressing, all sauces and the cobbler-type desserts are made on-premises. The Bovarian brown bread appetizer loaves and baguettes arrive from Texas by truck. Does SB 1070 allow that? Salted peanuts are no longer automatic, frequency of allergenic attack made them a \"by request only\" item. \n\nKera, Assistant Manager is on the floor, circulating and greeting. She and one other cafe owner are the top circulators where we eat. We've spoken with Joe, the Manager off and on, and another manager some years back. \n\nService is attentive, as mentioned by several other reviewers. My glass is never half empty. We're getting to know Jasmina of the many pens. She and Sweet D are passionate about office supplies. \n\nLone Star is a chain, which BTW Yelp*ers, corporate reads your reviews. My mind keeps it in on the same steak house shelf as two other steak house chains. We've been to all three. Lone Star is the place we return. Price, quality, service, close to where out evening business keeps us. I suggest the old bald plastic cacti be replaced. Someone plucks spines obsessively. I wonder if someone has a Lone Star cactus spine stash at home? \n\nSomebody snarked away on Lone Star, with a mixed list of chains and locally owned places to eat. Rate chains with chains, local with locals, its only fair. Unless you've had one two many giant margaritas, then you'll say whatever you want no matter what. \n\nThis place is fine. I guarantee we'll be back.

Although the service was just fine and the bread & cheese fries were tasty, the rest of the food was either wholly unremarkable or completely unsatisfactory.\n\nI ordered the 8 oz. sirloin (so cold and purple throughout that it could walk off the plate on its own; I know, go ahead and make a face...), with saut\u00e9ed mushrooms and a house salad (no onions, extra ranch dressing) as my sides.\n\nThe salad was very plain and had nothing about it to distinguish it from any other salad anywhere (including one you would make at home or one that you would get from any buffet salad bar anywhere in the nation). I did not expect the salad to be the highlight of the meal, but usually there is something (a spiced up ranch dressing, flavored croutons, etc) that add to uniqueness of a 'house' salad. Not this time. Meh.\n\nWhen my entr\u00e9e showed up, the steak was warm, light pink throughout, rubbery, and absolutely flavorless. No rub, no marinade, and the cut had clearly either been recently frozen or sitting in a fridge for an extended period of time because the flavor of oxidation was rife. Please note that I never expect there to be marinades or rubs on a steak, but then I do expect the cut to stand up on its own (which it did not in this case).\n\nThe saut\u00e9ed mushrooms were particularly disappointing. I love saut\u00e9ed mushrooms. Adore them. I require nothing more than a little butter or oil on them and then just go to town in that pan! The mushrooms I received were a mix of mushrooms that had been saut\u00e9ed to the point of shriveled brown lumps and those that had been held over a warm microwave for 15 seconds. On top of this odd culinary spectrum, there seemed to be nothing but water on them, which didn't do anything to assist in the flavor. A quarter through the meal, I'd had enough and claimed a full tummy (a white lie... forgive me).\n\nAlthough the server was kind and competent, the food was a severe let down and I would never return to this or any other location.

It was accompanied by fried green beans. The sort rib was good. Definitely tender with a real hearty, rich, beefy flavor. There was only 1 scallop. It was a little tougher than the ones showcased at our event. \n\nTrying to minimize the calories, I asked for plain green beans instead. The kitchen sent out the fried which our server quickly noted and corrected, leaving the fried ones for my dinner partner to enjoy. Lacking any substantive willpower, I nibbled one or two and they were quite tasty. A light tempura coating combined with the cooking technique offered a unique, enjoyable flavor. \n\nMy \"plain\" green beans were dressed in olive oil with garlic, salt and pepper (just like I make at home). Still crisp, they were delicious! \n\nSo, I got my wish with the special, but the the regular menu challenges decision-making abilities with so many great options! \n\nMy friend got the beef tenderloin and it was, quite possibly, the best steak I've had in the Valley. It was fabulously tender (even cooked medium well) and perfectly seasoned. I look forward to ordering one for myself on a future visit. \n\nI had heard about the bread pudding from the CMYE reviews and so we splurged with dessert. It was phenomenal! Think the fluffiest, most custardy french toast flavor you've ever had! Thank goodness it was cut into two pieces -- better for a peaceful sharing. \n\nAnother tip from the CMYE, thanks to Don S., I tried the Brophy Clark Pinot Noir ($11/glass) and it was love at first sip! I liked it so much, I called Total Wine to see about buying a bottle for home and searched the vineyard's website for where to buy a bottle in Arizona but didn't get very far.

After some hesitation on his part, he agreed to not requiring a set menu, and I agreed that my party would be patient with the service (which did not end up being a problem at all).  He also did not require a deposit, which was fantastic.\n\nI got there later than I wanted to, as I wanted to arrive a little before my reservation, but I got there exactly at 7:00 p.m.  After saying hello to some friends who had already arrived and were waiting in the bar, our table in the private dining room was ready after just a few moments.  We went in and began sitting down - the private dining room is off to the side of the restaurant (beyond the bar area) and was great for our party of 20.  There is a men's and women's restroom at the end of the dining room which was great as well, and the tables were organized well enough that it felt like we were eating at a single grand dining table.\n\nService was very good, especially considering the amount of people we had and that they were willing to do separate checks.  After getting our drinks ordered and delivered (which took about half an hour), we ordered. \n\nFor appetizers, the table had the hummus, but a few others ordered the green chile queso (very unique and good), the fried eggplant bites (I was hesitant about the goat cheese as I'm not a big fan, but there is not that much and it just enhance the flavors of the whole dish, which was good), and the bacon-wrapped shrimp (YUM).  All of it was good.\n\nPersonally, I also had a cup of the black bean soup (very good, especially if you cannot get enough black beans like myself).  My entree was the surf n' turf pasta, which was really flavorful.  You get two shrimps, which were decent sized, and two medallions of beef, which were cooked well but not overdone.  The fettucine was not al dente but still had a good texture, and the sauce was not buttery/overwhelming.  Everything felt/tasted complimentary, which was a good thing!\n\nWe finished things off with their version of chocolate cake, and they had a pumpkin cheesecake which was interesting, but I would have preferred regular cheesecake.  \n\nAnyways, I wanted to thank the staff here for a great birthday dinner.  Everything tasted great, the service was good and prompt (I don't believe there was a single issue, which is amazing considering they had 20 people all ordering something totally different, without a set menu), and we all had a great time.  We got started a little after 7:00, and we were done a little before 9:40 (from what I can remember).  For 20 people all ordering drinks and food, that was some efficient service!\n\nI would definitely recommend PCG for a big dining party.  They were courteous, professional, and accomodating.

Your description needs tweaking.)\n\nI met my friends at the bar area. I parked out back and walked in via the kitchen area. I did NOT, however, realize I would be walking through a full on kitchen. NOPE. I closed the door in confusion. Double-checked the sign outside that said, \"Enter Here\" and proceeded. A very understanding employee provided me \"directions\" to the bar. \n\nThe bar zig zags around to the hostess stand. This is nice so everyone is not lined up like soldiers and conversations flows. There are standing height tables in the bar area as well. The restaurant section has booths (noted on the way to the bathroom) and copious seating. There is also a private room for events behind the elegant wall of wine.\n\nUsing the company's weekly email we scored a free appetizer. The \"Red chile pork tacos\" come two to a plate and are divine. Grilled pork tenderloin w/chipotle aioli & pineapple fennel salsa. YUM.\n\nHaving had a late lunch I could not possibly justify a decadent dinner. But I desperately wanted to after the tacos. Alas, no. Instead, I enjoyed a mouthwatering cup of the daily soup (Friday is the chicken tortilla). \n\nThe group shared something called \"Crispy Eggplant Bites\". \n\nGoodness!\nRed pepper relish, goat cheese, arugula and a sherry vinaigrette are layered over a crispy heavenly crunchy shell. What this heaven is made of I should have asked. But no, I was too busy inhaling to inquire. (Four to a plate. Big enough for a group to share. IMO. However, I could see a tipsy person opting not to. This stuff is seriously good!)\n\nI also fork sampled my neighbor's plate \"The Original Griddled Corn Cakes\". This is a neat mixture of sweet, spice and well, cheese. And I like cheese!\n\nI'd say I'd come back and eat these things again. But NO. I want to try different things *next* time. Brunch looks a-m-a-z-i-n-g. So does lunch.

(Rule #1 - Never put your gum on the plate.  It doesn't wash off or scrape off that easily. You are a lowly human being if you put your gum on your plate or linen napkin.  Use a disposable napkin or tissue.  Karma will pay back the people who leave gum on plates.)  \n\nOur first two trip to Phoenix City Grille were great.  Friendly staff, delicious food, reasonably priced, and truly great happy hour.  This past visit left a lot to be desired.  Our server was friendly enough, (I believe her name was Sonya).  We ordered our drinks which she brought out quickly.  We ordered our food, and then waited.  The table next to us that was sat after us got there food first.  Not that big of a deal.  Then we asked for some cornbread.  Both times we were there before it was brought out to the table just a few pieces for my husband and I to enjoy.  We thought it was odd we had to ask for it.  She offered us individual pieces, or a skillet.  We asked or a skillet.  At no point did she mention that a skillet of corn bread was $10.  It wasn't until we got the bill and had to track down a manager that we learned if you order (yes order) the corn bread in individual pieces, then it is free.  However they charge for a skillet. I don't recall seeing anything on the menu that said cornbread in a skillet - $10.  The manager was gracious enough to reverse this over sight, but we did not see our server again for the rest of the time we were at Phoenix City Grille.  Another server, not even the manager who resolved our cornbread issue brought us our check, ran the card, and returned the check for us to sign. \n\nThings happen.  Sonya didn't mention the up charge for whatever reason, we disagreed that we had never had that happen before, and the she vanished.  I was a server for years.  People don't always agree with how a business is run, and it's the job of the front line (the servers and front of the house staff) to inform guest of what things cost wither by having a price on a menu, or by telling them up front.  I'm disappointed that the felt she had to run away from us. We'll go back, but now we know, beware of the cornbread up charge.", "business_id": "Pfb6VOIiroqDWOebfgWGPQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-11-18", "type": "review"}

I have been there for happy hour and dinner, but this was my first time for lunch.   I had the PCG pasta, and my friend had the small Bethany Home Salad.   The flavors for my pasta were beyond great.    The chicken consistency was a bit on the soft side.   Was it \"real\" chicken?    Dunno.   It was good, though.    I just found the consistency strange, as though it was chicken that was, what, retextured??   Notwithstanding that fact, I loved the sun-dried tomatoes and the broccoli along with the pasta.    There were crispy tortilla strips in my friend's salad that she didn't want so I put it on my pasta.   This is a hint to the restaurant:   Maybe put those strips on the pasta??   The crispness and flavoring of the corn tortilla strips were a nice compliment to the texture and flavoring of the pasta.   If her salad was \"small,\" I hate to see how large the \"big\" salad is.   I thought it was large enough for a full meal, and she did, too.    She liked her salad.    I tasted it.    I'm not a salad person, but the dressing was good and the ingredients in the salad were appealing to the eye as well as the stomach.

My beef short ribs was so tender and flavorful I was able to cut through with a fork. It came with mashed potatoes and a tasty sauce over. She had the salmon which was equally as tender and flavorful which came with beets. The third and final course was dessert. I had the warm chocolate torte with vanilla ice cream and my GF had the bread pudding. Perfect ending to perfect 3 course dinner. No complaints!

The fried pickles...such a guilty pleasure but I eat them with ease. The wings are also fantastic and so's the calamari.\n\nThe wait-staff are all friendly...every single person I've been served by has been attentive, friendly without being over bearing and sometimes, a big ol' smart ass (specifically Jason the bartender) which is right up my alley. \n\nAny place that has reverse happy hour is a winner in my book seeing as I work late most of the time and rarely get to make that 4-7 slot many places have.

I don't know how they can call them Louisiana shrimp because everytime I've had BBQ shrimp in New Orleans they are good size shrimp.  These were tiny little shrimp drowned in sauce.  The sauce however was good and there is plenty of bread to scoop it up and eat it with.  \n\nThey have several beer options which is nice and a full bar for mixed drinks and shots.  \n\nIf you just are looking for a divish type bar to watch the game at with just decent food then this would be a good spot but there are many options of places like that I feel have way better food. \n\n2.5/5", "business_id": "CqhsIZ7TzCfJTrZqg5-gqQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-09-20", "type": "review"}

So I told her to forget it and to bring our appetizer the hummus and pita bread and my boyfriends order of beef street tacos. His order came first before the appetizer. She blamed this one someone in the kitchen. She did not provide utensils or napkins and she did not bring him the refried beans and rice that came with the order. We didn't mention it and just asked for the the utensils and napkins.\n\nMy boyfriend said taco bell had better tacos than here. There hummus was nothing special however the pita bread was very fluffy and delicous.\n\nShe then came by and asked me if she could get me a brownie or something for all the trouble. ( previously I let her know I do not eat milk or eggs because I am vegan, thought that was a bit of a sick joke. ) I just ignored that and said I'm sure that has milk in it and she laughed and said that was a rhetorical question.  Yea I found that ironic given her lack of waitress skills.\n\nThen the check came. It was the wrong check charged for 2 full street taco meals and hummus with an additional charge of olives which I don't know where that came from. I brought it to her attention that I believe the order was incorrect she again blamed someone in the kitchen for the error again.\n\nI won't be coming back.

I've been going here a couple times a month for close to 4 years. Their food is above average and the atmosphere is decent. Unfortunately, the last time (which will most likely be my last time) I went, the service was less than satisfactory. \n\nIt was a Monday evening. Ordered dinner for two and everything was ok. However, after dinner we went to play a game a pool. A couple of douchebags (whom have been on the sticks for 4 hours according to the Bartender) would not give up the table. Trying to virally threaten my lady and lay down stakes of $100 a game. We immediately informed the staff. Pool is free on Mondays. I figured, after confirming they've been there for 4 hours, that staff would kindly request the drunky's to back down. Wrong! We were informed if we wanted to play a game, we would have to challenge Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum to a game if we wanted to play. They basically allowed these maggots to threaten folks at the bar, didn't cut them off from drinking or nothin' Jesus. Highly disappointing.\n\nWe ordered a dessert once before that was labeled a hot browny with ice cream. When it came out, it was not a hot browny. It was still refrigerated! That's ok. We'll just inform them about the description on the menu and what we were expecting. The owner herself asked us why we eat it if we didn't like it... At this point we had a couple bites, yes. So she asked if she could heat it up. Sure... It was brought back with all the ice cream melted after basically just throwing it in the microwave. \n\nAll in all, you can't expect much from a dive bar like this. It's not like we're going to an actual restaurant. But with so many options near by, you would imagine they would try to keep people coming back. \n\nSo many good places near by.

That hunt for great wings led us to Armadillo Grill and has now turned into a weekly occurrence. I still have a place or two in Central Phx that I haven't tried (yet), but Armadillo Grill has hit the best wings in town, IMO. Yes, they are that good. What's even better is they are half price on \"Wing Wednesday\"! I strongly recommend the Armadillo Gold (Medium spicy), followed by the Honey Hot (Mild). Great seasoning on the wings, amazing sauce. Even their Buffalo (hot) is tasty - I just like the Armadillo Gold too much to venture away from it very often.\n\nI have NEVER had a rude experience with the staff. Minimal issues with service or food, that were always fixed right away and with a smile. \n\nAs for the atmosphere, you just have to know what you are walking into, and the place is great. What it is NOT: Chic, Upscale, Pretentious. What it IS: Really good food, down to earth, and no frills. It's not a \"Dive\", but it's not Twin Peaks, Buffalo Wild Wings, or Zipps either. It has an OTB (Off Track Betting) so finding half a dozen guys betting the ponies is to be expected. It's a \"Bar and Grill\" - not the worst place for a family, but if you bring kids, make sure you sit in the \"restaurant\" area, not at the tables within ear shot of the bar (that seems kind of logical though).\n\nThank you Brenda for giving us our regular \"Wing Wednesday\" hang-out!", "business_id": "CqhsIZ7TzCfJTrZqg5-gqQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-11-19", "type": "review"}

We go here most Mondays for pool as part of date night. Sometimes we have a drink or two, sometimes not. Admittedly, lately it's mainly just a soda for my husband. But the time before that, I did have a drink or two. \n\nWe got there later than usual, and both pool tables were full. So we waited for one to open up and my husband ordered a soda.  \n\nThe bartender tonight wasn't the one we normally have. And after we'd been sitting for about 15 minutes, he asked my husband, who was getting a refill of his root beer, whether we knew that there was a $5 minimum. \n\nHe said that the pool was for their guests. We couldn't just sit there, not buying anything (I guess a soda doesn't count -- I know it's not pricey, but there's a damn high profit margin) and \"just take up space.\" Seriously, that last part is verbatim.\n\nThree things: \n\n1. We weren't holding people up. If there had been a wait, we obviously wouldn't have lingered. When we got there, though, there were a few people at the bar, but at least 10-12 tables were empty. Probably more. \n\n2. I had been considering getting a drink or two. And when I drink, I get the munchies. But I generally don't like to start drinking until we're playing a game.\n\n3. We've been going there on Mondays for around 2 years now. This has never come up. Even a time or two that it was slammed during football games, while we played pool and my husband had a soda while I had a water. No one ever said anything even remotely approaching that.\n\nI'm not saying I wouldn't necessarily understand a $5 minimum though, again, this is the first time I've heard of it. But you'd think an employee would be smart/well-trained enough to not use the words \"take up space\" in reference to the customer he's actually talking to.\n\nOh by the way, the bartender's remarks were especially funny after his comment when my husband got his root beer. He told the guy to leave it open, though he said that might be the only thing he'd be getting. So the bartender told him he could just pay now and still get refills.

Not so when I bring up seafood at McCormick & Schmick's!  We both enjoy the sour dough table bread and butter that is only given when requested.  Lunch items are decent in prices and portions.  I find that the dayshift staff here are more friendly and efficient than the night shift.  The lunch meals flowed very smoothly: glasses always full and extra hot bread brought to the table when asked (w/out our having to repeat ourselves).  Happy hour and dinner services are something else entirely.\n\nI don't deny that happy hour apps are nicely priced.  I've only experienced HH here once, and it took awhile before I found a table I wanted to sit at (outside was noisy and smoky, and the only chairs available by the bar inside were at the ends).  It took quite some time before my server arrived.  I usually only order HH apps since I rarely drink, but she told me I had to order a drink, any drink that costs at least $2.75, before I could take advantage of the HH app specials.  So I ordered my first (and so far, my last) Arnold Palmer, which is a beverage that is half-tea and half-lemonade.  For apps, I tried the clam strips, fish tacos, and the cheeseburger and fries.  I thought the clam strips were too bread-y: not much clam-meat, just batter and seasoning.  It tasted pre-frozen.  The fish tacos were decent, but not filling.  The star app here were the cheeseburger and fries!  The burger was HUGE!!  The fries were numerous in quantity, too!  The pleasant surprise in the value of the burger and fries mitigated the disappointment I felt over the clam strips.  One huge complaint, however, was the fact that my server only saw me once, and that was to get my drink and appetizer orders.  She never came back to check on whether I would like another drink or something else from the HH and dinner menus.  \n\nMom and I had dinner here last night (Saturday).  I couldn't believe how dead it was, considering it was only 8:15p.  We already knew we wanted to order the Dungeness crab and shrimp bisque for her and the mixed grill special for me (salmon, seabass with coconut rice and asparagus, and the shrimp-crabcake, which Mom could have since I have a shrimp allergy (sob!  I LOVE crabcakes!).  The mixed grill entree also comes with creme brulee!  Mom wasn't sure which size soup to order, but our male server told us that the cup was very small in portion, so I asked for the bowl (which, in the end, was too much).  We also asked for bread, which thankfully arrived within a few minutes.  The soup took another ten minutes.  Mom didn't think it was anything special.  Indeed, she thought that the Red Lobster bisque we enjoyed in Illinois years ago was much better.  I do remember the bread bowls of deliciousness from years past; we loved the chunkiness of the RL bisque, as well.  I told her that the higher-tabbed venues seem to serve less-chunky and more silky-smooth pureed bisques (we both agreed that chunky bisques are the best!). The mixed grill took more than 40 minutes from the time I placed the order, which is unacceptable.  Grilled seafood doesn't take long to cook!!  The entree was very delicious, though, but I would be hard-pressed to order it again if it is going to take this long to prepare.  I was also disappointed to see that the coconut rice contained *.  I LOVE *, but my immune system doesn't, and nowhere in the menu description was it mentioned that * were included.  Mom took the tainted half, but I still ended with vertigo and painful abdominal cramps from eating the \"clean\" half (it seemed like the rice was pre-molded in a tiny bowl or ice-cream scoop with the * in the bottom of the mold, and then placed onto the plate).  The * looked beautiful in the presentation (and Mom thought the rice tasted fine), but had I known sooner, I'd have requested them to be omitted, or at least be placed on the side.  I loved the salmon and the seabass, which were perfectly seasoned, but I found the rice too squishy, as if too much liquid was used.  The sticks of asparagus were perfectly crunchy and great in flavor!  Mom absolutely loved the crabcake... I was so jealous!  Service was objectionable: long waiting time, 2nd request for bread was forgotten, and the wait times for the seafood, brulee (yum!), and ticket were too long in between.\n\nHope to give a favorable happy hour update!  I'd like to try some of those grilled salmon cakes Stevie P. mentioned.  I'll have to take everybody's word on the margaritas' goodness... Not much of a drinker to justify my spending $10 on one drink.

Too many veggies, without enough meat, cheese and Tzatziki sauce to counter-balance it. \n\nWhat really bothered me was that they sat my sister and me right behind the kitchen. I don't think they should even have a table right there. I saw everything that was going on in there. Plus, I kept hearing the servers complaining to their boss about shit. One girl was saying something about another server \"not liking her.\" I felt like I was in a high school cafeteria. And, to top it off, it was FREEZING in there. It is never a good idea to have it soooo cold, that your patrons want to get the hell out of there to warm up!\n\nBut, besides my few complaints, it is a fine establishment, although it could definitely improve. I'm sure I'll go back again. But, maybe the next time,I'll stick with my old stand by -- the Santa Fe.", "business_id": "ut-kla-EA23nJOij_dcL0Q", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-10-04", "type": "review"}

Soon after it lost relevance--and went through at least one bankruptcy-- the chain disappeared.\n\nCPK is a nicely-decorated facility at a great location, but besides being the only pizzeria in the Biltmore Fashion Park proper, there is very little reason to visit here. It's not the answer to any current question.\n\nThe pizza is never better than so-so. The toppings are never really that fresh. The salads are an uninspired-though-nicely-arranged pile of iceberg and other ingredients that wouldn't seem extraordinary at Applebee's. In fact, i think Applebee's does salad better. The service tends to be a bit slow. The drinks are pricey.\n\nFor all this indifferent straight-from-Sysco quality, you pay a premium price.\n\nIt's probably been 10 years since this place has had any cachet that might justify the higher prices. Maybe longer. I think they might be hurting since the departure of Planet Hollywood, which itself brought a study stream of cornpone slackjaws impressed by a name--though not enough to keep it in business.\n\nIf you're looking for Pizza in this part of the Camelback Corridor, hold out and go to the Parlor at 19th St.", "business_id": "ut-kla-EA23nJOij_dcL0Q", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-10-27", "type": "review"}

I think 7 checks in all. They seemed cool with it...at first. \n\nI have to preface by saying, the worst service I've ever received has been at the Cheesecake Factory. Out of the four times I've been, every single time has been horrendous. The very first time I went (this was a different location)  one of my dining partners didn't get their meal for 20 minutes after ours. We were completely through with our meals but the server never offered to comp her meal. In fact, he was never seen after taking our order. We had to flag down a manager to take care of the issue. \n\nThe other few times I've had the slowest, rudest service of my life. This time was no different. The server acted thoroughly annoyed by our group, was short with us, refused to smile AT ALL, and generally was a complete wench. Splitting the tab was clearly WAY too much work for her, as it took 20 minutes for her to figure out who ordered what (even though we asked if it was ok to split tabs long before we ordered) but actually running the tabs? Wow, add on another 10 minutes! We apologized again for having to split tabs, hoping maybe that would make her less huffy, but she never acknowledged that we were trying to be nice, and instead just went around acting huffy and like we were thorns in her side. \n\nWell, obviously she could be a total b*tch because gratuity was already included. 18% on the tab, which I understand with large groups. However, I felt she was acting as bitchy as she wanted to because in the end, she'd be getting a good tip regardless. \n\nAs for the food, it's a big whatever. Anything other than lunch is overpriced. In the end it's just overpriced ridiculously sized chain food . I don't understand why people love it so much.

Great job with the remodel! However, I had really a really poor experience. My dad arrived first and a male server came over to greet him (he ordered a beer and water). Then I arrived... No one came over for like 10 minutes. Then my mom arrived and still no one for about another 5-8 minutes. I flagged down another server and told her we needed our server. She looked at me all shocked, and said \"Oh, ok Ill try and find who it is\". Not a very professional response. Anyway, we finally get another girl, who was very sweet, and she said she'd be helping us. As she was getting our drinks the male server finally returned, didn't address us, but asked our \"new server\" to just take the table and passed her my dad's beer... Really unprofessional. We ended up having great service with our new server. The only other thing that bothered me, was that I ordered the taproom steak sandwich.

The Yelp reviews are fairly good, and the food choices seemed interesting.  However, we just had one issue after another during our visit.\n\nTo begin, we really wanted to partake in the happy hour. Unfortunately, they were only allowing patrons on the patio and in the bar use that pricing and menu.  Normally, I would understand this and sit there, but we had a handicapped member of our party who was incapable of sitting at the high-top tables in the bar area, and there was smoking on the patio. Yuck!  We mentioned this to our server, who just said that it was too bad we couldn't take part.  \n\nWe ordered a number of things at our table.  The daily special of brisket (I think) was ordered by 2 of our guests, and it looked and tasted delicious.  I wish I had ordered that!  I shared the queso dip to start.  Great chips, good pretzel bites, but terrible queso!  It reminded me more of a saucer of milk.  It was so ridiculously runny that it just poured off of the chip and made a mess all over the table, as I tried to get it to my mouth.  The taste wasn't bad, but it was just impossible to eat.  The fried chicken, sliders, and grilled cheese were all decent, but none stood out.  I was greatly underwhelmed by the cobbler.  There was very little fruit, and the dessert was greatly lacking. \n\nWhile looking around at other tables, it appeared that many diners has delicious looking meals.  Perhaps the fail was in what we chose to order?  I would consider a re-visit, but this definitely isn't a spot I'm anxious to return to.", "business_id": "rVUEZpHQfWI_3kt0lBwaxQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-11-20", "type": "review"}

I enjoyed the spin-art dip- a more generous portion than most places are serving for appetizers these days, standard flavors, served hot with perfectly salted tortilla chips.\nThe Prawn Cocktail was nothing to write home about- average-sized shrimp and the cocktail sauce was, IMHO, seriously lacking in \"zest.\" Then again, I like a pretty kickin cocktail sauce, full of horseradish.\n\nI held back on the \"stars\" since we didn't order meals, but Chad, our server, didn't bat an eye when we announced we weren't having dinner- just delivered the check quickly and politely. \n\nI may up the \"stars\" when we go back- saw several menu items that looked enticing, including S'Macs- baked mac and cheese in several varieties, prime rib with goat cheese mashed potatoes and pan-seared halibut. \n\nI'll be back... probably soon.

Neat-O! \n\nNot only is he the bees knees he was hands on. I was, quite frankly, surprised by that. But more on that in a minute!\n\nTo frame my experience, I popped in on a Tuesday night during the dinner rush. One of our friends had hopped on over ASAP to nab a table. (Apparently this place is hopping. She was spot on!)\n\nIt's a really cute place that is friendly to all sorts of different folks. \n\nIf you want to watch the game? Sure! TV at the bar. \nFeel like eating at the bar? Yep!\nCasual dining? Absolutely.\nDinner date (where you want to impress)? YES. \n\nI was (not on a date) but did see a number of couples engaged in serious conversation over wine. It's not too loud of a place (at least on a Tuesday night) to foster intimate conversation. \n\nFor dinner I followed the menu's guidance (and then asked Wally himself). Chicken Vesuvius is w-o-n-d-e-r-f-u-l! Chicken medallions, artichoke hearts, kalamata olives, 'cider' smoked bacon (HOH MY) with plenty of herbs and spices. My meal was served with a hearty portion of salad and (HOH MY) horse radish mashed potatoes.\n\n1) The chicken was cooked to perfection. Not a hint of dryness!\n2) The chicken wasn't bathed in oil. That sounds like a terrible way to describe it, but, I didn't feel like I was tossing a gym session out the window. \n\nThat being said, note that portions are on the very [very] generous side. I took 2/3rd of it home.\n\nRight. So about Wally, the impeccable service and a delightful experience... Let's see...Our server described the specials with such delight that I only wished I was going off menu. But no! I wanted something \"regular\" on the menu. Wally was incredibly helpful in helping this first timer navigate the full menu. (Alas, the house was out of the nightly special of ribs.) Wally has a comedic sense of timing. Watch out!\n\nOk, so what's the deal with Wally's fantastic beard? Were you thinking Ernest Hemingway? Why yes! In fact, Wally and his son enter a contest every year for the best E. Hemingway beard in FL. \n\n[Drum Roll] They are 2013 crowned winners!\n\nThis is a great spot if you're popping in to AJ's.

I did not feel like it lived up to the rave reviews but it was good enough to bring me back to enjoy some food and drink with an old friend.  That time I had ordered their shrimp cocktail while I waited for my friend to arrive, I was starving! As I was eating, the owner (I assume) came up to introduce himself and asked if I live in the area (most of the patrons do)...as I turned back towards the bar to eat my very last jumbo shrimp, the Katie Perry look alike grabbed my food and dumped it in the trash! She never even asked if I was finished. I asked her if she decided that I was done eating and then she asked if I wanted another shrimp from the kitchen but I felt awkward at that point and told her no. She still brought me one lonely shrimp on a huge plate with no cocktail sauce. The sauce is what makes the shrimp cocktail. My friend and I then ordered their spinach dip.  The dip was brought out and as the plate was lowered to the bar, my chips were sliding off onto the bar and she just scooped them back on to the plate. I personally was not thrilled about that. I scooped some spinach up on to my dirty chip, blew on it a little and took a bite. This dip was the hottest (heat wise) thing that I have ever had in my mouth. I would compare it to biting the rack in a broiler.  I was never warned that they heat their dip up so hot. I guarantee the work of a microwave! I burned myself so bad that my mouth was peeling and bleeding. It took over a week of peroxide rinses, colloidal silver rinses and salt water rinses to heal my mouth. My mouth is actually scarred inside! This burned me so terribly that my teeth were sore, my jaw hurt and even my sinuses on that side of my mouth hurt. When I stopped in to tell the brunette bartender about my burn and I advised that they should warn people about how hot they make it, she replied with \"Well, don't scarf your food down, let it cool first.\" Totally rude, offensive and bad customer service with a reply like that. That same night that I burned my mouth, my friend was using their hot sauce to spice up her chip and the bartender came over and started twisting the lid back on without asking if she was done and my friend had to stop her from taking it away. She clearly has issues with letting people finish their meal. When it came to the bill she had to ask us how many drinks we had because she wasn't keeping track... It seriously was not a lot of drinks to keep track of either. I think this place would be OK if it wasn't for this bartender. I did order a salad on a separate occasion (when I warned her about the hot dip) and that proved to be disappointing as well, way too much dressing and she kept giving me a hard time for not drinking during my work hour.

We were on a quick weekend get away in Scottsdale for my 32nd birthday, and I booked this place to celebrate with the love of my life. \n\nBoy oh boy, what a disappointment !!! We arrived, and I was impressed with the atmosphere, decor, and the fantastic view stretching across the phoenix urban sprawl. When we checked in with reception, we were informed that we would have a 10mn wait to be seated outside.\n\n\"10mn ? Not a problem !\", I said, and continued on to state that we would grab a drink at the bar and sit outside to take a look at the view, while we waited to be seated in the dining area.\n\nAnd we waited. And waited. And waited. All the time, seeing free seats being taken by others (although there was no one waiting behind us). We ended up asking about it, and they were quite rude, did not apologize, and ended up telling us that they had been looking for us, but we were no where to be found, which is IMHO a load of bullocks, given that we had made eye contact with the floor manager several times during our wait. In the end, we got seated by the bus table, still outside, my mood souring by the minute... but hey, it was my birthday, I wasn't going to let something like that ruin the moment.\n\nI wasn't surprised by the prices, as I knew what we were getting into. I was however, surprised by the crappy quality of the dinner we had for the $ we paid. \n\nThey brought the perfunctory \"amuse gueule\", which was a joke, to be honest. If I was a restaurant manager, I would be literally embarrassed by what they deigned to serve: 2 table spoons of some sort of artichoke bisque served in a large mug... makes you feel like someone scraped the bottom of a soup pan and was serving you yesterday's leftovers from the local penitentiary. I was quite unimpressed. Gordon Ramsey would have had a fit.\n\nAt this point, we were also annoyed with the high powered, halogenic lights, that are pointed right in your face, literally blinding you when the beams catch you at the right angle... I was starting to have a head ache, as was my wife.\n\nThey then came around to serve us some bread and pesto butter, which I must say was pretty nice tasting.... (but come on,... how hard is it to screw up bread??).\n\nWe perused the wine menu, and decided to order a South African white chardonnay, from the Stellen Bosch region (Mirlest white)... which was pretty good. Nice touch was that we didn't finish the bottle, and they re-corked and bagged it for us before leaving... which was a plus...\n\nAs a starter, I had the pan seared foie gras... which was a bit too gelatinous for my liking (have had way better)... the waffles were a nice touch. It reminds me of a restaurant in Paris that used to serve foie gras with ginger bread... quite nice... the sweet and salty combo always works wonders.\n\nMy wife ordered the Chevre walnut tarte... one piece of advice... stay the hell away from it. Its mainly a medley of thick, sandy crust and walnut powder,  with ABSOLUTELY NO DETECTABLE trace amounts of goat cheese.... For 11$, it was an absolute rip off. The server initially didn't react when we told him that this dish was absolutely not a success... however, he did later take it off the bill.\n\nMy wife just had a really unlucky evening. Being vegetarian, she ordered the Vegetarian Trilogy.  What this ended up being was a soggy vegetable lasagna, served with a supposed macademia truffle sauce that tasted more like peanut butter, except that it was even more bland and greasy.... The truffle scented gnoccis that we ordered as a side dish, looked like, and tasted like stale, soggy, greasy fries... yuck.\n\nI however ordered the diver's scallops and lobster, which was pretty good. Not the softest lobster, but damn tasty, and the scallops were perfect, and huuuge. \n\nNo dessert, as we were pretty disgusted with the whole experience.\n\nNet/net: expensive place, crap value for money, food is totally hit and miss, but the view is nice, if they can deign paying attention to the service they provide....", "business_id": "3Zsjlum5kl5N5KV712aTMQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2007-11-02", "type": "review"}

On Saturday we finally made it, and I wish that we hadn't waited as long as we did.  This restaurant was fantastic, and far exceeded my expectations.  I am always skeptical of restaurants in this price point, especially when you assume that you may be just \"paying for the view\".  Not true at all.  The food at Different Pointe of View can stand up to the creativity and quality of any other high end restaurant in town.  I had the Port Cabernet Braised Kobe Short Rib: Fresh Sweet Corn Polenta, Chanterelle Mushrooms, Endamame & Blue Berry Balsamic Reduction as an appetizer.  It was delicious and unique, and my only complaint was that there was not more of it.  My wife had the lobster bisque with Heirloom Cauliflower & Lobster Timbale, it too was remarkable, but I was glad that I got the short rib.  For entrees I had the Cedar River Prime New York Strip: Pancetta Chervil Rosti Potato, Braised Artichoke Heart & Portabellas Sherry Caramelized Onion Reduction.  There was a lot going on in this dish, and I appreciated every bit of it.  The steak was perfect and the carmelized onion reduction was incredible.  My wife had the Palo Verde Farms Pork Tenderloin with Chorizo Stuffing: Piquillo Pepper Parmesan Risotto, Sweet Corn & Baby Zucchini Succotash, Caramelized Tree Ripened Peach & White Balsamic Olive Oil Emulsion.  This had a ton of flavor and she loved it.  The risotto was really my favorite part of the dish, but the pork was excellent.  We both had some standard desserts - i had creme brulee which was good, but nothing special, and she had the Chocolate Amandine: Milk Chocolate Mousse and Vanilla Amaretto Cream, which I wish that I had gotten.  We did not sit on the patio, but I cannot imagine a more beautiful place to eat, and I will certainly reserve my table well in advance on our next trip to make sure that we sit outside.

I found several recommendations for 'Different Pointe of View'. \n\nWe arrived around 6pm and were seated inside at a table that was front center looking out over the valley. BEAUTIFUL view!!! The restaurant was clean and very quiet. During our visit only 3 other parties dined. If you want a quiet atmosphere, you will find it here. I found it odd that there wasn't background music.\n\nWe ordered the Lobster Bisque and a Strawberries & Baby Wild Arugula salad. Both were fresh and very tasty. We followed with our main courses, Cold Water Diver Scallops and Wild California Halibut. Our waiter attempted to have the sommelier select a wine for us but he was no where to be found. The Maitre d' finally came over to assist. He made selection that they didn't have. I selected a Merlot and it was very good. They have an impressive wine list and cellar.  Our main courses arrived and I knew right away that my wife was not happy with her scallops. My halibut was delicious. We tried each others and I found the scallops VERY over seasoned, burnt on the exterior and cold in the center.... they were to the point of almost being inedible. Our waiter did not return to see how the meal turned out so I switched meals with my wife. It was her birthday and I avoided raising a disturbance when our waiter finally returned, after we had finished our meal. I ate the worst $32 main course of my life.

Anyway, I had a fantastic dinner here the other day which started off with a delicious glass of  Seghesio Zinfandel ($12) and an amuse bouche that was some sort of minty-pea gazpacho soup. Both delicious, leaving me excited for the rest of the meal. \n\nFor my appetizer I got their Hydroponic Butter Lettuce Salad ($13) which was super tasty with the caramelized nectarine dressing. I found the the toasted pistachios one of the best parts of the salad as it helped offset the sweetness from the dressing, which was always a yummy experience in my mouth. The bread service came with choices between a foccacia and a mild sourdough to try with their three different spreads consisting of a goat cheese olive oil emulsion, some sort of pepper pesto olive oil, and a spicy butter mixture. The pepper pesto spread was the table favorite.\n\nI ordered the Grilled Cedar River Marinated Hanger Steak ($32) that come atop a scrumptious basil blue cheese risotto mixed with chopped portabella mushrooms and drizzled with a roasted tomato garlic olive oil emulsion. Oh my gosh, so good! I was debating between the Hanger Steak or the Featured Risotto, but get the steak because you get the best of both worlds! My lovely date ordered Pork Tenderloin Noisettes ($26) that wasn't nearly as exciting as my entree, but still good.\n\nDessert time left us trying the Classic Creme Brulee ($9) and Apples on the Rocks ($9). The creme brulee was the typical rich taste, but it came with a buttermilk blue cheese cookie! Oh man, that led to another party in my mouth with the combo of sweet and salty goodness. The Apple dessert came in a lowball glass (get it, \"on the rocks\") which was pretty cute. It came with a scoop of apple spice ice cream and a scoop of vanilla cream ontop of an oatmeal cranberry cookie and drizzled with caramel. It was good, but the blue cheese cookie was really memorable so I recommend getting the brulee for that reason.\n\nThe restaurant is located on the top of North Mountain in North Phoenix with floor-to-ceiling glass windows.

Don't even try.  It's not worth it.  The hotel has a service where they will drive you up there ... I'm pretty sure it's complimentary but check with the hotel.\n\nSo we get in and nobody to greet us.  I was disappointed and a little confused b'c for a minute there, we had no idea what was going on.  When the hostess finally showed up, however, we were welcomed and seated promptly.  \n\nOur waiter (Bob I think was his name) was exceptional.  He told us about the evening special and was very attentive throughout the entire evening.  My husband and I aren't really fancy people so coming to places like this kind of intimidate us but he was very personable and I'm pretty sure he knew we didn't \"fit in\" with the crowd there.\n\nThe view is awesome.  WOW.  We really enjoyed having a view of the city in front of us as we dined.\n\nI had the lobster and the husband had the duck.  Both of our meals were delectable.  We also shared a side dish of risotto which was also very savory and delicious.  The lobster tasted fresh and succulent.   I was very surprised considering we live in Phoenix!  No dousing of the lobster in butter to make it tasteful - it was perfect just the way it was (as it should be!).  \n\nWe also shared a dessert ... I can't remember the name but it was chocolate peanut butter something-a-ruther with Snicker's ice cream I think?  Anyway, that was good, too.  \n\nThis place definitely ain't cheap but for the experience, it was well worth coming here.

You park yourself, and when you step out of the car the ground is slanted which makes your brain feel like you are somewhat drunk...very weird feeling.  Then you huff and puff up the hill to the location...not that hard but I like to be dramatic.\nThe building is 32 years old they told me, but, to me, looks older because of the design.  It is lovely, tho, and very serene.\nI had parked at the end where the parking lot ends facing the hill going down.  Now comes the fun when you leave.  You gotta go into reverse cause if you go into drive you shoot over the parking lot, down a super steep hill and kill yourself.  So, it's important you go into reverse, turn your car around carefully because all the smart people parked in the rows back of you and slowly get out of the parking spot.  Once you do that and straighten the car out it's literally all downhill...not scary once you get out of that parking spot.\nThe head Manager of the restaurant have big delivery trucks that are scared to drive up there.  I get it totally with a big truck!\nSaturday night had a steady stream of couples coming in to sit, have a drink and stay for a little while before dinner (I guess).  \nLike I said, this is my new go-to place.

'unfortuantely it's not one of the featured items OR I could do that for an extra sur-charge'). We ordered our starters and entrees, never did he ask if we enjoyed our starters but when he did ask about the main course he walked by saying \"enjoying?\" while not waiting for a resonse.

I don't think there was anything to complain about really. The server, (Ian, I think) was wonderful. He was knowledgeable about wines as well as everything on the menu including the special of the day. One of the reasons I picked this place is because they have several gluten free items from which to choose. First, we had what I consider the best table in the place, right at the far southwest corner. Perfect view, wish we could have come at sunset, surely it would have been spectacular. We started off with red wine and pork belly for the appetizer. What I will share is that we thought we only ordered one, to share, but they brought us two, no worries, we enjoyed them. Then we had salads. My friend ordered the steak and I got the chicken, so we could try each others. Both were just fabulous. I was way too full for dessert but my friend made room for creme brulee which was very tasty. The entire meal was nicely done and enjoyable. The meal was not inexpensive, but you kind of know that going in, ours with tip was just over $200.", "business_id": "3Zsjlum5kl5N5KV712aTMQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-11-30", "type": "review"}

This place is really cool, lots of booths and tables, a nice bar and killer food on the menu.   This is a Green Bay Packers bar so when they are playing the place is packed. They have TV screens everywhere with all different kinds of sports playing so when their isn't a packers game you can get a comfy spot.  The servers and staff are top notch. They have a train that runs along the ceiling of most of the place.  It's fun to watch.  We love to come here for the yummy drinks (they just added a new drink menu with awesome sounding fruity drinks - YAY!) and their Philly cheese steaks, which are big and cooked to perfection.  I believe on Thursdays they offer cheese steaks for a percentage off.  They have all kinds of things on the menu, not just bar food - pizza and wings, down home favorites, Mexican items.  There is a nice mix and I still haven't tried it all.  We love their potato skins and cheese curds.  Gotta have those since this is a Wisconsin bar - land of cheese!  My particular fave item to order is Chicken Fried Chicken.  You get two breaded breast pieces with white gravy, mashed potatoes with white gravy, a roll with butter and the best sauteed vegetable I have ever had at a restaurant.  I am not sure what they do to them but I thought about them for a week and had to go back again just to have them again.  This place is a mile from us and our favorite local hangout.

We headed north toward the Harkins North 16 Cinema and stumbled upon Denny's.  We still had plenty of time before our movie, or so we thought.\n\nThe entryway was warm and crowded with people waiting.  Only a ten minute wait was indicated, so we decided to stay.  When we were seated, we noticed the restaurant itself seemed a bit warm as well.  We waited a very long time just to have our presence recognized by a server.  Eventually, beverage orders were taken.  Coffee was delivered without an offer of creamer and we labored another five minutes just to make eye contact with anyone who could bring us some.  Food orders were finally taken and were served in a reasonable amount of time, although there was a significant amount of time between when the first person in our party and the last was served.  Not a big deal, but it's awkward to postpone eating until everyone is served and awkward when they insist that you go ahead and eat.\n\nWell, it's Denny's.  The food was fine.  Uninspired.  Just what you'd expect.  Given that you can eat at a really good breakfast joint just a few blocks away, however, I'm just not sure why you'd want to settle for this.  I'm pleased that the Original Breakfast House treats their employees well with the day off, but I doubt that I would ever head back to Denny's anytime OBH was open.\n\nBy the time we were finishing, we had used all of our available time and felt as though we'd been eating in a sauna.  The restaurant never cooled down.  Not revealed to us when we checked in was the not insignificant fact that their air conditioning was broken.  Not all of their air conditioning.  Only the part where their patrons were seated.  Revealing this tidbit of information to customers when they came in the door would have been the honorable thing to do.  Yes, we probably would have elected to go elsewhere, but it's what any good restaurant would do for their customers.  But not Denny's.      \n\nThis Denny's is nice in appearance and some employees seem well intentioned.

My family and I have been going to 40th St Cafe since I was a kid and it has a special place in my heart.  My mom was at 40th St Cafe every day for coffee, many days for lunch, and we often went for dinner. Being a single mom, raising two boys, she also was allowed to pick up shifts to earn extra money. When she was hospitalized for pneumonia, the cafe fed my brother and I. One of her dreams was to take us back to New York and show us where she grew up, but we could never afford it. . After she was diagnosed with cancer, the cafe staff, and some of the regulars raised enough money to send my mom, brother, and I to New York for a week with spending money. Our whole family was also there for a big reunion. It is a trip we will never forget. 5 years ago, we lost my mom to breast cancer. Every year, the cafe participates in the Walk for the Cure in honor of my mom and others that have passed. \n  I live in Gilbert now, so I do not go as often as I would like, but any opportunity to get to that side of town, 40th St Cafe is where I will go. Peggy's Pies are incredible! Best in the valley. If you like good home cooked meals, this is the place to go. I usually end up ordering the Cobb Salad with Blue Cheese dressing. They make their own Blue Cheese, and it is amazing, different than what you are used to. I also love their Guacamole Burger. For breakfast, you cannot go wrong with the Ultimate Skillet. \n  So if you are anything like me and like to bring business to people who really go the extra mile to make a difference in people's lives, then go check it out.

For a Tuesday morning, it was BUSY.  Only a couple tables open.  My waitress Sherrie was a total delight; I never saw a smile leave her face.\n\nI ordered a breakfast sandwich on a croissant (75 cents extra, totally worth it), sub bacon instead of ham, and sub scrambled eggs instead of the over hard egg just like I saw in a picture here on yelp.  It was great!  Loads of bacon, the eggs were great (not dry like other breakfast places like to serve you).  The hashbrowns were good - although not seasoned at all, like another reviewer noted, so I had to salt them myself... but that seems to be a norm for breakfast places like these, since a lot of their clientele is of the older generation who can't handle salt.\n\nLots of regulars here, lots of people just sitting drinking coffee and reading the paper.  Although one woman was totally rude and annoying - my waitress was taking the order of a woman sitting at the table next to me, and a woman at the table across the aisle threw her wadded-up straw wrapper at the waitress while she was taking the order - it almost landed in the full pot of coffee on the table - then apologized to the customer getting her order taken, saying she was trying to hit the waitress, and let out the most ungodly hyena-like guffaw I've ever heard.  I get that you know the waitress and you're trying to be funny, but jesus christ.  Have some respect and try to contain yourself.

So, while vacationing in Phoenix yet one more time, we were trying to re-live good old times, we returned.  Sadly, this time it was not meant to be a happy experience for all.\n\nSeeing meatloaf on the menu is Mr. B's signal to stop looking. But, too bad. This meatloaf sandwich was beyond salty. I think if the chef had practiced some restraint on the salt, the meatloaf might have been wonderful.  It had a unique sweetness (perhaps the bell pepper?) that I thought was good. But then there were also the powdered mashed potatoes covered with a salty brown gravy and the overcooked green beans. Frankly, it did not cut it. I knew I would hear about it later.\n\nMy breakfast was supposed to be a home baked biscuit topped with ham and egg and gravy.  I requested my biscuit be served separately and they kindly provided it on a separate plate with some butter.  Huge and thick it was, but you and I know being big does not necessarily make it better.  This biscuit was dense and doughy. I was going to give it the benefit of the doubt and picked out one blackberry jam packet from a carrier set on the table.  And lucky I did.  The waitress came by and smilingly asked me if I had enough jam.  Not getting her drift, I said yes.  Then she, without further ado, commandeered that little jam organizer and presented it to another table.  Whut? Is this yet another recessionary tactic?\n\nMy eggs were scrambled nicely. And the smokey ham was thinly sliced and tasty. The sausage gravy was delicious.  But I was still reeling from the jam thievery. As it turned out, I was not that impressed with the biscuit and ended up leaving the outsides on the plate and eating the buttered innards with my teaspoon of jam. So I guess she did me a favor so I wouldn't eat so many carbs without thinking.\n\nBTW - The hashbrowns were perfect. Soft inside and crispy outside. Ate em all.\n\nCoffee is by Farmer Brothers. A brew that is too light for my liking. I passed.\n\nSo, while my breakfast was OK, the meatloaf was a complete let down.\n\nI doubt I will be able to get Mr. B back.

On our most recent visit, my husband's omelette had hardly any cheese in it, the french toast that our girls shared wasn't that great, and the \"apple butter\" it came with wasn't really apple butter.  Maybe it's an east coast thing that people don't know about out here, but apple butter doesn't contain butter at all.  Not in my book.  But, as I was saying, this was just apple-cinnamon flavored butter.  It was tasty, but I thought I would be adding something somewhat nutritious to their french toast when I requested it.  Quite the opposite...  To continue, the gravy for my country fried steak tasted fantastic- peppery and creamy and delicious!  But my eggs were completely undercooked and I had to send them back.

So he through on two handfuls of onions and told me they were out of the other ingredients.  I had to ask for my money back and left with no salad.  The manager - Dan didn't really seem to care.\n\nI will not return to this store until its management changes.  Over the years i have been there dozens of times.

But Marcel's has my vote on where I like to hang out with friends and just drink and sing!\nEdit: 6/11/11: Brad is now the karaoke host. He by far exceeds my expectations. He has the best karaoke system in the valley and best song list. He does not play favorites and is FAIR in his rotation. We have been a regular at this place for years now. The bartenders and servers are wonderful. The food is just ok. Bar food what do you expect? But they usually have a special going on. I love this bar.", "business_id": "g4y3_YqR4jmfCP9K0TzxrQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-09-01", "type": "review"}

Also Happy Hour here is great too LOW prices on Domestics 11-7 daily   yes 11-7 ....
