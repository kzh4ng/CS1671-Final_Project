I've had at least 10 since then, but only during the Lent season.  I gave my 5 rating based on the fish sandwich alone.  Try it without a bun also!  Either way you get 3 nice size pieces of fish equal to a pound.  You can have your choice of sides, but I always get the small mac n cheese for my side.  The staff is always really friendly and service is prompt.  It's in a rough neighborhood, but the Rankin police station is right across the street.

Have been there during the years it was less than clean, to the present where it is almost clean. This place is a neighborhood standard that for some reason compels you to return, even if your experience was less than stellar. Fancy it is not. Gourmet it is definitely not. Every item on the menu seems to come from a can, bag ,bucket or box. The wait staff is often clueless and changes like the wind. I have never had the same server twice. But the fact is you get a decent meal for a decent price and always have a little to take home. Yes, the salad bar is very basic. Not every item is a fresh as it should be. The iced tea often takes on the taste of Lord knows what. However,  the fried fish dinner is one of the best I have had anywhere in Picksburg. Their meatloaf is terrific as are several of their hoagies. In a nutshell, this place has a lot of flaws. Like we all do. A few upgrades like a better wait staff, fresh gravy instead of their gallon bucket brand, homemade sauce instead of whatever canned stuff they are using would jump this review to 5 stars.

I have no idea who gave this place high reviews but they must either own the place or be time travelers from back in the day when this place might not have sucked. The decor is tired and grimy, the place reeked of smoke, and the bartender/server was surly, to put it mildly. We went there on a Saturday night with a mind to try the Irish food. Apparently, we were out of luck. I've always thought that the secrets of restaurant success is to actually stock food for people to eat. He told us before we ordered that they had no \"pies\". No chicken pot pie, no shepherds pie, etc. So, we gamely tried to order other things. We placed our order. My wife, for example, ordered the Irish stew and he came back 5 min later telling us they were out of that and even more things for several people in our party. At that point my wife picked out a third option, ham and cabbage, only to be told again that \"they were out\". At that point, realizing that the only food to be had in the place was what was crusted on the menus, we asked to pay for our drinks and left. They actually then gave us flack for not having enough to put it on a debit card. In short, unless you like your dinner with a side of disappointment and depression, I'd probably avoid this place like the plague.

I also ordered the pita pizza, i would not recommend this as it just wasn't very good.  \n\nI am looking forward to returning to Duke's this summer when I can sit outside and enjoy some craft beer and those delicious wings.", "business_id": "1qCuOcks5HRv67OHovAVpg", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-05-07", "type": "review"}

Everywhere you look, there are signs that say kids must be accompanied by an adult, but apparently no one was honoring that at 6PM on a Saturday. I couldn't even walk through the place without someone shoving me. AHHH!\nI get that Dave and Buster's is an arcade and that you're going there to play some games, maybe eat, and kill some time. When I last went there a few years ago, we there for my bachelor party, and while I'm sure we got into some shenanigans, I don't remember children running wild there. We were having adult beverages, playing games, and having a good time. This time, it was ridiculous. It isn't Chuck E. Cheese, yet that's how parents seem to be treating the place.\nOn top of that, the customer service sucked. The place is gigantic, with tables and serving areas everywhere, yet on a Saturday at 6PM, the hostess told us (after interrupting us three times to chat with the other hostess) told us it would be a three hour wait, despite the fact that there were empty tables all over the dining room. I suspect this is a ploy to get you to play games and spend money until you're table is ready, but the food at Dave and Buster's is not worth a three hour wait on any day.\nThe hostess told us we could be served right away if we went to the midway and found an empty table, so we attempted that. Most of those tables were empty with usually one or two adults at a giant empty table filled with coats who informed us that they needed the table because their kids would be back soon after playing games. Next, i engaged in the most rudest thing I've ever done- I began stalking tables where people were finishing up. I would walk up to people paying their check, ask if I could have their table when they were done, and they would inform me that there were already two or three people who asked them and I should get in line.\nFinally, we found a table and proceeded to spend two hours eating dinner. It wasn't because we ordered a lot of food- it was that the waiter took forever to bring our food out. He seemed to have no problem getting us fresh drinks, until we drank as much as we could and then asked for water. After that, he seemed to come around a lot less. \nI had the build your own chicken tacos, which comes on a giant plate with all kinds of fixings. The fixings were fresh, but the chicken was cold and dry, and the tortillas were dried out as well. For $14, it wasn't worth it. \nAfter dinner we proceeded to play games, which entails shoving people to get through areas and waiting in line to play anything. \nAll in all, I didn't like my experience at Dave and Busters. I remembered it being a fun place to go and unwind as an adult. but between all the kids and the crappy service, can't recommend this place. If anyone asks me to go back, I may elect to stay home and poke my eyes with a fork.", "business_id": "sbW8qHJgzEIH42B0S-3New", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-04-23", "type": "review"}

I was excited! I haven't been to this Dave and Buster's since I was younger and was ready to go back and play me some games! I went with my cousins, mind you, we hadn't ate all day and were very hungry. So, we decided to do the Eat & Play Combo, naturally. Here's where it gets bad. First of all, we get a very snobby hostess that shows us to our table. Then, we wait...and wait...and finally after about 25 mins we get a waitress. Her name was Ashley. We had plenty of time to decide what we wanted, so we quickly put our order in. Next, we were sitting and talking, waiting, we had empty glasses and our waitress had never even come around to see if we needed refills except for one time. She said she'd come back right away with our refills...yea, right. 20 mins later we get our refills. Mind you, our food still hasn't came yet. I see other people getting their food that had come in after us. I was frustrated. After waiting 45 mins for our food, I asked to speak with a manager. One of the servers who I asked replied rudely with \"Well, he's really busy right now. I doubt he'll be able to come out and talk to you\". Finally, 15 mins later...that's one hour, folks. We get our food. What do you think the next problem was? Yep, the food was cold. I was completely fed up at this point, and told my waitress how disappointed I was, especially after driving one hour just to have this terrible service. The manager never came to speak with me, and we didn't even receive our meals for free. The only compensation we got were $10 game cards. Woopty-doo. The only thing good about this place is the games, but the prizes you get for your tickets are all junk and worthless. So, in conclusion...I DO NOT RECOMMEND THE WATERFRONT DAVE AND BUSTERS OF HOMESTEAD, PA.

Speaking of that, I've been here a few times, but never wrote a review for D&B. \n\nI'm a kid at heart and honestly do enjoy the games. However, there have been multiple instances where I swiped my game card & it took my credits, but no game began. There have also been times that I won and no tickets were released. I guess nothing is perfect but it does happen atleast once a visit (each scenerio)  It's hard to find a worker walking around and for half-price games, you kind of just take your loss with the 1.3 credits for skee ball (hmph!)\n\nThe food- it really isnt anything too fancy. I've had okay food, but super long wait times for a simple chicken fingers & fries for example. It's your basic sandwiches, salads, appetizers & a few pastas. I believe all sandwiches & burgers are around $10 & served with fries.  You can get the Eat & Play deal which includes food from a specific menu + a game card. Besides the game card deal, if you wanted to make D&B a date night you might be better off heading to another place to eat in Waterfront for amazing food.. but to each their own.  Try it once I suppose. The brownie sundae that i devoured last night was satisfying (2 brownies, 2 scoops of ice cream.. one with chocolate syrup; the other with raspberry sauce & fresh strawberries. Oh & whip cream)\n\nDrinks- pretty weak. We ordered 2 liquid maryjanes (2 each that is) which are filled with multiple shots of alchy & didn't really catch a buzz. Oh welllll. They do have a happy hour from 5-7pm. I'd go during that time for the best deal. I believe cocktails are half off & $3 off  bottles of wine. I've never seen anyone walking around with a wine glass though lol. \n\nThe prizes- as others have noted, the prizes are a little cheap for the amount of tickets they \"cost\" However, it's cool to leave with a D&B coffee mug, cup or shot glass. Last night for 2500 tickets we decided on magnetic-style dart board (1,300?) a coffee mug, a D&B glass (our plastic one bit the dust) & a D&B coffee travel mug.. I might be missing a few odds & ends.\n\nOverall it's a fun time but can be pricey. It's best to head here Wednesday for half price games or get the Eat & Play deal while dining. \n\nI can't lie though, I find myself smiling ear to ear a few times within those 3 hours (woah, seemed longer than amount of time :D ) Speaking of which, in that time-frame we played 250 credits (cost= $40) but it was half-price games.", "business_id": "sbW8qHJgzEIH42B0S-3New", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-03-27", "type": "review"}

We'd never dream of eating there because we like healthy yuppie food. And we only drink cheap drafts OR drink cocktails during happy hour.\n\nYour visit is largely determined by time of day, expectations and whether or not you eat their food. If you come on a Friday night, the lines will be long. You'll pay $150 for the two of you to eat, drink and play for 3 hours and you'll be left with a very sour taste in your mouth.\n\nThe staff is really excellent; any issue with a game not paying out tickets results in immediate help and extra tickets or a swipe for a different game from an employee. \n\nNote the \"drinks are weak\" reviews. Also notice it was people buying shots and ordering multiple drinks per person. That's typical white trash behavior. Bartenders here are savvy; they mirror the behavior of the guests. All of our drinks have been consistently strong and well put together because we're courteous and tip well. I have witnessed bartenders bypass tattooed, loud guests and address me and take my order first. This is rational, logical behavior. \n\nAlso note the \"prize center games suck\" comments. You're supposed to stack tickets over multiple visits and use them on a big prize. Like life, delaying gratification nets you bigger returns. Every other visit I've seen someone walk out with a video game system (Wii, Xbox360 and even a few Xbox One's). \n\nThe thing about Dave & Busters is the crowd changes depending on day of week and time of day. Sunday afternoon it's all families and Friday and Saturday night it's all drunk 20 somethings. The atmosphere changes and that's why the reviews are all over the place.\n\nThis review is based on 8ish months of 1-3/monthly visits. Most visits are 5 stars, some are 4 stars.\n\nUsing survey receipts for Buy Ten Get Ten, avoiding Wednesday, Friday or Saturday evenings (and Sunday afternoon, families) and avoiding the food entirely and drinking cheaply, you'll have a great experience for $25-40/person.\n\nI really enjoy the staff too, they split the difference between fun and professional.

I understand the prices of the play cards and won't dispute them; however, the food was incredibly over-priced, came out COLD (as in, sat on a counter without warmers for a minimum of 30 minutes) and I literally had to ask the bartender if there was any vodka in my drink. It was pure juice. $38 for three shots that had little-no alcohol in them. (Not to mention, my glass was dirty, and I saw the bartender scoop the glass into the ice basin because she was too lazy to use the sanitary scoop. I know the Food and Beverage Commission would be as disappointed as I was.) The service was terrible. Don't ask for anything from your waiter, as they are a little too busy on their cell phones or conversing amongst themselves. \n\nWas it fun to be in an adult-themed arcade? Yes.

We flagged down a server, who issued us a card ($56 for 375 tokens) and served us a few cocktails (average prices, though my rum and coke was teeny).   \n\nAnd we are off to play some games.  About every third game we tried was broken in some way.  Either the token swipe didn't work or the game itself was messed up.   It also wasn't the cleanest place I've ever seen.  They have tables around the place to set your drinks on, but most of them didn't look as though they'd been wiped from the day before (which of course makes we wonder when they last cleaned all the games that germy little kids touch all day).\n\nOverall, they appeared completely unprepared for opening (computers booting, employees not ready to work, soda gun at the bar not assembled, etc.) and not well maintained or managed at all.

All that was comped was the iced tea, and we got some free utensils and wetnaps. How generous! We shovelled what we could into our mouths, did NOT leave a tip (thankfully, we didn't have the added gratuity that John had), and sprinted to our movie where we covertly finished our smuggled food.

We never got to the food part because of the level of service that we received.  We got there at about 6:40/6:45 so Happy Hour was wrapping up, but I would say that the bar was not even 3/4 full.  There were also plenty of empty tables.  This should have been our sign to run in the opposite direction.  But we grabbed a table.

The server apologized for the wait on the drinks, but explained it away with \"this happens at the end of happy hour because the bar get swamped\".  That is a sign that you need more staff.  I have never had this happen at any other bar before.  Get more staff.  We ended up passing up on food because we were worried about time, not the fact that we did not get HH pricing.  Even though, in my opinion, they should have honored HH pricing since we were ready to order food at 7:50/7:55.  We ended up going to the Improv and got food there.

You either like it or hate it. This location is pretty standard; it has the expected mash-up of decorations around the walls that try to give the place a laid-back lounge feel and there's nothing outstanding about the menu or what they offer food wise (and like other Friday's, it's not particularly easy to eat here if you're anything other than a meat lover).\n\nHonestly I wasn't expecting to eat here any time soon; I had called a few days before eating here while planning a day out with friends and asked about reservations for a large group (as it says on the T.G.I. Friday's website that it's ideal to call ahead when you have a large party). However, I was told on the phone that this location does not accept reservations. So my friends and I looked elsewhere, and finally walked across the street to Friday's after discovering just how darn long the waits at other restaurants were. At least Friday's only had a 15 minute wait.\n\nOnce we were seated our meal went by pretty uneventfully. I remember that we had to repeat ourselves a lot to our waitress and I had wondered why she was having trouble hearing us, but at least she was willing to ask questions and clarify things as opposed to taking a potentially wrong order back to the kitchen. Kudos. The food, as I mentioned earlier, was standard T.G.I.Friday's. Nothing particularly wrong with it, just not that exciting either. I had actually found one of the only low-calorie items on the menu at the last minute - a steak and vegetable dish - and standard or not I was honestly pretty happy with it. My steak was surprisingly juicy, came out fairly pink and was not overcooked at all (I'd ordered a medium temperature steak), and the simple and tasty vegetables offered a nice alternative to some of the other excessive dishes I saw on the menu. Not that that mattered after I ordered a rum punch cocktail, which mixed so much rum, fruit juice, sprite and other sugary beverages together that my teeth probably rotted a little bit in my head. It was worth it, though - that drink was a sweet, tall cup of Heaven.\n\nThis T.G.I.Friday's really fits my exact definition of an \"a-ok\" place - it's not terrible, nor is it not exceptional. It's just a decent place to grab a bite or to enjoy a drink.

Just a fine sports bar - no more, no less.\n\nI'll start with the drinks.  They have a good draft selection, and supposedly they've got a nice bottle list too, though I didn't have a look at it, so I can't judge; and the Happy Hour special compliments it well ($1 off all drinks 5PM-7PM).   Plus they have East End drafts at $3/glass all the time, though they were out of Big Hop (the only East End choice they have) when I was there (I don't know if this is a regular occurrence, but if it is, they better do something about it).  The bartenders were friendly and quick to serve, qualities that carried over to the food service as well.\n\nThe menu has a pretty good selection of pub-y and Southwestern-themed foods from which I picked the black bean and corn quesadilla.  Although at the end I was running low on guacamole (which is $1 extra for a small cup) and sour cream, this is a small quibble.  The meal overall  was good, and since I got it with the happy hour special, I can't complain.  One thing I will mention is that there aren't too many vegetarian choices on the menu (I'm not vegetarian, but I try not to eat too much meat, so I notice these things), so if you're a vegetarian, I would try to look up the menu beforehand just to be sure there's something for you.\n\nI know I haven't said much negative about Buffalo Blues in this review, yet I'm still giving it only three stars.  This is the kind of place that makes me appreciate the \"word versions\" of the ratings that Yelp gives us.  \"A-OK,\" which, if you didn't know, is how Yelp describes three-star reviews, is exactly how I would describe Buffalo Blues.  The comparison I keep going to in my head is Die Hard 2.  It's not nearly as good as its predecessor, but it's still something I'm fine with popping in every once in a while when there's nothing better to watch.\n\nTo sum it up - I'm not a big sports guy.  Buffalo Blues, though it is a sports bar, is not the place that would sway me to go to watch a game there with my friends (I'll still say that some kind of playoff game of the Steelers-Ravens I watched at Big Jim's was one of the best sports-watching experiences of my life).  And, judging it as a sports bar, it didn't do anything to justify my giving it anything but \"just fine.\"  But I'm sure I'll go back there for happy hour again sometime.", "business_id": "Ts4xsKPU7FNPPZRj-nRjIg", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-04-03", "type": "review"}

It really is a Pittsburgh staple but come on....\n\nFood is really, really average. I love the ribs and wings, but it's about the same as any other rib place in the city, only they charge an arm and a leg for it. This place is for the people that feel that they are at a real rib place, but don't want to cross Centre or Penn Ave. to get real ribs. It, technically is in Shadyside so your Mercedes will be safe! \n\nThe ambiance: The restaurant is always crowded. Not just crowded, but packed with teens underage drinking, families with too many kids that overflow to your \"space\" and collage kids who also spill over from the bar. IT'S LOUD AS HELL!!! Forget about a nice quiet dinner. There seems to be no consideration for customers at all. Last time I was there, there was a St. Patrick's Day party (it was NOT St. Patrick's Day) that took over the whole place. Though the staff tried (nah, they didn't really try) to keep them in the so called \"party room\" I was bumped into several times, spilled my beer, and couldn't hear my wife speak. But as long as they got their money; they could give a crap. Oh and there are like 100 TVs to interrupt any conversation at your table.\n\nWant to sit in the bar area? Good luck. You will see a mix of drunk people, women who look like high-end prostitutes and college kids who are only missing a beer bong. Also IT'S LOUD AS HELL!!!!!!!!\n\nThe \"wonderful\" Staff: It seems like it's everyone's first day. To put it lightly; the staff suck! To be sure, you will be waiting for your your drinks, food and bill for a very, very long time. Expect to be there for about 2-3 hours. The wait staff are forgetful, inattentive and very sloppy at their job. It pains me to leave any tip for them. Most of the staff are hot, stacked, absolutely stupid and should be working at Hooters not a place where your bill will be upwards of $50 for two people. Be prepared to be met with this saying, \"Oh, like ohmygod, I am so sorry i forgot that, he he!\" (oh she's twisting her finger in her hair while she's talking). You will get bad service...period (in fact, I can't remember the last time a wait person actually wrote down my order, and they're idiots so no worries).\n\nThe food: Kinda good. Menu is huge, you'll find something you like. But I go there about 2-3 times a year for the food. It is way too expensive. Do not take a date there. Your average bill for a meal with actual proteins will run you in the high 40s without booze. There are so many bar-food places that don't claim to be high class that are just as good as this place. I grew up with the rib sauce and love it, but for your average consumer, skip it!\n\nThis place is a wannabe sports bar that tries too hard to be high end.

When I described the qualities I was looking for in my wine choice during beverage inquiry, she just stared blankly and waited for me to decide. The wine list did not include descriptions.

You can bet that I will choose to enjoy this wine elsewhere, like Avenue B (byob), next time. \n\nCasbah is lacking the quality service, honesty and original ambiance that should accompany creative food at moderately high prices.\n\n**Update: I recently saw a full size bottle of the Gruet on a restaurant menu for $30; Casbah, take a tip!", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-03-03", "type": "review"}

I have a gluten allergy and I have missed ravioli quite a bit, so I was happy to eat this. The flavor of the sheep's milk is quite strong and unique, which I like. \nFor entree, I had the double-cut pork chop. This was absolutely great - the flavors and textures of the pork, butternut squash risotto, braised kale, garlic cream, and sage jus went really well together. It was an enormous portion, as well - I took some home and ate it the next day!\nMy boyfriend had the seared rare tuna. He was less thrilled with his dish, and when I tasted it, I agreed. I normally LOVE seared tuna but this was not the best treatment of it. It tasted a little too \"fishy\" and I didn't think the other flavors complimented the tuna. \nInstead of dessert, we sampled two dessert wines recommended to us by the server. I do think that $10 is a little much to charge for such a small glass of wine, but I guess that's what you have to expect when you dine at this level.\nWe are great fans of the Big Burrito restaurants, and I think we preferred our experience at Soba to Casbah.

The semifreddo with a chocolate macaron was good, though not of the same quality as the other courses.\n\nThe cioppino looked and tasted wonderful (I was given a perfectly cooked scallop), but the pork chop that evening was undercooked (who eats medium rare pork???).\n\nI wonder why the wine list is so extravagantly expensive, even by London or New York standards ?!?!?!  The Nietto malbec in the $40 range was voluptuous.  But doe many of the wines are i the $70-$150 range!", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-04-02", "type": "review"}

We started with a Spanish grilled octopus - it was delicious - charred grilled taste, delightful blood orange accompaniment - perfect.  Then had we not had the Habitat beet salad yesterday (it was amazing - check my review) - this would be the best, B U T it was still very good and had Maytag blue cheese, pistachios and nice beets - OK not amazing, but nice beets. Then we had another unfortunate comparison to Habitat.  When we had the pork chop - generous portion but a bit fatty. (Again Habitat's was so much better)  We also had the new pasta dish on the menu which was ok - big scallops (4) but a less than impressive sauce.  Glad we went here - it was different, but not really special and the nightmare of getting a taxi back was just -- well a nightmare (what is wrong with Pittsburgh taxi service -- everything)  City fathers (and Mothers) -- fix this!!!!!", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-04-05", "type": "review"}

And I have to say that I am officially a die-hard Casbah fan.\n\nYes, our dinner group quickly racked up a big bill - but it was for a birthday party, and Casbah had kindly sent along a $30 off dinner coupon beforehand. Even better, they went ahead and applied the discount even though we managed to forget to bring the actual card they had sent ahead to us. We had been completely prepared when asking about this to potentially not be able to use that $30 off at our visit, so their understanding alone would have gone a long way in making the meal a good one.\n\nThe amazing food just sealed the deal. Between a table of four we all had the chance to order and then a variety of Casbah's current menu - including their scallops, arugula salad, duck, pork and veal meatballs, and a ricotta very similar to what I had ordered the last time I visited. Everything was stupendously delicious - I honestly have no other words for how good this food was - and we all left full and satisfied with no complaints.\n\nCasbah has definitely become a restaurant that I can come to for special events. Their food and service impressed me again tonight even more than they did last time; add in the fact that they use local ingredients whenever possible and always have something new to try with the changing seasons, and I'm completely sold.

Casbah is a whopping .2 miles from home (that's at least a thousand feet!) so while its convenience and accepting of reservations reign high on my list of must-haves, the food left me slightly disappointed.  Considering the price point here, we've dropped a star level or so.\n\nI made reservations for brunch (definitely do this; the place was full when we arrived at noon) and strolled through the patio(?) area to the actual(?) restaurant.  That set up is strange itself; especially with no indication of where I'm headed.  We were quickly seated in close quarters with our other lovely brunch eating brethren.  Service was fine.  We're easy guests, and our waiter was more than tolerant with the +1 having not scoured the menu to make sure he would like something there like I had.  We both opted to go with the prix fixe; with most items hitting the halfway point, 28 bucks seemed great for including an appetizer and cocktail.\n\nMy bellini was done right.  Fancy style, making all the schnapps (ha! sorry).  The appetizer of granola with a lil' yogurt that seemed more like cream cheese fatty goodness than the very vanilla yoplait lite I typically let myself have; a sprinkling of berries hit the spot.  Sweet enough for me--maple-y and rich--and didn't even for a second seem like someone poured some Nature Valley in a bowl.  The +1 ordered the cinnamon killed polenta and couldn't get enough.. so I barely got any.\n\nOur entrees though are a different story.  +1 got the mushroom and goat omelet with his little roasted potatoes and his little sausage and his little toast and was all happy enough with it. I am not so easy, I guess.  The brioche French toast sounded great.  Caramelized pear! Sold!  I received, next to a large, meaty chicken sausage link, a few small pieces of fruit and one slice of French toast.  How is that a thing?  Maybe this is the husky child in me, but I was not expecting one slice.  Luckily with the prix fixe, there was no way I would have been able to eat more than one, but really.  If I had only ordered that at some double-digit menu price, I would not be a happy camper.\n\nOverall, really, it was fine.  The food was actually better than I make it sound; it just didn't hit the expectations everyone had set for me.  The hungry girl me will always require more than one slice of sugar bread.  Curiosity of dinner with reservations might bring me back if I don't want to make the trek elsewhere with February arctic conditions again, maybe.", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-03-02", "type": "review"}

They didn't treat us like second rate citizens even though we were in casual clothes and I was carrying my backpack (typical student outfit).\n\nWe had the tuna tartare, which was lovely. Then, we tried the duck with gnocchi and spinach which was also delicious and a great blend of flavors. For dessert, we had the Chocolate Cheese Cake Bombe, which was just ok. It looked pretty, but the flavors weren't anything special. Oh, they also had really nice house made bread that came to our table warm, crusty and crunchy outside and soft inside.\n\nOverall, Casbah was a good experience, but I'm not drooling as I think back to the meal.

Because I had a phenomenal brunch here, and it totally restored my faith in not only Casbah, but Big Burrito. I can't lie, I love what the Big Burrito group does. I think all their restaurants are awesome, but Casbah was always my least favorite. Now, I feel it is on par with the others!\n\nI love a good prix fixe brunch, and for $28 you receive a cocktail, appetizer and entree. So I started off with a mimosa (always a good start!). Then I ordered the Tomato & Basil Bisque and parmesan crostini, which was excellent. I'm very judgmental of tomato bisque, as it is one of my favorite soups. \n\nThen came the main course. Braised Lamb & Eggs: braised Elysian Fields Farm lamb shoulder, spinach, poached local eggs, tarragon, grilled sourdough. I love lamb so hard. It's by far my favorite meat, but it has to be cooked with care. This definitely had flavor, was tender and paired perfectly with the spinach and eggs. \n\nI couldn't finish my meal, so they boxed it up. I separated the sourdough and the rest of the dish so the bread wouldn't get soggy, and our server gave it to me without the sourdough. I mentioned I did that on purpose and he immediately went back into the kitchen and got me fresh bread.

The place looks really Greekish and I like the fake candle on the table :) Our waitress is really nice and friendly and seems to have a brightening personality, which is enjoyable. We ordered a bottle Project Paso and it goes perfectly well w the entree. For apps, we had sheep's milk gnudi. It is super tasty and I like the lobster and the lemon sauce together. We had the famous pork chop and the Long Island duck for entree. Both are really good. The duck has the fatty juicy leg separated from the thin nice part, which is really thoughtful and help boost the flavor. The pork is not bad either. But the texture of the meat is a little too dry for my liking. If not for the sauce and the braised kale, the dish would be disappointing. Then came out desserts: the vanilla bean creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and the chocolate de creme. Omg I can't even find a word to describe how good they are! The creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e is so much better than the one I had in Joseph Temberllini. I am totally blown away by the rich taste of vanilla and eggs. The chocolate de creme is perfect, too. The texture is between ice creme and fudge, really nice and smooth. My friend said that she could have another two of this.

The cheese were interesting, but for the cost I expected more than just a few small slices of bread, a few slices of cheese, and a dollop of jam. \n\nMain dish: Long Island duck - TOO SALTY. I thought the duck itself was cooked well, but as I was eating it I had to constantly drink water to make up for the taste. There were a few measly pieces of gnocchi. There was no lavender flavor or kumquats. I would recommend getting something other than this dish if you do go. \n\nDrinks: We ordered a bottle of Riesling, which was good but nothing special. \n\nCost: The main dishes were all around $30-35.

Its a great beef stew with spaetzle and you can get potato pancakes on the side.  The potato pancakes are, without a doubt, the best in Pittsburgh!!\n\nWhile the food is fantastic, the staff and customer service is what keeps this place from being really excellent.  Its a very \"come as you are\" sort of place and rightfully so as it's a tavern/restaurant but the staff may take the casual nature of the restaurant a little too seriously.\n\nOne evening about a year ago, I went in for dinner.  I originally thought to sit at a wooden booth in the bar and there was only 1 open, the last towards the back.  I sat down and the seat completely collapsed on me!  I'm far from what you'd call \"fat\" \"heavy set\" or even a \"big girl\" and the staff just sort of stared at me as though it were my fault that their booth just fell apart, the bartender even laughed at me while I tried to get up.  No one asked if I was ok, no one asked if I needed help and I was generally ignored as I tried to pull myself to my feet.\n\n*I* had to approach the hostess, tell her that the booth had just collapsed and ask to be reseated.  She rolled her eyes at me and told me the dining room was full so I'd have to wait.  \n\nOk, understandable... could you offer a drink or a manager or something while I waited considering the fact that your booth just broke apart?\n\nThe entire incident was either completely ignored by staff, like it never happened or I was looked at like it was my fault.  I didn't even get so much as an apology!\n\nI've been back a couple of times since then because the food is always good but I always sit in the dining room now which is sort of a shame because I actually like the bar atmosphere better.  \n\nLuckily for me though, their menu is online and they offer take out.  Unfortunately, they have the hostess answering those phone calls and since she's not a server, she doesn't have a lot of knowledge about the menu.  When I asked for a total, I was put on hold for a couple of minutes.  She finally came back and I asked how long and was put on hold again so she could go ask the kitchen.  She was quite rude about it, like I was bothering her.\n\nBottom line: Max's *is* the best place for German food in Pittsburgh, hands down.  But, the food is the only thing you're going for.  The staff could use some help on customer service.", "business_id": "IxQ1ATP_Wg_QujO9nywzcQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-04-06", "type": "review"}

I don't get out to this neck of the woods that often so it was a treat for me! All appetizers are  $2.99 during happy hour so we went with the Potato pockets which were perogies in my book. They were crispy and creamy, and topped with fried onions. They also had a side of french onion sour cream. Pretty tasty stuff! Plus they gave you so many I could have filled up just on the app. I ordered the Bell's Oberon while my dining partner ordered the sampler. I have to say that she wasn't that impressed with the brew. \"Dirty pipes\" and I quote. I had the same taste from my order so I focused on the food.\n\nWe both ended up ordering Max's Goulash that was suggested by another Yelper! You can't go wrong when you have that recommendation. This is not our small town neighborhood goulash made from egg noodles and a mix with ground beef. The noodles in this feast were homemade and chunky, piled high with a peppery meaty sauce infused with fall off the fork beef, carrots, peas, and tiny pearl onions.

I really want to like this place. It's a cool building with neat old fashion feel to it. But the food is mediocre at best.The last time I was there I got what they called German goulash. I have had this made for me by real German cooks so I have a good idea what it's supposed to taste like and this isn't it. It was made from pork instead of beef with frozen peas and carrots. The gravy wasn't a rich and savory, it was canned or packaged with I don't even know what spices in it. When I complained to the waitress she said that most people don't like it either. She asked me if I wanted something else but I was in a hurry and ate the meat after I scraped the gravy off of it. I have been to this place 1 or 2 times a year and I have had undercooked potato pancakes, greasy rubins and cold sausages. The only thing I can say is really good is the spinach salad with warm bacon dressing. It is a bit over priced for the size, but it is always really good.\n\nSunday brunch\nA neighbor talked me into going here for the brunch and I was glad she did. For an all you can eat brunch they do a nice job keeping things stocked and fresh. The omelet chef was very good making stuff just as you asked him for, yum. The sausage is great and the bacon is cooked in a range of doneness that everyone can find.

I LOVE German food. And German beer. \n\nThe bar is awesome. Wish we had more time just to chill and drink. But our waitress was awesome, attentive and knowledgeable! Order a REAL beer. Something on tap from Germany. (If not, I'll give you dirty looks from behind my coffee cup.)\n\nWhat you should order: The Sampler Platter. Pick three amazing entrees, two awesome sides. Brilliant for $16.95... best deal on the menu. And if they have a meatball appetizer you want this. You do. \n\nSo which entrees: \n - Schnitzel. Whichever one you're drooling over. Personally Jager Schnitzel is always best because God blessed the world when he made mushrooms, and man praised God by making mushroom sauce.\n - Leberkase. Wow. This was fantastic. It's like a cross between liverwurst (but NOT made with liver) and a meatloaf. Fantastisch.\n - Weisswurst. It was good. I've had better and yes I know its a German faux pas to have weisswurst at any other time of day than a midmorning snack... however. it was still yummy and I happily moaned with each bite i consumed with mustard.\n\nSo which sides: \n - Spaetzle! Buttery goodness. Never had it or heard of it? Think little dumplings. In butter. Es ist wunderbar.\n - Sauerkraut... they make theirs with sausage. what?! Ja... mmmmm.\n - Potato Pancakes. You order these with applesauce. you hear me? applesauce.\n\nWhat to avoid... that's pretty harsh but they lost a star for a reason:\n - German Potato Salad was too sweet and soupy. My great grandma's recipe puts this to shame.\n - IF you don't like mustard (weirdo) the Sauerbraten has a mustard sauce. I like it, but others don't. You've been warned.\n\nWe walked here from the ballpark... took about 15 minutes.

For me, my fallback, can't miss restaurant is Bado's. First off, the menu is huge- pizza, hoagies, pasta, sandwiches, big burgers, Boarshead hotdogs, and huge apps. Everything I have tried there so far has been above average, except maybe their lasagna which I found to be watery and tasteless. If you get a salad, make sure you try their house dressing. It's their own vinaigrette that comes in a Grolsh bottle and is by far one of the best dressings I've ever had. Make sure you try it on the giant antipasti salad (which you should split with someone), and pair that with one of their calzones (my favorite is the reuben calzone, but the meatball is excellent as well). Their pizza buffet is also good if you want to try a lot of different toppings. \nIf you're looking for a good beer, Bado's has a great selection of craft and microbrews on their huge board, and the choices are always changing.\nYou will also want to come to Bado's on weekend mornings for their breakfast. The omelets are huge and they have tons of toppings to choose from, and the rest of their breakfast choices are above average. Even the coffee is good!\nThe drawbacks to Bado's are that they're almost always busy, and tables are a little cramped. Expect to wait a few minutes when you get there, and don't expect stellar service. The wait staff is good but they're always busy, so you'll probably be waiting for a refill. Also, I like to have fries with my sandwich or burger, and while their fries are pretty good, they don't have them as a side. You have to order off their appetizer menu, and the order is too big for one person and pricey.", "business_id": "qemCNgjeYGcFsRwxW9x4xw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-03-08", "type": "review"}

I don't have any experience with the bartenders, as we always sit at a table and eat.\nThe one drawback for me is how it's a bit \"too\" family friendly for me. I love children (work with them everyday!) but it seems that families here feel comfortable letting their children do whatever they want.

Sandwiches, soups, salads, pizzas and calzones. Some with toppings/fillings you would not expect.

A layer of sausage or ground beef would have done wonders for this lasagna but it stood well on its own just fine.

I stuck to shoveling high calorie food into my gullet instead.\n\nThe last time I was here I selected from the hot dog menu, and they weren't that great. How can you mess up a frank you may be wondering?  I can only guess that it's the dogs themselves or the way they are prepared. They're kinda chewy.

This weekend I had burgers on the brain! My BF and I got the Balboa, the BBQ Texas, and two dogs, mac n' cheese and Mason Dixon with with cheese.\n\nThe burgers had really delish toppings but the meat was so dry. It was overcooked and did not have one bit of juicyness dripping down my hand. Missing that major component they were truly lackluster. The macaroni dog wasn't that great either. Mac n' cheese should be creamy, salty, buttery. So sorry but this weenie came up flat too. I did like the Mason Dixon! The crunchy-ness of the coleslaw made a huge difference but the meat was still chewy and too salty. Could it be that I am too picky when it comes to my meat? If I am shopping for picnic eats I do go for Smith hot dogs WITH the casing or the large sized Hebrew Nationals.

All the dogs were good eats.  You can get your order vienna, veggie, turkey, cheese brat, or on a spicy dog.  The dogs arrive well grilled with a little bit of crisp blackening going on.  There are a shit load of additional toppings you can request (avacado, bacon, various mustards, saurkraut, etc.) and they seemed to be free...at least we didn't get charged anything additional .....Everything was included in the dog prices.\n\nWings were ok.  We did dry wings: jerk, spicy ranch, and parmesean.  They were all decently meaty.  The parmeseans with a side of the spicy mayo were good stuff, distinct flavor and good for dipping.

Also tried the very good Ds Brat (cheesy bratwurst) & fries (same price), and they do a terrific version of the Chicago Dog. There are also 20+ toppings options if you want to DIY. Nice, friendly service from the guys behind the bar/in the kitchen made this a fine time.\n\nNext time I'm in PGH, Ds will be at the top of my list to visit. Can't wait to try their other dogs and whatever they have on tap (or in the Cave).\n\nP.S. There is also sit-down service in a room between the bar and Cave that seemed more family-friendly. I noticed several tables had pizzas and burgers, so I assume those are decent, too.", "business_id": "2X5G4Ujq0s4Wfn4TC7gX0g", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-04-26", "type": "review"}

Given that CM lives right around the corner, and that I had a City Dining Card, D's had been on our list for awhile, and we were eager to check it out. We happened to arrive right when the Kentucky Derby was in full swing, and there wasn't a table to be had, so we gave our name to the hostess to be texted when a table became available (Note: D's uses NoWait).  Fortunately, we arrived right at the end of the derby, so several tables soon cleared out, and we received the text within 10 min., despite an estimated wait of 15 min.\n\nOnce we were seated at one of the high tops next to the mural, we perused the menu to decide what to order.  Because I don't eat beef, I decided to go with the turkey dog ($5.50), style of the month for May (topped with pierogies, onions, and sour cream), as well as a veggie dog ($5.50), Angry Tiki style (topped with bacon, pineapple, hoisin sauce, and spicy cheese sauce).  CM decided to go with the bratwurst dog ($6.50), Mason Dixon style (topped with chili and coleslaw) on a wheat bun (+$.50) and a turkey dog, Big Ben style (topped with fries, cheese wiz, and cole slaw).  In addition to the dogs, we ordered a large order of fries, pub style ($8).\n\nThe fries were brought out first, per our request, so that we could munch on them.  I'm pretty sure they were the largest order of fries I've ever received--they would have solved the Irish potato famine in a jiffy!  They came drenched in cheese wiz and generously sprinkled with real bacon bits (not Bac-Os!), with a sizeable cup of ranch dressing on the side, which we promptly poured on, as well (yeah!).  Despite all the dressings, the fries were pleasantly crispy, due to being of the battered variety.  However, over the course of our meal, they became progressively more soggy, due to the dressings soaking into them.  Between the two of us, we finished about 2/3 of them--not too shabby, esp. for people of our size!\n\nAs for the dogs, to my surprise, I was more of a fan of the Angry Tiki than the pierogi dog of the month.  When it comes to the dogs themselves, I preferred the turkey dog to the veggie dog, which I found bland.  However, the toppings of the Angry Tiki dog were so flavorful that they masked the blandness of the veggie dog, which was only detectable when I bit into it alone.  Although I thought the turkey dog itself was more flavorful, I wasn't impressed as much by the toppings, which consisted of what were no doubt Mrs. T's pierogies and too many grilled onions for my taste (I removed many of them).  CM preferred the turkey dog to the bratwurst dog, and the Big Ben to the Mason Dixon style slightly, but enjoyed both styles.\n\nThe service at D's was friendly and efficient--our orders were placed and fulfilled promptly and with a smile.  During the short time that we waited for our food, CM and I enjoyed examining the mural, which contains many real life and fictitious characters, and the monk decorations on the other wall.  Although we didn't order any beer, we checked out the beer cave before leaving, and were quite impressed with the selection--now CM has a neighborhood go-to spot the next time he needs to bring a six pack to a party!  With the City Dining Card, our total came to $23, which I felt was quite reasonable for the amount and quality of food received. In sum, we were very pleased with our experience at D's, and would definitely return, esp. in light of the proximity to CM's residence and the extensive beer selection.", "business_id": "2X5G4Ujq0s4Wfn4TC7gX0g", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-05-03", "type": "review"}

How nostalgic you are.\n\nWe were the proud owners of a gift card to Applebee's (Christmas gift!) and the best part of this gift was my boyfriend's reaction to me later.  He has never been to an Applebee's.  Or an Olive Garden.  Or a Chili's.  His first time at a Red Lobster was with me when we were stuck in a strip mall hell for the night.  So he's new to these restaurants, which so many of us grew up with.  I'd only been to an Applebee's a handful of times, but I was down to go back - it seems like they sort of have everything, no matter what you're hungry for.\n\nSince we're spending all our time now packing to move back to Chicago (WOOHOO!), we don't always have time to make dinner.  So we busted out the Applebee's gift card and journeyed to Edgewood Towne Center for some chain restaurant foods.  \n\nWhen we arrived, this server really awkwardly asked us to sit at the bar.  I missed the finer points of the interaction, since he was talking to my boyfriend, but he basically insinuated that he'd just sat some large tables, or something, and it was his turn to have a table in his section but he didn't have the time to serve us, or something, and he didn't want us to wait (for what, I'm not sure) so he was basically like \"Can you sit at the bar?\"  Which was weird because there were like, at least a dozen open tables.   But whatevs.  The cool kids sit at the bar, and we are the cool kids.\n\nChuck, the bartender, was running this show.  Dude.  He was on top of everything.  Taking orders, serving drinks, answering phones, getting takeout orders, keeping his bar neat and tidy - he was HOPPING!  We were both in awe just watching him.  That man is earning his tips, for reals.  So I'd recommend sitting at the bar if Chuck is working.  He's also cute, so bonus there.  The Applebee's bar is kind of a hilarious place - random people having drinks as if it's a real bar and not a restaurant, this one lady READING A BOOK WITH A GLASS OF WINE like it was some fancy cafe, some annoying fratty people....and us.  A healthy mix.\n\nI had a Shock Top and my boyfriend had a Sam Adams - mad props for Shock Top on draft, not expecting that from Applebee's.  We ordered spinach and artichoke dip, which I believe was half price (as are all apps) during happy hour.  It was served with regular tortilla chips (like from a bag) but the dip itself was pretty tasty.  It was served in a really wide but shallow crock, and tasted appropriately spinachy and cheesy.  It was served very hot and was pretty satisfying!\n\nMy side salad arrived shortly thereafter, and it was amusingly huge for a side.  Iceberg lettuce, cherry tomatoes, crispy croutons, shredded cheese, tangy bottled Italian dressing on the side.  I bought it to balance out my entree, but somehow these iceberg lettuce salads never really feel healthy, you know? Like eating crispy water.  With cheese and croutons.  YAY HEALTH!\n\nThen came the entrees - I got an order of wings (which I think is technically listed as an appetizer) with \"Sweet and Spicy Sauce\" which was listed as the second-hottest sauce on the menu.  They were pretty decent - served hot, juicy chicken, and the sauce was sweet and sticky.  It was a little *too* sweet for me - picture gloopy Chinese takeout in sweet sticky sauce, and that's what the wing sauce was like - but it still made a satisfying meal.  My boyfriend got one of their \"special burgers\" from their new New Orleans menu -something like a Bourbon Bacon burger.  They asked him \"pink or no pink\" which we thought was funny.  He said \"pink,\" and the burger came out with like, a tiny touch of maybe-pink in the middle.  Medium-rare, this ain't!  He said it was okay.  Not great.  Just a burger.  I didn't taste it, I just nibble on a few of his fries, which were pretty average.\n\nThat all came in at around $30, aided greatly by the happy hour appetizer discount.  I have no interest in going to Applebee's again because I can get better burgers, pasta, chicken, bar food, everything, etc anywhere else, but if I was road tripping and needed a place to stop, this wouldn't be a bad choice.  Sit at the bar and hope Chuck is there, and enjoy pretty average versions of American bar food.", "business_id": "h3la53L9-OX_HlfeAySh0Q", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-03-01", "type": "review"}

You can only put too many sugary alcohols together before you get a tummyache, you might as well be drinking the syrup flavors starbucks puts in your coffee.

Price is lame also 8 bucks and up for a mojito and they use coconut rum in it! Yuck. Sorry my college days of only being able to handle coconut rum are over, it is was frat guys give girls with a roofie.\n\nAnyway moving on my biggest gripe was that there is a cop standing by the door, who looks like he just walked away from beating a non white person to death. I know I know cops have the hardest job and I will be the first to say it, but this guy has a thick energy so nasty it hits you in the face from across the room. The way he was looking at the non white people who were a little to \"loud\" for his tastes, no louder than the booming music mind you. Made my stomach churn. Also they used him to close at 1:15am on a saturday. Thats pretty lame for a downtown bar just because they were not packed.

When I called to reserve some space, they told me they only reserve seating areas for people who pre-purchase food. Which, the pre-purchase options were about $10-12/person. I wasn't about to pre-order food for a casual birthday get together. So, figuring they'd probly be very busy on a Friday night, we got there around 4:30. There were MAYBE 6 people around the bar. No one in the lounge seating area. I sort of felt undervalued as a customer for not being able to reserve space when no one was there. 5:30 came around, the bar got a little busier, but no where near the packed house crowd they painted as a picture for me when I tried making reservations.\nOur waiter was sub par. People sat without drinks for 20+ minutes, and some people just didn't get to order, because one person would order a drink and the waiter dashed off, leaving others to call out after him (to no avail.) He would basicalyl take 1-2 orders, and run off, not to return for 10 minutes. \n\nThis place is average in food price and quality. But the attitude of this place could be better.

In fact, truth be told the place was only about 1/2 full (on Bucs opening day!?).  The food was okay.  I tried these nachos which were good and interesting because it had a decent quality sausage as the meat and not just ground beef.  I also really liked the sweet potato fries.  They were delicious and you usually can't get these at too many places.  I ordered the lobster roll.  It was a ton of lobster, however some of the lobster was a little overcooked and it was ice cold.  I can understand serving cool even though Id prefer warm, but ice cold really wasn't that good when they put warm butter on it.  I also tried the tortilla soup, which was really rich and had a good spicy flavor.  The only thing missing in the tortilla soup was the tortilla chips.  A minor oversight I imagine.  Overall, a pretty decent place when you are looking to just have a few beers with friends.  I've also tried the upstairs bar which is the more upscale section.

As the name suggests, they are known for their martinis.  With about 2 dozen on the menu, it was hard to choose which one to get, but I went with el jardin and then the dark knight.  Both were delicious (and actually my first two martinis).  We all passed around our martinis and each one was better than the last.\n\nFor food, we started with the nachos and calamari.  The nachos were nothing to write home about (pun intended), but the calamari was more than just fried.  It had a sweet glaze on it that tasted almost like maple syrup, but not that sweet.  Really delicious and an interesting take on an appetizer that is usually just fried and served.\n\nFor the entr\u00e9e, I got the delmonico steak.  It was tasty, but not hot when it was served.  In fact, my grandfather got the same thing and he asked them to heat his up and it came back exactly the same.  The server was very polite and made it clear that he told the chef to heat it up, but i don't how on earth a chef can get that feedback and send out the same exact thing.

It was Monday night and the place was maybe half full, so we came in and were immediately seated. The atmosphere was urban-chic and pretty dimly lit. Definitely a nice space for a cocktail bar. Our server was friendly and attentive, if a little slow at times. The special was \"Wine Down Mondays\" (certain wines $5/glass all night) and he tried to argue with me and say it was only during happy hour. I directed him to the advertisement on our table saying otherwise, and he was very kind about the misunderstanding. We wound up going with several glasses of the cabernet on special as well as two appetizers and two martinis to wash it all down with. Everything was delicious. The calamari was a little cloyingly sweet for me (I would have strongly preferred more crunch and spice) but the rare ahi tuna app was savory with an interesting texture and very much to my liking! I was able to use a recently purchased Yelp voucher for $20, which pretty much covered the cost of our food. The server was very accommodating with that, which was appreciated. I hate when restaurants fight tooth and nail to prevent you from using a discount. Overall I can certainly see myself coming back here again.

Thank goodness for cell phones, we were able to change our theater tickets to the following weekend, and had our van driver turn around and get us the hell out of the mess. \n\nBut now that we had the day planned and thwarted by the city that can't think fully, what were we going to do?  We asked the driver to drop us off in Bloomfield, and we would have lunch there...but where?  Tessaro's was OUT (see my review for Tessaro's) and so many things had come and gone since I've been to Bloomfield that we weren't sure what would be there.  Pleasure Bar was out, after redneck hillbillies with guns started bashing 'fags', and Pleasure Bar didn't seem too concerned about it. \n\nAHA!  I've heard so much about it, and never actually went in and tried it...so voila, the plan was hatched...Armand's for a fish sandwich!\n\nI had just thought about a 'fish fry' type sandwich the night before, knowing that St. Raphael's down the street was holding their Lent fish fry...but I have a problem handing money over to a Catholic fundraiser anything, and frankly, their spaghetti dinner for a army officer's fundraiser was a little on the Chef-Boy-Ar-Dee side.\n\nWalking into Armand's was a little bit of a shock.  I did NOT expect it to be an absolute dive bar, and at 1:30 in the afternoon, it was pretty much full of dive bar regulars.  My second surprise was that they also allowed smoking, which I am not for or against, being a smoker, but the air was a deep stale rank dive bar smoke filled atmosphere.  \n\nWe started to sit in the bar area, and then I noticed some Burger King type booths in a back room, and asked the bar tender how we ordered the fish? He directed us to the back room, and said that we'd have to order there.\n\nWe made our way to the back room, and there we found a little ordering window, with a minimal menu.  Fish sandwiches, large and small, shrimp baskets, large and small, burger, a few toppings that were extra (cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles) and a few sides (fries, zucchini planks, cheese sticks, cole slaw, etc.) and that was about it.  Sodas were $1, and came from a machine in the room.\n\nWe ordered one large, and one small fish sandwich, fries, and zucchini planks, and I bought two cans of soda from the machine.  We did have to wait a little while for the food, but we learned why, and it was absolutely fine.  \n\nA woman from the bar came back and asked if the lady in the kitchen had 'forgotten' her fish.  The lady responded \"No, I didn't forget it, I have a bunch of orders, and I have to cut it, bread it, clean the grease, and cook it!  I'll bring it out to you as soon as it's done!\"\n\nThis one woman was doing it ALL, and she was doing it from scratch.  When she got the other woman's fish on a plate and started walking it out, she paused by our table and said that she'd have ours in just a minute.  She then explained the woman asking if she'd forgotten again, and the whole process, and said \"She ain't at McDonald's!  This is the best fish sandwich in town for a reason!  People can be a real F$%king pain in my A$$!\"  \n\nAnd I thought - atta girl - I'm at home!  This is going to be great!\n\nShe brought out our plates.  Ilene's 'small' was rather large, and my large was basically the same 'size' but with a double helping of fish. The fries were decent, and the zucchini really looked like she had taken one medium sized zucchini, rammed it through a slicer lengthwise, battered it, and fried it up. They were HUGE strips, all from the same zucchini.  \n\nThe food was good.  I'm not going to say 'best' fish sandwich. But it was huge, tasty, and the sides were good.  I will say that Frankie's fish sandwich at Cattivo is more complete, and a little more flavorful, but not nearly as big...and it's pretty big.  So so far, Cattivo still wins, but Armand's comes in second.  Both places are bars, and both allow smoking, but Cattivo is bigger and airier (which can dissipate the smoke concentration), and sandwich has a bit more 'flair' to make it tastier.  \n\nPrices at Armand's are average. $8 something for the small and $10 something for the large, but all toppings are ala carte.\n\nDon't dismiss the sandwich though for the dive bar atmosphere.

And he had a CD setup -- seriously, CDs, in 2010. His song list was waaaaaay out of date.

Jason bartends on Friday nights, and he's the best.  He's one of those bartenders that remembers you after your first visit, and remembers what you drink and keeps the refills coming.\n\nTheir food is excellent.  The fish sandwich is church-fish-fry good, and the coleslaw is crispy and mayonnaise-d to perfection.  But the real treat of this place is the fries.  There's something about these fries that I just love.  I think they remind me of the homemade fries my grandpa used to make me in his deep fryer when I was a kid.  They're kind of like a thinner, jucy-er version of Potato Patch fries.  Seriously.  Go get some now.\n\nAnd like other dive bars in Pittsburgh, the prices are cheap.  This is the perfect place to sit around with your fellow Yinzers and watch the Buccos or the Pens (or both, if it's that glorious time of year when both seasons are going - they have multiple TVs).\n\nThe only thing I don't like about Nico's is that it's one of the few smoking-permitted bars left in town (they, like Thunderbird and the Cage, keep the food prices low to skirt that smoking ban loophole).  I've gotten kind of spoiled lately by smoke-free establishments, and I hate coming home stinking like cigarettes.\n\nBut the dives in Pittsburgh are all pretty much maintaining the smoking thing, so I can't complain when comparing.

I am sure that's where my love of Italian food came from.  Even going back farther than that, my parents went there in the 50's all the time. They knew the (owner?) Johnny Collinger and spent many a night having a good time there.  I remember Johnny still worked behind the bar when I went there as a kid in the 70's and he remembered me when I went there with my parents and would always make me a Shirley Temple with extra cherries in it.  (Good customer service is important to kids too! LOL)  So know that you know my family history with the PB, I will tell you that we just recently went back there with my mother who is now 84 on a recent trip back to PA.  The food was still very good but maybe not quite as good as I remember.  Nothing was bad and to be fair, we only split the eggplant parm sandwich and the meatball sub between the table.  The meatball sub was good, but I think the meatballs could have had a bit more flavor.  We also ordered an order of potato balls which used to be the family favorite back in the day. They were still good, but MUCH less cheese in the middle than in the past.  Pleasure Bar - add some more cheese to the potato balls and they will be a standout favorite on your menu and you could be famous for them.  I'd also like to see them bring back a past favorite sandwich called the PB Special. It was nothing more than a hamburger with Italian sauce on it and mozzarella cheese but the combination was outstanding.  I remember ordering that many times as a kid.  I like that fact that the bread is still made fresh (you can tell when you eat it).

Earlier in the day, when it's dead, it has that low-key neighborhood vibe. In fact, it's so low-key that the last time I was in, it essentially became a family restaurant with a few of the tables filling up with groups of little kids and their parents after what I presume was a basketball game. Granted, that forced us to move, as our group of adults didn't want to spend the afternoon attempting to talk over the sounds of a dozen + kids, but I guess with a few video games on the one side of the bar, the TV's, and affordable food, it's not an awful option for the locals to bring their kids during the day.\n\nThe bartenders have always been really nice, and the beer selection is pretty good. With a nice pint and all of the TV's, it's a decent place to catch a game, so there are definitely some positive aspects to The Saloon. Just don't expect much from the food. \n\nNow, yes...I'm fully aware that it's a bar, so the food isn't supposed to be great, but their food is actually bad enough that when I'm hungry The Saloon just isn't a place I consider an option unless we're meeting people there. I've given the food on the menu three chances to impress me, ordering different items each time, and sadly, the only food item that I enjoyed was the complimentary popcorn they brought to our table and/or gave us at the bar...and I'm not a big fan of popcorn.\n\nEven something as simple as the buffalo chicken tenders I ordered last time as a fail-safe hope for a meal - after two previous disappointing experiences - scored below-average. The buffalo sauce was almost gritty, as the seasoning in the sauce was too noticeable. Talk about an awful texture. The fries are okay, but the sweet potato fries were too greasy. Now I'm sure there are people who will stand behind the food at The Saloon, but after my 3 unimpressive meals, I know I'll be hesitant the next time I'm perusing the menu during a visit. Perhaps I'll wise up and just eat at Aladdin's or Little Tokyo next door to The Saloon before heading into the pub next time.", "business_id": "jJfTh2O3M2Q716akd9Dr9w", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-03-12", "type": "review"}

He harassed my dinner partner and myself with a condescending tone regarding a sandwich that we order nearly every visit, which happened to be just last Sunday, in which we had great service (she must have worked at a steak house somewhere and SHOULD be the manager, her name is Erika, thank you Erika... and she was rewarded with a 30% tip.  Prior to the plate landing on the table, the waitress commented on its appearance. \n\nWe both agreed with her, tasted it as per our request to be nice, and sent it back to the kitchen as she recommended it prior to us tasting it.  It came back to the kitchen in the same condition, supposedly \"remade\"... which by that time, my sandwich was cold from waiting, in which I kindly requested it to be reheated if that was possible..  We have also ordered the same sandwich from about a dozen other Pittsburgh restaurants.. we know what it's supposed to look like and taste.\n\nNot to mention, our order was delivered wrong.  My offered sandwich toppings were not on the sandwich.  And my dinner's partner side was completely wrong.\n\nSo I complimented the waitress, I told her that she was great.  She told us that she did not know what was going on in the kitchen and that she was sorry for the third or fourth time... something that the \"Manager\" could learn to use in his vocabulary.\n\nSo after the second sandwich landed on our table, and we decided not to eat it.  My partner and I agreed to simply leave and eat elsewhere.  We were planning to pay for our drinks, and tip the waitress, and simply leave as we did not receive the food that we ordered... \n\nThen the \"Manager\" came out.. a loose cannon that has no business even working in an establishment.  He harassed us, we showed him the sandwich, a smooshed example of their culinary art that \"his guys worked so hard on\".  He did not understand the concept behind keeping customers, \"you can get it right 6/7 times a week, but tonight you got it wrong, and we are not paying for an ill-made sandwich\".  Those were my words.\n\nWe even politely called over the waitress to mediate his attitude that had no firsthand experience in our situation.. as she was readily available for us.  She flipped her story, so the sandwich and kitchen that was off in her opinion was suddenly on their A game tonight.  I guess the three to four prior apologies from her was also none of the \"Manager\"'s concern.   \n\nHe threatened to call the police and told us that he never wanted to see us again.  This was after he personally insulted myself for having a couple of light beers...as I was \"welcomed back to enjoy drinks since I enjoyed them so much.\" I told him that a personal insult was unnecessary and with that, I also advised him to attend a management school and that we will not pay for our meal.  He then harassed us more, asking us what was wrong with my sandwich.. at that point I was done.  I simply told him that we were not paying because of the way he treated us.\n\nThe staff illustrates the faces behind the business.  The Saloon would be great in the right hands, but it's in the wrong hands, run by people that may have over 30 years of ownership, but zero concern for their customers nor any competence in organizing and managing their business.  And that lends itself to a less than mediocre ambiance, low food quality, and inconsistent service... hence the 3 - 3.5 star rating seen around the Internet.  And the 5 stars... they had Erika and no \"Manager\" presence nor drinks from the bar.  Not to mention, the bartender has little competence in mixing drinks, hence the long beer list.  Save some money, fire the manager and the bartender.\n\nAfter walking half a block home, we changed our clothes from our traumatizing, filth of an experience from our lovely, family friendly neighborhood restaurant, and headed to the Walnut Grill, where we sent back the sandwich only once (thanks to a kitchen error on the order), there were only smiles and no threats.  There's a reason why Walnut Grill has several locations, the ambiance is killer, the service is stellar, the drinks are mixed the correct way, and the food is just as edible the next day, because it's that great to take home.  \n\nIF the owners were savvy and recognized that they live in 2015, they would know that this review alone can hurt their business by up to 20% or more.  I hope it does.\n\nA $8.99 Sandwich and incompetent service.. lost a tab + tip which was going to be paid.. weekly patrons.. and has initiated an interview with our dedicated lawyer.", "business_id": "jJfTh2O3M2Q716akd9Dr9w", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-05-10", "type": "review"}

I don't even MEAN to, I just happen to end up here a lot.  I think it's because it's the kind of place that lots of people can agree on - pretty good food and drinks and a KILLER patio.  For me, the patio kicks it up from 4 to 5 stars.  in the winter they don't serve lunch.  In the summer this place is hoppin' all the time and yes, I'm that jerk hogging a giant table waiting for my friends to show up - they're just PARKING.\n\n(speaking of parking - don't park in the lot next door you WILL get towed!)\n\nNone of the other reviews mentioned yet that they recently changed the menu - one of the great new additions is the BBQ pork sandwich.  I love it in slider form - get the coleslaw with it and stick it on the sando.  delish.  I don't even LIKE coleslaw - including on a primanti's bros sando - so you know it's good.\n\nThe mac and cheese (add the andouille sausage!) is a staple and you can get a mini version as a side to an entree for just a little extra.  \n\nAnother new addition is the chicken fried bacon - yes, you read that correctly.  It is a hearty plate of bacon that is battered and fried and comes with white gravy.  I've shared it 3 times with friends and each time it's been a little different but also kind of left me a little queasy although with a happy novelty food feeling.  I would definitely not recommend one person trying to eat this unless they were trying to commit suicide by bacon - which I also don't recommend - and I LOVE bacon.   \n\nOverall I love this place and I don't think the drinks are more expensive than most of the other places on Ellsworth - half price frozen cosmos are definitely worth it.

However it's changed in recent months and I don't think I will return.\n\nOn a recent Thursday night, my friend and I had possibly the worst waitress ever.  Her name was Amanda and this is my story about her as our waitress.\n\nShe was not present for about 15 minutes after we were sat.  She finally appeared and asked us for our drink order. She disappeared for about 10 minutes before returning.  She served us our drinks then immediately left for another table. It was another 5 to 10 minutes before she came by again, this time taking our order for food.\n\nShe return 5 minutes later with another round of drinks which we don't remember ordering, but we weren't going to complain. We never saw her the rest of the night.\n\nOther waitresses were making their rounds every 5 minutes out on the patio, but ours never appeared once.  I thought she may have died in back in the kitchen or was burned beyond recognition.  I even asked one of the other waitresses out of concern for her safety if she was okay.  She said they would check.  She returned not long after and said she was alright.  I relaxed a little, until another 15 minutes went by... it was now about 30 minutes since we had ordered and no food.\n\nWe waited a bit longer, we still hadn't seen Amanda (our waitress for those paying attention).  An hour went by and we had had enough. I really couldn't believe this.  Not only did we not have our food, but we hadn't seen our waitress in an hour.  An hour.

Not that they're not trying to have interesting things on the menu, but it all just ends up not being that great.  The prix fixe brunch is similar.  The menu is pretty hilarious, but the food usually disappoints.  The exception is the wings - which do have great sauces, especially the strawberry chipotle BBQ.

Their menu descriptions change periodically, as if one of their staff members got a degree in comedy writing but hasn't made his/her big break yet.  It's always fun reading the menu for the quirky stories that poke fun at CMU students or current events or what have you.\n\nMenu content aside.  I've never been disappointed with the food.  The fish tacos are definitely an excellent bang for the buck, at under $10 (maybe under $9 but I don't recall exactly) and comes with a side of your choice.  The spinach dip is delicious but just a tad too cheesy for me.  I had one of their pasta dishes a long time ago, loaded with chicken and vegetables, which was one of their pricier items, but it was a large dish so I was able to eat it the next day.\n\nAlso, if you're not driving, please try their dessert drinks.  Or at least read the menu for it.  You'd have to splurge a little, but they're still worth a try.  For those not interested in dessert drinks or mixed drinks, the beer selection is decent here, too.\n\nOverall, I like coming here.

I went for the infamous bacon night this past Tuesday and wow - it sucked. First off, our waitress just wasn't good. She forgot to put our order for a basket of bacon in and we had to ask for it thirty five mins later. Bacon doesn't take that long to cook. Then, we had to ask for ranch with our wings - which we'd already requested, but she'd brought us bleu cheese instead. Oh, AND they were out of bacon wings! On bacon night! WTF. \n\nAnyways, we also had to request sour cream for the pierogies, which is normally brought out with them, plates (b/c we were sharing several appetizers), and ketchup. Why ketchup? Let me tell you. We'd ordered the sliders as well, and it was the saddest display of baby burgers I've ever seen. \n\nThey were brought out on one of the same small plates that we had for sharing our apps - like the size of a saucer that you'd put a tea cup on. And there were only TWO of them. Two! For six bucks I'll go get six non-mini burgers at freaking mcdonalds. And to top it off, they were dry as the sahara and served with NOTHING. \n\nI got the sliders at Harris about six months ago and there were four sliders to an order, and they were served on a fanciful, long plate with a selection of condiments - you know, ketchup, tomato, onion, mustard, etc. Normal things that people put on burgers every day. So, that was really disappointing. But it wasn't over.\n\nThe bacon \"baskets\" arrived. The simple fact that they serve it in a basket seems to imply that there will be a pretty decent amount of bacon in there, right? Nope. There were literally exactly four sad little pieces. The big basket only made 'em look all the sadder. And they'd somehow managed to burn half of each slice black, while the other half was rubbery and undercooked. Yuck. \n\nOverall, I would never go back again if it wasn't for the fact that I have a gift certificate. The only things Harris has going for it right now are its patios, cleverly written menu, and nice location on Ellsworth ave.

We waited 30 minutes for a table; we watched several tables empty out and stay un-bussed and dirty for more than 10minutes at a time.  Obviously they must have been understaffed.  Once seated, service was extremely slow.  Our server was slow to arrive at our table to begin and take our drink order. Our drinks took even longer to arrive (approx. 20 min from when seated.)  The appetizers were tasty, although overpriced. Buffalo chicken dip was very good. Service remained poor.  Perhaps they were just very busy and understaffed. \n\nThe second time I came was midweek, midday, for lunch.  The place was mostly empty.  Surely we would get good, prompt service now?

I understand that - its Sunday - its Brunch - lots of places have a wait.  But again we watched table after table go empty and stay dirty.  Finally seated it again took 20 minutes to get our drinks - orange juice. And then the waitress only brought two of the three beverages.  The third took another 10 minutes.  Seriously??  Our food took an hour. SERIOUSLY OVERPRICED!!  Several items on the menu were out.  (We arrived at noon for a brunch that was supposed to last from 10-2pm).  The menu was prix fixed at $14.  $14 for two pieces of French toast with disgusted, dried out frozen tater tots. (They had run out of home fries).

So I was in need of a lunch and off to the garden. I decided a nice salad would do the trick so I ordered the Salad de la Burgh. While I waited for my meal I was sitting in the little room right off the bar, first thing I notice is the table is a tad sticky, then I noticed the hole in the wall. After these little gems I started to scope out the place, kind of soak in the atmosphere. \"Filth\" the joint is run down and fifthly, make matters worse was the cement block propping open the door to the patio outside ( this is the front door to the restaurant people ). \nThe restaurant was busy and my server was a pleasant enough young woman. I received my beverage and then started to check the staff out and how unkempt most of them where, jeans extremely tight and unflattering on the best figures, Harris Grill shirts were not much better trust. I long for the day when restaurants hired servers because they had mad skills not because they are young or hip. My favorite is when I realize that under the host station there were bus pans ( dirty & full ), one young employ thought nothing of maneuvering it with her foot ( disgusting it is on the floor but also the unsanitary way it was handle )\nLet me now explain the salad I got for eleven dollars and some cents. The lettuce was about a cup spring mix I think, not crisp and wilty, and kind of room temperature. The chicken was cold, so was the few fries they put on it, and a half a hardboiled egg. I think I found a few pieces of onion? Two grape size tomatoes, and two thin slices of cucumber. \"Oh\" there was a sprinkling of mozzarella or provolone cheese on it, could not tell which ( they say both so I will go for that ). This was placed in an average soup bowl. To say I will ever go back to the Harris Grill is a definite not & I will warn others to avoid. \n\"PS\" I did not expect the salad to be huge or grand but decent and somewhat hearty, this was subpar, could have gotten a better one at Wendy's and it would have been warm meat, and fries ...", "business_id": "rgmptwPbBH1wLpiBHcbIhA", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-05-05", "type": "review"}

The grilled vegetables were expertly cooked, crisp tender, smokey sweetness and the salmon was just under done, perfect! The quinoa was tender and an excellent foil for the smoked vegetables.

That's right, every Tuesday is bacon night at the Harris Grill and it's amazing! I mean who doesn't like bacon? And it's even better when it's free bacon!  You don't even have to ask. It's just brought out in baskets and placed in front of you. All the bacon you can eat. What a brilliant concept! A bar wants to sell beer so why not offer something that's salty and chewy and would make you want to drink more?  \n\nOh, and the beer selection isn't all that bad either. I had a Founders Centennial IPA and a Philly Kilty Pleasure. Both paired perfectly with the bacon.\n\nThe service was spot on too... although the place was pretty crowded, I got my first beer within a minute of being there and my second beer within a minute of finishing my first. This was all accomplished while the bartender was keeping a steady stream of bacon baskets flowing from the kitchen to the bar. I was with a group of eight others and when it came time for us to leave, the bartender printed out our checks and, without even asking, every one of our checks were correct. Maybe I shouldn't be surprised at this but I think it's pretty amazing how one person can orchestrate all this, making it look so easy and keeping a pleasant demeanor with a smile on his face. \n\nOn top of a great gimmick, good beer and fantastic service, I'd be remiss if I didn't comment on the atmosphere.

This time, I came with CM and a friend of his for dinner, instead of late night drinks and snacks.  Although we came at prime time (around 7:00pm on a Sat.), unlike my last visit, it wasn't crowded at all, which was probably due to the snowy/cold weather.  This time, instead of being seated at one of the cramped tables next to the staircase, we were seated at a prime corner table upstairs with a great view of Ellsworth Ave.  Between these factors, our visit was off to a good start.\n\nAfter perusing the menu, I decided to go with the pork shank special ($17), and CM ordered the jerk chicken tacos ($12).  Additionally, as promised, I ordered the large mac and cheese again to split, to which we decided to add bacon ($13).  CM's friend went with the turkey burger ($9), which came with fries.  Upon being served, my pork shank entree looked quite impressive, impaled with a knife and surrounded by steamed veggies and some mashed potatoes.  When I tried it, however, it tasted like something from a chain restaurant--meaning that while it wasn't bad, it wasn't particularly special, either.  I didn't try CM's jerk chicken tacos, but he seemed to enjoy them, and I didn't ask his friend what he thought of the turkey burger, so I can't offer an opinion on those items.\n\nAs for the mac and cheese, this version was better than the version I'd had previously.  This time, it had an acceptable amount of cheese (although it would have been improved by even more...), and the bacon added some savory depth to the flavor.  As before, it came sprinkled with bread crumbs underneath the bacon, which gave it some extra crunch (as mentioned previously, I enjoy bread crumbs on my macaroni).  However, some of the noodles were a bit burnt (see photo)--perhaps this was due to toasting the bacon and bread crumbs on top?  Overall, while this was an improvement over the prior version of this dish I had here, it was only okay to good, failing to crack the top echelon of PGH mac and cheeses (score: 7.0/10).\n\nService was about what I'd expect for a place like this--not super attentive, but there when we needed it.  The check for CM and I came to around $50, which seemed steep for the quality of the food received.  Fortunately, I had a City Dining Card, which knocked off $10, but even so, with tip, we still almost cracked the $50 mark.  Taking everything into account, I'd be willing to return for Happy Hour or Bacon Night, but I doubt I'd return for (regular priced) dinner, since the quality:price ratio was lower than I'd like, and there are many other options in the area. 3.5 stars.", "business_id": "rgmptwPbBH1wLpiBHcbIhA", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-03-04", "type": "review"}

They are *almost* as good as actual church basement pierogies. Then I like to wash down my pierogies with an order of their mac and cheese topped with blackened chicken. Their mac is addictive -- creamy, rich, cheesy and topped with crunchy breadcrumbs. I really like the blackened chicken paired with the mac, as the spicy cajun seasoning on the chicken cuts through the fattiness of the cheese sauce quite nicely. Supremely delicious. I will admit that once in a blue moon the mac and cheese will be a bit dry, which is a bummer. So the consistency is not 100% there. But nine times out of ten, I'm graced with a good amount of cheese sauce and I'm a happy camper. And then I pass out in a carb-induced coma.\n\nThe downside here is, of course, their prices. They are pretty expensive. I recently got my standard pierogies-and-mac meal for take out after not having visited for awhile, and I had forgotten just how pricey they are (it was $25 + tip for my meal for take out).  So be prepared to have your wallet cry a little, but the mac and cheese should help cheer it up.", "business_id": "rgmptwPbBH1wLpiBHcbIhA", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-04-01", "type": "review"}

It is situated in a nice neighborhood and is a few minutes walk  from a really cool glass gallery. I had a $25 Groupon and a craving for burgers, so I took my friend and we ate here.\n\nWe went on a Tuesday afternoon, so the attendance was super light. I think they were only serving two other parties when we arrived, so they were super attentive to us. The environment had a really relaxing vibe as well. The menus are funny- there are puns on their food items and pictures of people (staff, regulars, etc) on their covers. \n\nI got the \"I can has bacon cheezburger\" which was pretty much the best thing to eat on a burger craving. The meat was cooked well, and the bacon was a delicious addition. Plus, the burger was really tall, which is a huge plus. Who would want to eat a small burger anyway? Psh. The only thing I was not a fan of was the bun. In my opinion, the bun was dried, but I think that was on purpose. It ended up being a little bland in my opinion. Nevertheless, it provided a well made burger that you rarely find here.\n\nHarris Grill is a fantastic place that gives you a well-proportioned and flavorful meal. I highly recommend going here if you need a burger fix or you need a place to enjoy with your close friends.", "business_id": "rgmptwPbBH1wLpiBHcbIhA", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-04-18", "type": "review"}

Suddenly, they have a bacon night, the interior is hipster chic and the food has been significantly upgraded.\n\nI just recently went there again this past Saturday with my daughter Muff and my sister Luch and we had a pig-out moment. There is no good reason why three people should order entrees and several appetizers for lunch, but we did that.  My sister and I ordered the Salmon BLTs. (She tried to be healthy by ordering a side salad with her sandwich, but I went all the way in by ordering the fries to go with!)  Muff ordered the \"I Can Has Bacon Cheezburger?\" and tatter tots. (Muff could only finish half of burger since we got the appetizers too.) We also ordered the Hush Piggies, which are home-made tatter tots with bacon and cheddar cheese (What's wrong with that?) and Chimichurri Flurry wings.  (Those wings were delightful and delicious!  I usually ask that my wings be fried on the hard side, but they instinctively knew that's the best way to serve them.)\n  \nWe also ordered the Cookies-N-Cream dessert which is a hot chocolate cookie served in a small cast iron pan with a scoop of French vanilla ice cream and hot fudge sauce.  I'm not really a dessert person, but I have to say that that warm chocolate chip cookie with the ice cream was tasty.  Go on Harris Grill, you have stepped up your game! \n\nIt's nice when an older restaurant in a quote, unquote \"chic\" neighborhood decides to do a remix of their space and menu.  That has been the death knell of many established restaurants. (I miss Eddie's Restaurant in the Hill District for a good old-fashioned soul food breakfast.  However, I don't think that they renovated the place since Van Gogh had both ears.)

Really cool experience and it was a beautiful night to sit outside and enjoy the atmosphere.\n\nFirst, Tuesday is bacon night and I'm not quite sure how it works, but I heard it's free bacon at the bar and $1 baskets of bacon if you're sitting at a table.  My friends and I had a drink and some bacon at the bar while we waited for a table (obviously bacon night is a hit and makes the restaurant busy).  I really enjoyed the selection of beers.  I wanted to try the Game of Thrones beer, but liked the amber beer they had too much to switch.\n\nAs an app, we shared the buffalo chicken dip.  It was not the biggest portion, but it's always nice eating grilled pita instead of just tortilla chips every so often.  The dip had very large pieces of chicken and was crusted with blue cheese.  Pretty basic and well executed.\n\nThe menu is pretty simple, but difficult to read.  My friends had been there before so they knew what to look for, but I had a difficult time reading through the commentary and trying to tell what was in each dish.  One of my friends recommended something he had gotten before, so I decided that was easier than wasting my time with the menu.\n\nI got the mac and cheese and added in lobster and bacon.  It was really decadent and better than I expected.  The cheese was very creamy and flow-y.  A lot of times, the cheese on mac and cheese doesn't flow well, but I really liked the consistency of Harris Grill's mac and cheese.  The lobster was also very delicious.  As for the bacon, they just put it on top.  So basically it was lobster mac and cheese with some bacon strips on top.  I was expecting either bacon bits mixed with everything or even bacon strips submerged in the cheese.  Nonetheless, the bacon was very crispy and i dipped a few strips in the cheese which was a solid idea.", "business_id": "rgmptwPbBH1wLpiBHcbIhA", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-04-29", "type": "review"}

It was amazing!\n\nIt was a gorgeous spring morning and I wanted to get out of my house and go somewhere awesome for brunch, with a patio. I tossed around a bunch of places and my boyfriend and I agreed on Harris. I checked in on the \"no wait\" app when leaving my house (a 40 minute wait was estimated), drove the 20 minute drive to Harris and was seated right away! We sat on the patio, of course, which was such gorgeous. \n\nThe brunch at Harris is a buffet- which I had no idea about until arriving. It was only $15 and included your choice of juice, a frozen mimosa or a bloody mary. I went with the frozen mimosa (duh)! It was delicious and had a nice kick of alcohol to it, which I loved ;)! The buffet was pretty impressive! Eggs benedict, chicken tenders and waffles, omelets made to order, bacon, sausage, bagels with all of the fixings, fresh fruit, potatoes and saut\u00e9ed onions with peppers and macaroni and cheese. The mac and cheese was a little dry, but everything else was AWESOME. I loved the chicken and waffles and went back up for seconds after. The sausage was also very good. My boyfriend and I were also in love with the potatoes. \n\nFor $15 a person, we were stuffed and very satisfied.

I looked online for restaurants that were still open and Olive Garden showed they were open \"today from 11:00am-11:00pm.\" So we pulled up to the door and it looked pretty deserted so I went inside to ask what time they closed. It was currently about 9:50pm. I walked in and asked one of the servers at the bar, \"What time do you close?\" She said, \"10:00 but you're more than welcome to come on in.\" I said, \"Oh, it says 11:00 online (I said this while showing her on my phone.)\" She said, \"Nope, we close at 10:00.\" I said ok as I was turning to walk out and she told me to wait while she grabbed the host so he could seat us. I said, \"No, it's ok, I feel bad for sitting this close to closing.\" She chuckled and said, \"Don't feel bad, if I were you, I wouldn't feel bad and I would go ahead and sit.\" I looked at her hesitantly and said, \"Ok.\" \n\nSo I waived to my friend to come inside and I told her what happened. She and I were both a little nervous about getting poor service. (We all know no server wants to have someone seated at their table right at closing.) When the host appeared, I asked him with a nervous laugh, \"Are we going to get bad service since it's so late?\" He said, \"No, absolutely not. You will get great service here no matter what.\" \n\nHe walked us to our table and told us our server would be right with us. She was at the table over dealing with customers who were not happy with their order. we sat down as the salad was delivered to the next table and as the waitress started putting cheese on the salad, the customer said, \"Oh, no we didn't want cheese.\" Exasperated, the waitress rolled her eyes, turned around and threw the cheese grater onto the serving tray and complained to the other server, \"I need another salad.\" So while our waitress went to retrieve a new salad, the other waitress came over to our table. Looking very disheveled and ready to go home, she said, \"What do y'all want to drink?\" We both just ordered water and knowing they were in a hurry to close, we were ready with our order when our waitress finally appeared. \n\nI placed my dinner order and I told her I knew I was going to want desert so I asked if I should go ahead and order that now. She said yes because she would have to check to see if they even had any of the food left, thankfully they did. \n\nThroughout the entire order, we got nothing but attitude. My lasagna fritta was cold and had maybe a spoon full of the pasta sauce. My friend's fettuccine alfredo had may two spoon fulls of alfredo sauce so she had to take some out of the cold alfredo boat I ordered for the bread sticks. While eating, our waitress was walking by and said, \"Oh, I need to go check on your cheesecake and see if we have any.\" She walked back into the kitchen and from where we were sitting we heard her yell, \"Do we got any cheesecake left?\" I guess they did because she came out and said she took it out to thaw. By the time it got to me, it was halfway thawed out and the more I ate and the further back I got into the slice, the more frozen it was. \n\nNeedless to say, we were not very pleased with the service nor the food. And I do understand it was late but if your own staff tells me it's not a big deal, not to feel bad and to go ahead and eat, I expect better service than that.", "business_id": "4WsTFTH8GgnyFHwrH9nHzA", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-04-30", "type": "review"}

I don't have too many chain restaurant reviews, so I figured I'd write one. We went for a surprise birthday party. My friend had made a reservation which they somehow didn't have (maybe she called the wrong one? Anyway, I'm not going to dock for this). The staff was very accommodating, they were able to put a table together for us on short notice. \n\nWhen we sat down, I was immediately hit by a gross smell. I asked my friend \"Do you smell that? It smells like...\" to which he replied \"wet dog!\" which is exactly what I was thinking. It smelled badly like wet dog. How disgusting. Maybe it was the table--can you say dirty rags? While we waited for the rest to arrive, we got breadsticks and were also told that dessert for the birthday would be a charge. Really? Come on now. The bread sticks were pretty underwhelming--there was no garlic or flavor really. Booo. \n\nOnce everyone arrived, we placed orders. I got the Bruschetta Salmon. When I asked the waiter how it was, he said he hadn't tried it in forever but that people say it's decent--I appreciated that honesty! They served salad shortly     My goodness this place was slow though. The food took forever. When it came out, it was pretty lousy. I found two bones in the salmon before I quit eating it. The risotto pasta thing under it was so heavy and the salmon was sort of hard and the toppings made no sense. It felt like two or three dishes in one. Others' food didn't come out, so the manager came out and apologized and comped several meals. He even went up to the birthday boy and told him he'd comp his dessert as well. Thumbs up. \n\nDessert was actually pretty good--I got the chocolate tuxedo mousse cake which was quite good and it seems everyone else enjoyed theirs as well. The only reason this place is getting 2 stars instead of 1 is for service. Our waiter was personable and friendly, and the manager was excellent.

I forgot that the two are no longer affiliated  (Darden sold Red Lobster last year), but I received the card this past Christmas and it still said it could be used at OG, so I planned to use it.  I ordered online and the site said my order would be ready at 7 and to pick it up at the hostess stand; neither were true.  I arrived at the restaurant at 7:00, waited 5 minutes at the hostess stand and then was directed to the bar area that a small \"To Go\" sign that was not at all separated from the bar patrons.  There were several couples in there who said they were doing a bar crawl from Red Lobster to OG to Applebee's to Hooter's.  Wow, only in Charlotte would you find a chain restaurant bar crawl.  One of the patrons tried paying with a Red Lobster gift card and it did not work.  That's when I realized mine would not work either, but I feel it should still be honored since it says it on the card.  \n\nAnyway, after waiting another 20 minutes for my order (almost a total of an hour and half since I ordered it) and listening to screaming children and crying babies, I realized  why I haven't dined at an OG in years (besides the ridiculously long wait times).  \n\nThe food was actually accurate.   The iceberg salads were huge.  It's OG though, so neither were anything spectacular.  It saved me from cooking and doing dishes though.\n\nAgain, there are just too many real Italian restaurants in the area without screaming babies and hour long waits that serve flavorful food at reasonable prices (Portofino's and Docle come to mind) to deal with Olive Garden.  I would go for a to go order IF I had a gift card, but that's about it.  I will never go to OG on my own accord.  If I were going to a corporate chain Italian restaurant, it would be Carabba's.

I never would have known about Al Mike's (as it is known casually) without reading the reviews on Yelp.  Most people said very positive things, so we decided to go here for my birthday dinner.  There were 5 of us, and then 7 on a Saturday night.  Granted the weather was terrible, but we were easily seated at a comfortable table in the middle of the restaurant.  The waitress put up with our indecisiveness with grace and humor, and answered all of our questions very nicely.\n\nOur group started with the Fried Pickles, and even with that many people one order was enough.  Of course, if you know Fried Pickles you know that too much is not a good thing.  These were light and not greasy, even though they came out to us super-hot and fresh out of the fryer.  Their ranch dressing was wonderful, and really complimented the sharp dill taste of the pickles.\n\nOur entrees arrived very quickly, and our table ordered everything from one of the specials, to pasta, to a burrito.  All reports back on entrees were positive.  We had a vegetarian in the group and he was easily acommodated by their menu.\n\nMy Feta Chicken dish was chicken (duh) served over penne pasta with lots of veggies and covered in feta cheese.  The taste of the dish was great, and my only complaints had to do with texture.  The sauce was more of a broth, which is how it was described in the menu, but I guess I was expecting a bit more structure to it.  And, the chicken was tough.  Flavorful, but tough.  The rest of the dish was great.  The feta was lively, and there were some wonderful mushrooms in the sauce that were a treat to discover every few forkfuls.\n\nBecause it was my birthday, I got a free chocolate brownie!  It came out with a little candle in it, which was very sweet.  Our group also ordered the bread pudding.  Between the two desserts, I think the bread pudding might be the superb choice even though I'm a chocolate girl through and through.  It had a complex flavor that was just delightful.  The brownie was good, as really all brownies are.\n\nI prefer wine, and while the wine list is not extensive here I was perfectly happy with the pinot noir on the menu.  If you are a beer drinker, than this place has a ton of options for you!  The rest of my group drank beer, and heartily enjoyed it.\n\nI am so glad to have found Al Mike's, and I strongly recommend that you make the effort to find it in the 4th Ward.  It's easiest to get to off Graham Street - just turn south onto 9th and it's a block or so up the road.

I think I've had every sammich on their menu during one lunch or another, and have never given a single one a thumbs down. London Broil and the Cajun Catfish sammich are the best ones. And after perusing the bar menu, I have had to fight off the urge to order a beer to wash them down with every time as well, due to my presence being required back at work. I enjoy pubs that stock such a wide variety of beers, and this one also includes a rotation of fine ales from another favorite spot of mine, Olde Meck Brewery. I appreciate a bar who keeps it in the QC family! \n\nThis bar is quaint...maybe a little TOO quaint. Being that it is in an old, renovated house, the seating can get cramped at times, especially during peak traffic hours. Service gets bogged down too, both by the level of traffic and unwieldy setup. However, these are nit-picky issues that are easily overlooked when good food and hospitable atmosphere are taken into account. \n\nI hope to come back when I can kick back and imbibe on some good libations!

But sometimes you just want somewhere that's laid back, not crowded and has the feel of local pub.  The interior is all hardwoods, there is an upstairs that I think is held for private parties maybe, or just overflow during the weekends.  They have pool tables and of course plenty of TV's for sporting events, etc.  Plenty of dining area as well surprisingly due to the fact it doesn't seem that large when you first walk in but most of the dining area is tucked away near the back of the place. \n\nOk, I've been here a few times, mostly for social gathering and drinks mainly but last night I actually ordered food.  I had The Black Forest sandwich.  It's a simple sandwich really, but they make it perfection!  I'll have to say, a great sandwich is only as good as the bun or bread it's made of.  This one is angelic...hahaha...ok....yeah it's good though.  They use a Bavarian pretzel roll (nicely warm and soft) as the bun.  The combination of the flavor of the bun combined with the great ham, monterey jack cheese, smoked bacon and honey mustard condiment is sandwich bliss.

Short, rude, curt, and just plain worthless.  Took forever to even get us basic drinks (water, tea, coke, etc).  Then, to top it all off, they were out of curried chicken (since the day before apparently), and were not only out of the Guinness beef stew (a usual staple at any Irish bar), but dropping it from the menu.  Oh, and all the waitress had to say about it?  \"No, we don't have it.  We aren't keeping it on the menu.\"  No offer of a similar meal, no nothing, just nope.

When we walked into this restaurant, it felt like we were walking into a pub in Ireland. Our server told us that the interior was transported from Ireland and restored into its existing condition.\n\nWe started with the Potato Cake appetizer, pan seared potato and cheddar cakes served with savory sour cream and a balsamic reduction. The Potato Cake was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. On the downside, it was loaded with onions and only served lukewarm. Dora here, Good thing we didn't stop there. :)\n\nI ordered the Shepherd's Pie, made with minced lamb, gravy, peas, carrots, and leeks served with a mashed potato crust and a slice of brown bread. The term \"shepherd's pie\" is used when the meat is lamb; the theory being that shepherd is connected to sheep and not cattle. This was an outstanding dish. The lamb and vegetables were perfectly cooked and full of favor with just the right amount of liquid, and the mashed potatoes were creamy with a nice crust. Dora here, I'm always game for Shepherd's Pie, and this was the first I've tasted with lamb. Thankfully, hubby shared with me or I might've resorted to stealing his fork. Soooo good! \n\nMy wife chose the Ri Ra Burger, topped with Ashe County cheddar, country ham, brown sugar onions and a Brioche bun. This burger was tall, juicy, and almost too big for the mouth. The caramelized brown sugar onions were sweet, and the garlic mayo added a unique taste. The \"Chipper \" chips are actually thick cut fries. I snagged a few and enjoyed dipping them in the garlic mayo. Dora here, This was a messy burger, but oh so yummalicious! And I probably drank a gallon of their iced tea.\n\nI would rate this establishment 5 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving outstanding food. If I included the less-than-thrilling appetizer, I'd lower my rating to 4 forks.\n\n~Ernie Hiers, Food blogger at Fiction Faith & Foodies", "business_id": "WuCcv_Dyd_1B_1-4jwK7sQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-03-16", "type": "review"}

And, all were nothing to write home about. The poutine actually came with raw french fries of which we had to send back.

Even though it's a large restaurant, I'd try to make a reservation or at least call ahead if you know you are coming-- sometimes the wait here gets just a little north of uncomfortably long.", "business_id": "ym9QwkmB5ZKTyj7q5huTDw", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-03-18", "type": "review"}

I've been a few times for lunch during the week and twice for dinner. It gets pretty busy at lunch time so try to arrive a little before noon or around 12:45pm in order to beat the lunch crowd rush. I've not had a problem getting a seat for dinner. And I've always had great service. \n\nThe menu is huge (literally) with tons to choose from in terms of beverages and food. The fish tacos are good and the chicken picatta was okay but I found myself scraping off the extra sauce, and the green beans that came with it were overdone and soggy. I did enjoy the french fries. \n\nWhere Rock Bottom falls slightly short is the prices. They're frankly too high for this type of establishment (in my mind it's similar to Applebee's or Outback). And as always, parking is a little tough uptown. Ultimately, if you're looking for somewhere to go and the other uptown restaurants are packed, Rock Bottom is a solid choice.

I ordered the hazelnut crusted chicken primarily because I noticed before we went that a few reviewers here on yelp recommended it. It was reallllllly good! Also HUGE portions that hubs had to help me eat. the chicken itself was really tender and juicy and that crust and sauce are delicious. The cheddar mashed potatoes were good, as you'd expect, and even the vegetables were yummy. We also had the jalapeno spinach dip which was not that great. I mean it was fine, but out of all the spinach dips I've tried in my life, it was not on the top 10. The atmosphere is nice, it's pleasantly decorated and clean, nothing special.

Our service was quick and adequate, although our specific server seemed like she'd rather be anywhere else but work that night.

So disclaimer first, I would prefer a bar with a small dance floor over a large club with seizure inducing strobe lights any day. Yes guys, there are plenty of young girls here. It isn't difficult to find several packs of half-drunk girls to grind on, and if you lack confidence to approach at least the bartenders are gorgeous. This is the perfect place to find someone to take home, and it's so loud you don't have to worry about all the dumb things you say. Truthfully though it's just not my scene. I don't won't to sound pretentious, but this place feels dirty and you will most likely step in vomit or at least spilled beer. As others have said, it's mostly hip-hop, when I was there I rarely heard any house or trance. The crowd definitely trends younger, mostly in their teens or low 20s. I'm 25 and I almost felt too old there. But maybe that says more about me than it does Bar Charlotte. For that reason, I can't give this place less than two stars. Just know what you're getting into, it's your typical teenage get drunk and go nuts kind of club. That could be just what you're looking for.

I just came from there.  I allowed my 15-year-old daughter to go to a \"foam party\" tonight with a high-school friend and her friend.  I did not feel fully comfortable with the idea, so I figured I would go check on them (yes...I am that kind of parent).  So, I walked into the club at around 9:16pm.  Everybody is covered in soap suds.  The club was playing a hip-hop song about licking p*ssy.  And there is my 15-year-old daughter with a complete stranger (who was obviously much older), who was dancing and grinding behind her.  While they were dancing, he was cupping her breasts and running his hands down between her legs.  Her two friends were doing the exact same thing.  So, I walked up and told the guy to take a walk.  I grabbed my daughter by the arm and led her out of there.  Her friends were freaking, afraid that I was going to tell their parents (which I did).  I grabbed my daughter by the arm and led her out of there, and took her home.  (Before we went home, we had to stop at the girl's house to pick up my daughter's belongings.  There, the girl's mother and I had a long conversation.  She was just has upset as I was because she thought that Club300 was safe for kids.  IT IS NOT SAFE FOR KIDS!!)\n\nWhat my daughter and her friends did was wrong, and they should have known better.  However, all of the claims on Club300's Facebook page are totally false.  \n1) The music that they play is TOTALLY inappropriate for 15-year-olds.\n2) I saw no security inside the club what-so-ever.\n3) There were teenagers grinding and feeling each other up all over the place.\n4) If you read the FAQ, it states that NO PARENTS ARE ALLOWED IN THE CLUB AFTER 9:00PM...Gee, I wonder why that is?\nThis is no place for underage teenagers.  Besides, the Facebook page states that the club is for teenagers between the ages of 14-18 years of age.  A person who is 18-YEARS-OLD is an adult and has no business being in a club with underage kids.  On Tuesday of this week, I am going to contact an attorney and see if there is anything we can do about this.  This club is aiding and abetting in the delinquency of minors and should be shut down.", "business_id": "jbUu0Mtu9QUjyyeOn6RIHw", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-05-24", "type": "review"}

The food is insanely delicious and could feed you for days on end! \n\nCapital Grille, hands down, receives my Best Cheesecake in Charlotte award! I usually describe their cheesecake as this: \"It's a NY cheesecake, with a cookie dough-like crust instead of a graham cracker crust, and with a creme-brulee sugar-flambeed topping.\" It's freakin' unbelievable! I would get just that cheesecake to-go on a random night if I ever wanted to! \n\nBut I digress... They also have a nice patio on the sidewalk of Tryon and 5th St. if you fancy people-watching while you enjoy a 4 course meal. They've also just added a lunch bites menu that is for those who need to eat and run at a much smaller price than their usual dinner fare.\n\nCapital Grille is just the place to go if you're looking to impress business clients, for a classy date night or for a special occasion with family or friends.

Not only was the food delicious, but we were treated incredibly well by the staff, particularly our server Rebecca... I truly felt like a VIP!!\n\nOur meal included a complimentary amuse bouche (a cucumber slice filled with a lobster salad), and when our friend informed the staff that he's allergic to shellfish, they immediately produced an alternate dish for him.  \n\nThe salad I split with my fiance was a fresh mozzarella/basil/tomato/balsamic salad.  The server split this tableside for us, and even brought an extra plate with the 12 yr aged balsamic and EVOO drizzle.  Delicious.\n\nFor the entree, I temporarily suspended my usual vegetarian-pescatarian diet for a Filet Oscar (filet with crab served on top).  Medium rare as requested, as was my fiance's delmonico.  Again, delicious.  I should also mention here that the potatoes au gratin side dish were phenomenal and highly recommended.\n\nAt the end of the meal, we were presented with a complimentary champagne toast and four mini \"pot o' creme\" desserts.  These were incredible and somewhat like a ganache.  \n\nWe finished our experience with another bottle of champagne and three desserts to share between the four of us:  chocolate hazelnut cake, cheesecake, and creme brulee.  I have to say that this cheesecake is some of the best I've had and it has to to with the crust and the creme-brulee-like topping.  Definitely a must-try if you order dessert on your visit.

I really enjoy The Capital Grill most times and this experience left a poor taste for the Charlotte location. Our service and the food was, at best, two-star. I know I did not have the steak but typically I can count on this chain to deliver a good meal - if not great (my last visit in Downers Grove, IL in December was fabulous).\n\nWhen we were told we could not get a table for an hour we decided to sit at the bar.  After about 15 minutes the host said he could seat us - we should have been suspicious at this point. We went outside to our table that had trash and leaves around the edges of the patio (hey, wait they didn't just blow there last night).  Our tablecloth had stains and spots on the silverware. \n\nIt took a good 15-20 minutes for our server to come take an order after bread and water were dropped. We asked to start with the fresh mozzarella, tomato, and basil with 12-year aged balsamic. When it arrived it was two neat stacks on one plate and one empty plate. When we asked the server why it was not split his response was \"we can't split this salad.\" Ok - not as if we asked to split an escargot- the salad was almost perfectly portioned for two. Not to bother we just shared. The sliced tomatoes were mealy and flavorless and only one leaf of basil per stack. There was a nice marinated grape tomato as a garnish but I didn't pay for a tasty garnish. \n\nThe main course we tried the grouper special. I've had better. The grouper was ok (notice the theme) but the shrimp that came with the special was overlooked and tough. Our sides - saut\u00e9ed spinach and the wild mushrooms were good. We ordered a 1/2 order of both which is just perfect for two people. My only comment is we pulled eight whole cloves of garlic out of the spinach before eating it. Vampires beware ,,,\n\nOur drinks were never tended too and the front server never bothered to follow up on the salad.

But when you're on corporate account and/or just need to impress your lunch or dinner companions, it is very hard to go wrong here both in the wine and food departments.  And the jacketed dinner service?  Well, I always feel extremely well taken care of here.  \n\nAside from one of the best looking bars in all of uptown, the space is amazing, with a partially open kitchen with adjacent wine room and plenty of dark wood and rich, dense carpet.  It very much has that \"country club\" look and feel to it.  \n\nThat ambiance easily carries over to the menu, which is small but that just belies how big the typical portions are.  The same should be said for the calorie count of most offerings.  Friends, leave the diet at the door and prepare to splurge, it's just about impossible not to.  From the decadent lobster bisque soup to the crunchy, earthy goodness of truffled french fries, you simply can't stay within a reasonable calorie count for a proper meal here.  So just forget it, and enjoy.\n\nStandouts for me include the calamari, served with peppers which are not too hot but add a perfect tang to the rich savoriness of the batter than surrounds the actual rings and other bits of delicious seafood.  This could be a meal unto itself, yet it's just their most popular starter.  \n\nSteaks do reign on the entree menu, and I recommend going with the options which include the large chunks of fresh crab meat on top.  Why not take good to great?  But I am currently obsessing over the seared tuna with tri-dipping sauces and gingered rice.  Maybe it's the wasabi oil alone, with the palette cleansing bite that comes with every taste?  Whatever it is, I call it insane and it's a struggle not to order it again and again.\n\nBut you mustn't stop there, as dessert is just as over the top as everything else in the meal.  Mile-high cheesecake, a decadent chocolate layer cake, creme burulee, and more seasonal offerings.  One is typically plenty to share, or try a few and let the staff box it up for take-home enjoyment afterward.\n\nThe staff really cater to your special birthday and anniversary events, so long as you let them know ahead of time, so do share that at the time of reservation.  During late summer, they also have a wine event called The Generous Pour.  It's a fantastic deal that I highly recommend- wine all night long for a very reasonable beverage surcharge.  \n\nSo, chain or not, this place is great for putting on the swag and showing your guests or yourself a fancy meal out.

It was just meh.  Hence the meh review.  Anyway the problem was the same across the board - dryness.\nWe started with chicken nachos.  Chicken was a bit dry.  Not enough gooey cheesy saucy mess.  I guess likeable for those who really just want chips.  We asked for extra salsa (and were charged I believe 50 cents extra for each tiny tub, woof!) to make it more pleasing.  Most of us got sandwiches, which sounded really good on the menu.  And in fact my philly style chicken sandwich was tasty enough... as long as I bit into a part that had cheese on it.  It was grilled chicken, peppers, carmelized onions and provolone on a bun.  But again, it was just a bit on the dry side, and there wasn't enough cheese on it to mask that.  One of my tablemates asked if she could get a dipped sandwich - the waitress seemed confused, so I guess they don't do that so much down here, but for anyone else who is confused that's dipping the whole sandwich into whatever juicy drippings came off of the meat on the sandwich.  Now that would have been an improvement.  Dipping is a bit much for some folks, but it would help the drought issue with this place.\nBar prices were reasonable I thnk, so maybe come here to wet your whistle but think twice before ordering any food that should be served juicy.", "business_id": "t5l-H2KdY4MQgLDMENz9WQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-04-21", "type": "review"}

The Cutter's Cigar Bar is located in the Marriott Hotel (Downtown Charlotte). \n\nFirst of all let me just say this, don't go to a cigar bar unless you like the smell of cigars, smoke them, or are at least willing to try one. Stay back, otherwise your just going to be a pain in the a$$, sitting around huffin and puffin with a dry sullen look on your face, wondering why everyone is so damn relaxed? I don't hang with these people, but I've seen them and felt sorry for whoever invited them. \n\nAs one chick with bodycon Kim K dress and well coifed weave was with a group of men and protested aloud that cigar smoking was not lady like, and I'm thinking like neither are your hair a$$ legs?! But anyways.... \n\nThe staff is very knowledgeable about the products that they sell. If you are a whiskey Bourbon drinker, these sweet southern \"ladytenders\" know how to knock a grown man off his feet as my boy (a man in his 40's) couldn't even finish his whiskey with bitters, because it was so damn strong.\n\nI had a French Martini that was a little on the hard side, they ran out of Chambord, no biggie, the bartender just added extra pineapple juice. I had more of a lady's cigar per say. The bartender recommended this fabulous Vanilla and Cognac medium sized cigar by C.A.O called Moontrance. C.A.O has an array of vanilla and honey flavored selections that make a unique gift for say a light to medium weight cigar smoker.  The drinks n' smokes complimented each other well, after sitting in a car for 8 hours, that was the perfect way to unwind. \n\nI went back a day later and bought a medium grade cigar for my brother and a chocolate flavored cigar by Acid for myself.", "business_id": "7BVCmaxhvXgEpx7J-SQ4QA", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-03-07", "type": "review"}

My favorite part about this place...no cover charge. God bless the South. Drinks were reasonable, and the people watching was entertaining.

North Carolina's laws on serving alcohol make it nearly impossible to just open a \"club\", so you see a lot of these in Charlotte, especially downtown.  \n\nThe staff is super friendly and doesn't hassle you for walking in and realizing \"Saturday night\" hasn't started yet because the dining patrons still haven't cleared out.  So don't be afraid to check it at 11pm and then come back again at midnight or 1 if it's still slow.  I've never been here to eat but it's a great place to stop in for a late night weekend drink to see what's going on.  People dress nice and behave well.  So you can actually get an expensive drink and not worry about someone elbowing it across the room.  \n\nThere's plenty of seating on both the first and second floors and they have a respectable, if predictable, Scotch selection that helps me keep them in mind when I'm downtown, so I'm sure the rest of the liquor options are pretty good.  Coming from  Illinois where you can buy booze at grocery stores, it's depressing to walk into a bar in Charlotte and only have one or two choices.

To be fair, we knew it was pricey.  So we were happy to give it a go, considering that someone else was picking up the tab!\n\nIn any case, wanting to try something unusual that I can't get anywhere else, I chose the Wild Boar.  Four slices of tenderloin and a small chunk of shoulder, served atop a bed of spinach, which in turn was on top of some sort of risotto (rice-like) mixture, and the whole shebang was highlighted with berries (huckleberries, I think).\n\nThe tenderloin was average.  Good, but a smallish portion, and nothing really special about it.  The shoulder was excellent, and rivaled a tender pot roast.  The risotto was good, as was the berry that highlighted the plate.  The spinach just looked nasty (and I _like_ spinach), so I didn't try it.\n\nBeverage service was excellent.  Rarely did I drink more than a bit from my water glass before it was refilled to the top.  Same with my ginger ale.  Bar service appeared to be pretty speedy as well.  But food service was horrid.  Slow, slow, slow.\n\nSeveral of the people in our party ordered a chocolate cake dessert at the time they ordered dinner - apparently it takes a while to prepare.  Well, our server didn't really seem to notice that other people at the table might want some dessert, and was almost shocked when two of us asked for dessert menus when the cakes started arriving.\n\nAn order of ice cream and another of berries went completely unserved, though we waited twenty minutes or so for them.  I understand if one of the little cakes was ordered, it might take a while to cook.

We dressed for a night out on the town, and despite her dress and my shirt and snazzy dress jeans we still felt slightly under-dressed. Blue has the looks of a fancy smancy place and dishes out food that exceeds expectations.\n\nWe arrived on a Saturday evening at 6 and were blown away the second we walked in the door. The place simply screams \"swanky\" with a sharp, classy interior and interesting dining room layout. The host and servers were extremely formal and proper, which only made us feel like we were somewhere we didn't belong. But enough about the ambiance...on to the food!\n\nAfter taking our drink orders (the wine list is like gigantic!) the waitress brought over some complimentary bread and butter. The bread consisted of a cheese focaccia which was warm and cheesy, and there was also a dark cranberry walnut that was equally tasty. The bread is served with a dish of kalamata olive butter which I'm always a fan of. I can't explain it...I hate olives but I love it when they are infused in butter!\n\nFor an appetizer I ordered the caesar salad with pork belly croutons. The salad is served a la wedge and lightly drizzled with a caesar dressing. Alongside the lettuce was some roasted tomatoes (not a fan of tomaters, but the missus loved them) and carmelized red onion, which went good with the lettuce. But the real kicker was the pork belly croutons. Don't let the name fool you...these are not dried, hard chunks of pork. There was at least six decent sized balls of pork belly on top of the plate. Each one was deep fried to perfection, giving it a hot, crunchy outside yet retaining the juicy, succulent pork belly inside. It was like eating a deep fried ball of the white fatty part of bacon...it was just that damn good. This pork belly is not for everyone, but if you're proud to be a bacon fat kind of person, this little tasting of heaven is something you can't miss.\n\nThe missus ordered the calamari as her appetizer. The calamari was kind of \"meh\", and the batter was way too heavy and just wasn't good. The plate also comes with some fried olives and hot peppers which she devoured in a heart beat. I wouldn't recommend the calamari since I've had better quality stuff at lesser restaurants.\n\nFor dinner I ordered the bison osso buco, and it was nothing short of tastetacular. Six huge hunks of slow-cooked bison meat sat upon a bed of roasted root veggies. The bison was awesome, and I love getting it when it's on a menu. It was also refreshing to see bison as an actual dish and not just a burger. The meat was lean yet still moist from whatever magic the cook worked on it. The bison juices all mingled with the root veggies which consisted of carrots, potatoes and some others. Oh, and I almost forgot the spetzel! There's spetzel mixed in with the veggies and it was crispy yet chewy, and simply perfect. This was one heck of a dish and a great alternative for the steak lover who wants to try something new.\n\nThe missus got the pan seared scallops, and these things were massive! The sea scallops were cooked to perfection and served with a great seasoning and sauce. The dish came with broccolini and other veggies that were SMOKED (awesome!) and a potatoe puree that was pretty darn good. \n\nNow the portions here are huge...you're getting a full meal, not a small fancy tasting. We both ate half our entrees and took the leftovers home for dinner the following night (still tasted awesome reheated!) We weren't fully stuffed yet, but we had to save room for dessert. I ordered the sticky toffee pudding, and if you have a sweet tooth this is the dessert for you. The toffee \"pudding\" is actually baked so it's more cake-like, and its served upon a sea of melty caramel sauce. There are some hard toffee chips sprinkled about to give some texture, and on top of the pudding is a heaping scoop of dulche de leche gelato that was awesome. The toffee, caramel and dulche flavors were all great on their own, but when combined into one mighty spoonful I achieved dessert nirvana. This is one of the best desserts I've had in the area, and there is no way I would go back here and not order it.\n\nThe missus had the baklava for dessert and gobbled it all up. There was pistachio and pear stuffed inside this huge Greek pastry, and it was served with a side of marscapone cheese. Bakalava isn't normally my thing but I won't deny the tastiness of this dessert, though it was definitely second to the sheer power of the toffee pudding.\n\nBlue is a swanky place, and you will pay for the ambiance through your food, which isn't exactly on the cheap side. We would not want to pay full price for a meal here (simply because it's a bit out of our price range) but it would make for a tempting Restaurant Week visit.", "business_id": "eaqJQP6bp7rQJQt5KqfvxQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-04-22", "type": "review"}

Here's why:\n\nService is generally good, so you can count on getting what you need when you want it. It might not always be delivered with a smile, but it will get done promptly.\n\nAmbiance is pretty good. Manages to achieve a flashy, modern-ish look while still remaining understated.\n\nIt's in the food and drink where this place falls short. Neither of these is really anything special; Blue strikes me as \"just another pricey eclectic American restaurant.\" And that's a problem, especially here in Charlotte. Having places like Blue slinging par-for-the-course means that the restaurant scene here in town can't be innovative. I don't mean to be so hard on Blue... but it is a cornerstone of Uptown restaurants, so I think it should shoulder a larger share of the responsibility.\n\nLooking through the menu, it's the same-old, same-old: calamari with olives and sundried tomatoes, scallops wrapped in prosciutto, steaks and seafood, blah blah blah. For dessert, molten chocolate cake. Well, no shit, Charlie. Hey, Blue, the 90's called; they want their fucking dessert back. Also, last I checked you could get the same dessert at any number of sub-par chain restaurants. Sure, Blue does it better, but it's simply not inspiring.\n\nI do applaud Blue for having a seasonal menu, on which there is a Venison Loin and American Red Snapper. They also list gluten free options, which shows that someone is paying attention to both current trends and dietary needs. Nevertheless, the menu as a whole is tired and generally boring. \n\nDrinks were okay, with the wine list being the highlight. The by-the-glass selection was both high quality and comprehensive. Mixed drinks looked promising, but unfortunately did not live up to the quality that the descriptions seemed to indicate. I ordered a Fig Sidecar, which was very poorly mixed, while a friend was not impressed with the New Fashioned.\n\nSometimes, it's cool to have a place that serves classic drinks and entrees, but I don't think Blue fits that bill. I strongly believe that it can greatly improve the Uptown restaurant scene if it pushes the envelope in its food and drink selection.", "business_id": "eaqJQP6bp7rQJQt5KqfvxQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-03-15", "type": "review"}

My first visit to Blue a few years ago was fabulous.  The service was very good!  But, this time not only was the food not impressive, but it was totally boring! The calamari appetizer was good, but not worth $11.00.  The hummus appetizer was 2 golf ball sized clumps with almost no flavor.  Not even arranged to be appealing to the eye.  My tenderloin was nothing to write home about and the risotto was a mushy, tasteless ,  glob with Carmelized onions on it that looked reheated...also not  flavorful.  The baked in house bread were blah, and butter was not offered.  It could have used it to help the taste.  Dessert was the same...an amaretto cheesecake that tasted like it was left in the oven way too long....dry.   I love good food.  But, this evening was an utter disappointment.  It was a birthday celebration, and I did not want to spoil it with complaints about the food.  I also think my guest did not want me to feel bad for bringing them to this place I raved about prior to going. Service was great, but the server talked me out of a couple of things I considered getting.  Made me think whomever was doing the cooking that night...A Saturday was not good at certain things.

There was a high school jazz band raising money for a cancer patient, which included a silent auction. We spoke with the student who had organized the event (a cancer survivor) and were immediately touched by his words and the effort he put into a wonderful event. It makes me extremely happy knowing Blue welcomed the group to put this on. \n\nThe ambience is upscale, sophisticated and cosmopolitan. Dress is formal. It was a very busy night given the jazz fundraiser but luckily we were seated further away from the band.\n\nWe ordered a bottle of wine from the menu, the waiter admitted he didn't know anything about it and sounded confused when we ordered it. A few minutes later we were told that they didn't have it in stock (so why was it on the menu?). He came back out with a different wine that he was offering for a discount and we obliged.\n\nTo be honest with you nothing really jumped off the menu to me. Usually I find myself toying between a few options but there was nothing that really excited me. I settled for the beef tenderloin and fried calamari appetizer.\n\nThe bread (and butter!) was delicious! There were two kinds and I can't remember was in either but they were tremendous. The calamari was so so. The sauce tasted like a ranch aioli out of the jar and was not the lemon-harissa sauce as advertised on the website. Portion was also very small for the price.\n\nThe entrees came out and both myself and another that ordered the beef tenderloin had to send it back. I ordered medium-rare and it was purple, barely cooked in the middle. The best part of the meal was the creamy gorgonzola dolce on top of the cut. The pea risotto that it was served on was unexciting.\n\nOn top of this all one of the raffle items was a bundle of wine valued for about the same as the one bottle that we were presented in place of our original request. A very unprofessional oversight for such a \"sophisticated\" place.\n\nI left wishing that I had ordered the grouper special which received rave reviews from others at the table and I would not come back here without a gift certificate...what a coincidence we left that night with a winning auction for gift certificate to Blue. I guess I'll be returning after all.\n\n Simply put, it is overpriced and not worth your money.", "business_id": "eaqJQP6bp7rQJQt5KqfvxQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-05-15", "type": "review"}

So why I am giving a country bar 4 stars?  Because it's actually a decent place for what it is.  The place is large, has a huge stage and a huge dance floor.  Shortly before I moved to Charlotte, a rave was held here, and man this would have been a perfect place for that due to these reasons.  CJ's reminds me of a place I used to go to in Buffalo called Howdy's, and they also hosted dance music events there.  \n\nI ended up going to CJ's because a friend of a friend was getting married soon, and this was one of the stops on the bachelor's party night.  Even in Coyote Joe's, not everyone is country, nor was all of the music.  We had a diverse mix of transplants and natives, as did most of the groups of women we talked to.  They even played both kinds of music -country AND western :)  Actually there was a live country band, but they also played some rock tunes, such as Red Hot Chili Peppers.  They would play 5 songs or so, and then the DJ would play dance hits like Electric Slide and Cupid Shuffle.  Only about 25% of what I heard was country music this night.\n\nThe main negative of this place is that (as expected), you won't find any local or craft beer. No biggie, I had a 30 minute drive home, so 1 drink was it.

I have great respect for a small business trying to make their way in the world.  PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE POSTING\n\nPositive:\n\nFood:  The food was on par with a decent meal at a regular restaurant.\n\nService:  Initially good\n\nNegative:\n\nPrice: Double the price of a meal of this style and type.  I did use the yelp coupon and only paid what the meal was actually worth.  It was not worth the original 18 dollars charged.\n\nCoupon:  The establishment tried to tell me that the coupon was not good but they would accept it anyways.  This is after I asked when I first got to the restaurant.  Even if the coupon was not being used any more, yelp guarantees it for 1 year.\n\nAtmosphere:  As usual this restaurant is empty, however on a Friday night we were there when they were setting up for an event on Saturday.  Evidently someone rented out the building for the next day.  They were playing really explicit rap videos on the projector while I had a 7 year old and 1 year old at the restaurant with me.  Not the Establishment per say, but the people setting up for the next day. \n\nBathrooms:  Looked like they were under construction of some sort\n\nWaitress:  Our food was served with rice and meat.  We asked if they had any sauces for the rice, the answer was no.  We asked for mayonnaise, the answer this time was that all the people that eat at this restaurant don't ask for things because there is spices (saffron) already in the rice. (as my wife always uses saffron, the amount of saffron was not worth mentioning) I would completely understand this if there were people in the restaurant  eating but it would seem that the one or two customers they get are for the Hookahs.  This means, maybe they should be open to change instead of telling me what the other people who aren't there eat.\n\nExtra charges:  The food came with bread butter and feta cheese.  They asked if we want some more bread and we said yes.  They charged us on the bill an additional 4 dollars without telling us.\n\nKids menu:  None:  They said there is so much food, that kids eat from their parents.  However, if i let my 7 year old do this, I would not have any food for myself.\n\nAir conditioning;  The air was shut off allowing the entire place to be filled with the smoke from the Hookahs.  However, when we were there no one showed up and no one was smoking a hookah until we left.\n\nNote to other people posting reviews:  Please do not post racist comments about restaurants or cultures you do not know or understand.  After seeing the other comments which seemed racist, I did give the restaurant a try.  There are many restaurants in town that serve this kind of food with better reviews, and they are no different than anyone else.\n\nNote to the owner:  If your restaurant improves these items listed, I would be happy to retract my review, but I would recommend lowering prices. People in Charlotte expect more if you are charging them that amount.  Please don't have your waitress tell me what other people eat there when you have no customers.", "business_id": "UFvogJEUiLSJwyx2LSz2uQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-05-02", "type": "review"}

I'm here easily once a week! They have a great selection of beer and the wait staff is WONDERFUL. They're friendly and funny and if they have time, will usually sit down with you for a couple of minutes to talk and laugh. There are one or two waitresses ( the second may have left) who seem to favor certain groups over others and have given pretty lackluster service every time we have been. There's one in particular who seems to favor groups of guys over our group (probably because she thinks they'll tip better) which I think is a huge mistake on her part because I always tip 25-30% or more, even for just average service. When I went a few days ago, we had this waitress. We planned on getting three beers and some food but since she didn't seem interested in getting us drinks until we were out of beer, taking our food orders, or even just checking up on us in general, we sat there for two hours and only got two beers. If I had this experience my first time there, I never would have returned, but thankfully the other waitresses make up for it. They're wonderful company and always give really good recommendations for new beers. \n\nTheir food is delicious. Try the soft pretzels with warm cream cheese-chive dip. Or the spinach artichoke dip. Or the queso. Lauren's Goat Cheese Salad is terrific too, along with the sandwiches. The only food I have an issue with is the hummus. I'm not big on spicy hummus and  theirs has some spice mixed in that I just personally don't like. Someone else might though. Just a personal preference.\n\nAnd I cannot say enough about the beer. I have had a Crem Brulee Stout. I have had a maple bacon beer. I have had beers that most people generally could not fathom. The lowest price on any beer is $3, but it's always worth it. They have a very wide selection and if you're a beer nerd, you should really consider joining their UFO club and becoming a Beer Knurd. After 200 beers, you get a plate on the wall with your name and as crazy of a quote as you can think of. It's really fun to stare at all the plates on the ceiling after a few beers too. \n\nAll in all, despite the tiny issues of the spicy hummus and the waitress that gives biased service, this place is still deserving of the 5 stars. Their trivia night is also always challenging, but very fun :-) Oh and they allow dogs on the patio so we bring ours every once in a while.", "business_id": "F-e-sWfVd3eCYll3BP1QFA", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-04-13", "type": "review"}

It's hard to resist their big soft pretzels, which comes with queso or other dipping sauces. Their pizza is also very good. I haven't tried much of their other food, but my friends say the saucer burger is amazing. They have the UFO club, where you can sign up and try to reach 200 different kinds of beers. (3 per night can be counted toward your total) My roommate signed up and has been working her way through. If you can reach 200, you get a plate with your name on the ceiling/walls. (The establishment is covered in plates, both the name plates and also just decorative plates.)\n\nSome nights it's more crowded than others, but I don't think I've ever had a bad experience. It's a pretty reliable a good time.", "business_id": "F-e-sWfVd3eCYll3BP1QFA", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-04-15", "type": "review"}

You just get the feeling that the people eating there aren't really enjoying themselves.\n\nThe food is really bad.  The riblets that I had during my last visit tasted like they were a few days old and had been microwaved, even the bones were dry and there was an odd freezer burned like taste.  My mother had a steak and after cutting into it and taking a bite, she swore that it had been microwaved.  We both had salads which seemed to be extremely small and were made with ingredients that were close to their expiration date (limp lettuce, slimy tomatoes, and old cheese).  I should also mention that the salads were served warm along with lukewarm dressing.\n\nThe overall service was nothing to really write home about (as the old saying goes).  Given the ratio of waitresses to customers, one would expect the service to be more prompt, but it wasn't.  The food also seemed to take a really long time to come out, about 45 mins for a steak with fries and riblets with fries, it may have actually been closer to an hour.\n\nIf you're in the area and in a bind to find something to eat, I recommend that you either find somewhere else to go or just save your money and hit one of the local grocery stores.

That was pretty lame. We got our food and it was on dollar store plates and very sad looking.  The portions were small and the peppers, mushrooms and onions that were with my tips were overcooked and soggy and the steak was overcooked.  I was bummed. My husband was so confused with his sandwich.  It was a small piece of dry chicken with weird slaw, hot sauce and a HUGE scoop of peanut butter - the ingredients did not go together at all.

I attended the dinner with three friends, one of whom happens to be a professional fisherman from Alaska. He fishes primarily for cod and salmon, and supplies several very well known restaurants with his bounty. His fish is top notch and without compare - truly great stuff. \n\nHe wanted to try Wilson's, as he doesn't supply them with fish and is always looking for opportunities to expand his distribution footprint in and around the area.\n\n+ Huge space. Shockingly huge - rectangular in shape, the building is at least 4-5 times deeper than it is wide. \n+ Bar runs the entire length of the building\n+ Nice selection of taps and bottles available\n+ Was quite surprised to find Abita Strawberry on tap\n\n+ Tons of televisions; our high-top had its own TV\n- Very noisy due to all of the televisions going\n\n- All tables were dirty; staff wasn't too good about wiping down after people left\n- Our server was quite gruff, not terribly helpful, largely absent, and forgot to bring refills of drinks and waters\n\nSo... all of that stuff aside, let's talk about the fish.\n\nTwo options for fish: 3-piece or 5-piece deep-fried cod. No baked cod, and no other fish varietals. \n\n+ The cooking area is in plain view of the entire restaurant\n- You'll leave smelling like a deep fryer\n- We watched as our fries sat and languished on plates for a good 5+ minutes while the fish cooked\n- We watched as our completed plates loitered in the cooking area for another 5+ minutes after the fish was done; our server was busy running around helping other tables while the fish sat...and sat... and sat... \n- Before we were finished eating, our cranky server began clearing a space directly behind us so that they could set-up for karaoke. That's all well and good, but the guy kept bumping stuff into us (the bar stools don't have backs)... he was like a bull in a china shop.\n\n+ Batter on the cod was delicious, if not quite salty. Violet L is a salt fan, and she even commented that it was overly salty\n- The cod itself was dry, slightly chewy, and meh. My fisherman friend said it was \"jerky-like.\" He was, however, quite impressed (as were all of us) by how well the batter clung to the cod. The two components were very well bonded.\n- I thought the batter had a taste similar to KFC's original coating - salty with a bit of pepper. I suspect that those who truly enjoy this fish fry are mostly in love with the batter.\n\nI didn't try the slaw; the roll was your typical cafeteria-style white bread roll.\n\n+ Inexpensive; four of the 3-piece cod dinners with a round of drinks was $34.\n\nI'm not sure why Madison Fish Fry likes this place so much. Perhaps we got a bad round of cod, along with bad service. Fish that sits after being cooked never bodes well... and while I believe in second chances, the overall experience left me quite sour, so it may be difficult to return in a timely manner.", "business_id": "zAsxPh3h9xMQnSDGl41kSg", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-05-05", "type": "review"}

We knew what we were getting ourselves into, going to an Applebee's and whatnot, but what transpired was so ridiculous, I expected Ashton Kutcher (or at least the host of \"How to Catch a Predator\") to pop out and we all LOL about how horrible the experience was.  Instead, I left the restaurant with an empty feeling in my heart, as a wave of sadness washed over me knowing I had just lost two hours of my life inside a low-rate Applebee's.\n\nWe were first greeted by a host who didn't greet us. He showed us to our table, set down the menus, and sidled back over to the host stand without making a sound.  In fact, I can't be positive he wasn't a ghost sentenced to life in purgatory as an Applebee's host. However I forgot to check if his feet were floating or walking, so we'll never be sure.\n\nThe waitress seemed nice enough, but it soon became evident that this woman was about to have a serious breakdown and that we were about to be her therapists, whether we liked it or not (we didn't).\n\nShe came back with our drinks after a bit of a wait saying, \"it's like pulling teeth to get that bartender to make us drinks, we even have to have the manager back there making them too!\".  Very professional.  As she was taking our order, I asked her if she knew whether or not a particular menu item had red dye, as I have an allergy. She was going to check in the kitchen. \"Be right back!\" she said, and we believed her.  Five minutes later, we see her emerge from the kitchen, taking food out to other tables, filling waters, and taking more drink orders to the surly bartender.  She returned to our table in a huff, her response to my red dye inquiry was severely alarming.  \"The chef says there's no way for us to know if it has dye it in or not.  We'd have to go look it up somewhere, so he said you just shouldn't order it.\"  Now I'm not under any sort of delusion that Applebee's is the kind of restaurant where the produce comes in fresh every morning, and the chefs have been trained in the French Alps.  However, I would expect at least *some* transparency, or you know, maybe just go look it up.  \n\nAs we started to order our food (maybe without red dye, who knows?!), the day started to really fall apart.  First of all they were out of mozzarella sticks.  As we all know, mozzarella sticks are among the top 3 reasons to go to Applebee's, along with $2 long islands and 1/2 priced apps after 10 pm.  The waitress tried to explain to us their newly revamped appetizer menu (albeit without mozzarella sticks) but had no clue what she was talking about.  Somehow she walked away after telling us the particular items we ordered could not come out simultaneously, and whatever was ready first was going to come out.  This came down to me getting my entree before my friends' appetizers came, and my friends' entrees coming out about 45 minutes after everyone else had finished their meal.\n\nThroughout the whole meal, and I use \"meal\" loosely because we had nothing to eat for the majority of the time, we could hear the waitstaff going around to every table apologizing for something.  It was complete disarray.  \"Sorry for the wait, we are so busy!\" (as we're surrounded by empty tables), \"There's a 15 minute wait for drinks, because we only have 1 blender!\" (like, what?)  Not to mention they were spilling drinks, precious 15-minute wait drinks, everywhere.  The manager dumped an smoothie on someone's lap, a waiter spilled a drink all over an empty booth (which the mute host then sat a family at before it was cleaned, and a woman sat directly in the puddle), and another waitress was dribbling Bloody Marys across the restaurant at a rate so fast, you'd have thought it was a scene from Dexter. We were being patient, but other tables weren't as gracious.  One man walked up to the bar to get his table's drinks after they sat untouched for 10 minutes.  That guy was cool: he really tore into the manager for being so unorganized and they had to get another waitress.\n\nWe put in an order for another round of drinks, and hunkered down for the extreme wait that was likely to follow.  10 minutes later (we got lucky!) she came back with one too many margaritas.  \"Oh gosh!  You only ordered two of those right? Oh okay... well, this one is on me!\" which was nice enough, except she went on to complain about what a horrible day she was having, and how her whole life was ruined because another waitress made her switch sections.  \n\nBy the time the final entrees surfaced, we had them boxed up immediately to leave.  It took 30 minutes from the time we asked for the check to the time she brought it out, after being there for 2 hours.  The cherry on top was when she took $3 out of her own tips and laid it on the table for the extra margarita. That had to have been one of the most absurd things I'd ever seen.

There was an awesome mix of people there, which is always a good sign for me. They had all sorts of games playing on the multiple tvs (not just basketball, hooray!) and my boyfriend was delighted to note that they have shuffleboard.\n\nWe were seated immediately (pretty good for a Friday night) and placed our drink orders. My boyfriend got a Great Lakes Irish Red something or other, and I ordered a Pyramid Winter Ale, which wasn't all that great. I personally wish that they had some more local stuff on the beer menu, but aside from that, I can't really complain about the selection.\n\nFor dinner, I ordered beer battered cod with carrot soup, and my boyfriend ordered a burger with chili garlic fries. Our food was AMAZING. This is hands down the best fish fry I've had outside of da nortwoods, definitely the best I've had in Madison so far. The soup was interesting but delicious - kind of spicy with a hint of cilantro. I didn't try my boyfriend's burger, but the chili garlic fries were awesome. I'm someone who believes that there is no such thing as too much garlic, though, so they might be a bit much for less of a garlic lover.\n\nI am so stoked to have found a great fish fry place so close to our house.

The fish comes with your choice of  - baked potato, waffle fries, pub fries, homemade potato chips, and some other things like cottage cheese etc.  We had waffle fries, potato chips and the pub fries, which are beer pattered.

Both times I've gone have been for bands, and both times were fairly different experiences.\n\nMy first time was a one-star experience: it was ridiculously hot and humid inside, the staff lacked any sort of motivation for good customer service, and they crammed the 7- or 8-piece band in the front of the bar near the window, making for awkward viewing and playing. The sound was terrible and I spent more time outside than in. \n\nMy second time was a better experience, but still not one that would cause me to suggest other people go there. This time around it was a reasonable temperature in the bar, but that may only be due to the fact that it was in the 50s outside. The bands played in the back of the bar in an alcove/side room deal and it made a lot more sense. The sound was still deafening and subject to random strangers twiddling the knobs on the mixer, but overall not too bad. \n\nFree music is the best thing (only thing?) Mr. Roberts has going for it. Its biggest downsides:\n- it's touted as a blue-collar bar, but it's more an excuse to be shabby and dirty than anything; $15 for a 5-bottle bucket of beer is not a good deal, and $5 for a PBR & a rail shot is a special for a couple hours one night a week when it should be the standard price for such a combination\n- the ladies room is ridiculously tiny and awkward, had a seat that was half hanging off the bowl, and no TP\n- every surface was dirty or sticky, yuck\n\nYou probably won't die if you go to see a friend's band play, but supporting a friend should be the only motivation for setting foot inside.", "business_id": "-4PHmmCt_RmAfaE3sDKW_g", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-05-28", "type": "review"}

I definitely liked the ambiance of this space a lot. A charming neighborhood bar with horizontal narrow wood paneling, lower lighting, tiled floor, tin ceiling, and a very pretty border/trim around the ceiling. Being a small-ish space with lower ceilings and hard floors, it does get a bit noisy when the place fills up so best to beat the rush if you're sensitive to that sort of thing. Also, it's another CASH ONLY spot so be sure to stock up or else they have an ATM on site.\n\nMy co-workers and I headed here for drinks one Friday. The place seemed to have a \"must order food\" policy in order to be seated at the tables so 15 of us frustratingly spent a bit of time crowded at the entrance, downing beers, trying to decide if we should move on. Fortunately, I think the staff finally figured out that two beers basically equals the cost of a sandwich (so what's the difference) and we got a nice row of tables.  Whew!  The place was definitely running a wait by 6:30pm so, again, head out early/late!\n\nThe Mister and I headed here at 6pm on a Saturday and were able to snag the last open table in the place. The beer list is good and reasonably priced ($4).  The menu offers burgers, apps, and sandwiches and sports several vegetarian options. Mr. had the special (Walleye sandwich) which he enjoyed while I had the Seitan Philly ($8.95), also tasty. We started with the cheese curds ($5.95) which were yummy. I'd previously had the kettle chips/dip, which were just that, chips/dip, nothing fancy and the fried pickles which weren't my favorite... \n\nAll in all I really liked the ambiance (but I'd go early so I can hear better) and appreciate the reasonably priced & yummy options for both vegetarians and carnivores.

If you go expecting an upscale \"gastro-pub\" experience of chic bar food, then you will be disappointed. There are no waiters, and you seat yourself. You order food and drinks at the bar, and  a food runner brings out your order when it's ready. Its got a dive bar atmosphere, and the interior is pretty run down. \n\nAfter fighting for a table due to the crowd that was rapidly accumulating in anticipation of that evening's band, my friends and I perused the menu. It contains primarily stereotypical bar food (burgers, fries, onion rings, etc), but there are a few exceptions. There are several vegetarian options, including veggie nachos, so if you're a non meat eater, you would probably find lots of things to order at The Harmony. Most notably, The Harmony offers a walnut burger. I'm told they're famous for it, so I ordered the walnut burger with blue cheese and a side of homemade potato chips with \"Bleu Cheese Dip\". (What can I say, I really, really love Blue Cheese!) It took awhile for the food to come out, so we drank beer while we waited. Our table of about 10 people ordered 3 pitchers to share. I am not sure what all of them were, but in honor of the WI bar experience, I stuck to PBR. It was as good as PBR can be.\n\nOnto the food: The blue cheese walnut burger came topped with a creamy blue cheese sauce in addition to blue cheese crumbles, rather than plain blue cheese crumbles like I had been anticipating. It also came with onion, lettuce, tomato, and mayo. The lettuce and tomato were exceptionally fresh and ripe looking. I was really impressed, especially by the tomato (it was actually red!). I bit into it and was immediately transported to blue cheese heaven. It was fantastic. I will qualify this praise with the statement that the reason I loved this burger so much was largely a result of the copious blue cheese flavor. I am not sure the walnut burger itself was why it tasted so great. The chips were also awesome. They arrived piping hot. Some were crunchy and others were chewier. It was clear that they were made to order. The Bleu Cheese Dip they came with was similar to what came on my burger, and as a result, was amazing. \n\nWe ate as the band played and just reveled in how fun the whole experience was. By the way, the band was great! It was a Rockabilly group called The Fast Clydes. If you like that style of music, I couldn't recommend them more. They had a ton of energy and knew how to work the crowd. I had a blast. \n\nAll this said, there are a few things that I think The Harmony could improve upon. First off, the tables in the main dining area are plastic. They're the exact same tables that you played beer pong on in college. I feel like The Harmony excels in spite of its dive bar atmosphere, and not necessarily because of it. Therefore, if they invested just a little bit of money to spruce up the interior, I think they would see a return. The Atwood area is still rocking that hippie vibe, for sure, but more and more, I am noticing newer and more upscale establishments. To me, that says that there's probably a market for it and the times, they are a changin'. Also, I don't mind ordering food and drinks at the bar. However, I think The Harmony would benefit from offering table service, at least during shows on Friday and Saturday night. I have only ever been to The Harmony with a group, and it sucks to have to walk away from the conversation to get another beer, a process which can take 10 or 15 minutes if it's crowded. All-in-all, these drawbacks are minor, and I'll be back at The Harmony many times this summer!", "business_id": "KHOHjA8HOcTlFBCtMQFv8A", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-05-10", "type": "review"}

Looking like nothing so much as a northwoods WI tavern dropped into near east side Madison, this cozy throwback is a fine place to waste an evening. The drinks are big and strong, the jukebox is better than you'd think, and the clientele is worth the random conversation. Plus the famous shuffleboard table. So, why only three stars? A couple of reasons; first, cramped is a generous way to describe the atmosphere. Second, the beer selection is really not good...unless you're striving for legitimacy with your bottle of Pabst/Schlitz...then, by all means, let your affectations fly. And third, the prices are surprisingly high, which is a problem of perception as much as anything. The \"townie\" atmosphere makes you assume your $20 will last all night with change left over. Not nearly true. The times I've been there, pints were around $4, which isn't bad, but not what you think you'll spend. But, hey, I quibble.

Went here for lunch and my fiance was excited because the burger came with \"Unlimted Fries\".  Put in our orders for two burgers (his with fries, mine fruit--I do like the option of getting fruit with my burger) within minutes of sitting down.  However, it took 20 minutes to get our food.  The place was NOT busy. There were plenty of open tables and plenty of open seats at the bar, where we were seated.  \n\nAbout 5 minutes after getting our food, my fiance let them know that he would like more fries.  We finished eating, and waited for the fries.  And waited for fries. And waited for fries.  20 minutes we sat there and waited. They continually told us \"They'll be up soon\" and \"Your fries are on the way\".  I did make a point to communicate with the waitress that I needed to get back to work, and continually asked how much longer it would be, and eventually asked if we could get them in a to-go box because I was already late to work. However, the waitress seemed more interested in flirting with some of the guys at the bar than our needs.  This is for LUNCH TIME.  Eventually, we just had to leave because it was impossible to wait any longer.  \n\nIf the menu says \"Unlimited fries\", then provide your customer with unlimited fries! It should not be necessary to wait the entire time it takes to get a full order, just to get some more fries.  I know that french fries are not usually made in individual orders. They make a big batch and split them on the plates as necessary. There were at least 3 other plates of fries that came out of the kitchen in the 20 minutes we were waiting.  I also know that it does not take 20 minutes to fry some french fries. \n\nPoint is, if you are going to make a point to put the word \"Unlimited\" on the menu, then bring the customer the item that is unlimited.

Around 7:30 on a Friday night we walk in to the sign that says \"Please Seat Yourself\".  So we walk through the Pool Table area to get to the back dining area, since it was close to the salad bar.  After searching for a highchair for my son, with no help from the waitress filling the salad bar right next to us, we all sit down at a table.  A few moments after sitting down a waitress (Older Woman) came to our table. She took our drink order: two waters with lemon, a Sierra Mist and a chocolate milk, and disappeared.  She reappeared with our drinks a few minutes later.  The waitress takes our orders, Two Cod Fish Frys and a Perch Fish Fry.  We were informed that the salad bar was included with our meal.  Well... From the time we walked into Tully's II to the time we left they were stocking the salad bar, which is not a large spread.  After 10 minutes of watching this woman stock the salad bar at a snails pace and a distasteful look on her face, we had to ask for silverware and plates. Apparently the woman stocking it didn't seem to notice that they were all gone. I'm sure she thought it was nice that nobody was bothering her as she stocked the bar, not ever considering that nobody could eat from it even if they wanted to.  As my wife gets her first plate from the salad bar our meal shows up 20-25 minutes after placing our order.  Really? That long for a fish fry in Wisconsin?  Then came disappearing act two from our waitress!! The food consists of Heavily battered, greasy fish and tiny french fries.  No tartar sauce, no ketchup, no butter for the rolls on the table or salad bar.  We had to ask another waitress for some tarter sauce.  Another 20 minutes creeps slowly past as we waited for our waitress to come back to check and see if we may want a few more pieces of fish being the fact that we did order \"All You Can Eat\" fish.  At this point we have watched 3 other waitresses continue to mess around with this Salad Bar, chatting each other up and texting on their cell phones, while other tables are getting as frustrated as we are.  One table had to go to the Salad Bar to get food since nobody bothered to greet them at all. Our waitress later commented that she thought someone else had taken their order. Another table had to get up and walk to the kitchen to ask for their bill... they were lucky enough to have the same disappearing waitress we had.  We did notice that our waitress came out of the kitchen a number of times (7 to be exact) to bring things to the two tables closest to the kitchen. But anything past those two ... it's like we didn't even exist. and probably could have walked out without anyone ever noticing. Finally, only after the man asked for his bill, did our waitress reappear to ask if we wanted any more fish.  We mentioned at that time that it would be nice to have some ketchup even though most of our fries had been eaten at that point. We also asked for 3 Pieces of Perch, 4 pieces of baked Cod and a refill of Sierra Mist. Not too difficult to remember.  10 minutes later she comes to our table: 1 piece of Perch, 2 pieces of Cod, 3 pieces of  baked cod and no refill.  10 minutes after that our waitress came back to the table and before she could ask us anything, I immediately asked for our bill.  45 seconds later she returns with my card, the fastest thing this lady had done ALL night.  On our way out, we stopped to talk to a manager, briefly describing the WORST SERVICE we had ever had.  I paid first because I didn't want him to think we were trying to get anything free.  When we pointed out our waitress, he didn't look surprised.  All he had to say was \" I hope you come back and give us  another chance\", not \"is there anything I can do to make it right?\" or \"come back and have a meal on us\"..... nothing.  We walked out utterly disgusted!!  The only reason Tully's II is getting one star is because there is no ZERO star option.  Would not...would not.... would not recommend this place to anyone.. EVER.

Even though you have Zorba's and Niro's Gyros close by I would still go with Geo's if not just for their shear size! You can fill up just on eating off the top of the pile of meat before even making it to the pita bread! \n\n3. Calzones - They have so many different ones to choose from but I would say the Fighting Illini, the Italiano, and the Steak Bomb top the list. Again, these things are massive so be prepared for leftovers! \n\n4. Baked Mostaccioli - Amazing pasta dish with a layer of melted cheese across the top! I would recommend getting it with meat sauce and some sausage or meatballs in there as well. \n\n5. Godfather Sandwich - Don't settle for the regular Italian Beef or you are just shorting yourself for no reason. With the Godfather you get a huge Italian beef with melted cheese on GARLIC bread. So good! \n\nThe only downside with this place is you have to be ready for a wait if you're going around dinner time or after the bars close because it gets packed.

The beer selection outmatches any other bar on the University of Illinois campus and it is a bargain cost-wise compared to the non-campus bars. Food is typically served until 11 p.m. each night, with one of the most popular dishes being the \"Irish Nachos\" - essentially a whole plate of waffle fries decked with nacho toppings that you'll need a friend or two to finish.

Their prices don't make up for it either; who wants to pay $6 for a burger that is worse than McDonald's? \n\nThe bar portion also pretty bad.  It's always hard to get the attention of the bartenders.  Once you do get their attention, you're likely in for some crappy tasting beer.  All the taps here taste a little foul; maybe they just don't know how to clean them?  \n\nThe good side of Legends is that it's almost never crowded, and usually not too loud.  They also have a few projectors they use to show Illini games, so that can be nice.

And why review a Hooters in Champaign when I live in Chicago?  Well once a very long time ago, when I attended the U of I, my roommate and I were eating lunch here on a weekday and in walks Harrison Ford.  Thats right, Han Solo/Indian Jones himself walks in, by himself and treats himself to the delicious Hooters cuisine.  There must of only been about 3 or 4 other patrons where, so it wasn't a big todo or anything.  That is totally random (there is a airport down the road, and Hooters was on of the first restaurants you see when you drive up from it towards town, so he was probably refueling or something).   So +1 star.\n\nSo that aside, as a fried chicken review, I give Hooter's Chicken 4 stars.  The very thing that makes it unique you either love or hate,  Hooter's batters its chicken wings.  Hooters also leaves the \"tips\" on its wings too.  You can ask for them naked, but as its kind of the specailty of their wings I prefer the batter.  The batter does soak up a lot of sauce and oil, so it is by no means healthy.  It does keep ok, but its better reheated if you let it go cold.  Hooters sauces are notoriously non-spicey (and I'm a big wuss when it comes to spice).  \"Hot\" is about medium, \"medium\" is less than what is considered mild at most places, it has no flavor at all besides a buttery oilyness for some color.  Please order at least \"hot\", don't be afraid, its not hot.  The fried buffalo shrimp are pretty good too (but they go too quick).  Grilled cheese was favorite too, but some of these options are not offered as many Hooters are franchised.", "business_id": "JhEA8qHfNmIh8c6OHXnaYA", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-04-08", "type": "review"}

This is a terrible place for anybody looking to enjoy themselves. If having fun is not your thing, check out Fat City.\n\nMy second time here confirmed in spades the general feeling of badness I got the first visit. The first time (~a year ago) was a weekend night and they had a lot of people. All the garbage that comes with a large, half and half campusy crowd was there that time. They had keg service outside in a busted little shed (plastic cups, long lines, beer foam splashing all over, and a full compliment of asshats). \n\nInside, the place doesn't *look* that bad. They have dark wood accents, a selection of booths, tables, and a long bar. They have 2 nice pool tables, a shuffle puck table (you dont have to pay for the machine to keep score ... there's an app for that now), a new golden tee, and a couple of other games that looked playable. \n\nThe second time I went was a Tuesday night. I realize Tuesday is a polarizing night for bars, but I am solidly in the camp of lovers of bars on the empty side. A group of grad students I run with had called ahead letting the place know we would be coming en masse. Many of this crew refused to come, (I surmise based upon how terrible this bar is). So we had about 80 less people there than we warned them about ahead of time. So the service was great, right? Nope. The worst I've experienced in Champaign-Urbana. \n\nDrinks took literally 20 minutes. One bartender with ADHD had \"a system\" for remembering what everybody had was running around like a chicken with his head cut off. The guy was really trying, but he did not do his job efficiently at all: he would ask you what you wanted, listen to the very first thing you said, then turn away and 'get right on it' before you were done talking. He would then stop preparing your drink order mid-way to take care of somebody else and their extended family. He would then serve up your drink and act like you were the jerk because you wanted two additional drinks. Those three drinks will cost you $9 plus 20-35 minutes of your life. This 'system' led to a half-dozen or more people at any given time stuck in the purgatory between ordering a drink(s), receiving said drink(s) and paying for same.\n\nThe music system sucks. A really muddy sound that makes old standards hardly understandishable, and the bar artificially loud. In the nearly empty bar described above, it was hard to hear even those near to you, and doubly hard to communicate with the bartender. It was easier to hear elsewhere, but they must put the speakers over the bar (so the bartender can't hear complaints?).\n\nThe food sucks. Terrible selection of boring pub grub standards of BBQ'd meat, fried meat, crappy frozen crinkle cut fries. On Tuesday, they have $2.00 margaritas that are TERRIBLE. Bottom-shelf tequila plus too-much bottom shelf margarita mix over ice (no blend option).\n\nOh yeah, there is an old guy sitting at the end of the bar talking loudly to himself. The aforementioned sound quality makes this even creepier, as only occasional strains of his soliloquy find their way through the muddy garbage music they play here (Classic Rawk 2 steps below NOW!). \n\nI really thought about giving this place 2 stars for the following reasons: $4 bottles of good beers, (like Rogue Dead Guy and Bell's Oberon) and a shuffle puck table/new Golden Tee. Pre-Yelping the place in my head I was resigned to give them 2 stars as a recognition of such efforts, even if they were not reflected in positive results.

The menu consists of simple, classic pub food that has been prepared exceptionally well.  They don't offer anything fancy, but they use high-quality ingredients and prepare it competently.  On Fridays, they offer a beer-battered fish sandwich that simply has to be tasted to be believed.  I would walk a mile on my lips for one of their fish sandwiches and would love to see it on the regular menu.  Skip's grilled cheese is another favorite, but don't expect the kids' classic sandwich as this is a grown-up version with three kinds of cheese, tomatoes, and bacon.\n\nThe service is extremely friendly and generally quite competent.  Another reviewer reported some bad experiences with service on the two occasions on which he had visited, but I've had nothing but exemplary and friendly service, and I've been going there regularly for many years (both before they closed and again after they re-opened).  \n\nI will routinely order carry out lunch with a group of friends; and yes, there have been some minor mix-ups on our order.  But we order from a lot of different places for carry-out or delivery, and they have done better than every other restaurant in town in accuracy, and we typically order anywhere from 4-12 entrees.  On those rare occasions when something was messed up, they corrected it immediately, cheerfully, and then didn't charge for the messed up orders.  ALL restaurants have bad days when everything seems to go wrong, and they handle theirs better than most.\n\nThey have a well-stocked bar and an excellent beer list; I don't drink wine all that often any more, so I keep forgetting to check out the wine list.  I don't go to Fat City to drink or hang out, but when I've stayed there to eat, the sound system has been perfectly fine.  Also, the restrooms are clean and well lit.  I've never had to wait for a drink, and when I'm drinking iced tea or soda, my glass has never been allowed to hit empty before I get a free refill.  \n\nI frequently go to Fat City for lunch, often making a separate trip from Mahomet where I live just to eat there.

It's a burger and fries type of place to begin with, but even the soups come out with heavily oiled broth and salads loaded with Oily salad dressing (definitely ask for it on the side so you can spare yourself the grease attack)\n\nMy co-workers love this place so I go every now and then, but of all the different dishes I've ordered, they were all dripping buckets of grease.  Sure it's tasty, and I will always dig some greasy food, but this is really too much... Way too much.  Burgers, fries, salmon burgers, steaks, chicken sandwiches, salad, etc.  it's all pouring oil out the wazoo.  \n\nI got to say the service is exceptional though.  Every time I've went the service was very friendly, quick, and our food always came out fast.  Prices are reasonable too.  As for the atmosphere, I can see some people digging it but it's quite \"unique\" to say the least.  You really would never even be able to guess this was a restaurant looking at it from the outside.  There's a sign on the main road for it, but then you got to walk into the block a little bit and its in a plain colored building, hid away in a little nook.  It only gets more \"interesting\" as you go in and descend into the restaurant.  Yes, it's in a sort of a basement almost.  \n\nI'm not against the place by any means, and the food is OK and the service is great.  It's just far too greasy for me.

It's hands-down the best burger place in town, and I'm surprised it took me this long to find it. The meat had plenty of juiciness and flavor, and the thick, but not overpowering bun soaked up a lot of the sauce. The secret to an enjoyable burger-eating experience? A good meat-to-bun-ratio and a manageable stack. If the stack keeps falling apart, you're not going to have a good time. Farren's makes a remarkably well-balanced burger, and that in itself gets this restaurant 4 stars. But tortilla chips come standard with the burger, instead of fries?

The front part is all open-air now (like at Firehaus), and the decor is about a million times classier than before.  The place was packed when no other bars were, probably because everybody is so excited to see its new makeover!  Also, the whole back downstairs area is a total dance floor now, with glittering disco lights and a stage for girls to strut their skanky stuff!\n\nSeriously, I was impressed. I mean, the clientele looks and acts exactly the same, but the decor is a stunning difference from the old Cly's.  It looks good, although I must shed a tear for the trashy Cly's of my college years....", "business_id": "pA-TU5anRV7T9abf0oTgtA", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-05-25", "type": "review"}

It was sticky and we avoided it a lot of times, but man when we wanted to go, have fun, and dance, it was a wonderful on campus Joe's alternative. Hey, my 19th birthday was wine night.\n\nI finally ventured to New Cly's last Friday, because there was no line and no cover, both of which were prevalent the first few weeks due to popularity.  The decor is great- cleaned up very nicely, looks really classy.  It would be nice if either the tables were a little smaller, or there were a few more.  I was there with a friend and only the huge round table was left, so we sat there and felt very VIP.  Our bartender wasn't the smartest cookie in the jar, but he was very nice and apologetic for his lack of bar knowledge, which in my opinion makes up for a large part of that-- but maybe that was because my cohort and I are both bartenders so could walk him through what we needed.\n\nThe one thing I wish presently that they would change is that they only have (that I saw) the specials posted on the wall in an inconspicuous place (we saw it on the way out), and so we had to ask, which is one of my pet peeves because it slows down turnaround time so much when you have to list everything.  Also... is there draft beer? We didn't see any.  Haven't tried the cafe portion yet, will update my review when I do.  I see spending some time here this summer when I need to get away from my bar, but only the fall will see how it truly fares in palatability.", "business_id": "pA-TU5anRV7T9abf0oTgtA", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-05-26", "type": "review"}

The food was expensive; the food was good.  There was presentation to the entire experience, which is something I've found a little lacking since moving to Champaign.\nI wouldn't want to eat in the bar area on a Saturday night, and if the hostess hadn't been able to move us into the other room we would have had to leave.  My dad can't hear very well and his hearing is better than my lip reading.  The bar area is really nice and I'd love to eat there on a Tuesday, which I have.\nThe good:  The food.  Three people, three different dishes, and everybody liked theirs.  I had the halibut and mom had the rabbit, and if you're going in there soon, I'd recommend either, and even more I'd recommend the vichyssoise with crab and asparagus.  If you're hardline vegetarian (I eat fish) then you'll have problems with the menu, but I believe the waitress at least implied that the chef would make allowances/prepare something else?  Either way you should call ahead and see.  I have no complaints about oversalting like other reviewers, perhaps they listened?  The malbec we drank with dinner was a nice random choice.\nThe bad:  Our waitress was new.  At least I hope she was new.  The service was great but she wasn't as familiar with the menu or wine list as someone working at that caliber of restaurant should be.\nThe manhattans were terrible.  I suspect Bacaro of being yet another restaurant who thinks they should have their own special manhattan, with exotic bitters and cherry juice and... do you think you're going to save me from scurvy or something?  I want bourbon, bitters, and sweet vermouth, and go easy on everything but the bourbon.  This is no time for creativity.\nThe dessert menu is stupid.  Who follows octopus and rabbit with banana bread and ice cream?  Hire a dessert chef.\nI would totally recommend Bacaro if you need \"fancy dinner out.\" Sometimes I do.

I was surprised by how not crowded it was on Saturday before the game. Also, the most vocal fans were the table of Mets fans sitting on the patio (I was wearing my Mets hat), so we cheered with them for a minute before going inside.  When we walked in there were less than a handful of people at the circular bar and maybe three tables were occupied.  For a game day, service was quick and our server was nice.\n\nI think the food at Coach and Willie's is solid bar food with large portions. TI've had the chicken tenders and fries which is good. The tenders have a very light breading which I appreciate. I've also tried the chicken nachos which were OK...at times I would only get chicken and no chips. I've had better chicken nachos at other sports bars.\n\nDuring the week, lunchtime service is a mess. Service is slow. Really slow actually. I don't mind taking longer lunches occasionally, but last time I went with five coworkers and we nearly had a two hour lunch at Coach and Willie's. That is much too slow in my opinion! Plus, seperating checks is a nightmare there, so my advice is if you go with a group, just bring cash.\n\nThere are plenty of TVs and when my husband and I met for lunch there in March, I asked for the TV closest to us to be turned to the Ohio State Big 10 basketball tournament game which they did willingly. I definitely appreciated it.  However, this past Saturday, did every TV need to be on the Kentucky Derby...and it wasn't even the Derby, it was like the \"red carpet\" event hosted by Molly Sims. Blah, I would have much preferred some baseball.\n\nCoach and Willie's is an easy walk to Chase Field and I believe after Dbacks games, they have a reverse happy hour.

Its right around the corner from Chase Field, and neither of us had been here before.  We had an excellent time together at Coach and Willies, but I think we both left with a feeling of something to be desired by this place.  Here's my take on the place:\n\nI dont think this place is bad.  I just think its not the greatest.  Scott and I did enjoy our time here, BUT, I think we both found the same things annoying about it.\n\nFirst, I feel like theres a conflict of decorating.  I feel like theres two completely different themes going on here, and they both clash with one another.  Part of it seems like it wants to be a nicer resturant....the other part wants to be a sports bar.  Neither one compliments each other.  \n\nWhen you walk in, theres a great patio area for dining.  Loved it!  But, then when you walk in, and kind of walk around, it shows signs of trying to be a sports bar.  The bar itself is set really low.  Lower then the tables themselves.  Heavy marble looking bar tops, with chairs.  \n\nAt one point Scott and I counted 15 (YES 15!) flat screen TVs!  I will say, there was one particular TV in our area that I noticed that had amazing reception.  It was probably one of the better flat screens I have seen!  \n\nTo my benefit, I ordered the half nachos.  The server ended up bringing me out a full plate of nachos (bonus!) and I was happy!  Food here is so so.  \n\nI feel like this place is a place I would probably bring my parents to, but it really didnt blow me away.", "business_id": "j8nyAaN_w5t6wYv-ni23sg", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-04-27", "type": "review"}

But it was fun to visit the ballpark and we did have a good time.\n\nWithin walking distance so I didn't have to move my truck this place seemed to have the greatest appeal based on reviews.\n\nMy impression was of a restaurant that happened to have, what looked like a very uncomfortable, low bar and a nice outside patio.  And also a whole bunch of TVs.  The sort of place dad could take the whole family for dinner and position himself to see the game he would rather have stayed home and watched.  But it's in the wrong neighborhood for that.  I only saw one couple on the patio as it was a bit chilly.  There may have been heaters but I didn't notice them.\n\nThe food certainly was not exciting.  I had a filet mignon sandwich ($14.00) and chose fries over the salad on the recommendation of our server.  Fries were soggy and limp.  He must never have tried them.  Amy B had 1/2 order of nachos w/beef ($6.50) and they gave her a full order at the 1/2 order price rather than make her wait for the correct order to be made.  The food was edible but neither of us felt motivated to continue past the no longer hungry point.  And neither of us were encouraging the other to try what we were eating. \n\nWe got started off a bit on the wrong foot as the sign said \"wait to be seated\", which we started to do.  The hostess was also the waitress for the front of the house and told us to grab seats at the bar and I said we wanted a table and stood there as she wandered off to check the IDs of some folks that had just ordered at a table (cute young women should know they are going to get carded and not have their IDs buried at the bottom of a 15lb piece of luggage they call a purse).  The waitress/hostess did finally look up and realize we were not moving and told us to grab a table and someone would find us.  It took roughly 10 minutes for our server to show the first time but after that he was there just as much as needed.  During that time I noticed Fat Tire was on tap so I ordered the 20oz glass ($7.00).  Amy had a diet cola which was refilled twice just as she emptied it.  Considering we arrived with the after game crowd I think we got really good service and I would say at it's peak the restaurant inside was about 2/3 full and dwindling as we were there\n\nOverall it is not a bad place and I would go again if invited but I want to try some other places in the area too on my infrequent trips downtown.", "business_id": "j8nyAaN_w5t6wYv-ni23sg", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-04-29", "type": "review"}

Each time has been a complete disappointment. It is sad because they have great food and I believe this restaurant would do much better if the service was up to par. My past visits were with the company. Excited to have our team building lunch at a downtown restaurant near the office is very convenient for our office. Sadly our office has not been happy with the service the two times we went as a team. This restaurant offers a variety of options to choose from for all types of diners. Salads, Sandwiches, Soups, Pizza and much much more. Though it seems the wait staff brings the place down. \n\n1st securing a table ahead of time has not worked out for us both times because the restaurant did not have our reservation. Though the good news is both times we were able to get seated right away. The bad news is not only did our food take a long time majority of the orders were wrong. 2nd Giving them the benefit of the doubt I went in to place a to go order today. I placed my call order over the phone and was told It would take 15-20 minutes. After having my order repeated back to me and giving the correct spelling of my name I get to the restaurant to pay the tab to only find out my order was not even entered. The bartender tells me that the person who took my order forgot one of the items. I have trouble understanding this when I ordered only two items that were off the basic lunch special menu. To be proactive I paid my order ahead of time to find my name spelled wrong on the receipt. This again surprised me as the person who took the order repeated it back to me. After waiting 17 minutes for my order I find out from the bartender my order was made wrong. This was his fault as he entered it in wrong. He refunded me my money and I left because I could not wait another 15-20minuetes for a to go order. I am hesitant to give them another try at this point. I am not going to even risk catering for the office because part of my job is to order food for the office as the office I work in is a training center that provides food. If they cannot get a simple order right I cannot imagine how a large catering order for fifty people would look like. \n\nI will add there is patio seating, private room, happy hour specials, WiFi and free parking during lunch.", "business_id": "j8nyAaN_w5t6wYv-ni23sg", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-04-26", "type": "review"}

I really have a problem with the dynamics of the TV arrangements, and although they all appear to be plasma (not LCD), someone here lacks the capability or willingness to change a number of their broadcasts to HD until well into 'the game' or never at all.\n\nThe table positioning is awkward at best.  They force you into a 45 degree angle, where, if you have 4-5 people in the group, 3 are forced at painful angles for sustained TV viewing.  And before Dbacks games, this place looks like the Texas polygamist ranch, with all the kids and their daddies in here.  Its too much.\n\nTheir semi-shaded patio and brick-warehouse structure is gorgeous tho.  If you can snag a spot out front, the atmosphere feels pretty enthusiastic and wholly uplifting, truth be told.  Almost like a real sports/entertainment district.\n\nFood is awful, but really who cares?  You're here for the beer and they have that.

Hey Management, here's a few pointers for you:\n\nWhen there are events downtown, people WILL show up.  Stop looking so shocked.  We are actually there because the wait everywhere else is too long, and we were forced to look to you by default.  Restaurant staffing is variable, meaning you are allowed to schedule adequate staff for an event night.\n\nWe rolled in, took a look around, checked out the menu and rolled out.  Then we found out the wait at Cooperstown, which was wall to wall with people, was an hour.  So we rolled back to Jacksons.  The wait for food, when the place was at only 1/3 of their capacity was an hour.  For food.  For bar food.  They have 8 items on the menu, most of which are fried.  Has it ever occurred to their staff to, umm, I unno, PREPARE?  We found an outside seat, and I meandered up to the outside bar.  15 minutes later, I finally got served.  I kept my mouth shut, because I watched one of the bartenders berate a woman for complaining about the wait.  Granted, she was a bitch, but a bitch with a  valid point.  They were only serving the people at the ends of the bar, completely ignoring the 30 or so SITTING in the middle.  \n\n$12 for 2 vodka Red Bulls, a fair price.  After learning about the wait, we decided to forgo food, but there was another 15 minute wait when I went back to the cash only outside bar.  So much for them remembering decent tippers.  \n\nThe seating arrangement outside seems weird, awkward and unbalanced, and it only gets worse when you head inside.  I hear they have \"servers\" but since I only saw one looking harried inside, that could be more of an urban legend than fact.  They could easily add more tables inside and rearrange the outside to seat more people comfortably, but given that they can't handle a preconcert crowd, they shouldn't unless they hire some experienced, friendly staff.\n\nI won't be going back anytime soon.", "business_id": "5XIvwfbIa-vuFEkkeCQ6kQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-03-28", "type": "review"}

The food is never more than your standard sports bar \"ok\".  Some better moments than others.  You know how that goes.  But with us, we aren't going so much for the food - as for the sports.  \n\nLiving in the downtown/South Mountain area, there aren't many sports bars as it is.  Then you narrow down which ones are showing the events you want, and we often end up here.  Especially for boxing!  One of the things I like about Hooters, and this one in particular, is that if you want to see - you have full view access.  But the TVs are high enough that if you could care less, you don't have to be staring at a television.  The problem is, it's Hooters.  If you aren't looking at the TV you have to be careful what it looks like you're looking at.  Is there such a thing as viewer's guilt?  Maybe there should be.  \n\nSounds bad, but totally honestly - I just feel really bad for the girls who have to walk outside on a chilly night.  The comments that they have to deal with can be really awful.  There should be some kind of a \"Bad comment\" jar, like the old-school \"Bad word\" jars when you cussed.

If you really have to read a yelp review on hooters, then you probably shouldnt be going there. \n\nThings to obviously know before entering hooters:  expect greasy food, slow service, chicks only mildly good looking thanks to butt lifts and makeup, annoying guys who think they are all going to be the next UFC champ, loud sports on 13 tvs, and some drunk guy getting into someones face in the corner causing a scene. The good things to expect is good food at decent prices that is fairly consistent regardless of location, good happy hour (depending on when you go), and great cold beer.  \n\nI give it 3 (this goes for the whole chain) cause i love their buffalo shrimp and buffalo 'chicks' sliders, and of course the wings.  However, I would give this location a 2 - it seems to attract a questionable clientele.  Last time we went on a Monday, sat outside on the patio watching the end of a basketball game, being only 1 of 4 tables in the place.  These guys were sitting behind us at different tables and started lightly arguing; ten minutes later it escalated to punches and beer being thrown literally over my head with the cooks and managers coming out with the cops on their way - subsequently slowing our already slow food by another 10 minutes.\n\nLastly, I will say this - DO NOT bring your kids here.

You should find a job that doesn't involve customer service.\n\nMy friend and I were super excited today for Wing Wednesday ($9.99 all you can eat wings). We walk in and are greeted instinctively but the female bartender who also tells us to sit wherever. I choose a table next to the double doors that leads to the outside seating area. For 10 minutes we sat there without even so much as eye contact or a smile from any of the waitresses. I see that there are two moderate groups outside (6-8 people each), but don't give it a second thought. Still no acknowledgment from anybody. After 15 minutes, my buddy walks up two managers who were fiddling with a tv monitor and 3 other waitresses surrounding them. My buddy goes, \"Umm, can we get some service??\" The female manager immediately appoints someone to go to our table. \n\nThis blondie informs us that **Brittany** is our waitress, but she would take our first order. A few minutes after she takes our order, the lovely Brittany shows up. We had already watched this girl walk right past our table about 10 times back and forth prior to talking to the managers. She apologizes, like a child whose been forced to do so, for \"not seeing\" us. A) Simple acknowledgment would have sufficed. B) My buddy is a BIG tall guy with a mohawk wearing a bright red shirt. How the heck could she not have seen us? She then makes a pathetic attempt to explain that she got slammed, and says that she will now take our order. I tell her that our orders have already been taken. We get our first round of wings in a fair amount of time after the order was put in by Blondie. I asked for ranch and never got it. My buddy's cajun wings were too salty so he only ended up eating 6 wings. Brittany came back and only asked to refill my friend's drink. He told her Mr. Pibb, and she brought back coke. She took his plate away and didn't bother to ask if he wanted more wings since it was all you can eat. He's a big guy!!! Oh that's right. She didn't take our order so of course she didn't know. Shortly after I finished my own round of wings. Typically, the girls will see that you have finished your wings halfway and immediately ask you if you want the next round put it. No one asked us this. So I finished my wings and asked my friend if he wanted to go or keep hoping that the service will improve. BTW, those big tables were long gone by then. It was actually pretty empty by then. The whole time we just watched Brittany try to calculate her tabs and collect her tips. \n\nMy friend wanted out, and he said he'll refuse to pay if they asked us. We head straight to the door and NO ONE bothered trying to stop us. Instead we heard Brittany,\"Sorry guys.\" as we left. They knew what was going on. This is the very worst service that I have ever had. I would have still tipped had we stayed til the end, but it was so terrible. My wings weren't even that great. \n\nIf you come here, and you get a girl that is tan, has shoulder length curly hair, and is named Brittany, ask for another waitress.", "business_id": "qsWxbgQwuomXvMseg23DGg", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-04-11", "type": "review"}

Huh?  Yes, you read that right.  After taking in the Body Worlds exhibit (What else does someone do after seeing dead bodies?  Have dinner of course!) at the AZ Science Center we headed to Pizzeria Bianco and decided that we really didn't want to wait 3.5 hours (Phoenix's equivalent of Bridge and Tunnel were at PB in full effect) for food, especially when there are so many great restaurants within 1 mile.  So off to Cheuvront it was, and what a great dinner it was.\n\nAtmosphere - 5 stars\nFood - 4.75 stars\nService - 3.75 stars\nOverall - 4.5 stars\n\nThis is my third visit over the past few years, and each time it has been on a weekend night with a surprisingly sparse crowd.  I'm not sure why this is.  I've never heard anything bad about this place, so I suspect AZ State Senator Cheuvront's restaurant must be suffering from light rail construction.  Their loss should be your gain, as diners are rewarded with light crowds and superb food and wine.  Even one of my dining guests visiting from New York City was impressed.\n\nThe sexy modern space on the first floor of the Artisan Lofts sets that perfect urban tone that the menu and locale indicate.  We sat at a table towards the back close to the loungey sofa area and curtained bar tables.  Cool touch.  We started out with a nice bottle of sauvignon blanc chilled in a fancy container and noshed on a French charcuterie plate of a pate mousse, cornichons (I have a weakness for salty gherkins), two cheeses, marinated artichokes, asparagus, kalamata olives, smooth spicy mustard and a crusty artisanal sourdough baguette.  What a great way to start a dinner, eh?\n\nOur main entrees continued the pace and didn't disappoint.  I ordered the prosciutto wrapped grilled shrimp and macaroni and cheese.  Those thangs weren't shrimp.  These MOFOS were GIANT tiger prawns, and they were presented on a bed of mango avocado salsa drizzled with a balsamic reduction.  HEAVEN.  The macaroni was impressive as well - and cooked with three fancy cheeses: Quebec cheddar, comte and a dry jack cheese. \n\nBonnie shared some of her ahi tuna salad nicoise - and that tuna was seared and seasoned perfectly, and surprisingly fresh.  Additionally I had a taste of the peppercorn filet and was pleased with the marinated tender taste of the meat.  \n\nPrice for 3 people (apps, entrees and $40 bottle of wine) - $115.  Average entree - $16.  Not bad, methinks.\n\nMy only complaint would be the service.  It was very good for the most part, but started to falter toward the end as our server's attentiveness (which was impressive most of the evening) left us with finished dinner plates on our table for about 15 minutes.  In his defense though, he gave us a very warm and classy (classy with a 'C') welcome and spoke very knowledgeably about the menu and wine when we had questions. Additionally, the hostess and other servers are super friendly and congenial. \n\nI'm eager for my next visit so I can try some of their martinis and buy cheeses from their retail section, but I would be just as happy enjoying a glass of wine there and soaking the place up.", "business_id": "muCl5p-9ut1sY0aKeUeRhw", "stars": 5, "date": "2007-05-20", "type": "review"}

They have the old reliables like the Kim Crawford Sav Blanc.  They even have -- and I'm very impressed by this -- Cakebread Vineyards Chard!  Now, granted, I'm not keen on throwing down $70 for a bottle, nor is it really in my disposable budget when two bottles of the Sav Blanc will suffice; but if we are talking about a special occasion, THAT is your bottle.\n\nThe cheese list is exhaustive and very impressive.  I wish I knew more about cheeses and pairings to offer a helpful review, but the pairings that were suggested by the waiter were perfect.  You can see their cheese menu online and its worth researching before you go so you'll know your varieties.\n\nThe thing that bothers me about Cheuvront, however, is their chronic lack of atmosphere.  First, it kind of feels like drinking in the lobby of an airport.  There just isn't a ton of ambiance.  While I do enjoy the lighting, the brightness reflecting off of the concrete mess that is Central Ave is just really uncomfortable when you are trying to enjoy a bottle.  Where as Pacifico pairs beautifully with the sunny deck of a pool, I count on dim, moody lighting for a bottle of Pinot.  \n\nFurthermore, the place is just usually dead, no excitement, or aura.  Its bright, lacks energy, and the seating is mostly awkward.  This place deserves an inspired crowd, but I've yet to see it yet.  The mood even trickles, up/down to the staff who seem to be going through some of the motions.  I don't know, maybe its just my perception.  I think a lot of it has to do with the enormous amount of spacing between tables, and of course, the trepidation of those couches that seem to infiltrate all posh valley spots.  Ugh.

The second white I had was poured for me by the very friendly bartender Jeff...I told him what kind of wine I liked and he hand-selected one for me to try.

The beer list while small has all of my favorite imports, so thumbs up on that as well.\n\nThe first time I dined at Cheuvront was for dinner and my friend and I started with the Brillat Savarin which was creamy and very much like brie...it was delicious. I loved how the server asked if we wanted more baguette when she saw we were running low because we still had a lot of cheese left.  I felt that the one cheese plate was a perfect size for two people to split as an appetizer. For dinner I had the caesar salad which was light and the perfect meal for a warm spring day.  I took a bite of my friend's Pizza Chevre which was really good and hearty.  \n\nI most recently dined at Cheuvront for lunch today with a group of friends. Our waiter was incredibly pleasant and even though the menu said they do not split checks, he was very nice about running two credit cards and breaking cash to make change.  Everyone at the table seemed very pleased by what they ordered. I had the macaroni and cheese which comes with a side salad. The mac and cheese was the perfect lunch sized portion and the salad was light and crispy.

What I enjoy most is the wine tastings (they have them every month).  Each time I go I learn something new about wine and have had the pleasure of tasting some unique and flavorful vino's.

The cheese plates are small and everything is a bit pricey, but I feel it's well worth it. Windows surround the building to the east and north. You can gaze out on Central Avenue and watch passers-by, cars and the light rail. The area suggests Phoenix is coming of age into a more distinctive urban area, rather than its notorious sprawling suburban-esque cityscape. It's in a gentrifying neighborhood that's quickly becoming a more artistic, upscale part of town. They have a lengthy wine and cheese list, the latter offering suggested wine pairings (if you're embarrassed to ask the server.) However, some pairings not suggested may surprise you. The last time I went I was a bit disappointed that my favorite wine they sell (Duck Pond) is only available by the bottle. The cheeses are good, though I've learned from experience to try a small taste of some before taking a larger bite, and I haven't heard of most of them before going here. I enjoy the Nearly Naked Theatre company, which performs at the neighboring Phoenix Art Museum, and always stop in here for a bit of wine and cheese prior to showtime.", "business_id": "muCl5p-9ut1sY0aKeUeRhw", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-05-25", "type": "review"}

Every two weeks, a Dinner Club member pulls a restaurant out of a hat (well technically its a manilla envelope). We then set a time and date and all meet at the selected restaurant. After dinner we all give the place a rating. Our official TDC star rating on yelp is an average of everyone's individual rating. \n\nAnd now to the food!\n\nCheuvront was the pick for the week of 5/11/09 was Cheuvront. We started with the cheese plate. One of the best things about Cheuvront is the tremendous selection of cheeses and usually a staff that actually knows about the cheeses on the menu. We did a three cheese plate...loved one, other two were ok. A bit spendy for the amount of cheese you get...but still quite satisfying.\n\nWe then decided to do an appetizer style dinner rather ordering individual entrees....we ordered the phyllo chicken pockets, pork empanadas, fig tart, mac and cheese flight, gnocchi, and the appetizer special (that evening it was seared scallops over a paella style risotto). We found all the appetizers to be pretty delicious...the consensus favorite was the fig tart, closely followed by the phyllo pockets. The mac and cheese flight was a favorite as well (we went with the bleu cheese, pancetta and onion, and spicy sausage...we ranked them in that order from favorite to least, although we enjoyed all three). There was not a dud among the selection, although in our discussion after dinner, everyone agreed that if we had to choose a loser it would be the empanadas.\n\nFor dessert, we ordered the house specialty, pumpkin bread pudding...which was darn tasty (although there are better bread puddings to be found).\n\nAll in all a wonderful dining experience!

But, I'm afraid that my recent experience was indicative of a change in the restaurant, and maybe I'm contributing to a turnaround, who knows?  But, as a disclaimer, I have been to Cheuvront many times before this and had a good to great experience.  This review is for the dinner I had there last saturday night.\n\nSo, having had great meals here, Sweet Pea and I decided to take the in-laws while they were in town.  The experience started off badly and only got worse.  We came in around 8:30 and were seated right away.  However, as soon as my butt hit the seat, the hostess turned to me (I guess I looked like the authority of the group of us) and said \"um, the kitchen is kind of backed up. Can you wait 15 minutes?\"  I looked at her with what must have been a very confused expression, and asked \"15 minutes?  Like, I have to wait 15 minutes before anyone even comes to talk to me??\" and she said \"yes, is that a problem?\"  Again, I looked at her incredulously and said \"well, I guess I don't really have a choice, do I?\" to which she just looked down and shuffled away.\n\nThen I was left to explain to Sweet Pea and the in-laws WTF she was just asking me.  An inauspicious start to an evening that we'd made big promises about.  Now, I don't know why she said this at all because our waitress was over shortly.  But, before she got there, said hostess came by and glumly slapped 4 wine glasses on our table...2 of which were dirty.  Not just dirty, one of them ACTUALLY STILL HAD WINE IN IT.  I am not joking.  So that was strike 2 for the in-laws to see...I was starting to feel about 1 inch tall, as I'm sure Sweet Pea was.\n\nWe ordered a selection of cheeses after raving that, although the whole dinner may not have started out well service-wise, the cheeses at Cheuvront are remarkable and a \"must-try\".  Our salads came out...and then our main courses.  No cheese.  We started wondering, were they doing it French-style, after the meal?  There was no further wondering when they brought out the dessert menu, then the check.  No mention of the cheese whatsoever.  It's like Sweet Pea going through the cheese menu WITH THE VERY SAME WAITRESS and selecting 4 cheeses never happened.\n\nGet your act together, Cheuvront.

None at the table were very knowledgeable about cheeses, but we told our server Zach our likes and dislikes and he steered us in the right direction.  This was a very nice start to the meal and ample for four people.  We paired it with an '08 Cakebread Sauvignon Blanc.  \n\nThere was a dinner entree of risotto cakes w/ peas, asparagus, and mushrooms that we all wanted to try so we put it in as an order for an appetizer.  The portion was fairly small so it was perfect for an appetizer, but I would have been a little disappointed had someone ordered it for their main course.\n\nFor our entrees two of us ordered the duck and the other two ordered the scallops.  The duck was prepared perfectly with crisp skin and moist breast.  This was served atop a red-wine risotto with blackberry gastrique. The menu stated there would be seasonal vegetables, but I caught very few on my plate.  The scallops were also cooked perfectly and were served with spinach/tomato/olive pasta.  We ordered a bottle of Delas \"Saint-Esprit\" Cotes du Rhone.  I felt bad about ordering one of the cheapest bottles on the menu (only $20!), but the Cotes du Rhone caught my eye and I wanted to try it.  It ended up being a very nice wine, whatta steal.\n\nDue to dietary restrictions of one guest, we had to request a change on one of the entrees and the server was very respectful of it and discussed it with the chef who obliged with no issues.  Kudos for going out of their way to take care of us.\n\nFor dessert we had a chocolate cookie filled with molten chocolate served with ice cream, along with cr\u00e8me brulee.  Both were not out of this world, but a nice finish nonetheless to a fabulous meal.\n\nAll in all this was a great place that was very reasonably priced where you could go all out and not feel too bad when the bill came. :) I enjoyed the wine list and it was apparent that they did not markup their wines as much as other restaurants.  The only reason this place does not get 5 stars is portion size, lack of vegetables with the entree (I much enjoy a meal of protein, vegetable, starch with somewhat equal ratios), and there was not one \"wow\" factor in which I will be telling my friends \"You MUST order this dish\" or a dish I have to come back for.   I wouldn't have minded the small portion size at all had it perhaps been on a bigger plate with more use of color.  \n\nI would definitely enjoy coming back and would love to try their happy hour.

None of the other dishes were really out-of-this-world great, but still impressive food for a place that appears to primarily be a wine bar. \n\nThe best part was that our server was able to recommend wines for each of us that we had never tried before but really enjoyed. I love trying new wines so that was a lot of fun. A small plus is that it prints the name of the wine on the receipt so I can actually remember the name to hopefully purchase a bottle another time. Even though I don't come to this midtown area often, this place is right down the street from the art museum so I will definitely be back.", "business_id": "muCl5p-9ut1sY0aKeUeRhw", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-05-16", "type": "review"}

We walked into the front entry and saw there was only one couple at a table and it was slow due to the time of day. We looked around and eventually expected to see anyone who worked there as we awkwardly waited near the hostess stand for several minutes. Finally, a server emerged who did not even acknowledge us in any way and went to help the one table. After that it appeared that a cook or someone from back of house came out to the bar and again did not acknowledge us either. Finally, a couple minutes later the waiter came out into the dining room again and we asked to see a wine list just to get his attention. He then made his way over to hand us a wine list. At that point, we were pretty much over this place as we did not want to see how much worse the service might get if we actually stayed.

For the first course I had a Truffle Mushroom Empanada which was basically a puff pastry stuffed with sauteed mushrooms and Comte cheese. I felt like it was a little dry and could've used a lot more cheese inside. The second course was Steak Au Poivre with french fries. The steak was good, not excellent. It was a little tough and chewy, which was especially noticeable because they never gave us steak knives and we had to use our butter knives to try and saw through the meat. The french fries were a big disappointment. I think they were just the frozen crinkly fries you can buy at the store - they reminded me of the fries they used to serve at lunch in the school cafeteria. The best part of the meal was the third course, a chocolate bouchon with vanilla icecream. The chocolate bouchon/cake was delicious, moist, and rich.\n\nService was great and my friends who ordered the wine pairings with their meals seemed to enjoy it.

Maybe.\n\nSirens, bells, flashing lights and yelling servers. And it's all for me because I've ordered the \"big unit\". Can't make this a review to take seriously, mostly just a blog entry as I've only been there a few times.\n\nLast night I chose this place for its proximity to the Bentley Gallery where I saw a wonderful chamber music concert.\n\nI did order the big unit. My dining buddies were in awe at its size. Even the 2-foot bun wasn't long enough to contain the dog: it pokes out both ends and over the edge of the restaurant-chafing-dish-size stainless steel tureen. I ordered it loaded with chili and cheese and onions on the side. Dog on one side, fries on the other. Take your iPhone because you must get a panoramic shot of yourself holding up the gigantic deep-dish container, mouth open wide. Ask for my facebook if you want to see it -- it's truly vulgar.\n\nThe dog is all-beef. About halfway through your server will ask if you want a box. A testament to my voracious appetite (and my companions' desire to graze) we gracefully declined. One by one, those fries disappeared, and slice by slice, we could have counted up the multiple dozens of grams of sodium ingested.\n\nUnfortunately the bun was that processed brown \"wheat\" spongy thing with a slightly rough but still squishy crust. Would have preferred a roll with more substance, perhaps toasty. Or they could have gone the extreme with the wonder-bread just-better-than-twinkies airy squish that Sonic uses for their coneys. It soaked up too much of the cheese and chili sauce.\n\nChili beans were the downfall for me. Must have had corn syrup for sweetner or starch for thickner, 'cause I paid for it later (corn allergy). Every so often I have to be baad and hope for the best while I wait for the worst. I'll eventually learn I just can't eat this stuff any more. Perhaps this little blog will get it out of my system.\n\nAll in all, I can only compare it to the standard set by Sonic. Of course, the best one is on pier39 or back east, depending upon your preferences.\n\nLimited beers on tap, but they had Kiltlifter, so I was happy. It's a diner with flair.

Expecting some of excitement and flair of his music, we arrived at Alice Cooperstown right after noon.  Granted, a popular time.  \n\nWhile an empty 4 top stared us in the face, we were told we would have to wait 5 minutes for a table.  We looked thorough the moderately-overpriced merchandise while waiting the longest 5 minutes in history.  \n\nSchool is NOT out.  Lesson One:  Allow plenty of time to get seated at Alice's. \n\nFinally seated, our server orbited by, only barely interested in our presence.  Having seen the big-unit pimped on TV, we had agreed to try it.  The \"Big-Unit\" is 22\" of all-beef hot dog on a bun.  For some reason I thought it would be special.  Stupid me.  We asked for cheese on top and for half of the dog to have chili as my wife doesn't like chili. So that means the whole dog would have cheese, and half of the dog would have both cheese and chili.  Complicated?  Read on.\n\nOK, so now we've been at Alice's for 50 minutes (FIFTY) and have not been served.  \n\nLesson two:  Service at Alice's is S-L-O-W.  \n\nNo matter how loud they pump up the music, the servers and kitchen can not keep the beat.  I hadn't intended on keeping track, but at 45 minutes I started to notice that I was getting pretty hungry.  At 55 minutes our server suddenly looks in our direction, probably from the pain of 3 pairs of eyes following her every move and rushes to the kitchen.  \n\nThe \"Big Unit\" is supposed to be the signature dish at Alice's.  When a \"Big Unit\" is served a bell is rung and all the servers stand up and mutter (in unison) \"big unit\".  Ob la te, ob la ta, life goes on.  Not much of a production, but that's ok.  I didn't really want the hoopla I thought might come with it.  \n\nLesson Three:  The \"Big Unit\" is no Big Deal.\n\nThe BU arrives naked on one side and cheese and chili on the other. Sheesh\n\nLesson four: Wait staff either cannot take orders or do not check orders.  \n\nBut, by this time our parking meter was going to run out, so eating was our first priority. \n\nLesson 5, bring quarters for the meters or park in the public garage.\n\n We politely asked for mayo, pickle relish and onions as the waitress drifted by from time to time. The mayo came first....5 minutes later the pickle relish was dropped off on a buzz by, and the onions...well, we never saw them.  \n\nLesson six: oh hell, you get the idea.\n\nOur dining partner ordered a fried chicken sandwich.  Her only comment was that it would have better if it had not been fried and was otherwise bland.\n\nI think this is really a place to go for a beer at the bar. Or, if you are with a group large enough to attract the interest of the wait staff and and your group is interested in drinking mass quantities of beer, thus disabling the usual gag reflex that might prevent you from eating everything put in front of you.  Or maybe you want to embarrass a weight challenged friend and make them order a \"big deal\" (oh sorry, \"Big Unit\") and watch them stuff 22\" of all-beef boiled doggie into their face.  ha ha ha.  What fun.  Really.\n\nOK, so the bottom line.  \n\nGo once 'cause you can't believe all the other bad reviews and you're sure Alice would never be a part of this.  Then, write a review apologizing to all the previous reviewers who tried to warn you.\n\nOh oh, I almost forgot.  The wait staff wear eye makup.  Just like Alice.  Well, sorta like Alice.  Alright, not at all at all like alice.\n\nLike I said, Alice doesn't live here anymore.  And we told you so.

All of my dish was served at a room temperature. I don't expect it to come straight off the BBQ but at least microwave it before you send a plate out. I was expecting Nightmare Chili have flavor and heat but it turned out more like a Nap Time Chili cause it was very boring flavor. \n\nI would give this place a second chance cause service was good but no recommendations till then.

They arrived hot and fast, and were crispy and tasty. Our server wasn't what one would call personable, but it kinda went with the vibe of the place. In another environment I probably wouldn't have been amused. \n\nI was torn between ordering more standard bar fare (like a burger) or the chipotle pasta dish. I ended up with the pasta, and it was very good. Just enough heat for my wimpy palate. My dining partner ordered the grilled veggie sandwich, and was very disappointed. She said it was essentially a salad on Texas toast. However, she said that the fries and chili were very good. I'm a sucker for themed restaurants, so I thought the decor was fun.

Every time I passed by, it looked like a fun place to go hang out.  I finally had the opportunity to do so during a conference in downtown Phoenix.  One of the companies at the conference hosted a party here.\n\nThe party was staged in the patio area as you enter the restaurant.  The company who hosted the party was giving away complimentary Cigars, so I understand why they had it outdoors.  The weather was perfect, so it was a good time of the year to do it.  The place was packed too.  So why the 2 Stars?  Here's why:\n\n- They serve Wine out of a liquor gun....yes, they do.  When I went up to the bar on the patio and asked for a glass of Cabernet, the bartender told me \"You have to go inside because we don't have the handles with the Wine\".....I thought she was kidding and I said, \"I'm sorry, I don't think you understand, I asked for a glass of Cabernet.  You don't have any bottles back there?\"....that's when she confirmed what I heard and said \"No, you heard me right, we serve Wine out of a handle/line and since we're a smaller bar outside you have to go inside to get it\".......what the hell?!  The Wine tasted like what you would expect Wine from a tap to taste like...\n\n- The restrooms are like gas station restrooms.  They're located out next to the bars on the patio and they are just like gas station restrooms in that they're too small and dirty.  They couldn't handle the crowd of people at the party.\n\n- Service is slow.  The line at the bar was 30 people deep for each line (2 lines).  There were only 2 bartenders to service 200+ people.  It took 20+ min to get a drink.\n\n- The party felt like a house party in someone's backyard.  Plastic cups, plastic furniture, you had to bus your own table.....there were no buspersons or anyone to clean up.  Bizzaro-world.....\n\nOverall, not a good experience.

I was in Phoenix to celebrate my 50th birthday in my birth town and decided to have lunch at Alice Cooper'stown. Overall I had an awesome experience.\n\n I like how the women get into the theme, with cutoff denim shorts, black tanks and tees and AC eye makeup. Everyone I encountered was friendly and helpful but I want to make a special shout out to Susie. She took outstanding care of me. I decided to go with the tuna casserole based on her suggestion/recommendation...it was wonderful: creamy, great flavor, not fishy smelling or tasting. Onion rings would have been a great side (hint hint). I wasn't familiar with Kilt Lifter and she gave me a sample with my Hefe. It was so good I had two full glasses. Susie was attentive without being overbearing AND invited me to walk around to check out the memorabilia. Good waitress/bartender she is, she gave me a covered cup of water to keep me hydrated.\n\nI especially liked the decor - a combination of music and sports memorabilia with lots of Alice Cooper influence.  The music totally ROCKED.  The restaurant also has a nice selection of tshirts and sweatshirts for sale. Maybe a bit overpriced but hey! they're in business to make money.\n\nHere's a tip: go at lunch. I'm sure the dinner crowd is exactly that - a crowd. Next time I'm in Phoenix I'm definitely going back. Thanks Susie for taking care of me!!", "business_id": "oCA2OZcd_Jo_ggVmUx3WVw", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-04-29", "type": "review"}

My husband and I and a few other people decided to stop in for food and drinks before the Tool concert but I think everyone else had the same idea and they were pretty busy, the wait was too long so we just decided to order straight from the bar and get our food and drinks to go.  To start with, there were only 2 bartenders behind the bar and like I said, it was super busy.  My husband had to pretty much push his way  up to the bar.  He had to wait about 5 minutes to place our order (he got a vanilla vodka screwdriver, a water for me, my daughter and I got the John O' Hurley Buffalo Chicken Wrap, and my husband ordered the Johnny Beef Depp) which wasn't too bad, but then the bartender just took off before my husband could even ask how we were suppose to know when our food was ready.  She ignored us and talked over my husband to other people.  Finally, when she did come back over, she was rude and said \"just stand over there, I will yell at you when your stuffs ready.\" and pointed randomly over to the side.  My husband then asked her if she wanted his name and she responded rudely again, \"we don't have that information.\" But his name was on the receipt... ??  Ok then.\n\nSo, we just waited off to the side and in the meantime got yelled at by a waitress and a bus boy that we were in the way.  The bus boy actually took the time to rudely show us a line in the concrete floor that we needed to stand behind, when we were standing where we were told to by the bartender.  Finally after about 20 mins our food was ready and the waitress yelled very loudly while pointing at us, \"Hey you!! come get your food!!\"  So my husband went over to get it and she had two different orders sitting there and she basically shoved one of the bags at him and said, \"is this yours...yeah I think this is yours.\"  Then our friend that was with us, who ordered before us had to ask her if the other order was his and she shoved it him and said, \"I think this one is yours.\" and walks away. He had to actually open up his bag and check to make sure that order was his.  She didn't even check the orders before shoving them at us!  Granted the bar was getting crushed with people and they were understaffed so I understand that, but being rude doesn't equate to return customers.\n\nWe ended up sitting outside at one of the picnic tables to eat.  My buffalo chicken wrap was minus the buffalo!! It was just a plain old crispy chicken wrap with ranch, way too much lettuce, a few diced tomatoes, and some cheese (I think in maybe 2 bites I had).  My wrap wasn't even hot.  It came with 2 sides....I chose fries and apple slices.  The fries were o.k. really had no seasoning on them and the apple slices were just the basic bagged apples, one of them was actually kinda soggy.  My daughters order was exactly the same as mine.  It was o.k. nothing impressive.  My husband said his sandwich was  made with good quality beef but without the au jus it would have been dry.  He said it was actually pretty good.  My husband thought the fries were good.  His screwdriver was VERY strong, which I would believe it to be a result of over pouring, but the bartender said when she handed it to him that she made it very strong on purpose because he was patient.  \n\nI know Alice Cooper is a huge sports nut so the ambiance is geared more towards that with T.V.'s all over the place, very little music related decor, kinda just comes across as a typical sports bar.  I really don't think I will go back in the future due to our food and service being bad.", "business_id": "oCA2OZcd_Jo_ggVmUx3WVw", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-03-28", "type": "review"}

At first, I was reminded of the Hard Rock Cafe in Florida, but eventually I began to notice some similarities between Alice Cooper and my grandmother, because Alice Cooper'stown is much like that of an eccentric old woman's, it is cluttered from years of hoarding petty and useless things. The only difference is that instead of having numerous pictures of family and cats covering the walls, there are numerous pictures of Alice Cooper doing Alex Cooper things, like pretending a guitar is a baseball bat and scowling at a camera like a rebellious teenager while dressed as Baron Samedi. \n\nHowever, despite the similarities to grandma's house, this is the go to bar when it comes to celebrating a D-Backs win. While many Phonecians get a lot of flack for their lack of support of the team, you wouldn't know it if you visited this place after a game. I am not normally a big fan of places like these, mainly due to the noise, which is mainly due to the fact that when I go out to eat, I tend to try to enjoy the food and the atmosphere, and have a conversation with a friend, however, for the purposes of going to a bar to celebrate with others, this was perfect. \n\nWhy the 4 stars then? It was way too gimmicky for food that wasn't special as a whole or for the price. For instance, they have a Mike  Myers Yeah Baby which is a disgusting sandwich with cheap cuts of meat for 17 dollars, and a Magic Johnson mushroom and swiss burger for 11 dollars. I had the big unit burger and the mac and cheese, both of which were above average for their taste, but were exorbitantly high priced. I could have gotten 3 hot dogs at the stadium for the price of the big unit alone! \n\nOverall though, this place is worth a visit for the fun and novelty of doing so. I had a lot of fun here.

I drove a few blocks away and parked for free but walked and didn't get to the restraint till 6. I asked the host if they served food at the bar and he said the just stopped serving food???? (don't folks come here after the game? Anyway just went to the bar and the bartender, NICK saved the day, rushed back and got me some chicken wings, so not all was lost.\n\nTHANKS NICK!!

He came over took our order,  drinks first but when I questioned him about beers on tap or what the restaurant had, he was really unsure. nevertheless he came by and gave us our drinks . He got them wrong. He fixed it but then didn't come back for another 25 minutes to take our order. now that part we weren't really annoyed because we had conversations and drinks in front of us. When he finally came over to take our order we wanted an appetizer. Now it would have been nice to have gotten an appetizer right when we gotten our drinks because then those 25 minutes wouldn't have seemed so bad. ... A food runner came out shortly after and brought us our appetizer. It then took another 15 minutes for him to come back to take our food order. The food came out just right thank god. But  After about 10 minutes you would expect for a server to come over and ask you how the meal is, am i right? Well he did no such thing. NOT only did he not come over to the table at all to check on the status of our food but he also payed no attention to us .  And my wife had to scream sir across the restaurant because we didn't know his name but finally he paid attention and came over to the table. when he did he got what we needed but then it took another 30 minutes or so to get his attention again to do a final check on our food and for our bill.

The price of a bottle is pretty reasonable, although if you wait to order a bottle at The Restaurant, it is priced cheaper for some reason.  \n\nBar Bianco also used to serve Quilmes beer from Argentina, but apparently discontinued this practice.  \n\nI've been here as both a subservient to Pizzeria Bianco, but also as a leisurely drinker respite from the binds of pizza, and I must say that its one of the most underrated drinking spots in the Valley.", "business_id": "JR95uaM82xBUIZ-kQ785iA", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-04-07", "type": "review"}

Secondly, I have never been into a more judgemental place with truly rude patrons and staff in my life. I understand I don't look like a lesbian anymore, but that's no reason to treat me with disrespect at this establishment. Also, I do not care how old you are and if you're friends with the owner or not, I will not stand quietly in the corner while you talk shit about Trans people. On top of it I got kicked out after just showing up because I was \"too drunk\" when really the bitch who picked an argument with me cause she wanted to say shit about another lgbt community decided to go tattle on me. You're right tho, I was too drunk, too drunk to deal with your dumb lesbian bullshit. Basically, if you're not a lesbian don't go anywhere near this place as you will get treated like shit and then get kicked out for voicing your opinion.

It's right on the corner of 10th Street & Roosevelt in a cute little red and white dining car.  There are a few parking spaces behind the diner on 10th Street.  I would check the hours, as I think I was told differently than the hours posted in the other review.\n\nMy friend and I went to the diner on a Saturday afternoon and were able to get seats inside at the tiny counter.  I'm sure as it gets warmer, those will be harder to come by and that when the weather is nice, most people sit outside.  It is indeed a tiny space on the inside and half the seats have a direct view into the kitchen area, which is kind of homey.  I'm pretty small, so the size inside wasn't an issue for me, but claustrophobes and bigger people might feel squished.\n\nI ordered a hamburger and fries and my friend got an egg sandwich.  The burger was pretty good, but relatively small in comparison to what's generally served at restaurants.  If you're really hungry or a big eater, you'll probably want to go for the double burger.  The fries were good - nice and crisp.  My friend was pretty happy with her egg sandwich but unhappy with her cup of water, which was apparently pretty bad even for tap water.  They have a bunch of organic sodas, along with Coke and Diet Coke, if you're like me and can't wash down a burger and fries with anything but a carbonated beverage.\n\nOverall, I thought it was a pretty cool place and will definitely return with more friends in tow.  (Possibly for one of their movie nights...movies + tasty food = a good time).  Bonus points for their helping with the downtown rejuvenation while also supporting local businesses (Schreiner's, Mary Coyle's).", "business_id": "tb24fvNJfHhyKEXkKn12Xw", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-04-16", "type": "review"}

The burger easily beats out even cult-status places like Delux or In n Out, and their handcut fries are subtly crunchy and salty.  Their salsa burger topping absolutely rocks the block.  And I don't know if their ketchup is made by the Magical Man from Happy Land who lives in a gumdrop house on Lollipop Lane, but something about it slaps a toothy grin on my head.\n\nThe picnic tables outside make you feel like you are doing something productive while you gorge yourself.  Like its okay to ingest a thousand calories as long as you are given the impression that you are on a hike or something.  But whatever.  Its all class.\n\nMy only beef (Heh.

Get there... now. Payton is known for pushing limits and incorporating fresh, local ingredients. The menu will likely change every week, if not every night, so I'm not sure if my recap will help all that much, but here goes.\n\nThe neighborhood is sketchy, the place is tiny, and the accommodations are \"rustic\", so if you're all into the Scottsdale scene or flashing your dough, don't bother. That being said, Shantal mentioned that being there made her feel like she was camping every night, and I have to admit the evening had a vacation feel to it... National Lampoon's style!\n\nYou can instantly tell that Payton is having a blast and it shows on his face and in the food. We were seated on a collection of old dining chairs at a makeshift table of 2x8s and construction horses in the middle of the front yard, with a candle to light our way... I knew it was going to be a sweet evening!\n\nWe started with the burrata that was lightly seasoned with truffle oil and cracked pepper. Unfortunately a lot of people are adding burrata to their menus and they have no idea that this fresh, creamy, delicate version is how it's truly meant to be. It was served with slices of toast that I expected to be the brick-hard version to which I've become accustomed. Imagine my surprise as I bit into a spongy, buttery slice of bread with just a crunch of the crust! Delicious.\n\nThe porcini foie gras terrine will scare those faint of heart, but it's amazing and the pear butter adds this velvety, sweet flavor that just makes it unforgettable. I wasn't a fan of the pate', but it was a combination of pickle, horseradish, and mustard flavors with chunks in the loaf... all things I can personally only handle in moderation individually and generally dislike, so it was exactly as described. The mains arrived and the Sonoma lamb sugo proved to be an interesting choice. It's not something you would eat on a regular basis, but I'm so glad I got to try it. The shreds of lamb meat were piled on top of a bowl of hearty fettuccine with perfectly cooked chickpeas and dollops of cream that muted any gaminess of the meat. Then you would get a bite of golden raisin to kick in a touch of sweetness; pretty cool combination of flavors and textures without being over the top.\n\nPerhaps the biggest surprise of the night was the bowl of Bolognese that was planted in front of us, it blew me away and I have no idea why!! Payton, what's your secret with something so simple? Dessert followed with apple pie that could've been much tastier if it were warmed with a scoop of ice cream, but all was rescued with a huge chunk of bread pudding that puts my mother's recipe to shame (and it was served warmed with a scoop of ice cream :). \n\nAll in all, we had a wonderful night with fabulous food and fun friends and we didn't want the night to end. If you want a hint of adventure, get to Welcome Diner before the end of May... seriously...

Chef, I hear, tries to keep it real and keep it local and fresh when sourcing his menu, so it changes each week.  McClendon's Select was mentioned more than once.\n\n(PRICE NOTE:  On Tuesdays from 10pm-close, the menu is 1/2 price to be sure Curry exhausts his fresh produce and meats.)\n\nWelcome Diner was serving about 12 people when we arrived, 6 at the inside counter and three couples outside dotting the front yard, set up with a picnic table, a sawhorse, some two tops, and glass tabletop lanterns.\n\nThe food came out quickly, and our gracious and knowledgeable server asked if we'd like our dishes as they were prepared or in courses. We opted for the former.  My darling dining partner and I shared all four dishes.\n\nTHOSE DAMN GREEN BEANS\nWe started with green beans, as crisp as they were picked, with just one tip snapped off, just like my grandmother taught me.  These were served with a citrus creme fraiche and some recently picked tarragon.  I always love dairy with tarragon, and this dish, served cool (not cold) if I remember, was dusted with local bee pollen, granular bits that taste of honey and something else and melt on your tongue.\n\nMOZZARELLA\nThe menu insists there's basil in this tangential rendition of caprese -- and there probably is -- but the takeaway message from this panko-encrusted slab of mozzarella with the sweetest tomatoes I've eaten is a sweet-n-sour burst with every olive oily bite.  A standout appetizer.\n\nGNOCCHI\nIf you're like me, when you've eaten or prepared gnocchi before, you assume they get plopped into the boiling salted water before the plump up and rise to the surface.  Not so fast, Barilla Boy.  Payton Curry's gnocchi, I believe, are (dry?) pan-seared on both sides,   keeping all the doughy, gummy deliciousness often lost in the water.  The madeira wine and cream reduction here smothers the pillowy gnocchi and tooth-tender walnuts and squiggly good morel mushrooms in a way that makes you close your eyes, shut off your hearing, and attempt to pour all of your sensory energy into taste and smell.  When eating this dish, I more than once covered my face with my hand to shield what may have been unflattering facial pangs of ecstasy.  \n\nLEMON CURD\nWe struggled to choose this dessert over the Strawberry Olive Oil Cake and Strawberry Malt, but we got our strawberry fix as the second layer in this delectable parfait, topped with the airiest foamy meringue, and served in a mason jar.  The macerated strawberries made you want to relive childhood and replace mom's jelly with Payton's strawberries to accompany Laura Scudder in your PB&J sandwich.  We clanged spoons at the bottom of the jar for the last bit of bee pollen.\n\n$62 with tax and tip.  We didn't bring a BYOB wine but would next time.

Everyone working in the tiny dinette and serving the tables outside had huge smiles and loads of enthusiasm for what they were contributing to the Garfield neighborhood and to the downtown culinary scene.  Others are taking notice, too. Michelle Laudig (former restaurant critic at Phoenix New Times) and Aaron Chamberlin of St. Francis both dropped in during our dinner.\n\nI worry about the AZ heat baking the charm out of patio dining in May, June, and July for Chef Curry, but I hope to return in April...maybe on a Tuesday at 10pm for half-price eats.", "business_id": "tb24fvNJfHhyKEXkKn12Xw", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-04-20", "type": "review"}

We clanged spoons at the bottom of the jar for the last bit of bee pollen.\n\n$62 with tax and tip.  We didn't bring a BYOB wine but would next time.  (The $13 corkage fee seems high, but there ought to be an explanation for that.)  Everyone working in the tiny dinette and serving the tables outside had huge smiles and loads of enthusiasm for what they were contributing to the Garfield neighborhood and to the downtown culinary scene.  Others are taking notice, too. Michelle Laudig (former restaurant critic at Phoenix New Times) and Aaron Chamberlin of St. Francis both dropped in during our dinner.\n\nI worry about the AZ heat baking the charm out of patio dining in May, \nJune, and July for Chef Curry, but I hope to return in April...maybe on a Tuesday at 10pm for half-price eats.\n\nOther reviews of Payton Curry's chef-in-residence at Welcome Diner: http://www.yelp.com/biz/payton-curry-at-welcome-diner-phoenix", "business_id": "tb24fvNJfHhyKEXkKn12Xw", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-04-20", "type": "review"}

All were delicious, but the Holy Puerco was amazing.  A cheesy grit cake smothered in the most delicious pork I've ever eaten, topped with an egg and house-made pork cracklings, served with flavorful, crunchy potatoes...\n\nI love to sit at the counter.  The crowd is friendly and the WD team is personable and efficient.  There is also plenty of seating outside, as there are only 9 stools at the diner counter.  And since it's in my neighborhood, I can easily walk or bike there.\n\nFood is locally sourced when possible.  I was there yesterday when the guy dropped off the duck eggs.  Most entrees are in the 8-10 dollar range.  They have beer, wine, and limited cocktails.  I highly recommend the Hurricane, with fresh-squeezed juices, light and dark rums, and pomegranate grenadine.  And the new management DOES take credit/debit cards with the square.  You can have your receipt sent to your email or phone number.  I mention this because I saw a couple order who'd never paid with the square before.\n\nWelcome Diner is open for brunch and dinner, but not every day.  I know they close at 3 on Sundays.

I always looked for it when I passed it on my way down Roosevelt but always seemed to miss it.  I practically smacked myself in the forehead when we arrived today.  I felt stupid, but then again, there are some places I just can't see until I plan to stop there.\n\nIt took some convincing to get my husband to give a place other than his favourite Joe's Diner a chance for a delicious (post hangover) brunch/breakfast a chance.  We got there a little early due to it being their last brunch weekend before summer and I am paranoid of crowds and hipsters.\n\nWe arrived and found ourselves seats under an umbrella in the shade.  We got some water from the cooler and perused the menu and specials.  After some deliberating (sunrise sandwich or holy puerco?) and discussion (welcome breakfast has no meat -- I need my protein at breakfast), he went with the special boudin breakfast and I got the holy puerco.  We both had fresh squeezed ojs and beignets.\n\nIt was worth it.  Dear goodness I have not tasted pork jowl cruncy bits like those ever (and their meat is provided by meat shop and shreiners!).  The combination of flavors on the puerco thing was just delicious.  And the hashbrowns were fresh and not too crispy and not overpowering and flavorful.  I kind of wanted some sour cream to go with the flavors and make them like a crunchy baked potato.\n\nThe beignets are not as fluffy as the ones I remember in New Orleans but definitely will satisfy this girls desire for fried dough.  They are yummy and powdered and you must be careful or the sugar will make you cough.  The honey is also oh so good.\n\nThe husband very much enjoyed his boudin special and it was gone very quickly.  He said it was all very tasty and he was glad we braved the heat for the opportunity to try the breakfast before it is gone.\n\nWe also got a hurricane to share at the very end.  It tastes like juice, or sunshine in a cup.  But it does pack a punch.  I felt that drink (the few sips I had) by the time we got back home.

My food was delicious and the staff seemed genuinely friendly and interested in how I thought that the food was, which is always the sign of a good chef.  I did have to wait a little bit, but I didn't mind too much, since it's a small establishment.  People should be forewarned that there is very limited seating indoors and that most of the seating is outdoors on the patio.  I personally thought that it was nice to sit outside, especially with the mural on painted on the fence/wall, but I understand that it might not be so comfortable to sit outside at the picnic tables in extremely hot Phoenix weather, especially if it was a busy day and you had to share a bench/table with a bunch of people you don't know.\n\nI got a fried green tomato sandwich on sourdough with house-made corn salsa and arugula.  It was fantastically delicious.  The ingredients were fresh and everything from the toasting of the bread to the battering of the tomatoes was well-executed.  Although the sandwich was filling and came with a slice of cantaloupe, I wish that it had come with some sort of side, like home-made potato chips, for the price.

Now it's so much more than that.\n\nHave you ever watched someone hand you a glass of local red wine blend through a trailer window? How about a Sazerac? Well, it's time to change that. (Here I am assuming you said no. If you said yes, please un-see this section and continue.) When you start your meal with a southern throwback cocktail and finish it with homemade beignets, you best believe that whatever comes in between is going to knock your socks off. This is fine because you're probably sitting outside, so the dress code is pretty nonexistent, anyway.\n\nMy crew ordered the three most talked-about items on the menu. The peanut butter burger is the safe option + a bit of \"flare\" that is essentially peanut sauce. The meat is delicious, as is the bun and everything else between it. We also had the Carol, which was a unique BBQ pulled pork & biscuit sandwich with slaw... a mustard-y spin on a stack of down-home delicious. Last but DON'T YOU EVER THINK LEAST, the Bumblebee fried chicken & biscuit sandwich with honey and amazing b&b pickles. Us Southerners opted to scoot the mustard to the side and let the honey shine, but you could probably do anything to this fried chicken and it would still be incr-edible. Just get it. Get a bucket of it.\n\nNow let's talk beignets. (Don't you wish people said that to you more often? You're welcome.) You can get them with powdered sugar & honey or peanut butter & jam. The waitress literally said the pb&j beignets were her favorite thing in the world, and then quickly added her daughter as a frontrunner to the favorites list. Not knowing her taste in dessert, or daughters for that matter, I trusted her immediately and was thrilled with the combination of light, lemony fried dough juxtaposed with fresh berries and creamy peanut butter. Ain't nothing wrong with the classic, but damn it, it's 2014. The matrimony between pb&j and beignet shouldn't even be questioned.\n\nTL;DR - The Welcome Diner isn't just tasty, it's soulful and lovely.

I drove out here after work on a Friday, by myself, and knew as soon as I could see it that this place was a gem. It's tucked in a neighborhood, with a red and white trailer, neon lights, and string lights over wooden tables. It's so perfect that I wish I thought of it myself. \n\nYou order at a little window and can see three guys all crammed inside, cooking up amazing food. They had happy hour specials while I was there, and I got a local draft beer that was delicious. After much debate, I settled on the North Carolina pulled pork biscuit and a special side salad with a shallot vinaigrette (although it was hard not to order skinny fries and Brussels too!). I was worried it would be packed, but there were just enough people to comfortably eavesdrop and still have some elbow-room. \n\nThe food was amazing. You can tell everything is made in small batches, with love and attention to detail. Someone came out and checked on me while I was eating, offered to grab me another drink, and whisked away my dishes as soon as I was finished. Overall, it was a perfect dining experience, and I only wish I could pick this place up and plant it down on the East Coast!", "business_id": "tb24fvNJfHhyKEXkKn12Xw", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-03-11", "type": "review"}

We followed this with their summer salad of watermelon, tomato, ginger pickled rinds, and arugula surrounded by a delicious basil cashew pesto. Unbelievably refreshing.

Not just for the food but the environment too! Sometimes I admit that I don't always feel cool here cause so many people there are but for some reason I still always feel like I fit in. The staff there is awesome and makes you feel like a family! The customers are so cool you will end up starting random conversations with people sitting next to you. It's pretty easy on the inside since it's only a 9-seat bar but many more options outside. \nIt's so good that we decided to go there on a rainy night thinking it wouldn't be busy since most of the seating it outside - WRONG! The place was packed!!\nMy favorite thing about it is that it provides downtown Phoenix with an amazing option at 1:00am!! Even 1:45am!! \nHappy Hour is awesome! It changes so check it out! It used to be all day Sundays but think that stopped, now I think it's only like 5-7 or something and maybe Tuesday all night? not sure, I'd look into it though! I order the Pountine Fries all the time!! Crispy french fried covered in gravy and cheese, sure I pass out afterward but it always is worth it! Drinks good and strong too!! Great beers on tap, usually a local option or two as well!\nI tell everybody about this place because this is def a local business you want to support and keep in the neighborhood as long as possible!!\nThey also just opened up an awesome chicken & Donut place on like baseline at 16th st.\nDo yourself a favor and go!! But not on Mondays cause they are closed and not until 5:00pm, when they open :) \n*Bike parking available and free car street parking too!!", "business_id": "tb24fvNJfHhyKEXkKn12Xw", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-05-16", "type": "review"}

It's a laid back, casual, hole in the wall, neighborhood gem.  LOVE that there is this historic looking little diner in the middle of what appears to be a residential area.  Reminds me of the historic district back home.   I picked my husband up from the airport at 11pm and thought, \"Hey...why not?! Let's try it!\".  I'm SO glad we did.  \n\nIt was PACKED.  I asked if they were always that busy and he said \"Yep.  Often busier.  We use fresh ingredients and make good food.  It makes a big difference.\"   I felt like a newbie ordering, asking for a receipt, etc. (because they were so busy), but they were as patient as they could be.\n\nMy husband and I both ordered biscuits and gravy to go.  He ordered his with two over-medium fried eggs and I ordered mine with a side of brussel sprouts.   While we were waiting, he had a soda and I had the Ginger Beer.  The Ginger Beer was knock your socks off spicy, but I'm sure it's what saved me from a night full of tummy troubles (eating rich biscuits and gravy right before bed is probably not a good idea).  It was definitely homemade and packed a TON of ginger punch. It will make your throat burn in a good way.\n\nThe food was outstanding.  The biscuits were sliced in half, toasted, and accompanied by the super thick, rich sausage gravy.  For us, the gravy had a bit too much heat (excessive black pepper, perhaps cayenne...not sure), but...it was still VERY tasty and we both ate every bit. His eggs were perfect and my sprouts were fantastic with just the right amount of caramelization and oil/butter. \n\nWe will definitely be back and often.  :)", "business_id": "tb24fvNJfHhyKEXkKn12Xw", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-05-24", "type": "review"}

A little different than what I've had in New Orleans, but c'mon, deep fried dough and sugar. You can't go wrong. The honey gave it kind of an Arizona twist.

Why do guys have a bigger bathroom than us gals?? We have 3 stalls, one sink and a small foggy mirror.

The service however is hit or miss...and last night the service missed the mark by a mile!\n\nOur waiter got to our table and asked for our drink order.  Good deal.  We order when he returns with our drinks.  \n  \nJ's order - Fajitas. \nMy order - Oriental Chicken Salad\nBaby C's order - Kids Meal Grilled chicken sandwich  (Kids Eat Free on Tuesdays)\n\nOur server, Michael,  runs off before I'm able to state..uhhh...the kids meal comes with a drink and side!!  We have to flag him down.  We state...we didn't have a chance to order the drink or side for our son.  He's like...oh i ordered him fries.  I'll have to go change it.  \n\nREALLY!?  I'm so sorry to inconvenience you!!  And I'm glad you think you know better than I do what I wanna feed MY CHILD!  Wow!  How perceptive of you...ya dumbazz!!  I order Baby C some steamed broccoli and a juice.  \n\nJ's and my food come out as ordered.  Baby C's is MIA.  A few minutes later his sandwich is brought out....with an applesauce.  Again I have to flag down the server so the correction can be made.  About 5 minutes later we get a side of over steamed broccoli...but whatever.  Baby C doesn't seem to mind.  \n\nDrinks...he's on the ball with refills of my water.  But misses the mark with J's root beer refill.  He brings him Dr. Pepper instead.  And then when J says...hey this is Dr. Pepper, not Root Beer.  The server is like..you ordered Dr. Pepper though, right?  WRONG!  \n\nThen we had to wait around for the check and for him to run my card.  It was funny, but I was looking around and spotted the servers other tables.  The one right next to us didn't seem happy either with the service.

Our visit was on a Sunday, mid afternoon, so I'm basically reviewing the food  and not the whole UK pub experience which I usually rate poorly having escaped the bloody country in the first place:) E.g this is 15 plus years of eating 2-3 times a week in bars as the yardstick I'm taking a swing with. \n\n Firstly the good parts.  Their spicy wings, boy do they deliver.  It's  at minimum a heavy vinegar / buffalo sauce   , thai chilis? and enough of the seeds to make my wife's nostrils clear from accross the table.  Boy these where nicely done, full and a fricking bargain. For this and the cider alone  I'm returning. \n\nThen the meal.\n\nI had an awful hankering for offal but alas the steak and kidney pie was mispelled and I ended up with a steak and kidney piece.  There are so few places that do this dish and seemingly none that do this well. Ok I can do without  large lumps of kidney  but  not without the taste. This thing was thick and herby to the point that  calling a  thyme out would have been useful. This took the 4 to a 3.  \n\nWIfey's yorkshire pudding was burned ( not that hard admittedly) but  the roast beef  didn't appear to have been roasted, least on site. It's like Birds Eye boil in the bag roast beef simmered in gravy.There was zero indication the outer surface had been  exposed to dry heat of anykind  and we think we know where to get it :) If it's not then  they really suck at roast beef.  That and it didn't come with the horseradish on the menu. \n\nService, pleasant but kinda slow .For the food  2.5  rounded down to 2 because It's really not OK  to have two main dishes fall so far short of pub food.", "business_id": "3xEB9FyFXolq1b_Qn_BFtg", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-03-02", "type": "review"}

It always cracked me up whenever the guy talked about the bangers and mash.  We finally stopped by one day after a lovely little trip on the lightrail.\n\nThe entrance is a little confusing being on the south side of the building.  I guess this is because I am used to entrances being in the fronts of buildings as opposed to on the side.  When you walk in, you see everything you expect.  A couple pool tables, dingy floors, a seedy looking bar, and tables and chairs scattered about.  There are a decent amount of booths as well.  One thing that I noticed and considered a bit odd was the fact that a third of the restaurant seemed to be sort of partitioned off for the \"fancy\" dining area.  I don't know if that is the case, but it definitely looked that way.  When it comes down to it, this place is a classically tacky pub type restaurant, and I like it.\n\nUnfortunately, the food is not so great.  Neither is the bitchy service you get when you come in.  A half smile would be a welcome gesture instead of a perfect view of my server skulking in the kitchen.  I'm not sure what was up with that.  Maybe PMS.  The husband ordered the bangers and mash and I got the cornish pastie.  The husband mentioned that he had to add a lot of salt to his gravy, but he seemed to enjoy his meal.  Me on the other hand, not so much.  My gigantic pile of peas that kept rolling of my plate were cold and had a few hairs in them.  They definitely weren't mine, I checked.  The pastie was delicious, and I really liked it, but the accompanying mashed potatoes were too thick and lumpy to be any good.\n\nThis place just isn't good enough.  Hair in food is just plain gross.  Mediocre food combined with rude service is not going to get me to come back.

We went one weekend for the Sunday Roast.  It was a generous plate of veggies, mash and a massive yorkshire pud.  But the beef wasn't roast anything... more like steak-ums.  The gravy was from a can/jar.   Now some might say this is trivial, but a good Sunday Roast Beef meal to the English is like a Thanksgiving dinner in the US.  You can't serve shaved turkey from a frozen bag and surround it with good sides... the main dish needs to be lovingly prepared.\n\nOn another night, the Scotch eggs followed the same theme.  A great idea.  The dish was served with a wide range of extras, but the core food was odd.  Not bad, but the casing was an inch thick and dry.\n\nI'd love to see this place work.  They offer a menu of what should be made, but just don't quite deliver a good food product.  To be fair, the market might not support it and are happy with ho hum stuff, but on the flip side I've enjoyed much more inspired fare in CA - not just the U.K.", "business_id": "3xEB9FyFXolq1b_Qn_BFtg", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-05-15", "type": "review"}

I know it's market price & all but that still sucked. I should have asked the price before ordering.\n\nThe fish & chips were really good though. I could barely finish the 2 thick pieces of fish on my plate. They were perfectly crispy with just the right amount of batter. Chips could have been crispier though.\n\nI LOVE THE COLESLAW! I can't say that enough. It wasn't sweet (yuck!) like other coleslaws I've tried. It was crisp & peppery. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. Hmmm\n\nWhen you order a shot I think you get more liqueur than just a shot because of their glasses. They're wide & the bartender wasn't measuring, she just eye balled it.

I like the place.  The trivia host is entertaining and the place feels worn in, but not worn down.  I feel comfortable and welcome every time I visit.  Most weeks I end up ordering a couple beers from the rather large selection.  The drink prices, while high for some people's tastes, are comparable to what I've seen in other places.  Imports are going to cost more, it's the price you pay to have a selection of Boddington's, Murphy's and Guinness all in one place, among other things.\n\nNormally on trivia nights I don't end up getting food, as although I find their portions proportional to the prices, I don't feel I need to eat half my weight in fish and chips in one sitting.  I have no qualms with the quality on the few occasions I've grabbed some eats, for example the curry chicken is very flavorful and highly recommended.  The dragon wings are another of my favorite, spicy but not overwhelming.  The fish and chips, as previously mentioned, are served on a giant platter and have generally been excellent.\n\nI recommend at least one visit to this bar.  Don't be scared off by the divey look of the pub-front.  The F.C. scarves adorning the ceiling, British booze advertisements on the walls, and the cozy but not claustrophobic seating arrangements make it a unique place in the middle of the desert.

Unfortunately it was a huge let down. The first bad sign was that upon walking in every table table that wasn't occupied had not been cleared from the previous diners. During the 1 1/2 hrs (!!!) that we were here there were several tables that NEVER got cleared. It took 20 minutes to get our drinks and another 45+ minutes until we received our food which was strange as no one else in the restaurant seemed to be ordering any food. There was a hair in the fish and chips (disgusting but mistakes happen), and the rest of the food was sub par at best. \n\nHaving lived half my life in England  I've been to plenty of pubs and also eaten plenty of mediocre pub food (none to my recollection as tasteless as this). However I would imagine that if you're trying to emulate a British Pub across the pond you would only want to bring over the best of the best, not the worst of the worst. Even the sad little mini frozen sausage rolls I had as a child were better. I'm a bit horrified that this is the \"taste of England\" that is being imposed on unsuspecting Arizonians who don't know any better. \n\nI guess if you're just looking to knock back a pint or two and play pool and would only ever order food under the most drunk and dire of circumstances then you may enjoy this version of a pub. There certainly were a lot of regulars (not ordering food...). \n\nP.S. I don't know if that greasy little man was a busser or a patron. If he was a patron he had no business going into the kitchen as many times as he did, or eating on the floor. If he was a busser then it would have been nice to see him clear more than one table he did. And I most certainly hope it was not his stringy long hair that we found in the fish and chips, although I wouldn't be surprised.", "business_id": "3xEB9FyFXolq1b_Qn_BFtg", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-05-01", "type": "review"}

Had a beer and the Shepard's Pie as described on the menu.  On the menu the shepherds pie was listed at $10.99 along with a full description: marinated  lean ground beef, mashed potatoes, Sharp cheddar and gravy on request. Pretty simple one would think.   When the bill came I noticed that the shepherds pie was charged at $12. So I asked the waitress. Her response was \"well you ordered cheese and gravy and that's a dollar extra\".  I asked to see the menu again and pointed out that on the menu it's shows that this is part of the dish and says nothing about cheese and gravy being extra. In essence it was part of the meal.  She wouldn't budge I asked to see the manager.  After about 10 minutes of hearing \"we can't find the manager\" or \"the managers not here.\"  A guy comes up and says \"can I help you?\"  I explain the entire situation one more time.   He pulls the menu out, reads it, and then states \"no cheese and gravy or extra it says it right here.\" I asked him to please show me where on the menu it said it.  He looks at it again thinking, furling his eyebrow and says well !I guess I can see how somebody would get that confused.\"  Clearly the menu did not state that. Unlike the cheeseburger where it clearly states cheese extra onions are extra. I commented that his menu was misleading and he's taking advantage of people.

Rickie and I had spent and exhausting day (and a quick $200) at Target and were thinking steaks. The budget didn't include Morton's or Ruth's Chris. I had brain freeze and forgot the local spots I love so much that grill a mean meat (i.e. Phoenix City Grill), so the first restaurant past Target that fit the bill was our local Applebee's on Camelback and Central. Mind you, I don't expect a decor marvel or a hostess so hip it hurts. I know what i'm getting myself into. For the most part. But I had recently seen a TV commercial from Applebee's and of course the food was airbrushed so perfectly like Celine Dion's face on the current issue of HELLO magazine. I mean, really, Celine, you have no wrinkles even after living in Las Vegas these past couple of years? Anyhoo, we were greeted and seeted promptly by a teenager who definitley just had a smoke and could use a visit to the tanning booth. Once seated, our server, Mo, took our drink and appetizer order and quickly disappeared. For quite awhile. Cue the Jeoporady theme music. Once our iced teas and the new appetizer (tuscan cheese bread extravangza) arrived we sipped and dipped. Not bad.Raspberry tea with an univited yet delighted visit by vanilla and the cheese spread was rich and yummy served with a spot of diced tomato, basi and garlic...aka bruscetta. NICE. We ordered onion chips, like an onion loaf or the blooming onion at Outback....they were good. Two sauces for our dipping pleasure...one your typical ranch, the other a sort of spiced up thousand island with horseradish. Then the entrees arrived. Cue the creepy dum, dum, dum, music...Both NY strip steaks over cooked to such an extreme. The asparagus was limp like, well, let's just say it reminded me of a Vietmanese gymnast I once dated who didn't take the little blue pill. Sides included mashed potatoes (loaded) which means bacon, cheese and sour cream. Ok, Ok, Ok, too much of the extras. What ladle in the kitchen did they pick to put these extras on my mashed potatoes? All in all, I had low expectations at this venue, and they were met. Shout out to Mo the server, a good gal! The clientele was like a scene out of Dawn of the Dead. Sorry. Lesson learned...Applebee's ok some of the time. Get an app and a drink. Skip the entrees. Be nice to a nice server.

I did try a sample of the vanilla porter which was more chocolate and cr\u00e8me than vanilla but I could see it going really well with some cake or brownies after dinner.\n\nHowever, I was here for a late lunch/early dinner so I opted for the turkey sandwich with their mac n' ale cheese side. The sandwich was a lot smaller than I was expecting for the price ($8.50 for a small sandwich and side). The turkey and spinach leaves were really fresh and the roll was lightly toasted and not dry, but the cranberry mayo didn't have a very strong flavour. It would have been better with actual whole cranberry sauce and then mayo separate. The sandwich was good but I was very disappointed with the size. The mac n' cheese was very good and cheesy but it wasn't very noteworthy - it was basically high quality Velveeta cheese a slight beer-esque tang to it, topped with parmigiana. I tried a bit of my friend's parmigiana fries and those were decent but, again, nothing special - just fries with parmigiana on top. \nService was fast (though the place was pretty empty) and friendly. They also had a few different ciders in bottles available which I wasn't expecting (I'm a HUGE cider fan), so that was a nice plus.\n\nMain point: I like going to breweries because they usually incorporate beer into a lot of their dishes. SunUp's beer-battered shrimp (again, what the friend ordered) and ale-infused cheese is an example but where are the beer-battered fries or soft beer bread or other delicacies you can find on Four Peaks' (for example) menu? What do you have on offer to draw in non-beer drinkers to your establishment? I think it's an important question when a brewery decides to also be a restaurant and one I'm not sure SunUp really thought about.\n\nI would come here again to sample more of the beer and for dessert or a Happy Hour-priced appetizer but not for lunch or dinner again.", "business_id": "3UMcsN9IjoeV8JZvC4apag", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-04-09", "type": "review"}

There are transvestites, some businessmen, some crackheads, and some really fun and hilarious people. You never know what you are going to get! There is a large bar, some really old tables with stools, a jukebox, digital bar game, a dartboard, pool, etc. This bar actually has 2 sides, but unless it's a weekend or a drag show night, you only get to see one side. The other side has some creepy clown-like decorations and a stage, as well as another bar. They have karaoke sometimes, too and I highly recommend this. It's a HOOT! There is also a pole in the center. ;) \nThe service is usually really good (Gary and \"mother\" are a lot of fun) and the drinks averagely priced. Sometimes I'm a little scared of the glass cleanliness. The bathrooms are horrendous.

The restaurant itself had a bit of an odor to it near the front, but it was nice enough inside. Our table was next to a baby grand where someone was layin out some decent lounge. It provided an interesting atmosphere.\n\nThe food... they had a lot of specials and it was really too much to keep track of - I come to find out they are 8 - 15 bucks more than a regular menu item anyway, so I abandoned that idea. I ended up with Fettuccine Alfredo with Chicken. The bread they gave us was good. \n\nFor our first course, they brought out some potato soup for every one - including me, even though I said I wouldn't eat it... kinda wasteful when some of their dishes \"go to feed the homeless\" (whatever that means). \n\nThey brought out a salad as well - I ordered a Caesar which carried an up-charge from the standard house salad of 3.50. The Caesar was drowning in dressing and all the salads just seemed plopped on the plate after being slathered in heavy dressing. At these prices with courses and such, I kinda expect a little more attention to be paid to presentation. As I said though, we were a large group and they were very good about getting our food out in a timely fashion.\n\nOur entrees were also drowning in sauce. My Alfredo was tasty and the chicken was really good, but the noodles were a little chopped up and difficult to fork up and it was a little too rich and heavy for me. I still feel kinda greasy.\n\nI think this place would earn 4 stars if the prices were more reasonable. We paid 85 bucks between two of us and that included a bottle of wine for 24 bucks (their cheapest red - which I had before elsewhere and was actually very good). I think this is a good place, but I think it sees itself as being better than it is. In some ways, it lives up to these self-imposed expectations and in other ways it doesn't.

(I have been told in the past that my taste in wine can be better)   Sarah G and I shared the Calamari...which I thought was very full of flavor and cook just right.

Of course by the time I got my main course, I was full.

Once our order was placed the rush seemed to be on.  Soup appeared. Then salad. But before I had even finished my salad my Chilean sea bass was in front of me.  I wished I had known the 2 small rectangles of fish were going to be swimming in tomatoes.  I should have asked more questions. The flavor of the sea bass was lost in the tomatoes.  My husband was delighted at what his chicken turned out to be.  We shared a complimentary birthday dessert and left.  There was no one at the  door as we left to thank us or say good bye.  Yes the prices are very reasonable but the food and ambiance are nothing special.", "business_id": "3CSaqRNvYg7ZdN2zwxwzVw", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-05-03", "type": "review"}

We have gone back a few times since that night but if Drew isn't there then we are prepared to walk right back out and go to another place. \n\nI don't know if she is related to the owner or is sleeping with one of them or has a blackmail thing going on but I can't figure out why she still has her job there!!!! \n\nAgain..... Ask for Drew!!!!!!", "business_id": "_GS1R0LTwr6h8rMWY_8U9Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-05-16", "type": "review"}

I can tell you that this place can't be beat in the fun for value dept.  I mean where else can you get $4 Absolut and tonics - plus free (oftentimes campy and klassy) entertainment.  The crowd, the singing skills and the singing tastes here run the gamut, and that's part of the appeal.  \n\nThe crowd is mostly gay men in their 30s and 40s, but goes older and younger.  Lesbians also hold court here as well.  I mean, who else will do the honors to sing Pat Benatar and Melissa Etheridge?  Many gay men will bring their straight girlfriends, most likely so they will have someone to sing the Grease duet with.  And believe it or not, a handful of straight men will be dragged here.  But not to fear.  The crowd is very friendly and welcoming and the bartenders and owners take care of the people here.\n\nAs for what kind of music to expect, some people are completely hammered and singing in public for the very first time, while others are serious and more seasoned - some with classical training via the Phoenix Men's Choir.    And a few of these guys would make American Idol drool with desire. \n\nThe song list is large and respectable (but think George and Dragon has a better list - see my review...).  The songs run the spectrum from Liza Minelli Cabaret, to Tim McGraw, to hip-hop rap, to 80s alt rock, to U2, AC/DC, Elton John, Stevie Wonder, and Frank Sinatra.\n\nThis place is totally small and divey -and a bit weathered looking when you speed past it on 7th St.  Useless trivia alert.  For any Phoenix architectural history buffs out there, this bar is identical to Chez Nous (without the booths, and not as DARK) as both buildings were built by the same man. \n\nKaraoke runs from Thursday night through Saturday night.

I had the cheeseburger and it was one of the best hamburgers I had ever had.

She was cooking, bartending, handling money, scratching her head, shaking hands, cleaning bar tops, running dishes, etc.... did I mention she did not wash her hands once during this whole time? We ate our dinners, disgustedly, thinking how an inspector would shut the place down immediately if they saw it. She was entertaining, all over the place, yelling, throwing things, etc. I'm pretty nieve, and didn't know until my buddy told me that she was on meth at that time. So there we have it, a restaurant I thought would be a new favorite with a methead bartender that doesn't observe any food safety laws or regulations.\n\nI'll be getting my hepititis c test next week.

First off, I like Harvey's.  Do I go to Harvey's all the time?  Nope.  But I enjoy the burgers and the simplicity of the place.  I have probably been there 15 times over the past 3 years, so this is a culmination of all of those meals.\n\nEveryone talks about the decor (or lack thereof).  The inside of the place is DARK (especially when compared to most places in Phoenix).  When you leave the place during the day, make sure you have sunglasses.  After your eyes spend so much time adjusting to the lack of lighting, the sun feels like inmates coming out of solitary confinement for a month.  While the decor gets 0 stars from the Zagat type crowd, I find some sort of enjoyment with how beat down it is.  In fact, if they spruced it up, I probably wouldn't like it as much.  It is a true dive bar.\n\nThe service isn't great, but it isn't what I would call bad.  It isn't like they screw everything up, but it is a bit slow.  If you are in a hurry to eat (like most Americans on lunch hour), then maybe you should go to McDonald's across the street.\n\nFinally, the burgers.  They are great.  Quality meat, good cheese, and plenty of char.  I never found the food unsanitary, but I have also been to Brazil, so the food here is always more sanitary.  I am not a fan of the fries (got to Delux, Gordon Biersch, or Cafe Bink if you want truly great fries), but the onion rings are good (not as good as Ted's Hot Dogs, though).  I love the fact that they have RC Cola.  I have only had drinks there 1 time.  They make them stiff, and will impair your judgement quickly if you aren't careful.  They have a heavier hand in pouring than most college bars.\n\nOverall, I recommend it if you like dingy bars and a good burger.  Sure, there are better burgers in town, but this is pretty unique.  A little more seasoning could be used, but it isn't bad the way it is.", "business_id": "ntJAKLAq0cXzzdFgPoo0Iw", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-03-27", "type": "review"}

The well liquor is rather bad, so I guess that makes the happy hour prices fair $2.50 for well drinks & $2 for beer. \n\nThey serve food but I didn't try anything. Overheard they were having some cooler problems so I decided to pass. Most of what is on the menu will set you back about $8 bucks. But I saw that their burgers are hand formed not the frozen pressed blocks of beef so they might be as good as some people report.\n\nThey have really nice TVs and a few of them if you wish to watch something. \n\nBut even though I want to like the place for being a dive bar steps from Camelback Road and holding on, truth is I have been to better dive bars with better menus and well drinks.

The sandwich is still a little smaller than the old days, but the burger is clearly hand made and absolutely delicious.  We are still debating whether you can taste the wine in the wine burger, that might require another visit or two.  They now offer a reasonably-priced lunch 'combo' that gives you great French fries (or their fabulous onion rings) with your burger in just enough quantity that you can finish them.  The table service is quick and as friendly as always. I will now put Harvey's back on my list of favorite (under $8) burger places in Phoenix.

The waitress was there as I was sitting down. \nInterestingly, Mark had gotten a big ol' glass of red wine to start lunch...a delightful way of lunching for business people that has fallen into disrepute over the past decade or so. I followed suit.\nWe must fight this non-drinking at lunch scourge by taking every opportunity to imbibe at lunch, and I, for one, will help lead the fight!\nThe menu hasn't changed very much over the past few years, but really, why screw around with what is working...the place is always full, everybody seems to enjoy their meals, including me BTW:), and they just go on printing money, year after year! What's not to like about that formula?\nThey had some nice specials (including a bunch of seafood specials), but frankly, I rarely eat seafood at non-seafood specialty restaurants in the middle of the desert. I opted for the Cuban Hamburger. \nA novel preparation, one that was highlighted by some of the tastiest pickles I have ever had on a burger! I actually do taste the food as I hoover it down:)\nPCG is still doing great and doesn't need anything more from me than my credit card for payment when the check comes...keep up the good work!", "business_id": "Pfb6VOIiroqDWOebfgWGPQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-04-24", "type": "review"}

I think a restaurant experience should match its rating caliber and sadly it did not. No four stars for fabulousness, it's three stars because it's ok and that's not shabby at all.\n\nWent to dinner with the other half of our awesome pair... my besty Sara V. on a whim. We've been thinking alike lately... and while I was at work... I kept on thinking that it would be nice to go out to dinner... and unsurprisingly Sara V. was thinking the same too... I swear it's like we have ESPN or something! Anywho, I had her come up with the dinner choices since she knows I'm a really picky person (I say I'm not but I really am =P), she texted me the top 3... and I chose PCG since I had read Jana S. earlier review on the place and I've always wanted to try out this place!\n\nAnywho, we got to the restaurant and I really like the intersection it's at, at Bethany Home Rd. and 16th St. coz it's across from Luci's Market and Richardson's, and an awesome looking Starbucks. In a strange way that intersection has a little character plus it's in an older section of upper central Phoenix. I like the setup with the tables outside and the large picture windows. \n\nWe were seated immediately at a two seater booth, noticed it was quite busy, and i liked the general ambiance of the place. We were thinking of the happy hour when we were heading there but were dismayed to read on their large easel board that hh tues. - fri. was from 3p to 6p but on Monday's it's from 3p to close. So we made a mental note that we'll come back for hh on Monday. We were seated and waited for our server, waters were dropped off, and our server passed with a passing remark \"I'll be right back\". Well she did come back after 10 mins. which I ordered a glass of reisling, and an order of the Roasted Green Chile Fundido Queso (ever since our trip in Austin for SXSW last year, we've been looking for a place that serves Queso as to satisfy our Queso fix from TX of which we have yet to find a place, maybe it's a Texas thing). My glass with a small carafe of wine was served... wet. The wine glass was wet! Like it had been just washed and they didn't take the time to dry the glass, no they served the glass WET and our server poured some of the reisling into the WET wine glass. Ok... there went a star. who serves wine in a wet glass?!? apparently PCG does. So, we're waiting to order, mind you, our server did not stop to give suggestions, mention the soup of the day, no we waited, and we had to ask for suggestions, and ask what the soup of the day was. Heck if you're a good restaurant, wouldn't you want to welcome your customers, who if you win them with good service and good food will come back, or are you happily satisfied with the customers and your fans that you're not interested in winning a few more? Ok... deep breath. \n\nI ordered the PCG pasta as suggested by our server, and Sara V. ordered the Smoked Baby Back Ribs (rubbed in Chipotle bbq sauce). Oh did I mention that I had to ask for Sara V.'s water refill the first time round and flag her down to get a diet coke. Sara and I could see the poor girl was handling way too many tables to guarantee good service but that's no excuse. I think there's an expectation that a restaurant of such acclaim should provide great service. \n\nThe PCG pasta was quite good, liked the roasted garlic and chardonnay cream sauce, it wasn't overly creamy, loved the sun dried tomatoes though, it was delicious. Sara V.'s baby back ribs had a kick with them, it was spicy! and the green chile cornbread was okay not bandera's skillet corn bread good though. Oh, the queso was alright as well except i wish it was a little more thicker, this queso seemed too runny but it was a good starter nevertheless. We finished our meal with a slice of the buttermilk pie which had a caramel sauce and pomegranate seeds as garnish, which was the right accompaniment to something rich and sweet. \n\nOverall the food was very good but the service had me wishing it was better and it did affect my overall dining experience. I will come back for the happy hour but I will have to pass on a glass of wine... unless they can guarantee it'll be served in a dry wine glass. And maybe some attentive service. So hopefully next time I'll get my four stars, we'll see.", "business_id": "Pfb6VOIiroqDWOebfgWGPQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-03-18", "type": "review"}

But I have to say, it seems to grow on me every time I eat there. The most recent trip was for Mother's Day brunch. After looking at various Phoenix eateries' menus to decide where to take my mom, I knew the Grille was it. Their brunch menu is quite a few steps above and for the prices, a great culinary investment. I had the griddled corn cakes (mmmm....) and you get a choice of meat. So I had diced smoked ham hidden in between them. It came with black beans and cheese, potatoes and maple syrup. Mom had short rib with a poached, breaded egg on top and a tangy red onion relish. The egg was a gem and the breading wasn't incredibly greasy. To top it off, they were giving moms a carnation flower. Nice touch. As for dinner, I highly recommend the pot roast. And I don't know anywhere else that serves up their quinoa and goat cheese cakes (what a yummy combo). And they do try to buy locally when they can. It's a great restaurant in a location that's never too packed with traffic. And the staff has always been courteous. It's really becoming one of my favorite go-to places.

My parents just moved back to Scottsdale after living in Houston for 2 years, and on our way home we realized we were starving, so my mom remembered the PCG and suggested we try it again after at least 5 years not having been there. It's a little off the beaten path (although easily accessible from the 51), but I have to say that it was one of the best meals we'd had out in AGES!!!! I live downtown Chicago, where the culinary/dining scene is truly one of the best in the US, and the quality and presentation of the food here really impressed me. Just a fantastic place.\n\nMy mom and I decided to try a bunch of appetizers, and my dad had the pork tenderloin.  We had the fish tacos, the bacon-wrapped shrimp, the griddled corn cakes, and the crab cakes.  I cannot tell you how fantastic each and every one of these appetizers was!!! The fish tacos were the best we'd EVER had--and we're a major fish taco-eating family! Fresh grilled fish with a chipotle-lime aioli and pickled red onions--just fantastic. The bacon-wrapped shrimp were HUGE! I don't know where they get these shrimp, but they're incredible, and stuffed with cotija cheese. Yes, a little rich, but absolutely delicious.  The griddled corn cakes--incredible! They totally balance that sweet-salty thing that everyone loves, and the corn cakes were soft, fluffy, and surprisingly very light.  Then the crabcakes. We're originally from Maryland so we're VERY picky about our crabcakes--and we were shocked to discover they actually did them correctly!! Fresh, lump crabmeat (not shredded!) and very little filling, served with an incredible lemon aioli sauce and a little salad. Just amazing!\n\nMy dad had the pork tenderloin, and he's a bit of a picky eater and left not a single scrap on his plate! I love how the waiter asked him how he wanted it prepared (yes, you can have pork tenderloin done medium), and it was served with jalapeno preserves, these incredible mashed potatoes, and roasted root vegetables. My dad cleaned his entire plate and loved every bite.  \n\nOn top of it all (yes, we were stuffed!), we decided to split a dessert--the bread pudding, which was absolutely DELICIOUS. Not overly sweet or rich, and nicely presented. Excellent coffee, too.\n\nI was so pleasantly surprised by how great the Phoenix City Grille was that I just HAD to put a review on Yelp (and this is my first!).  Our server was excellent, and I don't have a bad thing to say about this place.  I wish it were in Chicago!

A month ago, I took out-of-town guests for Sunday brunch. Part of the reason I chose City Grille was because they had a promotion where you could get a free appetizer for checking in on a Smart phone. All you had to do was show your server. Well, my server, no matter how nicely I approached the matter, kept insisting that deal was only for people who brought a print-out of an email--even after I showed her on my phone what their own restaurant's Facebook page stated! She just shrugged and said \"Well nobody explained it to me.\" I don't fault her if nobody told her. But I do fault her for not even bothering to say anything like, \"I don't know anything about that but let me go check with a manager\" after I showed proof. It wasn't even the appetizer but the principle of the matter.\n\nI left a comment on the restaurant's Facebook page--very diplomatic, not with any self-entitled overtones. Their social media person asked me to email him directly outlining what happened. Less than two days later, he wrote me, with the owner copied in, apologizing and offering to send me a gift certificate for dinner for two! \n\nThis update is not to say \"Woohoo! I got a free meal.\" It's just an appreciation for when a restaurant is willing to own up to a mistake and try to make up for it. It also sounds like because of me, they will remember to make sure all servers are aware of promotions like that. And when I did go back for my free meal, that same server was there, lol.

We arrived around 8:30pm and the place seemed pretty busy with an older crowd. I think we were probably the youngest people in there. Old people know where good food is :) The patio seating might get a bit old with people walking in-between tables so we opted for something inside.\n\nThe atmosphere was dark but yet inviting. We were greeted by a smiling hostest and seated as soon as we walked in. Our waitress came around quickly and gave us water and we had just the right amount of time to decide we would try the Crispy Eggplant bites for an appetizer and Baby Back ribs for me with a twice baked potato rather than fries and my bf's Grilled Pork Tenderloin. \n\nHaving never had fried eggplant I envisioned almost chip like wedges of eggplant but these were more like patties. And OMG were they good! There were only 3 and we definitely fought over the last one and savored every bite!\n\nI'm not usually a girl who orders ribs but these were definitely good. The sauce was unique, a little smokey but not too much but they had really good flavor. The coleslaw was really good, reminded me of KFC with a small punch of ginger and the twice baked potato put a smile on my face. Totally not on the diet but I didn't care. My bf was really happy with his pork tenderloin and the small piece I had was really good. He continued to comment throughout the meal how good it was so I know he liked it a lot.\n\nTo further ruin my diet, we ordered the warm chocolate torte. It was good but one of those really strong, flour-less bunt cakes and they usually aren't my favorite.\n\nOverall, between the atmosphere, food and service, this is definitely a place we will come back to!", "business_id": "Pfb6VOIiroqDWOebfgWGPQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-04-24", "type": "review"}

Being tucked away in newer buildings behind a starbucks, with kind of a goofy name for a lunch market, I was pretty sure this place was going to be a big disappointment.  WRONG (yay)\n\nThough a confusing layout/way of doing things, the small but impressive market of cheeses, meats, pastas, beverages, teas, coffees, sauces and little do-dads is cute cozy and inviting.  The wine room is small but good and fairly well stocked with a good variety of wines, though a measly wine by the glass selection for a fairly impressive cellar.  \n\nWorkers were a little awkward at times but really helpful in making selections.  We opted for a sandwich and a cheese platter for two, accompanied by a bottle of Reisling.  The sandwich was really good and fresh, the sun dried tomatoes were awesome - though as a sandwich in whole i've had better.  The make your own cheese platter was AWESOME-you get to choose as many cheeses as you'd like, getting the chance to look through them and read descriptions and touch, great for someone like me who loves a good cheese but knows nilch about names and pairings.  It was fresh, BIG, and simple-A in my book. \n\nThe owners son was friendly and knowledgeable, helping us select the right bottle of wine to go with our cheeses, a not easy task being I like sweeter whites while he likes dry crisp ones.  Though not the best wine i've had, we got a very good bottle for 15 bucks that was enjoyable. \n\nAs far as seating goes they have multiple areas inside and out, we very much enjoyed the front outdoor patio with sun covers, live music, grass, and the dog and children friendly atmosphere. \n\nOnly downsides I'd have to say would be the confusing layout with lack of direction, and the sometimes \"airy\" staff behind the counters.

I believe the best reviews of this restaurant probably have taken full advantage of the customizable menu options. It does boost the price of the average sandwich up though. I almost always get pine nuts and pepperoncinis in addition to the standard options and the sandwich ends up being 9 dollars or so.

An outdoor patio, tables next to the wines and bar area, tables at the east end of the lower floor and upstairs which are accessed via staircase at the east side of the sandwich/grocery area.\n\nThere is a great selection of deli meats and cheeses at the west end of the sandwich counter.

Before my husband and I set out on our groupon redeeming adventure all over Phoenix, we decided to stop in here for lunch. This is the first time I have been in here to eat since becoming vegetarian almost a year and a half ago, and before then we used to come in all of the time. At least once a month to get some sandwiches while we were out shopping in this part of town. Today I decided would be a good day to check this place back out, as I was craving sandwiches anyways. We must have come in at an off time because it wasn't very crowded. But then again, most people don't eat lunch at 3pm. There was a musician playing out on the patio for a few guests.\n\nWe walked in and my husband and I both decided on the Where's the beef? sandwich, which was lettuce, tomato, avocado, jicama, celery, sprouts, cucumber, swiss cheese, mayo and mustard. I got mine on an onion roll and my husband decided on whole wheat. We paroozed the store while we were waiting for our sandwiches and we also purchased a large bottle of water and chips. There is also a little section inside where you can purchase teas, coffees, jams, spices, oils, kitchen tools, among other items. I can't say that I have ever bought any of these items but some of them are pretty interesting. Today I saw boxed potatoes. I don't know why but I thought it was the strangest thing ever. \n\nAnyways. So our sandwiches are ready and we pay and we sat upstairs overlooking the rest of the store. I dig into my sandwich and I really love it. I'm a sandwich slut anyways so its easy to make me happy, but there were a ton of veggies. I didn't feel like I was gipped at all. Most sandwich places will give you the flattest sandwich possible. But this one was large and in charge. I got full half way through and still ate the whole thing because of how good it tasted. I think the value for a sandwich like this is just about the same as every other sandwich shop I have had that has a vegetarian option. It was $7, which is about average. So I don't feel like I was robbed or anything. We will definitely be back soon!", "business_id": "HIiVx2mseVWKtx8TKfWC_A", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-04-30", "type": "review"}

I'm a fan of the \"Where's the Beef?,\" a vegetarian sandwich, aptly named because when you bite into it, you don't give a damn where the beef is because your mouth is full of avocado, tomato, pine nuts, and other tasty things.\n\nTheir ladies' room has one of those weird towel machines in it.  You know, where you roll out a clean section of towel to wipe your hands?  Not paper towels, real towel.  I've never seen one anywhere else.\n\nThe area near the kitchen is filled with all sorts of weird luxury kitchen stuff; spices and dishes and expensive decorations, and other crappy junk that no one needs.  I can't decide whether it annoys me or keeps me entertained while I'm waiting for my sandwich.\n\nAt any rate, you'll get a tasty sandwich and the upstairs area is a nice quiet place to talk with your friends during a meal.

I'm so glad I finally ventured in. It's adorable!  \n\nWith copious amounts of places to sit (inside and out) it's perfect for a leisurely bite. My adventure was during a Friday happy hour. (M-F, 5-7pm. $3 drafts! $3 house wine!) Arriving early to secure an outdoor patio spot we meandered thru the space. There's live music on Fridays with a start time of ~ 6pm. \n\nTHE BASICS\nCooking accessories, teas, coffees, spices, a wide array of imported specialty foods line the shelves. Need some meat? They've got it. Want a sweet? Yep. In the mood for a sandwich? Si. Want some cheese? Be adventurous! They have adorable tiny wedges for a buck and change. \"Try something new without fear of commitment.\" Ha!\n\nThe wine / bar area, though petite in size, is lined floor to ceiling with wine bottles. Bob, the bartender on Fridays, is the friendliest gentlemen you could ever meet. The beer fridge is filled with a respectable number of bottles. \n\nSEATING\nThere's plenty of it. Two floors. My visit we were focused on nabbing seating outside near the live music. Turns out the music is fairly loud and you don't need to sit that close! You order your food inside and service your own tables here.\n\nFor noshing we nibbled on a patio cheese tray. I'm not entirely sure what cheese was served. Our platter included a small palmful of soft cheese, a jam spread, sliced bread and sliced apple. For the price point I'd actually have preferred a sandwich. But still tasty!\n\nWINE TASTINGS\nAt Duck & Decanter you can arrange a private wine & beer tasting for groups of 14-24 ppl. Lasting two hours in duration the sessions include the booze (duh!), cheese, printed info and a host. Sometimes they can include additional food. It depends on headcount and budget. ($20-$35 /person + gratuity + tax). This seems like a really neat thing to set up.\n\nTasting menu examples...The Beer Tasting has you traveling thru six different countries. The Business Mixer offers three red and three white wines. The Blind Tasting sounds awesome! Wine is served from a brown bag and it's up to guests to pick the grape. \n\nSo anyway, Duck & Decanter is a pretty neat experience!

The geographical positioning of the bar makes it an easily accessible and ideal destination for keeping it local and I can be in the Swizzle parking lot in just about 10 minutes door to door as long as it isn't rush hour. I should be able to tell you how long ago some fuck stick dropped a Starbucks right in the middle of the parking lot of the strip mall where the Swizzle resides and ruined the ambiance for us all and I also should be able to tell you the owners name as I've met him half a dozen times over the years and in turn be able to explain the extreme nautical theme of the place up to and including the porthole window in the door of the main entrance. I also should be able to tell you the names of the weekend bartenders who served the better half and I ever so well during out last visit and most importantly I should be able to tell you how great of a place this is to casually drink your sorrows away/into fruition.  But despite this being, on paper, the perfect formula of the dive bar Pythagorean Theorem for me I've never felt completely comfortable patronizing the Swizzle and I can tell you none of these things I have mentioned; not a single one.\n\nUntil recently I couldn't even give you a specific example of a time I had a shitty night at the Swizzle; in fact most nights I can recall doing the Swizzle Inn and Swagger Out I always had a mediocre time, or an adequate time or even a downright acceptable time drowning drinks at the half circle bar that is the main feature of the space. On a recent night the better half and I vowed to step outside of our comfort zone and meet some work friends for drinks at an hour where we normally wouldn't expect most bars to be packed to capacity. We were puzzled at the full parking lot and cast dirty looks at the Starbucks taking up valuable parking real estate and made our way to the door. When we pushed it open we were hit with a wave of sound and with an audible \"ZHANG\" we walked right into a packed house smack in the middle of Murder Mystery Night...and somebody was giving booze to these god damn animals.\n\nI immediately recoiled in horror from the leering forms before me; there were too many Hawaiian shirts and cheap plastic leis to comprehend. I counted at least half a dozen overly done fake mustaches on beings that were entirely too feminine to be men and everyone was screeching at decidable levels that caused my teeth to rattle in my skull. Packs of these fiends were caroming off of walls and each other in a drunken frenzy. Before I had time to even assess the situation two spaces opened at the bar and we quickly dove for safety.  As we sat staring slack jawed in horror at the scene around us waiting for the bartenders to meet our gaze I glanced at the time: 745PM on a Saturday night.\n\nEventually the bartenders did catch up to us and after some confusion regarding the question \"what kind of Rye do you have\" was cleared up we sipped out cocktails and stared transfixed in horror as the chaos of alcoholic Murder Mystery cascaded around us. Inevitably the revelry ended and the murder was announced, along with special categorical winners none of which I could hear over the losers braying out orders to the inundated barkeeps as they quenched their losses with mass rounds of Jaeger and Cuervo shots to go with pitcher after pitcher of Shock Top. I didn't understand the theme of the Mystery that was to be solved and remained just as puzzled as Scooby and the gang when it hit me: Zoinks! I now knew why I never had a night to remember (or to forget for the matter) visiting the Swizzle Inn. I simply didn't fit in here. I had more in common with the grim faced line of old timey regulars that protected the back part of the bar with a grizzled and professional determination than I did with the lunatics drinking cheap tequila and playing a hideously drunken version of \"Clue\".  That is to say, aside from hoping to catch a nipple slip or a panty shot from the comely bartender every time she bent over, my ability to be entertained and enthralled, even if just as an observer, by any patron on hand had been reduced to zero by having no discernible common bond with anyone in attendance. With a half-hearted sigh I gave the bartenders bodacious bod a good bye nod and adjourned with my party to a back table where we proceeded to have not a good time, not a bad time, but just a time.\n\nIt of course could have ended worse for me I suppose. After I Swizzled Inn and went to Swagger out I could have been accosted by Professor Plumb, with an empty beer bottle in the lavatory and become just another forgettable fake mustachioed and tacky Hawaiian shirt wearing victim of Murder Mystery Night at the Swizzle Inn.", "business_id": "mgllPJA6NQXlJurFWAkqQg", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-04-30", "type": "review"}

The Fingers and Fries are also great, the chicken is some of the most tender I've ever had. You can very gently pull it apart with your fingers. Absolute bliss. I think they use corn flakes or something in the batter; it's very flavorful and thick. I usually get the Fingers and Fries with a side of buffalo sauce and a side of ranch.\n\nThe Macaroni and Cheese with Buffalo Chicken is also worth stopping in for. I always have an internal battle about whether I want that or the Fingers and Fries. The waitresses are always friendly and the place isn't usually too busy. I tried branching out for the enchiladas and wasn't very impressed, but that's fine--I'll stick to what's good. \n\nI'm here pretty regularly whenever I feel like throwing my diet to the wind...which happens at least once a week because of those damn fried pickles!", "business_id": "CqhsIZ7TzCfJTrZqg5-gqQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-05-25", "type": "review"}

Okay, so they are not the same as the fried pickles at Julians in Providence.  but they are actually quite good.  We like 'em with the cajun seasoning and the buffalo sauce for dipping.

They use high quality beef when making them.  I enjoy a burger where I feel like I don't need it covered in cheese to enjoy the flavor.  I don't especially like cheese on a burger but will order it when I think a place is going to be mediocre so that it covers up the flavor.  Their burgers are served on a brioche that is not buttered (yay!).  \n\nI also enjoy their pulled pork sandwich.  \n\nFor their sides:\n\nThe steak fries are yummy here if you're feeling decadent.\n\ntheir onion rings are really, really yummy if you're feeling extra decadent.\n\ntheir salad is really good and comes with a vast assortment of unique dressings.  \n\nNow the downside.

The music is LOUD and inside it is virtually impossible to carry on a conversation unless you're yelling.  \n\nMost other times this is just a great place to come hang out, have some beers with friends with no attitudes.

Decor could use some help, and the TV's were a bit small to be a sports bar. Food was affordable, and portions were large.\n\nDrinks were as expected, nothing good or bad about it. I had Kiltlifter, my friends had sodas and iced teas.\n\nWe ordered some buffalo and honey bbq wings, as well as some calamari. First, the wings were huge, which was good because we only got about 8 for the 1lb order. But they were very well done, and the flavor was not added on post cooking, as most average establishments do. No, the flavor was baked in. \n\nThe calamari was not rubbery, but had a good snap, which means it was well cooked and of good quality. The breading wasn't overboard, and had a nice crunch to it. Very well done.\n\nFor the entrees, we had the Beef Stroganoff, the Buffalo Chicken sandwich, and I ordered the Mac and Cheese with the Buffalo chicken upgrade.\n\nFirst, my Mac and Cheese. It definitely wasn't box mac. It had a few cheeses that were  blended and mixed in with penne, and the dollar upgrade of buffalo chicken was a heapful of chicken on top. It came together very well, and tasted great. Well worth it, and the extra for Buffalo chicken. Portion size was also good.\n\nThe Beef Stroganoff was well done according to my friend, and it looked huge. Comfort foods should always be generous portions and have a nice home cooked feel to it in order to be successful. They were.\n\nAnd the Buffalo Chicken sandwich? My friend said it was the biggest one he'd ever gotten. It looked it. And he enjoyed it. So there's that. It didn't look too extravagant, but then it shouldn't be. It just looked big and tasty.\n\nSo why four stars? First, the decor was fairly outdated. It looked kind of like a neighborhood bar, but facing Camelback, and being so close to the Biltmore, I really thought they could use an upgrade. The TV's were at best 30's and the audio was low. A sports bar usually has at least a few 50's and pump out the sound for the major games. \n\nBut, all this could be why their prices are affordable (just go to Biltmore instead, and overpay for the ambiance), and their food is certainly good enough to keep people coming back.

Based on other people's reviews, I was expecting a dingy, dark dive bar. This is just not the case! I think many people simply have never been to a real dive before. The area surrounding the bar was dimly lit, but that's a good thing! It looked pretty awesome in there actually, and the pool tables were in a separate area in the back. We sat in the other separate area with booths which was brighter and gave it a quieter, more restaurant feel (even the bar area was NOT that loud).\n\nI have to agree with everyone's love of the fried pickles. Went with the original kind. I think they dip them in panko after the batter, super crunchy and delicious. I forced my roommate to try one bite with ranch dressing (he HATES pickles), but he actually couldn't seem to stop taking more bites. Pretty funny! I ordered the salmon in parchment special for $9.99. While it was good, it was not great. It tasted like the salmon I buy (and cook myself) from Costco. A little chewy on the teeth, but hey, it's 9.99! It came with green beans, broccoli and carrots which were really well prepared with garlic. I can't remember the last time I enjoyed cooked veggies so much. There was wild rice pilaf as well. Tasted like the kind I used to buy in small boxes at the store. That's not a complaint, it's good. My roommate ordered the grilled cheese and tomato soup which he liked very much.\n\nI think we were supposed to get the pickles at half price since we ordered at 6:45, but were charged full price. It didn't matter this time since we were using a Groupon and were a little short using the whole thing anyway, just something to note. Service was a little slow at times, but not enough to make us upset, we weren't in a hurry. Besides, everyone there was VERY friendly, even the servers that we only saw in passing smiled and said hello. That's pretty rare, especially in Phoenix (I'm a native, I can say it)!\n\nOverall, I would definitely come back. I like the atmosphere, people, food and prices.

Fast, attentive, very good interaction with multiple (and difficult) personalities, and knowledgeable of the product.  \n\nAs far as the food goes, the person I was with swears by their spicy chicken wings.  I'm a big boy and I enjoy having more than a little bite into a wing only to encounter bone on the next nibble, so ... pass for me.  I had the veggie burger, which I would best describe as falafel on a bun.  If you like falafel, you'll like this.  The salad dressing (blue) was weak and the salad itself nothing special.  Likewise, the iced tea was watery.  \n\nI was also surprised how warm it was in the restaurant.  Plenty of fans going, but it felt really stuffy  (ironically, when we left later, it felt cooler outside on the wrap-around patio with misters than it did inside.  \n\nMy friend took me here so we could talk about some private issues he was having.  Why he chose this place -- outside of the fact he's a wing fanatic -- is beyond me.  It is a sports bar and this was evident even at 3pm, when you would think most people would be at work.  To say the noise level was a bit loud is like saying Liberace was slightly flaming.  There were no games on, that I could see, but by the shouts and testosterone-fueled \"yeahs\" you heard every 2 minutes, you would think the Superbowl was moved to a Thursday.\n\nSo, in conclusion, while fans of this place will no doubt have many unflattering comments to throw at me -- most regarding my obvious lack of masculinity -- I can only say that this would be the place to go if you're seriously into sports bars or just can't live without their wings.\n\nAs for me, I'll take my obviously nelly self to a real place where I can enjoy my food and conversation in peace.", "business_id": "CqhsIZ7TzCfJTrZqg5-gqQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-05-08", "type": "review"}

Both plates came out within 10 minutes, which always makes me a little nervous. His was sub par; he ate about 35% of it. The veggie burger was near the quality that I've come to expect from most restaurant vegetarian options. The bread was decent, and the patty was an unaltered Boca burger. Everything was below average, except for the music, which was about average.\n\nThey played it at a decent volume (thank you), and was probably someone's itunes playlist of hits from the 90s. I'm okay with that.\n\nThey do have a decent amount of TVs (though nothing to swoon about in my opinion), however they are small and outdated. Most of the ones near us were staticy.

Sure enough, this place is the 2nd location of the NYC Merc Bar.  Since I live across the street I come here fairly regularly.  I'm usually a wine or beer drinker and my only critique would be the limited selection of draft beers and very small wine list.  To their credit, their three beer tap usually has both Stella and Guinness, two of my favorites.  Nonetheless, I still have not found a wine there that I really love.  Not many people realize that they do make some excellent cheese plates if you need to snack on something.  And the bar always has both goldfish and pretzels.

The prices are very good! We got a bottle of the of an Italian red wine $30, it was great! We each started with a salad, a Cesar and a field green salad. I loved the field greens, the dressing on it was just perfect, peppery and light! He loved his Cesar. Then we both picked the fillet for our entree; to die for. First is was cooked exactly as we asked, and practically melted in my mouth. Delish! They came with mashed potatoes and green beans. Both excellent! Couldn't have made them better!\n\nThen..... my favorite part.... dessert! We got one of each to share; Creme Brule and Flour-less Espresso Chocolate Cake. I could literally eat that Creme Brule everyday of my life and it still wouldn't be enough. Amazeballs! The cake was very tasty, but being a flour-less cake is was incredibly rich, very good though!\n\nThe service was excellent! Robert, our waiter, was perfect, right on top of everything, not too pushy, and read our table very well. Thank you Robert!\n\nWe had a spectacular time.

I generally don't give 5 stars on a first visit and I also don't generally give 5 stars to a chain restaurant, but this place really blew me away. The BF and I went here last night for Restaurant Week. We had actually just gotten our reservation because we had a res somewhere else but then had to be out til after the other place closed....lucky I guess. So anyway, we get there and there is complimentary valet (which I generally find annoying, but was nice last night because we were running late). We came into the restaurant and immediately felt welcome, everyone was very friendly. We were seated right away and our waitress, Sarah, came by to explain the menu. She was super friendly and helpful and really on top of things, so that was nice. \n\n\nOk, the food: After being seated, they bring out an assortment of warm breads with softened butter. And I mean a real assortment: cracker type bread, a roll that looks like an everything bagel, delicious onion bread, and a wheat bread with raisins or some kind of fruit in it....each bread was delicious (take that Atkins!). The BF ordered a Manhattan ($11.50) and said it was 'damn good' and he is a regular Manhattan drinker, so I gotta believe it. So start, I had the french onion soup (on Sarah's recommendation) and the BF had the field greens. The soup was SO good. I generally am not a huge fan of french onion soup because it has a weird texture, but this one was full of flavor and had a ton of cheese on it. I literally was peeling cheese off the side of the bowl and eating it (I know, not so cool in a fancy restaurant...but it was so tasty!). The field green salad was light, with a flavorful, but subtle vinaigrette. It had several types of tomatoes on it, which the BF loved. For mains I had the filet mignon and the BF had the kona sirloin. They came with a little share plate of mashed potatoes and green beans. The sirloin was delicious...it had this amazing sauce on it (don't know what it was, but it has some great caramelized onions in it) and was cooked perfectly. The filet was equally good, it was simple, but cooked to perfection, it was melt in your mouth and had the perfect steak texture (no fat, gristle, anything weird feeling). I will say, the filet was even better with a little of the sauce from the sirloin, but I understand why the serve it the way they do (steak purists and all....). The mashed potatoes were divine. They were some of the most creamy, buttery mashed potatoes I have had. I wanted to lick the plate. The green beans were also delicious, very well seasoned and served with onions....yum! Now on to dessert- We shared the creme brulee and the chocolate espresso cake. Both were amazing.... When I had my first bite of the chocolate cake it was like the most intense chocolate explosion in my mouth. The espresso just adds to the intensity. I will say this, this is a dessert to be shared...it truly is too chocolatey (and large) for one person....and I love chocolate. The creme brulee was equally amazing, it was creamy with just a hint of crunch, but the most impressive part (to me anyway) was it had blackberries on it that had no seeds. What?!?! Where do I get these blackberries? They were phenomenal! \n\nAt the end of the meal, Sarah went outside and had the valet bring our car around before we even left so we didn't have to wait....ummm, seriously awesome service. \n\nSo, overall, the meal was excellent. I probably ate about 3000 calories....sorry thighs....but if I got to choose a place to destroy my diet, this would be it. The restaurant week deal was amazing too because my steak alone was 41$, but the whole meal was 30$ on special. Insanity. I would definitely come back again.", "business_id": "QdbZyl-LWFS54u93Vjd5SA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-05-27", "type": "review"}

After my visit, why did I wait so long to try here?\n\nThey have complimentary valet, and I recommend using this service.  Parking across is $2 or free with validated ticket for up to two hours, or park so far away and walk... or just pull up by the entrance and enjoy great valet service.  When we finished dining, the server suggested to give the valet ticket to him so by the time we were outside, the car was already ready waiting and we didn't have to wait for a few mins.  Very nice service, especially when I didn't want to walk more than 10 steps with my heels.\n\nWe arrived a few mins before our reservation time. It was Saturday peak dinner and they were busy.  We found two stools in the bar area and started enjoying our drink. The bartender was very nice and offered complimentary bar nuts.  They were sweet and spicy, so yummy I thought I could get addicted to this nuts.\n\nThey had our table ready 20 mins after our original reservation time, and apologized for the delay.  They offer black or white linen cloth napkins depending on the colors of your clothes.\n\nFor the restaurant week 2015 menu, they have a choice of salad (wedge or caesar) or soup. Entree of two types of steak, fish, and can't remember the last one. Entree comes with two side dishes of mushed potato and sauteed green beans.  To finish the meal, they had three different choice of desert.\n\nWedge salad I had was very good, creamy dressing complimented lettuces and crispy bacon.  I actually became full just after finishing the salad. (Must be the bar nuts? or could be large lunch I had earlier).  I ate about 1/3 of my steak. Too bad I wasn't hungry enough to finish it. They used very good beef. I could taste a very good beef.  I asked them to put my desert to go as I couldn't even eat my steak, but I tasted my friend's desert, Cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e.  They were really good.  I ate my desert a day later, and my espresso cake was good as well.\n\nService was excellent. I mean really excellent. I can't even find one thing to complain.

Typical dark steakhouse type of ambience.  Great for business and romantic dinners.  They have a nice private room that can handle up to 40 guest.  For the presentation screen, they have a flat screen tv. \nService:  I think this was their strong point.  From the moment you walk in, the service was amazing.  There were 2-3 guys assigned to the room.  Drink orders taken and constantly refilled.  The AV guy was very helpful.  Orders were taken and food brought out in a timely fashion.  You can tell that they have dinner presentations down pat.  I requested my meal for togo and ti was packed nicely.  Only thing was that they had no togo drink cups.\nFood:  Was just ok.  I opted for the kona rubbed bone in sirloin.  I have never had a boned in sirloin (that was all that was offered) and will prob not again.

The ambiance is great, the location ideal, and the food and service are, well, ok. To be brutally honest, I've only dined at a Darden restaurant twice in the past few years, and when my experience concluded, I understood why I won't again--there are better steakhouses in the Valley that out-compete The Capital Grille.\n\nThe experience wasn't as crisp and exacting as it should be for a higher-end restaurant. With the prices and reputation The Capital Grille has garnered since first opening its doors in 1990, my minimum expectation is perfection. Anything above perfection earns my loyalty. \n\nWe waited a bit too long for our table at 8:30 on a Saturday night, and we would have enjoyed sitting on the patio, but the offer wasn't extended. The restaurant didn't appear to be too busy as there were plenty of open tables, and I doubt there were many reservations after us, so why make your guests wait? Is the need to convenience your staff more important than to convenience your patrons? Food for thought. \n\nAgain, the fifteen minute wait for our bottle of Malbec to hit the table was just unnecessary. Maybe they had to stomp some grapes in the back. Maybe there's a lack of urgency. Whatever it is, it detracts from the experience. \n\nThe bone-in sirloin left much to be desired. Though cooked properly, the lack of seasoning and flavor were disappointing. Why I ordered a sirloin, I do not know. I think my mind saw 'bone-in' and equivocated it with a rib-eye. I had a couple bites of my girlfriend's filet, which was excellent. \n\nIn conclusion, if you have money for the finer things in life, go with the finest.

Mirrored ceilings, velvet upholstered chairs, cheetah print fabric -- it was like I was in the 80's or in the movie \"Scarface.\"  The place was pretty quiet and the atmosphere would be good for maybe a birthday or a graduation dinner. \n\nI came here with some clients for dinner (on a weeknight) while we were in Phoenix.  There were 2 or 3 other tables here that night; not very busy.   \n\nThe menu had a good selection of various Italian dishes: pastas, seafood, chicken, veal, pork, etc. \n\nFor starters, we all shared the Calamari (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#KrxhHm5bvPqPTmXfpO2rjA) and the Escargot De Bourhohne (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#_lPAyaWEzQ9QK92_i6trfA).  The Calamari was delicious!  The batter was light and crisp, and the squid was pretty tender.  The Escargot was cooked in garlic butter and brandy wine, which gave it some nice flavors.  It was a little chewy, but it pretty much tasted like a clam. \n\nWe all shared a bottle of the 2010 Markham Merlot (Napa Valley) -- this had a nutty, vanilla, woodsy flavor.  We all ordered seafood so it paired nicely with our dishes.  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#ofGN_r7-hk5EeZkx8W0h1g)\n\nFor my main dish, I went with one of the specials offered that night, the Squid Ink Ciopinno (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#RCrj3Z_O7IyIUIVA6r5bTg).  This seemed more like a pasta rather than a ciopinno in my opinion.  What I love the most about ciopinno is that savory, rich, seafood broth.  This one didn't have any broth, it was more like a tomato sauce.  Although this dish did include a generous amount of seafood (mussels, shrimp, scallop), it didn't taste very fresh and had a rubbery texture. \n\nA few people at my table ordered the Dover Sole special that was available that night  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#9eQoEjUq1Ayiw6iKw4H5dg_.  This fish was fried whole, and then your server removes the fillet from the head/tail right before he served you.  Someone else ordered the Dover Sole dish that was available on the dinner menu (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#RFHGeb_vykwNYJeIQv_fDA).  She did not seem to enjoy this very much.  I had a taste of it and it had a murky/mushy taste and texture to it.  The sauce was very buttery-- I prefer the fried Dover over this one.\n\nDessert was okayyy.  I ordered the Spumoni  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#RlDB83kUQaeOOU-6EItG8A).  It looks like a vanilla turd, lol.  The texture of the ice cream tasted like those ice cream cups you'd get in elementary school-- icee, not creamy, and dirzzled with some Hershey's chocolate syrup.. what a disappointment.  The sorbet was a lot better than the Spumoni and was a refreshing palate cleanser (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#3go2OFhMl_zK2GETMSYJjg).  The Tiramisu (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#pOWH0I8A7J4-UFByf4FR_A) was average.. not great and not bad. \n\nIn my opinion, the prices here are super steep, especially for most of the dishes we orderded.  Service-wise, we were welcomed upon entrance and our server was very attentive... but only in the beginning of the meal.

My wife is a kind, polite woman. Maybe he thought they were actually the bomb because of the line, but there were very few food vendors. She refused to order anything else and we watched him treat others with a similar curt, obnoxious manner. He doled out tiny servings of other dishes as we watched, and for $8\n\n I'm so glad I ordered sausage and peppers from another vendor. because it was delicious and when I tried the Avanti gnocchi that a friend ordered it was terrible. It was like it came out of a can.  Mushy and in a gooey tasteless white sauce. I understand that it was pre-made but I'd never go to the restaurant after that food and attitude. Off topic, the Italian Fest was awesome. Great entertainment and well attended.

So when men want to sit here and criticize my review by saying I was a \"drunk\" that is far from what I am EVER.\n\nThe ambiance of this place is nothing amazing with its outdated decor going on.  The waiters are all men and have been with the establishment for years on end besides the waiter we had which he says he was there for 7 months and said he was waiting tables for over 20 years (so he says) I found that hard to believe for some reason since the whole time we were there he not once brought out my coffee.  Also when I had ordered risotto my step-dad had told my sister and I that if we didn't want to eat now (because we were just eating over at chase field for the dodgers and dbacks game) that we could save the food for later which was WHY i ordered food in the first place. I had no intention to order to be perfectly honest.  I am kind of wishing I NEVER ordered anything at all the way all of the waiters and chef came out to basically yell at me for not touching my food. I really wish i was so  sick that i would have thrown up all over the place the way they were treating me on my birthday I felt so bullied.  So when OUR waiter took my food to be bagged up to take home he never brought it out for me to take home.  Yet my families food all got packaged up and brought back within a matter of seconds. Our waiter then brought out a very soggy tiramisu in which I have never had it that way ever and googled to see if I have just been eating it the wrong way my whole entire life.  No where on google does it say that its supposed to be that soggy.  \nIt was not until we were almost home I had forgotten my food since it was never once brought back out like we wasted our money for not eating my food right then and there. If im not mistaken i am pretty sure that the owner and chef were the same person.  In that case I will not be recommending this place to anyone in the future if the owner is that much of a douchebag to with hold my food because I was feeling so sick and just wanted some coffee the whole time I was there.  I should not have to repeat myself to have to ask for things consistently.  It is the waiters job to assess the situation and to be understanding.

To top it off, they paired the dish with a cloyingly sweet rose that tasted more like Two-Buck Chuck than a serious wine pairing.  The meal did not improve any with its scallop or short rib courses, both of which were paired with equally unctuous wines.

The 4-star average Yelp rating was the reason my wife and I chose to dine here during our stay in Phoenix. Yelp, you really let us down this time.\n\nSo I was on company business travel in Phoenix the week of March 12th and my wife was traveling with me. We had a French impulse that Tuesday night and tried to crash Petite Maison in Scottsdale, only to find out that reservations were required and there were no tables available. The following night, still craving French cuisine, we decided to stop in at Sophie's French Bistro in Phoenix.\n\nThe first warning sign was that the place was entirely empty during peak dinner hours. However, encouraged by the strong reviews on Yelp, we decided to go ahead and order. We took advantage of a couple of happy hour specials and ordered the following...\n\n3 Cheese Plate\nChef's Pate\nCalamari\nCrispy Duck Breast\nCreme Brulee\n\nThe food was average at best. My wife and I both tend to critique food as we eat it, and we both found ourselves commenting that the portions were small and the food was overpriced for what it was. Most of what we ate was bland and the pate had a very odd flavor and consistency.\n\nThe fun started about 4 hours later when we were back in our hotel room. We both started experiencing various internal moaning and groaning, followed by the onset of stomach pain. No big deal, I thought... \n\nBy shortly after midnight, we were each fighting for time in the bathroom, taking turns to vomit up everything we had eaten that night. I'll try to spare you the details, but this was the kind of violent and uncontrollable vomiting that I have only experienced perhaps once before in my entire life. Needless to say, diarrhea was also involved.\n\nAfter going through this for a good two hours, my wife and I were both thoroughly exhausted and dehydrated. My wife even told me she felt like she was dying, and said that she had never felt this bad before - not even during child birth. o.O\n\nSo by around 2:30am, my wife was begging for me to call an ambulance. For a while, neither of us could get up off the floor to reach the telephone. I eventually found a break in the vomiting and managed to sip down enough water to recover slightly. I carried my wife out to the car and asked the hotel receptionist for directions to the nearest hospital.\n\nWe drove to John C. Lincoln Hospital on Dunlap, which I recommend if you ever get poisoned by Sophie's French Bistro. I managed to get there without hitting anything, which was remarkable since I could barely see straight and could barely function at all. \n\nOnce inside, my wife completely collapsed and was unconscious briefly. The nurses and doctors rushed her into the ER and brought her back around. They gave her a shot of morphine and then hooked her up to an IV drip of fluids. As I waited, I continued to experience vomiting and tried to keep myself hydrated. Despite being in a hospital, I was determined not to check myself in for treatment, not wanting to add further medical bills.\n\nSometime around 5:00am, my wife was ready to be discharged. The official diagnosis was acute food poisoning. We were never able to identify the specific meal at Sophie's which poisoned us, as we both shared the same courses and ate equal amounts each.\n\nHowever - and this is the kicker - when the doctors asked us where we had eaten dinner and we told them it was Sophie's, they remarked \"oh, that place!\". We learned that the ER at John C. Lincoln has seen 3 other cases of food poisoning caused by Sophie's. The hospital took our information for the purpose of compiling a complaint against Sophie's with the AZ Department of Health Services. They told us that once they have at least 10 confirmed cases, then they are required by law to report the incident as a disease outbreak.\n\nThis all would have been nice to know before we chose to dine at this place. I can only assume that the other poisoning victims either don't use the internet, or are still laying in a pool of vomit somewhere, too weak to write a review.\n\nPlease, please, PLEASE don't put yourself through the same hell that we went through that night. After this experience, we lost all desire to dine in Phoenix ever again. Thanks, Sophie's, for ruining our trip.\n\nFor the record, we did have an excellent meal at CIBO Pizza the night before we were poisoned. I highly recommend CIBO. Great food, without food poisoning.", "business_id": "PuHucejs4LG3hSXnrwi9-g", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-03-17", "type": "review"}

I called for reservations and I was also notified that wine was half off (with 2 entries) on Wednesday. \nUpon arrival the gentleman sitting at the bar came around to ask 'table for two?', no hello or welcome did you have a reservation, no problem but didn't feel terribly welcome.\nOur server stopped to say hello and check on us.

The pate was about bland for our tastes, though the Dijon mustard on the side added a nice flavor, and enjoyed the crisp gherkins.

However I was alerted to the shaky voice of my sister that she had found a nut in her salad. We called over our waitress and she was super apologetic about it, and quickly set out to resolve the issue. My sister thankfully didn't eat the nut (which turned out to be a walnut)!!!

The bruchetta is probably the best I've had in this area next to Armitage, and the size is amazing for the buck.  Out of 10 or so you can choose 4 (fav's are the pepper and goat cheese, the fig and the seasonal), coming out on huge pieces of foccacia cut into fours so you get to keep taking delicious nibbles of each.  Their wine selection is pretty good too, I've fallen in love with the Acadia white that I cant seem to find anywhere else.  \n\nThough well priced for the most part, you do have to watch your tab - you can leave with a 30 buck tab up to a 150 tab for two people. \n\nOnly negitives I'd say would be the seating, particularly the outside, where they absolutely CRAM you in to the point you might be uncomfortable if you dont like snuggling with your neighbor.  Its great for dates, great place to impress out of towners, and just a great gem of Scottsdale.", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-05-12", "type": "review"}

If for some cosmic reason you haven't made it, you really should.\n\nSometimes you just aren't ready to go straight home from work. That's when it's time to tap your local neighborhood eatery, pull up a chair and unwind.\n\nPostino Winecaf\u00e9 is one of those hangouts. Its first location opened in 2001 by the same folks subsequently responsible for La Grande Orange and LGO Pizzeria. Even if either location isn't in your 'hood, you'll quickly feel welcomed by an attractive and friendly staff.\n\nAt the Arcadia location I visited, parking is at a premium, so it's a good idea to come early or late. Checking the car into the valet (only $3) will save potential aggravation. Parking is complimentary at the Central location.\n\nAs I sat taking in the crowd and the space, I couldn't help but ponder: Should I order beer or wine? With a worldwide and world class selection, there is plenty to choose from.\n\nI was feeling like a Belgium beer, so I went for the Chimay Grand Reserve ($8). At quadruple the flavor and double the alcohol content compared to domestics, this beer has a certain yeasty earthiness that's surprisingly not heavy or thick.\n\nA small bowl of olives came to the table so I could start chowing down with my drink selection. They're smart by teasing with a small bowl because after one olive you'll want to order a full bowl ($5) with a blend of Luques, Picholines, Gaetas, Red Cerignolas, Arbequinas and Castelvetranos.\n\nSnacking and sharing is key to the menu, but if you want to compose dinner out of salads and sandwiches, that's just as easy.\n\nThe Pub Board ($10) severs up a soft, hot and steamy pretzels made from local bakery MJ Bread. Alongside are a selection of Schreiner's chorizo, cornichon pickles, aged cheddar and giant Spanish corn nuts for a major snack attack.\n\nPanini, a grilled Italian sandwich, has many varieties. On this visit the Nine Iron ($9.50) was just all right. Filled with hickory-smoked bacon and layered with grilled chicken and fresh burrata mozzarella, it sounds like a hole-in-one, but the soggy lettuce left me in the sand trap.\n\nThe salad that came along was dressed well but it was composed of too many pieces of white and bitter romain cores. After mentioning this to the server it this was quickly addressed with apologies. It's OK to share your expectations with any establishment, whether good or bad.\n\nBruschetta ($12.75), four to an order grilled bread covered with a choice of preparations, scored major kudos. It was love at first bite! My choices were Prosciutto with Figs and Mascarpone, Tomato Jam and Fresh Sheep's Milk Cheese, Albacore Tuna with Gaeta Olives and Salami with Pesto. Salty, creamy, sweet and chewy -- this was a full-on taste party!\n\nThe Salted Caramel Sundae ($5) was the grand finale. Vanilla ice cream with chocolate-covered corn nuts and a pretzel stick with a salted caramel shot was all I ever wanted.\n\nThis is food that I love to eat -- clean, simple and fresh. When paired with my favorite beer or wine, I could easily stop by on my way home from work every night.", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-03-18", "type": "review"}

I wound up feeling like an idiot for talking it up so much.\n\nWe got seated quickly, and were given water.  The waiter asked us if we'd like drinks while waiting for my partner, and I ordered an iced tea. That was the second to last time we saw him.  \n\n10 minutes later, still waiting for my partner, and for my iced tea.\n\nFinally, she showed up, and he came back to take our order. Still no iced tea -- he told me it was on the way.  We ordered.\n\nMy soup came out first (I had wanted it WITH my grilled cheese), and finally, 30 minutes after having sat down, I got my iced tea.\n\nThe food, as always, was amazing. The veg friendly broccoli cheddar soup was soup-er tasty (haha...sorry, it's early), and as usual, the bruschetta and paninis were good too.\n\nThe problem arouse when we wanted to leave. My bestie wanted a box for her other half of her sandwich, and our server was no where to be found. Upon further look, he was seated at a table at the back of the restaurant. Now, when I used to work in the service industry, even if you were going on break, you'd either finish your tables first, or hand them to another server and let your tables know. He did neither.\n\nWe flagged down not one, not two, but THREE different people trying to get a box and our bill.  The table next to us, who sat after us, got both their dessert AND their bill before we could even get ours. All three people we asked said they'd bring box and bill right out; no dice.  FINALLY, we got the bill. It took another 5 or 6 minutes to get the cards back to sign.\n\nMy friend, while she loved the food, was surprised I'd recommended a place with such poor service.  I explained it had never been that way before.

It is an awesome little hangout spot with a great selection of wine and beer and you can't go wrong with any food consisting of bread, brie, prosciutto, figs and the like.  The valet parking and the Range Rovers out front made me nervous for the clientele that comes here (as my boyfriend and I pull up in my Kia) but I have never had such excellent service.  In fact when we walked in we were slightly overwhelmed and didn't quite know who to talk to about a table when the hostess walks up to us and asks if we needed help and my boyfriend blurted out \"we don't know what we're doing!\" and without even smirking she said she'd take our name for our table of 4 and then come find us when one was available, in the mean time we could get a drink and wait at the cocktail tables. Not 30 seconds from when we walked over to the table another waiter walked up to us and asked if we needed a drink and showed us the drink menu. All this at 6:30pm on an already busy Friday night! About 15 minutes pass, our friends show up, we have our drinks and then a section of the bar opens up at the end that nobody else has taken so another waitress/hostess/whatever asks us \"are you a table of 4? would you like to sit here?\" We aren't fussy so we just sit and here we are the rest of the night. My friend even got a free Fish Head (Dogfish?) beer for just being right there when they accidentally poured the wrong one for another patron. I'll definitely have to check this out again on one of the happy hour nights, our waiter got me with the \"Bruschetta Board and bottle of wine for $20 on Tuesday nights\"!", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-05-15", "type": "review"}

I never leave here feeling grossly full or guilty about what I ate, everything is fresh and the portions are good. There is tons of different wine and they are very informative and thorough if you ask about the wine selections! Well priced, great place to meet up with friends or go on a date. I've never had a bad experience here--service, food, wine, all good.Cute location too. I would suggest doing the Valet parking because spaces to park are extremely limited.

He wanted the \"Nine Iron\" which has chicken, bacon, mozzarella, lettuce, tomato, and dijionnaise on ciabatta.  It was rather tasty, however, the ratio of fillings felt a little off.  I love tomato, so it wasn't a big deal to me, but the sandwich was full of it with one thin little leaf of lettuce and clumps of chicken that weren't evenly distributed between the ciabatta.  I ended up opening the sandwich and rearranging the ingredients myself in order to help it along.  Fresh produce, good flavors and amazing bruschetta!  Honestly, I don't think you can really go wrong ordering it.\n\nThe service we received this time around wasn't up to par, but decent enough.  We didn't get our water refilled and the waiter never came back again so that we could order more drinks.  It was a shame.  The food still salvaged the visit though.  I just hope it doesn't happen too frequently since I plan to come here more often with some more friends.\n\nThis time we sat on the patio since it was a little quieter in order to chat and despite the chillier weather (I say that loosely, since I'm from Chicago and shouldn't really complain...) I found the outdoor torch like heaters (no, I don't know the technical term for them and apologize for that) to be perfect along with my jacket.

We enjoy Central's patio more, so we head there.  With either location, we've always asked ourselves, \"why didn't we think about opening a restaurant that just puts tasty things on bread and charge well for it?\"\n\nlet's face it...what Postino does is not rocket science.  Great composed salads, wonderful panini and bruschetta. but, there's no hard cooking.  What there is though is creativity, style and great service. \n\non our last visit, we headed to Postino Central on a Wednesday night, thinking that since it was the day before St. Patrick's, no one would be out.  well, we were wrong. first, we were turned away by the valet -- \"sorry, we're full.\"  The parking lot?  the restaurant?  Where should we go?  any tips?  so, i got on the phone and called the restaurant -- \"Your valet just turned us away, are you looking for customers tonight?\"  He was cordial and stated he would go chat with the valet about finding a better way to turn down folks who needed to park their cars.  \n\nhostess was very friendly and accommodating...giving us every option for seating.  but, given the spectacular night that it was, we wanted to wait for an outdoor table.  so, we ordered some beers with the very friendly waitress that happened by, and sat in the outdoor \"waiting area\" watching the sunset.  about 1/2 hour later, we got a prime table -- in fact the same table we eat at each time we are there. \n\nsame waitress came by.  hubby ordered a second beer (i was still nursing the \"shorty\" (only $2.50!) I'd ordered before.  We selected the bella postino platter with white bean hummus and warm artichoke dip, as well as a bruschetta board of four luscious creations.\n\n\"bus boy\" brought water and small dish of olives (okay, really small -- there were two of us and he brought 3 olives -- not 2, not 4, but 3 --yes, we arm-wrestled for the last one.)\n\nwaitress was friendly, thorough, spunky and a perfect addition to this hip, vibrant, happening place.  admittedly, we in our 40s were either parental age of the young 20 somethings gracing the place, or children of the 60+ \"second go round\" set.\n\nbruschetta -- golly!  we had pesto with salami (great quality), burrata with arugula, bacon and tomato (there was no bacon and PLEASE do not refrigerate your tomatoes), prosciutto with fig and mascarpone (oh so incredibly good) and the \"dessert\" one -- ricotta with dates and pistachios.  after polishing off the dips and the platter of breads (there are 4 pieces to each \"slice\" of bruschetta, we were stuffed.  \n\nwas intrigued by the salted caramel dessert, but there was just no room.  perhaps next time we skip the dip and save room.", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-03-18", "type": "review"}

But a few notes: no, it is nothing like a European cafe; no, it is not an actual wine bar; yes the service absolutely sucks.\n\nWe came here for a friend's birthday party. Her mother had arranged ahead of time for 10 of us to be there and to have wine brought to the tables and poured and some appetizers brought out while we were waiting for the guest of honor. But before that, let's start with parking. \n\nYou can't park in the residential streets because you need a permit. Fine. I heard they had a valet and there's nothing on their website about parking so, whatever. I head to the valet who asks me if I am dining at Postino's or La Grande Orange. I say Postino's and he says \"Ok, that's $3.\" I asked if they seriously were charging me for valet parking based on which restaurant I was going to and they wouldn't answer. I asked if there was an ATM since I had no cash and they told me there is one but it doesn't work. I got back in my car and drove around looking for a place to park for about 15 minutes. Fantastic.\n\nWhen I get there, about 6 girls from the party are standing at the front waiting for someone to notice them. Finally, a very unfriendly gentleman pointed to two tables and said \"Those are yours. Those other tables where people are eating are also yours but they're not done yet. We told them when they were seated they needed to be done in an hour but they're still there.\" Ok, so now we only have two of our four tables. Great. Finally they seat us at our two tables. Another unfriendly staff member comes over and plunks down a few wine glasses and asks if we want a glass of temperanillo. She pours one of the girls a random taste and then walks away. Upon her return I asked if this was the wine we were supposed to have because it was a Malbec. She argued with me about that for a few minutes until I pointed to the label. She said \"Oh\" and walked away. I never did find out if we were supposed to have the Malbec.\n\nAt this point, the other two tables had been cleared. No one brought any other glasses or put the tables together, so we did it. Also, no one opened the other bottles, and yes they were screwtop, but still. So I opened them. Finally, everyone else arrived. We still only had 4 wine glasses. After trying in vain for several minutes we finally managed to flag down the unfriendly woman and asked for more wine glasses to which she responded, rudely \"We don't have any more.\" and walked away. I had to ask three different rude, uninterested staff members for wine glasses and managed to finally get another few but still, not everyone ended up with a glass. \n\nSeriously? Anyway, the bruschetta came out. While the menu offers a lof of different ones, they are all so deplorably bland and under-seasoned that they felt unfinished. The fig, marscapone and prosciutto should have been good but the poor pig that gave its life was disgraced. Dry, flavorless. Most of the bread pieces weren't even cut all the way through so we were all man-handling the pieces to get them apart. The bread was obviously just grocery store bread and I doubt anything is truly hand-made. The issue is, the quality of their ingredients sucks. They obviously buy the cheapest grocery store crap they can and then mark it up. Everything, even the apples on one of the bruschettas were lacking in any real flavor when they should have been tart and crisp instead of dull and mealy. \n\nAnd as for a wine bar? Seriously. A joke. They have a half of a sheet of paper, one side, as their wine list. No flights, no tastings. But for the audience it attracts who are easily impressed by over-priced glop and wine in a trendy area, they'll continue to do just fine.

I have a friend in visiting from out of town and her parents are here also visiting family. So on Wednesday night I decided to take her to Postino, because I went to the one on Central and loved the food (hated the service, but the food was great). So I took her to this location. Much better! The place was way less busy (i guess that's because it wasn't one of their special nights) and we were seated right away. We even found parking over by LGO. Whoa. So, anyway, We shared a bruschetta board with the brie and apple, the goat cheese and bell pepper, burrata and bacon, and prosciutto and mascarpone and we each got a glass of wine. (I got the Haart riesling.... *drool* that has got to be one of the best rieslings I have had). So the bruschetta was good, I thought the goat cheese one was not all I had hoped for, but the apple and brie was wonderful and so was the burrata and bacon... I think burrata is my new favorite cheese.... that stuff is good! Anyway, it  was a nice night and everything was fine. So fast forward to the next day. I went with my friend and her parents to the botanical gardens and then we were going to get lunch, so I list a bunch of places we can go and they decide they want to go to LGO (Now I've never been there but really want to try their pizza, it looks amazing). So we get there and realize A) there is no table service and B) there is no pizza. Lame. So my friend says.... we could go back to postino..... haha! So we ended up going again! two days in a row. \n\nSo the second time we all got paninis and salads (and wine.... yum and 5$). I got the half and half with the turkey panini and the italian picnic salad. The turkey sandwich was pretty good, it had tomato, greens, pesto, and provolone on it. It tasted good, but nothing too special. The italian picnic salad was also just ok. I couldn't taste the vinaigrette that's supposed to be on it at all... maybe they forgot to put it on... or maybe it is ridiculously light. The other ingredients were good, it had beets, greens, goat cheese, walnuts, and some crispy things in it. My friend got the prosciutto sandwich, which I tried and it was delicious. Her dad got the nine iron which looked really good. Anyway, this was not as good an experience as the night before, but it evens out to four stars.

I'm not going to repeat everyone else's reviews so I'll just contribute a few suggestions here.  First, for white wine lovers, go for the Emeri.  Sparkling Sauvignon Blanc. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing!   And I haven't found anywhere else that carries this brand. Forego the glass, just get the whole bottle if you have someone to share it with.  This is a good place for a dates or hanging out with a few friends (more intimate, smaller group), not as great for a big group.  My recco is not to do dinner there (though their grilled cheese and soup is delish and the apple & brie bruschetta rocks too) but go for the wine and leave room for dessert.  They are all delicious.  The portion sizes are just right for sharing.  Creme brulee is my favorite and the salted caramel sundae is also divine (chocolate covered corn nuts? who knew these were so tasty!).    If you aren't in a wine mood  - though why would you be at a wine bar then - the Mr. Qcumber Soda is a unique little refreshing beverage.

Do not pass up the bruchetta.  You can mix it up by choosing four over sized pieces for $12.  I love the arugula/buratta and mozz/basil/tomato but fig and cheese is the winner!  All sans meat but positive feedback on the meat selections.  We shared a generously plated cheese board ($14) and the pub board consisting of fresh pretzel-like bread, spicy nuts, cheese bits and a tasty mustard.  My friend also like their broccoli cheese soup.  I've had the vegetarian panini in the past which I enjoyed although the humus was a little overpowering and messy. I'd get it on the side next time. The salad served with it is phenomenal. \n\nThe wait staff at both locations are great.  I felt bad for walking in 15 minutes before closing last night but I really, really wanted my friends to eat there.  We were greeted with a friendly face and our waiter was very attentive and conversational despite the time.

Definitely put me in a food coma on the 7 hour drive home.\n\n I rarely give 5 stars, but Postinos deserved it because the employees are soooo amiable consistenly checking up on our table. With such a long day in Sedona I had 8-10cups of water and there wasn't a moment I had to \"ask\" for water like other establishments.  Employees must of had very keen eye-vision because it was quite dark in the room and they kept my water cup filled at all times.\n\n  I did have a little sip of Moscato from my friend's bottle and it's bubbly good!\n\n  Postinos... seee ya on my next road trip... or you can open up a location in southern california =)", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-05-31", "type": "review"}

Long-haired young guys with slightly nasal voices talked about multi-timbral effects, VCO's and VCA's, attack, sustain, decay. I can still hear the simulated sounds of shakuhatchi flutes playing the first few notes of \"Sledgehammer\" by Peter Gabriel--loudly enough to rattle windows. \n\nI'm sure the equipment that got purchased here played more than a few weddings where white people embarassingly trudged around in some drunken fashion to \"Take On Me\" or \"Celebrate\".  Perhaps some of the current patrons were those very same dancers. Like the older guy who complimented me on my fishing vest.\n\nBut anyway, about the salad. It was good. I opted for the prosciutto as an add to the Italian salad. On the side was a good glass of tempranillo. There was a tang to it. \n\nA tang. Yes. A tang which recalled a layered gong effect combining additive and subtractive synthesis--something one might hear from say -- a Korg DW8000--which used sampled waveforms modulated through analog filters. That's exactly what the tempranillo reminded me of.\n\nWhen the waitress brought my check I realized that she looked a bit like Siouxsie Sioux, a few years on and minus the make up. Or perhaps it was Lene Lovitch. \n\nAnyway, make time to enjoy a visit to Postino.

On this trip to Phoenix, my friend J thought it was a must to experience Postino! We arrived around 8pm and thought it best to use the valet.  We were so happy that we were able to get a table.  Postino's is absolutely darling.  Our server recommended an earthy red wine that J took advantage of and loved.  I had the sparkling Sauvignon Blanc (delightful!) and our friend R had Framboise.  This is a wine and beer place, so those hoping for other spirits are out of luck.  For those that love wine... this is an excellent place to spend some quality time.  Fabulous wine selection!  \nAs for the food... we were happy with everything we ordered except one thing, which I will save for the end of my review.  Postino regulars recommend the bruschetta and everyone seems to have a different favorite.  This is a fun food to order because you are able to choose 4 of the selections.  Fun decision to make with so many great selections!  My top two faves were 1. bacon, arugula and tomatoes (loved this combo!) and 2. warm artichoke spread (excellent!).  R + J loved the prosciutto w/figs and mascarpone.  So highlight of our night was the fun and delicious bruschetta!\nWe also shared olives (meh) and the prosciutto panini.  I enjoyed the panini but my dining partners were crazy about it.  \nThe best and worst of the night were our desserts.  We couldn't decide which one to order, so we got two.  One rocked our world and the other was ho-hum.  The Creme Brulee was the BEST Creme Brulee I have tasted.  Beyond words delish!  The Chocolate Bouchon was not noteworthy.  As my friend Beti would say, \"It wasn't worth the calories.\"  \nI may have mentioned the word \"fun\" a few times in this review but that is such a perfect description of Postino.

Bored support clean off tables but forget to wipe off chairs and at least one appears literally stoned.\n\nI guess the real question is why the server recorks the bottle with a temporary cork after the first and only service pour. Doesn't the Red wish to breath?\n\nThere were a few service highlights: tastes of the wines freely offered and a quick response for heat for any desert rats (hey!

It is served on full, thick slices of delightfully soft, perfectly crusted Italian bread.  My favorite was the Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone (favorite).  Although I also ordered the mozzarella and basil....I didn't care for it as it sat next to the first variety. :) Yummo!\n\nThe best part is...on Monday and Tuesdays, there's a special! Our total would have been about 45 bucks (bottle of wine roughly $25 and Brushchetta $12.75), we walked away paying a little over $20!

No matter when you come here. I want to say get here 'early' , but truly.. there is no 'early' at Postino. Just get here! Get your name on the list and get your belly near the bar and get your drinks ordered. I usually never change things up too much. I love red wines and that is what I go with .. always. I like the $5 wines until 5pm. After that, if this is where my group is hanging , we generally go with the bottle then. The bottles are priced at 3x the amount of the glass price. Not bad and not hard to figure out. The meat board is great .. the cheese board is divine. All bruschettas ...mmmmmm. I've never done any desserts here. Maybe I should . But I usually am not a dessert girl. So I use my calories on wine, bread and cheese! I only brought my star down one as the last time I was here our waiter was to split the bill with me and my flight attendant friend from NYC. Instead, not only did he split it, he split and added the full cost to my card too! It took about 5 business days to correct!

I was in a large party (~10 people) and they sat us right away, which was awesome. The place was not very busy as we were there for a very early dinner on a Sunday (4pm). Our waiter took our drink orders at 4:15, they were delivered and then disappeared until 5 (which is, you guessed it, then end of Happy Hour). He came back at 5:01 on the dot. Kinda sucks. As we were all hungry and eager to order, but it was not until sometime later that he re-appeared for the food order. \\\n\nHe did the whole, \"I'm too awesome to write down any of your orders\" bit. Even though we were each getting an order of Bruchetta (which gives the option to choose 4). Luckily, he got our orders correct, but if he hadn't? I am not going to tip you more because you didn't write it down!  Even if you get it right 95% of the time, it's really crappy for that 5% that you mess up!

The $20 for a bottle and board of bruschetta is a *steal*. As one of employee said, \"How could you not order this?\" while we waited for our table.  \n\nMy friend and I arrived early to request a table for four. Perched on a tall side table we enjoyed a full view of the restaurant. Sipping not so daintily we quickly passed the 45 minute wait.  \n\nOnce seated Bethany was a wonder. Our bill was seamlessly transferred and waters arrived. The neat thing about traveling in a pack of four is that, Yes, You Can drink three bottles of wine. What could possibly be better than that? It removes the need to think hard about the bruschetta menu. (There are 12 options so we had one of each brought out.)\n\nWe surprised the fella in the group. He doubted that three bruschetta boards would be sufficient to feed his hungry belly. If you haven't been before, a bruschetta is palm sized and sliced into four pieces. Trust me, there's plenty. \n\nBut if you're still hungry this is a wine bar and they have food. The panini selection is wonderful, I beg to argue the Nine Iron is the best.  (Bacon layered with grilled chicken, burrata mozzarella, lettuce, beefsteak tomato and dijonnaise!) Another approach, perhaps on another visit, is to order the Butchers Block (big assortment of meat and cheese) for $14 and/or the Cheese Board for $13.\n\nIf for some reason wine is not up your alley, Postino's offers pitchers of beer. If you need to drink a cocktail...suck it up kid. That's not happening here. The Mon/Tue special begins at 8pm. I'd recommend scoring a table before the start time, even if that means buying some appetizers beforehand. \n\nMake sure to ask for Bethany!

Neighborhood dive bar where everyone seemed to know each other, insanely friendly service (shout out to Kerri!) and killer bar food and chicken wings of epic proportions! \nI am a chicken wing connoisseur, and frankly Jt's may have the best chicken wings I have EVER had! They deep fry those baby's, sauce em and throw them on the grill. They have several choices of sauces the best was the works which featured all of their sauces mixed together minus their suicide sauce which produced a delicious and not too spicy wing! I like my wings ultra spicy so I ordered a side of the Suicide sauce, which I personally loved - definitely spicy but not so that your mouth is on fire. Their wings will set you back $7.50 for a dozen ( Which makes me love this place more!). \nThey have a pretty large beer selection on tap and every liquor you would want!

I came in from out of town and hung out with my buddy Joe. He highly recommended JT's because of their awesome wings and tiny tacos. What he didn't know was that most of the positive reviews of this place on Yelp are ancient reviews from when Julio was still working there. This place had the kiss of death and was taken over by cheap, shady owners. The new owners want to cut cost but still cash in on the positive word of mouth about the food. They also raised the prices. So in essence, the new owners are producing a cr@p product and charging us more money! To add insult to injury they shorted us 2 chicken wings. Talk about trifflin'!! If they're shorting people wings, I'd hate to know what they're doing to their drinks. When we got them they were cold all the way down to the bones and stale like they had been made as a mistake earlier in the day, boxed up and given to us (short 2 wings!!!). The tacos were bland like they just cooked some ground beef without seasoning and threw it in the shell. I added the salsa to try to add some flavor to it but it didn't cut it. I'm sure MY taco has more flavor than this one did. Most of the wings and tacos are still in the fridge and will inevitably meet their fate at the bottom of the garbage can. In conclusion, if you want over priced, piece of cr@p wings that don't taste half as good as frozen ones and tacos that taste better when they come out of you than going in, go to JTs so they can pi$$ on you face and tell you it's raining!\n*Additionally, don't believe the review underneath mines. I'm almost 100% positive it was done by someone who works for them or has some sort of affiliation with this place. It's written like an advertisement. The wings look NOTHING like they do in that picture. This review would be VASTLY different if they did. Our wings were all limp and flaccid when they showed up to film. Nice try you guys.

I guess some guy was treating a women badly in the back so some guy assulted him, I didn't see it but two other guys there recorded it and showed the bartender she kicked him out but he wouldn't leave, so she called the cops, while the cops were on there way I went out back to smoke and the guy was out there talking pretty crazy, I pretty much just made fun of him and talked trash to him, he asked if I was carrying (a gun)  and I said always he asked to see it and told him no that if he saw it I would have to kill him, he pretend to pull a gun on me and I laughed at him. I think I scared him a little and he walked out the front of the bar and the cops were there and took him to jail, I was kind of surprised that the bartender actually called the cops but hey good for her.

The bartender/waitress was friendly and had a sense of humor. The jukebox was playing and it was pumping out a great selection of classic rock hits. The place is pretty big. The bathroom is tiny and somewhat dingy. There must be 20 TVs there to watch. They have karaoke one night a week and have pretty good size stage/floor for that. They have a daily special and offer their cheap raved about breakfasts meals until 2pm daily. Half price on some appetizers as of 3pm and discount drinks. Place is a bit dark but clean. There is one pool table and two arcade games. It seems to me that it must be a serious drinking place because it doesn't offer much to do in the amount of space that is there. Oh and there is plenty of bar space to belly up to, the bar is huge! The menu is so-so , nothing fancy or extensive but one should find something on it, with most things under $9. I suspect I will eventually pop in again to try the raved about breakfast menu.", "business_id": "RIeWXLMHZQlYprYt1x2f1w", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-03-16", "type": "review"}

I had the $3 plate. It was okay. My toast was perfect & buttery. I was going to have the $4.75 plate with french toast until I learned it came with one slice of toast! That was very disappointing to learn the price jumps a $1.75 and you get only one slice of dipped toast but could get two pancakes, it doesn't make sense. I wonder how big and fluffy the pancakes are, but not enough to risk it and order them. I just don't get it, why they think one slice of french toast is a fair deal. \nAnyhow the eggs and bacon came with that, they were cooked okay. Could have done a more presentable delivery of the meal at home. Have seen a more presentable job done at many other eateries through out the USA at independently owned or chain restaurants. So I'm in no rush to return here for the breakfast, even if it is cheap. Unlike some I won't be abandoning other long standing breakfast joints for this. After all you get what you pay for.

The place was fairly empty. We ordered coffee since we don't drink wine, though there aren't many Italian wines on the menu.The coffee was lukewarm and didn't taste fresh. They put it in a carafe and warm in a microwave. Ugh. The menu is limited to some nice choices that are higher quality than chain Italian restaurants. They serve a basket of average garlic bread. We opted for 3 different plates (Ravioli, Manicotti, & Linguini w/ white clam sauce) & we ordered the mushrooms for an appetizer. They didn't bring appetizer plates so we used our bread plates. Then they sat dirty thru the entire meal. The food is good not fantastic 5-star but tasted good and the presentation was nice except the soup was served in a small cup with no under plate or saucer. 2 of us opted for the salad which was simple and came already with the house dressing. The service was only so-so. We were checked on regularly and the busboy filled our water regularly but we had to ask for a refill of bread and coffee. We had dessert of creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and had to ask for 3 spoons. Then he brought a tiramisu by mistake and had to take it back and bring the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Fortunately, we had a coupon for reduced price because the final tally was way overpriced at over $80 including tip. Atmosphere is quiet and pleasant. It's definitely not an elegant restaurant.

The ladies room even has pictures of 1980s hotties plastered all over the inside of the stalls. \n\nOverall, this is a great little bar to see a local band and have a cheap drink. Just beware of the scary bikers that seem to perpetually hang out in front of places like this!", "business_id": "f_leeIRar8uNCkk5sAmHRQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-05-20", "type": "review"}

I usually like these types of places because of where I grew up but wasn't really feeling the food. \n\nWe went there around 6ish on Friday night... The happy hour specials were good! Half off apps. and 2 dollar bottles or drafts. The atmosphere is quite like a saloon and as said before a bit run down. There were definitely alot of what appeared to be \"locals\" when we were there. \n\nIt is definitely true what is said about the prices but maybe we ordered the wrong thing cause we definitely got what we paid for. I ordered the super wagon burger and my wife ordered the 1/2 rack of ribs. My burger was darn big I must say and was cooked nicely. The problem is that it didn't have any flavor. It appeared to be handmade but didn't have any seasoning and didn't have the best taste. I saw on the menu they were offering dishes that were \"Char Grilled\" but am surprised they didn't cook the burger on the grill. I think that would have been the difference along with a little bit of seasoning salt and some pepper. The same goes for the Ribs... They tasted like they were cooked in the oven only because they were tender but had very bland seasoning and were smothered in sauce. I would like to think I can throwdown with some ribs and one thing I know is that they need to be finished on the grill! Not only for taste but for texture. \n\nI'm not going to say this place was terrible but they completely missed the mark on the two things we ordered. I really liked the homemade potato salad though. \n\nI/we will probably back during happy but not for a full on dinner. Don't have high expectations for this place. The atmosphere is chill and the people are nice but if you are used to going to higher end spots this place will either humble you or make you want to run out the door.", "business_id": "JImJictLIE48_O1z-l2TGw", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-03-30", "type": "review"}

Strange.\n\nAnyway, we were hungry after work, as usual, so we were looking around for something new and interesting.  After giving up on searching for something closer to our current location, we gave in and decided to give this place a shot.  After all, who can resist cheap food?  I had to stifle laughter when we walked in.  I don't know what it is, but this place gave me the giggles!  We stood at the hostess table for a few minutes before we were acknowledged and then a table was cleared for us.  Our drinks were brought out quickly and then we ordered.  Honey Mustard Chicken Wings and Fried Mushrooms for the both of us to share, and a Turkey and Bacon grilled sandwich for me.\n\nNow, you will be sorely disappointed if you come here expecting any sort of creativity with food.  This is straight up generic as it comes food, but they at least do it right.  The chicken wings were piping hot, meaty, and had a pretty good flavor.  I'd probably order a bolder sauce next time.  The mushrooms were really strange.  They were fried, but their breading was soft, and not crispy at all.  I like the outsides to be crunchy, so they weren't my favorite, but I had plenty of ranch to dip them in and make things better.  Now, when my sandwich came out, I stared at it and was disappointed.  It just looked sad, especially with the straight from the bag wheat bread it was made with.  Let me tell ya, don't judge this book by it's cover.  My sandwich was packed with turkey and simply loaded with delightfully salty, crunchy bacon.  It was a really good sandwich, I'm just sad that I was too full to finish it!  The fries were, well, just fries.\n\nI'll probably come back to this place sometime when we're in the area again.  The food is solid, the service is decent, and you cannot beat the prices.

To begin with, the busboy brought our silverware and menus out right away (A+).  Then it went downhill from here...When our server, Aubrey, finally did show up, she asked us for our drink order and we told her were actually ready to order.  This did not matter to Aubrey...she took our drink order and said she'd be back for our food order when she could write it down.  Okay....she brought back our sodas and we order our burgers.  Mine was ordered medium and my wife ordered hers well done.\n\nSome time later when the food arrived, we asked for some sliced pickles....they never showed up until we asked the busboy to bring them to us. I guess Aubrey was too busy helping everyone else to get our measly pickles.\n\nNow, I think well done has a universal meaning of cooked all the way through.  Aubrey may have had the chance to fix this if she ever stopped back by to check on us, but she did not.  \n\nDuring this time, we observed Aubrey checking on other patrons but we somehow escaped her attention.  I was tempted to ask her what we did to upset her but she never came back to our table.\n\nWe finally flagged her down to get our check, it took way too long to prepare.  To give you an idea of how bad the service was, the bill was $24.82, I left $25.\n\nI asked to speak to the manager and David came out and introduced himself as the owner and I explained to him what had happened.  He introduced his wife to me and asked her to get me a gift card for the amount of my check.  He was extremely apologetic about the service we received.\n\nA few minutes later I was out the door with my gift card (which I did not want in the first place).\n\nMy wife was waiting outside (that's how upset she was) and when I told her what had happened, she took the gift card and was going to return it to him and let him know that's not what we wanted.\n\nAs we were walking back in, we spotted a homeless gentleman and offered the gift card to him as we had no intention of EVER returning.\n\nMy wife went in to explain to the owners what she had done with the gift card and the homeless gentleman followed us in and was going to order some food.\n\nWe left and as we were pulling out the parking lot, the homeless man informed us that David had taken the gift card away from him and told him it was not valid and that if he didn't leave he was going to call the police.\n\nWow....really?

All pretty good. Oh, and salsa too. It's freshly made and very zippy!\n\nI would stay away from the zucchini and mozzarella sticks. Both are too greasy and lacking in flavor. The mozzarella stick is ginormous, which seems appealing at first but it is just too much cheese and too little breading. \n\nI wish they had more food specials because the appetizers will set you back 7-10 bucks a plate. But the portions are huge. They do have an amazing mexican night on Tuesday. $1.25 enchiladas and tacos.

After all, It is JUST a simple sports bar, with plenty of HD screens in good angles, beer specials and very good wings.  They maintain the feeling of a gamewatch spot better than the Mesa location, which appears to be more of a family dining spot, and reduce the frat-bar vibe of the Tempe location. \n\nI would consider NNY's wings the best in the valley for anyplace NOT names Hazlewood's.  They have a great flavor, but they tend to mix in a few small afterbirth rejects into your basket and count them as one of your dozen.  No fair.\n\nThere is no reason to rush out and get to this NNY location if there is one by you, but if you are in Sprawltukee, its a more-than-suitable place to stop by for a serious game watch.\n\n*Side note:  everytime I've watched a game of personal importance here, my rooting interest has lost.

We were hungry so we decided to give it a whirl anyway.\n\nMy boyfriend is not hard to please when it comes to pizza, he's a standard pepperoni kinda guy. He ordered a 10\" pepperoni pizza, which looked like your average pizza, no frills. After the first bite, he gave a thumbs down and made a sad face. All this, coming from a man who regularly eats junky chain pizzas without complaint. He said the crust was bland, the sauce didn't taste like much and it was waaaay greasy. I tried some myself and it was truly awful pizza.\n\nI ordered the Linebacker sandwich (turkey, bacon, lettuce, tomato, mozzarella, avocado) which sounded promising and looked quite good as well. The turkey was standard shaved deli counter meat with little flavor, the lettuce and tomato was fine, the bacon added some much needed salt to the sandwiched , and the avocado was very unripe, thus flavorless. The only saving grace of the sandwich that made it palatable was the bread roll which had a decent crust on it. For my side, I opted for their \"house-made chips\". They looked awesome, a good golden brown and sliced very thin lengthwise. Sadly, they were served completely cold and undersalted. Some were pretty floppy and undercooked. I know they're potato chips, but was I wrong in assuming that they might have been fried to order and served hot?\n\nThe more I think about this meal, the more upset I get. While the price for our meal wasn't outrageous, the food was still amazingly mediocre. I don't like knowing I could have gone to the Safeway and bought a pre-made deli turkey sandwich for $3.99 that would have been basically just as tasty as something I paid more than double for.

Not having been to Native in many moons, we arrived at this destination as the chosen venue after a graduation. Understanding that this was a busy evening, the restaurant shouldve been well prepared for what was in store (my review is not based on their lack of preparation, rather what I experienced during my visit).\n\nService 3: Our server could not provide any good recommendations on any of the food. And the one thing she did suggest was mediocre (pizza). All servers should be required to try each item on the menu. That way when a customer asks, \"how's the ... ?\", they can answer honestly vs. no answer at. As a customer, I want to hear how great things taste, not \"I don't know\". KNOW YOUR MENU! \n\nMy real issue was with the children's food. We ordered 2 mac n cheese dinners, but only one showed up. We inquired with other food runners who claimed to be checking into the matter, still nothing. Finally, after asking a third runner, someone stepped up and personally owned the issue. After waiting 20 mins from the time we asked how much longer would it be for the second meal, it finally arrived. You would've thought this was gourmet mac n cheese. Nope! Straight up Kraft (but the fruit cup was pleasing).\n\nOur waitress NEVER came to confirm if everything was ok or if we needed anything else. Had she done that she would've known that we had a 4 year old who was extremely unhappy that all the other children had eaten and she hadn't. \n\nServers: CHECK ON YOUR PEOPLE! Your tip depends on it. \n\nFood 3: as mentioned earlier, the food was mediocre at best. My pizza was nothing fancy. The children's mac n cheese was a knock-off version of Kraft (blue box version folks). \n\nI personally have no reason to return as I found nothing appealing on the menu that would satisfy my tastebuds.

Closing at 9 PM on a Saturday just enticed me to skip over the place entirely and make an evening out of it somewhere else.  Then, although admittedly, their first priority is wine, they took Shiner Bock off of the tap selections.

My husband and I decided to pick this place for our date night a few Saturdays ago. We arrived at about 5:50 (10 minutes before Happy Hour ended) We thought we would order a glass of wine each and a brushetta board before HH wrapped up and then order off the menu. We sat until 6:08 before someone finally greeted us. It was super awkward too because every server kept looking at us and making eye contact but no one ever cared to come by and get a drink order. Finally greeted,  I asked the waitress if we could order a few items from the HH menu because we sat down prior to it ending - she acted as if I was asking for too much \"Ummmm I can't access those buttons after 6pm I'll see if that's even possible\" as if I was in the wrong for asking! Our brushetta came out promptly however, it was much less in taste then I expected. They only had 4 selections and you picked 3 to complete your board - not much variety. The tomatoes were slimy to the point I had to undress each piece just to stomach it. Wasn't pleased. I ordered the prosciutto and brie flatbread and my husband had the salmon cakes - both were good. \n\nI most likely will not return to this place due to the lacking service and experience and the food being just OK. Hopefully I was there on an off night.", "business_id": "Our6bzte5W1wlIeOu9luug", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-04-01", "type": "review"}

Seriously. I've eaten here several times a year for sixteen years and have been through either two or three owner changes. I love it. From the mildly cheesy, somewhat 80s styling to the tuxedo'd out waiters, I can't get enough. Ruffinos is a classy restaurant where you're more than some random customer and through my years here, the management has practically bent backwards at times to make things right. \nThe food here is incredible, and if you're lucky enough to come on a night they have osso bucco, you'll be stuck coming back for the next sixteen years like me. I can vouch for so many of the food items here, but I'll just make a couple of suggestions. For starters the clams casino and escargot can't be beat, they are both rich and garlicky and the escargot is simply not as chewy as most places, so good. For your meal try the tortellini ruffino, one of my favorite meals of all time, or the veal ruffino or filet medallions if they have them. But the osso bucco is a step above most things I've tried in my life. Expensive and worth it. \nLook, I don't waste my time on bad restaurants, I eat at good places and me continuing my business here for so long means they're doing something very well, try out Ruffino and see what it is.", "business_id": "S3FhtwXuiGMlGdBNtmiiSQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-04-10", "type": "review"}

I hate to bag on a restaurant because I know restaurant owners work so hard, but this was a pretty bad experience.  I know they have live music, too, and that is a sign of class.\n\nFundamentally, the problem with this place can best be summed up by saying that it wouldn't surprise me if there isn't a single Italian involved in the running of this place.  If there is, they have gone so American it's hard to tell.  Think Pascal in \"Big NIght.\"\n\nWhen I showed up by myself at 7pm, I had not eaten lunch so I should have been pretty easy to please.  The restaurant was mostly empty, yet I was sat  at a small table right next to the only baby in the restaurant.  Really?  I probably didn't look Awhatukee chic, but I didn't look like a bum either.  And hey, it was Monday and my credit card is paid off.\n\nI was sat by the owner (I think).  He didn't take a drink order and then I waited a long time to get a menu or a drink.  I don't blame the server.  It was bad timing as she knew she had a meal for four being plated and a couple of credit cards to run.  The owner could have easily handled both the menu and my drink order.\n\nThen, they brought the garlic bread.  It was that soggy over-buttered, undercooked, nastiness you would never get in Italy or even a high-end Italian restaurant in the states.  (Think Fazoli's)  The greasiness probably started to take away my appetite which had been sky high when I arrived.  I would strongly recommend that Ruffino's ditch the garlic bread and go with nice Italian bread and small bowl of butter.\n\nSoon after, the entrees for the neighboring table arrived.  They didn't look like $25-30 entrees.  Even the osso bucco looked unappetizing..\n\nThen, they brought me a cup of brodo with tortellini.  The waitress warned me to be careful because it was super hot.  I would say it was just hot enough not to get sent back.  It was decent, but kind of puny for four bucks.  The bowl would have been seven and I was mostly trying it out of curiosity.  The broth was pretty good, but as it got colder it lost any magic it had.\n\nI also got a Campari and soda, which was a little light on Campari.  It didn't come with a fruit wedge of any type, which is pretty standard when an Italian is behind the bar.  So, I asked for an orange.  Unfortunately, because I was seated in the farthest corner from the door and the bar, I didn't get the orange until I was over halfway through the Campari and soda.  Maybe I'm off base here and I should asked for it explicitly.  Sorry, I'm not much of a drinker.\n\nThe salad was quite good.  They make it tableside which is nice because I got to pick my choice of elements.  The greens were excellent and the dressing was nice.  I think I got two portions even though I was by myself, which was great.  Unfortunately, there was a little too much cheese (or something) making it too heavy.  Still, not bad.\n\nThroughout the evening my water glass was empty, which is annoying when you're paying $20 minimum for an entree.  I'm not a stickler about this stuff, but when it happens 3-5 times at a place like this, it's not right.  My waitress was very nice and worked very hard.  One thing that sort of stuck with me was when I was discussing the menu, she said something like, \"They've been here 20 years, it's good.\"  I'm wondering if that was indicative of a place resting too much on its laurels.\n\nI got the Fettuccini Ruffino which was a sausage-based dish listed as one of seven signature dishes on the menu and strongly recommended by my server because it was \"simple\" and tasty.  After a pretty dubious performance so far, I convinced myself that this entree was going to hit it out of the park and save the evening.  Instead, it was a total failure and I was actually forcing it down by the end.  It wasn't simple.  It was sloppy.\n\nThey cooked the life out of the fettuccini and the sauce looked like something Olive Garden would have invented, not like the sausage crumbles with oil, pasta and vegetables I am used to at high-end Italian joints.  The sausage was exactly like something you'd buy at Trader Joe's, which isn't bad, but it didn't seem homemade or special.  Honestly, if they had put the plate in front of me, my first reaction would have been to tell them they had brought it to the wrong table.   Maybe I was expecting the wrong the thing, but whatever the case, it didn't taste very good.\n\nAfterward, I went to Enzo's Cafe and Gelato for a cappuccino to make things right.  There was more Italian in that cappuccino than a whole meal at Ruffino's.  Now, I'm watching Tony Bourdain in Naples just to make up for the rest of the evening..\n\nI hope I can get another chance to go here and have them prove me wrong, but I won't do it on my dime.  There was just a little too much Olive Garden in Ruffino's to justify the prices.", "business_id": "S3FhtwXuiGMlGdBNtmiiSQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-04-10", "type": "review"}

Our plan was to order a glass of wine & Oysters Rockefeller, and we did. Teresa, whom I believe is the owner, was working the bar and looked like kitchen help. Her black outfit (uniform) was very unattractive and it looked like she'd been cleaning a house all day long. You would think she would look nice since she's serving the guests. The restrooms were playing wonderful Italian Music, Dean Martin was playing when I was in there, but out in the dining area there was THUMP THUMP music...really? This is an Italian restaurant, where's the ambiance? If I wanted THUMP THUMP/ hip hop, I'd not pick an Italian restaurant. Maybe we should have sat in the bathroom? Oh...but it gets better. A young man, teens, brought in the trash cans from outside, as in 'big round trash bins,' one in each hand, right through the lounge where we were sitting in the booth, one of the trans cans almost rubbed my husband's right arm.  A few minutes later, the young man went out again and brought a 3rd one in, the same way! No lids on the trash cans, just big old dirty trash cans being brought in through the front door - OMG, REALLY? This would break so many regulations - don't ya think? GROSS! How dirty and germy. The wine was just ok, and the Oysters Rockefeller were the worst ever. There were 6, and they were tiny and pathetic looking. They were edible, and we ate them, for $20 - you better believe we ate them, but they are not in any league to even be called Oysters Rockefeller.  My gosh, go to DURANTS and order theirs, THAT'S OYSTERS ROCKEFELLER. Ruffino didn't even have cheese on theirs. The presentation failed drastically. They sat these sad looking 'things' on a wilted bed of iceburg shredded lettuce. You know, the more I think about it, I shouldn't have paid, and I shouldn't have eaten them. We just should have walked out and said \"REALLY?\"  I even left a tip, that's how stupid I am. She didn't deserve a tip, because besides the fact the food was a joke, she didn't come by ONCE, to ask how things were. Didn't even ask if we wanted another drink - nothing. We finally had to flag her down for the check. $33 for what? I felt sick when we left there. Oh well, you never know what you're gonna get, right? We went it happy - looking forward to get our Friday on, and left in different spirits. Felt ripped off and very disappointed. I can tell you that 10 years ago this restaurant was the best in town. It's changed hands long since and is not even comparable anymore.  My amazement is, 1.  How can you allow food to leave your kitchen looking as this dish did? No presentation at all?  2. Do you not know what Oysters Rockefeller are? These didn't look or taste like them. Call them baked oysters, or something, but not Rockefeller, c'mon. Giving 1 star only because you have to chose at least 1. Otherwise, it's a negative number.", "business_id": "S3FhtwXuiGMlGdBNtmiiSQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-03-10", "type": "review"}

Looking for a themed ambiance?  This place will suit you.  Want great entrees?  Um.... \nWe've been coming here for years, but less and less more recently.  Our most recent visit was 2011-05-07.\nFrom an ambiance perspective, it delivers a sense of the Spice Road.... an asian flavor through different asian cultures - prepared for western taste.  Elephants (go figure), animal prints, funky overhead fans... you get the picture.  Throw in a bar and tv's for the sports gurus, colored lighting, and now its east meets west.\nWe ordered from the specials they were running on our most recent visit.  Lettuce wrap and calamari delivers.  Vietnamese rolls were less successful.  Salads were good - it's kind of hard to screw up a salad.  Entrees we ordered the ribeye steaks.  Not impressed.  Here's a hint:  the ribeye steaks are cut so thin that they'll dry out quickly when cooked; even medium will result in shoe leather (yeah, I ordered medium).  If I'd known it was cut so thin, I'd have ordered medium-rare to give it a fighting chance.  Desserts are advertised (for the special) as a mini-brownie or ice cream in a wonton cup.  Uh... \"mini\" and \"wonton\" give the wrong impressions; these weren't one-bite wonders - the \"mini\" was a decent size portion (wonder how big a \"regular\" size would be!).  Wonton skins are about 3\" across; these were more like spring roll wrappers (8-9\" across), deep-fried into a cup shape, dusted with cinnamon sugar, and a large scoop of ice cream in the center - topped off with garnishes, of course.\nOverall, it's decent appetizers, salads, and desserts; hit-and-miss on the entrees.  We've lost some favorites over the years, didn't care for some other elements, and generally \"accepted\" it for what it is.  Can't say I'm a fan (hence no 4-star, although I'd have given it a 4-star years ago), so now it's an \"yeah,it's okay\" - or 3 stars.", "business_id": "QzXFdjIbFRGhzL83goPPLA", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-05-09", "type": "review"}

Theirs are far superior to the ones I just had at EB.  Very boring.  We shared another appetizer, the crispy green beans.

Everyone got their food, including me, but I got the wrong dish.  I ordered the Kona ribs with fries and got Kona ribs and chicken with brown rice instead.  (I do NOT like brown rice.) Eddie offered the menu back - I knew when he asked if I wanted white or brown rice, something was wrong, and I should've mentioned it.\n\nNeedless to say, I showed him what I ordered... He was awesome.  No argument, no rude remarks, just an explanation of the item.  I placed my order again and it was delicious!  So happy.  My mom, the kids, my brother and my nephew all enjoyed the night.  And because Eddie was so kind, he got that extra tip!  \n\nDinner choices and overall thoughts (I tasted the ahi salad and got reviews around the table):\n\nFrench onion soups, cheesy and delish\nSide green salad, side Caesar salad, typical, but good\nSeared Ahi tuna salad, delish though just a little salty for my taste\nLamb shanks, tender and full of flavor, potatoes were smooth and very good, veggies were good enough to eat\nKona pork ribs, sweet and tender, delish, coleslaw was a little wet for my taste so my daughter stole it, fries were hot and salty (the kind of salty I like), and the apple \"relish\" was really yummy.

We chose this place because we wanted to go out to eat but I didn't want to miss the NCAA tourney games going on. Should have got it to go.\n\nFood: 3.5, it was above average for bar food. Legends Burger and Blackened Chicken were good choices. The kids menu has a choice of(among others) fried or grilled chicken fingers. I don't know if it is actually any healthier, but it is nice to at least have the appearance that it is by not having to eat fried food being that chicken is the only kids menu item my boy will eat anywhere.\n\nService: 3.5, our order was received fairly quick. The waitress was nice and made an appropriate amount of \"check in on us\" appearances. My drink was replaced before my first was gone which I am a huge fan of. Nothing worse than wanting a drink but your cup has been empty for 5 minutes.\n\nAtmosphere: 2, when we walked in we immediately noticed a strange smell like a strong cleaner had been spilled. We were then seated at the far end of the restaurant. The ceiling fans right overhead were on high and when asked if they could turn them down because our kids were freezing we were told the customers over near the door were complaining about the smell so they could not turn the fans down. The thing is there is a double door entrance as well as a double door patio entry perfectly located for airing out the smell, but alas they were closed when the outdoor temperature was well suited for open doors. Lower fans and open doors would have worked much better than just trying to blow it around as fast as they could.\n\nSports Bar: 1, I don't believe they are aware of the preferences of the majority of sports fans or paying attention to the sports experience they are trying to provide, at least those that were there on a Saturday evening which I would think would be the A team. This is the heart of March Madness. 3 games are being played, 2 really close games that are almost over and a third that was still at the half and that is the one that they have the audio playing. After watching Dayton upset Syracuse by 2 (no audio for that game) they change that TV to hockey and put the audio on for it when there are still 2 March Madness games going on. Hockey over March Madness? Really? I could see this mistake happening at a Macaroni Grill or something but not a bar and grill.\n\nBetween the poorly featured sports and the closed doors while trying to air out the smell I don't think the staff was capable of making the best decisions to better please the customers. I would go again if I was in the mood for a burger as I would assume the smell won't be there for long, but not if watching sports was also on the to do list.\n\n3 stars because 2.5 isn't an option and I wouldn't say it was quite a \"2\" worthy experience since the food and service was decent.", "business_id": "d-rZazFFYvnjRZUhLTEUZg", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-03-22", "type": "review"}

One thing I learned yesterday, if Amanda's pouring drinks, order beer. I ordered a vodka and soda. It was a very light pour. So I ordered an extra shot...which came out about 1/2\" of vodka in a shot glass. So, the next drink, I went ahead and ordered a double. It tasted just like the first drink did BEFORE I poured the extra shot in it. And I paid $8.00 a piece for these two drinks! Last week, we met some friends there and the drinks were poured perfectly. I would have been hard pressed to even drink a double. The first time I ate there (after the new menu), I ordered a veggie burger. It was microwaved so much it was like shoe leather. The next time I went in, I avoided the veggie burger and ordered a french dip with a side salad. It was a great sandwich and the salad was fresh and crisp!! Yesterday, I went in and ordered the french dip again. \"Meh\" is all I can say about it. And the salad had obviously been made much earlier and covered with plastic wrap because it was all squished down in the bowl in that shape. I'm sure for the local neighborhood patrons, this is all just fine because they go there to see all of the other neighborhood patrons.

I really truly wish I could give it a better rating based on the fact that there are a few servers and other staff that are really great and it used to be a well run restaurant. However, things have gone downhill the last year and I couldn't recommend it to anyone.\nThe last two visits we have made have both been for birthday dinners. Last visit left us a little less than satisfied with inattentive servers, being seated next to a group of 30 who decided they could take up half the room for their office party complete with applause, and waiting 20 minutes past everyone else's food arriving for my entree which was then so hot I had to take it home to eat. I went ahead and filled out the online survey, marked that I wasn't opposed to having a manager call me, and NOTHING. I was hoping it was a bad night and this time it would be better. Unfortunately it wasn't.\n\nWe have a large family group and are used to waiting, no big deal. An hour wait when quoted 40 minutes on a Sunday night when the lobby is empty (and some whispers amongst the hosts about not wanting to seat certain servers because they want to go home) gets a little annoying, but I digress. \nWe are sat at a table pushed together almost right in a traffic area(we were paranoid of getting elbows and trays to the head the whole time) and one flustered server gave the greeting and walked away without taking any drink orders. At this point we had 3 small children who already were getting tired as it was nearing bedtime after the wait. Waiting for drinks and putting orders in took forever, when we finally brought salads and soups it was already past 9 PM. Then we sat with empty app dishes in front of us for a good 20 minutes with no sign of servers. When my entree came out(shrimp ravioli type dish which was good but nothing amazing) the whole side and bottom of the plate had mashed potatoes on it. I'm hoping someone in our party had mashed potatoes. After eating a bit, most of us were just ready to go home at this point, the kids were sleeping in their chairs, we had to flag down our server who was cleaning tables across the room and ask for our check. We had asked for two cakes earlier for the birthday guy and as we were asking them to just cancel that, the server insisted he had them all set and waiting to go he was just waiting for checks(huh?). So they brought out the cakes and the two servers tried to get our party to sing happy birthday. Poor birthday guy got the most pathetic and tired birthday song ever. When the bill came, that automatic 15% tip added to each bill was just a slap in the face. I know it's customary but being large tippers generally, not having a choice in the matter was offensive at that point. Not to mention the fact that the servers had to have known that our meal took a ridiculous amount of time and we were far from happy, but there was no sign of the manager all night and it was far below what we have come to expect from any Darden restaurant. \n\nWe won't be going back to this location if we can help it.", "business_id": "scVOmQsf5HSY3n9CG06tFA", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-03-12", "type": "review"}

I love Olive Garden's menu, so we dine out at the chain somewhat regularly.  We went to this particular restaurant yesterday for a dinner with an elderly relative.  I suppose when we walked in, they profiled us and didn't feel we merited any kind of special or polite treatment.  We were led to the most cramped, dingy and dark booth I had ever seen in an Olive Garden restaurant, where the lighting was so bad, we couldn't even see our menus.  Our server was Sergio, and he was just going through the motions--quite badly.  He didn't smile once, or come back and ask us how we were doing.  He brought the salad, and then we didn't see him for a half hour or more.  Then he came and picked up our salad plates before he served our entrees and actually left the dirty salad plates on the tray beside our cramped dungeon-like table for a long time.  To top everything off, the family behind us were the rudest, most uncouth trash I have heard or seen in some time--they need their own reality show on some trashy network.  Their 2 or 3 year old brat was allowed to screech inhumanly for their whole meal, which unfortunately overlapped ours.  When we finally got our food, it was hot (unbelievably) and tasty, but everything else about the visit was a complete and total fail.  I would be surprised to imagine that the Olive Garden franchise can condone this kind of service and atmosphere.

First was the ziti and chicken.  It came in a white sauce with pesto.  (A lot of their dishes have pesto, which may be why they named the restaurant \"Pesto's\"!)  It was very tasty, and the portion was quite reasonable.  Something different from a lot of Italian restaurants (and vastly better than most of the chains like Olive Garden).\n\nThe other dish was their Italian burger.  It was BIG.  And surprisingly good.  Very nice seasoning and toppings.  Not an ordinary burger!  Our waiter was two for two.\n\nWe had a very nice anniversary lunch.  I think it safe to say we'll be coming back.

With that said, it was possibly a foolish decision to pick the 9oz. lobster tail but at $30.99 the assumption it would be edible was made. This was a poor assumption. It was extremely tough, completely tasteless and in some parts raw. It's clear the chef was not qualified in any way to prepare this dish as a cursory glance would have told him it wasn't cooked evenly. The discovery of raw shellfish was enough to stop me in my tracks and just not bother with it anymore. But the poor quality of this was the least of my complaints come 2am. My understanding is that foodborne illness is most commonly linked to poorly washed lettuce/vegetables which I had in the form of a distinctly average Caesar salad as a starter. Perhaps I am inclined to automatically point the finger at the lobster due to its general awfulness and the overwhelming resentment of having paid close to $80 for two meals that were simply terrible. Or maybe it was the vomit streaming out of my nose for six hours. Could be a mix of both. Regardless, this was not an experience I'd ever want to repeat and despite the manager's inevitable defense, \"You may not have gotten it from here, could have been incubating\", I'm pretty sure had I bagged and tagged a sample of regurgitated Lobster, it would've been conclusive. Having not had food poisoning for a very long time, I was reminded of how grabbing a sample of puke at the time of its production is not at the forefront of your mind. Perhaps, had I'd gone to law school this would have been my first action.  Regardless of my failure to apply to and complete law school, I won't be stepping foot back in this place. In fairness, the manager did offer us a gift card as compensation. I briefly thought about giving it to someone I dislike but came to the conclusion there's no one I despise that much and so declined the offer.", "business_id": "OjNTZTZ6HYQghJN-3jmwnA", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-03-22", "type": "review"}
