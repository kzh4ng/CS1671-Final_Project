I frequent this area for business travel, and you can't do much better without heading downtown.\n\nThe seafood is excellent, with a daily menu crammed full of fresh fish specials, a raw bar, and a list of chef's specialties.  The house salad is sweet and delicious, and the 'shanghai' seafood preparation is delicious, healthy, and unique.  Try it with the scallops or a white-fleshed fish.\n\nThere is a nice selection of regional beers on tap, a decent selections of wines, and creative drinks (think elderflower and pear martinis).

We were both eating lite since a) I was dieting and b) my family was having dinner at my mother's house and she was slaving over lasagna all day, so if anyone knows anything about Italian mother's, you better arrive hungry. Back to mitchell's, I had the iceberg wedge with bacon, egg, tomatoes and a delicious home made blue cheese dressing. I also ordered a bowl of seafood gumbo which was the best gumbo I ever tasted. It wasn't overly packed with rice, as a matter of fact, there wasn't much rice at all. It was mostly shredded crab, scallops, and shrimp with a very delicate broth that wasn't too thick and the heat snuck up on you after swallowing. It wasn't a lot of heat, just enough to make it exciting. As for the iceberg wedge salad, every once in awhile I need a piece of iceberg instead of a bowl of spring mix (ie: tender weeds). The star of this salad was the chef made blue cheese dressing. It was not overly thick, very tasty and savory. It complimented the bacon and egg on the wedge. The cousin ordered the carrot cake for dessert and it was easily a pound slice. I tasted a little bite and must say it's the best carrot cake I've ever tasted. The cream cheese frosting was more buttery than \"cheesy\", it was a great surprise when you're expecting the normal cream cheese frosting. There were whole walnuts throughout the cake and many raisins, which I love. Also this recipe seems to rely on more cinnamon than I've tasted in the past. I highly recommend it. It was a wonderful lunch and I'm sure she had carrot cake to take on the plane ride back to Riverside.", "business_id": "usSROUMiAgPcxV3Ym0OxMQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-09-16", "type": "review"}

Potatoes as expected. \nOther dishes seen--fisherman's platter. Looked a little greasy, but that's expected from me in a full fried dish. Would be nice if this was offered broiled as well.

Also asked for the lobster to be served chilled with it.  Lobster came hot and was dyed a deep red color.  Why the need to put lobster in a dye?   Because...it's not Maine lobster!

First time here, wife and I sat at the bar and people watched over some WELL POURED drinks.   Strong point.  Then we screwed up and ordered food.   I got their infamous lobster roll.  Glad I had a drink.  Overcooked and dry, dry, dry. I thought lobster roll was generally made with a lobster salad-like mix.  This lobster was dry and chewy.  Lots of it, though  I guess that accounts for the high price.   I went down to Wholeys and got a much tastier one for 5 bucks.  And wife's nachos were just a big pile of chips with some toppings thrown on the top.  Then the other day,  we went back and I tried pizza.  Yuck.  The toppings were terrible (pepperoni, sausage.  how can youscrew that up, but they did.)  Two slices and boxed it up so as not to hurt the waitress' feelings.

I got the shrimp scampi entree, which comes with the vegetable of the day, salad and potatoes. The potatoes and salad were good, but the corn was very small and brown. It looked like it went bad and they cooked it anyway. Then I tasted it and knew it went bad and they cooked it anyway. That, for me, ruined my whole meal. No amount of butter and salt could save that corn. My bf got the steak with battered shrimp. He enjoyed his meal but didn't want the potatoes and corn.

I should have gone and sat there, but it was so nice out, I decided to eat on the patio. \nMy beer order was taken quickly, but then took twelve minutes to arrive.

She took my order, and pretended to care about what I was ordering, but then disappeared again. \nForty minutes later my poor lobster roll arrived. The fries were mushy, and the lobster roll took six (SIX!) napkins to sop up all the grease. I ate it, but I wasn't happy. About three bites in (and with the fastest response time of my dining experience) here comes awkward waitress again, asking if I needed anything else. I decided on another beer. She then proceeded to ask me if I minded if she smoked a cigarette before she grabbed my beer. (WHAT?!) No. Forget the beer. Bring me my check.  \nWith no tip for awkward waitress, I left.

I ordered the rosemary shrimp scampi, which came with mashed potatoes and a broccoli/carrot mix.  The mashed potatoes were lukewarm at best, and the vegetables were cold.  I ate the broccoli, but I don't like raw carrots so I didn't eat those.  It honestly looked like they just threw a handful of baby carrots onto the plate.  As for the shrimp itself, it tasted good but wasn't what I expected.  I was expecting a pasta-type dish, but it was just 5 or 6 pieces of shrimp in a garlic butter bath.  And I don't think a few pieces of shrimp and cold vegetables should cost $23, especially when I was still hungry after the meal.  To top it all off, we realized halfway into our meals that we were never given napkins.

Darren suggested the Original Oyster House for our afternoon meal. Mmmm seafood! I could go for some good seafood, especially fresh oysters! Now, I am from an area not far from the ocean, and every year we had a community oyster roast, you know: fried, steamed, and raw oysters. \n\nUmmm, yeah. Big let down. I should know better than to have high expectations. If I wanted Long John Silvers, or better still Captain D's (look it up if you never heard of Captain D's), then I'd hit up one up, AND get a friendlier server to boot. I also bet I could get into a ladies room without needing a key elsewhere, or even some SWEET N LOW for my tea! Sorry...the more I write the angrier I am getting. One thing I am starting to notice about this area, it seems acceptable to have curt or even rude service. I suppose I was jaded before.\n\nOk, the food itself. The side of coleslaw was rather good. It tasted fresh and creamy! The crabcake...(can I call it that?) was more like a clump of Stove Top Stuffing and a tiny bit of crab meat. The two jumbo fried shrimp were ok. At least they weren't too greasy. And the frigg'n \"original oyster\"... WHERE IS THE OYSTER??? Nothing but breading. I think I saw something resembling an oyster in there somewhere.

Honestly, I was a bit underwhelmed.  As you walk in, it comes across as a bit of a small, a little bit dingy, diner.  I have no problem with that, I happen to love diners, but it's not what I would expect from a place I am hoping to get good seafood.  The selection for beer with dinner was rather limited (but let's face it we weren't going there for beer, it's just something I noticed)  The service was seriously lacking.  When asking for our order, the waitress was literally on her cell phone.  I could never tell if she was paying attention to us or not.   \n\nI also found the set-up of the restaurant to be rather lacking.  It feels very claustrophobic, and while we were sitting up at the counter, a number of people bumped into me due to the fact that there is very little room to walk around.  \n\nNow, as far as the food goes, nothing was BAD, but it wasn't stellar.  Nothing on the menu seemed to be \"Great\" to me.  I ordered clam strips, and there was absolutely nothing special about them whatsoever.  They are the same clam strips I could get anywhere else I were to ever go.  There was no extra flavoring, no pizazz, nothing.  Just some strips of clam fried up.  Same goes for the french fries.  Now, the green beans I got were of note, because they were really gross.  There was no flavoring added to them whatsoever, they were just plain, boring, soggy green beans.  I was very much let down.\n\nSo all in all, if you are looking for something quick and find yourself downtown, the Original Oyster House is perfectly acceptable.  If you are looking for some place that makes very unique, delicious seafood meals, find something else.", "business_id": "-KQ283hJkBO12u8XOrlCcQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-11-26", "type": "review"}

It's clean, the staff is very polite, service was quick and the food servings are generous.\nTheir crab cake appetizers come with three of them and they are large. They could almost be an entree on their own! The sauce they serve with it complements it nicely.\nI ordered without asking how large the Captains Sampler Platter was - it was huge. Flouder, green shrimp, stuffed oyster, hush puppies, and choice of potato. I could barely finish half! The food was all satisfactory. It wasn't bad at all, but nothing really stood out either aside from the portion sizes.\nThe atmosphere is maybe a bit disappointing. It's a large seating area with very open space, but you do have to navigate your way around a bit otherwise you'll hit a dead-end. They clearly appeal to seniors - a large section of their menu is priced specifically for them. It makes for a quiet dining experience, but more dull than calm (which may not be a bad thing, depending on what you're in the mood for).  \nAll that said, I think 3 stars is appropriate. Everything was good, but the only thing that really stood out was the serving sizes. I may go back again, but I'm more inclined to explore other places.", "business_id": "W-2Tuk4uWYm5BsdlWju8wg", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-11-17", "type": "review"}

I have a few horror stories of other Red Lobster's but this one end with everyone smiling and cheering.

My parents park in those spaces and it was a hike for them to make it to the front door. I guess they want handicapped parking folks to get the most exercise  to build up for the meal. I am not sure of the planning or thoughts they have on parking. I am just thankful it was a beautiful day. \n\nEntering the restaurant and all the employees were kind and smiling. They sat us all within about 15 minutes. My father ordered his usual admiral feast, I had a lobster pizza (watching calories). Wife had a pasta dish, my mother had the stuffed founder and my kids had fries. \n\nIt was all delicious! Cooked to perfection and served timely.

The service is SLOW! We came here twice before on a Sunday. There is no waiting and we got seated right away. Thinking since they weren't so packed, that the service would be better. Not. Every time we have came here when they are busy service has been great, but when they are slow they ARE slow. Maybe not enough motivation for the staff? Don't know what's up.... However cheddar bay biscuits make life better :-)\n\n--------\nOriginal review posted September 2015 \n\nMy husband and I came here last night for all you can eat shrimp around 6:30pm. The wait for 2 was an hour n a half long so we decided to eat at the bar (no matter what time, this location always has a wait). I usually don't like eating at the bar, but our bartenders were awesome! Before we even ordered we were given the cheesy bay biscuits and waters. Score! We both ordered the all you can eat shrimp and our order came out in less than 15 minutes. We were also provided drink refills no questions asked, which was great because I hate when you sit there with an empty glass and they don't refill it without you asking. \n\nIn addition, there were 2 other couples next to us enjoying all you can eat shrimp. Eventually the bartenders caught on and starting bringing out shrimp by the dozen. Without even ordering another round they would present different shrimp options to us. It truly was all you can eat shrimp!!! It started to become humorous because at one point they brought out more shrimp, but we were all so full and no one wanted it. Needless to say we left full and with boxes of extra shrimp to take home. \n\nThe only reason why I gave this 4 stars over 5 is because we did have slow service once in the dining room, but the food was delicious so no complaints from the food category.", "business_id": "BO0zz8gort7o-6KuecIv3Q", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-09-27", "type": "review"}

I called and made reservations, they were very nice and completely accommodating over the phone.

They made us feel like movie stars, and she thought I was amazing because I had set all this up, but really it was all Capital Grille. So right away the service has set the scene for us to have an excellent night.\n\nThen came the food, we started with a round of gin and tonics, good, and a crab cake appetizer which was amazing, chunks of perfectly seasoned crab meat, and just enough to wet our appetites for the main course.  She ordered the fillet Mignon, and I got the porterhouse.  It was spectacular.  The meat is aged in a glassed in room, which you can see when you first walk in, and tastes incredibly rich, with many layers of flavor, from the smoked grilled aspect to the texture of the aged beef, ummm, I even took the bone home and gnawed on it the next day, it was that good.

I ordered the 10 Oz Fillet instead and it was served with 2 large shrimp stuffed with lump crabmeat.

Now, onto the side dishes...the Lobster Mac N Cheese is like heaven on a plate, I don't know or do I particularly care how much butter they add to it, but it is nothing short of spectacular.  Creamed Spinach is also awesome.  Cheesecake for dessert was like it came out of a magazine.

My date and I thought the decor was interesting and a change from the typical. LaVecchia's is the kind of place that's relaxed enough to where you feel comfortable and not like you're being talked down to, but upscale enough that you won't confuse it with Red Lobster. Leave the jeans at home.\n\nService: Left much to be desired. The hostess took us right to our table that I had reserved, and our waitress immediately brought us water, but it was a solid 15-20 minutes before we could flag her down to actually order any food or wine. Now, I'm no fan of the hyperactive waitresses that bother you every 5 minutes to see how you're doing, but I think we ate the entire dinner without her so much as coming by our table to see if we needed anything. I've had much better service in Charlotte on Friday nights.\n\nFood: I had the jumbo stuffed shrimp with buttermilk whipped potatoes and vegetables. Great presentation. The shrimp were stuffed with lump crab and lightly breaded-- and by lightly breaded, I mean just enough to hold the concoction together. You taste the seafood, not the breading. My date had the salmon with penne and cream sauce. The sauce was too thin for my liking, but the salmon was juicy, thick, and not overcooked/over-seasoned.\n\nWould I go back: Absolutely. It's hard for any seafood restaurant in Charlotte to beat Upstream solely in terms of food, but LaVecchia's comes close, the atmosphere is more relaxed, and you can't beat the uptown location.

I'm usually pretty generous when it comes to review because I know how hard the service industry is.  However, LaVecchia's needs to take notes, because they have a lot lacking.\n\nWe arrived at 7:25 for our 7:30 reservation.  Not all of our party was there so we were told we could wait in the building lobby and they would get our table ready soon.  At 7:45 we were still waiting, everyone was there and I had watched them seat several other tables who said they had no reservations.  So, I asked about our table and the hostess rolled her eyes and sighed and said they were still working on it.  When I mentioned that our reservation had been for earlier, she said \"well, everyone else had reservations, too, Ma'am!\" and just walked off.  I promptly labeled her the anit-hostess and another member of our party (of 5) went to find the front house manager.\n\nThe manager seated us but acted like he did us this huge favor.  We were seated in the bar, next to the patio door, so we had the bracing blasts of cold air throughout our meal as staff went in and out this door all night long.\n\nOur waiter was in no hurry to take care of us.  Once we ordered our drinks, he never came back with any more water, and one member of our party had to flag him down each time he wanted another beer.  \n\nOur food finally came and at last, redemption!!  Every single bite was perfection!  I had the filet, my husband had lobster and two others had the snapper.  Everyone oohed and ahhed over our meals.  \n\nPrice point wise I feel we got what we paid for strictly in terms of food and food quality.  The presentation was lovely, temp was good... I really could not find anything to negate the food.\n\nService is a different story.  It was painfully obvious that the wait-staff was stressed by the front manager.  He really seemed to have an attitude about even being there.  The hostess was rude and off-putting from the moment we arrived and when we were seated commented that they \"worked it out\" for us, like she had to prove something. I still don't know exactly what her deal was.\n\nBottom line:  If you want me to pay $200 for a meal, you need to act like you're glad I showed up.  Drop the bad attitude and step it up.  There are load of other upscale establishments in Charlotte that get it done.

Yes, I'm a fan of steakhouses, as much for the ambiance and service as I am the food. I like to call my visits to steakhouses, \"scotch & steak\" as that is how I roll at these places. Not the cheapest way to go, but the style that I choose. What sets The Palm at the top is its attention to service, not only to me, but everyone around me as I listened in to their conversations with other servers. Definitely a spot for loyal regulars of which I will now become one of. \n\nGot there last night around 6:30pm and sat down at the bar and ordered my scotch from Michele, who was a great bartender offering up just the right amount of conversation. The bar area is long and has plenty of seats as well as small 2-top tables behind it. When my colleague arrived we decided to grab a booth next to the bar area...this is the way to go for me as you get the bar/lounge steakhouse feel. Now for the steaks...probably the highest price in Charlotte, even a tad higher than Morton's. All steak started in the $40's and went up to the $60's. My colleague, who is a regular, went with the \"off-the-menu\" porterhouse, while I went with the new your strip. Had my standard side of mushrooms and a wedge salad to start. \n\nThe steak was cooked perfectly medium rare, with a \"Pittsburgh crust\", which adds the char to the steak. This is slightly different than a true Pittsburgh style steak, which had the char, but it cool/rare in the center. It was recommended my the waiter (thanks Tony!), and it was delicious! If you're around Southpark I would choose The Palm over Del Frisco's all day long.", "business_id": "1gKBusJMk66ypwEKF0vOAA", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-11-03", "type": "review"}

In fact, I really can't name one other business we've been to where our reviews span more than one star apart. Therefore, I'm surprised to say that, overall, The Palm didn't knock my socks off. Was it a nice meal? Yes. Was it worth the money? No. And here's the why to it all.\n\nThe place: The Palm Steakhouse, SouthPark, Charlotte-NC\nThe occasion: Our three-year wedding anniversary\nThe channel of reservation: Open Table\nThe scene: Beautiful night on the patio, very empty on a Monday evening\n\nWe made an Open Table reservation and noted that it was our wedding anniversary...it was a special night, not just a fly by for a quick steak. As mentioned, the patio is great although you really just look out into a wide driving lane that heads towards the Hampton Inn. \n\nOur server, Fernando, was top notch. Really, five stars for the service all the way around. Very formal but completely in tune with the cadence of the meal and the guest's needs. The food, however, is where I take issue...especially for the price.\n\nBeefsteak tomato Capri salad: 4/5: Big slices of bright red tomato with hunks of fresh mozzarella and basil. Props to Fernando for lightly pouring on the oil and balsamic at the table. Nice touch. \n\nChilean Sea Bass: 3/5: The fish was beautiful - really a great filet. However, I knew it would be sauteed in a white wine butter sauce, not swimmin' in it. The delicate fish was sitting in a pool and drowning in the sauce. \n\nGoat cheese whipped potatoes: 3/5: Fairly tasty mashed taters, but nothing out of the ordinary. I didn't taste too much of the goat cheese and they required a heavy hand of salt and pepper to liven them up. \n\nCreme brulee: 2/5: As some may know, I'm a total treat monster and the creme brulee came highly recommended. The flavors were bright - light with just a hint of citrus, but the bruleed top was ice cold and the middle of the creme was also super chilly. I have a feeling this was refrigerated for a long time and the texture and temperature suffered. \n\nOther notes: The shrimp cocktail is $18.90. Are you kidding me? That's insane. Also, there is not a petite filet...only a 9 oz. option for $43. This served as the reason why I went with fish instead of steak. I did, however, try a few bites of hubs' steak and it was cooked perfectly and was very well flavored. Additionally, I was a bit surprised that, considering the great service, no one wished us a happy anniversary in any way. \n\nOverall, our meal for two people, with a few drinks added in, came to $200. I'm completely fine shelling out some coin for a great meal, but The Palm fell short for me.", "business_id": "1gKBusJMk66ypwEKF0vOAA", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-09-13", "type": "review"}

It was rather loud in the restaurant in general, the hostess was friendly but nothing special, it wasn't romantic and they really didn't do anything to make you feel like you were a special guest.\n\nWe were seated in a private room initially so I was excited and hopeful.  However, our bread had not hit the table before another couple was seated RIGHT beside us.  Then, within 30 minutes 2 more tables were occupied including a family of 5.  The kids were like toddlers--WHY are they in there?\n\nMoving on...the waitress was super friendly, her \"assistant\" didn't speak english but she was helpful.  The waitress was extremely knowledgeable and really knew the menu quite well.  She even suggested a few things that were not listed on the menu.  I liked the fact that they offered 9 oz pours for the wine and they had a pretty extensive wine variety.  \n\nMy husband ended up ordering the Filet and I ordered the crab cakes because I was told these are their house specialty!  We ordered the goat cheese mashed potatoes and broccoli for our sides.  \n\nI thoroughly enjoyed the crab cakes.  Were they worth almost $40?  Not even close.  It was three small little crab clusters.  They were void any fillers which I appreciated and packed with good quality crab meat.  They were great but not worth taking out a loan over..  \n\nThe steak my husband ordered was decent but again nothing special.  The flavoring that they recommended he try was a peppercorn/olive oil sauce.  The steak honestly shouldn't need this additional flavoring but it did in this case.  It was a little chewy and it didn't melt in your mouth!  It was not flavored well on its own.  I honestly think a Ruth Chris' steak is much better!  Again, this just wasn't worth the $50 it cost.\n\nThe sides were good although there was nothing about the potatoes that tasted like goat cheese...they were just very good and creamy mashed potatoes.  The broccoli had great flavor and was cooked perfectly--not too crunch and not soggy--just how I like it!\n\nWe didn't have time for dessert (catching a play uptown) but their menu looked decent.  We were told to try their donuts.  I'm sure they are good.  I think it would have been nice if they offered a free dessert or something special because it was our anniversary.  \n\nRoundup?  I expected more, especially for the price point.  I'm telling you I can go into Ruth's or Sullivans or Terra and many other restaurants that are not as expensive and have a better overall dining experience.  I can't figure out why someone would choose the Palm over all the other great steakhouses in the area.  They are more expensive and offer less quality and a worse environment.

We did split a chocolate mousse cake which was a hit, and there were some seasonal additions that sounded intriguing.  Gingerbread cheesecake or something along those lines.

When my wife and I moved to Charlotte last year this is one of the first restaurants that we found that satisfied our seafood craving. A year later and this is by far the BEST seafood that we've found. We've been here 4 or 5 times in the past year. The seafood, sushi and steak (and the mussels) were all great. But we really really love the Costa Rican Chocolate dessert. It's excellent. The waitstaff is terrific. Very informative, attentive and friendly. It's a nice place for a date. It also has a really nice outdoor seating area to hang out and have a few drinks, appetizers or desserts. The only thing that I probably wish would change is the bar. It's quite spacious and seems to have a nice selection of beer and wine. I just didn't really enjoy the atmosphere of it. It seemed to be more appealing to an older crowd.

Hold on you might be balking at the hefty sticker tag on this brunch but let me tell you about all the stuff you can well...stuff yourself with and you'll be singing praises too after you try this joint out.\n\nThis being one of my last weekends in Charlotte the boyfriend and I went with a yelpy crew consisting of Travis W., Melissa B., Chad E., And Denise. First off you walk in get greeted and led to your table and handed a nice tapas menu. They could've charged $7-10 for most of the items on this tapas menu and made a killing but nope they're giving it to you as part of the buffet, score! I tried the scallop risotto, crab benedict, belgian waffle, and some other things all excellent! But wait it doesn't stop there you walk into the bar area and BAM! you're hit with a massive buffet of brunch items. You want some smoked salmon and mushrooms folded into your freshly made omelet? No problem. Add some excellently carved prime rib onto that you got some good eats. I was so full before I even got halfway through working on this buffet.\n\nThis place has met my expectations for lunch, dinner, and now brunch. Hopefully I am back in Charlotte soon to give it another whirl. Though dinner is a bit expensive and they do need to tell you the prices of the specials lest you order a $45 bento box like I did, the staff is incredibly accomodating and attentive to your needs.

Much to my excitement, I won a gift card in a charity fundraiser at work that allowed me to pay them a visit and taste what I might be missing.\n\nMy boyfriend and I went on a Sunday evening at 5:30. We figured we'd miss the crowds that way, and sure enough, it was much emptier than I expected after reading all the reviews. We were promptly seated - the decor was very classy, but not in an overdone way.\n\nOur waiter was very friendly and attentive. He made some very detailed recommendations of food and wine that were accurate, and his subtle jokes and jabs made us feel like we were chatting with a good friend.\n\nWe started off with the chef's choice of oysters - 6 of them. They were delicious but also very small, and I wasn't feeling like we got our money's worth at all. Maybe it was because they were East Coast? Regardless, I wouldn't buy them at that price again.\n\nI was jonesin' for some Asian flair, so I my chosen entree was the Togarashi Dusted Big-Eye Tuna, rare. The tuna was tasty and high quality, and the sauce it was in was pleasurably tangy. The waiter had told me to expect it to be spicy, but I didn't find it spicy at all - maybe the seasoning on the tuna had a subtle kick, but not much. What surprised me most was the rice cake. I was almost as excited about it as the tuna, which is definitely not something I expect for rice! It is a clump of sushi rice that is quickly dipped into a flash-fryer to crisp the outside into something so perfect that I'm considering buying a fryer just to try to replicate it. Combined with the sauce, it was divine. My one complaint about the dish was the pickled veggies that are stacked on top. I thought the sauce was super tangy all by itself - the pickled flavor was just all too much. I couldn't eat them. But I cleaned the rest of my plate happily!\n\nMy boyfriend got the Scottish Salmon, which he also really enjoyed, especially the curry sauce that went along with it. He cleaned his plate completely! He is gluten allergic, and the waiter was very patient to go through the whole menu with him in detail and let him know what could be made gluten-free. They do not have a separate gluten-free menu.\n\nOur bill came out rather high - 2 glasses of wine, 6 oysters, and 2 main courses came out at $90. We weren't concerned with the gift card in tow, but even with the great quality, it seemed kind of steep.\n\nAll in all, if you think a well-rounded meal for 2 at $90 is nothing to sneeze at, then by all means, visit Upstream! Otherwise, I'd save it for a special occasion.", "business_id": "BOp3jcpYy31M85H1DLnEEw", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-09-02", "type": "review"}

The decor is indeed cozy- like a nicely made-up cellar.  There was plenty of room at the bar so we sat there before our reservation time arrived.  Only two beers on tap, but both good local brews from Capital. \nEventually sat at our table & perused the menu.  Found many appetizers that sounded really good (including one of the specials that night) so we decided on sharing 2 apps and one entree... seemed like a good way to try a few items without getting too much food.\nApp #1 (the special): gnocchi in a savory cream sauce with crawfish was very tasty.  Seemed a bit light in the gnocchi (I think there were 5 or 6) but made up for it in sauce.  Two thumbs way up.\nApp #2: mussels in cream sauce... I had asked about the size of the mussels ahead of time and was told they were medium to large.  They were in fact medium to small, which was a bit of a bummer because we probably would have gone with a different app had we known.  But the flavors were good & we enjoyed sopping up the sauce with the bread.  And the bread they serve is quite good.  Two thumbs up.\nEntree: Crawfish Etouffe... I was excited to try this as I hadn't had etouffe in years.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either.  If you went to a friend's house for dinner and they served this you'd be psyched, but at an upscale Cajun restaurant for $20 you may be left underwhelmed.  Two thumbs halfway up.  The salad that came with was fresh mesclun greens, with a bleu cheese dressing that was chunky but bland.\nMidway thru our meal the jazz combo started up and sounded really good- definitely added to the atmosphere.  For dessert we shared a slice of key lime pie... nice-tasting but no great shakes.  It seemed to be thickened with gelatin and I suppose I prefer mine to be creamier, plus it was lacking in zing, but only mildly.  Again, if your friend served it you'd rightfully congratulate them but for $6.50 it should be REALLY good.\nOur server was very nice & professional.  Absolutely no complaints there.\nThe nicest surprise came with the bill- only $70... and that included 5 drinks.\nWe have concluded that the next time we go we'll sit in the bar area and have drinks & apps.", "business_id": "koRLvzIl-4fCybOIdk56jA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-09-20", "type": "review"}

The waitress was not very friendly and did not smile.  She was making the motions.  Likely tired because it was Badger Homecoming Saturday and they were busy.  We were celebrating a birthday and asked if they did anything special.  She said I don't know and can check.  When she came back she said if you buy a desert, we can put a candle in it.  What??  What restaurant does not do something for a birthday.  Oh well, move on...\n\nEach of us DID enjoy our meal.  We had the Crawfish Cheesecake for appetizer.  It was like a cheesecake?  Different and good.  Two of us ordered separate specials and the other two ordered items off the menu.  None of us could finish and we enjoyed leftovers the next day.  The food was rich and heavy, comfort food like.

The cheese sauce was very hearty and rich, served over linguini pasta. \n\nThe food took a little on the long side to come out, but it was well worth the wait.

I've also had their margaritas and micheladas they are the perfect drinks to enjoy with Mariscos!! if you are not used to traditional Mexican seafood this place might not be for you.... they have a jukebox which is always playing Spanish music which is awesome if you were raised with this type of music. The prices are pretty reasonable as well for the amount of food you get. I truly enjoy the food and service here!!! Be adventurous and check it out!!!", "business_id": "VKxn7zmp8nOYT-ZHFZTjgA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-10-14", "type": "review"}

My son liked it so much he had one as an appetizer, and another larger one as his main course.\n\nMy brother then had Grilled Octopus - very tasty and tender. I ordered the Fish Grilled in Garlic Sauce. Amazingly fresh, and done (not overdone) just right. Both platters came with  rice. beans, salad, and under the fish - French Fries! Not at all soggy. And the warm tortillas and spicy salsa let you build a few tacos along the way.\n\nWe washed everything down with several Mexican beers, at  4 bucks a bottle, the same as they charge for for 'domestic' beer (although domestic here would probably be Mexican). Friendly waitress and patrons, and even though we were the only gringos in the place, we felt right at home.\n\nThe three meals, as above, with tax, tip and beers came out to only about $70.

We agreed the green culuchi sauce bathing six shrimp was instantly forgettable. My fish had about 150 pin bones and less meat than a small can of tuna fish. That's not an attempt at humor. I can debone a fish and there was less meat on this crispy carcass than a standard 6 oz can of tuna, as if they extracted most of it for their own devices, leaving me with little more than skin, bones and an eyeball.  \n\nIt's hardly a crummy place on the inside - the decor is cute and colorful.

However, my aunt and I read some reviews and used our best cajoling to get her out of her mu mu and into the car to visit this little restaurant just down the way from Ranch Market. \n\nWhen we walked in, I was excited by the colors and festive feel that they have. We were greeted by the owner who is very attentive, and seated straight away. Having read the Yelp! reviews, I knew I was going to aim for the camarones culichi, and gazed at their vast options anyhow. I consider myself pretty seafood savvy! They have such an array of fish dishes that I long to try! Especially their fish soup... it looked amazing. However, I stuck to my trusted reviews and ordered the camarones culichi, my mother ordered the garlic shrimp, and my aunt ordered the fried fish filet. \n\nI know they said not to fill up on the chips and salsa-- but that green salsa made me so happy, I think I will order a pint to take home next time I go. Trust me. \n\nFirst, they brought by little ceviche tostadas to try-- I was so excited that the fish tasted so fresh and delightful. Also, free ceviche? I have no idea if they do this all the time, but what a deal! It had a chipotle and citrus flavor immersed in it and was light, but very satisfying. \n\nThe culichi sauce is full of tomatillo, cilantro, garlic, and lime-- however, their combination is so magical, I cannot express it without salivating. The shrimp are cooked in the sauce and brought out separate from the salad, beans, and rice, and they have the same amazing taste. I will seriously write a poem for how that sauce tastes-- and they give you plenty of fresh tortillas that I wrapped the beans and rice with and dipped in that sauce to ensure I got every last drop. You could taste the freshness of the fish even in the fried fish, which was seasoned and fried to perfection. The \"exquisite salad\" that they offer with every meal really is exquisite, while simple and melds to the meals well since there isn't a strong dressing on it. \n\nThe point is, we left so amazingly joyful and thanked the owner about ten times.

I know some people would never come to this part of town...they are missing out!  \n\nI love walking into the restaurant to their colorful decors.  Once you are seated, you will get a generous portion of freshly made warm tortilla chips with a red and a green salsa, no questions asked.  They don't care if you're going to order later on...here, have some chips and salsa!  They have a full bar and a TV with sports playing all the time.  Now you can have some drinks with free chips and salsa while watching a game.  Once you order, they will bring you a tostada with ceviche.  It's on the house.  Their ceviche is fresh and flavorful without being overpowered by excessive lime.\n\nAs for entrees, I would recommend....\n- shrimp culichi\n- fish tacos\n- grilled shrimp\n- fried fish in garlic sauce\n- molcajete\n- any types of ceviche\n\nMost dishes come with a side of beans, rice, salad, and flour/corn tortillas.

You can taste how fresh and delectable the combination of ingredients is. I've had plenty of ceviche in Latin American countries and theirs is on par. \n\nThe selection here is ridiculous, but in a good way. I ended up going simple and ordering some shrimp tacos. You get 3 tacos with rice, beans, and salad. The tacos don't include any filler ingredients like Americans prefer. Just straight up shrimp smothered in oozing melted cheese. Can't get much more legit than that. The rice, beans, and salad were all pretty typical and were a good compliment to the meal. \n\nThank you Marisocs Playa Hermosa for fulfilling my friend's craving for amazing legit Mexican food after being stuck in the Romney infested part of Colorado for a year.

I don't know how else to describe my dinner there.  My husband and I were in Phoenix for a long weekend and wanted some good Mexican food.

Within a few minutes, we were offered beers and tortilla chips.  We opted for guacamole to compliment our tortillas, the former of which I was suspicious at first because of the seemingly runny consistency.  Boy, was I wrong - the guac was tangy and full of flavor. I would love to have their recipe!    \n\nBased on other review, we opted for the molcajete for our main curse.  It. Was. Off. The. Hook.  It arrived in a medium-sized, deep bowl, filled half-way with a delicious spicy cheesy gray.  Along the sides of the bowl are shrimp, chicken, beef and scallops.  We just kind of pushed all the meats into the sauce and then dug in.  And while this dish is meant to serve up to 4 persons, we totally killed it and finished every bite.

He then proceeded to take the other tables' orders. (Perfectly fine). Oh and they had both food and drink menus as this comes back later in the story.\n\nWe waited for a solid 10 min before trying to flag down the waiter....NOTHING.

I was expecting to dine here but it was much more similar to a diner experience were you get whammed bammed and thank you'd as we were in and out in a jiffy.\n\nMy husband loves classic Italian Foods and according to reviews Christo's seemed like a top destination. Honestly in general the food was OK but not great and nothing I'd drive out of my way for. I almost never consider service as part of my review since it varies all the time everywhere but in this case it sort of even lessened the experience so MUCH that I have to consider it otherwise I would have given Christo's three stars.\n\nOur waiter quickly greats us and ask if we want the menu or the restaurant week special. Despite being around 70 years old he was very quick talking and very speedy and sort of made us nervous but what really bothered me the most was him  and his helpers standing there not to far from us with his arms crossed just watching us like a hawk eating the whole time. \n\nNow the food.\n\nI started with a Christo's Caesar Salad. I could tell the dressing was house made as well as the croutons. The dressing wasn't properly emulsified nor was it balanced in flavors and was super heavy with lemon. The croutons were crisp and buttery. I pointed out the faults since I know them but it really was an OK salad. I do note I wasn't offered fresh ground pepper, nicer restaurants do offer fresh ground pepper for Caesar Salads.\n\nI was sort of excited to have the classic dish Sole Meuniere here. The Christo's Version is nontraditional as the fish seemed heavily coated (maybe battered not sure) with flour in a lemon white wine sauce in stead of a traditional lightly floured and prepared in browned butter. The fresh spinach on the side was just plain without anything on it. \n\nDesserts seemed house made and were OK. We both liked the lemon cake better over the mousse.\n\nA glass of house wine was included with our dinners and during the meal we finished it and my husband ordered another round. He noticed a price difference from the menu and questioned our server. The server confirmed it wasn't the same price as the menu and said that for restaurant week they up charge the wine. It was only a few dollars but I feel this is bad business and not good for customer relations.\n\nI was really torn between two and three stars but the surprise of the wine up charge, being really rushed though dinner and with the waiter and his help all standing across from us just watching us the whole time in a unprofessional way sort of spoiled the dining experience.\n\n2.5 Stars", "business_id": "3CSaqRNvYg7ZdN2zwxwzVw", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-09-28", "type": "review"}

Being from Italy, I always have the urge to check out new places, and when I saw \"Italian cuisine\" I had to stop and test it. As I walked in, I immediately felt welcome. Kelsie, the bartender, was very nice and friendly. Excellent start, since the authentic Italian culture is based on welcoming and well-mannered people. Food was outstanding as well. I had the mozzarella caprese followed by the special of the day: halibut piccata. But what really impressed me was the dessert: limoncello cake!!!

But as of October 30, 2015, I will have to change my rating.  We had dinner reservations for 4 people and were looking forward to a great meal. \nWe were seated at our table and waited quite a few minutes for our waiter to come over. When he did arrive there was no greeting of welcome, how are you etc. He only asked what we wanted to drink. We were not able to tell him since he did not bring over the wine menu. When he did return he brought the wine menu and the dinner menu but we had to ask him what the specials were.  We placed our drink and hors d'oeuvre selections and while we were waiting for our selections, a group of six were seated behind us dressed in halloween costumes and acted as if they owned the restaurant. Our server waited on them and brought out wines/drinks and salads to them before we had any items on our table.  This group behind us were definitely in \"party mode\" as they were getting louder and louder. After we finished our soup and salad, the noise level from that table was now at disaster level. We were not able to hear or speak to anyone at our table due to the noise. We asked to move and were seated in the bar area where it was much quieter.  Our entrees were delivered but our server did not come back to our table to see if everything was alright or if we needed anything.We were going to order more wine but since no one came over we cancelled the idea. We had to ask other servers to bring bread etc. So definitely the evening was very disappointing for us and most likely a return visit is not in the future. What was really disappointing is the fact that the managerial staff did not seem to care that we were inconvenienced by other rude customers\nwho had no regard for anyone else in the restaurant.", "business_id": "3CSaqRNvYg7ZdN2zwxwzVw", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-10-31", "type": "review"}

Lone Star is one of the restaurants consistently in our orbit. We used to dine here for special occasions. Unfortunate circumstances put us into lots more restaurants for meals these days. \n\nOur favorite foods, like so many other Yelp*ers are the pork chops with sweet potato on the side. Cinnamon & butter on the side please. Mom goes big for the half rack of ribs and sweet potato. We usually take half home. I enjoy the salad wedge/steak wedge or steak salad. I'm taking a liking to the French Dip, Sweet D is eating burgers more these days with their fat, hand formed sirloin patties. \n\nSpeaking of hand formed, Lone Star's steaks are aged off-site, but are hand cut in the back room. The bleu cheese dressing, all sauces and the cobbler-type desserts are made on-premises. The Bovarian brown bread appetizer loaves and baguettes arrive from Texas by truck. Does SB 1070 allow that? Salted peanuts are no longer automatic, frequency of allergenic attack made them a \"by request only\" item. \n\nKera, Assistant Manager is on the floor, circulating and greeting. She and one other cafe owner are the top circulators where we eat. We've spoken with Joe, the Manager off and on, and another manager some years back. \n\nService is attentive, as mentioned by several other reviewers. My glass is never half empty. We're getting to know Jasmina of the many pens. She and Sweet D are passionate about office supplies. \n\nLone Star is a chain, which BTW Yelp*ers, corporate reads your reviews. My mind keeps it in on the same steak house shelf as two other steak house chains. We've been to all three. Lone Star is the place we return. Price, quality, service, close to where out evening business keeps us. I suggest the old bald plastic cacti be replaced. Someone plucks spines obsessively. I wonder if someone has a Lone Star cactus spine stash at home? \n\nSomebody snarked away on Lone Star, with a mixed list of chains and locally owned places to eat. Rate chains with chains, local with locals, its only fair. Unless you've had one two many giant margaritas, then you'll say whatever you want no matter what. \n\nThis place is fine. I guarantee we'll be back.

Although the service was just fine and the bread & cheese fries were tasty, the rest of the food was either wholly unremarkable or completely unsatisfactory.\n\nI ordered the 8 oz. sirloin (so cold and purple throughout that it could walk off the plate on its own; I know, go ahead and make a face...), with saut\u00e9ed mushrooms and a house salad (no onions, extra ranch dressing) as my sides.\n\nThe salad was very plain and had nothing about it to distinguish it from any other salad anywhere (including one you would make at home or one that you would get from any buffet salad bar anywhere in the nation). I did not expect the salad to be the highlight of the meal, but usually there is something (a spiced up ranch dressing, flavored croutons, etc) that add to uniqueness of a 'house' salad. Not this time. Meh.\n\nWhen my entr\u00e9e showed up, the steak was warm, light pink throughout, rubbery, and absolutely flavorless. No rub, no marinade, and the cut had clearly either been recently frozen or sitting in a fridge for an extended period of time because the flavor of oxidation was rife. Please note that I never expect there to be marinades or rubs on a steak, but then I do expect the cut to stand up on its own (which it did not in this case).\n\nThe saut\u00e9ed mushrooms were particularly disappointing. I love saut\u00e9ed mushrooms. Adore them. I require nothing more than a little butter or oil on them and then just go to town in that pan! The mushrooms I received were a mix of mushrooms that had been saut\u00e9ed to the point of shriveled brown lumps and those that had been held over a warm microwave for 15 seconds. On top of this odd culinary spectrum, there seemed to be nothing but water on them, which didn't do anything to assist in the flavor. A quarter through the meal, I'd had enough and claimed a full tummy (a white lie... forgive me).\n\nAlthough the server was kind and competent, the food was a severe let down and I would never return to this or any other location.

It was so beautiful outside when we went, the misters were refreshing, and when we looked up, there was a beautiful (and unexpected) view of the mountains across Camelback.", "business_id": "MU3i2uEyUBntebU6pEyMbw", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-09-17", "type": "review"}

Not so when I bring up seafood at McCormick & Schmick's!  We both enjoy the sour dough table bread and butter that is only given when requested.  Lunch items are decent in prices and portions.  I find that the dayshift staff here are more friendly and efficient than the night shift.  The lunch meals flowed very smoothly: glasses always full and extra hot bread brought to the table when asked (w/out our having to repeat ourselves).  Happy hour and dinner services are something else entirely.\n\nI don't deny that happy hour apps are nicely priced.  I've only experienced HH here once, and it took awhile before I found a table I wanted to sit at (outside was noisy and smoky, and the only chairs available by the bar inside were at the ends).  It took quite some time before my server arrived.  I usually only order HH apps since I rarely drink, but she told me I had to order a drink, any drink that costs at least $2.75, before I could take advantage of the HH app specials.  So I ordered my first (and so far, my last) Arnold Palmer, which is a beverage that is half-tea and half-lemonade.  For apps, I tried the clam strips, fish tacos, and the cheeseburger and fries.  I thought the clam strips were too bread-y: not much clam-meat, just batter and seasoning.  It tasted pre-frozen.  The fish tacos were decent, but not filling.  The star app here were the cheeseburger and fries!  The burger was HUGE!!  The fries were numerous in quantity, too!  The pleasant surprise in the value of the burger and fries mitigated the disappointment I felt over the clam strips.  One huge complaint, however, was the fact that my server only saw me once, and that was to get my drink and appetizer orders.  She never came back to check on whether I would like another drink or something else from the HH and dinner menus.  \n\nMom and I had dinner here last night (Saturday).  I couldn't believe how dead it was, considering it was only 8:15p.  We already knew we wanted to order the Dungeness crab and shrimp bisque for her and the mixed grill special for me (salmon, seabass with coconut rice and asparagus, and the shrimp-crabcake, which Mom could have since I have a shrimp allergy (sob!  I LOVE crabcakes!).  The mixed grill entree also comes with creme brulee!  Mom wasn't sure which size soup to order, but our male server told us that the cup was very small in portion, so I asked for the bowl (which, in the end, was too much).  We also asked for bread, which thankfully arrived within a few minutes.  The soup took another ten minutes.  Mom didn't think it was anything special.  Indeed, she thought that the Red Lobster bisque we enjoyed in Illinois years ago was much better.  I do remember the bread bowls of deliciousness from years past; we loved the chunkiness of the RL bisque, as well.  I told her that the higher-tabbed venues seem to serve less-chunky and more silky-smooth pureed bisques (we both agreed that chunky bisques are the best!). The mixed grill took more than 40 minutes from the time I placed the order, which is unacceptable.  Grilled seafood doesn't take long to cook!!  The entree was very delicious, though, but I would be hard-pressed to order it again if it is going to take this long to prepare.  I was also disappointed to see that the coconut rice contained *.  I LOVE *, but my immune system doesn't, and nowhere in the menu description was it mentioned that * were included.  Mom took the tainted half, but I still ended with vertigo and painful abdominal cramps from eating the \"clean\" half (it seemed like the rice was pre-molded in a tiny bowl or ice-cream scoop with the * in the bottom of the mold, and then placed onto the plate).  The * looked beautiful in the presentation (and Mom thought the rice tasted fine), but had I known sooner, I'd have requested them to be omitted, or at least be placed on the side.  I loved the salmon and the seabass, which were perfectly seasoned, but I found the rice too squishy, as if too much liquid was used.  The sticks of asparagus were perfectly crunchy and great in flavor!  Mom absolutely loved the crabcake... I was so jealous!  Service was objectionable: long waiting time, 2nd request for bread was forgotten, and the wait times for the seafood, brulee (yum!), and ticket were too long in between.\n\nHope to give a favorable happy hour update!  I'd like to try some of those grilled salmon cakes Stevie P. mentioned.  I'll have to take everybody's word on the margaritas' goodness... Not much of a drinker to justify my spending $10 on one drink.  (Although, Roy's Hawaiian Martini is definitely worth paying $10 for... so smooth!)", "business_id": "MU3i2uEyUBntebU6pEyMbw", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-11-10", "type": "review"}

It's a good thing I enjoy smooth jazz.\n\nChose the French onion soup starter, the Kona-crusted sirloin steak entree, and cheesecake w/ fresh berries sauce to finish.  I really enjoyed the onion soup- salty from the cheese, yet just enough sweetness from the caramelized onions.  I really liked how some areas of the cheese that blanketed the bowl were crispy!  I thought perhaps it was the bread that sometimes one would find below the cheese, but no, it was the cheese itself.  Wished the whole piece was crunchy...\n\nI absolutely adored the Kona-crusted sirloin.  Cooked to medium- perfect!- and I could taste the coffee, too, and not just feel the texture of coffee grains, as I've ordered similar entrees from other venues, but never tasted the intended effect.  The caramelized shallot cream sauce absolutely floored me!  One of the best sauces that has graced my lips :)  Mmm... The entree came with two standard sides (no substitutes allowed, or at least that was what I was told) of creamed spinach and smashed red potatoes.  Both were delightful- decadently rich and creamy.  Before I forget, the table bread basket (seeded dinner rolls and lavosh) was good, especially the seeded rolls.  You may also order toasted sourdough if you have food allergies to avoid.\n\nStepping back down, but not much, from the piece de resistance (in this meal, the standout was the steak), was the creme brulee cheesecake w/ berry sauce w/ fresh berries!  Simply incredible!   While I had to return the more beautiful (more caramelized sugar crust) first offering, untouched, due to food issues, the second was less visually stunning, but tasted divine.  I should've asked for more sauce on the side, as I ended up taking some home.

Litterally driving into the parking lot of a few other well known restaurants and going \"no...not feeling it\", and driving out of the parking lot without stopping.   I was intent on trying some place new.  Honestly I don't know what made me park and come into TCG, and even then when I walked in I was about ready to turn around, I wasn't wanting so upscale but decided to just go in and grab a seat at the bar.  \nMy indeciseiveness that night extended into trying to choose what to drink and what to eat.  The bartender and the lady sitting next to me highly recommend the Stoli Doli, house infused pineapple vodka martini.  Why not? What a great recommendation.  Wonderfully simple, slightly sweet pineapple goodness in a martini glass.  \nLooking over the bar menu, I then asked for the full menu.  Wow the Wine list is IMPRESSIVE.  The menu options matched the rich darkness in the restaurant.  Sultry and romantic...I can see why there were so many couples here enjoying the ambiance.  The service is as impressive as the wine list.\nI finally decided, but I question my own combination of what I chose.  Obviously not that hungry, I choose the Wagyu beef carpaccio and a wedge salad( this is where I wonder what was I thinking).  I would have much happier in the end had I just had the carpaccio.   Not that it was bad....just so didn't do the restaurant justice.   It's not ment to stand out on its own.  But it satisfied something at the moment.  The rich blue cheese dressing and bacon...unfortunately iceburg lettuce is never stellar even with the dressing.\nThe Wagyu carpaccio was beautifully plated.  Lightly seared exterior and rare interior of thinnly sliced beef accompanied by a portion of lightly dressed arugula salad and parmagian cheese.   The seared exterior had a seasoning that I am not sure that added to the dish.  I appreciate carpaccio for its simplicity. However that was my only \"issue\" and it didn't keep me from enjoying the dish.  The richness of the wagyu and the peppery arugula were perfect together.  Including tip my vist was around $50.\nNext time I will go with a friend or 3 who are ready for a fine meal.", "business_id": "QdbZyl-LWFS54u93Vjd5SA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-09-05", "type": "review"}

We went after late evening at work...my environment is pretty casual, so I was in t-shirt and shorts. Even on a Tu night it seemed the general atmosphere was business casual.  We were greeted and seated as soon as we came in and appeared no judgments were made. We then waited.  ....and waited.....and waited.  I was beginning to wonder if they didn't like my attire or something.  We noticed it seemed there was a huddle between the wait staff wondering who would take our table. Still no one.  I got up to use the rest room and when I got back my lady said they were bringing out some calamari on the house for our wait.  Sweet!  I generally don't care one anyone the other about calamari...but theirs was really good.  A bit of. A spice, a little kick...but quite tasty.  The waiter was extremely apologetic about our wait and was on top of everything afterwards.  I got the bone in sirloin, lady the filet.  Both were very tasty and cooked to our liking.  The mashed potatoes were delicious...creamy and buttery tasting.  Green beans tasty and crisp.  The espresso chocolate cake dessert...oh my was it rich.  A little chocolate sauce or more raspberry sauce would have been a welcome addition to the dollop of whip cream and raspberries but it was still tasty.. \n\nBut the final action that really put the experience over the top was when the bill was supposed to come and instead the manager said dinner was on them.

We were both let down that we weren't going to be able to take our annual vacation to Maine to see her Dad and eat lots of yummy fresh seafood.  We love lobster bisque, lobster rolls, baked stuffed lobster, and just about lobster anything.  Oh yeah, and baked stuffed shrimp too.\n\nSo this was supposed to be our \"mini-getaway\" since we were homebound for the summer.  We were both a little let down to be honest.  She chose Steamers because their online menu said they had lobster bisque.  Well, we got to the restaurant and they didn't have lobster bisque.  I had the special, swordfish au poivre, and it was good, but very rich, and wasn't feeling very well a few hours later.  The wine list wasn't as extensive and one would expect for a nice seafood restaurant in Phoenix.  I have to say that in general, the food wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything special, but it was very expensive. We agreed that next time we wanted a good bowl of bisque we'd go next door to the Capital Grille", "business_id": "OypZxwm-jS9QfUwgBmzeyw", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-09-03", "type": "review"}

We had a specially memorable evening, as everything was perfect, or just near. The wines we chose in the wine flights were particularly palatable, as was the food (though they lost points when the server had no idea about a couple of wines we asked about). The appetizers were nice little meals on their own - she had the lobster in lettuce cups, I the Ahi tuna Tartar stack, which was nice, sans the tortilla chips instead of...toast points, maybe? I had the cioppino for entree, which, for a seafood lover like me, was just sheer bliss. My date had the tilapia, which we both thought was a tad on the \"swampy\" side, though it was still edible enough. We finished with key lime pie for her, and the chocolate s'more souffle pour moi, which we both gobbled with the abandon only dedicated gourmands can know. All in all, a wonderful evening. Our dinner came to close to $90, but I felt it was worth it. \n\nOne of the nits we had was the decor, once the lights started to come up at the end of the night. Steamers, you need new chairs and tables. We thought they looked like they belonged at Golden Corral, not in an otherwise opulently decorated space with old world ambience.

The menu was a dizzying selection of Mexican seafood that was almost overwhelming.  She brought us some chips and salsa, they were tasty, but the chips would have been even more delicious if they been served warm.  I liked the salsa, it was a brownish, low heat salsa that I've never had before.  It was pleasant.\n\nI ordered the shrimp chevice tostada and since he's allergic to shellfish (the poor bastard) the husband had the cheese enchiladas.  We also ordered a side of rice for the baby.  \n\nMy tostadas were okay, but they were store bought tostadas (because deep frying a fresh corn tortilla for each new diner is too much work?) and the shrimp chevice was way too limey (the overwhelming flavor) and not nearly spicy enough.  I would have preferred a few thinly sliced jalapenos and maybe some more cilantro in the mixture.\n\nThe red sauce on my husband's enchiladas looked watery and artificial and just like canned tomato sauce.  It didn't look very authentic, or good, BUT he swore it tasted okay.  (His tummy was also feeling a tad funny the rest of the day, but that could have been from almost anything else too.)\n\nThe baby's rice was nice.  It was served with peas, carrots, green beans and corn and it tasted quite good.  Also, the waitress served the baby first and gave her a plastic spoon which was thoughtful.  I suspect the waitress is also a mommy and that's why she got the baby's food out first and knew to give her a plastic spoon... ;)\n\n\nOur bill for 2 iced teas, 2 shrimp chevice tostadas, cheese enchiladas and a side of rice was about $23.00.

It is the ultimate in party cuisine and a great experience, plus the food seems that much better cooked in front of you.  Somehow though Phoenix remains without a great Teppan restaurant.\n\nMy nephew is an Asian food junkie and loves Teppan, so for his birthday we really wanted to give him a great experience and Sakana remained one of two places in town we have not tried so onward...\n\nWe were sat immediately about 15 minutes prior to our reservation and quickly ordered drinks and sushi.  After reading other reviews I walked over to the sushi bar and looked at the day's specials.  We ordered two types of Nigiri off the special board and then Uni and Spicy Scallops.  For my nephew we got a spicy tuna roll.  There was nothing wrong with any of it.  The sushi had a clean taste and was very good.  It was a pleasant surprise.\n\nThe teppan started with a decent soup and salad.  The show itself was good, not great.  The portions of the meats were astonishing, absolutely huge.  Same with the veggies.  The rice was good and came in the standard cup.  A little odd was that the rice and veggies were an add on for an additional $3.  Not a big deal but just different.  Overall all the meats and the shrimp were okay.  I took a piece of my husband's steak as Teppan steak I always feel has the best flavor for steak from my perspective as a non steak eater, and it tasted like typical steak.\n\nSo basically the whole food experience was a standard.  Nothing really standing out, nothing bad.  On the other side was the service.  Lackadaisical is the word that comes to mind.    My sister said she felt she bussed our table.  Since our party of 4 was alone at the teppan table we kept passing her our dishes to put on the other end as not one thing was removed from the table.  Think about the number of items I mentioned having and how many dishes that means!  I had to ask to get water and tea refills and my glasses were removed and returned in the most bizarre way.  A pitcher could have been so much simpler.  It took a good 15 minutes for my sister's beverage to come from the bar.  It was almost an hour before the teppan chef came over.  \n\nThe server though was personable enough that the non-service service was less irritating than it might have been in other circumstances.  I doubt I will be back, but it wasn't a bad experience and for someone in the Ahwatukee area i would say if they have time and don't have a ton of money to spend on Teppan or sushi it is not  a bad choice.", "business_id": "0vzZ_Bcb02rJljeMU9XkBw", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-10-30", "type": "review"}

I've now gone twice because my friend stands by it being the best in the area.  Every time I've gone, the servers completely ignore us.  During the first time, it took about 10 minutes to get a menu.  Maybe another 15 to get a simple gin & tonic.  When the server finally decided to come back around to see if we wanted to eat (we'd been looking for her for a while) we ordered a small amount of food.  20 minutes later a new server delivers the food (which was warm and awful).  We sat around for about 15 more minutes waiting for our checks (which were delivered by yet another new person).  They finally take our money and also take their sweet time bringing back the change.  I will openly admit that I did not tip.   I forgot to mention that this was at night.  It was a little busy, but eventually completely died.  After the crowd disappeared, we still got completely ignored.\n\nThe second time I decided to give it a chance, we went for lunch.  The service was a bit better.  I could only assume that the other person helping our server was the manager.  He flat-out lied to my face, which upset me very much.  I asked for a gin & tonic again.  The server goes to put that drink order in and the manager comes up to me saying their out of both gin and tonic.  I ordered a vodka cranberry instead.  It was awful.  Probably no vodka in it.  My friend pointed to the shelves of liquor where there stood in plain sight a bottle of Tanqueray and a bottle of Bombay.  Thanks manager for being such an asshole.  Once again the food came out at a warm temperature.  It was very hard to keep down.  \n\nAfter the 2nd trip, I've decided not to come back.  It's awful service, management, and mediocre food.

I'm not sure how long the happy hour lasts, but we came at 7 pm and got to take advantage of it.  They have about 10 rolls on their HH menu for only $4-5 each.  We thought the rolls would be really small bc the waitress told us they would only come with 5 pieces (instead of the 8 pieces from the regular menu) but they were just as big as rolls that I'm used to eating.  I ordered an appetizer and two rolls and I actually had to take one entire roll home because I was soooo full.\n\nFor appetizer I got agedashi tofu.  It was different than I'm used to, because the tofu pieces were pretty small, but there were a LOT of them. I'm used to larger, but fewer, pieces of tofu.  The sauce they had it in was delicious and spot on.  But I think that they do not dip the tofu in potato starch like other places do bc the outside wasn't that slippery chewy texture, it was straight up just fried tofu.  I probably would not order this dish again.\n\nFor my rolls I got spicy tuna and scallop dynamite.  The spicy tuna was what you'd except, but VERY large pieces in the roll!  I couldn't even fit a whole piece in my mouth at one time.\n\nThe scallop roll was a california roll topped with a LARGE mound of krab and scallops (cooked).  It was a warm roll.  I enjoyed it, although I was expecting the scallops to be raw!  I think I would've liked it better if they had been raw, but it was still good.\n\np.s. - if you check in on yelp you can score a free edamame appetizer!", "business_id": "0vzZ_Bcb02rJljeMU9XkBw", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-10-06", "type": "review"}

I read a review once where someone praised a buffet because their children got to run around and release their energy instead of being couped up in a booth.

There were excellent ones in Washington DC, so I know they exist.  Should I temper my review with the knowledge that most Chinese buffets are far inferior to this one?  Does that make this place any better?  Sigh, I don't even know where to begin.\n\nThe place is not disgusting inside - if you want to call that neat or well-decorated, I don't know if you can.  I don't think I'd go that far.  Servers are fast and attentive with drinks and clearing plates - you have to appreciate their hustle.\n\nThe majority of the items on the buffet are absolutely, unequivocally ordinary.  If your mission is to eat as much food as possible for as cheaply as possible, this would be an excellent place to do it.  Seafood is especially fishy and most items seem as if they've had a long-life under the heat lamp.  Mongolian BBQ (which I'm a fan of) is a low-frequented item here, and the veggie selection illustrates this clearly.  There are maybe 5 roughly chopped vegetable choices, a confusing selection of sauces and a couple trays of meat melting in front of you.  Not terribly appetizing and the final product is as lackluster as you'd expect.\n\nThe only true deal is the sushi, of which you can eat copious amounts of and have prepared for you fresh and on demand.  It's not exceptionally good quality, but at a place as low ticket as this, it's a welcome addition to see something being made fresh for you.\n\nWould not go back, and the result of reading many of the reviews here leads me to believe that if this is supposed to be the best of the bunch, I might as well give up hope on the concept of the exceptional Chinese buffet in Phoenix altogether.", "business_id": "-Ogv7rpcgUHkFaSy3vD8Sw", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-11-05", "type": "review"}

It is a chain, but in Roy's defense, the majority of the menu items are created by the local chefs with only a portion of the menu available at all restaurants.  Roy's is billed as Hawaiian fusion, but my first thought was \"oh no, there's sushi on the menu, I won't like this place.\"  I am happy to say I was wrong.  Don't let my husband read this.  He thinks I'm never wrong.\n\nMy husband also always says I'm stuck in the 80's, so I ordered the 1988 cocktail (grapefruit and pomegranate with a grapefruit vodka and lychee liqueur).  Since I was the lone drinker, I stuck with one, but could have easily had 2 or 3 more of these, especially with a little Duran Duran background music.  \n\nWe started with Roy's Canoe Appetizer for Two, adjusted for three.  It includes lobster potstickers and teppanyaki shrimp, both of which were really good.  Also on the boat were Thai beef satay and spicy tuna roll, neither of which I tried.  My husband vouched for the tuna roll, however.\n\nNext up was the grilled endive, apple, and bleu cheese salad with pomegranate vinaigrette.  If you're a salad lover, you would probably love it.  If you're a salad hater, you would probably love it, too.  For my entree, the pancetta crusted Alaskan halibut with tomatoes and chevre, mushroom ravioli.  This, too, was fantastic, although there was a little too much oil on the plate, maybe from the pancetta??  But the fish was nicely prepared and the ravioli was excellent.\n\nMy husband insisted on the chocolate souffle which must be ordered at the start of your meal, but due to a glitch with our pregnant server needing a bathroom break, it didn't get put in early enough.  We waited and were given a starter dessert on the house, and both the server and the gal who forgot to put the order in both profusely apologized.  Hey, I would gladly welcome another screw up if a second dessert was involved.  The souffle was lick your plate good and the blueberry tart (I think that was the name of it) was incredibly good as well.  So good, I may have to break my driving rule and have dessert there again.\n\nProbably 4.5 stars, but I'm feeling stingy today.", "business_id": "corPOxxIBRJ7DSpryYvorw", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-10-17", "type": "review"}

There was a fire pit, many torches, and a guy playing acoustic guitar which set a nice relaxing atmosphere. \n\nWe had the bento box, and the California roll for appetizers. the roll was good and the crab meat was fresh. but the bento box was great. It has braised short ribs, pot stickers, a couple pieces of spicy tuna roll and shrimp skewers. The ribs had a nice balance of teriyaki and smoke and came right off the bone and were delicious. \n\nMy mom got the butter fish and I had the Roy's trio which had butter fish, salmon, and tuna. All three fish were excellent and well seasoned but that butter fish was amazing. It was my first time to have the fish and it was buttery, had zero fishy taste and was just delicious. \n\nfor dessert we shared the blueberry tart with lavender ice cream. Again, just great. the blueberries were ripe, the ice cream was creamy and refreshing, and the presentation was superb. \n\nin conclusion, i have nothing bad to say about Roy's. I think if I had to use a word to describe the food it would be balance. Everything plays well off of each other. \n\nMy mother said it was the best meal she has had in years and I have to agree.

However, when I gathered some friends to decide on a night out, Roy's still had plenty of openings (not necessarily a good sign, but they have a large dining area). Now, I've been to Roy's a few times and they never disappoint, but I've been VERY spoiled with local, fresh, non-chain faire lately, so I wasn't expecting much.\n\nThe choices for restaurant week were quite good. I started with the scallops, which were a bit bland, but good quality scallops and veggies. I also had a Cucumber Basil Collins... the cucumber basil combination is my current favorite for cocktails and this held up quite well. My petite filet showed up and everyone commented \"oh, it's so cute!\" That's code for \"it's tiny!!\" However small the steak, the poblano mashed potatoes had a balanced kick, the red wine sauce brought the filet up a notch, and I was perfectly satisfied. What was supremely killer was the flourless chocolate souffle. I had remembered that Roy's does dessert like nobody's business, so I ordered a little glass of extraordinary port (Justin's Obtuse; I was excited to see it on-hand!) and went into fully food-induced orgasm mode. One touch from the fork and the souffle exploded with a flood of chocolate goodness, which went perfectly with the ice cream and drizzle of berry sauce... only to be elevated by the richness of the port.\n\nFood aside, what impressed me most about Roy's was the service. Every member of the staff greeted us as we entered and departed. The host graciously offered to have the bar tab transferred to the table when our entire party arrived. Our waitress was full of personality and provided incredibly detailed descriptions of each dish. And when dinner wrapped up, they even offered to have our valet cards validated and our cars brought around front for us... nothing tops off a beautiful evening like having your car waiting out front when you finally decide to meander outside.\n\nWhile I'm a confessed food snob, we'll certainly visit Roy's again... and it may become a special treat for happy hour now that the weather is nice; the cocktails are top-notch, their specials are a good deal, and the patio at Desert Ridge looks divine!", "business_id": "corPOxxIBRJ7DSpryYvorw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-09-26", "type": "review"}

First we were told that the patio was closed (on what had to have been the most gorgeous evening of the summer.) That's fine. Inside, it's a little too fancy for our pool-wear, although all but one of us had coverups. So we are decoding what to do, when a server tells us we are dressed inappropriately. We say that we know...we were going to eat on the patio and now we are just standing there deciding what to do (ps the restaurant is completely empty except for about five servers who are glaring at us.) \nWe go back outside where my elderly father needs to sit down for a moment. Normally after a chilly reception like that I would have left immediately, but my dad can't walk very far, the rest of the party is hungry, and we had really been looking forward to Roy's. \nThe server comes outside where we are standing (except for my dad who had to sit down) and confronts us. I explain that its my birthday, that we have been loyal Roy's customers in Hawaii and here, and that we just want to have a nice meal.  I explained that we weren't trying to offend anyone and that there really aren't any other customers to offend right now any way. She tells me that I'm being rude and that she is letting us know about the dress code because she doesn't want her manager to see us and come confront us (so instead she does the honors, I guess.) I am so astounded by how outright MEAN this woman is. It baffling. She looks like she's early 50's or so...you think she would know how to handle a dress code concern better. \nSo the manager comes out, tries to smooth things over, tells us we're all dressed just fine except for one of our well-behaved kids, who needs a shirt with sleeves. Reminds us that there's a sign that says that too (expert managers always point to the policy) Tells us that we won't have that woman as our server. She'll give us \"Debbie, who is fantastic like me.\" Okay. Ha ha. Come in. \nWe get $100+ worth of appetizers and drinks because the full menu is not available yet. Debbie the server is fine. We watch the sun go down through the window. The only good thing about sitting inside is the fantastic live music by Jared Blackstone.  There is also a a very nice server named Tanner, who had brought my dad some water while we were standing on the patio. He comes over and apologizes to us because he has witnessed this whole thing. He's a class act. Kudos to him and I hope he can get a job at an establishment that values service as much as he does. \nThe manager never came back by our table. We didn't stay for dinner. Instead we walked across the resort to The Blue Sage, where we enjoyed a great meal on the patio on a  gorgeous night. \nThe experience at Roy's was one of the all-time worst I have ever experienced in my life.", "business_id": "corPOxxIBRJ7DSpryYvorw", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-09-09", "type": "review"}

We really liked the menu options for this special week, and the warm chocolate souffle cake is always out of this world . . . If that was the only thing that tasted good, then we would feel we got our money's worth . . . but we didn't have to worry about it because everything was perfect from beginning to end.\n\nWe had an adorable server who had a great personality and excellent people skills. She was unassuming and let us linger between courses. As I am a stickler about food coming out too soon after just finishing one course, this was just perfect! And so relaxing. The ambiance on the patio, which is where we chose to sit, almost felt as if we were on one of the islands, not in the middle of the desert . . . with the tiki torches lit and the sound of the babbling water features throughout the resort, it came pretty close . . . it was just missing the trade winds.  The resort had a band playing as well . . . they were pretty good, a few ups and downs. I would have loved if the music was a little more subtle than the pop-jazz mix they were playing . . . oh, but I have digressed. \n\nMy hubby and his daughter chose the restaurant week menu. Hubby had the Grilled Szechuan Spiced Pork Ribs Smoked & Glazed in Roy's Original Mongolian Sauce. A bit cliche, but they were finger lickin' good! My step-daughter and I shared the Crispy Spicy Ahi Sushi Roll with Ginger Wasabi Beurre Blanc -- it was huge and almost a meal. The rolls were fresh, crunchy, and had a little kick . . . not too spicy. It was a good thing I agreed to help her with it! For entrees, my hubby had the Roy's Original Hawaiian Blackened Island Ahi with Spicy Soy Mustard Butter Sauce. It, too, was an ample portion of tender ahi that was complimented by the sauce but no overpowered by it. My step-daughter had the Roy's Roasted Macadamia Nut Crusted Mahi Mahi with Maine Lobster Essence. Another nice portion of perfectly cooked Mahi.  We all were starting to feel the aloha spirit . . . I had to be the exception by ordering off the regular menu and chose my most favorite entree of all . . . the Hawaiian Style Misoyaki Butterfish . . . Aah, what a delight, so melt-in-your-mouth delicate . . . I was in island heaven.\n\nDesserts were total home runs -- the melting hot chocolate souffle is mandatory for any chocolate lover. In fact, it tastes the same at every Roy's we've been to . . . it never disappoints. A total surprise . . . and a delightful one . . . was the chocolate coconut cheesecake which came with a side of mango sorbet . . . or did she say it was pineapple sorbet . . . whatever . . . it was the perfect accompaniment to the light and fluffy cheesecake.\n\nWe also ordered a bottle of Newton claret which was a modestly priced wine and as my husband said as he swirled and sipped it . . . \"I know my wines . . . \" Having to always be the exception, I ordered the he Original Hawaiian Martini, which was what I considered my dessert. It was a juicy combination of Maui pineapple, vodka and coconut rumMMMMM!\n\nIt was truly a beautiful evening from start to finish. You may be asking why I didn't give it five stars then if there were no misfires . . . that five star is reserved for Roy's Hawaiian restaurants that really do create the aloha experience with some special touches only that can only be enjoyed there!", "business_id": "corPOxxIBRJ7DSpryYvorw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-09-23", "type": "review"}

Filet was cooked perfectly!!\n\nIn general, I noticed how the servers were very knowledgeable with what temperatures the meat & fish should be cooked too, and the chefs prepared everything with excellence. \n\nLobster california roll was nothing special. \n\nHibachi salmon was good, macadamia nut mahi mahi was good.\n\nInteresting spice on the edamame.\n\nThe portions are not huge, but they are reasonable and enough food. Pricing is appropriate for what you get as well. \n\nNice plus is that if you don't prefer what the meal comes with, you can sub the sides and there was not an additional charged as I had feared. (subbed rice & bok choy for truffle cream corn risotto-it wasn't for me, but it was prepared very well.)\n\nDefinitely a great place for celebrating.\n\n$5 valet with validation. It's the JW Marriott, not Red Lobster, so we were happy to have someone bring us our car.\n\nService=5, Ambiance=5, Quality/Taste of Food= 5 Stars\n\nI greatly look forward to going back!! I had my eye on those lobster potstickers!", "business_id": "corPOxxIBRJ7DSpryYvorw", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-11-06", "type": "review"}

Ive been there for dinner before and then had their soup and salad lunch as well. The dinners I have had were not memorable (to be honest, I cant remember what I ordered). However, they do have a really good crab and artichoke dip on their appetizer menu. Their sourdough bread that is complimentary is pretty tasty as is their clam chowder. The lunch salad is pretty large too with all the fix-ins along with a large mound of bay shrimp making it above your average side salad. I am a fan of their spicy ranch dressing as well. I did have their apple cobbler once and remember it being one of the best cobblers Ive ever had but that was years ago so who knows what its like now. In any event, I do think some of their food is yummy but the stuff I think is yummy is pretty basic. The service is not very good for a restaurant that has been almost empty each time I have gone there. It seems to take too long to get soup and salad and there have been a few times when our crab dip was completely forgotten and brought out after we received our entrees and were already full. I really want this place to do well because I think they have potential, however, I have a bad feeling that McGraths will eventually be a distant memory. \n\nA Sidenote: For the person that said if you like Claim Jumper or Crapper Barrel, you will love this place because its your typical corporate chain. I don't agree with this at all. I love Claim Jumper because the quality is very good, all the food I have had there is beyond average, and the service is always great. Honestly, I am so sick of people dissing on chain restaurants. Obviously, they got something right in the beginning to become so successful and grow so much. Yes, some of these restaurants are lacking in quality now but some, such as the Claim Jumper are going strong. It shouldn't be about whether the restaurant is a chain, it should be about the food! And I have had many good meals at chains: ie Charlestons, OG, and Claim Jumper!

The only other time I've ate Carrabba's was at a banquet for our swim team my junior year of high school, so needless to say I was pretty excited about having dinner there finally.\n The moment we pulled up I could taste the melt-in-your-mouth Italian bread from its scent lingering heavily in the air. As we entered there were two hostesses, both with cheerful, smiling faces, ready to seat us. Unlike most hostesses that I have run into, the one who seated us was chatty the entire way to our booth. Personally it made me feel more relaxed and able to enjoy what was about to come.\n After a few minutes our server, Randy, walked over  to grab our drink order. He was very nice and knowledgeable of the menu (although he could never get any of us a refilled drink before the previous one was completely empty). My friend was going to order the Mezzaluna, a ravioli with chicken, ricotta, and spinach in a delicious tomato sauce; however, Randy suggested a rigatoni that was similar to the one she had chose. The rigatoni was loaded with chicken, unlike the Mezzaluna, which had a quarter of the chicken this dish had.\n I, on the other hand, couldn't be talked out of my manicotti. Although the crisp, freshly baked Italian bread and Caesar salad were to die for, I, unfortunately, couldn't say the same for their manicotti. The noodles were undercooked, making them hard to cut and there was not an adequate amount of mozzarella cheese melted over them. Their pomodoro sauce was bland and added very little, if any, flavor to the dish. Also, it was a lot smaller than I had hoped for. There were two measly manicotti shells in an oval shaped bowl the size of a kids macaroni and cheese dish.\n Overall, the experience was fairly a good one. The waiter could have been more attentive to our needs, such as bringing over fresh drinks before the old ones were almost three quarters gone. There could have also been larger portion sizes for the price of the meal. Up to that point I might have gone back and given it one more chance.  As we were leaving though, the head chef was walking through the restaurant and asking everyone how they were enjoying their visit and the food. It was something I have never seen a chef do in all the years I have been going out to  eat. I admired how the chef was walking through the restaurant interacting with his customers when the place wasn't exactly slow. He walked by everyone's table asking how the food and service had been.

We also noticed that the cocktail prices have become excessively high. I ordered a top shelf Bourbon Manhattan and was charged $ 16 for the drink. How can you charge sixteen dollars for a drink when my entree was only fifteen dollars. I have never paid that much for a Manhattan not even in fine dining restaurants in downtown Portland..Had I noticed this charge on my check before I left I would have had a discussion with the manager.

DIM SUM.\n\nDim Sum is the greatest thing to hit food since teeth.\n\nI have been holding off on writing this Yelp for months now.  I just could not figure out a way to wrap my head around the awesomeness that is Dim Sum.  I have been eating here pretty much every weekend since I was first introduced to it by fellow Yelpers Jenn H. and  Scott S.  Joe Crack played a role in the introduction as well.  Joe Crack is not a Yelper (He should be though.) but he is a wizard.  So you should be willing to take the suggestion of someone so wise in the ways of the world. He also coined the phrase \"No Goddamn BBQ pork bun!\" Which turns out to be a useful phrase when having Dim Sum, cause they try to shove that down your throat from every cart that comes strolling by.\n\nThe absolute greatest thing about Dim Sum is the ability to be eating awesome food within seconds of sitting down.  From the moment you sit down they are coming by with carts of amazing, trying to get you to try everything from BBQ pork bun to Chicken feet.  You could, if you were so inclined, be in and out of the place in 15 minutes and have a belly full of really tasty Chinese food bits. \n\nSome of my favorite things are:\nThe Chinese Broccoli\nThe Spring rolls\nThe Curry meat Triangles\nThe pot stickers\nAnd...\n\nMy absolute favorite is the Sticky rice. If you go to Dim Sum you have to get the sticky rice.  It is a ball of rice wrapped in a lotus leaf.  Then Jesus and Buddha get together and cry tears of joy over the amazing creation. Then Luke Skywalker and Captain Kirk bless it with a light saber and Tricorder. Then Kurt Cobain plays a misunderstood song over it. Then right before it gets to your table the entire restaurant does a rendition of \"Be our Guest\" from Beauty and the Beast as Pamela Anderson and Jenna Jameson deliver it while talking in tongues.  \nIt is that good people.", "business_id": "z4KFTJQsAdxqMZA7Fx0A9A", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-09-14", "type": "review"}

So not only do they add on 15%, but they added it on to the total of what the bill was AFTER the tip he wrote in....so we paid another 15% of the bill plus the tip he wrote in.  WHAT?

C-Fu is always pretty busy but you don't normally wait long to be seated.\n\nThis place a good spot for decent dim sum.  They are fast, effective, and your dim comes out nice and steamy.

Very reasonably priced, as dim sum should be. \n\nThey normally don't serve you, they are usually just there to refill your drinks and give your receipt.  Other than that, they go around with carts and you pick & choose what you want.  \n\nFOOD: The food was really good. Unfortunately I can't remember  any of the dishes we enjoyed but we did try a variety of their selections.  We didn't like everything on the menu.  But there were lots of things my wife & I really liked. PRICE: Reasonable. SERVICE:  The carts come around quite frequently which is a good thing. Service is somewhat lacking when it comes to getting drink refills.  I had to constantly flag down a waiter to refill our beverage. Also our servers hardly spoke a word of English.  On a good note while the restaurant was packed, we were seated right away  CONCLUSION: My thoughts on a restaurant of any ethnicity is seeing who eats there, if you see many people from the ethnicity of food you looking for you are usually on the right track this place in that aspect does not lie.

I'd rather have Panda or Pei Wei. A chain where I know what to expect.\n\nI ordered online again and they had to call me because the online order form does not have the options that they claim. The lunch special online says that you get tea, crab puff or egg roll, soup or salad and the entree. They said they were not able to include the tea and when I got there, he said as a courtesy, they included the soup and it doesn't normally come with take out and to order the a la carte entree because it comes with more. \n\nI would argue that it definitely doesn't come with more to do it a la carte. I mean, you get more of the entree, but not everything that it claimed online.\n\nThat being said, I will continue on and say even if you're concerned about more or less, it's not that great anyway.  The kung pao had some bell peppers, water chestnuts, peanuts, mushrooms and chicken. The sauce was runny and not spicy.\n\nThe crab puff is not a puff, it's a folded over wonton wrapper filled with cream cheese.\n\nThe soup was not hot or sour, wreaked of white pepper and tasted like nothing. Didn't really end up eating my courtesy soup after all.\n\nOverall, just not really worth it. You pay a little more than a chain with really nothing to show for it.\n\nI didn't eat inside obviously, but there is not even an ambiance to make up for it. It looks like it is falling apart. There is an automated slider when you walk in that sounds like it is going to collapse, a dirty fish tank, and a dilapidated bar and ball room off to the right. As I waited for my food, I looked at the reviews on the wall, all from about 97-98. When I see this, it usually indicates the place has seen better days, which it probably has.\n\nIf you've read my review, I commend you and suggest you spare yourself what I have experienced myself.", "business_id": "z4KFTJQsAdxqMZA7Fx0A9A", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-10-11", "type": "review"}

They all have their pros and cons, but C-Fu has won me over with their service.  They're the only one of the three who have staff who are courteous and make the effort to speak to you in English.  However, food-wise they're more or less on par.  The dishes at C-Fu sometimes look re-heated, but that might be because I'm not a morning person and don't make it in til 1PM or so.  But it's still pretty damn good.  Great Wall has really good barbecue pork buns, but are always jam-packed on any given day, so be prepared to wait outside for about 15 minutes for your number to be called - keeping in mind that 15 minutes in the summer heat feels like an eternity.  Phoenix Palace has pretty good egg tarts, but can get pretty crowded too and have some rather rude waiters.\n\nSo if you wanna try dim sum, I'd recommend trying out all three to try their best dishes.

It's usually in my top 3 whenever anyone offers to take me out for a meal (truth be told, it ain't cheap...but it's well worth it).\n\nThe bread they bring out for starters is great, but it's the herb mix that they mix with the oil that really makes it fantastic. Sooo good. I usually order the chicken noodle soup, which certainly ain't no Campbell's. It's got a nice, spicy kick to it, unlike any other chicken noodle soup I've ever had before, and it has HUGE chunks of soft, white meat chicken.\n\nFor the main course, I usually stick with the chicken parmesan. Two healthy sized chicken breasts flattened out, breaded, and cooked to perfection. Just the right amount of cheese and traditional red marinara to top it off. For my pasta I go with their fettucini alfredo, I'm sure it isn't the healthy option, but it's a great compliment to the chicken. The portions are so big (on top of being half full on bread and soup already) that I always end up taking half of it home with me. \n\nI've sampled their lasagne (usually my Dad's choice), and it's quite delicious...my mom and my sister usually opt for the filet with a side of marsala sauce, and 9 times out of 10 it's amazing. From time to time, the chef undercooks it, but everyone's idea of \"medium-well\" is (somewhat) subjective, and they're always happy to throw it on the grill for a few more minutes if necessary. Another item that I've enjoyed is the garlic mashed potatoes, and that says a lot because I'm not usually a big fan of 'em elsewhere.\n\nI think I've had dessert here maybe twice, because by that point in the dining experience I am usually so stuffed that I can't even fathom cramming any more food into my face. Regardless, the chocolate cake/ice cream thing we got was also top notch.\n\nThe service is usually great, the establishment is always clean and proper, the atmosphere is pretty cool, a bit loud at times when the place is busy, but that doesn't really bother me. I didn't come here to have an in-depth discussion of politics, I came to get my grub on!

Their batter-dip (the part that gets crispy when they fry it) also didn't seem to have any seasoning to it.\n\nThe lentil/sausage soup was really good.  I liked it.  The Italian chicken soup also was very good, though not as \"bold\" as the lentil.\n\nThe main courses were good.  Large portions of pasta, big chunks of scallops, or chicken (depending on the dish ordered).  I had the mezzaluna.  It was tasty, but I don't think I'd order it again.  Just personal preference.  It's a ravioli dish, and I would have liked a bolder (and redder) sauce, and more filling.\n\nThe desserts were wonderful.  I had the cannoli.  It was really very nice.  I didn't really like how it was served (the ingredients were packed into this tall thin glass).  I would have preferred the more traditional presentation.  But the flavor was really excellent.\n\nService was friendly, cheerful, and attentive.  Good job all around there.\n\nI'd give 3.5 stars if I could, but I can't.  And I don't think they quite rated 4 stars.  But maybe that was my entree choice.  If I go again and feel differently I'll update this review to reflect it.", "business_id": "cKxXBvOithS-Ic5KnhEKrg", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-09-25", "type": "review"}

Delicious! However, I tried it again the following week and was disappointed. The chicken parmesan was burned. Like dark brown, bubbled cheese and the lasagna was unruly and tasted like it had cream cheese in it or something this time?

Weird. \n\nSo I'll just stick with the calamari, sausage lentil soup and sirloin marsala. \n\nI guess I update my review to say when they are on their game, everything is fantastic, but they can really have off nights occasionally.

The ravioli were flat (not a lot of stuffing) and the sauce needed serious help.  I ended up putting balsamic vinegar on the dish, just to make it palatable.  My daughter's Fettucine Carrabba was tasty, though - good sauce on the noodles.  They should also warn people that their Caesar salad dressing contains anchovies - not everyone likes that sort of thing. We ordered drinks - the first two drinks that we requested were rejected because they didn't have the makings for them.  So, I thought that I would treat my 21 yo daughter to a B-52.  We were charged $8 for a drink that was incorrectly made and VERY little alcohol.  I mentioned to our waiter that the bartender needed to go back to bartending school.  Our waiter was meh as well.

We started out with an order of crab cakes and Mushrooms Neptune.\n\nThe Crab Cakes were very good and were filling.  You get 2 to an order and a side of their house tartar sauce that was a great accompaniment.  The Mushrooms Neptune is a mixture of cream cheese & crab stuffed inside mushrooms and baked.  These were really good as well.  You get 6 to an order.  A dinner roll came with it and I'm not sure why?  It was a plain ol' dinner roll, no butter or anything.  It really had no purpose of being there really.\n\nFor dinner I ordered the N.Y. Strip with a twice baked potato and added a lobster tail to the meal.  The steak was prepared perfectly (I ordered medium) and seasoned the way a steak should be.  The lobster tail was succulent with the drawn butter and the twice baked potato did not disappoint either.  My wife had the 10 oz. prime rib dinner (medium) with a twice baked potato and onion strings and that was out of the park as well.\n\nThe service was first class and at the end of our meal, the manager came over with 2 complimentary glasses of champagne to celebrate our anniversary and I thought that was a nice touch too.

Every other experience here before had been a 4 star or better, but that was years ago.  Also know that the restaurant had people, but was not busy at all on the bar side.  The restaurant side was reservation only for lunch and had people, but not busy as well.\n\nI unfortunately forgot our server's name, but she was a 20 something female.  She was quick to great us with waters.  When we were not ordering alcohol that is when things took a turn.  She took a bit to bring the iced teas out & did not bring sweetener.  My father had to ask several times before we received it.  When she finally took our order that was the death blow.  We ordered three wedge salads & I had the sirloin added to mine. We have a big, early Thanksgiving dinner and did not want to get stuffed.  After that we could not get her to come by for anything.  We had to ask other servers for drink refills (I hate doing that).  After about 45 minute wait for our salads (mind you the place was not busy), we received my mom's wedge, mine with the sirloin, but my dad's was missing.  She forgot to ring his up.  So the food runner got his within 5 minutes, amazing how quickly they can get them out when stuff is messed up.  Going back to the food drop, we all still had empty drinks & no silverware.  When they brought our silverware out, they never brought out a steak knife; I had to ask for that as well.  \n\nFinally the taste of the food. The lettuce was super wet, so much so that the dressing wouldn't stick.  My steak was almost room temp and the steak knife had a hard time cutting through it.  \n\nMy dad got a little snarky and made a comment about how bad things were to one of the other servers trying to help out. Alexa, the manager, finally stopped by.  She asked us how everything was going, mom & dad started going off.  I stopped them and spoke calmly to her.  She ended up apologizing for things not being great and comped our meal (for three it probably was $40).  She did a 4-1/2 star job.  The server was so bad & the food was not good, that I could not justify over a 2 star rating. \n\nWill I be back?  I will give them another shot when I am in town since the other experiences have been 4 star or better.", "business_id": "xMK01ZbVUYLLoyqoeWAIVw", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-11-26", "type": "review"}

Went there for Thanksgiving as they advertised a 3 course turkey dinner for $27. Went and ordered such dinner what they forgot to tell you was that the turkey was some sort of processed mystery meat turkey roll which when sliced was both white and dark meat. It was the strangest thing I have ever seen and tasted like rubber mostly.  Can not believe they could not just roast some real turkeys and serve. That along with frozen mashed potatoes and some weird stuffing resulted in the worst Thanksgiving dinner I have ever had. In the future they should just stick with steaks and stay out of the Thanksgiving business. \n Thanks Keg for making this holiday one to forget. Please close on Christmas.", "business_id": "xMK01ZbVUYLLoyqoeWAIVw", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-11-26", "type": "review"}

We got there around 6:30pm and the line was out the door. No biggie as we had nothing else to do and we wanted the endless shrimp. Plus my friend had never been to a Red Lobster and it has been about 2 years since my last visit. So after waiting only about 30 mins we got seated and were on our way to pigging out. \n\nFirst off, let me give a special shout out to our waitress Carina! She was very sweet and took great care of us. Thank you Carina! \n\nSo we both knew that we wanted the endless shrimp meal but being the hungry people that we are, we also ordered the appetizer that had stuffed mushrooms, fried clams, and bacon wrapped scallops. YUM! Everything came out piping hot and was very good. I mean bacon wrapped scallops. HELLO! Best of both worlds. The cheddar baked biscuits were still as good as I remembered and fresh out the oven. My friend loved them and was very excited that they brought out more once we had downed the first batch. Oh I also have to give a special mention to the Triple Berry Sangria that they now offer. WOW! Now that is some yummy sangria. Almost as good as mine (LOL) but seriously very good. \n\nNow on to the endless shrimp, we each got to start off with two choices so I chose the teriyaki shrimp and the cajun shrimp and my friend had the garlic shrimp and the coconut shrimp bites. They both come with your standard salad and side of french fries, mashed potato, baked potato, rice or veggies. My friend bumped it up and ordered the lobster baked potato. Needless to say that was one of our favorites as well. \n\nSo back to the shrimp. OMG they were so good, and as soon as Carina bought out or dinner she asked us if we wanted to go ahead and get started on another order of shrimp so that way, but the time we may be done with our first order, more shrimp would already be on the way. She did this for us each time and I finally threw in the towel after my 2nd order but my friend ended up having about five orders. Carina let us know that our first order has ten shrimp in each dish and the orders after have about 7 or 8. Weird but hey, keeps the waste down I suppose. I was beyond stuffed when it was all said and done and very happy. The head manager came over and said hello and to make sure that we were happy with our meals. Very nice. Needless to say, it was a great time and the food was very good.", "business_id": "YgRCJtt7pGvwlb9Ktumeeg", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-10-12", "type": "review"}

Mind you I don't hate the chain but I have never been really impressed.  However the birthday girl wanted their crab legs so off we went.\n\nArriving about 6:00 for an early dinner we were given a place in line which took a little over 30 minutes to get seated.  There is only so long a 5 year old can keep occupied with the lobsters in the tank.  If it had just been L and I we would have taken a seat at the high tops that were part of the bar even though she doesn't drink.   When were seated we were told it had been like this since about 3:30.  Starting just after we were seated it started getting quieter as fewer tables were occupied but we noticed as we left about 8:00 that with about a fourth of the tables empty there were still about 4 parties waiting to be seated.\n\nApparently one of the reasons they were slammed early was the all you can eat shrimp which two of us partook of.  The women chose to build their own feast and the kids got chicken fingers and linguine shrimp respectively.  To start with us adults got lobster stuffed mushrooms which were pretty good.  One of the supposedly good things about a chain in this price range is the predictability, tasty but not great,  of the food and overall we were not disappointed.   The let downs were the crab claws J went there for, the coconut shrimp both of the women ordered and the blue cheese dressing.  The stand outs were the salmon and key lime pie L ordered (and I got to share :-)).  I wasn't noticing the amount of salt with oils as I ate but after I got home I had 4 big glasses of water.\n\nThe service was spot on the entire meal.  K was not wanting for any of his 6 shrimp orders (oink).  There were no mistakes and every thing for the two kids was given priority.   That's pretty good for a chain, especially as we were a party of six spread across a 60 year span.\n\nGiven my past history with the chain I would have given them a 2 but this experience earns them a solid 3.", "business_id": "YgRCJtt7pGvwlb9Ktumeeg", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-09-28", "type": "review"}

Going back to 1977, I have been a Red Lobster fan. In my early forties, I continue to be a Red Lobster fan. In 35 years I never got tired of it. So, it is with little surprise that when we visited Phoenix that we would dine in a Red Lobster.\n\n   For whatever reason, the Cactus Road Red Lobster (near Paradise Valley Mall) was dead on a Friday night. It was the first time in a while that when I visited a Red Lobster that a wait to be seated was nonexistent. If there was a wait, I'm sure that the usual lobster tank would have occupied me for a few minutes.\n\nAs soon as I saw the \"All You Can Eat Shrimp special\" on the menu, I was decided. The shrimp special is no joke. There is a choice of four shrimps including shrimp scampi, fried shrimp, and shrimp with linguini. I'll be the first to admit that Red Lobster seafood isn't Wolfgang Puck Gang quality at the same time that I'll admit that it is far better than frozen foods seafood or a burger served in a casual restaurant chain. It wasn't just the all you can eat shrimp and bottomless soda that makes this a good deal for approximately $20. It was also the salad with dressing and house bread. \n\n Red Lobster's menu features many entrees that are affordable. I just happened to hit Red Lobster when they featured the \"All You Can Eat Shrimp.\" If it had been another time of the year, I would have ordered shrimp linguini, which comes with a salad and bread.  \n\nI had zero complaints about the service. Our Waitress was prompt with the refills at the exact time that she did not rush us.\n\n Dining in Red Lobster is dining in my comfort zone. As long as I am living and have some green in my pocket, I will return to a Red Lobster throughout the year.", "business_id": "YgRCJtt7pGvwlb9Ktumeeg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-11-24", "type": "review"}

Red Lobster has light breading and their frying technique is excellent.  The shrimp did not disappoint.  We also ordered fried flounder which was very good.
