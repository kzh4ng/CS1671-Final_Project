Trust me, I'm not a guy with ridiculous expectations either, I rarely (if ever) complain to a manager, etc.. Anyway, she was really preoccupied with this group of young guys who were drinking a few beers and giving her some attention. To say she was train wreck would be an understatement so I'm sure it felt good to have a couple of buzzed construction workers flirting with her BUT I don't want to suffer over her self-indulgence. Just saying. \n\nWe both ordered the pastrami sandwich and it came out rather quickly. The bread, which is made fresh daily was amazing; it literally melted in your mouth. The pastrami was just \"ehhh, ok.\" It was lean but it didn't seem to pack a real punch from a flavor standpoint. I prefer mine I little more charred up with some seasoning. I could probably go with out having the fries on my actually sandwich as well. Apparently, that's there big move; they put the fries and cole slaw on your sandwich. I was also a little bummed about the fries; they end up getting really greasy and soggy. I'm a fries \"well-done\" kind of guy so this didn't really impress me from a flavor or texture standpoint. In the end, it didn't add to the flavor of the sandwich for me; it actually made it a big soggy mess.\n\nThe portions are enormous and the price is right for lunch. Well under what I think they could charge for the amount of food they give you. \n\nFor those Pittsburgh-ians who travel to the Los Angeles area, let me recommend Langers (look it up). The place is a landmark in Los Angeles and their pastrami and corned beef is absolutely second-to-none. In a fight, it would smoke Primanit Bros. like cheap crack. Just my two cents.

The decor and interior work wonderfully together to give you a very pleasurable dining experience. The most unique part of the interior is the bar which I was told was salvaged and was formerly an alter. Staff is friendly and knowledgable about the menu, ingredients, and specials.\n\nA little known secret is that Pane Bianco is owned and operated by the same family who owns Pizzeria Bianco and you can get the same exact pizzas here even though they are not listed in the menu. All the same great taste, without any of the downtown wait for a table.\n\nA must try location for anyone in the uptown area.", "business_id": "-AAig9FG0s8gYE4f8GfowQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-05-04", "type": "review"}

After I got over the shock of a cheese slice somehow showing up sandwiched in between each English muffin and the hollandaise sauce, I did enjoy it and the home fries. Obviously not the best hollandaise, and I guess they know this already because it needed to taste more like cheese and less like hollandaise according to the cooks that probably should just remove this item instead of pretending.

This bad boy is pork roast rubbed with southwestern spices, slow-cooked, pulled, and marinated in a jalape\u00f1o and onion barbeque sauce, topped off with their special coleslaw, and served on a onion roll.
