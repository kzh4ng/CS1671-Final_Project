Let's go somewhere new, downtown (uptown as they call it in Charlotte), some place fancy.  The capital grille fits this criteria.  From walking into the place with the dark woods, white linen table cloths, well dressed patrons.  It all works.  The waiter approaches our table and we are ready to start the experience.  He recommends a wine from the extensive wine list.  Lets talk about that.  I am a wanna-be when it comes to choosing a wine.  When I see a list as big as this, my first thought is wow, I think I'll get a beer!  Our waiter was an expert.  After a couple more visits we learned that pretty much everyone there had an excellent grasp on choosing wine and familiarity with the wine selection.  Our selection was a white which was absolutley perfect.  Started with the Lettuce wedge, nice giant piece of iceburg lettuce, ice cold, plenty of blue cheese and bacon and perfectly ripe tomotes.  \nThings were looking good.  We went light on the apps the first time since we had a feeling that the meal was going to be huge and we wanted to survive!  Our steaks came, filet au poivre, of course!  Done perfectly, rare, cream sauce was out of this world.  Meat so juicy and tender you don't need the fancy knife they give you.  We had the mashed potatoes and the au gratin potatoes for sides.  These were to die for.  Low fat I'm sure.  For dessert the recommendation was made to order the cheese cake.  Wow, I had no idea.  So rich and creamy we ate the whole thing.

If you can finish a 3 lb (48 oz) along with the side dishes and salad that comes with this challenge, you win a free meal.

The price was decent with my restaurant.com coupon, but even without, I would have just skipped the dessert and still come in around $50 for two with tip.

Anyways, the decor is rustic but outdated.  The menu is limited, and you have no options.\n\n\"What do you mean by no options\", you ask?\n\nWhat type of salad dressing would you like?  Ranch?  Not a fan of Ranch?  Are you sure?  Because that's all they have to serve with their cheap iceburg salad mix.  And to spice things up a bit, they throw in a few whole cherry tomatoes.\n\nAnd do you like corn on the cob, and diced sweet potatoes sauteed in butter and brown sugar?  I hope so, because that's all you gonna get.  Sound appetizing?  Sweet and buttery concoctions making their way across the plate toward  your meaty centerpiece.\n\nMy wife ordered the 'Deputy' Prime Rib, which was the most un-flavorful piece of meat she recalls having, and the au-jus being just warmed beef broth, void of flavor.\n\nI ordered the 'Trail Hand' T-Bone, because I like T-Bones.  You should just call me 'T-Bone'.  Anyways, I asked them to serve it rare, because I had a hankering for a juicy cut of steak.  It was incredibly bland, and destitute of the juice I craved.  It wasn't dry.  More like a raw piece of steak.\n\nWanting to salvage the evening, I scanned the dessert menu for a hidden gem.  Strike three.  The apple pie we chose was unanimously nominated for the worst ever.  The dough was either overkneaded, or cooked in a microwave.  Kind of stretchy.  A few bites into this, and we knew... prognosis negative.\n\nThis review gets 2 stars, with one of those stars coming from the entertainment.  Yes, the one bright spot was the live music.  The band sounded great.\n\nThis trip turned out to be a complete WASTE of money that would have been better served back at the Seattle Conglomerate.", "business_id": "wZwZcte4lcbu51NOzCjWbQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-01-17", "type": "review"}

Terrible food, terrible service. \nWe went to the Rooste last September when we were staying at the Grand for my husband's birthday and were disappointed from the moment we walked in. We went to the hostess stand and stood there for 3 minutes (I timed it) before one of the four hostesses even looked up to acknowledge us. The girl that helped us acted like she was doing us a favor by allowing us to eat there. It was a busy saturday night, so we had to wait a bit for a table. No problem, because we could grab a drink at the bar and then let our kids go down the slide a few hundred times. \nWe get to the table, order from a very nice but stressed out waitress. After much more endless sitting and waiting, and joking with the table next to us about the ridiculous wait, our food gets dropped off by a food runner. Not dropped off to our table, mind you, but the runner puts the tray of food on a stand nearby, and tells us that our waitress will be by to serve us momentarily. After more waiting, we served ourselves, ate, and put our dirty dishes back on the serving tray before our waitress came around to see us again. Glad we didn't wait to be served. The food was airline-quality. We both ordered the steak and enchiladas (a weird combo to offer but it sounded good at the time). I could have easily made something better at home. Maybe the point of having you wait for so long for your food is to make you starving enough to choke it down. \nWe were so over the whole experience by that point that we asked for the manager. What a mistake. Most managers in a customer service setting are cordial to the customers and care about their business. Not this guy. He stormed over to our table and practically yelled that they were very busy that night, and we should be more patient. We hadn't even explained our issue by that point. As my husband tried to explain the numerous issues that we had encountered from the rude hostesses down to the nonexistent waitress, the manager seemed to get angry with us and again told us to be more patient. To which my husband replied \"Are you f***ing kidding me?\" Well, that didn't sit well with the manager, who said he wouldn't even speak to us further if we were going to cuss at him. I took over and asked us how he would feel if he were in our shoes. How he expects to be treated at a restaurant, and what kind of service he expects when he dines out. He simply said that they were just too busy that night and there was nothing he could do to help us. We weren't asking for anything, we were just trying to make him aware of all of the issues that we had encountered so he and his staff could try to improve. \nI've had poor service at other restaurants, but I've never had a restaurant manager act like such a jerk. It's no wonder that place has such bad reviews. It's terribly run, and the food is terrible. The only thing it has going for it is the slide and the view. \nDon't waste your money.", "business_id": "wZwZcte4lcbu51NOzCjWbQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-02-15", "type": "review"}

We did go on a weeknight (coupon stipulation for weekends) but liked the fact that it wasn't as hectic and busy as on a weekend night. Since it was my birthday dinner, my boyfriend I got all dressed up and went out for a nice dinner.\n\nWe were seated immediately at a spacious booth next to a large fireplace. The ambience reminded me of an upscale lodge. Our server was very attentive and charismatic. He made our experience fun but not overwhelming us with unnecessary visits to our table. We were given a loaf of wonderful bread to start. Our server made awesome dinner selections, including my boyfriend's filet oscar entree. I went with the 10 oz filet mignon and a side of steamed veggies. We ordered our steaks cooked medium and medium rare. Both were cooked very well. Everything we ate was top notch!\n\nThe best part comes with dessert! The GM came over to our table and not only wished me a Happy Birthday with his adorable baby boy in his arms but gave us a free Miner Pie. OMG it was incredible!! I think the idea of giving us that kind of service was better than the actual pie for dessert.\n\nFor the food and service we received, the prices were on point.

Flemings was closed to the public during this event because they open at dinner hours. Although the restaurant was not officially opened all of the employees still kept the same level of service as if it was; as a matter of fact I was graciously greeted by a hostess upon arrival. The actual meeting room was sectioned off in the rear of the restaurant, this would make a great place for any after wedding rehearsal dinner, seminar/luncheon, or even possibly an upscale bridal shower. The wait staff was very friendly moved stealthily to each table during the seminar which is very important (nobody wants to hear a bunch of plates clinking when you're trying to listen to a presentation). On to the food! The salad was pre-chosen by the host which was Fresh Mozzarella & Sweet Cherry Tomato- one word to describe it would be \"AMAZING\"! The tomatoes were perfectly sweet and paired so well with the creamy FRESH mozzarella, I literally thought about this dish when I was on my way to sleep for the night. For dinner attendees at the seminar had the choice of chicken, salmon and of course steak. My co-workers and I all decided to try something different so we could compare. I had the Chicken and was impressed by juiciness and the mushroom chutney it was served with. The Salmon looked delectable and received high praise as well as the Petite Filet Mignon. All the entrees came with fresh Saut\u00e9ed Green Beans and Fleming's Potatoes (think of the best scallops you've ever eaten, now times that greatness by 10 and you'll have Fleming's Potatoes).  The seminar concluded with a Cheesecake that was sent straight from the Cheesecake gods (it was a huge piece and I was already full but I somehow made room for it!). The Cheesecake was rich, creamy and lightly topped with blueberries (I can't believe I had to go back to work after that feast!). This was my first time at Fleming's I will be sure to come back during normal operating hours so I can try even more of the amazing menu.

Lets break it down into parts.\n\nThe bun- fairly dense and hearty bun that soaked up the juices and didn't fall apart on you when eating it. Not really the most flavorful, but a good base for the burger.\n\nThe patty- smaller than the bun (not a good sign), seemed to be a coarsely ground and actually really juicy. Just the way I like it, except for one major flaw. I asked for the burger to be cooked to medium, and the burger I received was well done. Not sure I like that an expensive steakhouse overcooked it's beef. The patty was a little too salty too. \n\nToppings- 2 small pieces of bacon that probably would have made 1 regular sized strip. The lettuce and tomato were cheap though and there was no onion to go with the burger. (reviewing my photo there was onion,  it was just so small and thin that I couldn't taste it). This level of veggies I would expect in a fast food place. Cheese was nicely melted but wish it had a stronger flavor.\n\nSides- the fries were decent, but the portion once again small.\n\nThe carpaccio wasn't that good to me. I liked the toasted Parmesan bread they served with it, but the beef itself didn't seem that fresh to me with a pale color that was starting to turn grey around the edges. Maybe the beef was perfectly fine, but it just didn't look that fresh to me. Of course maybe I just didn't eat it fast enough either. I felt like I liked the carpaccio at Va Bene down the street a bit more. \n\nSo why did I give this place a 3 star review although I didn't really think the place was that good? Because I think the price I paid was worth the meal I got, no more no less.
