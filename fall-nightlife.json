He said they had a decent Reuben, but to be prepared to step back in time.\n\nWell, seeing as how I'm kind of addicted to late 40's and early 50's, and the whole Rat Pack scene, stepping back in time is a welcomed change in da burgh...as long as it doesn't involve 1979, which I can see all around me every day.\n\nAnd yet another shot at finding a decent Reuben in da burgh...well, that's like hunting the Holy Grail. So looking under one more bush certainly wouldn't hurt.\n\nSo off we go right at lunchtime in the middle of...where exactly were we? At first I thought we were lost, driving around a handful of very rather dismal looking blocks in what looked like a neighborhood that had been blighted by the building of a highway. And then...AHA! Here it is! And yep, there it was. This little unassuming building with an add-on entrance with what looked like a very old hand painted sign stating quite simply 'Emil's. \n\nWe walked in the front door, and entered another world. Another time, and another place. Oh, and any Big Burrito/Sousa foodies might as well stop reading now. I wouldn't want to see you walk in, roll your eyes and say 'Reaaaaaalllly?'\n\nThis is about as old world bar/lounge/restaurant as it gets. Plain, with a dark wood bar on one side, plain white walls with no yinzer pics, good sturdy chairs and actual white linens on the tables. This is the kind of neighborhood dive that I could see Frank and Dino pulling a few tables together for some poker, a fish sammich, and some cheap scotch. And THAT is exactly what I love.\n\nOh...but good food counts too. \n\nWe each had a Reuben, and my friend had a side of fries. The Reubens were decent, but not NY awesome. A little too thick on the bread, but overall, tasty and definitely filling. Not too skimpy on the meat. I seriously CRAVE a true, good NY Reuben, but since I can't afford to travel right now, what I find in da burgh will have to do. But as we sat and ate, burgers came out to an adjoining table. Those were some big thick burgers. A steak went past for the table behind us. That was HUGE! And when we asked about it, the waitress said 'Yeah, it's huge and really good, and he only charges $12.99 for it, ain't that nuts?' Another table of five came in, and wham. Fish sandwiches PILED with breaded fish that looked amazing. Yeah, I want that, that, that and THAT!\n\nMy friend also mentioned that they have a Chicken Parm special one day of the week that is only served UNTIL 4 pm, and that it is fantastic. If only I could GET there on that week day before 4...\n\nThe waitress did a good job, especially since there was quite a growing crowd at lunchtime on a Saturday, and only one of her. She kept up and was very friendly. \n\nThey only have Pepsi products, so I had a brewed iced tea, which was very fresh, and she did pop by to ask about refills as often as she could. As the lunch hour went on, they were getting busy.\n\nEmil's is no frills, good portions, very reasonable prices, VERY comfortable neighborhood hole in the wall...kind of like Cheers, but in a blue collar neighborhood in the 1950's. Fan-freakin-tastic! I could feel at home here.\n\nYou definitely want to hit Mapquest or plug in your GPS though. I am not sure that I could find it again on my own...it really is a hidden gem. I will be making my friend take me back until I can memorize where the heck it is.\n\nAddendum: 2nd visit for the fish sandwich. Excellent. Truly. A pound of fish on a fish-shaped bun (as opposed to da burgh's seemingly popular hamburger bun). The fish was flavorful, the batter excellent, and for just $8. This may have been the best fish sandwich I've yet to have in da burgh.", "business_id": "mVHrayjG3uZ_RLHkLj-AMg", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-11-03", "type": "review"}

Don't be put off at first - the outside doesn't have much decoration to speak of and looks like the sort of place that you might think twice about it.  A TGI Fridays it isn't... And thank god for that.\n\nThe place is well-kept but a little dated -  no fripperies here.  But we're not here for the Decor - we're here for some dinner.  \n\nThe menu is basic with reasonable prices.  The meats and seafood are high quality and everything is made to order.  Their stuffed cabbage is regarded as the best in  Pittsburgh.  I love stuffed cabbage but I just made a batch a couple of weeks ago and I'm cabbaged out.  Their Ruebens are   also killer (our waitress raved about them).  My wife and I both settled on fish sandwiches.  These are true Pittsburgh fish Sammiches - fresh fried fish in crispy breading, crammed between enormous pillows of soft, yet chewy and crispy Mancini's Italian bread.  No adornments - just a boatload of hot crispy fish.  Emil's uses thick cod fillets piled high rather than a thin fillet that needs to be broken up to fit in the bun.  Truly a great sandwich.  My daughter had the BLT - looked good and on good bread and they weren't skimpy with the bacon.\n\nThe service was very pleasant and friendly and the crowd was a great group of folks.  We all had fun with 4 other tables when my wife pulled up a Trivial Pursuit game on her iPhone and pretty much everyone joined in and had a good laugh.\n\nOverall, if you consider yourself a true Pittsburgher - you must visit this place.  It's one of the few places (Big Jim's in the Run is another) where the spirit of Pittsburgh is alive and hungry.

'Rocky' would definitely describe the experiences.\n\nOn the first trip, I went to try their (at that time)raved about Reuben. And YET to find a true good Reuben in da burgh, I tried it.\n\nWell, they were out of the proper bread, and the guy had to run to the store to buy the closest thing he could find, which was not the proper bread, and instead of one of their 'raved about' Reubens, I received two mini-Reubens, which basically took the guts from one Reuben, and spread it out onto two sandwiches on regular sized bread. I ate it. It wasn't great, but they swore it was because they'd run out of the bread. Bread or not, it still wasn't great. The atmosphere was pleasant in that 'blue collar bar' kind of way, and the staff was very nice, but not a winning pitch on the Reuben.\n\nThe second trip was after a long day of moving furniture with the same friend. Sat in the back room, instead of the bar, which felt more like a restaurant, of course, with the big screen TV covering the sports of the moment.\n\nI was in the mood for dinner this time, and after a scan, decided on fried chicken and mashed potatoes with the salad bar. My friend ordered one of her faves, the breaded pork chops.\n\nWe hit the salad bar, which was uber-basic. Three soups (mostly vegetable loaded, which left me out), basic iceberg lettuce mix (very probably out of a bag), a few veggie toppings, and three or four dressings. It was a basic salad, no big deal. More or less an appetizer filler before the meal.\n\nThe mind-blower in this trip was the ordering of the fried chicken dinner. Our waiter looked like a 19 year old gas station attendant, skinny little blonde guy with a sweet but incredibly naive face, and an air of vapidity, which was confirmed when I placed my order. I asked what chicken pieces came in the dinner, and asked if it was possible to only get dark meat. I never imagined how confusing a question that could possibly be. It literally took him two trips back to the kitchen to 'ask', and the child honestly had no clue what 'white meat' and 'dark meat' meant. The first answer he came back with was that the chicken came in a pre-portioned prepared bag, kind of Kentucky Fried Chicken style...which didn't answer my question, thus prompting the second trip. \n\nAfter the second trip back I heard the cook holler 'Tell him I'll fix him up'. \n\nWell, the chicken was prepackaged dreck like you'd find in the freezer case of Walmart, tiny and not good, and the potatoes had that slight tinge of chem-spuds flavor, laden with some kind of chopped up green (parsley?), and a side of that basic brown gravy served up in 5 gallon buckets.\n\nThank goodness for the basic salad bar.\n\nEven my friend admitted that her pork chops were different and not what she'd expected. They also appeared to be from a freezer bag.\n\nThe irony was that the boy who didn't know white meat from dark meat, was chatting with some other customers...about baseball...and he was a genius about the mindless sport of baseball. Ahhhh da burgh.\n\nThird base? Nah...why bother when there are so many other options around. Go on in a grab a beer and chat black and gold if you happen to be in Carnegie...they can help you out all types of ways in that area. Just don't go hungry if you actually have tastebuds.\n\nFrom what I understand it 'used to be' really good homecooked food.

Adult games!\n\nThe Homestead (Pittsburgh) location of Dave & Busters is just one of the almost 50 locations across the country - from New York to Florida to California - - from Canada to Mexico.  \n\nThe Dave & Busters idea was conceived in Little Rock, Arkansas back in the 1970s. Two different businesses (one a popular watering hole & one a game & entertainment business) were right next door to each other. The two young owners were friends and quickly realized that combining their businesses made perfect sense. So they opened the first combined D & B in  . . . . no, not Little Rock, but Dallas! To this day there are no D & B's in Little Rock. Not sure what is up with that! But lots of other cities have been the beneficiaries of these two friends combining their businesses.\n\nThe one in Pittsburgh is the only one I have ever been to.  When I lived there, a group of friends and co-workers (and me, of course!)used to go there for Happy Hour & Power Hour . . . . at least once a week. We had a blast!  A great place to kick-back and let the worries of the work day melt away.\n\nWonder if they'll ever open one in Marin County, CA? Shucks!  Probably not. Not a Marin County scene, for sure. \n\nWHAT A BLAST IT WAS THOUGH! I miss going to D & B. They have all the classics, like billiards & shuffleboard, plus over 200 interactive & video games. A rechargable Power Card provides an easy way to access all the games.  \n\nPOWER HOUR is game HAPPY HOUR - - an entire hour of classic and video games for just  ten bucks.  \n\nA GREAT BAR, WONDERFUL FOOD AND SERVICE! A RELAXING AND FUN WAY to spend a Friday or Saturday evening. You'll never want to leave. Meet your friends here, grab a beer and a burger or steak and hit the games. \n\nTime will just evaporate . . . . while you laugh and drink with your favorite girl, your best friend or even your boss!  \n\nDAVE & BUSTERS! LOTS OF PARKING! LOTS OF FUN!\n\nFUN! FUN! FUN! FUN! FUN! FUN! . . . . BRING ON THE BEER!", "business_id": "sbW8qHJgzEIH42B0S-3New", "stars": 5, "date": "2007-11-20", "type": "review"}

They immediately set up the table while about 4 of my friends and I waited; the hostess, after taking my name, never spoke to us again. She did not tell us when we could sit, how long it would be, or any other information. And then they made us wait for 75% of our party to show up before they would seat us. Mind you, there was no one else waiting, and the table was ready, and we were ready to order. But they didn't tell us this; I didn't even know why we were being forced to wait until I heard a supervisor whispering to the waitress about making us wait. I still have no idea why we were forced to wait. \n\nWhen my full party was finally seated, we were helped by two waiters who were perfectly polite and nice. BUT, our service was rather haphazard. People would order drinks and food, and get things at wildly different times. One person was done eating appetizers and drinks when another was just getting their first drink. I know there was chaos to a big party, but it got a little out of hand.\n\nThe food is pretty standard American chain food, comparable to Appleby's and Chili's - not offensive, but nothing to knock your socks off. It has a decent selection, and a few good desserts and appetizers, and everything was competently prepared. Overall, it is a fine enough meal for a large group before going to enjoy the arcade at fairly reasonable prices, but some of the service standards are poor. In the future we will probably eat at one of the other restaurants in the area and then move over to D&B's for games.\n\nBar: 1 Star\n\nDrinks are predictably expensive, but there is a wide variety. The problem is that about half of them don't even kind of resemble what is on the menu, and most don't have enough alcohol to even taste. Worse yet, while you can get a drink at the bar in the arcade, the staff is either completely non-interactive or just rude. You have to track them down, and then have a minimum of interaction before they stomp off like you ruined their life.\n\nArcade: 4 Stars\n\nThere are a lot of great games here to play, and many that are fun with groups or pairs. It is a great place for a large party, because you can mingle with all your friends playing many different very fun games. If you are a couple, there are also many great selections that everyone enjoys. The staff on the floor is helpful and fast to fix games that have problems, and are typically polite. The ticket prizes are cheap as expected, but kind of fun, and the people in the ticket shop were always nice and quick to help.\n\n\nOverall: 3 Stars\n\nIf you want to hang out here, I would suggest eating somewhere else, and then playing games and having fun here, but only order beer at the bar and don't expect a smile.", "business_id": "sbW8qHJgzEIH42B0S-3New", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-09-29", "type": "review"}

Second, I actually experience all of it while here.  We will start with the food/service.  Staff, you were wonderful.  You were polite, you greeted us as soon as we walked in the door, gave us no qualms while ordering and were swift with your delivery.  Food, you were not wonderful.  I ordered the BBQ chicken breasts.  This came with a side of broccoli and their type of mashed potatoes.  The chicken was a bit dry and in some places you can tell it was left on the grill a little too long.  There were actually some bites that all I could taste was charred meat.  There wasn't enough BBQ sauce on the the chicken either.  The broccoli appeared to have been cooked prior and then thrown back into a pan to be seared.  Some of my broccoli actually had some burnt crisp areas on it.  Also I noticed that there were still some leaves left on the broccoli.  The mashed potatoes I wanted to like (which I hoped would be the best part of the dish, I'm a bit of a potato freak), but alas, I was let down. *sad face* They were cold and such a tiny portion.  With a tiny amount of shredded cheese and bacon but into that divot they made with the scoop to get it out of it's container.  Oh food, how if I didn't need you to survive, I wouldn't complain about you.\n\nThe building right now is in disarray.  They are in the midst of a remodel with lovely plastic curtains covering up certain sections of their dining area.  No bar out in the dining area right now and the pool tables were absent as well.  If you wanted a drink you had to go back into the game room.\n\nSpeaking of the game room, by far the best part.  With the meal I ordered I got the $20 play card (the best part of the meal, super charge it for $3 more and it's even better).  The game room  you can tell is in need of an update.  The carpet is worn and other signs of wear are noticeable as well.  One good thing is the games.  They change them up so often that there is always something new once you return.  Who knew that playing Connect 4 could be so fun, or for that matter Skee Ball rises to the top of my list to play.\n\nI will return again, but only after I eat elsewhere first.", "business_id": "sbW8qHJgzEIH42B0S-3New", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-10-22", "type": "review"}

The interior is clean; the seats are comfortable; and it's an OK atmosphere to see a show and laugh.\n\nIt's too small, however, to attract many of the best acts, which limits its ability to ever become the central hub for Pittsburgh comedy.  Most of the big names that have recently come through Pittsburgh--Jim Gaffigan, Louis CK, Second City--all perform elsewhere (though they managed to get Bob Saget, to their credit).\n\nBut the biggest problem is the food and drink.  They're very up front about their mandatory two item minimum, but the forced service requires that you spend extra money and get interrupted by waitstaff at least several times during the show.  The prices are well above what I'd consider reasonable given the quality, and I'd begrudgingly--or even happily--just shrug off the cost the same way I would a stadium concession stand markup...but the food is bad.  You're forced to either (a) buy extremely overpriced drinks (3.50 for a soda, for example, with no refills--or ten dollars for one with refills), or (b) buy moderately overpriced food which you wouldn't want in the first place.  I thought the ten dollar chicken sandwich looked reasonable, until a few bites in I decided I'd rather just throw away the money than keep eating it.\n\nStill, I think this place has a lot of potential; the core idea is very workable; and they do attract some really good comedians.  Two stars for now, with high hopes for improvements.\n\nA few specific drawbacks which could be VERY easily fixed:\n1 - A lot of the drinks didn't have prices on them.  I know this isn't uncommon, but at a venue where every question you ask interrupts not only your own show-viewing experience as well as the experiences of your neighbors, it's an incredibly poor decision here.  Make everything on the menu exceptionally clear.  It's not that hard.\n2 - Put the drink prices on the website too.  An Improv representative has personally responded to many of these Yelp reviews, and she once said \"Our menus and pricing are listed on our website, which makes for easy planning!\"  I'm calling shenanigans.  Not all the prices are on the website, which makes for difficult planning.\n3 - Reminding me to tip my server during the show AND adding an automatic gratuity to the check makes me feel like you're trying to trick me.  It's kind of an unprofessional way to say goodbye to one's customers.\n4 - Since the $3.50 soft drinks don't come with free refills, the servers shouldn't ask \"would you like a refill on that?\" or anything of the sort.  They should ask \"would you like another one?\" instead.  They should also respond to requests for refills by saying \"we don't offer refills, but I'd be happy to get you another one.\"  Just because there's a 10 dollar refillable soda option on the menu doesn't mean people all figure it out.  Most patrons don't even bother reading the beverage section of the menu if all they want is a standard beverage offered almost everywhere (like a cola or diet cola), and the reading difficulties imposed by the darkness make them even less likely to browse the offerings.", "business_id": "tv8cS4aaA1VDaInYgggb6g", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-09-05", "type": "review"}

I have been here MANY times and sometimes I get an attentive waitress and sometimes not. Most recently our waitress was rude, didn't bother with pleasantries and barely took notice of us. Also beware of the fact they automatically add gratuity. If our waitress was nice I would be more than glad to add to it but this time I was like no way!\n\np.s. when I used my groupon I didn't have any trouble", "business_id": "tv8cS4aaA1VDaInYgggb6g", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-09-06", "type": "review"}

The improv is a great place to go for a good show a few times a year. The venue is clean. The comedians are good, for the price, and many times you get a steal and can see a great comedian for a low price (i.e.Tommy Johnagin). However, be advised, if you attend more than one show every couple of months, you will see some of the same opening acts repeated. This is my biggest gripe with the Improv. I've been to the Improv about 3 times over the past 4 months and have seen the same opening acts a few times. I think they cycle through the same 4-5 comedians. Are there not more talented comedians in Pittsburgh? As noted in other reviews, another area of improvement is the drinks and food. I always attend the late showing so that I can eat elsewhere. The food is mediocre bar food at best. Nothing more needs to be said about that. I definitely don't mind the two drink minimum. I've been known to consume more than two drinks in one setting but, the drinks are insanely overpriced. $5 for a Miller Lite, $4 for a Snapple, $10 for a fountain drink with refills. You're better off having your two drinks during the show and going over the Sing Sing after for a draft .  . or four. In addition, since they started offering a large Groupon discount, the Improv has been packed. Be aware that if you only have two people in your party, they may seat strangers at your table who are 6 feet tall and block your view.", "business_id": "tv8cS4aaA1VDaInYgggb6g", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-11-08", "type": "review"}

I saw Sheryl Underwood and she was fantastic. It was my first time being at the Improv. After years of saying that I wanted to go, it really did meet my expectations! The ambiance is inviting, with warm lighting and a good amount of seating for a smaller place. We were 8th in line so we had good choice of seating, though we were encouraged to fill the seats in the front by the stage first. The seating is layered in tiers. Each tier has a long booth with tables and chairs for seating. It was very comfortable, roomy and an interactive set up. The stage is close to the seating (some tables are right at the stage) with little space between you and the comedian, which made it very interactive and fun. We arrived at the Improv around 9:45 pm for a show that started at 10:30 pm, with doors opening at 10:00 pm. We waited in line until the doors opened at about 10:15-10:20 pm, so they were really behind schedule. The show started around 10:45 pm with two opening comedians before the main act. The show was over around 1:00 am. The only negatives were that the staff was not very friendly and immediately told me that I have to buy a minimum of two items off of the menu. ($30/ticket isn't enough?) I was not hungry and did not want to drink, so this was a bit frustrating, especially because it wasn't disclosed on the ticket or anywhere else. The server did not hold us to the 2 minimum purchase requirement and my friend and I got away getting 3 drinks for the night. The food menu looked great and the prices seemed reasonable, though if you want water you are looking at $5 for Fiji or sparkling. It was $8 for a glass of wine. $11 for bottomless soda, complete with a take home Improv glass. The other thing that I didn't like was that an employee takes your tickets while you're waiting in line and marks your hands with a dry erase marker. After one bathroom trip, the mark was gone, so I think they need a more effective way to mark you as an already paid customer since the employee takes your proof of purchase. These negatives did not affect my overall experience negatively and I would most certainly go back!

And while I enjoy their cocktails and would consider stopping in just for drinks more often, the problem is that things are way overpriced here. Even during the happy hour drinks are pretty costly, not to mention that I think most of the drinks I personally like don't qualify for the happy hour discount, which is disappointing. Once I stopped in with friends after a movie and one drink cost me $10 here. Not even a large one, either! Sorry, but I find that to be kind of ridiculous, especially since there's cheaper places to get drinks in the area.\n\nStill, the food and drinks are definitely a-ok albeit overpriced, so this place would be rated 3 stars in my mind IF I could hear myself think when I eat here.

I have been here many times and I am just finally getting around to writing a review.  Let me state that my wife made me go here tonight because my friends wanted to and she said I need to indulge their interests. Even if they suck. \n\nBuffalo Blues is like a Hooters, except the girls where more clothes and are not as good looking. The service is horrendous and the food may be better at Hooters.  The beer selection is decent at Buffalo Blues but it is expensive and they often run out of things that are still on the board.\n\nMy friends like going for all you can eat wing night but frankly I don't get it. You get 10 wings up front they will give more wings 5 at a time. The problem is that you get those wings in 30 minute intervals.  So the max you could eat is 55 wings. Did I mention that  the wings are really tiny and the sauce is tossed on like a Jackson Pollack painting.  They also charge extra for blue cheese or ranch.  The wings do not come with celery. This is a crime against humanity and the city of Buffalo.  \n\nI chose to detour from wings tonight and ordered a chicken sandwich. Apparently this was a bad choice.  It took a full hour to get my food. It was so long that the rest of the table ate their wings and ordered more and the waitress didn't think this was a problem. When my meal did arrive everything was cold. The sandwich was ok, but the fries were just tiny pieces that were limp and flavorless.\n\nI paid $16 for a beer and a sandwich that my friends had to wait for me to eat to leave.

I ordered their prixe fixe brunch option which is a choice of an appetizer, brunch dish, and drink for $22.  I started off with smoked salmon and had the waitress recommended braised lamb and eggs as an entree and a mimosa to drink.  My companion ordered butternut squash & apple cider soup, wild mushroom omelet, and a glass of fresh orange juice.\n\nWhile waiting for our food, we munched on their complimentary pastry basket consisting of super moist mini-muffins, scones, and super rich and buttery biscuits with honey butter.\n\nThe smoked salmon came with capers, minced red onion, crumbled egg, a drizzle of aioli, and a beautiful fried potato cake.  There was just the perfect amount of everything on the dish; the potato cake was just big enough to balance out the saltiness of the smoked salmon and the capers of course paired beautifully with the smoked salmon.  I tried some of the butternut squash & apple cider soup and it had some a pretty complex flavor.\n\nMy entree reminded me of an eggs benedict with a twist: grilled  sourdough topped with spinach, braised lamb shoulder and two poached eggs.  I love braised meats because braising can do such wonders to tougher cuts.  The braised lamb shoulder was flavorful, tender, and super rich.  The best part about poached eggs is sopping up the extra yolk with bread and it just tasted better with the sauce of the lamb soaking into the sourdough to soften it up a bit.  This dish itself is enough to make me a regular.  I tried my companion's home fries which came with this slightly spicy ketchup (I think it's house-made) and also a piece of her omelet which was pretty good too.\n\nService was good, ambiance was good, portions were big, quality was excellent, AND they take reservations.

Their happy hour has some good deals - $6 cocktails and glasses of wine, and $1 of bottled beer.  It was a fun, trendy atmosphere and a nice place to go for a glass of sangria after a busy day.\n\nI came back for dinner a month or so later.  We had reservations (on a Monday night) and were seated immediately -even though the restaurant was surprisingly busy.  We sat in the covered area out front - sort of like sitting in a dim, Mediterranean garden.  And yes - the lights are low throughout the whole restaurant.  Even with my young eyes, I still needed a candle to read the menu.  But it is romantic and a peaceful place to eat.  A little uncomfortable, as they have metal chairs (sort of like upscale patio furniture), but not a big deal.  Sit inside at a booth if you need to sit on something soft.\n\nThe menu is pricey and we're all poor, so we just got entrees.  I actually had a cocktail to start - the Perfect Pear - with elderflower liqueur, vodka, sage, pear, and vermouth.  There was even a little sage leaf floating in the glass.  It was a wonderful drink, with all the flavors I love.  Still, for the price, I think the portion was a little stingy.  When I buy an $11 cocktail, I like it to really fill the glass.  We nibbled on warm bread while we waited, and all tried their pesto on top - I think it was an unusual homemade pesto, something like walnut-watercress?  It was a bit bland - I think regular basil pesto would've been a better choice.\n\nThings got better during the actual dinner.  I ordered the Heritage Farms Chicken which was juicy and fresh, and served with a tangy pasta.  Each little detail of the dish was well-chosen - honestly, even the grilled baby squash was outstanding.  It's just squash!  But somehow, it was heavenly.  My friend enjoyed her Cioppino, and my boyfriend liked his veal tortellini, complete with rich pieces of lobster.  I tried a little bit, and it was tasty - very herbal and really bursting with flavor.  The only dish that fell a little flat was the potato gnocchi - my friend's boyfriend ordered it.  Actually he liked most of it very much, but he couldn't get past the aggressive bitterness of the turnip greens.  I tasted them too, and I have to say - it was off-putting.  Perhaps that's just the way turnip greens are, but it really didn't work for us in the dish.  Fortunately, the waitress was incredibly kind and helpful, and brought him out a new plate sans greens, which he finished happily.\n\nWe also had a few desserts - vanilla bean creme brulee for us, flourless chocolate torte for them.  I didn't taste it, but apparently it was incredibly rich.  I enjoyed our creme brulee - because I enjoy all creme brulee - although the roasted quince on top didn't quite work for me.  \n\nOverall, the meal ranged between good and very good, but the great service from our waitress really pushed this to a 4 star rating.  I had hoped to be a little more wowed by the food.  But this experience was definitely positive enough to warrant a second visit for dinner.  I think it'd be a nice place to go for a special occasion, or if you feel like a little splurge on a flavorful meal.", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-11-29", "type": "review"}

We sat outside and atmosphere was cozy under the tent with the warm colors of the decor. Our waitress was incredibly friendly and presented us with the menus. I think it is great they have a prix fixe brunch - 1 alchy or nonalchy drink, an appetizer and an entree - but for $24. It looks like they have since raised the prices since Miles O. went. I felt it was just a tad steep and a lot of food but took the plunge anyway. I ordered the smoked salmon for the appetizer and the mushroom omlette for my entree, and had a hot coffee (they did not have ice coffee though offered to put ice with hot coffee if I wanted it). The waitress brought out some delicious mini baked treats before we got our dishes - poppy scone (on the crispier side but delicious), blueberry muffins and biscuits, which were all buttery goodness. After eating these I was getting a little full and then after my appetizer I realized I probably should not have gotten the prix fixe but could have would have should have. I ended up boxing half of my omlette entree.

If you have three people with you, forget about mingling!  \n\nAlso, the service was very iffy.  There was a bartender, and then a server for the bar area (or what it seemed like).  The bartender got us our drinks, but never told us a server would be with us.  I figured she was our server too.  But then some other woman came up to us all flustered.  She never introduced herself, just asked what we wanted and kept saying \"okay, okay, okay.\"  Just very odd.  It continued that way the entire time.\n\nI tried the prix fixed brunch for $24, which includes your choice of an alcoholic bevvie (Bloody Mary, Sangria or Mimosa), appetizer and main course.  I had the mimosa, that was the perfect mix (splash of OJ:), Polenta and Eggs Beni.  The cinnamon polenta, which was delish: light, fluffy and warm with dried fruit and almonds on top.

When we arrived, the restaurant was packed but we did not have to wait. We were sat in the beautiful front covered patio area. \n\nWe decided to start our meal with the veal and pork meatballs.

For my entree, I ordered the double cut pork chop and my husband ordered the cioppino. The huge pork chop arrived medium well, as requested, but was still tender and juicy, even better when dipped in the sage jus. In additiion, the bitterness of the braised kale paired well with the smooth, creamy parmesan and proscutto risotto. My husband was also a big fan of the cioppino. The mussels, clams, shrimp, halibut and scallops were cooked to perfection. I was equally impressed with the size of the scallops. We're talking the width of a coffee cup!

However,  1/2 way through dinner it seemed like they were seating those with reservations inside and walk ins outside. \n\nThe place is set up with what would be the patio, enclosed. There are big heaters on the ceilings that are directed straight at the tables. I will say that it was a little too warm and even though the host said he would turn them down, I don't think that was done. \n\nThe waitress came and told us about the menu, took our drink orders and brought us some bread with a yogurt spread and salted butter. I did ask her if the $10 off entr\u00e9e coupon could be used on the pasta entr\u00e9es and I think at that point she began to think that we were poor young kids. But back to that later. . . \n\nTo start we shared the crispy calamari ($11) with capers, lemons, chili and parsley which was probably some of the best calamari ever. It was not chewy and it had the best sauce ever! We also ordered the grilled chickpea flatbread appetizer ($9) which I expected to be a flatbread but actually came as grilled pita with three separate dips - baba ghanoush, hummus and red pepper muhummara. \n\nFor dinner, I ordered the short rib ravioli ($24) which came with swiss chard, oyster mushrooms, roasted shallots and gremolata. This was the more decadent dish ever! When it first came, it had about 6 raviolis and didn't appear to be enough but it was more than enough!\n\nMy husband ordered the Casbah Double Cut Pork Chop ($27) which came with braised kale, prosciutto & parmesan risotto, garlic cream and a sage jus. The pork was very moist and the risotto was cooked perfectly. There were no left overs!\n\nAfter this huge meal, we decided on taking a dessert to go. We both agreed upon the Dark Chocolate Rasberry Bread Pudding ($8). So I asked the waitress if it would travel well since we wanted to take it to go. At that time, she looked at me and asked if we had a toaster oven where we lived. . . Um yes lady we do, in fact we have an oven also AND we own our own home. Despite the comment, we took the dessert home and put it in the oven later that night and we were not disappointed. \n\nOverall the meal was delicious, we got to use two $10 off coupons and I would highly recommend it to anyone.

I was with a large group and did not want to make a scene, so I mentioned it to the server who immediately took my plate away. The manager on duty came out to apologize, which I did appreciate. However, I was a little surprised because when they brought my plate out about 5 minutes later, I could tell that it was the same exact plate. \n\nFirst off, it was not even warm, so if they made my meal on the spot you would think it would be hot, or at the very least warm. I had also substituted bacon for the sausage that normally comes with the entree, and if the chef had made a new plate on the spot, he would probably have sent it out with the sausage (or with a side of bacon again), which he did not (they had served my bacon on the side when they brought it out initially).     Everything was in the exact same place on the plate. I wasn't going to cause a scene, so I pretended to enjoy it, but did not. I was quite repulsed.\n\nin my last review I had said that Casbah was my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. I had mentioned that the Cassericia dish was my favorite but that they had removed it from the menu the last time I tried to order it there for dinner. I received a response from someone at the restaurant that she was not sure why I would think that because it is still offered, and I explained that the waiter told me it was removed from the menu. \n\nI'm not really sure what happened here, but I can tell you this... I don't think that Casbah is my favorite anymore. In fact not only is it not my favorite, it has taken a plunge to the bottom of my list of places to eat. \n\nFor me, if you expect to eat at a top restaurant, the service should be top of the line, and it has just been too inconsistent for my taste.

We went here for a friend's birthday and Casbah was a festive environment. This place is fine dining but it's not stuffy. I tried to keep my fork and knife and the server made jokes about how that's not their style. In addition, the patio is a nice romantic backdrop with overhanging lights and white curtains.\n\nFirst let me talk about the drinks. My husband's moscow mule was a little stronger than most places would make it, but they do have the copper mugs. Some places cheap out on that but not Casbah. I had a delicious house Malbec but then switched over to a Grenache and Carignan blend. It was the first time I've had such a mix and I was so happy with my choice that I ended up ordering another glass. It was a wonderfully rich and bold (but not bitter) combination that was a superb pairing to our dinner entrees.\n\nFor starters I had the octopus, which was ok but not great. There was too much of a char flavor so it was almost burnt. The tuna however was an explosion of flavor. It was fresh and very flavorful.\n\nFor my main dish, I had the duck. I double checked with the waitress when I ordered to make sure the skin was crispy and it was indeed. The meat was perfectly tender and the sauce was sweet and savory.\n\nEveryone at the table thoroughly enjoyed their meals. The lamb shank is so large you need to get a takeaway bag. \n\nThe birthday boy's wife arranged for an ice cream before we got to dinner. The waitress seamlessly distracted us with dessert menus while she got the cake ready, so she really added to the birthday fun.\n\nAll in all, this place really impressed.

Sweet niblets. I had a glass of Michel-Schlumberger Pinot Noir that was so good that my eyes actually crossed. CRAZY good.

I have never had a bad experience here and the owner and staff are fabulous.  The North Side has struggled for years to try to gentrify and it's been a slow process. If more places like The Park House would open in the neighborhood the effect could be exponential.\n\nI've been a patron for just about a year on the dot.  I can honestly say that I drove by more than a few times and didn't stop (even though friends recommended it) because I didn't know what I would find.  Boy, I wish I had that time back!  \nI'll start with FREE... popcorn, peanuts in the shell, great people, and music - yes, live music for FREE.  And, it's all good. Now, to elaborate...\n\nI live in Lawrenceville and crossing a river to go to a place in Pittsburgh is nearly unheard of. But, the people here are so awesome, I can't stay away.  Young, old, hippies, hipsters, locals, and happen-uponers all converging to create an amazing atmosphere.  Last night, there was a woman and her family from Seattle in addition to the familiar faces I usually see.  As other reviewers mentioned, it is like CHEERS - it only takes a couple of visits before folks on both sides of the bar know your name and you!  \n\nOf course the free snacks are awesome, they're free - and you can just toss your peanut shells wherever you'd like (my mom would be horrified to watch me throw them on the floor :)  BUT, THE MENU... WOAH.  Zamir makes his own hummus, falafel, tabuouli, and golani.  OMG it's ALL FABULOUS!  Last week I tried the golani platter for the first time -- a golani patty, hummus, feta, and tomatoes, served with pita.  The golani made me smile - spinach, carrots, spices, cheese -- it makes you want to eat your veggies!  I really had to decide last night between the golani platter and the Peace in the Middle East (tabouli, hummus, falafel, pita).  I was really craving the \"falafel master\" delicacy, so Peace it was.\n\nBeer. Um, there is a lot of it... imports, crafts, and domestics.  If you can't find something to drink here then you must not be thirsty.  I think there are 20 taps... I've never actually counted, but a chalkboard boasts their fine selection (stop in and count them, and let me know).  I'm a micro dork and have always been completely overwhelmed by my choices during any given beer season.  Also, there is a \"worst beer\" (it's never bad) discounted selection and some \"last chance\" items that are usually around $4/bottle or glass. \n\nNow, music can be a tricky thing. But like everything else here, it's never steered me away.  Every Wednesday is a bluegrass jam in the rear of the establishment.  Mostly it's members of the Shelf Life String Band, but they are often joined by folks who just want to sit in and play.  You may hear some bluegrass versions of Radiohead, The Coasters, Gorillaz in addition to \"trad-grass\" favorites.  Every Friday night there is live music by local and touring musicians and, like the popcorn and peanuts, IT'S ALWAYS FREE!\n\nBring your appetite and your friends down for a night of great company and amazing atmosphere...

I thought about how well German potato salad would taste with that beer.  So I grabbed a seat at the bar and eagerly awaited the first taste of my beer.\n\nAnd I waited...and waited...and waited some more - for over 15 minutes before someone came around to take the order.  Actually that isn't quite accurate.  Two employees came around - one to the end of the bar, and one behind the bar directly opposite me.  Both of them stared at me.  Neither one greeted me or asked me what I would have like to order.  I stared back, incredulously, and even made a \"what's going on here\" palms-extended-upward-shoulder-shrug gesture.  Neither one took the hint.\n\nFinally a third employee came around the bar and took my order.  Great, I thought to myself, finally that beer.  She served the beer in a Mason jar.  WTF?!?  Who serves imported German lager at a German restaurant in a freaking Mason jar?  Max's does.  The beer was devoid of its head, likely the result of a bad beer pour and/or a less than perfectly clean glass (an endemic problem with Pittsburgh restaurants, in my observation).  I was sad.  I quaffed my beer quickly in an attempt to salve my irritation and opened the menu.\n\nMy first impression of the menu can be summed as follows: \"Uh-oh\".  The menu is huge with a number of \"slow-food\" stews and braises.  The restaurant is more than half-empty.  How can a restaurant prepare such a large number of menu items, including more than a few labor-intensive dishes, freshly every day and still stay in business when the place isn't even half-full?  Answer: They can't.  The food isn't fresh.\n\nI ordered the Wiener Schnitzel.  I love properly prepared Wiener Schnitzel.  Made with fresh butterflied veal breast, slightly pounded and seasoned, well-coated in fresh bread crumbs, and pan-fried in clarified butter until golden brown on the outside and juicy on the inside, Wiener Schnitzel is the ultimate comfort food.  \n\nSadly, Max's Wiener Schnitzel had nothing to do with properly prepared Schnitzel.  The veal was super-thin, had a texture that strongly suggested it had been mechanically processed, and tasted as if it was pre-breaded and frozen.  It wasn't pan fried either.  The breaded, frozen, puck was simply dropped into a fryolater - where the breading puffed out and fell off of the meat in places (which doesn't happen when the cutlet is resting against the cooking surface under its own weight as when the dish is properly pan-fried).  The edges of the sad Schnitzel had curled up and it looked a horrible mess on the plate.  Curly Schnitzel?!?  My stomach dropped.\n\nMy sides, German potato salad and braised red cabbage, were equally awful.  The German potato salad had an unnatural glossy sheen - the kind that typically comes from bottled sauces that contain high fructose corn syrup.  The \"bacon\" in the dressing was nothing more than tiny flecks of some sort of processed, possibly faux, \"meat\".  The potatoes were suspiciously uniform in thickness and roundness - exactly the homogeneity that is found in pre-peeled, pre-sliced, vacuum-sealed processed potatoes.  It was a gluey, sickly sweet, mess.  I didn't have more than a bite or two.  The braised red cabbage didn't taste fresh - it tasted like it had been sitting in a steam table for a day or two and my order was its last chance to be eaten.  \n\nMax's Allegheny Tavern bills itself on their web site as, \"The Best in German Fare.  The Best in Service\".\n\nThat's total bullshit.  It's awful - both for service and fare.\n\nIf you want good, authentic, German fare (in which the Schnitzel is properly pan-fried to order and delicious), join the Teutonia Mannerchor down the street.  \n\nI'll never return.", "business_id": "IxQ1ATP_Wg_QujO9nywzcQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2008-11-12", "type": "review"}

They were cozy, but the seats reminded me of old fashioned church pews. Our waitress soon brought us a little basket of four rolls with butter, sauerkraut relish, and apple butter. Though I liked the different varieties of bread, it was nothing special. The relish and apple butter were a nice touch though.\n\nOur waitress was busy with both waiting tables and tending the bar, but she managed to check on us pretty frequently. Our food also came out relatively promptly. I order the Wiener Schnitzel with Potato Pancakes and Spatzle on the side. The Wiener Schnitzel was amazing -- by far the best I've ever had! The veal was tender and the fried surface was perfectly crispy. However, the sides sadly did not match this main dish. The Potato Pancakes were oddly bitter, and I did not enjoy them with either the sour cream or applesauce. I only ate two or three bites and completely stopped eating them. (I must add that Hofbrauhaus's potato pancakes are delicious and something that I order every time that I go there.) I also did not enjoy the Spatzle, but I am accustomed to eating cheese Spatzle.... So I may be reviewing this harshly since I'm just not used to plain Spatzle, but in my opinion, it was terribly bland and watery.\n\nOverall, Max's Allegheny Tavern served one incredible item (Wiener Schnitzel), but everything else was merely mediocre.

So when my roomate wanted to go there, I was pretty excited. There were 4 of us. Two of us had burgers while the other two ordered wedding soup and shared potato skins. My burger was delicious. It was juicy and smothered in bleu cheese. \n\nWhile my food was really good, there were some issues with the other items ordered. Two of my guests cited that the wedding soup had a metalic taste to it while my other friend with the burger found a hair. Being a hairdresser and understanding that it does happen sometimes, she disregarded it and continued to eat her burger. Unfortunately, the hair did not stop there. Another guest found several hairs in their meal as well. We decided that we should let our waitress know. I stopped the waitress and explained how there was hair in two people's food. The waitress got upset and was very rude (it's not like we accused her of planting the hair herself). On top of this, she mistakenly took my burger and walked away with it, leaving the sullied food on the table. When she came back I told her that my burger was not one of the items with food on it and she instantly became defensive. At this point we asked for a manager (who never came) and insisted our meal get comped. Considering she threw out the only good food that we ordered, we didn't feel like that was asking too much. Luckily the waitress did not put up too much of a fight. \n\nI will never eat at Bado's again.

I want around seven on a Monday night, also Columbus Day if that has any impact, and there was really no crowd.  My server, Barry, was very nice and was very good.\n\nRight off the bat, I'll explain why am taking two stars away. The service was a little bit too fast for me between my two courses as within maybe three minutes of my salad being taken away my pizza came right out. Normally I'm a fan of fast service but that was a little bit too fast for me. I'm also taking a star off, and whoever reads this review will probably think this is a stupid reason but this review is my opinion, because the salads with the exception of a few or overpriced compared to the other appetizers.\n\nI had the grilled portobello mushroom salad and the 4 cut margherita pizza. \n\nThe salad was huge but great, the house Italian dressing complemented the salad really well. The salad was a nice mix of mushroom and greens, though I'd have preferred a bigger helping of greens. Of course you're not going to like this salad if you don't like mushrooms. \n\nThe pizza was tasty and pretty well done. Oh my goodness was it tasty. You could really taste the tomatoes and basil playing off each other and neither was overpowered by the cheese. Secondly, the tomatoes tasted fresh, not like the canned, heavily processed kind or tomato paste but like the diced San Marzanno organic tomatoes you can buy at fancier grocery stores. That went a long way for me with the pizza. \n\nThe con for the pizza: I have to say it was weird to me that the crust was this weird mix of crispy and kind of hard to cut and then perfectly chewy. The actual bottom of the pizza was crispy, like it should be so the pizza doesn't fall apart, but it was a little too crispy for my tastes as there were a couple points where I had a hard time cutting the pizza into bite-size pieces. I also have to comment that two of my slices, the two that I ended up bringing home because I was stuffed, hadn't been fully cut apart and that was a little annoying.

My husband had the Angry Tiki and said that it seemed to have too much going on, but he ate all of it and thought it was still quite tasty. We also ordered a side of D's Chips and were offered a choice of sauce to dip them in. I declined but am thinking now it would have been better to take a sauce. The chips were good, don't get me wrong... But if you're offered sauce, go for the sauce! You don't have to use it, right?\n\nWe will definitely be back. Hopefully on a Saturday again so that we can go for a Bloody Mary and buy a 6-pack to go.", "business_id": "2X5G4Ujq0s4Wfn4TC7gX0g", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-10-24", "type": "review"}

After trying a battleship sub this weekend, I can say without reservation that the subs here are the best in PGH, without a doubt.  If you haven't tried one, you need to ASAP!\n\nGiven that I've been wanting to try a battleship for a long while, a friend and I decided to pick one up and have a picnic in nearby Frick Park.  We called in our order, and they gave us an estimate of about 45 min., which worked well given that we had other errands to run.  By the time we arrived at Triangle, our battleship was ready, so we were able to cut in line, pay ($14.75), and be off to have our picnic.\n\nUnwrapping the sub, it was immediately apparent that it encompassed 26\" of goodness.  Since it wasn't pre-cut, I tore it in half crosswise, which gave each of us 14\" to chow down on. The sub was generously filled with meats and cheeses, with a sufficient but not overwhelming amount of vegetables.  The bread was substantial and of good quality, and didn't tear or crumble as we ate our portions of the sub, as lesser quality bread does.  I ate half of my portion, and my friend was unable to finish his, despite intending to do so.  I ate the other half for lunch the next day, and it was almost just as good as it was upon receipt.\n\nBoth my friend and I were very impressed with the quality of the battleship, and it kept us full for a subsequent long-ish walk in the park.  I'd highly recommend it as an ideal picnic item.

They have friendly service, a few outdoor tables and a huge bar. It's a pretty lounge-y vibe. \n\nThere is a decent wine/beer list, and also specialty cocktails. Both times, I tried the sushi, which was not bad at all - not comparing to a Japanese restaurant, but for a bar it was done well. The spicy one was really hot, topped with a jalepeno: nice touch.

There weren't any signs or notes anywhere about happy hour specials, so I asked our bartender. I cannot remember everything that she stated, but I zoned in when she mentioned $2 off Martinis. I chose the cucumber basil martini and my friend did the same. Too strong for me- even with the basil infused vodka and fresh cucumber, my friend on the other hand found it light and refreshing. \n\nWe weren't that hungry so we decided to split an appetizer and order salads. We split the chicken quesadilla appetizer and both ordered house salads. I modified my house salad to have feta rather than blue cheese and chose the strawberry vinaigrette as my dressing. \n\nThe quesadillas were good, as far as chicken quesadillas go.

The service was amazing, and we never wanted for anything.  Every need was met before we could even ask.\n\nI started out with the Orange Dreamsicle martini, and while it was on the sweet side, it was delicious!  If I return, I will definitely get another one of these.  Not strong alcohol wise but yummy.\n\nWe ordered the scallops and Asian fusion calamari for appetizers.  My friend was super upset with the scallops and thought they tasted bad.  I don't really know anything about scallops so I ate them.  He complained to the manager, and the manager was nice enough to take 1/2 off, which I thought was really nice considering it wasn't stopping me from eating them.  (#PoorKidProblems).  The calamari was really unique but delicious.  The actual calamari was good, but it was covered in some sauce similar to stir fry sauce.  It was good, and the portion was a really fair size for the price.\n\nI then moved onto the Key Lime Pie martini.  It was a let down after the Dreamsicle, but there was nothing wrong with it.

It was totally worth it! \n\nWe arrived around midnight on a Friday (well, technically Saturday I guess) and there still was a decent crowd being the place is downtown. We ordered our drink upstairs and eventually made our way back downstairs and sat outside so my boyfriend and his friends could smoke. The upstairs is fairly big and definitely had enough room so you don't feel packed together. There is your basic bar seating, as well as couches and chairs that give it a lounge sort of feel. It didn't take anytime at all for a friendly bartender to notice us and take our drink order. \n\nThey had a lot of really interesting sounding drinks, but we decided to go with the Pumpkin Spice martini because it's October (like, duh!!). Wow! Now, I'm not one for martinis as I have mentioned in previous reviews for other places, but this was amazing! The best martini I've ever had. So delicious and super easy to take down, yet you could still taste the alcohol so you know they didn't short you. \n\nAfter spending some time upstairs, we traveled downstairs to check out the first floor. There was definitely a different vibe. It was slightly older and not as bumping. I also got to take a peak at their menu because I would love to come back and try their food. \n\nAs I mentioned above, we ended our night outside as they have a few tables and chairs. This is always the best because sometimes it's nice to escape the madness of a bar, especially if you're out with smokers.

There was enough seating that no one seemed to be without an option, and the setup was cozy and intimate. Our families were able to sit in medium to large groups together, with smaller high tops for two available as well. The VIP area was used for food setup. We did not need to provide decorations - the atmosphere is already perfect and the tables really do not allow for much additional adornment.  There was enough space to allow for dancing, and ample space for coats. The back bar was used for our dessert/cookies and they added a table at the entrance for our gifts, cards, and guest book.\n\nWe chose a variety of cold/hot appetizers and penne pasta, sliders, and truffle fries as our main dishes. Everything was served on small plates. The food was incredible, and the wait staff were attentive and abundant. There was a great selection of draft and bottled beer, and numerous martini options within our price range. We selected the S'mores Martini as our signature drink (we love to camp) and it was very well-received. The General Manager, Brandon, was so responsive and incredibly helpful throughout the entire process. We were able to plan the entire event via email which was super convenient. When I selected certain menu items that he did not feel would be the best options, he pointed me in the direction of others (without inflating our bill). The portioning was right on and there were no surprises at the end of the evening.\n\nIf you are looking to host a non-traditional wedding reception (we did not have a DJ - we brought our own iPod) and are ok with unassigned seating and a more relaxed cocktail party feel, this is a perfect choice - especially for smaller receptions. Most other options in the city came with food and beverage minimums that would not have been achievable with our small number of guests.\n\nWe are so happy we decided on Olive or Twist for our wedding and would do it again in a heartbeat.", "business_id": "OxIeMVcop5oxBUWANi-1Rw", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-10-20", "type": "review"}

Mmmmm, \"winner\" might be the wrong choice of words.  Interesting, maybe.  There were highs, there were lows.  \n\nLet's hit the \"lows\" first and end on a \"high\" note.  My companion and fellow Yelper, Ricardo, and I took comfortable barstools at the end of the long, well-stocked bar.  The female bartender came over and said to me, \"What do you want, Grandma?\"  Really?  This is a chick who depends upon the kindness of strangers for her tips?  I laughed it off with a pointed comment to her as Ricardo and I looked at each other with mild shock and amusement.  Fortunately, she redeemed herself later.  (Full disclosure....yes, I AM a grandmother several times over, but.....)  \n\nAnother Yelper joined us a little while later and was the object of quite a bit of interest from owner and a friend of his/customer at the other end of the bar.  Some good natured kidding is one thing, but it bordered on creepy....especially after the two of them later came uninvited into the Yelp Event (smoking horrible-smelling cigars!)  to see her later in the evening! Precautions were taken to assure our fellow Yelper got to her destination safely.\n\nThe highs.   I ordered a Dark n Stormy which the bartender had never heard of, but the owner told her how to make and sent her downstairs to get a few bottles of some really good ginger beer.  The drink was assembled in a double old-fashioned glass with an amazingly large pour of Goslings rum - far more than a double!  She added just a splash of ginger beer and a healthy squeeze of lime.  Although it wasn't the best DnS I've ever had, it certainly packed the most good, dark rum.  And at the Happy Hour price of $4.50, it was certainly the best value in a DnS I've ever had!\n\nThe fries at Mahoney's are another high.  Crisp, fresh fries, perfectly salted and another bargain at less than $2. The bartender was friendly and fun....well, after she warmed up a bit!  Good prices, good food, good drinks....the highs.

Our waitress never refilled our waters (we also had beer) and never returned to our table after the food was dropped off. When we asked for a refill on the water and were deciding on dessert she was short with us and snapped \"just tell me how many waters you want' that made our dessert decision pretty easy.

The people who drink there are friendly and when I've gone there with my husband we've been just left alone to drink and relax and when I've gone there with female friends old guys sometimes talk to us in a totally jovial/friendly/non-threatening way, but I've never had a problem just having my own space.\n\nThe bartenders are so sweet and as I said, very generous with their pours.\n\nSeriously, I love Armand's Bar.

There were nine people in the bar section. It was nice out so we sat out there anyway. When our food was ready she knocked on the window and I had to go in to the bar and bring our food out to the table,  so it's got a nice authentic touch of waiting your own table yet paying someone else to do it. Eventually realized that she was doing this because she was screwing a waitress out of the table and didn't want to be seen. Classy. \n\nSame one was working the last time we went,  it was dead and she still couldn't keep up. Everything she said to anyone was prefaced with \"give me a second I have to get this for these people first\"  and then she would look at her phone.

I lived about an hour and a half outside of the city. Coming here was usually pretty exciting. (Here as in the city, not Silky's.) I had a friend who lived here in the East End and on the street I reside on now. \n\nSeveral times we found ourselves at Silky's Pub. I love the corner building, the way it looks out onto Liberty Ave. It looks so welcoming. Especially in the summer. Outdoor seating, always pretty well packed with people.\n\nI'll come right out and say that the crowd that frequents Silky's isn't my usual crowd, but unlike some bars I'd never had an issue with someone wanting to start a fight with us because we look like a bunch of dirty malcontents. This place is just not our usual dive bar.\n\nThursday night my boyfriend texted me that he was there with a mutual friend. Living less than a city block from there I headed over. I needed a beer and some hockey/world series action to distract me after the Halloween parade. It was as busy as usual. A few seats remaining and I managed to snag one right at the bar, front and center.\n\nI hate to say this because I don't remember this happening years ago when I went there. I was not even acknowledged. I get flagging down a bartender in a crazy busy bar in the South Side on a Friday night. I don't like it but I get it. This was a moderately steady Thursday night. I wasn't standing behind the people's sitting at the bar. I was the person sitting at the bar. There were two male bartenders both bartenders asked the guy next to me multiple times if he wanted anything else to drink. \n\nBy \"multiple times\" I mean 6 or 8 times. The person sitting directly beside me. They wouldn't look at me. I tried to make eye contact with either of them and it was as if I wasn't even there. Eventually the boyfriend's beer emptied as well. This is about 20 minutes after I arrived. I've had people walk in and stand behind us and the bar tender or waitress was on them immediately. After another 5 minutes of the boyfriend's beer being perched precariously on the edge of the bar and the bartenders standing there chatting he had to ask the bartender for a refill and if I could have a drink.\n\nThe bartender looks up at him, grabs his pint glass angrily from the bar and says, \"Oh, you wanted another?\" \n\nReally? I was so angry at that point that it took everything I had not to ask the guy what his issue was.  I later saw him drop a pint glass and stumble into something so many he was drunk.\n\nThe food that other people ordered smelled and looked great. Even the seafoody bits which I normally hate smelling. The tv's are plentiful and newer. I just don't know if I'll ever get to go back and try the food as I hate being slighted by a business owner and treated as if my business isn't appreciated.", "business_id": "3zgswf_NfBJpeAoWeTkgMA", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-10-29", "type": "review"}

Silky's also boasts a shuffleboard table and darts to keep people busy and having fun.  The shuffleboard is a must to try.\n2.  The beer and food are grade A bar quality.

Tonight, we sat outside and our waitress (Nikki) walked past us four times without making eye contact.  In fairness, I dont think it's an issue with the waitress being bad as much as they really need to hire more waitresses, bc it seemed like there was only one waitress for the entire restaurant.\n\nOur tabletop was sticky and so after waiting for 20 min for service I decided I really needed a drink and went inside.  The bartender (Olivia) did not want to serve me bc we were sitting outside.  \"Your waitress will be right with you.\"  me:  \"But you are here now, can I please have a Shocktop Wheat?\"  \"Ill tell the waitress.\"  me:  \"Please may i just have my beer?\"  She served me, but then the waitress walked up to me and was like, \"Oh, I didn't see you, weren't you outside?\"  If you didn't see me how would you notice I was outside?\n\nIts ok, I felt bad for her bc she was so busy but like--I'm easy to please.  All I needed was a beer.  I got one, so the waitress and I were then \"cool.\"  She then proceeded to never come back to our table, but that's ok i think we pissed her off.\n\nThis has been a common thread:  not enough waitstaff so you have to beg for your food or drinks when the wait staff does come by.  It's extremely frustrating.\n\nThe time before last we were there we ordered food and the waitress told us that we could expect to wait over an hour bc they had a group of 15 come in.  We thought she was kidding, and had our beers, so we rolled with it but she was not kidding.  We waitied over an hour for our food and the waitress made no apologies.  Also, our friend came and ordered food before ours came out, and this was around 10:30.  after waiting and waiting and waiting we asked the waitress for an ETA on his burger, but it turned out she forgot to put it in, and hte kitchen had closed.\n\nThe service sucks but what really sucks is the staff is never apologetic about it bc this place is a neighborhood bar w locals so they kind of dont care about apologizing bc they know you'll be back.\n\nBut I come here bc like I said the food is ok, but you've got to come here and be very very patient.", "business_id": "3zgswf_NfBJpeAoWeTkgMA", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-10-05", "type": "review"}

I understand it is a PITT bar but with 95% of the bar focused on the LSU/Alabama game you would think they could have moved the PITT game to a corner TV and use the center TV with sound for the majority of the bar that was concerned in the 'Epic' game. They did switch the games around while PITT was at half but as soon as that game started the LSU game was back relegated to the corner. The manager even made some comment that our group didn't appreciate but whatever it's not like I will be back anytime soon. If you are looking for some good bar food I say stop on by. If you are looking to watch a big game outside of Pennsylvania sports you may want to choose elsewhere or be relegated to the corner without sound.", "business_id": "7XXmky6YYjsvKFwho_eavg", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-11-21", "type": "review"}

We were walking down Liberty and went into Lot 17 on a lark. I wish that lark would have kept me going down Liberty Ave. to find somewhere else with tastier grub.\n\nWhen we walked into the restaurant, it was totally dead aside from one other table of diners. I figured the place should be bustling since it was such a delightful day outside, but I soon came to realize why the place was a ghost town.\n\nThe simple lunch menu of burgers, sandwiches, salads, and wraps is nice and compact. I chose a turkey burger and regular fries, which arrived in a timely fashion. The fries were tasty... after I salted them. There was absolutely no salt of them when they came out. The turkey burger was seasoned well, but it was dry as a bone. I suspect the turkey patty was frozen, but the burger was so overcooked, I cannot say for sure.\n\nOur server was attentive and friendly. The building is clean, polished, and has some nice HDTVs. \n\nWhen I chose  to go to Lot 17, I figured I was trying it out for the first time. After we ate lunch, I realized I had gone there once in the past for lunch with other co-workers. What does this mean? Lot 17 is ultimately a forgettable lunch destination.

Sure, where do you wanna go?\n\nYou should really have an easy answer to that question when someone asks you, but lately I haven't.  I've lived in Bloomfield for two years now, and have yet to identify \"my spot.\"  I love the neighborhood -- great restaurants, bars, local business, art spaces, etc.  I like several of the bars, but just haven't figured out which is my go-to spot.  \n\nLast night I asked a friend to meet me for a beer and she suggested Lot 17.  It is literally right around the corner from me.  (And when I say literally, I do NOT mean \"figuratively,\" which so many people do, by accident I suppose, but they're saying exactly the opposite of what they mean! Grrr)  It's right around the corner, and since I had actually never been in, I thought it was a perfect choice.\n\nThe first thing you notice is the classy wooden decor.  Everything is all really nice hardwood.  It has a very simple style -- the traditional wood, simple chalk board beer list, a couple of nice HD TVs -- none of which stands out or tries too hard to grab your attention.  The bar and a few tables are in the front while several more tables for dining line the back area.\n\nIt was nearly empty.  We were there late -- from about 10-11pm -- on a freezing cold Tuesday night.  A young couple sat quietly at the bar, another guy in the corner chatted up the bartender, and I grabbed a seat a little further down the bar.  I ordered a Full Pint Festivus draft, which is a great brown ale from a brewery in North Versailles that I've heard wonderful things about.  \n\nAfter a few sips my friend came in and joined me.  She had a Guiness, I had another Festivus, we chatted about this and that.  It was quiet, low key, and comfortable.  It's a place that looks really nice yet had a friendly almost dive-y vibe.  I was only there for an hour and no one else was really there, so I shouldn't jump to conclusions.  However, I will definitely be plopping myself down at that classic bar again in the near future, and who knows, maybe Lot 17 will become my neighborhood go-to spot for grabbing a beer on a whim.\n\nThere was a new, shiny, fancy looking, electronic jukebox that I will definitely have to give a try next time!

Salmon BLT (Grilled salmon served on hoagie roll with dill mayo, bacon, lettuce, and tomato) $12.00\n3.

The turkey club also had a lot of flavor to it as well and the garlic mayo gave it a nice touch. The salmon BLT was not as good as the ones I have had at Piper's Pub but still adequate.

At the time, it was the premier cigar shop in the Pittsburgh area. The owner, Frank Jernigan (in his own day a legend among tobacconists, if you go back that far), greeted me at the door with a handshake, personally showed me the humidor and, seeing as I was just getting started, took time with recommendations to help me get started.\n\nThis place had that \"place where everyone knows your name\", which even included outings for barbecues and such, until about 2004-2005, when unfortunately Mr. Jernigan became ill and passed on.  \n\nThe store changed hands, the selection and the \"regular contingent\" both declined.  Within a few months the only thing that remained of the old Jernigan's was the name on the door.  The \"everyone knows your name\" crowd mostly filed out (a few died or moved to Florida, many of the rest started going to other shops in the area they were already familiar with) and it quickly took on a \"dive bar\" atmosphere.  The straw that broke the camel's back (for me) was when another patron physically attacked me because I have a Masters of Business Adminstration (MBA) degree and he thought \"MBAs\" in his company were hassling him at work, so obviously it was my fault, right?  (Sound like dive-bar behavior?)  Not so much that it happened, but the staff's attitude that his behavior was acceptable.  I stopped going there, instead going to other shops, and I didn't stop to explain why.  Betrayal of loyalty goes both ways.\n\nIt was right after this the place transitioned from \"cigar lounge\" to this \"cigar shop/Irish pub with bar food\" hybrid thing and every thing I heard about it told me I had even less reason to give it another chance than before.  When I found out the place had been seized by a bankruptcy court, it felt like the Karma train scored a direct hit.\n\nThe cautionary tale is: when you buy an established \"name\" business with an already-in-place loyal clientele that spends a significant portion of their discretionary income at your shop, don't ignore them in an effort to push through some \"concept\" vision they're verbally telling you they don't want, especially when they're ALREADY patronizing your competition on the side.  Improve the EXISTING concept, make it more profitable, and use the revenues to build your concept separately.\n\nI saw this coming in 2005.", "business_id": "3obPG5F_6rbAu86CuiNW4g", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-09-13", "type": "review"}

Well, maybe except for the humorous menu that made me smile.  The waitress was so below average, you know the type... she is doing you a favor by taking your order.  I had the pierogies appetizer which was flavorless potato filling served in a overcooked pasta shell served in vegetable oil with maybe one or two slices of onions.  Come on!  This is Pittsburgh. You should be ashamed.  Then another server brought my burger and I made the unforgivable mistake of asking her to grab me another beer.  Sorry, I know you are not the one who took my order, but you are bringing my food.  I've made this mistake before and usually the person says \"okay, I'll let your server know\", not \"Ummmm, I'm not serving you,, you'll have to talk to your server\".  Funny, I thought you might run into each other in the back.  Anyways, the burger was close to inedible burnt to a crisp resembled a hockey puck.  We also tried the hummus which was pretty good.  I ordered a kettle one with cranberry and was brought absolut.  Friends ordered a chicken sandwich and a chicken salad.  They both said they were pretty good, if not a little dry.

The temperature was just about perfect for a fall night to eat out on their patio. The outside seating gives a really nice atmosphere to wind down after a long day at work. Now I know why people like coming here for Happy Hour. The inside has a nice lounge area, also good for getting to know your co-workers outside of the office structure. I give it a good solid 4 stars for the restaurant itself.\n\nThe food is okay too. I had the Lettuce Pray - seared tuna and grilled peppers with lettuce to wrap it all in. I liked it; it was a nice small snack to accompany my beer. I did enjoy the entertaining menu names. The beer selection is not that big, but they have an ok variety to choose from.  For the food, I'll give it 2.5 stars because, although it wasn't bad, it also wasn't anything to remember. \n\n3 stars for Harris Grill.

Harris has a healthy selection of cocktails, beer, and wine, just like Shiloh does, which is perfectly alright by me. \n\nThe Goat cheese appetizer is served cold with warm pieces of pita.

It's just very filling.\n\nFor my entree I went with the Jamaican chicken tacos, and they were absolutely perfect.

Though I trust her recommendations, I really wasn't anticipating that much. The name -- Harris Grill -- seemed a little ho-hum, and I was expecting your typical Pittsburgh-type place with basic appetizers and lots of Yuengling.\n\nHowever, as soon as I sat down, I knew this place was going to be different. First of all, it was packed! The cute little patio had lots of young professionals ranging in attire from girls in maxi dresses to guys wearing dress pants, button-ups, and ties. Thankfully, one of my friends had arrived a few minutes before 5pm and secured the last available table on the patio. Lots of local residents were taking advantage of the absolutely incredible weather to sit outside.\n\nAfter quickly becoming intimidated by the enormous drink \"book,\" I just took my friend's recommendation and ordered a frozen cosmo. Wow! Delicious!! It was the perfect blend of cold but not too icy and not too sweet but not too sour. I could drink these things every day! Well, maybe not every day... because they pack a serious punch! I was warned not to order the additional shot when it was offered to me, and thankfully I heeded the warning. After two of these beverages, I was definitely tipsy! In my opinion, two of these little frozen cosmos pack the same amount of buzz as 3-4 glasses of wine.\n\nIn addition to amazing frozen cosmos, I enjoyed trying their appetizers. The spinach dip and pita was tasty, and the pierogies, though very different from the pierogies that I have had in the past, were out-of-this-world good. I was tempted to order a second round of the pierogies but didn't want to appear gluttonous. \n\nService was pretty good, especially considering how busy the restaurant was and how tightly we were packed onto the little patio. Our waiter both resembled and acted like Conan O'Brien, which was just the icing on the cake of a great happy hour experience.\n\nAnd, finally, the check arrived. My jaw nearly fell on the floor. Three of us girls drank 7 frozen cosmos and ate 3 appetizers... for $40. How is that even possible? If I had known in advance that the frozen cosmos were $3/each, I might have just chugged them and taken a cab home.\n\nNeedless to say, I'll be back!", "business_id": "rgmptwPbBH1wLpiBHcbIhA", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-09-08", "type": "review"}

I always get the \"Thanksgiving in Blawnox\" burger, which includes turkey, cranberries, sage stuffing, and a wonderful rosemary aioli! Yum! Just thinking about me has me ready to go tomorrow! I also ordered the Henny Penny chicken sandwich, which was a little too \"black\" (burnt) for me. The service has always been good and the ambiance is always pretty much there! Sometimes, on a busy night, you feel like you're on top of the table beside you, but with food like Harris', it doesn't even matter!", "business_id": "rgmptwPbBH1wLpiBHcbIhA", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-09-10", "type": "review"}

Hey 'Burgh...what's up with all your decent establishments being closed on a Sunday?  Harris Grill wasn't, and we're certainly thankful for that.\n\nThis review should actually reflect 4.5 or 4.75 stars if possible- just a neat place.  We ventured over and found parking without issue.  I can imagine on a Friday or Sat evening this might be a little more challenging.  Since it was a beautiful fall evening, we opted to sit outside and we were approached quickly by our waitress with water, and asked for a moment to review the hysterical drink menu.  Much props to a place that doesn't take itself too seriously.  Just read the menu and if you have an ounce of humor in your body, you should at least salts (smile a little then stop).  I salt because LOL is so yesterday.\n\nI opted for the manly Sangria, which was outstanding, and she got some lemonade concoction with vodka.  Both were hits.  We also read a lot about the hummus, so we were followers and went with it...very pleased we did.  A great appetizer.\n\nShe went with the skirt steak mac n cheese.  I went with the lobster and crab mac.  I'm just going to laugh at my kids when I make them microwave mac n cheese from here forward.  THIS is mac n cheese- it's creamy and fattening and has a crunchy topping and soft noodles (but not too soft) and well...it's perfect.  There were generous portions of lobster and crab in my dish and it was delish.  Her steak was seasoned and cooked to perfection.  I was almost jealous I didn't get it, but then I'd grab a huge hunk of seafood and quickly realize the mistake of my ways.  Both are very rich dishes.  If you can finish the big plate of mac, God bless you---you're a better person than I am.  However, it does make for a wonderful breakfast.  Don't judge me.  \n\nShe finished with a dessert type drink that featured Rumchatta and strawberries- not my thing (said the guy who ordered Sangria), but she enjoyed it.  Dessert looked tempting, but the button on my jeans was already stressed, and not wanting to hold my pants up on the walk back to the car, I shook off the waitress and asked for the check.\n\nIf memory serves, 3 drinks, an app and 2 fine dinners came to roughly $75 plus tip, so, roughly $90....and if I lived there, I'd do it at least once a month or more.  The menu is diverse (and funny).  The service is timely and I saw a manager deal with a couple 'difficult' customers in a way that I'd want my manager to treat any customer.  Pittsburgh's lucky to have this place.  When we're back in town, we'll be going here again.", "business_id": "rgmptwPbBH1wLpiBHcbIhA", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-09-30", "type": "review"}

They also had pumpkin sangria). He didn't enjoy his drink too much and i offered for him to try mine because it was delish! Wow, they make an amazing sangria! Bobby also enjoyed it, so we ordered a carafe of this delicious-ness.\n\nFor dinner, Bobby ordered the Thanksgiving burger. It's a turkey burger with cranberry stuffing inside. It sounded really tasty! I almost thought about ordering it before he brought it up. He originally ordered the November throwback of a pork shank, however, someone from the kitchen came upstairs to inform us that it was defrosting since they didn't think another person would order it. It would've been an extra 15-20 minutes which is why he decided on the turkey burger. For his side, he ordered the Mac & Cheese.\n\nFor my dinner, I ordered the ever so popular Henny Penny and a side of \"smashed\" potatoes. The server informed me that the chicken sandwich was a little spicy. I honestly thought i could handle it, and for the most part i did.. but i honestly couldn't finish the last half. It was just so spicy even water wasn't helping. Bobby ended up finishing my other half of sandwich and he gave me his mac&cheese. PS- the mac&cheese is delicious and sooooooo creamy! \n\nFor dessert, we ordered \"The wrongest dessert ever\" (Please see picture to see why it was given this name.) The dessert was on their November throwback menu and consisted of a fried twinkie, two scoops of vanilla ice cream with a raspberry sauce (maybe chocolate sauce as well).. complete with whip cream.

I was told it's the best menu in town, regardless of what food is on it. Years later, I still agree that it's hilarious bringing newcomers here just to read the menu.\n\nThe drink menu is massive and overwhelming, and when you ask for a recommendation they will usually tell you to go with a seasonal item (cocktails or beers) or a manhattan (they also have a full page menu of manhattans.) They currently have a pumpkin sangria that is to die for. The patio is always packed, even when it's cold out, because it's pretty fab.\n\nThe drinks aren't cheap, which is a bummer. Luckily the cocktails really are pretty special, though. Happy hour is good for beers, but that's about all. If you're looking for cocktails to please the manliest of men to the girliest of girls, go to Harris Grill. He can get a manhattan and she can get a dessert chocolate and baileys concoction, or something.\n\nI've been here for all kinds of reasons, but I think it's best for snacks and drinks. The food menu has some Pittsburgh specialties that I would recommend for fun and for out-of-towners, but I've also had many \"tots n beers\" nights that have hit the spot perfectly. (The vego chili is also perfect to pair with a meal or as a snack).\n\nSometimes the drinks are better than others. I have ordered the same manhattan and the same bloody mary on different nights, and they were worlds apart.

Great place for summertime/fall time drinks and dinner. \nUpstairs couch seating. I always like the comfy atmosphere. \n\nFood. Most selections are always really good. Burgers, hummus, spinach dip. They always have a good rotating menu with seasonal apps and entrees. One I love that used to be a regular and returns at times is the Rita Hayworth and the Pork Shank Redemption. Most delicious pork shank! \n\nHappy hour is good with deals on apps and drinks. Beware the frozen Cosmo. While quite delish, get a driver. I swear to you I had two one night and had to stay at a friend's house up the street. \n\n\nThings I don't love. \nMy only disappointment as of late are the seasonal drink features and a lot of the cocktail prices. I had a black walnut Manhattan and while it was very good, it was not $12 good. Prices are never listed for the drinks and they should be. \n\nTo end on a positive, my service has always been great here. It can get quite busy and snotty at times from the customers who feel entitled to their neighborhood and the hosts/hostesses take the brunt of that. They are really accommodating and very diplomatic dealing with the shittiness of some of the customers. That cannot be easy!

Been there a few times now, it's definitely a favorite local hangout. I happen to be in the family of fans of the kitchen sink flavor of their wings. Like others who have commented, the crave will creep up at random times. Most places I'm used to have A wing night, they have 4 wing NIGHTS. That's crazy to me. \nFlavors tried:\n1- honey cajun- has real honey, 1/5 heat\n2- voodoo- an amped up bbq/ hot/ kitchen sink type of sauce in that it's got an unspecified number of ingredients, 5/5 heat (caution fiery hot!)\n3- thai chili- alright, not much thai or chili flavor in my opinion but passable, 1/5 heat\n4- spicy ranch- good flavor, 2/5 heat\nTry mixing them up! voodoo with honey combo is gooood...\nLook forward to trying the other flavors. Yes it's packed, but we always manage to find a table.\nService is good, the waitresses are very friendly and attentive. The juke or the bar'J plays good to exceptional ol'school hip hop, alternative, rock, 80s.. you name it. Have heard very obsolete tunes by Biggie, Tupac that most have never heard, that's some music nerdiness I dig. I see a mixed crowd everytime, not just millenials. There is an outdoor space in back, where smokers can do their thing.\nOverall, great place to catch the game, eat some wings, have some beers, listen to good tunes, and chill ;)\nNow what is in that kitchen sink sauce?! I've got it narrowed down to garlic, parmesan, soy, some tomato product... so much more, I will figure you out!", "business_id": "vSZDiKiF8vf9zt_BcDL7GQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-10-22", "type": "review"}

As I was walking down Walnut Street, I passed by this place and after an initial glance I didn't really think to stop in.  However, thanks to some quick Yelp research I decided to give this place a try and I am definitely glad I did so.\n\nRight out of the gate I noticed that this place proudly bears the exuberant charm of an old school Vegas bar - between the jukebox, the cigarette machine, and the velour decor, I was instantly transported back in time.  I would be remiss if I didn't mention the fully functional retro gold-plated cash register that looks it like a dropped out a time machine from the 60s.  Definitely one of my favorite features adorning this establishment!  I should also point out that this bar has a strong allergy to plastic - no credit accepted so be sure to grab some cash on the way over to avoid the $2 ATM fee per transaction. Not terrible but worth mentioning for the exceedingly budget conscious folks.\n\nOne of the reasons I chose this place was due to its reputation for very strong drinks.  I completely concur with other reviewers that the drinks are as strong as I've ever had any establishment.  Every drink was pretty much a double or even triple compared to any other typical bar.   As you may have imagined, people don't come here for the food.  In fact, the only food they serve are small bags of chips and pretzels kept behind the bar.  I had to leave after an hour or so to go get dinner, though I definitely came back for more nonsense after eating!\n\nThe jukebox has a wide selection of music from the 60s all the way up into the 90s - plenty of options to suit anyone's taste really. Also, as another reviewer noted, this place seems to be popular with hipsters and men in their 60s. In any event, everybody was in good spirits and seemed to be pretty outgoing and open-minded. Most people I spoke with seemed genuinely happy to converse, and either already knew or wanted to get to know one another.  I had some interesting conversations about Pittsburgh and its history with some locally bred patrons.  The bartender was absolutely phenomenal - very sociable and was obviously a big hit with all of the regulars.\n\nI'm staying in Shadyside the rest of the week, and am planning to check out some of the other local spots. That said, it seems Le Mardi Gras is a bit of an insider's secret - a sleeper, perhaps - where only those in the know appreciate it for what it is.  I definitely recommend you stop by next time you're in the area, at least for a drink or two. As long as you don't mind the smoking, a couple drinks will put you well on your way for the evening whether you decide to stay or move on!", "business_id": "TIPebazlAGJsp8zAwhNkcw", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-11-17", "type": "review"}

I had been wanting to come here since I randomly caught it on an episode of \"Diners, Drive-ins and Dives\" and last night was the perfect night for us.  The outside of the building is unassuming and we drove right past it before noticing that we had.  The inside of the building is not much better as it looks like your normal neighborhood bar with a bunch of flat screens T.V's on the wall, a U shaped bar on one side, booths and high top tables on the other and a back dining room.  My girlfriend and I tried to sit in the back but there was something going on there and so we eventually settled into one of the booths.\n\nThe bar seemed quite full for a Tuesday evening and our waitress (the bartender) told us that she would get to us shortly after we had seated ourselves.  After only a short wait, she was at our table taking our drink order.  I was actually impressed with how efficient she was by herself with the large crowd.  For dinner I decided to order the famous fish sandwich and a plate of pierogies (3) while my girlfriend went with the buffalo chicken wrap.  Our food came out within a reasonable time period and looked good with both of our sandwiches served with cole slaw.  The pierogies were absolutely enormous, almost as long as my hand and fried slightly, topped with onions and came with a side of applesauce.  Our waitress had asked us if we had wanted sour cream with them to but we politely declined.  They tasted pretty good as the slight fry gave them a crunchy exterior while the interior was soft and tasty.  By the time we were done with them, we had also eaten all of the applesauce as it made a good dipping sauce and helped keep the pierogies moist.  My sandwich was also pretty good as the breading on it was fried nicely and tasted good while the fish was mild.  I topped it with hot sauce and like a true Pittsburgher even put my cole slaw on it which helped to make it taste better. My girlfriend told me that she enjoyed her buffalo chicken wrap and the single bite that I took gave me a nice buffalo flavor.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I am glad that I came here and might be back again depending on what I am looking for.  The food was dirt cheap with our whole bill coming to $22 and it exceeded the expectations that I had given to it whenever we walked in.  However, with that being said, the building is fairly run down and it is bar food and so I wouldn't expect it to be the greatest food you have ever tasted.", "business_id": "ufyh6h4GsR-RYY2lC_Iz7w", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-11-08", "type": "review"}

Alexander Michael's is tucked away from the Uptown skyscrapers in the residential section.  You probably wouldn't see it unless you knew it was there.  It looks like it could be just another house on the quiet street.  There are no big signs for it and not a lot of discernable noise from the outside.  \n\nOnce we got inside, though, we saw that it was quite packed.  We were lucky to get seated right away in the crowded room that resembled something of an English or Irish pub.  The lighting was low and the casually dressed crowd was \"older\" than a lot of Uptown bars, so we felt like we fit in with the 30- and 40-somethings. \n\nWe started with a Woodchuck Cider (not everyone carries ciders!) and it was sweet, bubbly, and refreshing.  We enjoyed that our server wasn't overly attentive, but she was there whenever we needed to order and checked up on us only when necessary.  I tried the blackened catfish and my partner had the honey chicken.  Both were delicious.  Mine (accompanied by spicy black beans) had just the right amount of cajun flavor.  And the portion sizes were just right -- not enough to overfill you, but not enough to leave you hungry when you left.  \n\nIt was definitely an enjoyable experience, and I look forward to returning to this new (to me).

When we arrived, at about 5:30, it was still very quiet but began filling up fast (including other tables obviously going to the Carbon Leaf/Big Head Todd and the Monsters concert.) As soon as we walked in a server approached and guided us to a booth. \n\nFood: We started with the Crab meat Supreme Quesadilla app ($7.60). My girlfriend had the 4th Ward Stroganoff ($13.75) and I had the Feta Chicken ($13.95) as entrees. For drinks, she had a Duvel and I had a Hefeweizen and Oktoberfest on tap. \n\nAs for the starter, I was not very impressed with the quesadilla. The menu advertises it has pepper jack cheese but I detected no pepper jack, just regular monterrey jack cheese. Also, I personally got two bites of crab meat (my girlfiend had several). Given the very mild flavors of crab and monterrey jack, this was a very bland quesadilla. Granted, it did come served with sides of sour cream and salsa and I thought the salsa was pretty good. I just would have preferred the actual quesadilla to stand on its own a bit. \n\nFor the stroganoff, my girlfriend really enjoyed it and would have clean-plated it if she wasn't a carb watcher. I did steal a piece of the beef and thought it was very tasty with the red wine definitely coming through. My Feta chicken was also good (how can you go wrong with Feta?) with extra props going to the sauteed veggies that make up bed along with the penne pasta. They consisted of broccoli, mushrooms, red and green peppers and red onions. I thought they were very well cooked and the white wine/garlic saute was very tasty. The chicken itself was good though a touch overcooked but not enough to ruin the plate. Be advised that, as advertised, it does come sitting in a \"broth\" so is a wet dish. \n\nOur meal, including two pre-concert tequila shots ;-) and an appropriate tip, came to about $90 -- not cheap but we did splurge on alcohol a bit. \n\nService: Our service was excellent with our waitress obviously very familiar the menu and restaurant. As a plus, as it got busier two owner/manager types stayed available in the dining area helping out and making sure everyone's visit was up to par. \n\nAtmosphere: This must be one of the big draws as AM is in an old converted house right in the middle of a residential neighborhood. All dark wood with a gorgeous bar, its easy to imagine coming here after work to just hangout for awhile. A couple of HD TV's are present, as well.  It is a fairly tight space, however, so I also imagine there must be times when it is standing room only. \n\nFood: 7/10; Service: 9/10; Value: 7/10; Atmosphere 10/10", "business_id": "ePP0Eqz8JKSbtdt2phiB4A", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-09-20", "type": "review"}

All I could taste was the black beans. I took a bite of the London Broil sandwhich and was not impressed.

She didn't stick around and she seemed to just have too much going on in general.  Whatever, no big deal.  \n\nThe food I think is consistently good.  The fried pickles are good, their cajun fries are crispy, good flavor, their other sides are OK, not amazing.  I tried their veggie and quinoa burger and I thought it was pretty good!  My friend had the burger and wasn't asked how she wanted it cooked so that was a BAD sign.  Not fresh.  Aaaand, it wasn't.  It was a little dry, not much flavor, just bleh in general.

It truly is a throwback to what I imagine old neighborhood bars were like where yes, everybody did know your name and you always left with a smile on your face. Others have said it here, but I am going to go ahead and reiterate that this spot is truly a gem and all the people inhabiting the 4th Ward of Charlotte are lucky to have it. \n\nWhat makes it so special? Well, as alluded to above, the quaint neighborhood feel of the restaurant itself goes a long way and its impact cannot really be done justice by words--you just have to go there! The staff is welcoming and friendly, and you most certainly are made to feel like a regular (even if you are not like this guy). The few times that I've been here, the tavern is always filled with jovial conversations, laughter, and a real community feeling. \n\nThe food is typical American pub food fare but done extremely well. I've never been disappointed with anything that I've ordered here, nor has anyone that I've come to Al Michael's with. In terms of starters, the spicy crab soup is excellent and the black bean hummus also hits the spot. For your main grub, the ruben, half pound burger, London broil, and quinoa black bean vegetable burger (did I mention they have a surprising number of healthier options?) are staples when we go. The side dish options also bring the goods with choices such as fries, Cajun fries, spicy black beans, or a big ol' baked potato (this option probably gives you the best bang for your buck!). \n\nRight now your taste buds are most likely waking up but you're concerned about what you're going to wash all that delicious food down with. Well, stop your fretting because this spot has a rotating line-up of high quality draft beers with a huge emphasis on North Carolina beers and an even greater emphasis on Charlotte specific brews. Problem solved! On top of that, there is also a full bar and a few selections in the wine department. \n\nOh, and when is the best time to check this spot out?

And flat screens are located throughout showing other games throughout the day.\n\nI've never had the food here, I've only been for the nightlife/game watching, so I can't comment on the menu or the food taste. There's a good selection of beer both on tap & in bottles. The prices are pretty on par with any bar/restaurant located on Tryon in Charlotte, so I can't really complain here. They also have a couple pool tables, and a lounge upstairs if you want to get out of the main bar scene.\n\nFox & Hound won't blow you away with anything, especially if you're there to watch a game. It always seems to be packed so there must be something that keeps bringing people back again & again. Check it out & you may actually like it better than me if you don't like the loud sports crowd but still want to watch the game.", "business_id": "-6JY1T0w4XETux5kGOj84g", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-09-15", "type": "review"}

I was planning to catch a movie at the Epicenter and wanted some grup nearby.  It was a toss-up between Hooters and Champions and since I'd never been to Champions I decided to give it a try......\n\nWhen I first entered the place I stood by the hostess booth for about 5 minutes and nobody came to greet me or show me to a table...... or anything.  Then, some more patrons arrived and were waiting in line behind me.  This is when a waitress who was taking orders at a nearby table told is we could sit wherever we wanted so I decided to sit downstairs since the upstairs was crowded with kids.  So I make my way downstairs and sit a a table for about 5 minutes and no one notices I'm there.......  So I make my way over to the other side of the room and sit at a booth literally 3 feet from the bar and no one notices me........  The guy that was waiting on the booths was busy watching a college football game with some patrons..... So I get up and sit at the bar where the bartender quickly got my drink and took my order.  I got the classic burger with bacon, lettuce and tomato along with a side of fries.\n\nThe food came out fairly quickly.  The burger was very good!!  And so were the fries.  I really have no regrets about the food or the bartender, but the place is kind of dark and relaly is a '90s relic, I mean, they have a mural of LJ with David Robinson and BJ Armstrong among others.......  I understand having LJ on there but Robinson?  BJ?  Shouldn't Kemba and Big Al be on there?\n\nOh well, I thought the bill was fair.  I think it was $10 and change for a very good burger and fries with a pepsi and refill.\n\nI might visit again if I'm in the area and want a good burger, but I'd also like to see what else is out here.\n\nHappy Yelping!!", "business_id": "vIXUw1cLG84-m8LzOg3f-w", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-10-11", "type": "review"}

The bright red signage makes it easy to spot (we parked at the 7th St garage and it was a short walk).  Surprisingly when we arrived at 5:45, there was already a 30 minute wait (Bobcats game, Panthers game tomorrow, a few other \"events\" in addition to the small venue concert that we were going to were going on).  But true to what the hostess said, exactly 30 minutes later our buzzer buzzed.  \n\nLovely restaurant, although very dark.  And when walking to the restroom, I though I was being led out into an alley, it's a hike.  Wide selection of menu items, it was hard to decide what to get.  Comfy seating. \n\nWe decided on the Jalapeno Spinach Cheese Dip which is served with tortillas to start with.  It was DELICIOUS.  Creamy and cheesy, the tortilla chips held up to dipping without breaking and they weren't overly salted.  The dip had a little bit of a kick to it without being overwhelming.  Very good start.\n\nI ordered the 2:00 am burger, which is a burger topped with a fried egg, cheese and bacon, with a hashbrown underneath and mac n' cheese as a side (mac n' cheese is an upgrade from the fries side, so you'll be charged a buck for this - it says it clearly on the menu, so no big...).  The burger was meh - not bad by any means, but lacking flavor.  I ended up asking for some ketchup to try and do something to it.  The bun held up well to all of the toppings though, so I didn't even up with a soggy mess on my plate that I would need to eat with a knife and fork, so points for that.  The mac n' cheese was very good.  Nothing fancy, but well done.  \n\nThe food was more of a 3.5, but our waitress was amazing, great service even with a packed house, so I will go with a 4.  If another Spirit Square event comes up, I would definitely eat here again.", "business_id": "ym9QwkmB5ZKTyj7q5huTDw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-11-11", "type": "review"}

Rock Bottom offered a great variety that he was pleased with and the brewery atmosphere is really cool.  The spirit and wine offerings were also pretty good with a solid variety of wines and the usual spirits (with some fun cocktail options).\n\nThe menu is huge and offers enough to please anyone.  Our server was extremely sweet, quick, and very knowledgeable of the menu.  She passed the test when she offered solid beer recommendations with food pairings.  The food was surprisingly good.  We tried the southwest eggrolls to start (holy carbs and cheese) and then split a salad with flat bread pizza.  Once we finished dinner we moved to the bar...which I made a note on to visit for game days.  Spectacular set up with plenty of seating.  \n\nThe gem of this place is actually the bartenders.  I'm sure that it's no surprise that if one sits at a bar, they are most likely going to chat with the bartenders.  These girls were hilarious and carried on great conversation with us without seeming imposing - which is the key to a great bartender.

She again left for another 10 minutes. When she returned I asked her what exactly happened that our drinks never made it to us? Was someone else supposed to bring it, did she forget?

The police informed us about the situation and wouldn't allow the rest of the group to leave until the other tabs were paid and closed out. \nAfter soaking with Andrea the \"manager\" who couldn't manage her host to close out the checks beforehand... First they said one of the table didn't pay for the food and after an hour of deliberating with the cops they figured the table that left already paid for their food but management is now stating the drinks have not been paid for. \n  I have never experienced such incompetence when it comes to dealing directly with your customers about closing out tabs for large parties. Andrea the manager could have approached one of us to resolve this matter before calling the cops... Seriously don't these officers have something else better to do instead of dealing with a problem or miscommunication like this? What kind of manager would do that specially of there is still a large group left behind even though some table have left already to head back to their hotels after a long day of convention... \nIn my opinion this is just plain poor management and my group were 95% Japanese from Japan. This was a very poor impression by getting the cops involved and not being able to handle this while my group was still in the restaurant and the cops informing my group that we would be all going to jail if a $120 tab was not paid. \nPointers for Andrea the \"manager\" communicate directly with your clients about open tabs left before calling the cops. Learn how to manage the floor to close out the bill since everyone at the table is no longer ordering. And last calling the cops to resolve issues you should handle yourself should be your last resort if the group left the restaurant already. \nSeriously, these were our VIP Japanese colleagues and we did not come to Charlotte North Carolina to get a free meal... There are no free meals in America Andrea! \nAnd if you fear about losing your job because you couldn't manage the floor to close out tabs...

Duckworth's Uptown was our first choice, but there was no hope of getting a table there with the college football crowd camping out, so we went across the street to Rock Bottom. I'd been there a couple times before, and figured our experience would be fine (if nothing to write home about).\n\nThe hostess told us we could seat ourselves in the bar area, so we did. I thought it was odd how many empty tables were in the bar area.\n\nThen we waited. And waited. And waited. We asked for a server twice. I would have left at this point but half of our group was really hungry and I knew it would be tough to get a table at other nearby spots. \n\nWe did finally get a server, but I could tell she would have rather been anywhere else that night, and maybe she did go somewhere else because we didn't see much of her during our visit. Getting water took a long time. Getting cocktails took a long time. Placing an order took a long time. Our food (chicken sandwich, burger, salad, hot wings) took about an hour to arrive, and based on the temperate of my sandwich I'd guess it was sitting in the window for at least a quarter of that time.

It is poured very quickly, all at once into a plastic cup, and if you do get it anyway don't expect to be spoiled with a cute little shamrock on top. \n\nOne interesting part of our time here was the huge, almost 5 ft tall fan in the back - watching several drunken patrons standing in front of it giving their best model impressions was hysterical!", "business_id": "6SxAOEXHzNjWQMQ9Nnos3A", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-09-02", "type": "review"}

I called and made reservations, they were very nice and completely accommodating over the phone.  We arrive on time for our reservations and we are greeted by the hostess who is the first to tell my girlfriend Happy Birthday, everyone inn the restaurant from the servers to the bus boys said hello to us and wished my girl a happy birthday.  When we arrived at the table it was covered in a very classy looking glitter and decorations specifically yfor the occasion.  They made us feel like movie stars, and she thought I was amazing because I had set all this up, but really it was all Capital Grille. So right away the service has set the scene for us to have an excellent night.\n\nThen came the food, we started with a round of gin and tonics, good, and a crab cake appetizer which was amazing, chunks of perfectly seasoned crab meat, and just enough to wet our appetites for the main course.  She ordered the fillet Mignon, and I got the porterhouse.  It was spectacular.  The meat is aged in a glassed in room, which you can see when you first walk in, and tastes incredibly rich, with many layers of flavor, from the smoked grilled aspect to the texture of the aged beef, ummm, I even took the bone home and gnawed on it the next day, it was that good.  The mashed potatoes were really good too.\n\nCapital grille is perfect for special occasions, a little pricey, but when you're celebrating, this is the place to go all out.", "business_id": "CChwRoYVXA3QZulS8a6xOQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2007-09-30", "type": "review"}

However more modern interpretations like Houston's/Hillstone or J.Alexander's score higher and feel better. \n\nThe service was knowledgeable, but rushed, and not attentive.Not bad in any way but not what I would expect from a place that seems so polished, pretentious and more importantly so expensive. Lets just say I have had much better service for half the price... ( recently Acme in Chapel Hill but I have yet to get to that review)\n\nFood ... OK $40 an entree  ala carte, $10 sides, those are NYC, LA, SF  prices. I expect it to be of comparable quality...... Sadly it was not.  \n\nThe menu list \"daily seafood feature\", when I asked it was, I was told filet(beef) medallions with scallops .... sorry Chef .... that may feature seafood, but it is not a \"seafood feature\" !  \n\nBetween the 2 of us we had - \n\nCedar Plank salmon, slightly over cooked, vastly under seasoned ( my better half rarely salts anything she did this)\n\nBone in NY ordered mid-rare, received very much on the rare side, slightly cold, flavor was good, but undercooked and served with a slightly roasted shallot that was still crunchy (not cooked enough), not the sweet, soft, unctuousness that it could have been.\n\nPotato gratin ( $10) needed an extra 15 min. in the oven, the potatoes were not cooked through... and there was a very very strong raw garlic flavor, AND there was plastic wrap inside ! .. In fairness I understand this happens occasionally and it and the dessert were comped, however I see a trend of sloppiness with the food that should not be happening at this price point.\n\nGrilled Asparagus ($10) it was ok ... but just ok. \n\nDessert creme brule, ......nothing special...  thin  not very crisp carmel, made worse by too many wet berries, and a strawberry fan garnish which even in the darkly lit dining room (as opposed to the kitchen) I could see was past its prime.\n\nit was a $50 dinner for more than $150, so I think that \n\n\"Meh.

My oh my is it amazing. From the bar, to the table and everything in between... absolutely top notch.\n\nDrinks: My knees go weak for an amazing filthy martini. They make it just the way I like it. Bonus: they bring the shaker out to the table and pour it in front of you. Double bonus: blue cheese stuffed olives. I also recommend their signature drink the Stoli Doli martini. Great cocktail.

Last night I went with French Onion Soup, split a house salad with my friend and the Sliced Filet Mignon with Cipollini Onions and Wild Mushrooms.

Wow, that's a must get side item there.\n\nDessert: I was already full at this point... like throw-a-white-flag-in-the-air kind of full.

Let me first state that I was  dining solo and was wearing a baseball hat, jeans and cowboy boots. When I entered, the hostess asked me if I preferred sitting in the bar area.  Given what I was wearing and since I was alone, that made perfect sense to me.  I sat at the bar and Richard was my waiter.  I had an absolutely different experience with Richard than was described in a recent post.  He...and the food...made my visit memorable.\n\nLet me first say that Richard had to have been one of the most professional, yet congenial, waiters/servers that I have encountered in a long time.  He had the perfect mixture of banter with me---while waiting for food--- while allowing me to have quality time with my food when it came.\n\nI do not like onions and indicated that to Richard. He then said that he was going to change some of the bread with my meal as it contained onions.  Nice touch!  A few minutes later someone from the kitchen came over and asked me if I was allergic to onions (which I am not).  I make it a habit to let servers know of my distaste for onions, when appropriate.  Never have I been asked before if I were allergic to onions.  I truly appreciate the C.G. staff for going out of their way to cater to me like they did.\n\nRichard also steered me well with food choices.  On my own, I NEVER would have thought of ordering mashed potatoes at a restaurant of the caliber of C.G.  Richard suggested that I have that as a side.  I agreed and am so glad I did.  The best word to describe them was \"sublime.\"  My main dish, salmon, was equally superb.  My only disappointment in the whole meal was that I had two beers which helped fill me up.  Alas, there was no room for dessert.\n\nAre C.G.'s price ridiculously high?  Absolutely!\n\nIs the food at C.G. ridiculously good? Absolutely!\n\nDid Richard help make my visit spectacular?

Mine was the Steak au Poivre with a creamy French sounding sauce. It was beautifully tender at medium rare and spiced just right. Everyone raved about their steaks. The kids had their Chicken tenders (?) which was not on the regular menu but the waitress arranged it. The ambience was classy but not stuffy. We were not loud but pretty chatty and never felt rushed or uncomfortable. The vibe was bustling but relaxed for the guests. Only one person had dessert, everyone else were too full.

For our main course my wife had the salmon and I had the night's special steak. My wife enjoyed her salmon but did have to add salt which I found a bit unusual since she rarely does that. My steak was cooked to perfection and our sides of Sam's mashed potatoes and asparagus were also prepared to our liking.\nI can find nothing but great things to say about the quality of food.\nThe only thing keeping me from giving me The Capital Grille five stars is the service. It struck us as being rude when we were at the reception station and the host told one of the wait staff to \"go sit these two\". Not really what I was expecting from a place such as this. Our waiter was \"Ok\". Nothing special. He was semi-attentive but as we were having our first sips of our after dinner drinks he brought us the check. Really? Do you want us to leave or do you want us to sit and spend some more money.? It was Halloween and its not like the place was slammed full. \nCall me picky but if I am dropping $250 for dinner then I would expect that the service equal my expectations.\nI do want to give The Capital Grille a big Thank You for going the extra step of setting up our table for our anniversary.

We went to this Stool Pigeons on Church to watch Sunday football and were told that Mich Ultra and Bud Light were on special for $2.25. We're not picky beer drinkers, we would have enjoyed the Bud Lights just as much as the Ultras, we just wanted the cheapest beer because we were drinking a lot. So we start to order buckets after buckets of beer. It started out with 3 Bud Lights and 2 Mich Ultras and then the last bucket somehow ended up being all Mich Ultras. Well of course, when we get the bill, we find out why the waitress was bringing us so many Mich Ultras in comparison to Bud Lights. Mich Ultras were $3.75 a PIECE (not on special like she told us), which is absolutely insanely overpriced for a domestic beer anyway and the Bud Lights were $2.25. She was trying to get the bill higher for a bigger tip by lying and telling us that something was on special and it wasn't. I'm a waitress, I know how this stuff works (although I'm at least an honest up-seller, not a deceitful one.) The bill was over $100 for 25 beers, Nachos (which were not actually nachos, they were cheap veggies thrown on top of about 7 tortilla chips with tater tots underneath. Yes, tater tots. What is that?!), and wings. \n\nShe tried to argue with us about the prices and what she did or did not say, something about the special not counting towards the buckets? Who knows what the hell she was talking about, the girl obviously needed to get her info straight. So we of course ask for the manager who comes over to tell us that we drank them and we had to pay the $3.75 a pop. We were pissed needless to say. The manager actually ROLLED HIS EYES-SEVERAL times and was YELLING at us. I was stunned. He actually yelled at us. Funny thing is, I'm a business major, currently in school and we are learning (even though, common sense) that customer satisfaction is key. Had the manager given us the lower price, they wouldn't have even lost anything because we all know that a Mich Ultra in the store is barely more than $1, so they are still profiting from us. We would have been HAPPY customers, willing to come back since this is a regular Sunday occurrence. But now, we're so ridiculously angry, it was the worse experience at a restaurant EVER. The waitress and the manager were rude and stupid. I guess you can't expect much from sports bars like that anyway. Uneducated morons run the place. \n\nI hope the owner of this restaurant is reading this. Maybe you'll learn something. If a SERVER makes a mistake, you don't make the customer pay for it. Even if the mistake is the customer's, you still don't make them pay for it. It's called good customer service. It's what will keep people coming back. Ever heard \"The customer is always right\" ???? (Even though we were, something like that would have never happened where I work) Now, we will not EVER be back here, nor will we bring any of our 10-15 people Sunday crowd, and we will tell everyone how awful of an experience we had here which will cost you money.

They walked me through the entire rum selection and even made a few recommendations relevant to certain cigars for the best possible experience.

Beware though, if you have never been, you will be floored at how dark it is! I have a friend who told me the story of when he first moved to Charlotte and stumbled into what he thought was pronounced \"Cannolli's\". He walked in, ran into a table, couldn't see anything and ran back out because he had no idea what he had just walked into. Ha! \n\nBut your eyes will adjust and you will be fine after you grab a Guinnes or a cider. Most of the people that work there are actually from Ireland or another country such as Australia. The experience in a pub is just that much more enjoyable when accents are involved (especially with hot guys). \n\nWhile you're there, take in the music, which is sometimes Irish, sometimes hip hop, and the decor of the room. On the walls you will find all authentic effects from Ireland, such as street signs and sports memorabilia. If you are there on a busier night (which sometimes can be every night) head upstairs if you can. The upstairs is usually open Thursdays through Saturdays, I think. It's much roomier up there and you can always find a few young people dancing up there (again with very little light). \n\nThe crowd normally seems to be mostly young professionals including a lot of after work stop-ins like bankers and lawyers. Sometimes there are a few tourists and foreigners with accents as well (preferably hot).   ;) \n\nTo make the most out of going to Connolly's take it for what it is... you will get drinks very quickly and proably drink A LOT. You can easily meet new friends and sing and dance a little. They don't serve food and even though, it is clean, there's not much else to it. \n\nA HUGE tip for the ladies: if you use the restroom downstairs make sure you lock the door with the large latch lock that slides UP! If you lock the bathroom door with just the measly doorknob lock, SOMEONE WILL WALK IN ON YOU!! I have done this three times in one night to three poor, unsuspecting women who did not know this. Whoops! Sorry 'bout that...\n\nAlso, I almost forgot, they just expanded their patio and it's awesome!! They now have 2 cornhole setups, a ping pong table and outdoor flatscreen TV's, not to mention more patio tables and more standing room. Venture out there; it's a new world! \n\nAaaand lastly, if you do stop by, do me a favor and find the Irsh bartender \"Murph\" and give him a hard time... seriously do it. It will get him all fired up and a good laugh for you and me! ;) He is my favorite bartender in Charlotte but he's still a pain in the arse.", "business_id": "jmzPbvE_02SzTAjwZCTgYA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-10-26", "type": "review"}

I've been to the Culture Club several times in NYC and have always had a blast there, and expected the same from the Breakfast Club. Pretty much the same format here in Charlotte, with great music cranking and drunken bachelorette's running about, just on a smaller scale and without Boy George checking ID's. I don't know if it was the giant PacMan on the wall made out of red bull cans or the Ferris Bueller Tshirts for sale, but within minutes my hair was in a side pony and I was at the bar ordering a Freak-a-Zoid. \n\nThe music here was good, and I particularly liked how the movie \"The Breakfast Club\" (one of my favorites) was actually playing on the projector pointed at the wall. Nice touch! I will say that if you go here, do not make the mistake I made in ordering a mixed drink - they are miniscule! I actually thought that the bartender mis-heard me and poured me a shot instead (see pic). \n\nThe highlight of the night had to be the guy in the short gym shorts and tank top who hopped up onto the bench during the guitar solo of Sweet Child o' Mine and played the blow-up guitar with all his heart & soul - it was awesome! I wish I could upload the video I took but the pic will have to do for now. The lowlight would have to be the grossness that was the girl dancing around a dirty club with no shoes on - nasty! We all saw it and commented on how unsanitary it was, and toward the end of the night we noticed her whole crew being escorted out, and what at the time looked like juice was spilled all over the floor - turns out she must have stepped on or gotten cut by the broken bottles that had shattered - it was blood, and it was in pools EVERYWHERE. I really hope this girl was okay, because there was so much of it that none of us could believe that it was really blood. We were walking out just as the Medic and the firetrucks were getting there. WHO WALKS AROUND A DIRTY CLUB BAREFOOT??? For what it's worth, the clean up crew came out right away and mopped it up.

No fear, it's all 80s so if you look foolish you're probably doing it right. They also have several projectors playing different 80s themed music videos, movies & clips.

Whether for birthdays, work meetings, or just a desire for a nice night out Blue never disappointed, and they often outperformed even themselves on many occasions.\n\nThe staff here is without a doubt one of the best trained in the city, from the waiters to the hostess to the managers and owners, everyone treats you with a high level of respect, and makes you feel like you are the most important person in the restaurant when you're there. After a few visits I found one waiter I liked even more than the others, and I would always request his table when I came, with no problem from the scheduler. Don't forget, if you bring your own wine (which I do quite frequently) make sure to pour some for your waiter! Not that you NEED to bring wine to Blue, because they have a wine list that is second to none (well, maybe Bonterra) in Charlotte.\n\nIt's hard to recommend specific dishes at Blue, because I've had so many fantastic ones and they change very frequently with the seasons. It's a Mediterranean style of cuisine, so expect heavily herbed flavors on whatever you get, and an emphasis on great sauces. Perhaps my favorite meal here was a whole shank of Osso Bucco, served over fava beans and mashed sweet potatoes, with a crab and lobster risotto on the side. Pure decadence. If you see this dish on the menu it is the one thing I would suggest getting over anything else, as the meat is so fall-off-the-bone delicious it is nearly impossible to surpass. The duo of bison cuts is another one I would highly recommend.\n\nThe cheese selection at Blue is also top-notch. There are usually 15-20 to choose from, including several expensive bleu cheeses, which are fortunately all the same price here. It comes with honeycomb and pecans on the side, and unlike many other restaurants doesn't cost extra. Another one of my favorite elements about this restaurant is the very first thing you get when you sit down, hearty bread and the most wonderful spread I've ever tasted. It's a kalamata olive based butter that looks a bit funky at first, but once you eat your first piece the bowl gets quickly emptied.\n\nBe sure to save plenty of room for desert as well (Blue's dinner portions can be quite dramatically large) because they whip up some of the fanciest creations you can find in the Charlotte area. And for those of you that don't go for overly sweet temptations there is also a huge fresh berry desert with homemade ice cream, one of my favorites!", "business_id": "eaqJQP6bp7rQJQt5KqfvxQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-09-26", "type": "review"}

He was impressed with the restaurant's selection and we were with his. I also had a microbrew amber ale on draft that was wonderful.\nService: Was not over or underdone. Had the flair and attention of a nice establishment without being too snobby/formal. One bottle of wine we particularly liked ran out so the manager came over to talk about similar choices. Nice touch.\nAppetizers: Choosing cheese and then pairing them with membrio, walnuts and bread was lovely. The house bread with butter mixed with kalamata olives was a wonderful touch.  The calamari rivaled your favorite sports bar (I expected better). The Flavors of the Mediterranean plate was good but not extraordinary. It was a nice option from standard fare for certain though.\nMain meal: For the price we each agreed we didn't get anything special. Certainly the seasonal Jumbo Scallops on Risotto was good, but it wasn't lovely. Almost too salty and there was nothing tying the seafood with the grain. And I adore both items. The Bolognese was described as 'eh' and 'standard' and the two who got the pork roasts were equally so-so in review and description.\nAtmosphere: A jazz trio started up as we ate and it added a light and fun atmosphere to the experience. Tables around us were in good spirits, the lighting was set just right and there was enough space to move between tables (very uncommon in SF). It was nice.\n\nConclusion: This was a good experience but not great. I don't want to think because this is a smaller town then I'm used to, \"nice\" local places  = lower standards. I tend more to think there were good ideas here not executed to their fullest. 3 stars is all about the food which is ultimately why we pay these prices and go to these places.

We figured this would give us an opportunity to sample Blue from a limited menu at a cheaper price and then we could return if we really liked it.  \n\nUpon arrival, we were escorted past the empty dining room to a small room in the back of the restaurant, next to the restrooms, that had no windows and certainly not the ambiance of the rest of the restaurant.  We soon realized that this small room in the back was where they put the theatergoers who booked the package, because we overheard others there talking about going to the show as well.  At the time, we didn't say anything to the hostess about the terrible seating because we assumed we were seated here because we were getting a special limited menu for the dinner package and weren't paying \"full price.\"  \n\nOur server, Jason, came to greet us (I only know his name because it's on the receipt; he never introduced himself to us) and we inquired about how to use the tickets since this was our first time booking a dinner package through Blumenthal.  He told us they were each worth $40 (what we paid for them) and we could use that $40 however we wanted to, based on the pricing on the menu.  He left and when he returned, I asked again about the tickets because I was under the impression they included soup or salad, entr\u00e9e, dessert, and a non-alcoholic beverage.  He reiterated his spiel about the tickets just being cash value.  After he left the table, my partner and I looked at each other confused.  We questioned why we bothered to reserve and purchase these tickets in the first place if we could have booked our own dinner reservation at Blue and paid for our bill without the tickets.  By doing so, we would have been seated in the main dining room and not have been treated like steerage shoved to the bottom of the ship!\n\nJason returned and started to deliver his spiel about the menu in a monotone, looking around the room the whole time instead of maintaining eye contact, as if he couldn't be bothered with us.  (We overheard him deliver this same spiel in monotone to the other tables as well.  There was nothing personalized about it.)  One phrase in his spiel particularly bothered me.  He said that we \"should try something that we wouldn't normally prepare at home.\"  What was that supposed to mean?  Was Jason suggesting that because we booked this dinner package (which was no deal at all, as it turned out) and were sitting in the back room by the bathrooms that we ate nothing but fish sticks and tater tots at home?   Who was serving whom?\n\nMy partner started with the poached pear & argula salad; I had the butternut squash soup.  Both were good, but nothing extraordinary for the size and price.  Then we split the falafel appetizer, which was delicious, thick, and flavorful.  To our surprise, we were then (after finishing the other starters?) brought bread with an olive butter.  \n\nFor entrees, I ordered the grouper with pumpkin and duck risotto.  The grouper was average (not much flavor or spices added to it), but the pumpkin risotto was delicious.  It was creamy with a lot of flavor, complemented by the crunchy pumpkin seed topping.  I could have done without the shredded duck mixed in it (duck is usually too greasy for me), but I still ate and enjoyed it.  The \"micro arugula salad\" that was supposed to come with the entree must have been so micro that it wasn't visible to the naked eye.  My partner \"tried something that we wouldn't normally prepare at home.\"  He went with the wild boar.  It was good; kind of like roast beef.   The black currant marmalade on top added a little sweetness.  \n\nWhile the food we had at Blue was delicious, the experience, seating, and pretentiousness of our server was not worth the money and aggravation.  Worse, it turned out that we were were deceived with our \"dinner package\" and paying just as much money as anyone else in that restaurant, only without the service that I expect from a quality restaurant.  We ended up paying above and beyond our \"dinner package\" pricing for less than was quoted to be \"included.\"  Plus, we got to stare at a blue wall with crooked framed pictures in a small room instead of out in the open dining room where the room was dimly lit to create a mood and you could see out the restaurant windows.  \n\nMy rating of 3 stars for the experience and value is generous, but it's only for the quality of some of the food items we tried.  The entrees were 5 stars, the appetizers 3-4, the seating 2, the service and dinner package both get a 1.", "business_id": "eaqJQP6bp7rQJQt5KqfvxQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-11-13", "type": "review"}

The main room had a LOT more atmosphere to it, and we were thankful to be a part of it this time.  \n\nOur server was fantastic.  He was very friendly and the opposite of snobby (unlike our server during last year's visit).  We ordered martinis and he shook them in individual shakers right at our table before pouring them.  They were very delicious.  Nightly, they have a martini special, so be sure to ask what it is!   Because they were so affordable, we ordered two each!\n\nFor appetizers, we ordered the (1) calamari and (2) scallops.  Our server informed us that there were two scallops in the appetizer and asked if we wanted three so each person in our party could have one.  We readily agreed and the small upcharge was worth it.  The jumbo scallops had SO much flavor to them and were cooked to perfection.  The calamari was tasty, too!   The kitchen put both appetizers on one large serving platter, so it wouldn't take up a lot of space on our table.  Very smart!  \n\nFor entrees, I opted for the sea bass.  Our server \"warned\" me that the sea bass is brought out whole.  I was hesitant at first because I didn't want to have to pick through the skin and have the head hanging off one side of my plate and the tail off the other.  He then advised me that he brings it whole and then filets it at the table for me, taking away the skin, head, and tail.  So I agreed, figuing it would be entertaining as well, which it was.  He earns bonus points for all that work.  He nicely fileted the fish, leaving only the head attached to the spine and bones.   Yes, there were a couple of small bones in my sea bass, but all in all, he did a fantastic job.  And it was very tasty.  \n\nWe left Blue with a much more favorable impression, so we were glad we returned.

It did take a while sometimes for him to get back around to us, but we weren't in a hurry.\n\nWe had the scallop appetizer - it was very very good - one large scallop for each of us, which would have been pricey at $11 but we had a free appetizer coupon given to us by our downtown hotel.  I also had the cheese plate and chose 2 selections - too much for just one person, as I needed to save room for the main course, although both cheeses were excellent!\n\nWe both had the 'duo of wild boar' - really great!  The tenderloin portion could have been beef - the flavor was wonderful, and the black currant sauce was perfect with it.  The shoulder portion was more like pulled pork and was also quite good.\n\nAlthough I was STUFFED, my husband still wanted dessert and our waiter recommended a chocolate mousse with a peanut butter sauce - it tasted fantastic, like the best Reece's cup ever, and was light enough that I was able to eat quite a bit of it myself, too.  :-)\n\nAn excellent experience and if we lived in Charlotte, this would definitely be on our list of special occasion restaurants!", "business_id": "eaqJQP6bp7rQJQt5KqfvxQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-09-12", "type": "review"}

It is divided into appetizers, mid courses, salads, cheese courses, entrees, and specials.  \n\nWe began with the Tega Hills bibb lettuce salad with warm duck confit, as well as the Moroccan Kefta meatballs.  The salad was scrumptious.  It was really working that whole sweet and salty thing.  Meatballs were not my pick, but WOW they were good.  Served with a charmoula sauce which is heavy on the garlic, parsley and cumin, in a very good way.\n\nPer our waitress' recommendation (who was GREAT by the way), I had the pan seared Australian sea bass.  It was served on top of a diced butternut squash with ginger brown butter.  It was light  yet decadent at the same time.  \n\nOur waitress gave great recommendations and was totally enthusiastic about the menu.  I love it when people get as excited about food as me.

I love coming here mainly because of the live music, the mellow scene/ambiance, and the drinks. \n\nEach time I have been the jazz bands that have performed have been awesome! On my first visit, there was a Spanish jazz band which was a first for my ears and my ears greatly appreciated the sound. Every time I have gone there has been a different band and that is a plus for me so I can be exposed to varying sounds and types of music.\n\nThe mellow and laid back nature of Blue is very calming and soothing after a wild night downtown and gets me in a calming and peaceful mood before ending the night. I love how the restaurant is very intimate and that the lights are dim throughout the bar. \n\nNow, I can't sit in the bar area and not have a drink or two or three haha! They have drink specials that definitely should be taken advantage of and even if your favorite drink isn't on special, you should still try them out. The bartenders are great and every drink I've had has been tasty and made perfectly! \n\nRegarding their food, I have only had their pizza and French fries, so can't really speak on that aspect of the restaurant.

Maybe a warning sign. Valet parking was easy, as there was a basketball game, so Charlotte was busy.  The jazz ensemble was playing when we walked in.  Pretty cool - so far.  It took me a while, but I realized after a while that the inside of this place reminds me of a restaurant you would find inside of a Radisson in a medium sized city.  A restaurant that serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner - and mostly from a buffet (not that there's a buffet, here) - I'm speaking about the (lack of) atmosphere.  It was also very loud.  I couldn't really hear the jazz band, just a large amount of noise.  \n\nOh, yeah, the food.  I ordered the Antipasti, and my wife ordered the Pumpkin She Crab Soup.  Those were both pretty good.  My wife ordered a glass of wine, and the pour was pretty minimal.  Look - we get it, we're not going to make the restaurants night on liquor.  I didn't order alcohol, and my wife only ordered a glass - but it was below the 1/4 full mark.  Pretty lame.  \n\nFor the main course, I had the lamb, which is a specialty, and my wife ordered the chicken stuffed with mushrooms and mascarpone.  We would never normally order chicken at a restaurant, but glad we did.  It saved the meal.  It was really good.  The lamb, however, was a stew, with veggies and such in a large pot.  It is as advertised.  It lacked a lot in the flavor department.  \n\nOne word of warning.  If you get the sea bass, it is filleted table side.  The couple (right) next to us ordered it, and it smelled, and looked kind of gross.  It kind of set me off for the rest of the meal.  \n\nDesserts were good.  I ordered the brownie topped with raspberry semifreddo, and she ordered the salted carmel pudding.  Both were OK - but not awesome.  We also had to wait for coffee.  \n\nThe service was ok, but not great.  Our waters weren't refilled but once.  \n\nI waffle between 2 stars and 3.

I had the duck and scallops and it was cooked perfectly. We had several appetizers but my favorite was Flavors of Mediterranean. To top it off, we went there on Friday and they had LIVE opera and great cocktails. \n\nThis was my first time planning a bachlorette all the ladies were 29 and up and they were so impressed on how classy it was.  You made me look good and the Bride was so happy. She couldn't stop laughing because you made her feel so special. Then, you out did yourself and had the manager come to our table to congratulate our bride. \n\nThank you TONY for letting me know about this place. I will be back and I will tell everyone that this is THE restaurant to go. \n\n-Elsie Mufuka", "business_id": "eaqJQP6bp7rQJQt5KqfvxQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-09-06", "type": "review"}

I would have chosen it for the food and service!   We were visiting with family and wanted a place for a special dinner! \n\nWe were seated promptly on a Saturday night for a 7:30pm reservation.  We ordered two bottles of a wine ( 6 in the party).  Unfortunately the only had one( we had enjoyed it there the night before for cocktails).   The Sommelier came right over to tell us they only had one bottle left.  He made a recommendation of a more pricy bottle that they would honor at the price of the bottle we originally ordered ( $20 difference)!  -Great Customer Service!   It was a good choice! \n\nFor dinner we all started with the Poached pear and arugula salad -a wonderful blend of flavors.  For a main corse 4 of us had the grouper special - very fresh!  My hubby had the grilled red snapper-a whole grilled fish -yes head and tail included!  It was outstanding.  We order whole fish often when it is available.  It's the best way to preserve the moisture and flavor of the fish and this fish was no exception.  The non fish lover in the group had the Pork Chop and raved about it.   \n\nWe shared the Pistachio cake with chocolate mousse. The mouse was like a wedge and very rich.   We also had several scoops of their homemade pistachio ice cream.    \n\nThe jazz band started promptly at 9 was was great background music to our lingering conversation.

All have been A-Ok in reference to sound. \n\nMy only gripe would be the parking situation. It's always a little iffy with all of the restaurants and hospital that close.

I have been here several times and I will continue to go for the ambience, great cocktails, and fantastic food!!!\nThe fried green tomatoes are prob the best I have ever had.  The 7th street stumbler is an awesome cocktail!! Not to sweet, but still slightly fruity. I could have easily drank a few of these but I stuck to one. Ordered the Catfish, if you like spicy you would enjoy this...it's awesome.\n\nThe reason I give this place a 4 and not a 5 is because of the service we experienced last time we were there. Our waiter was AWFUL, extremely rude -- prob the worst service I have got in a restaurant in years.  He rarely came by to ask if we needed anything, didnt clear our appetizer plates and we were sitting at a small two top. When we were finished, we waiting around for 25 minutes for him to show up. When he did finally show up he threw our check back at us without saying a word.\nThe ONLY reason I left a tip was bc I use to be a server and even tho he was horrendous, I still can't bring myself to leave a person no tip.\n\nAnyways, the bad service I experienced the one time I went here will not keep me from going here.

From what I have been able to find, this is the only place in Charlotte that even has live Jazz, so I booked a reservation (through OpenTable) for my girlfriend and I on a Saturday night.\n\nNo problems with the reservation or getting us seated as soon as we got there, but I was immediately disappointed to find out that the music was only upstairs and there would be a \"20-30 minute wait\" for seating upstairs. We were seated downstairs, right next to the entrance--it's not great seeing everyone come and go, as well as the staff milling about the hostess stand.\n\nOur dinner started with no live Jazz (from downstairs it sounded like pots/pans being banged together) and less than ideal seating. Then came the food. It wasn't awful, but it wasn't anything special. Certainly not good enough to warrant all of the rave reviews here or the prices they charge. It was seasoned, but still tasted very bland to me, especially the crawfish, which I thought was overcooked. The seasoning certainly did not taste Cajun to me. (I got the crawfish Creole and my girlfriend had the chicken Etouffee.)\n\nI was definitely not pleased with my first--and last--experience at Cajun Queen, and left $60 poorer and hungry for better food, although I was full. Given that \"Live Jazz 7 nights a week\" is prominently touted on their website header, they really need to specify that it is only upstairs. I would have requested upstairs seating when I made the reservation, if I had known that was the only place to hear the music.

I had not had beignets since I was in Nola in April and I was craving them.  When we arrived at 10 to 11 (brunch begins at 11), there was already a line of people waiting outside.  The doors opened and people walked in like they had not ate in years, we knew we were in for a treat.  The restaurant is within what appears to be a house.  The dining rooms are where a living room and a den would typically be.  We were seated by the fireplace, which was running since it was 45 degrees outside.  The decor is very quaint and welcoming, almost like you're visiting a relative's house.\n\nThe dinner menu is also available all day but you truly go to this place for brunch.  I originally asked for a coffee with amaretto but they don't serve alcohol before noon (I'm spoiled from NY brunches) but their regular coffee was just as good.  We started off with an order of beignets.  6 perfectly sized fried balls of dough were presented with the most delicious strawberry compote in the middle for dipping.  The beignets were perfect and light and that compote made my day.  \n\nFor our entrees, we each got something different and decided to pick and choose from the other plates.  I got the bacon, egg, and cheese omelet.  This omelet was thick with a whole layer of bacon going through the center.  It also came with a side of cheesy grits, which were also delicious, and fresh fruit.  My friend got the bananas foster French toast.  The bananas were sweet but good and the toast itself was fluffy and delicious.  My other friend got the rice and beans, which yes becomes an entire meal since sausage is also included.  These were some of the best rice and beans the three of us have ever tasted.  And this is coming from a Puerto Rican, who also confirmed their tastiness.\n\nOverall, this is a fantastic place for brunch.

Broccoli and flavorless over boiled mash potato's! One of the few times I left the starch on the plate.\n\nThe meal wasn't bad but acceptable at best!", "business_id": "jTGQUWGIVvL-aY03C5BEmw", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-10-26", "type": "review"}

The men actually left seafood and meat in the portions they left on the table because the tastes were so bland.\n\nWatery gumbo started off our meals.

Depending on your sobriety level when you leave, it may be because you have a little trouble remembering your time there.\n\nWhen you enter past the surly ticket takers and go through the doors you're greeted by the booming music of top 40s remixes, though I do like the fact that they don't play it so loud that you can't hear someone screaming in your ear. The drinks here are kinda eh, you don't get much for your money and they are fairly weak in my opinion. Though I hear that on Sunday well drinks are free with a $10 cover, and Fridays offers free beer on tap so that's something to keep in mind.\n\nThe main reason to go here is for the dancing! They have a huge dance floor and it is quite a sight to see everyone dancing their tushes off! I was particularly amused by the twink who was twerkin it like it ain't no thang! I always have a fun time here, even when I'm the DD. The patio outside is filled with people smoking and chatting each other up. Good if you'd like to have a conversation with someone you've met, not so good if you are adverse to cigarette smoke though.\n\nScorpio's is a fun time, and they have lots of cool drag shows that are pretty awesome to watch.

Apparently this Sharon Needles show means she is going to do two songs in an hour and a half, almost two hour time slot, with the rest of the time being given to costume contests, and house drag queens. I understand the need for Sharon to have breaks between sets, but it became ridiculous. I have seen her perform before, AT Scorpios, and she performed at least 5 songs. Two songs? Seriously? Had I known it was going to be this way, I would not have driven two hours and spent $50 for VIP to get in. \n\nAs far as the VIP goes -  I was essentially promised the world, was given nothing. This ticket included drinks, food, a meet & greet - none of this was available. I never saw drinks being offered, I did see a few plastic looking cupcakes sitting stalely on a counter somewhere, obviously untouched for a reason - they looked old and dirty. I was at the front of the line for the meet and greet, got screwed over by the Scorpio's management, who told us that we were not, essentially, front ENOUGH, despite the fact that we had been waiting even before the show had ended, and was moved to the very BACK of the line - where I still waited for almost 2 and a half hours very patiently and very calmly for my opportunity to meet Sharon - tons and tons of people cut the line, but we still remained cool and just tried to play fair. The management then came by to tell us that Sharon would be leaving soon, and that we would only get a signature or quick photo with her, and that we would have to hurry - fine by me, as long as we got what we came for. Five people before my turn to meet Sharon, she left the line, and the literal handful of us left got NADA. After we came downstairs to speak to management to see what was going on, it became a circus - performers, bartenders, security, management, a whole random assortment of people who work at this club coming out to tell us different sides of the story, anywhere from the fact that us not meeting Sharon was our fault, to how Sharon was a \"f**king b*tch\" and how she should have stayed to meet all of us, to how they oversold the event and there were too many VIPs in the first place.  Naturally, we all just started to ask for our money back - and at the mention of refunds and any sort of words being exchanged, who I believe may be a manager of the club, or at least who presented himself as the spokesperson as such, called me and a large group of others \"faggots\". I cannot in any way justify how in the world, and especially at a gay bar, such a slur is okay to be used. As soon as he yelled that word at us, the entire crowd started to become hostile, and he immediately called the police and security, at which point I left, and will be contacting someone at a later date to further inquire about my refund, which I do believe I am justified. \n\nSo many things about this situation were wrong, yet a child could have done a better job planning this event than these grown people did - most importantly, overall organization and basic planning skills. Provide what you promise. Also, you cannot just place an entertainer in a room full of fans with no overseer and expect time to not run out - and, if you do have a specific amount of time in which the entertainer is available during, then you need to tell everyone that the entertainer will be leaving at that time, instead of letting it come to a surprise to all remaining when they have to watch the performer they paid money to come see literally run out of the room with their entourage. Someone should have been there to keep things efficient and running in a quick and orderly manner, instead of letting some fans spend 5-10 minutes with Sharon a piece. As much as we all wanted to do that, the rest of us were screwed, and got nothing, and that isn't fair. \n\nSecondly, the very fact that the management at this club immediately called the police on us AND called us faggots .... I cannot even with that. My time and my money was wasted, by being called a faggot in a place that is supposed to be LGBT friendly - hell, its a GAY CLUB - get real. \n\nThe literal only good thing about this place is that the parking is free, so I will give them that, if I had to find one positive thing to say. I would drive many, many miles and many, many hours out of my way to see performers elsewhere before I ever gave this place another dime or a minute of my time. PS - I still love you, Sharon Needles.

First off, the menu.  Their menu is very vegetarian friendly.  Hummus, spin-art dip, soft pretzels, tater tots, pizza, cheese plates, 2 veggie sammies, some salads and a Spicy Beer Cheese Soup that I wish I had tried.  So I definitely give credit to a place that tries to be veg-friendly.\n\nI ordered the Hippie Burger (veggie patty).  It was OK.  But the thing was that it came with a side, and I asked the server if the potato salad had bacon in it.  She said no.  But the first bite had bacon in it.  So, I'll just say that I was very dissatisfied with that.\n\nWhatever, I kept trucking.  And anyways, the real reason to go to this place is the beer.  I'm sure other reviewers have gone into great detail about their gigantic beer selection, so I'll keep it short.  While the idea is great, it falls a little short.  While the size of the menu is supposed to be its selling point, its just too big!!!  And it has a lot of filler.  I noticed one reviewer who said that this is the biggest beer selection in NC.  Well, maybe, but biggest is not necessarily best (innuendo unavoidable :)  It's hard to take a lot of pride in a beer bar that has a bunch of macros and second rate micros, but (if my eyes don't deceive me) not a single saison?  And barely any lambics to speak of.  Whatever, they still have some pretty good stuff, I'm just being picky, but it seems like with a little quality control their selection could go from good to great.\n\nThis one was a little tough to rate.  Part of me wants to give it a 2 (bacon), part a 3 (atmosphere), part a 4 (beer and food menu), and part a 5 (the idea).  So take that 3 I gave it according to what you want out of this place.\n\nOh yeah, this place can be REALLY loud inside.

There was a wheat beer on special so I immediately ordered that without even looking at who brewed it. It was delish so I drank that the rest of the night. My husband ordered various beers throughout the night. They have so many beers on tap!

We ordered the soft pretzals with beer cheese. We have ordered this many times in the past and new it was a winner. Dang those pretzals are awful for you but so good.

I will be filing complaints to the BBB, health department, and whom ever will listen (or watch the videos). I have a Video of all of the following. Your bartender completely ignoring our party of two, as we are speaking directly too her, and her making us repeat ourselves 3 times and still didn't answer our question. I confronted her about her lack of attention and being disrespectful. She stated it was busy and that other people needed her attention too we weren't the only people there. There were 6 people total sitting at the bar including our party. Even then she continued to have her conversation with the manager about (Facebook, instagram ect.) One of the employees at the establishment knew my friend who I had come to pick up from there. She (the employee) left without paying her tab. The bar tender proceeded to tell us that someone needed to pay it and it wasn't going to be coming out of her money. I explained to the bartender that if she made an arrangement for her co worker to come back and pay that is not our responsibility. After about ten min of conversation and the bartender speaking to us like we were animals I asked to speak to the manager. The bartender refused to close out my friends tab until either her co worker came back or we paid for her drinks. The manager never came, the bartender continued to be excessively rude. Slamming things around ect. Finally after being stuck in your establishment against our will for 45 min with the manager no where in sight.. the employee who left her tab open arrived. On the way back from using the filthy restroom, with a hole in the wall where there used to be a urinal and the sink that looked like a crew of diesel mechanics came through, I saw the manager on my way back to the front of the restaurant. I stopped and asked her if she was the manager. She was in the process of asking the cook to make her food stating. \"You know I'm a good person ill pay you back.\" Also at this point the employee who had left is now standing there and so is the bartender. I asked to speak with her and ask her if this was normal practice for your bartender to say to a guest who has never been to the establishment before (or even someone that knew the employee) has to pay for an employees drink who walked out on there tab. After I said that I had never visited the establishment before the bartender who is standing to the side says \"YES YOU HAVE\" and I again told her that I had not at which point she has thrown her arms in the air and storms away. At that same time the cook who the manager was just bribing sticks his head out of a service window and says (he also sounded intoxicated) \"I've heard him being very disrespectful the entire time\". Now don't get me wrong I was not very pleased that we were forced to stay there while the bartender withheld my friends credit card, but i was not disrespectful. At that point I had informed the manager that I had been recording this circus act unfolding in front of me. Her response was \"awesome\". As she sputtered making no sense something about the bartender and it being her friend, she proceeded to tell me \"I didn't have time for this or you right now, I appreciate that so go back and watch your video\". And walked away. I've tried to explain in the best of my ability what had transpired that night but the videos are unbelievable. I will never again visit a Baileys, I frequent Fox and Hound regularly with work functions and your bartenders there are less than favorable but bearable. I would appreciate a rapid response to this issue, preferably a phone call, and I never want anyone to have to deal with such barbaric people as my friend and I have.

Although the parking lot was full (I had to wait for a car to leave before I was able to park), we were able to find a table immediately on entering.\n\nThe inside is well decorated, clean, and inviting.  We were approached fairly quickly by our server, who asked for our drink orders.  We needed a few minutes to peruse the beers on tap listing.  From that point on, our experience was unbelievably bad.\n\nIt took us all of 2 minutes to figure out our drink preferences, but it was 10 minutes before our server returned.  She took our drink order and would have left straight-away, but we stopped her and asked for potato cakes as an appetizer, as we were famished.  It was 20 minutes later that the appetizers arrived, and we had to ask the runner where our drinks were.  5 minutes later, they appeared.\n\nWe were completely done with our appetizers (and still hungry) when our server finally returned and asked (in an incredulous tone) if we wanted to order dinner.  If you're not keeping track, I'll remind you that we've now been at McHale's for 40 minutes!  We ordered fish and chips (for me) and a veggie sandwich (for the wife), thinking that would be among the quicker-to-prep items on the menu.\n\nIt took just over 30 minutes for the food to arrive.  At least it was hot.  The fish was fine -- standard pub-style cod -- but the fries on both of our plates were only the end pieces, as though they had run out of full-figured fries and were dredging the bottom of the bag to find something to serve.  They were all crisp, no potato, and no flavor.  My wife's veggie sandwich was very plain.\n\nI'll spare you the remaining saga, but I'll bet you can guess that it was more of the same as it took us one hour and fifty minutes before we had paid our tab and were able to leave.  I understand that sometimes  as a table you end up in a perfect storm of minor mishaps, and I would never give up on a restaurant for that alone.  But through all of this, our server only showed up at our table 4 times, and was dour and terse to boot.  \n\nWe were in no rush.  In fact, we had planned on taking our time so we could enjoy the live music.  But poor service ruled the day.  All it would have taken to turn our frustration into an adventure was engaging interaction and some smiles from our server.

I've driven by many times, and the location, right on the lake, looks very nice.  You can tell from the general exterior decor that this place was probably last remodeled back in 1975.... but I'm not going to pass judgement on that. As we all know, sometimes places like this can have excellent food, be quite charming, and a good time.\n\nSince it's November, it was dark, and there of course was no outside seating.... no boats bobbing in the water... so other than a nice clear night with glassy water in the moonlight, there was not much to see. We did get seated at a very nice window seat, thanks to the hostess, who had orders barked to her by the \"manager\", who resembled a female version of Jabba The Hut from Star Wars... I felt bad for the hostess.\n\nI think the food was very good.... I had the Fantail Shrimp, our son a burger, and my wife the Gorgonzola/Walnut stuff chicken. We had an appetizer of the stuffed mushrooms. As far as the food goes, the mushrooms were probably really the only letdown of the evening.... slightly over-priced and underwhelming.... the gravy they were sitting in left much to be desired..... not terrible..... but not $9.95 appetizer good.....  ya know???\n\nInitially, when we sat, our server greeted us promptly, which I thought was great. Sadly, this was the only server-like action she took for the rest of the evening. After bringing our drinks, and taking our order, she was not to be seen again until after the main course had been delivered. My drink was empty, my wife's water was empty... she had wanted to order a beer. When our server finally did stop by, she did not ask about our food.... but at least we were able to order more drinks. When my wife asked what beer was on tap, she had no idea..... and didn't really seem to care to have an idea.\n\nI noticed that our server would disappear for long periods of time. In the time it took her to come out once, the server in the next section had made the rounds 4-5 times.... making sure everyone was ok, filling sodas/waters, etc. We were left sitting, alone.\n\nWhen we were finally done, she came to get plates. There were a few, since of course she hadn't been around to gather anything through the course of dinner. Since she couldn't take them all, she left a stack of dirty plates on our table - disgusting.  \n\nAt that point, I laid down 4 crisp $20's for our $75-ish tab, and we got the heck outta there...... as we departed the \"manager\" (Jabba The Hut) wished us good night in a very un-caring tone, and we noticed upon leaving the dinner specials - not mentioned to us by our server at all!!!!  Absolutely terrible.\n\nSo.... this place could be a solid 3-ish.... IF you get a good server... and if it's summer, and you sit outside, and it's nice..... you might hit a 4.  Again, our main courses we ordered were pretty good.... but with the poor service, our dinner basically sucked.", "business_id": "Zc2IwSzGY63zkyhfNrr7HA", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-11-15", "type": "review"}

I can say that the breading was perfectly crispy and well seasoned and that the fish was not at all over cooked, nice and moist. plus I think it cost $10 which was awesome (you can't get fish for breakfast at these prices in Chicago) \n\nFor me the biggest highlight of breakfast here is what they do to the potatoes (their name for them is eluding me at the moment) by request they will top your breakfast potatoes with a heap of meat, veggies and cheese, enough to make it a hangover-soaking-up meal unto itself.\n\nTo sum it all up: if you find yourself looking for breakfast and a little \"hair o' the dog\" in McFarland Wisconsin because \"What happens at the Beach House, stays at the Beach House\" and we all love that about any restaurant.", "business_id": "_wZTYYL7cutanzAnJUTGMA", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-11-26", "type": "review"}

I ordered scallops, and when they came to the table they were overcooked, but also cold. It took me at least 15 minutes to find the waitress to ask if I could get warmer food. She said that she would have the kitchen make up a new meal, and about 15 minutes later she returned with my same plate, with my original fork and original food. They scallops were now warm, but lacked flavor, and were even tougher than before.

I don't know the east side of town all that well but I do know that I like the Ale Asylum A LOT.  I seem to be successful in getting everyone to go there about 25% of the time; otherwise we end up at the Sports Pub.  I've spent quite a few nights here and I can't really say I've ever had a good time.  If I could I'd rate this 2.5 stars, because really this place isn't that bad.  It's just that there are so many places with better beer, nicer bartenders, friendlier crowds and better food.  Every time I've gone to the Sports Pub there have been good aspects of my experience, but something always goes wrong and I leave with a bad impression of the place.  \n\nThe first time, several years back, I remember having a really tasty burger, but the pitcher of Capital had little bits of gunk floating in it and the bartender tried to blame that on me.  That was enough for me to cross it off my list, but my friend really likes the place and I've been back multiple times since.  Last weekend, for example, we went for the second half of the Badger game.  It was crowded to be sure, but the service was good and my sandwich was pretty decent.  Unfortunately this was marred by the fact that we could not see a television from where the table was positioned, which kind of defeated the purpose of going to a sports bar.  I also got into a ridiculous argument with some drunk at the bar over something trivial, and I spent the rest of the afternoon hearing him loudly talk about me from across the bar.  Again, that's not really the fault of the Sports Pub but I just can't seem to have a nice time at this place.\n\nThe menu is actually pretty broad, with traditional bar food done up right.  The appetizers are the standard fare, and the spicy curly fries are really tasty.  The tap selection is on the low side of OK.  There's usually a Capital and Spotted, and aside from the aforementioned incident I haven't had a major problem with quality.  There's a foosball table near the door where I once schooled a plastered townie five games in a row before hubris got the better of me and I was resounding beaten by his girlfriend.  There are outdoor volleyball courts and leagues during the summer.  I'm sure that if I lived near this place I'd probably find it a nice local hangout.  But I don't, and every time I've made the trip over from Middleton I end up regretting the experience.  I just can't recommend the place, though I'm pretty sure that I'll find myself back there in the not so distant future.

As luck would have it, a table opened up near the bar, so we snagged it and decided to eat in the bar area.  An extremely helpful waitress immediately took our drink and appetizer orders; we browsed the menu until she returned.\n\nWith drinks in hand and the appetizer (IPA hummus plate) underway, she regrettably informed us they had run out of cod.  We opted for 2 plates of the lake perch and 1 plate of the walleye instead (I was dining with a couple of friends).\n\nThe service was excellent; she regularly checked on us, refilled drinks, and kept us in the loop the entire night.  5-stars for service.\n\nThe fish arrived and it was swimming in grease.  Gone was the excellent batter that I had experienced in the past; the perch was rubbery and extreeeeeeemely fishy tasting.  The walleye was equally greasy, over-battered, and also very fishy tasting.\n\nI love fish, and my friends are huge fishermen - they take trips to Canada, the boundary waters, and all sorts of other places to fish.  But even they agreed that the fish didn't taste like it should - one barely finished his smallish plate of perch; the other left at least half of the walleye.  I felt especially terrible when they asked me why I felt the fish was so good here... :-(\n\nThe rest of their food remains superb, especially the IPA hummus.  I'm certain you won't find a better hummus in the area.  I would also recommend the habanero shrimp and any of their burgers - they're excellent.\n\nOur check arrived; we settled-up and left, disappointed by the fish.  It's a shame, because I like Nick, and I really like the crew here, but something is amiss...\n\n:-(", "business_id": "HTplzElel_F_U_qhWuDKdg", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-09-22", "type": "review"}

It was cooked better than any other fish we've ever had - it was so perfectly prepared... the batter was light and crispy; it was served piping hot; no signs of grease - it had all of the makings of a great fish fry.\n\nBut it was too fishy tasting; not in a good way, but in a bad way.  Cod shouldn't have a strong fish flavor.  Save that for bad Ocean Perch or Smelt... and that's what this cod tasted like.  :-(  So, despite being prepared to perfection, it failed to deliver on taste.\n\nThe fries were perfect, which is such a shame.  The Villa knows how to fry a mean dish - just wish the fish wasn't so \"off\" tasting.  We'll give them another shot, though.  I'm sure the burgers and other offerings are going to be good - The Villa was spot-on with everything else, so the fish may have been a fluke.\n\nVilla Tap = No Win/No Fail - it's a tie\n\nService = 4 stars (fast, prompt, spot-on)\nFood = 2.5 stars (fish = fail; all others = win)\nValue = 4 stars ($40 for 3 people with appetizers and fish)\nMisc = 4 stars (atmosphere, homey feel)\n\nDefinitely a great little bar; we'll give the fish another shot at some point and we'll certainly try the rest of the menu items!", "business_id": "J2AiPQnKWBxBwc4MMkbH8w", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-10-10", "type": "review"}

The sad thing is that we \"tried\" to go to Red Lobster first, but were repelled by the large crowd of waiting people.  No, I don't want to stand around like cattle waiting for my pager to buzz so I can be ushered to a cramped seat, fed, branded, and ushered out again stampede style.  The mighty gods of chain restaurants everywhere are wagging their fingers at me right now saying, \"what do you expect lady?\"  I know, I know.  \n\nSo we went to Olive Garden down the street.  No wait there.  Our waitress was very young, I'll refer to her as \"Sparky\".  My dining companion had a sudden need to try some wine, so he asked Sparky what would pair well with the lasagna.  She didn't come across confident as she pointed to the list of wines on the menu that mister dining companion was holding.  She finally chose one and said that it would go well with the \"meaty\" dish.  I'm not sure what either one of us was expecting because after all this is Olive Garden and we have almost zero knowledge of wines.  So de-classA!!  \n\nAfter Sparky left our table, dining companion says that he expects the chosen wine to be the suck because Sparky doesn't look like she's even old enough to drink, let alone have knowledge of the fine wines.  But you know, none of this really matters when you consider the fact that compared to her we are old as dirt, and still don't know shit about wine.\n\nI had the eggplant Parmesan with Alfredo sauce.  It usually comes with marinara, but if I'm going to have a heart attack it had better well be because of something I enjoyed eating, not something I felt like I had to eat in the name of my health!  Hell no!  \n\nDining companion had his red wine something or other, and he was right it sucked.  He described it as tasting like, \"the barrel it came out of\".  \n\nAfter the main course I had the seasonal pumpkin cheesecake.  I made sure to look in a direction where no one could see my face before I crossed my eyes from sheer delight.  I am a pumpkin lovin' nerd by nature, and this cheesecake was gooood.\n\nSo this chain experience wasn't too bad.  The only thing that sucked was no refill on the bread sticks.  If I'm going to go slummin' at the chain restaurants, I expect the constant refills man.  Especially on those items they advertise as \"bottomless\" and/or \"never-ending\".

We left a good tip but I know a lot of people are not going to want to after being charged $2 plus whatever their bank charges just to get $$ to pay for dinner.  Honestly I think it is a greedy policy and they should change it (or do what Jennifer street market does and refund the ATM fee for those who need to use the ATM).  Their servers deserve better.", "business_id": "JJFoeKZXgi2_LeECDMkkoQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-11-30", "type": "review"}

I live in the Shenk-Atwood neighborhood, so I'm not writing as an outsider.

The Harmony is worse than Seinfeld's Soup Nazi because there's no irony or humor in being treated the way the employees here treat their customers. \n\nI won't get into specifics. I can only say that I take pride in my neighborhood. My wife and I frequent those establishments that understand that they are part of a community and treat their paying customers as such. The Harmony is a black mark on our neighborhood, and I am ashamed that unsuspecting visitors to the quaint east side should have to endure the abusive, disrespectful and generally unapologetic service at this establishment. If you scroll down you'll read other comments about the owner's girlfriend who is now manager. The last time I was in there with a group of friends, she couldn't have been more rude or insulting. When we all said we wouldn't be back, she merely shrugged her shoulders. \n\nIf you're visiting the East Side, there are plenty of other places that serve great food with friendly service. Alchemy, Mickey's, Wilson's, The Weary Traveller all come to mind as places that will make you feel and taste the love on the East Side.

Madison Pinball is a group of local collectors and enthusiasts and the games you see at Pooley's come from them. Currently they have: Addams Family, Space Shuttle, Star Trek, and Fun House.\n\nI love Addams Family, in fact it's my second favorite pinball in Madison! It's a very fun game with some cool magnet effects, including a seance mode (you just have to check it out). Space Shuttle is really fascinating for an older game but may be slow-moving for folks who are interested in more modern pinball. Star Trek - variations of this game are common around Madison but its still a favorite game of mine. I first began to understand pinball strategy playing Star Trek and think its a great game to start a pinball obsession for anyone. Fun House is frustrating but a classic as well, another solid game. Next to Rossi's, I think this is the best place to bring a group for pinball. \n\nOutside of the games, Pooley's gets a win because the bartenders are always kind and a few of them are pinball nuts too.", "business_id": "yrBo3c3OTKVO4H1ttBxadw", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-09-08", "type": "review"}

My sandwich felt apart immediately. Ugh. The chicken was a little underdone as well, verging on pink. I didn't get sick from eating it, so that's a plus. I gave half of it to my roommate and he didn't get sick either. So the three of us all ate mediocre chicken sandwiches and we survived. People seem to like their pizza, so maybe go with that.\n\nThe crowd was also interesting. A bunch of bros and bottle blondes. That sums it up pretty accurately, actually. I felt some hard glares from across the bar from some sketchy looking dudes. With limited physical strength, I would absolutely not feel safe going to Pooley's alone on a Saturday night. Absolutely not. Maybe the daytime crowd doesn't look so threatening. \n\nThe bartenders were friendly, and did a great job. They should migrate somewhere else, because I'd gladly order from them again. But, I will not return to Pooley's.

All types of local sports and Big 10 memorabilia, banners, helmets, caps, jerseys, etc. \n\nAs far as food, they have a nice selection of bar food. Regarding beer, they could do a bit better. Some nice local brews including New Glarus. I switched from Hopalicious to Alpha King in a bottle which I was told is very hard to get. They have drink specials every day. Mostly on certain mixed drinks and standard brews like Bud/Bud light. I had their buffalo wings where they give you 8 wings, but no celery/carrots. The bleu cheese or ranch on the side is to dip your wings if they're too spicy. They had a nice dry rub with an excellent seasoning possibly with a little smoke added. Very crisp, meaty and tasty.

This one wasn't my choice though, and knowing how I feel about chains as well as my high standards for Italian cuisine, I bit my tongue and hoped for the best.\n\nWe had to wait about 10 minutes on a Tuesday night to be seated. Apparently Olive Garden is a hot commodity in Champaign....\n\nWe were seated and I was quite indecisive about what to get. I settled on a build-your-own-pasta with alfredo/cream sauce and added Italian sausage. For my choice of soup, I got the Tuscan bean, and of course the notorious breadsticks. The soup was pretty tasty, it had like beans and zucchini and onions and a bunch of other things in a tasty tomato-y broth. Not bad! The pasta I got wasn't too bad either, the noodles may have been a little overcooked but the sauce was pretty creamy. I did not like the sausage. I'm no tubular meat expert but this tasted really institutional and for the upcharge it cost to add it to my pasta, I probably should have just went meatless or ordered the chicken, like my smarter date did....\n\nThe thing that really upset me about the experience though was the service. I don't remember the server's name, he was actually quite personable, but our meal felt very very rushed. Our soups came out quick which was good, but I was not even halfway done with mine before our dinners had arrived and we had to move our soups out of the way to eat our dinner. I'd consider myself a fast eater, too so this was frustrating, especially since I wanted to actually talk to my date, you know, the reason why I'm here in the first place!! This wasn't the last straw though, I was probably 75% done with my entr\u00e9e when the server comes up and asks if we are interested in desert. Ugh! We looked at each other and both agreed this meal was unnecessarily rushed. At that point I just asked for the bill which he pulled up on those tacky tablet things a lot of chain restaurants have now.\n\nThe food wasn't even as bad as I thought it was going to be, but the hurriedness of the service really put me off. 2/5", "business_id": "H0D2HYqLd9MRCq68rtbTyQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-10-05", "type": "review"}

They use gigantic glasses of mixer with a single standard shot. We also ordered shots separately and each shot was $2 for 0.5 fl oz. I was stunned. I have not really ventured to campus bars in my three-and-a-half years here because I consistently have bad experiences. 0.5 fl oz for a shot is the next level of low. Most campus bars at least pretend to not be totally lost and call 1 oz a shot... But 0.5 just leaves me speechless. Standard shot, you guys, is 1.5 fl oz. Nowhere else have I seen a recipe for mixed drink with an 8 to 1.5 mixer to liquor ratio. That's basically spiked Sprite. My point is, they have -1000 drink craftsmanship. Which is fine since apparently you're supposed to lower your standards on campus. But what really gets me is that they sell 0.5 oz dribbles of liquor and call it a shot... \n\nFood: Food service is poor though the food is fairly good. We waited an unusually long time for two burgers. We began to think something was wrong so we peeked into the kitchen (after asking a server and having to wait more) and it looked like the cook was cooking away... And then he ate the food. I get it... If I were working all night I'd get hungry too.

These were a rendition of the cheese curd but a very sub par one. The cheese inside was not hot enough so the cheese didn't squish out when eating them, it just kind of stuck to the breading. Next off, I had the burger. I ordered the mushroom burger which was the Tuesday special. When I got my burger it had no mushrooms on it and the cheese was barely melted.

On a Friday night, the place was near deserted after about 10:30pm, with a regular or two, a couple of drunks and a group of quiet students. Seating is in cramped booths unsuitable for people taller than 6', or at the bar. The interior is hideous: bugly, dated paneling, linoleum and illumination by neon promo signs. My kind of place.\n\nThey have 2 beers on tap as I recall, PBR and High Life. The special that night was Hamm's cans, which were had for (surprisingly, to me) more than a dollar each. The good news is that either Hamm's is a lot better than I remember, or I was drunker than I thought. I had been drinking 'good' beer at other downtown establishments known for the same, but the Hamm's were somehow better. Thinking about how well those Hamm's hit the spot makes me want one right now.\n\nThe Brass Rail has an internet juke box to kill the otherwise oppressive silence, and is a total ripoff if you put less than $5 in, but has an impressive selection. They have a soft-tip dartboard, a couple of tvs and a broken pinball machine. They also have frozen pizza that they can make for you for less than $5, but it is pretty crappy pizza. Huber's' pizza is way better. Ours got burnt black in places and was too salty but  was still promptly devoured. For two days I wondered how I burned my mouth.\n\nService is great, and friendly.

I do like the way you can put your own stuff on the burgers and all, and the toppings are nice and fresh. Maybe next time I'll order something else!

I've sampled some pretty caloric fare over the last few days, so thought I'd try something a bit lighter today for lunch.  Stopped in to this place and saw that they had a strawberry salad with chicken and a raspberry vinaigrette and got that with spinach subbed for the mixed greens.\n\nService was friendly and astonishingly quick.  Salad came back in probably under 3 minutes from the time I ordered it.  So that was good.  And the salad TASTED great. So why am I giving this place three stars?  Well, first, in order to get 5 stars you have to be really exemplary.  This place was very good in a lot of ways and would probably get a 4* rating from me except.... they REALLY need to work on their presentation.  \n\nThe salad shows up and it has a lot of great things going for it... spinach, strawberries, walnuts, grapes.... and then they had this huge pasty white chicken breast thrown on top in a single form and they had the garishly pink vinaigrette just poured right on top.  The salad LOOKED horrible.  I'm not sure how they cooked the chicken, but based on the way it looked, it could have been boiled because it was just this pasty, gelatinous pale breast that was completely unappetizing. And the pink dressing on top of it didn't help.\n\nI strongly considered eating around the chicken, but brought myself to taste it and it was actually really good.  I just don't know how they cooked it to make it look so horrible.  So my suggestions for this restaurant when serving a salad that includes chicken: Throw it on the grill for a few seconds to give it some grill marks or do SOMETHING to give it some color.  And then toss the salad to mix in that pink dressing.\n\nSo good food, good service, but presentation of my dish kept this place from getting 4*", "business_id": "IUhO58Il7gUEjl1RMEncHA", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-11-16", "type": "review"}

The club scene is not very different from California (Bay Area specifically) clubs, however, a first timer here, such as myself, would very easily get lost in the building unless guided by a knowledgeable person. I was not able to find the dance floor on my own, and initially assumed that the first area with the bright lights and bar was the dance floor.\n\nThere were several floors; three to be exact from what I remember. The basement, or the lowest level in the building, were the bathrooms, which, in my opinion was extremely small and could not accommodate 250+ people inside one building in a timely manner. The main level (1st floor, right when you enter) consisted of a bar and a little social area. Walk past that and you will hit the dance floor. The second level was a bar and a couple of tables where people can socialize, with more of a bar feel to it. The lights are very dimmed so things can and may get a little more personal, or intimate, in this section of the building. \n\nThe bartenders are very busy, which I can clearly see so customer service in my opinion would not play a factor. The bouncers don't mess with you unless you give them reason to. The crowd is very diverse and energetic.\n\nThe thing that struck me were the floors. About two hours inside the club, the floors got really slippery. I understand people spill drinks, but that's the first case where it was like walking on frozen ice without ice skates.\n\nOverall a good experience.

This place is right across the street from the station. I sat by myself at the bar, but there were plenty of others riding solo as well. It was THAT kind of place - where the locals can come and drown away their sorrows. Actually, it was much more than that - this place seems to have a little bit of everything. There are pool tables in the back, so you can get that sort of crowd. There are larger tables as well, so you can see some large groups of students gabbing away. There are a good amount of TV's, so there were some people watching the evening college football games. There are decent sized booths, so I saw a couple people typing away on laptops. And there's a jukebox, so some people are silently rocking out to the classics. And perhaps best of all, there were plenty of townies around for some great people watching. At one point of the locals who had clearly had too much to drink began serenading a nearby booth with the Canadian National Anthem. Although he didn't get the words right, I gave him an A+ for effort. The bartenders called the guy a cab and made sure he got home okay. It felt like I was inside some sort of insider club where everybody is friends, and even the students are cool with the townies.\n\nThe beer selection was surprisingly good. There were a lot of good import options available, although I stuck with $2.25 Bud Light drafts. Remember, I was taking the Amtrak home, so that shows you how much money I wanted to spend.... They have $1.50 PBR drafts too, which is what the locals stuck to. The food was pretty good as well. I had a simple cheeseburger and fries. Although not my favorite burger/fries combo, it was definitely worth the $4.50 I paid. The \"fixin's table\" they have is nothing more than onions, pickles, and tomatoes next to some condiments and sauces - Nothing special there. But there was something cool about being able to put that stuff on yourself, I guess.\n\nThe charm of this place lies in the characters that visit, and for that alone, I am giving a 5 star rating. The cheap food and beer is an added bonus. And I almost forgot, free peanuts!

Its journeyman efforts will win friends and a few high fives, but it is not the flashy varsity letterman. \n\nFood here is just fine, and very reasonably priced. I have been disappointed with the size of their appetizers once or twice, but their entrees are a solid value, cooked dependably to be exactly what you expect in pub grub. Prices are very good for downtown Champaign, but they lack the booze selection of a Radio Maria or Blind Pig. The gross looking jar on the bar is infused vodka.\n\nService is always friendly, and fastest at the bar. If you sit at their pretty awesome outside tables, the trade off is that you're gonna get ignored. You can order lunch ahead and pick up 15 minutes later. The free peanuts are priceless, as are the friendly patrons who are more likely than other crowds in town to strike up a convo with you. \n\nAll this sounds pretty complimentary, but the fact is that this place is not stand-out awesome in any particular way. If you want to take your friends from Chicago to visit 4 places in downtown Champaign that are all different from each other, to give them an idea of what the \"new\" Champaign has to offer, you aren't going to stop at Esquire.

It's also the place I had my first legal drink, the place I arranged my first (extremely underwhelming) one-night stand, the place I had my first post-breakup talk ... the list goes on and on. In short, the Esquire is a place of firsts for me, and for that reason it holds an unimpeachable place in my heart.\n\nIt's a good place, even taking none of the above into account. The prices are reasonable, the service is friendly, the drinks are stiff, the food is tasty, the jukebox kicks much ass (except on one night a few years back when some doucherocket fed about a million dollars into the machine and played Pogues records all night, but I am willing to let bygones be bygones). There's a nice array of seating options: small tables, mid-size tables, large booths, and the bar itself, which is the best place to sit if you want super-fast service and a good vantage point for eavesdropping and people-watching. There are also some tables outside, which are nice places to park your ass if you're a smoker or like keeping an eye on the goings-on along Walnut. The outdoors is heated during chilly weather, and although it doesn't too a ton of good in the dead of winter, it's lovely on brisk autumn nights.\n\nThe people who frequent this place are an interesting mix. Some townies, some students, some regulars, some noobs. You're just as likely to see a gaggle of hipsters looking vaguely out of place as you are to see a group of middle-aged business types in dad jeans. Every once in a while some truly fresh and interesting personalities will be present, such as a trio of cackling cougars sipping pineapple margaritas and flirting with any male under the age of 26, or two sharply-dressed men having a snappy but ultimately friendly conversation you ache to be a part of, or a crusty old man with a walrus mustache who will pound your table with a hammy fist and yell something that sounds friendly but is completely unintelligible. Oh, and every once in a while Tim Lash of Hum fame will be hanging around, which I think we can all agree is pretty delightful. (I do not advocate drunkenly pestering him, of course, but if you do want to say hi be assured that he's about the nicest dude on earth and will receive your attention with much grace and warmth.)\n\nOne of the best, most endearing things about this bar is its all-around friendliness. I often go here by myself in the evening with whatever book I'm currently reading, fold myself into a corner, and order a few beers. Not once has any patron or staff member given me grief over this, and for that I am truly grateful. Yes, the linoleum is hideous and yes, the bathrooms are a little iffy, but all the bartenders remember my name, and that's something that can't be beat.", "business_id": "pPWre8lbVAssER6CN0uWMw", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-09-28", "type": "review"}

You could say I grew up throwing peanut shells on the floor and stomping on them. (For the record, I still throw the shells on the floor, but I no longer do the accompanying dance--that stopped being cute around age eight.) Before my family moved away from Champaign, this was the number one place we would take out of town relatives visiting. Even as objectively yummier, cooler places opened up around town, Aunt So-and-so and Uncle Whatshisface would always demand to be taken back to Esquire, and we were always happy to oblige. It's a comfortable, unpretentious bar, and that's what you needs sometimes.\n\nIt's all about the ambiance, really.

Even though I have not lived in Chamaign for about 10 years, I can still find people I know, and bartenders that remember me.\n\nWhen I was little I would order kiddy cocktails from the bar, then get change to play on the only pinball machine.  Then stomp on all the peanut shells on the floor.  I have seen expansion many times.  Originally from one bar and a few booths, to a wrap around bar, then finally to the pool hall and extra bar area that you see now.  I have met U of I basketball coaches here, there are pictures of former Cubs players kissing my Mom (wait, what).  My parents originally met here.  It is safe to say my family has a mullti generational history here.\n\nAnyway, beyond the nostalgia, it is one of the best pubs to visit in the downtown area.  Just a great place to relax and have a few drinks.  Along with the evolution of the bar, so has the menu.  Now there is a mix of pub grub like burgers, fish sandwiches, etc.  Which I don't think are that great.  Though the various pizzas are very good.  As are the wings, which I am not typically a fan of.  Though these are baked, not fried and battered like most.  The Asian Dumplings are great as well.  The service can be hit or miss.  Depending on the time you come, and where you order.  Bar service is pretty good, but the waitresses can be a bit confused when trying to find you after you place the order.  Though they work hard, and always take care of anything that might be wrong.\n\nDrinks are pretty standard.  There are a handful of good micros on tap.  Usually something from Two Brothers or Dark Horse as the main micros available on tap.  A bit more extensive selection in bottles.  The rest is typical drinks for a neighborhood bar.\n\nOverall, not perfect.  Though the goods far out way the bad.

My hubby and I went there on our first date and have been back many times since then.  It's not a dive bar, it's not super ritzy, it's always clean and to me, being there feels kind of like you've just gone over to your best friend's house to hang out for awhile.  It's never too loud, never too crazy, they have great service and they do a fantastic thin crust pizza.  My personal faves lie in a dead heat between their \"margherita\" and \"fajita\" pizza.  Though this isn't the only place to offer these selections, they blow away the competition.  Jup's isn't even in the same class with anyone else, it just is what it is (awesome) and I love that about the place.

Relaxed. Mostly old people, townies. It's clean as well. \n\nBut the pizza is much too small for the price. Maybe someone with a normal sized appetite can chime in.\n\nUpdate: I think I found out why I thought it was overpriced. I saw that the pizza was $7 on the menu (I just confirmed it).

This place blew my mind it was so good.  We chose to do the tasting menu which was about 6 courses, complete with a cheese course and dessert.  I paired it with the wines too. The wine list was definitely impressive.  Lots of interesting wines at very fair prices. They are considered a wine bar, so I was hoping for a good list.  But I was impressed with the prices, there were many bottles on the list for under $30 which is always great to me.  It's easy to fill a list with great expensive bottles, but it is indeed very difficult to pick a variety of great wines at reasonable prices. The wines paired perfectly with each dish, I was so happy.  About the food... I was just so impressed.  The octopus over german potato salad was unlike anything I've ever had, and just so delicious.  Yes, it does sound strange but it was so well done, and the octopus was cooked just perfectly, it was so tender.  I was so thrilled the chef has decided to include this as one of the courses.

We also had braised rabbit, which again was tender and also quite flavorful sitting in a pool of broth, with some tomatoes, and homemade pasta.  The rib eye for the main course was flavorful and again very tender.  The cheese course was fun.  And I loved thin very rich slice of chocolate dessert.

That said, this could be a product of where I sat.   Even though I placed a reservation close to a week in advance, I found myself sitting at the table nearest to the kitchen with my date.  While she had a view of downtown Champaign and the restaurant's interior, my own view was of a row of temperature controlled wine racks and a junky-looking electrical socket near the kitchen's entrance.     \n\nFor the appetizer, we had the pizzetta, which didn't strike me as anything special:  just bread, cheese, grape tomatoes, onion, and bacon.   Our entrees-- the braised rabbit and the grouper-- were better, but as others have mentioned, the portions were quite small, even for a restaurant focused on contemporary fine-dining.  Thanks to a bottle of wine and a second helping of bread, nobody left hungry, but with the final bill clocking in at close to $120, it was hard not to walk away with a sense that some of that money could be better spent elsewhere.         \n\nUltimately, in giving Bacaro three stars, I am rating it in the context of other \"fine-dining\" establishments.

I wish they would drop the cover charge down or at least offer some drink specials! \n\nThe bar has its own set of problems: I just hate spending $40 on drinks and not even getting a buzz out of it. It's hard enough to tell the bartender what you want over the music, but it's even harder when everything you ask for they don't have (or maybe they think they don't have it because they can't hear me?) Mind you I'm not picky or difficult, I just expect the bartender to know how to make the drink I want or at least stock  2 of the 3 beers I'm asking for.\n\nSolution for the Yelper: If you can, drink before you go.\n\nSeating: Maybe, just maybe, invest in another velvetine sectional or two. Club Pallazzo certainly charges enough for cover to afford a new couch. I like to rest my pretty feet after I'm done dancing and people watch, and maybe I don't feel like going on the patio.\n\nThe Ambiance: The inside is gorgeous. It's definitly the atmosphere that brings all the boot-stomping night owls out en masse. The frescoes on the walls and ceiling sport scantily clad vampiresses looking for a bite, and the velvet curtains that hang from the ceiling to the floor, along with the throne chairs give the club it's regal aire.\n\nThe Music: It's true, they have different DJ's switch off sets. The DJ I like also DJ's at Le Homme on Wed. nights. If I don't like what's playing I head outside for fresh air on the ample patio. But overall the music is good. \n\nI know some people that go every weekend. If I did that, I would be living in the alleyway behind Tranz.

Quite simply, there's a small bar to the left, a small VIP lounge to the right, and nothing but dance-able space in between. With a high ceiling, liberal use of bright neon blues, mirror'd-shiny surfaces, and sleek furniture, the atmosphere is energetic and cool.\n\nThe DJ, perched in a second floor booth overlooking the dancefloor, played track after track of Hip-Hop, for the most part. [From reading other reviews, I'm not sure Hip-Hop/R&B is part of the regular format. We'd been there the first week of Oct'09.] And so, the girls (Esco, RB, Becca), all talented and passionate dancers, took to the floor, wowing and attracting a perimeter of onlookers.  I danced a bit, broken ankle be darned: it'd take more than crutches to keep me from having a good time with my peeps...\n\nAs I sat for a minute, resting the cast'd ankle, a group of people complimented the girls on their style and dancing; very friendly, flattering gesture.\n\nBy 3AM, it was almost exclusively the 6 of us still on the dance floor being silly, and though we could have danced more, we had liquor at the apartment where the club had made last call around 2am.\n\nFun night and a fun little spot, but I'd suggest going with a group; friendly as people were, I'm not sure how apt this scene is to mingling/meeting/dancing with others.

I was hanging out at home when I got the call to hang out with this guy for a low key night.  I had to remind him it was Monday Night Football and the NLDS game of Phillies v. Rockies.  So he suggests we hit up Majerle's, which I'm down for because it means more sport watching and less talking.\n\nSo I find my way down here, and say screw it to paying for parking.  After the whole $20 to park at Westgate, I'm down to take my chances at getting a parking ticket.  It's ridiculous how much the city makes off of parking, parking tickets, and the ever illustrious DUIs.\n\nAnyways, I go into Majerle's, completely ignored by the hostess out front.  Glad to know she's getting paid $8.50 to not talk to anyone and act pretty...  Settle down at the bar and order a Blue Moon, because it's a Monday, it's football, it's baseball, and I'm preparing for another laborious date.\n\nHalfway through my beer my date arrives.  Which wouldn't be cool, but I need to get good and drunk so I deal.  He automatically decides we need to get wings.  Thanks for deciding...because I have no thoughts of my own.  Apparently him being a gentleman meant he would talk shit on the wings I wanted, then reluctantly give in to getting the boneless buffalo wings.  Which are $5 along with four other appetizers during their 4-8 pm happy hour.  Good deal there!\n\nThe wings come out within 15 minutes or so and they look...odd.  It looks like someone sliced tofu and lightly fried them, then dipped them in excessive amounts of sauce.  Definitely not the most appetizing item to look at.  I wished they looked better, because then I wouldn't have the hippie making fun of me the whole time.  They tasted okay, but the look alone was too much of a turn off to enjoy.\n\nThe bartender disappeared after we ordered the wings, so we spent some time waiting for her to discover us again so we could order our entree.  Oh how I wished she had taken our order earlier.  I had to listen to the douche hippie talk smack on the Angels and how people die all the time so Adenhart's death didn't matter.  Yeah...that deserved a total smack in the face.  Or complete beat down.  Don't ever hate of my Angels or commit blasphemy against Adenhart.  I will not stand for that, especially if I've had a few drinks in me.\n\nAnyways, so I eventually order the veggie wrap with chicken and he gets the chicken parmesan.  Not too much time passes, so I could enjoy the flat screens and watch the Dolphins show Mark Sanchez how to play a real football game.  The wrap comes, and it's huge!  I enjoyed the fruit salad of pineapple and grapes.  And the actually spinach tortilla and veggies were good, but the chicken just dragged the wrap down.  It was so bland and tasteless.  I wish I would have just gone pure veggie.\n\nI had a couple rounds of beer after that, just to pass the time until the Dolphins could be declared the official winners.  Conversation came and went with the people at the bar, far more interesting than the person I was with.  The beers came and went, and soon it was time to peace out.

I really covet being wowed, I like being pleasantly surprised, and I can have a perfectly merry day with a run of the mill meal. Unfortunately, there are some experiences that don't fit in to any of my \"I will return again and again or at least recommend to friends\" template.\n \n Majerle's is one of those experiences.\n\nI know that I should definitely give this place another try but only because I had such a bad time I think that it must have been entirely abnormal because it would be out of business if it was run this way daily.\n When I arrived on Sunday afternoon (right as the Cardinals game was about to start), there were several content tables already enjoying their beer and bar fare. I must say that the food wasn't terrible. I wouldn't classify it as anything special or something that I would crave on any particular day. But the wings were crisp, the salad was fresh'ish' and the burger was prepared to the temp I ordered. This is where the one star came from. Decent food (good temp, tastes like what it's supposed to, sans hair, ect) deserves some credit.\n \n   If I could give negative stars for service, this would be a -5 Stars type of place. Our server was either hung over or was just entirely uninterested in doing ANYTHING that her job description calls for. She greeted us about ten minutes after we sat down (although it was a Cardinals game day, the bar was probably about half full). She took our drink order and returned with our drinks ages later (well, another almost ten minutes). I was starving and ready to order food but wasn't able to because she slammed the drinks on the table and left again. I flagged down another server and he was so kind as to send ours back. FINALLY I ordered. Again, the food was fine. It wasn't, however, fine enough to cancel out the fact that our appetizer was delivered 20 minutes laster followed IMMEDIATELY by our entree's. Ok. Fine. But, the salad was wrong the first time (Note: When your guests are ordering, it helps to listen to what they actually want. It is NOT a good practice to forget and then just 'guess' what they said). And our server didn't even deliver our food so we couldn't order another drink until we flagged her down again. We ordered another two beers and waited. And waited. And waited. I saw our beers sitting on the bar and our server chatting in the corner to another associate. We couldn't get her attention so my dining companion/boyfriend went to the bar himself to get them. In fact, we didn't see our server again for the rest of the meal. I was so irate at this point that I wanted to leave immediately and spend our Sunday afternoon football watching/beer drinking pennies elsewhere. I flagged down the same server I asked to find my server the first time and had him do my bidding again (he seemed to be working, why couldn't I have sat in HIS section?) She came over, mumbled some apology about having to get our own beers and dropped our check. \n  Bright points: They have a great tv set up for football watching. Multiple tv's tuned to every single game you could imagine. \nNot so Bright Points: For me, watching football at a sports bar has necessary accoutrements (steady flow of beer, timely delivery of food, ect) to make it enjoyable. This mark was completely missed due entirely to the complete disregard our server had for her job. Or her guests.\nDownright Dim points: Well, this review pretty much sums it up.\n If I'm in the area and kind of desperate, perhaps I'll try it again. Probably Not.", "business_id": "45puCRQ6Vh_IIAy7kkfFDQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-11-20", "type": "review"}

You can tell the employees love the place that they work out and enjoy to serve the patrons.\n\nMy office has had several private parties at this location. They have two areas where you can throw parties. My favorite is the Cotton Room. It is a private room that is very hip, urban, all white with glass mirrors surrounding the room.

I would have returned it but our waitress had disappeared after my husband didn't order a second beer.\nSpeaking of my husband, he ordered a burger that also came without condiments. He waited patiently for 15 minutes for our waitress to reappear, finally asking some other server for mayo. She also refilled our drinks.

It was a good choice, I think.  I didn't care for the outside which has loud music playing but inside it's a nice pub (upscale is a bit of a stretch...) with lots of TVs tuned to sports.  We were able to snag two seats at the bar and even ordered some nachos.  \n\nA few thoughts:\n\nStanding room is kind of scarce.  If it ever got really packed you would have to stand around people at tables eating and while I don't really care I know that its something my husband doesn't like to do.  \n\nIt took forever to get the bartenders to notice us and take our orders.  And we were sitting at the bar!  When our nachos came they were asking for the \"S.\" party and we were flailing our arms in front of the bartender and screaming \"that's us!\" and she still didn't see us!\n\nThe bartenders were pretty cool.  They made some futile attempts to get a \"Let's Go Dbacks\" chant going but the crowd wasn't that into it.  (And at that point there weren't that many Cubs fans there...)  They had a good healthy banter with the Cubs fans which was amusing.   They didn't care when we ordered shots of Jager, although the two female Cubs fans next to us were shocked.  (Sorry, this is just how we roll.  We don't take shots of whatever that nuts and berries concoction that you're drinking is....)  \n\nThe nachos were strange.  The chicken was like grade F chicken and there was a lot of the fixings but they were not well layered at all.   There was a ton of stuff on top (including all the guac and sour cream) then a bunch of naked chips and then a whole ton of cheese and all the beans on the bottom.  We also asked for jalapenos on the side, but they just didn't give them to us at all.\n\nI would definitely go back here before a game again.  It was a good relaxed atmosphere and a quick walk over to the stadium.

We started out with appetizers including meatballs, Italian nachos, and a wedge salad for the table. The meatballs were actually pretty good and my girlfriend also enjoyed her wedge salad. However, the Italian nachos were just plain disgusting. They reminded me of those cheap $1.50 Totino's pizzas that you can get in the freezer aisle at the grocery. The \"chips\" were mushy on the outside and hard as a brick on the inside; the toppings were clearly cheap and tasted awful. For my meal, I ordered the bourbon steak flat bread wrap. It was absolutely inedible. I was very hungry and was only able to force down two bites of the sandwich before calling it quits -- something that is unheard of for me. \n\nAltogether, I hope no one else makes the mistake of going to this place and expecting the good food that people here have written about.

She said they weren't all that great (which is really sad cause its hard to mess us cheese sticks right?). My sandwich came with some curly fries that were horrible. They looked as if they hadn't been cooked long enough (they were white instead of that golden brown we all know and love), and some seasoning salt was sprinkled on top in an effort to distract me from how terrible they were. The sandwich though, was actually decent. There was a huge chicken breast patty dipped in buffalo sauce, sitting on top of a bun.

However, when my husband and I met Kristin S and her husband there for happy hour a few weeks ago, I was pleasantly surprised to find out that Cheuvront also has a full bar. Unfortunately, the discounted specialty cocktails they offered during happy hour weren't particularly appealing (I tend to shy away from martinis with names like \"Grapetini\"), and the cucumber mojito I did try was way too sweet, but it was really nice to know that they had a full bar. \n\nThey also featured a small happy hour menu with 7-8 items for $5 each. Unlike some other reviewers, I wasn't that impressed with the mac and cheese (it didn't have nearly enough cheese and had none of the crispiness I usually associate with the homemade version of the dish). We also found the mini pizza to be just average (although the slightly creamy tomato sauce was delicious). \n\nHowever, the Ancho Pork Empanadas with a side of orange marmalade were absolutely delectable, and the pate was a really generous portion for the price. We also enjoyed the dinner salad we ordered off the regular menu (the shallot vinaigrette was delicious) and the Pumpkin Bread Pudding, which was a little dry but had great flavor. Our dining companions both had the Salad Niscoise, featuring ahi tuna, which looked filling but light. \n\nIn terms of service and atmosphere, we were pretty impressed. We appreciated the fact that we could sit a regular table and order off the happy hour menu, and our server was definitely available when we needed him. I also loved the urban but not over-the-top decor; there are some nice loft-like touches (slick floors, metal accents, ceiling beams) throughout that fit in beautifully with the residential Artisan Lofts that occupy the rest of the building.  \n\nCheuvront is a solidly enjoyable place to kick back after a long day of work. Although some of their happy hour food and cocktails could use some improvement, I was impressed by the atmosphere, service, and most of the dishes.

I suppose it is time for an update.\n\nMy initial review of 5 stars has not changed.  Not every visit to Cheuvront has been a 5 star visit, but over time I have come to know what dishes and wines that I prefer.   I am a frequent visitor to Cheuvront because I like the atmosphere it provides within the downtown area and it takes less than 5 minutes for me to walk there.  It provides a relaxed environment where you can enjoy wine or a cocktail and order food based upon how what you are in the mood for.  A full dinner? Sure.  Just dessert? You got it.  A small nosh? Why not.   I find myself here most often for small plates and cheese, very rarely do I have a \"regular\" entree.  It is not to say that they aren't good, they are and they are quite large, I just enjoy the variety of the menu.  \n\nMy favorite time of year at Cheuvront is the fall, as I think that their best dishes involve traditional fall ingredients such as butter nut squash and pumpkin.  This is also my favorite time to partake in their extensive cheese list.  Their international plates, while may seem expensive at first glance, are literally overflowing with cheese and meats.  Happy Hour can be a fun time, although I am personally not a fan of many of the mixed cocktails that they feature.  This works out just fine, as the wine list has many choices that I am happy to order at 25% off.  The $5 tapas offered during HH are great compliments, my favorites being the gnocchi, ceviche, and the mac and cheese.

I went down to Cheuvront with a few friends for Restaurant Week.  The place is tiny, very relaxed-hip looking, and right on Central Ave.  While the place doesn't have any distinct look or theme going on, there was a movie with french subtitles playing on a screen next to the dining area so...I guess it's supposed to be French.  They have wine and cheese too, so, yeah, probably French.\n\nSo the meal didn't start out so great.  The spinach salad came out to me on a dirty place.  Sure, it's a restaurant.  I know other people use the same plates and silverware I'm using, but things like that, especially when noticed, are off-putting.  Unfortunately, the ahi tuna that followed was also overdone.  Not in a bad way, and I almost didn't notice through the thick peppercorn crusting, but when it was pointed out, I was a little disappointed.\n\nThat was when they pulled out dessert.\n\nI'm not a sweets person.  I don't know that I've ever been.  Give me spicy or savory 10 times out of 10 over any kind of sweet-tasting anything.  Although my dentist might argue evidence to the contrary, I really just don't have a sweet tooth.  That being said, I wanted to die and be entombed in the citrus flan that was put in front of me.  I wanted to lick the plate clean and then go back to the kitchen and demand they fill my pockets, one with the smooth, creamy, more-like-custard-than-flan flan and the other with the wonderfully sweet and subtle citrus sauce they coated the dish with.  I'd also probably ask for some of the figs and berries to be put in a doggie bag.\n\nI have never, in my entire life, enjoyed a dessert as much as this one.  I would happily drive the 20-plus minutes downtown just to have this again.\n\nBefore I forget or the keyboard shorts out from me drooling, the wine selection here is also amazing.  I didn't take time to look at the whole thing, but I think most wine connoisseurs would be happy here.\n\nWhile it was a mixed bag, the place certainly deserves another trip.

But the tomato basil soup with goat cheese chunks stirred throughout was amazing. I would go back and just have that soup. \n\nAll in all a nice lunch, but I'm not in a huge rush to go back. Maybe for drinks and an appetizer before dinner (someplace else)? Also., we felt it was a bit odd that everytime our female server (she never divulged her name) came to our table she addressed us as \"Lady and Gentleman.\" At least tell me your name before you call me that for an hour! ;)", "business_id": "muCl5p-9ut1sY0aKeUeRhw", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-10-12", "type": "review"}

The place is pretty much empty for a Sunday night being right across from a light rail station. I ask the waitress to seat me on a couch and I follow and continue my important phone conversation. The restaurant is located below some loft in central phoenix and has an urban contemporary concrete feel to it. There is a full menu but I focus in on the cheese and wine menu. I order the three-cheese sampler and a glass of wine, a medium red from Santa Monica California. The wine is smooth and the cheeses flavorful and after waiting 20 minutes for it to arrive I guess prune juice and cardboard would have been just as  flavorful. I guess good cheese takes time to cut. The decor was a bit mixed matched with concrete grays and pastel curtains. I felt like I was more in an Austin Powers flick than in a hip wine bar. The wait for service was considerable considering that the place was one third full. The bill came out to more than $50 bucks, I would say a little pricey for the wasting my time; it took a couple minutes for my eyes to adjust when I left.

We got there at 3 pm, the place was completely empty.  The bartender mentioned that happy hour started at 4 and gave us the menu to glance at.  Seeing as we had an hour we just had a few beers to start, and to tide us over until happy hour.\n\nThe beer was Papago Orange Blossom (which is glorious!).

The mojitos were good, the mango one tasted like dessert, a little overly sweet.\n\nAgain, everything is cool, until the check arrives.  They charged us the normal $8 for the pomegranate mojito instead of the happy hour price.  I asked the manager and he just gives me a blank stare and tells me it wasn't on the happy hour menu.  I briefly glanced at the happy hour menu and I didn't take inventory of all the items on it.  He decided not to be cool about it and left it on the bill.\n\nI know times are tough around here but when you charge those high prices ($6.50 for a pint?!), and then screw over your customers, absolutely ridiculous.

I am a fan of the one cheese plate for $5, margherita flatbread ($6, I think) and their goat cheese phyllo pockets with a balsamic sauce. God, those are to die for. On the dinner menu, we also tried a bleu cheese mac and cheese that was delicious. \n\nSince the first cheese tasting, I have been to an American cheese tasting, and most recently a Spanish cheese tasting.

The sorbet was good as well.\n\nOverall, I was disappointed.

The food was a little better than what I'd have expected from a sports bar; the variety was a tad on the expansive side, but I'm glad that my BBQ plate didn't have anything that was butchered and horrible.  But the suds flowed well and I was able to enjoy several football games simultaneously.  Multiple times, I wondered why it was so sparsely populated for a football afternoon, but I suppose that could be a little bit of a culture clash from the east coaster like me coming from a football crazed area like Atlanta.\n\nOverall: Free Sunday parking, no wait, cute waitress, above average food, lots of beer, tons of football to watch and enjoy.  Would consider coming back when my baseball travels bring me back out to Phoenix for a Dbacks game or more Fall League.  I want people to ring the bell and scream BIG UNIT for when I tackle that giant hot dog.", "business_id": "oCA2OZcd_Jo_ggVmUx3WVw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-11-17", "type": "review"}

Limp lettuce with some canned mandarin oranges thrown on top and chicken that was cooked in the worst sauce, also strewn about and finally topped with way too much sesame dressing.

Alice Cooperstown makes no attempt to be anything besides it's namesake. This is a place that is all about music, beer, and bar food across from a stadium. We arrived and sat outside while we waited to order. I decided to go all out and order the \"Adam Richman's\" Bases Loaded  Big Unit hot dog. This rediculous hot dog was a 22inch Vienna Beef dog loaded up with their \"nightmare\" chili, bacon, cheese sauce, sauerkraut, jalapenos, tomatoes, onions, relish, cheddar cheese, and a boatload of fries. A short while later the unreasonalby large dish arrived at our table. \n\nThis is a true foodventure statement. I do not like hot dogs. But for the love of eating and the spirit of the list, I dove right in. I will say that this was a hot dog made with good meat though after 4 bites I was pretty much over it. The toppings were intense, it was really just everything possible piled high on the dog. As you obviously determined this was a knife and fork affair and it took some time. About half way through I hit something I had never hit before, the dreaded food wall. It was time to buckle down and make this happen. It took everything I had to go bite by bite but with the cheers of Keith and Michelle, I reached my final bites. After what I would say was a half hour I downed the final bite and stood up victorious!\n\nOur time at Alice Cooperstown was fun and stomach busting but not necessarily a place I would frequent if I lived in Phoenix.

It's a delicate balance that's hard to explain to someone that hasn't eaten one. Some prefer their sandwich on a bagel, others on a croissant. In my last years of Manhattan life I leaned towards toast. So when my eyes feasted on a menu item called \"The Patriot\" I paused.\n\nCrispy Bacon? Ok!\nFried Egg? Ok!\nMelted CHEESE? OK!\nON TOAST? Alright! \n\nLet's try that!\n\nI was hopeful but figured \"Meh\". I was at a sports bar after all on a Sunday. At worst bacon was involved. Out came a heavenly surprise of gooeyness that pleased my palate. I almost wished I had a hangover to test this puppy out. (Bacon, egg and cheese had in my city living rescued me more than a few times.) But, no. I highly recommend this breakfast delight. AND it's beyond reasonably priced! ($4.99)\n\nI visited this bar/restaurant with a group of eight to watch football on a Sunday. There were quite a number of televisions. (In fact, I hadn't realized there were TVs above me.). It's also a really neat place if you're a fan of, obviously, Alice Cooper. The memorabilia covers almost every inch of the walls. I'd recommend enough time to peruse.   \n\nAlthough the food was far beyond what I expected I can't grant more stars. Our service was not ideal. It was rather difficult to obtain any service. (At one point we were flagging down our server as though we were waiving in an airplane.) We did have a reprieve when a gentlemen stepped in who was quite knowledgeable about cocktails. I wish *he* had been our server.\n\nI found it strange given that the restaurant wasn't crowded at 10:30am (yet). Had there been a packed joint - sure - I get it. Also, our table wasn't bussed unless we would ask for plates to be taken away. (And some plates were left to die. Perhaps to compost. We never asked for those to be picked up soooo....) When people order coffee bring them creamer. (Or ask if they want some.) Another example of a service gap: If one person places a food order it would be nice, just as a suggestion, to ask the rest of the table if they're interested in placing a food order. \n\nThere was one other TERRIBLE thing worth noting. \nAs such, I've left this at the end of the review. PARKING.  The following is just an FYI. The lot out back is NOT owned by the restaurant. (I inquired on the way out.) I think this is important however as there's no differentiation to a consumer when you arrive to the restaurant. \n\nMy experience parking was so heinous I filled a BBB complaint. (Yeah, *that* bad.) And I devoted a Yelp review to it as well (here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/arena-park-place-l-p-phoenix#hrid:yi7CY8WilX73OYj7Tl6YjQ) If I had a choice I wouldn't park here.

Respectfully named after the now-retired, 6'10\" Arizona Diamondback, Randy \"The Big Unit\" Johnson, this dog headlines.  At $19.99, it seems a bit steep, but I couldn't eat more than a third.  Along with the fries, it easily feeds two or three.  Divided, the cost is more than reasonable.\n\nThe \"Elaine Benes\" Big Salad, the \"Johnny 'Beef' Depp\", the \"Al McCoy\" [\"The Voice of the Suns\" since 1972] Crispy Chicken Salad, the \"John O'Hurley\" [\"Seinfeld's\" J. Peterman] Buffalo Chicken Wrap: the menu items definitely hail celebrity.  But why not?  The fare--along this guitar-lined, autograph-infused, rock-n-roll museum--is meant to be fun.  And it is.  Even though, on this evening, the locals were instead supporting their beloved Suns, I had a great time with my friends.  Cooper'stown is worth a try.\n\nI will say that it's an interesting touch that the servers and bartenders should adopt the Cooper-esque eye make-up--it's cool--but our server wasn't enthused: his bother-me-not attitude and poor service had me questioning his allegiance.  I mean, you work at Cooper'stown!  I know that between two servers and four tables, feeling as though you're in the weeds at times is natural, but couldn't you at least \"feign\" appreciation and interest?  The manager, however, checked-in on us, refilled our drinks, and asked about our visit.  I think he's quite aware.\n\n\nNote to Mr. Cooper:  \n\nWhen I was a kid, Alice Cooper album covers completely unnerved--yet intrigued--me.  I was ten, and I remember visiting our neighbors--hard rockers to the core--who had many of your LP's resting against their metal-plated, knob-heavy component stereo system in their living room.  I would walk around their house pretending I was cool and ignoring--or at least attempting to ignore--your nightmare: I couldn't look you in the eye.  At Cooper'stown, however, upon the slightest chance that you might drop in, I'd kept an eye out...just in case!  I'm not afraid anymore...I don't think.   =]   Nevertheless, for your music, your vision, and your endeavors, I'm a fan.  And I thank you.", "business_id": "oCA2OZcd_Jo_ggVmUx3WVw", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-11-04", "type": "review"}

A few blocks off the usual beaten path, surroundings became a bit dodgy and my friend suggested we turn back. We noticed a cool old building that had a painting of Alice Cooper on its side ... we figured \"what the heck\" and went in.\n\nThe industrial surroundings were bedecked with large screen televisions. The staff was incredibly welcoming and helpful. Photos and posters featuring many rock musicians were on the walls - some were autographed. The music from the large bar area made me think of crazy days - lots of Twisted Sister, Queen and, of course, Alice Cooper. Our fellow diners ranged from red-state tourists to people fresh from hair band rehearsals - it was a great mix for people watching.\n\nSomeone at the next table recommended both the meatloaf and the ribs - we got an order of each. The meatloaf was juicy and spicy, specked with veggies and with a cripsy top. The ribs were tender and tangy - cooked St Louis style. The mashed potatoes included the skins and the veggies were buttery and crisp.\n\nUntil we chanced upon Cooperstown, I was convinced there wasn't any good food in downtown Phoenix.

I will never recommend anyone there. That issue could've been handled if they had sought to remove the lady long before she had made a mess of herself and my evening.

I have noticed that a lot of these places seem to be great concepts that serve not so great food. Take the menu of Planet Hollywood for instance, which is only a parsley flake away from being overpriced TV dinners. I guess when you can eat your food in the same room with the crucifix from the original Exorcist film or Arnold's Terminator suit why complain though, right? I do admit to quite enjoying the food at all the Hard Rocks I have been to. Current count, I think 3 or 4. I'm simple. Any place that cooks my burger right gets a standing ovation from me. Somewhere between Planet Hollywood and the Hard Rock Cafe is Cooperstown, a mash up of a sports bar and a rock memorabilia joint owned by Alice Cooper.\n\nI usually like to hit places like this a few times before speaking up but truthfully it's doubtful that I will be going back. I love the idea of this place. The service was attentive. It has a cool vibe. I take big stock in the small details though. In between beers I like to drink some water but the water was from the sewer, so a strike there. I mean, come on. Alice Cooper can't afford to have a filter? This made me glad they carry some cool micro brews. I tried something on draft called Odell Cut Throat Porter. Cool name. Even cooler taste. I'm a porter/stout guy.\n\nThe menu spans the usual for these type of places. Little bit of everything. They have cool names for their food like \"Iron Man\" nachos and \"Bernie\" Mac and Cheese. First things first, I had to try the \"Nightmare\" chili. I'm a chili nut. If a place \nserves it, I have to order it. It's a law. The bowl was on the small side but the chili was halfway decent. Nothing that made my nipples pop though. Being a carnivore of the highest order I was drawn to something called the Mike Myers \"Yeah Baby.\" Pork loin, brisket, turkey, beef hot link with barbecue sauce on a hoagie roll. For the description and price, 17 bucks!, the sandwich seemed kind of skimpy. The next morning I was actually thanking Alice's restaurant for this though. Still, for being a little pricey I noticed the portions and sandwiches being served around us seemed a bit underwhelming.\n\nI guess the big draw is a nearly 2 foot long hot dog called the \"Big Unit.\" We saw a couple of people order this and while it looked fun from another table I can only imagine how badly this would hurt the next day. A 22 dollar hot dog hardly sounds appetizing enough to be worth the agony. It's a hot dog, people!\n\nThe concept of Cooperstown is a good one. It's more of a tourist trip though. The food was okay but not worth the drive into downtown Phoenix and the hassle dealing with the parking. It was cool checking out all the stuff after we ate though. \n\nWe hit it on a week night and the place was sparsely attended. Probably more of a weekend happening and especially when there are games, as it's within walking distance of the stadium. As restaurants go, it's cool to say that I ate there but I wouldn't go back. Way too many other restaurants that are better and more convenient for me to hit up.", "business_id": "oCA2OZcd_Jo_ggVmUx3WVw", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-09-21", "type": "review"}

Either really good or really bad!  \n\nAfter scanning the menu, my daughter and I both decided to try BBQ sandwiches.  She got the Pulled Pork and I couldn't decide between chicken and beef.  Waitress said not the beef since it's unreliable and when it's bad it's really bad..... okkkaaaayyyy.  Opted for the chicken and added cheese after her recommendation and ordered my sides.  Waitress then asks me if I have any problem with bones since they often leave some small bones in on accident.  Gross!  I changed my order to a bacon cheeseburger... at $12 it better be good!  We also ordered some cheese fries to start since we were starving!\n\nFries came and they had chili on it so they were returned and the waitress apologized... No biggie.  Cheese fries finally came out and they were delicious!  A few different types of cheese on top, good crispy fries underneath.  Honestly some of the best cheese fries I've ever had!  \n\nFood came and burger was small and obviously a frozen patty.  Super disappointed they use a frozen burger patty because they charge way too much for it!  Bacon on the burger was delish though... Perfectly crispy and big pieces.  I ordered mashed potatoes and chili as my sides.  Chili was fine but not the best, I think it tasted a bit burnt so it could have been an old batch from yesterday or something.  Mashed potatoes were amazing!  Red skin potatoes and a good amount of richness in them.  \n\nI tried a bite of my daughters pulled pork sandwich and it was amazing!!  Really good BBQ sauce!  The BBQ might be what this place is known for, not sure.  \n\nWayyyyy overpriced on most of the food and the soft drinks were almost $3 each!!  WTF??  For a bar, these prices are outrageous!  \n\nAlso, the place seems really really really dirrty!  Like I am scared to know what behind the bar and kitchen looks like!  Don't touch the menus too much and definitely avoid the drink menu on the table... there are layers and layers of filth and stickiness that made me want to vomit.  \n\nI will be back at least once hoping to find some better food choices.  I am still a bit concerned over the dirty ness and the bones in the pulled chicken.  Seems more like an issue with bad management though.  A good manager would make a world of difference here.  \n\nBTW... Why are they closed on Sundays?  With football happening on Sunday and them having such a great bar with big TV's, I would think this would be a busy day for them!

Think Hard Rock plus ESPN Zone minus the corporate chain feel. They have a great patio/beer garden, open dining with a long bar and loft seating above.\n\nTIP: You're going to pay for parking. If you're able to grab street parking, then it's $3.00 for two hours. It's two hours max, so if you're planning on hanging out longer, the lot in the back is $5. On game days the lots fill up fast and cost more.\n\nOn my last trip, I met a friend for lunch. It was a non-game day Wednesday, so things were pretty quiet and we were seated right away. \n\nWe were both eyeing the Big Unit, but decided that 22 inches of hot dog was probably not a good idea. They have a basic Big Unit for $22 and a loaded one for about $27. They sound an alarm whenever anyone gets one, so it's pretty fun to watch others try to take the Big Unit down. Someday....someday....\n\nI opted for the Killer sandwich - hot corned beef, loads of sauerkraut, melting cheese and thousand island dressing served on toasted rye. So simple, yet so sublime. It was heavier on the sauerkraut than what I was used to, but the fresh bite of fermented cabbage was a nice contrast to the savory, salty goodness of the artery-blocking corned beef and cheese. I would not hesitate to order it again.\n\nMy friend ordered the Cuban sandwich. It was probably the tallest Cuban I've ever seen. He had to take some of the pork out just so he could eat it. It looked very good and he raved about it.\n\nYou get to pick two sides with your meal. We both went with fries and the nightmare Chili. The fries were excellent - better than expected. The chili was probably my least favorite part of the meal. I'll agree with one of the other reviewers in saying than it is just a touch too sweet. Anyway, when ordered as a side, you only get few spoonfuls so it's not a big deal...\n\nAs far as beverages go, they don't have a huge selection of local drafts, but they do have Four Peaks Kiltlifter, which is always a reliable go-to, especially for \"day drinking.\"\n\nAll in all, Alice Cooperstown is a great place with a ton of character and better than average bar food.

Mike, the bartender will woo you off your feet and create the most beautiful cocktails.\n\nYou're super, super close to US Airways (1 min walk) and Chase Field (10 min walk).

I was downtown for the Garth Brooks and it was expectably packed at Cooper'stown. The wait was about an hour, and the hostess was right on the money with that. The food was about average for the price, however the service let a lot to be desired. First the waitress accidently hit my wife in the face with the menu and just moved on. Then I was supposed to have two sides with my burger and they never came. When the food got there, I asked about my sides and was told they would be right out. After about a half hour of not seeing our server again it was time for the show so I had to get up to find our check. I again told the server that my sides never showed up, and was told that she was sorry but the good news for me was that it didn't effect the price. My thought was actually it does, because I was paying for them. She offered to get a manager, but it would take about 20 minutes for him to come over because he was helping behind the bar, because they were so busy. At that point we were over it so we just paid the full bill and headed out.\n\nAgain I understand that they were busy, but come on!!!! I know it's not the first time they have been busy, and that is just not how you take care of customers.

We will keep going back but I would love to see the owner or staff rake pride in the place. Also realize only 2 out of the 300 people are dancing to that country crap.

They weren't overtly alcoholic, but just spicier than other mimosas or bloody marys I've had.  As for the food, I came here for one thing.  A biscuit sandwich.  More specifically, the Big Jim.  Fried chicken, country gravy, bacon, and cheddar on a homemade biscuit.  Unreal.  The biscuit was flaky, buttery heaven.  The batter on the fried chicken was delicious and the gravy wonderfully hearty.  Easily the best biscuit sandwich I've had in the Phoenix area.  My girlfriend got the Andouille Scramble which was basically an omelette with andouille sausage, peppers and onions with a side of potatoes.  She saw how much I loved my biscuit so she added a biscuit with honey to her order and was equally impressed.\n\nWe so wanted to save room for the beignets, but we were stuffed.  Total for the two drinks, two entrees, the add-on biscuit, and tip came to about $40.  Had we done non-alcoholic drinks it would've been a little under $30.  Their ingredients are locally sourced so you pay a little bit of a premium for that.  But considering the quality of the food and the unique experience, it was money well spent.  Whatever you do, find a way somehow to include a biscuit in your meal here.", "business_id": "tb24fvNJfHhyKEXkKn12Xw", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-10-05", "type": "review"}

This tiny place packs a big punch.  The employees are super friendly and upbeat. There is a sense that they want you to have a great experience while you enjoy eating.  \nIt's got some super items on the menu and they are working on creating a full bar.  They have large multi seat tables that look similar to picnic tables outside under umbrellas so there is more seating of the weather is good.\nThere are several items on the menu I will return to try but on this particular trip, our first, we had the Holy Puerco & the Peanut butter Bacon Cheddar Burger.  Both were amazing.  I felt a bit like I was back in New Orleans with the fried cheddar grit cake, cracklins, & Crystal sauce.  Not to mention the burger reminds me of one of my favorite burger joints in NOLA, Yo Mama's Bar & Grill. They also have a Peanut butter Bacon burger.  \nI like the list they have on the wall behind the counter that names all the local businesses they purchase there produce, meat, and goods.  It shows the intent to buy local and support other local businesses.  \nI will be back, I witnesses the making and devouring of a sandwich named Big Jim, a fried chicken breast, country gravy, bacon & cheddar on a large homemade biscuit.  I have got to try that for myself.  So my recommendation to you is to go, eat, experience this little diner for yourselves.

With just a few counter seats inside the trailer that houses this diner-style joint, you may want to order through the window and post up at one of the many outdoor tables, especially if you're with a group. Try a cocktail to start while you wait for your order - they're strong but delicious, typically served in mason jars or goblets, which matches the laid back vibe of the place. \n\nThere are a number of great dishes here, but among the best are the Fried Green Tomato sandwich and the poutine. The tomatoes are perfectly fried, light and crispy, with greasy flavor enhanced by the slightly sweet zest of corn relish and the subtle heat of chipotle sauce. Served on toasted local bread, it's got just the right amount of crunch and flavor. Plus, it's unlike any sandwich you'll see on other menus around town. The poutine is also a must-try. Served with country-style gravy and perfectly distributed melted cheese on top of thin, crispy fries, it's not a traditional poutine but one of the most delicious versions in the Valley. If gravy's not your thing, the fries are just as delicious on their own. \n\nOther highlights include the fried chicken sandwiches, which come in a number of variations featuring ingredients like honey, country gravy, and buffalo sauce. Although the biscuits they're served atop can be a bit dense, the chicken is perfectly moist and flavorful and never too greasy. The side of watermelon completes this southern-themed dish. And, if you're a burger lover, try one here. The meat is well-cooked with great flavor and the patties are perfectly portioned. \n\nThe service at Welcome Diner is casual but friendly and efficient. You'll get real attentiveness at the counter and maybe some small talk. Don't expect anything too formal - this is definitely a neighborhood joint, but you can tell the staff takes pride in their place of employment. And why wouldn't they?

It is completely in the middle of no where ... and in fact, for a minute or two as we were driving down Roosevelt St, we really thought that Siri was getting us lost. We got to the diner at the perfect time, however, because they were just turning on the lights and the small outdoor restaurant space was illuminated, making for a perfect setting to enjoy a Saturday night meal.\n\nAs far as the food goes, I left thinking, \"yes, fried chicken, absolutely delicious ... Everything else? Well, it was just alright.\"\n\nWe ordered two Hurricanes for drinks and a Bumblebee, a Big Jim, and the Poutine Fries for our meal. It was still happy hour (goes from 3p-7p ... pleasantly surprised that it was also on a Saturday), so the Hurricanes and Poutine Fries were $6 each (instead of regular price, $8). The Hurricanes were tasty but after a few sips, it kind of tasted like orange juice & liquor (not complaining, just saying it wasn't anything fancy). The Poutine Fries, in my opinion, had too much gravy but my date enjoyed them. I kind of wish we would've just gotten a plate of their regular fries because the fries themselves were really good. Their sandwiches were of course huge, very messy, and a little difficult to eat, but the fried chicken with the honey on the Bumblebee was so tasty, it was worth it. I removed the chicken off the biscuits and the biscuits were ignored; also, I thought that the honey mustard was unnecessary and I'm not a huge fan of pickles so I picked those off too. I'd say that I really wouldn't mind just ordering fried chicken and honey next time if/when we go back. My date enjoyed the Big Jim.

After a while though, I could feel that what I had eaten was way too heavy.

My friend and I walked over on First Friday after a guy recommended it to us and described it as a place with great \"comfort food.\" It's a few blocks from the more populated, business portion of Roosevelt. Since we were walking at night, it was a little sketchy given it was dark and there were barely any street lights. But the food and service were well worth the 5 minute creepy walk. Plus it made it more of an adventure ;)\n\nThis places feels like an outdoor diner, located on a residential block. You order your food at a window and then find a seat outside in the cute little lot. Despite the fact it was First Friday, the wait wasn't long at all. I think this is because, as I mentioned, it's a bit off the main strip of Roosevelt. We were able to easily find a comfortable place to sit and the service was great. I loved how patient the woman taking our order was and her enthusiasm describing their menu :) There's nothing worse than when you're excited to try a new place and the service is lackluster. This woman took her time and even checked on us later once our food arrived.\n\nI tried the crunchy peanut butter, bacon burger with pickles and cheddar cheese. I know, right?! Sounds crazy! It was highly recommended by the person in front of me in line. And just way too weird for me to not try ---and man, am I glad I did! It was SO GOOD! The flavors actually really complimented each other, especially the saltiness of the peanut butter/bacon and sweetness of the peanut butter/pickles. The bun was also fantastic and fresh.

We came for some passable late night grub. Instead we got kickass grub and some really nice drinks.\n\nOf course we come on a Tuesday - clearly the best day because it was happy hour all day. Between my group we had a Hurricane, Gin and Tonic, Whiskey Sour, a Little Birdy, and an order of Poutine.\n\nHappy hour drinks at $5-6, you don't expect much. But these staples actually hold their own against bars that would sell theirs for $10+. The gin and tonic was refreshing with the addition of lime juice. The Whiskey Sour had a nice balanced tart flavor from the fruit. And the Hurricane was basically alcoholic juicy goodness.\n\nFrom the food, literally comfort food at its finest. The Little Birdy - that in house biscuit, plus that awesome succulent fried chicken and slice of cheese - some of the best $5 I've ever spent. And the Poutine is glorious. Probably some of the most conservative, it's close to the traditional sense of just gravy and cheese, but they opt to use a peppery country style gravy and cheddar cheese. It's makes you feel a little worse and better at the same time.\n\nThe fact that this place is basically in the middle of a sketchy neighborhood actually added to the appeal for me.

Tits everywhere... and shit, that's just the male patrons, holmes. I was wearing all black (as usual) and put on my sunglasses for the lulz now and then, and my exceptionally skinny and lovely companion was paying with a stack $1's that she won in a dice game the night before... so the ladies and waitress probably figured that she was a stripper (she's actually an RN in an ICU) and that I was her coke dealer, and the guys were jealous that I was hanging with a hot babe whom I didn't have to pay for attention. So I guess that made me by default the coolest motherfucker in the place.

He might have jumped the border last week.\n\nPCC - White haired, super thin, wrinkly cracker who probably wandered in from the Phoenix Country Club across the street, in shorts, white polo, knee high white socks, and of course velcro sneakers. He looked reminiscent of a corpse.... except when he got several dances from well endowed black women, at which point he really became alive. \n\nShort Dick Man - He had clearly sprouted some wood, and it wasn't very impressive. \n\nVatos - galore.\n\nSo - think dive bar that is totally ghetto fab. If you wait around long enough, they'll have 2 for 1 drink specials, though I am sure that the \"grey goose\" I ordered was some shitty well shit and not the goose.

Nothing, and I mean NOTHING is as bad as this club. \n\nThe New York City bouncer out front was a nice guy, and thats where it stopped. The girls here are downright disgusting. These girls don't even look good enough to work the counter at MVD. The place is also crawling with undesirables at all times of the day and night. Their drinks are about $7 for a captain and coke, there were no girls dancing when we were there, the three girls who were working were basically asking if we wanted dances and when I said no, then rolled their eyes and walked away. Well, maybe these girls could dance on stage and THEN ask for a private dance... I want to see what you're made of first.\n\nThe dress code out front, the disgusting women, the attitude from bartenders, and the overall grossness of this place earn it a one star.

Sales Basics 101: Always Be Closing, right?\n\nNone of us partook in the festivities, but two friends in an adjoining party did.  One, quite simply because he was bored and someone paid for it.  The other, a recent migrant from war-torn and fundamentalist Afghanistan, got one of the [few] Barbie-esque dancers who would keep him entranced and occupied for 4-5 songs... and about $100.\n\nAfter a quick 30 minutes, we'd thought we'd seen the whole rotation of \"meh\" talent and skeevy behavior.

The Desert Botanical Garden provides a calm getaway from the hustle and bustle of the surrounding area. It's nice to visit during the day and browse several different exhibits throughout the park. However, my favorite part of the Desert Botanical Garden is that they offer a wide variety of lovely events throughout the year. In the fall, they host events like Beer in the Garden and Music in the Garden. In the winter, they host their well-known holiday event, Luminaris and in the spring they host a variety of Jazz in the Garden nights. Every event they organize is done well and provides a perfect evening out. \n\nIn addition to their wonderful events, I also really love their butterfly exhibit. The butterfly exhibit is charming and sweet. Plus, if you're lucky, you just might visit during a time when they are letting Monarchs loose in the exhibit and you might just get to let one free (hint: go in October). \n\nDBG is one of those places in the Valley that can easily be forgotten by locals but the grounds are beautiful and the events are a perfect activity!", "business_id": "qMkIbQFrROSnPaQ7at85-w", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-10-15", "type": "review"}

If I lived in Phoenix, I'd be a member and a volunteer!!! :)\n\nAfter a full day of eating from the day before, I wanted to do a non food outing. My friend suggested the Botanical Garden which was a 30 minute drive from her place in Scottsdale. The parking lot was packed when we arrived at 930am. My friend was shocked at how crowded it was considering the past few times she'd been here, there'd been plenty of parking spots.  We eventually found a spot by following a couple who were walking back to their car. FYI parking is free but in cases where the parking lot is completely full you may have to wait it out OR possibly forgo visiting the Garden since the parking lot is the only place to park your car--there aren't any side streets to park on. \n\nAs we stood in line to purchase our tickets, surrounded by families with young children, we found out why it was so crazy busy:  the Garden was hosting \"The Great Pumpkin Festival\" which happened to be the same exact weekend we were at the Garden. This Festival offered plenty of activities for families: a hayride; pumpkin carving and decorating; a hay maze; a petting zoo; carnival games; and a free pumpkin for every child under 12.  How cute is that!!!\n\nAdmission for adults is $18. My friend had a 50% groupon for herself so her ticket was $9. A random guy came up to us and asked if we wanted his extra coupon that he and his family weren't using. I gladly accepted and once we got to the counter, my admission was free AND I also had FREE access to the butterfly exhibit which wasn't included in my friend's groupon deal. However the admissions guy ended up giving us 2 butterfly admission stickers--1 for me and 1 for my friend. Thanks random guy  & admissions guy for being nice and generous!!  \n\nOff we went to explore the Botanical Garden. My 4 favorite things during my visit:\n1) The Chocolate Flower: no joke this is a flower that smells exactly like chocolate; how did I not know about this?!  \n2) Upon walking further we approached some cacti that were enormously tall; think sequoia tree height (ok I exaggerate, but these cacti were the tallest I've ever seen). I was in awe.\n3) The random tidbits and interactive displays that provide useful information as to what you're seeing or the history behind it. \n4) The layout of the Garden was easy to follow and made it easy to not really miss anything. Upon entering the Garden there's main trail that loops around, but along the main trail there are 4 sub-trails that will loop you back where you turned off of the main trail. My favorite trail was the \"Plants & People of the Sonoran Desert Loop Trail.\" \n\nThe weather was warm but bearable. Bring bottled water, sunglasses, hats, and comfortable shoes since there's hardly any shade and most of the trails are dirt trails. We arrived at 9:30am and managed to see most of the Garden, including the Butterfly exhibit, by 11am. \n\nI absolutely loved visiting this place and wouldn't mind going again especially to the various events they host throughout the year...just another reason to re-visit Phoenix!!! :)", "business_id": "qMkIbQFrROSnPaQ7at85-w", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-11-04", "type": "review"}

Be prepared to see wildlife in their natural habitat- we've seen snakes, lizards, hummingbirds, lots of insects, rabbits, and other critters.

The best part was sipping rum cider while walking arm in arm with hubby throughout the various bends of the garden.  This event has now become a family tradition.  We missed it last year because we waited till the last minute to get our tickets and they were SOLD OUT! This year, we secured our tickets early.  \n\nLas Noches de las Luminarias is very popular and known world wide.  It runs from the day after Thanksgiving and ends on December 23rd.

I brought my family for this recent excursion.  First, we brought my 7 y/o daughter for their sponsored pumpkin ride and picking, which was a bit of a let down. The ride was advertised as a hay ride, but there was no hay to be seen. It was a bit too long, and the pumpkin patch consisted of pre picked pumpkins naturally from a cooler state! Coming from New Jersey, pumpkin hay rides locally are much cooler, but what can you do, this was the best AZ's harsh arid climate has to offer. The local kids were havign a blast, and I understand why.  My daughter thought it was dumb to be honest, as did we, but we all managed to have a bit of fun with it. \n\n  Onto the actual B.G.s. They were terrific, albeit hot as Hades. It was in the mid '80s the day we were there, and it felt like triple digits to us Yankees lol.  My lips were chapped as all hell after a few hours walking about, it blew my mind. The ground heats up in excess of 10 to 20 degrees in excess of the air temperature on any given day at the gardens. Bare that in mind when visiting. The admission price was reasonable. There is terrain consisting of novice to moderate grades of walking. Other areas are paved and consist of very mild walks, leisure and enjoyable.  The latest glass cactus additions were marvelous. Coming from outside the Southwestern USA, it is a must see experience, to walk amongst the natural beauty that consists of the deserts of Arizona. \n\n  There is plenty of free parking. Since my first and last visit there in 2009, the park has added an upscale gift shop and restaurant. I kid you not, the restaurant was five stars in itself! Offering cooked per order, organic dishes and drinks. It was so refreshing and tasty after hours in the blazing hot sun. A bit pricey but well worth it, my family and I concluded. Prompt and curtious service included. The gift shop is a bit of a tourist trap today, offering an array of tacky to note worthy items, all at tourist based prices! Try the homemade lemonade, AMAZING!!!!! Made with hers grown right  from the premises. If time permits on your travels to Phoenix, this is a worthy addition to your sight seeing adventures.

It is quite beautiful inside the unique botanical garden focusing on local desert flora. Lots of placards abound to tell you the different names of the cacti, aloe, and agave. There are probably 5 sections to the gardens that take about 5 minutes or each to walk around the walkway loop. One focuses on I believe on hummingbirds so the plants attract a good amount of hummingbirds if you have the patience to watch for them. I thought that for the admission price, what you got what pretty fair. The grounds are immaculate, though perhaps smaller than I expected. Staff are friendly. Since it is an outdoor tourist attraction on essentially the surface of the sun, staff on golf carts run around hydrating tourists who will certainly not be prepared for such oven heat. \n\nThe Chihuly addition to the gardens I have mixed feelings. On the one hand, it adds some pizzazz to the grounds. On the other, it looks sort of forced, out of place, and more of a PR stunt to get tourists to come. Especially the glass swans in the small lake....I couldn't get down with that.\n\nCan spend as little as 30min here and as much an 1 hour. Make sure to take a break from the heat at some point.

Nope, I haven't missed anything. Second visit was as underwhelming. I bet most of these reviews are from people who DON'T live in Arizona but live somewhere else with real green landscapes so when they see desert landscapes they are like wow this is amazing. I can't emphasize this enough, there is NOTHING to see here if you live in Arizona. Nothing. Pretty much all of this desert landscaping is everywhere around you.

Sure you can find these plants right out side this place, but it definitely won't be very well organized, nicely landscaped and put together like here. Even if it were $20,  it won't bust my bank account.  They do let all military members in for free which is a bonus.  \nAs a big cactus lover,  I enjoyed this place,  they offer tours, also there's audio tours. There will be alot of walking,  which I was very pleased. So if you have children,  bring a stroller or a little wagon,  there's alot of walking. I loved how all the plants were nicely organized and labeled.  There were some amazingly huge and wierd looking cactuses I have never seen before.  The gift shop was great,  some items a little pricey, but you can also find some affordable items as well.  I didn't go to the restaurant, but I assumed it was a little pricey and simplistic with food choices as to be expected.  In this park, you'll find plenty of photo opportunities. I enjoyed every minute and I highly recommend that you check it out if you are actually into cactuses/succulents. Parking is great,  no problem finding parking.  Customer service was great.  If you go on a hot day,  make sure you bring plenty of water,  I had to refill my bottle 4 times.  You get a good amount of walking exercise,  plenty of visual stimulation, and capture glimpses of the wildlife.  This is the best desert botanical garden I have gone. It's no wonder it's  $20, the place has to maintain and keep thier botanical garden nice and It costs money to make it look this awesome. So if you're a cheap skate,  go take a trip to one of the places that one of these guys gave for thier 1-2 star review and enjoy seeing less than half of the plants you'll see on the outside. P.s. if you are expecting to see tulips or daisies,  you won't see them,  pay attention to the name,  there are mostly cactuses/succulents in this place.  You have been fore -warned.

We had already been to Carly's, Lucky Strike, Roosevelt, Bikini, Paisley Violin, and Lost Leaf. It was a perfectly fine drunken evening. Riding by District, I said hi to three women smoking on the patio. They said hi back, and I thought that was it. 1/2 block later, I look back and my friend is not anywhere to be seen. He made convo with the three, and scored one of their numbers. SWEET! Well, an hour of talking to them and he had an open invitation for us to join them for Chris Isakk... I wasn't feeling it though. It's just Chris Isakk, and I can't drive, and the train doesn't go there, and a taxi costs too much.... the only option is to bike! it's almost four miles!! So we biked, and biked, and biked. \n\nFinally, after the most awkwardly drunken bike ride down roosevelt for several miles, we arrived to a full parking lot and no idea where to go or how to get in. This place has no signage about which entrance is what. I go to lock my bike to a fence and the girl at the door says I cannot do that here. When I asked where I could lock it up, she replied \"sir, I make $5.75 an hour.\" Ok, cool, but where can I lock my bike up? She said I could lock it to a light pole, so I started to do that, then she said \"not that light pole sir. I make $5.75 an hour please don't make my job hard.\" I don't care how much you make. This wen't on for 10 minutes. Then trying to get into the place was next to impossible. We couldn't get close enough to the door to exchange tickets with our contact, and she couldn't go out the door because they have a no-reentry policy. Eventually some young girl with authority told us it was our lucky day and we could both go in for free... YESSSSSS! My sweet brunette savior. \n\nInside the venue, everything goes in a circle, and is very intimate. There really isn't a bad seat in the house. The stage rotates so everyone gets a good view for half the show. They have plenty of concession stands, and $7 a beer is at least better than Chase Field, US Airways Center, or Dodge. The ride back home consisted of singing Chris Isakk songs and screaming and yelling all the way down Washington back downtown.

If I didn't work in the building across the street I doubt I would have ever gone into this corner building, strip mall, dive bar unless something horrific was happening in the world, such as the zombie apocalypse, one in which I'm being chased by a hoard and my only salvation is to enter a dive bar where, more than likely, the servers will also be zombies and I'll be fucked pretty bad. \n\nThat said, the place kind of smells like musk and sadness and the two or three middle aged servers look like they've lived a lot of life.  There are always a few hunched over dudes at the bar, watching sports or maybe counting their misfortunes.  One server appears to have always just had something weird or traumatic happen to her before she takes our order, like she was just bitching at SRP for shutting her power off or she just found out her teenage son got arrested on drug charges- then she comes to take our order.  While the service has never been despicable, we always have to wait an unnecessary amount of time for our tab, which sucks since we're anxious to get back to our meaningless jobs.\n\nShe also asks us \"what flavor\" of beer we want, which confused me since, like, Blue Moon is not exactly a \"flavor\" as much it is, you know, a brand.  But I can look past this.  \n\nI've eaten a few things here and the worst and most unacceptable was a simple dinner salad which was literally wilted Iceburg, bag lettuce with an obscene amount of dressing.  I can only assume that they thought if they covered the wilted lettuce with enough fatty Ranch I wouldn't notice the lettuce was bad.  I did, but I didn't send it back, instead I ate it and drank beer and talked about how much better the director's cut of Bladerunner is. \n\nThe wings are mediocre, not crispy enough for me to say they're cooked well, not thick enough to call them plump, and not tasty enough to assume that the sauce is anything more than some Frank's Red Hot concoction with some added butter or someshit.\n\nI've also had the pleasure of the chicken \"fritters\" which are, you know, frozen chicken strips deep fried.  I order these most times I come here because they can't really fuck it up and you can't exactly go wrong with chicken strips.  I've also ordered the \"fire\" fries which are just their fries with Cayenne pepper on them, and they charge another 1.50 for this. \n\nWhat IS worth the trip across the way and the shady, low brow atmosphere are the two dollar burgers on Tuesdays.  I actually never order the burgers only because I'm not much of a burger person, but my regular co-workers tell me they're tasty, a cut above a fast food burger and cheaper.  (Though, consider that you're also leaving a tip for the service, not getting fries, and paying extra for cheese, so it's not THAT much of a better deal than fast food, just sayin'.) \n\nWhat I can't look past, why Dirty Drummer is only getting two stars, is the fact that the only reason we came here; the five dollar pitchers of domestics, are now, for some reason, NINE dollar pitchers which, needles to say, is absolutely not worth it, especially considering the skimpy size of the pitchers, the depressing atmosphere and the tore up servers.  After my co-worker noticed this new four dollar addition to the pitcher price he said, rather cleverly, \"looks like this is the last time we'll be drumming.\"\n\nAnd it was.", "business_id": "IgaruuknYwCr9afeDYQ_yw", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-11-23", "type": "review"}

No HH food specials, but they have domestic pints for $2.50 and a huge screen was playing the football game and other TV's had all the other games I needed. Quickly, I learned about the Drummer's signature burgers since I was sitting at the bar and the grill (like in some older drugstores and Waffle House) is actually in the bar area (see photo). THis is great as I enjoy watching my food and others cook, but it also exposes some flaws if you know what to look for. Ok, the bugers are clearly not frozen here and are the best part of meal. They are fresh balls of 1/3 pound of ground beef and chef throws it on grill and seasons it with some powder and then the signature move occurs about 10 minutes into cooking - red wine is poured onto the burger while cooking, producing some sexy steam. About 1/2 cup of wine is loaded on the burger (($6.95 with cheese, $2.95 on Tuesday) and then I went with swiss and mushroms (.75 cents) for toppings. Ok, here are some flaws to ponder. The Buns are from Sara Lee, the fries and onion rings are dumped out from bags, the cheese is a generic slice and mushrooms are canned. If your gonna give me an incredible burger experience at least don't cut corners on all the extras which in my mind are all part of the deal. I realize this isn't a gourmet joint, so I cut some slack and the burger was very tasty and cooked well, but I didn't taste any of the wine (not sure if I was supposed too), but maybe the cheese overwhelmed the wine taste. Only one other place in the area uses wine according to the cook who has been there on and off for 20 years.

Yes some of the tvs are older and the spot has a feel like its stuck inthe 80s but thats ok. Great energy. They have regulars who have been coming since hte 80s and before. I even have sat next a man who is over 90 and still sits up at the bar. \n\nI know all the daily food specials. I think Thursday tacos are one of the most popular. wednesday is chicken sandwich. tuesday is burger. monday is chefs choice. friday is fish fry(the onlyone I've never had) .\n\nThey are know for their wings and I love them. I usually get bbq hot grilled. The hot is a mixture of franks red hot butter and maybesomething else. For me its too salty alone so the bbq offsets that. I prefer them grilled so I pay the extra dollar. Burgers are cooked made to order and are quite popular as well. They cook them with some house redwine and it adds falvor to it without being overpowering. \n\nThey have a about 6 or 7 beers on tap. Not quite as cold as Applebees draft beers but not bad. Quite a bit of bottled selection including some craft beer cans as well. Reasonably priced beers and liquor is pretty average price for the area. Very casual environment. Pool tables a about 10 tvs. Most are high def flatscreens but a few older rear projection widescreens as well.They do put the sound for the local games on weekends and during the week the jukebox plays through the speakers. \n\n\nOverall my great local dive bar anytime of day.", "business_id": "IgaruuknYwCr9afeDYQ_yw", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-09-19", "type": "review"}

Food-wise, the Shepard's Pie is large and delicious - the perfect comfort food to accompany that pint. The fish and chips is another favorite of mine - the generous fillet is cooked just to the right crispiness. \n\nThe atmosphere is the real fun though, if you're into the whole English pub vibe. The place oozes Britain - from the flag painted on the bathroom ceiling to the tube sign tables. Plus the owner, David, is actually from Britain and mingles with the customers as if he was welcoming him into his own home.

IF, and I mean IF, you are able to obtain one of the elusive drink menus you are in for a treat.\n\nGeorge and Dragon is really different than other local bars and pubs. It's owned by a true Brit with a real cockney accent and run by a bunch of tatted up punk rock looking girls. The contrast of the football flags and the Camden town style of the wait staff makes the atmosphere interesting. \n\nThere is a good crowd at the bar. Except for the usual few a-holes you find in every bar, The G & D is patronized by hipsters and business men alike. Families eating bangers and mash sit seats away from rowdy college kids. Stock brokers drink ale next to drunkards slamming whiskey and stylish career gals drinking cosmos. It's a unique mix rarely found in Arizona.\n\nThe food is pretty good too. English food is by definition terrible. I lived in Cambridge for a few months and found it hard to digest most traditional English fare, but G & D does a good mix of American classics and British favorites. Even the cold egg thing that my boyfriend loves (and I hate) seems to be a hit with most patrons.\n\nGeorge and Dragon is a great place to meet with friends, have happy hour with co-workers or sit alone and stew.

I was surprised that they were even open, and it was definitely slow because pretty much every server was standing outside smoking when we arrived. Not that I'm judging because as a former server, I can tell you that there's nothing worse than working a shift on a holiday, especially when it's more of a grilling-and-having-people-over type of holiday. \n\nAnyway, we sat in the bar area in one of the extraordinarily comfortable booths. The booth directly faced the bar and was much more inviting than the somewhat closed-off dining area on the right. To drink, I had a Bloody Mary. I was pleased that our server asked how spicy I wanted it (since that meant it would be made from scratch) and even more pleased when I tasted it and found it to be delicious. You could really taste all the individual ingredients, including the oft-neglected horseradish, and it really hit the spot after a long weekend of drinking. I also tried my aunt's Long Island, and it was really good and not too sweet. \n\nMy husband and I split the \"English Dip\" and the Philly cheese steak. Neither was particularly good. I think we both erred in not ordering British classics because my uncle's Shepherd Pie was at least hearty and sort of the quintessential comfort food. My aunt's fish and chips was also decent, although she said it wasn't nearly as good as Rosie McCaffey's. \n\nI am definitely not opposed to coming back here, especially for No Country Karaoke on Monday nights (does that mean I can't sing Martina McBride?). However, when I do return, I'm going to stick to drinking (I'll gladly have another of those Bloody Marys) and then after a few drinks, try one of the British pub dishes.

The roast beef was tender, the gravy was perfect and so were the mashed and fried potatoes. However, the Yorkshire Pudding was not good. It's supposed to be golden brown. Mine was very dark brown and burned black around the edges. Basically inedible although I tried. I ate the less burned bottom half, which tasted overcooked, a flavor that repeated on me for the next few hours. When I mentioned that it was overcooked to the waitress, she was very nice and offered to bring me a new one. Then she came back and told me that the kitchen said it was supposed to be that way and all the others looked like that, too. She offered to get a manager so I could discuss it with them. I declined since I have better things to do with my day off than argue that the kitchen should know how to cook the special properly. I did Google Yorkshire  Pudding and looked at all the images just to prove to myself that I was right about the golden brown they're supposed to be. I left very disappointed that my first taste of something I'd waited so long to try was so subpar. All in all, I give the Sunday roast special about a 50%.

Unfortunately tonight's visit was far from superb as we are used to. We walked in and requested a BOOTH for 5, we told there was another group ahead of us and it would be 10- 15 minutes. When our table was finally ready for us 15 minutes later, it was not a booth. I told her specifically ,\"I requested a booth not a table with chairs.\" She responded with, \" I was not aware of that request.\" So I told her, \"I refuse this table since I requested a booth.\" She again responds, \" you didnt say anything of that sort when you walked in.\" At this point my fiance chimes in with, \"Actually, he said a booth for 5 please?\" The hostess then tells us,\"This table is all we have for you at this time and to wait for a booth will be another 30 minutes.\" I told her, \"Fine then we will will wait.\" She got an attitude and began gathering all the napkins and flat ware that she just laid out at the table along with the menus. At this point I was furious, more so because I was getting the attitude from someone who obviously had no concern for my request and then got upset when I corrected her. I was so mad that I was ready to leave and go elsewhere and when I expressed that to her. She retorted \"Fine, go somewhere else and eat I don't care!\" After hearing her say that I asked to speak to the manager, she completely ignored me and walked away. Another employee gladly got the attention of the manager for me and when I expressed my disbelief and how I felt so disrespected to him. All I was told is, \"I will talk to her about this this.\"  I'm sorry but when people come into your establishment and no matter what the situation is, automatically spend $60 or more on food and drinks you should do everything in your power to make them feel at ease. We finally got our booth in a matter of minutes after talking to the manager. To put the icing on the cake, I noticed after that anyone requesting a booth after we were seated got one right away. This had me heated, then my fiance told me,\" You made a  complaint, so now she is gonna do everything to make sure she doesn't get another one tonight.\" \n\nTo say the least I hope the young lady has a much better night.

The staff, though, makes the brewhouse.\n\nSince it's a brewhouse, let's start with the beer. Sonora has a brew for nearly everybody. If you like it dark and heavy, there's usually a mix of stout, porter or barley wine. For the lighter folks, there's a very competent mix of hefeweizens and pale ales. For big beer flavors, there's usually an IPA. The best stuff, though, comes out of the cask. Cask-conditioned ales have an awesome flavor that allows the character of the hops to shine out. My main quibble with Sonora's cask selections is that they're too often of the pale variety. I'd love to see a stout or porter in the cask at least once a month. I would celebrate to see a Belgian trippel wind up on the menu, too.\n\nSonora also serves food. The cottage pie is tasty, as are the fish 'n' chips and homemade soups, and the nachos are a nice snack. The burgers, both the pub and Kobe varieties, depend greatly on how the person at the grill defines rare, medium and done well. Unfortunately, their definitions are often differerent from mine.\n\nThis brewpub also has a great atmosphere. Sit at the bar and chat with the other brew lovers. It's a friendly place, and you'll have fun conversations. They staff actually know their beers and have strong opinions. And they're just as friendly as the drinkers.

That's why this classy little beauty less than a mile away from our house was a definite must-try. Let me begin the review by letting you know, up front, that we really enjoyed everything about the place. Minimal complaints! \n\nWe visited Sonora on a Friday at around 7:00...there were a few parking spots left in what is really a very ample parking lot for downtown Phoenix. I mean, damn! There must be at least 20 spaces. I'm a worrier and I stress out about things like, \"WHERE WILL WE PARK?!\" before I go anywhere. I know...I know. So, I was pleased to see that I needn't have gifted myself with an ulcer over where we could park without getting towed or ending up on blocks. \n\nSonora Brewhouse is comprised of two buildings, joined by an outside dining area between them. The building you first walk into, (the older building, I perhaps incorrectly surmised), is small and was filled with many jovial patrons on our visit. We wouldn't have wanted to sit at the bar, but we couldn't have, anyway! It was completely full, as were almost all of the booths and tables. We made our way to the outside seating area, and were about to sit down when we noticed the second building...right on the other side of the outdoor seating. We ventured in, and it was much less full than the other building, but several times as noisy. Oh, well. We sat down and surveyed our new environs. \n\nI've read several reviews on here vaguely bashing the ambiance of the restaurant - I found nothing to complain about. Then again, I like faux exposed-brick walls and dark wood paneling. \"Duly noted.\" Alright, cool. Thanks. I also liked the kind of fun, amateurish canvas paintings of the images they pair with each of their beers that are strewn about said exposed-brick walls. Plasma TVs abound, which I hate, but I know people eat that technology crap up so I guess it's worth mentioning. \n\nOur waitress was just friendly enough, avoided all bitchiness, and was on top of things without being obnoxious. In other words, perfect. My boyfriend ordered the pale ale, (I think it's called The Stinger? Something like that?), and I, not a beer drinker in the slightest, decided to throw caution and personal preference to the wind and have a Vanilla Porter. Because, you know. It would taste like vanilla. And...vanilla is for girls. Like me. That don't drink beer. My boyfriend chuckled at this logic, and told me I wouldn't like it and that I didn't know what I was ordering. \n\n... \n\nYep. Just about right. As far as beer goes, I did like the kind of bitter and still beer-like hint of baked goods flavor, but it was not anything like I cluelessly imagined. I still drank it! My boyfriend really enjoyed his pale ale with no criticisms. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered the Tavern Steak with steamed vegetables and steak fries, and I ordered the Santa Fe Chicken Sandwich with the kettle chips/chipotle ketchup. We were both very pleased with our entrees...the jalapeno butter (?) on the steak is pretty tasty. As for the sandwich, I'll eat anything if it is slathered in guacamole. The steak fries were as good as steak fries ever are, and the kettle chips are as good as all of the other reviews have told you. I don't eat potato chips and I hate ketchup, but I loved the combination here. Fun tip: I tried putting some of the chipotle ketchup on my sandwich, and it tasted really gross. Maybe limit your use of the ketchup to its intended, menu-endorsed purpose. \n\nWhen we were done, we had no problem getting the bill, paying the bill, and getting out. The parking lot was completely full when we left, and there were two cars jockeying for our spot. That was probably around 8:00 - 8:30 PM, so if you're a damaged individual like me who finds cause to stress about parking, go earlier than that. \n\nThere were a lot of other options on the menu that sounded like they might be on the \"delicious\" side. If you are like us, and not into the drama-filled 20-something bar scene downtown, this might be a nice alternative. It's so close, and we were both really down with the experience...we will definitely be back.", "business_id": "3UMcsN9IjoeV8JZvC4apag", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-09-21", "type": "review"}

And then confusion...both of us looked at each other and said \"WTF???\"  Worst RB EVER!\n\nWhat the heck was in this drink that made it taste like ass?  We looked all over the menu and found nothing.  Then we saw the \"fine print\" on a small table sign...STEVIA.  It's made with Stevia NOT sugar...I'm sorry, but I have to say that this is the lame-est root beer on the planet.  If I'm going to treat myself to a big glass of homemade root beer, I want it to be delectable...sugar and all...no freaking high fructose corn syrup and no bloody artificial sugars (and yes, I know stevia is \"natural\" but who gives a crap...it tastes terrible anyway).\n\nAfter the root beer debacle, it didn't get better.  The food was meh...service was not so great (there were moments of \"is she ever coming back???\").  I'd say, go here for the beer, sans root, but that's about it.

Next time I'll take the extra 10 minutes to get to Four Peaks.\n\nAlso I noticed the menu was really, really random. They don't specialize in any particular type of food.

We'd all been wanting to try out the place and sample their brews for a while. We arrived, and were told to pick any seat we desired, so we grabbed a booth. The first thing I noticed was the interior, it was fairly small but in a good way, the ambience of the place has a classic southwestern feel to it; and not in the kitschy way that non natives might assume a \"sw\" theme should feel. Perusing the menu I noticed that the prices seemed a little higher than i'm used to for pub grub, but i'm sure the quality would be deserving. after a while of checking out their digs and studying over the menu and drink/food specials they had for weekends we opted to go for the \"order any regular appetizer and get you're first beer for $1\" deal. seems like a good deal right? Scott ordered the light rail cream ale, Justin ordered the IPA? i think and I got their Vanilla stout. They were all delicious. My stout was especially good as the vanilla taste was merely a mild hint which gave it a great background flavor and left a lingering sweetness that was refreshing rather than sickeningly fruity/sweet. It was a classic stout whose femme-y name belies it's body and drinkability; certainly not a lady drink imo. My compatriots order the light rail cream ale wings and i order the \"beer bread\" w/ queso dip. The appetizers were, decent. not bad but not great. The real reason to come here is the beer; despite the fact i didnt try any entrees, or their delicious sounding kobe beef burger- i'm gonna go ahead and stand by my sentiment. When our lackluster waitress finally returned i asked for MY bill, she returned after 15 min. or so with all of our checks on one tab, and she had overcharged us after we'd asked her if the weekend special (order any app and get 1st beer for $1) was still in effect, to which she'd said yes. To be fair i'm sure it was an honest mistake, and she was probably really busy....yada yada yada we asked her for our seperate checks and about the special one more time, she apologized and returned with our checks and cheaper tabs. So all in all i like SunUp brewery but i'd return solely for the brews and leaves the eats to some place more qualified for my refined tastebuds.", "business_id": "3UMcsN9IjoeV8JZvC4apag", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-10-11", "type": "review"}

Now fetching $14, I would think that one could expect an attempt for goodness.

You were a place to go for the best Kobe burger or English Style fish and chips in all of Down Town Phoenix.\n\nNow you are becoming a has-been, a place that if it weren't for the good brew, you would be just another forgettable restaurant.

Apparently there are two separate buildings.  We stayed in one, that had a small bar and about 12 tables.  I think there were 4 or 5 tv's with sports on.  The other building had a huge party.  We were able to pick where to sit and we chose a booth.  The server greeted us promptly, but when we asked about beer specials.

It was cooked to perfection and served with some crispy fries that were also very good. I have yet to be disappointed. \n\nMy friend had the club, and it is a giant sandwich and looked delicious. His only compliant was there isn't any \"regular\" white bread available to put it on.

As an avid drinker of the \"other\" brewery in Tempe's flagship beer, I am always looking for a red-type ale, which they have, but I find too hoppy. So I recently have had the Pale Ale, which has a good flavor, but once again I run into a hop issue.

For a moment I felt how Robert Smith must feel whenever he walks into a Hot Topic, or Hulk Hogan in a bandana wholesaler's. \n\nBut alas, like Torrid and Guitar Center, I inevitably showed up the same day as the token asshole employee whose brief interaction with me would ruin my view of this establishment for all time.\n\nWhile waiting for the show to commence, Fenyx and I went through the back door to take a smoke break, as were a lot of other people. The back door couldn't be shut all the way or it would lock, forcing you to either bang on it until someone heard you over the music or walk around to the other side. \n\nSo he and I are just standing around, smoking, talking, making sure nobody shuts the door, and out comes the DJ. He steps out, and before even lighting his cigarette, slams the door behind him.\n\n\"Awwww, man, now you've locked us out,\" we say, playfully.\n\nThe DJ stands over Fenyx, eyeballing him as he responds with \"Yeah, that's the point. To keep the undesirables out\" before walking off with his cigarette.\n\n\"What the hell just happened?\" I ask.\n\"He thinks we're a straight couple.\" \nI laughed. I searched for a pen. I'd been mistaken for a lot of things in the past, but this was the first time I'd been mistaken as straight. This had to be documented. Fenyx, who is also not straight, was not as amused.\n\nI tried to brush the comment aside and we went back inside, where the DJ proceeded to stare down my amigo and I from across the bar. \n\nI knew at any moment, a confrontation would escalate, and I was forced to choose between leaving early, missing the drag show, or watch the tension rise to eruption.

But if you go to this club, one piece of advice (Useful alert!): the less attractive dancers require money to leave with you. The self-possessed hotter ones do not. However, if you get her naked in your bed, do no verify pre-coitus that she is not, in fact, a prostitute, because she will leave and call you names as your front door slams behind her.

Honestly in general the food was OK but not great and nothing I'd drive out of my way for. I almost never consider service as part of my review since it varies all the time everywhere but in this case it sort of even lessened the experience so MUCH that I have to consider it otherwise I would have given Christo's three stars.\n\nOur waiter quickly greats us and ask if we want the menu or the restaurant week special. Despite being around 70 years old he was very quick talking and very speedy and sort of made us nervous but what really bothered me the most was him  and his helpers standing there not to far from us with his arms crossed just watching us like a hawk eating the whole time. \n\nNow the food.\n\nI started with a Christo's Caesar Salad. I could tell the dressing was house made as well as the croutons. The dressing wasn't properly emulsified nor was it balanced in flavors and was super heavy with lemon. The croutons were crisp and buttery. I pointed out the faults since I know them but it really was an OK salad. I do note I wasn't offered fresh ground pepper, nicer restaurants do offer fresh ground pepper for Caesar Salads.\n\nI was sort of excited to have the classic dish Sole Meuniere here. The Christo's Version is nontraditional as the fish seemed heavily coated (maybe battered not sure) with flour in a lemon white wine sauce in stead of a traditional lightly floured and prepared in browned butter. The fresh spinach on the side was just plain without anything on it. \n\nDesserts seemed house made and were OK. We both liked the lemon cake better over the mousse.\n\nA glass of house wine was included with our dinners and during the meal we finished it and my husband ordered another round. He noticed a price difference from the menu and questioned our server. The server confirmed it wasn't the same price as the menu and said that for restaurant week they up charge the wine. It was only a few dollars but I feel this is bad business and not good for customer relations.\n\nI was really torn between two and three stars but the surprise of the wine up charge, being really rushed though dinner and with the waiter and his help all standing across from us just watching us the whole time in a unprofessional way sort of spoiled the dining experience.\n\n2.5 Stars", "business_id": "3CSaqRNvYg7ZdN2zwxwzVw", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-09-28", "type": "review"}

Our server waited on them and brought out wines/drinks and salads to them before we had any items on our table.  This group behind us were definitely in \"party mode\" as they were getting louder and louder. After we finished our soup and salad, the noise level from that table was now at disaster level. We were not able to hear or speak to anyone at our table due to the noise. We asked to move and were seated in the bar area where it was much quieter.

Pretty disappointing for a hole in the wall bar on a Tuesday night. Next I went to Stella which was 4.50, also disappointing. Next, I struck paydirt when I got a can of PBR which was on special for 1.50. 1.50! There was a huge sign too! How did I miss that! I made sure to atone for my mistake by drinking as many as possible during the VHS or Beta performance.\n\nThe venue itself is not incredibly moving, but serviceable. Just a rectangular, closed off brick building painted black on the inside with no decorations other then some blue tube lighting around the bar and some broken down ceiling fans. I'm fine with a broken down old music venue for a show, but this place doesn't seem like it was ever much. I think they could do a little something to give it more character. \n\nAlso disappointing was the HUGE smoking patio which has no view of the inside and you can't bring a drink out. Why is this happening at places like here and the Lost Leaf?\n\nBut overall I still had a great time at the show and was very appreciative of the 1.50 PBR special.

Our night was not so hot.   Half of the bad that we caught wasn't worthy of stage time, the other half was.  The horn players were exceptional, the Keyboardist wasn't.  I'll stick to the facility.  The Rhythm Room is a Phoenix, classic on the music scene, or so I'm told.  This was evident when Paul Reed showed up with his horn and just joined the band on stage.  That was cool and made you feel like you were in the right place.  Beyond that, I'm can't really claim that this place is worth the time.  We'll have to try it again to confirm, yet my urge to do so isn't high right now.  The neighborhood is questionable.  The entrance is not obvious, the bar and the service are not inviting.  The music area of the building is excellent.  You sit very close to the band.  The one thing they need to fix within that is two sets of band doors would allow for a much faster setup/teardown between bands.  We waited for an hour between bands.  The Rhythm Room is missing an opportunity here, they need a comedian or something the fill the gap.  \n\nSome fresh eyes on how this place is run could really make some simple improvements.  Just because it's a known classic doesn't mean that it can't change for the better.  The one thing they have right is that the sound is good and if they're getting good bands, then it makes for a great night.

Just as we walked in, a drag show was ending, which was a treat.  Only wishing we had gotten there sooner, we sat down and ordered drinks.  I was amazed at the selection of flavored vodkas and other booze they have.  Not feeling too adventurous in that area I ordered a Ketel One Citroen on the rocks.  Generously poured, I don't remember the price, but I am sure it wasn't too steep.  As the night went on the place thinned out, and soon the wife and I were the only two people in the place.  The bartender, Anthony, was a joy to talk to.  We ended up just hanging with him until it was time to go.  I would go back just to have a bartender that good. Hell, the place is called Friends, and I'd be his friend any day. He was full of conversation and laughs.  At the end of the night, he called us a cab and made sure I didn't leave anything behind in my Ketel One haze.  He nearly had to come out to the parking lot to give me a record I left on the bar from a concert we attended earlier in the evening.\n\nThis place really is a comfortable and clean neighborhood bar that was welcoming to a random couple having a fun night on the town.

They pour rather freely, they have great 2 for 1 specials during the week, and the Buffalo Chicken Pizza is one of my favorite things to eat in town. \n\nOverall, Roscoe's isn't a place I would really go to just to hang out... kind of a sausage fest, even more so than most sports bars. They also have music playing over the sports, which is fine for most games but when it's a big game, the TV should take precedence.

There were probably 4 people at the bar, and 3 people in the game room playing pool.  They had the classic MLB game on, it was like Blue Jays and Astros, funny uniforms! It was maybe 2pm.  So the bartender says, What can I get for you?  My dumbazz says \"Can I see a menu\", this is where the music would have stopped.  WHOOPSY, there really isn't a menu, its kind of like a snack bar, where you look up, make your choice and its done.  Burger or Dog, Fries, Onion Rings or both!! DUH!  The bartender was nice though, I wanted draft the BF wanted bottle so he suggested I get a small pitcher, it's the cheapest way to go...SOLD! Don't have to pull my leg, thats for sure!  \n\nSo, I ordered the cheeseburger, and the BF orders the gigantic chili burger, which was reduced to the smaller one by recommendation of the friendly bartender. BF sort of put up a fight, but the bartender assured him it would be plenty and if not, the next one was on him.  This turned out to be plenty for him, and I was thankful too, we had a long night ahead of us.  Much to our surprise, although I'm not sure what else we were thinking, bartender grabs a handful of meat slaps it on the flat top smooshes it down, and thus our burgers were born and cooking.  I mean, for real?  Man it was soo good, greasy yes, but everything a burger should be!  The last bite of course was the best, it had me looking for my other half, since I always cut those suckers in half.  I don't eat burgers often, but I can't wait to take my dad here, I might have finally found one place in town he's never been too.\n\nWhile we were finishing up, a couple came in and sat next to us, who appeared to have just finished a golf game.  They ordered shots of Patron, I don't know how we got out without doing one with them.  The lady on the other side of us was getting her car washed next door so she said she comes in every time.

Well:\n\nI went here on an anthropological adventure. I'd heard the regulars were noteworthy in a Bikinesque fashion. That they're scary and funny and local and Cheersish... And that everything takes forever. And that everything is average but that it's the combination of the preceding factors that make this place worthy of one adventure to see how the other half live in their natural habitat.\n\nWe walked in and were IMMEDIATELY, like within seconds, greeted by a drunken song. A man and a song and a twinkle in his eye and I was immediately charmed. \n\nI was expecting it to smell very strong, especially since they sell cigarettes in the vending machines, but really there was no noteworthy odor. \n\nThe bartender was high or drunk. If she was not high or drunk, she's spent so much time in her life being either high or drunk that she now gives off a permadrunkenhigh vibe. For instance, she takes our drink orders and says, \"Want menus?\" and then walks away and re-asks us our order, which was a pitcher of beer. And then does not ever bring menus. Glazed eyes. I don't give a fuck ethos. \n\nAMF is on the menu, which I had to be reminded stands for adios mother fucker, which is just basically telling the drinker that this particular night will not be one they should bother trying to remember. Here, I could make some grand (albeit stupid) statement about how this is exactly the type of place people come to forget, but I don't think that's true considering I was the only one drinking them. \n\nThe one gentleman we interacted with was so desperately lonely that he clung to every vestige of a chance of an opportunity to insert himself in our convo and I felt deep sympathy for him. \n\nAll and all, I can't see any reason to ever go back but I'm glad I went and that it exists. It serves a need. It serves a population. It offers an opportunity for snobby a-holes to have a place to go on \"anthropological journeys.\" \n\nApparently, they put wine in their burgers if you're into that...", "business_id": "ntJAKLAq0cXzzdFgPoo0Iw", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-10-13", "type": "review"}

I'd been going there fairly regularly for something like 20 years.  The guy who started it (Harvey, I presume) ran it for around 40 years, until he died.  His daughter ran it for another five years (about) but decided running a dive bar wasn't what she wanted to do with her life and put it up for sale.\n\nIt was bought by a Vietnamese couple who upgraded the interior.  They added a bunch of big flat screen TVs, started taking credit cards.  The place used to be cash only, although they did put in an ATM a couple years back.\n\nHarvey's signature was the wineburger, hand formed from quality beef.  Always excellent,  But the new owners switched out for preformed patties of cheaper meat.  That was a spoiler for me.  And apparently not only me.  The last time I went there under those owners I was the only one there.  I wonder why they couldn't figure out where their crowd had gone.  I ordered a hot dog.\n\nBut apparently those owners dumped the place as a loser (said the bartender).  I went there last week.  Whomever bought it brought back the first class meat (98%) with fresh, hand made patties.  It's back on my recommended list.\n\nWhat other people say about the ambiance is true.  It =is= a dive bar.  I mean that in the best sense.  Cheap drinks, a friendly crowd (many of whom seem to be regulars; they know each other).\n\nThis review-o-matic only offers me a choice of 1 or 2 for ratings.

I think the bartender was new, not just because of the deer in the headlights look on his face, but also the fact that I had to wave him down after about 7 minutes of sitting there. There were 6 specials, 2 which caught my eye. After settling on one, we ordered and were told they were out of 4 of the 6 specials. Might I add it was about 12:15pm. That seemed a little early to be running out of specials. The food we ordered ended up to be OK. \n\nIf you haven't eaten here, you must. If given the option I would pick 3.5 stars.

It was accompanied by fried green beans. The sort rib was good. Definitely tender with a real hearty, rich, beefy flavor. There was only 1 scallop. It was a little tougher than the ones showcased at our event. \n\nTrying to minimize the calories, I asked for plain green beans instead. The kitchen sent out the fried which our server quickly noted and corrected, leaving the fried ones for my dinner partner to enjoy. Lacking any substantive willpower, I nibbled one or two and they were quite tasty. A light tempura coating combined with the cooking technique offered a unique, enjoyable flavor. \n\nMy \"plain\" green beans were dressed in olive oil with garlic, salt and pepper (just like I make at home). Still crisp, they were delicious! \n\nSo, I got my wish with the special, but the the regular menu challenges decision-making abilities with so many great options! \n\nMy friend got the beef tenderloin and it was, quite possibly, the best steak I've had in the Valley. It was fabulously tender (even cooked medium well) and perfectly seasoned. I look forward to ordering one for myself on a future visit. \n\nI had heard about the bread pudding from the CMYE reviews and so we splurged with dessert. It was phenomenal! Think the fluffiest, most custardy french toast flavor you've ever had! Thank goodness it was cut into two pieces -- better for a peaceful sharing. \n\nAnother tip from the CMYE, thanks to Don S., I tried the Brophy Clark Pinot Noir ($11/glass) and it was love at first sip!

Spoke with Sheldon beforehand to reserve the private dining room for \"20-25\" people.  After some hesitation on his part, he agreed to not requiring a set menu, and I agreed that my party would be patient with the service (which did not end up being a problem at all).  He also did not require a deposit, which was fantastic.\n\nI got there later than I wanted to, as I wanted to arrive a little before my reservation, but I got there exactly at 7:00 p.m.  After saying hello to some friends who had already arrived and were waiting in the bar, our table in the private dining room was ready after just a few moments.  We went in and began sitting down - the private dining room is off to the side of the restaurant (beyond the bar area) and was great for our party of 20.  There is a men's and women's restroom at the end of the dining room which was great as well, and the tables were organized well enough that it felt like we were eating at a single grand dining table.\n\nService was very good, especially considering the amount of people we had and that they were willing to do separate checks.  After getting our drinks ordered and delivered (which took about half an hour), we ordered. \n\nFor appetizers, the table had the hummus, but a few others ordered the green chile queso (very unique and good), the fried eggplant bites (I was hesitant about the goat cheese as I'm not a big fan, but there is not that much and it just enhance the flavors of the whole dish, which was good), and the bacon-wrapped shrimp (YUM).  All of it was good.\n\nPersonally, I also had a cup of the black bean soup (very good, especially if you cannot get enough black beans like myself).  My entree was the surf n' turf pasta, which was really flavorful.  You get two shrimps, which were decent sized, and two medallions of beef, which were cooked well but not overdone.  The fettucine was not al dente but still had a good texture, and the sauce was not buttery/overwhelming.  Everything felt/tasted complimentary, which was a good thing!\n\nWe finished things off with their version of chocolate cake, and they had a pumpkin cheesecake which was interesting, but I would have preferred regular cheesecake.  \n\nAnyways, I wanted to thank the staff here for a great birthday dinner.  Everything tasted great, the service was good and prompt (I don't believe there was a single issue, which is amazing considering they had 20 people all ordering something totally different, without a set menu), and we all had a great time.

Then we asked for some cornbread.  Both times we were there before it was brought out to the table just a few pieces for my husband and I to enjoy.  We thought it was odd we had to ask for it.  She offered us individual pieces, or a skillet.  We asked or a skillet.  At no point did she mention that a skillet of corn bread was $10.  It wasn't until we got the bill and had to track down a manager that we learned if you order (yes order) the corn bread in individual pieces, then it is free.  However they charge for a skillet. I don't recall seeing anything on the menu that said cornbread in a skillet - $10.  The manager was gracious enough to reverse this over sight, but we did not see our server again for the rest of the time we were at Phoenix City Grille.  Another server, not even the manager who resolved our cornbread issue brought us our check, ran the card, and returned the check for us to sign. \n\nThings happen.  Sonya didn't mention the up charge for whatever reason, we disagreed that we had never had that happen before, and the she vanished.  I was a server for years.  People don't always agree with how a business is run, and it's the job of the front line (the servers and front of the house staff) to inform guest of what things cost wither by having a price on a menu, or by telling them up front.  I'm disappointed that the felt she had to run away from us. We'll go back, but now we know, beware of the cornbread up charge.", "business_id": "Pfb6VOIiroqDWOebfgWGPQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-11-18", "type": "review"}

Absolutely phenomenal dishes. Ordered a side of fingerling potatoes ($5) and those were very dry/overcooked and came out so late. Our bar tender picked up the tab on those. Free dessert we had the torte ($8) and weren't disappointed. Total bill with one mixed drink was $68. Worth every penny.

I have been there for happy hour and dinner, but this was my first time for lunch.   I had the PCG pasta, and my friend had the small Bethany Home Salad.   The flavors for my pasta were beyond great.    The chicken consistency was a bit on the soft side.   Was it \"real\" chicken?    Dunno.   It was good, though.    I just found the consistency strange, as though it was chicken that was, what, retextured??   Notwithstanding that fact, I loved the sun-dried tomatoes and the broccoli along with the pasta.    There were crispy tortilla strips in my friend's salad that she didn't want so I put it on my pasta.   This is a hint to the restaurant:   Maybe put those strips on the pasta??   The crispness and flavoring of the corn tortilla strips were a nice compliment to the texture and flavoring of the pasta.   If her salad was \"small,\" I hate to see how large the \"big\" salad is.   I thought it was large enough for a full meal, and she did, too.    She liked her salad.    I tasted it.    I'm not a salad person, but the dressing was good and the ingredients in the salad were appealing to the eye as well as the stomach.

I'd seen the sign as I would drive south on the 51 and think \"I like duck, and I REALLY like wine. This place would be perfect for me!\"  As it turns out, I wasn't quite wrong, but it was not at all what I expected.\n\nThe Duck and Decanter is a strange blend of deli, gourmet food and kitchen wares store, as well as wine shop.  It all comes together in a fun and eclectic building set far back from the street and the rest of the shops in the area.  You definitely feel, as you enter the candlelit courtyard beneath an enormous old tree, that the world outside does get a little more muffled than it really should be.  Wandering bemusedly through the tiny shop behind the courtyard, I was really struck by how unique this place felt in Phoenix.  Care is obviously put into not only the choice of wares being sold here, but the quality of food presented to the customer.\n\nWhen I finally got around to the deli counter, I was about to order their specialty duck sandwich when I saw they had a reuben.  As I find it hard to turn down a reuben anywhere, I asked the woman behind the counter what she advised.  Without hesitation she said, \"The reuben.\"  Just as I had hoped and I'm glad I listened.  The sandwich was excellent.  Perfectly proportioned and fresh as possible without going backwards in time.  Making a good sandwich really is an art and the workers here are masterful as their craft.\n\nSitting outside at night with a wonderful sandwich in this strangely out of place shop is an opportunity not to be missed.

Oh wait, this suppose to be about the food, not Beverly Kidd. But she's so cute.\n\nOk to the food. Its been about about two years since I have been to the The Duck and I have to say I really need to come back sooner next time. My usual fare is a roast beef or corned beef sandwich, but this time I wen for the duck sandwich. I can't believe that I waited this long to try out the signature meal. \n\nYou get to choose what you want, a variety of cheese is accompanied by different mustards, mayo and of course the tomatoes, lettuce, onions, and of course almost every type of bread. What is probably the most fascinating is the assembly process. There are always at least five people assembling the orders, three taking orders or getting the orders to the customer. \n\nYou order at one end, wait around a but and pick up on the other end. On between there are cookies, sauces, coffee pots and almost anything one could want to have a yummy meal. Then there is the stuff for the home kitchen or counter. \n\nSo to the review the duck sandwich was amazing, going to have it again. Got mine on a croissant with a bit of mayo and mustard. Only got a half, with a beer. There is a small pub style corner with a smaller choice of beers. This didn't damper the meal at all. \n\nThe place is always hopigng seems like. Seating upstairs overlooks the lower area, and the outside always seems to have a couple of four legged companions that are sometimes as humorous as the owners. The little fellas seem to know exactly how much they can annoy their larger counterparts. \n\nThis is one nice deli, sandwich shop and gathering of just plain great folks. Oh yeah and Beverly Kidd was great fun to be with and eat with.. she also seemed to like the Chocolate Surprise cake I got for her.... opppss was that suppose to be kept quite?", "business_id": "HIiVx2mseVWKtx8TKfWC_A", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-11-30", "type": "review"}

I've lived in Central Phoenix for 8 years and have always heard about how great this place was.  That's the only reason I didn't turn around and walk out upon entering.

The floors, the tables, the walls - everything just looks old and worn.

It seems we are forever looking for a place that has good prices and a quiet place for us to brainstorm and raise our energy. We have stumbled upon Duck and Decanter. \nFinding this restaurant is only half the battle, the other is where the heck the front door is. I felt I was intruding on the outside patrons, only to realize I had to meander through, taking a glimpse at what they were devouring to get to the front door, an added bonus I suppose. \n\nOpening the front door to a happily buzzing place seemed like quite a treat. To your right is small wine area, to the left were barrels and stuff. A bit confusing, but basically it is like walking into a deli shop of olden days. I had no idea what I was doing. I stood in line and squinted at the barely visible menu of an array of deli meats, smoked meats, salads and more. Of course being gluten intolerant one can hope she has hit the conscious jackpot..but not today...I will just have the insides..no bun! But wait! I see smoked duck and wait..I can order the sandwich of my choice and have it made into a salad. Well that is a great compromise! \n\nOf course to know me is to know I am gunna ask a lot of questions, my main concern, does the smoked duck use nitrites, nitrates or any of those other nasty carcinogens. Rather shocked by the question, the gentleman serving me has no idea and had no intentions of looking. Damn! I was really hoping for the duck! \n\nI quickly go with plan B as I weigh nitrites or high fructose corn syrup and soybean oil..with that it was the tuna salad. \n\nYou can not pay for your meal in advance as the idea is to meander the store..so I did. there were barrels of tea and coffee ready to be ground at your request. I was not impressed with the coffee grinder on the floor-ewwww. There was also an espresso area but it was not operational. \n\nThere are gadgets to buy for your kitchen, and packaged condiments and foods that I presume they make fresh there. There are fountain drinks , bottled drinks, good assortment of water and non alcoholic beer, and loads of sugary add ons within tempting reach right at the cash register-brilliant! And there is not tempting this fort Knox (well the rice cripsy treats looked..nooo must...resist...\n\nI get my food, pay and go up stairs. There are different levels and two places to sit outside, which makes this place even more interesting. \n\nI open my package and there right on top are two pieces of bread stuck to my tuna. I read the entry for the Entree salad and it said nothing about adding in the bread. I ordered the salad due to the fact I can not tolerate gluten. \n\nToo hungry to care, I peel off the bread and I dive into my food and I am shocked at how awful it is. What is that mushy stuff? I think it was water chestnuts in my tuna salad. Who puts water chestnuts, (if that was what it was) in their tuna salad? \n\nI was unimpressed with the fact that the tuna salad was put on a bed of spring lettuce (which is a thumbs up for this nutritionist), some sliced celery and string cheese. Cheese?!? Who eats cheese with their tuna? \n\nThe tuna itself was extremely dry and too salty for my liking, and I had a tough time getting it down, and eventually I got so turned off I did not finish it. There was no dressing and no taste.  I ended up not eating the salad either. What a waste of  $10.00 including guilt tip! At least the company I was with was fantastic! \n\nSome restaurants ask you if you have been to their establishment before so that they can have the opportunity to give you the best experience possible. I truly believe this is something Duck and Decanter could adopt. Maybe I was supposed to order dressing, I have no idea. Since I had never been there before and did not know what I was doing. \n\nI did ask someone else about the ingredients and she took the time to look and confirmed my suspicions-sigh. \n\nI can't wait until there is a conscious shift to what we are putting in our bodies and those who are Celiac or gluten intolerant can eat without anxiety! \n\nIs this a place for those who are Celiac or gluten intolerant? \nNO there is not enough awareness of ingredients, and handling of food. \n\nBathrooms? yes weird..outside of the building, but clean. \n\nWould I return? \nNo but for the sake of my friends, which is way more important, I will and eat some where else first.", "business_id": "HIiVx2mseVWKtx8TKfWC_A", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-11-16", "type": "review"}

In fact my Dad has known Randy and his family all the way back to when Randy and my Dad were friends at NAU.  Their 16th Street location is as recognizable to me today as it was back then.  Today I get my fix sometimes at their original location, but also sometimes make the journey to their Downtown Phoenix location on 1st Street and Jefferson.  But for a true D&D experience, the original location is where its at (even if it might be a little hard to find).\n\nDuck & Decanter is a sandwich place first and foremost, but beyond that its a tough place to define.  In a way I sort of liken it to La Grande Orange Grocery in that its a restaurant that also has a number of grocery items you can grab on the go.  There's deli meats, cheeses, wines, coffees, and even a respectable selection of local craft brews.  There's a number of other miscellaneous items available for sale too (not all of them food or drink).  Theres seating in both the lower and upper levels of the place as well as a nice patio outside that will often have live music.  The staff has always been friendly and the mood is always casual and relaxed.\n\nThey serve breakfast and lunch items, but a true experience here is all about the Nooner sandwiches.  You can customize your own or get one of their signatures.  The Duckling is one you have to try once.  Duck, turkey, cranberry walnut relish, cream cheese and greens on walnut bread.  To me its almost like Turducken in a sandwich.  For custom sandwiches, I recommend the smoked turkey or roast beef.  There's a plethora of breads to choose from (I'm a sourdough guy) as well as a bunch of toppings to choose from.  Be sure to study the menu before ordering as the sandwich combinations are endless.  They also have some hot sandwiches to choose from if you wanna go that route.  Oh, and they always throw in the pickle and taffy are free.\n\nSo if you're around 16th Street and Camelback and looking for a freshly made sandwich or just a casual hangout spot, drive into the Sports Authority shopping complex until you reach the southeast corner of the complex and you see Duck & Decanter's original location.  Beware this place does get busy during the work week, but you can order ahead for pickup.  Its great to see this valley gem thrive and still stay true to its roots as long as it has.  Hopefully Randy's family will continue the business long enough for me to take my own kids here one day.", "business_id": "HIiVx2mseVWKtx8TKfWC_A", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-11-20", "type": "review"}

If you notice my last review, I have been ordering these for over 10 years.  \n\nWhen I got home, I noticed something was off.  No cranberry sauce!  I called to restaurant to ask if they changed their recipe.  They said no.  Then I mentioned that there was no cranberry sauce, just extra cream cheese - he said \"oh we are out of cranberry\".  He was genuinely concerned that I wasn't told when I ordered.  I threw out the sandwiches and went on with my day.\n\nToday, I came in, ordered a duckling, and confirmed that they have all the ingredients, and they did.\n\nNow I get home, and while there is cranberry, it barely covered the piece of bread there is barely any there.  They did add extra cream cheese again to make up for it...\n\nDuck and Decanter... I love you guys.  I love the duckling - the way you did it up until last month.\n\nPlease take this opportunity to train your staff and make this sandwich amazing again.\n\nI'll update my review once it's fixed.\n\nThank you!", "business_id": "HIiVx2mseVWKtx8TKfWC_A", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-11-20", "type": "review"}

The prices were great on the drinks but the margarita was an awful choice. It was bad. The long island ice tea wasn't terrible but I guess this is just a place to go for cheap drinks and medium food.

We sat in rush over traffic after our day jobs and parked in a handicap spot in order to totally fuck with the system.  Actually, the paint was faded on the spot and we just couldn't tell either way.  We didn't get towed, but you might.\n\nThis place is bigger than you'd think and when we came in we were seating promptly by some chick whose probably a junior in high school and really proud of herself for working AND going to school AND doing yearbook AND trying out for the musical this year. \n\nThe reason this place is worth trying is because the happy hour, as far as happy hours goes, it's pretty fucking awesome.  Half price FULL size apps is alone worth the trip.  Since they were cheap, we ordered a shit load of stuff and tried to act like we had NO IDEA how much food we were ordering, but we did.  We got the calamari, the wings, the spinach and artichoke dip and the fried fucking pickles.  We also got some beer and some Long Islands and talked about why Waterworld ruined Kevin Constner's career.  \n\nThe calamari was mediocre at best, mostly batter, but you know, it's calamari, what do you expect?  It wasn't horrible, it was edible and after two Long Island's not bad at all.  The wings were a bit cold and we ordered honey hot but got barbecue instead (I don't send shit back, I silently sulk and drink more), but overall they were okay, especially for the price.  The fried pickles were better than the ones you get at Lucille's but you have to be a fan of fried pickles to like them either way.  The star of our meal was definitely the spinach and artichoke dip especially since spinach and artichoke dip is some Chili's Applebee's Ultra American bullshit that usually tastes like kitten vomit.  This stuff was good though, a little spicy, creamy, not to clumpy and served in an 80's style bread bowl with tortilla chips and slices of bread that should have been toasted but weren't.  \n\nOur tab was about 50 bucks with a tip which wasn't so bad for how much food and booze we got.  I'm not giving it more stars for a few reasons.\n\n1.  they fucked up our wing order\n2.  it took us like a half hour to get our food and they brought ALL the apps out at once which seems retarded when you're just ordering apps.\n3. it was fucking dark in there.\n4. soooo much mascara. \n\nOverall, I'd go back just for the dip and some drinks.

Our waitress gave us wrong information about the ingredients for my meal twice (I'm vegan and specifically asked if the veggie burger had milk or egg, then I asked for the street tacos with a substitute of avacado and black beans and after saying that was fine she came back and said no the black beans where only for the veggie burger and I could only have avocado on it.) So I told her to forget it and to bring our appetizer the hummus and pita bread and my boyfriends order of beef street tacos. His order came first before the appetizer. She blamed this one someone in the kitchen. She did not provide utensils or napkins and she did not bring him the refried beans and rice that came with the order. We didn't mention it and just asked for the the utensils and napkins.\n\nMy boyfriend said taco bell had better tacos than here. There hummus was nothing special however the pita bread was very fluffy and delicous.\n\nShe then came by and asked me if she could get me a brownie or something for all the trouble. ( previously I let her know I do not eat milk or eggs because I am vegan, thought that was a bit of a sick joke. ) I just ignored that and said I'm sure that has milk in it and she laughed and said that was a rhetorical question.  Yea I found that ironic given her lack of waitress skills.\n\nThen the check came. It was the wrong check charged for 2 full street taco meals and hummus with an additional charge of olives which I don't know where that came from. I brought it to her attention that I believe the order was incorrect she again blamed someone in the kitchen for the error again.\n\nI won't be coming back.

I've been going here a couple times a month for close to 4 years. Their food is above average and the atmosphere is decent. Unfortunately, the last time (which will most likely be my last time) I went, the service was less than satisfactory. \n\nIt was a Monday evening. Ordered dinner for two and everything was ok. However, after dinner we went to play a game a pool. A couple of douchebags (whom have been on the sticks for 4 hours according to the Bartender) would not give up the table. Trying to virally threaten my lady and lay down stakes of $100 a game. We immediately informed the staff. Pool is free on Mondays. I figured, after confirming they've been there for 4 hours, that staff would kindly request the drunky's to back down. Wrong! We were informed if we wanted to play a game, we would have to challenge Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum to a game if we wanted to play. They basically allowed these maggots to threaten folks at the bar, didn't cut them off from drinking or nothin' Jesus. Highly disappointing.\n\nWe ordered a dessert once before that was labeled a hot browny with ice cream. When it came out, it was not a hot browny. It was still refrigerated! That's ok. We'll just inform them about the description on the menu and what we were expecting. The owner herself asked us why we eat it if we didn't like it... At this point we had a couple bites, yes. So she asked if she could heat it up. Sure... It was brought back with all the ice cream melted after basically just throwing it in the microwave. \n\nAll in all, you can't expect much from a dive bar like this. It's not like we're going to an actual restaurant. But with so many options near by, you would imagine they would try to keep people coming back. \n\nSo many good places near by.

That hunt for great wings led us to Armadillo Grill and has now turned into a weekly occurrence. I still have a place or two in Central Phx that I haven't tried (yet), but Armadillo Grill has hit the best wings in town, IMO. Yes, they are that good. What's even better is they are half price on \"Wing Wednesday\"! I strongly recommend the Armadillo Gold (Medium spicy), followed by the Honey Hot (Mild). Great seasoning on the wings, amazing sauce. Even their Buffalo (hot) is tasty - I just like the Armadillo Gold too much to venture away from it very often.\n\nI have NEVER had a rude experience with the staff. Minimal issues with service or food, that were always fixed right away and with a smile. \n\nAs for the atmosphere, you just have to know what you are walking into, and the place is great. What it is NOT: Chic, Upscale, Pretentious. What it IS: Really good food, down to earth, and no frills. It's not a \"Dive\", but it's not Twin Peaks, Buffalo Wild Wings, or Zipps either. It has an OTB (Off Track Betting) so finding half a dozen guys betting the ponies is to be expected. It's a \"Bar and Grill\" - not the worst place for a family, but if you bring kids, make sure you sit in the \"restaurant\" area, not at the tables within ear shot of the bar (that seems kind of logical though).\n\nThank you Brenda for giving us our regular \"Wing Wednesday\" hang-out!", "business_id": "CqhsIZ7TzCfJTrZqg5-gqQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-11-19", "type": "review"}

We go here most Mondays for pool as part of date night. Sometimes we have a drink or two, sometimes not. Admittedly, lately it's mainly just a soda for my husband. But the time before that, I did have a drink or two. \n\nWe got there later than usual, and both pool tables were full. So we waited for one to open up and my husband ordered a soda.  \n\nThe bartender tonight wasn't the one we normally have. And after we'd been sitting for about 15 minutes, he asked my husband, who was getting a refill of his root beer, whether we knew that there was a $5 minimum. \n\nHe said that the pool was for their guests. We couldn't just sit there, not buying anything (I guess a soda doesn't count -- I know it's not pricey, but there's a damn high profit margin) and \"just take up space.\" Seriously, that last part is verbatim.\n\nThree things: \n\n1. We weren't holding people up. If there had been a wait, we obviously wouldn't have lingered. When we got there, though, there were a few people at the bar, but at least 10-12 tables were empty. Probably more. \n\n2. I had been considering getting a drink or two. And when I drink, I get the munchies. But I generally don't like to start drinking until we're playing a game.\n\n3. We've been going there on Mondays for around 2 years now. This has never come up. Even a time or two that it was slammed during football games, while we played pool and my husband had a soda while I had a water. No one ever said anything even remotely approaching that.\n\nI'm not saying I wouldn't necessarily understand a $5 minimum though, again, this is the first time I've heard of it. But you'd think an employee would be smart/well-trained enough to not use the words \"take up space\" in reference to the customer he's actually talking to.\n\nOh by the way, the bartender's remarks were especially funny after his comment when my husband got his root beer. He told the guy to leave it open, though he said that might be the only thing he'd be getting. So the bartender told him he could just pay now and still get refills.

The waitress was dressed very provocatively (large breasts falling out of the top of her dress- showing her panties each time she bent over- which was often)- it appeared that many ladies on dates felt uncomfortable, arms crossed immediately with the men looking at the ground... Probably more uncomfortable for the guys really- because one wrong glance or blink and that date is over! \n\nIf this is the vibe Merc Bar is going for then... well done I guess.  I will say, it is awkward when a girls large boobs are coming out of her top and she keeps bending down with her chest in your date's face... kudos to her for being an attractive young lady, but it's a bit much when it makes the guests uncomfortable. \n\nAlso,  as one woman left her table to use the restroom, I watched the waitress flirt and stroke her husband's arm up and down as she gave him the check... I have a feeling if the wife saw that.... well, I'm happy she didn't, because you just don't know how people are gonna react to that disrespectful, intrusive behavior. It knocked the place down a couple notches- not quite Hooters vibe or strip club lounge- Maybe Champagne room? I really did wonder if I got up to use the restroom, would this girl come over to feel my guy up too? I didn't like that one bit. It wasn't a good feeling to have out with your significant other- and unfortunately, this is the memory I so strongly took away. Then again, it was also interesting watching the guy that somehow ended up on a date with a transexual squirm in the corner as she insisted on playing with his hair and trying to kiss on his neck... That must have been an internet date, lol!\n\nAlso, regarding the service, each time we would ask questions about the drinks the waitress would have to go ask the bartender. It's a specialty cocktail lounge- we aren't liquor micro-biologists asking for a chemical analysis of their concoctions- just regular basic questions. It would have been nice if she would have had some level of knowledge and training- given the niche and price points. \\ \n\nAll in all- I remember when this place was hot, back in the day- when I don't think I was even old enough to drink. It's still a nice place, but there are so many more options in this town now. Urbanity in Phoenix is progressing- gotta keep up with the times Merc Bar. When my barista knowns more about the soymilk in my Latte than this chick knows about a fresh squeezed lemon in a cocktail we have an issue. \n\nAs for the drinks... They were okay. I wasn't blown away by the choices. We ended up going to Sidebar afterwards- I love their muddled blueberrry whiskey sour- house made. Delicious! The drinks were better at Sidebar and the vibe was a little more modern less stripclub/2001 Scottsdale nightclub.\n\nSorry Merc.", "business_id": "peA3F-PnIfijYr8HuG-A-Q", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-11-05", "type": "review"}

My boyfriend and I have lived in NYC, DC, LA, and been to many trendy, scene-y bars all over, and we both agreed she was by far the worst in terms of blatantly bad customer service.  She didn't say hello when we sat down, she walked by several times before we waved her down and asked if we could place an order with her, she had an attitude when we mentioned something was missing from our order (mind you, it was only one appetizer) and and she was definitely NOT personable throughout the night. She actually had an attitude. There was a decent amount of people inside the establishment, but the girls were NOT running back and forth and were really not THAT busy. Just bad service lol.

I liked its subdued and quaint atmosphere; however, the smooth jazz music's volume was turned up significantly as the afternoon turned into dusk.  It's a good thing I enjoy smooth jazz.\n\nChose the French onion soup starter, the Kona-crusted sirloin steak entree, and cheesecake w/ fresh berries sauce to finish.  I really enjoyed the onion soup- salty from the cheese, yet just enough sweetness from the caramelized onions.  I really liked how some areas of the cheese that blanketed the bowl were crispy!  I thought perhaps it was the bread that sometimes one would find below the cheese, but no, it was the cheese itself.  Wished the whole piece was crunchy...\n\nI absolutely adored the Kona-crusted sirloin.  Cooked to medium- perfect!- and I could taste the coffee, too, and not just feel the texture of coffee grains, as I've ordered similar entrees from other venues, but never tasted the intended effect.  The caramelized shallot cream sauce absolutely floored me!  One of the best sauces that has graced my lips :)  Mmm... The entree came with two standard sides (no substitutes allowed, or at least that was what I was told) of creamed spinach and smashed red potatoes.  Both were delightful- decadently rich and creamy.  Before I forget, the table bread basket (seeded dinner rolls and lavosh) was good, especially the seeded rolls.  You may also order toasted sourdough if you have food allergies to avoid.\n\nStepping back down, but not much, from the piece de resistance (in this meal, the standout was the steak), was the creme brulee cheesecake w/ berry sauce w/ fresh berries!  Simply incredible!   While I had to return the more beautiful (more caramelized sugar crust) first offering, untouched, due to food issues, the second was less visually stunning, but tasted divine.

This fine dining restaurant definitely gets two thumbs up!  Though there was no gluten-free pasta, brown rice, or quinoa, there were other wonderful options to still satisfy my strict dietary needs.\n\nCapital Grille is an excellent place to experience, not just for the food but also for the experience...it truly represents fine dining well!", "business_id": "QdbZyl-LWFS54u93Vjd5SA", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-10-10", "type": "review"}

Litterally driving into the parking lot of a few other well known restaurants and going \"no...not feeling it\", and driving out of the parking lot without stopping.   I was intent on trying some place new.  Honestly I don't know what made me park and come into TCG, and even then when I walked in I was about ready to turn around, I wasn't wanting so upscale but decided to just go in and grab a seat at the bar.  \nMy indeciseiveness that night extended into trying to choose what to drink and what to eat.  The bartender and the lady sitting next to me highly recommend the Stoli Doli, house infused pineapple vodka martini.  Why not? What a great recommendation.  Wonderfully simple, slightly sweet pineapple goodness in a martini glass.  \nLooking over the bar menu, I then asked for the full menu.  Wow the Wine list is IMPRESSIVE.  The menu options matched the rich darkness in the restaurant.  Sultry and romantic...I can see why there were so many couples here enjoying the ambiance.  The service is as impressive as the wine list.\nI finally decided, but I question my own combination of what I chose.  Obviously not that hungry, I choose the Wagyu beef carpaccio and a wedge salad( this is where I wonder what was I thinking).  I would have much happier in the end had I just had the carpaccio.   Not that it was bad....just so didn't do the restaurant justice.   It's not ment to stand out on its own.  But it satisfied something at the moment.  The rich blue cheese dressing and bacon...unfortunately iceburg lettuce is never stellar even with the dressing.\nThe Wagyu carpaccio was beautifully plated.  Lightly seared exterior and rare interior of thinnly sliced beef accompanied by a portion of lightly dressed arugula salad and parmagian cheese.   The seared exterior had a seasoning that I am not sure that added to the dish.  I appreciate carpaccio for its simplicity. However that was my only \"issue\" and it didn't keep me from enjoying the dish.  The richness of the wagyu and the peppery arugula were perfect together.  Including tip my vist was around $50.\nNext time I will go with a friend or 3 who are ready for a fine meal.", "business_id": "QdbZyl-LWFS54u93Vjd5SA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-09-05", "type": "review"}

So I originally made reservations to Ruth's Chris for my boyfriend's birthday dinner but I saw the menu for Capital Grille and immediately changed my mind and I'm so glad I did.  I made reservations on their website and mentioned it was my boyfriends birthday.  When we got there, the host and manager both greeted us and were very professional, wishes my boyfriend a happy birthday.  They let us sit at the bar for drinks before we sat down to dinner since the table wasn't ready yet. When we got to the table, there was a card signed by all the staff, happy birthday confetti that lined down the table it was wonderful.  The atmosphere was very welcoming, it was dim and very elegant but not overly done which I liked.  The bread they provided was warm and delicious.  We ordered the calamari for appetizer and let me just say... if you love calamari, THIS IS IT RIGHT HERE!!! its perfectly seasoned, breaded and crispy, and its mixed with banana peppers and tomato which give it a nice kick and some jazz. LOVED IT LOVED IT LOVVVVVED IT!  We then shared the porterhouse steak 28oz and it was delicious and perfectly cooked, a little colder than I would like it but at least they cooked it right.  We also ordered the lobster mac and cheese and paramasean truffle fries as our sides.  Way too much food for the both of us, we had to take half the steak, most of the mac and cheese and fries home but they were all delicious.  The service was amazing, our server was on point and very good, she knew the menu really well and explained everything to us.  The overall experience was a 10.  After our meal, the server came out with a slice of chocolate mousse cake with a lit candle for my boyfriend and it was on the house! They are so generous.

We went after late evening at work...my environment is pretty casual, so I was in t-shirt and shorts. Even on a Tu night it seemed the general atmosphere was business casual.  We were greeted and seated as soon as we came in and appeared no judgments were made. We then waited.  ....and waited.....and waited.  I was beginning to wonder if they didn't like my attire or something.  We noticed it seemed there was a huddle between the wait staff wondering who would take our table. Still no one.  I got up to use the rest room and when I got back my lady said they were bringing out some calamari on the house for our wait.  Sweet!  I generally don't care one anyone the other about calamari...but theirs was really good.  A bit of. A spice, a little kick...but quite tasty.  The waiter was extremely apologetic about our wait and was on top of everything afterwards.  I got the bone in sirloin, lady the filet.  Both were very tasty and cooked to our liking.  The mashed potatoes were delicious...creamy and buttery tasting.  Green beans tasty and crisp.  The espresso chocolate cake dessert...oh my was it rich.  A little chocolate sauce or more raspberry sauce would have been a welcome addition to the dollop of whip cream and raspberries but it was still tasty.. \n\nBut the final action that really put the experience over the top was when the bill was supposed to come and instead the manager said dinner was on them.  They did not want to leave us with a bad experience (esp. considering it was our first time there.). I tried telling him this was unnecessary as they already more than made up for many issues.  They insisted...so the waiter ended up with a pretty good tip out of it.  That was all class though and made me feel quite good about our dining choice. The way they handled things and the food quality even prior to that would have gotten them at least 4 stars.  But the fact they have proven themselves a class act...that puts them over the top.

She introduced herself and immediately I knew she was going to be great. Very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. Part of what made her so great was that she shared her passion for food and cooking. Anyone can be a good server, but it takes someone like Shay with her passion to be a great server, especially in a high end restaurant. \n\nMoving on to the food....\nShay recommended the lunch size filet with prawn scampi. Served with a choice of side, I picked the mashed potatoes. \n\nThis meal was just perfect in every way. A nice size filet and four large prawns on top. There aren't words to describe how good the scampi sauce was...garlic, butter and actually a little spicy. The mashed potatoes could not have been better, seasoned just right and made with butter and cream. I am excited just writing about it and I can't wait to go back!\n\nEveryone in my party had the same thing and we all agreed how great this meal was. \n\nSo...Want a recommendation?

Great job with the remodel! However, I had really a really poor experience. My dad arrived first and a male server came over to greet him (he ordered a beer and water). Then I arrived... No one came over for like 10 minutes. Then my mom arrived and still no one for about another 5-8 minutes. I flagged down another server and told her we needed our server.

While my love and I waited for the shared main course of eggplant lasagna, I happened to chat up the courteous and attentive waiter who mentioned the specialty of the house - pasta made in house.  So we visited the pasta chef who proudly showed off the spinach-ricotta ravioli, pappardelle, fettucini and gnocchi.  Since my partner was nursing a leg injury, the pasta chef brought the tray over to our table and suggested we try the gnocchi with alfredo sauce.  The gnocchi were the melt-in-your-mouth kind and the sauce was a tomato enhanced alfredo - very flavorful.   Full from the appetizer, salad and gnocchi, we decided to take the eggplant lasagna home so that we could taste the home made \"tiramisu\".  Again, the tiramisu was incredible - the liquer flowing as your fork went through the dessert which was flavorful, not too sweet and coated the mouth.  We had the left over gnocchi and eggplant lasagna the next day - what a treat as a leftover.  Overall the service was great, food was excellent.

One tasted like vegetable stroganoff and was just nasty.\n\nCeasar salad had way too much dressing and tasted pre-made (kind of limp and drowning), the pasta as a whole frankly tasted like crap, and the dessert could have fit on a tablespoon.\n\nFurthermore, our server seemed rude since we weren't dropping $150 on dinner.  We made no complaints as it seemed like one of those heavy handed places where the blame would clearly be placed on the patron, so we didn't bother.  Just smiled weakly and paid the bill.\n\nIt was a big two star step down from our first experience, where I was probably generous as it was with 4 stars.  \n\nFrankly, I'll take my business elsewhere with the many amazing Italian restaurants around the valley.  Leave this restaurant to the Assisted Living crowd that spare no expense for frankly mediocre food.\n\nHowever, IF you have to go here (coupon, invited by another, etc.), stick to the following:\n\nOrder the parmesan encrusted fish (you can't go really wrong with that), and if you want a pasta course, stick to the gnocchi.

Maybe it was because I spent the last three weeks on a whirlwind tour of New York, Philadelphia, and Asheville, NC.\n\nIn any case, aside from the service, which was very good, I was deeply unimpressed with the food here. We started off with a plate of gnocchi in an Alfredo sauce and an appetizer of calamari. The gnocchi was completely drenched in Alfredo sauce, which is reminiscent of restaurants that try to hide the quality of their food with excessive sauce, e.g., The Olive Garden. The calamari was a bit rubbery, but otherwise average for a 2-3 star restaurant.\n\nOnto the main course, I opted for the Ossobucco Milanese ($33). Again, this dish was completely covered in sauce. Aside from the bone, I wouldn't have been able to tell what I was eating. The risotto was overcooked, and there was a hint of a taste of dishwater so it was probably diluted to keep it from burning on the stove.\n\nAgain, the service was very good. And their bread was probably the best part of the meal. Maybe this place did serve good Italian food at one time, but the oversaucing of the food just killed it for me. For $33, I would like to taste the quality and flavor of the meat. If I wanted to eat gravy, I'd go to Grandy's. And don't get me started on the decor. Wow. Just wow. Think mirrors.\n\nMy suggestion would be to skip this place and head over to BLT Steak for their escargot appetizer ($7) during happy hour and then to Beckett's Table for the Pork Osso Bucco Confit ($18).

My husband and I are very critical when it comes to semi-fine dining and we were pleasantly surprised.\n\nIt is a very quaint, cozy restaurant in a very strange area.  We started with Escargot and French Onion soup. The Escargot were very tasty and traditional. The French Onion soup probably should have been a bit more traditional. It was a tad sweet and could have used a bit more brothy richness. We opted for wine by the glass. Whatever white wine I first ordered was not drinkable and they quickly whisked it away and replaced it with another wine of my choosing with heavy apologies.\n\nFor our entrees, I had the scallops which were beautifully cooked, nice sauce and delish ricotta gnocchi. My husband had the duck and it was also superb and  very well cooked. \n\nDessert was a bit of a disappointment. We were debating between our old standby of creme brulee and lime mousse calypso. We opted away from the safe option and went with the lime calypso. It tasted as if it had been refrigerated for a while. The lime mousse wasn't limey enough and the bread bottom was a distraction and not so tasty.\n\nThe service was impeccable. We really liked our waitress and a man who we believe was the owner stopped by at each course to see how everything was. Nice touch.  \n\nOur only other criticism was the bread service.  It was warm which is a plus in my book but not that tasty. I think it could be easily improved. It was the right idea in that it was a warm crusty baguette but not that tasty.\n\nOverall, we would definitely go back there. Would we crave it? Probably not but if you are looking for a solidly very good dining experience I would send you here.

The smoked salmon was perfect with the creme fresh sauce and toasted baguettes on the side. \n\nThe most amazing dish we sampled was the Noisettes de boeuf, which is essentially small tender pieces of beef wrapped in very lean bacon in a Dijon mustard sauce. This was seriously the most amazing beef that I've ever had and I'm typically not a steak person.

I like the set up they have in here. The girls do one song on the back stage, then they switch to the front stage. There is a girl there with an amazing body with great muscle, her name is LaRue. I asked her if she competes and she said she's a FIGURE competitor. I told her I am on a journey to lose 135 pounds and compete in FIGURE myself. She was awesome and said for me to come back and visit her when I reach my goal. One of the things I did like is that ALL the girls had nice bodies, great boobs and nice butts.

It is not a \"dive\" in the true or hipster sense.  A \"dive\" does not have 6 flat panel television sets, a disc jukebox stocked with local music & a modern internet connected jukebox, a mean pulled pork sandwich or a great selection of booze.  It may be old (by Phoenix standards) but it's no \"dive\".\n\nIce House Tavern is one of the best bars I've been to.  Period.  Unique to boot.  It's attached to an ice rink.  While I was there a range from mites to juniors were practicing on the ice.  I was even treated to watching a Phoenix Roadrunners Zamboni resurface the ice between sessions.  As the practices died down the bar began to fill with hockey people.  It was amazing.  I was able to watch a Red Wings game with sound at a bar in Phoenix.  \n\nAccording to a calendar of events posted by the door there is also dart tournaments, local comedy and bands.  I think they get punk shows.  I found out, after the fact, that a few friends have attended shows there.  \n\nThe beer selection was most impressive.  Have your pick of cheap swill or tenderly crafted micro brews.  A delicious pulled pork sandwich is the only proper eats offered.  If pulled pork isn't your thing you'll have to settle for snacks: Corn Nuts, Slim Jim and various candies.  Great service too.\n\nIce House Tavern is a must and I look forward to future visits and, perhaps, the opportunity to explore events that happen here.

While everything I said before was true, not it isn't necessarily.   The previous owners were big supporters of local music, but the current ones are not into the music scene at all.  In fact, my friend's band had a show cancelled once the new owners took possession.   It was a divey bar in a scummy neighborhood back when I went to it, sure, but it had vibe, character and the fact they supported local music went a long way to forgive a LOT.  Now, its just a divey bar in a bad neighborhood. \n********\n\n\nPrevious review 10/24/14\nThe best thing about this place is that they really go out of their way to support local bands.  I've been coming here since 2009.  Always great local music.  Even in their juke box.  \n\nThe next best thing is the fact you can watch a human aquarium of sorts, an ice skating rink, and later, hokey.  \n\nThe place just has a charm to it that is pretty unique, at least in PHX.\n\nThe place is kinda small, which is actually good for up close and personal local live music.  the bands will generally stay for the other sets and most of the musicians are happy to talk to you.  Two great bands that come to mind are Quarter Inch Crown, and Vic TIms and the Kentucky Rifles.  \n\nProbably the only truly bad thing is that the area it is in is pretty sketchy.  Always try to park in the well-lit areas up front near the cameras.  I had my truck broken into 3 years ago and had my stereo ripped off.  This apparently happens so much in the area, the cops didn't even bother with finger prints.  The owners of the bar can only do so much, with limitations of parking, so its not their fault, but you do need to know what kind of area it is in.  So beware, and be aware.\n\nOverall, I do recommend Ice House Tavern.", "business_id": "yb17xHvhDJthJGS10uhFeQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-10-14", "type": "review"}

Having lived in NYC for a while, I became a bit spoiled and was pleasantly surprised to find Postino comparable to places I loved out there! \n\nNighttime is the best time to go as it's dim, loud and full of energy. Postino is one of my favorite places to go for a light dinner and drinks with good friends year-round; however, on a fall or spring night, when they have all the doors and windows open onto the patio, it's perfection.\n\nAs many have mentioned, the bruschetta is great. It's a good option for an appetizer or sharing for a main dish, especially if you'd rather focus on filling up with wine than food. ;) The grilled cheese appetizer is tasty, but a pretty small portion. If you're looking for a small compliment to wine, they've got a \"cheese course\" and a meat and cheese \"plate\". The cheese course comes with 3 different cheeses that they switch up frequently. It's a pretty decently sized dish, but the last time I ordered it, the \"fruit\" they mentioned on the menu was basically just dried apricots, cranberries and nuts. It wasn't bad, but with the crunchy bread it came with, there were too many dry things on one plate for my liking! If you like olives, I'd recommend splurging on the $5 olive bowl. It's a generous portion of mixed olives that will not disappoint. \n\nMy all-time favorite item at Postino is the \"Prosciutto with Brie\" Panini, on Ciabatta bread, with salad. The sandwich is soft prosciutto layered with brie, arugula and figs, drizzled with a little balsamic and olive oil and served on a super crunchy ciabatta roll. If this was the only item on the menu, I'd still make the 15 mile drive to order it. The sandwich is big enough to share, but I love it enough to eat the whole thing and suffer the consequences later. :) All of the paninis come with potato chips or salad. Rarely would I choose salad as a side, but I actually look forward to this salad almost as much as the sandwich. It's romaine lettuce, pine nuts, crumbled feta and a very light oil dressing (from what I can gather). \n\nThe two negatives, which is what drops it from 5 stars to 4 are the following: The service is often lacking. There are some really nice, attentive servers and there are some rather pretentious servers (which isn't unheard of at a wine-bar). It's really hit or miss, but I take it with a grain of salt and don't let it deter me from going. After all, a pretentious server can become great material for dinner-time laughs. \n\nThe second negative is the parking situation. This is an issue with any of the many LA Grande Orange establishments located on that corner. Pretty much any time you go there, you will have trouble finding parking. They do offer valet, but call me cheap, I'd rather not HAVE to pay for valet. \n\nTo make a long story short (I know, too late), go to Postino if you're looking for an experience you're unlikely to find anywhere else in Phoenix.", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-09-02", "type": "review"}

I'm not into big chains, but maybe they'd consider a satellite location?\n\nThe bruschetta is a dream -- perfect to share with a group. I especially enjoyed the roasted pepper with goat cheese; brie, apple and fig spread; and the wonderfully salty roasted artichoke heart versions.\n\nAnd of course, I enjoyed the wine.

And Postino's is about one of the best places in town to get some. It is difficult for me to venture out away from my usual wine drinking whole.... but I need to through this place back into the rotation more often. \n\nThe girls and I had a nice late dinner and wine the other night, to catch up over the Thanksgiving holiday. We had two great bottles of wine, the Malbac and the Teprinillo, a cup of amazing spicy corn chowder, artichoke dip, and the brichetta (apple and brea, smoked salmon and pesto, fig and prosciutto, roasted red pepper and goat cheese). Their brischetta makes my mouth water just thinking about it! Our waitress was awesome! Very nice, and took very good care of us, even though there was a miss-hap with out food, we didn't care, we had wine and it was fun! \n\nWe also just found out about a special they have going on Monday and Tuesday's starting at 8pm..... $20 for your choice of brischetta and a bottle of their house wine.

But honestly, I think this place is slightly overrated. Don't get me wrong, I like this place, and I oblige them every time they want to go, but I think 4 stars is just right for the rating. \n\nWe went there this weekend, and the typical scenario went down. Parking was cramped (lucked out to get a \"valet\" spot which I parked into myself as it was right out front by the entrance - no I'm not waiting for you Mr. Valet Dude to get into my car and pull it forward into the spot right in front of my face, thank you very much), and there was a short wait (maybe 10-15 minutes). We sat outside, which wasn't ideal since it was cold and drizzly, but we had patio heaters on both sides of our table so it was OK. \n\nSadly we didn't make their $5 wine special, which ends at 5pm, so we were paying full price for the glasses of wine - ranging from $8 to about $12-13. I don't know about you, but I really am not a fan of paying $10 for a glass of wine when I can pay that for an entire bottle. But alas, I had 2 different wines through the course of the night, both on recommendation from the servers, and both decent. \n\nWe ordered the infamous bruschetta, with the 4 choices being: smoked salmon (YUM!), warm artichoke (tasty), roasted red pepper (still good), and white bean with tomato (OK, but nothing to write home about). \n\nFor dinner, I had the half & half combo (where you get to choose 2 different items), and I chose the mixed green salad (REALLY delicious, with an awesome combination of greens, pears, grapes, gorgonzola cheese, pecans, & poppyseed dressing) and half of a turkey/pesto pannini. The pannini was QUITE boring. Didn't have much flavor at all. I think it was lacking on the pesto. \n\nAnd honestly, this is what I come to expect at Postino. Some things are just unbelievable and you want to lick your plate clean, and other things are simply boring and tasteless (like the white bean/tomato bruschetta and the turkey/pesto pannini). \n\nAnd hence my rating of 4 stars rather than 5. If the parking was easier, the wines were always $5 a glass, and the food was consistent, I would give it 5 stars. Fair enough?  :)", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-11-30", "type": "review"}

Got there at 7 p.m. and scored a table with no wait in the middle of the dining room.  Immediately I realized it was a little too loud for the audience with the music playing, but stuck it out.  I was meeting my friend's parents who were in town on vacation and thought it would be a nice, casual place with hopefully great wine and food.  They loved the architecture inside, with the exposed pipes and brick and large, open garage doors.  The patio was probably not quite as loud, but was full so we were definitely stuck inside.  \n\nI had a glass of $11 Malbec, which was fantastic.  We ordered the bruschetta and I im in love with the artichoke version as well as the apple and brie.  I was not blown away by the mozzerella and tomato, which I thought I had heard was a guaranteed good time.  I also got the turkey panini though which I got with a salad.  It was bigger than any panini I've ever had and I took half of it home.  It had  a pesto sauce that made it the best panini I think I've had in my lifetime.  (Maybe I've had ten paninis though in my lifetime so take it for what it's worth.)  The salad I was not blown away by and was not disappointed when the waiter took it away while asking if he could take it away.\n\nService was a little slow, but again it was a Friday night.  The wait staff is a friendly, helpful group and didn't rush us as we sat and chatted while eating for three hours.  \n\nValet is $3, which is fair, but what is a riot is when you walk out, if you had your keys, you could walk the twenty feet and get your car yourself.  But instead, you have to wait behind five people for the valet to hand you your keys and THEN you walk to your car.

I showed up about 2 PM. and the crowd was casual and just having a good time. As the time got later the typical Arcadia yuppie / trendy crowd began coming in. Totally killing the atmosphere.

I swear it seems as though there is a clan of people on yelp all yelping together to write great reviews, because it's what they like, so gay. \nOK, now for this food review, it's strictly for the bruschetta's. Honestly I don't know why people praise somethings. I tasted four of them. Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato and Basil. Tomato Jam and fresh Sheep's Milk Cheese. Burrata, Bacon, Arugula, and Tomatoes. And Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese. Let me get one thing clear, they all tasted good, and yes some were more impressive than others, but come on it's a slice of bread with a topping, not really a culinary masterpiece. Although I will give props to the Tomato jam, that was delicious! \nAs an all around value of Postino, you really can't go wrong. The prices match what these items should be priced at, and solid drink deals. I would definitely go back if fellow friends suggest going there, but I don't think I would go out of my way to come back here.\n  But with all this being said, they have 2 locations and are opening up a third one.

The place has a chill feel to it, so it's a great place to take a date. \n\nPostino has an extensive wine list and also offers an awesome variety of beers. Their beer list includes your basic domestics, higher end domestics, and a handful of tasty imports.\n\nThe food is amazing as well, with the highlight being the bruschetta. When ordering the bruschetta, you choose any four of eleven yummy choices. None of the eleven are bad, however my favorites are the brie and apples with fig spread, Mozzarella with tomato and basil, salami with pesto, and the warm artichoke spread.\n\nThe outdoor seating area is the place to be and the prices are very reasonable.\n\nGreat food, awesome wine list, good beer selection, nice ambience, and reasonable prices give Postino five stars.", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-10-07", "type": "review"}

My kinda jams.\n\nThe food gets its own category because holy miss moly, this stuff is good.

We went with 1-Brie and Apples with Fig Spread, 2-Ricotta with Dates and Pistachio's, 3-White Bean with Chopped Tomato and 4-Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese. FOODGASM. When we ordered this, we were under the impression we were only geting 1 piece of each type of bruschetta that we chose and when it arrived at our table we were pleasantly surprised to see we actually get 4 pieces of each flavor. Lots of food!! Great price point for what you get. Presentation: Rocks, Flavor: Unreal, Price Point: Totally worth it. Because we originally thought the bruschetta was going to be a \"side\" we also ordered the Vegetarian panini with a side Mixed Green salad which was also super delicious.

Since my last review of this place was in 2008, I figured it was time for an update, but honestly, not too much has changed since then - I'm a very loyal customer and have been for years!\n\nMy favorite menu items are still the same too:\nThe artichoke dip (which actually comes with hummus too but I always special request double artichoke instead because I love it so much), the mixed green salad with added turkey, chicken, or prosciutto, and the bruschetta board... My top two bruschetta faves are Brie & Apple with Fig Spread and Prosciutto, Fig & Mascarpone. Mmmmm!\n\nI'm not currently drinking (I'm prego again), but of course this is the perfect place to go for a glass of wine or four as well!  \n\nService is always fabulous and the atmosphere rocks too.  So in my eyes, this place deserves five stars... even almost five years from my original review!\n\nOf course, it is worth noting that it's not only a favorite of mine, there are plenty of others that love it too... so, sometimes you may have to wait a bit.  If you've got a large party (eight or more), I highly recommend making a reservation ahead of time.", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-11-02", "type": "review"}

Service has more spunk and personality at this Postino location too. Try the cucumber lemonade if you don't like wine or just plain water. If you order wine and it isn't happy hour, you can easily spend more than $30 on yourself. However, I think it is worth it, and I always leave full and happy.

If you haven't been to Postino's, you are missing out! They have awesome happy hour specials - $5 for the equivalent of 2 glasses of wine (if that's your poison) or a mini pitcher of beer which comes out to about 2 1/2 glasses of beer. That little for booze?! Sign me up!!! Mondays (I think it's Monday...) all bottles of wine are half off! They feature a lot of local wines and hard to find wines. This is the place where I first fell in love with Moscato. I can't say enough about their Moscato except that it is delicious!\n\nTheir bruschettas are very tasty and hands down the best I've ever had. They get creative with their toppings and there's something to please palettes of all kinds. If I had to narrow down my top 4 favorites, I would choose: the apple, brie, and honey; fig, marscapone, and pistachio; the mozzarella, basil, and tomato; and finally the prosciutto and fig.\n\nDownside - parking can be tough since this place is usually hopping. But they offer valet at a staggering price of $3. That's right - 3 bucks. Not too bad to have someone park your car 20 feet away. Also, the service can lag at times depending on how busy they are.

Autostrada Panini - I am not one to pass up on any meat, on meat, on meat, on meat action (yes, 4 types of salty cured pig parts...especially in regards to the Soppressata, LOL!)!

I've been a regular here since I moved to the neighborhood over a year ago. However, there appears to be some staffing changes that are interfering with service.\n\nThe food and wine really are top of the line. There hasn't been a single morsel of food that has crossed my palate that I've disagreed with. Unfortunately the experience is not what it used to be, and for that I'm disappointed. If you're ok with extended wait time between glasses of wine, great. I'd recommend ordering a bottle of wine and being done with any further expectation of service. (Including water.)\n\nI've been visiting during off peak hours to ensure there would be no unnecessary wait time or standing around. (So, for example, 2pm for a lunch hour.) This is a wine bar. When you go, it would be nice to receive the wine you order. The last time we went I watched my wine sit at the bar. When my friend managed to flag down our server (fifteen minutes after we had placed our first order) what the status was he joked, \"I can't squeeze the grapes.\" (If it had been convenient/easy for me to move quickly I would have picked it up myself. Crutches, not so much.)\n\nSo not funny. I get it. You can get in the weeds. It's better to admit that.  But - maybe - call me crazy - check in your table more frequently the rest of the meal. We eventually were able to order a second a glass of wine. The wait time for vino was, alas, terrible.  \n\nI'm telling this story as an example of the service I've received as of late. There are others. I'm not sure what's happened or why. The upside to not having any table service (or much of it) is that you have ample time to speak to your table partners. Perfect for a date. Not so perfect if you're on a business lunch or in a rush at all. \n\nAnother option for speedier service might be to sit at the bar. The bar isn't terribly huge but offers comfortable seating.

I don't typically go for tuna sandwiches, but it sounded perfect, and the pickles and the mustard added just the right hint of piquancy.  The salad was nice too, though a little sweet for my tastes; all in all, it paired nicely with the tuna sandwich.  I love the kale and quinoa combo.  \n\nThis is a fun place to come with friends, so that you can share all of the different types of bruschetta.  If I came back and didn't order anything but a few different bruschetta, I wouldn't feel like I missed out. :)", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-09-16", "type": "review"}

The wine was a Moscato and it actually was very good but I wish the waitress would know enough to put it on ice. My cousin who is a pretty aggressive person, asked for a bucket with ice. It has been quite a few years since I've been here and the bruschetta was definitely not as good as I remembered it.  There were a couple of standouts and then there were some that were just meh. Are tab was ninety dollars, and for that amount I would have expected a lot more.

I hit Yelp up to help me find a few places, this was one of them. \nI had chose 3 from yelp to go to in one night and this was my second stop. It is not as divey as the previous reviews in my opinion. It is clean, well lit, and the furniture is in good condition. These qualities are opposite of a dive bar. It seemed to me that the customers were all regulars. there is one pool table in the center of the bar and a jukebox. Someone thought we would all enjoy three 311 songs in a row. Not so much. \n\nThe beer specials are great. i don't think I will be returning, the stares from the regular customers made me uncomfortable and the only thing dive bar about it is the stinky bathroom.", "business_id": "qOE7oX1lIVUJUYvSwFy5Wg", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-09-26", "type": "review"}

Well, apart from the few people taking up the bar games... though they all did clear out by midnight. The bar location didn't seem like it would really draw people in on that alone. Think: East Phoenix 70s mini-strip-mall...\n\nThe bartender went to my high school and had been in the valley forever. The vibe in the place was very old-school local. Valley natives would feel at home I imagine. The location probably has a bit to do with that. \n\nBefore everyone cleared out, I joined in a chat with some of the regulars - they were quite friendly and I would feel quite comfortable going back based on that. Smart, young, and good-looking... also hip and down to earth. Pretty refreshing, really. \n\nThe drinks were quite strong... plan a designated driver or an alternative method home if you're going to drink. The atmosphere was 'dirty old dive bar,' but I've definitely been in much worse. I'd say it's on the clean end of that description. However...\n\nI went into the men's room to take a piss and someone had splattered their own shit onto the wall of the tiny bathroom. It was a big splat about waist high, streaks going from splat to floor where there was a big shit pile. What kind of person throws their shit on the wall? I mean, seriously...\n\nI took a picture with my phone and pissed and then left it as it was. I told the bartender about it and she seemed to immediately know who had done it. I mean, if you know a person is capable of shitting on a wall - don't fucking let them into your bar... duh. She said she wasn't going to clean it and said I could use the ladies room (which I did the second time I had to piss). I guess I don't blame her not wanting to clean it... it was gross. \n\nNot too gross to take a picture of though - should I submit it to the photos of this place on here?\n\nI guess apart from the shit and the location, this place is okay for a local dive. It's punk-friendly and has plenty of bar games (pool, darts, etc...). It's similar to TT Roadhouse, but with only half the character - also a little more space and fewer customers.", "business_id": "4vZZjr6IZAk4riT0DB8MbQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2007-11-28", "type": "review"}

I told him I would like coffee with my food because I was cold  then I might have something after eating. I ate my taco's my husband ate his breakfast.

We actually thought he was joking then he brought us the bill. I asked him again for a drink and he said I looked drunk. Tired maybe but hadn't had anything to drink that day. I paid my check and told him that we would not be back. He said, \" who cares\". He heard my husband order coffee from the other barmaid with my meal. My husband always orders for me.

They're yummy and they're cheap. And they're good! There are three basic breakfast options (no substitutions). $4 will buy you eggs, hash browns, sausage or bacon and toast. Can't go wrong there!  $6 is the same w/French Toast, Pancakes or a Biscuit. I've never tried anything else off the regular menu, however they do offer omelettes and regular lunch and dinner options. \n\nThere's never any parking. (Seriously). This gritty place offers ample television viewing options to catch a game. (Twenty one of them!) The downside is there doesn't appear to be any sound offered. Wifi if you want it. \n\nA pitcher of beer is five bucks. Apparently this is a really good place to get tanked on the cheap. Or to recover from a hangover.

Kudos for actually serving bacon crispy when requested. Meals are for the most part a great value. A diverse clientele ranging from retired couples, business owners planning their day, workers on a break, women socializing... and they have table arrangements that can easily handle larger groups.

I watched him go to every table around us a couple times while we received our appetizer, ate it, and a busser took the plate before I flagged him down so we could order.  \nMy friend ordered the lasagna, which tasted like a Wendy's cheeseburger.  Seriously, my friend said try it and tell me what fast food it tastes like.  I laughed and then tasted it to find it tasted exactly like a double stack, but 10 times the price.  I ordered the pollo salute that was described as chicken topped with marscapone, prosciutto, and a brandy mushroom sauce.  I didn't find any marscapone or prosciutto on top, but there was a mushroom sauce that reminded me of Campbell's Cream of  Mushroom soup.  I was certain they followed the recipe on the can.  I had a side of penne pasta covered in the bland marinara and vegetables.  The vegetables were good.  I didn't really understand the pasta in marinara since the chicken had a sauce already on it.  Why the two completely different sauces?\nI asked for more bread to fill myself up because I didn't want to finish my food and it was taken away after I ate one piece.  It was terrible service and since I used a restaurant.com gift certificate, gratuity was automatically added on.  The food was terrible.  How did it get all these great reviews?

It was kinda disappointing with the first couple dancers because they seemed to be more interested in staring at themselves in the mirrors to see how hard they could frown so it got a few doubts going but then some AMAZING dancers blew our minds! \n\nTwo girls in particular stuck with us for a while and gave us ALL lap dances and did some really crazy tricks on the chairs. $7 lap dances?? sign us up!!! We all agreed, who needs Christie's $20 dances when we can get gorgeous ladies and great music here! \n\nBTW-The music was just FABULOUS! Lots of variety (lil rap not much, lots of rock like Metallica, lil punk) so everyone in our group was rocking out hardcore-in more ways then one ;)\n \nGuys, girls, lesbians (we saw a few)-no matter-The Candy Store will take care of you all :D \n\nGo get your jelly watch on!!!", "business_id": "e6i8v7VkD8yJk02PH4d9VA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-11-05", "type": "review"}

I'm fine watching from a distance, thank you.  I just have to awkwardly look like I'm into it while you're getting more enjoyment out of it than . Lets skip me, just buy yourself a lap dance.

A man and woman are in North Phoenix meeting some friends at Sala Thai for dinner at 6:30. With so much time to spare, they decide to grab an alcoholic beverage.

They have a train that runs along the ceiling of most of the place.  It's fun to watch.  We love to come here for the yummy drinks (they just added a new drink menu with awesome sounding fruity drinks - YAY!) and their Philly cheese steaks, which are big and cooked to perfection.  I believe on Thursdays they offer cheese steaks for a percentage off.  They have all kinds of things on the menu, not just bar food - pizza and wings, down home favorites, Mexican items.  There is a nice mix and I still haven't tried it all.  We love their potato skins and cheese curds.  Gotta have those since this is a Wisconsin bar - land of cheese!  My particular fave item to order is Chicken Fried Chicken.  You get two breaded breast pieces with white gravy, mashed potatoes with white gravy, a roll with butter and the best sauteed vegetable I have ever had at a restaurant.  I am not sure what they do to them but I thought about them for a week and had to go back again just to have them again.  This place is a mile from us and our favorite local hangout.

Anywho...when I went on Thursday is was 95% country with 5% line dances and random \"Cha Cha slide\", \"Cupid Shuffle\"-esque songs.\n\n\nBUT....when I went on Saturday.....it was a complete 180. It was the same clientele for the most part but you would think you were out in Tempe somewhere about to get schwasted and shake your groove thang. I mean it was so much rap and R&B music! A lot of people looked uncomfortable until they started playing country again. It was an interesting dynamic for me because I was completely sober that night, but hey....if I go out I'm gonna dance :)!

The atmosphere has gotta better since management has given the whole bar an updated look, which has been well over due. The staff is genuinely friendly and no one can really argue with 50 cent drinks. However when going to bar I expect to be at a place that is 21 and up. That isn't the case here. Whiskey river has numerous regulars that are under 21 and instead of taking action against those regulars, they are allowed to continue to enter this establishment. In fact the manager greets these under age regulars with a smile and usually results in some type of photo that ends up on Facebook. \n\nNow on to the DJ, granted I wasn't the biggest fan of the previous DJ since there were times he was incredibly rude for no apparent reason. Now seeing that the previous DJ would yell at those country dancers doing tricks past 9 it seems the new DJ has a positive note however he has more negatives than positives going for him. He doesn't play songs that are requested by the customers and it appears that he is only concerned with getting the mixes he has created heard. Normally I wouldn't have a problem with this but after listening to hip hop and rap for over an hour, I tend to grow impatient especially when I have gone to the DJ booth and requested a song and I am informed that the manager wants him to continue to play hip hop and rap. I'm sure he does..\n\nAs much as I love to country dance, I'd rather do it at a bar that doesn't allow under age customers and where the DJ actually plays requested songs instead of his personal creations.", "business_id": "gOlJQuE3WYeMgXXDKYfdeg", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-11-19", "type": "review"}

Just stumbled in yesterday and Judy the bartender made me feel welcome like I had been a regular for years.  They don't have a huge selection of liquor but they have all of the essentials and they have enough high end stuff to make me happy. I dont think as a bar you need to carry every vodka known to man but I would like to see something more than Smirnoff and Stoli.  Although I am not a smoker myself, their back patio is really cool. Again not the nicest patio in the valley but I love that they make the most of this small space with creative furniture and a real cozy feel.  They have a ton of board games which I think is really great.  They have a few dart boards,  a necessity for any bar.  I think they thing I like most is Judy was telling me about all of the fun activities and events the owners plan for their customers.  I guess when Betty White hosted SNL last spring they had a big viewing party there.  And this past Monday Night during the Packers-Bears game they had Brats for the Cheese-Heads and Real Chicago dogs for the Bears fans.  What a creative and fun idea. \n\nAnother thing I live about this place is a wonderful, 30 ft long wooden bar. You have got to see this thing.  It's fantastic. \n\nI guess the only think I can think of why they dont get 5 stars is because they dont open until 2pm every day.

My fiancee stop there once or  a week to see Maggie (who is only the best bartender in the world) she is pretty sexy funny and really a great person. She has become one of our good friends. Other than Maggie it's a mixed crowd, everybody is pleasant. You meet some interesting people there. One of my greatest stories comes from being at Eddie's with  my fiancee on a Saturday night at around midnight. We see one of the regulars we know a black guy from Detroit who also became a good friend. His name was Charles, whom I called him Sir Charles. He was always dressed very nice and was clearly from the hood, which he would love to tell us stories about. Well on this particular night Charles was telling us about his sports jersey business. He claimed he could get any replica NBA jersey of any basketball player from any era for $50.00. Well I had to call bullshit on that one. He asked what do you want. I told him there was no way he could fulfill my request. He said in a true \"Detroit street hustler style\" bring it on bitch. I laughed and said ok fucko I'll pay you double If you get me a 1969 New York Knick #10 Walt Frazier home jersey size xxxL He smirked and said what will you give me if I had it here in 15 minutes. Knowing He could not possibly deliver I told  him I'd double it again $200. As fast as the words came out of my mouth he was on his way out the door telling me it was 12:18am and he would be back in 12 min. My fiancee and I laughed, and went back to finishing our cocktails. No lie in 11 min he was back at Eddies with a size xxxl walt frazier #10 New York Knick home jersey, asking me what time is it,and what time did I leave. He continued You have the nerve to doubt Sir charles ( all in a jesting manner). After a moment of utter shock I smiled, and said I never did but that was magic. I pulled out my cash and peeled off 200 large and put it in his hand and we gave each other a big hug. He bought drinks the rest of the night. Since then we had seen him  at Eddies a few times and then lost touch with each other. We moved and had not been to Eddies for several months. I asked Maggie had she seen Charles, she looked at me with sadness and said, yo didn't hear. To which I said hear what? Pretty much knowing it was bad. Maggie told us a few weeks ago Charles was killed in a car accident. My jaw dropped and sadness overwhelmed me and tears filled my eyes. My fiancee also was overcome with sadness. Well, Sir Charles Thank you for the great story, and the times we shared. You are fondly remembered and loved by your friends Bill & Margie, and Maggie. As well as many others I'm sure. If you have never been to Eddies stop there and ask Maggie to tell you story about Sir Charles buy a shot and toast to Sir Charles. Im sure he is selling jerseys in heaven.

Tuesday nights is wing night, $0.25 wings, and its a damn good deal if you're into wings. The only catch is, that you have to buy a soda to get the special pricing. I kind of have an issue, if I drink a lot of soda and eat of lot of wings, the combination is bad about 20 minutes after I finish eating and I get home. \n\nWhat's worse, is that sometimes some waiters will make your whole table get drinks for the deal, and sometimes they won't. However, do they really have to make me feel bad for not getting drinks? I'm not easily embarassed with my family, but when this happens on multiple occasions, you get annoyed. Aside from this issue, the servers are friendly and nice. Drinks are refilled often, food is brought out fresh and hot.\n\nWow, does this place have a ton of wing flavors. Almost all of the wing flavors are solid. I really enjoy all the possibilities. They don't charge for ranch like other places (I'm talkin' to you BWW), and they have ample amounts of veggies with each order. If you're in the mood for wings, I suppose this is one of the best places you can go to if you want to sample different flavors. The wings are also sized well compared to...BWW. \n\nI've tried a few things other than wings here, and to be quite honest I'm not impressed at all. If this place didn't have wings, it might have closed down a while ago.\n\nThe atmosphere is very weird. Wing nights are usually full of immature high school students, and like Devon said, they're just plain bigots. I'm not surprised that the atmosphere of this place is very 'bar-like', like you see in the movies. Just imagine a typical southern bar...\n\nI'm a colored person, and when I go here, I don't feel very welcome by the crowd. It's harsh to rate the restaurant on this, because I feel that this isn't the restaurant's fault, but I'd like to be comfortable when I eat.\n\nBefore I moved and experienced better hot wings, I would have rated this place 5-star. I went to this place at least 2-3 times a month. While I was away from Phoenix I happened to let my taste buds experience some succulent and better hot wings. The hot wings here are just very plain, no individuality to them. Throughout my travels, I've had some interesting hot wings that were especially unique. While the honey hot, teriyaki, and Parmesan dusted are all good flavors, I can only have so much of them. The service also brings this down a star.\n\nAlso, it'd be great if this place did get a little bit more diverse. There are no sports bars that show futbol (I'm talking about soccer) games. I would gladly come here in the mornings to watch some European soccer (ESPN2 shows a lot of matches in the morning). However, I feel like this is such a closed sports bar in terms of diversity.

It definitely could have used a step up or two in flavor.   \n\nFor dessert I got a piece of  cheesecake to go with strawberries.   It was a good portion,  but just average in flavor.

Pair their chardonnay or pinot noir with a bruschetta or caprese salad appetizer, and you'll find yourself in palette nirvana. \n\nThe place boasts a cozy, off-the-beaten-path feel. You walk in and are immediately transported to a more relaxed, come-as-you-are, drink-as-much-as-you-want atmosphere that offers dining tables, comfy chairs and couches and a short bar. Inside the colors are true to wine bar standards - on the dark side, encouraging to just let your tense shoulders relax. Lucy's place is a delightful find - a hard throw away from the trendy places you'll find in strip malls or in popular Scottsdale locations. In fact, it's nowhere near Scottsdale, nor does it pretend to be anything except what it is - a wine bar that offers you a wide selection, impeccable service and an atmosphere you aren't quick to leave. \n\nWhen I went, they had live acoustic music - a one man show playing the likes of Ryan Adams and Wilco. It was the perfect addition to a satisfying happy hour experience. \n\nPlus, Lucy has a couple small TVs hanging in view, in case you need to catch the baseball scores (it so happened to be turned onto the Red Sox game). \n\nI didn't want to leave. That in and of itself tells me Lucy's Place is a rare find. I'd give it 5 stars if it were in my neighborhood. It's a short trek southward, but definitely worth a regular visit if you're in the area or just in the mood for wine that'll satiate your palette, along with a relaxed atmosphere that'll assuage your workday woes.\n\nhttp://my-wine-cellar.com/lucys_place.htm", "business_id": "Our6bzte5W1wlIeOu9luug", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-10-15", "type": "review"}

It's not your typical Phoenix restaurant. There was white table cloth. The waiters were all formally dressed.  It had a live jazz singer.  I was a little taken aback because it has the ambience of a fine steak restaurant like a Donovans as opposed to a nice Italian restaurant.  It was a nice change of scenery from your usual west coast trendy yet casual Phoenix restaurant ambience. \n\nThe service was also excellent.  Our waiter was hyper animated which was a little annoying yet appreciated because he was attentive.  Overall the service was nearly perfect. All the waiters had manners and were old school in their mannerism. Again, this was a welcome change from the trendy young stud or hot girl who act like they are too cool to be serving tables. \n\nIn regards to the food....DISAPPOINTING.  I was really shocked. I really wanted to like this place but the food had no flavor.  There is nothing about the food that would make one want to go back.  The eggplant parmegan was sloppy and watery egglant that tasted like boiled egglant.  The tortalleni ruffino was served in an alfredo sauce that tasted like potato soup poured onto pasta. It was so thick and tasteless. The tortelini had no flavor and it's filling was bland. \n\nThe restaurant does some things to provide one with a homely feel. They serve garlic bread toasts as free appetizers and constantly refresh it. The jazz music in the background was also a nice touch.

Otherwise, it would have been a zero star review. Everything there could use a lot of improvement. Upon arriving we were greeted by a hostess who seemed to be confused about where to seat us, although the restaurant was mostly unoccupied, with the exception of the small bar area. This led to her being bickered at by what ended up being our waitress. We were then seated by the manager with no menus. I went to the ladies room to wash my hands before our meal, where I was enjoying the lovely music.... just as it was abrubtly turned off. There was no music for the rest of our visit. When we finally got some menus (and bread upon request), we ordered some drinks. I ordered a rum and coke, and my date ordered a coffee. Don't let their happy hour advertising fool you! There is NO HAPPY HOUR at Ruffino's restaurant. Although they do have a happy hour in the small bar area, if you sit even 10 feet away from it, you do not get to enjoy the special drink prices. I was misled and ended up paying full price for a drink, that if ordered a few feet away would have been half price! My date's coffee came out lukewarm, and when our appetizers arrived I had wished I ordered something else. My dates salad was pretty tasty, but my tortellini en brodo soup was awful. It was some chicken bouillon water with overcooked pasta, that had no hint of the meat it had suggested existed in it. Our entrees arrived quite a while later, and our table still hadn't been bussed since the appetizers. Both of our entrees were pretty darn tasty, but both were only lukewarm again. Not hot at all. Then there was a baby screaming with no music playing to distract me from the wailing infant. The waitress was snippy and seemed to be in a bad mood. And even with a lady following the waitress around for training, couldn't seem to bring out a box for my food and a requested cup of coffee. The service was just slow and almost snotty. So, I really wouldn't recommend it. It is too overpriced for a place with a hit and miss menu and very poor service.\nAlso, I ordered the Chicken Florentine, which is supposedly a stuffed chicken breast. But, it was actually only just topped with the ingredients listed. It also doesn't come with a knife, so I had to attempt cutting it up with a butter knife.

We used to come in every month or two. However, we had a bad experience on Mother's Day and I wrote a note to the management and still haven't received a response. The service was beyond terrible that day and the place was packed because of a huge first communion party. There was a table of 10 unsupervised children right by us that were loud. The adults were sitting a few tables away and basically ignored them until it came time to serve cake. We asked the manager to do something and were ignored. There were issues with our order, slow service and an unpleasant experience. This saddens me because they have great food, but the service and execution just isn't there. We haven't been back since Mother's Day, and at this point I don't know if we will return because I don't feel like a valued customer.

We had to go up to the bar multiple times to ask for our drinks to be refilled, to give our food order and for the check (which I thought was strange because he was giving 2 other tables, table side service). Anyway, we asked for split checks (my husband and myself and then the other couple on another). She brought out a hand written slip with totals on them. Not itemized just totaled. So I simply requested an itemized receipt and she lost her mid. She snatched the checks from my husbands hand and asked why I needed it that way. She leaves and comes back with the same receipts and and says I'm sorry yours is 3 dollars less. I told her I didn't care about the price I still wanted an itemized receipt showing the items I was paying for. Yet again.... She snatched them from my hands leaves and comes back with the original totals on the same freaking receipts and says with attitude, \"this is the total due\". It was the original price and still not itemized. I was so annoyed that she couldn't just give me an itemized receipt like ANY other establishment would give. I hand her money and go sit down. Rebecca had the audacity to walk up to my table and put her hands on her hips and ask me what my problem was and why I was questioning her. I got so mad and told her that she should have a good night and I tried to exit the establishment but she stood in front of my husband on the booth so he couldn't get out and asked again what my problem was. After requesting for her to move about 3 times we leave and walk out to our car, darling Rebecca walks out on the patio and tells the previous bartender with brunette hair that I was and I quote. \"A bitch\" and saying all kinds of other ridiculousness. I will never return. She is a shitty server who obviously works at this kind of place at 45 years old because she has ZERO customer service skills.

It came with gari & a healthy pat of hot wasabi. My husband loved his Szechwan Shrimp & Chicken in Spiced Garlic Sauce  ($11.95). Our business acquaintence ordered Orange Chicken  ($12.25) that he likes so much he orders it every time.\n\nService was great. There was a small variety of beers on tap. Chopsticks right on the table. My only beef was that the pre-wrapped silverwear had chunks of food still stuck to it, and the napkin is too flimsy to serve as a lap napkin or to wipe the soup off your face.\n\nAll in all, the great variety on the menu, good service, tasty food, unique atmosphere,  and moderate prices make this a solid choice for lunch or dinner.", "business_id": "QzXFdjIbFRGhzL83goPPLA", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-09-05", "type": "review"}

Went there last weekend because my wife & I agreed that the previous visit 6mos earlier \"food was better\" so let's find out if that was a fluke or not.\n\nI ordered wings - hands down best Arizona wings I've had in years. Big, meaty, not over or under cooked, plenty of sauce, bluecheese & veggies good and didn't annoyingly charge me extra for extra bluecheese. I asked \"are these the normal wings\" and server (who ranked a solid A- for my 6-person family) replied yes. Wasn't too busy so they gave us a large out of the way table that was perfect for my semi-obnoxious 1 yr old and little 6-year old girls. They got crayons, good kids meals, good portions including drink, they liked the atmosphere so all was good w/kids. Bar atmosphere is kind of lively with TV's everywhere so it was fun.\n\nMy wife's grilled chicken sandwich was nothing to write home about - but then again when is a chicken sandwich anything spectacular? Fries were crispy. She wanted a craft beer but before spending 4 bucks on that asked for a shot or small taster and server had no problem with that. She didn't like it and ordered something else, but that shows good service and willingness to please customer with no boloney.\n\nBottom line is that after 8pm it's a bar but we weren't rushed out, it wasnt too rowdy and we were made to feel welcome. It's been two trips now where food was really quite good and we were all nodding in agreement that we shall return soon.", "business_id": "d-rZazFFYvnjRZUhLTEUZg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-10-24", "type": "review"}

Both establishments  have the notion that because they are in Anthem, that there is magic fairy dust that makes them special.  For Legends, inconsistency has been the constant.  None of the good servers that use to be there are there any longer.  People mainly go in to hit the bar, it's kind of the local hook up place to some extent.  Most of the time their music sucks also.  \n\nSo most of the comments are correct.  Sometimes it's good, other times not.

But tonight I was attending the evening show of Phantom of the Opera and wanted to get in somewhere close for a fast meal. Again, when thinking of a fast meal, Olive Garden doesn't usually come to mind with the traditional full lobby and line out the door - but as I drove past, I noticed parking...and it was about 5:15 pm, so I took a chance it would not be at capacity.\n\nI was immediately seated and the waiter, Stu, arrived quickly. He provided the free sample of Chardonnay, which actually was pretty good. I ordered the eggplant parmesan with salad. The salad arrived immediately and was the standard Olive Garden salad. Warm, fresh breadsticks were brought with the salad. As I neared the end of the salad, the entr\u00e9e arrived. It was good and very filling. I was out the door and headed out by 6:00 PM.\n\nThe reason I decided to Yelp Olive Garden was the impressive service. Stu was very attentive, quick with the water refill, fast delivery of the salad and bread. He even risked burning his hands on the extremely hot plate for the entr\u00e9e as the pot holder could not be located quickly.

I am bound to offend some of you \"Chain restaurant\" haters but here goes... \nOlive Garden has become the brunt of many jokes over the years and even had a clever and hilarious skit done on Mad TV years ago. The main complaint I have heard time and time again is that the food is not \"authentic.\" No comments about the food being bad or bland, just that its not \"authentic.\" Ok I will agree that the food may not be \"authentic\" from my perspective of what Italian food should be. My grandfather was 100% Italian and I ate much of his Italian food growing up. That is what I consider \"authentic\" Italian food to be. Here's the thing though... I have never been to Italy and I am sure that most of the people complaining about OG's authenticity havn't been either. So who are we to know that its not authentic in some area of Italy? I am fairly sure its not and you can bet that when I do visit Italy inside and out (which will hopefully be in the next year), I will be yelping another review on the OG just to say if it is indeed \"authentic.\"\nOne thing I can vouch for with Olive Garden is that most of the items I have tried there are delicious and their bread-sticks are like crack! Sure sure, laugh and knock me as much as you want but I know that everyone that has had OG likes at least one thing. You can slam OG but you have either liked their bread-sticks, soup, salad, or some kind of entree. Anyways, to address the point I am trying to make: a good restaurant (chain or not) should have good food and I can say that Olive Garden does have good food. Their soups are delicious (try the chicken gnocchi or the zuppa Tuscana), the bread-sticks are light, airy and buttery with the right amount of garlic flavor, and although the salad is nothing special vegi wise, the dressing is one of the better Italian dressings out there and is very refreshing. For entrees, they make the one of the best eggplant Parmesans and fettuccine Alfredos I have ever had, the stuffed chicken Marsala is unique but delicious, and their seafood portifino is rich and creamy with a generous amount of perfectly cooked seafood. The desserts are equally as delicious, my favs being the apple crostada and the black tie mousse cake. \nThe service has always been decent although you may get an occasional slow waiter. However, I can say that most times I walk away satisfied with the overall experience. The price and value is terrific too. Come on, how many other \"Italian\" places you know of where you can get bread, salad/ soup, and big bowl of pasta for less then 15.00? Not very many, that's for sure!\nMy only complaints: Too family friendly and sometimes there are screaming kids, however, with a few bowls of  delicious soup and pasta, I can sometimes manage to drown it out. Also, years ago, I ordered nothing but their cannelloni al forno (pasta tubes filled with meat and topped with cheese, Alfredo and marinara sauce). My precious dish was taken away from me and replaced with \"three meat ravioli\" which was close so I kept getting that. Then that was removed from the menu. I started getting \"classics\" after that that I was sure would not be removed from the menu like eggplant parm. But for dessert, I fell in love with their chocolate molten cake with vanilla cream and strawberries. Guess what happened? Yep, it was taken away from me  :(  I have also heard numerous complaints about how a special one month will be terrific but a month later, its no longer available and is never to be seen again. I wish the OG would stop replacing good meal items and also bring back some of the popular past specials so people can enjoy them again. I also wish that one of those specials will be the cannalloni al forno. If that was the case, I would go there for a month straight and order it. OG, stop changing out good menu items.

I am from Michigan and sorry to say am I big Lions fan. I gave my bar up per our weekly switch-off(as a true loving couple would do) to come here weekly, that's how fun it is.\n\nThe owners Steve and Renee will remember you name and maybe your order if you tip well. Great people that provide a no frills good time.\nNo food other than 2 pizza choices, a true Minnesota bar, during the games they have a pot luck. Yes, you bring something and have Renee set it up in the back. You can expect all the northern favorites; chili, pickle roll-ups, chicken wings, cheese trays, lil smokies etc.\n\nBooze, super cheap!!(cash only, atm onsite)\nGreat Beer selection, lot of local and national crafts along with norms. Great choices for you mixed drinkers out there also.\n\nIf you are coming for a Football Sunday, they do have the package, but only 5 TVs. Yes, you read that correct. Place can only hold 100 people according to the sign on the wall. But 4 at least will be on the Vikings game, if you're lucky and catch Steve in a good mood he may put one (above the jukebox) on your game (no sound). With that being said if your team is playing against the Vikings, it's also a good time.\n\nAll around a great place with great people, so happy we found this place, we found friends for life!", "business_id": "rjjEN8QTMvilB08ImFyMow", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-11-20", "type": "review"}

The obvious big draw to this place is the massive organ and the very talented organist. Truly impressive and charming. While we were there he played several songs, all from different genres. My very busy bodied 7-year-old was very entertained. \n\nWhen you first enter the restaurant you go up to the counter to order. We ordered a simple pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and mushrooms. We also ordered a \"small salad\" which is salad bar style, but there are several signs up that ask that you only take one trip to the salad bar. Lame. And again, seems like cheap skate business to me. Then when we went to pay, found out that they take CASH ONLY -No debit or credit cards. This is such a pet peeve of mine. It is 2014. Who carries cash anymore?! Add $0.05 to each item to cover the costs of having a credit card machine and call it good. Quit being ridiculous! They do have an ATM in the restaurant so, we quickly got cash out and then went to order our drinks....which are down the side of the counter and you pay separately for as well.  Again, annoying. Why are the multiple stations necessary?? \n\nThe dinning area is seat yourself and we found a nice little spot in the corner. It was very busy but we could still see pretty well. You are given a number on your receipt and the numbers go up on a big board in the dinning area, similar to a bingo board. Our pizza was ready pretty quickly but, the food was mediocre, at best, and very overpriced for what we got. For the large pizza, two small salads, and two sodas- it was just over $40. For a dinner out, that is pretty typical for that kind of order but, again- I was annoyed by the lack of service and inconveniences, and when I go out to eat, I want the food to be fantastic...this wasn't.\n\nI would however, highly recommend checking this place out AFTER having dinner somewhere else.

I was visiting my buddy for a long time again. We were greeted at the hostess stand and we did not have to wait (granted it was around 8:40pm). We waited a long time till the waitress came by. Jessie or Jessica or Jennifer  something. At first she came immediately then (to my utter disappointment she dissappear ed for 20 minutes). Another waitress was wondering if we had been helped and even asked others where our waitress was. It was an embarrassing moment. We saw a server who has helped is before and the server greeted us.... We were not at that server's table. She even talked to that server as she pasted. Okay maybe she doesn't know I haven't been here before. I will give her that. It continues to get worse. \n Finally  when she came around she made the person I came with so uncomfortable they left. The reason? They were of a certain gender and ethnicity and status and appearance, and I was not. 99% of contact was addressed to my buddy. It was obvious from the way they offered that soup and salad was free and insisted I should take it home to that person (this is after I absolutely refused twice any soup, salad or cheese from them) the reason why my buddy left. This was unacceptable. How would they k ow if i am staying or visiting my buddy? Nope, just more assumptions. If a customer refuses a food item, the server should respect his or her wishes. This was only the begining. \n   The other server brought me food. I understand if the restaurant was busy, but that was slightly rude. Okay, maybe she had something to do in the mostly, now nearly empty restaurant. I feel better when my entr\u00e9e finally arrived at 9:30pm. One hour later after I sat down. That's fine. Suddenly, crunch. A shell on a 'shell-less shrimp' . Thank goodness I took a picture. However, she suddenly  came to take the plate away before I can take the close up of the shells. (First picture is the first one I took. It describes this moment.) I ask for another. She asks that it will be taken off the bill, BUT she asks if I wanted this shrimp boxed.... Why would any sane person want the shrimp they asked to be taken away boxed? First of all I can only assume she thinks I am doing funny things to get free shrimp. I refuse anything of that notion. Secondly, I can only assume she thinks I am younger than most by my appearance only or because I am a certain ethnicity. I was never offered a sample of wine (even when I was with my buddy). Other times we were asked our age first then offered wine, but no this service was worse. I noticed at this a table with 11 people of a certain favorable age, favorable appearance, and ethnicity had already been served and left while I  wait. \n So I was not happy and feeling quite disgusted at this point. I get the shrimp now and behold. Fewer shrimp plus shells. It smells like it was reheated (for the 15 minutes I had to wait). Thank  goodness I took a picture. It is obviously shown below the difference. I did not touch or eat anything on that plate for fear it had been tampered with. The manager was called in. I do not  believe she offered a name. She Offered to take the bill except for the appatiser I ate. I refused and paid the entire bill with cash because I was being nice. I left but forgot I would like to write a comment. Behold, it was past 10 already and the Hostess would not let me back in. Even though she saw me walk out a few minutes ago. Why? 'Safety reasons'. Probably because I was wearing a sweater, no makeup. I was finally let in due to the manager after waiting insistantly with the protesting hostess. At this point you can guess I was very upset. The manager asked if I wanted my change. That was the first thing she said to me. Not, how can I help you. Honey, I do not want money. ... probably once again from my ethnicity or age or appearance. I never raised my voice just insisted on writing a comment. Unfortunately, she tells me I cannot do that. Why? I paid in cash. Sure. I will pay in credit this time. Forget giving a message to the gm. I know that won't be delivered because 1 customer is not happy. Thank goodness for yelp and media. Well I definitely paid in credit just to write the comment. This comment is now on for  my friends on Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, instagram, mass posted on Whatsup and posted on my personal Web site along with pictures\n\n      Did I mention she was 'helping me' by trying to fill out my customer survey. I wasn't even the one to punch in a few answers and not even the one to physical punch in the amount of tip. Can you imagine a customer survey not completely filled by the CUSTOMER? \n\nThis dinner was over 1 and a half hours long for 1 meal for 1 person. Be ready for terrible service and sub-par food if you look a certain way. Be sure to also get lucky and have the good server as well. \n\nNo amount of breadsticks, salad, soup,  or cash is worth this.", "business_id": "bbmuF6LtbP51bk0Ia0p1rw", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-11-13", "type": "review"}

The manager came over and was completely clueless about how poor his staff was performing and how crappy the food was. He could have cared less.   He thinks schmoozing is going to make us forget the crap show they just put on?  Puleeze!!\n\nThat server should be spending his time in his station instead of hiding out in the kitchen until he HAS to come out.  That is a surefire way to fail to see what you need to see.\n\nMy fajitas tasted like the sizzling skillet they were on.  There was no other flavor there.  The side of beans and rice was a complete joke.  It was flavorless as well.  The cheese that came with the order seemed fake.   Don't sell Mexican food if you are going to fail to put any authentic flavors in.  I guess it serves me right for not going to a Mexican restaurant and just stick to fried appetizers at a place like this.\n\nReally, really disappointing.  I will not be back!!!  The quality is missing from the food.  The quality is missing from the service.  The quality is missing from the management.", "business_id": "cF0k2s8qq7c2qT1yBofuyg", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-09-13", "type": "review"}

It also had this big blob of butter on it but it was a garlic butter that thru off the whole plate. The whole thing tasted like the jar of garlic was old n turning ranced...you ever buy a big jar of garlic from Costco and you can't use it fast enough and its starts tasting funny..exactly how dinner tasted.

Then we found out that S' kids would be driving up from Yuma so they joined us too. When we got to the restaurant, we were told the Annabelle's is seasonal and they are closed cause it is now their off-season. WTF? Why didn't they tell me that when I called and made the reservation? So we had to eat in the grill (coffee shop) and the menu was like a burger joint menu with a few Annabelle additions to it. The apps were mediocre, the salad OK, the soup was good according to S, but our steaks were crappy. They only had sirloin as opposed to the thick cut NYC, and these steaks were about 1/2 inch thick. Everyone ordered theirs medium well, while I ordered my char-rare. Well, suffice it to say I got medium-well too! The steamed veggies were OK and the Parmesan fries were good. For dessert, K had chocolate lava cake, and the kids and S had cheese cake. Everyone said the desserts were OK, but nothing great. S said her cheesecake from Vegas is far superior. K said she thought they ran across the street to Jack-in-the-Box to get the cheesecake and choc lava cake that they ordered. Our server was good and efficient, but overall service was slow, since she was the only server there and she was also the bartender. WTF???!!!
