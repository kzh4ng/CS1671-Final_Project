The cinema is a bit of an institution and recent attempts to take it over or close it down have sparked huge uproar. Well done Edinburgh I say- it would be such a shame if this place lost any of its charm. The Sunday double bill is my favourite offering from this place- watching two films which are somehow related makes a real afternoon of a cinema trip. The bar area is also great and offers free wi-fi. Staff are lovely and drinks are reasonable. A great cinema!", "business_id": "vW_krCghxf4GYPRfkgZ06A", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-01-08", "type": "review"}

So kind of a mixture of eggs, bacon, bread and some salmon or haggis thrown in for good measure.\n\nBut if that's what you like, they do it well. I just had a breakfast roll, with a fried egg and bacon. The roll was nice and toasted and the egg perfectly fried. The other breakfasts looked awesome too, especially the full Scottish breakfast and the scrambled egg with salmon.\n\nThere's always a mixture of folk in Hamilton's, usually there's at least one dog and a few kids there too. It's a family place during the day, I'd say. So if you've got a raging hangover and want to avoid kid's on Nintendos asking awkward questions loudly, maybe steer clear. But if you like cute wee dogs and kids then it's all good.", "business_id": "KqgeyLdYbfsd9veyR6UGtw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-12-03", "type": "review"}

Id expect a wait like that for a complex order, but we're talking steak pie and chips and neither was much to write home about. \n\nGood selection of beers with a few decent labels on show so maybe a good place for a pre-town pint.

It was a busy night with everyone seemingly having a good time. \n\nDoor staff seemed pleasant enough, if somewhat disinterested. Service at the bar, once you could push your way past some very drunk and obnoxious lesbians, was quick but somewhat curt. A smile wouldn't go a miss. Drinks were reasonable with some decent offers on the go. Sounding good so far??\n\nA fight broke out....4 or 5 lesbians..The security staff were really quick to handle the fracas and looked to be well in control. However, moments later we were asked to leave. No reason given, just leave! I asked why were we being ejected and was told to shut the f--k up and get out if I knew what was good for me.\n\nI have never known anything like this in my life. We were standing having drinks and chatting then were suddenly set upon by these security personnel. Mistaken identity or what and despite our protestations, we were ejected from the venue.\n\nSumming up, unless you want to go to a venue crammed full of Hens, that think its cool to go Gay for the night, or want to be in the company of some really chav lesbians who bump and push their way through the venue, then this is one place that needs a wide berth. It is embarrassing to describe here as a Gay establishment.

The SPG (and consequently standard floor) rooms are much smaller than Club floor rooms.\n\nThe free wifi is slow, like terribly slow. The bed was comfortable and the temperature in the room was someone of a problem to control - it was too hot, then too cold, then too hot, etc.\n\nOverall, still a great hotel in a great location but I no longer rate it as the #2 hotel on my list of best hotels I've stayed in.
