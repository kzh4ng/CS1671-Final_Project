The claim to their reputation though was Lucy Sheets who used to sell banh mi outside their store.  Banh mi is a Vietnamese sandwich that is a French baguette with a sort of meat filling, pickled carrots and daikon, cilantro, jalapenos, and mayo.  Traditionally they also have pate, but the ones at My Ngoc don't have it.\n\nUnfortunately, the new owner informed me that Lucy has moved and set up shop in NYC.  However, they still do sell tasty roast pork or chicken banh mi.\n\nA warm French baguette is filled with the meat of choice and topped with the tasty ingredients.  The heat of the jalapenos are cooled by the pickled vegetables and the mayo helps bring all the ingredients together.  By Pittsburgh standards, it's worthy of 4 stars easy.  \n\nOn the other hand, their pho has much room for improvement.  The broth wasn't as savory and flavorful as I've had elsewhere and the noodles were a bit on the tougher side.\n\nA banh mi will run you $5-$6, which is definitely on the pricier side given it's size, but as a niche food in a small market, I'm definitely not complaining if I need my banh mi fix.

HOWEVER...having traveled to Vietnam, and having been to a wide variety of Vietnamese restaurants around the US, this is certainly one of the most authentic.

We added on the spring roll with shrimp - and it was obviously freshly handmade to our order. Great appetizer to begin with - it's my barometer of a Vietnamese restaurant. This was a good one, not the best I've ever had, but quite tasty. I followed this up with a green papaya salad - heavy on the fish sauce (yum!) and covered in shrimp and peanuts. Very refreshing and light. My friend ordered the chicken curry with yam, which was creamy, freshly made (the veggies were not overcooked, as you find most places that premake lots of food) and not too spicy. I ordered the spicy vegetable soup with mushrooms. I'm not your average diner, and I like my spicy foods VERY spicy. This was maybe a 1-2/10. Pretty disappointing to me, but luckily the table was equipped with homemade Sriracha-like sauce and the ubiquitous chili-in-oil sauce found in cafes all over Vietnam. This solved the problem.

A small is available as most Americans I bring here are unable to finish a bowl.\n\nSpring rolls are great (cold/fresh) with a peanut dipping sauce. The egg rolls are just amazingly full of flavor (fried) with a fish style dipping sauce. Place is very inexpensive too. Oh, this place is BYOB in terms of alcohol. Forgot to mention it's cash only.

We have both been to Tram's before but it has been awhile since our last visit.  Whenever we walked into the restaurant we saw that not much has changed except for maybe the addition of a flat screen TV.  The restaurant itself is small and maybe has seating at tables for about 30 people and the decorations are a little sparse.  The easiest thing to see is that they have won a ton of awards which are hanging up on the back wall.  Beyond that it is still a hole in the wall divey type of place that is cash-only with excellent food.  \n \nAlmost immediately after we sat down the owner asked us if we were ready to order.  At that point we were not ready.  The menu here isn't that big but it doesn't need to be since what they do make is very good.  About two minutes later the owner was back and ready to take our order.  This time we were ready.  My fiance and I decided to split some eggrolls and then for my entree I went with the beef vermicelli with conconut milk.\nThe eggrolls came out at the same time as the meals and were so hot temperature wise that both my fiance and myself left them until after we had eaten our entrees.  My vermicelli ended up being really good with the sauce providing the perfect flavor to the dish.  I don't know how they do it but they do a great job of infusing a ton of flavors into it.  The noodles in it were also good and the beef was better than expected.  After I had finished my vermicelli I ended up grabbing my eggrolll which was still somehow hot.  While the flavor on it wasn't that great, what I really loved about it was the textures that it provided.  It was cooked perfectly and so the shell had a great crispy exterior while the interior with the vegetables had a softer texture.  Overall it was another solid meal at Tram's for me.\n \nThe bottom line for me is that I will definitely be back here again in the future.   Whats not to like about a place where the food is not only cheap but also delicious?  Just be careful in that it is cash only and I know at one point they were BYOB although I am not sure if that is still the case.", "business_id": "dxCqGkhtXq-9fYEsX7Mf6Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-05-09", "type": "review"}

It's served with with Nuoc Cham, a traditional sweet/sour/salty dressing with grated carrots. Cost: $4.75.\n\nI also recommend the roll appetizers.

I have grown up in Asian restaurants and really, despite all the negative reviews, this place isn't that scary! If you're looking for ambiance, well, maybe you should save this one for another day. I can't say I've ever been to a Vietnamese restaurant where the decorations blew me away. However, if you are craving some mighty decent Vietnamese cuisine, you have arrived at your destination.\n\nI grew up on Oahu where Pho places are like McDonalds- they are practically on every corner. It being one of my favorite foods, I've been to a great many restaurants for pho, and have tried to find a place that can fill that big beef noodle soup void in my heart..( or stomach.. same thing) since moving to Arizona. I've come to the conclusion that there is nothing in Tucson. Chandler, however, is fortunate enough to have this little gem.\n\nThe bowls are large and very affordable.  The easiest difference to distinguish between pho places is the broth. Saigon has a pretty good broth, and offers almost all the right condiments. The only thing this place is missing is sate, which is like chili oil with garlic or shallots, and culantro. If only I could figure out what it's called in Vietnamese... Large in size with sharp edges, it is similar to cilantro but more subtle and slightly sweet. These, while a major drawback for me, are minor for the overall quality found here at Saigon. The beauty of pho is that it arrives light and fairly simple. Its up to you to customize your own bowl to your individual taste. \n\nThe spring rolls are good, served properly dressed with lettuce leaves and mint for wrapping with traditional sweet sour fish sauce for dipping. If you like coffee, you haven't lived until you have had a Vietnamese iced coffee. No. Seriously.\n\nAnd a small but hugely fantastic thing? They have fresh coconuts that you can order to drink the juice out of! And eat the coconut flesh after of course.. Mmmm\n\nSo while this isn't the best pho I've ever had in my life, it IS the best I've had in Arizona so far.", "business_id": "jJlOPkv4Xl6vxNzr51fnYw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-03-29", "type": "review"}

If Justina was a gay man, she would make a great drag queen.  I think she's a hoot, but her outlandish behavior and brash comments do not work for everyone.  \n\nI have a very dear friend who lives in Chandler and she and I would go into Cyclo quite often.  My friend is married with three kids, but just she and I would go in.  She would always tell Justina about her family and show her pictures of the kids.  Justina really gets into teasing the customers and after a couple of years, she told my friend, \"You crazy fag-hag.  You never bring your family in here.  You just come in with your gay friend.  You don't even have a family.  Crazy Lady, you just carry around those pictures to make your lonely self feel better.\"  Justina also plays up the Vietnamese accent.  She can be off-putting at first if you don't know what's up, but the floor show never disappoints if you're willing to play along.\n\nThe food is good enough now, but it was better when the restaurant first opened.  The star dishes include Tom Rang Hat Tieu, an appetizer of shrimp on toasted baguette slices with a savory black pepper sauce that is plate lickin' good.  Another delicious starter is Banh Xeo.  It's a crispy rice crepe with shrimp, pork, sprouts, and lettuce leaves for wrapping the crepe slices before you eat them.  For entrees, Ca Ri Ga is a tasty chicken and pineapple curry and Com Tam is a mixed grill of a marinated pork chop, beef, shrimp, and egg over broken rice.  As a side dish, the Dau Xanh Xao Toi is a sublime preparation of spicy garlic green beans with chili and sweet soy.  \n\nHowever, the quality now varies.  The last time I went the pineapple curry was totally bland.  Even though I have eaten at this place many times, I didn't say anything because I didn't want to be bothered with Justina's reaction.  Instead, I haven't been back.  \n\nI have been into Cyclo when Justina was not there and the quality of the food was nowhere near the same in her absence.  My concern is that Justina has announced plans (yet again) to open a second Cyclo in the Valley.  This time it's supposed to be on Central Avenue south of Camelback and across from Brophy with a fall 2008 opening.  Once that place opens, I assume Justina will move her floor show to central Phoenix and I am left to wonder if the quality of the food will continue to slip in Chandler.\n\nCyclo has a BYOB policy and some people are really into it.  For me, it's not a huge selling point.  I prefer not to schlep my own booze to a restaurant, but it's cool if you're into it.\n\nIf you go to Cyclo, hope that Justina is there.  You're really going to Cyclo for Justina's antics rather than the food.", "business_id": "UIGFrEcoDsw05I1UOrxdOA", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-05-28", "type": "review"}

I wanted to order a dessert but the waiter dropped the check and ran off. We were seated for barely 20 minutes and were being rushed. When he came back to the table I was going to ask for dessert but he didn't give me a chance. He said abruptly, \"Sorry, please pay.\" RUDE He stood there as I dug my credit card from my purse. I felt uncomfortable. My friend asked for boxes for the food uneaten. on our way out the door I heard our waiter rushing another table of 6 people. He mentioned something about a shift change.

The bowl it came in looked very small and deceiving, but as I was working my way through the bowl I could not finish it. The broth was very clear and tasty. It was so appetizing that I kept wanting to eat more but my stomach couldn't hang.", "business_id": "FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-04-08", "type": "review"}

The bathroom smells like a petting zoo at Kim Long, and there were roaches on the floor. The parking is crowded and it smells like an armpit. Trust me, I've been to many pho places in garden grove and Westminster and this place is schwag. \n\nAlso, you'll like what happened there: \n\nThere is a nice looking girl at the front (employee) that drives an expensive benz, and my buddy quietly said \"oh, that's a nice looking girl\". Nobody at my table cared and our conversation moved on to gambling talk. Then, the bus boy strolled up to our table and instead of asking if everything was alright, rudely said \"how do you know my fiance, and why are you talking about her\". I almost started laughing because a thought it was a joke, but the guy was mad. \n\nI walked up to the manager and expressed my concern, then I asked the girl why her fiance was bugging us. She said she is not engaged, and definitely not to the bus boy, lol. Then mysteriously the bus boy became silent and disappeared. The kitchen cleared out like there was going to be a fight, in fact the waiter called them up front like an old kung fu movie. It was disrespectful to all the customers, my table, the girl, and embarrassing to mgmt and the bus boy. \n\nWhat a weird place, I also think he might have thought we were talking about the girl because my fiend's name is genny and maybe that was her name, but what a bunch of foolishness. \n\nEither way, if you are not trying out for a kung fu movie where you have to fight the whole staff, I suggest going elsewhere. This is not the best pho, and they are not the best listeners. They are quick to judge. It smells and has bugs. \n\nI will be sure to only stop here if I have to take a dump.", "business_id": "FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-04-12", "type": "review"}

We ordered, ate, then I went to go pee.  I get back, and my homie says 'hey genny theres your girl'.  Cool, I was gonna say what up when we left.  Note that nothing disrespectful was said!\n\nBut then little asian gumby the BUSBOY had to come and butt in our convo.  Now if you're gonna step up, step up correct.  He comes in with his head down, whispering 'why you talkin about my fiance?'  Then he just leaves.  I barely heard what he said, so I was like is dude serious?  I was gonna let it slide and talk to pretty girl when we left, but big homie Bolo Eddie had to go see what was up with gumby, and thats when the managers got scared and started callin the mexis workin in the back to come in.

There's just something about a hot bowl of pho when you are very drunk in Vegas.\n\nThe egg rolls are very good. Crunchy and tasty, the sauce on the other hand it's not the best for me, but I'm sure someone out there will love it.\n\nThis place always seems to have a line during it's late night operations. Which is understandable, considering that the waiting staff is down to either 1 or 2 people and they are running around like mad to cater to 9-12 different tables with each having a party of 3-7.\n\nThe atmosphere and decor is rather simple, nothing chic or upscale.

I was very excited to see that this was 24 hours because pho is my late night choice for food.\n\nEverytime I try a pho place I usually get their combo pho.  In this case, for about $7.99 I got a medium sized bowl of pho with some meat in it.  I wish the bowl was larger, and that the broth would have more flavor to that.  In my opinion, it was a bit plain.  However, the servers here were very nice, and got us our food right away after ordering.\n\nI would come back to try some of the non pho items on the menu, which looked plentiful.
