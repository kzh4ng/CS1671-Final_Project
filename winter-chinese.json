Not, perhaps, as good as what you can get in LA's top places, but fantastic compared to its competition here.\n\nThe Kung Pao chicken is particularly good, with delicious fried chicken cubes and the usual hot sauce and chiles.  Chicken with lettuce wraps is good too.\n\nTheir fried noodle dish with chicken, whose name I have forgotten, is addictive but has an odd sauce I don't quite like.  Still, they get the friedness of the noodles right, and there are precious few ... ahem ... no other restaurants around here that do.\n\nPortions are small, so either plan to get an appetizer and an entree or expect to leave almost as hungry as you came.  The minced chicken in lettuce wraps appetizer is outstanding and you get about the same amount of food as in one of their entrees.\n\nIf you live in LA, forget P F Chang's.  If you live in NYC, I'm sure there are a dozen better places on a single block.  But here in Pittsburgh, it's just about the best place around.", "business_id": "JDDeaNfb0JXD1NbznSIC9g", "stars": 4, "date": "2005-12-28", "type": "review"}

P.F. Chang's has a dedicated Gluten-Free Menu for those of us who suffer from celiac disease.  They also make sure to clean down the area they prepare the specialty dinner so as to avoid cross-contamination.  I don't know many other restaurants that go this far.\n\nAside from the menu preference, I enjoy my overall experience every time.  Their menu is a bit different than that of what most people will be used to if you regularly eat a Chinese Take-Out or Buffet joints.  Don't expect this to be at all like that.  It's not a Buffet.  They don't sell \"General Tso's\" (though Chang's Spicy Chicken is recommended for those looking for something similar, it's my personal favorite) or other signature foods that you may expect.  They do sell very similar items with different names and a few of their own adjustments, just make sure to read the menu description and ask questions if you are not sure.  They also sell Sake, I believe they have a few different types.  \n\nThe prices can get a bit more expensive than your average Chinese Restaurant depending on what you get but it's well worth it.  Portions are excellent and the taste is great.  I've yet to have one complaint and I have frequented this establishment several times over the span of a few years.\n\nThe only downside, it can be a little crowded and a bit loud.  It's also very dark because of their lighting.  However, I think it sets the atmosphere.

I enjoyed PF Chang's restaurants in the Chicago area, and my wife and I have eaten a few times at this Pittsburgh-area location. Over the last year, we have tried repeatedly, but the 90-120 minute wait for dinner is unacceptable. We tried going early, late -- it never made any difference. The front staff was rude, and the wait was too long.\n\nTonight, we had a special date planned, and made reservations a week in advance. We came in the door exactly on time, waited in the line to see the front staff, and we were promptly handed a pager. They couldn't tell us when we would be seated.\n\nI imagined a short wait, so we went outside, crossed into a store to wait (since the entrance of this location is so packed, it's impossible to wait at the bar or in the meager seating).\n\nAfter 20 minutes we gave up. We went back to PF Chang's and the front office staff still couldn't tell us when we would be seated. I saw open tables.\n\nWhat on earth is the point of accepting reservations if you do not honor them?\n\nThe food here is good, but certainly not great. We went to a local Thai place and were seated with no problem in 5 minutes. The food was much better, the service was good even in a crowded busy restaurant.

There's nothing really WRONG with it. The portions are big and the food is \"alright\" and the interior gives you the superficial impression that you're encountering fine dining.\n\nThe food is sooooo bland though. Everything you get at P.F. Chang's you can get elsewhere in Pittsburgh at a much lower cost and it'll be made with more precision and have better flavor. The honey chicken at P.F. Chang's was so mediocre all I could think about while eating it was heading over to Wai Wai in Bloomfield and getting a tastier order of it for 8 bucks.\n\nLast time we were there the server was horrendous as well. I don't think I've ever felt as awkward at a restaurant. He brought my girlfriend's father (Don) his unsweetened tea then told him he didn't bring sugar because he asked for it sweetened and then did not understand the concept of sweetening it yourself. He then got all huffy when Don kept asking for it and actually seemed angry at us. When he came back to take our order Don ordered for himself and his wife and before Janey (my girlfriend) and I could order he had already started to walk away. We actually had to yell out to get him to come back and finish our order. (not in an uncivilized or malicious way, either) After that he must have thought we were terrible diners (I don't think I've ever been impolite to someone who is currently at work, or ANYONE for that matter) and he showed it by being silent and plopping things down in a passive aggressive way. It was really embarrassing and every time he came by the conversation died.\n\nObviously the attitude of one idiot who can't hide his bad day well doesn't really have anything to do with the restaurant.

I wish I could give 2.5 stars, but I'm in a good mood so I'm rounding up today. \n\nThis was my first time here and I honestly wasn't sure what to expect. The first thing I noticed when I walked in was the layout of the dining area. It seemed less intimate than I had pictured in my mind. The tables were all jammed together and the restaurant had a crowded feel to it. Fortunately, there wasn't a long wait as we had made a reservation. \n\nWe were seated at a table in the middle of the dining room alongside a busy throughway. It seemed all the servers were destined to walk past our table. I appreciated that their menu pointed out that their meals were \"meant to be shared.\" My wife and I decided to share our two meals: Chang's Spicy Chicken and Double Pan Fried Noodles. Before our meal came out our waitress set some sauces on the table in a \"here's your sauce\" kind of way. I remember thinking, \"That's very nice, but I have no idea why you just gave us sauce.\" There was no explanation - just a little tray of sauces. Our food came out and she finally asked if we like mild, medium, or hot sauce. We picked medium and, with a few scoops, she turned our three sauces into three mixed sauces and I still didn't know what they were for. \n\nForget the sauce though, my attention was now drawn to our meal. For meals that were \"meant to be shared\" these sure are little portions. I guess when you go for that high-end presentation you can charge 50% more for 50% less. The food itself was good (in an ok sort of way). I can't say it was the best I've had, but it was good enough. \n\nOverall I thought the experience was lacking. P.F. Chang's tries to be classy, but does it in a cafeteria sort of way. I was constantly distracted by the front doors opening and icy air pouring across the room. The music didn't fit the ambiance. Our table felt like it was in the middle of the road. The restaurant was loud and crowded. The girls at the table next to us were taking those annoying duck-face puckered lip pictures...  \n\nI think our experience may have been different if we were seated at one of the booths along the side of the restaurant, but no such luck.", "business_id": "JDDeaNfb0JXD1NbznSIC9g", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-02-24", "type": "review"}

We always grab some egg rolls too. The lady on the phone wasn't rude, per se, but she wasn't exactly helpful or answering any of my questions, either (hubby wanted to see about getting a different sauce on his noodles, and I had to ask a few times before she finally answered my question about how large the tofu dish was). I was in a good mood though, so the attitude over the phone didn't bother me. Price was good, typical takeout rates. The good news is that they will allow you to pay with credit cards over the phone, so if you're like me and never carry cash, you can still get delivery. She told me 45 minutes for the food.\n\nThe food arrived in about 20 minutes (we live half a mile away), it was hot and smelled great. Hubby's Mei Fun looked typical, but he was saddened to see that they didn't exchange the white sauce for brown sauce. The beef was pretty mushy, and didn't taste all that great. The veggies were fresh, and pretty crispy even after soaking in sauce. Noodles were alright, nothing to write home about. My General Tso tofu was delicious, and tasted exactly like the dish I was craving. Fried to perfection, perfect-sized pieces of tofu, and a fantastic sauce. The broccoli was fresh and tasted good. This particular dish only came in one size: Enormous. I think hubby and I just ended up sharing my meal, paired with some mediocre egg rolls.\n\nSo, long story short, lady on the phone was a bit irritating, delivery was fast, food was fresh, and, depending on what you order, the food quality ranges from so-so to great.

I wouldn't wish this place on my own worst enemy. I wouldn't wish this on the girl who cheated on my best friend. This place was a literal nightmare. .\n\nI think I've been to Jimmy Wan's 4 times this month, so I was sick of it. Plus I'd heard good things about TaiPei, so I thought I'd give it a whirl.\n\nThe service was abysmal - my waiter took 10 minutes to recognize I'd sat down. He was very kind, but only dropped my food off. No \"how's it going\", no water refills, no offer of dessert or other courses. A kind busboy kept refilling my drink. \n\nThe portions are extremely small - I've never seen such tiny sushi rolls in my life. The menu says there's a charge for fried rice instead of white. Huh. Jimmy Wan's offers white and brown, no extra charge. Interesting.\n\nThe atmosphere was atrocious.  A family in the table to my left and in front let their child (6 or 7, mind you) take off his shoes and walk around. He then ground his heel into the carpet - with a piece of chicken in between. He swiped a cloth napkin from an empty table and rubbed it all over his feet. I audibly gasped, but his obese mother couldn't hear me or ignored me. Then she threatened to take each of their Kindles away if they didn't shut up. The boy was eating with salad tongs instead of a fork all night long.\n\nThe waitstaff saw what was happening and didn't care at all. My waiter didn't show up after I was finished with my meal and when he did (after I'd requested someone else get him) he failed to clear my dirty plates. I finally told the owner how terrible the whole thing was - namely the ambiance and the service and she asked if I wanted anything to go and apologized for being busy. You...think I want something to go? How were 15 people in the 50 seat restaurant and one small takeout order. How....is that busy?\n\nOther reviews have mentioned that the ownership has changed hands. If you care about your health, don't go to a restaurant where the waitstaff doesn't care if children grind chicken into the carpet. If they find that behavior outside of the kitchen normal, can you imagine what they do inside the kitchen? I have no doubt little handwashing goes on and much wiping of noses while cooking.\n\nJews, don't go here on Christmas, even if though they loudly advertise they're open. If 15 people means they're \"busy\", can you imagine what it'll be like on Christmas?\n\nThe slowness of the whole establishment is astounding. I dropped my little brother off at Jimmy Wan's immediately before going to TaiPei - a 15 second drive between establishments. Wan's parking lot was jam packed and he ate with 9 other friends. He called me to pick him up as I was paying the bill. How the hell did TaiPei take as long as Jimmy Wan's did to seat and serve and bill 10 people as they did me, the 15th person in their restaurant?\n\nOnly go here if you have a death wish or are a practicing masochist.", "business_id": "dwz55gqPZwSBD74yFFb27g", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-12-21", "type": "review"}

I think I must have been at a different buffet than these other reviewers, because this was horrible.  When we walked in, it was like we were in the South Pacific.  Seriously.  The thermostat must have been set at 90.  A nice change from the 40 degree weather outside, but after about three minutes, it was the worst.  Maybe that's for atmosphere, but it was not enjoyable.\n\nTo make the experience even less appetizing, the place is cramped and the staff does not help at all in this regard - they are constantly in the middle of the aisles, writing tickets and getting drinks in the middle of the walking areas and the like.  Again, they could be going for atmosphere, and having the staff constantly around is nice, but with overbearing heat and little room to move it's not good.  It's bad.  Really bad.  If you don't like personal space, you're good.  Really good even.  Otherwise, it stinks.  Literally.  I've been to restaurants in big cities, where rent is outrageous, that have more room to move than this.  In Pineville, there ought to be all sorts of elbow room (Schoolhouse Rock anyone?).\n\nYes, there is a sushi bar where a guy makes it in front of you.  Let me first tell you that I'm not really a sushi guy.  I like California rolls and those little rice cakes with shrimp on them, and a few other things, but none of the more exotic stuff.  But this was nasty.  He would take a big fried thing and plop it down on a plate and squirt some heavy mayo-like sauce all over it.\n\nThat's not too bad, right?  Well, once the rolls were gone, he'd do it again - without cleaning the plate.  That's right, there was a buildup of this mayo on the platter.  Several varieties, all right there under the lights.  It was pretty sickening.  Like a sushi hog pond.\n\nOn the regular buffet, it wasn't too bad, but it wasn't that good either.  If you want a Southern food buffet (meat, rolls, corn), it's okay.  But the Chinese food was just average.  Add that to the place, the staff, the price - go elsewhere.  China King and Dragon House aren't far away, and Tin Tin is just up the street (though I'm not a huge fan of Tin Tin either).

It was very good.  It was the right texture and not overly salty like some places.  \nMy entree was Shrimp Mei Fun.  I love rice noodles, but I don't think I've ever had this dish anywhere.  It was a generous portion of rice noodles with bits of scrambled egg and shrimp.  Not really a sauce so that was a plus in my book.  The noodles were cooked just right.  The shrimp maybe could have been cooked 30 seconds less, but still good. \nThe service was very attentive, but there was only 1 other table.

To blend in any strict SouthPark codes, the restaurant looks like every other building in the area on the outside with just their name added.  Not until you get up to the front door (hidden in a breezeway) do you begin to recognize the establishment.  \n\nI've been to this PF Chang's a few different times and had varied experiences.  The first few times were good, as expected.  Then I had the most crazy experience I've ever had at a restaurant.  The hostess pulled a superiority card and said she couldn't seat our party of five for 45 minutes because there were no tables available to accommodate our size.  I pointed several out to her and she shrugged her shoulders.  That's right:  she shrugged her shoulders at me.  I guess nobody taught her how to count and spot empty tables before, so my logic blew her away.  I wrote a letter and got an immediate response from the GM who was very apologetic and invited us back.  We did give them another try and have been back a couple of times since.  \n\nOur return visits have been very good.  The food always tastes delicious and the service was excellent, too.  The chicken lettuce wraps are on the appetizer menu, but they make a fantastic meal for one.  I feel like I'm eating so healthy -- yet so tasty -- when I choose them.   If I'm really hungry, I go for the Ginger Chicken with Broccoli or Ground Chicken with Eggplant.  It's tough to decide between the two for me.  And usually it's white rice for me as an accompaniment (instead of their other option of brown rice).  I tried the Orange Peel Chicken once, not realizing how much orange peel they really put in the entree.  Ever eaten a lot of orange peel?  It's bitter.  And totally ruins the flavor of the meal.  And there isn't enough soy sauce in the world to correct it.  So what did I learn?  Orange Chicken good.  Orange PEEL Chicken bad.  \n\nOne of my favorite touches at PF Chang's is that they offer a variety of sauces at the tables.  You can mix your own combination of oil, vinegar, hot mustard, soy sauce, and chili pepper sauce if you want to...or just go straight for the chili pepper sauce solo and let the heat take over.  YUM.  \n\nThe last time we were there, we splurged and got dessert, too?  Why?  They were tiny and calling our names.  For about $2, you can order a mini dessert (about two spoonfuls in a shotglass) just \"for a taste.\"  That way, you get the flavor without all the calories!  I tried 3 different ones -- and, mind you, I LOVE chocolate -- but the carrot cake one (with cream cheese frosting) was my favorite.\n\np.s. I rated PF Chang's not good for kids because they don't have kids' menus.", "business_id": "4CPrhBc4Ado90fj7PG6jrA", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-12-08", "type": "review"}

I was starving... and I knew my dinner tonight was going to be a $.20 package of ramen noodles) I ordered the Banana Spring Rolls which are pretty much bananas wrapped in a spring roll wrapper, fried and then served with coconut-pineapple ice cream and drizzled with caramel and vanilla sauces.

Thus...\n\nBaoding is a good Chinese-American restaurant in the South Park area. Other Yelpers have described it well: it is attractively appointed with comfortable seating and an upscale bar. The service is consistent, as is the food, which explains the steady stream of middle-aged lunch patrons. I did not notice anything on the menu that would raise anybody's concern or curiosity. Spicy items were designated as such.\n\nMy lunch, Hot and Sour Soup and Garlic Shrimp arrived (temperature) hot, well-presented and adequately seasoned. Neither dish was particularly fresh or inspiring, however.\n\nMy thought: if you need a place to go that's consistent, Baoding is a good choice. If you're a food adventurer seeking authentic Chinese food, go elsewhere.

Very yummy.  Problem has been that Chinese/Asian restaurants in the Charlotte area only serve Singapore Noodles, which are Bee Hoon style, but always, to my disappointment, cooked with curry powder.\n\nAt last, Baoding understood what I wanted and even offered another way to prepare this dish with a white rather than a brown sauce.  The waitress knew exactly what I wanted but checked with the chef, who also joined our table discussion and out came a wonderful pile of Bee Hoon in white sauce.  The waitress assured me that if I did not like it that they would replace it.\n\nI did and was, and continue to be, happy with my Bee Hoon.\n\nAnd I appreciate how Baoding takes special orders in stride.

One will take your order for drinks, another will take the order for food, and then they just keep coming. For example, when my wife's glass went empty and she switched from soda to water, no less than three different people asked if she needed more soda. That's not a bad thing, it's just showing how on top of things they were.\n\nAfter ordering our lunch special, it came out quickly - of course, many Chinese places will serve lunch combinations quickly, so that's not a terrible surprise. What was impressive here is that the ingredients seemed to be very fresh. Not just unrecognizable lumps of chicken, but balls of chicken and cuts of beef, well-seasoned as we had ordered it (even spiced as requested).\n\nThe only real complaint on the food was that the sauce was perhaps a bit heavy, which tended to overwhelm things a bit much. The good news is that the sauce is well-flavored, even if it is perhaps on the heavy side.\n\nI also ordered brown rice and received white rice, but that's not a huge deal, as I really don't care too much, but it is something to watch for if you go and care about that sort of thing.", "business_id": "i-tKO0n-1Tq6sTFUrhg9-Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-02-13", "type": "review"}

Yum! \n\nFor our entrees, David and I both were having trouble deciding what to order - there are so many things I love here, but I had been craving cashew chicken. But I kept changing my mind because I really wanted other veggies that don't come with the cashew chicken.   \n\nOur server noticed that we were taking a while to make our decisions, so when we were placing our orders, he gave us a couple of other suggestions... which turned out to be really awesome suggestions!  \n\nI changed my order based on his recommendation and ended up ordering the garlic chicken which is a little bit spicy and has brocoli, mushrooms, water chestnuts, red bell pepper, onions, plus I asked for cashews to be added to the dish. I got brown rice to go with it.  The chicken was sauteed perfectly as were the veggies.  The flavor of the dish was exactly what I hoped it would be - delish!\n\nDavid ended up getting the garlic chicken too, but he asked for his to not be spicy... and instead of cashews, he got his with snowpeas and white rice instead of brown. \n\nEverything was fabulous as usual...

Christmas Eve, I get it that it's going to be busy and as usual I called for a reservation because it's the polite thing to do and I hate waiting. I called a bit late and they only had 4 pm open.\n\nMe and my party got there at 4 which turned out to be their opening time.  I was greeted by the Manager who is always there.  He was nice as always and we were promptly seated.  Table of 6 which included a booth for 4 and a table set alongside.  A little uncomfortable but no problem.  The server who waited on us has been there for quite a while and has waited on us in the past.  We ordered an appetizer for the table of lettuce wraps and she basically told us that because of it being Christmas Eve the appetizers were going to come out with our entr\u00e9e.  She explained it in her broken English and I thought she meant that the kids meals would come out with the appetizers which is what I wanted anyway since my kids take like 10 years to eat a meal.  \n\nOur lettuce wraps show up and so do about 10 other plates which included our entrees, rice, kids meals.  You couldn't see the table there was so much food. My # 1 pet Peeve at a restaurant when they cannot time the food properly enough to give you time to enjoy the food. I was pissed!  Chinese food doesn't take that long to cook and it was like a race for us to spend our money and get the heck out of there.  So, I and the rest of my party scarfed down our food and before I knew it while the pit was forming in my pre Christmas Day stomach the check was handed to us and we were basically being shown the door so they could get the next party in.\n\nI told the Manager about the experience and he explained that it was because of the \"circumstances of the evening\".  It was 4:00 and they were not busy at the time and I, being a long term customer don't appreciate being hurried when there was no reason to do so, except for the fact that you can't manage your kitchen.  If you can't handle it, don't open the effin restaurant.  \n\nWan Fu better open their eyes up to the reality that there are other options out there and you don't get repeat business, especially from long term customers by providing them crappy service.

Also he asked me if I wanted a menu......strange. After getting settled with the menu, I ordered 2 egg rolls, hoping that since it was between mealtimes I would get freshly fried ones. Nope, not to be. Cold, hard and greasy. So back they went, with a request for fresh ones, told the waiter I didn't mind waiting for them.\n\nI ordered Sa Cha Scallops as an entree, with a small pork fried rice. The new egg rolls came out at the same time as the entree. I could deal with that, no probs. BUT....egg rolls were NOT fresh, they were warmer, and just as hard. Scallops were good and plentiful, presentation was good, fried rice was good also. The egg rolls were the turnoff. \n\nI'm giving it 2 Yelp stars, but if you love good egg rolls, don't come here expecting to find them. Panda's Den in north Charlotte puts this place to shame.", "business_id": "qam5QKFE2a8MQBkxznrr3w", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-02-01", "type": "review"}

We have been here a number of times over the past two years and recently moved back to the Charlotte environs.  So, on a windy, rainy night my wife and I came back.  I had lunched there a few weeks ago, so wanted my wife to experience CW again and get her opinion.\n\nThe lunch was very average, at best.\n\nBeautiful decor and atmosphere.  Giant illuminated tropical fish tank and a snappy-dressed manager/owner tending the front desk.  Very authentic as a lot of ethnic Chinese patronize the Great Wall.  And the wait staff speaks English as I speak Spanish:  like immigrants.  Can be hard understand and though they know the menu by rote, asking for exceptions, like no baby corn or mushrooms, leaves one wondering if the message was received as sent.\n\nPortions are large, but the accompanying rice is a niggardly amount.  Probably a cost-saving measure, but a bit too frugal as the sign of a good host in my Asian experiences is that there is a lot of rice, ditto with tortillas in the Mexican culture.\n\nWe both ordered \"spicy\" and I asked for extra spicy.  If you like spice, you need to make your case as they are cautious in burning you out. \n\nBrown sauces reign, with a few dishes coming with lighter white sauces.  I mention this because one has to have a very discerning palate to distinguish one brown sauced dish from another. Am certain that cooking to local tastes has a play in this, but than again, there are a lot of Chinese eating here.\n\nThe menu has both chef specials and more typical, America-wise, dished listed by category.  Not many noodle choices.\n\nGW is a nice place for a date or even a romantic occasion.  You will get plenty to eat, but don't expect your socks to be knocked off by their average, similar tasting dishes.

I choose the special, which was spicy shredded meat (forgot name) with celery and carrots with pork fried rice and egg roll.  The table with provided with complimentary bowl of crisps with sweat sauce and mustard sauce; they were not stale, so kudos there.  I also ordered a sweat tea (came with lemon), it was sweat and not watered down.\n\nThe meal itself was indeed spicy, but not too overpowering since I didn't sweat.  The fried pork rice was very good and the shredded meat with veggies complimented one another.  The egg roll was fat and yummy.  Overall, it was all very good and was able to clean the plate.\n\nThe menu and prices provided during lunch is what you would find at many other Chinese restaurants in the area, so there is nothing unique.

That wasn't anywhere on the gift certificate but it was at the entrance of the restaurant apparently.  Saw it after she pointed it out to me when I inquired about why the tip was added automatically.  So beware of using certificates here.  I won't get another certificate for this restaurant. Mainly because the service was horrible.  They require to show the certificate before ordering.  So your server already knows they are guaranteed 18% of your tab at the end of your meal.  So I think this definitely gave our server the initiative to cut back on what should have been a good service.  Since, again she was guaranteed a decent tip.  Which wasn't deserved at all.  I would have tipped her half that.  She didn't refill our drinks, and when we asked for more napkins she gave us two.  We were a party of four.  \n\nSo yes I gave it a two star rating because of service.  Let's face it, when we go out to dine we want to get good service.  And that's not what we got.

All in all I'll never stop eating here and if pf changs is ur style of Chinese don't waste ur time bashing my favorite restaurant its a whole different level of food ! $10 dollar plate is not comparable to $50\nKeep up the good work", "business_id": "QoCjVVy4--QNyVRkzQTCEg", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-02-28", "type": "review"}

This particular night was at the end of summer and there was an amazing thunderstorm about to occur. SO on this stormy night we decided on Chinese and I had recommended we drive to Middleton for what I had heard to be the best around.\nOk..so after a short 15 min drive we had a great parking spot...  ran inside and were greeted with a warming beautiful atmosphere.. very welcoming large foyer, nice bar area which u walk thru to get to your dining area.\nAfter the immediate seating, WE were greeted  by a pleasant asian woman and ordered drinks. which turned out to be just right.\n\nAppetizers were mediocre...nothing to remember...we had the app for two...calamari was HORRIBLE  btw  I could go into so much detail but who is gonna read all that....the following is my reason for writing...\n\nMy forewarning is NOT TO TRUST in ordering the Lobster dish. I wanted a decadent treat for myself and decided on the (market price) 45$ Lobster dinner entree which came with two choices of preparation. Ginger sauce or garlic butter  i ordered the garlic but the server said no the other was best.\nMore importantly i asked her how large the lobster was and if it was sold by pound cause it was listed as Market Price. She said she would inquire before i ordered and returned to our table and said it was 2.5 pds or larger. So that made me excited and i did not hesitate in my ordering. I thought 45 dollars was a great price for a generous 2.5 pd lobster entree.\nWhat arrived on my plate was a cut up overly sauced jigsawed puzzled lobster animation on a platter which was in no way a 2.5 pound creature to begin with. It was dismantled then pieced together to look like a lobster shape. The meat was still in shell. (and I mean IN SHELL).  There was hardly any meat to be had. The tail which should have been the meatiest portion was cut in one inch pieces with shell INTACT and had yielded maybe 2 morsel of meat total.  I was shocked as i struggled to manipulate any source of goodness from the pieces of crustacean.There was literally no lobster and what was there was swimming in overpowering sticky sauce. All in all an EXTREME disappointment. Not what I was expecting in the LEAST!!\n\nAs the storm gained intensity outdoors, my high hopes and any thoughts of returning to this eatery were un-intensified. I will NEVER return. I cannot tolerate being misled by a server\n We ended up tipping and not making a fuss...just another lesson learned. The storm raged on , I did get to spend time with my son and hopefully educate you.. Not a total loss I guess.Just stay away from places like this that lie for profit and have followings that end up being ill fated.", "business_id": "SKLw05kEIlZcpTD5pqma8Q", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-12-11", "type": "review"}

Note that you have to order the duck a day in advance. It's a whole duck specially prepared and served in three courses, of which the crispy duck skin with mandarin pancakes is my favorite. Super authentic! You can ask for more pancakes with the dish, yes it is this good! \n\nOther dishes we tried include the usual general tso chicken, mongolian pork, stir fry noodles. Those are delicious, but in my opinion those are pretty common in chinese restaurants. I would recommend Imperial Garden for special occasions (the restaurant is roomy and nice to accommodate large groups). Order their specialty dishes, they are worth it.", "business_id": "SKLw05kEIlZcpTD5pqma8Q", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-12-25", "type": "review"}

First off, this is a chinese fusion fast food place so any comments that said it is not authentic chinese is accurate but irrelevant. I had the stif fry dish of tofu and vegetable with Shanghai sesame sauce with brown rice. I said with and not over because that is how it was served. The portion was generous & the vege was definitely fresh. So fresh, the carrots were still hard. The pea pods were done right, still has a crunch and no \"green\" taste to it. The sauce has 2 chiils next to it but it is hardly spicy. More sweet than spicy. So in terms of freshness, I say Chin's Asia Fresh lived up to its name. \n\nIn terms of how good the dish is, there are lots to improve. \n\n1) The tofu used is probably the wrong type. I would have used a softer tofu and flash fried to burn the outside. Keeping the tofu soft will complement the crunchy vege better. \n2) the carrots could have been sliced long like the rest of the vege instead of just round discs. If could also be better it was cooked a rat longer or parboiled before frying. \n3) ideal vege for the tofu would be black mushrooms or black fungus in place of the carrots and keep everything else. \n4) the sauce is not sticking or coating the vegetables and so a thickener would be great. \n5) I would serve the stir fry over the rice instead of on the side to make tge presentation nicer.", "business_id": "KW6HejC-67KSL9J8Cz1dSw", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-02-10", "type": "review"}

Boy, was I disappointed! First of all, we ordered for delivery tonight, on New Year's Eve. Hey, I get it; NYE is a busy holiday for restaurants, so it's not like I expect a 30 minute delivery time. But when an hour and a half passed without our food, we called to check in. They told us, \"Sorry, we only have one delivery driver for more than 30 orders.\" Um... ok? Why, when you know it's a holiday, would you not staff more drivers? So that was ridiculous right off the bat. Then, our food arrived (about an hour and 45 minutes after we ordered), and I would have forgiven the long wait had the food been amazing (or even good!). Sadly, this was not the case. I ordered the children's chicken fried rice for my kids, and I was honestly scared to give it to them when I opened the container and saw the cold, gray, limp chicken lying within the rice. My kids tried it and promptly spit it out. My order (the cashew chicken) was limp and spongy; the only slightly passable thing we ordered was the General Tso's chicken. Although even that, while it had excellent flavor on the breading and sauce, provided way more gristle than I expect to ingest when eating from a restaurant. \n\nSo we may (if all other options are exhausted) give it another try, because hey, maybe it was just a fluke bad experience because of New Year's Eve.

They have a huuuuge menu -- very similar to Golden Harbor (who were  the original owners of this place for those of you who are interested in Tina's Chinese restaurant entrepreneurial endeavors of Champaign --- I think she started with Cravings, then to Mandarin Wok, then to The Wok, then to Golden Harbor -- and of course some other restaurants in between probably).   Anyways, you walk in, figure out what you want from the 300+ item menu (score another biggie if you know how to read the Chinese menu), then write down your order and sit and wait for the food to come out.   This is the only place in town that serves dim sum -- and I LOVE dim sum.   The quality of dim sum has varied over the years, and at one point, I was so angry for waiting for at least 40minutes for mediocre dim sum that I didn't come back for two years.   But that was then and this is now --- went in the other week and knew that I would be kicking myself for not driving up to Chicago for dim sum, but I was craving hargow and shui mai so bad (I just found out I was pregnant, so when a pregnancy craving kicks in, watch out!) that I figured I'd eat here just to get the taste.   I ordered har gow, shui mai, shrimp spring rolls and beef balls.   Total came to about $13.   I'm never sure about the tipping policy here, but I'm sort of going after what Tina does at Golden Harbor and not tip because you basically have to bus your own tables and there's a sign that says no tip required.   Anyways, I was pleasantly surprised that my first dish was out in about five minutes -- har gow.... they were a little on the small side (key lime size) but holy cow, were they good!!!   Then the shui mai comes out --- same thing, wow?!.   Then the spring rolls and beef balls -- yummy, yummy!!  I couldn't believe it -- it wasn't the best I've had, but they hit the spot and I didn't feel like I had a lump in my stomach afterwards.    Just to be sure, I went back the other day..... and same thing!  Everything was yummy and fairly fast!!!   I love dim sum and am glad that for the time being that it's really happening at Mandarin Wok --- a little on the pricey side for dim sum, but rather than spending 5hrs of drive time, $50 in gas and parking -- it's better to stay in Champaign for the next little while!!

The food tasted good and the service was very friendly and helpful.\n\nFor the uninitiated, there are basically three menus here.  I think that maybe if they stuck to one menu, they'd get better ratings.\n\nThe best menu is their authentic Chinese menu.  This is on the wall to the right as you enter.  It is in both Chinese and in English, but includes almost exclusively authentic Chinese dishes.  The dishes I had were off this menu, were cooked by their Chinese chef, and were excellent - high in flavor, good textures, I'd eat them again anytime.\n\nThe second menu is on the left as you come in, and this is mostly Americanized Chinese foods.  I think these may not usually be cooked by their Chinese chef, but instead by their non-Chinese workers.\n\nThe third menu is the menu of Thai items. The owner is Chinese, so while I haven't actually ordered from the Thai menu, I wouldn't expect great things from it.\n\nThe decor in the place is typical unpretentious Chinese, which is to say plain and frayed at the edges.  Disposable plates and cups don't make much for ambiance, but most inexpensive but authentic Chinese places focus on the food and not the decor.\n\nI deliberated on whether to give them three or four stars, but ultimately I've going with four because I did really enjoy the food I had, and the service was very good.  \n\nOrder off the authentic (right-hand) side of the wall, insist you want it cooked authentically, and I think you'll go home happy.", "business_id": "u06X5C_pIAVuOXOznIcPYw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-01-17", "type": "review"}

I've only ordered a couple dishes from here, but I feel no need to change my order any time soon-Mongolian beef and the General Tso's is the usual.  First of all, I love that they ask no questions about making things spicy/extra spicy.  The mongolian beef is ordinarily not spicy, but when I asked if they could add some spice, they enthusiastically said yes- I haven't ordered it unspicy since.  The beef is sooo tender and the sauce they cook it in is to die for.  I literally would eat it everyday if I had a heart of steel.  The General Tso's is pretty good, although not outstanding.  It's a little too sweet and saucy for my taste, but I like to have something to contrast the beef, so this is usually what I go for.\n\nThe only other dish I've ordered is the Fried Diced Chicken w Red Pepper.  It's pretty much a party in your mouth.  Super spicy, just how I like it- the chicken is cut up small, covered in batter, and deep fried, almost like popcorn chicken, and salty, which is awesome with a plain white rice.  The only reason I don't order this all the time is because it's a little too spicy and I don't want to regret eating it the next day.\n\nSo, I can't speak for a ton of dishes, but the ones I've had thus far have been very palatable.

We need more people downtown after-hours (5PM ... booo!) and Fate is their subpoena.  \n\nAnd this is just what their gentle palates need -- swankish pan-asian pabulum that outshines P.F., but in reality would all make us feel and look a little silly if we boasted it as our premiere Asian restaurant to a New Yorker, Seattlite, or San Franciscan.  Fate is a sleek little spot that feels cooler than it is and keeps you coming back based on the atmosphere and above average food.\n\nI have absolutely no problem eating here -- its good for groups now because their outside patio is huge -- but I'm not going here to be wowed by the food.  I have my two dishes that I don't vary from now and I suspect that once you become a regular you will have those dishes that you will rely on when the time comes for you to throw your divorce party with all of your other psycho suburbanite girlfriends before hitting up Postino.", "business_id": "VsO_rhXi5lgbaGxNwoEZsQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-02-08", "type": "review"}

This place is legit! For the price I would have been pleased with adequate food, but each item really blew me away. \n\nThe crab puffs were more crab meat than cream cheese, with great flavor. The Curry Beef stew was amazing, with an excellent flavor (they actually put this in two containers, one for the beef and noodles with one for the broth. Nice touch!). The Wunan beef had just the right amount of fire to it, and was just plain delicious. \n\nI'm already planning my next trip to Gourmet House of Hong Kong.

You go to a restaurant you \"super-like' and then upon your return it fizzles out like a second rate firecracker.  \nThe last time this place got 5 stars from me.  Here's what happened last night.  \n\nWe started off with an order of two soups:  Egg drop and Wonton.  I remembered the fabulousness of the wonton soup in the past.  Delicate, very delicate wontons in an extraordinarily delicious broth.  Couldn't wait to taste it again. Ordered Chow Mein with beef which came with brown sauce. Told the waitress to keep the brown sauce separate.  She said she didn't quite think she could do this.  She said she could give me the noodles separate, the beef separate and the brown sauce separate.  I asked, \"Couldn't you do the noodles with the beef and just the sauce separately?  She said she would have to talk to the cook as he has never done this before.  Reminds me of the movie \"FIVE EASY PIECES\" with Jack Nicholson.  He asked for a tuna on toast and the waiter said he could have a tuna sandwich but not on toast because they don't have tuna on toast on the menu.  I will say no more.  You just HAVE TO watch the movie.  \n\nWe also ordered orange chicken and asked if we could have it without breading and very spicy.  She said yes. We added an order of fried tofu which came with a sauce similar to the ones served with dumplings.  The soups arrived and the wonton soup was not what I remembered it to be.  (You guys are not going to start questioning my memory are you?)   The broth was mediocre and while the wonton were delicate, they were not flavorful.  Hubby said the egg drop soup was OK. (that means not so good in husband-speak).  The orange chicken arrived as requested, no breading. But with no spice.  He had to add spice from a metal jar on the table which was nothing more than pepper flakes in oil.  Does anyone want to consciously add oil to their food?  Don't most of us try to avoid adding calories if possible?  The preferred method to add spiciness to a dish is for THE COOK to saut\u00e9 the meat WITH HOT PEPPERS thereby imparting a nice overall spiciness to the dish.  But this was not to be so spicy oil it was.  Remarkably, the beef chow mein arrived with noodles & beef together and the brown sauce separately. Amazing.  IT COULD BE DONE!  Is this NOBEL prize worthy?  The chef was actually able to serve noodles & beef together and the sauce separately????!!   Should we be sharing this accomplishment with other restaurants or with the FOOD NETWORK?    I marveled at the large amount of \"brown sauce\" they put on the side.  What exactly is in that brown sauce.? I'm afraid to ask.  But it seems that this brown sauce is their \"go to\" sauce for almost every dish.  Back to the dish.  The chow mein noodles were totally dry but the beef was moist enough to eat.  I now understand the purpose of the brown sauce--basically it wets down dry food, in this case the noodles.  I ate some of it but will tell you now that I would not ever order this dish again.  The fried tofu came out in blocks resembling kids play blocks; maybe a bit smaller.  Not greasy but not the most pleasant tasting tofu I've had either.  The soy-sauce based sauce that came with it is a MUST HAVE if there is any chance of you swallowing this tofu.  Another dish I would not order again.  Don't get me wrong.  I eat tofu.  I like tofu.  I order tofu all the time (and eat it).  It's just that the preparation in this tofu dish was really, really lacking.  \nAnd now for the good parts.  The portions are very generous.  The waitress was very nice and wanted us to accommodate us at the table of our choice since the TV was showing football and hubby's eyes immediately went to the screen.  (Gee, how unusual. ) Finally the pricing is very reasonable.  You can't go wrong with the prices, but then again you can't go right with the food either.

Or, ask the price in advance. Secondly, when I booked I was not aware that this restaurant is participating in the Restaurant.com program, therefore I had no idea that the owners are already ahead of the curve and most likely anticipating a certificate from first time patrons, particularly patrons who are not ethnically Chinese.\n\nThe restaurant was selected based on my experiences dining with a friend from Hong Kong, who was not with me last night. I found them on the website for the Chinese Cultural Center, as I have only lived here in AZ for two years. I didn't find out about the Restaurant.com certificate participation until after booking the reservation and then coming to Yelp to read reviews.  I happened to have over two hundred dollars in Restaurant.com certificates so I redeemed one to use for dinner. A happy accident, right?\n\nI've eaten in Chinatown in NYC many times, eaten in restaurants where there is no menu in English and my Cantonese speaking friend ordered, and have ordered a whole duck many times. Sometimes the side dishes or presentation vary a little, but there is no disputing the sum parts of an entire duck- it includes two wings and two legs. I know my duck.\n\nSo a duck, not on the menu but available, was ordered more than 24 hours in advance.  Upon arrival for our reservation the duck was served shortly thereafter with polite and congenial service from a woman I assume is one half of the couple that owns the restaurant. The Shanghai style crepes were good, the scallion was julienned, the hoisin sauce was augmented. It was delicious, but in my opinion it was not a whole duck as ordered and charged for- upon service I asked the woman if it was a whole duck because the sliced breast parts did not seem to be the entire bird. Also, in Chinatown there is a practice of presenting the duck,  carving at table, then whisking away to make a second course from the parts that don't easily lend themselves to rolling in crepes or in buns (some restaurants serve a puffy flat bun and not a crepe) but in our case there was no second course.\n\nWe ordered other dishes, especially since my dining companion is a neophyte to non-Americanized chinese.   We weren't there trying to get away with only fulfilling the required 45 dollar purchase per the gift certificate- I try to make it worth the owner's while and be fair. \n\nFor him there was peppersteak and house special fried rice, for me the sea bass in white wine (I wanted fish with pine nuts but they were out of nuts) and chinese fried cabbage, a stir fried bok choy and napa mixture with dried baby shrimp as seasoning.  The food was tasty, albeit too much salt was added, and I definitely tasted MSG in the fish and cabbage. Also, the beef and cabbage were swimming in a puddle of grease.  The cabbage alone was eight bucks, but again since we were getting a discount I thought it only fair to order at least one dish where the owner had a high markup. Ditto for the rice.\n\nWhen the bill came I was a little surprised to see that the Duck alone was forty bucks, since we didn't get the whole duck.  I tendered my certificate without a word and the staff politely packed up our leftovers, which was most of our meal- that was deliberate.  The bill with tax was 88 bucks and change, and the terms of the certificate included a mandatory 18 percent tip before discount. I don't have a problem with that at all, I always tip on the face value of a meal, not the discount price.  What I don't like however is the habit of owners to assess the tax on the total of the bill prior to discount- I've used certificates at restaurants that used computerized systems and never been taxed on the full price. This restaurant uses hand written tickets that are written entirely in chinese except for the numbers. To add insult to injury, the owner assessed the mandatory tip on the entire amount including the tax.  I know that waitstaff today assume that they are due a tip on the tax, but actually that's quite incorrect traditionally.  When the bill came back it was just shy of eighty dollars after discount.   I don't begrudge restaurant owners trying to keep afloat and make a living, but I don't like it when they pad the bill, and this bill was padded.  That plus our less than a whole duck left a bad taste in my mouth about this restaurant, and that alone is grounds for me not to return.  \n\nIf you want something better than american style chinese or want to use one of those certificates, then go ahead and dine at Lao Ching Hing, but this is my advice:  Only order off the menu.  Advise the server to ask the kitchen to go easy on the salt, and if you're not a fan of MSG, request that they keep it out of your food. Lastly, just order what you want for the meal and if you want extra, order it separately as take-out to avoid having a padded bill.", "business_id": "2unQHR9uaRxk3dsW6f3MGA", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-12-25", "type": "review"}

Last time I had that was visiting family in China! Ordered Water boiled fish and twice cooked pork. I really like the flavoring of the twice cooked pork. I wanted to order the Yu-shan pork but was overruled by parents. Oh well. They didn't want spicy, so the water boiled fish wasn't after the told the waiter not to make it spicy. Guess I'll have to try again. So, definitely more dishes I need to try. For now, I am happy that there's an authentic sichuan food place in Phoenix and not just the lame old American Chinese that are so totally boring. I am so very disappointed that the Shanghai place next to Golden Buddha has changed owner and they no longer have the special Shanghai menu and the quality of the food has gone down the drain.\n\nUpdate:\nTried the water boiled pork. That I thought was pretty good. The meat was nice and tender. The sichuan peppercorn made everything taste lemony to me later on, including the water. I guess that must be the numbing effect people talk about. I also liked the beef with jalapeno pepper. Nice flavor.

I found a street fair with such cultural gems as a booth for Wells Fargo loans, and one selling \"crazy Chinese hats.\" I wanted authentic food, and the booths selling egg rolls and stuff from the market buffet were pretty much the opposite of what I was there for. So my date for the event and I decided to try one of the Chinese restaurants at the center, and I chose Szechwan Palace because I was in the mood for something spicy.\n\nThe place was packed, which was to be expected. Since a good portion of the conversation I heard taking place was in Chinese, I was hopeful that that this would be an experience similar to what I'd get in Seattle's international district. I knew that wouldn't be the case when I saw the menu, which was basically the same menu you'll find in any americanized Chinese restaurant.\n\nSo we just ordered the Szechwan dinner for two. Hot & sour soup, crab rangoons, fried rice, general tso's chicken, szechwan shrimp, and a rice based desert that I forget the name of.

We stood by the door ten minutes and no one even came to seat us. The waitress got a lot of rudeness to us.

I've yet to venture to the part of the menu that offers duck, but I've tried several beef, chicken and pork dishes and I've never been disappointed with anything I've ordered. My current favorite is the orange beef. Slightly sweet and a bit spicy, it's cooked golden and crispy and makes my tongue extremely happy. \n\nThe dining room is wide open. No booths. All tables. The volume can get a little loud when there are many patrons, and there usually... there are many patrons.  \n\nOne thing that sets them apart from other Chinese places I've tried is the way that some of the chicken dishes are prepared. Typically, little bites of chicken are battered, fried and covered in sauce. At China Chili, the entire cut of chicken is battered, THEN sliced and covered in sauce. This makes it visually more appealing and you aren't consuming so much batter and grease.\n\nI'll be back many times in the future so I can get my Chili on.", "business_id": "-3WVw1TNQbPBzaKCaQQ1AQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2007-01-19", "type": "review"}

The inside is a vast room filled with beautiful chandelier lighting and stunning Chinese artwork. Looked pretty fancy for the price, so it's a good choice to take someone special with the apperance you have money. I asked for a small table in the back corner to eat in peace among the sparse group of younger and older people present. \n\nMenu was quite large, with a deep selection of various choices. I was feeling seafood tonight, so I went with the Kung Pao Calamari which according to the menu is spicy and hot. Faster than I could say Toa chie, the dish arrived. No joke, the server walked into the kitchen and the food came out in about 2 minutes. That's insane and impressive. \n\nThe Kung Pao Calamari in presentation was great and looked delicious on the oval plate. Red, green bell peppers, cucumbers, peanuts and of course the calamari. Scooped up some calamari with various bits of vegetables and upon first impression it was quite good, although the calamari was fairly rubbery more than what I'm used to. The chewing went on longer than I was hoping. Good nonetheless and acceptable. Portion of food was more than adequate with a side of rice as is customary. I did not sense any spiciness to the food which I found disappointing as I do love a little kick in my seafood. I'd honestly like to try something else next time I come here. I sense the potential here.\n\nOverall, China Chili for the price and the atmosphere it's worth it. I would actually rate this place if I was able, close to 3 and half stars as the food wasn't as dynamic as the more upscale authentic places I've been to but then again I didn't expect that either.

Umm...if you want to complain about the atmosphere, service, and hot and sour soup - go to PF Changs for expensive Chinese food.  Places like this are what usually are good indicators of authentic - I am Chinese so yes, I think I know what I am talking about.  What I got a big kick out of was the fact that they have a menu for those looking for americanized chinese food and then a separate one with the real stuff on it.  Hilarious!\n\nMadi D seems to be spot on.  I ordered the Hom-yee guy lup chow fon (preserved salty fish, with chicken fried rice) and Green Beans with XO sauce.  The rice is not your typical fried rice so don't expect anything else besides the salty fish (yum!) and chicken.  It was yummy and a comfort good.  The green beans were cooked with something that made them dif. so I suggest that again.

I was going to order my regular Mongolian Beef from Pei Wei, but I had a hankerin' for an egg roll and some egg drop soup, too.  It was lunchtime during the week, so I figured I could find a place with a lunch special which included all of those things.  I came across great reviews for China Village on Yelp, and did not feel compelled to look elsewhere.\n\nI couldn't find a comprehensive (or solely take-out) menu online, so I ordered carry-out inside the restaurant.  The building is lilac, and boasts 2 signs out front.  The aroma once stepping inside was delicious!  I was greeted immediately upon my entrance, and asked the hostess for a takeout menu.  She was very kind, warm, didn't rush me, but waited at the register while I decided what to order.  \n\nI did not find exactly what I was looking for.  The lunch menu had 20 entr\u00e9e possibilities, ranging in price from $6.50 to $7.75, which included a vegetable egg roll, fried wonton, and fried rice.  No soup.  There was a rather comprehensive soup section in the menu (sizzling rice, wor wonton, hot & sour, egg flower, corn & cream, vegetables & bean curd, seafood), ranging in price from $6.25 to $7.95: one size only.  I asked the hostess if they had a smaller size soup - as I wasn't about to pay $7 for my lunch and another $7 for a gallon of soup - and she said that the smaller size is $5 and that it's better to get the larger size (demonstrating the difference in sizes with her hands).  To me, $5.00 was still too much, so I abandoned the soup idea at that point.  I settled on the Mongolian Beef lunch special, and it was ready in no time.  Seriously, I read one email on my phone, and was in mid-response when my order was ready!  It also smelled heavenly.  \n\nUpon returning to the office, I opened up the package, and actually laughed.  From reading other reviews on Yelp, I was expecting a feast of sorts.  Instead, I could barely see the egg roll, and the rice serving was a firm scoop.  One of the compartments in the serving tray was dedicated to sauces and fortune cookies (which I don't consider food).  I felt cheated, but the aroma was so inviting that I did not lose hope.  \n\nI tried the egg roll first.  It was light, juicy, and so so so flavorful!  I had never tasted one like this before.  My perspective began to change.  I am, traditionally, one who goes for cheap food, which frequently runs the risk of being nasty and/or dry.  So, it was very possible I was out of my element with China Village.  After finishing the egg roll, I wished that they had included an entire compartment of them!  (Or just made them 12 times larger.)\n\nNext up was the main entr\u00e9e.  It had onions and green things (sorry, that's the best I can do) in it, which I quarantined to the non-food compartment.  The beef was thinly sliced and perfectly tender.  I felt ashamed eating it out of a Styrofoam container with a plastic fork.  The sauce was a savory, slightly sweet, gravy.  The fried rice had little highlights of egg in it, nothing else.  It, too, was perfectly moist.  After I had finished all of the beef, there still was ample sauce and rice left.  Until I ate it all, of course.  :-)\n\nSo, bottom line?  Although it was not what I was expecting (or looking for, to be honest), I would not hesitate to go there again.  It provided a level of pure food-eating-pleasure which I had never experienced with Chinese cuisine before.  I would highly recommend!", "business_id": "3DMvGD8ZmlMQmhwV66hdSA", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-01-08", "type": "review"}

I just wish I could say the same about the food... \n\nUnfortunately, the egg drop soup, Kung Pao Vegetables, Spicy Chicken, and Beef and Asparagus dishes were nothing to write home about... all were mediocre.\n\nNext time, I'll go to one of our regular spots instead... or at the very least, I'll check the Yelp reviews before wasting time and money.

Yes, this place does look like a retirement center at lunch time and I took a picture to provoke it. (There were tons more seniors next to and behind us) We are always the youngest couple and can actually feel our youth being sucked out of us. This does not take away the fact they have delicious orange chicken and will continue to sacrifice my youth once in a while for its yummy crunchiness. \nP. s.

But I was fooled, it's not just ANY cheap buffet, it's THE cheap buffet. \n\nWell, as Roger Daltrey says, \"I won't get fooled again!\"\n\nThe sign outside says $4.86 buffet, lunch or dinner. For less than a Lincoln, it's worth a try, right? (Wrong!) First of all, cash only, people, no plastic. And here's the ENTIRE buffet list:\n\nRice (of the brown fried variety, bland)\nLo Mein (I'm not sure what that taste is, but it ain't Lo Mein)\nEgg Rolls (small, cut in half, and awful. And there's that \"taste\" again...)\nFried Chicken (the only food of redeeming quality)\nWings (again, bland, though decent in size)\nSweet and Sour Pork (I'll get to this in a second)\n\nYep, that's it. The whole buffet. And no refills on the sodas, either. Some greasy chinese crispy noodles. No soup. (Hey, no soup means not having to provide spoons!)\n\nThe fried chicken wasn't bad, but other than that, I wouldn't serve this food to prisoners. Except the ones on death row, and that's to save money on electricity.\n\nI'm not quite sure what the deal was with the Sweet and Sour Pork. The sauce was the consistency of water, the meat was......wait, I don't want to know. \n\nIf I could give it 1/1000th of a star, I'd do it.

In no other way does the Gold Coin overlap with common consumer expectation of a \"Chinese Buffet.\"  So, why was it so busy?  Because, for a tick north of five bucks a person could gluttonously stuff themselves with the above items; it is better thought of as an economical \"family-style\" meal.  If it was advertised as such, I bet Mike's would get better reviews as people wouldn't feel mislead when they walked in, and the balance of Chinese, to American, to Italian, to Mexican to whatever cultural dishes would be freed up as well.

Pull the couch apart, look for some loose change in the cushions, ask to borrow a dollar on your way in and you are all set to put the feed bag on - this is a cash only establishment!\n\nIt was more out of nostalgia that I stopped in to see if anything has changed in the last 25 years . . . it hasn't and that is not necessarily a bad thing, per se.  The same sweet and sour pork is being prepared, the same way (which is to say floating in gallons of sauce, only adding more flour coated pork bits when the vat is low) along with rice, noodles, vegetables, Egg Foo Young, egg rolls cut in half (as if you will take less that way) and fried chicken thighs along with a hard-to-find drumstick thrown in.

But the beef is already cooked so I am not sure why it is necessary. The hot and sour soup is awesome. The veggies in the soup are super fresh and delicious. The Egg Foo Yong is amazing as well.\n\nThe decor is very 80's: grey tones and tons of mirrors with the strangest bathrooms ever. The stalls clearly used to be showers and the it is creepily well lit. Blinding even. Very strong smell in the restrooms also, but it is pleasant, like laundry detergent.

I believe the smaller portion option is new to Pei Wei as I'm sure they're trying to capture a larger market w/less expensive prices or portions.

The hotel had advertised this restaurant,  the reviews were great and I decided to go there. I went there wanting to just take my food and eat it at the hotel room where I could get comfortable but I can honestly say I took longer deciding what to order than it took for them to actually hand it off to me  which makes me question the integrity of how they make their food since I ordered the beef crunchy noodle. The customer service was horrible, no eye contact, no courtesy when speaking directly to the customer, and I know they had the potential for it because there was a woman sitting besides me which she was greeted by a warm,  loud hello followed with laughter and a full blown conversation while I was just handed my food followed by a hurried \"bye\". I get to the hotel and guess what? There was no fork included with my order but luckily the hotel provided me with one.  Hoping that the food was going to be as stellar as everyone had posted and have my troubles compensated by the taste of this food... I can say I was sorely disappointed.  The beef was chewy,  it tasted overcooked, it was just disguising eating it that I just ended up throwing the food away.  It was a waste of time,  gas,  and of $10.29 out of my account but lesson learned. The fortune cookie was tasty though :)", "business_id": "F3SEkW6v2LJ5y6Ldo5pPaw", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-02-04", "type": "review"}

The decor and etc has 0 to do with ANY review I give unless it is pure filth, so this place was Clean and I didn't see any reason to adjust my review for that. I also did not get a Salad and downgrade a review for Salads, I try to review on the main staple of any restaurant we go to.. \n\nAnd now for my take.. \nOrdered the Pork Chow / Mein. (Lunch Special) Entree = 3 stars. and would go back for that. \n\nSide Dishes:\nEgg Drop soup or Flour Soup - Was actually Really good, nice Flavor without being Scorching hot.\nFried Rice - Dry no real flavor, and couldn't tell the type of actual rice it was.\nEgg Roll - Very ehhh , one bite n that was it,, no second chance,, the dipping sauce / duck sauce or whatever was WAY too sweet, kinda like dumping Jello mix in your mouth sweet... Yeah, I've done that before :D\n\nWould I Go back ? Yes when in area since nothing else I know of would suffice for an Entree,,,, Would i travel over 2 miles to go there? No. Would I recommend this place? No. Any suggestions? Add flavor to more than Entree, make Fresh Egg Rolls, and Anyone going here, skip the lunch special and just order the Dish you want .. there is enough for take out, as the plates are huge.. \n\nEnjoy !!", "business_id": "aozcOaCMwOHG8s-lbZ6_gA", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-02-06", "type": "review"}

The reviews are all over the place from 1 to 5 stars, but it is close, so I decided to give it a try.\n\nA second rating will appear in all my reviews in the future as health issues have caused me to be wheelchair confined (power chair) so that is now my method of transportation; thus mobility access will also be rated.\n\nI have to concur with the more positive reviews.  I've now dined here more than 6 times. This restaurant offers a great value at both lunch and dinner. Yes, the decor is dated, and stereotypical; but I'm not dining here for ambiance.  This is not a destination restaurant.  Lunch specials are priced for $6.45 to $7.45 for more than 15 choices.  All include a choice of soups, an egg roll, 2 won-tons, a huge portion of white or brown rice, and the main course.  My favorite is the shrimp with vegetables, which I order spicy; and it is outstanding - a generous number of shrimp served with broccoli, pea pods, mushrooms, carrots, and water chestnuts.  I also recommend the egg foo yung entree - both Shrimp and House Special.  This is not prepared in the traditional manner but is a base egg foo yung with the shrimp, and sauce, on the top - spectacular dish.  The black pepper beef, only tried at lunch, was an excellent dish.  I've heard diners in the restaurant rave about the potstickers, steamed dumplings, and hot mustard, although I have not personally tried them - yet.\n\nThe staff are courteous and attentive.  They seem to know most of the clientele by face, if not name; which is always a good sign.  It means people are satisfied enough to return.\n\nFor mobility access I award Flamingo Palace a 4 out of 5.  If they see me coming they rush to open the door; always when I leave. They rush to make an accessible table available, moving chairs and tables if necessary; although there are several accessible tables right near the front of the restaurant.  If the entrance/exit was a little wider, they'd probably get a 5th star.  Maneuvering in and out requires a steady hand and slow speed.\n\nWhether mobility restricted, or not, give this place a try; you won't be disappointed.", "business_id": "aozcOaCMwOHG8s-lbZ6_gA", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-02-21", "type": "review"}

The parking is adequate and well lit.  Access to the place is easy.\n\nTheir menu is a pleasant mix of traditional Chinese food, fresh new dishes and some other Asian favorites with their own twist.  They have an good sized menu, plenty of varied choices, but not so big that you can't decide.  Their delicious lunch specials are served until mid afternoon and include egg roll, crab rangoon and a cup of soup.\n\nOne of my absolute faves is their pad thai.  It has just the right amount of spicy for me, although they are happy to dial it up or down for your tastes.  They serve a dinner portion as well as a lunch portion.  The lunch special is enough for 2.... the dinner portion is enough for 2 and you can still take a doggie bag. The only noticeable difference between the lunch and dinner portion of pad thai is that they dinner portion has \nhas shrimp as well as tofu and chicken.\n\nOther favorites of mine include their lemongrass chicken.  It has a delicious flavor and is made with the best white meat of the chicken. \n\nMushu Chicken is wonderful.  the sauce is fresh and light. The pancakes are thin and soft.  I like mine with less green onion and more egg.  They are happy to adjust almost anything for you.\n\nHot and sour soup is excellent, full of vegetables and meats... even shrimp.  Lettuce wraps are good, as are crab rangoon, and traditional egg rolls.\n\nI have tried most everything here.... the only dishes i won't get again were not for lack of quality, they were just not my taste.  I'm not a big sweet and sour fan, and the raspberry chicken might be more suited to someone who is.

This has to be the worst!\n\nI gave one star just cause we did not get sick!  But short of that I would give zero stars if I could.

This was not my choice but it is nearby and unsuspecting hungry people may fall into the trap of ordering some delivery from here especially around the holiday's. Here is your warning. The food was bland no flavor, orange chicken was soggy, pot stickers were the worst I have ever had and I LOVE potstickers PEOPLE!! Chow mein was watery and tasteless. The ONLY thing that was decent was the crab puffs so next time I crave them I just might order them and maybe try some soup. What can I say I might be a glutton for punishment. ;)\n\nOh also when visiting this shopping mall which I have done many many times this place is pretty much empty except for maybe lunch.

But boy were we surprised! \n\nWe had War Wonton Soup to start, very flavorful. Not your typical bland broth with overcooked floaters. Yum. \n\nEntrees were chicken with green bean, shrimp fried rice and orange chicken for the kids. To my surprise the orange chicken was really tasty! The green beans were ok, cooked well but lacking much flavor. But the chicken in that dish was delicious.  Fried rice came out and I was instantly taken to China Town (San Francisco of course) the smell of blackened wok filled the dining room and I got excited. The rice did not disappoint. All together everything was excellent. \n\nFifth star could have been earned by a cleaner bathroom and more reasonable pricing. \n\nI will be back!", "business_id": "oMtqDDzpMcFrQwHfeYc1iA", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-02-19", "type": "review"}

Not feeling like a burger, I thought that Panda Express sounded convenient.  I was not disappointed though at the same time, the meal was not a gourmet one either.  There was only one person working the register while at the same time serving food so there was a bit of a wait (and the staff member was a bit flustered with much going on at once).  I am guessing that another staff member was on a break as there was a second person there by the time I left.  The restaurant was also kept quite clean though it appeared that the forks and napkins needed some restocking.  \n\nThe food, however, was fresh and as tasty as I had hoped it would be.  I got a two-item combo with fried rice, beef & broccoli, and string bean chicken.  I also added on a chicken egg roll.  The restaurant had several families, a few people on their own, and a couple all also eating, and it appeared that everyone else was also pleased with their meals.", "business_id": "bexPpkHMthuCaeC0g0Lrfg", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-01-21", "type": "review"}
