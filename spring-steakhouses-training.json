This Mortons is like most in other cities.  It's definitely for the expense account crowd.  It's fun to go to a place and to know exactly what you are in for.  I've been to Mortons all over the country and this one stacks up pretty well.  It's like most other high end chain steakhouses (Palm, Ruth's, Capital Grille, etc.).  The bar is pretty lame, but I'm guessing most go here for a sit down dinner.  Capital Grille or Hyde Park bar is much better for bar scene.  But, one thing I definitely appreciate about the bar is  the bar menu.  If you've never been to Mortons and you are watching your budget go to the bar have a cold beer and order the PRIME cheeseburger trio or the Filet sandwiches for only 6 DOLLARS.  Plus, the fries are awesome.  The dining room is really nice with dark wood and lots of leather.  The service is awesome because I'm guessing you have to be pretty good to land a server position that might end up paying you 6 figures.  The food is great.  However, my opinion is that most true high end steakhouses all have similiar quality steak.  I eat here a few times a year and my favorite first courses are the lobster bisque (Very good, but not as good as capital grille) and the tuna tartare.  Stay away from the filet.  I mean it's tender and delicious, but try a steak with a little flavor.  I'm guessing if you're like me you don't go to Mortons often, so try something that  is hard to get elsewhere.  Get the Cajun ribeye.  I can't remember if Pittsburgh location does a bone in ribeye, but if they do I would say a cajun bone in ribeye will be one of the best if not the best steaks you ever try.  I also suggest getting the \"lazy\" lobster.  There are few things in life more indulgent or enjoyable than having a two pound lobster cooked perfectly already cracked for you.  It's pure indulgence.  The asparagus is great and as big as a baseball bat.  The spinach is great and the hash browns are a must have.  You should definitely save room for desert and there is no better desert here than the chocolate souffle'.  Remember to tell them that is what you want for desert when you order your entrees.  I wish the bar was better, because if it was I'd go here more often.  This place is exactly what you would expect.  And, that's a good thing.", "business_id": "90Fqfzd8zD9AuuNBSv9lAg", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-04-13", "type": "review"}

Prior to that, I'd eat there about four times a year.  I guess I was worried about what the new management would do to a Pittsburgh tradition.  \n\nMy fears were relatively unfounded.  Tessaro's is still  the same warm, local and friendly place it's been for decades.  The new ownership retained everything that mattered -- and a few things that are problematic.\n\nI need to say that I'm a steak fan.  Good steak.  So I'm always just a BIT disappointed because the steaks at Tessaro's have too much gristle.  My friends, however, always order the burgers and they swear by them.  \n\nWhat continues to disappoint me are the little things.  The bread is NEVER fresh.  It always feels and tastes a few days old.  The salads also taste packaged.  The vegetable side dishes are limp.  I once commented about this to my server at Tessaro's.  Her reply?  \"Oh, honey, this is a bar-and-grill, not a fine dinin' establishment!\"  I laughed and had to agree.\n\nSo go for the burgers.  Get the potato sides.  Have a good cold beer to go with it and you won't be disappointed.  \n\nI see others say that the tables are too tightly packed and you overhear others' conversations.  That's one of the features of a place like this.  It's like one big family meal where you're always meeting new family members.  \n\nOne rule I've come to live by, though:  \"Never order fish/seafood in a steak place and never order steak in a fish/seafood restaurant.\"  That applies to Tessaro's too.  My wife has NEVER had a decent fish entree at Tessaro's.  Not a slam, but an acknowledgment that you can't be everything to everybody.  \n\nA nod of thanks to the \"new\" ownership for keeping the place comfortable and friendly.", "business_id": "vgXE1I7c9ElcfYyZfQiN1Q", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-04-17", "type": "review"}

We were both very excited, my husband loves chicken fried steak and although money is a little tight we wanted to splurge a little for date night. It was busy but we got seated right away and knew within minutes what we wanted to order. We started off with a bowl of chili to share. The chili was very good, with lots of meat and had great flavor. The side salad that accompanied was fine too. Our server was very friendly and attentive. Now on to the main course, and this is where I have to say we were very disappointed. My husband had the chicken fried steak, and yes it was definitely huge, however there was no flavor to it whatsoever. Even the gravy tasted of flour and not much else. A little seasoning (salt & pepper) would have gone a long way. I had the grilled pork chops and mashed potatoes. The pork chops were a little dry, and again under-seasoned, the mashed potatoes were ok, but I could see what my husband was talking about on the gravy. We so wanted this to be a great experience for us but the food just missed the mark. My husband did want to tell the server about it, but I'm always too self-conscious about making a complaint that I begged him to let it go.", "business_id": "18TUn9oiW0k0yB6lheiOvw", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-03-23", "type": "review"}

I generally don't give 5 stars on a first visit and I also don't generally give 5 stars to a chain restaurant, but this place really blew me away. The BF and I went here last night for Restaurant Week. We had actually just gotten our reservation because we had a res somewhere else but then had to be out til after the other place closed....lucky I guess. So anyway, we get there and there is complimentary valet (which I generally find annoying, but was nice last night because we were running late). We came into the restaurant and immediately felt welcome, everyone was very friendly. We were seated right away and our waitress, Sarah, came by to explain the menu. She was super friendly and helpful and really on top of things, so that was nice. \n\n\nOk, the food: After being seated, they bring out an assortment of warm breads with softened butter. And I mean a real assortment: cracker type bread, a roll that looks like an everything bagel, delicious onion bread, and a wheat bread with raisins or some kind of fruit in it....each bread was delicious (take that Atkins!). The BF ordered a Manhattan ($11.50) and said it was 'damn good' and he is a regular Manhattan drinker, so I gotta believe it. So start, I had the french onion soup (on Sarah's recommendation) and the BF had the field greens. The soup was SO good. I generally am not a huge fan of french onion soup because it has a weird texture, but this one was full of flavor and had a ton of cheese on it. I literally was peeling cheese off the side of the bowl and eating it (I know, not so cool in a fancy restaurant...but it was so tasty!). The field green salad was light, with a flavorful, but subtle vinaigrette. It had several types of tomatoes on it, which the BF loved. For mains I had the filet mignon and the BF had the kona sirloin. They came with a little share plate of mashed potatoes and green beans. The sirloin was delicious...it had this amazing sauce on it (don't know what it was, but it has some great caramelized onions in it) and was cooked perfectly. The filet was equally good, it was simple, but cooked to perfection, it was melt in your mouth and had the perfect steak texture (no fat, gristle, anything weird feeling). I will say, the filet was even better with a little of the sauce from the sirloin, but I understand why the serve it the way they do (steak purists and all....). The mashed potatoes were divine. They were some of the most creamy, buttery mashed potatoes I have had. I wanted to lick the plate. The green beans were also delicious, very well seasoned and served with onions....yum! Now on to dessert- We shared the creme brulee and the chocolate espresso cake. Both were amazing.... When I had my first bite of the chocolate cake it was like the most intense chocolate explosion in my mouth. The espresso just adds to the intensity. I will say this, this is a dessert to be shared...it truly is too chocolatey (and large) for one person....and I love chocolate. The creme brulee was equally amazing, it was creamy with just a hint of crunch, but the most impressive part (to me anyway) was it had blackberries on it that had no seeds. What?!?! Where do I get these blackberries? They were phenomenal! \n\nAt the end of the meal, Sarah went outside and had the valet bring our car around before we even left so we didn't have to wait....ummm, seriously awesome service. \n\nSo, overall, the meal was excellent. I probably ate about 3000 calories....sorry thighs....but if I got to choose a place to destroy my diet, this would be it. The restaurant week deal was amazing too because my steak alone was 41$, but the whole meal was 30$ on special. Insanity.

It is many things that add up to an attitude. I have had the opportunity to find it in different cities. I found it the other night at the Stockyards.\n\nWe were seated by a host who took us to our table and when we were properly seated gave us menus.  Our server came to the table and introduced herself and said she would return shortly.  It was nice to have a moment to chat before we had to think about ordering.  When she did return,  our glasses were filled-not something we should have  to wait for her to do when the service is right.  She knew the selections on the menu and all available options and could make sensible comments concerning them.  Our salads were served promptly by two additional people and were as fresh as I could ask for.  When my friend was finished with hers they asked if they could take her plate.  I was pleased when they didn't ask me if I was finished with my salad and could they take my plate.  If I'd been finished I could have told them.  We were able to continue our conversation uninterrupted as I finished my salad.  The salad plate was removed  when it was appropriate and we had a few minutes before the entrees were served.  All was in keeping with a relaxed dining.  At no time did I have to think about having drinks refilled, it just happened quietly.\n\nAfter a few minutes our dinners were served by the two gentlemen and our server appeared to make sure they were to our satisfaction before we started.  There was no room for error there that couldn't be resolved before we started.  \n\nMy friend had ordered a small steak. My friend is  quite elderly and Kathy, our server, discretely asked her if she'd like it cut for her.  A potato also was served with her dish.  I asked my friend which of the condiments she would like it prepared with.  She look at me and said \"Prepared with?\" She didn't understand what I was getting at but Kathy did and was already reaching for the potato.   She opened the potato and smiled while my friend said a bit of everything.  One doesn't go to a restaurant like the stockyards to have to deal with opening a hot potato and preparing it.   When serving is done properly, these things don't have to be discussed.  Kudos to, Kathy!!!.  That is part of the fine dining experience.\n\nI had a full rack of ribs which were so tender the meat fell of them.  The sauce had spice to it but not so strong the flavor of the meat was concealed.  I also can tell you that unless you are a big eater, half a rack would fill most people.  My friend said, \"Yummy!\"  and I agreed.  I am used to getting a finger bowl for clean up after eating, but I can't complain about the two extra napkins and several ways of cleaning my fingers that accompanied my ribs.  \n\nMy friend let them know we were celebrating the 17th anniversary of my 39th birthday so they served me a free desert.  I can assure you the pecan pie is a delight!  Warm and laced with brandy, it was perfect way to finish our dinner.\n\nThe stockyards, I might mention, is not inexpensive, but what an enjoyable way to spend your money. They do offer two dinner specials you won't find at most other places.  They do have a luncheon menu that has lower prices.   Don't expect chrome and music that is a bit to loud as many of the new places offer.  Instead, just enjoy a time and place where they pamper you as you should be when you go to the Stockyards.\n\nI don't consider the stockyards to be a place you where shorts and Nike's, but of course there are always a few.  I would say a nice shirt and slacks at least.", "business_id": "7U8TYNW4Mvx6m3zexsO0sg", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-05-24", "type": "review"}

I feel my wife and I  will become regulars at the Stockyards Restaurant.\n\nOur Dinner came to approximately $140.00 and I left a $50.00 tip.\n\nThank You Stockyards Restaurant.", "business_id": "7U8TYNW4Mvx6m3zexsO0sg", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-03-26", "type": "review"}

I love the Green Goddess, but the wedge looked good too.\n\nThe Stockyards holds its place in Arizona history and does a good job introducing new comers to the time when we were all about cattle and cotton.

Waited 60 mins for a table even though many tables sat vacant.  Even if they were waiting for a reservation, there was plenty of time to feed us before the reserved group showed up.   In the meantime, the  waitress we had at the bar had a melt down  after dropping  a tray of drinks--as a result, she never came back to the table. Only after threatening to leave were we given drinks and shown to a table. The steak was so tough you couldnt cut it with a fork, the Salmon was extremely fishy, and everything else was average and nothing special...band avg as well. Wasted three hours of my life I'll never get back.  Additionally, get ready for parents who love to use this place as a day care service...screaming kids running around unsupervised everywhere.

Overall, the experience is good but nothing to write home about.\n\nOne of my recent visits was on New Year's Eve. I made a reservation ahead of time and the process was perfect. They said upon arrival, if there is a wait for tables we will be bumped to the top of the list. When we arrived, the hosting staff said it was going to be a 30 minute wait. I was a little confused but no point in causing a fuss because we didn't have a strict time schedule for the evening. We walked over to the outside patio to check on the view. Within 5 minutes our buzzer went off and we were seated. Our server was fantastic and friendly. The food was delicious with LARGE portions. And surprisingly not as expensive as i thought it would be.\n\nMy next visit was about a week ago on a Saturday night. We forgot to make a reservation so when we arrived we found out it was going to be an hour wait. We waited maybe 30 minutes before we were seated. Our server, however, was not as wonderful as our visit before. It took 20 minutes to get waters and she kept blaming the bus boys for everything. The food this time was OK. My dad's prime rib came out cold, like it was straight from the fridge. All the side dishes were cold or overcooked. It was a less than stellar experience this time around. If I hadn't been here before, I certainly would not return.\n\nIf you want to give it a shot, I'd say go for it but don't expect the best meal you've ever had. The view and atmosphere is what makes the restaurant.", "business_id": "wZwZcte4lcbu51NOzCjWbQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-03-20", "type": "review"}

The hostess took us to our table, on the way there you can either go the the stairs or go down the slide, of course my 30 year old daughter and I chose the slide while my husband took the stairs and took pictures of us having good old time and laughing hard as we slid down.  After we sat down the waiter greeted us and took our drink order, a minute later someone brought us a big bowl of salad, basket of biscuits and fried bread to share. I ordered the pork chops, every bite I took I was in Ecstasy!  My hubby and daughter ordered the Filets and they enjoyed it too. My hubby said he can cut it with a fork it was so tender. After dinner they bring you a bucket with cotton candy in it to share. Did I mention they have a country band playing while you're enjoying your dinner and looking at the beautiful view!

I mean, I am in Arizona and there are Fleming's restaurants in California, so like any good yelper of course I'm going to want to experience the best and most unique restaurants that Arizona has to offer. However, this just so happens to be my brother's favorite restaurant so he won because this was our family's last supper, of sorts, before we leave him by his lonesome in Phoenix. Well off to Fleming's we went and it was fabulous. For a chain restaurant Fleming's does it right; nice decor, impeccable food, excellent service and over 100 different types of wine. Our server was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and the wine list and checked up on us at all the appropriate moments. The additional support wait staff was very attentive so much so that when (like the klutz that I am) spilled the last sip of wine all over myself, he quickly took my sweater to the bathroom where he blotted it with ice water and handed it back to me in a Fleming's handle bag and recommended that I take it to the dry cleaners and ask that they treat it with the spray that removes wine stains. What a sweetheart! We ordered the sweet chili calamari to start along with a bowl of roasted corn chowder soup with lobster, shrimp and potatoes. I ordered the petite fillet mignon cooked medium rare, my bro had the 20 oz steak and my mom had the Mahi Mahi. All of it was amazing. We finished it off with creme brule and our bill was about 2 bills.

For dessert we got the Creme Brule with the chantilly cream and it was to die for. The manager Bruce stopped by to wish the anniversary couple and see how we were doing, and our waiter presented the couple of the evening with a box of truffles and a $25 gift card, which was a very nice and classy touch.
