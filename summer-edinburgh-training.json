Went up to the bar to order- asked for the selection of ales on tap. Did talk a bit to the bartender about the different ones and I asked for a recommendation with the response that she does not like beer so they all taste bad to her. Honest but not very helpful, we did however go for a pint of some local ale that was alright. The bar downstairs did however not really feel as if it had anything to do with a place that even tries to call itself a Gastro Pub (slightly worn, both guests and the chairs and tables and not very clean)\n\nAfter the first pint we went upstairs instead and there it looked more like a traditional pub dining room. We were quickly shown our table be our waiter and given menus. Started looking at the selection and I was getting my hopes up. Some of the dishes did sound very nice. Wine list was a bit disappointing as I struggled to find anything by the glass that I wanted. Eventually went for a Shiraz that was not bad but still not what I had in mind. In general I would expect better from a Gastro Pub.\n\nBack to the food - I went for the soup of the day. The day in question it was some sort of carrot soup. It was fairly good, a bit too sweet for my taste but not bad at all. The others in the group went for the Haggis spring rolls and the Confit of Duck Leg. The Haggis spring rolls were disappointing, nothing made better by putting Haggis in a spring roll. The Confit of Duck Leg was good but the marmalade and brioche accompanying it did not really match it.\n\nFor mains we also went for a few different choices. I went for the pork chops and the others went for burger and the Fillet of Sole. It was clear that I made the winning choice - the pork chops had been well-prepared and they were flavorful and grilled just the way they should be. The side of mash and vegetables were  however not given the same expert attention. Vegetables were not fresh and the mash did not feel as if it had been made recently. Still the pork chops were good. The burger was your standard pub burger so the type served anywhere - not bad but not anything different than what one can get at most pubs. The Fillet of Sole was ok, small piece of fish but it came with nice spinach and potatoes but it did not really have a lot of flavor and taste.\n\nAll in all it was ok but not great. Still give it a 3 rating since the food was above average but it is a bit misleading to call themselves a Gastro Pub.", "business_id": "aFVO6hoFlOCN8pKsmJbWjw", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-06-23", "type": "review"}

My korma was kind of watery and way too sweet and the other curries my friends had were equally lack lustre. Maybe I went there on a bad day, the other reviews here are really good!\n\n The staff were lovely and the restaurant itself was really nice so it could be worth going back for the two course lunch buffet they offer for \u00a35.95 to give them another try.", "business_id": "5dUDkaxm5FdQanoNkP86KQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-07-28", "type": "review"}

The cinemas seem great, i'm loving the quick ease of purchasing and printing out tickets in the lobby, and the staff are all really friendly an up for a laugh.", "business_id": "T2lP9Ayiua9MOQ-h1F_4yA", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-06-16", "type": "review"}

We sat on the pub side. Crowd was mixed with a fair share of suits but the place was not snooty.  Food is reasonably priced but 2 to 3 pounds more than other pubs.  Haggis was excellent as well as the pasta.  The place is always packed which attests to it's popularity.  A nice change from the usual pubs.", "business_id": "S-B0LVP2shyyX5Fkhmx30A", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-06-25", "type": "review"}
