I'm actually going to give D'moes a 5 star rating for a few reasons. Last Friday, me and my 2 brothers left the suns game, and proceed to put a few \"adult\" beverages back. At around 2am, when Haney's shut down, we had an overwhelming craving for crap pizza (its better than our normal Jack in Box at 3am run that usually ends up with someone puking in the drive thru line because the smell of the taco sauce is so amazing). Low and behold, the ONLY spot that was still taking orders (up to 2am!) was D'moes. Now, 1st off - I live at Summitt (by BOB). These guys gladly delivered to me, all the way down there! Major props for that. 2 - They understood me... considering I don't remember ordering the pizza (I woke up to pizza and wings boxes all over my pad, and me saying \"who ordered pizza\" then I burped... wing sauce and vodka is a healthy combo. 3 - apparently, after checking my voice mail, the driver was pounding on our door for about 5 minutes (we were REALLY jamming out to Rock Band, in case you don't know, were pretty awesome. Wikipedia that Ish ladies and Gent's; Kansas City Bullriders). Well, the driver and my door man both called 3 times. I'm assuming the driver eventually came in and grabbed the bass guitar and strummed it out. Maybe he had a slice with us? Who really knows these things. However, I do know that I was insanely impressed with D'moes... from the left overs I ate the next when I could remember. It was pretty darn good. Between the awesome'ness that is called \"their customer service\" and the legit taste it left in my mouth, I'm a believer, unless, if I say I'm not, will I get a commercial?... hmmmm....

Sadly, this doesn't really do justice since the food was plain 'Meh'\n\n2. I had better food. In fact, the Olive Garden serves better food then this place. The Chicken was warm inside out and the meat sauce tastes a bit sour, like it was getting bad. My SO had the meat balls, but the low lighting made it hard to tell if it was cooked our not. After opening one of the meat balls, it was a bit red. A Manager came and told us, this is how it is due to how the meatballs was cooked. \n\nLike my 2 star rating indicates, I've experience better food. If it wasn't for the decor, I would give his a 1 star, but the feeling of eating in a old house feels great.

Couldn't see it until I returned home and the sunlight revealed exterior body scratches.  Evidently they didn't take care to use clean rags/towels.  Looks like a Brillo pad was used.  Going back tomorrow to see if we can get this rectified.\n\nWell, I'll keep my review the same.  Took my car in this morning to see what could be done.  A \"charming\" older woman (JOVEL) came out to tell me this was definitely not caused by them an it was without a doubt caused by a buffer.  I explained to her that a buffer had not touched my car since it was last detailed by European Detail over six months ago.  To my face she told me I was not providing the truth and if I took it to a BMW dealership they would also confirm I was \"lying\".\n\nGuess what!!  BMW confirmed that the damage was likely caused by rags because of the linear motion that was apparent.  Rick was the gentleman from Los Olivos who accompanied me.  When he also learned that perhaps I wasn't lying as JOVEL had certainly alleged he offered a re-wash and a had wax to correct the problem.  Thank you Rick for obeing a professional.  \n\nEven upon return to the Wash JOVEL was still had her heals dug in refusing to acknowledge any error on their part. \n\nAlthough the business has taken a turn to rectify it was like pulling teeth or pleading a case before the the Supreme Court.

It's a delicate balance that's hard to explain to someone that hasn't eaten one. Some prefer their sandwich on a bagel, others on a croissant. In my last years of Manhattan life I leaned towards toast. So when my eyes feasted on a menu item called \"The Patriot\" I paused.\n\nCrispy Bacon? Ok!\nFried Egg? Ok!\nMelted CHEESE? OK!\nON TOAST? Alright! \n\nLet's try that!\n\nI was hopeful but figured \"Meh\". I was at a sports bar after all on a Sunday. At worst bacon was involved. Out came a heavenly surprise of gooeyness that pleased my palate. I almost wished I had a hangover to test this puppy out. (Bacon, egg and cheese had in my city living rescued me more than a few times.) But, no. I highly recommend this breakfast delight. AND it's beyond reasonably priced! ($4.99)\n\nI visited this bar/restaurant with a group of eight to watch football on a Sunday. There were quite a number of televisions. (In fact, I hadn't realized there were TVs above me.). It's also a really neat place if you're a fan of, obviously, Alice Cooper. The memorabilia covers almost every inch of the walls. I'd recommend enough time to peruse.   \n\nAlthough the food was far beyond what I expected I can't grant more stars. Our service was not ideal. It was rather difficult to obtain any service. (At one point we were flagging down our server as though we were waiving in an airplane.) We did have a reprieve when a gentlemen stepped in who was quite knowledgeable about cocktails. I wish *he* had been our server.\n\nI found it strange given that the restaurant wasn't crowded at 10:30am (yet). Had there been a packed joint - sure - I get it. Also, our table wasn't bussed unless we would ask for plates to be taken away. (And some plates were left to die. Perhaps to compost. We never asked for those to be picked up soooo....) When people order coffee bring them creamer. (Or ask if they want some.) Another example of a service gap: If one person places a food order it would be nice, just as a suggestion, to ask the rest of the table if they're interested in placing a food order. \n\nThere was one other TERRIBLE thing worth noting. \nAs such, I've left this at the end of the review. PARKING.  The following is just an FYI. The lot out back is NOT owned by the restaurant. (I inquired on the way out.) I think this is important however as there's no differentiation to a consumer when you arrive to the restaurant. \n\nMy experience parking was so heinous I filled a BBB complaint. (Yeah, *that* bad.) And I devoted a Yelp review to it as well (here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/arena-park-place-l-p-phoenix#hrid:yi7CY8WilX73OYj7Tl6YjQ) If I had a choice I wouldn't park here.

We unlock futures so that youth in trouble do not become adults in trouble.\"\n\nPhoenix Youth At Risk is a non profit mentoring organization founded in 1987 to help at-risk youth of the greater Phoenix area redirect their lives with the help of adult volunteer mentors. The goal is to help kids and teenagers recognize and expound upon their potential as outstanding citizens.\n\nThey have two programs. The New Pathways Mentoring Program is a 9-month program consisting of one-on-one and group mentoring for teenagers who may otherwise fall through the cracks. The Positive Adult Leaders in Society (P.A.L.S) program matches youth ages 5-15 who are in homeless transitional housing with adult mentors for at least one year. \n\nHaving never mentored in my life, the thought of helping a child was intriguing and scary all at the same time. I decided to jump on board with Phoenix Youth at Risk nearly 2 years ago and was immediately paired with a wonderfully gifted teenage girl. The P.A.L.S program asks that you be able to commit at least one hour a week to taking your youth out for at least one year. You could simply take them out to lunch, out bowling, to a museum, to your home, or the like. \n\nYou become a positive influence in their life through just being you. It's an incredibly simple premise, yet one that can leave a lasting impression for years to come, for both mentor and mentee!\n\nJoining this organization was one of the best decisions I've ever made. There's no greater joy than helping a child see their full potential and I can say that the joy my youth gives me is the same, if not greater than the joy I give her.\n\nIf you want to make a lasting impression in a child's life, please consider Phoenix Youth at Risk as a valuable life changing experience for both you and your youth!

It was still an operating pharmacy and soda fountain as recently as 1991, at which time the pharmacy side of the business surrendered to new era competition. Fortunately, the soda fountain remains. \n\nI'm awarding five stars, partly out of annoyance with snarky one and two star reviewers unaware of the spot's historical significance, but mainly out of love for MacAlpine's ice cream concoctions. Moreover, how can you not award five stars to the establishment where Wayne Newton was discovered in 1962? Note to the one and two star reviewers: Wayne Newton is an American singer and entertainer who is best known for his 1963 hit song Danke Schoen and more recently as a surgically enhanced Las Vegas headliner.\n\nI must confess that I'm not a huge fan of the food at MacAlpine's. How often do you read that in a five star review? Let me clarify. The menu is fine, but why would you want to risk eating a Sloppy Joe and not leaving room for a sundae? Another note for prospective one and two star reviewers: The ice cream at MacAlpine's is not hand crafted. It's basic ice cream, served in a manner consistent with the tradition of a soda fountain. Just as it should be. If you want Sweet Republic or Churn like flavors, go to those establishments and please don't write a negative review for MacAlpine's. \n\nMacAlpine's is amazingly kid friendly. Also friendly for anyone else who still has a little bit of kid within. There are roughly 100 flavors of soda from which to choose. One hundred!!! Want a sundae instead? How about Bears at the Beach, a Carousel or Dirt & Worms? They also have a variety of sundaes that cater more to adult tastes (if you must). Or instruct the waitress construct the customized treat of your dreams. The location on Seventh Street is an ideal stopping place before or after a downtown trip to the Science Center, a Dbacks game... Note to one and two star reviewers: Sure, there is a lot of dusty and worn old stuff on the premises. Just remember, you too will one day be old and worn if you're lucky enough to make it over 80 years (and it wouldn't be polite to point it out to you). I suggest you travel back in time and embrace MacAlpine's quirky nature.

It is quite beautiful inside the unique botanical garden focusing on local desert flora. Lots of placards abound to tell you the different names of the cacti, aloe, and agave. There are probably 5 sections to the gardens that take about 5 minutes or each to walk around the walkway loop. One focuses on I believe on hummingbirds so the plants attract a good amount of hummingbirds if you have the patience to watch for them. I thought that for the admission price, what you got what pretty fair. The grounds are immaculate, though perhaps smaller than I expected. Staff are friendly. Since it is an outdoor tourist attraction on essentially the surface of the sun, staff on golf carts run around hydrating tourists who will certainly not be prepared for such oven heat. \n\nThe Chihuly addition to the gardens I have mixed feelings. On the one hand, it adds some pizzazz to the grounds. On the other, it looks sort of forced, out of place, and more of a PR stunt to get tourists to come.

In those sorts of places, you need to 'earn your respect', in a way.\nI'm not a jeweler and so they don't bother to look at me one way or another. \n\nBut If you go in this store as a jeweler, be aware that they are probably sizing you up when you come in. These people may want either evidence that you know what you're doing, or willingness to ask them questions and have them share their knowledge with you.  Those sorts of places can have little respect for amateurs unless the amateurs come in with a willingness to acknowledge the expertise there and ask to have some of it. \n\nThat attitude can come off as pretentious or demeaning, but really it's just a very old-fashioned way of thinking. And jewellery is an old-fashioned art.\n\nHopefully that helps if you are a jeweler in the phoenix area looking for some supplies. Don't go in this store expecting modern customer service, because most people in this site have not found it. Pretend you are in the Middle Ages, and you are an apprentice going into a skilled artisan's store. That artisan probably demands respect in a way most modern people don't.

However the service was lacking quite a bit. \n\nFirst, when I got there I was the first to arrive out of my group, my event coordinator didn't get in that early and was not there to greet me or show me around, nor did anyone else bother to show me to the event room or how to get where I was going. I take that back, the girl at the front desk handed me a map and pointed me in a somewhat vague direction that didn't help much. I was told I would have easy access to the room to unload my car at, well without any employees to show me the access door I had to hoof my boxes from the parking lot around the building the long way. I did not find that back door until long after the seminar started. The room we were scheduled in was changed last minute for some reason, I believe  it has something to do with the final head count that we gave them. The room we ultimately in was a bit cramped for the number of attendees we had. \n\nI had to introduce myself to the catering manager and chef. No one came in to remove the places and trash from breakfast until almost 11 a.m. nor did they check on us. The boxed lunches weren't made right, only upsetting a few clients, but still.... I had to pop into the kitchen myself a few times and track someone down to help me. With the amount of money we were paying, it should have been perfect. For a cheap continental breakfast and a mediocor box lunch it was about $40 per head, kind of a lot. \n\nOver all my seminar went well at the hotel, but there were some behind the scenes issues that I really wish I did not have to deal with throughout the day. I wouldn't not recommend this hotel for you event, just make sure to cover everything prior to your event. Such as on sight contact, exactly how the food will be prepared, appropriate signage and whatnot. \n\n**I have not spend a night at this hotel so this review should not reflect on making overnight reservations.", "business_id": "LtJszEtHhXMZR0y6lbdswA", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-10-29", "type": "review"}

I had a free kid coupon from the savvy shopper which put admission for my daughter and me @ $20. Not bad. \nGet there early. Parking is a nightmare around lunchtime. Avoid photo vultures at entrance upon arrival. \n\nWe walked in and decided to hop on the safari train for an extra $5 each. For the size of this zoo, that was the best idea EVER. We went clear around the African trail and surprisingly saw most animals and decent views as well. I have walked that trail before and seen NOTHING so I was happy with that. \n\nAfter that we hopped off the train and walked to the exhibits you miss from the train. Orangutans must have all been sleeping. Boo. That's usually the best part. Bears were out, which is usually not the case. Little monkey exhibit is VERY cool, only problem is the little kids who run around and scare the monkeys back into the trees.

Not very busy on a Sunday afternoon around 4 PM...overpriced and certainly light-on-the-tequila margaritas...plenty of chips and salsa being delivered to the table...entrees that took WAY too long to be delivered...portion size and presentation leaving much to be desired...and the waiter kept our water glasses full.\n\nWould you be satisfied with an order of rolled tacos which list on the menu as coming topped with  guacamole?  When the cheese is sprinkled on so lightly that you can count the shred strands on each one?  When the guacamole is served in a 2-ounce solo cup on the side?  I think not!\n\nAnother in my party ordered a chicken soft taco and a bean and cheese burrito...the chicken was in shreds, like someone in the kitchen boiled breast, thighs and legs and subsequently shredded them with a fork.  The worst part was no seasoning...save for the salsa served with the chips.  The bean and cheese burrito was a study in rice...so much rice that it was difficult to find the beans and cheese in the burrito.\n\nThe fourth in our group ordered the nachos supreme.  The chips are advertised as coming smothered in beef or chicken (he chose beef),\ncheese, refried beans, tomatoes, sour cream and guacamole.  Again, the guacamole came on the side in a 2-ounce solo cup as well as the sour cream.  They were not requested on the side...but they came that way. \n\nAs I am in search of the best guacamole burrito on the planet, that is what I ordered...a burrito that is guacamole, sour cream, bacon, cheese and raw onion.  The burrito I received...got the guacamole...got the cheese...got the sour cream...missing the onion...and some really fatty bacon.  It has been a long time since I had a guacamole burrito that chewy.\n\nMargaritas were just a flat-out mistake.  I guess you have to know someone behind the bar to get much more than the faint whisper of a tequila bottle being passed in front of the glasses.  When they are delivered, they look incredible...the glasses filled perfectly...the salt on the rim done so well you could take a measuring tape to the glass and find perfect consistency all the way around.  While I enjoy the look of a well-presented margarita, I wanna feel and taste tequila in it!\n\nMaybe this works for the family 'hispanic eatery down the street'...it does not do so well for me.", "business_id": "jzPMl-NoB5F2fwoHX3hN8A", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-11-07", "type": "review"}

Their 3003 N Central Ave. # 118 Phoenix address can be very misleading. There isn't any signage or entrance on N. Central Ave.  Instead, it's all on the side street, Catalina Dr.\n\nCranberry Hills offers breakfast and lunch for dine-in, to-go pickup or delivery and catering. For breakfast, they offer a selection of omelets, egg sandwiches, baked goods and fruit. Their lunch menu consists of standard items such as cold sandwiches, salads, pasta, pizza, soups and bakery items. \n\nEverything on the menu is extremely reasonably priced. You can walk out the door with a huuuuge salad for less than $7. They also offer their salads in half sizes as well. The food is all around average. The ingredients could be a little fresher at times, and I'm not too keen on the amount of iceberg lettuce that gets thrown into their salads. However they don't skimp on the toppings. Those extras get piled on top. This place is also CROWDED at lunch time. Everyone in that office park seems to eat there daily, and the parking is awful.\n\nMy favorite on the menu is #48 - the Orchard salad with a standard bed of greens, chicken strips, oranges, apples, jicama, dried cranberries and walnuts, served with country French dressing (that I usually switch out for their Roasted Red Pepper Fat Free dressing, just so save those extra calories). \n\nI've also used this place for catering before and for the price it's very economical and fast. They will drop off your order and set up a really awesome and professional salad bar complete with all the fixings - salad mix, nuts, cheeses, an assortment of dressings, turkey, ham, chicken, fruit, tortilla strips, etc. I've also used Cranberry Hills Catering for those last moment \"oh no I forgot to order lunch and the meeting is in 4 hours from now\" situations. They've saved the day for me countless times!\n\nI wouldn't go out of my way to get their food for just an individual order. I mainly recommend this place for catering in addition to those last minute office lunch emergencies.

I have been to many women gynos (sorry, no dudes up in my lady-business) and I've had good ones and I've had atrocious ones.\n\nMy atrocious experiences have all been in Phoenix, so I had been without an ob-gyn for several months until a co-worker recommended Dr. Cyr. Lucky for me, I struck GOLD! Dr. Cyr, you're not allowed to retire. Sorry. (Don't worry, she's young; she won't retire anytime soon).\n\nCut to the chase. Reasons why Dr. Cyr is amazing:\n\n1) She doesn't make me feel like a creepy weirdo for not being married nor wanting kids anytime soon. SERIOUSLY, I got grief from ob-gyns for 'not being ready for a family yet.' Um, guys, I can't even feed myself on a regular basis, and you want me to have a kid? Major fail. Dr. Cyr DOES NOT DO THIS. She didn't even bring up me wanting kids now or in the future. Thanks, Dr. Cyr!\n\n2) I didn't wait a million hours to see her! At my last gyno doctor (who shall remain nameless), I waited 2 hours for my appt. Wtf?? Here, I waited no more than 20 minutes, and that was because I was filling out paperwork. YAY!\n\n3) Dr. Cyr answered my questions professionally and fully. She didn't shirk around my more... awkward... questions, and she explained the options to me in plain English. She reassured me on some things that I was worried about, and she even made me laugh in the process. I NEVER laugh at the doctors! This is amazing!!\n\nOn a less quantifiable basis, I felt Dr. Cyr just 'got' me. It's hard to explain, but I felt comfortable talking to her and felt I could bring any issue up and she wouldn't judge me for it. \n\nShoot, I think I want to have a baby with Dr. Cyr now.

No gaming crowd hanging around, the staff is always amicable and helpful, I can always expect to be greeted at the door with a friendly smile and welcoming attitude. The store is clean, well lit and easy to navigate. New releases are in alphabetical order and have the last few months issues nearby in case you missed something. One of the best features of this establishment is the collection of consignment books, packaged together as runs at VERY reasonable prices. If you are looking for a specific story line, or filling in gaps in your collection, check this section out as they always have a great selection. The interior displays are always changing, with over stock deals, grab bags and more packaged runs rotating in on a regular basis. Their trade collection is second to none. They have a great back issue selection on the floor, and if its not in the bins, they probably have it out back. Their claim of \"over 1 million comics in stock\" is easy to believe.\n\nSome other reviewers have complained that the store doesn't have couches and chairs, but that is fine with me. I tend to avoid the stores with lots of people hanging around for two reasons: 1) the books are probably all messed up and read, and 2) those stores tend to have the clich\u00e9 clubhouse/comic book fanboy feel; if you aren't part of the club, you aren't welcome. NEVER had that vibe here. \n\nI've also seen complaints that the prices for some items are high, based on other stores in the valley. I've never felt that here either. The prices are very competitive and again, the multi issue packs are always a FANTASTIC value. I've bought tons of stuff here, and never felt ripped off. In fact, I've picked up runs that i would probably never have looked at before, simply because they are packaged together already, so I don't have to dig through the bins, and they are being offered at a very reasonable price.  \n\nI've probably tried all the shops in the valley, and this is the one to beat.

He said the pepperoni thin pizza, rigatoni and salad were his very favorite.\n\nOn our first Sunday evening in Phoenix, we make it priority to have dinner here. He did warn us that it's a very busy place.  So we arrived after 8pm and coincidentally parked right in front of the \"welcome\" sign. Again the parking gods were looking after us. If's most unusual for us to be offered water while waiting outdoors for our table. As it turns out we eventually get seated outdoor at a bar table for two. This is where we meet our server Lucas along with his manager Jonny (yes, it's not a misspelling).\n\nTold them that our PDX hotel concierge had been touting about their entrees. We proceeded to order the following mindful that we're intentionally over ordering and that the servings are huge in portions:\n\n- Jr Pablo Picasso Salad\n- Big Rig Pasta adding two meatballs to this rigatoni dish\n- Numero One-0 12\" thin crust pizza\n\nI think we had to be careful not to attempt to finish everything that was in front of us. It was all very very good. As a welcome to Phoenix gesture, Jonny treated us to their Pizza Cookie Chocolate Chip with chocolate mint Ice cream. By the time we were ready to hit the bed, it was very close to closing time.\n\nNote:  The pizza didn't make it past bedtime.  In the meanwhile it was salad and Big Rig for lunch the next day.  My classmates keep looking me as if I was a meal on wheels.\n\nOTHER TRIP\n\nDidn't know that our class would run so late that it eliminated many of our restaurants we had listed that closed at 8pm and 9pm.  Intentionally we keep a number of them along the 16th Street corridor.\n\nSo Yu-go chauffeur says let's go back to Oregano's and say hi to Jonny and Lucas.  This time we're seated indoors where its quite cool with all the red and green.  Asked Jonny to recommend something other than what we had tried previously.  This time we're more conscious of portions.\n\n- Junior sized Beefstro Salad that's spicy\n- Clark Street Meat 12\" thin crust pizza\n- Pizza Cookie Chocolate Chip with two different flavors of ice cream (told Jonny that we would buy our dessert this time. He still comped us)\n\nWhen it was all said and done, there was nothing to take back to the hotel.\n\nMANGA TALE\n\nThe pizza crust is flat bread thin and crispy so that we didn't feel like we were filling up with pizza dough.. Perhaps I would instruct them to cook it for a few seconds longer just to ensure that the crust remained crispy throughout our eating experience. Our personal preference would be the Clark Street Meat and Big Rig Pasta.  Both salads finished tied.\n\nA very big thanks to \"Aire-Bear\" of PDX for this wonderful experience.

(It's a shame that Phoenix is lacking on options when it comes to Noodle Houses; Chicago, New York, and DC have noodles galore but we're not there yet I guess.)  Anyways, Cherryblossom has a welcoming ambiance and decent service too. I've been a few times, so I figured it would be the perfect place to stop for a late dinner last night after Urban Affair.  (It was Friday night around 9:30, so no problem getting in and seated right away).\n\nWe sat at the bar and got drinks immediately.  Since the BF had already eaten a bunch of appetizers at the event we were at, he said he'd just share whatever I ordered.  So, I chose the miso eggplant appetizer and the Yaki Udon Noodle entree with tofu.  The eggplant dish was really tasty but they served it straight from the stove and we both burned our mouths taking the first bite.  We had to let it sit another few minutes to cool down enough to eat it.  (Note - I'm not complaining; I'd rather have my food served too hot than not hot enough... )  \n\nWe finished the eggplant dish up right as the noodle dish arrived.  The noodles themselves were cooked just right but the dish had a weird flavor to it.  It just didn't taste right, or maybe it was just nothing special.  Either way, I would skip the Yaki Udon and go for something else on the menu when you go.\n\nAlthough I wouldn't rave about the food on my most recent visit to Cherryblossom, it was quick and cheap for a latenight dinner.

It was just okay.  The sauce was very rich.  Almost overwhelming.  I forced my self to keep eating.  I don't think I will order that again.\n\nCherry Blossom creates a nice environment and the prices are right.  No wonder it is crowded.  When I return I will try something else.  After all the menu is huge.  Something has to be good on there.  Three stars.", "business_id": "AkOruz5CrCxUmXe1p_WoRg", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-10-26", "type": "review"}

Our server was very friendly & even though it was busy, we were greeted at the door & sat quickly. \n\nUnfortunately, it was downhill from the point we got our food. We ordered an assortment of rolls & a dish of pad Thai. The sushi choices almost all include cream cheese &/or tempura, which made it difficult to choose a variety without everything tasting similar.\n\nThe sushi all tasted fishy. I don't think it was unfresh, but it certainly didn't taste fresh either. It was somewhere in between the two...if that is possible.

I returned the next morning to return both items as my camera was stolen. \n\nI was told the store did not accept returns on battery chargers. I was told the policy existed because of people like me [who were from out of town]. I was told these people forgot their chargers at home and would buy the item, use it, and return it. I felt as if my integrity was being questioned. I felt my integrity being quesstioned. While I undertsand the compelxities of owning ande running a private camera shop, I felt the store did nothing to make amends. While I try to support private business, this situation maes me want to go to one of the \"big chain\" stores with a more \"liberal\" return policy. \n\nThe packages were unopened and factory sealed! What could have made this experience  better was being told about the return policy when I purchased the items. I lost $40 on a $70 purchase. Rather than being told beforehand about the policy, I was told after the fact \"You should have read the return policy\". I do not know anyone who stops to read the return policy before making a purchase. I learned my lesson. I will always ask about a store's return policy before making a purchase.\n\nI strongly caution you to read their policies before buying anything.

I just had my SUV in for brake service as recommended from the dealer but didn't want to pay the dealer prices.  The brakes were more costly than I thought due to an issue with how they were wearing which John the store mgr. pointed out and walked me through in the shop.  I also had to replace my shock absorbers which were leaking and already had a quote from this from the dealer but these guys were much much less so I agreed to have them do the work.\n\nThere was an issue with the shocks that they ordered the wrong items as my SUV has air suspension shocks so there was some extra time that was needed to complete the job.  The great part was these shocks were twice as much as what was quoted to me for my total repair price and John still honored his initial quote where most places would've charged me extra for that.  \n\nLastly, the communication was excellent and John kept me in the loop all day.  We discovered around 7pm that the job wouldn't be done in time before they officially closed but I really needed my car the next day for work and meetings and they stayed open until almost 9pm to finish the job and he didn't hesitate at all about doing it.\n\nI wish more companies had the integrity that they have.

Instead, I said hello to a beautiful slice of peach cobbler :D  While I cannot eat raw peaches anymore (a pity really, since I only started eating fresh, not canned, peaches around 2 or 3 years ago and LOVE them!), I've found that cooked peaches are safer for me, which I am thankful for.  I recall thinking that the cobbler was good.  \n\nMusicians started to set up around 8, and the first band began playing at 9p.  I enjoyed the many bands that performed that night.
