They have done an amazing job of decorating the place! While it IS dark inside, there is ample light to enjoy the various painting and mirrors on the walls and ceiling. There are quite a number of beautiful sculptures and vases throughout too.\n\nThere isn't a cover to get into the Afterhours party. Just show your ID and you're walking into a thumping techno party with some excellent house beats. The DJs are a lot of fun and the crowd there is very chill with a great appreciation for this type of music.\n\nThe alcohol flows generously and the costs are pretty reasonable. I don't remember specific prices, but I haven't ever felt like I was being ripped off.\n\nWhile the dance floor area is a little small, it's still a lot of fun to groove with the electro beats as the DJ moves the crowd. Even better still is when you're hot and sweaty and want to relax, there are a number of VERY comfortable chairs, couches and love seats to relax on.\n\nFine leather furniture doesn't seem to match with the house/club music scene, but it really works well at the Artisan. For a little fresh air, try heading out to the patio too.\n\nAs far as off-the-strip Afterhours electronic music parties go, this one is as good as it gets.", "business_id": "VZyE9u5-gAG62zfe53hXWA", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-07-04", "type": "review"}

The reason why  I chose this boutique hotel, was because my husband and I were traveling to Vegas with our two dogs.  Even though most of the big hotels in LV accept dogs now, it is extremely difficult to have to walk far distances to get to the elevators, across the million of people, and the casino just to take you dogs to go potty! Good luck with that! the ARTISAN Hotel was just PERFECT!! it is only 4-5 floors high, so you can take the elevator or just simply the side stairs in be at the lobby level within a minute! There is a great area on the back, just after you pass the pool with gravel and yard, very private and you can take your dogs there for their potty time!  The staff was soooo nice, helpful and extremely accommodating!!! they are very dog friendly as the guests staying there as well, so you will feel very comfortable!! The rates are also very affordable. Some hotels will charge you an arm and a leg for a \"pet fee\" . Being a dog owner, I know the difficulties we go thru with our pooches all the time we travel and the staff at Artisan made our stay very relaxing! Drake at the front desk was extremely nice too! \nDon't let the minor stars reviews guide you.  There is nothing sketchy about the location either.  The hotel is located right off the Sahara exit, which is conveniently located within 5 minutes to the strip! We used to live in Las Vegas, so we are very familiar to all the exits and short cuts, so for us the location was very convenient and away from the busy strip! \n\nGive it a shot and i think you will be pleased! :)", "business_id": "VZyE9u5-gAG62zfe53hXWA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-06-14", "type": "review"}

I think due to the 24/7 hours, they've changed the way they make their food and it's no good. \n\nThe pho isn't good at all. The soup doesn't have the beef flavor in it at all, it just doesn't taste how pho should taste. \n\nThe service here sucks. You're already waiting in a long ass line just to finally get in and wait some more. Once you're seated, the waiter/waitress will just give you your menus and leave...not even dropping off water. Sometimes it'll take almost 30mins until they comeback to take the order. \n\nThe last two times I went were not good at all. \n\nI went with my friend and we were seated in a corner and completely forgotten about. \n\nAnother time, I went with my parents and sister. My sister ordered the chow fun and the waiter messed up our chow fun order with another. When we told him the order was wrong, he got the chow fun from the other table and gave it to us to eat...the other table had already eaten out of it...\n\nThe prices have gotten a lot more expensive as well.", "business_id": "FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-08-07", "type": "review"}

I can't say enough good things about this school, but I will try.  Our family is Chinese so it was important to us that our daughter learn our language, not just English.  What I hadn't considered was how much more she would learn from all of her great teachers at NCA. They are very kind and caring.  She knows her ABCs, 123s, colors, shapes, writing, reading, and math (addition and subtraction - in double digits no less).  My husband and I were just constantly amazed at the level of classwork that she was bringing home to show us and the wonderful part is that she loved learning.  NCA established a good foundation for her when she enters the public school system.  We wish NCA offered Kindergarten, but sadly it does not, but I intend to have her return to NCA in the summer for Mandarin as a Second Language courses as she grows.  Children of all nationalities attend, not just Chinese students.  She has English, African-American, and Hispanic classmates, among others so just because it's called Nevada Chinese Academy, it doesn't mean it's just for Chinese people.  \n\nI would highly recommend this school to any parent of preschoolers.  It offers great value for what it would cost to put your child in daycare.  This is so much more than having someone watching them play all day.  I am so grateful that we found this school and wish that we had found it sooner so she could have been at NCA longer, but at least we know she is going to enter Kindergarten with pretty advanced skills.

We totally killed it! \n\nThe service was okay, kind of forgot our rice until we mentioned it again but then again 3 people working on a Friday night umm yea that should explain it. But they checked up on us a few times so yay! \n\nIf your not an all you can eat person and don't like to cook your own meat then they do offer another menu, but it is totally worth doing the all you can eat.", "business_id": "UKKz4HdQC0aH9j5lLi4u8Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-06-25", "type": "review"}

We all know that it is such a hassle to find reliable, honest mechanics. After browsing through the many places touted on here, I brought my car over to Japanese Car Service to get a faulty alternator changed out as well as anything else related to the Check Engine Light. I can tell you right now, I chose the right spot.\n\nAfter being informed on what was wrong with my car, I authorized the work order to replace the alternator and a faulty knock sensor. When I came in the next day, Keita Tanaka (the owner of Japanese Car Service) discovered that there was an O2 Sensor code that was coming up, and he wanted to give the car a further look. That was alright by me, since I wanted to make sure there weren't any outstanding problems with my car, so I kept it there another night.\n\nWhen my work day was over I swung by the shop and Keita stated that he felt bad for not catching the O2 sensor at first, so he ended up repairing the O2 Sensor for free and didn't charge for the part nor labor! I can't think of any other shop that would do this - most other shops would quickly take advantage of the situation.\n\nDuring his test drive of my car after replacing the O2, the crankshaft pulley became loose, effectively snapping the belt and messing up the pulley itself (I have had issues in the past with it before) - Keita ended up taking my car back to his shop, repaired it and only charged me for the relevant parts and allowed me to skip on the labor! The labor alone on that job would have been a couple hundred dollars.\n\nFor each part replaced, Keita physically brought the original pieces for my examination as well as invoices for the new parts, which gave me peace of mind that the work was actually done on my car. On top of that, I'm due to register my car relatively soon - and Keita knew of this - so before I took off, he told me to stop by the shop after I put 120 more miles on the odometer just so he can be sure that everything is good to go before I go for the smog check. How awesome is that?\n\nNow, if I brought my car to the dealership, I would have easily paid at least twice as much as I did at Japanese Car Service. I can say that I left the shop feeling very satisfied and well looked after - I can now rest easy, knowing where I can go to take care of my auto needs without questioning reliability, pricing and honesty.", "business_id": "vnKzoJr2C2YOTSQPt_F-tA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-06-21", "type": "review"}

Note that these salsas aren't especially spicy, but they have a marvelous depth of flavor that really adds to your food- I went through two cups of each style with just one burrito!", "business_id": "-NXDZfqwfZ9OWba180HqFw", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-08-08", "type": "review"}

Gun aiming was horribly off-center (and I'm a shooter in real-life so this can't be attributed to my own incompetence.)\n\nI went to play Star Wars Trilogy. THE JOYSTICK WAS BROKEN, with the cursor stuck at the right side of the screen. \n\nAnd then I went to play the crane machine. The controls were sluggish and hardly responsive at all. \n\nNot to mention every game had a TWO token cost, with the exception of a few that cost a little more. The arcade is only about a quarter the size of those at other Station Casinos. Granted, it's a \"nice\" area, but there are so few games to choose from, and what little there is doesn't work right. \n\nSave your money before you play any of the games in here. If you're 21 or older, just go stick it in a slot machine. It's a gamble whether or not any machine in here will even work right!\n\nHands down one of the worst arcades this reviewer has experienced.

After making the drive up after work on Friday, we arrived at valet who was quick and courteous. We received the same treatment when arriving at the main lobby for check-in. I did find it a little weird that the front desk employees were unsure if they provided spa services or not. Not a big deal. The drive was long and we just wanted to get to our room to relax a little.\n\nWe were not offered any bellhop service so I grabbed as many of the bags that I could carry while the wife grabbed the remaining and we made our little walk to the Courtyard. I knew it was going to be bad when we had to exit out of the AC cooled casino into the sweltering Vegas heat (20 feet) before continuing back into the next building.  We were placed on the second floor where there is conveniently no elevator. \n\nUpon entering into the dirty, dingy room, we blast the AC to help cool off. When walking around the room, we both notice pockets of warm air that the AC can't seem to get rid of. The view was honestly the worst view of ANY Vegas experience I had. It was of the other rooms in the Courtyard.\n\nWell we were starving and our information book was actually missing the page with info for the restaurants so we hit the buffet. It was only $8 but pretty damn bad. The carnitas was surprisingly not horrible. Everything else was.. Especially the banana cr\u00e8me and coconut cr\u00e8me pies we tried for dessert.\n\nMy wife was trying to be a good sport about it all but I could tell she was disappointed. If I was there solo, I MIGHT of just sucked it up but I knew my wife deserved something better. We ended up checking out a day early and moved over to Palms Place where I got a studio suite. It was a bit pricier being last minute but worth every damn penny. \n\nIf you're looking for a cheaper, off strip, casino/hotel, check out South Point. I stayed there before with family and it wasn't too bad. Buffet was a lot better too. I'll never return to the Palace Station.

It had 2 sections of large tables with the tatami style seating.  It was pretty quaint.  The lamps were really dope. They were homemade and it looked like philo dough bound with a fish grill on it. It was pretty impressive. They also had the typical hand made signs of the specials plastered all over the bar.\n\nThe service was spotty unfortunately however our waitress was really cute with a cute Japanese accent.  When asked about recommendations, there were none.... she replied that everything was good.\n\nDon't come here being extremely hungry... the portions are smaller than the typical sake houses in LA, but hey, its supposed to be appetizers, right?\n\nThe karrage Chicken was really good- tender and not too much batter... the pork and kimchi was delicious... the chicken wings and yakatori were not very good. Perhaps adding some fresh wasabi and lemon juice would have kicked it up a notch??? Agadashi Tofu was weak in flavor.. have had better in LA.\n\nBest dish of the night?  The sea bass which was delicious and excellent. Highly recommended. Very moist and perfectly cooked in a sweet soy sauce.

Pretty good, or just better than the spider roll.  \n\nEel roll (3 stars): Probably the best roll out of the 3 I tried. Flavorful, not dry. Just not very healthy because of the fried stuff on top. \n\nBlack cod fish (4 stars): Perfectly cooked. Best thing I had here. \n\nSERVICE (2 stars):\nDidn't get menus, chopsticks, or plates until we asked for them. It's also really hot inside, hotter than outside, and this is Las Vegas in the summer we're talking about! It also smelled inside. We had a big group so we got one of the back tables where you need to take your shoes off to sit down...probably why the place smelled.  Who knows what's on peoples feet..gross!\n\nOverall, not a place for rolls. I really didn't like any of them that much, just ate cause I was hungry. Stick to entrees maybe?

I just get off the I15 and, here we are. At that point, I'm not looking for anything super delicious or anything... I just want something in my belly to fill me up and last me a while, seeing as I have to get home to do laundry, getting stuff ready, buying groceries...\n\nOn more than one occasion, I've come here and it's been empty. That's actually the default situation here, it seems: the dining area will be about 95% empty, and there'll be a few guys manning the kitchen. That doesn't really present a problem for me, because people or not, I need to eat. But since it's always empty, I can usually walk right up to the counter and have someone take my order in 30 seconds or less: teriyaki turkey burger, hold the cheese, criss-cut fries, ranch, Sprite. As far as I'm concerned, this is the best meal in the place. Sure, the $6 burgers are great, too, but they're also about 1000 calories. (I know the Sprite, ranch, and fries aren't the best idea, but that's why I get the turkey sans cheese!)  I usually get my food out to me fairly quickly, and it's consistently pretty good. My only major gripe with them is that their bread seems to always be the worst bread ever. I don't understand it. It's bad on the turkey burgers, and it's passable on the premium burgers. Maybe it's because these guys are so liberal with their sauce that the bread absorbs it? That's my current theory. \n\nAlso, the prices here are on the higher side. I've always felt there's a scale for fast-food restaurant prices: starts at McDonald's on the low side and ends with Carl's on the higher side. The food here is better than McD's, so I guess it's ok. But just be aware of that.\n\nAs far as this location goes, it is clearly not on the best side of town.

I took my family there on our last day in Vegas before the drive back to AZ. Quick example of the hospitality and service we received before I review how wonderful the food is...We arrived just before noon and made our way to a corner table next to the soda cooler. There was another patron waiting for her carry out order sitting next to us. While we were looking at the menu, the carry out order came out and the customer left. Before we knew it, Russell came out and insisted we moved to the next table. He was concerned that we'd be uncomfortable from the heat coming off the refrigerator. It may not seem like a big thing, but just the fact he'd go out of his way to make sure we were comfortable before we could feel any discomfort was so refreshing! I read all the other reviews talking about how genuine Russell is, but you can't believe it until you experience it.\n\nNow, the food! After reading other reviews, I needed to make sure we sampled as much as we could and I can honestly say Russell delivers! My oldest son had the combo (bbq chicken, kalbi ribs, and meat jun), my youngest had the saimin, my wife the spicy beef soup, and I had the Bi Bim Bap. I'm am so happy we tried all the different dishes. No one was disappointed with what they got. The food came out fast, hot, and in huge portions. It was everything we could hope for and then some.\n\nOne other observation I can't pass up. The place has such a neighborhood feel to it. The dining room filled up quickly after we arrived with locals that were obvious regulars.  It almost felt like a backwards \"Cheers\". Instead of everyone greeting Norm coming to the bar, greetings of \"Hey Russell!\" from the majority of the people walking in the door!\n\nRussell is so inviting and his food is so comforting, I wish him nothing but years of success. I know I'll be back as soon as we go back to Vegas! Mahalo!", "business_id": "xxOQ7h6s3InV8o8DOVHlMA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-07-21", "type": "review"}

Plus if local food not your thing they have another whole section of the menu of Chinese. No doubt is coming too Island Style need too go local style!!!!!\n\nI keep hearing about the Meat Jun and its something always always been fan of when it comes too korean food. Toss up between Meat Jun and Kali bi. Only winnahs either or both. The Meat Jun was Amazing!! I love the fact that the egg batter outside not too thick but just right amount of coating not see the meat until dig in, outside nice golden brown, the meat inside has nice seasonings, and meat was moist. Tradition local style white rice and mac salad. I liked the mac salad. The portion size is great! All of it under ten dollars. Is there better deal for lunch?? Think not! Hawaiian food always get your money worth and more....\n\nOne of the highlights was the sides that your meal came with at Island Style. Moist Korean restaurants been too can be hit or miss the amount they give plus the different types you get. Here you get five different ones. Although it was only me they were very generous with everything. Korean kim chee fan for life. The kim chee here not hot hot but still good. The roasted peanut action. Now if that doesn't speak too keeping it local style not sure what else can say.  It comes with anything you order almost like bread no charge. They even put it in a to go container so can take it home. Sweet! \n\nThe service was great! U can tell local owners and care about putting out good local grinds. They just expanded couple weeks ago so restaurant is lot bigger. I went for lunch so the place was not too packed. Parking can be issue if go when busy since only parking in front of the restaurant.

My baby was comfortable also with him, you can see and feel the love he has for animals.  When my babies test came back he called, spent time on the phone talking to me about his blood tests. He went way beyond my expectations. He deserves more than a five star.  The place was clean, the staff was friendly and helpful. I can go on and on how pleased I was with this doctor and his facilities. I'm a 100% satisfied and relieved that I found my babies a great doctor to look after there care. If your looking for a vet for your babies, this vet is worth checking out. If I was a cat I would want Dr. A as my doctor.", "business_id": "1l1fzLk3lg8rjH7xa5k8mA", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-07-11", "type": "review"}

I've been off and on trying to find a delicious barbecue pork bun (cha siu bao) because it's certainly been a very long time.  The last two delicious ones I can remember were from Chinatown in San Francisco and a delicious Asian supermarket back in Arlington, Texas (it's between Dallas and Fort Worth, but pretty much famous for the new Cowboys stadium).\n\nAfter turning to Yelp, this place popped up and I saw it was open super early - score!  I promptly got directions and off I went.\n\nDrove west down Spring Mountain and to my dismay, missed it.  If you're coming from the 15 South, it's on the left BEFORE the Bank of America on the right.  There's a long strip mall of stuff, but if you turn in the right driveway it's literally in front of you.  :)\n\nWent in and it's such an adorable little shop.  Everything is neatly organized, though it's a little too yellowy for me (I know, it's called Sunville - it doesn't mean I have to like the 1960's-esque yellow d\u00e9cor).\n\nI found the pork buns and was excited to see how cheap they were but also a little sad to see they were not in the warmer.  The ones I am used to are found in the glass warmer on the counter so when you bite into them there's just a lot of warm bun and pork feelings.\n\nAfter also picking up a coconut tart, I checked out with cash in a prompt, friendly manner and left to go home.  I didn't realize how hungry I was until I was already halfway through one pork bun while driving.  While the bun itself is golden, fluffy and a great texture, it means little to nothing if the pork inside is lacking - and also lacking flavor.\n\nWhen I got home, I heated up the other one to give it another shot.  Same story, just warm this time.  Hardly any meat and what was there was bland.  I also got a piece of fat as large as the pieces of pork.  Icky.\n\nCoconut tart was the last one and I was excited to have something tasty.  It looks so good!  But...was also lacking flavor.  It was pretty dry and essentially was a step-up from basic cornbread.  The coconut was just on the top.  I was expecting the coconut flavor to be throughout... Maybe this is how tarts are supposed to be?  If so, that's lame.\n\nI may or may not go again to try out their other goodies, but these two bland experiences kind of put me off from doing so for at least awhile.", "business_id": "WWqkREJ9FuAPU6ZPTevTsw", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-07-12", "type": "review"}

Since moving to Vegas ten years ago we have tried several places around town, some good, some could be better, but in that ten year span we have never had a worse experience then at Dino's on S. Las Vegas Blvd last night.\nWent there on a Thursday night July 9th, sparse crowd, bartender was a woman who let's just say was not the friendliest we ever come across. Tried to ask about the place, got short terse responses.  Wife and I sat down in a table in the back, and after the first drink, went up to order a second round (no waitresses at that time and the bartender sure as heck wasn't going to come over), and that's when the trouble started.  Not even sure how it started of even why, wife and I are in our sixties, not exactly bar fighting types, but after we sat back down two men who were sitting at the bar came back two our table and tried to pick a fight.  Still to this moment we can figure out why this happen all we can guess is that we are not regulars. \nWe decided this was not the place for us, when we left the two men cussed at us, bartender just watched.\nAfter ten years in the Valley, this is by far the worst place we've ever tried to have a peaceful drink.  Shame on The Seven for recommending this super dive.  This should not be in the hall of fame but if there was a top hall of shame, it would get our vote.\nDo yourself a big favor, stay away from this dump bar.

Our reasons for going back so often?\n\n1.  PRICE:  Since we splurged for dinner every night, the cheap prices here were great.  As others mentioned, the 24-hour breakfast special was awesome: $5.99 for ham steak, 2 eggs, hashbrowns, and toast.  The lunch special available from 11am-6pm was a 1/2 sandwich with soup or salad for $6.99.  They also had $3 mimosas!! \n\n2.  FOOD:  Overall, the food was pretty good.  Not spectacular, but good for what you pay.  The hashbrowns were crispy on the outside and delicious...I also loved their sourdough toast.  My over-medium eggs came out overcooked on two separate days, however, they were quick and gracious to bring new perfectly cooked ones.\n\n3.  SERVICE:  We had great service pretty much every time.  Waters on the table almost immediately, and the food came out promptly.  The manager was there every time we went and was very friendly.  He helped his servers with refilling drinks, busing tables, running food... basically whatever needed to be done.  The lady who ran the register at the front was very gracious about ringing up our separate checks every time...with a smile on her face!\n\n4.  LOCATION:  I'm not going to lie... a huge factor for us eating here was that it was in the Stratosphere, where we were staying.  We did venture to IHOP one morning, only to realize it was more expensive, crowded, and not as good... a mistake we only made once.\n\nI definitely recommend this place for anyone staying in the Stratosphere Hotel, mainly because of the convenience factor and the prices.

My friend didn't see that on his bill so he added a tip on top of the tip that was put on to the bill by the waitress. I noticed on my bill so I questioned my bill and asked why the gratuity was added. She said we had a party of 6 or more and that she had to charge that. I told her I didn't see any sign and it wasn't posted anywhere and that it was wrong to charge us when we were going to add a tip to the bill anyways. Tips are not mandatory and are given voluntarily for good service. She was extremely rude and walked away. My friend received a refund for the double tip and as we complained we asked for a manager.

I called ahead and got the Limo Special. $50/girl, which included transportation to the OG (but not back!), cover charge, and about $20 worth of drinks. Since we had so many girls, they sent us a party bus. SAAWWEEET! Just the ride alone was tons of fun!  We got there about 8:30, which is pretty early for a Vegas night, but that meant we got front row seats! Right at the dance floor.\n\nThe entertainment was fun, full of energy, and very nice to all the girls. The staff was nice, but a little understaffed. One guy to take care of all 23 of us and other groups??? Sorry, but we want our alcohol and we want it now! He was however, very kind to watch how much drink credit we had left and was prompt to notify me once we got down to $20 per my request. \n\nThe place itself was nice, not dirty, and not creepy either.

To start off because we drove ourselves our entry was free if we purchased 2 drinks for $25, not to bad (I just wish that we didn't have to get both drinks at the same time).  \n\nWe started out at the female show which is downstairs, enjoyed ourselves.  The girls were all nice to look at and not to pushy, we met a girl that we both liked and she sat and talked to us for a while even after we bought a couple of dances, $20 per song.  She was alot of fun she had roaming hands and encouraged my husband and I to do the same.   She also told us if we come before 4 pm there is no entry fee and the drinks are much cheaper.\n\nNext, we went upstairs to see the men dancers and this was our first time at a male strip club, totally different atmosphere than with the female club.  The women tend to get more riled up then men.   There were very hot guys dancing and they were enjoying themselves, loved the fireman.  As for couples being there I only saw one or two other couples, but tons of women enjoying the show.  The men pulled women from the audience up on the stage and gave them dances up there, it was a lot of fun to watch.  They definitely worked for their tips and made sure it was worth it for the tipper as well.  My husband and I both enjoyed ourselves.\n\nWhen we decided to leave because of the mens club closing we went back down stairs and it was much more crowded and fewer girls going around and dancing so we left quickly.  \n\nWe liked it so much we took our favorite dancers advice and went back during the day around 4pm.   As she said there was no entry fee and the drinks were a lot cheaper.  When we first got there we weren't sure what to think, nobody was dancing and they were mostly just sitting around.  Once 5pm hit they started dancing on the stage and approaching us, we were the only ones tipping so it was like the girls were dancing just for us (it was nice).  We bought a dance from one girl and told her to come back later, but she never returned.  Another girl approached us after my husband tipped her quite a bit while she was on stage.  Immediately when her songs were over she came to our table thanking us for the tips and asked if we wanted a dance.  My husband paid for a dance even though she wasn't our type and lets just say there was a lot of contact that was unexpected, but very nice;)  She talked to us for a while after the dance and she let us know that most dancers are intimidated by couples, because they don't know if the girl really wants to be there or was dragged along.  So to the couples out there, if you want any attention from the dancers have a good time and let them know you are enjoying yourselves.  \n\nWe will definitely be back on our next visit.  Thank you OG for a lot of fun.", "business_id": "YZxA6w82eFJFntwqJLln6w", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-07-20", "type": "review"}

Seriously they have hundreds of gems, fossils, rocks etc etc. I wish they were closer to get to.\n\nSo my friend Dawn R. who flew in from Portland for the Yelp Spring Break had been looking for 6 gems for a Feng Shui thing in the living room.  Everything on the internet was just a online store and not a business that you could walk into.  When it comes to gems and minerals you want to hold and see.  Think about a diamond for example.  Wouldn't you rather see it and touch in person before buying!   Well the Yelp Ap came to the rescue again.  \n\nThis place is on the outskirts of downtown and easy to get to.  I wasn't sure want to expect since there was less than 10 reviews but WHOA when we walked in it was like DAYUM.  They have A LOT of stuff.  They have the place organized by the minerals, gems and fossils in the front.  When you go to the back you can find even more minerals, gems in all type of sizes and shapes and even a sections of beads.  Another smaller room where they have Buddhist statues.  I was totally impressed with the amount of items this place carries.\n\nI personally was not looking for anything in particular.  I was looking at some pendulum and I tried out a few.  There was one answering me even when I was not holding it so I getting it.   I also purchased a Moldavite http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moldavite.  Something I had never heard of until that day.  I was curious to know more about it and Miguel was the one who took the time to explain what it was and how people use it.  Being that I had by Reiki 1 & 2 done and he was a Reiki Master and had also done theta healing I knew exactly what he was talking about in terms of energy work.  I could totally feel the warmth from this one gem from holding it in my hand.  I felt like what one may feel when having a hot flash.  It was pretty odd how this little gem was giving off that much energy.  There are only 3-4 mines and it is estimated that it will all be gone in the less than 10 years so I thought I should get one.   So I picked a pendant http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jMrpr92nMEhe4cC4FF00VQ?userid=3H2VbXZ8upvCFncbi5xTcg#hddvoHue4g2iC-Tv6KuvRA and a chain I like and put it on.  The pendant sat right between my heart and throat chakra and I could immediately feel the warmth in my chest area.   \n\nNow this is when things got interesting.  As we were checking out, Miguel had left to the back room to grab a bag for my pendulum.  When he returned he told me to put out both hand and close my eye.  Hmmm that is a strange request but I obliged.  He then put a good size spirit quartz in both hands and told me to hold on an feel.  I seriously never ever ever felt so much energy and vibration coming from gem before.  It was so intense my hands were shaking.  It shot up through my arms and straight to my chest and was pounding right were the Moldavite pendulum lay.  I was totally speechless and all that came out of my mouth was Oh Shit, Oh my goodness, Oh Damn Oh my god etc etc.   A minute or so into it Miguel proceeds to share with me a message from my spirit guide to not be so hard on myself and to take things slowly and to take my time.  With the massive energy and vibration going through me and what I was hearing I teared up big time.  This was so unexpected and a great surprise.  It was one of the most amazing experience I had in a store!!!  Now this is not to be expected with every person that comes in but I was totally opened to it and was ready for it and so I welcomed it.  Freaking amazing.   I was feeling that energy pretty much all day, it was freaking great!!!! \n\nAnywho, if your' looking to buy a few pieces for feng shuei or maybe even by a Moldavite and you happen to be visiting sin city you have got to stop by this place.  It's a gem of a place!\n\nLocale ~ Downtown \nOfferings ~ Gems, Minerals, Jewelry, Statues\nExtras ~ Ask for Miguel,  He is very knowledgeable and helpful!", "business_id": "DJ9GmGDuvdZSGxFkaNhrAQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-06-08", "type": "review"}

All of her guest were coming from California. She had all the paperwork set for her chosen date and PAID a deposit. I called in to make a final desicion on the flowers and to let them know how big the party was, then the wedding planner told me ok we will see you guys on this new date.... I said \"no the wedding is not then whats going on?\" she said oh well it looks like it was overbooked so we had to move you to a different date. The original wedding planner didnt even want to get on the phone to explain what the hell was going on. She had someone else handle the job for her. Our invitations were already sent out so they suggested that WE EMAIL our guest about the new wedding date! REALLY??? (that's just wrong) Then she said either we are going to either choose the new date (wich was on a FRIDAY, not Saturday like we planned) or just get our money back and find a new place to get married at. After I complained and let them know that I would call each and every news station and write a complaint on each and every review website if they didnt work with me.

We paid $400 for our photography package alone. An in order to get the copyright to all the photos it would be an additional $800. So if we did that the photos would of cost the same amount as the whole wedding! That's crazy. And our lifestyle photographer who was \"free of charge\" took the most amazing photos and if we didn't pay the $800 for all the pictures it cost $10 for each 4x6 print. Those pictures were not included in the $400 I paid for the photo session. Ughhh. \n\nThe tipping seemed to be a little ridiculous too. I paid  $75 for a second limo and they wanted us to tip each limo driver $40...that's crazy considering our hotel was only 3 mins away and that's more then half the price for the limo itself.

I offered to make payments 3 months from that point when I would have been in a better financial situation to do so and they would not take it,  for a bill that was already supposedly over 2 years old, if the bill is even legit.  I made my arrangement, and started with the payment schedule.  A few months later, I was $40 short on a bill (I'm an independant contractor, my pay varies every week so keeping on this schedule was not a reality but I did try) and to be honest, I hoped to be able to pay it later in the week.  I honestly forgot about it which I take full blame for, and when I went to pay the following month (which I would have been able to make up the difference), they took that payment, THEN told me to wait so someone else could talk to me.  Apparently, the $40 short payment (my monthly payments were $200) was enough to have their lawyer draft a letter, which added $500+ to my balance, and were in the process of putting a lein on my house and garnishing my wages of 25% a week until the debt was settled.  I had my back against the wall once again with these people and they had set up another payment schedule which would have been $300 a month (I was having trouble with $200 and they set me up for $300- makes me wonder what their agenda is).

I mean, come on, they're supposed to be saving lives here and helping loved ones cope.  This one was good, but we did run into a few problems along the way, so I just gotta take off a star if I'm going to be objective at all.\n\nThe good: they saved my mom.  She had a stroke and within 5 minutes of bringing her into the ER, she was diagnosed and started treatment.  Some of the staff was very nice (as if they were treating their own mother), understanding (they let one of us stay the night even though the rules say visiting hours are only between 11am and 8pm plus they let us all visit at the same time even though the rules say only 2 at a time), and knowledgeable (when the initial doctor recommended some very aggressive treatment, one of the other staff schooled us on its actual usefulness and potential and very dangerous side effects).\n\nThe bad: some of the staff was not very nice and downright rude.  My mom needed her sleep, and one of the nurses would come in almost every hour to do something, like give her some meds, take her blood pressure, or take her blood.  Why couldn't they schedule that all to happen at the same time so my mom could sleep all through the night?  Not only did this nurse come in all the time, but the way she woke up my mom was by turning on the big bright lights over the bed and practically yelling her name.  And the first kid that came to take her blood almost burst a vessel because my mom has bruises up and down her poor little arm.  Not cool, man.  Not cool at all.  That kid was so scared by all the blood, she ran out crying to find another nurse to take the blood for her.  Jebus.\n\nThe ugly: they could have put my mom in a coma.  I get it, they have a very small window of time to apply certain medication or treatment or whatever, but these doctors have to understand that this isn't a TV show and you can't just throw that kind of pressure on family members who have no idea the damage that something like that could do.  Give us ALL the side effects and potential outcomes.  Another minor point: sometimes the alarms go off and no one comes to check on them.  I'm guessing it's because a lot of them are just little alarms, but they should just get rid of those if they are.  People are trying to sleep and I get that the staff is busy running around and then they don't have a chance to turn them off, but these alarms are going off for several minutes at a time.\n\nGiven all of that, they still saved my mom and for the most part, treated her (and us) like family, so I still gotta give them a good review.  It ain't perfect and like I said above, all hospitals should have perfect 5 star reviews, but hey, i guess they still did their job.", "business_id": "LwUxmAZ_l3yvRPnrQi6n3w", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-06-02", "type": "review"}

She told me that the fudge does not melt until the temperature reaches 110 degrees. I was not sure I believed her but decided that before the temperature rose that day, I would have consumed all the fudge anyway. It is pricey. Each slice is 1/2 pound and it is 7.99 for 1/2 a pound. I purchased one. Then my daughter conveniently wandered in and so I bought another. Then the lady told me that I got one free. Like I needed it but I wanted it. So we walked out with three. One disappeared before we arrived at our hotel. The others traveled with us and as the weather became sunnier and warmer, I was concerned about my candies. I felt the package and they were as firm (shush...) as they were when I bought them. The lady had also told us that this was the only fudge that did not hurt her stomach.

An institution in which sick or injured persons are given medical or surgical treatment or 2. A similar establishment for the care of animals.

But if you have something that can wait, take your concerns elsewhere because they will not take care of you. When a woman with a serious knee injury was told that her cab home after waiting 45 minutes wasn't coming anymore, the employee just shrugged as if to say, \"sucks to be you.\" Not to mention when the cab did come, my friend and I were the ones to push her wheelchair and help her in the car.\n\nI get waiting several hours in a busy hospital waiting room, but we were practically the only ones there.

We tried NCC and it did not meet our needs. The gym appears to focus on strength climbing as opposed to a good balance of strength and technique. Every route we climbed was oriented vertical and felt more like climbing a ladder than a route.   \n\nMy biggest concern with the gym was that after charging the day rate and signing the log there was no orientation or safety check before they let us on the wall. There should always be a safety check even if you show up with gear and look like a climber.  \n\nOn the positive side; the gym does seem oriented well for kids /  beginners  / UNLV students who would take a class before starting without much climbing background.

My friend told me to meet her there one day after a softball game. My softball buddy and I went there and she met up with us later. We were hungry so we ordered some food. He went with the BLTAPNB which is a standard BLT with Peanut Butter. Seemed odd, but worth a shot. I went with the more than a turkey melt sandwich which has turkey, bacon, cheddar cheese, garlic butter, and Cajun mayo. We split both sandwiches and they were OUTSTANDING!  The prices were affordable too! Onion rings were good, a little on the undercooked side where the whole ring comes out of the breading, but whatever. French fries were cooked perfectly.  Beer is reasonable, both draft and bottle.  The only thing is, if you don't like a smoky place, this may not be the place for you. HOWEVER, they do have a small seating area/restaurant area that is completely closed off from the bar with glass partitions so that may work for you if you want something to eat.  Bar staff is friendly, and this is definitely a neighborhood joint where if you visit enough, they'll get to know your name and drink of choice.

Normally I prefer thin crust New York style but I thought it was yummy. We ordered the works, a pepperoni and mushroom one and the chicken jalape\u00f1o one. Thin crust is still my favorite though!  The chicken wings were bomb!  They were more like fried chicken wings because it wasn't saucy at all. It was deep friend, crunchy and juicy.  Not the traditional wings you'll see at Wong stop but I really enjoyed them!  Much more than the pizza for sure. \n\nI probably won't come here again because it was out of the way for me.

The doctor seemed competent and friendly, the head medical assistant was helpful and efficient. BUT... It is now a little over a year since my first surgery by Dr Nevins. Any glimpses of professionalism, empathy, or honesty, that this medical office once possessed, has now vanished from existence. Any traces of \"quality customer service\" literally goes down hill on a hourly basis. His back office staff is quite possibly the rudest, most inappropriate, uneducated, and unprofessional, medical assistants I have ever met. His surgery scheduler/medical assistant should be fired. She doesn't know anything about medicine, (especially orthopedics), and hears only what she chooses to hear. A few weeks ago I attempted to leave a phone message for the doctor. I had a medical problem that was related to one of my past surgeries with him. While trying to explain my problem to the girl on the phone, she actually told me to stop talking!! After politely listening to her, I asked her if I could speak, and she told me no~ that she already listened to me, and didn't want to hear it again. When I told her that I thought she was being rude, she proceeded to get very nasty and argumentative with me. I politely asked to speak to with her supervisor, and was told that she wasn't there. When I asked a second time, she stated that she would give my message to every manager in their office if that would shut me up. She then had the audacity to hang up on me!! This medical assistant has told me that she has 20 years experience... (in what I'm not sure)... but it is obviously not in manners or in medicine. I had a serious medical problem that she probably never relayed to the doctor. Until there is an MD behind her name, she needs to refrain from trying to diagnose patients!! Someday, she will again give incorrect medical advice to another patient. Because of that, they will end up either seriously ill or deceased. Fingers crossed that she will be fired before that happens...  (Thankfully they seem to have a high employee turnover rate... I'll leave it at that, lol.)\n\nLastly, my surgeon... Dr Nevins replaced both of my hips last year in two different surgeries. I didn't like the fact that while in the hospital he did not \"check-up\" or talk to me after either of my surgeries. (Another Dr from his practice saw me once.) Compared to my primary care doctor, Dr Sang Tran (whom I adore)... I have been left with the disappointing conclusion that I am only an insurance payment to him...\n\nLong wait to get an appointment. Longer wait to have surgery. Even longer wait to talk to anyone with an IQ above 50. (And that includes the doctor.)", "business_id": "DoQYCpYw5MdkbjGNSFmuog", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-06-28", "type": "review"}

However, I needed a haircut so badly, funds were limited, and i had not found a new stylist since moving back to vegas. So I swallowed my shame, called The Salon and asked a few questions. The receptionist was very sweet and professional, and just my luck, there was an opening that day (which was a Monday).\n\nI arrived 20 mins early, as I wanted a chance to look through a book or magazine. My stylist was hanging around the front desk already, so she took me early.\n\nI showed her a very simple style that I liked, straight with piece-y layers at the bottom, a bit longer than shoulder length. She studied the picture closely several times, chatting away as she began what would turn into a 1.5 hour haircut. She had no idea how to layer my hair, she kept doing these short, choppy little snips at the bottom, cutting my hair into a straight line all the way across. she didn't even touch the rest of my hair, leaving me with this awful cut that in no way resembled the photo or any other style I've ever seen or had. I can't style this. I can't do anything with it. I had to correct her several times because she'd cut one side and forget to do the same thing on the other, then when I pointed out that it was completely uneven, she laughed it off and said that it was the lighting.With plenty of product she managed to give my hair enough body to appear different than it was when I walked in... by the time I got home, the product had worn off and I was in tears as I realized how terrible I looked. I've never had my hair look this awful.\n\nI made an even worse mistake by letting her do my eyebrow/lip wax. she bragged on and on about how much she loved waxing, and since I was headed to Nail Country after, I decided to save the trip, since the haircut had taken so long. It was IMMEDIATELY obvious that she had never waxed anything in her life. She had no idea how to pull my skin tight, and actually needed ME to do it for her. She definitely didn't shape or even finish the brows and did the middle off-center, taking too much off one side. She also insisted on showing me the wax strips after pulling them, I have no idea why. She couldn't even wax my lip right! She told me to hold my lip tight against my upper teeth, which you NEVER do, then used about 5 strips to sloppily wax the center. She left wax all over my face. When I looked in the mirror I couldn't believe it, and immediately pointed out how crooked my eyebrows were. Again, she blamed the lighting! She had taken at least 20-30 minutes on the waxing, I wasn't about to let her continue. I paid, tipped 15% on what the full service (before groupon) should have costed, and FLEW to Nail Country. They cleaned the old wax off, finished my brows, redid my lip, and couldn't believe I'd just paid $10 MORE than I'd ever paid anywhere for such terrible waxing.\n\nI did call and speak with the manager a few days later, who wasted no time telling me that they have a huge sign in the lobby explaining their No Money Back policy. They must have plenty of complaints if they had to have a sign printed! I told her I didn't want my money back, I just wanted my hair fixed and that stylist educated before she be allowed to go near another client again. Turns out that my two days off (Sunday and Monday) made having my hair fixed and finished impossible... they are closed Sunday and the manager is off Monday. So I was out about $100 after the awful haircut, incompetent wax, tip, then a 2nd wax done elsewhere and HER tip. \n\nI had to save up for that session, and it was a terrible experience. I still had all the same dead ends, limp hair, and zero style... it was just shorter.

That's because I did a review for Mulligan's Border just a couple of weeks ago and touted it as my \"Cheers\" bar because we go there so often and everyone knows our names. Well this isn't our \"Cheers\" Mulligan's but it is owned by the same people, but with a twist. The bar is run by the people that run our Mulligan's, however; the grill end is run by Wholesome Foods of Las Vegas. (http://www.wholesomefoodslasvegas.com) That throws a bit of a spin on the review because now the review may be for Mulligan's Landing but it's really for the room run by Wholesome Foods. Get it? Yeah I know, weird, but these kinds of cooperative business arrangements happen more often than you may think in Las Vegas.\n\nSo here is the skinny... Wholesome Foods is a boxed lunch caterer, therefore the food served at this restaurant is their boxed lunch on a plate. The good news... the food is awesome. My wife and I were only looking for a quick Iced Tea but when we browsed the menu for S&Gs and noticed Chicken Quesadillas and ordered up the appetizer. We were waited on by the chef (yes chef, from Le Cordon Bleu no less as displayed on his chefs coat) and got to talking and we decided to try the Shaved Roast Beef Sandwich with a creamy slaw. The food was as advertised and pretty darn good. Good use of spice in the quesadillas gave them some zip and the Pico was fresh. The Roast Beef was very tasty and tasted confit if a bit salty. The slaw on the other hand was great. It was cream with a bit of what has to be champagne vinegar to give it a nice zing.\n\nThe d\u00e9cor was \"Areo\" inspired because it is right across from the NLV Airport. You get the feeling that back in the day this had to be a favored hangout of pilots and crews in the aviation biz.\n\nIn the past this establishment has suffered from mismanagement apparently but you have the feeling that the staff is trying hard to correct that. Service what very good and the people in the place seemed happy.\n\nThis will not be a hangout spot for me but if I am in the area and looking for a bite, this place is added to the spots that I like.", "business_id": "joAECABk39jQRM59nQpxaQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-06-26", "type": "review"}

Some up here, some down there.  But for me Baba's falls right in the middle.  Not bad, but not up there with my favorites.\n\nFirst off, if I'm paying $7.99 per person it might as well be a Filipino buffet.  Here at Baba's for $7.99 you get a 3-item combo.  Eh, it's ok but limiting myself to just three choices, a questionable amount of rice, and a bowl of sabaw (soup) just doesn't work for me!  I want more!  Gimme more!  That's what makes Baba's so lackluster for me.\n\nThe plus is that Baba's is closer to where I live so in a pinch if I want Filipino food I don't have to drive all the way down to Chinatown.  But that's about the only plus.  If I wanted a certain type of Filipino food, myself or wifey can just make it ourselves.\n\nOn a weekend it wasn't very busy.  There were more folks either doing catering or take-out than actually eating in the restaurant.  Choices of the day on the food line were varied, but again, picking just three did me no good.  I wanted a bit of everything!\n\nI ordered a 3-item combo with BBQ pork stick, BBQ chicken stick (yes EACH one counts an item), and pork guisantes.  Combo came with an OK amount of rice, and a bowl of sinigang sabaw.  I, being the great piggy I am, was able to finish this combo off in less than 10 minutes.  Pow Pow Pow...like Pacquiao!  But not in his last fight vs. Mayweather.  I was left hungry, but like Hell am I gonna pay another $7.99 for more food!  Had to go home and eat a Magnum ice cream bar for dessert.\n\nBut the food quality wasn't bad.  The BBQ sticks were good, nice charred flavor bits and seasoned right, salty & sweet at the same time.  Pork guisantes was just OK in my book, pork was nice and fatty, but the sauce was a bit lacking in flavor.  Baba's rice cooking though was on point, perfect Jasmine rice for the meal.  That's why I wanted more!  The sabaw was decent, nothing particularly special.\n\nReviews said that the crispy pata is the gotta have at Baba's, so perhaps I'll give it a try on my next visit.  It's a bit pricey though, no?  Like $15?  Hope the serving is large for that much!\n\nBaba's, give us the buffet!

I do have mix emotions about this place, so I would say the decision is yours when you come visit.  But here are my thoughts on Sante Fe\n\nArriving at Sante Fe, the outside looks big and grand, that it was nicely built and detailed.  They have two garages on either side, especially for those who are either staying for a few nights, or those visiting for a few hours.  Usually we come here to watch movies and maybe gamble, which is always nice.  I like Cinemark, and I do like the wide variety of slot machines.  But the stay, was a bit unsatisfactory in a way.  \n\nI got a room for free, which we end up getting on the top floor.  Which had a decent view of the highway and mountains.  As well as the small swimming pool in the back, which is next to the storage place in the back, where deliveries are made and forklift is running around back and forth.  But back to the room, its a nice small decent room, and of course I didn't really expect much.  But what I really didn't expect was the bed to be crooked.  The bed we had was lower in the head rest and higher in the feet side of the bed.  So mainly we didn't really enjoyed the bed.  Especially if our bed was making blood flow to our head faster than it should.  Plus the bed was a bit stiff, like it still used springs.  But I'm sure every room is different.  \n\nWe ate at the buffet, which of course, to me, buffet is a buffet.  There are ups and downs about buffets.  What I like is the wide selections, what I didn't like, is that some of the food has been sitting out there to the point of food being to dry and crisped, where its just kind of hard to chew.  The staff was okay, but going to a buffet, usually you want to make sure you have your drinks full.  Unfortunately after 3 rounds of going to the buffet line, my glass wasn't refilled, or never asked if I wanted another.  Either we had a waitress having a bad day, or that we were forgotten.  Cause going their before dinner rush, I'm sure it shouldn't be a problem to check on every table.  But again, everyone may have different waitress, so I wouldn't really rule out Feast Buffet.  Overall, we're their to eat, just hope some one is there to make sure you have something to drink.  \n\nGambling, some of the dealers are nice, but it usually takes you to break the ice first.  But overall, after getting to know you, they'll talk to you and be friendly.  The slots on the other hand, I know better than to play slots, but I was feeling lucky and actually walked away with 100 bucks from the slot machine.  \n\nOverall, it has its ups and downs, if your going to stay here, don't get to attach to it.  Just a place to lay your head and go.  The scenario around the casino is nice, the movie theater is probably a good place to watch a movie, despite its confusing concession stand, but overall, its an OK kind of place.  I wouldn't really rule this out, since everyone has its own experience.  Its just that this experience wasn't as pleasant as I thought it would be.", "business_id": "cuXfotyK8zhjO3vifd9x_Q", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-06-29", "type": "review"}

The first room; the towel holder broke off of the wall, the shower head was separated from the tile, the lamp was broken and the carpets were all stained.  The second room also had dirty carpets and there was actually dry blood running down the side of the bathtub.  Absolutely disgusting.  Don't these people clean the rooms?

As soon as I walked in I was greeted by Debbie with a smile. She was courteous and so kind, and made me feel important. I had previously been calling the store and speaking with Jamie (who was very professional and attentive) about ordering in a sample dress which I was dying to try on. She helped coordinate the dress delivery to the store and set up an appointment for me. However, she was out on vacation when my appointment rolled around, but Debbie stepped in and was wonderful. The store was very busy, which to me is an excellent sign. they had multiple fitting rooms, each a little tight for ball gowns, but if you have a sales person there to help you it isnt too bad. They also have multiple mirrored viewing areas with nice chairs set up so your party can see and give advice. We used the natural light viewing area since my wedding will be outdoors, that was an awesome touch. Debbie helped me try on multiple dresses and never tried to rush me or make me feel judged or pressured to purchase on a timeline, which i greatly appreciated. I ended up falling in love and having a teary moment in the dress I had Jamie order in, however it didnt fit properly and that was causing me hesitation. Debbie went and got one of the seamstresses (who was fantastic! I wish I knew her name) she came out and pinned my dress a little differently to show how she could alter the top to make it less revealing. Once she pinned it, the dress was perfect, absolutely perfect. \nI had visited another bridal salon in vegas that morning and had been made to feel unimportant and was treated with condescension, nothing like the genuinely knowledgeable and kind customer service I received at Celebrations Bridal. I ordered my dress that day and Debbie even helped me see what the dress would look like in a different color by grabing a different slip and holding it underneath the sheer portion of my dress. She was an angel through the whole process (which was less than an hour, I'm very decisive). I would recommend Celebrations Bridal to everyone, they are slightly cheaper in pricing compared to Couture Bride and Bowties and offer unbeatable alteration prices and customer service that cannot be beat. My only advice would be to call ahead if there is a specific dress you want to try on to make sure they have it in stock, if not they can order it in for you but you should give them a few weeks, just in case! Also, appointments are always a great idea. :) Cant wait to get married next March and post pictures of the beautiful dress Celebrations Bridal helped me find!", "business_id": "6YpCU0pdxj7O1GQzxn6YJw", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-07-07", "type": "review"}

Sushi on Rainbow did not disappoint. My friends indulged in my cravings and agreed to eat sushi. Not familiar with any sushi places in Vegas and one of the rare moments my friends have EVER asked me to jump on Yelp & find a place, I was stoked! Usually when I whip out my phone and start yelping it's amongst groans and moans from them. \"Emy put the phone down!\" \"Seriously dude, do you have to yelp everything???\" Sometimes I would Yelp while walking and a few times almost face planted into something. Though my friends were annoyed with my constant Yelping, they were nice enough to guide me while I was walking and typing. So yea, I was pretty happy they were turning to YELP for suggestions. \n\nThis was my moment to either shine or worse - tank. Sushi on Rainbow was close to where we were at and the Yelp reviews were pretty good so I threw caution to the wind and announced, \"I found the perfect place!\". Fingers crossed and a silent prayer to the Yelp gods, we walk into SOR and was immediately greeted with \"irrashaimase\" in the right pronunciation...yeeesss, there is a Yelp god! \n\nIt was AYCE sushi and other Japanese dishes such as tempura, fried oysters, curry rice, katsu etc. As some Yelpers have pointed out there is an hour time limit but this is common in Japan of any AYCE restaurant so this was not a big deal to me. I forgot how much it was per person but I did upload a couple of pics here that have the pricing on it. We all def ate and drank more than our money's worth in the allotted time.\n\nThe sushi we ordered came out relatively quickly and so did the non-sushi items. I was amazed at all the things they offer for AYCE! It was delish! The night we were there, beer, sake and soft drinks were also included in the AYCE eat. After establishing who the DD was (gotta be responsible ppl) we all ordered sake.  \n\nThe sushi chef's were very friendly and personable so were the waitresses. The sushi chefs would call out from time to time to ask us how we were doing. Like I said, very friendly. One of the waitresses was from my hometown in Japan and lived about 10 mins from me. It was fun talking to her in Japanese especially since my friends hardly ever hear me speak it. So yea, I got to bust out my Japanese...lol. \n\nOk getting side tracked. I can't remember everything we ordered but the sushi was very fresh. I always start with hamachi (don't know what it's called in English) and it was very good. Salmon and maguro followed. Plus spicy tuna and a few speciality rolls. Also ordered the shrimp tempura, fried oysters and tonkatsu (pork cutlet). Yes, I'm a little oinker! \n\nOne hour was plenty of time for us to fill our bellies on endless sushi and sake. Like I mentioned we hardly had to wait and the restaurant was a bit busy. The sushi counter was full when we got there and there were 3 tables that were occupied. The 2 sushi chefs both from Japan, were making the sushi and the cooks in the back were making the other dishes, \n\nThis will be MUST GO TO restaurant every time I go to Vegas. Oh and btw, one of the sushi chefs was wearing a UH cap and told me they get lots of customers from Hawaii. \n\nAs for converting my friends to Yelp that's another issue lol. I did score some big points on this once. (Fist pump!) Oh wait, I did convert one person, who just set up an account!\n\nIf you're looking for authentic Japanese sushi & food this place is the place to go. I've been to other Japanese restaurants in Vegas that were highly recommended by locals only to be disappointed that it wasn't authentic. I mean come on, shrimp tempura is not panko crusted shrimp...that's called shrimp fry. \n\nSo glad I found this place thanks to Yelp. 1 point Emy / 0 points friends who I will eventually convert to becoming Yelpers.

It was hypnotic, and there is a strong possibility that the sign may have even winked at me (or maybe that I just needed to get some more sleep).  So I got a couple of people to walk with me across the street on an adventure to the Hooters Casino. \n\nFrom the outside, it looks like an oversize Hooters.  On the inside, the casino is tiny and smaller than anything I have seen on the strip.  We were able to walk through the entire casino in less than a couple of minutes.  There wasn't very many people in the casino, and there seemed to be more employees than patrons on a Saturday night.  All of the dealers were Hooters girls, deck out in their white and orange gear.  The theme of Hooters was evident and well maintained throughout.\n\nWhen we got to the back of the Casino, I went into the store to check out what they had.  They had some cute Hooters branded cloths, and I found a jersey top that I liked to buy for my wife.  After that, we took a look out the back door of the casino to see the pool.  It was pretty sad.  There were just a bunch of dudes hanging out, and not a Hooter in sight.  The pool looked like a giant sized Motel 6 pool, and did not look like a fun place to hang out at all.  So we headed back inside towards the front of the Casino.  We passed two restaurants on the way.  One of them being a Hooters, of course.  When we got to the front there was another store that I did not notice when we first walked in.  This store had lots more cloths and Hooters paraphernalia, so I went in to check it out and ended up buying more stuff.  They had a special in the store that if you buy $35 of merchandise you get a free gift.  The clerk at the registered informed me that for a $1.50 I could buy a sacky bag.  I thought I was a $1.50 off of hitting the $35 mark and so I agreed to get the bag.  It turned out that the bag was another promotion, and that my free gift was actually a Hooters girl calendar...from 2010  :I\n\nAfter buying all of the cute Hooters gear for my wife to wear, we went on our way.  Now that she has all of these cloths I don't have to bother going to Hooters anymore to check out the girls in the itsy-bitsy outfits.  I look forward to Val making me a Teriyaki Chicken Sandwich in one of her new Hooters outfits, and I'm pretty sure I won't go to this casino again.  There really wasn't anything special to see or do here.", "business_id": "KJnVuzpveyDrHARVNZaYVg", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-08-22", "type": "review"}

Even with all that, you have to admit that this hotel is getting pretty dated.\n\nOur group got a pool level bungalow.  An otherwise nice view of the pool which is partially obscured by the bars that are part of the security gate.  The inside of the rooms are pretty antiquated and in some cases run down. Our room had a CRT(old, Non-flatscreen for those technologically impaired) Television, rust/corrosion stains and chips in the sink and bathtubs, some of the hardware (faucets) loose and a couple crickets and roaches inside.  Luckily the air conditioning worked because it was a good 110+ degrees our entire stay. Also on the patio and even in some areas of the pool (waterfall area) there is a weird sewage stench noticeable in the air.  Not sure what that's all about. \n\nI didn't eat at the restaurant but a few of my friends did and while they enjoyed the wings, some of them didn't enjoy the other food options offered.  The little gift/snack shop also offers donuts, coffee and sandwiches.  The sandwiches for $6 could be a lot better though, very plain and basic and honestly not a great value. I found myself walking over to the local gas station to buy one of their sandwiches just to save myself about $3 for about the same quality (maybe slightly smaller). A bottle of water was also still $3 so the gas station was also the alternative for that.\n\nI didn't spend much time in the casino but it definitely felt \"old\".  They did have a sports style bar which was usually pretty empty but did have plenty of televisions.\n\nThe pool was actually the best part of this hotel and was probably the only thing other than the AC, that made this place acceptable. There are two main pools, one with a waterfall which runs a little cooler, another which runs a little warmer(and is more popular as a result) and some small Jacuzzi style pools. It's open 24 hours which is perfect for hot summer nights.  They have a DJ playing music, security and hostesses walking around and a bar right by. Plus if you have a bungalow you can go through the security gate (with key card unless it is left open) and get directly to the pool. They also held a beauty/swimsuit contest with the hooters girls by the restaurant area next to the pool which was great. All of this would have brought the review up to 3 stars except for on the last night (Saturday) after coming back from a long walk up and down the strip, we came back to find that the warmer pool had been closes and taped off.  Not sure why but I fear that some drunken frat kids maybe contaminated the pool \"somehow\" or perhaps it was something far more sinister.  Bummer.  The pool was considerably less busy as a result but nobody felt like going in the cooler pool that late.\n\nThe staff I encountered was actually pretty nice so that's one thing I can't really complain about. So kudos there.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that this is a cheaper hotel, so expect that.  If you don't spend a lot of time in a room in Vegas and you don't mind the location of this towards the end of the strip then I suppose it is for you.  It is nice that they have a pool which is [usually] open 24 hours.  The rooms are pretty run down, their televisions are antiquated and ours constantly lost signal and you might find a couple bugs here and there.  So if you are looking for \"nice\" rooms just pass.  Otherwise, on a budget, this place might suffice.

Failure to vacuum hallways of bungalow building\n9. No air in this building\n10. No more 24 hour pool\n11. Hooter's boneless wings for $10.99 were the size of chicken nuggets\n12. Hooter's male bartender had several dumb moments \n13. Imelda refunded me only two days of resort fee's\n14. $75 resort fee charge on my card even though I prepaid (this was after Imelda said she would refund me (I also stayed 4 nights not 3...)\n15. Shower temp changes as the others in the building flush toilets and monkey with their temp setting for the shower/sink.\n\nPROS\n\n1. Imelda refunded 2 days of resort fees. \n2. Older male security guard was nice as hell. \n\n\nAs you can see the cons out weigh the pros. Yes, there are more expensive hotels, but I expect decent plumbing, a comfy bed plus to be treated like a person and not just a dollar sign. \n\nFYI- their little store \"Splurge is closed\" and I didn't step into Mad Onion because it's just feels gross in their.", "business_id": "KJnVuzpveyDrHARVNZaYVg", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-06-28", "type": "review"}

This is the reason why we picked this hotel. But it is true when they say you get what you pay for. The amenities here were really old starting of with the elevator that is scary because it feels like its about to get off of its railings. Our bathroom counter was about to fall so we were careful using our sink. The AC is way too loud, louder than an industrial fan. The restaurants/bars on the hotel were okay. The restaurant serves what you see in a typical hooters restaurant but their wings dont come with any celery or carrots. The casino is very small. There are a very few table, some of it were not even open. Then theres about 2 roulette table open and 1 table for craps. The slot machines are not so many as well. It seems like there was hasnt been any new games for slot machines. Nothing is really entertaining at the casino. They dont even have a lounge! If you stay here and wants to have a good time gambling, i suggest just walk right across MGM Grand although getting to the sidewalk requires you to walk more than you are suppose to. The next time we go to Vegas, we'll pay the extra 40-80 dollars more charge for a different hotel by the strip.

BOO!\n--Questionable music - there is a pay-by-song juke box and unfortunately last time I was some guys decided to troll the place and play William Hung's 'greatest' hits. =(\n--Super packed parking lot on busy days with alot of people who loiter around amongst the cars =\\", "business_id": "5-rL_08xlI2i-xsswFyYqQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-06-15", "type": "review"}

We were a party of 5 and ordered the Parilla plate and Ribeye, the latter of which was so succulent and bursting with flavors.  It paired VERY well with a bottle of Luigi Bosca Malbec, which I highly recommend - soft and silky smooth tannins, very well structured.  The parilla meats were enough to fill all of us (sweet bread, skirt steak, filet, sausage).\n\nWe topped things off with the dulce de leche cookie, flan and crepe (with dulce de leche).  They were all delicious - maybe too much caramel in the crepe, but no big deal.\n\nOur waitress was very nice and they were prompt with food.  And again, the prices were very reasonable - about $150 for 5 of us, including a bottle of wine and three desserts and enough meat to fill all of us to the brim.  \n\nI definitely will come back here again.

I tend to like their commercials, and they have some decent discounts/specials: like right now it's summer shake season, with half off shakes after 8PM.\n\nWent in today and got a peanut butter chocolate flavor for myself, with a chocolate java chiller for my guy. He also took the liberty of adding on a garlic parm hotdog on their new cheese bread dogs, and an order of their little-known \"extreme tots\"- chili cheese tots with ranch and jalapenos.\n\nI'm not a huge fan of the food with this chain and this location didn't stand out from others. Tots are typically too salty for me, ordering them this way lessened the salt flavor. Hotdog, despite the special bun, did not have much flavor either, but the parm sauce on it was pretty interesting.\nShakes were thick and large- prices here seem higher than I'm used to though. PBC shake was better than the java chiller, but I'd like to see a coffee flavor on their shake menu in the future.\n\nI like how the drive-up stands have credit card slots to pay after you order. Wish they could add on a feature to tip this way. I'm always baffled about how much/whether to tip someone to bring me my order, but here the drive-thru section gives you the option to go their instead of to a stand if you know you don't want to tip or don't have cash in addition to your card.", "business_id": "S4nbHSW29N0rcXkIlA-wbQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-06-23", "type": "review"}

He says he doesn't know. Point blank. No asking for help. No making sure. No customer service what so ever. He could give a shit. I said a pretty big F bomb and walked out in such a fury. I couldn't believe this was happening.. AGAIN. No one at this school will help me!!!!! \n\nI sat outside in tears because I was so frustrated, angry, and confused... I called the number to the school while outside to speak to someone. I got a very nice lady by the name of Ariel on the phone. She helped.. Thank god, someone helped me. She told me she could look it up and she did. I didn't pass. Plain and simple, all I needed to know so I can take it again.. All this time, that's all the shit I needed to know.. Another weird part to this.. they only have my score from last year.. not this year when I took it in may? Where is my results going!? It's not in my paperwork.. and my old address was still on the top page.. I really was ready to take a marker and scratch it out. I hope she erases it.. please...\n\nI want to pass so I can never see this school again.. Only reason I have to take the test here is because I paid and they won't allow me to take it at any other unless I pay again.

We ate the traditional fried chicken and the \"cluck-e-tos\" (chicken taquitos/flautas/rolled tacos).  What with one thing and another, we drifted away.\n\nA couple of months ago, I was driving down that stretch of West Charleston near Jones, and saw the Farm Basket sign.  (I thought they had gone out of business.)  Still around, still that one small building, and, surprisingly, the same very good chicken.  Of course, in the interest of nostalgia, I had to order more cluck-e-tos ... still as good as I remember then.  The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the roll.  It's a huge thing, which in itself is not bad, but they drizzle it with some kind of sweet syrup, which is not what I want when I want bread with my chicken.  Otherwise ... yeah, I'll be back.\n-- -- -- -- --\nOn the Nighthawk 100-point scale: 82.", "business_id": "4sTUCAAzenGzgG2w7ry1zQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-07-27", "type": "review"}

We loved the chicken wings that we ordered with our dinner. They were really moist, tender and very good. A big hot with the family. We will definitely be back. One more thing- the employees were very kind and helpful.

We were in the area, and I found a coupon in my \"Entertainment\" book. Yes! \nIt was about 4pm and we were going for a very late lunch/early dinner. \n\nFacility: it's pretty small, only about 5 booths and 5 tables. It was cool you can see where they prepare the chicken and ribs through the window. It's got a fast food feel, but with better food. \n\nService: You order your food at the counter and the give you a number. They bring it to your table. The guy that helped us was friendly and answered all our questions. However, we stood at the counter a few minutes waiting for him to finish mopping. \n\nFood:  I got the combo with dark meat chicken, ribs, and 1 side for $11.99. The CHICKEN (3.5/5) was good. It had a nice mesquite flavor and the meat was moist. Felt like it was missing something though. I pulled it off, wrapped it in the tortilla, added salsa, pico and some SALAD (4/5) off my plate. I liked that. I loved the PICO (5/5) because it was tart and it had cucumber in it. The SALSA (3/5) was good and spicy. \nRIBS (4/5) were good. Again, loved the mesquite flavor. I added the BBQ SAUCE (2.5/5), and not a huge fan. It was just too sweet for me. They need a second sauce that is savory and spicy. I ordered the POTATO SALAD (3/5) that wasn't bad, but not a fan of the onions in it. I got an extra side of MACARONI AND CHEESE (3/5) which was also decent, but needs some salt. \n\nOverall: (3/5) I liked it, but didn't LOVE it. I would come back, but not waiting in a long line. I liked the meat, but the sides were just ok. To me, the best BBQ is good meat and good sides too!!!!  So, this was just ok.", "business_id": "ubwHoadNnVfMB9dFV2uyTQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-07-12", "type": "review"}

They moved to this new location in the past year or two (we haven't been by lately!) and I think it's in a better place.  It's basically across a big intersection, but the old location was a dead end strip mall where there used to be a Circuit City and then nothing, and the old Circuit City was never leased out.  It is more of a destination store, but now it's next to a Panda Express so if you need something to drink or eat, or a place to sit while you're waiting for your husband, it's easier.
