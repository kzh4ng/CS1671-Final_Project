I go here about 6 or 7 times a year.  The bar itself is beautiful.  The seating is great with a huge circular bar in the middle and a lot of leather seats towards the sidewalk by the open air doors and windows.  They also have seating outside which is good for people watching especially when there is some type of event in the city.  I've found the staff to be a little above average, but nothing special.  By far the best thing about this place is the space itself and its location in the city.  The drinks are pretty good, but overpriced.  Some martinis are about $10, which is fine for a stellar top shelf martini in Pittsburgh or an average martini in NYC.  This is not a stellar Pittsburgh martini.   I believe that any bar whether its in your basement or at the \"French Laundry\" should have guinness on tap (just my personal belief), and this place at least has guinness but serves it out of a can.  Another annoying thing is depending on who serves me I pay a different price.  Last night I paid $7 for a guinness (which is way too much) and then minutes later I ordered another one from a different bartender and paid $5.25.  The food is two stars at best and very inconsistent.  They bill themselves as a \"tapas\" place, but it is obvious to me they don't understand what \"tapas\" entail.  Go to ibiza on the s. side for your tapas.  Some of their selections are better than others.  I've had the quail before which was seasoned well and cooked perfectly.  Last night I tried the AHI tuna which was of good quality, but could have used some wasabi or a stronger flavored sauce to compliment the good quality tuna.  I also tried the lobster cakes.  The lobster was barely noticable and the cakes had way too much breading.  The best thing about the plate was the curry sauce on the side.  I'd have to say that the location and space of the restaurant is 4 stars, but the food is 2 stars at best.  Another weird thing is that I've been here before on more than one occassion when they simply said they were not serving food (and it was like 8 on a Friday).

I cannot comment on the bar and/or alcoholic beverages as I did not imbibe on my recent visit, but the menu didn't do much for me.\n\nWe arrived on a busy Saturday night, but were seated within 20 minutes. Not bad, but our table was questionable. They took a big, corner booth and split it in half so that 2 parties of four could be accommodated sitting directly across from each other. It was kind of weird obligatorily staring at the couple across from me, but I digress.\n\nSome of my fellow diners started off with the Vegetarian Chili. I sampled some and it was well-spiced and hearty, I didn't miss the meat. We also started off with the Spinach Dip. The dip itself was fine, though I've never really eaten anywhere that could screw up spinach dip.\n\nThe entrees then arrived. My companion decided to have their signature Mac and Cheese. The noodles were a perfect al dente, and the cheese itself had a sharp bite. It became difficult to eat after a few bites, however, for the dish was missing a textural contrast. It would've benefited from some breadcrumbs baked on top.\n\nI decided to sample their bacon cheeseburger, which the establishment is apparently pretty proud of. It was cooked to a true medium rare, which is a rare (no pun intended) find in this city. Also, the bacon was heavenly, an ideal combination of lean and fat. They take their bacon seriously here, and it was easily the most interesting part of the burger. The pros of the burger end there however. It was, besides the bacon, pretty boring. The accompaniments (lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, ketchup, mustard) were standard. The patty itself, while well-cooked and of a good quality, was unfortunately underseasoned. The burger could've benefited from something that gave it pizzaz, like a sauce, some spice, or even some more salt!\n\nI opted for onion rings as a side to my burger. They were large, battered, sweet, and a little crispy, though quite greasy.\n\nMaybe it was because it was a busy Saturday night that I was disappointed. I was expecting some high class bar food at this spot. The common theme of the meal was that although the dishes were competently executed, they all lacked something (such as textural contrast) that could've elevated them to true greatness.

She also didn't seem very familiar with the restaurant: what the name Ri Ra means, how to pronounce \"polluck\", etc. At the same time, she gave the impression that she was hurrying us out the door--she asked if we were ready for the check but failed to ask if we wanted dessert (we did). She wasn't the only poor server---after our meal, we went upstairs to check out the whiskey room, but it was practically deserted. We stood around for several minutes and there was no bartender or server to be seen. As if to emphasize the staff's lack of concern, we discovered that the satisfaction survey with our bill had already been filled out by a previous customer!

There very very few ingredients to choose from for the omelet so I ordered a sausage, mushroom, cheddar cheese one and my husband ordered an bacon, mushroom, omelette.  There were very few vegetables to order with it.  We couldn't tell which omelette was which because we couldn't see the bacon or sausage. I think I got the wrong one because even once in a while I tasted a bite of bacon. We laughed instead of cry when we left because we basically paid close to 100 dollars for omelettes and crepes with tiny deserts when the day before we had an excellent breakfast at another Resturant for about 27.00.

This also means that it can be absolutely packed, and when there are a few college basketball games on, it's even more so.\n\nThis is because the Tavern is not only a restaurant, it is a sports bar.  That makes it a little difficult to classify, but I'll do my best.\n\nFirst, you have a largish bar area.  This section alone is larger than many sports bars these days, and it looks even larger because it's open, rather than being cramped and confined.  While there did not seem to be any smokiness to the area, there could have been some.  It was definitely loud, as most any bar will be on this sort of night.\n\nNext, you have a dining section, which wouldn't be much different than any other family-style dining area, except for the fact that it was right next to the bar.  So if you take the family, you'll want to be aware of this.  It's not exactly set up for a quiet night out, even on the calmest of times, and this certainly wasn't that.\n\nThe good news for older crowds (those without younger kids) is that if you're waiting for a table, you can wait in the bar section.  They also have these very long tables that run the length of the bar area, and you can even eat there if you don't mind the crowd.  We didn't really feel like waiting, and since the whole building had a sort of bar feel to it, felt like it really didn't matter.\n\nIn the end, it didn't.  The only problem with this was getting the attention of a waitress.  Once we did, service went along fairly well, though getting refills was a bit slow.\n\nThe food was good, and priced decently, but appetizers were expensive, as can be expected in most bars.  Wings especially were not cheap.  But it was all tasty.  I don't know that we'll be back, but it's certainly better than most bars, and definitely a leg up on most sports bars.", "business_id": "r-pBY6vR_Iu5XhPRvPnquw", "stars": 3, "date": "2007-03-26", "type": "review"}

I had hair down to the crack in my rear. I wore black jeans, a flannel shirt over a metal band t-shirt, and  the typical denim jacket covered in patches saluting heavy metal bands like Iron Maiden, Metallica, Slayer, Skid Row, and of course... Alice Cooper. I was cool.\n\nCooper's Town is part Hard Rock Cafe and part ESPN Zone. They have a small amount of rock memorabilia, signed guitars and such, hanging on the walls. They have a large amount of sports memorabilia and over 15 television screens to watch currently happening games, games of the past, and highlights from different sporting events around the country. A mix of music, surprisingly mostly not metal, plays overhead. \n\nThe servers all sport black t-shirts with a white image of Alice Cooper's eyes with his eyeliner reminiscent of The Crow. They are also all wearing said eyeliner. It looked a bit silly on many of them, but I do have to give them points for wearing it proudly and not seeming too embarrassed about it. I have to admit that I found the decor of the bar and the wear of the staff amusing at least. I give them a star for that.\n\nOur server was reasonably chipper. She paid a reasonable amount of attention to us for most of our time there, but ignored us for quite a while once the food came then a bit longer once we were done. \n\nThe food was decent, but barely decent. My fiance got the a salad with Thai-inspired chicken and peanut sauce. She said the peanut sauce was good and the chicken okay, but the salad was all iceberg lettuce. Iceberg? Really? Only iceberg? Keep in mind that her and I eat out a lot. It's only at the small hole-in-the-wall greasy spoon that we would ever expect to get a lot of iceberg, much less ONLY iceberg in a salad. \"That's the way we do a lot of our salads,\" we were told by the server. My burger, which was supposed to be cooked medium, came very well done. It was akin to chewing a meat-flavored hockey puck. \n\nThe only good point, foodwise, was the dessert. We got a sort of cinnamony apple cobbler with vanilla ice cream. It was good. It was pretty darn good. I give them a star for that.\n\nWhen we got the bill, we saw that we were not charged for the mostly iceberg salad. We didn't really expect to not have to pay for it, but were pleased indeed that we didn't. I give them a star for that.\n\nOverall, the food and the service were pretty lacking.

I'm not a religious man. Easter is just another day of the week for me, however I am a man who can appreciate a day off work. That said, I am grateful that you were open so that I and my degenerate crew could enjoy your establishment. \n\nThing 2: Thank you for having delicious food. That is all.\n\nThis was our first time trying Welcome Diner. We pretty much almost tried one of everything... because why not. \n\nThe Fried Green Tomato Sandwich and the Biscuits and Gravy were my top two items. As I've declared unabashedly in the past, I'm from the south and these two items brought me back home. Very well done in their own unique way. \n\nI think the thing that was most surprising about WD is that they were churning out this great food from such an unassuming place. It looks like they just dropped a little ol' diner right in a residential neighborhood. The location is also just east of Roosevelt Row, in a slightly more rough area. Not bad, but some people might shy away. \n\nThe only issue I see, particularly with summer coming up is that, if I'm not mistaken (which I could be), majority of the seating is outside. There are sun shades, but from our experience, even with said shades, if you're sitting in the wrong spot, you could still get pretty toasty from the sun. \n\nWe sat outside on our visit because it was beautiful.

The location is great, far enough out of downtown to avoid the clutter and close enough to have train access and feel like you're in a more urban area. Big family style benches allow for friend-making outside and individual tables inside. I'm surprised I came back after the first time. On a busier night, we couldn't get service to save our lives. We made sure we weren't stepping on toes by seating ourselves and sat, staring at servers running AROUND us for 15 minutes before going to the bar and begrudgingly ordering a beer from there instead. We sat and tried to shake it off while drinking one of many draft choices and waited, trying to make any contact with a server so we could get a menu or so I could merely ask where the bathroom was at-but nothing. I even timed how long it would take to get any attention without waving my arms around and after 10 more minutes we gave up. Apparently we were also given up on because the only interaction we had was the server rudely ripping our drink menu off the table without a word! That being the last straw, our feelings a little hurt, and trying to dial down why we felt like we were refused service, we left half full beers and walked out upset. I still over analyze the situation and try and figure out what in the hell we did wrong! \nNow, we came back to meet with friends almost a year later and service was slightly more decent. For mediocre bar food and bare minimum service that I usually have to flag down or jump straight to the bar for.

The patio makes you forget that you are in the middle of the desert, the waitstaff is friendly, knowledgeable and fun, and the food...wow. The bruschetta goes unmatched in the Valley and pretty much any other place I've visited. It's so good that I don't bother to order it anywhere else. Nothing compares. The chicken and mozzarella panini has quickly become my favorite sandwich in town. I sub the pesto in for the mayo, and I can't think of anything I'd rather have for lunch. The downfall is the parking situation, but with a little patience or a few dollars for the valet, you'll be seated and enjoying a delicious meal in no time.

But no one was there ... And there were empty tables ... Something did not seem right and when I asked her about it again, she rudely just stared at me. 2 hours later, we got seated and ignored. It took another hour (!) for our bruschetta to arrive to our table. We left feeling hungry  and  neglected. The worst part is that I started to ask around and I have three (3) other friends with almost the exact same experience.

I used to really enjoy going out to eat and didn't ever stop to wonder if I was getting a good deal. Lately, though, I've been paying close attention to what all of the foods cost and comparing them to other eating establishments.\n\nMy daughter's school was having a fundraiser at this Chili's last night. It was the kind that they donate a certain percentage of the total bill to the school. We try to help the school whenever we can, so we decided to make it a fun night out with the kids. My daughters enjoyed themselves and saw a few friends, and we all got to relax and let other people do the work.\n\nMy issue with this restaurant, though, and why I gave it two stars, is strictly with the value of the food. I understand that the costs of everything are increasing, so business establishments have to raise their prices accordingly, but they should still be able to offer a decent value.\n\nWe ordered the Southern Smokehouse Bacon Burger for my wife and I to split, and the kids ordered a corn dog and a quesadilla. My wife and I usually split meals because they are so big and calorie-laden, and it helps to keep costs down. Most of the time we leave feeling full and happy. When they brought out our food this evening, though, my half of the burger was tiny! The burger was supposed to contain bacon and onion straws, and according to pictures, was supposed to be packed with them. There was a tiny piece of bacon on my half, and a few scattered onion straws. I looked over to my wife's plate, expecting to see the bulk of the toppings on her burger, but her toppings were as pathetic looking as mine. The size of her half of the burger was not much bigger than mine, either. She said hers was exceptionally greasy and didn't taste how she expected it to taste. This was a little burger to start out with, and splitting it only made it worse. And it was $10.99!!\n\nThe burgers are, like most places, served with french fries. When we split meals at other restaurants, they usually give us both a full portion of fries. I know it's not the healthiest thing to be chomping down, but because we go out to eat so infrequently we don't worry about it. We want to get a pile of fries with our meal. The amount of fries delivered with our meal last night was a joke! My wife had maybe fifteen fries on her plate, and I had about eight. Seriously?! I know this restaurant is in business to make money, so they don't want to give everything away, but how much does an extra handful of fries cost for the few people that are splitting meals.\n\nThe kids meals were, in their opinion, good. The corn dog and celery sticks were quickly devoured, while the quesadilla and oranges were left mostly intact. (typical kids!). I tried a few bites of the quesadilla. It was ok, but was pretty small because of the meager amount of cheese. The kids meals, with the included drink, are $4.99. Not cheap, but not outrageous either.\n\nI like to leave every restaurant feeling that I got a good value for my money. I know that a good restaurant can give me that, while still making a decent profit off of me. When we left last night we looked at our bill and reminded ourselves why we don't go out very often. My wife said that she's going to keep the bill, so that any time she craves this type of food she can look at it and remind herself that we can eat much better and cheaper at home. Or at least at a restaurant that gives us our money's worth.", "business_id": "_BU867oRCLZnDIRmg7S6Wg", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-04-30", "type": "review"}

If this was not the best veal I have had in my life then it certainly was the best veal in the last 25 years. My husband had Shrimp Risotto and he was enthusiastic it as well. The entrees came with a perfectly dressed salad made with a balsamic vinaigrette that was not the usual dressing overwhelmed by the vinegar. They must have used a white balsamic because it was so subtle.

We usually don't have a bad experience, but today I went with my family and the overall experience was not good. The chips and salsa were great.. But they always are! There were not that many people on this Sunday afternoon but our server was not very attentive.. He was friendly of course but walked by us several times at a decent pace while we had empty drinks. Our food was brought out by someone different who didn't ask us if we needed anything else along with our meal. He walked away relatively quickly but he too was very friendly. Our server never came to our table after the food was served to ask how it was or if we needed anything. We had to get his attention because of course we did have a small request. My chicken was a bit too salty.. And I rarely say that because I love salt! They also had arizonas fox center playing on the tv and speaker.. Then about 25 minutes in we noticed that it was just on repeat? Not sure why but we had to listen to the entire broadcast twice. Then toward the end, a group of employees sat in the booth behind us and started talking relatively loud and cussing.. Now granted I understand I was sitting in one of the booths on the bar side my younger sister, but considering there was no one there.. I felt that it was not necessary to yell. We don't eat at chilis very often but when we do return I will consider a different location.", "business_id": "zARGEdB0JyPCPR0f3FKGxQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-03-23", "type": "review"}

It was funny because we where suggesting chilis and black angus and she would bring up coco' each time. but i told my wife i am done with those type of places. So we got to goto chili's :-) i ordered the memphis dry rub ribs. Ive had them before and i love the flavor. The ribs where kind of dry and i had to rip the meat off the bone. It wasnt as dry as famous daves though.

Fellow NY-er here says this restaurant has some of the best NY pizza in town! They also catered my brother's rehearsal dinner and all the food was great.

Me- \"Wow you remodeled the place\"  LIz- the wonderful, superstar waitress- \"Yeah, nine years ago\" -hahahaahahah! PWEEWWT!!!! I guess I have been eating mostly take out or catering from them over the last few years. LOL! The place looks beautiful and the food is outstanding. The owner is from Smithtown, NY and I love her and this place. Manga!\n\nPS- Hello did I mention Steve Benson was there?- Again did I mention Steve Benson does first Friday's there? You can get a caricature done by none other than Steve Benson. Oops, I'm sorry did I mention Steve Benson is there once a month on Fridays Dj'-ing and drawing -(D and D-lol)  Being politically motivated/involved and an executive member of AEA I was in heaven!

For whatever reasons, BAS seems to crank out some pretty good food consistently.\n\nBack in the day (late 70s) the BAS at Alma School and Southern was THE place to eat in Mesa.  Decor has changed from the olden days but I say the food quality has actually improved.  In most cases the veggies (green beans and asparagus in my case) are always good to great.  Only critique here...they haven't yet properly figured how to trim asparagus.\n\nAs for appetizers we always get the fried zucchini.   Very good, not greasy and comes with a great cucumber dipping sauce.\n\nSteaks are good.  To be honest, some night the quality is better than others, but overall its good.\n\nI always order the wedge salad...big enough for two to share.  Since you get two choices of veggies (includes salads) with each meal, I highly recommend a party of two spit a wedge salad and the get three other vegetables.  They usually have good choices and they do do veggies good here.", "business_id": "OjNTZTZ6HYQghJN-3jmwnA", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-05-12", "type": "review"}
