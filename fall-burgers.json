I was greeted by the hostess,who was polite and friendly, and I informed her that I was alone.  She had just arrived, as well, and wasn't exactly sure what was going on yet, so she asked (the manager?) where she should seat me.  After receiving guidance, she brought me to a table towards the back.  It had not yet been cleaned after the previous guests had dined.  So, she quickly got it cleared off, grabbed a rag, and wiped it down.\n\nThe waitress came rather quickly to take my drink order.  She was extremely friendly.  I ordered coffee and water, which she went and got while I looked over the menu.  She returned, and took my order.  I ordered the Cinnamon Swirl French Toast Special - Three slices of French toast made with Pittsburgh's own Jenny Lee\u00ae Cinnamon Swirl, two farm-fresh eggs, with bacon or sausage (I chose sausage), and your choice of potato (I went with the cheesy hash brown casserole).  I also added an orange juice.  She went and put my order in, while I waited, and came back with it after not too long.   The eggs were cooked exactly how I wanted them, the cheesy hash brown casserole and the french toast were both delicious.  I also enjoyed the sausage which was pretty typical.\n\nKings Family Restaurant featured a very friendly staff, great prices, and tasty food.

After some searching online, apparently all their steak subs only have a quarter pound of steak.\n\nFor some reason based on the picture of the RoethlisBurger in the window outside we thought it was going to be a lot bigger.

The meats on both sandwiches were so tender and flavorful. The cheesesteak was the best sandwich I've ever had. My husband loved the \"#7\" so much that he ate until he was over-full.

I've had famous burgers such as the ones at Mr. Bartley's up in MA or the french bread burgers down at Rotier's in Nashville as well as regional burgers like the green chili cheeseburgers of the southwest.\n\nAfter it all, I still see Tessaro's as one of the best burgers I've had ever (my other top burger joints are scattered throughout the midwest where the beef is as fresh as fresh gets).  I started out with medium rare burgers when I first started going there, but eventually I toned down the knob to rare.  My cheese choice is always a slice of American.\n\nI typically like my burgers griddled with only burger bun and cheese, but since Tessaro's serves up \"Pub Burgers\", I find it okay to eat with rabbit food (lettuce, tomato, onion).  Ketchup on a burger is blasphemy.  There is never a reason to add ketchup on a burger unless the burger is of poor quality.  Ketchup on a good burger is like heading to a prime steakhouse and asking for A1.  Save it for when you overcook your burgers at home or when you're at McDonald's.  Mustard is okay in reasonable quantities since its texture and taste complements the burger as opposed to covering it up.\n\nMy first thought was wow. These buns are huge. The top bun was awkwardly round and I had squish it a little to get a first bite that consisted of both burger and bun. It worked out in the end, as the buns were able to sop up all the excess beef juice without getting excessively soggy and difficult to hold. The patty itself was perfectly cooked. A full half pound of loosely packed coarse ground beef. I'm not sure what blend they use (definitely more than just chuck), but I want to guess around 75-80% lean, which is perfect in my book. The beef itself had an amazing texture and wasn't heavily seasoned. The beef itself tasted remarkably fresh and just the right amount of \"beefy\". I usually order cheeseburgers over hamburgers as the slice of cheese makes the burger more forgiving to being overcooked and dry; however, at Tessaro's, this was not the case. The slice of American cheese was perfectly melted and added the textural difference between the soft buns, the crisp lettuce, and the beefy patty. The lettuce and onions added additional contrast with their crunchy attributes, and the acidity from the two tomato slices balanced out the cheese. The soggy pickles were overshadowed by the red onion slices which offered not only a crunch but also a spicy kick, and I did not notice them at all.\n\nMy side choice is always home fries.  They come slightly charred and taste of delicious butter.  I had half my portion \"naked\" and paired the half with the traditional Heinz ketchup. Honestly they didn't need the extra boost of flavor from the ketchup as they were amazing beforehand already. With the addition of the Heinz, the subtle tones of the char and butter were covered up, which was a pity.\n\nWhen you go to a steakhouse you order a steak.  When you go to a coffeehouse you order a coffee.  When you go to Tessaro's you order a burger.", "business_id": "vgXE1I7c9ElcfYyZfQiN1Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-10-01", "type": "review"}

Also, IMHO, grilled meat tastes better, but griddled meat is juicer.\n\nThe burgers are served on what appears to be a Portuguese style bun, rather plain tasting they add very little to the burger itself. Toppings are simple lettuce, tomato, onions, etc. Their goal is to highlight the meat and not cover it up with lots of toppings or sauces.\n\nOn the side I had the home-fries, which they suggested, and to be honest they were disgustingly gross. Overcooked lumps of potato and onions saturated in grease that not only looked bad but didn't taste very good either.\n\nI like the ambience of the local burger joint, but thought a burger for $ 9.00 was pretty spendy.

This is a dive joint in a quintessential Pittsburgh blue collar neighborhood. Had the cheeseburger with potato salad and it was great. Will defer to others on the \"best burger\" argument. Only complaint is the lack of appetizers on the menu (e.g., no wings). And why don't they offer fries? I mean the potato salad was ok, but we like fries with our burgers.\n\nbtw...knew I was in Pittsburgh when they turned off the NFL MNF game for a regular season Colorado-Toronto hockey game (ie., not even for the Penguins).

One, I moved here from South Florida, where the best burgers in town came from your average diners.  They were the last bastion of American food in South Florida, so they served up REAL American food.  If you wanted a real burger, you went to a diner.  After returning to Pittsburgh, I found that every diner here has turned to serving up those frozen gray hockey puck patties and passing them off as burgers.\n\nSecond, (until the recent explosion of good burger joints in da burgh), I actually HAD been a fan of Tessaro's, until their hostess/manager flat out offended the hell out of me and my party of three.  The result is that I have never, and WILL never return to Tessaro's.\n\nMy best friend is a 62 y/o blind woman that I met doing theater in the 90's in Pittsburgh.  She lives with her 91 year old mother, and her father (the driver) passed away several years ago.  I don't drive, and rely on the bus system that Steve Bland is intentionally systematically destroying, so any outing that we make must be carefully planned.\n\nShe and I had met once at Tessaro's.  It was her first time being there.  She took the Access van for the disabled, and I met her there after work via bus.  I walked in, she was seated, having a drink, waiting for me to join her. No problem.  We had a great meal, with an awesome burger.  I can't say enough...they really do have mouthwatering burgers.\n\nMonths later, we decided to go again, and the plan was pretty much the same.  She took the Access van to the restaurant, and I was going to meet her by bus, and this time a new friend was going to join us, coming by bus from Oakland, and new to Pittsburgh.\n\nMy best friend called me at 4:30 (we were supposed to meet at 5) and said that her van had come early, and that she was already at the restaurant.  I told her I would get there as soon as I could.  I left work a few minutes before 5 pm, and arrived at the restaurant 5:15.  They were busy, but I was surprised to find my friend still standing in the doorway.  The blind woman had been standing there for 45 minutes.  \n\nI made my presence known, and the hostess/manager acknowledged, asked about our other friend. I explained that he was ten minutes away and coming by bus, new to the city, but WAS on his way.  She walked away from us.  We stood in the doorway fro another twenty minutes.\n\nFinally, the manager came back, and I caught her attention, and motioned my head toward my blind friend, and asked if we really had to keep waiting?  She'd been standing there in the doorway for over an hour.\n\nThe next statement sealed the deal on us never returning to Tessaro's.  The manager slapped her hands on her hips, and started barking:\n\n\"LOOK!  We don't have many rules around here!  In fact, we only have ONE, that you don't get seated until your whole party is here!\"\n\nAnd THIS is what really sealed it:\n\nThe woman thrust her thumb in my BLIND friend's direction, who had only been to Tessaro's ONCE before in her life, with me, and said:\n\n\"And SHE oughta KNOW that!\"\n\nShe oughta know that?  Exactly HOW should she 'know that'? The only other time she'd been there, she arrived before me, was seated, waited, and I joined her.\n\nAdditionally, the 'rule' was posted...on a piece of 8 1/2 by 11 copy paper, taped to the wall at the end of the counter, behind several rows of water pitchers.  I couldn't see the 'rule'...a blind woman certainly wasn't going to 'see' it!\n\nFinally, after another ten minutes standing there, the manager 'allowed' us to take a table and wait for our friend, who came five minutes later.  We ate our meal, paid our bill, and we left.\n\nAnd we will NOT return.\n\nYou can treat me badly, and if there's something I really love about your business, I might come back.  But do NOT badmouth a blind woman, or anyone else for that matter, who is disabled, and in need of a slight amount of extra consideration.\n\nTessaro's, you might make good burgers, and you'll continue making a fortune off them.  And I'm sure you really don't give a crap about how your manager treated this lady.  But we will NOT drop one dime more in your restaurant.  We'll take our business to Burgatory.", "business_id": "vgXE1I7c9ElcfYyZfQiN1Q", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-10-19", "type": "review"}

This is supposed to be the best burgers in the 'burgh. If that were the case, I'd stick to making my own. \nHubs and I stopped at T's on a recent Friday night after conducting some business in the area. Baby on board, we walked in and waited to be greeted. The inside looked a bit old and run down. Tip: they do not have highchairs only booster seats which is impossible to get a squirmy baby to stay in. I would not suggest bringing a baby here. The tables are also very small and close together. We actually had to move the table out to get in and out of the corner booth. I decided on the basic cheeseburger and ordered the boiled red skin potatoes for the baby and a side of chips for me fully expecting homemade chips. Not the case. I got a handful of what seemed to be a ruffles knock off. The potatoes were very bland despite being served with warm butter on the side. Great for a picky baby. Bad for an adult who is looking for something tasty. Now to the burger. Huge, yes. Juicy, not even close. Despite ordering my burgers well done, I expect them to still be tender and juicy. This was not the case. My burger was as dry as a burnt piece of chicken. I ate half of it. We were in a bit of a hurry so I didn't mention it to my server, though I'm not sure it would have made a difference seeing hubs medium burger was also dry.

We had home fries as our sides - I don't even really like home fries, but these were so yummy. Great food all around.\n\nOur food came out lightning fast. We didn't even think it was ours because it was literally five minutes after we ordered. And the service was amazing: so friendly, attentive and efficient. The hostess is the cutest little woman as well. So helpful and sweet. Not to mention, it's so affordable. I was very happy we came across this place.\n\nMy only complaint is that the dining tables in the back are very, very, very close together when they are all split into two-person tables.

Maybe. For those who are not up to speed on a traditional Chicago dog, it consists of: an all beef frank, onions, uber green relish, yellow mustard, sport peppers, tomato and a pickle spear hugged into a poppy seed bun. Matt's definitely delivers on these components. The dog was a bit snappy, like I enjoy, and all the condiments were fresh and tasty. \n\nThe Hot Dog Meal Deal (#1) came with the loaded Chicago dog, a drink and your choice of fries or chips for $6.22. I went with the fries and I have to say, I was a little bit disappointed...they were a little smushy. You can also read Tonya's most recent review on her description of the fries.

This is one of those times.  You see, I'm often wondering if my mom is going to slap me for not saying anything nice and then bitch-slap me for never listening.  Or something.  I really wasn't paying attention.\n\nOr maybe it is not that bad.  There are, after all, nice things to say about Matt's.  But there are spotty areas as well.\n\nFirst the good...\n\nThe decor is marvelous (insert mid-80s Fernando accent via Billy Crystal here).  They have a decent number of seats, the outdoor seating is second-to-none - but you can bring your own lunch and get that, so it's not really specific to Matt's.\n\nAnd the not-so-good...\n\nThe menu selection is immense.  So much so that you'll want to go when the place isn't crowded so that you have a reasonable chance of looking it over before ordering so as not to get in the way of anyone else.  That generally doesn't happen in most hot dog stands, either on the street or indoors because you have about two choices: All the way or plain, where you add your own condiments.\n\nAnd the rest...\n\nThough you can find Italian Beef and Chicago-style dogs in the same place, you don't always want to.  Focus on your specialty.  And that's the real problem here.  There is so much going on - visually and on the grill - that they don't seem to do anything really well.\n\nThough the staff is nice enough, and food is decent, it's just not that great.  Fries are limp.  House-made chips are nice and thin, but they are so thin that they can't support anything (dressing, chili leavings from dogs, not even the crunch from the fryer).  Dogs are average.\n\nI would much rather get a dog from Green's, or maybe Hap's, both of which have that awesome hot dog counter vibe and make me want more.  Matt?

Like Nicole said, is it the best Chicago dog I've ever had? Not even close. Is it the best Chicago dog in Charlotte? I say YES. They've got the traditional ingredients down pat, the Vienna beef sausage (yes, that's what a \"hot dog\" is.....an encased meat sausage), the neon green relish, the steamed poppy seed bun (which is the quintessential defining part of a Chicago dog), sport peppers, tomato, a pickle and MUSTARD (Chicago dogs NEVER, repeat, NEVER EVER use Ketchup!). \n\nSo I got a Chicago Dog and a special called the Fire Dog today which was a spicy Polish sausage with grilled onions, brown mustard and I opted for the sauerkraut. It was a good dog, with all the flavors expected. Fries are usually good here, but my criticism is that they lack some seasonings.....hell use Lawry's Seasoned Salt or something and fry them a tad longer to get more of a crisp on them. They're not bad but certainly CAN be better!\n\nBeing a lover of Portillos, Mr. Beef and Al's in Chicago, Matt's version of Chicago Beef is just meh.....sausage isn't bad but their beef just isn't flavorful enough for my tastes. I mean it's not bad, just not up to my expectation from what I remember from back home. OK now I'm being picky and critical.....me bad. \n\nFor first time visitors, just know that the portions are NOT very big (at least for the dogs). Recommend getting a combo with 2 Chicago Dogs or a combo Beef/Sausage. Even the females in my group complained that one dog wasn't quite enough. Jumbo dog is also an option. They should offer a TWO DOG JUMBO combo for us bigger eaters.\n\nSo overall I love Matt's as it does provide me with a LITTLE taste of home.

Then, some more patrons arrived and were waiting in line behind me.  This is when a waitress who was taking orders at a nearby table told is we could sit wherever we wanted so I decided to sit downstairs since the upstairs was crowded with kids.

So I make my way over to the other side of the room and sit at a booth literally 3 feet from the bar and no one notices me........  The guy that was waiting on the booths was busy watching a college football game with some patrons..... So I get up and sit at the bar where the bartender quickly got my drink and took my order.

The burger is just as it sounds, consisting of a bun, beef patty, BBQ sauce cheddar cheese, lettuce and tomatoes, with fried onions.

There was no version of the burger made with pineapple slices and teriyaki sauce...but maybe that's because Buffett supposedly wrote \"Cheeseburger in Paradise\" in the Carribbean...which changes everything.  Maybe that's why they serve the Cubano, which was still subpar at best.\n\nOverall, the food was satisfactory.  If I am ever in town again or happen to pass by a Cheeseburger in Paradise, I might go back because the drinks are good and the burgers are yummy.  It is a decent meal that won't break your wallet, but take a hint by the restaurant's name and order a cheeseburger.  WWJBD...what would Jimmy Buffett do?  Probably order a Cheeserburger in Paradise, and so should you.", "business_id": "1hBOR97oX5Xph3J8Tdob7w", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-09-12", "type": "review"}

We normally grab lunch or dinner at the Noodles & Co. there, but I didn't want to for a few reasons (I wanted more food for my buck and I wanted to sit with \"normal\" people in a COMFORTABLE atmosphere), so we decided to try Red Robin.  None of us had ever been there.  It was me, my boyfriend and our 8-year-old daughter.  \n\nBoy were we surprised!  Not only is it a very family-friendly atmosphere, but it's just a fun place in general (no matter your age).  We enjoyed the tablet at our table (could be used to order drinks, appetizers or desserts, as well as to pay your bill, join their rewards club and to play games), even though we were charged a $2 entertainment fee, because our daughter played games (still, it was great to be able to sit there and talk as adults and enjoy our meal while she was entertained).  \n\nOur food was excellent.  I normally don't like \"pub fries\", which is what I think of when I see the fries they offer, so I was unsure about the bottomless fries, but I ordered a burger (the Black & Bleu) and I upgraded my bottomless fries for 99 cents to the Garlic Parmesan Fries and got the garlic dipping sauce for the fries.  They were amazing and I did get a second helping of them (second batch was double the size of the first).  I ate every last bit of my meal.  It was excellent.\n\nMy daughter was thrilled with her choices.  She also has bottomless fries, their corndog bites and a chocolate milk shake.

The only good thing about this restaurant was the hostess, after that everything else went downhill. My server was very untidy and she took forever to get my food. She looked like she had just finished her day shift at a pizza shop and forgot to change her dirty apron which was caked with white dust. Brought me a meal different from what I ordered and didn't have the guts to apologize for it. The food came on a skillet which was supposed to be sizzling but it was cold. Very unappetizing with overlooked onions and a very tiny piece of meat. Place wasn't that busy so I fail to understand why it took over 30 min to get my food. And it looked like a dog had passed on the food then it was brought to me. When she asked me how the food was, I told her that it wasn't what I ordered and she just rolled her eyes. I was tired and didn't want to start fussing with her so I just paid and left. But one thing I can commend about the restaurant is the fact that when I requested for my check, it came in less than 30 seconds.

We almost turned away because we didn't have cash on us, and didn't feel like hitting the ATM inside, I mean we got back in the car, talked for a second and then said what the heck!  \n\nWalked in to a tiny little place with a LONG bar!  There were probably 4 people at the bar, and 3 people in the game room playing pool.  They had the classic MLB game on, it was like Blue Jays and Astros, funny uniforms! It was maybe 2pm.  So the bartender says, What can I get for you?  My dumbazz says \"Can I see a menu\", this is where the music would have stopped.  WHOOPSY, there really isn't a menu, its kind of like a snack bar, where you look up, make your choice and its done.  Burger or Dog, Fries, Onion Rings or both!! DUH!  The bartender was nice though, I wanted draft the BF wanted bottle so he suggested I get a small pitcher, it's the cheapest way to go...SOLD! Don't have to pull my leg, thats for sure!  \n\nSo, I ordered the cheeseburger, and the BF orders the gigantic chili burger, which was reduced to the smaller one by recommendation of the friendly bartender. BF sort of put up a fight, but the bartender assured him it would be plenty and if not, the next one was on him.  This turned out to be plenty for him, and I was thankful too, we had a long night ahead of us.  Much to our surprise, although I'm not sure what else we were thinking, bartender grabs a handful of meat slaps it on the flat top smooshes it down, and thus our burgers were born and cooking.  I mean, for real?  Man it was soo good, greasy yes, but everything a burger should be!  The last bite of course was the best, it had me looking for my other half, since I always cut those suckers in half.  I don't eat burgers often, but I can't wait to take my dad here, I might have finally found one place in town he's never been too.\n\nWhile we were finishing up, a couple came in and sat next to us, who appeared to have just finished a golf game.  They ordered shots of Patron, I don't know how we got out without doing one with them.  The lady on the other side of us was getting her car washed next door so she said she comes in every time.

I'd been going there fairly regularly for something like 20 years.  The guy who started it (Harvey, I presume) ran it for around 40 years, until he died.  His daughter ran it for another five years (about) but decided running a dive bar wasn't what she wanted to do with her life and put it up for sale.\n\nIt was bought by a Vietnamese couple who upgraded the interior.  They added a bunch of big flat screen TVs, started taking credit cards.  The place used to be cash only, although they did put in an ATM a couple years back.\n\nHarvey's signature was the wineburger, hand formed from quality beef.  Always excellent,  But the new owners switched out for preformed patties of cheaper meat.  That was a spoiler for me.  And apparently not only me.  The last time I went there under those owners I was the only one there.  I wonder why they couldn't figure out where their crowd had gone.  I ordered a hot dog.\n\nBut apparently those owners dumped the place as a loser (said the bartender).  I went there last week.  Whomever bought it brought back the first class meat (98%) with fresh, hand made patties.  It's back on my recommended list.\n\nWhat other people say about the ambiance is true.  It =is= a dive bar.  I mean that in the best sense.  Cheap drinks, a friendly crowd (many of whom seem to be regulars; they know each other).\n\nThis review-o-matic only offers me a choice of 1 or 2 for ratings.

It has a bunch of restaurants I like and ones that I wanted to try, including OT.  So I made a reservation for 7:00 on a Friday and went with my husband. \n\nI didn't even realize that I had made a reservation on a First Friday.  There was a loud party going on in the back and the entire staff seemed a bit flustered catering to them and the normal restaurant crowd.  You'd think they'd have their act together having to deal with First Friday on average of once per month.  Guess not. \n\nWe arrived an hour early in hopes of sitting at the bar to get a feel for the place and take advantage of their happy hour.  This is where the bad experiences started.  I had two glasses of wine and my husband had two top shelf martinis.  When we got the bill, we noticed I had been charged $1 per glass over the price listed in the wine menu, and my husband had been charged full price for the martinis that were supposed to be on happy hour special ($9 each instead of $7).  Very disingenuous, and strike #1.  To the bartender's credit, rather than mess with the computer and get the charges correct, she simply took off one of the glasses of wine, which more than made up for the overcharge.  I wish this had been the only hiccup, but. . . \n\nOnce we were seated at our table, I was overwhelmed by the scent of vanilla.  All of the candles they used on all of the tables were scented!  Anyone that has ever planned a reception with food knows (and every restauranteur should know) that this is a big no-no because the smell of the candles totally alters the taste of the food.  I blew out the candle on our table immediately, but this is strike #2. \n\nSince we had the gift certificate, we decided to go with a three course meal - soups, apps, entrees.   Amazingly, all of the food came out to the table at the same time.  We had a table full of food getting cold as we started on our soup.  Strike #3.  \n\nAs for the food, the french onion soups we had were actually quite good.  The bacon wrapped prawns appetizer was ok, the dipping sauces were nothing special.  My lemon artichoke chicken was also good but my husband's grilled meatloaf, while he enjoyed it, tasted more like Italian sausage.  \n\nUnfortunately, when we got the bill, we again noticed that we had been overcharged on our glasses of wine (different wine than at the bar).  We didn't think much of it this time since we were using the gift certificate anyway.  But here's the icing on the cake - when you use the gift certificate, they add on gratuity based on the original amount of the bill.  Fine, no big deal.  The original bill was $61, so with the $25 certificate it *should* have come to $36 + gratuity.  When we got the revised bill the amount listed $44 and said \"($8 included gratuity)\".  A few days later, checking my bank statement, I saw OT was kind enough to charge us $52. . .they double charged the gratuity!  $16 tip on a $61 meal!  Effectively making the $25 certificate $17!  Strikes #4, 5, and 6.

If it were a little more compact and there wasn't a mountain to look at outside, I would almost think that I was back home! But enough about that. Let's get to the food!\n\nI had a slider, a 1/3 lb cheddar and some fries. All this was under $10 so the prices get a thumbs up! Flavor-wise, the food kicked my mouth's ass... The slider had me saying, \"White Castle, what??\" The fries were crispy on the outside and soft/hot on the inside (which is pretty much perfect). Lastly, the burger...oh the burger. Yeah, if you're craving a juicy, cheesy, greasy and all around mouthwatering burger, look no further. Every bite made me take a look at the burger and think of how good it was.\n\nIt is safe to assume that I'll be back to this place to try more of their food. Next time I'm definitely getting a Chi-town dog! =)", "business_id": "iNvY0zAlaD_ye7Z6rHu-Ug", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-10-04", "type": "review"}

I got a cheese burger with bacon but only mayo and ketchup.  Despite all the craziness that goes on inside, they are wicked efficient in clearing the ordering line and then they pump through the orders like nobody's business.

She likes to call it \"Chicag - eee's\" (Like weenies).  This is one of those places where a little dirt is not only acceptable but seems to add to the flavor.  I'm not talking about health code issues, just the dirt that comes from a well-worn well-known place.  The staff and cooks toil hard yet are always quick and friendly.  The food is great.  It's not backyard bbq good - - - it's hole-in-the-wall kinda good.  The shakes are great.  The prices are even better.  My daughter always wins a stuffed animal from the \"Claw Arcade Game\" - - - although it's probably cause I give her 20 quarters.  She and I both love the sliders.  They have a good flatscreen that always has a game on.  The only thing that would make me want to stay longer or go more frequently would be to put Galaga instead of Pac-Man.

Good food, mostly nice service friendly atmosphere and seemingly clean. My husband always orders for me so he asked what I wanted. I told him I would like coffee with my food because I was cold  then I might have something after eating. I ate my taco's my husband ate his breakfast.  When the second person came around he asked if he could get us anything else. I asked for a rum and coke. he said something to the effect of he wasn't serving anymore drinks that day. We actually thought he was joking then he brought us the bill. I asked him again for a drink and he said I looked drunk. Tired maybe but hadn't had anything to drink that day. I paid my check and told him that we would not be back. He said, \" who cares\". He heard my husband order coffee from the other barmaid with my meal. My husband always orders for me.

They're yummy and they're cheap. And they're good! There are three basic breakfast options (no substitutions). $4 will buy you eggs, hash browns, sausage or bacon and toast. Can't go wrong there!  $6 is the same w/French Toast, Pancakes or a Biscuit. I've never tried anything else off the regular menu, however they do offer omelettes and regular lunch and dinner options. \n\nThere's never any parking. (Seriously). This gritty place offers ample television viewing options to catch a game. (Twenty one of them!) The downside is there doesn't appear to be any sound offered. Wifi if you want it. \n\nA pitcher of beer is five bucks. Apparently this is a really good place to get tanked on the cheap. Or to recover from a hangover.

It was your typical Wendy's experience. No bells and whistles, except for the drink machine...which, by the way, appears to have several HUNDRED possible drink combinations. The decor looked like it has since I was a kid (p.s. a long time ago)...dated, to say the least.\n\nEven driving up to the Yelp Event, I barely recognize the building. From the outside, you can see that there have been MAJOR renovations done. There are sleek, dark, tinted windows all along the roof line, coupled with ceiling to floor tinted windows surrounding the new seating area.\n\nAfter checking out the Yelp table (and picking up a couple of \"Here's The Beef\" t-shirts), my family and I went in.\n\nUpon passing through the second glass door, we were IMMEDIATELY lost. EVERYTHING had changed! \n\nThe first thing that caught our attention was the all new seating area immediately to the left. There are two sets of two chairs facing one another, making for a rather intimate setting. Hung on the wall is a beautiful HDTV. But, the piece de resistance for the seating area was the faux fireplace. It was absolutely beautiful!\n\nThe overall decor has been completely modernized. The old, tired booths and seats have been replaced with updated seating. On top of the dividing walls, there are beautiful glass accents. Where there used to be boring run-of-the-mill booths on the left of the dining area, there is now a gorgeous \"Arizona Room-esque\" glass palace. Within this seating area, there is another, albeit smaller, HDTV hung in the corner.\n\nNow, on to the service. I know there was a Yelp event going on, and you always put on a good show for company, but the management at this location really seem to have embraced the change that Wendy's is trying to make. Three different managers were walking throughout the dining area, greeting all of the customers, and handing out coupons for free things (burgers, fries, frosties, etc.). In fact, one of the managers offered to carry our food, and escorted us through the dining area to our seats. I know it's hard to get excited about the service at a fast food restaurant, but at least there's a ray of hope after today.\n\nBased on what I saw, it looks like Wendy's is well on their way to righting the ship as far as their restaurants are concerned. I'm sure they spent a pretty penny on these upgrades. If they can keep up the great service, and ride the wave of the buzz created by these renovations, I'm sure they're going to see a FANTASTIC return on their investment!\n\nThank you to Lindsey and her team for making my first Yelp event an awesome one!", "business_id": "En2GuQV7FoOGHhXX5SMEBg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-09-13", "type": "review"}

Unfortunate that the owner chooses to make this neighborhood seedy by leasing space to a pawn shop and a head shop. I've observed  him or his kid driving like an arrogant jerk, too. If my business' name was plastered all over my car, I'd be sure to be a courteous driver.\n\n=======================\n\nNewly re-opened after Sheriff Joe's raid, the 32nd St. Uncle Sam's is still trying to get its act together. Been here twice since the re-opening. Food service is rather slow. Both times the waitress did not pay enough attention to our table. On the second visit, our waitress was obsessed with cleaning and straightening the empty tables and practically ignored us once the food was delivered. She also forgot our drink order, we sat for 10 minutes until getting our beverages.\n\nThe wings come out VERY dry. We will remember to ask for them wet next time, this never used to be a problem.\n\nI would advise you to wait until next month (it's August 2013 right now) until the staff and kitchen is back in its old groove.\n\nThis leads me into another topic, what bothers me more than these failures is the owner's very obvious tightfistedness. Use a coupon from the mailer? It better total at least $25.00 to the penny or you won't get your $5 off. Even if you mention at the start that you have the \"$25/$5 off with two drinks\" coupon, the waitresses will not tell you if you hit the $25 when you make your order unless you ask them to, and I don't trust them to do the math anyway. What's worse, none of the staff nor the manager has the latitude to honor the coupon if you fall a little short. One time we were denied use of the coupon because our order had totaled $24.95. A FREAKING NICKEL SHORT.

It was cold however, but I guess it's time for me to get used to Arizonians creating artificial winters in every closed space. \n\nI had Longboard burger and it was good. Nothing special, but not bad at all. My other half had veggie hula burger and says it was pretty tasty for vegetarian option in burger joint (go figure). Service was good, but little overzealous with drink refills, to the point where we had to stop her to return some drinks. I understand the endless refills are sales point, but this was ridiculous. Who can drink 4 lemonades in 30 min?!\n\nI might be back if there is another specific reason or if it is the closest options. Otherwise, definitely won't lose sleep over going there again", "business_id": "hNVcBhJSD5HyLKMf_Z7TaA", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-10-26", "type": "review"}

The fries are crispy but not in an unnatural way. \n\nMake sure you are aware of the not-so-secret menu. I usually get a burger protein-style, animal-style, with mustard instead of spread. They get it right every time. Just went there yesterday with out of town family guests and they love the place, too. It is a priority whenever they visit. \n\nThe location at Desert Ridge can get kind of busy, but they always get you through the drive-through line surprisingly quickly.

What really sucks though is no matter how much you spend on a meal, when they come by with your meal and the condiments don't ask for ranch or bbq sauce because it's extra. This petty nickel and diming is a real big turnoff and that definitely deters me from eating here. \n\nThis location is easy to access and has a drive-through, which I think most of them do but I figure not everyone reading these reviews have been to whataburger so here you go.....\n\nBurgers are good and whataburger likes to emphasize on the fact that there are thousand and one possibilities for making a custom burger. Whatever your bag is, they can make it. The fries are pretty decent, sometimes they're a bit more saltier than I like but they are good. The pies are yummy! And of course last but not least, my favorite is the honey barbecue chicken strip sandwich on Texas toast. Delish!!!! I don't stop at this establishment a lot, primarily because they don't have a lot of locations but when I do that chicken strip sandwich is my jam! \n\nJust a side note, is it just me or has anyone noticed that whataburger seems to hire people on the low end of the spectrum to work here. I get the whole minimum-wage thing but sometimes I really question the mental stability of the person taking my order. Not trying to be mean or unheartful (I made that word up) but sometimes I feel like someone's a sandwich short of a picnic if you know what I mean. Hats off to them though, because even though I feel their employees are somewhat questionable, mainly appearance- they have never messed up an order.

I went in with 4 other friends to do their annual 3# burger challenge, we called a day in advanced and told them how many in our party and what time we'd be there. We left a call back number, etc. We got there at noon and the employee taking out order was clearly new and had no idea what was going on, \"I didn't even know we were having a challenge till like yesterday\". The manager was very rude and said \"you wee supposed to call\". We told him we did, and I saw our name, number in our party, and 12pm written on their paper. He told us it would take 40 minutes to cook, which is understandable, but defeated the purpose of calling the day before to tell them how many were coming and what time we'd be there. We didn't have time to wait 40 minutes and then eat the burger for an hour. Manager was very rude and annoyed that we even wanted to attempt the challenge. \n\nGood food but poor management.

Ohhh just the opposite, mouth watering delicious.  \n\nIf you are in to wings, they have these amazing dry rub wings that just bite you back.  Id get a ton of them if they were cheaper.. \n\nAlso if you love Root beer floats, get ready because for $3.00  you can get all-you-can-drink floats.  How cool is that?\n\nI love their iced tea.  All I drink when I go out is iced tea and Red Robin has some of the best out there.\n\nUgg.. i feel like going there for lunch now .  Damn you Red Robin!!

Good, strong drinks and good beer selection. Casual friendly service. The list goes on and on.  I've been coming here for years.  I even think this was the first stop on my 21st birthday celebration many moons ago . . . YIKES!  \n\nThey have lots of TVs for the sports fans.  I will happily come here to \"watch the game\" because I know that I'm not going to have to sacrifice getting a good meal.  There are even healthy options if that's my goal for the day.\n\nI love the daily drink and quesadilla specials! There are usually 4-5 drinks on special every day, plus a beer of the month, and already great prices on everything else.  The daily specials food menu ensures there is always something new on the menu for the regulars. \n\nThe Buffalo Chicken Lavosh is fantastic (see pic), however I don't advise eating it alone, even the \"half\" size is huge!  The salads are good; and I am picky about my salads!  Chicken sandwiches are great.  Sliders are legit.  Wings are some of the biggest and best around!  Gyros are tasty with the nice soft pita bread.  They have vegetarian options too!  Oh, and breakfast!  I wasn't kidding, the list does go \"on and on!\"\n\nA few other details, Teak's has a great juke box and a semi-separate room next door for families or big groups, it's a little less bar-ish.

Want a crap load of peanuts? No seriously, when you walk in there is a huge bushel of peanuts, and you can get as much as you want! Done with the shells? Just leave them on the table then brush them aside. The end result? A restaurant with peanut shells all over the place. Actually, to be quite honest, I'm being a little harsh here. I thought it was cool that they did this unlimited free peanuts thing, but it was like they were trying to compensate for something else.\n\nWell, when I got my food I figured out what they were trying to compensate for. The salad and 'breadsticks' were just plain bad. However, I didn't really expect much. I was actually hoping my wings would be good and that the salad was just a side. The wings are nothing special at all. I thought the 'El Hefe' wings were somewhat decent, but I don't think I could have more than a half-dozen of those. Hot wings? What hot wings? I thought I ordered some, but maybe the waiter got confused. I got some cold wings with red sauce on them, they tasted 'vinegary' and that's about all.\n\nTo be fair, the service was pretty good and the server was friendly. She was helping us make decisions since it was our first time, but the food was cold on multiple occasions. A previous reviewer mentioned gorgeous staff... Not quite sure why you would prefer that instead of good food, go to a strip club? Maybe if the food was hot it could be different, but I really doubt it since the recipes here are just way off the mark.\n\nThere is really nothing special about this place. The wings are over priced for what you get, and there is better stuff available 5 minutes away from here. I love wings, and I've been trying so hard to find a good wing place in Phoenix, but I think my search continues for the time being.", "business_id": "7-4FxYXhNUS2lhpUb_q5-w", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-11-07", "type": "review"}

A friend of mine had told me about their wings and how good they were.  I told him I like HOT and he said that I would love this place for their suicide wings.  When we walked in I first noticed the peanut shells all over the floor and the buckets of peanuts on the tables, \"Cool I can make a mess and not get yelled at!\"  We sat down and the waitress came right over to us with menus and took our drink orders.  She was the only waitress there for the first half of our visit and she didn't miss a beat even though there were about five other tables, unfortunately I can't remember her name, but it was a very unusual name.  My girlfriend and I both order the suicide wings and we were not at all disappointed.  The flavor was great!  They were extremely hot, but not enough to kill the chicken flavor and they didn't have that vinegary \"sauce-out-of-the-bottle\" taste that many wings have.

The service is normally friendly but very spotty sometimes I can get a refill, other times it's hard as reading the Grapes of Wrath. By know you're asking why do I even bother? The wings here are just that Damn good! I've had most of the flavors but my favorites are the Jeffe and original hot. The wings are always hot, crispy and saucy (well the ones that are supposed to be)! The salads are nothing to write about but nicely pair with the wings to help cut the fat. The last time I went I had the Zucchini chips and they were hot and crispy yet void of any real flavor, I had to immediately dunked them in  ranch for any satisfaction.

Let me elaborate. \n\nI had read great things about the Prickly Pear sandwich from Yelp, so when I found myself in Gilbert (which I do about three times a month for work) and didn't want fast food, I decided to stop by Flancer's and put in an order. My sandwich plus drink and tip came to around $9. The guy who took my order was really welcoming. I stood back, read the local Gilbert newspaper (apparently, it's a really happening place!), and waited approximately 10-15 minutes for my sandwich to be done. \n\nWhen I went outside to eat my sandwich and unwrapped the foil, I had I came upon a sight that was terrifying, to say the least. My chicken was BRIGHT pink. Oy vey--salmonella city! It took me a good 30 seconds to realize that the prickly pear sauce had turned the chicken a nice rosy shade. Now that my appetite was already a bit soured, I bit into the sandwich. The flavor of the chicken was a bit sugary for my taste, and the green chile mayo didn't have much of a kick. The bread was really crusty and delicious, but overall, I think the sandwich was more hype than substance. \n\nI may be back if I'm in Gilbert and again, find myself not willing to settle for fast food, but I'll probably try a different sandwich!", "business_id": "JMOK_Sy6aSOZwd4qgkX7hg", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-11-21", "type": "review"}

There's also more than 50 mostly four and five star reviews on Yelp. And  the Arizona Republic gave it a glowing review in September. After our lunch, I can tell you that Ken and I heartily agree with all the praise.\n\n     Flancer's is a small, unpretentious place. The menu is basically bar food - wings, salads, sandwiches, pizza, and some pasta. What made it worth our 30 minute drive is the care and thought that goes into the preparation. Jeff Flancer, the owner, is a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America. When he gives you a steak sandwich, its a \nfilet mignon sandwich ($10.75), tender and cooked to order - and served on a freshly baked homemade roll. With caramelized onions and house made chipotle mayo that has the perfect amount of kick. Oh, and gorgonzola cheese, too. Accompanied with an interesting choice of sides, like jalapeno & cheddar mashed potato pie or sweet potato fries. Ken says that Jeff knows what people like to eat, then he thinks of a way to improve on it. Like the onion soup ($3/5) that has a ton of cheese on top, not the thin slice that lots of places try to get away with these days. The pastrami in Ken's \"Cure Heaven\" sandwich (every item on the menu has a name) was very flavorful, served hot with provolone and mustard ($8). Portions are large, but not overwhelming. The only disappointment was the pickle - not bad, but not up to the level of the rest of the meal.\n\n     For nine years, Jeff had a restaurant in Santa Fe. There are a number of dishes using a variety of chilis, like the Santa Fe BLT ($8) that comes with New Mexican green chili mayonnaise. Or the Baked Chipotle Fettuccini (Jeff's spelling) ($11): \"Baked fettuccini with sausage, pepperoni & ground beef with chipotle cream marinara sauce & melted mozzarella cheese\". An appetizer I have to try is Flancer's Green Chile Mushroom Phyllos ($7.50).\n\n     Something that shines through at Flancer's is pride in the staff (our waiter was excellent), and caring for the community. On the website there are pictures and bios of many of the staff members. If you order a particular dessert, proceeds are donated to a youngster from the community who needs a heart transplant. There are raffles and a yearly pizza eating contest with proceeds also going to charity. The vibe here is really good. \n\n     Flancer's is open daily from 10:30 to 9 PM, with Happy Hour from 3 - 7 (they serve a Prickly Pear Lemonade spiked with vodka that sounds really good). There's free wi-fi, and on some nights there's music. Check out the menu on their website.", "business_id": "JMOK_Sy6aSOZwd4qgkX7hg", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-10-16", "type": "review"}

It's just a dip.\n\nBut then, there are the things that are not so good.  The baked potato soup we had last night was not good at all.  OK on the consistency of the soup, but it tasted like it was almost scorched and only had 3 small potatoes.  I don't know if the intention was to be more like a bisque, but usually when I have potato soup it has chucks of potato in it.  And I think the temp was too high, and/or ours came from the bottom of the pot, because it had a hint of a scorched flavor.  My husband ordered the veggie side with the BLT and it was over half onions.  We've had a soggy pizza from them before too.\n\nI think they could improve their beer selection a little for marketing the fact that they have a good beer selection.  Usually it's a couple of local stand-bys and then they get something else on a rotating selection.  Last night it was New Belgium's Ranger IPA which we tried and was ok, but there are usually a limited number of choices.  To me if you're going to promote that you have a good beer selection you have a lot of choices.  You don't have to be Boulders on Broadway or Papago Brewing, but I don't know, maybe 8 or 10 would be nice instead of 4 or 5.  Shock Top is not a craft beer, and the choices of Bud Light, Coors Light, Miller Lite, and Michelob Ultra remind me of an old joke about what do having sex in a canoe and light beer have in common?   There's a prickly pear lemonade that's pretty good, but really, the only reason we went last night was to burn up a Groupon.  \n\nI don't know how often I'd go back.  Right now the construction around Gilbert and Guadalupe is very annoying, but I don't hold that against the restaurant.  They just seem to be a little inconsistent and I don't like the claustrophobic feel of this location.  There also have always been a lot of loud kids when we have been there.  Maybe in the future I'll just get a BLT to go and be extremely happy with that.", "business_id": "JMOK_Sy6aSOZwd4qgkX7hg", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-10-08", "type": "review"}

It was dry, tasteless and crunchy, and the condiments (tomato, lettuce, onion) tasted old and wilted.

Ketchup, mustard, hot sauce (sweet and peppery), onions, relish, dill pickle spears, pickled peppers and onions, sauerkraut, chili, and nacho cheese are all available.\n\nBut the most important thing you have to know is that they ONLY TAKE CASH.

I have to tell you, the staff seemed practically excited to see us! After hours! It was a nice change from the usual huffing and puffing I've gotten from similar trips to other restaurants. They were very welcoming and chatty, asking about our night and offering suggestions for our feast, even delivering some items straight to our tables. Service at its best, honestly wonderful.\n  I've always really enjoyed Ted's dogs, last night I got two regular dogs, one with chili, cheese, and onions, the dog was grilled perfectly with a little snap to it and the chili was slightly sweet with a perfect kick to it, and the other had just their signature hot sauce (a spicy relish) and was just wonderful, I don't even like relish but it was sweet and spicy and tangy... just great.\n  This trip has made me even more of a believer, no wonder Ted's has been a Tempe staple FOREVER!

It sucks they don't offer any condiments for their boca burger and even the sweet potato fries didn't come with the sweet sour sauce they say it does...
