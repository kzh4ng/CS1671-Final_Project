I wish they would drop the cover charge down or at least offer some drink specials! \n\nThe bar has its own set of problems: I just hate spending $40 on drinks and not even getting a buzz out of it. It's hard enough to tell the bartender what you want over the music, but it's even harder when everything you ask for they don't have (or maybe they think they don't have it because they can't hear me?) Mind you I'm not picky or difficult, I just expect the bartender to know how to make the drink I want or at least stock  2 of the 3 beers I'm asking for.\n\nSolution for the Yelper: If you can, drink before you go.\n\nSeating: Maybe, just maybe, invest in another velvetine sectional or two. Club Pallazzo certainly charges enough for cover to afford a new couch. I like to rest my pretty feet after I'm done dancing and people watch, and maybe I don't feel like going on the patio.\n\nThe Ambiance: The inside is gorgeous. It's definitly the atmosphere that brings all the boot-stomping night owls out en masse. The frescoes on the walls and ceiling sport scantily clad vampiresses looking for a bite, and the velvet curtains that hang from the ceiling to the floor, along with the throne chairs give the club it's regal aire.\n\nThe Music: It's true, they have different DJ's switch off sets. The DJ I like also DJ's at Le Homme on Wed. nights. If I don't like what's playing I head outside for fresh air on the ample patio. But overall the music is good. \n\nI know some people that go every weekend. If I did that, I would be living in the alleyway behind Tranz.

Quite simply, there's a small bar to the left, a small VIP lounge to the right, and nothing but dance-able space in between. With a high ceiling, liberal use of bright neon blues, mirror'd-shiny surfaces, and sleek furniture, the atmosphere is energetic and cool.\n\nThe DJ, perched in a second floor booth overlooking the dancefloor, played track after track of Hip-Hop, for the most part. [From reading other reviews, I'm not sure Hip-Hop/R&B is part of the regular format. We'd been there the first week of Oct'09.] And so, the girls (Esco, RB, Becca), all talented and passionate dancers, took to the floor, wowing and attracting a perimeter of onlookers.  I danced a bit, broken ankle be darned: it'd take more than crutches to keep me from having a good time with my peeps...\n\nAs I sat for a minute, resting the cast'd ankle, a group of people complimented the girls on their style and dancing; very friendly, flattering gesture.\n\nBy 3AM, it was almost exclusively the 6 of us still on the dance floor being silly, and though we could have danced more, we had liquor at the apartment where the club had made last call around 2am.\n\nFun night and a fun little spot, but I'd suggest going with a group; friendly as people were, I'm not sure how apt this scene is to mingling/meeting/dancing with others. We had smilingly and genuinely asked a group of people watching us (the crew that complimented the girls on their dancing) to join us on the floor, but they didn't.\n\nIf its not your speed, there are two other clubs literally next door.\nAs we left, we noticed Club Downtown next door was *still* poppin'.\n__________________________\nSmoothest \"I got hit on\" moment ever.\nCan't be simply re-told, only re-enacted.", "business_id": "SiwN7f0N4bs4ZtPc4yPgiA", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-11-27", "type": "review"}

For once, I was ready to go bright and early so that we could make the six-hour drive before the holiday weekend traffic got to be too terrible. My car, unfortunately, had other plans.  The battery, which I had purchased less than a month prior, decided it didn't want to work.  We suspected it was a bad connection to the terminal but couldn't be sure. Instead of driving to Checker Auto, I decided to take the car a couple blocks away to Virginia Auto.  I have a few friends who regularly take their vehicles here for service, so even though I had never utilized their serviced, I felt confident about taking my car in.\n\nAt 8am, their small lot was already packed, and I snagged the only available spot.  We walked in and were helped right away.  The very nice lady at the desk asked if I'd made an appointment ahead of time and I explained our situation.  She said they had quite a few other cars in with appointments but she would see what she could do.  We sat inside the small lobby and chatted for a while before she came back in.  My brand new battery was dead.  It had been completely drained!  She said they could put the battery back in and we could go back to Checker to have it replaced or they could install a new battery for me.  Not wanting to take a chance on another bad battery, I decided to have them take care of it for me.  Not more than 20 minutes later, they had finished!  I wasn't thrilled about having to pay more than I wanted to, but it was worth every penny.  After we got to Texas that afternoon, my very car-savvy Dad looked at the  car and said the battery had been installed very well - it was in securely and everything had been cleaned up really well.\n\nI need some serious maintenance done on the car, and I will absolutely be taking it in to Virginia Auto.  As soon as I do, I have no doubt I'll be coming back to this review to change it from a 4-star to a 5-star review.\n\nThank you, thank you, thank you, Virginia Auto, for taking such great care of me and my car and allowing us to head out of town for a few days without worrying about my car!", "business_id": "M-MFa0YErVBbFW2IJhGJmw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-09-07", "type": "review"}

It was a 30 minute drive from Laveen, as all are the Thai places in the area.  I ordered two of my staples (Tom ka Gai soup and Green Curry) and tried a new dish (for me), Holy Basil.  I got everything takeout.\n\nI'll start with the Holy Basil.  It was very good.  A nice balance of Thai flavors, and I thought it was quite similar to an Ayam Basil dish I used to get at a Malaysian place in Mt. View, CA.  My only complaint was that the chicken was big, thick chunks, like a fajita-style.  I expect delicate, tender meats at a high end Thai place.\n\nI opened my green curry and said: \"WHERE'S THE SAUCE\"?  I am VERY upset at the lack of sauce.  There was so little I can't comment on the flavor of the curry.  And, they had 2 different types of green beans in there:  chinese long beans, and American green beans.  The larger Amercian green beans weren't cooked.  That sucked.  The beef was tender enough but the peices were too big.  The one redeeming part of this dish was the fact that they had eggplant in it.  There is something about eggplant in green curry....\n\nThe Tom Ka Gai soup was  fantastic.  My only complaint would be the chicken, which again, was large fajita-style slices.   Doesn't make sense to me.\n\nWhile I was waiting at the bar for my order, I remember looking into the kitchen and wondering how they could possibly prepare everything on the menu in that tiny space.  Now, I think I know:  I suspect they prep all of their meats ahead of time and use the same size/shape/cuts for each dish to save time.  This results in a fajita-style cut of chicken that leaves me less than thrilled.\n\nOverall, the menu is brief and the food is good, but I don't think it's worth a long drive.  I don't expect to return when I could make the same drive to get to Swadee, which was just fabulous.  I gave this place a 3/5 because the Tom Ka Gai soup and Holy Basil were VERY good.  I am however disappointed in the green curry, the  cuts of meat, and by the way they completely ignored my request for Thai spicy; everything was rather mild in my opinion.", "business_id": "KPoTixdjoJxSqRSEApSAGg", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-11-08", "type": "review"}

It's an adventure.\n\nWild Thaiger offers some of my favorites that are not to be found at Thai Basil (so mediocre) and Thai Elephant (good but standard) - Dragon's Eggs are a spin on Kanom Jeeb, thai pork and crab dumplings similar to shu mai, graced with a spicy slice of raw jalapeno on top.  Decha Boar celebrates the not often served wild boar in a peppery sauce of basil and telicherry peppercorns.  They understand that pepper can be flavorful in addition to hot, and there's a whole taste profile there just waiting for you to explore.  Best of all, the presentation on the dishes is a work of art - ribbons of carrots and beets as edible garnishes remind you of what a treat it should be to dine out.\n\nIf you are looking for standard Thai, without flair or panache, I could see how this might be seen as too expensive.

If you don't love Pad Thai, it's probably because you haven't tried Wild Thaiger's.  :)  Seriously, this is one of the best dishes I've found in Phoenix.\n\nTheir other dishes are consistently good as well.

Wild Thaiger, on the other hand, has a filling Peanut Chicken lunch, as well as a Peanut Passion dinner, both drenched in their delicious peanut sauce.  Their curries are very flavorful and make for a superb and hearty dinner, but if you're going for lunch, you may want to consider Thai Basil up the road as their curry lunch combo includes a salad and other extras.\n\nTheir Thai Tea is strong yet creamy, just like it should be, and you can even add boba to it.  A must if you're eating anything spicy.\n\nThe service is very professional and timely.  The atmosphere is pretty classy, in fact, it's probably the nicest-looking Thai restaurant I've been to.

My friend and I went to check out the \"Wine Down Wednesday\" special, which means you can get any international wines for only $5 per glass (this is a great deal as they have some pretty awesome wines). \n\nAs for food last night, we shared an app and entree. We started with the Island Crab, which is a crispy shell with crab meat on top - like a deconstructed wonton type of thing, only better! I love the fact that you can see and taste huge delicious chunks of crab, instead of the typical 95% cream cheese filling in most crab wontons. Awesome. For our 'entree' we had a special for the evening that was Thai Sausage and vegetables. It was yummy, and I was even afraid to 'dive in' because the presentation was gorgeous! \n\nIn previous experiences here I've had Pad Thai, Holy Basil Chicken, Peanut Passion and Beef Mangone. All of them were awesome, beautifully presented and my personal favorite... tasted FRESH! I love that every time I've been here the food has been consistently awesome. Fresh flavors, enough spice to taste (you can pick your level on most items), great flavor combos without going overboard - I like that you can taste all the different ingredients instead of having them masked by one or two overpowering flavors. \n\nLast night I had the privilege of meeting the owner, Olashawn. She's an awesome woman with a passion for what she does, and one of the most down-to-earth people I've ever met. If you go in, make sure to give her a wave, you'll see her behind the counter and behind the line, cooking and working just as hard if not harder then everyone else.", "business_id": "KPoTixdjoJxSqRSEApSAGg", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-09-05", "type": "review"}

She repeatedly asked us where we would like to sit, or how many people were in our party, and then she would walk away while we answered or disregard that we had answered her at all. It was like she was incapable of absorbing information. We finally got seated. The table behind us very loudly cancelled their order paid for their drinks and left stating that the service taking too long. The writing was on the wall.

We ordered an appetizer at the same time as our drinks, the appetizer took 45 minutes to arrive, the waiter forgot that we had ordered anything at all, came back to the table to confirm the appetizer TWICE and still brought us the wrong item and then had the nerve to charge us for it! I asked for menu suggestions, the waiter just stared at me blankly. I asked if I could have steamed rice rather than fried, he said that was impossible to change. Impossible. Eventually our entrees came, I ordered soup, it wasn't good. He brought out a teacup for me to use as my soup bowl. It was almost impossible to manage. Then our check came, he overcharged us. I didn't dispute anything because I just wanted to leave. I paid in cash, he shorted me five dollars. I called that his tip, and left. \nThe restaurant was not busy, it was typical for a Wednesday night. There is no excuse for their wait times or rudeness.

Personally, I've been to Wild Thaiger at every time of day with every friend & family member I know who eats Thai, even my 91-year-old English grandmother who loves it! Their food is legit Thai cooking. If you understood how Thai is made, you'll know why they can't change heat levels, & I really wish you could eat those hotter dishes because they're very flavorful. If, however, you can't take the spiciness, then pay attention to the menu or ask your server about the heat in the dish you're eyeing--stay below 2-stars. Try yellow curry if you're looking for mild, maybe get satay or noodle dishes like Pad Thai or Pad Siew. They have several options below 2-star, as far as I recall (I don't know because I always get curries & usually don't look at the menu anymore). If you really like Thai, Wild Thaiger is unparalleled in the Valley, IMHO! It's very casual, & people are always friendly.\n\nAs for food, they have several good starters, but my favorite is the Satay Sampler. The peanut sauce is gorgeous, but if you get the Satay, ask for the \"chutney,\" which I know as Adjat: rice vinegar, simple syrup, onion, cucumber, & Thai chili peppers, a flavor combo so good I often eat it straight out of the dish when we've finished the sampler. The Spring Rolls are a solid choice as well, light & delicate, &, if I remember correctly, can accommodate vegetarians, too.\n\nTheir Pad Thai is a standard, & if you don't like the peanuts go for the Pad Siew, which IMO is the best noodle dish on the menu anyway. The Pad Thai is very traditional & has great flavor. The Pad Siew is a wide noodle with a beautiful, rich sauce, traditional veggies, & your choice of meat (or no meat). They actually can accommodate vegetarian requests for many of the menu options, so Thai is often a favorite choice of vegetarians everywhere (just make sure your dish doesn't include fish sauce if you're a novice).\n\nAll their curries are incredible to me, some of the best I've had, including my own. If you're not into the heat, stick to the Yellow Curry. If you can take some heat, then go for the Green Curry, though I will add the caveat that the Green Curry can be hotter on some nights than it is on others. If you can really take some HEAT, then go as high as you like.\n\nThe Panang Beef is among my favorite dishes of all time anywhere (it can be made with other meats or tofu). It's definitely got kick, but the peanut flavored curry is out of this world. The Yellow Curry is beautifully delicate with layers of flavor, usually made like a stew with meat & potatoes. The Green Curry is exactly like I'd make it if I had the time to do my own paste like I used to, with Thai eggplant & that unique aromatic smell & hint of flavor that comes from the lime leaves.\n\nFor dessert, when they have it, I always try to indulge myself with some Mango Sticky Rice. It's made with just the right amount of sticky, perfectly sweet, & is topped with fresh mango slices. To drink, they have a full bar, a good selection of beers (including some Thai & other Asian offerings), a decent wine list, & the ever popular Thai Iced Tea, the classic Ceylon tea, very sweet, with milk or cream floated on top (I've never asked what kind of milk product they use, but it's as good as any I've had).\n\nIf you don't like curries then I don't know why you'd be going for Thai food, but they have several other offerings on the menu that don't use curry. If you walk in the door & are looking for someone to shower you with rose petals & kowtow, you'll be disappointed. However, if you come in & a hostess isn't at the door, walk in & make eye contact, maybe say, \"Hello!\" They'll take good care of you. I've been to Wild Thaiger literally dozens of times & have never had the kind of horror-show experiences some mention here! I've had to grab someone's attention from time to time, maybe ask for the check once or twice, but for the most part the service is good & the people are kind.\n\nIt's a small place. The outside is probably bigger than the inside, which in Phoenix is a little crazy, but they'll do their best to accommodate you with the staff they have on hand. If you live close enough or are downtown on your way home, you can always call & order take-out. I find their food to be just as good the next day (if not better) & I often enjoy leftovers straight out of the refrigerator if I can't wait 2 minutes for the microwave. If you can't enjoy their food in your own home, then maybe you just don't like Thai food because Wild Thaiger makes some of the best. I've probably been to every Thai joint in Arizona, as well as restaurants up & down California & in Seattle & Vancouver as well.

Also, by the time the food came out (3 plates at first and then another 10 minutes later) the food was luke warm. It seemed like they had plates ready but waited for the others to come out which made the rest of the food barely warm. \n\nOk on the upside, the presentation of the food was great! We ordered beef pad Thai, tropical chicken fried rice, yellow chicken curry and peanut chicken plate. They were all very good, but the temperature of the food down played it. It all tastes great. We were so Hungry after our softball tourney that we didn't want to send it back since it took so long in the first place. \n\nOverall it's pretty good Thai food. Service was good as well.

From rude staff to unpleasant odors or creepy guys giving you longing looks while you're just trying to figure out which one of your friends with an advanced degree in engineering you can text to help you figure out how to get on a machine without having it rip your arm out of its socket because the staff is not going help you without paying for a personal trainer or because you don't look like you were already born on a nautilus machine. \n\nThis gym is everything but. I went in because of the great introductory special and a recommendation of a friend. We're both training to swim the SF Bay for the 2011 Sharkfest Alcatraz Swim, so we needed a pool. \n\nAs soon you walk in, the guy at the front desk treats you like you're an old buddy and cracks jokes like he is your best bar buddy. Awesome attitude. The place has never been overly crowded (even at peak hours right after work. I've never gone during the early morning or lunch hours).\n\nNo waits on the machines and they have plenty of them. No waiting in the pool and even when there is a water aerobics class, one lane is left open to due laps. Hot tub, sauna, and some inexplicable walk in dunking tub (see, I'm not a gym aficionado or else I would know what that thing is for).\n\nTowel service, locks, and even gym shorts available. (no more using that excuse that you can't work out today because you left your work out clothes at home...they have some to check out there.)\n\nEven the seemingly cranky old lady doing her water workout was nice and called me sweetie and asked if I was ok when I inadvertently let out a puppy like whimper as my shoulder blades decided they wanted to cede from the union of my body. Note to self....don't do a month of the P90X with a friend, think you're hot stuff and on your way to a gym bod and then jump in a pool to do a mile swim without stretching because you think you're all that now. Had it not been for Grandma Water Aerobics, I might still be at the far end of the pool trying to inch my way back to the stairs hoping that the water on my face hid the tears that were going start gushing any minute if I couldn't make it to the hot tub to get my back to stop seizing up.  (Thank you, unknown Water Aerobics lady. You turned a moment of shame into motivation. Oh yeah, I will out swim grandma next time!)\n\nThe place is in the basement of an office building next to the seemingly abandoned Chateaux on Central development. Central and....Encanto (?) \nYou can park on the street (careful of the meters) or use the garage. The gym validates. \n\nThere is a downstairs weight room (I haven't check it out yet as I because there is a free gym at my job.) Yes, I like this place so much, I am paying for a gym membership even though I have access to work out facilities for free in my own building....including free personal trainer....but instead I get in my car come 5pm and drive to a gym I pay for because this athletic club is worth it. \n\nI saw no young kids running around. The clientele seems to be early  30s and up, young urban professionals and some retirees who are just trying to stay healthy. No creepy people ogling you (which you may be looking for) and no rude gym bunnies laughing at you in your leotard on the treadmill....but really....you shouldn't have the leotard and hot pink leg warmers on anyway...it is 2010.

Usually, Safeway is my favorite place to shop. Over the years, i have had countless wonderful experiences at various Safeway's across the state. And I have been known to express my love for Safeway numerous times in public. I don't know how it's possible for a manger to screw up a grocery store more than this. Doesn't corporate come by every once and a while? \n\nI am grateful to read that I\"m not the only one with this impression. Every time I go, they're out of something. And I\"m not talking about Peruvian Wild Goats Milk or some other obscure specialty food. I\"m talking basics. Bread, milk, soda.\n\nBut my main issue is their Signature Sandwich Deli. It is atrocious. A few years ago, I remember people would be lined up to get their sandwiches here. Not anymore. The service is incredibly slow, the sandwiches are made poorly and there is always something missing, or low. And getting a bin refilled seems to be a monumental task, so it just doesn't get done. Today, they hadnt' refilled the artichokes. When I asked for artichokes, instead of refilling it and giving me artichokes, the guy behind the counter took the artichoke JUICE and dribbled it on my sandwich, making it impossible to eat without a fork and spoon later. I just don't ever recall that a sandwich required silverware. \n\nThe time prior, I went and they were out of tomatoes. Huh? IT\"S A GROCERY STORE! Walk over to the produce and pick up a tomato!\n\nThe time before that, I just wanted a chilled Coke. Sounds simple. Popular brand. Large grocery chain. What could possibly go wrong? Well, for one, they hadn't stocked the refrigerators by the registers. When I inquired about getting a coke, the staff looked at the cooler that had 2 Dr. Peppers left and asked me, \"Well, do you want a Dr. Pepper?\"\n\"NO! I want a Coke.\" \n\nNo matter what I go there for, I can't seem to get out of the store without some type of issue. But sadly, it's the closest store to my downtown office. \n\nRegardless, if you have a choice, skip this Safeway, there are plenty of others that will win you over.", "business_id": "7Z7IkR_-94AjUuDw0fbI7g", "stars": 1, "date": "2008-11-17", "type": "review"}

During peak hours, they have very few lanes open, that is a consistent failure with this store. Customer service is also dead here, and they just don't know how to take care of customers. I feel as though the broken window theory is at play here. It seems like because they don't take care of the parking lot, and other details, the whole place goes to hell. The store also has a serious shoplifting problem. I'm not sure if they just don't staff the loss prevention unit, or if they are inept, but I have seen at least four episodes where a cashier is confronting a thief. It makes for an unsafe situation for everyone. They do have private security there, and the guys seem really nice, but clearly in over their heads. At this point the store is so far gone, they really need off-duty police officers to make it safe.\n\nIt really seems like this store just doesn't give a shit.

My most recent visit was last night. We skipped the appetizer only because we had tickets to a show but not to worry because the complementary chips and salsa are outstanding! You don't even need the salsa as the chips are seasoned, fresh and uniquely delicious. Husband had the chicken quesadilla and inhaled it before I could try it but he loved it. I was torn between the Stuffed Chicken and the Spinach and Portobello quesadilla. I had (and loved) the chicken dish my last visit so I went with the spinach and mushroom quesadilla which was wonderfully simple and delicious with a fresh and tasty salad on the side. We didn't have time for dessert but again, not to worry as the complementary white chocolate nibble they serve at the end of the meal hits the spot. Next time we come to Sam's we will hopefully have more time for appetizer and dessert.

Towards the end of the meal, manager Nicole dropped by the table to ask how the meal was and we enjoyed talking with her. She was very knowledgable about the city and the restaurant which I was surprised to find has a sister cafe in my town (St. Louis). I thought the food was good but not amazing.

You must go and you MUST have the chips and salsa...YUM!\n\nThen, dinner.  And it was fast and delicioso!  I had the Black and Blue quesidilla and my partner had a pork dish and holy cramoly...amazing.  Not only was the service fabulous and fast, but the attention to detail was truly surprising AND, did I mention the food was fantastic!\n\nThen we met up with Nicole - manager extraordinaire and a really nice person to socialize with during dinner.  She came over and asked how our dinner was going and then shared stories of her experiences with us and what's cool (and not so cool) about Phoenix.  Always great to hear it direct from a local . . . thanks Nicole, you made our evening really special.\n\nAnd then finally, after all was said and done, our waitress Sally brought these little corn-husk wrapped fingerlings of vanilla infused white-chocolate with pecans encrusted throughout.  Seriously...just shoot me!\n\nI'd give Sam's a 10 star rating, but then again, this is my first time reviewing a restaurant so, it's a pleasure to start off my Yelp career with such a great and wonderful place.  PLUS, there's a Canyon Cafe' restaurant (parent company of Sam's) about 10 minutes from my house in St. Louis so as soon as I get back home, I'd headed there for more fun and food.\n\nThanks Sam's...WOW!", "business_id": "e5kc0CQ4R-PCCDgb274gSg", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-10-17", "type": "review"}

Sitting outside on the patio under the gorgeous sparkling lights on the palm trees, with the sound of the running water in the fountains nearby, in the heart of Central Phoenix.  It didn't even matter at that point if the food was good!   \n\nI've been back several times since and this place doesn't disappoint.  However, I would rank ambiance #1, alcohol #2 and food #3.  Drink choices are widely ranging so everyone will find something.   From your traditional margarita to a cocktail, the drinks are strong and well made.  As for the food, I've had a few dishes I liked - the black and bleu quesadilla and the fajitas tend to be my go-to.  I love the salsa too - it's a chipotle, smoky flavor - my favorite kind!   Best little treat is a white chocolate dessert served in a corn husk at the end of the meal.   Great little inclusion!   \n\nThis is located in the Arizona Center by the AMC movie theater, so makes it easy for a great dinner and movie night.

You want to unwind at the end of the day with your colleagues, have a leisurely discussion of what you've been conferencing about, and enjoy regional cuisine without wallet-breaking prices or concerns that \"authentic\" might verge into \"scary.\" GO HERE.\n\n1. It is within walking distance of your hotel, with a lovely view of a garden.\n\n2. The chips are amazing. Think \"professional chef reimagines Doritos\" for portions of them, but there are also normal tortilla chips and blue corn tortilla chips.\n\n3. The drinks are exceedingly drink-like, with none of that pesky margarita-mix taste. Order something with prickly pear juice in it.\n\n4. In sporadic meals during my years in Arizona, I've never had service that was other than charming. It's possible YMMV if you hit a huge rush, but if they're not jammed, you should feel very happy and pampered.\n\n5. The white-chocolate tamale at the end of the meal is perfect if you want a little something sweet but weren't up for dessert.\n\nOrder lots of plates to share among your group because... the food ranges from amazing to meh, and I'd swear sometimes the same dish has been both amazing and meh on different trips. (I'm certain I had the Pablo's enchiladas with a totally exciting salad and very subtle flavors on a past trip, when it was more \"well, that's an enchilada, can't argue with that\" the most recent time.) The good news is that I've never had a dish be worse than meh, and even the meh-est experience was pretty good for the first two or three bites... so if you have a bunch of dishes and are taking a couple bites of each, the odds are strongly in your favor that you'll generally be very happy.\n\nIf that method doesn't work for you, I've had good experience with the carnitas so far. There was also a very pleasant Easter brunch. You're paying about normal street prices, maybe a couple bucks above Macayo's, for enchilada-type meals (and the quality is way better, even on meh days) and $17-$20 for serious entrees.\n\nIn any case, you're really here to converse and drink and nibble chips as evening falls across the artificial pond, which experience they do exceedingly well here.\n\nETA: if you visit on a really cold, sunless day, bundle up!

The majority of the laughs were in the first half of the play, but as a whole very amusing, entertaining, great performances and solid writing. It made for a fun start to our Saturday night.\n\nLike most theaters, symphony halls, performance centers, etc., they serve coffee, beer, wine and a few select liquors, which must be consumed before entering the actual theater. Likewise, I love the fact that one can purchase drinks (wine for us) for the intermission and the drinks will be poured and waiting for you without standing in line again. Bonus, considering the intermission may be your only opportunity for a restroom break.\n\nThe chairs are very comfortable within the theater and there really is not a bad seat in the house, considering it is a very small theater. I have two complaints, though, which are totally fixable in which case I would easily rank this theater 5 stars...\n\n1) The temperature was very pleasant outside, between say 60 and 65 degrees. Inside, however, we were sweating. It wasn't a dripping sweat but if you choose to \"dress up\" to go to the theater, you might be uncomfortable, as we were.\n\n2) My second complaint is about the website and the frustration in navigating around to find seating charts that don't suck. Right now it's a crappy, what they consider, 3D seating chart that when clicked on will show you the available seats. The problem is, it doesn't work very well. It's just not clear. It's sad when you google seating charts for the theater and ticket brokers have a better seating diagram than the theater itself. So do yourself a favor and do what I did, find a good seating chart and call the box office. It's quicker and you know exactly what you're getting.\n\nMy thoughts on the best seats....the floor seats seem to be good and close. But I chose mezzanine  because I like the looking-down view. If you do choose one of the balconies, I recommend in front of the stage and the 1st row. If you sit on either side of the stage, you'll inevitably end up leaning forward in your seat and resting your elbows on the ledge in front of you to get the best view, doesn't seem that comfy. And I say front row because we sat center stage on the second row and my friend had a hard time seeing over or around the big hair in front of her. Just saying.\n\nGreat experience overall. Small venue, has a laid back feel to it with some folks choosing to dress to the 9's while others were comfortably wearing jeans. I'll be keeping my eye out for other plays that might interest me, as I will certainly return to this theater.", "business_id": "RA2EuX04SHqmayKpLhpNvA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-11-14", "type": "review"}

I was hanging out at home when I got the call to hang out with this guy for a low key night.  I had to remind him it was Monday Night Football and the NLDS game of Phillies v. Rockies.  So he suggests we hit up Majerle's, which I'm down for because it means more sport watching and less talking.\n\nSo I find my way down here, and say screw it to paying for parking.  After the whole $20 to park at Westgate, I'm down to take my chances at getting a parking ticket.  It's ridiculous how much the city makes off of parking, parking tickets, and the ever illustrious DUIs.\n\nAnyways, I go into Majerle's, completely ignored by the hostess out front.  Glad to know she's getting paid $8.50 to not talk to anyone and act pretty...  Settle down at the bar and order a Blue Moon, because it's a Monday, it's football, it's baseball, and I'm preparing for another laborious date.\n\nHalfway through my beer my date arrives.  Which wouldn't be cool, but I need to get good and drunk so I deal.  He automatically decides we need to get wings.  Thanks for deciding...because I have no thoughts of my own.  Apparently him being a gentleman meant he would talk shit on the wings I wanted, then reluctantly give in to getting the boneless buffalo wings.  Which are $5 along with four other appetizers during their 4-8 pm happy hour.  Good deal there!\n\nThe wings come out within 15 minutes or so and they look...odd.  It looks like someone sliced tofu and lightly fried them, then dipped them in excessive amounts of sauce.  Definitely not the most appetizing item to look at.  I wished they looked better, because then I wouldn't have the hippie making fun of me the whole time.  They tasted okay, but the look alone was too much of a turn off to enjoy.\n\nThe bartender disappeared after we ordered the wings, so we spent some time waiting for her to discover us again so we could order our entree.  Oh how I wished she had taken our order earlier.  I had to listen to the douche hippie talk smack on the Angels and how people die all the time so Adenhart's death didn't matter.  Yeah...that deserved a total smack in the face.  Or complete beat down.  Don't ever hate of my Angels or commit blasphemy against Adenhart.  I will not stand for that, especially if I've had a few drinks in me.\n\nAnyways, so I eventually order the veggie wrap with chicken and he gets the chicken parmesan.  Not too much time passes, so I could enjoy the flat screens and watch the Dolphins show Mark Sanchez how to play a real football game.  The wrap comes, and it's huge!  I enjoyed the fruit salad of pineapple and grapes.  And the actually spinach tortilla and veggies were good, but the chicken just dragged the wrap down.  It was so bland and tasteless.  I wish I would have just gone pure veggie.\n\nI had a couple rounds of beer after that, just to pass the time until the Dolphins could be declared the official winners.  Conversation came and went with the people at the bar, far more interesting than the person I was with.  The beers came and went, and soon it was time to peace out.  When I saw the tab, I was glad I didn't have to pay.  $60+ to \"enjoy\" conversation with a tool and overpriced food and drinks.

I really covet being wowed, I like being pleasantly surprised, and I can have a perfectly merry day with a run of the mill meal. Unfortunately, there are some experiences that don't fit in to any of my \"I will return again and again or at least recommend to friends\" template.\n \n Majerle's is one of those experiences.\n\nI know that I should definitely give this place another try but only because I had such a bad time I think that it must have been entirely abnormal because it would be out of business if it was run this way daily.\n When I arrived on Sunday afternoon (right as the Cardinals game was about to start), there were several content tables already enjoying their beer and bar fare. I must say that the food wasn't terrible. I wouldn't classify it as anything special or something that I would crave on any particular day. But the wings were crisp, the salad was fresh'ish' and the burger was prepared to the temp I ordered. This is where the one star came from. Decent food (good temp, tastes like what it's supposed to, sans hair, ect) deserves some credit.\n \n   If I could give negative stars for service, this would be a -5 Stars type of place. Our server was either hung over or was just entirely uninterested in doing ANYTHING that her job description calls for. She greeted us about ten minutes after we sat down (although it was a Cardinals game day, the bar was probably about half full). She took our drink order and returned with our drinks ages later (well, another almost ten minutes). I was starving and ready to order food but wasn't able to because she slammed the drinks on the table and left again. I flagged down another server and he was so kind as to send ours back. FINALLY I ordered. Again, the food was fine. It wasn't, however, fine enough to cancel out the fact that our appetizer was delivered 20 minutes laster followed IMMEDIATELY by our entree's. Ok. Fine. But, the salad was wrong the first time (Note: When your guests are ordering, it helps to listen to what they actually want. It is NOT a good practice to forget and then just 'guess' what they said). And our server didn't even deliver our food so we couldn't order another drink until we flagged her down again. We ordered another two beers and waited. And waited. And waited. I saw our beers sitting on the bar and our server chatting in the corner to another associate. We couldn't get her attention so my dining companion/boyfriend went to the bar himself to get them. In fact, we didn't see our server again for the rest of the meal. I was so irate at this point that I wanted to leave immediately and spend our Sunday afternoon football watching/beer drinking pennies elsewhere. I flagged down the same server I asked to find my server the first time and had him do my bidding again (he seemed to be working, why couldn't I have sat in HIS section?) She came over, mumbled some apology about having to get our own beers and dropped our check. \n  Bright points: They have a great tv set up for football watching. Multiple tv's tuned to every single game you could imagine. \nNot so Bright Points: For me, watching football at a sports bar has necessary accoutrements (steady flow of beer, timely delivery of food, ect) to make it enjoyable. This mark was completely missed due entirely to the complete disregard our server had for her job. Or her guests.\nDownright Dim points: Well, this review pretty much sums it up.\n If I'm in the area and kind of desperate, perhaps I'll try it again.

Boy was I wrong!  The wings were okay, but the chef really needs to work on his/her knife skills. I ordered the chicken sandwich with sprouts and avocado. It came without any other condiments. This was a problem since it was the driest piece of chicken I had EVER attempted to eat. Luckily the waitress hadn't cleared the wing plate and I was able to use the ranch to get 1/2 of my sandwich down. I would have returned it but our waitress had disappeared after my husband didn't order a second beer.\nSpeaking of my husband, he ordered a burger that also came without condiments. He waited patiently for 15 minutes for our waitress to reappear, finally asking some other server for mayo. She also refilled our drinks. When our waitress returned with the bill and to clear the dishes no apology was made for her lack of service nor were any questions asked about the food remaining on my plate.  I would have given it one star, but they have really cold beer and great thin fries. \nSo, remember if like something besides catsup on your sandwiches you'd better ask, and stay away from the chicken.", "business_id": "45puCRQ6Vh_IIAy7kkfFDQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-09-05", "type": "review"}

I'm a sucker for ghost stories, I'll admit it. \n\nWhen the boy and I decided to a day of wandering around Phoenix before making our way out to the Grand Canyon for a wedding, we had a hotel choice to make. There's a number of offerings downtown, and in August, let's face it,  not a whole lot of people are visiting this 107-degree town so the options in our budget range were pretty open. \n\nWhat got us to bypass the fancier, but on sale, hotels with their shiny lobbies, fake-scent-pumping ventilation systems and flat screen TVs? The idea that we might wake up to a bump in the night. \n\nAs the story goes, in 1928,  a woman, desperately in love  (and possibly preggers) with a bell boy from a neighboring hotel, took a flying leap from the roof and became a part of the hotel's history. Supposedly the room in which she stayed, 720, is still alive with her presence, as she plays with the TV and glides in shadows across the room. \n\nWe did a little ghost hunting while we stayed, though  Room 720 wasn't \navailable, we were still able to wander the 7th floor and take pictures of the hallways and stairs. Alas, there was no ghost sightings. \n\nNor did we hear the giggles of children who spent their days as students here when an Indian school occupied the property. \n\nHowever, the hotel was still fun, it was like taking a step back in time with pedestal sinks and mosaic floors.

Yes, old building, charm, history, cool, but in the heart of downtown Phoenix in this modern age, you can update your buildings to keep the old charm and still allow for the enjoyment of modern conveniences. A hotel is a customer service oriented business and the building itself is crucial to the customers experience. Our room was very small but ok, could be livable with the right amenities. Very few outlets so tough to charge up computers and phones. None in the Bathroom! None! So I had to blow my hair dry in the other room. The bathroom had a huge sink but zero counter space. So what was the counter put my toothpaste, make up, hairbrushes and such on while i got ready? A toilet seat. Yup. No counter in the bathroom. It had the charm of an old place with the type of tile but so much of the tile was chipped and the paint peeling away from the walls it just felt old and dirty and run down. The drain in the shower didn't work well and I was standing in several inches of water while I showered. No room to room AC so you were at the mercy of how cool the people at the hotel wanted to keep the place. In AZ its 100+ all the time. I bet our room at night was 77 degrees or more.

But this place is horrible. We came in a group of four, about 11:30 pm on Saturday the 24th. And it all started with the hostess. \n\nShe was not glad to see us first of all. I felt if we were bothering her by showing up. She was slow to seat us and walked like a sloth. \n\nAs we sat down we over saw a few waitresses talking about how one has no one or nothing to do and the other two telling her to just go find something to do. \n\nOur waitress came over after a good 5 to 7 minute wait. ( not any of the girls that where bickering from earlier.) we asked for water and that took a few more minutes. \n\nWe ordered our meals and I did asked for them to use sour dough bread instead of the regular bread for the double-double bacon BLT. \n\nThis must have really caused an issue in the kitchen. It took 45 minutes to get our order out. I looked around and saw other people leaving, some left half the bill in cash and took off. Waitresses bad talking customers and the manager yelling at them to pick up orders. Clean this and clear that table. I feel the Manager had no control.\n\nI was really angry at this time. I received half the portion as the same order, one of the people I was dining with. The sour dough change must have really been an issue. I only got half a sandwich!!! Half the bacon and lettuce !!! All I ask to change was the bread!!! \n\nBut it gets better. I asked for a side of fruit with my sandwich. I got two grapes, 2 two slices of orange and eight pieces of honey dew. Really eight!!! I had a bowl of honey dew. I eat my half sandwich,  two grapes and two slices of oranges. \n\nI could wait to leave. The bill was paid and we left. Not the best tip either.  Don't go here , drive to another IHOP. It's worth the it to leave.  The managers and staff all need to be fired and start over with all new crew.

DON'T GO HERE!! we came in about 2:45am after leaving a concert in the area and getting back to our car. We pull up to the parking lot which looks empty. We go in, there are about 10 tables of seated customers. At least 5 of them had no food and 4 of those didn't even have drinks yet. There is 1 couple waiting to be seated ahead of us. We wait about 20 minutes to be seated. The manager finally seats us at a dirt table for 6. There were only 2 of us and plenty of 2 person tables avail. We didn't complain. Another 15-20 minutes goes by. The manager comes back to us and see we haven't gotten drinks. He asks if we have even put in a drink order..nope. So he takes our drink order and send a waitress over with our drinks about 5 minutes later. Who bring us each our drink and a second drink each. (knowing she wouldn't be back in time to give us a refill) at this time we place our order. We wait and wait and wait for about 45 minutes. Many more people have arrived and been seated by this time but still there same 5 tables that didn't have food when we came in still had no food. So about an hour since we had been seated a waitress walked by and we asked her how much longer our food would be. She said it should be ready. We told her to just go ahead and box it up. By this point it was almost 4am and lots of obnoxious drunks being loud. She gladly said okay. About 10 minutes later she bring us our bags of food and says its on the house. We were so upset at the whole situation by this point but we nicely said thank you and left. Got back to our hotel to eat our cold food and none of it was even right. I don't know who's order we got but it wasn't ours. We attempted to eat some of it but it tasted horrible. No flavor just plain bland cold rubbery eggs and bacon.

Let me tell you, this place is legit.  #3, the service is always fast and friendly.  The only opportunity they have is with their Huevos Rancheros, im a fan of Rancheros but their Ranchero sauce was heavy on the tomato sauce and onion, I felt needed more complexity and adding in some Hatch or Anaheim long green would have made the sauce better.

Without reading any reviews, I decided to come have breakfast here. Although it was a full house, they had enough space to seat us promptly. We were greeted right away by a great waitress by the name of Catalina. She was very nice, attentive, and wasn't bothered at the fact that we kept ordering different things, she had a smile on her face the whole time and was extremely respectful. Even when she was walking by with food in her hands for another table, she never failed to ask us if we were ok, or if we needed anything. I haven't had such great service by a waitress in a very long time. They are so attentive that the moment we set our utensils down and were finished with out food, someone was already there picking up our empty dishes. I am so glad I came to this restaurant. They actually have a lot of seafood in all of there sea food dishes unlike most places nowadays. I was here with a party of 5. We all ordered something different. Everyone's food was DELICIOUS! I was highly impressed by the cleanliness and layout of this restaurant. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone. Very family oriented, respectful, and clean. \n\nI'm from California, I have visited so many restaurants both here and there, and it's been a very long time that I have actually been impressed by a restaurant. If I could rate more stars, I would! \n\n\nPs! \nWe had an extremely hungover friend (we had a wild night out) that didn't want to eat and felt sick to her stomach.

The beans and ride were both inedible.  the beans were overcooked and had a slightly burned flavor, with a layer or congealed cheese over the top.

Of course the serving size is generous, I usually make it a point to not finish the plate, it's so big. It has the standard toppings, the beans are good, the red sauce that they drape over it is great. But what makes these better then most is first the cheese, love the flavor and their not afraid to pile it on. But what wins me over every time is that they cook the plate in a broiler, which makes it all nice and hot, melts, crisps up the cheese and the chips.

Blue Fin serves very good, healthful Japanese food and is run by some of the sweetest people you'll ever meet (thanks Howard and Betsy!)\n\nI've tried many things on the menu and it's all very tasty. However there's one dish that I always go back for and find myself craving - the white meat teriyaki chicken. Yes, I know, teriyaki is the most common Japanese dish in America, but Blue Fin's is simply awesome. \n\nMost restaurants serve teriyaki as chicken with commercially-made sauce squeezed on top. But Blue Fin marinates their chicken in a homemade teriyaki that's just incredible. It's a big serving and I rarely leave any on the plate. Order it with the salad and it's even better - the best asian salad dressing beside's flo's asian kitchen. And sprinkle on some of the spicy seasoning that's on the table, too. hard to beat it.\n\nOnly drawback lately is all the construction around the area, but hey that's downtown these days.

The chicken wasn't drenched in an overly sweet sauce like a lot of Japanese places. It had this smoky flavor like it had been on the grill, not something I'm used to with teriyaki. I certainly didn't mind it. Also, the cabbage, carrots, etc. had some flavor to them and they didn't taste like they had been overcooked or terribly greasy like at a Panda Express. I felt full afterward, but not in a gross \"I ate too many onion rings\" kind of way. The bowl cost about $6.50 which I consider reasonable. The place also has a watercooler where you are free to fill 'er up. When the cashier wasn't busy, she came around and grabbed my cup to refill it for me. Nice touch. \n\nNow, I gave it four stars not because I'd call it a four-star restaurant but for what it offers considering it's \"fast food\" and for the good manners. I'll definitely come again.

Found The Blue Fin. Read the reviews and decided to see how it was. With the light rail going down Central, if you are not on the right side of the road you have to go about a quarter of a mile to turn around. Traffic was light so no problem. Painted blue and white. Very bright colors shows up well. Gives you the welcome feel. It not really a sushi bar. They specialize in teriyaki but they do have two offerings of sushi on the menu. The place is small with seating inside and outside also. Since it is still warn in Phoenix this time of year I decided to eat inside. This place is maybe the cleanest place I have visited. It was so clean it almost hurt the eyes. No dust or dirt anywhere. Service was as good as it gets. I ordered a teriyaki rice bowel and since I wanted some sushi the spicy tuna roll and ice tea. \nThe cashier called over a employee and gave them my cup to be filled with ice tea. I could of gotten the tea but this is part of their service. My teriyaki bowel was delivered first. The food was good and really more there than one person needs to eat. My sushi came. It was also good. Then came more customer service. The lady that had filled my cup with tea was back asked if I needed more tea. I said yes and away she went with my cup. She refilled it with ice and then the tea. The owner then came up and asked if everything was ok. Nice touch. \nA lot of the people coming in and out must eat there often as they were greeted with hello (their name). \nSo how was the food? The food was good and plentiful and inexpensive. \nWould I go back? I have told many people about this place and if I was in the area, yes I would go back.\nThe customer service was the best I have ever seen in a fast food establishment.

Yogi's and Yoshi's and wherever else we tried never really cut it. A Yelp search brought up Blue Fin, and although it's a little further than normal to fetch lunch, I mentioned it to him and he agreed to try it. And glad we were! \n\nWe had the daily special ($7.29), which consisted of teriyaki chicken, rice, salad, 2 spring rolls and drink, and an order of sunomono ($1.29). Opt for all white meat (+$0.75) and brown rice (+$0.30). It was a lot of food. The salad was meh, and in the same box as the teriyaki, so it was kinda warm by the time I got back to the office (at least the dressing was in a separate container). Probably won't order the special again, just to avoid the salad. The rice was perfect, the sauce was delicious and the chicken was fantastic. Thinly sliced (not in chunks like all the other joints) and no yucky gristle or fat hanging off. If anything, maybe a little too heavy on the soy sauce. The spring rolls were just a tad under cooked, but still good. The sweet & sour sauce looked kinda grainy, but tasted just fine. Sunomono was great. Overall, the best teriyaki bowl in the area!\n\nI picked up our food in the middle of lunch time and was expecting parking to be terrible, based on other reviews. But there were only a couple other cars in their small lot. There were 25-30 people scattered around the inside & outside tables, so I'm guessing they either foot it, or take the light rail, which stops just out front. Also, they have a drive up window. I'm not sure if you can order it there or if it's just for pickup, but it'd be convenient with a phone-in order next time! The staff was SUPER friendly, to boot! \n\nP.S.

They made some futile attempts to get a \"Let's Go Dbacks\" chant going but the crowd wasn't that into it.  (And at that point there weren't that many Cubs fans there...)  They had a good healthy banter with the Cubs fans which was amusing.   They didn't care when we ordered shots of Jager, although the two female Cubs fans next to us were shocked.  (Sorry, this is just how we roll.  We don't take shots of whatever that nuts and berries concoction that you're drinking is....)  \n\nThe nachos were strange.  The chicken was like grade F chicken and there was a lot of the fixings but they were not well layered at all.   There was a ton of stuff on top (including all the guac and sour cream) then a bunch of naked chips and then a whole ton of cheese and all the beans on the bottom.  We also asked for jalapenos on the side, but they just didn't give them to us at all.\n\nI would definitely go back here before a game again.  It was a good relaxed atmosphere and a quick walk over to the stadium.  However, I think I'll probably stick with drinking there and save my munchies for the ballpark.", "business_id": "j8nyAaN_w5t6wYv-ni23sg", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-10-05", "type": "review"}

It was good, but it must have been at the end of the pot, because it was just really strangely thick and it had a bit of a skin.

We started out with appetizers including meatballs, Italian nachos, and a wedge salad for the table. The meatballs were actually pretty good and my girlfriend also enjoyed her wedge salad.

All you Yelpers must be in on some vast conspiracy to chat this place up on days when I'm outside sweating to the sweet sounds of backhoes instead of procrastinating on this site under the soul sucking fluorescent lights of the office.\n\nWell played.\n\nI wish I could say the same about Fate.\n\nMy dining partner (who is obviously in on the scheme as well) had heard rave reviews about this place from roommates and friends alike, so we swung by to grab a bite on a Thursday night. He was looking forward to a delectable Pan-Asian experience. I was just looking for something to satisfy my gnawing hunger. \n\nWe didn't have a very hard time finding the place, which seems to be a common complaint, and stumbled upon a cute little converted house with a group of five sipping beers outside as they waited for a table. Since they're on summer hours or something, only one of the two houses was open, and none of the cool outdoor decorations (aside from the wicked Buddah head) were present. Just a tiny little stylized sign that stated, \"Fate.\" \n\nI really hoped that the stars were about to align and the combined fury of the kitchen and wait staff would result in the culmination of its namesake. \n\nAfter entering the restaurant and approaching the hostess, I was startled by the number of empty tables in the place and pleased that we'd soon have some saucy, ricey goodness to sate our hunger. Unfortunately, that wasn't so. She made us wait outside, after specifically barring us from remaining indoors, for five minutes. Baffling, but no biggie. Then we were ushered into a tiny room at the front of the establishment that boasted Ikea decor and very little ambiance, so I can't even give it points on that basis, which also seems to be a big seller with reviewers. We also sat about a foot and a half from the table next to us and I had to listen to the most pretentious and vapid conversation I've been a party to in recent memory. Not good.\n\nThe waitress was very friendly and attentive, and we placed our order for a couple iced teas and the pot sticker appetizer. When it came time for us to order, she was great help with the menu and we decided on the Cantonese Black Dragon Beef and the Szechuan chicken. \n\nAfter paying four bucks for a bottle of Republic of Tea, which is by no means 'gourmet,' I was a little miffed but willing to ride out the experience and judge by food alone. Then the potstickers came on a bamboo platter and I felt those stars starting to drift into alignment. I raised one to my lips after dipping it into the sauce and the celestial bodies whizzed right by each other with no care for fulfilling their fate.\n\nThey were comparable to frozen Costco brand potstickers and the sauce they came with was heavy on soy sauce and light on any other flavor. I was too hungry to care so I scarfed my fair share, but my dining partner was completely turned off. Still, I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt, maybe it was an off night in the kitchen. Then the food arrived with a little side of rice. \n\nIt tasted a little better than your mom and pop corner shop Chinese, but it was on par with anything at P.F. Chang's. And if I can compare it to a nationwide chain, it doesn't deserve any more than a mediocre rating. My food was the perfect serving size, with just the right amount of rice, but the sauce was drastically different than any other szechuan dish I've ever had and the some of the chicken was diced into itsy bitsy little pieces that funked with the texture. I was really hungry, so I wasn't that critical, but my dining partner ate about three bites of his and declared, \"I'm never coming back here again.\" To put it simply, he thought it sucked. Hard.\n\nFate is a restaurant that seems to cater to individuals that place ambiance very highly in their dining experience. The food isn't great nor is it well priced, but I may have gone on an off night, so I'm willing to give it another shot and possibly adjust my review.

So here we are eating in a restaurant that I'm convinced people go to only to be seen and here we are not being seen.  Oh woe is me!  Woe, woe, woe is me!  However will I earn my cool points for the month?\n\nThe waitress was very nice and attentive.  I'll give them that but god damn could they keep this place any darker.  I realize it adds ambiance but when you're struggling to read the damn menu it's a little much.  Strike two!\n\nWe order a couple of $4 Republic of Teas and the pot stickers then proceed to peruse the rest of the menu.  The variety is somewhat lacking and a common theme is sweetness.  As anyone who knows me will tell you, I don't do sweet.  So I order the Cantonese Dragon Beef and my significant other orders the Szechuan Chicken.\n\nThe waitress comes back with the pot stickers.  They sucked.  They were identical to the ones you get at Costco.  They are just like the ones they serve at Casey Moore's during happy hour only there they're free.  Here they cost $6.  I eat one and that's it.  Strike three!\n\nThen comes the entrees.  Decent sized portions.  I can't really tell you if the presentation was good because it was so damn dark in there but I'll just give them the benefit of the doubt on that one.  Mine was in a word, crap.  The best thing you could say about it is that it tasted weird.  I didn't even like the mushrooms.  I am a mushroom fanatic.  If there are two things on a menu that both look awesome and one has mushrooms and the other doesn't, the mushrooms always tip the scales.  But they didn't even save this dish.  I am beginning to think the baseball metaphor wasn't the best route to go as here we are already at strike four.  \n\nSo in my disappointment I decide to give my girlfriends Szechuan Chicken a try.  Baseball was definitely not the way to go because we're at strike five now.  \n\nSo now my only option is the white rice that came with the dish.  This thankfully was perfectly adequate.  Now if I go to a fucking CHINESE restaurant and the best compliment I can give the food is \"At least they didn't fuck up the rice\", we are in some ugly territory here people.  \n\nIf you're looking to go to some hip chic place cuz you want to here the latest spins from DJ Such and such, skip Fate, hit up Hunan Express and then just go straight to Myst or Drift or where ever the shiny shirts happen to be on that given night.

I had high expectations, since I had been to Lucky Dragon in the past (the owners prev joint) which was OK.\n\nIt was the worst Chinese/Asian I've had in AZ, the service was terrible, the chairs uncomfortable, and to top it off my fiancee got food poisoning.... and has been sick for the last 2 days from it. I took her to the ER this morning at 4:30 AM and decided to finally start posting on Yelp since I've been a lurker for a while.\n\nAesthetics:\nInitially looks like a typical hipster restaurant like you might find in another city. Nice patio, cool inside.  However... The seating at a bus stop is more comfy. There is no chair back - just this high bar thing that digs into your back.\n\nI'm going to file this under aesthetics - we ordered the Hot and Sour soup (more on that later) and the waitress suggested it was large enough to share. However, they apparently don't have any kind of serving utensil, so we had to use our little soup spoons to serve ourself soup into another bowl out of this wide shallow terrine. WTF?\n\nService:\nI don't know a nicer way to say it, our waitress was a dopey bimbo. It took 20 minutes for her to take our order. She went missing for long periods of time when I had an empty water glass, and then for a while longer after I tracked her down and asked for some. Not good.\n\nFood:\nI ran into a friend there, and he commented at how he loved the food and was surprised we didn't like it. To be blunt, it was utter crap. \n\nThe hot and sour soup was thin and spicy. That's it. It tasted like chiles and a splash of rice wine vinegar- no other flavors present. It's not like any hot and sour soup I ever had.... in a bad way. There are these weird chewy dumplings like things in it that would be better served at protecting the floor from your chair leg. \n\nI ordered some Saigon basil something or other dish with beef, she ordered the Lemon Grass whatever with tofu.\nMy dish was bad. The beef was sliced thin but tough and chewy, and totally lacked flavor. As for basil, there were 2 small basil leaves in the dish, and that's it. The sauce was thin and one dimensional. \n\nHer lemon grass dish was also bad. The sauce tasted like Tom Yum paste from the chinese grocery store mixed with some water. I felt bad for the poor abused tofu.\n\nI'm not a big fan of chain restaurants.... but Pei Wei and Pickup Sticks are about 10x better in terms of food quality and taste. Screw that, even the chinese place in the mall food court is better. I am not exaggerating. It was a very disappointing meal.\n\nNow for the nasty part.\nI drank water - Fiancee unit drank th 'Green Tea.' It was like no other green tea I ever had seen. It was leprechaun green, with some kind of milk like substance in it.I thought it looked kinda funky, but she drank it.\n\nIt was the only difference between our meals. I tried hers, she tried mine, etc. I didn't drink the science experiment tea.\n\nWell... Several hours later she started having stabbing stomach pains. She spent the whole night up vomiting and with diarrhea.  2 days later the vomiting has subsided but she's missed 2 days of school and is still pooping up a storm. I took her to the ER at 4:30 AM this morning and they confirmed the symptoms were consistent with food poisoning. Admittedly she had just gotten back a 45 days ago from a trip to a 3rd world country where she got (and recovered from) a tropical disease so her immune system is not at it's strongest right now, but come on. This shouldn't be the end result. Plus this IS downtown Phoenix so there are plenty of people around with compromised immune systems, if you know what I mean, due to lifestyle choices.\n\nThere is some great Asian food in Central Phoenix. \n\nMaxim and Da Vang are great Vietnamese places on 19th ave.\nThe Cultural Center has a few great places, esp Golden Buddha. \nThai Lahna has been consistently good for years.\nLike I said I don't eat a lot of chain food - but even the Pei Wei at 7th ave and McDowell is way better in terms of food quality.", "business_id": "VsO_rhXi5lgbaGxNwoEZsQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2007-10-13", "type": "review"}

The veteran servers have always been amazing, but what's with the hostess? It would be nice being greeted with a smile and 'hello'.

Once the show wrapped up, it was back to kick ass deep 80s cuts (think Thompson Twins song from Sixteen Candles and Joe Jackson) from RadioNigel.com playing in the background.\n\nThe ambiance is a truly metro cafe - something many local coffeehouses are lacking. The feel inside is very bohemian chic with its moody lighting and eclectic look.  Random bric-a-brac abounds here - everything from fish tanks to a bird cage, for sale I think. It's more of a European caf / art gallery / live music venue than a coffeehouse.  Bathrooms are kind of rough around the edges - if you can hold it, you're better off.\n\nThey serve a variety of coffees and tea and light fare like sandwiches, salads - lots of veggie options, btw.\n\nI had the mandarin spiced ice tea with a Venice Violin panini with dried Italian salami, provolone, veggies, pepperocini, olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and Dijon mustard on a sourdough baguette.

This is a festival organized by the businesses on Grand Avenue.  The paisley Violin is one of those businesses.\n\nThat said, we came in and struggled to find a seat for the six of us.  Several 2 or 3 people groups at 6 people tables.  So we all squeeze onto one round table meant for 4 at the most.  Strike one - wait staff should shepherd small groups to small tables.\n\nOur waitress finds us after a 5 minute wait and takes our beer order.  Many of us order the same beer.  One person orders a very common mixed drink comprised of Cola and Whiskey. The waitress has no clue what it is - replying with \"What's that?\".   Funny, but a bit of a clue about how our epic 2.5 hour dinner will go.  \n\nA larger table freed up, so we took it.  I guess wait staff hate cleaning tables that have people on them, cause she left a big pile of crumbs laying for us to snack on.\n\nThe next round of drinks, they were out of our new favorite beer because they must have a small fridge, so some of us walk outside to look at the beer list, since the waitress doesn't know them.  Those who walked outside got their drinks ordered.  10-15min later, a new waitress asks us if she can get us something.  Yes!\n\nThe music was nice, and the musicians were very courteous and concerned with the volume - our band could take notes on that.\n\nI ordered the gyro.  I've had about 20 different Gyro's in my life.  This was more like a salad burying a couple very thin slices of meat.  I'm not a meat maniac, but they sure did skimp for some reason.  This new concept of saladwich was good, but not really what I ordered.  Also got the seafood chipotle soup which was interesting and tasty.\n\nThey must have been out of beer, because they didn't come by for any more drink orders.  \n\nHopefully the owners of this place will learn to stock up on wait staff and beer for special events.  \n\nAnother review said that the waitress had been on for 12 hours.

It seems like the kind of place that you can drop into for a cocktail on a nice Saturday afternoon.  But...\n\nThe menu looks like it was written by a kid in the first grade.  Some people would find that charming, but we found it a bit trying.  Also, it was written on one piece of white paper.  There were NO descriptions of any of the food.  So we had to ask the wait staff about the items we were interested in, which would have been fine, but...\n\nThe wait staff.  Hmph. A bit slow.  And totally unknowledgable.  They didn't know what was in the items.  We asked, and then items showed up with things on it that we were not expecting (and didn't like).\n\nThe food was NOT GOOD.  I ordered the shawarma.  It was TERRIBLE.  No flavor at all.  The chicken was boiled and had no seasoning.  The tahini sauce had no flavor at all.  I asked for some taztiki sauce to see if it would help.  It did not.  It was the WORST shawarma I have ever had.  However, the potato salad was tasty.\n\nThe BF had the lamb gyro which he said was nothing special (very average).  And my friend ordered the italian sandwich, which he liked.  For the price of the food, everything should have tasted better.\n\nDrinks were expensive.  A rum and coke in a place that looks and feels like a dive bar was $7.  SERIOUSLY?  Wow.  Unless you go during happy hour, the prices don't seem worth it.  They did have a good beer selection, and all of those (besides the super cheap ones) were $5 each.  That seemed reasonable.\n\nFinally, the music.  Ugh.  They had this guy with a guitar get up and sing/play.  He was terrible.  And it was SO LOUD we could barely hear each other.  Plus the table behind of us of older hippies were doing shots and whistling at the end of each song.  Getting rowdier and rowdier.  Great for them that they were having a good time.

It was easily located across from my hotel and it was a weekend, which meant I could catch both the collegiate and professional football games as well as playoff baseball.\n I take Hooters for what it is, pretty decent fried food, a restaurant that caters to men, and always has a game on. This in mind, I didn't anticipate anything other then a beer and something to eat.\nI sat at the bar both times and the bartender, Brittany was extremely friendly and made a point to learn (while IDing) and remember everyone's name-- which I thought was a nice touch. She was always willing to change channels to make sure everyone's game was being aired which was appreciated as well. They have a good football special-- 10 boneless wings with all you can eat fries for $5.99 during any football game.  The $3.50 25oz Shock Top beers were a deal as well. \nIt was odd for me to see a kid's birthday party in the restaurant on Sunday, but to each their own.", "business_id": "qsWxbgQwuomXvMseg23DGg", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-10-14", "type": "review"}

Granted, my expectations weren't super high, I've been to other locations and they've always been consistent.  And sure enough - the Arizona Center location did not disappoint.\n\nWe were in a group of about twelve, and we all ordered beers and food before going to a movie.  Service was great - (reading other reviews - we may have just been lucky) but seriously everyone was friendly and prompt.  We had multiple servers helping us since our party was large.  My fiance and I ordered a couple of beers (domestics of course, but we made do) and their famous wings.  I ordered two that were the hottest level of spice they came in.  Honestly - they weren't hot at all to me but my fiance must constantly remind me of my lack of taste buds (I recently took on the infamous ghost chili and won - but that is a story for another time).  Everyone at the table thought they were spicy, so order with caution.  We ordered them Daytona style - which means they were grilled - and they were yummy. \n\nThe girls were of course pretty!  ;)  They even sang happy bday to our two buddies - who had the biggest smiles on their faces EVER!\n\nThe negative to this particular Hooters is the location itself.  The Arizona Center becomes a ghost town at night - and parking in the lot is tricky.  Even with validation you still have to pay after a certain amount of time passes.  Maybe I'm just spoiled - but when I go out to dinner or a bar I don't like having to pay for parking.  It's not like we're in New York or San Francisco!  \n\nRegardless - parking issues aside - a really fun time with a good group of friends.

I was not disappointed.  They use a corn pasta that has a very good consistency and has a very good taste... my non-gf dining partner also ordered it and enjoyed it very much.  The meat sauce was fantastic in a super salty, not healthy kind of way and the sausage... oh the sausage, so good.

It is a basic, solid, basic, unpretentious, basic, fun restaurant; it's the type of restaurant that is disappearing in this country, where we are rapidly becoming a nation of two choices: fast food or upscale. Here you will find generous sized portions, friendly service (almost over-zealously so), and a crowd of diners that are genuinely enjoying their experience. There is always at least 1 birthday song going on somewhere in the restaurant, and I've heard as many as 4 during one visit. You'll see a cable car, you'll hear creaking floors, you'll have ice cream (included) in a small metal dish.\n\nThe salads are 100% iceberg. Want field greens or Romaine? Not here. Go somewhere else. The bread usually comes out so hot that you have to wait for it to cool. It tastes much less mass produced than the breadsticks at Olive Garden these days. You can have your spaghetti in the regular size or get the larger portion \"for the hearty appetite\". Where do you see that anymore? They have mizithra cheese. You won't find that at Bucca di Beppo.

We walked in yesterday evening and I promptly greeted the two hostesses at the front desk. They were chatting amongst themselves, turned to look at me, and then went back to chatting with each other. My husband, thinking  they hadn't heard me, also greeted them and we were once again met with the same chilly silence. An awkward moment passed where they stared at us and we stared at them before one of the hostesses turned and grabbed three menus and walked us through a nearly empty restaurant - passed all the lovely tables,  architectural details, and charming decor - all the way back to the bowels of the restaurant. We were sat at a dingy table on the kitchen's doorstep. Who doesn't enjoy being serenaded by clanking dishes, wait staff yelling at each other, and the general cacophony of a kitchen in a nearly empty restaurant? How thoughtful. The waiter, who was far more friendly than the hostesses, was nice enough if not a bit bungling. He stepped on my husband's foot once and even hit him with the serving tray accidentally. We were off to a great start. \n\nOur food was as miserable as the service. The sourdough bread came with a side of warm margarine, and the minestrone soup was a little too close to canned-tasting for my liking. My husband had the #3 which came with two meatballs, spaghetti with meat sauce, and an Italian sausage. (He fared the best.) His son had the pope pourri (poo pourri) which is spaghetti with four different, equally sad, canned sauces. I ordered the jumbo crab raviolis which were served unexpectedly lukewarm/cold and dry with a little warm sauce and oil. There is nothing special about the food - it's edible, yes, but it's also lacking anything crave-able. The food is overpriced for what you get. It's \"competitively priced\" with trendy midtown eateries, but lacking all of the flavor, care, and quality that makes the other places so very worth it. \n\nThe highlight of the evening came when the waiter brought the check and cough/laughed enveloping the table in a thick, aromatic blanket of smoke which hung in the air like a moist hug. It was the perfect unappetizing, terrible end to a generally terrible experience.", "business_id": "DlCtdbceo4YNSI53cCL2lg", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-10-19", "type": "review"}

Not a day later and it was all over the side of the truck. So I came in to have them wash the outside of the truck and explain the situation the older lady writing the tickets told me that she would take care of it and upon the truck being finished they told me that I had to pay. I explained there must be a confusion as I was told it was being taken care of. They then say they do not give free car washes. After explaining that I would get two cars washed here one time a week each. that is a hundred and four car washes per year, totaling to over $2000 a year to the wash and $500 and up in tips. They still declined to fix there bad wash. Go to any other car wash. They will do the same job for less and much faster as well.

None of these adjectives turned out to be an accurate descriptor. In fact, the food at Zoe's kitchen took 30 minutes to come out and was disgustingly bland and in a few cases, quite gross. \n\nWe stopped in for lunch last week. The place was packed, but the line to order moved quickly, so we incorrectly assumed that we would also get our food quickly. More on that in a second. In terms of the menu, we were shocked at how uninteresting the menu options seemed. Even though the menu was decently sized and we are open to lots of different types of food and flavors, we found ourselves completely unable to choose and not drawn to any individual option. \n\nEven though I'm not a vegetarian, I prefer lunch sandwiches with no meat, so I was also quite irritated that the only vegetarian sandwiches were the grilled cheese and grilled feta. This is 2008, and the non-meat options at a lunch spot should be more imaginative than cheese slapped on some bread. In the end, I still ended up ordering the grilled cheese (nothing else sounded good!) and my husband selected the Greek Chicken Marinara. \n\nWe sat down at the table, displayed our number card, and just waited. And waited. And waited. After literally waiting for 25 minutes, I checked in with the assistant manager who was manning the pick-up counter. She went into the kitchen, checked on our order, and said it would be just a \"few more minutes.\" She even had a server bring us two slices of chocolate cake as some sort of  token of their sympathy, but it was super-dry and totally gross. Thanks, but no thanks. I'm just glad we didn't pay $2 for each slice!\n\nIt wasn't until 10 minutes later when I lost my patience and told the same server that we wanted our food immediately that we finally received it. We have a higher-than-average awareness of the difficulties of working in food service, but we found it un-acceptable that a non-full-service restaurant would take 35+ minutes to bring us two sandwiches. If they can't handle the catering, to-go, and eat-in order volume, they should hire more staff members. \n\nAs if the slow service wasn't painful enough, my grilled cheese was completed charred (literally burned and black). After one bit of the accompanying slaw, which was soaked in mayonnaise and soggy, I  immediately walked back to the assistant manager, handed her the plate, and asked her to refund me for my plate. To her credit, she complied, but the wait had already been so egregious that I wasn't about to just write the long wait and gross food off and decide to return. \n\nMy husband's Greek Marinara was not as terrible but was still bland and completely un-memorable. The bread was a plain roll, the chicken breast strips were formed and tasted totally processed, and the \"Greek\" marinara tasted like Prego. The only tasty part of his meal was the side of bagged chips!\n\nI guarantee you that we won't be back to Zoe's Kitchen. We are huge fans of fast, casual, and fresh lunch food, but we found the food at Zoe's to be anything but.", "business_id": "trAvQPp7gps0Btk-2AmLpw", "stars": 1, "date": "2008-09-23", "type": "review"}

The tuna is a bit bland, and, as another reviewer pointed out, I could make the same tuna for $0.69 at home, with low cal mayo.

I used to go here quite often, but I am thinking twice before returning.

First off, there has been water covering the floor of the left side of the restaurant the past 3 times I have been there. I think they have a leaky roof, but it has been weeks, maybe even months, and there is still water. This is hazardous and just plain disgusting. Also, the restaurant is just dirty. I had to ask to have 2 different tables wiped down, and the crumbs from the table were wiped onto the chairs. There were 5 of us in for lunch last week, and every chair was covered in crumbs from the previous diners. So gross!

So one of the managers from Zoe's asks for my phone number so he can find out more information. I give it to him, willing to share my experience. He calls me, hears me out, and apologizes. Then he asks for my address so he can send me a gift certificate. Unnecessary, I tell him, but nice touch. So I give him my address. Now, 2 weeks later, nothing.

Great color scheme. The interior was cute to match and even had local artists' works propped up on ledges which was nice to see the local support. I couldn't figure out if this was a chain or locally owned because it looked borderline corportate inside but had a lot of \"we support local\" types about. \n\nAs a first-timer I asked the counter girl her suggestion and she (and the woman behind her) were kind enough to offer up good suggestions. I order Zoe's Club Pita with pasta salad for $8. I walked away but doubled back to ask if it had come with a drink, the counter girl said no but gave me a drink anyway... uh, hello, so nice!\n\nI'm glad I took the workers suggestions because the pasta salad was AMAZING! A generous portion of feta cheese and tomatoes was delightful, my only complant was there wasn't enough. I wanted more!\n\nMy sandwhich on the other hand was a different story. The pita pocket had huge hole in it making it tear and really difficult to handle. The meat wasn't positioned all the way into the pocket and most of it was falling out the top. It was like three slices of ham had been wrapped around huge slices of grilled chicken and shoved into the pita. I was pretty sad to see this. I ate the whole thing and although it was tasty, it wasn't easy to keep altogether.\n\nI really appreciated the counter girl's kindness in giving me a drink but the status of the sandwhich was enough to probably deter me from returning.

At least, that's what I observed might have been cool to do when I ended up there after the Depeche Mode concert across the street @ US Airways Center (I miss BOB, it made it so much more personable, but anyway).  \n\nSo, DM let out about quarter til 11, and my group all decided to go grab one @ the Hard Rock, and maybe get something to eat. When we walked up, 2 blonde waitrons were at the door, holding it open for us, saying \"Just so you know we just called last call, and aren't serving food. In fact, we should already be closed.\" CHARMED! So, a music-themed restaurant/bar, located directly across from an arena that frequently hosts ummm, CONCERTS, wouldn't plan to capitalize on the outflow of excited music fans and perhaps stay open  and make some monayyy? OK. As a bartender, I'd have insisted that it be so. This summer sucked for the service industry, and I found it so surprising that such an establishment wouldn't have been more malleable to perhaps retain and dare I say, boost the morale of their  staff by anticipating and catering to a late crowd of people who'd rather spend $5 (ok, $5.46) as opposed to $11 @ the arena for some post-concert frosty bevs. Have a little bump in their take-home scrilla for the night, and I dunno, fun? Meh.\n\nAnd there were about 15 other people in there at the bar, too. The only person there who was workin it was the bartendress, though, she too, seemed like she was a bit put-out that she had a bunch of customers come in last-minute. I do give her props for salting the rim of my pint glass and pouring a DosXX for me without having the salt volcano all the beer out of the glass. \n\nMaybe it's the corporate management bs that was in the way.

As you're standing in line either waiting for your pick up or ordering on the spot...you're forced to look at that beautiful pizza.  \nThe cheese looks gooey, the toppings fresh, and the crust crusty.  It looked so good to me that I ended up ordering a slice even though I had already called something else in.  \nI got ham and pepperoni.  It was honestly irresistible looking in its tray.  But when I got it back to the office I was like, \"Oh.\"\nI could see that it wasn't as thick as I first thought, and a bit more grease than expected too.  The crust had the consistency that I like - crusty and, well...crusty.  But its taste was less than stellar, just kinda bland and greasy.  \nSo now I know all that glitters isn't gold.\nNow on to what I actually ordered - the Italian beef.  I never had one like this before - its more like a hoagie than the thing I'm used to getting everywhere else.  The meat was thicker and chunkier (that's what she said), whole slices of green peppers, and really no juice.  Don't get me wrong, though...it tasted great.  Everything was fresh and the meat ended up being very tender and juicy.  I even liked the bread it was on.  But its not my beloved italian beef sandwich I'm used to.\nI went again the next day.\nThis time I ordered the gyro, with the idea that if they get the gyro wrong I can take them off of my wall of menus.\nIt was a traditional gyro with cucumber sauce, onions, tomato and a soft pita...but it was only ordinary.  Again, it tasted fine and good, but it wasn't one of the best I've had.\nAnd like the day before, I got messed up while I was in line looking at the food trays.  This time they had baked wing dings!  50 cent a wing was a bit expensive, but those little things were absolutely delicious!  They were seasoned so well.  And not greasy at all.  So good!\nTwo things about this place that will make me come back more than the food - the service and the prices.\nThe lady that works the cashier has such a warm smile and manner, like an old Italian mama.  And what I assume is the boss/owner was also very friendly and bubbly.  \nThe prices are some of the best in this downtown area that I've found so far.  I mean, under $5 for an Italian beef or a gyro???  When I got the pizza slice and the IB, I only paid like $8.50 or so.  ONE salad costs that much at some places.  \nThere is not a whole lotta room inside and seems to fill up quick, but there is seating outside too. \nSo to sum it up, If you didn't bring a lunch to work and have about $5, you can go here and have a tasty lunch.

Think ordinary salads (chicken cobb and a southwestern caesar), your typical rubber chicken banquet meals, a breakfast buffet of eggs, bacon, Starbucks coffee etc.   For dessert we had some kind of cheesecake turnover sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar - yum. \n\nIf you go in the near future - definitely check out the ongoing construction.

Would've been nice to have other offerings even if we weren't in a newer and bigger portion of the center. \n\nThe staff was friendly from the few interactions I had and the rooms were decent sized.

I've been here countless times before, and watched the place get upgraded and remodeled several years ago.\n\nI can't remember the first time I came here, but it was some time ago after I moved out here. The convention center has an older part thats smaller, and a new addition that's huge!  Plenty of events are held here all year round, from sporting events like the NBA all star game, to the auto show, they had an NRA convention a couple years ago with a zillion people, along with other regular yearly events like the auto show and several others.\n\nThe place is large, and has 3 levels (a basement area, main level and upper level) with a crosswalk to get to the other side which is pretty darn cool. It's huge, spacious, and modern looking with its updates.  Escalators, stairs, etc.  The place is sparsely decorated with Arizona stuff that makes it really cool looking. They also have a cool light feature outside that illuminates the walkway with different colors at night and is really pretty to look at as well.\n\nThe cool thing about it is too is that its easily accessible via light rail, and you don't have to spend $$ on parking...and let me tell you, the parking here isn't cheap! $12 for the garage, $10 in lots around, and its not any cheaper the farther away you get.  I don't know why anyone would want to park down here, since the light rail is $3.50 round trip, so save yourself a few bucks and take the rail. You'll thank me later!\n\nThere's also food and dining in here as well, with a variety of different style resturants, but again, its outrageously expensive!  They have a starbucks here too, which is their regular prices, but is like an extra $5 a person to eat here, so dine elsewhere before you come in here.  (minus the coffee since Starbucks is the only reasonably priced place in here.)  Plus, the convention center is a hop, skip and a jump from about a zillion other cool dining places that your better off eating at anyways, so do that instead.\n\nAside from that, this place is pretty huge, and its worth checking out. Plenty of clean pretty bathrooms and tons to do in and outside of the center with variety of different sized spaces to hold any kind of event, large or small.", "business_id": "F6BedoYgbAQHqwKX9F0zDQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-11-14", "type": "review"}

Apparently between July 2012 and October 2012 the VA over paid me $2,054.67 in tuition and fees, which I never saw a dime of because it went directly to the school. AND, now apparently I was overpaid $1,978.67 for the same period for housing, books and supplies.

I was told mid August 2014 that the last over charge of $1,978.67 would be taken care of and paid for. Nothing. I call and e-mail for weeks and nothing and finally I get ahold of someone today, and was told, there was a problem. Wonder why I was contacted for the last 4 weeks about this \"problem\" until I call and e-mail them last week and this week, after getting another letter from the VA saying they've already begun garnishing my benefits from another school I'm currently attending. Two god damn years, and I'm still dealing with this issue. Stay away from this place period, especially if you're a veteran.

So before I do that deal I'm saying goodbye to my favorite Phoenix delicacies. \n\nThis Place --ohhh. \n\nIt's sex. It's total sex. \n\nSometimes sex is nice. It's fun, it doesn't hurt, it's familiar. \n\nNot here. \n\nIt's like the shy unassuming person you never really thought of doin' it with before.  It's been in the neighborhood forever, you never really hear about how awesome it is, it doesn't look like much from the inside or outside. It kind of looks like an old school adobe Taco Bell. \n\nSo, never really having had a good Philly Cheesesteak sandwhich, I wasn't sure what to expect. \n\nThe Menu is pretty simple. 8 different cheesesteaks, gyros, subs, fries, onion rings, tasty cakes, salads, burgers. \n\nWell duh, I'll get a cheesesteak. \n\nThe cheesesteaks are 10 inches. \n\nEven after I saw that, I was thinking,\"I can take this\". I ordered a half mushroom one, a half pizza one. Thinking I could take 5 inches at a time, and save some for later. \n\nSo I began taking it. \n\nThis shy unassuming restaurant began showing how truly Freaky DeeKay it was. \n\nThe first bite was mind blowing, amazing, opening up whole new vistas of experience. I never knew it could be this good. The steak is chopped on the grill with olive oil, and then covered in white american cheese. The mushroom added the best mushrooms I have ever had on a sandwhich. The pizza side added really well done pizza sauce. \n\nThat first bite ohhh. \n\nThen thats where it got nasty, and rough.\n\nIt's too much! I thought I was tough, I thought I could take it- but this is fried red meat covered in fatty cheese encased in delicious carb centric white italian bread.  That first bite was amazing, but I wasn't sure this was for me. I was worried about the damage to my body. I didn't know if my heart could take it.\n\nThe sandwhich looked at me as if to say \"want me to stop?\". I considered that this was rough, this was new- but my 10 inch big boy was such a demonstration of mastery and experience, I couldn't stop. I NEEDED more.\n\nSo as I was abandoning myself to the experience I realized this was just on the brink of gross enough to be nasty and carnal, and refined enough to be a truly unique experience. There was no fatty pieces in the meat. It wasn't too hard and tough. It's astuteness tempered itself by being soft and delicate.  There were moments where I thought 'Oh my god, I have to stop, I think I might die!\" but I couldn't. I so couldn't.\n\nThis in not something I can handle every day. This sandwhich made me want to eat salads for the rest of the week. Not because I feel dirty or guilty, simply because I know taking this thing pushed the physical limits of my body. \n\nToo many of these and I could easily see myself crying in \nshame and lamenting  \"what man would want me now\"?", "business_id": "OoHWabV-ym7_HWlHeXTsVA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-09-11", "type": "review"}

Touted as the best in Arizona, and although enjoyably tasty and fresh, in my opinion (for what it's worth) it comes just slightly short of what one would call a true Philly!

I rationalize this statement under the same pretense just as I have reviewed and written about the traditional 'Cuban Sandwich'.  Despite Best of Philly's derivation, it is, within reason, a very, very good sandwich.  Regrettably, nowhere on their menu do they offer the 'real' thing which undoubtedly would include the deli roast beef of rib eye or occasionally top round steak griddled and chopped into virgin olive oil, afforded melted provolone cheese, with preferences like of pepper, saut\u00e9ed onions, mayo, mushrooms, maybe some hot sauce, along with salt, pepper, and/or ketchup, and it would be too costly to fly in the bread from PA... don't get me wrong though, we're not in Philly and this is the closest to a real Philly I've run across in Phoenix - keep it up guys, we'll be back for more.

Today the other salon was closed, I needed my gel nails removed because they were lifting and I knew if I pulled them off myself I risked damaging my nails.  I was surprised when I walked in during the lunch hour and this place was empty but for two nail techs and one customer.  I asked to have my gel nails removed.  A girl came from the back, poured acetone in a bowl and had me soak without first filing the top layer of gel to let the acetone absorb and lift.  (I've been getting my nails done long enough to watch the process many times over).  She then took out her tool and began to scrape, peel and pull the gel off - this was not a painless process.  My nails remained visibly damaged (much worse than the times I've pulled at them myself).  When I asked about it she told me that's how they remove all gel nails and that the reason my nails were visibly damaged is because the gel was on too thick.  Then she charged me half of what I would normally pay for gel nails.  Horrible, horrible experience.  There is a reason this salon was empty.  My recommendation is to forego the convenient location and go somewhere with better customer service and techs that are not so lazy as to do the procedure correctly.

We were looking forward to the same great bbq we had at a catered function a while back.\n\nWow, we were not just disappointed, we were disgusted.\n\nWhen we got there, there were maybe four people in the dining area eating and there was no one in line.  The very unattractive woman at the register didn't welcome us, didn't ask if we had any questions, she just stared at us.  After a short time the phone rang and she turned away from us to answer it without a word.\n\nWhen she finished the call she turned back to us without a word, fortunately my wife and I had decided on our order.  I gave it to her and paid her, and we finally we able to exchange words.  She handed me the credit card receipt and said, \"sign here, the pens are there\" and pointed to the pens by the register.  Thus ended our conversation.\n\nThus also ended the good part of our visit.\n\nWe walked into the dining area to get a table and after checking half a dozen of the tables we discovered that we were going to get to choose from the least filthy of the lot.  I went back out to the condiment area to get enough napkins to wipe the table off and sitting on the counter next to the napkins was a small bucket with a label indicating that it was filled with some sort of cleaning liquid and should not be used for or stored near food.\n\nWe got the table sort of cleaned off and sat down to our pulled pork sandwiches.  Aside from the fact that there were pieces of pork in my wife's sandwich that were burned badly enough she couldn't chew them and the paper that the sandwiches were served on in the plastic trays was so flimsy if you attempted to cut the sandwich you ended up with a fork full of paper with your bite of sandwich, the meal was, at best, mediocre.  Oh, and the floor looked like it hadn't been swept, let alone washed in a week.\n\nAs we were leaving my wife mentioned that she had to use the restroom, but if the tables were that filthy she didn't want to find out what your restroom looked like.\n\nI can't think of a reason that would bring us back to Honey Bears, except maybe if the Restaurant Impossible guy does a show there.

Greatly, greatly, disappointed!\n\nI went there on a Saturday a little over one month ago.  I ordered a slab of ribs, beans, slaw, and sweet potato pie to go [wanted peach cobbler, but they were out].  I was really looking forward to some good ribs.  I arrived to pick-up my order and there was a line of three parties ahead of me at the cash register.  No big deal until the sassy young lady at the register spent 15 minutes talking and checking out the first person in line.  While I stood getting frustrated from waiting so long to just pick up food, the second and third parties in front of me left because they too were tired of waiting.  \n\nWhen it was finally my turn, I mentioned to the young lady, \"do you realize that two parties in front of me walked out because they were tired of waiting\"?  When I said this, an older lady that appeared to be the manager stopped dead in her tracks as she was walking by.  She asked the young lady at the cash register what was going on.  The young lady stated that I told her two parties had just walked out because they were tired of waiting.  The manager said, \"oh\" and went on about her business like it was no big deal.  When I paid my bill, the young lady stated, \"your food is over there,\" pointing to the other end of the counter about 6 feet away.  I asked if there was extra sauce with my meal and she told me extra sauce is always included with ribs.  \n\nI get home with my order and am ready to chow down on some ribs and the first thing I notice is there is no extra sauce with my meal as I was told.  I opened up the plate of ribs and was quite surprised when I took a bite.  I think these ribs may have been walked past the smoker at some point, but that is about all.  No smokey flavor, no smokey color, just a big disappointment.  The beans were very good, the slaw appeared to be a premade product, and the potato pie was o.k.  However, I really wanted the cobbler they had on the menu but were out of.  \n\nI admit that I am a BBQ junkie and have high expectations of such food.  But I had heard such high reviews of Honey Bears and these ribs were so bad.  I honestly ate half of the slab and tossed the rest in the trash.

However, when my husband and I met Kristin S and her husband there for happy hour a few weeks ago, I was pleasantly surprised to find out that Cheuvront also has a full bar. Unfortunately, the discounted specialty cocktails they offered during happy hour weren't particularly appealing (I tend to shy away from martinis with names like \"Grapetini\"), and the cucumber mojito I did try was way too sweet, but it was really nice to know that they had a full bar. \n\nThey also featured a small happy hour menu with 7-8 items for $5 each. Unlike some other reviewers, I wasn't that impressed with the mac and cheese (it didn't have nearly enough cheese and had none of the crispiness I usually associate with the homemade version of the dish). We also found the mini pizza to be just average (although the slightly creamy tomato sauce was delicious). \n\nHowever, the Ancho Pork Empanadas with a side of orange marmalade were absolutely delectable, and the pate was a really generous portion for the price. We also enjoyed the dinner salad we ordered off the regular menu (the shallot vinaigrette was delicious) and the Pumpkin Bread Pudding, which was a little dry but had great flavor. Our dining companions both had the Salad Niscoise, featuring ahi tuna, which looked filling but light. \n\nIn terms of service and atmosphere, we were pretty impressed. We appreciated the fact that we could sit a regular table and order off the happy hour menu, and our server was definitely available when we needed him. I also loved the urban but not over-the-top decor; there are some nice loft-like touches (slick floors, metal accents, ceiling beams) throughout that fit in beautifully with the residential Artisan Lofts that occupy the rest of the building.  \n\nCheuvront is a solidly enjoyable place to kick back after a long day of work. Although some of their happy hour food and cocktails could use some improvement, I was impressed by the atmosphere, service, and most of the dishes.

Not every visit to Cheuvront has been a 5 star visit, but over time I have come to know what dishes and wines that I prefer.   I am a frequent visitor to Cheuvront because I like the atmosphere it provides within the downtown area and it takes less than 5 minutes for me to walk there.  It provides a relaxed environment where you can enjoy wine or a cocktail and order food based upon how what you are in the mood for.  A full dinner? Sure.  Just dessert? You got it.  A small nosh? Why not.   I find myself here most often for small plates and cheese, very rarely do I have a \"regular\" entree.  It is not to say that they aren't good, they are and they are quite large, I just enjoy the variety of the menu.  \n\nMy favorite time of year at Cheuvront is the fall, as I think that their best dishes involve traditional fall ingredients such as butter nut squash and pumpkin.  This is also my favorite time to partake in their extensive cheese list.  Their international plates, while may seem expensive at first glance, are literally overflowing with cheese and meats.  Happy Hour can be a fun time, although I am personally not a fan of many of the mixed cocktails that they feature.  This works out just fine, as the wine list has many choices that I am happy to order at 25% off.  The $5 tapas offered during HH are great compliments, my favorites being the gnocchi, ceviche, and the mac and cheese.

I know other people use the same plates and silverware I'm using, but things like that, especially when noticed, are off-putting.  Unfortunately, the ahi tuna that followed was also overdone.

I don't know that I've ever been.  Give me spicy or savory 10 times out of 10 over any kind of sweet-tasting anything.  Although my dentist might argue evidence to the contrary, I really just don't have a sweet tooth.  That being said, I wanted to die and be entombed in the citrus flan that was put in front of me.  I wanted to lick the plate clean and then go back to the kitchen and demand they fill my pockets, one with the smooth, creamy, more-like-custard-than-flan flan and the other with the wonderfully sweet and subtle citrus sauce they coated the dish with.  I'd also probably ask for some of the figs and berries to be put in a doggie bag.\n\nI have never, in my entire life, enjoyed a dessert as much as this one.  I would happily drive the 20-plus minutes downtown just to have this again.\n\nBefore I forget or the keyboard shorts out from me drooling, the wine selection here is also amazing.

I have lived in CenPho for several years now and have only just tried Cheuvront in the last four months or so. I mistakenly assumed it was a pretentious wine restaurant but truthfully, it is far from it. \n\nMy first foray was at a Sunday Italian cheese tasting they held over the summer. Around $15-$18, you sampled pre-selected cheeses and had the option of ordering a wine flight with it or anything else to drink. You could also order other food. The tastings began at 3pm, and the best part was the restaurant officially opened at 4pm which began their 4-6pm daily happy hour. Yes, DAILY. Great HH selection, too, between the drinks and food. I am a fan of the one cheese plate for $5, margherita flatbread ($6, I think) and their goat cheese phyllo pockets with a balsamic sauce. God, those are to die for. On the dinner menu, we also tried a bleu cheese mac and cheese that was delicious. \n\nSince the first cheese tasting, I have been to an American cheese tasting, and most recently a Spanish cheese tasting. It was at the American cheese tasting that I discovered a favorite goat cheese with the consistency of a parmesan. Cheuvront sells their cheeses for about $1.50 an ounce which is very reasonable. I also had a fantastic red sangria that I had to stop at 2 for. So good. \n\nThe service is great, friendly, laid back and approachable. That is how I would describe Cheuvront, overall, too.

There is an outdoor beer garden seating area on the side of the building and when you walk indoors you realize that this place is airplane hanger big. Rock and roll memorabilia is plastered everywhere here with a terriic amount of Alice Cooper posters, gold and platinum records, photos, paintings, guitars, and other stuff representing his Hall of Fame career plastered throughout. Even all the tables are covered in rock photos and images. Along side all of that is a mix of sports memorabilia spread throughout with flat screen tv's and large projection screens everywhere!

This is the type of place that Hard Rock Cafe wishes it could be.\n\nThe menu here is pretty big with a mix of classic bar food, comfort food, and BBQ. Nice selection of beers on tap and in bottles. We ordered a mixed BBQ platter and it was actually some pretty decent BBQ! Great ribs and tasty brisket. Alas, what caught my eye was The Big Unit. Not just a regular hot dog, but 22 inches of Vienna Beef destruction loaded with chili, onions, jalapenos, sauerkraut, relish, tomatoes, cheese sauce, shredded cheddar, and bacon, along with a bunch of crispy fries.

Alice Cooper + play off of baseball terminology = I must go.  And whenever I think about Alice Cooper, I always think about the diatribe he went on about Milwaukee in Wayne's World, making me wonder why this place isn't in Milwaukee instead.\n\nAnyway, being a Sunday in November with the Cardinals on the road, Downtown Phoenix was more or less deserted.  That being said, I didn't complain at the fact that I had my veritable pick of free parking on the street anywhere near the restaurant that day. \n\nI was actually confused.  The Cardinals were on the east coast on this particular day, and I imagine a sports bar like Cooperstown should be a little busier for a Cardinals game, but it really wasn't.  The place is big, spacious, with tons of big screen televisions showing a myriad of \"early\" NFL games, and the place was pretty low-populated throughout the entire time I was there.  I guess MST/PST people work on a different clock when it comes to football, because the place started filling up at around 2 pm, regardless if it were after the Cardinals had vanquished the gross Eagles.\n\nNo matter, Cooperstown was a good experience for me.  Firstly, my waitress, Alisha was a total cutie, and I totally dig chicks in sports jerseys AND face paint, and I'd totally fantasize about asking her out if I lived in Arizona.  The food was a little better than what I'd have expected from a sports bar; the variety was a tad on the expansive side, but I'm glad that my BBQ plate didn't have anything that was butchered and horrible.  But the suds flowed well and I was able to enjoy several football games simultaneously.  Multiple times, I wondered why it was so sparsely populated for a football afternoon, but I suppose that could be a little bit of a culture clash from the east coaster like me coming from a football crazed area like Atlanta.\n\nOverall: Free Sunday parking, no wait, cute waitress, above average food, lots of beer, tons of football to watch and enjoy.  Would consider coming back when my baseball travels bring me back out to Phoenix for a Dbacks game or more Fall League.

With Alice Cooper's name on the door and his picture everywhere, I thought it would be a hit. I am new in town so I decided to check it out one afternoon. I went on a Wednesday for lunch and sat at the bar- they boast half-priced lunch between 11-3 and have various items half off for each day of the week. Wednesday was 50% off their salads and meatloaf. I decided to go with the Bruce Lee asian chicken salad and coupled it with a nice Pear Cider. I loved looking at all the memorabilia and the bartender was super nice. My salad was disgusting, to be frank. Limp lettuce with some canned mandarin oranges thrown on top and chicken that was cooked in the worst sauce, also strewn about and finally topped with way too much sesame dressing. When the bill came, I saw that my beer was more expensive than my salad! Not worth it.

Alice Cooperstown makes no attempt to be anything besides it's namesake. This is a place that is all about music, beer, and bar food across from a stadium. We arrived and sat outside while we waited to order. I decided to go all out and order the \"Adam Richman's\" Bases Loaded  Big Unit hot dog. This rediculous hot dog was a 22inch Vienna Beef dog loaded up with their \"nightmare\" chili, bacon, cheese sauce, sauerkraut, jalapenos, tomatoes, onions, relish, cheddar cheese, and a boatload of fries. A short while later the unreasonalby large dish arrived at our table. \n\nThis is a true foodventure statement. I do not like hot dogs. But for the love of eating and the spirit of the list, I dove right in. I will say that this was a hot dog made with good meat though after 4 bites I was pretty much over it. The toppings were intense, it was really just everything possible piled high on the dog. As you obviously determined this was a knife and fork affair and it took some time. About half way through I hit something I had never hit before, the dreaded food wall. It was time to buckle down and make this happen. It took everything I had to go bite by bite but with the cheers of Keith and Michelle, I reached my final bites. After what I would say was a half hour I downed the final bite and stood up victorious!\n\nOur time at Alice Cooperstown was fun and stomach busting but not necessarily a place I would frequent if I lived in Phoenix.

So when I get bad service, a generally OK experience becomes anything but OK. Lets buy a ticket and check out Alice Cooper'stown.\n\n~Fud/Drink~\nGeneral....bar....fare. That makes it really simple for everyone. Now they have some interesting food options, yes, but there is nothing special. Why elaborate further? Alice's joint only offers greasy fried food options, with little time put into the preparing of said items.  For a football event I went to, they were offering breakfast. I ordered a cheese/egg quesadilla which was \"edible\". Filled with grease, I had second thoughts after ordering it, but was hungry. Meh. Of the two stand out items on their menu, the 22 inch hotdog named \"The Big Unit\" is a big hit. Its big, yes....but that's where it ends. You pay $17+ for a big hotdog guys...its really nothing much to write home about. Why pay that?? If going to the Dbacks game, why not get one or two $1 dogs at Chase? Just saying... I must say the other item on the menu that stood out was the catcher's mitt brownie. For $4.99 you get a HUGE warm brownie plus a scoop of ice cream, everyone at the table was impressed. \n\nAs for drinks, they really are just overpriced. I know they have rent, I get it. But seriously, $6.50 for a draft that isn't close to a pint? Horrible pricing decision. I would've had an extra beer but this turned me off immediately. Nothing else to say, just too expensive for what you are getting!\n\n~Atmosphere/Service~\nAtmosphere is OK, it could be so much better. The inside is fun on the surface, and they have some cool memorabilia hanging up..it is nice to see what Alice put out for us to view. But overall the bar is there for large groups to gather and talk, no extra fluff. When each Big Unit comes out, an obnoxiously loud ringing bell sounds and the bar staff yells out a chant. After a good 30+ rings, I was saved by the bell when my football game ended. As for service, we were the first table to be sat, and had anywhere between 3-8 people at given times. Service was consistently slow, despite the fact the bar was at about 1/2 capacity for most of the day. I had to flag down our waitress a couple times to get service, and remember that brownie I talked about earlier? Well, it sat on our table for 2 hours after being finished. It was still on the table when I had began leaving. So, service was bad. Really hitting the nail on the head, there was no reason why we shouldn't have been waited on more, especially since we had the largest group in the joint that day. Poor service..meh.\n\n~Extras/Rating~\nOverall, its not the best option for grabbing a drink and bite before games downtown. I have made suggestions for other locations, and those suggestions stand. They get 2 stars for location and a nice array of TV's for game day. They lose 3 stars for poor service, poor price for quality, and underwhelming ambiance. They can do SO MUCH BETTER...And until they change things, you can do so much better as well.", "business_id": "oCA2OZcd_Jo_ggVmUx3WVw", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-10-03", "type": "review"}

A place that has rock & roll memorabilia all over the walls - a restaurant supposed to celebrate music?\n\nComplete and total let down. Alice Cooper, you should be ashamed.\n\nThe venue didn't even bother to take the time to set up tables and chairs for the parents, teachers, and sponsor supporting them.\n\nThere was basically zero wait staff.\n\nAt least half the tables in the outdoor area (where the stage was set-up) were high-tops - which would have been fine - if there were chairs to go with them.\n\nInstead everyone was sitting in those El' Cheapo $5 green plastic lawn chairs. This not only was uncomfortable, but it negated the entire usefulness of the high top tables. \n\nAt least 4 times during the 2 hours I head the phrase \"Please tip well\" and \"Please make sure you tip the wait staff well.\"\n\nThere was NO wait service - at all. You had to walk up to the counter and order. They had one poor employee trying to pick up all the empty cups/trash from a decent sized group of people.\n\nI would rather give my \"tip\" money to the kids to buy more drum sticks guitar strings than give to a place that could care less about providing a comfortable place to watch talented kids play great music. Why would I tip people who did nothing to provide their services (you know...food?)\n\nThey had the top balcony section closed - I do not know why - our group would have loved to sit up there and hear the kids.

When I first visited the restaurant, the Suns were putting their finishing moves on the Utah Jazz (84-87), and I suppose it was due to the game that business that evening was slow.  However, for me, it didn't matter.  Besides paying respect to Mr. Cooper, an episode of \"Man vs Food\" wherein Adam Richman and Alice--the shock-rocking legend himself--attack 22\"-long \"Big Unit\" hotdogs was motivation enough: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C86akA3G6rg.\n\nThe \"Big Unit\"--smothered in \"Nightmare\" Chili, bacon, cheese sauce, sauerkraut, jalape\u00f1os, diced tomatoes and onions, sweet relish, and shredded cheddar--is jaw-dropping!  In fact, upon delievery, fire alarms--shrilling throughout the restaurant--direct full attention to this behemoth as it snakes its way toward its next victim: me.  Respectfully named after the now-retired, 6'10\" Arizona Diamondback, Randy \"The Big Unit\" Johnson, this dog headlines.  At $19.99, it seems a bit steep, but I couldn't eat more than a third.  Along with the fries, it easily feeds two or three.  Divided, the cost is more than reasonable.\n\nThe \"Elaine Benes\" Big Salad, the \"Johnny 'Beef' Depp\", the \"Al McCoy\" [\"The Voice of the Suns\" since 1972] Crispy Chicken Salad, the \"John O'Hurley\" [\"Seinfeld's\" J. Peterman] Buffalo Chicken Wrap: the menu items definitely hail celebrity.  But why not?  The fare--along this guitar-lined, autograph-infused, rock-n-roll museum--is meant to be fun.  And it is.  Even though, on this evening, the locals were instead supporting their beloved Suns, I had a great time with my friends.  Cooper'stown is worth a try.\n\nI will say that it's an interesting touch that the servers and bartenders should adopt the Cooper-esque eye make-up--it's cool--but our server wasn't enthused: his bother-me-not attitude and poor service had me questioning his allegiance.  I mean, you work at Cooper'stown!  I know that between two servers and four tables, feeling as though you're in the weeds at times is natural, but couldn't you at least \"feign\" appreciation and interest?  The manager, however, checked-in on us, refilled our drinks, and asked about our visit.  I think he's quite aware.\n\n\nNote to Mr. Cooper:  \n\nWhen I was a kid, Alice Cooper album covers completely unnerved--yet intrigued--me.  I was ten, and I remember visiting our neighbors--hard rockers to the core--who had many of your LP's resting against their metal-plated, knob-heavy component stereo system in their living room.

A few blocks off the usual beaten path, surroundings became a bit dodgy and my friend suggested we turn back. We noticed a cool old building that had a painting of Alice Cooper on its side ... we figured \"what the heck\" and went in.\n\nThe industrial surroundings were bedecked with large screen televisions. The staff was incredibly welcoming and helpful. Photos and posters featuring many rock musicians were on the walls - some were autographed. The music from the large bar area made me think of crazy days - lots of Twisted Sister, Queen and, of course, Alice Cooper. Our fellow diners ranged from red-state tourists to people fresh from hair band rehearsals - it was a great mix for people watching.\n\nSomeone at the next table recommended both the meatloaf and the ribs - we got an order of each. The meatloaf was juicy and spicy, specked with veggies and with a cripsy top. The ribs were tender and tangy - cooked St Louis style. The mashed potatoes included the skins and the veggies were buttery and crisp.\n\nUntil we chanced upon Cooperstown, I was convinced there wasn't any good food in downtown Phoenix.

I have noticed that a lot of these places seem to be great concepts that serve not so great food. Take the menu of Planet Hollywood for instance, which is only a parsley flake away from being overpriced TV dinners. I guess when you can eat your food in the same room with the crucifix from the original Exorcist film or Arnold's Terminator suit why complain though, right? I do admit to quite enjoying the food at all the Hard Rocks I have been to. Current count, I think 3 or 4. I'm simple. Any place that cooks my burger right gets a standing ovation from me. Somewhere between Planet Hollywood and the Hard Rock Cafe is Cooperstown, a mash up of a sports bar and a rock memorabilia joint owned by Alice Cooper.\n\nI usually like to hit places like this a few times before speaking up but truthfully it's doubtful that I will be going back. I love the idea of this place. The service was attentive. It has a cool vibe. I take big stock in the small details though. In between beers I like to drink some water but the water was from the sewer, so a strike there. I mean, come on. Alice Cooper can't afford to have a filter? This made me glad they carry some cool micro brews. I tried something on draft called Odell Cut Throat Porter. Cool name. Even cooler taste. I'm a porter/stout guy.\n\nThe menu spans the usual for these type of places. Little bit of everything. They have cool names for their food like \"Iron Man\" nachos and \"Bernie\" Mac and Cheese. First things first, I had to try the \"Nightmare\" chili. I'm a chili nut. If a place \nserves it, I have to order it. It's a law. The bowl was on the small side but the chili was halfway decent. Nothing that made my nipples pop though. Being a carnivore of the highest order I was drawn to something called the Mike Myers \"Yeah Baby.\" Pork loin, brisket, turkey, beef hot link with barbecue sauce on a hoagie roll. For the description and price, 17 bucks!, the sandwich seemed kind of skimpy. The next morning I was actually thanking Alice's restaurant for this though. Still, for being a little pricey I noticed the portions and sandwiches being served around us seemed a bit underwhelming.\n\nI guess the big draw is a nearly 2 foot long hot dog called the \"Big Unit.\" We saw a couple of people order this and while it looked fun from another table I can only imagine how badly this would hurt the next day. A 22 dollar hot dog hardly sounds appetizing enough to be worth the agony. It's a hot dog, people!\n\nThe concept of Cooperstown is a good one. It's more of a tourist trip though. The food was okay but not worth the drive into downtown Phoenix and the hassle dealing with the parking. It was cool checking out all the stuff after we ate though. \n\nWe hit it on a week night and the place was sparsely attended. Probably more of a weekend happening and especially when there are games, as it's within walking distance of the stadium. As restaurants go, it's cool to say that I ate there but I wouldn't go back. Way too many other restaurants that are better and more convenient for me to hit up.", "business_id": "oCA2OZcd_Jo_ggVmUx3WVw", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-09-21", "type": "review"}

Either really good or really bad!  \n\nAfter scanning the menu, my daughter and I both decided to try BBQ sandwiches.  She got the Pulled Pork and I couldn't decide between chicken and beef.  Waitress said not the beef since it's unreliable and when it's bad it's really bad..... okkkaaaayyyy.  Opted for the chicken and added cheese after her recommendation and ordered my sides.  Waitress then asks me if I have any problem with bones since they often leave some small bones in on accident.  Gross!  I changed my order to a bacon cheeseburger... at $12 it better be good!  We also ordered some cheese fries to start since we were starving!\n\nFries came and they had chili on it so they were returned and the waitress apologized... No biggie.  Cheese fries finally came out and they were delicious!  A few different types of cheese on top, good crispy fries underneath.  Honestly some of the best cheese fries I've ever had!  \n\nFood came and burger was small and obviously a frozen patty.  Super disappointed they use a frozen burger patty because they charge way too much for it!  Bacon on the burger was delish though... Perfectly crispy and big pieces.  I ordered mashed potatoes and chili as my sides.  Chili was fine but not the best, I think it tasted a bit burnt so it could have been an old batch from yesterday or something.  Mashed potatoes were amazing!  Red skin potatoes and a good amount of richness in them.  \n\nI tried a bite of my daughters pulled pork sandwich and it was amazing!!  Really good BBQ sauce!  The BBQ might be what this place is known for, not sure.  \n\nWayyyyy overpriced on most of the food and the soft drinks were almost $3 each!!  WTF??  For a bar, these prices are outrageous!  \n\nAlso, the place seems really really really dirrty!  Like I am scared to know what behind the bar and kitchen looks like!  Don't touch the menus too much and definitely avoid the drink menu on the table... there are layers and layers of filth and stickiness that made me want to vomit.  \n\nI will be back at least once hoping to find some better food choices.  I am still a bit concerned over the dirty ness and the bones in the pulled chicken.  Seems more like an issue with bad management though.  A good manager would make a world of difference here.  \n\nBTW... Why are they closed on Sundays?  With football happening on Sunday and them having such a great bar with big TV's, I would think this would be a busy day for them!

Think Hard Rock plus ESPN Zone minus the corporate chain feel. They have a great patio/beer garden, open dining with a long bar and loft seating above.\n\nTIP: You're going to pay for parking. If you're able to grab street parking, then it's $3.00 for two hours. It's two hours max, so if you're planning on hanging out longer, the lot in the back is $5. On game days the lots fill up fast and cost more.\n\nOn my last trip, I met a friend for lunch. It was a non-game day Wednesday, so things were pretty quiet and we were seated right away. \n\nWe were both eyeing the Big Unit, but decided that 22 inches of hot dog was probably not a good idea. They have a basic Big Unit for $22 and a loaded one for about $27. They sound an alarm whenever anyone gets one, so it's pretty fun to watch others try to take the Big Unit down. Someday....someday....\n\nI opted for the Killer sandwich - hot corned beef, loads of sauerkraut, melting cheese and thousand island dressing served on toasted rye. So simple, yet so sublime. It was heavier on the sauerkraut than what I was used to, but the fresh bite of fermented cabbage was a nice contrast to the savory, salty goodness of the artery-blocking corned beef and cheese. I would not hesitate to order it again.\n\nMy friend ordered the Cuban sandwich. It was probably the tallest Cuban I've ever seen. He had to take some of the pork out just so he could eat it. It looked very good and he raved about it.\n\nYou get to pick two sides with your meal. We both went with fries and the nightmare Chili. The fries were excellent - better than expected. The chili was probably my least favorite part of the meal. I'll agree with one of the other reviewers in saying than it is just a touch too sweet. Anyway, when ordered as a side, you only get few spoonfuls so it's not a big deal...\n\nAs far as beverages go, they don't have a huge selection of local drafts, but they do have Four Peaks Kiltlifter, which is always a reliable go-to, especially for \"day drinking.\"\n\nAll in all, Alice Cooperstown is a great place with a ton of character and better than average bar food.

I was downtown for the Garth Brooks and it was expectably packed at Cooper'stown. The wait was about an hour, and the hostess was right on the money with that. The food was about average for the price, however the service let a lot to be desired. First the waitress accidently hit my wife in the face with the menu and just moved on. Then I was supposed to have two sides with my burger and they never came. When the food got there, I asked about my sides and was told they would be right out. After about a half hour of not seeing our server again it was time for the show so I had to get up to find our check. I again told the server that my sides never showed up, and was told that she was sorry but the good news for me was that it didn't effect the price. My thought was actually it does, because I was paying for them. She offered to get a manager, but it would take about 20 minutes for him to come over because he was helping behind the bar, because they were so busy. At that point we were over it so we just paid the full bill and headed out.\n\nAgain I understand that they were busy, but come on!!!!

The parking is easy in/out when you park in any of the parking garages surrounding the arena.  After the event, you can go to one of many bars in the surrounding area.  We'll keep coming back.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%", "business_id": "uFJwKlHL6HyHSJmORO8-5w", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-10-17", "type": "review"}

One time. Since then, I have a ton of sour grapes lying around, and US Airways is a continuous reminder of \"what used to be\"...\n\n~What to Do~\nEvidently US Airways has the best act recruiter in the state, because they get and retain all the biggest acts for musical events...and I mean the biggest acts. They of course, are the sports home to the Phoenix Suns, Phoenix Mercury, and Arizona Rattlers...They also hold periodic local events throughout the year.\n\n~The Good~\nHey, even before the renovations they did to the place 6 or so years ago, it was a fun cookie-cutter NBA stadium that fit the city's needs. Seats around the stadium all have good sight-lines, nothing obstructs views. The stadium has the ability to be switched into a hockey rink, basketball court, football field, and concert venue at any given time. It is considered the main entertainment venue in Central Phoenix due to the high-end acts provided there, and varieties of activities.\n\n~The Bad~\nWell, back to my sour grapes. I loved my Roadrunners hockey, and after the team left, the complex never took down all the Runners' signage...I was left with consistent reminders of my now defunct team for a good 4+ YEARS AFTER they left. Who is so lazy, as to not take down signage like that? Also, the acoustics in the place are not even 1/10th that of Jobing . com Arena....their music system and acoustical layout FAR exceeds that of US Airways...yet they get all the big acts because the scheduler definitely knows who they need to know....Also, the food stands suck. Really lame food. Once again, 1/10th as good as Jobing's wide variety.\n\n~The Down Low~\nIts generic to the core. I hold some great memories of America West....I still call it America West... Just like most locals will call Chase Field \"BOB\". It reminds me consistently of what used to be, all the great teams and fun times....I don't see any fun times at this place these days. They need to overhaul the amenities and provide us better quality product (both on the court and in the food areas). I probably will come to see the Rattlers play, but thats about it...I will eat outstide the arena, because the food is better and cheaper. Simple to the point. 3 stars for gigs they put on, seating arrangements, and local amenities. I miss the 90's....those were good times here... blah.", "business_id": "uFJwKlHL6HyHSJmORO8-5w", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-11-13", "type": "review"}

(I love freebies!)  Apparently, if you have a ticket to an event at the US Airways center, you can ride the Metro Valley Light Rail for free that day, starting 4 hours prior to show time, until the end of the day.  Just be prepared to show your physical ticket if asked. Concert parking is always nerve-wracking and expensive, so I was very appreciative of this stress-free option. Keep in mind, if the event runs past 11pm, the furthest east you'll be able to travel is 44th & Washington. \n\nLarge venue with an excellent sound system. Jared's (30 STM) acoustic set and Linkin Park's everything sounded amazing! Large pit area; nice for moshing.  The stage is a little weird.  I'm used to the stage extending a little further out towards the audience, but it was pretty far back.\n\nI was looking forward to trying G'rill Dogs vegan options after reading a Yelp friend's review, but they were closed the whole night. :(  There were some Mexican food options which served salsa and guac as vegan options, however, I opted for a stadium pretzel which was so hard and stale that you could stone one to death if thrown. They may want to ban those from the auditorium. I ended up throwing it, & therefore my $5 away. $6 bottled water, which did not go to waste. \n\nI don't know if I lucked up or not, but I didn't have to walk far to find a restroom.It wasn't as huge as you'd think for that size venue, but there was no line so I didn't have to wait. \n\nSecurity was in full effect and I felt safe waiting at the light rail station after midnight. \n\nAlso, when I was purchasing the tickets for this event, on the 1st day of sale, my ticket window guy was awesome!

I have never written a negative review in my life, and it takes a lot to fire me up. I have NEVER experience worse customer service or rude behavior in my life. I was prepared to spend $8,000 on 1 event, as I did last year, and I can't even get a phone call back. In September 2013, I rented out the TGI Friday Front Row suite box at Chase Field for the January 2014 Super Cross for my company's marketing event. We had 50 people in attendance and spent over $8,000.00. Just a couple months later, I emailed Alan, my contact there, and let him know I wanted the box again for Super Cross. I had first right of refusal, seeing as I let them know I wanted the box, it does not appear that I refused this at any point in time. I was recently contacted by their marketing manager Tracy and I once again told her that I wanted the box. However, when I rented this out in January, I was promised 10 seats and they ended up selling 8 of them to other visitors. I was not upset, but I needed to make sure the same thing would not happen again this year. I made it very clear to them that I wanted to go speak with them about the seating chart prior to making anything official. I was out of town for work when I received an email letting me know that someone else was interested in the suite and that I had 3 DAYS to get to downtown Phoenix and get them a check. Naturally I did not get the email until I was back in town. This was more than 6 weeks earlier than I provided them a check last year, and still more than 5 months prior to the event. Even worse is that the reason I wanted to meet with them face to face was because they messed things up last year. Knowing that I had told 2 people that I was absolutely going to reserve the suite, it is so wrong to me that the general manager Lyle made the decision to release it to someone else. I have now been trying to get in touch with Lyle, Alan and Tracy for 2 weeks. Why won't they call me back? Simple....THEY KNOW THEY ARE IN THE WRONG AND DO NOT WANT TO FACE ME. I spoke with Alan on the night of 8/22/14 and gave him some strong words. He promised me that the general manger, Lyle, would contact me the morning of 8/23/14. Well, here we are on 8/25/14 and still no phone call. \nLesson learned. These large companies truly do not care about hurting the smaller people because they will get business no matter what. These employees would not make it in the real world where they actually need to work to obtain business. \nTo add salt to the wound, we already have this event on our business calendar and ordered the marketing material for SuperCross at TGI Friday's Front Row.

This guy was so bold while another table and I were talking about his horrible attitude he walked by with a smirk on his face. Then while I was talking to his manager he walked by and laughed... I was left speechless.  \n\nI can't believe I drive all the way from Chandler in rush hour to eat here and received this type of service, really.  I have had better service at Denny's. \n\nTGIF is a large resturant chain and should invest a little to bring in servers on the off season before 5pm or at least have more bartenders like Doug that actually treat their customers decent and can have a smile on their face. \n\nFound out about a new job offer before walking in the door and then to be treated rude the whole time just killed my whole vibe.

It was a typically vacant concert at Modified like most I have been to.\n\nThis is partially do to good reason as this place is a terrible venue for a concert. The band and crowd have to be very small to enjoy a concert . The place is extremely small, the stage very low, and every spot in the venue is uncomfortably close and awkward. The band also has to be packing their own equipment because the sound there is terrible.\n\nMy worst experience with the sound there was actually a packed beyond capacity night when Clap Your Hands Say Yea and the National came. This was part due to CYHSY being one of the worst live bands in existence, part due to the frontman's god awful voice, but also heavily due to the house PA that crackled and breaked and blurted unevenly as he belted his patented cat-in-a-meat-grinder vocals.\n\nBut now in the present they are making strides to make this place less of a shithole. They finished giving the outside a slick new look with some corregated metal and some new windows. They are now switching their focus inside which means unfortunately no art right now, which is usually the best thing about going to a show there.\n\nThe two house speakers also appear to have been upgraded because the sound for Besnard Lakes (fuckin trippy man) and Starvin Hungry when combined with the bands' own equipment was great.\n\nThe other main issue of course is their complete lack of alcohol. However, I found out in an interview I had at Dial (of all places) that you can bring in your own. The guy I was interviewing with was in a band that played there sometimes and said you can bring in closed cans. (I didn't get the job by the way, don't talk about alcohol in an interview kids) Last night I asked a guy who worked there and he said the policy is that they don't allow you to bring alcohol in, but if they can't tell its alcohol they won't care. But now with the Lost Leaf and Roosevelt within walking distance you can always get a fix between sets if you don't want to bring alcohol there on your own.\n\nThis place, like many in Phoenix, reminds me of a great spot in Tucson that somehow the \"superior\" city managed to royally screw up.  In this case its Solar Culture, the Tucson arthouse/music venue where they freely and openly allow you to bring in alcohol. People go there with backpacks of booze. It's awesome. It is also much larger and taller with a raised stage and better sound system and way more art.\n\nModified gets 2 stars as a music venue. 4 stars as an art gallery.

In my previous life as a PR bitch in the private sector, I rewarded myself with libations--vodka/tonics with two limes for extra Vitamin C; vodka Collins with three maraschino cherries instead of one; cranberry and vodka because I heard it cleanses out your urinary tract; a dirty martini for those super grueling weeks.\n\nAlas, when I started to work in the public sector, still in PR, I knew I couldn't pull that shit anymore. I had to re-vamp my rewards structure and take out the \"sinful\" from \"yummy and sinful.\" That's when I discovered fro-yo...that's frozen yogurt to you all.\n\nMy co-worker took me out for coffee one day and quickly mentioned that there is a locally owned frozen yogurt shop on Washington and First Streets. She said they give hefty portions, so I thought to myself that this might just be a good replacement for my vodka concoctions.\n\nThe place is called A Touch of Yogurt, and their fro-yo is yummy to the tummy. They are pretty generous with their servings, and the toppings you choose to include in your fro-yo. And then when I did some diggin' about fro-yos, I found out fro-yo can: 1. Help to overcome lactose intolerance; 2. aid digestion of milk protein: 3. help prevent and combat digestive tract infections. Okay...fro-yo had me at \"overcome lactose intolerance...\" that's all I'm going to say about that! They change their menu of flavors...you know, to mix it up a little...keeps you guessing. But no matter what flavors they have available, I am sure that you will find one so satisfying. \n\nSo Fridays, I've officially declared Yvette's Fro-Yo Fridays. I order my \"small,\" sit on one of the outdoor tables, and stare at politicians, lawyers, bums, construction workers, delivery people, while enjoying a mouth-watering serving of fro-yo. \n\nHey feel free to join me every Friday for FRO-YO Fridays around 12:30-ish.

So just for this week...FRO-YO THURSDAY!\n\nAnyway...I give it 4 stars...because, let's face it...it might be yummy, but it still ain't ice cream!", "business_id": "uaAMGh8gMoJD4nLFzNsM-A", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-09-24", "type": "review"}

I suggested Cibo, Matt's, or Valley Pizza, and he thought of Focaccia Fiorentina.  I thought FF sucked the first time I went there but was willing to give it another try. But when we got there ol' Dally had a \"better\" idea and suggested Athenian Express.\n\nAs we pulled in, some unacceptably angry looking woman glared at him for a reason that will presumably remain unknown to us.  (Please enjoy my multimedia Yelp.)\n\nhttp://twitter.com/spirit_fingers/status/5209414090\n\nIn retrospect, I think she was our guardian angel trying to scare us off.  Inside, the place looks quaintly divey.  I asked if anything was so much better than the gyro that I should get it instead, and was told that the gyro is the way to go.  Feta or no feta?  I wondered if it was an avalanche of feta or just a sprinkling.  He puts a lot on there.  Fine, no feta.  I get the potato salad with it, and an order of spanakopita--which I ordinarily love.\n\nWe sit outside.  The spanakopita arrives.  It has little cheese and is not flaky.  Tastes kinda like shit.  Served with crappy tzatziki, which I don't think is the appropriate side for spanakopita but whatevs.\n\nhttp://twitter.com/spirit_fingers/status/5209643122\n\nNext, my gyro arrives.  The gyro meat is covered in three slabs of tomato and a mountain of onions.\n\nhttp://twitter.com/spirit_fingers/status/5209752658\n\nAs you can see, at this point I'm fearing the worst.  Look, I like onions and all, but when you leave fresh onions out in the air for too long they become veeeerrrry rowdy.  Like so rowdy that eating one would be enough to burn your mouth and render you a pariah.  So all that's left of my gyro is three slices of \"gyro meat\" and tomatoes.  And the little side cup of tzatziki that is only filled a third of the way.  The gyro meat tastes like... nothing.  I am underwhelmed.\n\nI move on to my side of potato salad.\n\nhttp://twitter.com/spirit_fingers/status/5209805283\n\nNormally mustard potato salad has a pastelish yellow hue, but this one looked like it could be seen from space.  Whatever it was, it was odorless and flavorless, so I can only assume it's some undetectable poison like polonium-123.  If I die, I leave my rapier-like wit and boundless charisma to my son, Samir.  You all can fight over the rest.\n\nAnyway, the restaurant pretty much blew.\n\nhttp://twitter.com/spirit_fingers/status/5209947387\n\nI'm not an arsonist, it was a joke, relax.

I've been both with my nephew and with fellow \"big kids\" aka adults. Every time I go, I have a blast and it's not necessary to borrow your friend's child in order to find an excuse to go. The Science Center is equivalent to some of finest science centers across the nation with their state of the art technology, interactive exhibits and activities for all ages. \n\nDuring past visits, I've enjoyed traveling exhibits like the Titanic exhibit years ago. As you entered, they gave you a piece of paper with a name on it. As you walked through the exhibit you looked for the name and learned about who the person was. Then at the very end, there was a wall full of names and you got to see if the name they gave you survived or not. Even though I was a history major in college, I learned several new facts in this exhibit and it was extremely interactive and educational with fun mixed in! \n\nCurrently, they have an exhibit called \"Forces of Nature\" where you can learn about different weather patterns, climates and how weather happens. In the middle of the exhibit you can walk up onto a stage-like area where you experience different weather patterns interactively. I won't give it away, but you could get stuck in some rainy weather! \n\nJust recently, I was giving a super secret sneak peak into the brand new exhibit launching on 9/27 called \"All About Me.\" They've been working on this exhibit for at least a year if not longer and it certainly shows! The amount of thought and energy they put into each exhibit is incredible and it's an extremely dynamic experience. Throughout the exhibit, I \"x-rayed\" a body and learned about different body parts, I entered a stomach and discovered the ins and outs of the digestive system (no pun intended) and there was even an intestine slide to take a ride down. I placed my hands hands on a censored area and a drum beat to the rate of my heart! Needless to say, the exhibit excited me and while I definitely am still a kid at heart, it was the adult in me who couldn't wait to come back and explore some more. \n\nBefore I go, I want to share some other favorites that the Science Center offers...the Imax and Adults Night Out! They have a state of the art, full size Imax theater on site and they show movies like Under the Sea. I am a big fan of the Imax and have been swept away into different worlds many times here. Adults Night Out is just that, where you can explore the exhibits, attend an Imax show and have a fun night out sans any children! I also heard a rumor that they might be bringing alcohol back during these nights!

They also offer a planetarium and an IMAX film at an additional cost.\n\nThey have four floors of exhibits to explore, to get your hands on stuff, and to learn at your own pace.\n\nThe first floor has the WONDER Center or the Walton Optimal Neurological Discovery Education and Research Center. Here, anything and everything you wanted to know about the human brain can be found here. They have several videos. On the other end of the floor is an exhibit all about the human body. My favorite portion here is an actual video showing an open heart surgery. Also, you can get on a wheel chair and burn some calories.\n\nOn the second floor, there's an exhibit related to electricity and magnets. Most of the stuff here are have some sort of personal interaction so you can actually see the electricity as how you produced. My favorite here is the bed of nails. You get to actually lie on a bed of nails.\n\nMy favorite of the whole museum itself is on the third floor with the Forces of Nature exhibit. They have a simulator right in the middle where you can get to experience a tornado, hurricane, rain, volcanos and other natural disasters in 4D. Yes, you'll get wet. They also have a globe where it shows the most recent weather patterns, earthquakes, active volcanos and fault lines. So you're seeing real data as it happens for people to see and interact.\n\nFinally on the fourth floor, is the \"Solarville\" exhibit.

Unless social sciences counts, in which case, I have a bachelors degree. My boyfriend on the other hand was raised by two Phd holding physicists and studied electrical engineering in college. He has weird accelerometer-type machines in his garage and has conversations that would make the cast of the Big Bang Theory proud. Kudos to the Arizona Science Center for offering exhibits that appealed to the both of us.\n\nWe started on the 4th floor at the Solarville exhibit which focused on energy, the environment, and conservation. It talked about individual household energy usage, and ways to reduce environmental impact. The 3rd floor had the Forces of Nature and Technology exhibits, which both offered interactive and informative displays. The 2nd floor was all about electricity, so naturally my electrical engineer bf showed off his knowledge. The coolest part of the museum for me was the first floor at the \"All About Me\" exhibit. It covers the systems of the human body and even has a stomach you can walk through and a giant nose that blows out objects. The neuroscience portion was very interesting, and I enjoyed taking the interactive memory tests.\n\nAdmission was $14, not including special exhibits or films. We had a limited amount of time and didn't get to check out any of the extras (IMAX film, planetarium, pirate exhibit). We saw almost all of the museum in 2 and half hours. We were there in the early afternoon on a weekday, and it seemed like most of the school groups had cleared out by then.\n\nWill definitely be back, perhaps for the Adults Night Out.

But it's all broken down so the kiddos can appreciate. In my case, THIS kiddo can appreciate the digestible nuggets of information organized into pods of focus.\n\nI can definitely recommend the Forces of Nature exhibit. It runs about every 15 mins, and takes you through tornadoes, forest fires, hurricanes, earthquakes and the extreme Arizona heat. It's all simulated with fans, water, shaking platforms, lights, and heat lamps. Pretty rad, and the kids will definitely want to do it a few times. I know I did.\n\nBe sure to check out each floor. Take that elevator all the way up. If you're antsy, it's still going to take you a couple of hours to get around to everything.

Nice Attentive nurses in Labor and Delivery\n3. Registration/Checking in is simple\n4. Parking is convenient\n\nCons\n(1) Post-Partum Rooms are old, small and run down. The bed was not comfortable. \n\n(2) During my stay, the post partum nurses were friendly but spent must time chatting/gossiping instead of being attentive to patients IMHO. \n\n(3) Resident Physicians were not a positive experience. We didn't feel comfortable in their care. Would have preferred not to have dealt with residents.  A Resident also delayed our discharge by hours by not dropping off a written prescription\n\n(4) Billing Office was difficult. They tried to make us pay for our newborn's charges which were different from the mother's charges. Newborn babies are not yet on insurance plans. And since they are not yet on your insurance, the charges are very high as you could imagine. We were not required to pay them before leaving the hospital but they certainly pressured us into paying. We went home and put our baby on our insurance plan which reduced the charges by 2/3. \n\n(5) Discharge was significantly delayed.  An ultrasound and hearing screen was ordered the previous day in the morning. They didn't do the ultrasound and hearing screen until the following day in the afternoon. These are routine tests that are usually done a few hours after they are ordered. Instead of going home that morning, we didn't leave until 4 PM.

I was expecting more of a Carolina's type atmosphere. The lady who brought us our menus and sat us was very friendly. I thought the fish pond, while extremely odd, was a relaxing touch in the center of the dining room. \n\nWe ordered a half-pitcher of margarita, some chips (since they were raved about) and it all came pretty much right away. The salsa was good, not great, but good. The red being the more flavorful, though hot, and the green being comparatively mild and bland. Margaritas were tasty, but verrrrrry weak. We went through the pitcher and wondered if they had much booze at all. I like the taste of tequila a lot, especially over margarita mix, but I could not taste any tequila in these. Then came the entrees, Chicken Enchiladas for her and Red Burro Enchilada style for me. I ate my food, as I will never leave something on my plate, but I was telling my girlfriend the whole time that it smelled like canned dog food. I didn't say this because I thought it was bad, or gross, but actually smelled identical to dog food. She agreed. I thought long and hard and today it came to me, it smelled like Pedigree brand. \n\nOverall it is a clean restaurant with great service, but unfortunately somewhat questionable food.

We choose a type of food we like, then go out and find 5 different restaurants to try that type of food from. Whichever restaurant we rank highest is where we'll go when we're in the mood for that type of food. There are 4, sometimes 5 of us so the winning restaurants get a nice sale each time we go out. I let the cashiers/owners know about our contest up front so they know we'll be back (plenty) if they win. We've done Gyros (Z's Greek wins), Burgers (Chicago Hamburger Company wins), and now we're doing hard shell tacos.  \n\nToday we tried Rosita's place. I walked in and let the lady know about our contest. She asked what restaurants we planned to try then mentioned that we shouldn't include franchise restaurants because their food will be cheap and sub-par and cannot touch a family restaurant like hers. I appreciated her opinion. \n\nI started my order by asking if I could substitute one of the ground beef tacos in the combination plate for chicken and was given an emphatic NO. She said it costs them extra for the meat so it was only fair to charge us extra. So, I kindly paid an extra 2.50 to get a machaca and chicken taco in my combo and continued the order. I asked for mild salsa with one pair of tacos and was told \"we have red and green and everyone will get both\". 4 of us ordered a total of 8 tacos, 1 combination plate, and an order of chips and salsa. Total sale was around 33 bucks.  \n\nI get back to the office and hand out the food and this is when we realized that we got CHIPS AND HOT SAUCE, not Chips and Salsa which was a very unpleasant surprise. Many of the chips were chewy and soggy and we threw most of the bag away because of this. I expected white meat in my 3.00 chicken tacos but received dark, greasy meat. I thought a family restaurant will always provide quality meat?? The machaca was so overloaded with grease that the lettuce turned gray and slimy and the hard taco turned soft and mushy. I literally had to POUR the grease out. The chicken was flavorless and we didn't get cheese on any of the tacos. Let me guess, only fair they charge extra for cheese?? \n\nNot all of our tacos were as bad as mine but we all expected better flavor, cheese on our tacos, white-meat chicken, the ability to mix and match taco choices, and salsa with our chips; after all, a family restaurant will always be better quality than a franchise, RIGHT? The beans and rice were pretty good and while I do like my hot sauce hot I feel they substitute flavor with spice. \n\nAll in all, I give Rosita's Place 3 out of 1000 stars (for the rice and beans and that's sad). I also found it offensive and absurd that they would openly slam on franchise restaurants when a Filiberto's or Chipotle taco blows the doors off of Rosita's Place. All of us agreed that this place would be at the bottom of the list come time to choose a winner. This is obviously not saying any other entree they have is just as bad; I'm only discussing their tacos. I was waiting all week to get some good tacos and am highly disappointed.

We decided to drive across town and try it based on the Yelp reviews and it was definitely a letdown.  Not horrible but not particularly good either.\n\nOn a Friday night at 7:30, it was less than half full. The people at the door were not particularly friendly but little did we know that it would go downhill from there.  Our waitress was one of the most surly servers I've ever had anywhere.  No greeting, no smile, no eye contact.  Just a look of pained exasperation.  We asked her a few questions and she simply ignored them.  It was not busy.  Seriously, the unfriendliness of the staff here is hard to overstate.  They just don't give a damn.\n\nThe food was all over the place.\n\nSalsas - excellent, both red and green. Nice and spicy just like we like it.\n\nChips - fresh, but greasy.\n\nChicken enchiladas in mole sauce - quite good. Humongous portion.\n\nSteak Tampiquena  - just ok.  Not really a traditional Tampiquena.   About four ounces (or less) of pounded round steak with no topping of any kind.  Not bad but a bit pricey for the eleven bucks or so they are asking and not up to the standard that you get at most Mexican joints around town.\n\nBeans - Awesome, as many reviewers point out.  Some of the best refried beans I've ever had. By far the highlight of the meal.\n\nGuacamole -  Overwhelmed by the flavor of what I can only guess to be powdered citric acid instead of fresh lime juice.  Very odd and not really nice at all.  What kind of Mexican restaurant doesn't use fresh limes?  \n\nMariachis - insistent and annoying.  And a bit much for a place like this really.\n\n$35 with two cheap drinks and a totally unwarranted tip.", "business_id": "hWhVP-28LYP3llaMlAJ_JA", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-09-15", "type": "review"}

I walked in 30 minutes before the salons closing and the women available was more than happy to help me. She took her time and my haircut looked amazing! I decided to take a friend who had hair down to her waist. She was also wanting to donate her hair and get a new look. I was excited because my first experience was excellent. I made an appointment for 5 pm on a Friday for my friend. \nWe walk into the salon and we were a little early. My stylist told us she would be with us in a few minutes. The problem is that when I walked in my heart sank. The stylist I wanted was doing somebodies color. It didn't look like she was too far into it either. It was also about 4:45. Ok, no big, I assumed she would be able to juggle both clients. 20 minutes later the girl looking bored behind the counter (Miss Greeter Ray O' Sunshine) tells my friend to go to a groudy looking sink in the back of the dark salon. I didn't know you can wash someones hair well in 2 minutes. She allows us to hang in the back of the salon and both stylists (only two were working that night) are still going strong on their clients. 20 Minutes later \"Miss Thang\" moves us from the back of the salon to a chair. 10 minutes later the stylist (who by the way keeps calling me the wrong name and won't stop gossiping about other clients and their lives) starts in on my friends hair who is a nervous wreck at this point. She cuts it just below her ears. Fine. She starts in on styling. Ok, we're finally going somewhere. She stops. Crap. She tells us she needs to work on her clients coloring \"real quick\". 20 minutes later she is back to my friend. To top it off, I don't know what the deal was but there were flies all over the salon. Then from out of nowhere the stylists son starts going off the handle. Here we go!!! No idea where he came from but he started throwing a tantrum like I've never seen thrown before. I mean this kid was grabbing things and throwing them! The stylist left my friend to go and tend to her spawn. Totally fine. Evil happens. 45 minutes later, the other stylist had to finally take over. My friends hair is completely dry and I am both upset and embarrassed that I had recommended we go to \"El y Ella\". My friend was being totally cool about it and all I wanted to do was make like goop and slither under a door and go far far away. Meanwhile the stylists kid is still going in a back room where she eventually had to drag him away to. I mean, you can hear thumping and bumping on the wall. I don't know about you but after 45 minutes my mama would have thumped and bumped on my behind. Actually, there would have been no 45 minutes!!! The stylist finished up my friend and all we wanted to do was just go. The stylist finally comes out from the back of the salons dungeon apologizes \"Sorry Melissa\". Obviously, no tip was left, I didn't care to fight to get half off on a haircut or whatever. We left 2 hours later. Mind you, the haircut came out looking lovely. But first you may have to almost get a toy car chucked at your head for it.", "business_id": "gZJmtLYGNLoAFU82XjJ75g", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-09-25", "type": "review"}

I figured if I leaned on the late side to eat, I'd find a parking spot. Sure enough. Word to the wise: Late lunch here = good idea, indeed. \n\nI entered through the back, where the outside patio is, and walked right up to the counter to order. On the wall hung a big blackboard. I read it, half-confused, expecting more than just one wrap offered. I panicked for a half-second, since I was hungry for the Who's the Turkey, thanks to Sarah G's review. \n\nThe friendly guy behind the counter must have read my expression. He handed me a freshly printed menu. Brand new, he said; they debuted yesterday. Ah-ha. \"I've never been here,\" I admitted shyly. I looked back up at the board on the wall. \"Ah, that must be the special...\" I said half to myself and half to him. \"If only I could read vertical.\" He laughed. On the board in chalk was this word:\n\nS\nP\nE\nC\nI\nA\nL\n\nI ordered the Who's the Turkey, without onions, with a side of fruit. For there. All for $7.50. Nice. I grabbed the Styrofoam cup handed to me and walked over to their \"drink station\" to get water and ice. I then took a seat near the counter. Plenty of spots to chose from. The place was half-full. Very cool. I picked up a couple free mags to peruse: Java and Urban Affair. Right on. Then I noticed them: stacks and stacks of Styrofoam cups. Weird. I figured a place like this wouldn't want to harm the environment. They even have a recycle-only bin near the trash. I was perplexed... and disappointed. I hate Styrofoam. For that alone, this place gets docked a single star. (I don't want to feel like I'm harming Mother Earth if I stop to eat here. I may bring in my own bottled water next time.)\n\nMy food arrived after a short wait. Beautiful. The fresh fruit came in a mini-cup (made of Styrofoam, of course) and was filled with red grapes, orange slices, pineapple wedges, strawberries and the best cantaloupe I think I've ever had. \n\nThe wrap was divine, too. I nibbled happily in my chair, so thrilled that I took a break from the office to get lunch here. I had almost changed my mind, but I'm SO glad I didn't. If I lived nearby or worked closer, I'd come here often. Like 3x a week often. I'd coerce friends and co-workers to come with me.

I've been there twice now during my \"I've got to get the F out of Tempe this second or I may actually shoot someone\" moments, and was pleasantly surprised on both occasions.

My immediate thought was, \"if all the rooms are non-smoking, that means that EVERY SINGLE ROOM is a smoking room.\"  When we got to our room, I couldn't tell if the room stunk or it was just a lingering of the lobby smell on my skin/hair/clothes.  Short on time due to an unscheduled but enjoyable stop at A & R Bakery & Deli in Blythe, we quickly changed our clothes and headed out to attend the event that brought us into Phoenix in the first place.\n\nAfter a wonderful evening with family, we returned to our room.  It was immediately obvious that we would NOT be able to sleep in the intensely smoky smelling room.  I could not even take off my shoes since the carpet had white crusty spots in between the beds.  (Don't even make me THINK about how that occurred or why it wasn't cleaned!)  I called the front desk and the young girl on duty was extremely sweet and apologetic.  She moved us to a new room which was MUCH cleaner and less stinky than the first.  If she hadn't moved us, or if the new room hadn't been so much cleaner, I think I would have just packed my poor mom into the car and made the 6 hour drive home!  \n\nMy advice to Phoenix visitors, avoid this place.  Smokers might not mind the stench, but non-smokers will notice the smell even in the \"clean\" rooms.

They have great freshly made tortillas, but the filling for the Vegetarian is pretty bland if you ask me. A friend got a Carne Asada burrito and he said the meat was pretty fatty. They have an interesting selection of tamales but they've all been kindof bland as well. The tacos have always been the best, but it's pretty hard to screw up a taco.\n\nBut they have a whole bunch of unexpectadly weird dishes for a cheap counter service Mexican place like Potato tortas and aforementioned large tamale selection including fruity tamales that make it so you can have something different every time you come. \n\nBut my favorite part is getting something from the bakery after the meal. Check out the pic on their website of their selection, it is very impressive. The highlight for me is the carmel filled churros, which when served fresh, will make you see God.\n\nThey have  a cool market with hard to find tools to make your own Mexican feast, a meat counter, and rockin' Horchata too.", "business_id": "apCfJVnRyaw6oVUBKujpUQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-09-14", "type": "review"}

My carne asada torta was really satisfying, smeared with guac, grilled onions and juicy beef on a nice, crunchy roll.

Prices are great too - I got two tacos and a burrito for about $12.  I also love the huge charcoal grill in the middle of this place, although it does fill the restaurant with smoke on occasion.\n\nWhat I ate:\n\nLengua taco - super tender and fantastic.\nCarne asada taco - extremely flavorful and just really awesome.\nChile relleno burrito - a MONSTER made of delicious.  The only reason I was able to eat this and two tacos is because I'm a fatass - I'm pretty sure a normal person couldn't even finish the lone burrito.\n\nI also tried a bite of someone else's fish taco and it was awesome.  Most places deep-fry their fish for tacos, but La Tolteca grills it, which gives a different flavor and texture that is absolutely fantastic.\n\nThe salsas are also really fresh and delicious.  Even though I prefer spicier food, the mild salsa verde was very flavorful and delicious.  The salsa habanera had a good kick to it and satisfied my craving for something hot.\n\nLa Tolteca is awesome, and it's unfortunate that I didn't find it until after I moved out of Phoenix.

It's not everyday that I find a restaurant that I absolutely want to be a regular at, but La Tolteca is a restaurant that I can see myself having a healthy relationship with, and, if I'm lucky, possibly growing old with. I'm all for market-style restaurants, and La Tolteca seriously nailed it!\n\nOkay, now that that's out of my system, here's what I tried: I tried the chips and salsas, huevos rancheros and the chilaquiles. The chips were fresh as can be (still warm in the bag), and the salsas...oh the salsas...they were all great, but the stand out had to be the habanero. It was definitely one of the best salsas I've ever had, and my girlfriend considered it the best she had ever had. That's not to be taken lightly because we eat salsa almost religiously. Because my girlfriend got the chilaquiles, I went with the huevos rancheros. They were piping fresh and everything one would expect. The second I cut open the yolk of the egg and saw the yellow and red run together, I knew I was in for a treat. The flavors of that mixed with beans and a little rice were really great! For those of you that have had good huevos rancheros before you'll know what to expect. Alright, and lastly the chilaquiles. In all seriousness, these were the best, and I mean the BEST chilaquiles I've ever had! I'm not sure exactly what was going on in the kitchen, but I suspect a tiny sprinkling of crack right before it was served to us, but that may have just been the garlic. Either way though, it was phenomenal! Every single bite made me so happy, and even after everyone was full at the table, we still managed to pick away at it until it was completely consumed.\n\nEvery person reading this needs to do themselves a favor and endure the trip to Central Phoenix for this place.

I ate there for a long time just because it is the closest Asian restaurant, but really the food could be better.... OK, it could be a lot better. A long time ago, I used to love their frog legs, but now they are so bad I cant even tell you. The abundance of sauce ruined the crispiness of the frog legs. I was so disappointed!\n\nThey raised their prices by 50% or more on some dishes & sides. Some of the prices have almost doubled. For example, the small rice was $1. Now, it's $1.50 extra. The large was $2. Now, it's $3.50.  It is something stupid but still annoying.\n\nAlso, it is hard to order food from them over the phone... To tell you the truth I sometimes have trouble ordering food from them there because they dont seem to be able to communicate very well in English. And you always have to double check your order.\n\nThe food is inconsistent.  It's not great but it's food and still fairly inexpensive. I wont bother eating there again because their food keeps getting worse & worse. I have had 2 friends get sick from their food. Watch out for their chicken! My friend said he got undercooked chicken from this place.\n\nAlso, They wont give out copies of their to-go menu with the new prices on it. So you kinda just have to take their word for it on the new prices... It used to be a place we went often but it's getting to the point that I'm kinda just over this place.\n\nYah, the more I think about it, I'm way over this place.", "business_id": "ykfTh6HI219NoMsWBxulxw", "stars": 1, "date": "2008-10-22", "type": "review"}

Yes, I said it, Its garbage.  Its a semi formal dining hall serving bland white meat chicken in a variety of sweet and sour sauces.  Restaurants like PF Changs exist, so that people don't have to motivate their taste buds to explore further reaching foods, especially Asian cuisine.  \n\nThen there is the Gourmet House of Hong Kong, masked in an entire ideology against Chain/Bad Chinese restaurants.  To say this is a \"hole in the wall\", would be an understatement of epic proportions.  Found on the corner of right around 10th street and McDowell, this inconspicuous dining hall stands, ready to show anyone who will listen, what true Cantonese cooking is. \n\nUpon entering, do not be scared. No, it is not travertine tile, elaborate fish tanks, black napkins and the playmates of the month serving you your food.  Yes, that is really just a plain circle table with a white paper napkin and some soy sauce and chili oil containers. Yes, the restaurant is old and beaten up.  Yes, that is the smell of fish in the air, do not worry, in around three visits you will be swooning for that sweet aroma to come to your table.\n\nNow lets talk about what matters.  THE FOOD.  Hands down, the best noodles in Arizona.  I recommend the shrimp chow mein.  It is a bed of soft egg noodles, crunchy on top with at least a dozen U-20 size shrimp and baby bok choy resting on a delicious sauce.  I could have this dish by itself every other night of the week and for ten dollars, I might as well.  The wor wonton soup is a deep flavorful broth, filled with not just one piece of broccoli and a few wontons, but swimming with shrimp, beef, chicken, vegetables and wontons.  The crispy dry noodles are a great accompaniment to the soup and are always on the house.  Want to try something different? How about a \"scramble with shrimp\".  This is just as it sounds, a Cantonese variation of egg foo young, that is a medium bed of fluffy scrambled egg with shrimp and green onion mixed in, just phenomenal.  Right now they are serving 1.5-2 pound lobsters for eighteen dollars. That's a ridiculously great deal for such a large lobster. They will make it any way you want, I recommend steamed with black bean sauce and green peppers.  \n\nI could go on and on and about this place, but I will stop here.  Let it be said though, if you are looking for atmosphere or a contemporary hip restaurant, this is not your place. If you are looking to get down and dirty and eat some real Cantonese cuisine, you will not find a better place in the valley.", "business_id": "ykfTh6HI219NoMsWBxulxw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-09-19", "type": "review"}

You not only get a great view of the chef doing the cooking but have a nice fat fan behind you to cool you off.  \n\nWe arrived shortly after it opened and chatted with the cook to get his suggestions on what to order.  Very friendly and funny.  The counter's got various coffee table books full of quotes and handy worst case scenario answers.  \n\nI had the Garfield which was a fried egg sandwich specialty.  I can't really recall all the ingredients but the salsa in the sandwich was amazing.  My girlfriend ordered the grilled cheese and it was knock out.  Prepared with olive oil, it was by far one of the best grilled cheeses I've ever had.  The french fries were done just right and the seasoning on them really hit the spot.  The total for both of us including a couple of ice teas was under twenty dollars.  A great deal anywhere.\n\nJust a friendly reminder that it is CASH ONLY!  I had to run to a couple of nearby gas station ATMs since the first was out of order.  Pretty embarrassing but the chef didn't seem to mind and trusted us to return.  Can't complain about any part of the meal and would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Phoenix or any locals that have been snoozing on this gem.", "business_id": "tb24fvNJfHhyKEXkKn12Xw", "stars": 5, "date": "2007-09-04", "type": "review"}

Outside of the Five & Diner franchise, I hadn't been to anything resembling an authentic diner in the Phoenix area.  Ever.  So what a surprise to find an old diner transplanted from back east into the downtown Phoenix area.  It's a little on the fringes as the immediate neighborhood is a little sketchy, but we were going for a late breakfast on a Saturday so I didn't worry too much about my car.\n\nThe diner itself truly is a timewarp.  The interior is a simple 9 stool diner with a cooking area just as tiny.  You can't help but converse with the waitress and the cooking staff since they're basically right in front of your face.  If you're looking for more room (and want to keep an eye on your ride), there's picnic tables with umbrellas outside.\n\nWe got here around 11am so my girlfriend and I didn't feel too self conscious ordering drinks.  I got the mimosa while she got the bloody mary.  I'm not sure what they put in those drinks, but they had some kick!  They weren't overtly alcoholic, but just spicier than other mimosas or bloody marys I've had.  As for the food, I came here for one thing.  A biscuit sandwich.  More specifically, the Big Jim.  Fried chicken, country gravy, bacon, and cheddar on a homemade biscuit.  Unreal.  The biscuit was flaky, buttery heaven.  The batter on the fried chicken was delicious and the gravy wonderfully hearty.  Easily the best biscuit sandwich I've had in the Phoenix area.  My girlfriend got the Andouille Scramble which was basically an omelette with andouille sausage, peppers and onions with a side of potatoes.  She saw how much I loved my biscuit so she added a biscuit with honey to her order and was equally impressed.\n\nWe so wanted to save room for the beignets, but we were stuffed.  Total for the two drinks, two entrees, the add-on biscuit, and tip came to about $40.  Had we done non-alcoholic drinks it would've been a little under $30.  Their ingredients are locally sourced so you pay a little bit of a premium for that.  But considering the quality of the food and the unique experience, it was money well spent.

There is a sense that they want you to have a great experience while you enjoy eating.  \nIt's got some super items on the menu and they are working on creating a full bar.  They have large multi seat tables that look similar to picnic tables outside under umbrellas so there is more seating of the weather is good.\nThere are several items on the menu I will return to try but on this particular trip, our first, we had the Holy Puerco & the Peanut butter Bacon Cheddar Burger.  Both were amazing.  I felt a bit like I was back in New Orleans with the fried cheddar grit cake, cracklins, & Crystal sauce.  Not to mention the burger reminds me of one of my favorite burger joints in NOLA, Yo Mama's Bar & Grill. They also have a Peanut butter Bacon burger.  \nI like the list they have on the wall behind the counter that names all the local businesses they purchase there produce, meat, and goods.  It shows the intent to buy local and support other local businesses.  \nI will be back, I witnesses the making and devouring of a sandwich named Big Jim, a fried chicken breast, country gravy, bacon & cheddar on a large homemade biscuit.

With just a few counter seats inside the trailer that houses this diner-style joint, you may want to order through the window and post up at one of the many outdoor tables, especially if you're with a group. Try a cocktail to start while you wait for your order - they're strong but delicious, typically served in mason jars or goblets, which matches the laid back vibe of the place. \n\nThere are a number of great dishes here, but among the best are the Fried Green Tomato sandwich and the poutine. The tomatoes are perfectly fried, light and crispy, with greasy flavor enhanced by the slightly sweet zest of corn relish and the subtle heat of chipotle sauce. Served on toasted local bread, it's got just the right amount of crunch and flavor. Plus, it's unlike any sandwich you'll see on other menus around town. The poutine is also a must-try. Served with country-style gravy and perfectly distributed melted cheese on top of thin, crispy fries, it's not a traditional poutine but one of the most delicious versions in the Valley. If gravy's not your thing, the fries are just as delicious on their own. \n\nOther highlights include the fried chicken sandwiches, which come in a number of variations featuring ingredients like honey, country gravy, and buffalo sauce. Although the biscuits they're served atop can be a bit dense, the chicken is perfectly moist and flavorful and never too greasy. The side of watermelon completes this southern-themed dish. And, if you're a burger lover, try one here. The meat is well-cooked with great flavor and the patties are perfectly portioned. \n\nThe service at Welcome Diner is casual but friendly and efficient. You'll get real attentiveness at the counter and maybe some small talk. Don't expect anything too formal - this is definitely a neighborhood joint, but you can tell the staff takes pride in their place of employment. And why wouldn't they?

It is completely in the middle of no where ... and in fact, for a minute or two as we were driving down Roosevelt St, we really thought that Siri was getting us lost. We got to the diner at the perfect time, however, because they were just turning on the lights and the small outdoor restaurant space was illuminated, making for a perfect setting to enjoy a Saturday night meal.\n\nAs far as the food goes, I left thinking, \"yes, fried chicken, absolutely delicious ... Everything else? Well, it was just alright.\"\n\nWe ordered two Hurricanes for drinks and a Bumblebee, a Big Jim, and the Poutine Fries for our meal. It was still happy hour (goes from 3p-7p ... pleasantly surprised that it was also on a Saturday), so the Hurricanes and Poutine Fries were $6 each (instead of regular price, $8). The Hurricanes were tasty but after a few sips, it kind of tasted like orange juice & liquor (not complaining, just saying it wasn't anything fancy). The Poutine Fries, in my opinion, had too much gravy but my date enjoyed them. I kind of wish we would've just gotten a plate of their regular fries because the fries themselves were really good. Their sandwiches were of course huge, very messy, and a little difficult to eat, but the fried chicken with the honey on the Bumblebee was so tasty, it was worth it. I removed the chicken off the biscuits and the biscuits were ignored; also, I thought that the honey mustard was unnecessary and I'm not a huge fan of pickles so I picked those off too. I'd say that I really wouldn't mind just ordering fried chicken and honey next time if/when we go back. My date enjoyed the Big Jim. He liked the combination of cheese, gravy, and chicken all together.\n\nThe people who worked there were really nice and came by and asked us if everything was good. After a while though, I could feel that what I had eaten was way too heavy. In hindsight, I probably would've ventured to try the Vegan Jackfruit Po'Boy or the fish po'boy since those seem like lighter options.\n\nDefinitely a place worth checking out ...

Very disappointing to see all the customers that were in line after myself getting their orders ahead of us.

He asked what our name was and went back to check, then came back and said they have started working on it now, to which I replied, \"What were they doing for the last 45 minutes if not making our order?\" to which he had no reply.\n\nThe Welcome burger looked big and nice and I was really excited to see what I was going to get for a grilled cheese with 3 different cheeses.  When it finally did arrive, it was burnt on the outside and cool to the touch, but Scorching hot on the inside.

My friend and I walked over on First Friday after a guy recommended it to us and described it as a place with great \"comfort food.\" It's a few blocks from the more populated, business portion of Roosevelt. Since we were walking at night, it was a little sketchy given it was dark and there were barely any street lights. But the food and service were well worth the 5 minute creepy walk. Plus it made it more of an adventure ;)\n\nThis places feels like an outdoor diner, located on a residential block. You order your food at a window and then find a seat outside in the cute little lot. Despite the fact it was First Friday, the wait wasn't long at all. I think this is because, as I mentioned, it's a bit off the main strip of Roosevelt. We were able to easily find a comfortable place to sit and the service was great. I loved how patient the woman taking our order was and her enthusiasm describing their menu :) There's nothing worse than when you're excited to try a new place and the service is lackluster. This woman took her time and even checked on us later once our food arrived.\n\nI tried the crunchy peanut butter, bacon burger with pickles and cheddar cheese. I know, right?! Sounds crazy! It was highly recommended by the person in front of me in line. And just way too weird for me to not try ---and man, am I glad I did! It was SO GOOD! The flavors actually really complimented each other, especially the saltiness of the peanut butter/bacon and sweetness of the peanut butter/pickles. The bun was also fantastic and fresh. Descent beef portion too. It came with a side of fries which were cooked to perfection. \n\nI will definitely be returning. There are a bunch of other delicious sounding items I'd like to try.

By default, naked womanhood warrants an automatic 3-star baseline from me, but the slummy and desperate atmosphere in this dive is a soulsuck for all that dare enter.\n\nThe squat brick building sits all by its lonesome under a tacky illuminated \"Bandaids Show Lounge\" sign, the surrounding parking lot emanating with \"damn, I'mma get mugged out here\" uncertainty and darkness.\n\nOnce inside (yes, you go in through a sketchy looking front door that looks as welcoming as the sketchy looking service door), you're met by security and carded; the girls headed for the bar while another friend and myself were subjected to a [sub-standard*] pat down - *sub-standard: the folding knife clipped and visible in my front pocket (CA law) went unnoticed.  A printed \"no sideways caps, no baggy/saggy jeans, no long tees\" dress code posted by the door should have been a red flag. Classy!\n\nAfter getting a few beers from the pretty bartender (she was actually really, really good-looking - hottest girl on staff, setting false precedent for what the stage talent would look like), we made our way past shady regulars at the bar with their necks crook'd to the lounge, finding a couple of tables near, but not next to, the center stage.\n\nMost of us sat talking and laughing with each other, occasionally glancing at the stage just to see what's up and watching the depraved humanity of the other patrons in the place, mostly empty on a Friday night...\n... the out-of-towner business man in the dark corner, getting dances from any girl that would come his way.\n... the mouth-breather waiting with stalker-ish anticipation for a dance with one of the, er, more amply-bossomed strippers.\n... the table of youngins, dressed exactly how the posted dress code prohibited.\n\nGirl after girl (a couple of \"a'ight\" girls, most \"everyday\" girls, and at least one \"is that a girl?\" girls) came to the stage, gyrated to cliche strip club music - some exhibiting-gymnast calibre pole skills and limberness - then cruised the showroom floor, peddling their wares with a repeated-to-monotone-perfection \"...would you like a dance?  ...would you like a dance?\" propositioning. Sales Basics 101: Always Be Closing, right?\n\nNone of us partook in the festivities, but two friends in an adjoining party did.  One, quite simply because he was bored and someone paid for it.  The other, a recent migrant from war-torn and fundamentalist Afghanistan, got one of the [few] Barbie-esque dancers who would keep him entranced and occupied for 4-5 songs... and about $100.\n\nAfter a quick 30 minutes, we'd thought we'd seen the whole rotation of \"meh\" talent and skeevy behavior.  And that's when we saw it...\n...the epitome of tacky divey strip club attire...\n...the summation of the Bandaids experience...\n...that's when we saw it... \n\n...The HOOD-KINI*!\n\nIt was time to leave... quickly. As we braved the parking lot,  it was joke after FirstAid-alluding and Infectious-disease related joke. Automatic hilarity at the mere mention during the rest of our trip.\n\n\"Band-Aids\", because correlating \"possibility of infection\" and adult entertainment is savvy business sense.\n____________________\nYes, yes.

Fun facts but the coupon got me down there Saturday morning. \n\nSame old Ranch Market with shoes for sale up front, the assortment of prepared food, drink, and bakery items, and chicharones from bite size to mucho grande. I like their produce and meat selection but wish they carried salmon other than the frozen bags. Still, it was a good reminder of the shopping experiences I had before my current battles at my local Fry's and Basha's stores. I suggest we all commit to hitting Ranch Market a little more.", "business_id": "VXIkI9_EbDbYHeO9IzKjJg", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-09-15", "type": "review"}

I start filling out the form, but after trying to figure out why there's so many questions about my drug use, family life, and court mandates, I realize I must have the wrong form.

Overall, it's a pretty awesome place and you're bound to walk out with a ton of stuff. \n\nThere are 3 reasons I took off a star-- One, the hours.  They're only open M-F 9-5.   Since many people work those same hours, including myself, that makes it really difficult to get out there.  If I want to go to Ryan's it has to be a planned outing that I take time off for, which means I don't get there as often as I would like.  Second, in the summer time it gets really hot in their warehouse.  There is so much to look through that you'll likely be spending a lot of time on your visit, and this gets really uncomfortable in the AZ heat, so maybe it would be wise for them to invest in a better cooling system.  And lastly, they have a $20 minimum purchase policy.  Granted It's usually not very hard to get to $20, but if all I really want is a kong toy, I then have to scrounge around and buy stuff I don't really need to reach the minimum.  \n\nSo aside from those minor negatives, Ryan's is great.

BUt I do believe that if you have a business that is selling goods to the public that it is good business practice to stay open at least past rush-hour so that people can get off work and come in and shop.\n\nWith that said, I got to Ryan's at 4:32pm after driving from south, southern chandler (south of the Chandler Fashion Mall) and going 10mph on the highway. I walked in 2 minutes after they closed (by my watch) and didn't even think that they would be closed. I zipped into the showroom not even thinking that a pet store would be closing at 4:30 and I had the worker behind the counter yelling at me as I went in, \"excuse me sir, we are closed.\" No eye contact. No sorry.\n\nI needed one item.\n\nI used to work retail. I know how it is to have that customer come in 1 minute before you close... and 1 minute after you close. I was that supervisor that had to tell them to  hurry up or come back the next day. But I feel that I did it with courtesy and understanding in how I  ran my store and what I could do within reason. I never, ever snapped at someone and just gave them some blanket statement that we were closed and insinuated to leave without even eye contact.\n\nI am pretty sure that I wasn't the only customer there - I could have easily grabbed my item and left before they did.

I can't really judge the store itself or the prices... because I barely got past the front door. What I can judge it on is their customer service, their attitude, and their store policy.

I do understand they have hours that they need to maintain... but they could have at least been nice about it.\n\nFurthermore, there is little-to-no need for me to wreck my schedule just so I can come in and visit their store during their limited business hours.

Living in a vintage building and flush with cash, I felt it was the best prospect for furnishing my apartment. \n\nHowever after spending a few minutes in the store I felt cold, alienated and stupid,\nFor starters I was never greeted, my presence acknowledged, or even asked how my day was. The store was empty upon my arrival, and it was not until I dared to touch an item that my presence was acknowledged....albeit with a condescending and rude outburst by the stores owner. \n\nI thought the furniture was vintage and original....apparently they refinish and refurbish furniture and pass it off as found vintage. I was told by the owner that most of e furniture was recently shellacked....and was not in display condition. \n\nI also had the unfortunate experience of asking the staff about several pieces I was interested in. Between eye rolls and deep sighs I was told of the inaccuracies in my question, yet never told if I could purchase the items or not. After being deemed too dumb to engage in a conversation by the woman minding the store I was handed over to the stores owner with a sigh, an eye roll, and a rather condescending \"do you want to handle this?\". The stores owner than continued to alienate and insult me, making me feel dumb and rather small. \n\nIt seems as though the storefront is a showroom for their online sales, as most items are not for sale...and anything that is worthwhile is plastered with \"do not touch\" signage. Very unhospitable for a furniture store, as I usually like to sit in something before I purchase it. \n\nI'm not going to even go into the prices, which seem as alienated from reality as the stores owner or his assistant; two ageing hipsters locked in a battle for who could be snootier or more pretentious. \n\nAside from the nasty staff, the lack of  hospitality and the god-awfull smell inside the store I would say the store was acceptable. \n\nI'm sure this store will survive, as most online customers probably don't know that they are getting refurbished furniture stored in a putrid cat-urine smelling environment and sold by condescending belittling better-than-thou hipsters. \n\n......avoid this store, check out the wonderful vintage stores elsewhere in town.", "business_id": "xWcTt1L4vQC_QkPfPBVlCw", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-10-24", "type": "review"}

They offer a nice, inexpensive lunch menu and a more upscale dinner menu.  The service was unique meaning I did not feel like I had my own personal server slave for the time I was there.  I felt like he was somewhat stand offish, but we always had refills, etc. when we needed them.  In all honesty, it was nice to not be interrupted a million times by some disgruntled robot of a server who clearly hates their job.  So even though the service was not the typical upscale service, it was still good; it just had its own flavor.", "business_id": "5-X03Zc0nN7U5eoe8uFUdw", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-11-03", "type": "review"}

It was fairly empty and we were seated right away by a very friendly server.  Their menu looked delicious, especially the sandwiches, but since I had just survived both Pizzeria AND Pane Bianco, I made an educated decision to cut the carbs/dairy for a minute.  My friend and I split the Crabby Benedict (eggs benny with crab and avocado on a slice of foccacia)  and the Chicken Salad (chicken salad atop mixed greens, that is).  OK, so the crabby isn't technically void of carbs/dairy, but whatevs...it was a small enough portion.   I really, really loved the crabby - it was a perfect mix of flavors and textures - very nicely done.  The chicken salad I was not crazy about, however.  I think it had a little too much cilantro and another seasoning (couldn't detect exactly what) for my taste.  But it was definitely quality white-meat chicken - and they gave you a large portion of it - for only $9, so you gotta give props to that.  I pay up to $14 for salads in San Diego and they are basically a bag of romaine lettuce with a 0.5 ounce piece of chicken.

We did a double date last Friday night and when we arrived at 8pm we were one of TWO tables in the entire restaurant. The wait staff was standing around with nothing to do and when the other table finished we were the ONLY table in the place so they started breaking down -- blowing out candles, picking up the tablecloths and literally turning lights off around us. They made it very uncomfortable and the antithesis of everything this charming, quaint, place should feel like.  \n\nThe food was OK - two people in our group had the burger (decent - trying to hard with a weird mix of ingredients), pizza (undercooked, heavy and gross) and the meatloaf (the best of the bunch but still just okay). They were also very misleading with their sides and salads. \n\nAfter being rushed out of the place so they could close down and get home we went to another local bar and realized we weren't offered the 8pm-10pm Happy Hour discount on our drinks or appetizers. Should we have to ask? It's printed on the menu and assumed it would be automatically applied to our bill - which was much too expensive for what we had.\n\nOverall, a pretty uncomfortable and disappointing experience.", "business_id": "5-X03Zc0nN7U5eoe8uFUdw", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-11-23", "type": "review"}

In a mad jumble of antiquities ranging from the 20's to the 70's every item is either a conversation piece, memory or a must have.  I bought a mod 60's chappeau my baby brother picked out as being \"me\" and I am eyeing a full bonnet hair dryer the size of a rice cooker :p\n\nOnto the soda fountain.  There are egg creams, hot fudge and a toe curling number of flavor possibilities. I always want to cook up something outrageous to try but seem to drift toward their amazing executions of classic favorites.\n\nThe regular menu is exactly as it should be.  I have yet to be bold enough to try their Hawiian cole slaw (so 50's) but all of their soups, sides, etc. taste home made with reasonable prices.  I was reading through the reviews here and saw a couple mentions of split pea soup ... how is it I've never been when they've had it?!?!  I am now on a mission to go when it is being served.\n\nOn a side note, MacAlpine's serves stuffed tomotoes!  Your choice of tune or chicken salad, I imagine they'd do egg if you asked over greens and surrounded by lots of veggies, etc.  It's the kind of dish to inhale after killing yourself at the gym and you won't feel all that bad about it.\n\nP.S. Sometimes the service can seem a bit oddly timed but when you take into account the division of labor and the nature of the place it does make sense.

The shake had 5 inches of whip cream, which is great if I wanted a whip cream shake, scooped it off, as wanted to try the actual shake and that seemed to further annoy the waitress, as result took forever for her to come and remove dirty things. Shake was just okay...took my dad as thought he would get a kick out of the place.

Well, with Macalpine's, there's no illusion.  It's legitimate.  I mean, the place has been in business since 1929, which is quite a testament in a modern-obsessed city like Phoenix.  In fact, I'm not sure much has been done to the place in terms of renovations, as the business itself both looks and smells its age.\n\nI'll be honest, the food here isn't really anything to write home about.  The toasted cheese (my personal favorite) and the generously gigantic club sandwich are good, but I can't say much about their burgers and dogs.  If I only cared about food, my rating would be lower.  But we don't come here for the food - we come here for the sweets!  More specifically, the drinks.\n\nYou can request an egg cream or a phosphate.  Do you kiddies know what those are?  They'll be happy to explain them to you, if not.  But the delicious ice cream sodas are the reason for our repeat visits. There are many combinations worth trying, most notably the Velvet Elvis, Bozo, German Chocolate, Hubba Bubba, or even your own sugary concoction.   There's also a variety of sundaes all made using Thrifty ice cream, but we've never quite made it that far. \n\nIn addition to the actual restaurant, there's also a thrift store that sells various used items.  I've never bought anything, but always like looking around.  An archaic dentist chair, cigarette machine, and old school irons.  I consider the place an homage to a time when home appliances weren't all made out of plastic.  There's also a room entirely dedicated to clothing, which I often imagine is where kids take their grandparents' wardrobes after they die.\n\nService is always good, prices are fair, and you're unlikely to find another place quite like this in Phoenix.

Enjoy our Arizona Diversity\n\nHave you ever eaten a Frozfruit bar?  That is a Paleta Michoacana.  Those bars were made in Michoacan Mexico long before they met the Blue Bunny.  Some paletas beat the bunny easily.  Does your neighborhood have a Mexican (legal of course) vendor pushing a freezer chest on wheels?  They are making their $50.00 or less a day selling paletas and other frozen delights.  Coconut, one of the most delicious flavors, will keep your brain from unraveling like mine is.  Eat them early in life and often.  \n\nWhen I was 15, I had one of the most anxious nights of my life. Maria Fraga invited me to her Quinceanera.  A six syllable word I'd never heard or seen before I got the invitation.  The only question I asked was should I dress up?  My best at the time were some black chino pants I'd grown through, three inches above the shoes on my white-socked feet.  I also had a white shirt, also recently miniaturized.  I did have a tie, a one-inch wide bright green iridescent one I really liked because the color reminded me of a green tree snake.  \n\nEquivalent words in English to Quinceanera is Debutante Ball.  Parents save from the day a girl is born, there's a formal coming of age mass, everybody's in a gown or tux, and there's a giant ball at a rented hall.  Being some some flavor of Protestant, I didn't attend the mass.  I was dropped off at the rocking hard ball with the live band.  I was the only white guy.  I did not know how to dance.  My clothes were too small, my tie glowed in the dark and 100 people were dressed To The 9's.  Plus, cool Santos Ortiz was out in the crowd, dancing sua-ve with all the girls.  I did find Gilbert, dressed a little better than me.  We hung out making small talk in a dark corner.  I left within an hour.  \n\nThe night I met Cesar Chavez felt the same.  I was one of four white kids and one adult in a sea of migrant workers, nobody apparently speaking English,  The green chile, frijoles and home made tortillas nothing like the tacos my Queens New York Mom and Kansas City Dad whipped up for all the hungry kids.  \n\nIf cross-cultural situations like the above or even the potential to step into another culture freak you out, I'm here to tell you it's totally survivable.        \n\nLa Michoacana is a great place to dip your toes in the water.  I've seen it walking up and down 16th Street, but never went in.  The outside has a sleek traditional Mexican exterior, the inside is Mexico.  My stop was for water and an investigation.  I found an inviting, artful interior I was not allowed to take pictures in.  Mural copyright or something I suppose.  \n\nFood is served, shave ice is served, plus a variety of raspados, which you should try.  Fresas con Crema, fresh strawberries in cream will shoot your socks to the other end of the room.  The water was excellent, saving me from a dehydrated afternoon on the mean streets of Tempe.

Since she was quite clear that she didn't follow up with patients after surgery, I chose to seek treatment from a REAL doctor who is skilled and professional.

Only one seafood entree (fish tacos) on the entire 4 pg card was less than $12, and that included soups. I didnt really want to settle for fish tacos in a lauded casa de mariscos.  \n\nEntrees come with complementary ceviche tostadas, which was a nice surprise.  My son had the house specialty,  camerones culuchi, and I tried a flash-fried whitefish, served whole with sides, for 15 bucks.  We agreed the green culuchi sauce bathing six shrimp was instantly forgettable. My fish had about 150 pin bones and less meat than a small can of tuna fish. That's not an attempt at humor. I can debone a fish and there was less meat on this crispy carcass than a standard 6 oz can of tuna, as if they extracted most of it for their own devices, leaving me with little more than skin, bones and an eyeball.  \n\nIt's hardly a crummy place on the inside - the decor is cute and colorful.  Service seemed friendly, if a bit confused, and having grown up in New England,  I'm aware seafood can be pricey.  That said, after tax and tip, we spent $40 for one meh and one pretty craptastic lunch, in a hole in the wall just south of Roosevelt. \n\nJudging from the other reviews, it sounds like we just came at a bad time, but that doesnt help me get my forty dollars back.

However, my aunt and I read some reviews and used our best cajoling to get her out of her mu mu and into the car to visit this little restaurant just down the way from Ranch Market. \n\nWhen we walked in, I was excited by the colors and festive feel that they have. We were greeted by the owner who is very attentive, and seated straight away. Having read the Yelp! reviews, I knew I was going to aim for the camarones culichi, and gazed at their vast options anyhow. I consider myself pretty seafood savvy! They have such an array of fish dishes that I long to try! Especially their fish soup... it looked amazing. However, I stuck to my trusted reviews and ordered the camarones culichi, my mother ordered the garlic shrimp, and my aunt ordered the fried fish filet. \n\nI know they said not to fill up on the chips and salsa-- but that green salsa made me so happy, I think I will order a pint to take home next time I go. Trust me. \n\nFirst, they brought by little ceviche tostadas to try-- I was so excited that the fish tasted so fresh and delightful. Also, free ceviche? I have no idea if they do this all the time, but what a deal! It had a chipotle and citrus flavor immersed in it and was light, but very satisfying. \n\nThe culichi sauce is full of tomatillo, cilantro, garlic, and lime-- however, their combination is so magical, I cannot express it without salivating. The shrimp are cooked in the sauce and brought out separate from the salad, beans, and rice, and they have the same amazing taste. I will seriously write a poem for how that sauce tastes-- and they give you plenty of fresh tortillas that I wrapped the beans and rice with and dipped in that sauce to ensure I got every last drop. You could taste the freshness of the fish even in the fried fish, which was seasoned and fried to perfection. The \"exquisite salad\" that they offer with every meal really is exquisite, while simple and melds to the meals well since there isn't a strong dressing on it. \n\nThe point is, we left so amazingly joyful and thanked the owner about ten times.

Our check for 2 people was $60. We both had 1 drink and 1 entree and split an appetizer. \n\nThe rating is highly influenced by the total price of the experience.\n\nOn to the food-- the ceviche was OK at best, it was comprised of 90% pico and 10% shrimp/fish. I've had ceviche from several dozen places and I'd have to rate this ceviche in the bottom 3 : /\n\nThe 'Camarones Fantasia' were very dry (over fried a little) and small for an order/the price. It came with 6 medium sized shrimps and should have been at least large or jumbo so as not to become so dry while cooking optimally. Ironically enough, I thought the actual taste was not terrible, but I could not describe them as \"succulent\" by any means.\n\nThe 'Camarones de Ajo' were very good but lacked some flavor that should have been there and that has been present in other Ajo dishes I have sampled throughout the US and Mexico.\n\nThe drinks were AWESOME! The micheladas were very great and by far the best part of the meal. However, they were the most expensive I have ever bought (40% more than the most touristy of spots in Mexico, which if you understand, is saying a lot!). \n\nI'm quite confused how they can charge so much for the drinks and dishes here.\n\nThe experience was not \"bad\", but its certainly not a place I will return to anytime soon.\n\n3 stars is the best I can give this place.", "business_id": "Cp6JGY5YIRncTV_My9nf9g", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-09-09", "type": "review"}

I don't know how else to describe my dinner there.  My husband and I were in Phoenix for a long weekend and wanted some good Mexican food.  (Thank you, fellow Yelpers, for pointing me towards Mariscos Playa Hermosa.)\n\nThis adorable little restaurant looks like absolutely nothing from the outside- just a plain looking building with a sign.  The inside, though, is cute and definitely has an authentic Mexican feel.  Upon entering the restaurant, we were warmly greeted and seated. Within a few minutes, we were offered beers and tortilla chips.  We opted for guacamole to compliment our tortillas, the former of which I was suspicious at first because of the seemingly runny consistency.  Boy, was I wrong - the guac was tangy and full of flavor. I would love to have their recipe!    \n\nBased on other review, we opted for the molcajete for our main curse.  It. Was. Off. The. Hook.  It arrived in a medium-sized, deep bowl, filled half-way with a delicious spicy cheesy gray.  Along the sides of the bowl are shrimp, chicken, beef and scallops.  We just kind of pushed all the meats into the sauce and then dug in.  And while this dish is meant to serve up to 4 persons, we totally killed it and finished every bite.  (Disclaimer:  I'm a small person and really don't eat that much.... The molcajete was JUST THAT GOOD.)  \n\nThe next time I'm in Phoenix, I'll make sure to return to Mariscos!", "business_id": "Cp6JGY5YIRncTV_My9nf9g", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-11-24", "type": "review"}

The butterfly tent has different butterflies at different times of the year and is a great place for macro photos. DBG is a nice place to make an annual visit.

Serene, picturesque, and beautiful. If in the Phoenix area this is another place that is a must visit. As we were there a few days ago the weather was perfect - in the 70's in the sun, and in the high 50's at night. I would not suggest doing this garden in the summer unless you want to pass out from the heat. \n\nThat being said, the Desert Botanical Garden is a huge spread of land housing every variety of cacti you could ever want to view. Seriously, this place is all about cactus and not much else, but what they have here is breathtaking. From the smallest to the huge building-like varieties, to sculptures and fountains, this place has a wonderment of things to view.\n\nAs we were here on a Tuesday afternoon we had the place to ourselves. After the sun went down we were the only ones there walking around at night. We felt alone for almost three hours. At night there are sections which are illuminated by small lights, trails to walk, and places to sit and relax. There is also some critters hopping and slithering around too, but none threatening. You really feel as if you are alone in a desert forest walking around here. This week they also had giant bug sculptures in different parts of the park that were fun to look at. Giants ant on a mountain made it look like a giant ant hill. \n\nAt $18 admission it is a good deal. Staff is super friendly and helpful. You can stay as long as you want. They also have events and movie viewing nights here. Butterfly exhibit is also on on location to walk through.

I did learn a few things from him but do not expect he is going to take you anywhere but a few steps (I am not kidding.) This is not a tour of the garden in any way. \n\nThe food was great at the cafe.

Make sure you take some water with you and apply your sunscreen because even though we went when it was in the 70's we did get some sun and hubs got some red!  Oh, and do wear good walking shoes as there is a lot of ground to cover here. \n\nYou have an amazing array of cacti and other succulents.  The herb garden wasn't all that hot to me but it's there.  They have the volunteers out in different spots who will show you what this plant was used for and things like that.  There was a flute player out the day we went who captivated niece for a good long while.  It is not all flat ground, you will walk a bit uphill at some spots.\n\nThe giant insect statues were pretty cool to see but it was just the scenery period that was breath taking.  When the cacti are in bloom it has really got to be amazing.  Throughout the garden there are spots where they have information about the plants or the animals that are around and there are spots that have seats and shade; very necessary if you are really taking in the entire garden.\n\nWe were very fortunate as we got to see hummingbirds, cottontails, quails, squirrels, and a road runner.  It costs $18 for adults to get in UNLESS you have reciprocal membership from another garden.  We do, we got in free, woohoo!!!  \n\nIf you are into the plant - and animal - life of the southwest then this is a place I highly recommend, just stay on the path and be careful when you back up to take a picture!

If I lived in Phoenix, I'd be a member and a volunteer!!! :)\n\nAfter a full day of eating from the day before, I wanted to do a non food outing. My friend suggested the Botanical Garden which was a 30 minute drive from her place in Scottsdale. The parking lot was packed when we arrived at 930am. My friend was shocked at how crowded it was considering the past few times she'd been here, there'd been plenty of parking spots.  We eventually found a spot by following a couple who were walking back to their car. FYI parking is free but in cases where the parking lot is completely full you may have to wait it out OR possibly forgo visiting the Garden since the parking lot is the only place to park your car--there aren't any side streets to park on. \n\nAs we stood in line to purchase our tickets, surrounded by families with young children, we found out why it was so crazy busy:  the Garden was hosting \"The Great Pumpkin Festival\" which happened to be the same exact weekend we were at the Garden. This Festival offered plenty of activities for families: a hayride; pumpkin carving and decorating; a hay maze; a petting zoo; carnival games; and a free pumpkin for every child under 12.  How cute is that!!!\n\nAdmission for adults is $18. My friend had a 50% groupon for herself so her ticket was $9. A random guy came up to us and asked if we wanted his extra coupon that he and his family weren't using. I gladly accepted and once we got to the counter, my admission was free AND I also had FREE access to the butterfly exhibit which wasn't included in my friend's groupon deal. However the admissions guy ended up giving us 2 butterfly admission stickers--1 for me and 1 for my friend. Thanks random guy  & admissions guy for being nice and generous!!  \n\nOff we went to explore the Botanical Garden. My 4 favorite things during my visit:\n1) The Chocolate Flower: no joke this is a flower that smells exactly like chocolate; how did I not know about this?!  \n2) Upon walking further we approached some cacti that were enormously tall; think sequoia tree height (ok I exaggerate, but these cacti were the tallest I've ever seen). I was in awe.\n3) The random tidbits and interactive displays that provide useful information as to what you're seeing or the history behind it. \n4) The layout of the Garden was easy to follow and made it easy to not really miss anything. Upon entering the Garden there's main trail that loops around, but along the main trail there are 4 sub-trails that will loop you back where you turned off of the main trail. My favorite trail was the \"Plants & People of the Sonoran Desert Loop Trail.\" \n\nThe weather was warm but bearable. Bring bottled water, sunglasses, hats, and comfortable shoes since there's hardly any shade and most of the trails are dirt trails. We arrived at 9:30am and managed to see most of the Garden, including the Butterfly exhibit, by 11am. \n\nI absolutely loved visiting this place and wouldn't mind going again especially to the various events they host throughout the year...just another reason to re-visit Phoenix!!! :)", "business_id": "qMkIbQFrROSnPaQ7at85-w", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-11-04", "type": "review"}

I brought my family for this recent excursion.  First, we brought my 7 y/o daughter for their sponsored pumpkin ride and picking, which was a bit of a let down. The ride was advertised as a hay ride, but there was no hay to be seen. It was a bit too long, and the pumpkin patch consisted of pre picked pumpkins naturally from a cooler state! Coming from New Jersey, pumpkin hay rides locally are much cooler, but what can you do, this was the best AZ's harsh arid climate has to offer. The local kids were havign a blast, and I understand why.  My daughter thought it was dumb to be honest, as did we, but we all managed to have a bit of fun with it. \n\n  Onto the actual B.G.s. They were terrific, albeit hot as Hades. It was in the mid '80s the day we were there, and it felt like triple digits to us Yankees lol.  My lips were chapped as all hell after a few hours walking about, it blew my mind. The ground heats up in excess of 10 to 20 degrees in excess of the air temperature on any given day at the gardens. Bare that in mind when visiting. The admission price was reasonable. There is terrain consisting of novice to moderate grades of walking. Other areas are paved and consist of very mild walks, leisure and enjoyable.  The latest glass cactus additions were marvelous. Coming from outside the Southwestern USA, it is a must see experience, to walk amongst the natural beauty that consists of the deserts of Arizona. \n\n  There is plenty of free parking. Since my first and last visit there in 2009, the park has added an upscale gift shop and restaurant. I kid you not, the restaurant was five stars in itself! Offering cooked per order, organic dishes and drinks. It was so refreshing and tasty after hours in the blazing hot sun. A bit pricey but well worth it, my family and I concluded. Prompt and curtious service included. The gift shop is a bit of a tourist trap today, offering an array of tacky to note worthy items, all at tourist based prices!

I went with a Groupon, which was very clutch and turned a slightly high-ish price into a very good deal for what it is. The Chihuli glass exhibits are truly stunning, and the garden is full of cool-looking cacti and other desert plants. I was fortunate enough to visit in mid-April when all the cacti were in bloom and that was really pretty to see as well, with all the flowers everywhere. We also got to see a roadrunner which was EPIC! Got a great photo of it before it scurried off too!\n\nIt is VERY hot and there is some shade in various spots but not much. However, they did plant water fountains EVERYWHERE which was very essential. We refilled our water bottles probably at least a dozen times in the roughly 2 hours we spent in the garden. There are maps and stuff, but even for someone who is very very directionally sound, the garden layout was mildly confusing to me. At times, I was confused about whether I had missed a portion of the garden or if I was doubling back the way I came, or going down a dead end. The garden could benefit from some better/clearer signage. \n\nAll-in-all this was a really good experience and I'm glad we went. I'd probably go back if I were ever there in Winter, or late evening when the weather is cooler.", "business_id": "qMkIbQFrROSnPaQ7at85-w", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-09-01", "type": "review"}

I bet most of these reviews are from people who DON'T live in Arizona but live somewhere else with real green landscapes so when they see desert landscapes they are like wow this is amazing.

Sure you can find these plants right out side this place, but it definitely won't be very well organized, nicely landscaped and put together like here. Even if it were $20,  it won't bust my bank account.  They do let all military members in for free which is a bonus.  \nAs a big cactus lover,  I enjoyed this place,  they offer tours, also there's audio tours. There will be alot of walking,  which I was very pleased. So if you have children,  bring a stroller or a little wagon,  there's alot of walking. I loved how all the plants were nicely organized and labeled.  There were some amazingly huge and wierd looking cactuses I have never seen before.  The gift shop was great,  some items a little pricey, but you can also find some affordable items as well.  I didn't go to the restaurant, but I assumed it was a little pricey and simplistic with food choices as to be expected.  In this park, you'll find plenty of photo opportunities. I enjoyed every minute and I highly recommend that you check it out if you are actually into cactuses/succulents. Parking is great,  no problem finding parking.  Customer service was great.  If you go on a hot day,  make sure you bring plenty of water,  I had to refill my bottle 4 times.  You get a good amount of walking exercise,  plenty of visual stimulation, and capture glimpses of the wildlife.  This is the best desert botanical garden I have gone. It's no wonder it's  $20, the place has to maintain and keep thier botanical garden nice and It costs money to make it look this awesome. So if you're a cheap skate,  go take a trip to one of the places that one of these guys gave for thier 1-2 star review and enjoy seeing less than half of the plants you'll see on the outside. P.s. if you are expecting to see tulips or daisies,  you won't see them,  pay attention to the name,  there are mostly cactuses/succulents in this place.  You have been fore -warned.

I strongly dislike unruly kids in shops (or anywhere else) so I demand that my boys be respectful and not touch anything in places like Lonnie's.  \n\nI was looking at something in the case and my children were meandering around the shop - which is very small so they were never more than 20 feet from me.

There are dangerous chemicals out there.\"  Ohhhkay - I see her point but her tone was pretty aggressive.  Once my kids were next to me, she goes back to her post and says to her boss, loudly and clearly, \"I'm allergic to kids.\"  He didn't hear her so she said it again!  She thought she was being funny.\n\nNow, I could sound like some mom who thinks her kids can do no wrong.  I am NOT that kind of parent.  My kids were being quiet and unobtrusive.

Immediately when I walk in, I feel like there's a bright, shinning light over my head, as if I'm on stage and it's otherwise pitch black. Translation: I don't belong here. \n\nI walk the aisles, admire the plethora of things I've never been seen or heard of. I look at the frozen fish and wonder how in the world to prepare such things. I look at the sake aisle and wish I knew which to pick, which one wouldn't soil my taste buds. Sometimes I'm tempted to pick up their fresh slices of sashimi, but I usually pass. I just can't talk myself into it. \n\nI walk by the fresh fish, past the butchers and men with their imploring eyes. I feel uncomfortable under their gaze. I can only imagine what they're thinking. That's when I pretend even harder - pretend that I know what I'm doing, instead of wandering the aisles looking at anything from poxy stix to soy sauce. \n\nThen I end up in the meat section, dumbstruck. Gizzards. Tongue. Heart. It's like a lab here, animals dissected to entertain my morbid fascination. I tend to get repulsed when I get to the chicken feet. \n\nSo, I pass through the produce aisle and stutter near the bakery. Here is where I once picked up the most delicious bread I've ever had. It certainly wasn't healthy, but I don't care. I've since gone back looking for another loaf, but have yet to find it fresh on display. I keep hoping, though, that someday we will be re-united -- myself and that delectable bread - otherwise known as \"crack in a bag.\"  \n\nSo, if I'm so uncomfortable, why do I even bother? Because I like trying new things, from teas to bread to meat. I just can't seem to pick up the latter, for fear of self-poisoning. Plus, nothing beats cheap bags of edamame here. Other stores want nearly $4 for a bag. Screw that. \n\nI've also tried their milk pearl tea here. It's not bad. It's not something I'd get very often, for I can find better concoctions elsewhere.

Before leaving, the Pep Boys employee who handled my payment verbally told me that my car was in good shape and had no other recommendations for maintenance, which seemed reasonable, as it was showing no signs of problems. Following the oil change, I drove home (approximately 3 miles), where the car sat for approximately one hour. I then drove from my home approximately 7 miles where the car engine was stopped for 15-20 minutes. \n\nShortly after starting my vehicle and driving less than 2 more miles, the engine temperature gauge spiked to the maximum and the engine began chugging. I immediately turned the car off and pulled to the side of the road, in an effort to avoid any further damage to my car. Then my car was towed to a more trusted shop across town. When examining my car, the mechanics at a more trusted shop found that the radiator coolant cap was left off the fill neck and was lying on top of the engine. \n\nPhotos of the cap location were taken once the hood of the vehicle was lifted (cap was not moved by the trusted mechanic); including three images showing the coolant fill neck and the cap. The other photo showed the hood liner wet from the coolant that came out. Due to the short amount of mileage that was driven, the car thankfully became operable once radiator coolant was filled and the cap placed back on. Based on the photos and a licensed mechanic's evaluation of my car, it is apparent that the Pep Boy's mechanic removed the radiator cap from my vehicle and failed to secure it back onto the radiator fill neck. However, the store manager, Jae, informed me that since I drove my car a few miles \"it must have vibrated off after service.\" \n\n\nI may be a female, but I know that the caps have locks, AND that I have 136K miles on this car and no cap has ever \"vibrated off\" while driving. Thanks for the advice. Really. I sent both photos, reciepts, and letters to Jae. He was unwilling to admit any fault. Go somewhere else for work on your car.

When it changed from being a BRE-owned property to the current owners, nearly every aspect of living here went downhill. \n\nHere are some of the most important things you should know prior to renting here: \n\n1.) The water billing is done so that you're essentially a proportionate portion of everyone's use. So even if you're good about conserving water, you'll probably be paying more than you should be. When the new company switched to this billing system, it increased our water bill about $12-17/month, even though we're not using more water.   \n\n2.) You'll pay for gas you may or may not use. The company installed gas grills that are always in use except for during the day and when the pool is about to close. Doesn't matter if you use the barbecues or not; you're paying for them.   \n\n3.) DO NOT RENT HERE IF YOU PLAN TO TRY TO BUY A HOUSE IN THE NEAR FUTURE. The lease notice has to be given 60 days in advance (not 30, as in most places). So if you get don't pre-qualified until after that point, too bad, you're paying for an empty apartment for a month if you do get a house. If you put in notice to be on the safe side and your home sale falls through, I guess you're screwed. They are totally uncompromising and unwilling to work out any kind of accommodation on this, either through pro-rating a couple of weeks or anything.   \n\nAlso, that gas bill I mentioned in #2? Prepare to pay to that until you turn in your keys.   Oddly, this policy does not apply to garage rental (which is a staggering $85/month).  \n\n4.) The billing system is inefficient and tedious. The water bill is lumped in with your rent, but you can't just make one payment online. You have to wait until you get an email from Conservice to find out how much the final balance of your rent will be...and even then, you can't just log in to the apartment's portal and see what the total rent will be; you have to add it in yourself when you set the amount to be withdrawn. Also, the new calculation increased our water bill about $13/month. Oh, and to pay online there's a \"convenience fee\" of $2, ridiculous. We used to pay on a no-hassle auto-debit, now it's  a three-step process.   \n\n5.) Recently, the condensation pan for our air conditioner was dripping a puddle into our master bathroom. We called at around 4:30 p.m. on Friday to report this and were told it was not an emergency (so what is?) and it would be handled Monday. Well, we woke up the following night at 3 a.m. to water literally running down in a stream into the three bowls we had to put down to catch the leak. Called the emergency maintenance number and received a call back from the maintenance technician, who said he'd be there....Monday morning.   Which he was. With a temporary fix, that basically caused the leaking to continue. It wasn't fixed until Wednesday and there is still dripping.   \n\n6.) The \"renovation.\" We looked at the \"renovated\" apartments because they offered to move us into one. Basically, it's a stainless steel version of the cheapest appliances possible and a flimsy, paper sticker that looks like wood plastered over the already-existing cabinetry. There is a new \"granite\" counter top and breakfast bar, but the cabinet facings, not the cabinets, are the only thing replaced. So the cabinets are still cheap press board and very shallow. And forget about being able to put so much as a spatula inside the drawers.   \n\n7.) Maintenance work begins obnoxiously at 6 or 7 a.m. Also, it took over a week to get a new kitchen light and we have been waiting more than two weeks to get a kitchen cabinet fixed, despite putting in a request several weeks ago.\n\nFinally, know that if you move here you will be a cog in a machine and not a person. My husband and I never missed the rent once for three years. When my husband got a new job, the pay schedule meant we would be five days late.

Over all the location is good, te grounds are kept ok and I feel I have addequate space to live in for the price I pay. The staff is relatively friendly and the office is kept clean and tidy, but that is where my liking of fountain oaks ends.\n\nI have off and on fought with the office to have even minor repairs sone to my unit. They drag their feet and show up whenever they want to (if they haven't just completely forgotten or marked the job as complete in the first place) and half the time when they do they do not bring the proper tools to do the job or have to order a part to do it. Some of that is forgivable, but when it is a normal thing that happens 75% of the time it gets to be a bit much. \n\nI am now sitting in a home with an ugly expsosed area in my ceiling that has been there for over 20 days due to rain and nothing has been done and a second bedroom that could very well have mold in the wall and carpet due to water damage that happened last december and has been marked in their computers as \"fixed, no issue or leak found.\"\n\nI have begun detailing the entirety of my communications with their staff and log daily the events and changes that happen. I take photgraphic evidence so that if need be I can proove to them what they are doing wrong and in the case of the potential mold hazard in my second room take them to court. \n\nAs a word of warning, do not use the laundry facilities if you can afford it. They are too small to handle a complex of this size and are far too inadequate to even function properly in the first place. They are small and over priced and have a high likelyhood of being filthy or just plain broken. The room itself is poorly vebtilated and incredibly hot at all times and the locks do not work keeping the gangs of children from using it as a \"playhouse.\" So ask why you even need a key for it in the first place.\nI find myself disgusted more and more lately as no one cleans up after themselves and evevn the office refuses to do anything to fix it. \n\nIf that isn't enough, the complex is set upon regularly by gangs of children with no respect for property or other people and no supervision. I have had glass thrown at me while doing laundry, broken up a fight in which 3 boys were beating on a smaller boy, and have been called offensive names by others while trying to walk home, I have even witnissed 2 young teenagers in the process of getting somewhat physical in the middle of a parking space. I know this is completely not the responsibility of fountain oaks or the greystar communities management, but I do need to warn everyone who could potentially want to live here of this fact. The kids have been responsible for damage to windows and vehicles by putting rocks in gas tanks and more since I have been here.\n\nWhile I do feel relatively happy most of the time, that is purely because I do not leave my apartment unless I need to and keep my doors locked. The management has seemingly done nothing remotely useful or nice to me other than remembering my name or apartment number when I come in to pay my rent or collect a package. \n\nRenters beware.", "business_id": "htkDJW_dcMhVyHdBr3esdg", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-09-20", "type": "review"}

For $7.99, you have your pick of Tandoori Chicken, a delicious chicken Curry, Three Vegetable Curries, Basmati Rice, Daal, Naan, and. Salad. To complete your feast, they offer Kheer (rice pudding with almond and pistachio) and Gulab Jamun (Two balls akin to donut holes - made from cream of milk in scented light syrup).\n\nThe greatest thing about this buffet is that it is \"western\" friendly.  This means that none of the curries are too spicy, and even the mint chutney is not over-powered by peppers and chilies.  For your first experience with Indian food, this is a terrific spot.  If a seasoned veteran of this cuisine, you may be more picky where flavor is concerned.\n\nI personally feel the buffet had very slim pickings, especially for someone that enjoys diversity in dining.  However, I thought the tikka masala, chicken curry, daal, pakoras, and saag were sooo delicious.\n\nI am interested in returning here to explore its dinner options.  For example, along with the varying lamb, chicken, and vegetarian dishes Indian Delhi Palace offers - they have complete dinners for under $20.  For instance, the chicken dinner includes One Papadum, One Tandoori Chicken, Chicken Curry, One Daal Maharani, One Plate of Basmati Rice, One Naan, One Ratia, One Dessert, Chutney and Tea.", "business_id": "_RBUU1y4yJrK0SPAd8z0-w", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-10-04", "type": "review"}

Him more so than me. He's actually called me at 12:30 at night, from a bar, talking about how he wants Indian Food. It's as though he can already feel the hangover coming on and wants to make sure his priorities are in check. 1) Get home (or wherever) safely 2) Indian Food. I may have mixed up the order.\n\nThis Indian Delhi Palace is apparently under the same ownership as the Tempe location, but I like this one much better. For several reasons:\n\n1) The Chicken Tikka Masala is AMAZING. Like, I've never had buffet food this good before. I don't really like Tandoori Chicken. Honestly, the color kind of freaks me out. I know it's from the sauce or whatever, but chicken, on the bone, with a kind of fluorescent pink glow is weird. I'll pass. But boneless chicken in a delightful red curry sauce? Don't mind if I DO!\n\n2) This location has a much larger variety of dishes, especially vegetarian dishes, which are usually my favorite offerings at an Indian lunch buffet (see above about tandoori chicken freaking me out).\n\n3) Um, hello? It looks like a freaking palace. These guys did not hold back and I freaking love them for it. I actually think more places offering a lunch buffet should treat its patrons like the hungover royalty that we are. I wouldn't mind if Souper Salad and Sweet Tomato hopped on this trend already. I mean, how hard can it be to add a few fancy door arches and some gold plated silverware? Not that hard really. Up your game, guys.\n\nHowever, the only complaint I have about Indian Delhi Palace, and the primary reason why Flavors of India remains my favorite Indian Lunch Buffet has to do with the atmosphere. Yes, I appreciate the super sexy high-class water goblets, but Delhi Palace doesn't have any booths. And when I'm hungover, I need a freaking booth. I need my own little eating sofa. I need to be able to kick off my flip flops under the table and sprawl out like I'm enjoying their delicious naan on my own little loveseat.

I was non-too-thrilled by this suggestion, but felt I had nothing better to offer.

They were gone in minutes.

The apps came with mint chutney and tamarind chutney, and I ordered raita (cool whipped yogurt) to drizzle over the spicy preps.\n\nDinner was around $170. It was entirely worth it.  No stress, no mess, and everyone was thanking us for the Indian treats. Plus, we had Indian food for dinner the next night!\n\nWhat I gleaned from this experience was I could have definitely ordered less food.  There was tons of left overs.

Part of my low rating is due to the air conditioner in the meeting room having a bad filter, such that some cool air was coming out the sides of it but not the center, and the room stayed warmer than it should have.  Shuttle service was par exellence and the staff was attentive and helpful, which is why I give the place two stars instead of one.  It's the many room problems which bring my ratings down.  They gave me a disabled access room which I didn't need, meaning there was a walk-in shower with a big wall-chair.  Thankfully, at least the air conditioner in the room worked well, and the pool area was nice and the grounds clean.  Biggest issue was that the door to the room did not close all the way automatically, and I came back one night to find that the cleaning staff had not shut it all the way.  Thankfully, none of my stuff was missing.  The bathroom door, on the other hand, was on a spring and tended not to stay open, so it took more time than it should have for the steam to clear after I showered.  Also, the bathroom door had a couple of holes in it, a bit damaged from the inside (not all the way through, but it did look bad).  And the lighting in the bathroom was also badly in need of an upgrade.  It was lit by the type of fluorescent bulb that flickers for several seconds before finally coming on part way with a steady light, and then a few more seconds for full light (which honestly wasn't all that great).   Therefore, I had to leave the light on all night because using the bathroom in the middle of the night would have presented a problem otherwise.  Add to this that both the cable service on the television AND internet access were intermittent.  When I tried watching in the evening usually only half of the channels had any reception.  As for internet, I had to re-sign in at least twice each day to get access, and even then it would periodically blink out before coming back on, I'd get \"disconnected\" messages all the time.  \n\nIf I ever return to the area, I'll be choosing another hotel, as there are plenty around the area within walking distance to this place.", "business_id": "CfzoA3TQ8YQcFTOncJFbQQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-10-12", "type": "review"}

Most condos have been upgraded with granite counter tops in the kitchen and bathroom.  Also, most of the appliances have been updated to stainless steel.  In addition to the tiles in the kitchen and bathroom, most condos have either carpet or have been upgraded to wood flooring.  In all honesty when I was first looking at these condos they are similar to the neighboring complex, Red Rox.  However, Riverwalk has larger balconies and their exterior is painted a nice neutral white and tan, compared to Red Rox, which is a red and green color and always reminds me of christmas.      \n\nIn addition to the condos, I feel the location of these condos is fabulous! Located right on the border of Tempe and Phoenix; and Scottsdale is less than 5 minutes away.  Papago Park is right across the street for nice scenery, hiking and biking.  The Oakland A's baseball stadium is in walking distance for Spring Training games.  Also, the Phoenix Zoo is about a block away, next to the Botanical Gardens.  Right down the road is the Marquee Theater, the light rail, and Mill Ave.  Very easy to get anywhere you want to go from these condos!", "business_id": "PsO7ilfx0aA9SgcAqA4New", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-10-19", "type": "review"}

We had already been to Carly's, Lucky Strike, Roosevelt, Bikini, Paisley Violin, and Lost Leaf. It was a perfectly fine drunken evening. Riding by District, I said hi to three women smoking on the patio. They said hi back, and I thought that was it. 1/2 block later, I look back and my friend is not anywhere to be seen. He made convo with the three, and scored one of their numbers. SWEET! Well, an hour of talking to them and he had an open invitation for us to join them for Chris Isakk... I wasn't feeling it though. It's just Chris Isakk, and I can't drive, and the train doesn't go there, and a taxi costs too much.... the only option is to bike! it's almost four miles!! So we biked, and biked, and biked. \n\nFinally, after the most awkwardly drunken bike ride down roosevelt for several miles, we arrived to a full parking lot and no idea where to go or how to get in. This place has no signage about which entrance is what. I go to lock my bike to a fence and the girl at the door says I cannot do that here. When I asked where I could lock it up, she replied \"sir, I make $5.75 an hour.\" Ok, cool, but where can I lock my bike up? She said I could lock it to a light pole, so I started to do that, then she said \"not that light pole sir. I make $5.75 an hour please don't make my job hard.\" I don't care how much you make. This wen't on for 10 minutes. Then trying to get into the place was next to impossible. We couldn't get close enough to the door to exchange tickets with our contact, and she couldn't go out the door because they have a no-reentry policy. Eventually some young girl with authority told us it was our lucky day and we could both go in for free... YESSSSSS! My sweet brunette savior. \n\nInside the venue, everything goes in a circle, and is very intimate. There really isn't a bad seat in the house. The stage rotates so everyone gets a good view for half the show. They have plenty of concession stands, and $7 a beer is at least better than Chase Field, US Airways Center, or Dodge. The ride back home consisted of singing Chris Isakk songs and screaming and yelling all the way down Washington back downtown.

Despite the sketchy surrounding neighborhood and higher priced rent, it was a nice centralized location that fit my lifestyle at the time. \n\nI will say that the benefit of location is a huge plus for Courtney Village. You are less than 10 minutes from ASU and oldtown Scottsdale. Less than 30 minutes from almost every part of the valley. \n\nAnother benefit is their dog park. A good core group of residents frequent the dog park multiple times a week. They are very friendly and welcoming to new people and all they ask is that your dog not be a total dick. It gives the complex a greater sense of community.\n\nUnfortunately, those are the only two benefits that Courtney Village offers. The apartment office is rude and unresponsive to resident inquiries. They advertise a \"gated\" community, but will let the gates sit broken and open for weeks at a time, giving anyone the ability to enter the complex. They promise a 48-hour maintenance work order fix, but refuse to co-ordinate their maintenance appointments with the resident's schedule. They expect you to let their maintenance guys have carte blanche access to your home without ever meeting them. They are so committed to this 48 hour time frame that if you try to call a work order in with a desired fix date more than 48 hours out, they will tell you that you need to call back closer to the desired date. \n\nAnother issue with the office is that everyone is in \"cover your ass\" mode. Employees are quick to throw others under the bus for misinformation and also will lie to a resident at the drop of a hat. My last rent check took over four weeks to be cashed by the office. I called after two weeks to make sure my payment was applied. The office assured me that they had cashed the check and that it must be a problem with my bank. Sure enough, once my check was cashed and I looked at the deposit date, it was deposited on the 27th of the month. Maybe instead of lying to a resident, they could just admit that they fucked up instead of leading someone on a wild goose chase with their bank over outstanding checks.\n\nThe biggest problem is that Courtney Village believes they have some sort of inflated value based on their apartment's location. They will try to charge you almost $900 a month for a 2 bedroom, 1,050sq ft apartment. They do this despite having a trailer park a block to the west, being 1/4th of a mile away from a complex where two men broke into the apartment of a woman and proceeded to rape and rob her, and also 1/4th of a mile away from a National Guard base where a solider was stabbed while taking out the trash. They refuse to even hire a security guard to do nightly checks, instead relying on the two residents who are Phoenix police members to demonstrate a level of security in the complex that does not exist. Seems like the more the neighborhood goes downhill, the higher they raise their rates. They also won't give any current residents a fair shake when it comes to renewing their lease. My buddy continued to pay nearly $800 a month for the same model unit that they rented to his neighbors for $750 two weeks earlier. Seems that they would rather risk bringing in new tenants at a slightly higher price point than working with current residents. \n\nThis review may seem negative, and in all honesty it is, but this complex is ran by a very negative group of people. They try to work you with their community bullshit, but at the end of the day they could care less if your car is broken into or if the grounds look nice or if your apartment is taken care of. They only care about that rent check being dropped in their mail on the 1st. Avoid the bullshit and find a nicer, safer, cleaner place closer to Scottsdale or ASU for the same price point.", "business_id": "bVRoCoXu2jIyqbZRT_isWw", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-11-10", "type": "review"}

It was managed by a different company, and it was a really nice place.  Quiet, working class residents, and families.  When the current mgt company took over, it started to slowly take a turn for the worse.  First thing they did was try to hassle me about my recent lease renewal before the prior company left.  Said I was paying to little.  Sorry, I signed the contract, you have to honor it......I agree with the other reviewers that stated how bad the customer relation skills of the employees in the leasing office are. (With the exception of CJ, he is very pleasant, and easy to talk to.  Unfortunately, he has no managerial power).  Less than a year ago I was on a 4month medical leave due to a kidney transplant.  My benefits were taking long to go through, so I advised the office of my situation, and wanted to work something out.  Sorry, no dice.  Since it took an extra 2 weeks to receive my funds (now I was over 10days late) they filed papers with a lawyer, and I got served.  So the money I just got, had to go to late fees, plus the lawyer fees, which were over $200 alone.  I wasn't allowed to set up a payment plan, pay half, or any other option.  Nice way to treat a long term tenant.  \n\nThey used to be so strict with issues such as picking up after your dog, parking your car properly within the lines. and noise problems.  Sadly all these things have gone.  It's almost like dodging land mines everyday.  Many of us have complained, but their HONEST to GOODNESS answer was, \"Well if we don't know who it is, we can't do anything about it.  Maybe if you took a picture of them, or told us the apt #\".......So I should hide in the bushes with a camera, or stalk the person?  I asked if they could at least put out a letter asking residents to be more mindful and respectful.  They said no.\nNow I see abandoned cars with flat tires, broken headlights, and expired plates.  They used to have the vehicles towed just for having an expired plate.  The grills have been broken (handles, burners, self igniter, etc) for well over 4 years.\n\nSadly, the complex has mirrored the surrounding neighborhood a great deal the past few years.  Even a lot of the residents are just rude and discourteous.  They'll park in your spot or take up both theirs and yours.  Other neighbors have complained of their cars and apartments being broken into. And yet we still have no type of security presence. \n\nIf you're a new tenant, they are all smiles and welcome you in.  But as a current resident, their expression conveys more of a \"What do you want?\" attitude.  You try to ask a question, or ask for help with maybe dealing with problems in the common areas (like broken bbq grills), and you get a 'Yeah we know', or a 'We'll look into it'.  Nothing ever happens.  They DON'T take care about the current and long term residents.  And because of all these issues, many of the good people have left.  \n\nThis for sure is my last lease.  It can't come fast enough.  If I'm able to save up enough money, I just may break it, so I can get out.", "business_id": "bVRoCoXu2jIyqbZRT_isWw", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-09-30", "type": "review"}

To those who say it's a crappy neighborhood, this is the big city folks.  There are no guarantees, even in a gated community.  I have friends up in Scottsdale who live in gated communities with a guardhouse, and they still have problems.  So, it really doesn't matter where you live.  My son's car was broken into for the stereo, which was not great, but we have AAA so it didn't take long for us to get it fixed.  \n\nWhile it is true the gate is broken sometimes, this has been because IDIOTS try to go through the gates without entering the code behind someone and the gates are in the process of closing and the car hits the gate.  I've seen it happen.  \n\nAs far as the noise, on the weekends (in the summer especially) there are pool parties with kids, which doesn't bother me.  There have been two occasions since Jan that I was rudely awakened by people on their patio being too loud in the wee hours of the morning.  But a quick \"please keep it down\" was acknowledged and back to sleep I went.  I think management got rid of any really bad apples, since I have NEVER heard any fighting or screaming.  \n\nMaintenance requests have been acknowledged by phone the next morning if placed after hours, and an appointment made.  Never a problem with this.  The groundskeepers are very nice, and one even volunteered to take my trash to the dumpster for me, because he was on the way there and saw me carrying it.  It is a pain that there are not more dumpsters, but I don't let trash pile up, so driving by on my way to work every 3-4 days is not a big deal.  \n\nParking - yeah, it can be a bit irritating, especially when we see one particular vehicle make a habit of parking so askew that the person next to him/her couldn't open their door.  I had to crawl in my car from the passenger side one morning.  I took a photo of the license plate, reported it to the office, and it's never happened again.  \n\nYou are 10 mins or less from just about everything here.  Location is great.  Light rail station is less than 5 minutes away, and the Skytrain to the airport is about a 15 min drive, if that.  Perfect.\n\nOffice staff - Tasha , Claudia, and Lisa are wonderful.  I think there was another gal as well when I first moved in.  She was nice, but needed to smile more.  She appeared to be having a bad day most of the time, but was never rude. \n\nI have recommended Courtney Village to two friends so far, and one will be moving here in the next month.  Hopefully they won't raise my rent too much when my lease is up, as I always pay anywhere from 2-5 days ahead of the due date.", "business_id": "bVRoCoXu2jIyqbZRT_isWw", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-11-13", "type": "review"}

I went to the office so I could be put on the pest control list and the ants never went away so I had to buy my own bug spray and fix the problem.\nThen about a month into being moved in the lock on my front door came completely out. When my bf told the office that our lock was broken and we both had work that day the lady told him someone should be there to fix it within the next hour. When I went on my break 4 hours later I called the office to make sure my house was locked and they told me no one had been there yet.

Then the property manager came out after I asked the First Lady if I could speak with her and she wouldn't go get her for me, and the manager was extremely rude about the situation with me. \nAlso my laundry room closet door fell off the tracks completely one day and almost fell on my head. There are also a lot minor reports that weren't made before I moved in. \n Lastly this week my boyfriend got his car out of the shop after 5 months and the tags he had were expired the day after we brought the car home the management put a tow away sticker on his car even though it was parked in an uncovered parking space and was doing nothing to anyone. \nAnyone who is looking for a place that has a good management run complex DO NOT GO HERE!

I checked out a few Christian churches,  even some spiritual centers but nothing resonated with me.  I was born and raised Catholic, so because of that some Protestant churches just don't work for me.  Sorry, I'm just not into all that hooting and hollerin' (or the threats of hell and damnation)!  I'm also very spiritual (not necessarily religious), so I can be wary of religious zealots.  But I've always been open to trying new churches out; so when my classmate invited me to come to hers, I thought sure why not!  Well let me tell you, I was hooked from day one.\n\nFCC is uplifting, delightful and there is lots of praise singing.  You can't help but join in!  It is a non-denominational, multicultural church.  The Sunday service is held at Saguaro High School at 10am.  Praise & worship singing goes on until about 10:30.  They also have bible study/service at 7pm on Wednesdays at their Phoenix location.  FCC is very welcoming and has such a cute way of welcoming new visitors.  \n\nEvery so often, a new topic will be presented as part of a new series.  It will be discussed for several Sundays/Wednesdays in a row.  Afterwards, you can purchase the recordings in mp3/CD for safe-keeping.  The \"Sex\" series had just started when I began attending.  I was really impressed with how Pastor Moore handled the topic: he was very open, frank and respectful.  Any children present were ushered into another room, so adults could feel free to enjoy this topic.  I think it is a challenge for many Christians to follow God's word while traversing this terrain called \"Earth\".  I found this series extremely helpful to me and anyone wishing to maintain closeness to God.\n\nSpeaking of children, they have their own program on Sundays in another part of the building.  I think this is really beneficial for them, allowing them to grow in their own faith with their peers.  They have the opportunity to start developing relationships with like-minded individuals.\n\nThis year celebrates FCC's 15th anniversary so they just held a 3-day celebration.  And...I just officially took steps to become a member.  I begin membership classes next month!

We equipped ourselves with full kevlar body suits complete with knee cap armor.\n\nDuring lunch hours it can be hard to find a parking slot at Honey Bear's Bar-B-Q restaurant. There are probably 20 spots and most of them fill up pretty quickly. From the outside, Honey Bear's looks as if it has had it's share of violence and has survived through it all. Fortunately enough, the inside makes up for the outside, but only in part. The restaurant is clean and the food appears to be prepared in a clean environment. But the whole building and the front part sure could do with a fresh coat of paint. That whole part of Phoenix is pretty runned down anyways. Honey Bear's is probably the best kept of its neighbors. Even so, don't attempt to gamble with your life and walk from work to the restaurant, you might get stabbed or shot at or both -- you've been warned.\n\nMany people in our office love Honey Bear's and if they had the chance would go and eat there every day. Out of the three times I've been to Honey Bear's during two of them I've gotten a BBQ sandwich and the other time I got a salad. The salad was nothing to write home about and honestly I didn't expect it to be. The place specializes in Tennessee style BBQ and not in salads. So if BBQ doesn't turn you on, then neither will Honey Bear's. The BBQ sandwiches at Honey Bear's never seem to impress me though. It just reminds me of sloppy joe and honestly I'd rather have a sandwich made with Manwich than with their BBQ chicken. Manwich is at the very least \"managable\". The meat on the sandwichs at Honey Bear's seem to be all over the place. It is uncontrollable almost. Their is no picking your sandwich up and eating it. If you try, it is just a mess. You end up having to eat your sandwich with a fork. Com'on now, is that how the people in Tennesee eat their sandwiches? With a fork? Yea, it's true what their moto says, \"You don't need no teeth to eat our meat!\", but I can guarantee you, you'll need a fork.\n\nAs for food presentation, Honey Bear's doesn't do so well. Their sandwiches come wrapped in tin foil and the first impression you get is that there was no care put into it when they made it. They just plopted the meat on and moved on to the next customer.\n\nI have heard through various channels that Honey Bears tastes like cafateria food. Atleast I'm not the only hater.\n\nThe price for food at Honey Bear's is about $5 just for the sandwich alone. With a drink and a side order of something it will usually run you about $8. The whole menu is pretty much a-la-carte.\n\nWe will probably visit Honey Bear's agian because my co-workers have a thing for BBQ.

The very unattractive woman at the register didn't welcome us, didn't ask if we had any questions, she just stared at us.  After a short time the phone rang and she turned away from us to answer it without a word.\n\nWhen she finished the call she turned back to us without a word, fortunately my wife and I had decided on our order.  I gave it to her and paid her, and we finally we able to exchange words.  She handed me the credit card receipt and said, \"sign here, the pens are there\" and pointed to the pens by the register.  Thus ended our conversation.\n\nThus also ended the good part of our visit.\n\nWe walked into the dining area to get a table and after checking half a dozen of the tables we discovered that we were going to get to choose from the least filthy of the lot.  I went back out to the condiment area to get enough napkins to wipe the table off and sitting on the counter next to the napkins was a small bucket with a label indicating that it was filled with some sort of cleaning liquid and should not be used for or stored near food.\n\nWe got the table sort of cleaned off and sat down to our pulled pork sandwiches.  Aside from the fact that there were pieces of pork in my wife's sandwich that were burned badly enough she couldn't chew them and the paper that the sandwiches were served on in the plastic trays was so flimsy if you attempted to cut the sandwich you ended up with a fork full of paper with your bite of sandwich, the meal was, at best, mediocre.  Oh, and the floor looked like it hadn't been swept, let alone washed in a week.\n\nAs we were leaving my wife mentioned that she had to use the restroom, but if the tables were that filthy she didn't want to find out what your restroom looked like.\n\nI can't think of a reason that would bring us back to Honey Bears, except maybe if the Restaurant Impossible guy does a show there.

Honey Bears was bare bones in decor but for a BBQ place, I am not judging on the quality of their pictures on the wall but rather the tastiness of the meat.

You also get a side (can't go wrong with Mac n cheese) that comes in a to go container which is great if you can't finish all your food.  I love the fact that the place is family owned and it's a great atmosphere in the establishment with several historically meaningful pictures of it.

I spoke to a gentleman on the phone and explained that I knew my Groupon was expiring that night but would they let me come today for the deal and he said yes that would be fine. So today I make the drive and was told \"no\" by the girl behind the counter. I explain the whole situation about calling last night and that I spoke to a guy and she just said \"I know who you spoke to but that's not our policy so you can't get the deal.\"  No apology or attempt to rectify the situation.

Once I started ordering for multiple people (all on one check) the girl looked at me like I was completely stupid.  I had to repeat my order multiple times and she still got it wrong, all the while, looking at me like I was an idiot.

She had such a major attitude when I asked for the link platter and she told me they didn't have that available at the time.  How hard is it to just not put the links on a bun and put them on a plate instead? I get the food and there is barely any BBQ sauce.  I ordered for 8 people, and was only given two small containers of sauce.  She gave me a hard time when I asked for more, and that was also when I found out I got two sausage link sandwiches instead of platters.

That happened to us a few years ago in November when we decided to visit Arizona on the cheap via a time-share offer (you know - the kind were you have to listen to \"the talk\"). We got the talk over with on the first day. Unfortunately my wife was in tears when I said no because she had bought into the sales ploy that plunking down thousands of dollars for a piece of a resort on a posh Scottsdale golf course was better than a similar offering in Breckenridge or Kauai. The trip to the Grand Canyon was memorable in a no-see-em sort of way. You arrive at the rim to behold a magnificent panorama and...nothing! A snow storm and clouds in the canyon had completely obliterated the view. We did have a fun snowball fight. Sedona shone in all its touristic glory (it really is a beautiful place, though). I thought I felt a jolt of energy in one of its famous vortices, but then realized I was just light-headed from chasing my kids up the hill. Which brings me to the Phoenix Zoo - the attraction that saved the trip for my son and I.\n\nWhat do you do with an active boy when his sisters and mom want to go shopping and tan by the pool? Yep! That's right! Zoo therapy. Let me start the review by saying I spent half of my childhood at the San Diego Zoo which set the bar impossibly high when used to benchmark other zoos. However, it also instilled in me a life-long love of the zoo experience. I've taken my children to zoos in dozens of cities across the US and in Europe. The Phoenix Zoo is one of the best.\n\nIt's a perfect zoo at which to spend three hours and feel like you've seen about everything. The walkways meander easily through different animal habitats and I was surprised and delighted to see that bikers and skaters are allowed. Very smart! I was relieved that it was November and not August. The thought of walking around the place with the temperature at 115 deg F is daunting.\n\nThe zoo has some special highlights that bear mentioning:\n\n- The walk-through monkey exhibit. They frolic directly over your head via a system of ropes that serve as the monkey highway through the exhibit. I was amused to see the hand sanitizer and wash stations at the exit. Omygosh! Monkey germs! Many in our over-sanitized culture would be shocked to see equivalent European exhibits where they allow monkeys to sit on your shoulder while you feed them monkey food. \n\n- The Wallaby Walkabout. Uber-cool for the under-ten contingent.\n\n- The Arizona Trail. It's always great and instructive to see indigenous critters in a pseudo-indigenous environment. When we visited, the coyotes were being particularly cooperative in a game of hide-and-go-seek with my boy.\n\nThe coolest thing in the whole zoo? The tamarin exhibit! These tiny primates share their enclosure with...whodathunkit...chickens! Why chickens? It's a case of the hens guarding the monkey house. The tamarin's inquisitive nature makes them easy victims for Arizona's scorpion population. They pick them up, get stung and get sick. Chickens just happen to like to eat scorpions and are immune to their venom. When my son found this out, he spent an additional twenty minutes looking for scorpions. Either those barbed beasts weren't being forthcoming or the chickens had done an A+ job.\n\nI'd highly recommend the Phoenix Zoo as a leisurely and instructive afternoon's activity for the whole family.", "business_id": "1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-09-21", "type": "review"}

Yes, yes, I know...it's Arizona, it's too hot for polar bears, but that doesn't make me any less sad.\n\nNow, onto the real stuff. I got an annual membership for $50 which means I can visit almost any time I want except during special events. I get discount tickets to Zoo Lights and so on. That price isn't bad considering that regular admission is $14. I've already been twice in the last week (no, I don't have a life).\n\nThe animals are still a little lethargic, recovering from a very hot summer. So far I have yet to see the male lion do anything but sleep very soundly. However, I did meander over to the porcupine enclosure at just the right time and got to see her chase her handler around the enclosure and \"target\" for treats. I can honestly say I had never before seen a trained porcupine. The safari-type enclosure that houses the giraffes amongst other African animals is really cool. And the baboons LOVE having their photograph taken, no joke. There aren't as many animals as other zoos in smaller metros that I've been to, but the climate around here really limits the types of animals they can keep. Still, it's a cool place to walk around.

So I grew up in south Phoenix and this was our go to field trip in elementary school. \n\nSeriously, we went every year. \n\nBut I was ok with that because I loved it. I've enjoyed picnics (the way too go, the food is not that great and it's expensive), birthday parties, and scavenger hunts here. I even saw a wedding here once. On a nice day it makes for a great walk. Too bad they didn't have the water park type area when I was a kid. It looks so refreshing to splash in during the summer when the afternoons can be unbearable. Trust me, I've thought about shoving a kid or too out of the way just to enjoy a sprinkle.  \n\nIt's also nice to come here in December when it's a little chilly and grab a cup of hot chocolate and enjoy Zoo Lights.", "business_id": "1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-11-13", "type": "review"}

Don't get me wrong, I love a good mammal display, but I also like to see a nice collection of amphibians and reptiles.  If that is what you like to see, the PHX zoo is not the place for you.  They do have a small collection of southwestern rattlesnake and some common pet amphibians, but that is it for the herps...  They also have a komodo dragon that is pretty large but overall, they lack the fish, amphibians, and reptiles.  Also, where is the insect collections? Maybe I missed it.\n\nThe animals do have very large enclosures, but some look under kept.  Also, there is one aviary that is very cool and has some very pretty bird species.  They have red eared sliders hanging out in the ponds on the grounds that are probably the reason sliders are in natural waterways now...  a shame...\n\nOverall, I was pretty disappointed in the PHX zoo, the admission was pricey, and the breadth of animals small.", "business_id": "1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-10-21", "type": "review"}

Fun to watch. \n\nThey have great events throughout the year and I especially love zoo lights which always gets me in the holiday spirit. The halloween activities are also fun for little ones and adults. The zoo always looks clean, well maintained, and there are always people around to tell you about the animals, answer questions, etc.", "business_id": "1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-10-29", "type": "review"}

Apparently they close at 4.  On a Saturday.  When it's beautiful weather. Maybe that's an obvious close time to everyone else but we sure were disappointed.\n\nI guess there is a whole slew of stuff we missed seeing, and some other exhibits we passed were closed for a wedding.  I guess it's cool to get married in the orangutan exhibit.  Or else the orangutans were getting married.  (Maybe those anti-gay marriage folks were right in that it would lead to animal marriages??!)\n\nAnyways, we all know it's not the greatest of zoos because it's freaking hot half the year and it's not super nice to subject a lot of animals to 115 degrees.  But it's a decent enough selection, they have friendly staff, it's clean, and they have free parking. GD I love me some free parking.\n\nLots of the \"learn more by pressing this button\" things didn't work.  At least one water fountain didn't work (but hey- it was conveniently next to an overpriced soda machine!).  Like most other zoos they make you exit through the gift shop, so your wee ones can spend the car ride home crying about how they didn't get x overpriced toy/stuffed animal.\n\nI do think if your kids are young enough, you could probably just take them past the ticket counter and check out the animals you can see below the bridge/in the water. Those ducks, fish and turtles are FREE to see, and what 1 or 2-year old needs the whole menagerie anyways?", "business_id": "1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-11-08", "type": "review"}

They will also love the smaller, closer exhibits, like the \"Small Wonders\" house where you can see snakes and other creepy crawlers.\n\nIt is a ton of walking, so either rent a stroller if you have kids or bring a wagon or stroller of your own. :)\n\nStill a great place to spend the day with the kids on a cooler day.. not in the heat of the summer.", "business_id": "1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-11-11", "type": "review"}

It is an awesome zoo that left a strong impression on me when I visited in 2004. Fast forward eight years, and we drove over 200 miles from Las Vegas to Phoenix to see it. The Phoenix Zoo is so awesome that if I had the power, I would trade the best Las Vegas casino for the Phoenix Zoo. Since I don't have that power, I will write a review of why the Phoenix Zoo is so awesome.Instead of repeating facts such as admission is $20, I broke the review into sections. Each section discusses the awesome characteristics of the sections of the zoo.\n\nTropics Trail\n\n  As Phoenix builds a bigger and better Phoenix Zoo, the temporary entrance is near Tropics Trail at the far right . This is where visitors get their first impressions of the Phoenix Zoo. The highlight exhibits are the elephant, jaguar, tortoise, iguana, Andean Bear, rhinoceros, anteater, flamingo, and manned wolf. \n\nChildren's Trail\n\n  The southeast section of the Phoenix Zoo is more than a children's zoo. Because it sits on the south side of water it is a hot spot for waterfowl viewing. On the path to the petting zoo is emu, bald eagles, an island showcasing siamang, warty pigs, and ocelot. The highlight of the Children's Trail is the Harmony Farm. Grownup children will also enjoy the Big Red Barn and windmill house.\n\nThe Main Lake\n\n  The Main Lake is the central right area of Phoenix Zoo where the walkways circle Main Lake. Besides the Main Lake; the highlight exhibits include Land of the Dragons, two islands showcasing lemur, otter, flamingos, and gibbon. For an additional expense there is a camel ride. By this time you might be hungry or thirsty. The Cavern Cafe serves decent food and soft drinks.\n\nAfrica Trail\n\n  The Africa Trail sits at the back center of Phoenix Zoo. The highlight exhibits are cheetahs, African wild dog, baboons, mandrils, warthogs, lions, and tigers.\n\nArizona Trail\n\n  The Arizona Trail is my favorite area of the Phoenix Zoo. It is here that a visit to the zoo changes into a hike into wild Arizona. The bighorn sheep exhibit is off the charts well done. The bighorn sheep exhibit incorporates a real mountain. This is the exhibit that leaves an imprint that Phoenix Zoo is awesome. It could be the best bighorn sheep exhibit in the country. Throughout Arizona Trail, natural Arizona treats the zoogoer to four star scenery and first rate pictures. It is the part of the zoo where bunny rabbits outpopulate wild animals. The Wild Arizona Trail, in my opinion is worth $10 of the $20 admission.\n\n  The Arizona Trail is discontinuous. To the left of the Zoo Plaza there is a more developed Arizona Trail. Here the highlight exhibits are bobcats, Mexican Wolf, Mountain lion, and pronghorn. This is also where the First Aid Station is located.\n\nThe Savanna\n\n  The Savanna is the center of the Phoenix Zoo. In the future it will be the main entrance. It serves as the plaza and savanna section of the Phoenix Zoo. Here you have Savanna Grill (my brother said there burgers are good) and Karibu Cafe. This is where the gift shop is. The main Safari Train Station is here. The highlight exhibit is a savanna showcasing giraffes, eland, and zebras. There is also a stingray bay.\n\nThe Exit\n\n  I left the Phoenix Zoo impressed. I was disheartened that it closes at 4 p.m. and that Las Vegas does not have a Phoenix Zoo. Headed to my car, it was time to explore more of Phoenix. Phoenix Zoo is near downtown Phoenix and Tempe, and Arizona Mills.", "business_id": "1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-11-16", "type": "review"}

It was very disappointing even those we got to the zoo at 8am, there are no animals to see, it is so hot they hide in their house.  After working for like an hour, I was thinking it what a waste of money & I was pissed & thinking I want my money BACK! Hey 4 tickets is a lot to paid & nothing to see. It is so hot in a 3 digits degree. There are some places you have to pay additional money for the rides.  Finally, we come to the money village. This house 15 cute Squirrel Monkeys & the cool part is you get to go inside the cage to get close to them. Off course, you can't touch them & there are many zoo keeper there to keep the monkeys from attacking you & from you touching the monkeys. Another place in the zoo which makes our money worth is the stingrays feeding. Off course, you have to pay additional money to go in & buy the food (fish & shrimps) to feed the stingrays.  There are 31 stingrays in the tank.  FYI, if you gonna let you kids feed the stingrays, you have to be there at noon, lunch time.  Also you must bring a change of clothes for your kid to change afterward, because the smell from the stingray's food (frozen fishes & shrimps) smell HORRIBLE.  We been to bigger & better zoo with much animals & many other activities to for kids to do. However, feeding the stingrays & be in the cage with the monkeys are the 2 things other zoo don't have. At least these 2 activities make my money worth because my niece & nephew loved it.  Will not return, one time is enough.", "business_id": "1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-09-05", "type": "review"}

It's really nice to stop in for an hour to an hour and a half, take a look, and then return at your convenience to tour the rest of the zoo.

It is a good zoo in the sense that they have a great selection of desert and African animals. That being said, it is the most commercialized zoo I've ever been to. I would expect this at a theme park, but not at a non-profit museum or zoo. You have to pay extra for EVERYTHING here: the train, the carousel, feeding the animals, going to a special exhibit (the bat rays). They even have a zip line and photo booths to squeeze more out of you. And at the end, you have to go THROUGH the gift shop to get out. Not by it, through it. It makes for an unpleasant experience with kids, who of course want to ride the carousel every time, and want to look at and buy all the toys at the end. I would rather pay more for a membership and then not have to bring extra cash EVERY time I go to the zoo just to ride the carousel or see the bat rays.

We have also seen the orangutans being fed corn on the cob and their keepers being available to answer questions as well. Very nice and knowledgeable staff, and I learned a lot.

The Phoenix Zoo cost $20 per adult (Cheyenne Moutain Zoo was $17.25 which included the Will Rogers Shrine in the price) and it felt wasted in comparison to the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo, in CO Springs they had a system you could donate to what animal exhibit you wanted included in your ticket price and the Phoenix Zoo did not. I felt like the CO Springs Zoo was way better in both the animals you got to see and the huge amount of activities in comparison to the Phoenix Zoo and experience was greater in CO Springs compared to the Phoenix Zoo. The animals at the Phoenix Zoo felt farther away, the animals themselves had lots of room to move around in but it meant if you wanted a close up of the animals it was pretty difficult and that was rather apparent.\n\nThe Phoenix Zoo was expensive, included a lot of walking for seemingly not a lot of animals and it felt like most of the animals were missing, not on exhibit or just too irritated to want to be seen. There also wasn't that many daily events going on... in comparison to my experience at the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo. I'm sure the Phoenix Zoo at night is pretty cool but this Zoo experience wasn't spectacular during the day. I'm not really a fan of this place and probably won't return. There was some pretty cool things but they cost extra ($3/$2) per attraction within the zoo. Water itself was $3.29. Food prices were obviously very expensive as well and I'd recommend packing in your own water, food, and avoiding expensive prices at this zoo. On the other hand this place is like a kid paradise, so if you have kids they will probably enjoy an experience here much more than an adult or older family hangout.", "business_id": "1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-11-23", "type": "review"}

We were in AZ over Thanksgiving weekend visiting my parents and decided to take my kids to the zoo. This is a very good sized zoo, and my favorite part is that the animals are not in tiny little cages. They have habitats. The safari habitat was awesome, it was so big that you had to search for the large animals, and once you spotted them they were peacefully eating or relaxing. My 4 year old got to ride a camel with her dad for $5. It's a short camel ride, but definitely did the trick for her.\n\nSnacks and beverages are pretty pricey ($4 for a small bottle of Dasani water), and they don't check bags so I would assume you are welcome to bring in your own. Definitely do that unless you want to spend a quick $20 at the snack counter.\n\nWe must have shown up during the universal animal nap time lol because quite a few of them were sleeping. Of course that doesn't affect any kind of rating because animals have to sleep too! The male and female lions were snuggled up next to each other for their nap, which was super adorable. \n\nAdmission isn't bad, it was about $75 for 3 adults, one child, and my son was free. We got the general admission tickets because by the time we got there they were 3 hours from closing. They do have more options which include a sting ray exhibit, a 4D theatre experience, and the camel ride.\n\nI would definitely come back to this zoo, and hope that it isn't nap time again so we can observe the animals doing something other than snuggling the day away.", "business_id": "1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-11-30", "type": "review"}

It has a nice, well equipped fitness center and a large pool with hot tub.  Also has a grilling area with 2 gas grills beside the pool.  Each townhome has its own garage and can hold one car (one bedroom unit) or 2 cars (2/3 bedroom unit).  Office staff is always friendly and will act immediately on most repairs or complaints.   I'd say the only challenges here are the flights of steps you have to climb in the apartments, moderate amount of noise through the walls and the electricity cost during the summer.  I HIGHLY recommend getting a unit that has North/South facing windows.  If you get a unit that faces East/West, the sun will heat up your apartment and you will be paying a much higher electric bill during the summer.  The North/South facing units avoid the summer direct sunlight and will save you money.  Other costs to keep in mind are the separate gas, water and trash fees each month.  Those are about $35-$65+ depending how much water you use.  My bill averages $35 for the utilities and $15 for the gas with 2 people and we are very conservative.  Just some numbers to keep in mind.

Other people complained about the management and we really didn't have any issues, so we didn't need to work with management too often. Whenever we had issues we would put in a work order it would be fixed quickly.\n\nSome of the negatives were:\n\n- there was supposed to be a movie theater that they were upgrading, this was under construction the whole time we lived there. don't really know how much we would've used it anyways.\n\n-  the gym definitely does the job for an apartment gym. My gripe with the gym is that a lot of young kids would go in there and play. Can't blame the kids, I am sure it was fun for them, but they should enforce the rule better against unsupervised children in the gym if there even is one.\n\n- Bathrooms: It is a weird setup. Apparently the three bedroom has a half bath downstairs, but the one and two bedroom have both bathrooms upstairs. It is definitely better to have them up there instead of downstairs, but it could be kinda annoying to have to have your guest go upstairs to use the restroom.\n\nOverall i was happy with my experience here and would recommend this complex for a young adult looking for somewhere to live.", "business_id": "tbV2PnTuo7xo1O0RVFzhdg", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-10-02", "type": "review"}

I moved from Scottsdale to East Phoenix for cheaper living. My roommate and I decided on this place. I was nervous initially because I thought cheaper meant there would be sacrifices to be made. In fact, this place provided a better living experience than my ritzy Scottsdale apartment. \n\nThe staff here is great. They are down to Earth individuals who will help you with whatever you need if you ask nicely. I have never had a problem with those people and can see they really care about their tenants, and in a complex with over 700 units, they can actually remember your name. \n\nMy roommate and I only encountered a few maintenance problems. Occasionally, our washing machine would malfunction, thankfully without clothes inside. It just wouldn't start. This happened about 3 times, and each time we reported it, within a few days, there would be someone along to fix it. No big deal. We also had a leak in the air conditioning for a few days. It was during the summer and was able to fill up a few buckets worth of water. Once reported, maintenance was again quick on the scene and helped us out. Never had that problem again.\n\nAs for pests, RMV does a good job on keeping them out. I did encounter a roach in my pantry once, however. That was in September and it was only one. It's surprising because my apartment in particular is right next to Papago Park, essentially the wilderness, and we never had a bug/scorpion problem.\n\nAs for location, it is centrally located between Scottsdale, Tempe, and Sky Harbor Airport, 3 of my most frequently visited places. And having Papago Park as a backyard is great. I'm outdoorsy and whatnot, so that was a sweet deal. Never going to live in a place without hiking trails in my backyard ever again.\n\nUnfortunately, I had to part ways due to a job change and price, the only negative. I now work up near Happy Valley, so the 35-40 commute on I17 is a pain and a half. The rent is high for the area too. I think a good rule of thumb is $1 per sq ft. when looking for an apartment. RMV is now around $940 for a 2 bedroom with 850 sq ft. A little high. \n\nI enjoyed my time here.

I moved in Sept 2010 and have always paid my rent early, taken good care of my apartment and generally never had an issue. When I moved into my 518 square foot apartment I paid $585 a month for it. (This includes the pet rent) Over the course of 5 years my rent has slightly increased every year. Of course, this was to be expected. They updated my applicances when I requested and they offered incentives for renewing your lease. I had a beautiful accent wall painted and my place looks amazing. I truly love living there and dont plan to move anytime soon. \n Unfortunately that is the reason why I'm writing this review. Over 5 years my rent has increased a reasonable ~$100 (so I'm paying $690 a month + $100 more in utilities). When I went in to renew my lease this year they informed me they are raising my rent almost $100 a month for this next year. I was shocked. I cant imagine budgeting for this. $800 a month (+ $100 utilities) for a 518 sq foot apartment? I live alone, I am not sharing rent responsibilities with anyone else. My paycheck just doesnt have an extra $100 in it every month to spare. I went in to plead my case and they told me they are unable to negotiate at all and they recommended I choose a 7 month lease instead (as it's $30 less a month). \n I read an earlier comment about another resident having the impression of them not wanting to retain tenants. Why would they want to coerce me into a shorter lease? Perhaps, because they want a sooner opportunity to raise my rent again? I am disheartnened. I hope I can work it out. Weidner is a giant corperation and I am one person, but this is my home and I dont want to lose it.", "business_id": "MfqEPdcw0UYVdDoV3p77tQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-10-28", "type": "review"}

Luckily, I found Dean's on Yelp and the three good reviews had me heading over there to figure out what was wrong with my gas tank and gas gauge. Right away over the phone, I was given the rundown that the estimate is free and they would even shuttle me back to my place while the process unfolded. When I arrived at Dean's, there were several older women waiting for their cars to be fixed and they were telling me that this place has been around for over 50 years and they have been bringing their cars in for decades to get fixed which was comforting. There are photos on the wall of years gone past and that says they have been doing something right. As for my car, Grant found a way to get into my tank through the trunk saving several hours in labor costs and also identified other parts I needed as he figured out my problem. My car was bought used so i didn't know it needed a new battery and fuel filter, which I am glad they discovered. I was kept mostly informed of the timetable for my repairs and even though my vehicle had the worst case scenario (Fuel pump), it was easy to be impressed with the detail-oriented mechanics (calling all over for best price on parts and breaking car talk down to the basics), friendly front-desk people and long-time customers who keep coming back which now includes me.", "business_id": "osI3BT6AagWA-ravXrmK3w", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-11-03", "type": "review"}

Unfortunately not. I'm usually like those of you who get too lazy to complain even if there's something wrong and usually there's not much that bothers you. However, this was my first car I bought with my hard-earned money and I wanted this to be a special event. I bought it last week but it was raining all last week so I waited and waited until today. So I scoured through my fellow Yelpers to help me pick a car wash that has great reviews. My eyes locked on World Class Car Wash and I spared no expense. I purchased the full detail $49 and Hand Wax $20. \n\nI told them that the previous owner had window stickers and decal everywhere. I told them about something he stuck on the dashboard and a residue that remained. I pointed them all out and I thought with paying $70 total for everything I would get some attention on things I specifically asked about. However, much to my dismay, the stickers and decal remained. I asked them to remove it and I thought it was good. Even up until then, I wanted to be happy so I just left. As I was driving my car I noticed gunk all over the window. The guy who was scraping with the razor to get the decals and stickers off didn't bother to throw decal residue out after scraping them. Everything remained. As I checked more later, I noticed candy wrappers from the previous owner still there but this time soaked breadcrumbs from being watered during the detailing process. It was nasty digging my hands down there to collect all the wrappers. \n\nI was very disappointed. This was my first car and I wanted it to be an experience.

A few months ago, I had a great experience learning about authentic Sichuan from Helen Y when she invited me to join her at Szechwan Palace in the Chinese Cultural Center, and this past weekend, she invited my husband and me, along with some other very fortunate Yelpers, including David S B, Jason W, and Alexander C, to eat some more amazing and authentic Chinese at Lao Ching Hing (according to her review, their Chinese menu features mostly Shanghainese food with some Sichuan dishes and a few Cantonese dishes). \n\nJust as at Szechwan Palace, the atmosphere of the restaurant was nothing special. In fact, it was a little messy, at least in the little area with the large round table where they sat us - we were surrounded by all of these rows of boxes and random containers. Oh, well - atmosphere aside, the service was friendly and prompt (our waters were always kept full), and the food was incredible. So that you are able to order some more authentic items, I'll give you a breakdown of what Helen ordered for us off the Chinese menu (which she has so generously translated and posted to the business info section of this review): \n\n*Cold jellyfish in scallion oil - This had a nice semi-chewy texture (reminded me of octupus) and a vinegary sauce. Reminded me of kim chi, which I love. \n*Wok-fried rice cakes - Little oval noodles (same texture as Chow Fun) in a savory light sauce with fresh, crunchy vegetables\n*1/2 crispy duck - Tender meat with crispy skin; served with Hoisin sauce\n*\"Ants Climbing Up a Tree\" - Unusual name but tasty dish. It was vermicelli (thin noodles) with a minced meat and chili sauce. \n*Whole salt and pepper shrimp - These were crispy and had the perfect amount of salt and pepper coating. The shrimp themselves were a little fishy, though. Highly recommend eating them whole (including the eyes!)\n*Beef tendon and tripe in scallion oil - I wasn't wild about the texture, but the spicy sauce was really savory and flavorful.\n*Soup dumplings - Little dumplings filled with soup broth that you have to eat in one big bite. They were good, but I preferred the ones that we had at Szechwan Palace. \n*Fish pieces w/ sauce - I could be wrong, but I think these were  the \"spicy soybean paste with sliced fish\" from the menu. They were very bony and difficult to eat, but I enjoyed the flavor. \n*Peking spare ribs - Delicious! Had the most savory sauce and really tender meat. \n*Drunken chicken - Not a huge fan of this dish. The chicken was a bit dry, instead of falling off the bone, and the skin wasn't crispy at all. \n*Chopped Shanghainese greens with tofu in sesame oil  - Served cold. Was really flavorful and light and would be great as a vegetarian appetizer. \n*Sauteed \"snake\" gourd with soy beans - To the best of my knowledge, this consisted of pieces of sauteed squash with soy beans in a clear, mild sauce. The vegetables were cooked perfectly, and the sauce was the perfect complement. \n*Steamed and deep-fried bun - This came in the shape of a long roll that we had to cut into individual pieces. It was delicious doughy and slightly crispy on the outside and was fabulous dipped in some chili sauce. \n*Green onion pancake - This has always been one of my favorite authentic Chinese dishes and has a wonderful mealy texture. Again, excellent dipped in chili sauce!\n*Deep-fried shredded potato - Being that we went at 11:30 on a Sunday, my eye was drawn to this hash-brown-like dish. Didn't regret my choice because it was delicious. Comprised of undercooked and crunchy potato slices in a sauce with chiles. \n\nOne note - nothing we got was ridiculously spicy, but the chili sauce that comes on the table allows you to spice everything to taste and added flavor (and not just mind-numbing heat) to every dish I tried. \n\n15 dishes! I may have forgotten to mention a dish or two, but as you can see, we had a veritable Shanghai feast! In this day and age, feasts usually cost a pretty penny, but the 9 of us walked out having only spent $20 each. Paying that little money for so much incredible and authentic food is just freaking incredible.

I couldn't order the fried rice, because it contains peas (I've learned to ask...childhood trauma).  The rice was clotted together and difficult to eat.  The kung pao chicken contained a suspiciously generous amount of meat...so much so that I questioned whether it was actually chicken.  I watch too many movies.  The egg roll was just gross.

I wasn't in the mood for an alcoholic beverage, but there was a variety of  bottled beers that I could see in the stand up cooler behind the cash-wrap for those wishing to imbibe. \n\nI ordered the Rolled Taco combination plate. I had three rolled tacos (basically chimichangas). They were filled with shredded chicken and deep-fried, then covered with cheese sauce, and lettuce. Rice and re-fried beans were served as sides, and a slice of avocado was the garnish.

It is very authentic, looks like a total dive from the outside, and it's in a Hispanic neighborhood. But, the tacos here are great! Now, just to be clear, these are street style tacos, they are small, but they are only $0.99/each, which seems pretty reasonable. \n\nI ordered an adobada, al pastor, carnitas, and a shredded beef with red chiles. Each were very good in their own unique ways, the meat was good quality and everything had the appropriate amounts of seasoning and flavor. The adobada was the standout in my mouth, so much that I had to go back and order another one! I also had a side of rice and beans, which were good, but nothing out of the ordinary. \n\nSo far so good, right? The only slip up this place maybe has, is that my girlfriend, that was with me, who doesn't eat meat, was not overly impressed. She got a bean and cheese burrito and a shrimp taco. The shrimp taco looked good, and she said everything tasted alright, but she was not wowed, like I was, about the quality of the tacos. She did enjoy the beans and rice though. So, this place might not be the best veg friendly location, but I'm not really going to take off for that, because it is very authentic, and veg friendly isn't necessarily what they are trying to do. They are trying to make good, traditional tacos, and that they do that very well. \n\nThey also serve beer here, and I love the way it's served. Your bottle or can is brought out with a mug that is frosted, salted, and has lime juice in the bottom. Speaking of bringing you the glass, the service is wonderful.

After a few recommendations, we decided to try it for take out. We wanted a good variety of foods, so we ordered cheese enmoladas, a gordita, a chile relleno combo, a pastor burrito combo, chilaquiles verdes and a pambazo. All of this food for us to share and the best part of it was the salsa, which they happened to charge us for. \n\nThe cheese enmoladas were stuffed with a dry, flavorless shredded chicken. The gordita wasn't too horrible, but was definitely understuffed. The chile relleno seemed as if it was stuffed a few days prior. The cheese had a brownish color and was slimy with a gritty texture when rubbed between the fingers. The pastor burrito was very small, understuffed and was served on a cold tortilla. The tortilla was actually still ice cold on the bottom of the burrito by the time we got home, so the filling must have not been very hot either. \nChilaquiles verdes were a complete joke. It was seriously a handful of chips, a small spoonful of green salsa and a tiny sprinkling of cheese. It did come with some sort of a pollo asado on top, which is unique and it was flavorful, but it was very old and dry. It is served with just beans and some iceberg lettuce, but for $8, this is no bueno. Something also caused the bottom of the container to melt, so I had to transfer it to another plate, but I still found pieces of styrofoam in my food. The pambazo was flavorful and pretty decent. The filling (chorizo and potatoes) had some sort of a bitterness to it. I think maybe the potatoes or chorizo were burnt, but it was one of the better dishes. The combos were also served with rice and beans. The rice was old and hard. I'm certain that it had been out the entire day. The beans served on all of our dishes were entirely inedible. They had a really funky sour taste, so they were either spoiled or just plain bad. Either way, discarded all of them. The salsa that we were given and charged for was really great! It was a red salsa and tasted like it was homemade. \n\nWe did order 30 minutes prior to closing, so we figured that a lot of the issues were due to the late order, but the food was really unacceptable. If they didn't have quality food to serve or it was ready to be thrown out, just tell us that you're not longer taking orders. It really sucks to pay for something and then have to discard at least a 1/3 of it. After all of this, we would still try El Nopalito again because of people's recommendations, but only if someone else was paying.

I kept looking to Scottsdale for somewhere to eat. We've got just about everything else, from real-deal taco shacks, to excellent Pho, to fine dining. But no real Chinese food. I was looking the wrong way. Up til recently, I would drive all the way to Wong's Place in Tempe just for the real stuff.\n\n\nTHE CHINESE CULTURAL CENTER\nI shop regularly at what used to be Ranch99, that oasis in the desert that makes you feel like you've been transported to the Hell that is Riverside CA. I've tried numerous restaurants in the mall over the years and always been disappointed. The one I never managed to try is the Szechwan Palace. I expected it to be just another Gringonese disaster. Man was I wrong. We eat out maybe once or twice a week, and we've hit this place at least once a week since we found it a few months ago.\n\n\nSZECHWAN PALACE\nI love you, Palace. Dan Dan Noodles. Spice. Yu Xiang dishes. We've been when it's packed full of high maintenance Chinese businessmen and when we're one of 4 tables in the place. Every time, the tiny kitchen and the wonderful servers keep their smiles in place and just give you that little shake of the head that says: \"Solly, it clazy tonight!\" Even though this place pleases real Chinese food lovers, there's plenty of stuff to keep my Jewish mother-in-law happy too (\"happy\" is a relative term).\n\n\nTHINGS I LOVE\n  - Wan Fu: the worst white wine in the world (that I love)\n  - Dan Dan Noodles with extra hot chile\n  - Yu Xiang Shrimp\n  - Mongolian Beef with real beef, not that over-marinated rubbery crap\n  - Fresh veggies that still have some color and snap to them\n  - Incredibly spicy Water-boiled dishes\n  - Any of their soups\n\nWong's thick-skinned pot stickers are still the best, but everything else at the Palace rules.\n\n\nBOTTOM LINE\nIt's hard for me to imagine a bad review being credible unless some key person was missing or they were ridiculously understaffed and got slammed. We've been there for one of those nights though, and it was still very good, once we eventually got served. As others have said: get the real menu as you walk in.

Both the Chinese and Americanized menus are written in English including the description of the dishes. Also, you can ask the waiter to explain the specials. You don't have to speak Chinese or be Chinese to know the specials. After dining here, I realize some people want to sound unique or VIP but trust me, you don't have to be Chinese to taste all the dishes. That is B.S.\n\n2. The Yelp photos donated by members make the dishes appear larger than they are. Most of the sauteed dishes like the Kung Pao chicken and Egglant were not big but then some like the Water Boil chicken was rather big.\n\n3. The food is spicy but it isn't hot. If I had to compare it to a Thai restaurant, the food is about a 5 on a 10 scale. You will probably need to ask them to make it spicier even if you are not one of those crazy people that have to eat everything hot. \n\n4. They do NOT use reheated rice. I was expecting reheated rice that you typically find at Wongs and other Chinese restaurants. This place had fresh soft and sticky rice. It was great.\n\n5. Don't take the American menu for granted. It's done pretty well and includes mainstream meats like chicken, beef, pork. The Chinese menu has tripe and meats not typically eaten by Americans which is why it's left off the American menu. You will likely use the American menu as your base and then use the Chinese menu to add select items. Bottomline: get both menus\n\n6. The restaurant is not a hole in the wall. It's the opposite. It's the nicest Chinese restaurant I've been to in the valley. Yes it is small but stylish and well lit\n\n7. The restaurant is definitely busy but not stand in line busy. We were immediately seated and we went on a Friday night at peak hour. \n\n8. The service was suprisingly good. Like most great and authentic Chinese restaurants, the service is lousy with the waiters being expressionless and forcing you to order quickly.

We read the reviews before going to this place with full intention of ordering off the black menu... Unfortunately we are boring white people who were too scared of the unknown dishes so we ordered orange chicken, mongolian beef, general tsao's chicken, crab wontons, beef chow mein, sweet and sour soup, and egg rolls. The soup was great, warm, spicy, big chunks of tofu and pork. Everything else was mediocre at best. The entrees were nothing more than goopy cornstarch sauce with little to-no flavor, the meats and vegetables in everything seemed to be fresh and of good quality but were coated in batter and perhaps just barely fried- leaving them covered in soggy mush that has absorbed the goopy flavorless sauces. Nothing other than the soup was spicy, not even a hint of heat- never-mind the little pepper next to the items on the menu indicating the heat level. It was a giant waste of money and if we hadn't ordered take-out we definitely would have gotten our money back. We've now got a fridge full of left-overs that we're dreading eating. I wouldn't recommend this place at all. I imagine the black menu is tastier, but it's ridiculous to have two menus with food of completely different quality levels rather than levels of authenticity. \n\nMoral of the story: Gross.

For the unfamiliar its not even related to the black peppercorn, for the familiar its spice properties can be quite magical. Actually the dried berry husk from the prickly ash tree, the USDA banned the peppercorn from 1968-2006. The peppercorn was seen as a hazard due to the potential of carrying citrus canker, a harmful bacteria to citrus crops. The process of heating them to 160 degrees kills any possible bacteria thus lifting the ban. Szechwan Palace, located in the Chinese Cultural Center, celebrates this daily. If you've ever tasted such dishes as Ma Po Tofu or Kung Poa Chicken, then you've had Szechwan cooking before.\n\nThe funny thing about these peppercorns is that they're not even really that spicy. At first the flavor might have a certain peppery pungency that gives way to more of a citrus like aftertaste. Though here's the kicker, as you eat them you might feel your tongue start to tingle then eventually go slightly numb. This sensation is strangely addictive, like getting a shot of Novocain; it might just leave you drooling over your plate.\n\nFor the unadventurous Szechwan Palace does serve your standard type Chin-American food like egg rolls and pork fried rice, but this isn't a strong point. Id skip those items and go right for the more unique dishes, be sure to ask for the full menu rather than the standard \"best of\" version.\n\nBeing a fan of offal and other not so famous cuts of beef, I ordered up the #3 Beef Tendon in Spicy Sauce ($6.95). Fresh cilantro and chewy slices of tendon are mixed with peppercorn oil were a hit. I know that dish isn't for everyone but trust me, its tasty. By contrast the #9 Spicy Cucumber ($3.95) is a little more approachable with cool pieces of raw cucumber seasoned with peppercorns and dried chilies.\n\nThere are a slew of dishes titled \"water boiled\" though none that I have tried seem to be in water. Instead you get a luxurious sauce filled with peppercorns, vegetables and meat or fish. This outing included the #18 Water Boiled Beef ($9.95), fork tender strips of beef in a velvety pepper spiked sauce made my tongue sparkle then go numb. Like I said, these peppercorns are magical.\n\nMy absolute favorite dish was the #98 Rice Cake ($7.95). The thin chewy disks of rice noodles, ground pork and cabbage were bathed in a slightly sweet and smoky sauce was craveable. \n\nWhen ordering the Special Cumin Lamb with Bone ($11.95), Id venture to say that they use the word lamb loosely. The difference between a lamb and a sheep is age and this directly reflects the flavor of the meat. The younger lamb is sweet and tender where sheep aka mutton tends to be extremely gamy and tough, these were definitely the later. No amount of fragrant cumin could cover the extreme gaminess of the meat. This may have been isolated since on a previous visit the dish was exceptional.\n\nWith over 100 choices on the menu plus daily specials, Szechwan Palace brings a whole new level of spice, even if it does numb your tongue.", "business_id": "yQONzVpX-DEpGSuKMIov6A", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-11-26", "type": "review"}

Well, it didn't.\n\nThat's not to say it's not like 1000x better than any other \"Americanized\" Chinese restaurant out there (Also, it's hilarious that they have a an actual section of the menu called \"Americanized Chinese\"), but when comparing Apple to Apples (which I always do when it comes to restaurants like this) Miu's is a 5 and Szechwan is about a 3. Here's my deal (and i ordered my exact order):\n\n1) Spicy cucumbers were warm  One of the most delightful aspects of this dish is the cool temperature combined with the heat.  Warm cucumber are gross.\n\n2) Dan Dan noodles were standard. Much cheaper than Miu's though so that got them a star\n\n3) Spicy Lamb Ribs were a little weak. I get that I'm a white girl drinking pinot grigio, but a can handle my heat.  Please don't coddle me. \n\nBasically, if you need szechwan in the area, which I do, I'm glad they are here.  But if you are looking for top notch food, go to miu's.  If you're looking for top notch service, don't get chinese, because it sucks everywhere.", "business_id": "yQONzVpX-DEpGSuKMIov6A", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-11-09", "type": "review"}

There are so many things I want to try. Eating here did however require that I take considerable time to study the menu, and that I ask lots of questions. \n\nWhen I was arrived shortly after they opened for lunch, I was seated quickly, and provided a menu and water. From the moment I was seated, every minute or two someone approached me to take my order. I finally explained that this was my first time and that I needed to be left alone for a bit. Mission accomplished. No one else approached until I put the menu down on the table and closed it.\n\nI ordered hot tea, and from their Authentic Szechwan menu, C107 - Spinach in Garlic Sauce and C124 - Yangzhou Style Fried Rice with egg, shrimp, chicken, roasted pork and peas and carrots in a white sauce (not the usual dark colored fried rice). \n\nMy food didn't take long to be prepared, and was fresh and satisfying. The Spinach was perfectly seasoned and cooked. A nice mild dish with lots of garlic aroma and flavor in a lovely light sauce. The Yangzhou Style fried rice was not like any other fried rice I have had before, and if I hadn't read the description carefully and seen the picture, I would have been confused by it. The shrimp and the chicken in the dish were particularly delicate, moist and delicious and clearly cooked to order. The roast pork was chopped into roughly 1/4 inch cubes, and the rice was mildly flavored and had a sort of melt in your mouth texture. I needed to add a bit of soy sauce to the dish, along with a small amount of hot oil for bite, but I ate as much of it as I could. The leftovers of both dishes reheated well at home in the microwave (loosely covered).\n\nAt no point did I lack for service, with servers constantly checking back with me.\n\nMy only disappointment was that I could not try everything I wanted to, including items from the \"Americanized\" menu - such as Egg Foo Yung - which I didn't go for this time because I was a little disappointed that the ingredients (peas, carrots, meat, whatever) are all served over the patties in brown sauce rather than inside of the patties. Only onion and bean sprouts are cooked in the patties. When I go back again, I'm going to go for it and see how I like it. It was also a bit pricey, but now that I've experienced the equality of other menu items, I'll spring for it.\n\nWhen I finished my meal and pushed my plates away, my check was brought immediately, along with take-out containers for my leftovers. The payment process went quickly, and soon I had my delicious left-overs in my car to smell all the way home.", "business_id": "yQONzVpX-DEpGSuKMIov6A", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-09-16", "type": "review"}

Let's get the bad out of the way first.  For years, Costco Tire Center was my goto for tires.  Then, the Michelin tires starting blowing up on me.  To be fair, I am hard on tires.  But blowouts are hard on vehicles, so I stopped getting tires at Costco. \n\n I can't really think of much more bad, unless you consider they keep moving the inventory around, so you are always looking for that stuff you bought last time, because it's not where it was before.  Sometimes when you see that thing that you just gotta have, but cannot really afford it?  Well, you better bite, because it may not be there the next time.  Prices are great, but you have to buy in bulk.  This is okay for things that will keep, but stuff like bread and pastries- you better really like because you are either gonna get tired of them or they spoil.  I use a vacuum sealer for stuff I don't think will last.\n\nI like that you can get more organic stuff now.  We buy as much organic as we can afford, and Costco is good for things like Half/half and eggs.  We go through a lot of half and half.  Gas?  you bet.  Always priced great.

Now I have nothing against seniors as I'm nearly one myself, but they do have a tendency to walk slowly and leave their carts blocking aisles.

This is the closest walk in clinic to my work place so I have ventured here out of convenience.  The first time was last summer and I just felt ill all over.  After a total of 3 hours here they did not know what was wrong with me but were going to treat me like I had strep throat. Three hours is not too long to wait if the lobby had been full but there were only about 3 others waiting with me and what seemed like an army of employees.  I was in the actual exam room for what seemed like 2.5 hours.  They were \"kind\" enough to give me a blanket which looked like someone had vomited all over it and then it dried to a crusty finish.  The nurses kept coming in and checking on me; taking blood pressure  and temperature and demanded I take a pregnancy test.  I told them it was highly unlikely I was preggers (since I was not getting any but I felt they did not need to know all my extra cirricular activities or lack there of so I obliged them).  Finally they wrote me a prescription and I was on my way.   They never gave me the results of my pregnancy test but I was able to figure it out! \n\nSo, feeling ill and desperate I decided to give it one more chance yesterday but found myself disgusted as soon as I walked in.  There was a sign that read:  Due to technical difficulties we can not accept credit or debit cards.  Only cash or checks.  Well, I forgot my check book (since it's not 1987)  and don't carry cash so I asked the receptionist if I could put my name down and then run to the ATM about 2 blocks away.  She was at a loss for words but then basically told me no.  There were 8 people ahead of me!  I doubt they would get to the other 8 in the ten minutes it would take for me to go to the ATM.\n\nUpset and ill I remembered another clinic that I have been told is nice and I was on my way.", "business_id": "uuv2IsWkbW7zdyYfWbU_Mw", "stars": 1, "date": "2008-09-04", "type": "review"}

If I didn't work in the building across the street I doubt I would have ever gone into this corner building, strip mall, dive bar unless something horrific was happening in the world, such as the zombie apocalypse, one in which I'm being chased by a hoard and my only salvation is to enter a dive bar where, more than likely, the servers will also be zombies and I'll be fucked pretty bad. \n\nThat said, the place kind of smells like musk and sadness and the two or three middle aged servers look like they've lived a lot of life.  There are always a few hunched over dudes at the bar, watching sports or maybe counting their misfortunes.  One server appears to have always just had something weird or traumatic happen to her before she takes our order, like she was just bitching at SRP for shutting her power off or she just found out her teenage son got arrested on drug charges- then she comes to take our order.  While the service has never been despicable, we always have to wait an unnecessary amount of time for our tab, which sucks since we're anxious to get back to our meaningless jobs.\n\nShe also asks us \"what flavor\" of beer we want, which confused me since, like, Blue Moon is not exactly a \"flavor\" as much it is, you know, a brand.  But I can look past this.  \n\nI've eaten a few things here and the worst and most unacceptable was a simple dinner salad which was literally wilted Iceburg, bag lettuce with an obscene amount of dressing.  I can only assume that they thought if they covered the wilted lettuce with enough fatty Ranch I wouldn't notice the lettuce was bad.  I did, but I didn't send it back, instead I ate it and drank beer and talked about how much better the director's cut of Bladerunner is. \n\nThe wings are mediocre, not crispy enough for me to say they're cooked well, not thick enough to call them plump, and not tasty enough to assume that the sauce is anything more than some Frank's Red Hot concoction with some added butter or someshit.\n\nI've also had the pleasure of the chicken \"fritters\" which are, you know, frozen chicken strips deep fried.  I order these most times I come here because they can't really fuck it up and you can't exactly go wrong with chicken strips.  I've also ordered the \"fire\" fries which are just their fries with Cayenne pepper on them, and they charge another 1.50 for this. \n\nWhat IS worth the trip across the way and the shady, low brow atmosphere are the two dollar burgers on Tuesdays.  I actually never order the burgers only because I'm not much of a burger person, but my regular co-workers tell me they're tasty, a cut above a fast food burger and cheaper.  (Though, consider that you're also leaving a tip for the service, not getting fries, and paying extra for cheese, so it's not THAT much of a better deal than fast food, just sayin'.) \n\nWhat I can't look past, why Dirty Drummer is only getting two stars, is the fact that the only reason we came here; the five dollar pitchers of domestics, are now, for some reason, NINE dollar pitchers which, needles to say, is absolutely not worth it, especially considering the skimpy size of the pitchers, the depressing atmosphere and the tore up servers.  After my co-worker noticed this new four dollar addition to the pitcher price he said, rather cleverly, \"looks like this is the last time we'll be drumming.\"\n\nAnd it was.", "business_id": "IgaruuknYwCr9afeDYQ_yw", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-11-23", "type": "review"}

The beer was fresh and our bartender, Nicole, was VERY friendly and outgoing. We noticed they had a couple of pool tables, so we mosied over and played a half dozen games. The coin-op pool table worked fine (always something of a question in a dive bar) and the bar cues weren't too horrible. And there was extra entertainment from the pool table next to us, where one guy was an unrelenting and shameless self-promoter.\n\nThis place is a sausage fest, at least during Monday Night Football. I think the bartender, the server, and my fiancee were the only women in the place. Lots of guys watching the football game and making some harmless noise.\n\nThis is not a place for snobs. It's a little neighborhood bar, not a \"destination\" bar. It's great for watching games, drinking beer and shooting pool with your neighbors.

No HH food specials, but they have domestic pints for $2.50 and a huge screen was playing the football game and other TV's had all the other games I needed. Quickly, I learned about the Drummer's signature burgers since I was sitting at the bar and the grill (like in some older drugstores and Waffle House) is actually in the bar area (see photo). THis is great as I enjoy watching my food and others cook, but it also exposes some flaws if you know what to look for. Ok, the bugers are clearly not frozen here and are the best part of meal. They are fresh balls of 1/3 pound of ground beef and chef throws it on grill and seasons it with some powder and then the signature move occurs about 10 minutes into cooking - red wine is poured onto the burger while cooking, producing some sexy steam. About 1/2 cup of wine is loaded on the burger (($6.95 with cheese, $2.95 on Tuesday) and then I went with swiss and mushroms (.75 cents) for toppings. Ok, here are some flaws to ponder. The Buns are from Sara Lee, the fries and onion rings are dumped out from bags, the cheese is a generic slice and mushrooms are canned. If your gonna give me an incredible burger experience at least don't cut corners on all the extras which in my mind are all part of the deal. I realize this isn't a gourmet joint, so I cut some slack and the burger was very tasty and cooked well, but I didn't taste any of the wine (not sure if I was supposed too), but maybe the cheese overwhelmed the wine taste. Only one other place in the area uses wine according to the cook who has been there on and off for 20 years.

We started this up to help and serve other parents that have children with special needs. We are Available to bring justice and help to all families and people that need it. This blog spot also helps parents find the the help they need to get their children the programs and financial help the state is required to give them because of their child's condition that most parents aren't aware of.

Not the best accompaniment for Mexican food in my opinion.\n\nAnyway, I went off their new Mex and Match portion of the menu.  It's a great option for those of you who want to try more than one thing or aren't really sure what to get.  The options are all reasonably priced too, staying well under 10 bucks.  I got a cheese enchilada and a beef tamale with refried beans.  The tamale was very tasty and the beef inside was very good.  The enchilada, I was not too impressed.  The cheese was bland and there were lots of onions in it.  Eww.  The red sauce on top was pretty tame, even for a lightweight like me.\n\nHonestly, I won't be back.

Maybe the employees were angry and washing their dirty hands in the salsa buckets. Don't know, don't care.\n\nThe Macayo's on Central (of ugly Mayan-themed building and President-dining fame) is different. This is the Denny's of Mexican food - always good, always middle America, lots of screaming kids, lame attempts at kitsch. I find that takeout is a much safer way to indulge in the artery-hardening goodness Macayo's has to offer.\n\nThere are many, many much enjoyed references to dear God, as well as the Mother Mary and her revered child on Yelp. Well, if the sweet baby Jesus was ever to ejaculate, it might taste like Macayo's Baja sauce, and I mean that in the most flattering manner, i.e., SBJ might also spout forth with Cinnabon frosting. Baja sauce is this cream-cheese based, vaguely sweet, vaguely spicy green chili-tinted fatty goopy sauce that can be ladled on virtually any plain Jane item... thus turning water into wine, or some business like that. The green corn tamale slathered in Baja sauce is a most guilty pleasure that always leaves me feeling fulfilled, but slightly unsettled and a tick guilty mixed with a dash of naughty. It's the one-night stand of condiments, no doubt.\n\nSo on nights like these, where my weekend's diet has already been ravaged by Harlow's, Delux, and the pseudo-red velvet cupcakes I made at home (chocolate cake mix + red food coloring), I just gotta say WTF -- Macayo's takeout it is.", "business_id": "jzPMl-NoB5F2fwoHX3hN8A", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-11-08", "type": "review"}

I tried Macayo's a few times and it was ok, then I moved on to greener pastures.\n\nFast forward 5 years, many mexican restaurants, and a major diet change and I am at Chase field enjoying a veggie burrito, beans, and rice all courtesy of Macayo's.

The cantina actually looked a bit more lively but we still opted for the dining area. \n\nThe waitress was actually very friendly and well rehearsed if nothing else, can't complain there.

The one thing about this location that always made me want to try it was the shape of the building. \n\nIt always reminded me of one of the Mayan pyramids built in Mexico. Anyways when you first walk in they have the usual set up, bar on one side with a few tables and a full dining section for the dinner and lunch crowd. We were seated right away and given a quick run down of everything half off(happy hour pricing). The beer selection is pretty standard and the price for a pitcher was kind of high as well but my friend was happy with having it all for himself since I do not drink.\n\nThe bite size tamale bites were good and the Steak Cortez was great as well. The only thing I would recommend is going before or after happy hour as it can get really crowed and it is hard to find a place to sit unless you are just having lunch or dinner. Also it can be hard to enjoy a meal with the loud sounds of people screaming at the T.V. as the dining area is really close to the bar area.

We were promptly seated at a table with plates, chips, and salsa but no napkins or utensils.\n\nLisa greeted us and took our drink orders. A considerable amount of time passed (all of the chips and salsa had been happily consumed) before Lisa returned with our drinks. Ten more minutes passed and we were left with empty chips/salsa bowls. During that time, we networked with other servers in an attempt to acquire napkins, utensils, and more chips/salsa.  \n\nGranted, we had a large party (eight adults, one kid, one toddler) and I can understand how busy working in the service field can be, but our drinks (which cost roughly $2.50 per drink) sat bone-dry for most of the time we were there. Even a pitcher of ice water at the table would have been helpful. \n\nI can forgive a lack of drinks, chips, and salsa but what truly irked me about our experience was when my grandfather's order was messed up.  The rest of us received our food (and ate it, for the most part, without any drinks) while my Grandfather, who would be footing the bill for his entire family, sat without any food, chips, salsa, or beverage and waited patiently for his order to be ready. Lisa even came back out a third time to verify his order. No one apologized to him, there was no offer to comp his meal - in fact, the incorrect order was still listed on the bill. \n\nDespite the way he was treated, my grandfather left a 20+ percent tip because that's just the kind of man he is - not because the service warranted it.\n\nAside from the recent one-star service, I can't pan the restaurant itself due to one bad experience. I've been there a few other times before and the service was excellent. (I wish I could remember the name of my prior server because he was top-notch.)

Right brings you into the bar area and left, to the dining area. In the middle is the hostess desk, (who probably took the road less traveled by) so I meandered into the dining room where I was I greeted by a friendly female waitress who helped me find my way to a table and later brought the menus.\n\nI was waiting for the other two members of the party and since it was 11:30 am and I'm inbetween classes, I figured the White Cranberry Margarita sounded reasonable (its five o'clock somewhere!). It was a little bit salty, a little bit sweet, but all so sensual  that I had to remind myself that there was alcohol in it so I could pace myself. The chips and salsa were fantastic (but really, how can anyone mess that up) to nosh on while the other party members arrived. The lunch specials here are pretty amazing and it does get crowded fast. I went for the lunch Mex and Match 1 item with 1 side for $6.99. I got a bean tostada with veggies. The veggies were a pleasant surprise, they were steamed but not doused in butter that most places seem to love to do. I just wish they would have thrown a little bit more on the plate. There were two pieces of broccoli, a few tiny pieces of carrots, and zucchini, but I get it...I'm at a Mexican joint. Everyone else loved their dishes and the service was quick, but attentive.

The extra cost for parking was a bit ridiculous. It should be included in the rate, however it was only $12 to self park. Also we used the hotels free shuttle to get us to an event but the shuttle stopped running at 10:30pm and our event started at 10:30pm so we ended up taking the light rail back which is just a very short walk from the hotel.

Front desk receptionist was great and accommodating to a late check out for us. Overall it was a great hotel and we would stay there again! The reason it gets only 4 stars is because of the extra parking fee and the shuttle not running after 10:30.

You can buy the 6-pack, sure, but for those nights when you're uncertain of what you're craving, you have the option of buying a single beer - mix and match, if you will - and not choking on the cost.

I know, I know, I'm reviewing the local Dell Taco?  Who does that?  However, I've eaten dinner here about six out of the past seven days, so I feel that I'm justified in writing this review.  I pretty much only get the 1/2 pound bean & cheese burrito, the chicken soft taco, and maybe the bean & cheese cup.  Mmm good; make sure to smother everything in hot sauce.  \n\nI once threw in a Macho burrito and ate the whole thing; but that was a mistake because it was about the size of my thigh, ugh.  Seriously, way too much food.  \n\nI've only ever gone through the drive-thru for dinner and late night.  The workers are nice; very diverse -- there's an African-American guy with crazy hair who works the night shift, a nice Hispanic girl who works the evenings, and a nondescript middle-aged white guy who works the weekends.

This is the cheapest, yummiest place any time of day! Whenever my friend and I go traveling this is the place we miss the most. In Europe they dont have Mexican food (well they do kinda but for some reason there is no spice and it is all made of kidney beans and corn... yuck!) and the first thing we do when we get home is head to Del Taco for the comfort of their yummy, cheesy  Half Pound Bean and Cheese Burrito with Green Sauce for $.99 and the Chicken Spicy Jack Quesadilla for like $2.79 or something. When I went to visit friends on the other side of the country recently, they were talking about what they missed from back home and inevitably it was Mexican food... specifically Del Taco. I almost cried when I found out that Del Taco isnt national. I think I am addicted to the stuff because I just cant do without it. The best thing is that they are open like 24 hours a day. They have hot cinnamony Churros for $.99 too! If you are doing something like Weight Watchers too they have a regular Bean & Cheese Burrito that is like 6 point or something I think. I read it somewhere but you can check it out.\n\nEven so If I die from a Del Taco heart attack I will die happy!\n\nHey one more thing DEL TACO EMPLOYEES PLEASE BE CONSISTANT!

My husband and I wanted to get a quick bite to eat for an early dinner. Since Del Taco is walking distance away, we figured we'd give it a go. What a mistake! \n\nFirst off, this location shares a building with a Shell Gas Station so the parking lot was a hot mess. We almost got run over just trying to get to the door. \n\nThe store had a sticky dirty feeling to it inside. We stood at the counter for a full five minutes before anyone acknowledged our existence. Finally, a man wearing a drive through headset took our order. He was very curt with us and rushed through the transaction. When I asked how big the large fountain drink was, he simply rang me up for a large drink instead.\n\nThe food was passable at best. We both opted for one of the epic burritos. More like mediocre burrito! The beans in mine are undercooked, the avocado was turning brown and the chicken was extremely bland. I'm not familiar with this chain, however, so maybe this is just par for the course. I'll give them a pass on the food.\n\nWhile we were trying to enjoy our meal, not one, not two but three different people came and asked my husband and I for money. Now I understand that this is Central Phoenix but this made for an uncomfortable dining atmosphere. \n\nAs we were leaving, I attempted to use their one and only bathroom before making the half mile walk back to the house. No such luck. I thought perhaps I needed a key to use the bathroom so I walked up to the counter. I made eye contact with the girl behind the counter, starting talking to her and she literally turned and walked away from me, and started playing on her phone. My jaw just about hit the floor! It's one thing to be too busy to take orders or help customers. It's another thing entirely to be so rude and unprofessional. I ended up using the bathroom at the Shell and walking home. \n\nIf you want Mexican food with a side of sass and bad service, this Del Taco is the place for you!", "business_id": "KIbFaBrZDX7rrYJInkv5Kg", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-10-03", "type": "review"}

First try, it was closed (hours are 11-3?!) so for the second time I again dragged my reluctant dining partner who hates change to Pane Bianco for what I assured him would be a sandwich he would love.  But I was let down and ultimately embarrassed, because the food just didn't taste good.  Staff was helpful describing the various items on the menu, and we settled on the soprasetta and also a lamb sandwich.  We were very diappointed that the only drinks they offer that don't contain sugar are water and sparkling water.  C'mon.  \n\nBoth sandwiches looked gorgeous, and you could tell Pane Bianco works hard to use very good ingredients.  However, the flavors were off for both sandwiches.  The greens on my market sandwich with lamb, I believe arugula, were a bad contrast with the flavors of the lamb.

Parking was a bit tight and not a lot of spaces in general but was luckily able to snatch one. There are two sides to enter, one for to-go and one for eat in. I walked inside and the d\u00e9cor was so cute, very vintage meets farmhouse feel. They wanted to stick me at a long table with another party of 2 but felt awkward so I went to sit up at the bar, since there weren't any small tables to choose from. Service was very fast, ordered a diet coke but received a coca cola \"light\", which in my opinion does not taste like diet coke. Oh well. \n\nI read their menu (which is VERY limited) and looked on their board for the specials of the day. There were a total of 4 sandwiches, 4 salads and 2-3 \"bar size\" options to choose from and that's all. Only 2 of the options had meat in them so I was a bit disappointed with that and neither option was what I wanted. I ultimately ordered the market sandwich, which was a roasted tomato, arugula and goat cheese on focaccia bread. I think the servers were bored because it wasn't busy and they kept circling around waiting for something to do, very weird. Maybe I noticed it more because I was alone? Anyways, I got my food within 5 minutes and it came with a tiny serving of coleslaw, which was made with apples and red onions. The sandwich was fine but nothing amazing...coleslaw was different but ate it in like 3 bites. I was still hungry after my lunch so decided to order the flourless chocolate cake for dessert...couldn't pass that up! It was really great, came with a vanilla bean cream on top to balance out the richness of the cake. I got the bill and it was $22 so not cheap...the market sandwich with no meat on it was $12! Yikes. \n\nAll in all, I just came to realize that Pane Bianco is just not for me. I know they have great ingredients and does have a certain appeal, very downtown. I did notice the dinner options and was curious if dinner time is a better time to go, since options were things I actually wanted to eat (stuffed peppers, posole, pasta, pizza). So, I wouldn't not recommend it I just don't think I would come back. Glad I tried it though!", "business_id": "-AAig9FG0s8gYE4f8GfowQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-09-17", "type": "review"}

I didn't know what to expect before entering but when I entered the place, it seemed as if I was taken back in time. I was a little confused at what I've heard and the mental thought I already had, and the incorporation that was now in front of me. It was like an old, vintage, antique-ish, theme. (Maybe this shop is like those in Italy?) One side was to-go and other side was dine in with tables. It wasn't a busy lunch day but maybe half the tables were filled with people during this time. It was quiet, no music, and the sounds of your table neighbors.  I like this for the fact that you can actually talk and hear your lunch dates. The tables were already set with fork, knife, napkin, and menu. Presented a nice clean atmosphere.  They had a chalkboard up against the wall that noted the all the daily special, in this case lunch specials including meals and drinks. Our waitress was so kind to read and tell us the daily special. Looking through the menu, it wasn't so detailed with descriptions of what was inside each sandwhich or salad. Since it was a new place for me to try, I was all game for what the surprise would be. They had their sandwhich and salads and veggie soup in the front and drinks in the back. I heard their sandwhiches are pretty scrumptious but I was in the mood for eating like a rabbit, so I opted for a salad. I ended up getting the 2 wash ranch salad I believe is the name? As far as my date, he had the special pulled beef sandwhich and their square pieces of appetizer pizza.\nTo my surprise my salad was loaded. It came with a piece of bread wrapped in brown paper that reminded me that you would wrap fish if you were to get from a market. The salad had lots of dark mixed greens which had already been tossed in their dressing (delicious, but i cant figure out exactly what is in it!) and they had sliced one fresh tomato in half (which still had the vines on it) and a scoop of what looked like their version of chicken salad. Inside their chicken salad was tiny chops of chicken with red onion, celery, quinoa, and possibly minced parsely or basil? It was very delicous, light, refreshing, and made my tummy full and satisfied. Also, food came out quick. I think after ordering, it literally might have came out 7 min later.

G&D could use a bit of a facelift, but it's holding up well. The waitresses and bartenders are pretty hot and look like they could be suicide girls.

I was surprised that they were even open, and it was definitely slow because pretty much every server was standing outside smoking when we arrived.

The booth directly faced the bar and was much more inviting than the somewhat closed-off dining area on the right. To drink, I had a Bloody Mary. I was pleased that our server asked how spicy I wanted it (since that meant it would be made from scratch) and even more pleased when I tasted it and found it to be delicious.

After driving by you for months, I finally decided to stop in. Very nice!\n\nWell, pretty nice. Maybe just nice. The four star rating is very weak, but I decided to bump up from 3 to 4 because we had a good time. I like that this place is low key and not pretentious. I like that on Sundays, they play different football games rather than just focusing on the Cardinals. And I like that they host different things, like live music and trivia nights.\n\nThe food is very bland. However, it's a bar, so expecting the meal of your life is a little silly. It isn't greasy, bad bar food; it's average and a little overpriced. I would stick to a simple appetizer and some drinks in the future.\n\nFish and chips were OK - the corn was definitely frozen, and I think the fish may have been as well. Burger was very simple and bland. I did like the thick cut fries, but they were probably frozen as well. Portions were pretty good, which is a plus.\n\nThe service was OK. A little lackluster - our server seemed a bit frazzled, and she was the only one working the dining room. There were several tables that hadn't been cleared of the dirty dishes after the customers had left, so seating was limited based on that. The restaurant isn't dirty, but it isn't immaculate, either.\n\nI can definitely see why people wouldn't like this place, but for me, it's close to home, and it's a good place to relax without being around a huge crowd. If you stop in, don't expect too much, and you'll (hopefully) be pleasantly surprised like my husband and I were.", "business_id": "3xEB9FyFXolq1b_Qn_BFtg", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-10-06", "type": "review"}

I've wanted to try it for at least a few years now, however long they've been running it, anyway. Due to my schedule, today was the first free Sunday afternoon I have been able to. The roast beef was tender, the gravy was perfect and so were the mashed and fried potatoes. However, the Yorkshire Pudding was not good. It's supposed to be golden brown. Mine was very dark brown and burned black around the edges. Basically inedible although I tried. I ate the less burned bottom half, which tasted overcooked, a flavor that repeated on me for the next few hours. When I mentioned that it was overcooked to the waitress, she was very nice and offered to bring me a new one. Then she came back and told me that the kitchen said it was supposed to be that way and all the others looked like that, too. She offered to get a manager so I could discuss it with them. I declined since I have better things to do with my day off than argue that the kitchen should know how to cook the special properly. I did Google Yorkshire  Pudding and looked at all the images just to prove to myself that I was right about the golden brown they're supposed to be. I left very disappointed that my first taste of something I'd waited so long to try was so subpar. All in all, I give the Sunday roast special about a 50%.

I was not happy with a sylist's work, but that person has since left.  I was not planning on getting my hair done and at the last minute said, \"self, you're only 30 once, splurge and get your hair did!\". So I got in with Hollis, a very nice stylist there. She listened to what I was wanting and produced a fabulous look for my big night. My style was $50, which I felt was a little steep, considering that I really don't have much hair. Regardless, I looked and felt great all night long. \n\nSince February, I've returned to Hollis for my cuts and color. She is very friendly and is easy to talk to. And not just about what I want with my hair. She has many years of experience and I feel like I can really trust her. \n\nThe salon itself is nice enough. Well laid out and friendly staff, without being too trendy and making you feel out of place. They offered me wine while sitting under the dryer once or twice, but not every time I'm there. They also stand by their services and if you are not happy, they will do it again until you are happy, free of charge. I experienced this when I wasn't completely happy with a cut. Hollis trimmed a bit more off the back and I was a happy camper. \n\nThe only complaint I have is that they seem to book their stylists a bit tight and one or two other (typically very young) girls will assist while my stylist is off helping someone else. If I am paying top dollar for my services, I should be getting experienced professionals adding color to my hair. Shampooing is one thing, I understand that, but I prefer one person to perform my actual service. (cut, color) \n\nAll in all, I enjoy my experience and end results each time at Salon Estique.

Good reviews from 3 years ago are not as helpful as good reviews from 3 weeks ago.  Ditto for bad reviews.\n\nIf you sort the reviews for this shop by date, you'll see the 3 most recent reviews below this one are all 1 star, and all for similar reasons: customer service, or lack thereof.  This review is no different.\n\nI am currently in the market for a new mountain bike.  I've done my research, talked to friends who are bike enthusiasts, and I've looked around a few places.  Really, all I needed from Slippery Pig was to get my frame size double checked, and to answer a few questions about some subtle differences between different equipment setups between Cannondale models.  If they had provided those answers, they would have made a sale.\n\nIn the past 4 weeks, I stopped by the shop 3 times.  All 3 times, my entry, browsing, and lingering presence went unnoticed.  I was ignored when the shop was somewhat busy (acceptable), but also when there was only one other customer.\n\nI understand that the guys can get busy, or can be distracted, etc.  But how hard is it to get a simple acknowledgment or something like \"Hey, we'll be with you as soon as we can\"?  I've gotten more acknowledgment of my presence from strangers in a stadium men's room waiting line than I did from the staff at Slippery Pig.  How hard is it to at least give me a head nod, or even look in my direction?  Actually, I take that back.... I watched them all look at me, but then not say anything.  I even got acknowledged by another customer as I fiddled with price tags, but nothing from the sales guy standing between us both.  Unbelievable.\n\nWell, needless to say, I will not be spending my hard-earned money there.  I wish I could opine like other yelpers about their aloof attitudes, or their knowledgeability, or service.  Sadly, I can't because Slippery Pig never had me at hello.\n\nIgnore me once, shame on you.  Ignore me twice, shame on me.  Ignore me three times, get 1 star on yelp.", "business_id": "42Ai9wcFPE2HZ_aADGXI9Q", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-09-13", "type": "review"}

I come here pretty frequently for new tubes. Every couple months, after a valve breaks or a particularly nasty thorn penetrates my tire I know it's time to head down to the pig.\n I love this shop in particular because of several reasons which I will in turn explain below:\n -Location; centrally located along the light rail, it's super convenient for folks like me, who, once their bike has gone out of commission need an alternate means of transport. It's literally across the street from a light rail stop. Also it's right next door to Lux and Panne Bianco, so while your bike is getting some fine tuning you can go grab a delicious panini and chill outside in the fairer weather or lounge inside Lux with the hip kids sipping inky coffee to music from before their time. \n -Customer Service; a lot of bike shops can be like mechanics garages, filled with gear heads that toss around jargon and tools with grease covered hands, intimidating and emasculating you about your lack of knowlege and inadequacy as a cyclist. Not at Slippery Pig, these dudes know their stuff and they're more than willing to share that wisdom. They aren't condescending and they're super helpful. It's also a family/doggy friendly shop.\n -Price; If you're shopping for a new bike this might not be the cheapest spot. However if you're after parts or need some repairs the dudes at the S.P. won't charge you an arm and a leg...or a belly and a loin.\n I'd gladly recommend anybody here and as far as I'm concerned this is the best bike shop in Cen_Pho.", "business_id": "42Ai9wcFPE2HZ_aADGXI9Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-10-17", "type": "review"}

I have not ridden a bike since I was a kid...maybe 8. I went into two bike shops, Slippery Pig and Landis Cyclery. I gave them both the same information on what I was looking for which was I had up to $2,000 to spend but was concerned about buying a nice bike and then just having it sit in my garage...so if I wanted to re sell it I didn't want to take a huge hit. The guy at Landis, to me, simply said whatever he had to say in order to get the sale. He took me to the most expensive bike within that budget and told me if I bought that one I could sell it for MORE than what am paying him for it.... (If I can sell it for more whey can't he?)Then he tried to sell me every gadget he could to max out that $2,000 limit. There were a number of other issues that I could mention that just turned me off to going back to that shop. But anyhow this is a review about Slippery Pig. I went there and spoke with the owner and he basically told me that no matter what I was going to lose about 30% of the value and the only way to minimize your loss would be to buy a cheap bike...something that would be more of an impulse purchase to most people and took me to a bike well below my $2,000 limit. I didn't buy right then but went back a couple days later and talked to a sales rep, who didn't know I spoke to the owner already...told him the same thing and he pretty much said the same thing the owner did.  He then only took me to the things I would actually need to buy in addition to the bike, like locks. I wound up spending almost to my $2,000 limit only because I am hard headed and maybe even a bit of a snob, but I just did not want a cheap bike. \n\n  I really fell like those guys listened to what I was saying and tried to only sell me what I needed. In the end it was me who probably bought a bike that was way more than what I needed and way more than I needed to spend. Had the guy at Landis not come across as such a used car salesman I would have bought the bike he had there in stock. Instead I went to Slippery Pig and purchased a bike they had to order.", "business_id": "42Ai9wcFPE2HZ_aADGXI9Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-09-28", "type": "review"}

Just moved to the area and needed a little bit of work done on my GT force mountain bike. They replace the chain the rear cassette a a derailer cable a rear tire. I had to return the bike twice after the repairs. The first time so they could adjust the derailer correctly and the second because the rear tire which is tubeless did not hold air. So this is 3 times now that I've had to visit the shop. I called ahead to see if the bike was ready which was what I was told when I left it there yesterday. Joelle answered the phone and put me on hold to go see if my bike was ready. After 10 minutes of being on hold I was disconnected. I called back and Joelle acted like he didn't know who I was. I reminded him and he then told me he couldn't find my bike. So of course he put me on hold again. Now mind you I live three minutes away so I was getting in the car and heading to the shop at this point to find the bike myself because I want to ride today. When I get to the shop to they have my bike on the rack finishing the repair and tell me that they didn't put tape in a tire which was what they should have done when they originally replaced it.  The whole time there are three techs having an awesome conversation between the three of them cracking up acting like they don't have a care in the world. All three times I've been in the shop they act like they could care less that I'm there and my guess is it's because they know I won't be slapping my credit card on the counter for $7,000 pivot anytime soon.  These guys remind me of that bartender that lets you sit at the bar for 5 minutes before your presence gets acknowledged, then graciously blesses you by asking you what you would like to drink.

We both get iced tea and it tastes funny, like it was made with bad tap water. When the food arrives, Hubby inhales his quesadilla, but says nothing about its quality. The Oreo pancake is sadly the best thing on the table. I gingerly attempt to scrape off the runny, nasty substance they are passing off as country gravy. The only thing that is prepared close to well in my meal are the poached eggs. The turkey sausage is gross and the bacon is somehow not right- it's not crispy and the taste is off. The biscuits taste like they are from a mix. To top it off, the server places a mostly empty pitcher of water that is no longer ice water on our table. Nice.

I had received an email saying they were ready for pick up, and came 30 minutes later. \n\nThere the guy at the counter told me they didn't have my pictures. He asked if I had the right Walgreens. I showed him my phone, with the email, saying that I was at the right Walgreens. He shrugged.\n\nI asked if he could look up the order number that was in the email and he tried that, but couldn't find it. Then he tried my name. Then my phone number. \n\nApparently my order wasn't anywhere in their system. \n\nAlright, whatever. I'll just reorder them on my phone. I do that, wait a while, and then the guy at the counter finds my 4X6 prints in the 8X10 box. Jesus. I've been waiting for a half hour and you didn't check all the boxes?\n\nHe asks if I want to go pay somewhere else, because his machine can't give receipts. I said its fine as long as I get my change. \n\nHe scans my pictures, a card, and some candy. He didn't want to put them in a bag, because he didn't want to crush the card or the photos. I appreciate that, but I said it was fine. Just put it in the bag. I'll be careful. He doesn't. He just puts the candy in the bag. Whatever. \n\nI pay, don't get a receipt, and he pushes my card and pictures towards me because he wouldn't put them in the bag. I grab them, and ask where my candy is. Oh! Sorry, he apologizes, I forgot about that. You wouldn't have if you had just put everything in the bag like I asked. \n\nThe guy was nice enough, but obviously scatterbrained. He apologized for making me wait and for the confusion. I didn't care. Things happen. I wouldn't be writing this review if that was it. \n\nI get back to my dorm, and the pictures are wrong. Not even like they were shittily cropped or something (because that has also happened to me at other Walgreens before), but they were not my pictures at all. Like, I had never seen the people in the pictures before in my life. \n\nNow I have to pay to take the light rail back to that Walgreens to return someone else's pictures so that I can get MY pictures. \n\nAlso, this location is in the process of remodeling and it is very disorganized and smells weird.\n\nAlso also, this has happened to me before at the same location BEFORE the remodeling.

I just recently came from the Portland VA system, which is IMO is one of the best ran VA systems.  My First visit was to the Phoenix VA Women's Clinic in FEB 2012, after getting home from the Philippine's  I had no mail for my VA visit results so I called to receive them via mail to provide to my unit.  In SEPT I received my Test results I had done in FEB/ the letter was dated JUNE!? 3-4 months to mail a letter? Ok, I have to give this VA System the benefit of the doubt because there's no way this is how this Hospital operates so let's see how my first Doctors visit goes.  After me and my husband waited for 8 Months to get our initial appt. just to assign us a primary care physician. We were asked to show up 30min before my 2:00PM appt. I did! 1:30 show up/ check in was great thanks to Daniel who was very personable/ 2:15 Vitals were taken, 2:30 Back in waiting room/ 3:00 still in waiting room/3:30 I go to front desk to ask what is going on with my 2:00PM Appt. I was here at 1:30PM for? They checked with the DOC (DR. TONG) Diamond Clinic/ She is running behind \"because she likes to spend time with her patients\".  4:15pm! Still in waiting room :/ Apparently she likes to spend time with her patients at the expense of her other patients who have been waiting for nearly 3hrs!! I and my Husband look around to find ourselves to be the only people in the waiting room now and the Hospital quietly closing up.  My frustration starts to boil and tears start to come to my eyes with anger... This is the VA system we are enrolling in??? The Clinic door opens; Dr. Tong addresses us as if we shouldn't be upset at the unreasonable wait... seriously!  I had scheduled a 2:00PM appt specifically to make to the LAB for workups I knew I would be requesting, but because of her inability to perform her tasks with time management in consideration I had to request the test and run the stairs in platforms to get to lab by 4:30, My Superpowers kicked in and I MADE IT 4:25PM! Thank goodness! I dreaded the thought of the drive from Buckeye to this VA again just for Lab workups or to wait in emergency for a blood draw because Dr. Tong was considerate of other patients at my and my husband's expense.  After everything was said and done I had requested for my test results from DR. Tong/ a week later I get a letter saying everything is \"essentially normal\".  Wow! Where are my test results and what does \"essentially\" mean? Come on! Apparently, there's no regard or STANDARD to informing the patient of their test results and no standard for when the patient will be notified of their test results and among other deficiencies in this VA System.  Please somebody take control of this system, all I hear from other service members is \"apparently you haven't been assigned here long.\" The Coordinator for Phoenix VA should be ashamed.", "business_id": "-TIyxSc-lLmJzunje6MD9Q", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-10-23", "type": "review"}

I went to the ER AFTER going to my assigned Emerald Clinic, and the effiency of the ER really highlighted how poorly the Emerald Clinic handled themselves, once again. This review honestly doesn't include the VA's ER department. I'm not sure if the intense nature of emergency medicine puts all the most skilled doctors, nurses, and staff in that department, whatever it is, they are miles ahead of the Emerald Clinic from when you first see the person at the front desk, to when you leave.\n\nAfter taking a job offer in another country, I was informed five days before leaving that I need a health examination done. I went into my assigned Emerald Clinic hoping that they could help me out. Now, I knew my situation was far from critical, but I was more than willing to wait as long as it took to get this health examination. I explained my situation to the lady at the front desk, and she told me, \"I'll do what I can.\" After about thirty minutes I asked her my status, and she gave me a \"thumbs up\" so I was pleased that I'd be seen. After waiting another hour, I was called in back and told, \"sorry, we aren't going to help you today. You need blood work for a physical, and it's too late to start doing that.\" It was approximately 1:30pm. I mentioned the time, and said, \"we literally have hours left in the day, I can go do what you need me to do right now.\" She just sort of shrugged at me. I asked if we can skip the bloodwork, and just do a quick check up (I didn't need bloodwork for the job). \"Nahh. We can't do a physical without bloodwork. And nobody else will,\" (lie number 1). Her dismissal attitude, and apathy was shocking to me. What came next though really upset me. Another thing I was told was that, \"your health care provider is pregnant, and not staying til we close, she's leaving early, so even if you get the bloodwork, we still aren't going to help you.\" Unprofessional. \n\nI asked her if she had any suggestions for me. She told me, very confidently, \"oh yeah, go to the hospital on 7th Ave, past Roosevelt, and they do physicals for vets for $20. They'll have you in and out quick too,\" (lie number 2). After wasting my time and gas money driving to the hospital on 7th Ave, they looked at me like I was crazy, and said they do not, nor have they ever, done walk in physicals for only $20. The bottom line is that it was 1:30pm on a Friday when I was in the Emerald Clinic and they didn't want to take a walk-in patient after 12:00pm. So after refusing to help me, I assume the lady I saw lied to me to me to get me out of there quickly.\n\nThe person I saw at Patient Advocacy literally shrugged it off and said, \"It's Friday. They want to go home.\" Like that is completely acceptable behavoir. Luckily, I got a little empathy at the ER, explained my situation to nurse Sharon (who was awesome), and like I said, I was in and out in less than 2 hours, WITH a health examination. I don't think Emerald Clinic's laziness is fair to the ER, who in my case, blatantly had to pick up the Emerald Clinic's slack. Making me wait almost a hour and half just to tell me they wouldn't help me was another upsetting fact. That's not how you treat people, and it's certainly not how you should treat vets in a veteran's hospital.

The Walnut Square - Available in both a truffle and a candy bar, this dark chocolate coated chunk of heaven (butter caramel and English walnuts) haunts my reverie 2-3 times a week. The only problem with the bar is that you have to bite into it, meaning there are opportune moments to drool while eating. Embarrassing? Yes. Worth it? Yes.\n2. Key Lime Truffle - A totally unique, decadent delight, this creamy cube of white chocolate houses a key lime cream flavored center. It's tangy, sweet, and addictive.\n3. Kona Mocha - The perfect blend of texture and flavor, toasted coconut and white chocolate surround a coffee and milk chocolate truffle. If there was a coffee that tasted like this, my mornings would rock.\n4. Almond Truffle - Somewhat reminiscent of an inside-out sushi roll, the roasted almonds coat the outside, followed by white chocolate, and finally smooth milk chocolate in the center. They don't really look like truffles, which makes it easy to eat, oh, say, 10 of them at a time.\n5. Chelsea - The ultimate classy truffle, pecans and chocolate liquor surrounded by milk chocolate create a mini-explosion of awesome on your taste buds. \n6. Scotchmallow - Available in a bar and a truffle, a layer of marshmallow and flavorful caramel are enveloped in dark chocolate. If I could put this between graham crackers I'd be a) in s'mores heaven, and b) a total glutton.\n7. Dark Almonds - Technically this is just a dark almond cluster, but I'll be damned if it's not the best almond cluster I've ever had. \n8. Dark Chocolate Truffle - A pure, smooth chocolate with a bit of texture, this semisweet chocolate truffle and chocolate liquor center is topped with nut crunch. It's simple, but perfect.\n9/10. Mocha/Bordeaux - Both of these truffles are covered in chocolate sprinkles, which I usually hate, but for some reason, they taste amazing. The Bordeaux is a pure chocolate flavor with a hint of brown sugar, and the Mocha is chocolate-coffee (obviously) available in both milk and dark flavors.\n\nTraveling back through my childhood by writing about these exceptional chocolates has made me realize something: these are some of the best truffles I've ever had, local or not. The price is fair (maybe too fair), the quality is evident, and the selection is grand. In fact, I'd pick these over $4.00 French truffles at a shmancy-pants chocolatier any day.", "business_id": "ezM-93i6eNb4LnYp3J101Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-11-14", "type": "review"}

While the car would still start, I decided to get the battery replaced rather than call AAA. I'm not saying anything bad about AAA because when you're stranded it's tip-top. But when your car will still start and you're confident the battery is going, I recommend driving straight to Auto Zone. It's much less expensive than AAA and you'll wait less. When I got to Auto Zone I was the fourth person that day (and it was only 10 AM) to need battery replacement. I have a 2003 VW Passat which means you've got to peel off a cowl (I learned this is the proper term by reading the directions), remove a plastic piece that covers the battery and then figure out how to wedge the big European-sized battery out. The store manager, Chris, was very helpful. He did not act at all impatient that it took longer to change out my battery, even though customers were beginning to stack up by the time we finished.

Unfortunately tonight's visit was far from superb as we are used to. We walked in and requested a BOOTH for 5, we told there was another group ahead of us and it would be 10- 15 minutes. When our table was finally ready for us 15 minutes later, it was not a booth. I told her specifically ,\"I requested a booth not a table with chairs.\" She responded with, \" I was not aware of that request.\" So I told her, \"I refuse this table since I requested a booth.\" She again responds, \" you didnt say anything of that sort when you walked in.\" At this point my fiance chimes in with, \"Actually, he said a booth for 5 please?\" The hostess then tells us,\"This table is all we have for you at this time and to wait for a booth will be another 30 minutes.\" I told her, \"Fine then we will will wait.\" She got an attitude and began gathering all the napkins and flat ware that she just laid out at the table along with the menus. At this point I was furious, more so because I was getting the attitude from someone who obviously had no concern for my request and then got upset when I corrected her. I was so mad that I was ready to leave and go elsewhere and when I expressed that to her. She retorted \"Fine, go somewhere else and eat I don't care!\" After hearing her say that I asked to speak to the manager, she completely ignored me and walked away. Another employee gladly got the attention of the manager for me and when I expressed my disbelief and how I felt so disrespected to him. All I was told is, \"I will talk to her about this this.\"  I'm sorry but when people come into your establishment and no matter what the situation is, automatically spend $60 or more on food and drinks you should do everything in your power to make them feel at ease. We finally got our booth in a matter of minutes after talking to the manager. To put the icing on the cake, I noticed after that anyone requesting a booth after we were seated got one right away. This had me heated, then my fiance told me,\" You made a  complaint, so now she is gonna do everything to make sure she doesn't get another one tonight.\" \n\nTo say the least I hope the young lady has a much better night.

They also doused the entire thing with about a quart of Russian Dressing (#5), put some fancy tomatoes on the sandwich and I requested a change of cheese from baby swiss to Smoked cheddar. You can only get about 8 different cheeses here on your sandwich (the rest you must buy) and they only carry one style of Boars Head turkey.

My food is was out in less than 5  minutes after ordering. \n\nI ordered the Orange Chicken. It's always good to try the popular dish at the new place to see how they prepare it.\n\nCons: It did not look very appeasing to the eye. It sorta looked just slopped together. Presentation is key with me.\n\nWAAAAAYYYY too saucey! The chicken and rice were drowned in the sauce.

You get more chicken than a ton of breading. The orange sauce is amazing, especially with some spice.\n\nThe salt and pepper calamari.. may not seem all that exciting or exotic, but it is delicious! I love the favors the green onions and jalape\u00f1o with the salt and pepper. \n\nOur newest favorite dish is the Szechwan shrimp. It is different from what I had growing up. I don't like szechwan anything, so I would have never given this dish a second glance. Of course one day, my friend ordered it and I just about died!

I was looking to DIY my bouquet for my very small wedding, and they happened to be a good combination of easy to locate and well priced. It's in the building that used to hold My Florist- they tore it down and turned it into a bunch of small little stores.\n\nYou go into the store and are greeted by the adorable store kitty. Super friendly and cute! Sorry, but I've got two of my own, they get at least a 0.5 star for that. \n\nMostly I liked how helpful the girl was. I looked a bit lost, and she asked me what I needed, and I asked to look at the fresh flowers, because I wanted white ones for my bouquet. They didn't have many of the ones I really liked or had initially wanted but she did go out of her way to mention that because it was a Saturday, there were some blooms that weren't up to par when I asked about them. Not letting me buy bad flowers- very nice. \n\nWhen I had questions about the hydrangea stems that caught my eye, and voiced that I wasn't sure if I could make my now-husband's boutonniere out of it, she actually showed me, right on the spot. I also loved that. She told me how to care for them until the day of, and we arranged for her to put aside some stems for me on the spot. When I asked if I might need more, she volunteered to call her supplier. They said they could deliver some the next day, but she was very upfront about the price.\n\nI did catch her making a really cool looking arrangement as well. I rather wish I had had the foresight to come in earlier and order what I needed, but flowers were supposedly easy and the last thing on my mind. My problem, not theirs.

Sweet Tomatoes always delivers on lots of fresh ingredients to pile atop my lettuce mountain, and a myriad of salad dressing from which to choose. In regards to the main event, everything I selected was tasty except the cauliflower--yuck. I don't think it was rotten, but it definitely tasted like it hadn't been rinsed. I also found it strange that there were no bacon bits or pieces. Bacon's not a requirement for my salads, but I still thought it was odd.\n\nThe whole buffet was like going from one let down to a great find. The pasta selection was terrible, as was the quinoa, the pizza was unpalatable, but the cornbread, sweet potatoes, and strawberry lemonade were divine. And, the blue cheese dressing was out of this world.\n\nIf I return, I may go later in the day, because it was moron central.

A majority of the shops are owned by Jewish Uzbek's.  \nWhat do Uzbekistan and traditional barber shops have in common?  I have no idea.  But its strange, don't you think? \n\nWhen I first began to notice the trend, I would go to a new barber to see if  they too were from Uzbekistan.  I'd hear that accent and ask, \"You from Uzbekistan?\"  \"Yes\", would almost always be the reply.  Oddly, they wouldn't question how I knew this.  \n\nIf the Soviet Union were still around I'd be really worried.  I even found an Uzbek during a RARE visit to Supercuts!   Her husband who is also an Uzbek' works at the New York barber on Indian School @ 24th St!  I can name six other Uzbek barber shops in town!\n\nIt must be a cultural thing I'm assuming, but I've noticed most of the Uzbek barbers are not really friendly.  They don't seem to smile or be chatty.  Probably a by-product of the communist economy?  \n\nThat's not usually the case at Central Barber though.  They've learned those social niceties that most Americans take for granted and expect.    Always warm and welcoming and just the right amount of chit-chat.  \n\nOne of the best things about this shop is the built-in vacuum that's attached to the electric clippers.  This greatly reduces the amount of hair left behind.  They also clean you up with a warm towel and give this great neck massage at the end of your cut.  Although the warm towel thing really sucks in the middle of the summer.  \n\nNot sure about all of the barbers, but the owner Roman and Abraham give the best cuts.  No appointments, but the wait is usually no more than 20 minutes max.", "business_id": "AVlnz8OVKacySY9hWNWFUw", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-11-11", "type": "review"}

After coming here, I don't think I'll be doing that anymore.\n\nFor an exceedingly reasonable price, the owner spent over a half  hour on my not particularly difficult hair. The ambiance in a barber shop is particularly important, and although I came when it was not crowded, I still felt comfortable--enough so that when he had finished cutting my hair, I decided that I'd get my goatee trimmed at the same time. Let me tell you--he put my home grooming efforts to shame.\n\nThere's nothing like a hot towel massage, a straight razor, and high-quality lather to put you in a good mood for the day. I was debating going to the a nationwide haircutting chain a few blocks away, but I'm glad I came here. Seriously, it's only $4 more to come here for a standard haircut, and worth every penny.\n\nBTW-- Yes, he's definitely from NYC, and he's probably Jewish.

I have been to this DQ several times with minimal complaint. It is small and seating is limited but that never really bothered me. Today I brought my daughter and we purchased ice cream and food and the cashier told me the bill total was $8.00 even. I gave him my credit card and he ran it. At first I didn't think he was going to give me a receipt. I guess they just have a slow credit card machine.  He finally handed me the credit card receipt, not the actual receipt the cash register produces and I noticed that the card had been swiped for $10.00. At first I thought maybe there was a fee for using a credit/debit card and next I thought, wow, that's ridiculous. When he delivered the food, I asked him why the bill was $8 and the receipt showed my card had been charged $10 and he said, \"oh\" and walked back the register and instantly popped the drawer open, took out $2 and ripped the receipt off and walked over to me. He showed me the total and said, \"you were right\" and handed me the $2. Umm....ok. So basically, my advice is to watch your receipts very closely, ask for both copies, the credit card and the register one, and maybe even pay with cash cuz last time I checked the 8 and the 10 weren't \"next to each other\" on a keyboard and I am not sure there's a plausible excuse for this accidentally happening. I am thinking that that employee thinks he's running some kind of scam where he skims a couple bucks off every credit card transaction and pockets the extra money at the end of the day and that's some bullsh*t. I will be contacting the store directly tomorrow to voice my concerns with their manager although maybe he or she's in on it too. Might be best to avoid this location unless you're actually wanting give your money away to dishonest people.", "business_id": "zZmhEpiVpRfFQid87-pcOQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-10-30", "type": "review"}

But, do I know a well-stocked retail store when I see one? Absolutely. \n\nI walked into All About Books & Comics while on the hunt for a vintage comic book that stood out from the rest. As a girl who played with barbies and my little ponies rather than superman and batman, I didn't know where to even begin, but the yelp reviews promised me a store full of vintage and new comic books and stocked full. Upon walking in, I realized immediately that the store lived up to its yelp expectations. \n\nI consulted the man behind the counter because I didn't even know where to begin. I told him that I was looking for a vintage comic book for under $20 but something that a collector would appreciate. He immediately took out a binder full of a backlog of every single comic book in the store and a history behind each book. I'm talking about a villain's first appearance to the first time a superhero found a new trait. It was like another language to me but I knew this guy knew what he was talking about. Comics like the walls, the shelves, the counters, the cabinets. They are everywhere. If you are a fan of the comics, this could be your kryptonite... to quote an all star super hero of course. \n\nSo after twenty minutes of searching for the perfect comic book, I finally found the one. According to the comic book connoisseur himself, this 1959 spider man comic was the first time Mary Jane appeared on a cover. It's no first edition Batman but for the price, a collector will appreciate it. So, with that I took my brand new (old) comic book and was on my way. \n\nSo all you comic book lovers...I am pretty certain this is the place you want to be to spend the days reading about heroes and villains.

Now years later I am in violation for my flag.  Nowhere did it say you  couldn't have potted plants outside in the rocky area,nowhere did it say you could not put up windchimes, signs, metal artwork, etc. I raise some of my own herbs and vegetables for my consumption as you can't buy any fresh ones that taste the same.

So, Aps, myself, and property manager Jenny meet and she comes up with idea to remove shrubs on side of garage and to move them there. She send her crew who did this.

He is still not satisfied. \nI still have a gift my my grandkid of a southwestern Indian village hanging on a wall that cannot be seen except if you are standing directly at my front door which I am afraid he will still insist that I remove.\nI think this company should stand behind what was told to me about the flag years ago and also fee there should not be the discrimination that is now happening. they should also stand up for the decision on the tomato plants made by their representative Jenny Owen.\nSince the time I received the violation letter which was so vague they have now written rules and regulations.  they must have come to my unit to write them as everything I had in front was now in these R&Rs.\nI will never again buy a property with management by Osselaer. this has left such a  bad taste in my mouth that I  will probably avoid a sudivision under any HOA", "business_id": "Uj_doROgb3Nnhl7MLslS-w", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-11-20", "type": "review"}

Another example of the clinic not really caring about dissatisfied clients - and focusing more on a facade of responding rather than making some much needed fundamental changes.\n-----------------------------\n\nIt is always difficult to write a negative review - especially more difficult when it concerns professionals in the pet-care business.\n\nWe took our 10-week old purebred ridgeback to this location for his slew of shots, etc. At the reception desk, we were immediately told that the clinic had diagnosed a parvovirus case (acute, highly contagious, potentially lethal disease - esp. for unvaccinated pups) earlier that day. It was just by pure chance that I had carried in the pup vs. walking him on the leash. After the visit, we were advised to walk out with the pup in our arms as the area was not entirely disinfected. Luckily, our little guy did not contract anything except his vaccination shot.\n\nWhile at the clinic, there was tremendous amount of pressure to sign up for one of their \"pet care plans\". The plans either required a bulk payment or a monthly installment which would cover everything from the 1st shot all the way up to neuter/spay. \n\nAt the very first visit, we weren't comfortable signing up for anything without establishing a comfort-level with the vet/clinic. We simply wanted his first set of shots and seek care as and when his shots became due. After multiple discussions with two techs and two doctors, and 25 minutes of back and forth, we were repeatedly told that the plans represent significant savings. \n\nMore importantly, many of our questions weren't answered completely or professionally. Neither the staff nor the doctors seemed to genuinely care about the animals. Money seemed to be the primary focus.\n\nNeedless to say, we did not sign up for any of the plans and never returned.

The staff, though, makes the brewhouse.\n\nSince it's a brewhouse, let's start with the beer. Sonora has a brew for nearly everybody. If you like it dark and heavy, there's usually a mix of stout, porter or barley wine. For the lighter folks, there's a very competent mix of hefeweizens and pale ales. For big beer flavors, there's usually an IPA. The best stuff, though, comes out of the cask. Cask-conditioned ales have an awesome flavor that allows the character of the hops to shine out. My main quibble with Sonora's cask selections is that they're too often of the pale variety. I'd love to see a stout or porter in the cask at least once a month. I would celebrate to see a Belgian trippel wind up on the menu, too.\n\nSonora also serves food. The cottage pie is tasty, as are the fish 'n' chips and homemade soups, and the nachos are a nice snack. The burgers, both the pub and Kobe varieties, depend greatly on how the person at the grill defines rare, medium and done well. Unfortunately, their definitions are often differerent from mine.\n\nThis brewpub also has a great atmosphere. Sit at the bar and chat with the other brew lovers. It's a friendly place, and you'll have fun conversations. They staff actually know their beers and have strong opinions. And they're just as friendly as the drinkers.

That's why this classy little beauty less than a mile away from our house was a definite must-try. Let me begin the review by letting you know, up front, that we really enjoyed everything about the place. Minimal complaints! \n\nWe visited Sonora on a Friday at around 7:00...there were a few parking spots left in what is really a very ample parking lot for downtown Phoenix. I mean, damn! There must be at least 20 spaces. I'm a worrier and I stress out about things like, \"WHERE WILL WE PARK?!\" before I go anywhere. I know...I know. So, I was pleased to see that I needn't have gifted myself with an ulcer over where we could park without getting towed or ending up on blocks. \n\nSonora Brewhouse is comprised of two buildings, joined by an outside dining area between them. The building you first walk into, (the older building, I perhaps incorrectly surmised), is small and was filled with many jovial patrons on our visit. We wouldn't have wanted to sit at the bar, but we couldn't have, anyway! It was completely full, as were almost all of the booths and tables. We made our way to the outside seating area, and were about to sit down when we noticed the second building...right on the other side of the outdoor seating. We ventured in, and it was much less full than the other building, but several times as noisy. Oh, well. We sat down and surveyed our new environs. \n\nI've read several reviews on here vaguely bashing the ambiance of the restaurant - I found nothing to complain about. Then again, I like faux exposed-brick walls and dark wood paneling. \"Duly noted.\" Alright, cool. Thanks. I also liked the kind of fun, amateurish canvas paintings of the images they pair with each of their beers that are strewn about said exposed-brick walls. Plasma TVs abound, which I hate, but I know people eat that technology crap up so I guess it's worth mentioning. \n\nOur waitress was just friendly enough, avoided all bitchiness, and was on top of things without being obnoxious. In other words, perfect. My boyfriend ordered the pale ale, (I think it's called The Stinger? Something like that?), and I, not a beer drinker in the slightest, decided to throw caution and personal preference to the wind and have a Vanilla Porter. Because, you know. It would taste like vanilla. And...vanilla is for girls. Like me. That don't drink beer. My boyfriend chuckled at this logic, and told me I wouldn't like it and that I didn't know what I was ordering. \n\n... \n\nYep. Just about right. As far as beer goes, I did like the kind of bitter and still beer-like hint of baked goods flavor, but it was not anything like I cluelessly imagined. I still drank it! My boyfriend really enjoyed his pale ale with no criticisms. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered the Tavern Steak with steamed vegetables and steak fries, and I ordered the Santa Fe Chicken Sandwich with the kettle chips/chipotle ketchup. We were both very pleased with our entrees...the jalapeno butter (?) on the steak is pretty tasty. As for the sandwich, I'll eat anything if it is slathered in guacamole. The steak fries were as good as steak fries ever are, and the kettle chips are as good as all of the other reviews have told you. I don't eat potato chips and I hate ketchup, but I loved the combination here. Fun tip: I tried putting some of the chipotle ketchup on my sandwich, and it tasted really gross. Maybe limit your use of the ketchup to its intended, menu-endorsed purpose. \n\nWhen we were done, we had no problem getting the bill, paying the bill, and getting out. The parking lot was completely full when we left, and there were two cars jockeying for our spot. That was probably around 8:00 - 8:30 PM, so if you're a damaged individual like me who finds cause to stress about parking, go earlier than that. \n\nThere were a lot of other options on the menu that sounded like they might be on the \"delicious\" side. If you are like us, and not into the drama-filled 20-something bar scene downtown, this might be a nice alternative. It's so close, and we were both really down with the experience...we will definitely be back.", "business_id": "3UMcsN9IjoeV8JZvC4apag", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-09-21", "type": "review"}

And then confusion...both of us looked at each other and said \"WTF???\"  Worst RB EVER!\n\nWhat the heck was in this drink that made it taste like ass?  We looked all over the menu and found nothing.  Then we saw the \"fine print\" on a small table sign...STEVIA.  It's made with Stevia NOT sugar...I'm sorry, but I have to say that this is the lame-est root beer on the planet.  If I'm going to treat myself to a big glass of homemade root beer, I want it to be delectable...sugar and all...no freaking high fructose corn syrup and no bloody artificial sugars (and yes, I know stevia is \"natural\" but who gives a crap...it tastes terrible anyway).\n\nAfter the root beer debacle, it didn't get better.

We'd all been wanting to try out the place and sample their brews for a while. We arrived, and were told to pick any seat we desired, so we grabbed a booth. The first thing I noticed was the interior, it was fairly small but in a good way, the ambience of the place has a classic southwestern feel to it; and not in the kitschy way that non natives might assume a \"sw\" theme should feel. Perusing the menu I noticed that the prices seemed a little higher than i'm used to for pub grub, but i'm sure the quality would be deserving. after a while of checking out their digs and studying over the menu and drink/food specials they had for weekends we opted to go for the \"order any regular appetizer and get you're first beer for $1\" deal. seems like a good deal right? Scott ordered the light rail cream ale, Justin ordered the IPA? i think and I got their Vanilla stout. They were all delicious. My stout was especially good as the vanilla taste was merely a mild hint which gave it a great background flavor and left a lingering sweetness that was refreshing rather than sickeningly fruity/sweet. It was a classic stout whose femme-y name belies it's body and drinkability; certainly not a lady drink imo. My compatriots order the light rail cream ale wings and i order the \"beer bread\" w/ queso dip. The appetizers were, decent. not bad but not great. The real reason to come here is the beer; despite the fact i didnt try any entrees, or their delicious sounding kobe beef burger- i'm gonna go ahead and stand by my sentiment. When our lackluster waitress finally returned i asked for MY bill, she returned after 15 min. or so with all of our checks on one tab, and she had overcharged us after we'd asked her if the weekend special (order any app and get 1st beer for $1) was still in effect, to which she'd said yes. To be fair i'm sure it was an honest mistake, and she was probably really busy....yada yada yada we asked her for our seperate checks and about the special one more time, she apologized and returned with our checks and cheaper tabs. So all in all i like SunUp brewery but i'd return solely for the brews and leaves the eats to some place more qualified for my refined tastebuds.", "business_id": "3UMcsN9IjoeV8JZvC4apag", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-10-11", "type": "review"}

I used to love this place.  I loved it because it was not only a great brew house but it also offered deliciously consistent food that was served by a friendly staff.

You are not a moderately price wine bar, nor are you an Irish pub!  You are a micro brew with delicious beer that once boasted fantastic food.  You were a place to go for the best Kobe burger or English Style fish and chips in all of Down Town Phoenix.\n\nNow you are becoming a has-been, a place that if it weren't for the good brew, you would be just another forgettable restaurant.

I have had the burger with the blue cheese fondue on it several times now, and it is amazing. The bun is chewy, burger is juicy, and the blue cheese is very blue-cheesy. It was cooked to perfection and served with some crispy fries that were also very good. I have yet to be disappointed. \n\nMy friend had the club, and it is a giant sandwich and looked delicious. His only compliant was there isn't any \"regular\" white bread available to put it on. Another friend had the green chile pulled pork and said he really enjoyed it.\n\nThe beer on the other hand - I really have struggled to like. As an avid drinker of the \"other\" brewery in Tempe's flagship beer, I am always looking for a red-type ale, which they have, but I find too hoppy. So I recently have had the Pale Ale, which has a good flavor, but once again I run into a hop issue. I just really am not a fan of hoppy beers, and as of my last sampler tasting, these are too much for me.\n\nAnother bonus of SunUp is the small, partially-covered patio.

I didn't have a car, so the parking lot didn't bother me, but the area on one side of the hotel was sketchy and had a fair amount of undesirable foot traffic.

The hotel has a shuttle van that will, if you reserve it or can snag a ridealong, take you anywhere within five miles of the hotel for free, and then pick you up again. Naturally you should tip the driver (also a great guy), but it still beats taking a cab. The driver gets bonus points for letting us jump out and grab a coffee on the way to our destination!

Ms. Wolf certainly did not remain un-bias.  I spent more than $10k with my attorney, fighting for full parenting time with my children.  My case went on for more than 9 months so I was looking forward to mediation to hopefully come to a reasonable agreement with my ex-husband.

She will take notice to that and use it to her advantage.  Ms. Wolf does not have your best interest at heart and only wants the disputing parties to come to an agreement, so she has \"1 more under her belt\".  One week after mediation, my ex-husband began to verbally abuse me and my children.  Not to mention the fact that he refuses to follow the parenting agreement.  All of this was told to Ms. Wolf, along with multiple other issues, and she dismissed them completely.  Ms. Wolf actually told me, \"Get a grip lady, we see horrific cases of abuse come across our desks every singe day.  You need to come to an agreement and get over it.\"  My heart goes out to those families, but for her to compare my case to other cases of abuse, was completely unprofessional and unethical.

For a moment I felt how Robert Smith must feel whenever he walks into a Hot Topic, or Hulk Hogan in a bandana wholesaler's. \n\nBut alas, like Torrid and Guitar Center, I inevitably showed up the same day as the token asshole employee whose brief interaction with me would ruin my view of this establishment for all time.\n\nWhile waiting for the show to commence, Fenyx and I went through the back door to take a smoke break, as were a lot of other people. The back door couldn't be shut all the way or it would lock, forcing you to either bang on it until someone heard you over the music or walk around to the other side. \n\nSo he and I are just standing around, smoking, talking, making sure nobody shuts the door, and out comes the DJ. He steps out, and before even lighting his cigarette, slams the door behind him.\n\n\"Awwww, man, now you've locked us out,\" we say, playfully.\n\nThe DJ stands over Fenyx, eyeballing him as he responds with \"Yeah, that's the point. To keep the undesirables out\" before walking off with his cigarette.\n\n\"What the hell just happened?\" I ask.\n\"He thinks we're a straight couple.\" \nI laughed. I searched for a pen. I'd been mistaken for a lot of things in the past, but this was the first time I'd been mistaken as straight. This had to be documented. Fenyx, who is also not straight, was not as amused.\n\nI tried to brush the comment aside and we went back inside, where the DJ proceeded to stare down my amigo and I from across the bar. \n\nI knew at any moment, a confrontation would escalate, and I was forced to choose between leaving early, missing the drag show, or watch the tension rise to eruption. One of these scenarios carried with it the slight risk of me breaking a newly manicured nail, so naturally, I opted we go back to the Bunkhouse and play darts.\n\nI'm sure giving them 1 star for this one incident is petty, but, uh, so is what they did, so it works out, I guess.\n\nOh well.

I LOVE stationery and paper goods and am nostalgic for my favorite stores of that kind from my time living on the east coast. It was 3:55pm on a Saturday, and apparently they close at 4 (I didn't know). \n\nWhen my husband and I walked in, two store people were at the register helping another customer. Instead of greeting me, they looked at my with shock to see me and asked emphatically, \"Can I help you?\" As though I were in the wrong place. \n\nAt first I thought I must be confused, that I'd walked into an appointment-only card shop. Realizing they were closing a few minutes later, I explained I had driven to come see the store and that I hadn't realized they were closing soon, and I made a motion for the door. Realizing their own rudeness and perhaps that another customer was watching this, they begrudgingly mumbled something about how I could stay but it was clearly half-hearted. \"Come back another time!\" they said. \n\nI absolutely will not be coming back another time because that behavior was nuts! I worked many boutique retail jobs throughout college and would never have treated a customer that way. In fact, as a rule of thumb, most small shops don't mention closing time to customers until after they've closed, and then only to explain why you're locking the door or pulling down displays (gentle coaxing that you are winding down). \n\nThey definitely lost a customer today--and for all future visits. \n\nI also never write Yelp reviews--I just was so bowled over by the terrible customer service that I felt compelled in hopes that other people won't waste a trip.", "business_id": "stVENgLTS3MiMhyeJ7XQZg", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-10-26", "type": "review"}

I have been in Phoenix for over a month now and have not eaten any GOOD Mexican food!  I was craving some tacos so I decided to try this spot out.  I was glad I drove down!\n\nI walked in and was told to sit wherever I wanted.  I grabbed a table and a nice lady came over to take my drink order and deliver some chips and salsa.  I placed my order for 2 beef tacos and a cheese quesadilla with green chiles in it.  I had a large Diet Coke to drink.  Here is how the food was...............\n\nChips and Salsa-  They bring you out a large basket of chips and a little thing of salsa.  I took a bite of a chip and had a flashback.  They reminded me of something.....I took another bite and then it hit me.  These chips tasted exactly like the chips at El Tarasco in Manhattan Beach.  That is definitely a good thing.  El Tarasco serves up whole fried tortillas.  Juans cuts them into chips but the taste was identical.  I was impressed!  The salsa was tasty too.  It was pretty mild and refreshing.  The chips were so good that I ate 2 baskets full!\n\nBeef Tacos-  I got 2 of these bad boys.  They are a bit small but they were awesome.  These also reminded me of somewhere from back home.......Titos Tacos!  Similar taste, texture and size.  Titos uses more cheese,  but other than that, they were pretty similar (Titos are a bit better but hey...Titos makes the best hard shell beef taco ever...no shame in never being as good as Titos).  The shredded beef was seasoned well, the shells were perfectly crispy. I would have liked a bit more cheese, but it was still enough the way they came out.  It was a fantastic beef taco!\n\nQuesadilla with Chiles-  When I bit into this, it ALSO reminded me of somewhere from CA....... Sombreros!  I would always get a beef taco and quesadilla combo at Sombreros.  This quesadilla was an exact replica!  It had nicely melted cheese, tons of green chiles and it was folded up into a nice flour tortilla.  I dipped this in the salsa and it was a winner!\n\nDiet Coke-  Nice to see they serve Coke products.\n\nTotal for my meal was $11.12.  Not too shabby for a grip of food.  I ate 3 different things and each one reminded me of some of my favorite Mexican food places from back in CA.  You simply cannot beat that!  Service was very friendly and it felt like you were eating in someones house kind of.  I can't wait to go back to try out some of their other offerings.  I can see this place becoming our families go to Mexican joint.  It's a bit of a drive from where I live (its way closer to work), but I was very impressed and will be back soon.

The pizza is passable but not a million miles from a toasted lavash cracker, the beer is all right, and the pizza cookie is pretty good (it's basically a cookie half-baked in a deep-dish pizza pan). \n\nThe problem with Oregano's is that it's something of a victim of its own success. They don't accept reservations no matter what the occasion, and there's almost always a wait. I've yet to figure out why, because it's really not all that. Unfortunately, I have friends who like it, and my polite requests to go elsewhere aren't always properly considered.\n\nOregano's relies on gimmicks--swing music, gigantic menus that are awkward to hold, and cutesy names for the pizzas. Sports fans take note: There is no cable TV.  When I  politely asked if they could turn on the Suns game (this was playoffs time, mind you), I was sternly told that Oregano's is not a sports bar. God forbid anything should distract customers from the frighteningly chirpy wait staff. \n\nSo after waiting a good long while to be seated, expect to be led through a gauntlet of manufactured greetings and well-wishing on the way to your table.

My friend and I were going there about once a month for a year and a half while we were in school. I had never been here so she introduced me. I have now been there several times and this is my favorite of the locations. The tasters I've tried are the toasted ravioli espaniol, boom dip, guaca tony, and Lawrence's stuffed mushrooms.  The ravioli is divine with a nice kick in the cheese and the marinara is my favorite of all of the the marinaras I have tasted.  The boom dip is rich and creamy and the chips are actually a thin crust pizza with cheese on top, there are no words to describe how absolutely wonderful it is.  The guaca tony has the same thin crust pizza to smear guac on and from what I hear the guac is phenomenal, stupid allergies prohibit me tasting.  The stuffed mushrooms are more of a meal than a taster and are a lot meatier than I had imagined but was rich and delicious.  If you get tasters just know that they are huge and that if you plan on dessert it is important to have plenty of people to share with unless you plan on not eating lunch/dinner. \nIn regards to the wings my husband has thoroughly enjoyed the wings of fire and says that they are a different kind of hot more black pepper than hot sauce hot.  He says that they were surprising but that they were a good change.  \nThe salads are like everything else on the menu huge and a little different.  The Julius Caesar has a dressing that is Caesar with a little bit of a different kick.  I normally ask for extra dressing but there was flavor in every bite.  When you add chicken it is finally sliced and you can never get a bite without the chicken, I usually share this with my daughter because it is just to big for one person.  My husband has said that the big beefstro and the antipasto thing are both the best salads he has ever had.  This is high praise since he tends to not like going out.  Every time we have gone out since he compares every salad he comes in contact with the salads from Oregano's and so his taste for other salads has become ruined.  My father-in-law says that the southwestern shrimp caesar is better than he ever imagined.  The shrimp was so tasty that even I liked it and my daughter started trying to steal salad.  \nWe have tried two of the sandwiches sort of on accident.  The Italian stuffed and the fresh grilled Italian sausage.  My mother-in-law meant to order the fresh grilled Italian sausage but accidentally said the Italian stuffed and when it came out she said it was delicious but that she wanted the sausage and mentioned it to the waitress.  The waitress reordered the sausage sandwich and wrapped it up for her to take home and didn't even charge us for it.  I think this really says something about the level of customer service that I have seen every time we go.  We all tasted both and my mother-in-law who is rarely impressed has suggested this place numerous times based on this, oh and dessert. \nThe pizzas are great. I normally don't like the thin crust but feel that they pack a lot in. I read in a review that the Aunt Margarita had no flavor which I thought was odd. It definitely isn't as greasy as some of the pizzas but it has some darn good flavor. The tomatoes are always done just right to give you that juicy tomato quality.\nMy daughter always gets the pasta with the pesto sauce.  She loves the pesto and enjoys the pesto penne bake.  I truly love the ziti since it is flavorful and huge enough for three meals.  I don't really like their Alfredo the dark but it isn't the worst alfredo that I have had.  \nFor dessert I have only ever had their pizza cookie and don't see any reason to change this in the future.  I have had pizza cookie at many places but non that are even close to as yummy as the ones her at Oregano's.  \nYou will definitely find me at an Oregano's again soon.", "business_id": "ML1RJdeZ7bbfMrHvJ7m99A", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-11-06", "type": "review"}

Even when they're not so fancy, you still are left wondering why you're paying so much money for a bowl of something that's essentially noodles with a spiced tomato and onion sauce poured on top of it.\n\nLook, I LOVE my Italian food, and I certainly like visiting the Old Spaghetti Factory as well as Babbo's on occasion, but even these places leave me thinking that their price is a bit inflated.  It left me wondering whether or not there was a \"cheap pasta place\" out there--a joint that would serve up a decent noodles and sauce for a price that I would expect for noodles and sauce.\n\nOregano's--this is IT!  If all you're looking for a simple bowl of pasta like Nonna used to make, you need to order the \"Bollo Pasta\" from this place.  It's bottomless, and the dinner version is $6.99.  The marinara is a little spicy (Southern Italian style), but really great.  If you're hungry, your $6.99 will get you as much as you want until you're ready to unbuckle your belt and go to sleep.\n\nThis is the best bang for your buck Italian that you will find in the Valley, hands down.

No, but for a few bucks, you can get satisfying pasta 'till you want to basta.\n\nOh, and their pizza is pretty good too.", "business_id": "ML1RJdeZ7bbfMrHvJ7m99A", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-11-17", "type": "review"}

Something I never noticed before, but highly appreciate, is that their wines by the glass are VERY inexpensive.  Since I made the switch to wine as my exclusive drink of choice a couple years ago, my restaurant bills have pretty much doubled, but at Oregano's I can go drink for drink with Lance and his tall Bud Lights without being the asshole who added $30 to our bill in booze, so that's always good.\n\nAs I said before, I'm not crazy about their pizza, but their appetizers and salads are delicious, and they have a gigantic cookie on the menu so you can't really go wrong there.  I haven't tried the pasta either, but that's another type of food I have impossibly high standards for restaurants to meet, so I'm probably not the best critic.\n\nBasically, Oregano's is a great place that everyone likes.

I could be completely wrong on the name. Wasn't as strong as I'd like, but tasty.\nWe got a big caesar salad to start. Was big enough for two people. Was just ok...kind of dry in my opinion. Definitely could've used more dressing. Probably wouldn't get again- their other salads look a lot better anyways.\nSomehow in all this, we changed our minds about deep dish (sorry chi town), and went with a \"make your own\" thin crust. I got sausage, pepperoni, spiced feta, roasted garlic, and spinach on my half and my husband got sausage, pepperoni, garlic, and bacon on his.\nI was a little worried about my choices and how they'd turn out shortly after we placed the order. Those ingredients can definitely overwhelm a pizza. The wait was usual...half hr maybe?\nLemme tell you.....that pizza was one of the best pizzas I've ever eaten.......they didn't put TOO much of each topping, so you didn't get too much of one flavor overpowering another (aka garlic or feta). Everything blended perfectly and was so stinkin delicious I never wanted it to end......my husband loved his just as much. \nOverall for the salad, pizza, 2 beers, 2 \"specialty\" drinks, and a tip....the final bill came to around $77. Kind of expensive in my opinion. Adding your own toppings individually can get kind of pricey so I'd probably get a pizza off the menu choices next time?

Three times now I have paid top dollar to have Betsey Johnson dresses cleaned, only to have them returned looking exactly the same as when I dropped them off. Before last week, the last dress I had brought in (which cost me $12.00 on eBay, and that included shipping) cost me $22.00, $11.00 for the dress itself, & $11.00 for the polyester under-slip. There was a spot on the dress when I brought it in which was still there when I picked it up, however, since there was no notification that the spot couldn't be removed, I thought I was going home with a clean dress--as was the case with both other dresses. Btw, DANA argued with me and implied that I am a liar because I said that none of the three items had a tag on them indicating there was a spot that couldn't be removed. Because I had already had two experiences in the past with spots that weren't spot-cleaned, I decided to try hand washing the third dress before donating it to Goodwill...lo & behold, the spot came out. Customers get sick of going back, wasting PRECIOUS time & more money to get things done right, which was why I decided not to bring that particular dress back in. Last week I decided to give them one more chance, so I brought in three dresses to be pressed & one sleeveless gauze top. One of the dresses has layers, but I was not advised when I dropped it off that pressing it would cost $17.00. The other two dresses evidently cost $11.00 apiece to press, & the gauze top about $7.00. At that time, I SPECIFICALLY ASKED for the price to press long dresses, & the clerk, Mayra, told me it would cost about a dollar less than the dry cleaning process. She did not mention A THING about the layered dress costing $6.00 more...evidently I was supposed to intuitively know that the question needed to be asked. In other words, A LIE BY OMISSION. So I spent around $46.00 for the pressing of three dresses & the dry cleaning of one cotton top. I had asked for an $11.00 discount on the current order based on the fact that they didn't do the job right on the last dress I had brought in, & the owner, DANA (DANA wanted me to be sure to mention DANA's name here...happy to oblige!) started shaking and hyperventilating because I told DANA I thought a discount was in order for the inconvenience, as well as the spot that was still present on the last dress after I got it home...which cost me $11.00. I don't think even wealthy people--which I am not--feel they have money like that to blow. I asked DANA what was WRONG with DANA, treating a customer this way, & DANA's response was that DANA is the owner & that DANA can treat me however DANA likes. Man, do I pity DANA's employees. I wasn't asking for an additional $11.00 refund for the extra charge to clean a SLIP. Anyway, evidently DANA would rather make herself sick than be kind/accommodating to a customer. In the two years I was their customer, I had asked twice to have spots re-cleaned, NOT FOR REFUNDS OR CREDITS, yet today DANA basically told me I am a malcontent because I don't like to spend tons of money for nothing. And then DANA said I complained EVERY TIME I picked something up...so DANA is a LIAR, too. Believe me, if I had had that many complaints prior to today, I would have stopped bringing my clothes there a long time ago...today's experience was the FOURTH strike, which is more chances than I give most people who take my money, do a substandard job & then try to blame me instead of doing the right thing by admitting they made a mistake. SPARE ME. And yes, I consider the way DANA treated me--& the job FASHION CLEANERS did--a form of r@pe, because unless I paid their price, I was powerless to get back what is mine (which didn't bother me so much until I paid them $22.00 FOR ABSOLUTELY NOTHING). DANA's complete lack of customer service--& outright RUDENESS to a customer who, in the past, had referred OTHER people to spend their money at Fashion Cleaners--ensured that I won't go back. DANA actually accused ME of being defensive!!!! The girl who waited on me, Mayra, admitted when I left that I had always been very kind in the past, until DANA had a total meltdown today--obviously DANA doesn't know HOW to take criticism. My advice to DANA:  If DANA can't stand the heat, DANA should get shrunk and out of the freakin' kitchen. DANA does not belong in a customer-service oriented profession. PATHETIC. Three strikes, and I gave them the GIFT of another. YOU'RE OUT!

The place was not busy, several workers saw me walk in, did not greet me, and as I stood at the paint counter for several minutes another employee passed me, but did not ask if I needed help. I had to hunt someone down and when I did get an employee he was rudely told to go do something else so that this older women could help me instead. Had she been more knowledgeable in paint or ran that part of the store that would be fine, but she did not seem to be very helpful at all. As she stood there with her coffee mug from home swallowing loudly, she proceeded to tell me that she could not provide the paint I needed (which was originally bought at another Ace location) because they had the \"old base.\" I am not a paint expert, so I questioned her as to whether it would be a visible difference if I used her \"new base.\" She walked away, kept talking to me, as she checked the paints to make sure she didn't have that base, and then came back and kept yelling at me as if she was half way down the aisle. I am in customer service, you do not yell as you are walking away from a customer to confirm something, you simply state \"let me check and make sure.\" So annoyed that this women is now talking very loudly to me about her lack of being able to provide me with matching paint, she offers to make the paint with the \"new base\" and I can see if it matches. I asked her why would I want her to make me paint that I can't potentially use, but still have to pay for. After several minutes of going back and forth I finally just tell her if you can't do this for me just tell me so I can somewhere that can. She continues to talk and try to circle around the fact that she just can't do it and I leave mid conversation because, like I said, I was on some what of a time delay. \n\nFast forward, I run to the original Ace, tell them the story while they make the correct paint for me, and they explain how simple it was for her to just select on the computer what base I had used to modify the color. \n\nNeedless to say, I will always drive 25 minutes out of my way to go to Artie's Ace instead of this one. \n\nGet it together guys, I am obviously not the first or the last person to post a horrible review.

When we decided to move here there were several reasons that made us decide to make the move.  First, we looked at the model apartment for the newly renovated apartments and it was very nice.  Everything was top of the line, it looked fantastic.  We toured the apartment twice.  Both times we were told the apartments get \"all new appliances\".  We were told our apartment would have new windows.  We specifically asked if there would be a ceiling fan in the bedroom, they told us yes there would be one.  The apartments will be all repainted with new fixtures, new counter tops etc.  We were very excited about moving in to a nice apartment.  We put down our deposit and waited for move in day. \n\nMove in day came and we go to the office at 9am to pay the rest we needed to pay and get our keys.  We had movers waiting on us.  We get there and we are told we have to have a money or cashiers check.  This was news to us because no one ever told us that or explained that at any time.  She told us it was in the packet they gave us earlier.  Maybe it was our fault because we missed that.  I never saw it in the packet and they took our personal checks when we applied for the apartments.  It just didn't make much sense.  This made us a little upset because we had movers waiting on us.  We had to run to the bank to get a cashiers check and come back.  Once we had that handled and brought it back we were advised we had to have something printed from the insurance company about our renters insurance.  Once again, no one told us this.  Luckily they let us get the keys and I had the insurance company fax something later in the day.  It was an annoyance at the lack of detail from the leasing office.  Finally we go to look at our new place.  We walked in to find a mess.  I have never been so upset upon moving into an apartment in the 22 years I have been renting.  \n\nWe walked into the apartment to find so many things wrong.  Let me say this, these are far from luxury remodels.  Yes, I am pleased with the kitchen appliances.  They work well and they look very nice.  One thing that is a bit disappointing for this apartment is there is no ice maker in the brand new refrigerator.  This seems like something that would be there for a nice apartment.   Upon inspection of the counter tops there are big bubbles around the seems of the counter.  They do not put new counter tops in.  It is a spray coating on the old counters and it is done very poorly.  It looks bad.  Next, the paint is done horribly through out the apartment.  It was peeling off the wall around the light switches.  The painting on the cabinets was peeled off at the bottoms by the floors in the kitchen and in both bathrooms.  Now let's get the bathrooms.  The grout in the tubs (both of them) was yellow and parts of it missing.  They put brand new fixtures in  but left the old nasty yellow grout.  They obviously didn't even make an attempt to clean it.  Once of the brand new shower curtain rods was completely bent.  In the bedroom no ceiling fan.  This was the one thing we specifically asked about.   When we asked about this they told us they never said there would be one in there and if we wanted one we could buy it and they would put it in for $25.  Seriously?  This really just pissed me off.  We were able to get them to not charge us the $25 and just to save myself the aggravation I went to Home Depot and bought one.   Now there are other things that were not right.  No screen on the sliding door.  They did fix that finally.  No new windows.  The window are so old, there is no insulation, they leak air and you can hear everything outside.  It is terrible.  All screens on the windows that open are full of holes.  We are still waiting for these to get fixed.  We don't open the windows because bugs will get in.  The holes are that big, not to mention they are horribly dirty.  The last item at move in that was a problem was the washer and dryer.  In the model they have a nice brand new washer and dryer, they tell you \"all new appliances\".  We took two tours and were told that on both tours.  We look in the laundry closet and we find a kind of new washer and a dryer that is so old it is not white anymore, it is yellow.  We contacted the office and they said they only put new kitchen appliances.  That is totally not they way the advertise it and not what they tell you.  We feel like we were lied to.  The dryer overheated the first time we used it and they ended up getting us a \"newer one\".  Also, the first time we went to use the washer it went out on us and we had to go to the laundromat to do our laundry.  They finally brought us a washer. It was \"newish\".\nOther problems: Passive manager, LOUD every monday lawn service, trash people are loud.  Stuff going on every day that makes this place horribly loud.  No peace and quite.

Greg told me that because it was monsoon season it might be one to two weeks to get it repaired however he would handle it.  Three weeks later on 30 Aug 2012 I explained that it was not repaired and was again told that it would be taken care of.  I contacted Greg the following week on 7 Sept 2012 and twice the week after that on the 11th and 13th of September.  I was advised that he was working on the situation and instead of taking care of it he referred a roofer to me.  The roofer told me that they would take care of the situation shortly. On 30 October I contacted Greg and informed him that the repair was still not complete.  He told me again that he would work on getting it fixed.  I also spoke to the roofer Greg referred to me and was told that they would have it fixed on Thursday 1 November 2012.

That's not surprising. Most small independent restaurants have this problem. Expect it, and be ok with it so that you can enjoy a delicious meal with no stress. \n\nMy boyfriend always orders the same thing. He prefers to have his soup scalding hot and full of seafood. He is never, ever disappointed in the dish called Champon. It's huge, super hot, chock full of seafood and perfect noodles. He loves it. I think it's tasty, but I'm not so hooked on soup. I order something different every time and we share our dishes. \n\nThe bread basket is always good here. I love their banana bread. It was the perfect forerunner to the chicken salad I ordered on Sunday. I had a beautiful plate brimming full of fresh, delicious spring greens and topped with two grilled chicken breasts that were sliced up and artistically placed upon the heap of greens, then topped with a super tasty light but creamy sesame dressing. I also ordered the sushi combo plate which came with a small salad (for the bf) and a cup of terrific miso soup for $11.00 (it's an appetizer and it totally satisfies)! \n\nMind you, the service lacked. I think there were two servers for the whole restaurant, so ask for a big glass of water when you arrive, or order two drinks in advance. Know the restaurant's limitations and you'll be glad you went, anyway! The ambiance is lovely; the open kitchen makes it so homey and yet romantic with the brick work and artistic lighting. \n\nPS.

That isn't what is wrong with Cherry Blossom.\n\nThe problem with Cherry Blossom is the service which seems to be getting worse. I have taken my family there at least a dozen times and it appears as if the service which was so-so to begin with has deteriorated to just plain incompetent. Today was the final straw. My wife and I arrived there at 11:35 am for an early lunch and while the place was not empty, it was not packed either. We were seated immediately in the back room which was empty when we arrived. The server promptly took our drink order and brought it to us. She said she'd give us a few minutes to look over the menu. A few minutes went by, then another few minutes, then another and by 11:57, our order had still not been taken. At that point, my wife flagged down the host who took our order. I should point out that both my wife and I had ordered two simple lunch items from the menu without any substitutions or special requests. Two minutes later (around 11:59) our server appeared and asked if we had decided what we wanted. After informing her that we just gave our order to the host, she vanished. Both our orders were supposed to come with soup and salad and still by 12:14, neither had arrived. At that point, more people had arrived and the several tables in the back room where we were had become occupied. We also noticed that these customers, who arrived well after we had, had been served their salads, soups and even their meals while we sat there waiting. At that point I went to speak with the host about where our missing salads and soups were and she smiled politely but did not respond. My wife and I decided we were not going to pay for such incompetent service and just walked out. The last time I was there, the service was slow and they did not bring one of the salads for one of the meals we ordered. Other times we have gone there and waited 10 minutes to even be asked for our drink order when the place was not even half full. It just seems to get worse and worse at Cherry Blossom.\n\nSo in conclusion. If you enjoy sitting and waiting while watching other customers who walked in 10 or 15 minutes or more after you did get their orders taken and served their food, this is the place for you. It is my belief that management is to blame for Cherry Blossom's poor service. Fortunately, I can take my money and spend it elsewhere and that's just what we did after we left. Cherry Blossom will not be getting any more visits from us.", "business_id": "AkOruz5CrCxUmXe1p_WoRg", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-10-20", "type": "review"}

It's pretty cozy inside, like someone said, Asian European.  The menu is huge.  I'm typically a picky person and will only find one or two things on any given menu that I want to eat, but this menu...I would try half of it.\n\nHowever, I had a hankerin' for sushi, so that's what I ordered.  I was a little disappointed that they didn't have an individual selection of nigiri to choose from, but they did have a combo option for nigiri, which is usually what I like to see anyway.  I decided to try the Philly roll and the Alaskan roll.  I was also concerned this might not fill me up, so I also ordered a bowl of miso ($2).\n\nFirst of all, the miso was delicious.  It had raw cabbage in it, which I didn't really like (nor have I seen it before), but other than that, it was one of the best miso soups I've ever had.  Secondly, the Philly roll was awesome!  It was made with smoked salmon, which made it a million times more delicious than usual. The Alaskan roll had cooked salmon, and it was good, but couldn't compare to the Philly roll with smoked salmon.\n\nAlso, I didn't realize they served bread at the table (wasn't really expecting that at an Asian restaurant).  We had two rolls and two cinnamon and sugar crostinis in our basket.  They were both good.  Nothing special about the rolls, though.  Just your typical dinner roll.  Because of the bread, I ended up being super full at the end of my meal, which I wasn't expecting at all.\n\nMy fiance ordered the shrimp pad thai.  He asked for super-extra hot, but it came not spicy at all.  They gave him chili sauce, though, which helped him out.  He absolutely loved it.  Normally, he doesn't really like Thai or Japanese food that much, but he couldn't stop talking about how good his food was.  That's a giant thumbs up for this place, just for impressing him with Thai food.\n\nOverall it was excellent.  We went at 8pm on a Sunday night and the place was packed.  I see that as a great sign.  Our service was normal, nothing to complain about, so overall, the two of us gives Cherryblossom Noodle Cafe 5 stars :)", "business_id": "AkOruz5CrCxUmXe1p_WoRg", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-09-26", "type": "review"}

It had been a grueling day and I wanted to get away, so I hopped in the car and started driving until I saw a storefront with a line out the door. After waiting for about 15 minutes I pointed to the picture on the wall. Having no idea what it was, I had ordered Tempura Udon.\n\nI dunked one of the thick shaggy pieces of shrimp into the savory broth and watched as the tempura quickly soaked up the broth. The flavors were ethereal.\n\nMy initial slurp of thick slippery udon is among the great food experiences I've ever had. Unfortunately, I've never had udon that has compared to that first steaming bowl.\n\nAfter driving by Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe in Phoenix many times, I finally stopped in. They excel at their namesake with tasty noodles and more offerings than you can shake a wet noodle at.\n\nIt's a calming space with a quick, friendly wait staff and a menu that's mostly Asian inspired. There's a section dedicated to Italy, though I'm not sure how much curry and ginger Italians use in their pasta.\n\nCherry Blossom also offers many salads, including Tokyo Chicken Coleslaw ($7.60). It's essentially a Chinese chicken salad with grilled chicken, cabbage, lettuce and daikon sprouts in a tangy vinaigrette dressing. It's deliciously light and refreshing.\n\nA friend once told me that the spiciness of a spicy sushi roll was invented to help disguise the flavor of fish that might not be so fresh. While I'm not saying that the Spicy Salmon Roll ($5.60) wasn't freshly made, it was so fishy that it was inedible. Spicy as it was, it couldn't disguise the flavor that remained with me after the first try.\n\nThe California Roll ($4.40) fared better, but then again it was just a California Roll, imitation crab, cucumber and avocado wrapped in rice.\n\nMoving right into noodles, the egg version used in the Korean Spicy Beef ($10.50) were so chewy and fun to eat, I only wished the bowl was larger. Spiked with green peppers and tender sliced of beef, this wasn't as spicy as I has hoped, but this was quickly remedied with a side of chile paste.\n\nMy eyes widened as my Ebi-Ten Udon Noodle ($8) arrived. It was a large bowl filled with huge udon noodles paired with soup and steamed spinach. Along side were several pieces of shrimp tempura that were golden and inviting. Could this be what I've been searching for all of these years? After one sip my hopes plunged; just not quite the same. The flavor of the dashi, the basic soup stock used for udon, was a little too strong. Don't get me wrong, it was a very good bowl but, not quite the sensation I experienced so many years ago. Perhaps it's never as good as the first time.", "business_id": "AkOruz5CrCxUmXe1p_WoRg", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-09-30", "type": "review"}

Other tasty items I have enjoyed here are: cali crunchy roll, double shrimp crunchy roll, grilled chicken salad (w/ginger dressing instead), calamari, edamame & I have tried a couple different pasta dishes which were surprisingly good!", "business_id": "AkOruz5CrCxUmXe1p_WoRg", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-11-10", "type": "review"}

That being said it does have some problems. Here are the pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n\nThe Food. The food is absolutely fantastic. Everything is good here. I've had sushi, salads, Italian pasta, udon soup, desserts, all of it. I've never had something that was less than good and most of it is delicious. I've brought many friends and family and they agree the food is good.\n\nThe Prices. The prices are very reasonable and despite many visits we are often surprised with how low our bill is considering the quantity and quality of food.\n\nCons:\n\nThe Service. The service isn't exactly bad but it is frequently very slow. The servers are polite but it can be hard to flag them down and difficult to get refills especially during busy times. Also, beware because ordering sushi here is an extremely slow process. I've had friends get full meals from appetizer through dessert before I even get my sushi.\n\nThe Bathrooms. The bathrooms are shared with another restaurant and are usually quite filthy. They are also single stall bathrooms which I hate in a restaurant.\n\n\nI do recommend you eat here though. The food is most definitely worth it. The cons really aren't enough to stop me. Just plan for some extra time.", "business_id": "AkOruz5CrCxUmXe1p_WoRg", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-11-21", "type": "review"}

My go-to order is TanTan-Men which is actually kind of a problem considering I love it so much I rarely venture out from it and I'm sure there are other noodle dishes that are just as delicious that I am missing out on (feel bad for me). But, if you like spice, the TanTan-Men is the way to go. It will fill your stomach and clear your sinuses, and the order is HUGE. Definitely a two, or maybe even three, sitting meal. Which reminds me, once after dining in and barely denting my ginormous soup order, I proceeded to have a minor panic attack about how I was going to get this ramen equivalent of hoover dam into a to-go container without spilling it all over myself and causing a major scene. This panic attack proved to be completely unwarranted, since as soon as I said I wanted to take the rest home they took it and neatly packaged it FOR ME which was very nice and appreciated (I'm seriously not sure what I would have done if they brought me a container...cried, possibly). \n\nThis is the kind of service I'm writing this review about. Let me explain:\n\nEvery year since I've known him, my boyfriend hibernates from approximately January to June to study for an extremely difficult exam called the \"CFA\".  It's like the Bar except it's harder, it's about finance, and you have to take (and pass) a newer and harder level every year for three years to finally become a \"CFA\". This year the test was in June and of course, as soon as he was done with it we wanted to do something we hadn't been able to do for quite a while: a good old fashioned bar crawl.  This bar crawl went pretty long and at one point I remember playing the always appropriate song \"Stay Fly\" by Academy Award winning rap group Three Six Mafia on a jukebox at some dive bar whose name I can't even recall right now. Fast forward 24 hours later, and I can't find my wallet. I just KNEW I lost it on the bar crawl, and highly suspected it was during aforementioned jukebox session. I called every bar we visited to no avail and finally just came to terms with the fact that my cherry red Kate Spade wallet that I loved was gone forever. I bought a new wallet, got a new ID, new credit cards, all that fun stuff, and went on with my life.\n\nFast forward a couple months later. There's a package at my door. It's from Cherry Blossom Noodle Caf\u00e9. \"Hmm...I don't remember ordering takeout from Cherry Blossom Noodle Caf\u00e9,\" I think, \"and if I did, sending it UPS is a very odd method of delivery\".  Then it dawned on me...what's my hangover food of choice after a good old fashioned bar crawl that ends with me playing inappropriate songs by Academy Award winning rap groups at bars whose name I can't recall? OMG NOODLES!!!!  Oh yes, I went to Cherry Blossom the next day for a hangover lunch, left my wallet there, and proceeded to completely block out the entire trip while trying to remember what bar I could have possibly left my wallet at the night before.  They got my address from my ID, packaged it up, paid the shipping, and MAILED IT TO ME. It was seriously one of the happiest days of my life. Any place that will go that much out of their way (Mind you, I never even CALLED them about the wallet. They had nothing to go on here.) to help a customer will never get less than 5 stars in my book though it doesn't hurt that their food is delicious, cures hangover, and packs itself up to go without you making a scene. Thank you, Cherry Blossom!", "business_id": "AkOruz5CrCxUmXe1p_WoRg", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-10-09", "type": "review"}

Since then I've tried another place besides Cherryblossom in the Valley and have been told that Phoenix just doesn't have a good \"ramen scene.\" I'm glad I didn't give up my search before I remembered this place! \n\nOther reviewers are right, this place is definitely buzzing with activity, and with only one cook and what appeared to be one server on a Sunday evening they were doing remarkably well. It did, however, take a little while for the waiter to see us once we were seated, and the table next to us complained about not being given menus. Part of that may have been due to the layout of the restaurant- we were in a side room that seemed cut off from the rest of the place. \n\nOnce our orders were placed the food arrived fairly quickly, and our drinks were delivered about the same time. To start we had gyoza, which arrived piping hot. \n\nHe had the Tan-Tan Men (spicy ramen,) and I had the Cha-shu (a more traditional-style ramen.) As usually happens when I dine out with my boyfriend, he chose the better dish. The broth was very flavorful and spicy enough to set his nose running, which according to him was one of the more important criteria... I can't really argue with that logic since I treat horshradish similarly. \n\nMy ramen dish was excellent, jealousy of my boyfriend's meal aside. The amount of pork in it was plentiful, and the noodles were soft and not too overcooked.\n\nThe atmosphere of this place is very friendly and inviting, it would be a great place to grab lunch on a not-so-busy day, but it was still enjoyable even with the wait. It lent itself well to casual conversation. \n\nIf you are a little impatient (or your date is) then it might be best to try somewhere a little less hectic. However if you don't mind sitting around a bit and chatting, I highly recommend checking out this local noodle house.", "business_id": "AkOruz5CrCxUmXe1p_WoRg", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-11-24", "type": "review"}

If I could, I would give this place 0 stars.  The severe lack of service and communication I received and am still receiving from this excuse for a mechanic is unfathomable.  \n\nI took my car in a couple weeks ago for an oil change.  I knew there could be some additional things that need done so I was completely prepared for that.  Lo and behold the manager calls me and tells me I need new tires, plugs, coils, thermostat, and fuel system cleaned.  After quoting me a ridiculously high price I asked that they ONLY complete the plugs, coil, and oil change.  Of course, they added on the thermostat as well.  This tells me they either did not listen to me or did not care.  Either way, strike 1 of many.\n\nWhen I dropped my car off I expressed to them it MUST be done that day as I needed it for work.  Well they close at 8 so I figured no problem since I dropped it off at 11am.  No phone call from them after the initial assessment at 2pm.  When I called them at 6pm for status I was told they were waiting on 1 part for the thermostat (which I did not request) and that once it was received it would be 5 minutes and done.  Fast forward to 7:45pm and no call.  I call them back and was told the part did not arrive and it would not be done.  I expressed my frustration with the process thus far and was told it WILL be done by 8am when I had to leave for work.  SURPRISE....it was not done.  I had to get a ride to work and was told my car would be delivered to me at work.  Against my better judgment I agreed to this.  This part that should take 5 minutes once received took over 5 hours.  Once again I call for status and was told they were on their way.  fast forward 2 more hours and they have not arrived.  I work in tempe, not far.  Come to find out the mechanic drove my car to another shop to do who knows what and pick up someone then deliver my car to me.  Not happy about that at all and then I get in my car and they leave their empty pop cans/garbage in my car.  By this time I'm fuming.  \n\nLater that night the manager blows up my phone to get paid of course.  He keeps asking for my CC info to pay him but never bothers to tell me the total or breakdown or how I'm going to get a receipt.  He also states he is going to talk to his District manager regarding the experience I had and get back with me the next day regarding some sort of compensation (shockingly this was never done and I never received a call).  Finally I get the total from him and reluctantly pay it with the promise he will email me a receipt.  Here we are over a week later, 3 phone calls to the store, and 3 emails to corporate and still have no receipt!  \n\nNext step is to visit the store, yet again, for a receipt and I believe additional recourse is in order.  I honestly have NEVER received such terrible service in my life.  The sad part is I have taken my car here before when the old manager was there and received phenomenal service.  I thought I had found a mechanic I could trust and that would take care of my car and myself.  I was certainly wrong.  It seems the corporate office doesn't even care about their customers.

It's a rare to find piece in used market. In my search on Autotrader, Coulter cadillac, Phoenix, AZ showed up. Initially they were not willing to give it for the price I offered. When Glen Heiser from Internet sales got back to me, I bumped up my offer price, for which he agreed. He gave me the final out of the door price, I again asked him to reduce the price by $700, so that the price can be rounded off to lowest thousand amount. He got back to me stating that the price is reduced. Remember, all this was happening over the phone. I neither looked at the car nor test drove it. Finally I asked him if there is any body work that needs to be taken care of, he said there are minor things and he offered to take car of them, which he did. \n\nI got my loan processed, sent them the check and they shipped me the vehicle. I loved the first look of the vehicle but I had my own doubts. I test drove it, took it for a car wash and it looked amazing. I found that the Dust protectors around front brakes were deformed, I though this happend while shipping and asked Glenn to send me the pictures they posted on their web site before sale. Glenn was curtious to send me the pcitures and the deformation was in the pictures as well. I took my Audi to an Audi mechanic. He looked at it, test drove the car and asked me to be at ease and be at peace. He said I got a very good deal. \n\nSo over all, the price was $1000 more than what I initially asked for, vehicle is in perfect condition. The customer service and peace of mind that Glenn offered was top notch. His pre sale and post sale customer service were excellent.

We've spoken to an attorney about the case. I noticed the dealership remodeled this year, so I find it impossible to believe any claim that they couldn't cover this expense. They cannot legally require us to use their service department, but that's where the bulk of their money is made. Had we used that they would've probably covered this because they would just be giving us our money back for overpriced and unnecessary service.\nThe next step would be a Class Action Case.\n\nIF YOU CAME TO THIS PAGE YOU ARE SMART ENOUGH TO WANT TO KNOW IF YOU SHOULD BY A GM MADE VEHICLE. \nCommon sense would say that if you wouldn't run into a burning building then it probably isn't a SAFE choice to by a GM car. The following story could happen to you.  For the record, they seem to have an airtight loophole so they NEVER have to cover lemon defects!!!!  Be smart and steer clear unless you've got money to burn....\n\nLook below to see the final decision offered to us by GM. What I find interesting is their complete omission of the most important facts.\n*All service records are available that show that ALL services were done on time. They have declined these. It is illegal to require that the dealership service departments be used, however that element has been stated several times as part of the decision factors. \n*This four year old vehicle had to have an engine replacement at 75k miles approximately for defective lifters. This was covered under our warranty because it was a defect. That was at approximately the two year mark.\n*We are now needing the same defective lifters dealt with in the REPLACEMENT ENGINE supplied by GM at about 75k miles from the time of that replacement. We are now at about the two year mark again.\n\nThe response below is presenting the cars data now of 143k miles and 4 years as if the engine wasn't replaced in the middle. Our vehicle is past our warranty for mileage and age BUT they are not offering ANY WARRANTY on the replacement engine. Typically there is a 3 year warranty, which is now down to 1 year(so said in the last conversation but prior to that it was stated as 3 years) and neither includes mileage. This basically means that they could put in a new engine with a defect and not be legally bound to cover that for any amount of time. They have referred to our issue as \"unexpected\" engine problems. Apparently this is a problem that MANY of this year and model have had. That's not unexpected then on the part of GM. This information is readily available, so feel free to check it out. It's only unexpected from the consumer position!\n\nSince the \"resolution\" seems to be final I really hope that other consumers will read this and take it into account when purchasing a GM vehicle. They own four brands...\n\nGood morning Sarah, \n\nWe understand that this was not the outcome you were hoping for and we truly apologize for any frustration this has caused. You have the right to expect long-term reliable performance from your vehicle and every effort has been made to assure excellent quality for our customers. We handle customer's concerns on a case by case basis and thoroughly look into various factors before delivering the resolution. Such factors are, age of the vehicle, mileage on the vehicle and warranty parameters. \n\nBased on the factors we mentioned, your vehicle does not meet the criteria and we are unable to assist with your engine replacement request. As your Yukon XL Denali has over 140,000 miles on it, it is out of Bumper to Bumper Warranty by age and mileage and out of Powertrain Warranty by mileage. We rely on our dealerships to be our eyes and ears in the field, as they investigate each vehicle and take these factors into consideration before determining the resolution. \n\nAt this time, the resolution stands and if you have any additional questions regarding the details of your case, please direct those to your agent. I will certainly document our conversation within our system and notify your agent accordingly. \n\nSincerely, \n\nSamantha N\nGM Customer Care", "business_id": "E3sONi8kCTBL96OjzpgBsA", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-11-06", "type": "review"}

We called to make a reservation and when we came in we were seated without menus. Now working in restaurants this is almost un-heard of but like I said we were hungry...\n\nThe waiter came over and asked if we would like something to drink (A little rudely) but like I keep saying we were hungry. Since we didn't have any menus including a wine menu, we asked the waiter to see some menus. He proceeded to only bring a wine menu...\n\nAfter we made are choice we laid the menu down in clear vision of the waiter (A definite sign to come back to the table.) He then proceeded to take the other tables' orders. (Perfectly fine). Oh and they had both food and drink menus as this comes back later in the story.\n\nWe waited for a solid 10 min before trying to flag down the waiter....NOTHING. We decided to try to flag him down and he was having none of it. We then got up from the table and left! Walking right passed the so called manager (Older lady with short brown hair) she told us to have a good night as if we just had a great dinner.....\n\nWe were so hungry we needed to go somewhere else!! On the way to a much nicer and hospitable establishment. I called Cristo's and asked to speak to the manager. The lady who told us to have a good night answered and told us she was the head manager and then proceeded to tell us that not giving people who sit down at a restaurant menus unless they ask... I had never been so offended in my life. A straight up LIE!! \n\nI could not hear any more. Hopefully the owner reads this and make this right.

I was expecting to dine here but it was much more similar to a diner experience were you get whammed bammed and thank you'd as we were in and out in a jiffy.\n\nMy husband loves classic Italian Foods and according to reviews Christo's seemed like a top destination. Honestly in general the food was OK but not great and nothing I'd drive out of my way for. I almost never consider service as part of my review since it varies all the time everywhere but in this case it sort of even lessened the experience so MUCH that I have to consider it otherwise I would have given Christo's three stars.\n\nOur waiter quickly greats us and ask if we want the menu or the restaurant week special. Despite being around 70 years old he was very quick talking and very speedy and sort of made us nervous but what really bothered me the most was him  and his helpers standing there not to far from us with his arms crossed just watching us like a hawk eating the whole time. \n\nNow the food.\n\nI started with a Christo's Caesar Salad. I could tell the dressing was house made as well as the croutons. The dressing wasn't properly emulsified nor was it balanced in flavors and was super heavy with lemon. The croutons were crisp and buttery. I pointed out the faults since I know them but it really was an OK salad. I do note I wasn't offered fresh ground pepper, nicer restaurants do offer fresh ground pepper for Caesar Salads.\n\nI was sort of excited to have the classic dish Sole Meuniere here. The Christo's Version is nontraditional as the fish seemed heavily coated (maybe battered not sure) with flour in a lemon white wine sauce in stead of a traditional lightly floured and prepared in browned butter. The fresh spinach on the side was just plain without anything on it. \n\nDesserts seemed house made and were OK. We both liked the lemon cake better over the mousse.\n\nA glass of house wine was included with our dinners and during the meal we finished it and my husband ordered another round. He noticed a price difference from the menu and questioned our server. The server confirmed it wasn't the same price as the menu and said that for restaurant week they up charge the wine. It was only a few dollars but I feel this is bad business and not good for customer relations.\n\nI was really torn between two and three stars but the surprise of the wine up charge, being really rushed though dinner and with the waiter and his help all standing across from us just watching us the whole time in a unprofessional way sort of spoiled the dining experience.\n\n2.5 Stars", "business_id": "3CSaqRNvYg7ZdN2zwxwzVw", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-09-28", "type": "review"}

Our server waited on them and brought out wines/drinks and salads to them before we had any items on our table.  This group behind us were definitely in \"party mode\" as they were getting louder and louder. After we finished our soup and salad, the noise level from that table was now at disaster level. We were not able to hear or speak to anyone at our table due to the noise. We asked to move and were seated in the bar area where it was much quieter.

After leasing for my college-age daughter for one year, we moved her to a new place.   Promised repairs took weeks on end - including repair of broken pipe in neighboring wall that flooded the bedroom and replacement of the carpet/repaint, etc of damage.  Many follow-up calls were required, and even then, some were not properly done.  Also the management engaged in some very sketchy behavior - one example is insisting that rent be paid on-line (not in the lease), then charged a $75.00 late fee when the payment was not made before midnight EAST COAST TIME!  When confronted with the issue, the first position was that their bank is on the east coast, so okay to use that time period for rent payments in Arizona.  When disabused of that notion, they agreed they had to reimburse the money, but did so only by crediting the amount to the next month's rent --- that is, they took my daughter's  money and used it for a month, leaving her without needed cash for food.  Perhaps knowing their managers are not too good, in recent times (Winter-Spring 2014), there seemed to be a different person in the office every time my daughter or I went in -- and no one knows what the other is doing.  Too bad, because the property is conveniently located and could be a very nice place if properly managed and maintained.

The front passenger side quarter panel was crumpled, the headlight annihilated, and my hopes were dashed of having an pleasant three-day Columbus weekend. Fuming, I drove home in silence and plotted my revenge.\n\nThe next morning I started the ball rolling with my insurance to get the necessary repairs. It took until Monday afternoon to finally get a commitment from them, and that was to take the car to one of their preferred repair shops (which I have no problem with, as I've not been involved in such an accident before and appreciated their suggestion). That led me to CTCC, where David processed my claim and even set up email notification of the progress on my car. It was like cyber messages letting me know he'd be coming home soon. How lovely.\n\nSo, a week and a half later, I get my car back and it's cleaner than I ever remember it and runs smartly.

That's exactly what happened with Tony's.  To be fair, the cleaning service was fine.  They didn't lose or damage my clothes and they all came back fine.\n\nHowever, I certainly wasn't blown away with the customer service.  The lady who took my clothes was adequately pleasant, but didn't take the time to answer my questions--well, she didn't even give me the chance to ask them.  She didn't count the items in front of me as most places do, she didn't ask about stains or starch preferences, nor did she warn me that my wife's silk robe would cost almost as much to clean ($13) as it was to buy.  The only information/confirmation I got regarding my order was in the receipt she gave me before I left.  She didn't tell me when my order would be ready until I came back into the store to ask after having gotten into my car.  And I found out later that the order was ready a day earlier than her quoted pick-up date (something she apparently does regularly to cover her butt, which I get, but I really could've used some of the pieces a day earlier). \n\nThe prices were okay.  They weren't ridiculous, but were on the high side.  My biggest issue was with my wife's silk robe, which is pretty small and thin.  Thirteen dollars seemed high--maybe it's not--but I should have been warned about something that expensive since we would not have had it cleaned had we known the price.  My 3 dress shirts came out to $6.75, five pairs of pants totaled $27.75, and a silk blouse was $6.20.  \n\nThese totals were prior to Tony's tacking on an 8% \"Environmental\" fee; I have no idea what this includes. Again, I'm new to the area, so I don't know whether this is required by local law or just something Tony's has created to add 8% to their revenue.  But I've never heard of it before and was a little annoyed when I saw it on the bill, as this was something else that would've been nice to have been warned about.\n\nThe parking situation also sucks.  They've only got parking for two cars.  \n\nTo be fair, I was satisfied with the actual dry-cleaning; I can't really complain about how my clothes were cleaned and pressed.

On the second coat the sleeves and the coat length were to be shortened.\n\nWe, my daughter (who's coats these were) and I, returned to Tony's a week later to pick up both coats. My daughter tried on the first coat, that only needed the sleeves shortened, and she looked a bit apprehensive and a bit perplexed. But none-the-less she opted to take the coat as she was leaving back to college and needed the coat. When we left Tony's my daughter commented that it didn't feel right in the sleeves, as if it was bunching and it felt uncomfortable to her. I told her to leave it but she insisted that she would need a coat.\n\nThe second coat that needed both the sleeves and length shortened was left there because they said it wasn't ready and would be another week. When I returned a week later to pick up the coat it was very visible to me that the job was not done properly. The front of the coat was uneven, I would come to later find out, it was a whole 1/2 inch off. Also, at the bottom of both the right and left sides of the coat there was a zigzag stitch that shouldn't have been there, it should have been a straight stitch. The sleeves also looked as if there was too much lining fabric where it joins the exterior of the coat. From the backside of the coat, at the bottom, the lining was visible (hanging down too far). When I questioned the employee she said her seamstress was gone for the day and to just leave the coat there so she could fix it.\n\nWhen I returned 2 weeks later to pick up the coat there were no changes made to the coat at all.

I asked why the seamstress didn't go in from inside the lining and she said, \"That would have been too much work\". When questioned why it was still uneven she said it was because it was on the hanger and that once I put the coat on it would be fine. I explained to her that that wasn't the way it was when I originally purchased the coat, that the coat was nice and even at the bottom. She insisted I put the coat on, I told her it wasn't my coat and it wouldn't fit me because the coat belonged to my daughter who was away at college by this time.\n\nBy this time I just wanted to take my coat somewhere else to have it fixed but she was insistent on having the seamstress do repairs right then while I waited. I told her no that the coat had already been left there for them to fix and they failed to do anything to fix it in the three weeks since it was originally promised to me. I simply wanted my coat and I expressed that I wasn't going to pay for it because the job wasn't done properly and she grabbed my coat. I then pulled out my cell phone to call the police so that I could get my merchandise back and she proceeded to charge me for the work done, even though it was very clear that I was not satisfied and I was neither confident nor comfortable with leaving my coat any longer. The owner proceeded to tell me to never bring anything to her again and I promised her I wouldn't.\n\nIt's been several weeks but I've since had this coat fixed by FIT ALTERATIONS, they did a phenomenal job! I would advise to NEVER take anything to TONY'S CLEANERS AND TAILORS FOR ALTERATIONS. I really don't think the seamstress knows what she's doing.", "business_id": "mE52ELf36a9fa5PdXLu9Ow", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-10-29", "type": "review"}

A good haircut is second to none. As the saying goes, \"you're only as good as your last haircut.\" What's really nice about A&D Barber Shop is that your cut will be phenomenal, because Arthur takes his time with a cut. I've been plenty of barber shops that can give you your cut and sweep you out the door, but it isn't always to my standards. I get a super high and tight fade to skin with a very severe side part, and almost no length taken off the top. It's a more difficult cut than your normal taper and fade. And lots of barbers have botched it. Arthur tackles it no problem. We socialize the entire time and he couldn't be friendlier. There are complaints about wait time, but it's a barber shop. Wait time happens. And scheduling appointments at barber shops isn't like making a set-in-stone appointment at a salon.  Realistic expectations are your best bet, you can always call ahead to see what the wait is like! All in all, I get great haircuts from here and enjoy the time I'm getting them cut.

Talk about a diet deviation!  I was a little nervous to disappoint him as he's from Illinois and Great Dane's claims to serve Chicago Style Dogs. I took a deep breath and went inside.\n\nGreat Dane's is an older building that could be designated as a charming little hole in the wall. The inside is covered with pictures of dogs, those you eat and those you pet. \n\nWe went to the counter to order and were greeted warmly. The girl behind the counter was friendly and explained what the various types of dogs were. Mr. Hottie chose 2 Chicago Style dogs (Great Danes) and I chose the Hound Dog (a larger hot dog) with cheese, chili and sauerkraut (hey... don't knock it until you try it). All the dogs come with your choice of fries or coleslaw.\n\nWe grabbed a small table and waited for our order. It wasn't long before our food was brought to our table. My hot dog was delicious. The meat was all Vienna Beef and it wasn't at all greasy or mushy. My hot dog was actually \"meaty\" if you will. Mr. Hottie's dogs were good! (Sigh of relief). He said the same thing about his dog. A few observations he had was that he wished that they added more Sports peppers on the dog. It only came with one on each dog. He also wished for more tomato. The dogs automatically came with sauerkraut which, I learned, is not usually on a traditional Chicago dog unless you ask for it. \n\nOverall, we liked Great Dane's. It's a little old gem and I'm sure we'll visit it again whenever we're feeling naughty and craving wieners! HOT DOGS YOU PERVS! Go check it out.

I took full advantage of such for the VHS or Beta/Walter Meego show by getting my pre-party on at my place, walking over, and going through a small kaleidescope of drinks there to gauge their prices and quality.\n\nG&T's were 4 dollars, small, and not that alcoholic or tasty. Pretty disappointing for a hole in the wall bar on a Tuesday night. Next I went to Stella which was 4.50, also disappointing. Next, I struck paydirt when I got a can of PBR which was on special for 1.50. 1.50! There was a huge sign too! How did I miss that! I made sure to atone for my mistake by drinking as many as possible during the VHS or Beta performance.\n\nThe venue itself is not incredibly moving, but serviceable. Just a rectangular, closed off brick building painted black on the inside with no decorations other then some blue tube lighting around the bar and some broken down ceiling fans. I'm fine with a broken down old music venue for a show, but this place doesn't seem like it was ever much. I think they could do a little something to give it more character. \n\nAlso disappointing was the HUGE smoking patio which has no view of the inside and you can't bring a drink out.

Our night was not so hot.   Half of the bad that we caught wasn't worthy of stage time, the other half was.  The horn players were exceptional, the Keyboardist wasn't.  I'll stick to the facility.  The Rhythm Room is a Phoenix, classic on the music scene, or so I'm told.  This was evident when Paul Reed showed up with his horn and just joined the band on stage.  That was cool and made you feel like you were in the right place.  Beyond that, I'm can't really claim that this place is worth the time.  We'll have to try it again to confirm, yet my urge to do so isn't high right now.  The neighborhood is questionable.  The entrance is not obvious, the bar and the service are not inviting.  The music area of the building is excellent.  You sit very close to the band.  The one thing they need to fix within that is two sets of band doors would allow for a much faster setup/teardown between bands.  We waited for an hour between bands.  The Rhythm Room is missing an opportunity here, they need a comedian or something the fill the gap.  \n\nSome fresh eyes on how this place is run could really make some simple improvements.  Just because it's a known classic doesn't mean that it can't change for the better.  The one thing they have right is that the sound is good and if they're getting good bands, then it makes for a great night.  The annoyances only become obvious when you have an hour to descern them between bands.\n\nThe musician's interaction with the crowd before and after shows is really cool.

I was past the 3,000 mile mark on my car and thought maybe the employees could see if some fluids were low or otherwise just change my oil. After 10 minutes of waiting the gentleman informed me my oil is 60% full and pretty much branch new. All fluids were full too. He said I could change my filter if needed, and even then it wasn't necessary. He also said my issue sounded more like a belt problem. Meanwhile, without me actually paying for a service the other guys were wiping down my dash and windows! \n\nI felt no pressure to purchase anything since I really didn't need to. I felt embarrassed for thinking that I needed an oil change, but the guys didn't treat me any differently. They were genuine, friendly, honest people.

From the moment a salesperson spotted me, it was all about insisting I make a decision right then and there. Upon seeing a specific car amongst my pile of print-outs, the salesperson actually forced a family-- who was in the process of buying that car-- out of it so that I could test drive it, seemingly more interested in needling her coworker than in what I (or this other family) was actually interested in purchasing. (When I said I didn't want the car, she proceeded to tell the other salesperson I did, just to annoy him for a time.) \n\nTwo of the three *certified* pre-owned cars I looked at had problems. The first had a door ajar light and warning bells come on as I was driving it, when no doors were open. The second had a very large tear in the upholstery. The third car didn't have trouble as far as I could tell-- except that it was out of gas. We had to wait 30+ minutes for the salesperson to find a lot attendant to find a gas can and fill it-- and then find the equipment to jump the car's battery as well. Once I decide to pursue a car at this dealership, the high pressure turned higher. Despite originally telling me she could get the price down to my limit, the salesperson then proceeded to ridicule me as if I were an idiot intent on stealing from her when I couldn't go above my set price. I finally had enough and left. When the salesperson called the next day, she acted as if I had done her wrong when I decided that indeed, I would not purchase the car. \n\nWe were at this dealer for many hours, but only got to test drive three cars because no one seemed to have a clue where anything was-- from keys, to gas cans, to managers who could actually authorize decisions, to one of the *cars*. The salesperson made unpleasant comments about my companion's father, who knows cars and was giving me advice by phone. She gave me incorrect information about one of the cars I was test driving (which I looked up later online.) She also made borderline inappropriate and definitely intolerant comments about immigrants and religion. \n\nI stayed at first because Camelback has a big selection of pre-owned certified cars, because of their 5 day no hassle return policy, and because I didn't know that high pressure wasn't the only way car dealers sell. The next day I went elsewhere, where I was treated as a human, given time to think about my decisions, given a *real* test drive on a highway (not just around the block), and ultimately ended up buying a car. Their prices seem good (not on the sticker, but once you talk to a dealer it magically drops $5k and I think some prices may be too good to be true??) but I would NOT recommend Camelback.", "business_id": "MdDCaLarh1aWU9NfB6SQjA", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-10-25", "type": "review"}

Unfortunately he (along with everyone else that worked with us) was entirely dishonest. They finally came up with a plan for me that would roll my negative equity over into the new Jetta. Even though the payment was higher than I wanted to pay, I was happy just to get out of the Audi!

I purchased a car from this dealership in May 2012 and I definitely wish I had gone somewhere else. Due to their complete lack of customer service, I wouldn't recommend anyone buy a car or do business of any kind with Camelback VW.\n\nHere is a bit about our experience...\n\nI hadn't purchased a car from a dealer in 11 years, so the process was a bit scary to me. The reason I decided to start my search at Camelback VW was because the listed price for the vehicle I was looking for was about $2000 less than the other dealers had listed. I tried to negotiate the price down further but since their price was $2000 less than other dealers already, they would not negotiate the price any lower than what they had listed. In the end, I should have just left and gone to another dealer and tried to negotiate with them, I'm sure I probably could have gotten the same or a better deal elsewhere with a lot less hassle and irritation. \n\nFirst, our salesman Mario seemed irritated to have to be working at all. He seemed less than happy to have a customer to deal with, seemed irritated at my questions and made it seem as though I was doing him a disservice by purchasing a car from him. The vehicle I purchased was certified used, 1 year old, and it was not detailed when I test drove it. I really thought it was strange that a dealer would have a used car that was so obviously not clean sitting on the lot. The car appeared to have dried milkshake left in the front and back cup holders, the inside windows had not been cleaned and there was dirt on the back seats like a child had spilled food. When I asked if they had just gotten the car in, I was told it had been there about 3 weeks. 3 weeks sitting on the lot in less than clean condition? No wonder it had been priced so low.. I also asked Mario about the front tires because they looked like they weren't in good condition. Mario assured me that there was plenty of life left in the tires and they would never sell a vehicle with bad tires. I should have left then.\n\nBut ultimately I decided to buy, and get financing through VW Credit. At the time I figured I was already there and I wasn't sure I would find a better deal elsewhere at that point and I didn't want to pass it up and the car to be gone. Now, I'm sure I could have found a better deal and based on my research, I'm certain I was overcharged on my APR. Antoine in their financing department had a very similar attitude to the sales guy. He was a little happier to have a purchase but irritated when I didn't buy the upgrades and when I asked questions. I asked him about the tires as well and asked what would happen if the tires needed to be replaced within a month or two of buying the car. His reply was \"we don't do business like that\" implying that they would not sell a car with bad tires. \n\nWhile I was doing the paperwork, I was told the car being detailed. It was dark when we left the lot with the car and the next morning I discovered that they didn't detail the car at all. It appeared that they they just gave it a quick wipe down and vacuum. The back seat cup holder still had dried milkshake in it and the seat had some sort of mess. \n\nI brought the car back the next day and the customer service was horrible. When I walked in, an attendant in the lot took my keys and I ended up sitting in the waiting area for an hour and a half with no information or indication of what was going on with the car. I approached employees (including the sales guy, financing guy and receptionists) three times for information and got nothing. I had to specifically ask for my car back so i could leave after waiting for almost 2 hours. When I got the car back, they hadn't done anything to it. Nothing. I waited 2 hours for nothing. I threatened to talk to a manager and Mario finally set it up for me to bring the car back for a detail the next day and had someone drop me off and pick me up from work. Finally the car was clean.\n\nIf only that were the end... \nAbout 2 weeks after I got the car back they started calling me because they messed up and were missing some of the needed paperwork for my trade-in. I spoke to a client relations manager and thought that we had it resolved and paperwork was being mailed. They forgot to mail the paperwork and I ended up getting 3 calls from 3 different people between 9 am and noon about a week later demanding the paperwork they had never even sent. Finally the paperwork arrived and all was resolved. \n\nThen, about 3 months after I purchased the car I brought it back in for a complementary 30,000 mile service that comes with the warranty and was told that I needed 2 new front tires because they were no longer good. WTF. I really considered calling and complaining but ultimately decided it would have been a giant waste of time..\n\nMoral of the story: Don't waste your time with Camelback VW.

I took my car in and I was given quotes that were flat out lies. The first quote I asked for, after my car was checked, the person at the service desk flat out refused to give me a print out, like reputable dealers do. He wrote it out on a blank piece of paper and refused to be specific on exactly they found as possible issues and what they feel I needed. Never in my life have I experienced a dealership being evasive on what they looked at, what they found and what they feel you need.\n\nSince it was a dealership I gave them the benefit of the doubt (big mistake). After my car was fixed the quote that was written on the paper was nowhere near what I was being charged. When I said \"I asked for the exact quote including tax and you said this was it, what happened?\" all I got was \"I made a mistake\". \n\nThe second time I brought my car in the same quote thing happened but this time, I did receive an actual print out with a quote. When I asked \"will this be the exact price?\" I was told \"I think so\". The same thing happened as before in terms of the quote but this time my radio was not working after the work was done on my car.\n\nWhen I get home to tell them my radio was not working I was told to bring it back and they will look at it. When I arrived I was told \"how do we know the radio wasn't working when you brought it in?\". I told the service advisor \"well your guy turned the radio down when he got in my car because we BOTH heard it on when he turned on the car so obviously it was working\".\n\nI was then told \"well maybe you have a short or something but we don't know if it was working when you brought it in\". After us going back and forth on whether my radio wasn't working or not when I brought it in, the advisor then said they would check it and see if I had a shortness the radio.\n\nThey took me to the back and as they were testing my radio they commented \"umm you don't have a short, but maybe it's a bad radio\". When I told the tech \"no, my radio is fine\" I could see the anger in his eyes because I was holding them accountable for not doing proper work on my vehicle. Right then I knew they were liars and flat out dishonest. It's my fault for assuming the dealerships would be on the \"up and up\".\n\nAfter going back and forth with management on this, I was done trying to work with them. I hits decided to never go to them again.\n\nGo here if you want but understand they are liars and if anything goes wrong they are going to put the responsibility on the customer. If your radio, windshield wipers or anything else is not working properly after they repair your car and you can't prove that it was working properly before you brought it in, be prepared to spend money to get their mistakes fixed.....because you can't prove that it wasn't working when you brought it in.", "business_id": "MdDCaLarh1aWU9NfB6SQjA", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-09-10", "type": "review"}

I thought maybe I walked into the wrong buisness. So i'm standing around for a few minutes and in walks George Henderson from outside. He introduced himeself and informed me that he mainly worked over by the volkswagon building that is part of the whole mazda/suburu/volkswagon block of dealers. I told him what I wanted, a Mazda CX-5 Sport. He goes to find one for me to test drive. It took him awhile to come back, which honestly i was no too happy about. He told me that everytime he found the make/model/color/ i wanted they were all stick shifts. I understood and off we went. George was able to answer all my questions. He was a layed back kinda guy. I didn't feel pressured as i was talking to him about the vehicle. So we proceed to enter the shark tank. Anyone knows that dealing with the shark tank can be down right exhuasting. And it was! George was great to be honest, he made me feel comfortable even when i was starting to lose my patience with what i wanted. No one likes having to go back and forth to reach a deal. In the end I got the deal i wanted thanks to George and Rich. Frankie the GM was courteous but a little pushie and i could tell he had been doing this for a long time. I get that they have to make money but at the end of the day i'm the one signing the papers and giving my buisness. Frankie gave me his bottom number and i thanked him for his and George's time but was going to stand firm on what I wanted. I was sitting there thanking George for his time when Rich comes up from behind and has a figure circled and asked me if that will seal the deal, which it did. For all i know this could of been some kind of ploy of lets bombard the female until she caves or give her what she wants before she walks. Beats me, i just knew what i wanted and was not going to settle for less. And a huge SHOUT OUT to George Henderson who followed me in my rental car to drop it off and drive me back to the dealership so I didn't have to figure out how i was going to do that and get home at 8pm. George called me on 10/14 to see how i was doing. I told him the car was great but that i was having problems getting the NAV to work. He told me to come back to the store which i will be doing in a few days and he will correct the problem. No hassel. I will update this post if anything wonky occurs but I don't forsee that happening. Thank you again George, you are awesome and I would recommend dealing with you any day of the week to others looking for a new car.

When i went to test the battery it was dead and O'reillys said to me in their words when i told them it was supposedly new.\"Im sorry but you got screwed this battery is a couple years old.because the sides were warping\".

Walked in to see if they could replace the lenses on my favorite pair of sunglasses and was expecting to drop them off and have them shipped off to be repaired. That's what  others had told me because they were specialty lenses. Not the case at all. They had a variety of lenses in stock and were able to complete the process in 45 minutes and was only $45. The shop is full of cool designer frames and the staff is on point with customer service and their products.\nHighly recommend to anyone in need of glasses and wants to support our local businesses.  Thanks guys!!!", "business_id": "gztTQsgq6FJwIoV4P4RNIw", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-09-24", "type": "review"}
