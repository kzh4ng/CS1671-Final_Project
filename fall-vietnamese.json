The food isn't the best I've ever had, but its quality is consistently good, particularly for PIttsburgh.  This place would probably still get three stars in a town with a larger Vietnamese populatrion, and in the Burgh it deserves four.  It usually has a mixed crowd of Vietnamese patrons and non-Vietnamese.  This is the place I used to regularly turn to on non-Tuesday nights (they're closed) in mid-Feburary.\n\nUntil about three years ago, the broth was a little erratic.  Some days, it was quite flavorful and others watery.  Then, the in-laws showed up (I'm assuming from Vietnam), and the consistency and quality of the soup broth shot up.  The pho is significantly more flavorful than nearby (and only) competitor Tram's, and the family that runs it is much friendlier.\n\nFood highlights -\n    The pho is above average, particularly if you order it with beef raw (aka \"rare\") on the side.\n    The green papaya salad with dried beef (#12) is spicy and fabulous.\n    The fried spring rolls, both with shrimp and vegetarian, are excellent.\n    The shrimp and BBQ pork dish (#43) is one of my wife's favorites.\n\nFood cons - \n   The chicken pho is a bit meh.\n   The fresh spring rolls tend to have wrappers that are a bit too gummy and thick.  All I end up tasting is the roll, rather than the basil-sprout-crunch inside.\n   They always have omitted hot pepper slices from their tray of pho fixings, something I tend to enjoy.\n\nNotes - If you tend to like the raw beef in your pho, it's often kept in the freezer (for Dept. of Public Health concerns).  Then, it's often best to order the pho to go, heat it up to near-boiling on your stove, then serve it so that the broth is at a temperature high enough to cook it in your bowl, giving the broth a nice beefy cloud, as well.", "business_id": "uBW3PIKqc-_eyG1_vdJn1w", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-09-12", "type": "review"}

My first pho experience was at Lulu's Noodles in Oakland...  and it has set the bar.  Yeah, the noodles aren't quite right, and the broth is not quite right, either...  but...  the chicken is GREAT.  It's nice and tender.  \n\nSince then I had some pho in California and the broth is better...  the noodles are better...  but the chicken is weirdly dry and tough.  I don't know how chicken cooked in soup can be dry and tough, but it is.  \n\nIn that respect...  the pho at Pho Minh seemed quite authentic.  Noodles were good, broth was good - but chicken dry and tough.  Why does Lulu's have the market cornered on tender chicken in their pho???  \n\nMy son had the beef pho and the broth was SO much tastier than the chicken - the chicken was OK but it's the beef broth that is awesome.  \n\nMy biggest problem was I thought the portions seemed kinda small, for what you paid.  I guess they are adequate, but not super-satiating, for a pho crazed adult.  My plan was to share mine with my two toddlers, we tend to be light eaters, and it was kind of tense.  I expect a bowl of pho to be giant, based on my CA experiences.  I guess if we go again, the girls are going to have to get their own bowl to split.  \n\nI guess it is a credit to this place that my two picky toddlers liked it so much!\n\nDecent pho, portions kinda small, service REALLY slow.

Out of the 3 Vietnamese restaurants I have been to in Pittsburgh (this, Vietnam's Pho, and My Ngoc), this has the best pho. The broth is quite good; fragrant and savory. \nI both eaten in here and gotten take-out. Eating in is a pleasant experience. The dining room is tiny but spotless and bright, and the free pots of tea are a nice touch. The take-out pho is packaged very thoroughly and intelligently. In a plastic tub goes the broth, beef and onions. The noodles are packaged separately in a little plastic bag so they don't get soggy before you have a chance to eat. All the fixings, including copious amounts of basil and bean sprouts, are there, including little tubs of hoisin and chili sauce.\nDelicious, authentic pho prepared by a friendly family.

I probably order out from here 3-4 times a month. It is my 2nd most favorite Pho in Pittsburgh. I don't stray from my favorites dishes below, so I can't speak beyond what I will post. \n\nFor an appetizer, I order the Crispy Shrimp Rolls. Oh my! What little pieces of crispy, shrimp heaven. They are smaller shrimps, but the price is affordable so I don't mind. In my opinion what really drives this dish to excellence is the Vietnamese dipping sauce (nuoc cham). From what I learned about nuoc cham, every Vietnamese family has their own twist on it. The ingredients in nuoc cham are generally the same, but the proportions vary based on personal tastes and regions in Vietnam. According to Vietnamese cookbook author, Andrea Nguyen, \"as you move south the sauce gets sweeter, hotter, and more garlicky.\" YUMMY!\n\nI thoroughly enjoy the Pho Meatball entree. I LOVE fresh herbs and spices. Pho rice noddles served along side crunchy and light bean sprouts. Fresh cilantro and basil. I consider myself a Pho Meatball amateur connoisseur of sorts. I only order this dish, no matter where I eat Pho at. I like the way they slice the meatballs at this establishment unlike other places. It makes it easier to grab with the chopsticks =) Also they have less grisley pieces in this meatball Pho. I've never dissected them, but assume it is part tripe. The flavor is moderate with the slightest hint of kick. Also the lemongrass in the soup broth is so amazing. It is the epitome of Vietnamese comfort foods in my opinion. Coupled with the addition of Sriracha chile sauce and Hoisin sauce they include on the side is amazing. \n\nThe staff are polite and quick. One never waits long for your food. It is a little disappointing that they open for dinner so late. It would be nice to grab something right when I get off work versus waiting for 5pm to roll around. However, I cannot deny that it is most definitely worth the wait! Oh and like others have said, they are NOT OPEN on TUESDAYS. Odd, I know.\n\nThere are two things to be mindful of 1. If you are dining in- your portion size of Pho will be larger. This is not just at this Vietnamese place it is pretty much the norm for the other Vietnamese places around the PGH area. 2. Cash only. This last one is a major pain to me. I am not the cash and carry type of person.", "business_id": "uBW3PIKqc-_eyG1_vdJn1w", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-11-20", "type": "review"}

But since I drove 80 miles already I decided to give it a try. the menu was pretty small comparing to mecca of Asian food (Southern California). Ordered the Pho dac bet. When the pho came out, i thought it would be like the Southern California size as the bowl was decent size. But the pho and soup were sitting at the bottom of the bowl, about 1/3 full. I was a bit disappointed. I loaded up my bean sprouts into the hot soup and did a quick stir to cook the raw thinly slice steak. The pho was actually pretty decent.

Fans of Vietnamese food surely know Tram's by now, but those who haven't tried yet need to.  The menu offers appetizers, meat, seafood, and vegetarian options.  But there's no reason to order anything but the Pho.  There are many options, but keep it simple.  Pho real.  It's unbelievably tasty and filling.  One bowl will have you stuffed, but if you have a massive appetite, the spring rolls are also huge and delicious.  \n\nPrice: One person can gorge themselves with tip included for under $10.  The prices here are ridiculous considering the quality and quantity of the food being served.  If you're on a budget, this should be a regular stop.  It should be regardless.\n\nDrinks: the Thai iced tea is good, all regular drinks are offered, no booze\n\nAtmosphere: If Tram's was to be criticized in any way, surely this would be it. The dining room is almost but not quite dirty, and likely hasn't changed in 10+ years.  What some may see as a blemish others may view as character (me).  Hey it's Tram's Kitchen, and we're just eating there.  Wear a blindfold, you'll still taste the remarkable food.  Cash only.\n\nService: A waiter will be to your table with water before you even hit the seat, and another will be over for your order within 60 seconds.  Thats why you just order the pho.  There's no wasting time at Tram's.  Sit down, order, food comes quick, bill shortly after, eat, go home.\n\n(+): Tram's is a can't miss restaurant in Pittsburgh.

Personally, I don't see what is so special about it.  It's kind of a hole-in-the-wall kind of place, but the food is what I expected walking in.  Spring rolls are not flavorful and has too much minced meat and not enough of veggies for a good balance.  Also, I suspect they are the frozen variety and are not made in house.  Summer rolls are meh....  They're big, but again nothing special.  I've had the pho here and once again Pittsburgh disappoints me in the quality of pho that it has.  At Tram's, the pho bowl is small.  I don't expect a huge basin-size bowl, but a bowl of pho needs to have enough noodle, broth, herbs and spiced.  The meat is too overcooked for pho tai (pho with thinly sliced beef steak that is supposed to be cooked only when the boiling hot broth is poured in the bowl).  The taste is reminiscent of pho but isn't quite right.  You need to want to take your bowl and drink all the broth at the end of the meal and you should feel satisfied and be in a comatose state after a good bowl of pho.  This wasn't it.  \n\nThat said, the service is nice.  However, I didn't feel too comfortable/relaxed eating here.  It was dark and crowded (and a little bit dingy).

Everytime he calls me now he asks if I've had any pho lately. So, when I came back to the 'Burgh for a visit he was all about finding a Vietnamese place in the city to get some more. \n\nMy parents and I had spent the afternoon in the Strip District, and enjoyed a few beers at Roland's before heading over to Tram's for dinner. We were hungry and the portions were huge, tasty and the reasonably priced. We decided to get three different entrees and all share. Obviously, we got the pho with beef, the fresh spring rolls, a spicy/bbq shrimp plate that came with white rice, and a vermicelli bowl with pork. \n\nEverything was pretty tasty. The pho broth was a little salty for my preference, but it had a wonderful lemongrass aroma and taste. Also, usually I get fried or garlic rice with any rice dish I order from my favorite place in Cali, but the shrimp was very good and not at all over-coooked, as so many places do these days. The vermicelli dish was right on, and other than the fact that I prefer egg rolls to spring rolls, those were tasty as well, especially with the dipping sauce they provided.\n\nI'd give this place 3 and a half stars. It was, overall, a good dining experience and service was quick, despite the neighborhood being a little sketchy and the inside being a little divey. \n\nAlso, a personal comment. I firmly believe pho is a miracle cure for the cold/flu. Anytime I get sick I head over to my pho place and order a huge bowl with beef and then add plenty of Siracha sauce. I always wake up the next day feeling like a million bucks.  So, if you're feeling sick (especially around this time of year) try it out.

I will admit that I only tried the pho and a vermicelli bowl (on separate trips), but having ordered anything else on each of my trips would have put my bill in the neighborhood of $12+. Having grown up with cheap Vietnamese food in Texas, I wasn't prepared to spend that much for what's supposed to be a budget lunch, even with the understanding that I was going to leave hungry and that the lack of non-European ethnic diversity in Pittsburgh is going to automatically make things more expensive.\n\nEither way, I don't understand the hype surrounding this place. The pho bowl was small, with a tasteless broth and child-sized portions of noodles and meat. After a few bites, I drenched the whole thing in Sriracha just to give it some flavor and to try to trick my stomach into feeling a bit more like I had eaten something.\n\nThe vermicelli was not so great either--a small portion of vegetables and noodles with a few too-thick chunks of pork that were not grilled long enough for any sort of darkness or crisp (but which still managed to be dry). The color of the dish was as bland as the taste.\n\nAs for the atmosphere, not a big deal for me. The restaurant is small, with minimal seating and some dinginess to it, but that's fairly common for older Vietnamese restaurants. Most diners are young, hip, and not Asian (which could be a turn-off for some due to the perceived lack of authenticity and/or hipsteriness). Parking is a chore; if you live nearby and choose to give the place a try, walk or ride your bike, or prepare to find yourself circling nearby blocks of permit-only parking.\n\nFolks who dine at Tram's should keep in mind that cheaper, better, more authentic Vietnamese food exists out there. I grew up in North Texas (Dallas-Fort Worth area), where with one of the largest Vietnamese populations in the country, good, cheap Vietnamese food can be found all over the metro area. Pho portions down there are reasonably big, there are plenty of different meat combinations, and you can almost always choose the size of the bowl you want (usually kid's, small, large, and extra-large). Additionally, due to the presence of plenty of fresh ingredient suppliers and competition, prices are more in line with portion size, and the food is, more often than not, good. Most folks with normal appetites are able to leave satisfied having spent no more than $7 or $8 a person with tax and tip (compared to $20 at Tram's). Out of all the Vietnamese spots in North Texas that I've tried, my absolute favorite is Pho Pasteur, in Arlington: The pho, vermicelli bowls, crushed rice dishes, spring and egg rolls, and prices are all excellent. Tram's would be put out of business if anyone ever opened a restaurant like that up here.\n\nIf none of the other few choices in Pittsburgh are satisfying your Vietnamese food cravings, it might be worth it to take a weekend trip up to Toronto. You would also have access there to some other Asian foods that we don't have here, such as dim sum and Taiwanese \"small eats.\" For a slightly shorter drive, you can also find these things (though more sparsely) in the D.C. suburbs.", "business_id": "dxCqGkhtXq-9fYEsX7Mf6Q", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-10-15", "type": "review"}

It's cash only, but the day I was here the atm wasn't working and staff wasn't too empathetic or helpful for customers who had trouble with it. The staff was very helpful and knowledgable but serious and down-to-business, and not one of them ever acknowledged  a \"thank you\" from any customer during the entire time we were at the restaurant.

Perfect to grab a bite before a movie - OR, if you are like my fiance and I, perfect to grab a few beers at BWW and then head to Tea Light Cafe for some REAL food.  \n\nFor all the positives of the location comes anegative.  The menu is a bit toned down and you're not going to find the ultra authentic foods here (no tripe or tendon!).  North Scottsdale isn't quite ready for that.  What you will find is a small menu with all of the essentials you need.  A fantastic minimalist approach - offer a smaller menu but offer everything on the menu to the level of perfection.\n\nLike clockwork the super friendly owners and employees know our order.  Beef and Beefball Pho Noodle Soup for me, Vietnamese Pork and Vermicelli Noodles for my fiance, and of course an order of super fresh, light, cool spring rolls to start.  Perfect to combat the heat.  Oh - and a cup for ice tea - because they have some of the most amazing ice tea brews.  Soo refreshing and flavorful you don't even need sugar!\n\nif you decide to split the Pho I believe they charge you a split fee.  But because we always order two entrees - they bring out a small bowl so my fiance and I can share (the portions are huge and there's no way I could finish a whole bowl).  A wonderful, fresh, huge meal for about $20.00!  And let me tell you - nothing beats a hangover like a huge bowl of Pho Noodle Soup (doused in Chili Paste and the Rooster of course!).\n\nAlthough I've never had the Banh I have friends who have ordered it and loved it!\n\nThe one other thing I suggest is to eat at the restaurant.

This little gem serves up traditional Vietnamese cuisine on the North side of Scottsdale, which was rare back in the early 2000s when I moved to Phoenix. Vietnamese food was hard to find back then, but now it's starting to pop up everywhere since Pho is fast becoming a popular dish.\n\nWhen I first visited this joint back in the early 2000s, they had their Pho called beef Noodle Soup instead. I gather it was a way to better explain to the public what Pho really was. Now it's back to Pho and it taste much better too! Yah! Aside from Pho, Tea Lite Caf\u00e9 serves up some of my classic favorites Bun Mi sandiwhced, vermicelli bowls, and steam rice plates. Voted best sandwich by Phoenix Magazine back in 2010, their specialty sandwiches, also know as Bun Mi, will not disappoint.\n\nMoreover, it is not to imply the rest of their dishes will disappoint, cause I definitely recommend their vermicelli bowls with your choice of meats; beef, chicken, or pork. Also known as, Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio, it comes along with egg rolls and served a top of fresh carrots, cucumbers, bean sprouts and cilantros. One thing I love about Vietnamese cuisine is the utilization of fresh vegetables and seasonings like cilantro giving it a distinctive scent. Vietnam is heavily Buddhist thus having a strong vegetarian background and the usage of vegetables along with their cuisine.\n\nI'm not sure who the Chef is, but she seemed very friendly and came out to speak to the patrons. Some of the regulars seem to enjoy her company a lot. The waiter was very stiff and seemed like he was mad all the time - reminded me of my dad haha! (Sorry pops!) The place itself is cute and tiny.

The broth had a lovely ginger taste and was nicely salty. I can see the broth potentially being too salty for some, but it was perfect at the time.\n-They separated the broth from the noodles/veggies in their own containers for takeout, which was very helpful for preserving the taste and quality of the pho.\n-They were generous on the green onion and cilantro, which are my favorite veggie add-ins to asian soups.\n-They seem to have some very interesting tea choices and tea-ware, like teapots and cups. Since we were getting takeout, we didn't try these options. There are several glass canisters of interesting looking teas to the left of the registers and if you so decide to try this place, I would give some of those teas a taste.\n\nCons:\n-A more expensive than other pho places with arguably competitive quality. Our total for 2 veggie phos and 2 boba drinks was a little under $27. However, it does seem to be pretty far from other cheaper and high quality alternatives (like the ones you  find near asian markets), so the price may just reflect the lack of neighboring competitors in this area.\n-The veggie pho option pretty much only came with tofu, regular onion, green onion, and cilantro, excluding your usual bean sprouts, mint, jalapeno that seem to come with every order of pho at most places. At other restaurants, they may include other veggies like broccoli, carrots, and peas or whatnot. It's not a big deal for me, because the pho was still delicious, but I think the price should be lower to reflect the scant ingredients? The veggie pho at the other aforementioned place was about $5-$6. \n-The boba was very meh. The smoothie flavors tasted exactly like the fake-tasting powders you can buy at LeeLees and the boba was a little too rigid. The chewiness was still pretty good. Not the worst boba I had, but far from the best.\n\nVerdict:\nI won't be coming back, mostly because this was an impromptu take out adventure on our way out of town for a road trip and there's no way this place is convenient for us to stop by again, but even if I was overcome with the desire to eat pho, I would go to places with cheaper, better pho and better boba. I'm not giving it a terrible review though because all I got was take out one time. Don't get me wrong, if you just don't have any other closer options for pho and don't mind paying the higher than average price, then this is a solid choice.", "business_id": "L_MtTn4IUBTmQtqqM2iFqA", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-09-27", "type": "review"}

They somehow figure out what you ordered. Interesting. \n\nI ordered the Spring rolls to start it off. They looked really good. The rolls were pretty good. There was a lot of vegetables and shrimp. When you put the roll in that peanut dipping sauce, oh my goodness. Really enjoyed it soaking it in that dipping sauce. \n\nI ordered the Beef and Egg Roll. What a meal. Grilled beef, noodles, salad, and egg roll. Loved it all. They give you this sauce to dump all over it and it really brought out the taste. Nice tender beef. Nice salad. Really enjoyed the egg roll. Surprisingly, I enjoyed the egg roll more than the spring rolls. This was a really filling lunch and really good. \n\nMy wife ordered the Chicken Pho. She really liked it. Got to try the chicken. Thinly cut chicken and it was pretty good. My wife was able to finish up her Pho. Only issue was it had a little to much MSG. Little thirsty afterwards. \n\nSo the service was amazingly pretty fast. Our spring rolls came out really fast. This older Asian man rolled out the rolls on a carts and knew which tables ordered spring rolls. Impressive. All the food came out fast on this cart and the tables were cleaned up pretty fast. Tables were turning over pretty fast. \n\nSo I couldn't ask for anything more. Good food, fast service, and big portions. We really enjoyed it and will be coming back again. Enjoy.", "business_id": "L_MtTn4IUBTmQtqqM2iFqA", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-10-31", "type": "review"}

The water was refilled expeditiously.\n\nWhile it didn't smell as fragrant as Pho Nhan did when I entered, it did smell good.  \n\nI saw a mix of Asians and others (including one not-too-polite redneck farmer who talked way too loud on his cell phone at the table) but enough of the former to feel this was a popular place for Vietnamese.  I wouldn't trust a pho place full of only white people.  Scary thought.\n\nThe eggrolls were delicious!  They were more garlicky than ones I've had in the past and it was that kind of garlic that you keep taking bites of and wanting more of.  The veggies were fresh and crisp, the shell was crisp and delicately flaky, the dipping sauce was perfect.  I could have eaten a whole meal of just these.  \n\nThe bad:\nAfter being seated and provided water and menu I was summarily ignored for at least 15 minutes.  THIS I'm not used to.  Someone else would have left.  The waiter was sitting a a table in full view of me about four tables away and purposely did not make eye contact or walk by, much less come to my table.  What's the problem, Dude??\n\nWell, you know what, I can usually out-stubborn anybody, though thankfully don't often need to, so I decided to sit there till Hell froze over.  Eventually an older man came out to bring another table their food.  He saw me sitting there, hands politely folded on menu, smile on my face, obviously ready to order, snapped some orders at the younger guy, who then came over to take my order at long last.  I got the aforementioned eggrolls and a bowl of soup that included duck leg and bamboo.  My phone died before I could take a photo of the menu as I sometimes do to remember the name of the dish.  The guy checked with me if I wanted the one with bamboo and I said yes, but my antennae went up.  As he was leaving the table he hesitated and asked, \"You work over there?\" Pointing to the west.  I told him no, I was visiting from San Diego because I had a new granddaughter.  He brightened up at that and was perfectly nice after, so I can only guess he thought I was someone else initially, someone not worthy of his attention.  Working where?\n\nAfter eating the delectable egg rolls and being extremely impressed, the large bowl of soup arrived and emitted such a putrid smell I didn't know if it was from the person serving it or the dish itself.  It honestly smelled like someone had pooped in it, or in their pants nearby.  I told myself not to let my imagination run wild, thinking of stories describing slaves who defecated in their owners food, ewww. I had gone through so much to get it that I didn't want to send it back.  As I took bites and spoonfuls I pretty much narrowed it down to the bamboo being the culprit causing the bad smell and taste.  And it was not inedible, just took some getting used to.  I kept telling myself I probably had just never eaten bamboo before and maybe it's an acquired taste like Limburger(sp?) cheese, or liver.  Whatever, I ate it and while I barely made it to my motel bathroom after leaving the restaurant (don't ask), I had no further  gastronomic problems from the food, and that could have been caused by eating exotic food after having nothing to eat all day.  If the food had been \"bad\" I'm sure I would have reacted to it during the night or next day.\n\nI'm trying to talk myself into giving them three stars because those egg rolls were so good but the more I remember sitting there being purposely ignored, the more I acknowledge how impolite and unprofessional that was so I'm going to make it two stars.  Sorry guys, next time tend to your customers.

My oldest daughter and I decided on Saigon Pho because we were in the mood for something different.  \n\nI was not impressed with the atmosphere here.  It was pretty run-down looking.  But I'll overlook that if the prices are good and the food is enjoyable.  They seem to operate with server by committee here, with any of 3-4 different women checking on us every 3-4 minutes.  One of them has personal space issues.  Her first stop at the table she placed both palms on the table, leaned way too far in, flashed a disconcertingly toothy smile and said \"Hi\" loudly through aforementioned smile.  My first inclination was to lean away as she might go Mike Tyson on my ear or something.\n\nWe ordered an appetizer of Vietnamese shrimp and vegetable rolls.  They were served with a dish of hoison sauce for dipping.  The rolls were large and filled with lettuce, vermicelli noodles, bean sprouts, 2 shrimp sliced lengthwise and a couple mint leaves.  This all combined to produce an interesting flavor combination but they were unremarkable overall.\n\nWe also shared seafood rice soup which was served in a large portion.  I'm pretty sure the rice had been blended and it was very small bits and the overall consistency was similar to runny grits.    It had a distinct hint of ginger.  There were a couple shrimp, several bites of squid and several bites of crab.  I'm not positive it was crab.  At first I thought it was \"Krab\" but I wasn't completely sure.   They do have tanks here with live crab and lobster so you would hope they are not going the \"krab\" route.\n\nLastly we shared a chicken teriyaki over rice.  The chicken was a little overdone but had a nice roasted flavor.  The teriyaki had the requisite sweetness that always works for the kids and thankfully they did not bludgeon the dish with excess sauce.\n\nThe final analysis:  reasonable prices, reasonable food.", "business_id": "jJlOPkv4Xl6vxNzr51fnYw", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-10-22", "type": "review"}

I've been dining here for nearly two years now and love this restaurant dearly. My boyfriend and I dine here two to three times a week. The food and service continues to bring us back, and our love for Vietnamese food continues to grow! I've practically have had just about almost everything on the menu and have not found many items I did not like. \n\nThe beef salad is amazing... to die for! It is served with your side of white rice, with  lemon salt and pepper dipping sauce. Believe me, it is fantastic! You will fall in love and come back for more. Not forgetting your traditional Pho, something that is a must have and try! You cannot go to Saigon Pho and not have Pho... rice noodle soup with beef and beef balls, served with sprouts, lime, and basil leaves. There are sauces to add to enhance the flavor. Once everything is added, you indulge!  \n\nSome of my other favorite dishes are; the special crab, clams with basil, and steam flounder.  They cost a bit more if you don't mind splurging a tad to enjoy the taste of how each item is well put together. These items are normally shared-so for the price, it is worth feeding at least two people. \n\nBeside for the seafood items, everything else on the menu is affordable and decently priced. Nothing is overly priced for the amount of food served. The servers are extremely friendly, quick and nice... I've gotten to know almost every single one of them to the point where it is a little embarrassing when I walk in and they say, \"Wow.... you come here again?!\"  There are never any long waits and most of the time, we are sat right away. They come by so often to check on you... So basically it is impossible for your drink to be half empty. Good deal, eh?! I have and will continue to enjoy this restaurant. So if and ever you are in Chandler, Arizona make a quick stop here and give yourself a decent meal you won't forget!", "business_id": "jJlOPkv4Xl6vxNzr51fnYw", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-09-14", "type": "review"}

Greasy but excellent dish.  Kind of reminded me of Mongolian beef over noodles.   Fun indeed.\n\nSpicy Beef w/ Rice Noodles - Probably my favorite of the soups I tried.  This had a little bit more going on that just broth and noodles.  Good enough that at some point, I will crave a bowl and be back for it.\n\nFreshly Sliced Beef Pho - This was what I expected.  A kind of nicely flavored beef broth soup.  A little bland for me, but my kids LOVED it.\n\nPork Bun (pork and egg rolls on cold vermicelli noodles) - I was most surprised by this one.  Cold noodles and fish sauce makes me say \"meh,\" but I really liked this dish.  Fish sauce and all.  Actually the sauce probably made the dish.\n\nAs everyone else has said, the places is pretty cheap.  Unlike everyone else... you can keep the darn spring rolls.  Egg roll... awesome.

They are too soft and mushy which really put a dent into my enjoyment.

I noticed a reviewer noted the price was higher than expected, but I sense the reviewer is not familiar with the finer details of the dishes which foodies won't mind paying for at a restaurant.  For example, you can order a bowl of pho at any VN restaurant, but they often only give you basil instead of the other fragrant herbs that should accompany a bowl of pho.   At Cyclo, they don't cut corners so the dishes come out complete with the love and attention as if you are family. I have to admit, my favorite dish there is the crepe. It's perfectly prepared so that the edges are crispy and the crepe itself is not doughy. But what separate it from other crepes is that Cyclo correctly includes all the fresh herbs that should accompany this dish. Most restaurants just give you some cilantro and lettuce to go with the crepe, but Cyclo gives you the complete experience!  It's analogous to eating mushroom risotto at an Italian restaurant with a shaving of aromatic truffle vs just a shake of pepper on top.  It's all in the details!  I enjoy the food so much I have been stopping by there for dinner when ever I am in town on business. My friends can't believe it because I generally tend to prefer restaurants with a 10 course tasting menu where I can linger for 2-3 hours each night enjoying my dinner.  The quality of the food at Cyclo must be good or I wouldn't be wasting my time there.  Besides, if you are trying to get the best bang for your dollar, this is definitely the place to eat.  The quality exceeds the price here.  I am trying to make my way down the menu and so far I have not been disappointed.  But my favorites are the crepes, the short rib appetizer, goi cuon (summer rolls), lemongrass chicken, and stir-fried string beans. The latter is full of flavor and your taste buds will appreciate it. \n\nGenerally, I don't order desserts at Vietnamese restaurants, but I always finish my dinner here with one of the house made desserts.  Cr\u00e8me Brulee was the correct texture which is important to me.  I typically won't order tapioca dessert because I think they are boring, but I was making my way down the menu so I took their suggestion and ordered it last time.  I am happy to report the tapioca dessert here was a few notches above the usual tapioca dessert so I will order it again next time. When in season, you can also order mango and sticky rice for dessert.  Yes, I have tried them all and can vouch for them.  Oh, one warning though: the at-your-table drip-coffee is very addictive and very strong.  It really rounds out the meal nicely but you will be up for a while with that boost of caffeine!  Incidentally, the best part of Cyclo is not just the food, but the warm service with a smile.  All must come together to create the perfect meal!  Cyclo is now a gem in my back-pocket.  I look forward to my next business trip to AZ so I can stop by again!", "business_id": "UIGFrEcoDsw05I1UOrxdOA", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-11-09", "type": "review"}

Justina's is all about personalized service, oh, and a rough journey from North Vietnam to Los Angeles, by way of Hong Kong.  Some people may not like her or her style.  I thought she was funny and worked hard to live up to her claim that her food has a secret ingredient, love.  I tasted another ingredient, fun.\n\nI'm not Vietnamese, but I have a story about tonight.  I met a good friend of mine while here on business who had worked with a lady in Tucson who recommended her cousin Justina's restaurant in Phoenix.  When we told our server of this recommendation, the menu was snatched away and we were given \"owner's choice\".  Not bad.\n\nThe Green Papaya salad was excellent, the heat tempered nicely with the Thai Iced Tea.   The shrimp on the side of the salad was also very tasty.\n\nThe Pork Short Ribs were next.  They were very tender with a subtle BBQ sauce, slightly sweet and all good.\n\nA beef or pork (not sure) and rice dish came next and it was also very good.  The meat was tender and again, subtly spiced.  Not hot though.\n\nThe main dish, a mix of vegetables, scallop, shrimp and beef was less impressive.  \n\nFinally, the dessert (not something I usually do) was excellent.  As another reviewer pointed out, they are a little known sensation.  I had the creme brulee (jasmine? not sure, but very, very good) and the mango with sticky rice (covered with coconut milk).  The Vietnamese coffee was also very good.  It is allowed to drip at the table, mixed with the sweetened cream in the bottom of the glass, then poured over ice.  It's strong and full of flavor.  I may be up all night.\n\nOh, and as for price, this all came in at $58 for both of us.  I don't know if this is reasonable, high or cheap.  It ain't bad in general.  Those of you who do Vietnamese often will have make the call.\n\nI'm not in Phoenix often, but I will return to try some of the other menu items (Pho and other noodles for sure).", "business_id": "UIGFrEcoDsw05I1UOrxdOA", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-11-11", "type": "review"}

I guess you can say it doesn't sound very nice to say, but the food here is my favorite Vietnamese cuisine. I'm not a huge fan of the pho but I'm a very big fan of their vermicelli noodle bowls! It's the perfect amount of food for someone with a middle sized appetite. They're open late night so if you're out on the strip with your friends or are looking for a late night snack (hardly the size for a snack), Mr. Pho Kim Long is your best bet to satisfy your Vietnamese craving.\n\nThe service isn't super because of the lack of personality their staff has but they bring your food out fairly quick. Does one base service on how quick you get to eat or how pleasant they make your visit? I say it depends on both but lucky for Pho Kim Long, their service is very fast and consistent.  It wouldn't hurt the staff to crack a smile or two, crack a joke, or laugh even. They don't have a problem splitting your checks as long as they get their money.  The atmosphere is very traditionally Asian and being of Asian descent, it doesn't do much for me.  In other words, you wont catch me with my iPhone in hand snapping shots like some tourist or something. Maybe, the food for Yelp but that's all ;)\n\nNever had a problem customer service-wise, always accommodated the big groups of friends I go everywhere with, and doesn't take log to bring what you ask for. That's a big thing for me when the server takes the detour to bring you something you've asked for. And having to ask for it twice really peeves me but as busy and as impersonable as their staff is, they go and get what you ask for right away. Maybe to get you to go faster? If I wanted to be In -n- Out of a joint, I'd go get a burger! Hahaha!
