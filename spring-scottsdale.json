I actually wanted to get my hazelnut royale fix, but balked at the price tag- $6 a piece!  After a few minutes, the male owner talked me into trying the croissant.  After he heated it up in the microwave, he charged me $8, plus tax, which I felt was too much, esp. for a croissant that is almost a day old.  I wished it was more crispy, but since it was microwaved, the bottom was very soggy, and only the very top layers were slightly crispy.  After a few bites, I perused through tthe take-out menu and couldn't find the croissant under the dinner menu; Instead, I found it under the breakfast menu- $5.95 with white sauce, and $6.55 with scrambled eggs.  So I was charged $8 for a plain ham and cheese croissant that was a breakfast leftover??  \n\nI left very disappointed with my dinner selection that day, and with ever-increasing prices, I won't be coming back soon, if ever.", "business_id": "wftoNIA0Q8nX-Da47psBCA", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-05-19", "type": "review"}

I had been wanting to check it out for a while since it is just down the street from my office.  The reviews saying it was expensive kept me away but now after seeing the menu I don't think it so bad compared to other places in the area.  You really can't get a lunch for less than $10 anywhere in Old Town Scottsdale unless you do fast food or the food court in the mall.  I thought the place was decorated super cute and with a nice relaxing atmosphere and the staff was very friendly.\n\nBut the food was just kind of average.  I had a 1/2 panini and soup and they both pretty much tasted like something I could make at home.  I also took home a couple of pastries (now those are way overpriced, I agree) that also were not too impressive.  I will definitely give them another try just since they are so close.  Hopefully some of their other menu items will be better.  They did have great smelling cappuccinos so I may try to sneak out some time for a mid-morning coffee and croissant.\n\nI think this is a cute little French cafe to stop by for a quick lunch if you are in the area but I would definitely agree with Suzanne S. that it is not a destination restaurant at all.

The staging site near 4 Peaks was easy to find and the company provided all the gear we'd need-- helmets, goggles, water, confidence, you name it. Luckily it had just rained the night before so instead of dust flying everywhere, we got splashed with mud. I'd rather get muddy and have some great views of the Valley sans pollution than ride through a constant cloud of dust, a la Pigpen.\n\nThe guide was super experienced and he let some of the faster riders up towards the front and the slower riders in the back so people could go at their own pace. We of course managed to get squashed in the middle behind a couple who couldn't decide whether they wanted to be speed racers or terrified school girls. That kinda put the kibosh on us really letting loose, but we still managed to pick up some speed along the way and really enjoy the trail. Since we weren't allowed to bring anything with us, the guide provided water and even took our pictures so we could download them later. \n\nAll in all, I'd definitely recommend Stellar Adventures if you're looking for a little half-day trip or want to treat some out-of-town guests.

End of review.  Actually, let me give you an example of a recent wine dinner.. (I saved the menu)\n\nThe vineyard represented at this dinner was Mastroberardino, one of the oldest winemaking firms in Campania, Italy (birthplace of Marcellino!).  \n\nCourse 1:  Carpaccio di Cervo all Menta, paired with Falanghina.  This was a fabulous start to the dinner, one of the oldest of the ancient varietals of wine, served with a carpaccio of venison.  Fantastic!  Of course the carpaccio was served over locally sourced arugula (grown by the chef himself)...delicious.  \n\nCourse 2: Grilled Scallops and Calamari.  Forget deep fried calamari, grilled is the way to go.  Simple and perfectly cooked.  Paired with a nice acidic Greco di Tufo.  This is what you'd have on the coast of Italy.  Buonissimo.\n\nCourse 3:  Branzino ripieno con Tortufi paired with Fiano di Avellino.  I can't think of anywhere in the world where you'd get a such a nice fish paired with a butter and truffle sauce (and truffles inside the rolled filet).  Fantastic!  And Fiano was the perfect complement to the fish.\n\nCourse 4:  Duo - Lasagnetta ai Funghi misti & Cavetelli al Ragu d'Agnello.  I've never had a Lasagna at Marcellino but his sauce paired with the mixed mushroom Lasagna was fantastic.  And the Cavetelli was my absolute favorite with the lamb ragu.  This was paired with a terrific Aglianico (the first red wine of the evening).  So many flavors that match so well.  The chef clearly knows how to pair his wines with his food.  \n\nCourse 5:  Stracotto di Cinghiale con Polenta.  This dish seems simple, a wild boar over a polenta.  But the subtle beautiful flavors made for a home style or country farm kind of dish that you'll not soon forget - and will wish for more.  This was served with an incredible Taurasi \"Radici\" red wine.\n\nThis is as good as it gets.  An expertly prepared multi course dinner paired with fantastic ancient wines from one of the oldest vineyards in italy.  \n\nThe service was top notch, the presentation unfailing.  The food absolute and the wine amazing!\n\nThank you Marcellino and Sima, and also Dario from Classico Wines, you put together yet another beautiful evening - we always leave impressed and perfectly sated.", "business_id": "MLVKDbuI2xaOJQ4-NZj2MQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-03-01", "type": "review"}

A delicious start and we had barely opened the menu.\n\nWe shared the Gamberi e Feta antipasti.  Two HUGE jumbo shrimp (I didn't think the word jumbo really did those bad boys justice) grilled perfectly...tender and juicy.  They were served on a square of lightly fried feta cheese and a bed of cabbage.  The arrangement was so nice that I didn't want to disturb it.\n\nAfter that we shared 2 entrees:\n\nThe Fagottino di Pollo and the Salmone in Crosta di Porcini con Cognac e Porri.  I am not a big fan of salmon but I could become a fan of this salmon.  Flaky, delicious fillet with a wonderful cognac sauce.  I was less thrilled with the chicken.  It was split chicken breasts layered with proscuitto and fontina cheese and smothered in a brown sauce.\n\nHere's the thing about the Fagottino di Pollo.  When I say I was less thrilled I mean it was 4 star chicken.  Everything else about the food and service was 5 stars.  Flat out.  \n\nWe shared a couple desserts - a tirimisu and a dark chocolate mousse.  The tirimisu had all the right flavors working - mascarpone cheese, chocolate, espresso, rum, lady fingers.  Delicious.  The mousse was also very good.  Dangerously good.\n\nAlong the way we had a very well rounded chianti ( Chianti \"I Sodi\", Badia Morrona ) and a very nice white ( Albana \"Colle Del Re\" ).

I was told that they could take our group at 6:45 and that they'd have a live Opera Singer (specifically a Tenor) in house that night performing - what a treat!  Well - that's what I figured when they told me that.  (None of us were opera fans before and we still are not opera fans, but it did add to the experience!)\n\nWe were seated right away and Scott was our server.  He was attentive and patient with us, even when Jared had him repeat the specials several times.  Their homemade pasta specials looked incredible, but I stayed away... Instead, I enjoyed the Insalata Ortolana, a few bites of the Canestina Polenta (if you like polenta and you like mushrooms, get this - it's incredible), and I shared the Gamberi Affogtai entree with my mother-in-law-to-be.  We requested extra veggies instead of mashed potatoes and not only did they oblige, but the broccoli, cabbage, and asparagus we received were delicious!  The shrimp were magnificent as well - juicy and tender!  Oh - I have to also admit to having some of the 'special sauce' they serve with the bread basket... it is tangy and wonderful - if you go, you must try that too.  It's made with eggplant, olive oil, and red pepper I believe... yum!\n\nJared and his sister had a Caprese Salad (a bit overpriced at $12.95), the Paccatelli al Ragu (a bolognese pasta dish I believe), the Scaloppine al Gorganzola (a veal dish that he enjoyed but serving size was not as big as he'd wished for).  We finished off the meal with an Apple Galetta served with hazelnut gelato and a Panna Cotta (similar to flan).  While I had just a small taste of the apple one, I can report that it was delicious... and since Jared and his mom finished off the panna cotta, i'll assume it was not so bad either.\n\nAll of the above plus a pellegrino, a coffee, and a cappuccino for $159.85 before tip.

I had such a hankering for Italian food, and Marcellino's treated me far beyond expectations. Growing up right outside of Boston, I went to the North End (Boston's Little Italy) quite a bit for authentic Italian food. I was skeptical as to what an Scottsdale authentic Italian restaurant would be. My first impression of Marcellino's was superb. A very somber and intimate setting. And listening to live entertainment. Already I was impressed. \nFor the life of me I cannot remember my servers name and I that's a let down because he was superb!! He made me and my company's night all the more enjoyable with his personality and his knowledge of the menu. What happened next was something that I have never seen before and it really added a class act to my experience here. He came to our table with a plate full of the pastas that were made for the day, with a detailed explanation of each type. Very impressive. He also went over each special of the night in great detail, leaving me with no questions to ask him. \nAfter several minutes of glaring at the menu, and thinking about the dinner specials offered, I went with the dinner special of Lamb Ragu over Pappardelle.  My counterpart ordered their Fettuccine Contadina from their Handmade Pasta selection. After several more minutes of conversation and eating bread with a roasted red pepper spread, which was to die for, our meals came to us piping hot, and smelling of ecstasy. \nMy first bite, I was in love! This was incredibly good. The pasta was cooked perfectly Al dente, and who does not love freshly made pasta?! My Lamb Ragu was divine. I could have eaten about three plates of this dish myself, it was that good. My friends dish was also superb. Again freshly made pasta, with top quality produce, not overly done, which is the Italian way. Keep it simple. Although I didn't get a chance to have dessert, because I was stuffed from bread and pasta, I did see several desserts trailing through the dining room. They all looked to die for. \nMarcellino's totally exceeded my expectations for authentic Italian food. I see too many Italian restaurants which typically serve all the same items, i.e. Chicken, Veal, Eggplant Parmesans, and Marsalas, but Marcellino's didn't offer these which was a sigh of relief, and makes me intrigued on going back and trying the other delights that they offer. \nI would say that this place would be more suited for a date atmosphere than for big groups. It has a sexy, intimate vibe to it. Feel free to disagree with me on that. With all that being said, I will be back again, REAL soon!

My wife and I made a trip to Scottsdale to enjoy some warm weather and down time this spring. We wanted a good meal for our last night and were encouraged to read some of the reviews of this place. Owned by Italians, homemade pastas -- sounded right up our alley. Unfortunately, we were significantly disappointed. We both had pasta specials (I had the parpadelle w/ lamb ragu and she had the squid ink pasta w/ half a lobster, clams and mussels). I'm not one to complain about prices but I do have a problem with places charging big prices only to severely miss the mark on flavor. The parpadelle and squid ink pasta were $40 and $50 respectively. The parpadelle is a dish that even the swankiest restaurants in NYC charge $20 at most for. The squid ink claimed to have \"1/2 of a whole lobster\" but we could only find a few bits of overcooked tail in it. Skimping on the lobster left a terrible impression with me and led me to believe that they're pulling a fast one on us. This feeling was further validated after the waiter came by to inform us that he asked the chef to remove the meat from the shell so \"the lady wouldn't have to get her hands dirty.\" When the dish came, we were shocked when we didn't find an ounce of claw meat in the dish. \n\nFinally, but most importantly, the flavor. The parpadelle was decent but the \"fresh, homemade pasta\" was way too thick. About twice the thickness that I've ever eaten (in even the crappiest of places). The thickness of the pasta coupled with the fact that it did not seem like they ever finished the noodles in the sauce left both dishes very unbalanced. Heavy on the pasta -- even though they had a heavy handed approach to the sauce.\n\nAside from the pastas, we had the cheesecake and gelato - both of which were more disappointing than the pastas. \n\nThe cherry on the top? The cheesy lounge singing performer at dinner. Really? Am I in a vegas lounge? Save the money and your palette. I'm sure there are other excellent places in Scottsdale -- I was only hoping Marcellino's was one of them. Unfortunately, it wasn't and the only folks benefitting are the owners that should be ashamed of the dishes they're putting out there.", "business_id": "MLVKDbuI2xaOJQ4-NZj2MQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-03-11", "type": "review"}

Our bartender, Lou, took the time to get to know my name and made sure that my glass of wine was always full. It is evident that he truly cares about his customers and his restaurant.\n\nFor dinner, we started with the Imported Buffalo Mozzarella & Prosciutto appetizer. It was a generous portion and was wonderful. The ingredients are always fresh and it was the perfect way to start off our meal. (I'd say this is perfect for two people to share, unless you are really hungry!)\n\nMy boyfriend had the Santa Lucia for his main entree. It was delicious- And yes, he was generous enough to share. It is a \"Black cuttle fish ink infused fettuccine saut\u00e9ed with muscles, clams and calamari in a lightly spiced tomato sauce and topped with half of a 1 1/2 pound fresh Maine lobster.\" (I took this off their website because I decided my description could not do it justice.) It was an absolutely incredible dish- One not to be missed!\n\nMy dish was fairly similar to the Santa Lucia but not as big. Unfortunately the name is escaping me at the moment but it is a spicy tomato sauce with shrimp, fresh fish and calamari. It is phenomenal and worth every carb ;)\n\nOur servers were both Rob & Johnny. They provided outstanding guest service! Oh and since it was a Saturday night, there was live entertainment. Some might consider the entertainer to be a \"cheesy lounge singer\" but I thought he was really good and put some romance (and laughs) in to our evening... Watching my boyfriend imitate and sing \"At Last\" to me was priceless. \n\nOverall, if you are looking for an authentic Italian dinner with incredible service and owners that really care about their restaurant, I'd say come to Marcellino Ristorante!

While it was not noted on the restaurant week website or the restaurant's website, your entire party had to order either from the restaurant week menu or the normal menu, no exceptions. We tried to protest this because there was nothing about this on the websites, but the hostess said that it was their first restaurant week and that the chef did not want to make any accommodations. While the food was good, the waitstaff was very rude an unattentive. Our waitress explained their pasta specialties very quickly and then said she would come back for our order. When she came back we said that we would all order off the normal menu and asked if she could repeat the specialties because we were a bit overwhelmed by the menu choices. She was not happy about it but she repeated them and then took our orders. The food came out within 10 minutes piping hot, which was nice but the waitress did not warm us that the plates were hot and my mother unfortunately burned her hand. We were never brought bread, and had to ask for it after we already received our meals. It came with some sort of chilled red spread that was never explained. We asked after the end of the meal and the waitress said it was an eggplant and sundried tomato mix. While we said that we were celebrating a birthday the waitress said that they did not do anything complementary but that they would do a nice presentation of a dessert if we wanted one. We said no thank you but she brought us a nice free biscotti plate that said \"happy birthday\" on it, which was very nice.

I have had 2 Nissans, 2 Acuras, and none Toyota/Lexus that I want to give it a try.  So I stopped by Bell Lexus North Scottsdale right down the street from my house.  I thought since this dealership moved from Phoenix to Scottsdale, their attitudes would be better and have higher quality of service, oh, was I totally wrong about this.\n\nTo begin the whole process, I've been in communication with one of their customer service rep over the Internet about what I want in my car, we kept writing e-mails back and forth to each other with the changes and exactly what I'm looking for.  One day on my day off, I stopped by the dealership for the first time.  There wasn't many people looking in their lot, one of the sales rep came out and I told him I was looking for a gal which would remain nameless because it's not important in this case.\n\nThen this gal introduced me to the product specialist that serves as sales rep as well.  He went through everything with me, trying to find me the color that I had previous talked to this gal about, and then he told me, I'm sorry, but the car you want is no longer available to you.  So I asked to see another similar vehicle and asked for a test drive.  He said he'll drive the car off the lot and let me drive the rest of the way.  I thought he meant he'll just drive the car out of the dealership and park it at the near-by street for me to take over.  No, he drove the car for like 5 minutes and about 2 miles away from the dealership before letting me take control of the vehicle.  What type of test drive was that?  Is he afraid that I might wrack the car or he is not sure if I know how to handle a Lexus?\n\nBack to the dealership after the worst test drive ever, we sat down to talk numbers.  He talked to his manager while I sat at his desk waiting for him.  He would not give me the final cost on how much I would need to pay, instead, he asked for $3,000 to locate the car that I requested with the gal earlier from another dealership.  Seriously, why the heck do you think I would give you $3,000 to locate the car for me when you can't even give me the final number on the car.  You can't be serious.  That's not how you want people to buy car from you.  Instead I think they are driving people away from their dealership since people are very afraid to go shop there.\n\nI have purchased the vehicle I want from Earnhardt Scottsdale Lexus.\n\nSeriously people, STAY AWAY FROM THIS DEALERSHIP.", "business_id": "1pYcTdg1n7_S867aR4SAvw", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-04-07", "type": "review"}

I visit Dr. Grant's office at least every other week, so I've gotten to know most of his staff quite well. They're always friendly, always helpful. And, they understand the stresses that owners and kitties alike feel when visits are necessary. \n\nDr. Grant is very patient in explaining potential and existing health conditions and is equally good about describing treatment options and their costs. He knows that each situation is unique, and I have never felt as though he tried to sway me in any decision I've ever had to make.  \n\nAs another reviewer mentioned, Dr. Grant treats only cats, so the environment in his office is much calmer than it might be at other vets' offices. Some dog owners just don't understand how stressed cats can become when they're around dogs, and so they don't always restrain their pets. It's great not to have to worry about that at Dr. Grant's. \n\nIf you decide to stop by, you can say hello to the assortment of kitties who live there.

A Nightmare experience.\nI adopted a special needs cat from Scaredy Cats a few years ago and have been happy with her veterinary care here for ~3 years. I did, however have a heartbreaking experience using their cat accommodation service while overseas for 2 weeks. It was an emergency trip, so I had no time to research for the best cattery in Phoenix/Scottsdale. When I dropped off my cat, her room was filthy with fur from previous cats. She was hissing and growling from the first moment. I should have walked out right there, but she was also needing daily subcutaneous fluid injections from a fluid drip bag (perscribed by scardey cats a week earlier). I paid extra to ensure the techs would give her the daily fluids. I left food for double the time i'd be away, and her favorite toys for comfort. Upon return, my cat was skinny, filthy with dull dirty coat (had not groomed herself once), and when I got her home and unpacked her bag, her fluid drip was still there untouched (!!!!), and all the extra food was gone. None of the toys had been taken out of the bag either. She must have freaked out for the whole 2 weeks. But that was not the worst of the horror. Upon pickup, the tech said my cat's 'previous owner' happened to visit Scardey Cats while I was away. This, the woman who dropped her off because she was sick and chose not to care for her health problems.  Without my consent, they let this woman into my cat's room to sit and spend a bunch of time with her!! The very same woman that was ok with her being put down 3 years earlier. How confused is my sick kitty now?? Seriously? I am still furious. It took a while, but I've nursed my cat back to health.

I took my cat here in August of last year because I suspected he was being overmedicated with Methimazole by another vet.  Dr. Wood saw him and seemed to clear things up.  My cat did not like physical exams, and he could be rough, so I told her that one time to let him be. Well, every month he had blood work to check his kidney and T4 values, and sometimes we did everything else too. He was FIV pos and he had anemia.  By November, he was still losing weight, and still had a huge appetite.  I told her this and the techs and they just their expressions were \"hmm\" (?)  At the time, I did not think cancer would be doing that because of his appetite.  Dr. Wood never physically examined him, which I should have demanded, and the tech was unnecessarily rough with him when he was scruffed.  His anemia was worse in November, and nothing was done to investigate why.  Well, in January, his abdomen filled up with fluid.  Dr. Grant saw him and told me he had cancer. Probably Lymphoma, and this was without anything but an x-ray.  I had to literally beg him to physically examine my cat and he felt a growth.  I pursued further diagnostics and he had cancer of unknown origin.  I am upset because in November something was happening and it was not addressed.  Dr. Wood said that we were trying to balance the thyroid medicine and maybe my cat did not adjust to it just yet, enough to gain weight, so I accepted that. However, when his anemia got worse that was a sign of something else, because his kidneys did not seem to be getting worse.  I had to euthanize my best friend in February.   I just do not understand how a vet hospital could be negligent like this.  I know he had many problems, but there is no justification for what happened. Just only that no one cared.  I know the result would have been the same, but maybe I could have had more time with him.  I also do not know what they have against physical exams, but even his other vet would try, and he would cooperate at some point, either at that time or the next. Physical exams should be part of protocol no matter the circumstances.  As a pet parent you have to think of Everything.  I did not know that cancer could make a pet very hungry.  I keep blaming myself because I trusted these people.

Safety is their MO. \n\nI came here in the fall of '06 for a work function. It was a team-building day, so while we did have to meet in a room and \"talk shop,\" the people at F1 made it very comfortable and easy. We met in their big room (with couches, high tables and ample space) for our meetings. Breaks were then infused with team fun. We actually got to split into groups and challenge each other - see who could be the fastest team to change 4 tires on a real (thought retired) race car. My team placed 2nd. It was great! We got to do a practice run, and then two real runs to let our lowest time qualify. \n\nF1 was sure to have snacks and beverages handy after (and before) in case we worked up an appetite during the day. Lunch was served here, too. Tasty hamburgers made to order. After our meetings, we got to go on the track. Beforehand, we sat through a brief safety video and explanation. Then we were fitted for helmets and shown to where the action happens. I was nervous. I had never driven a go-kart before, and these were suppose to be the fastest in-door go-karts in Arizona. \n\nUhm, yeah. Let's just say I had no idea what I was doing. Nobody explained the pedals to me, so I just assumed they ran like a car. I was right. I took off, not really knowing how many laps I had to do or where I was going. There were friendly guys out on the track to wave flags - for \"wreck\" ahead, slow down or even get out of the way of speed-devils behind ya. (I got the latter quite a bit.) \n\nAt the very last of the race, somebody sped by me to place ahead of me. That means I placed last. That's okay.

The track-time-per-dollar ratio is a little on the slim side, but I know space and karts aren't cheap, and it's a heck of a lot of fun without breaking the bank.\n\nThey also have leagues, which are an inexpensive way to fix your track jones and have some competitive fun doing it.   They even have a Junior league for kids as young as 8, who run the only slightly slower Junior karts.   The instructors here are top notch, competitive racers from around the region.\n\nMy only gripe about the junior kart program is that the instructors don't communicate it through the lens of an 8-12 year old kid.   Kids that age can't be expected to come into the program knowing what an apex is, much less what a late one is or what it means to \"hit\" one, or what it means to \"lift\", or what a \"heat\" is, or what \"track out\" means, or any number of other terms that experienced track drivers inherently understand, but fresh-faced kids probably don't.

Totally unimpressed after day 1, but I was already invested $70 per kid (x2) so I was hooked.  Here I am 5 weeks later taking them both out and enrolling them in activities elsewhere.\nThe flyer that my girls brought home from school made this program sound wonderful!  I fell for it hook, line, and now I am the sinker.  The flyer's luster quickly turned sour when I heard the orientation speech from the instructor.  A fee for everything.  The $7 per class that the flyer made sound so great quickly turned into a cost for uniforms, a cost for pom poms and different color pom poms as your kid advances (similar to a belt program in martial arts).  A fee for the test to get into the next color of pom pom.  A back fee if your kid missed a class and didn't pay the $7, and all fees must be up to date for your kid to take the test to advance.  The list goes on.  I was disappointed enough with those fees, but the disorganization of the staff members was also a downer.  They had all kinds of very specific instructions on properly signing in your kid to be given credit for attendance, and then most of the time, the instructor that carries the sign in form that would allow me to do that didn't show up until after the class started.  After a few weeks of instruction, the teacher also said we could find the routine on YouTube so that our kids could practice.  She didn't give a link or anything.  I searched and searched and I can assure you that the routine is not online, YouTube or anywhere.  My wife was also not real happy with the whole false advertising on the flier thing, but then she got really upset when she heard the instructor yell at the kids to sit on their butts and be quiet.\nI assume the fantastic reviews that I see for this organization are by parents who want nothing else than for their kids to be cheerleaders and who have very few choices to be elsewhere, so they're forced to tolerate this bullsh!t and disorganization.  As well, they're forced to brown nose these instructors so that their kid stands out as a favorite.  Take my advice.  Go elsewhere for your kids' activities.

You can rent out one of the trains and have your party in there - how cool would that be? There are four min attractions that cost money - the regular (well, not full sized)  train, the carousel, the museum and the little steamer train.

It's a scaled down version of a regular steam engine train. It goes all around the park and is a fairly long ride. Super fun. Next we went into the museum. They have a room with some artifacts and then you get to go inside the cars of a train to see the kitchen, a dining room, a couple sleeping cars and a lounge. Then we hit the carousel - standard but still fun. Although I think we were the only adults riding it - ha! But we saved the best for last - the little steamers. It's a miniature train but it can carry passengers. (even adults!) Everything on the route is mini too and there are funny signs along the way. \n\nThe park itself is so pretty - lots of huge shade trees and nice grassy areas to play or relax on and it's very clean.

It's very reminiscent of the Billy Jones Wildcat Railroad (BJWR) in Los Gatos, CA. There's a lot of train and non-train related activities to get into--so, let's stop wasting time. \n\nModel Railroad Building- This is every child and train enthusiast's dream; it's a huge Exhibition Hall filled with loads of electric trains and model sets that are generously provided by the local train clubs. The entrance is free, but there is a small donation box if you're feeling charitable. I'd also highly recommend going here in the afternoon; it's a good way to get out of the heat but still keep the kids entertained. 4*\n\nScottsdale Railroad Museum- This features one of only four dining cars that was built by the Pullman Co. for the Santa Fe Railway; the dining car is fully restored with vintage decorations to give you an idea of what the train looked like back when. It also has a huge variety of train memorabilia that are too numerous to list--you need to check it out for yourself. Fun Fact: Presidents Hoover, F.D. Roosevelt, Truman & Eisenhower all rode in that dining car! 4*\n\nTrain- This is what you really come here for: to ride the train! The train was donated by Guy Stillman who even had a chance to sell it to Walt Disney, but wanted to keep it in Scottsdale.  It's an approximate 8-minute ride around the park that everyone enjoys; there's even a Cattle Car that the kids love cramming into--which is great for us parents as it gives us that moment of Zen we always desire. I was only able to see the Diesel Engine, as I guess they only run the Steam Engine on the weekends. Next time, Gadget... 5*\n\nCarousel- Pretty standard ride on a historic 1950s era Carousel. I'm not a huge fan of Carousels (and neither is the boy), but if it's your thing I'm sure you'll love it. 4*\n\nPlayground- There are two separate play areas: one that's a traditional playground -with slides, swings, and such- and the other that's designed to look like an Old Western Town--complete with Bank, Stagecoach, Gold Mine and Hoosegow! They're both pretty terrific, but my one qualm is while there is some shade, it's probably not as complete as one would like from an Arizona Playground. 4.5*\n\nPicnic Areas- Tons of shaded picnic areas with attached BBQ Pits; FYI,  the nicer ones are available to reserve-- so be aware on weekends. 4*\n\nValue- The MSR sells tickets at $1/each which is puzzling because each ride requires two tickets--wouldn't it make more sense to sell each ticket for $2? But, I digress... They also sell an All-Day Pass for $10 which is a terrific value because after a few rides and a visit to the museum it's already paid for itself. 5*\n\nThe MSR is a great place and is run very well by the Scottsdale City employees. My son and I were there for almost 5-hours and we had a blast. If we lived in the area I'd probably be here way too much. It's a great and cheap way to get in some wholesome family fun without breaking the bank.

This guy is loaded with historical data on both train cars it nearly blew my head off. \n\nThe first car you go through has a lot of really good info with the assistance of exhibits and historical memorabilia. You really learn how both cars played some sort of major role in U.S. history. \n\nThe second car...this is where things got really interesting. The fact that it was used by 5 presidents and mostly used by Roosevelt (who in my opinion was one of the greatest presidents we ever had). He spent the better part of 4 years using this car to travel. After the U.S. got involved in WWII, they built a bullet proof car for presidents to travel in but FDR preferred this one. \n\nThe craziest thing I learned was when FDR died, they transported the body by train. There were several cars connected and this car was right behind the bullet proof car. Truman who was the Vice President and now President, told Eleanor Roosevelt to travel in the bullet proof car with the body and he would take this car. He fealt she would be safer that way. In the back of the car there is a sort of meeting area where there is an original couch and chairs. You can't sit on the couch but you can sit on the chairs. As you're sitting there, think about what could have been discussed by Presidents and advisors right in that very room, in those very chairs. Well, thanks to Bob I found out that this is where Truman first learned about the research and building of the Atomic Bomb. Harry Stimson was the Secretary of War and decided Truman needed to know. \n\nAs some of you may know, the Manhattan project was started in 1939. FDR died April 12, 1945. Truman was immediately sworn in and told about the project April 24, 1945. The same day I am writing this review only 70 years earlier, right in this very spot. MIND BLOWN!!!\n\nThis all took place in the Roald Amundsen car thats at this park. I highly recommend seeing it for yourself.

Since I was craving a good deli sandwich since last week today was the day. The restaurant itself is nothing special so I was hoping the food was. I gazed at the menu and was disappointed that there was no combo sandwiches, but the guy at the register was helpful and said that I could order a two meat sandwich for a dollar more. So I ordered the pickled beef tongue and chopped chicken liver (sometimes you got try the nasty stuff). He charged me for the lower price of the two and then added the dollar. I thought this was cool of him. Now about the prices, the sandwiches run in the $9-$12 range. I thought this was a bit high , but I wanted to try it anyway. I sat down and my lunch came pretty quickly. From the first bite a strange thing happened, I didn't think of how much the sandwich costs. It was very good. The chopped chicken liver was not dry and the tongue (get it served warm) was tasty. My sandwich came with a side of slaw (very good) and a pickle.

According to the man selling me the wash I was to get a wax, scent, and a deeper cleaning of the dash etc. I got in my car after paying $29 and my dash was still dirty, there was no scent, and my car was not entirely dry. Also, the \"wax\" is apparently applied during the wash not a hand wax like the man trying to up-sell me initially said it was. What a waste of money!", "business_id": "gnBgJD6LYsYhSneYVFDmhw", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-04-06", "type": "review"}

I too went back after I got down the road and realized they missed half the car and there was still bird shit on the window. They were first argumentative and said I should have purchased an upgraded wash if I really wanted a better job than what I got. They said they would redo it giving me a premium wash for no additional cost. I didn't get to excited about the upgrade since this was a 2010 Mercedes and still looked like new on the inside. All I wanted  was a clean exterior. Imagine the horror of getting to the pick up area and finding that they put amorall or a like kind of  dressing all over the dash, speaker grills, vents and door hardware. When I went back to the entry area for now the third time they insisted that they gave me this special treatment as part of their premium wash. I insisted that they remove it and they sent another guy in with a scubbing pad and some unknown solution.  When finished I had a blotchy colored dash with shiny looking areas all over the hard to get to areas. When I talked to the guy that said he was the manager he said he would check with his supplier the following week and see if he could get something to clean up the mess. He said he would call back a week ago. Still no call and a $50,000 car that looks like crap thanks to these people. It's too bad they don't  have a minus five selection here. This is a good place to send anybody that you really dislike.", "business_id": "gnBgJD6LYsYhSneYVFDmhw", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-05-18", "type": "review"}

If you want to be harrassed, and your personal info taken OUT of your car, and LOST or SOLD-GO HERE! The Manager known as Rich Geisler is as rude as a convict. The Site Manager- Shuan Carstensen is lacksidaisical and does not call you when your car is finished detailed and is un-helpful. Idropped my Infinity Fx35 off on Sunday, March 25th, 2012, at 9:30am by appt- Upon 3pm- 6 hours later- I went to pick up my car although no one called me to say it was done and ready- and to my astonishment  the inside of my car looked like a slick greasy vasoline mess! My leather seats, steering wheel &  consol had a film of cheap grease put on that was WET and slimey! The glove compartment was empty and never even vacumed much less cleaned or detailed. The floor mats were soaking wet and NOT clean- just wet. I felt ripped off  for $125.00-but it gets WORSE! When I got home I parked the car in my garage and went to go to work the next morning (Monday) and noticed my entire Leather folder containing my  IDENTITY - , Vehicle registration and Insurance card was missing! OMG! The guy working on my car Sunday could NOT even speak English- his name is Hector. I immediatly called the Via Linda location and spoke with Shuan Carstensen-Site Mgr. I kindly asked him to CALL every single patron who dropped their car off for detail Sunday to see if my info was accidentally put in another car. Shaun told me   to get on line, and get another Ins card and another Registration and not to worry about my Identity being stolen! He missed the point of Identity Theft! Shaun said he'd call me back by 11am- he never did- I called on Tuesday to discuss the possibility that my info had obviously been stolen from the AZ Auto wash, since  they could NOT locate it on site nor in other patrons cars- He turned me over to a young man who calls himself Rich, the General Mangager. I spoke with  Rich on Wednesday early morning in which the conversation ended up extremely  RUDE by Rich  and he hung up on me.- as though I would just simply go away.\nThere was also a slime ball about 21 yrs old hanging out at the wash,by the name of Brad Dennis pimping glass repairs. I told him NO- I didn't need his assistance and he continued mess with my windshield glass. He actually was still at the auto wash at 3pm and hounded me for a TIP to pay him! He was like a fly on paper and would NOT go away. I never told him I agreed to  pay him and he said he'd fix it for free.  They give me no other alternative but to  file a police report of theft  on their property.  They will find this complaint &  report on www.ripoffreports.com since they do not care about their reputation and the reputation of AZ Auto Wash- their employer to help with this situation to be remanded. OH! I forgot to mention this to you all- they NEVER steam cleaned my engine which was part of the $125. \n Do NOT take your car to  ANY of the AZ Auto Wash-unless you want to kick these idiots ass for me!", "business_id": "gnBgJD6LYsYhSneYVFDmhw", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-03-28", "type": "review"}

(not shampooed, just the seated sprayed off and wiped) We were told to get the $39.00 VIP package, and it would take care of cleaning off the front and back seats. Not only did the wash on the outside look horrible, they barely wiped down the front seats, doors, and dash, they also didnt wipe anything in the back. I had to argue with the manager for almost 10 minutes about wiping down the back, that took him a whole 2 minutes to do, and it was still so half-assed that I had to do it myself once I took the car home. We paid $39 for what would have been the same wash as the $7 was.\n\nI had then taken my car in for detail since I had received a detail job certificate from a friend a couple weeks prior to this fiasco, and being there are no refunds on detail jobs, I had to take it in or lose the money. So, this past weekend, it went in. They took 5 hours to detail the car. I was expecting it to take between 3-4 like they had originally told me, but, that was just the start of the frustration. I paid to have the car detailed with a clay bar to remove swirl marks and find scratches. There are now more swirl marks on my car than when it went in, not all of the wax was removed, so I had to use my microfiber cloths to remove it myself, I specifically said that I DIDNT want any armorall or leather conditioner on my interior, and to just clay bar the outside, they didnt listen to that, so I spent 30 minutes wiping greasy armorall off my interior and leather. I told the manager that I was completely dissatisfied with the job that was done, he refused to give me any money back and said I would have to bring it back for them to do the job again. I will NOT take my car back to have more damage done for another 5 hour job. I could have purchased the stuff to do the job myself in about 2 hours of time and had it done right.\n\nPlease head this warning and DO NOT TAKE YOUR CAR HERE! terrible wash, and even worse customer service.", "business_id": "gnBgJD6LYsYhSneYVFDmhw", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-05-07", "type": "review"}

Maybe because the fillet was medium plus, I really couldn't appreciate it as much.  The flounder was excellent.\n\nEverything is a la carte, so it can get kind of pricey.  We got the lobster chowder (one of the best I've had), creamed corn (very good), sauteed spinach (excellent alternative to creamed spinach, surprisingly very good), and chocolate lava souffle for dessert (which is a must).\n\nThe bread is also really good.

Their sides are great too the macaroni & cheese, creamed corn, and potatoes are great. The cr\u00e8me Brule & cheesecake are my favorite desserts. \n\nThe Service is great too even better if you go on a weeknight cause it is quieter more romantic for a special occasion without the background noise, everything is so clean, they servers are very knowledgable on the menu the way things prepared and perfect wine pairings for what you're eating. \n\nMy biggest complaint is they discontinued my favorite cocktail it was like sweet but had a spicy bite to it cause the bartender drops a little tabasco sauce in there so every time you take a sip it gives you a kick!

(Although, apparently, not anymore, after I dashed in and out of no less than six Jewels looking for them during my most recent pilgrimage, eyes rolling back in my head from the tragedy of it all.)\n\nSo, yeah. Chizona's. Total hole in the wall... but you're not coming here for the ambiance. The \"side\" salad/\"one\" slice and pop combo, clocking in at a staggering $6, gives you a ginormous fresh salad with crisp Romaine lettuce, chunks of tomato, black olives, and a handful of shredded mozzarella, served in a Styrofoam bowl, natch. It's practically big enough to be a meal on its own... but then you face the \"slice\" of pizza, which is really a quarter of a huge pizza, cut perfectly into the beloved squares. Gooey and greasy, with a thin crust that grows delightfully cracker-y towards the edges... we are talking down-home, for real Chicago goodness. The pizza puff (which I had to sample for austerity's sake) is a delectable deep-fried gooey handful of cheesy and perfectly seasoned sausage-y joy. Oh, heaven.\n\nThe various hot sandwiches -- Italian beef, etc. -- are served on the Holy Grail of Chicagoland bread, Gonella bread, and they are humongous. The fries on the side are so-so, but you can bet your sweet ass I'm not wasting precious gastric space on fries when there's pizza perfection to be had.\n\nOh delicious and heavenly joyousness.

The pizza smelled divine so we sat down to eat and the first thing we noticed was the crust. Maybe we have been spoiled by all the non authentic pizza we have been ordering over the years, but the crust was slightly flavorless and borderline too crunchy to even eat. The sauce and the toppings were awesome, though, and the breaded zucchini was great! I can't speak on the wings personally but my dad ate a few and commented that they were good. One really big plus was that  nothing was overly greasy and it was probably the freshest pizza I've ever had delivered to me.  All in all I'm not ranting and raving about Chizona's,  but I'm not writing them off either.", "business_id": "n_HvrTuGUgxXJM0yq39-0g", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-03-29", "type": "review"}

The comments about this location can be found in paragraphs 2 and 3:\n\nI am an extremely dissatisfied customer after trying to purchase your Greenfiber Blow-in attic insulation with the advertised free 24 hr machine rental.  I first visited store location #1204 on my way home from work Wednesday 3/23/11 around 5:30pm to obtain details on the purchase/rental conditions.  First, it took me about 10 minutes to locate a sales associate and I actually had to find someone in a different department.  She was actually courteous and professional and directed me to ask for details at the commercial sales counter.  I found someone near the commercial sales counter that offered to contact some one to answer my questions.  The contacted associate arrived and  informed me that the employees for the counter leave at 4pm.  I asked for details on the deal and he said it was a 20 bag minimum purchase for the free rental (which is what I read online).  I asked, if I purchase the product in advance can I then reserve the rental for a later date.   He stated that he couldn't give me full details on the rental deal, but if I called back in the morning to the commercial sales desk after 7am, that they would be able to reserve the machine for me.  \n\nWhen I called the next around 9am 3/24/11, the lady informed me that they do not reserve that machine and the best thing to do would be to call Saturday morning and see if a machine was still available to rent or come in first thing in the morning. My wife and I chose to come in at the time the store opened at 6am on Saturday 3/26/11.  When we arrived we headed straight to the commercial sales desk and were informed we had to go to customer service to rent the machine.  We walked across the store to customer service and there was some in line renting the machine.  I had seen two machines next to the product that looked used, so I asked if there were more than one machine.  I also asked another employee for the phone number to the Scottsdale store #0792 to check their availability on the machine rental, as it was the next closest store to our home.  I called this store and the employee in commercial sales stated they did have a machine available, but he could not hold it for me as it is first come first serve. By this point the customer service desk looked up on their computer and stated the N. Phx store only had one machine available for rental. Next, we headed straight for the store #0792.\n\nWe arrived at store #0792 about 6:40am.  We headed straight for the customer service desk, as that was where store#1204 had told us that is the desk that handles rentals.  Customer service promptly told us to go to commercial sales for rental, which we immediately did.  When we got to the commercial sales counter the employee did remember my call.  When he looked up in the computer for the machine he found it had actually been rented before I called. He apologized and I expressed my frustration with both store locations and that was going to take my business elsewhere.\n\nIn general, I find this first come first service policy for tool rentals does not meet the needs of the \"do-it-yourself\" customers I would think Lowe's would like to attract.  It is extremely inconvenient. Most of us work full-time and are trying to complete our project on what little \"free time\" we have.  In larger projects we are also generally trying to coordinate with family and friend's schedules to complete the project.  We DO NOT have the time to be waking up at the crack of dawn every weekend in hopes that we will be the first \"lucky one\" at the desk to rental the tools we need to complete our projects.   I understand your company may have had past problems with people reserving tools and then not picking them up, which may have led to the first-come-first-serve policy. However, I think there would be better options to allow reservations, like have a small deposit due to hold a reservation or a 30 minute pick up timeframe.  Those are just a few ideas.  I also would have had no problem purchasing the $200+ for the product, if a future reservation would have been promised.   \n\nFinally, at this point in time I will not be doing business with any Lowe's location and I will inform my family and friends of this negative experience with your company.  I have spent over 2 hours this week getting the run around from these 2 stores and we did find another source to obtain the materials I need to complete my project.   I will post this letter under both store locations.", "business_id": "xrNL6b5x1W1begCWFDduIw", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-03-26", "type": "review"}

It definitely looks like a hole in the wall in the middle of a strip mall. Food is delicious and the place doesn't look super nice. But again, when you go to get food, you mostly only care about the food.\n\nI love love love their tortillas here. It's warm and doesn't taste like it's out of a plastic bag that you'd get from costco. The carne asada is also very good here, great quality. I ordered the Carne Asada California which is simply a carne asada burrito with fries in there. I also had some of my friend's carne asada fries. Both were really delicious, but I'm a fan of thicker fries when it comes to carne asada fries (in the burrito, I like it thinner). So really no complaints on the food. It's cheap. And if you are REALLY hungry, they have a Jumbo Burrito which is half carnitas and half carne asada for 8 dollars. Such a steal because it actually is.... really huge. Salsa was also very good, flavorful and had a nice kick to it. Staff is friendly, no complaints there. \n\nI wasn't a big fan of the venue at all. It's beat up, the dining room and furnishing are all really dull and the bathroom has graffiti all over the walls and is dimly lit. They have a couple of old video games and some old pool table there, too. Seriously needs a make over.\n\nSo come here and take it to go.

My first experience was really great - quiet, neighborhood atmosphere, fresh fish, friendly staff, reasonable prices and really great special rolls and sushi on the menu. What's not to love? Fast forward to my second visit, and I was wondering if I was in the wrong place. Hmm, same tables..same decor...recognize that sushi chef on the left..if this is the same place, why do I feel like I'm at RA??  \n\nFirst, our server was completely disinterested and distracted. We were clearly not her first priority, and likely not her 10th priority either. She brought out everything all at once - including my miso soup and Kirin light! This created a huge dilemma for me because all my food was now sitting there waiting for me to gobble down all at once. I know it won't get cold, but it's the principle of it. The last time I was at Sakana, the rolls were individually spaced for our enjoyment and separate from the appetizer course. I'm pretty sure even RA will bring the soup out first. \n\nThen, the music. During dinner, I lean over to tell my date something unbelievably romantic and realize I am yelling in his ear. Not romantic or cute. Better yet, the blaring music included Pit Bull's most recent Hotel gem and other similarly out of place selections. What? I don't know who picked the music that night, but it seemed completely out of place and a real distraction to my meal. And, I promise, I'm not an old fogey who can't get down. \n\nFinally, I was very disappointed in the sushi that night. It did not seem as fresh as it should be, and I actually had to leave several pieces to be tossed out. Now, I am not one to waste food. I am not a shy eater who nibbles on her salad over the course of a date - I will happily, though perhaps with a slight blush, out-eat any date.  That means, if I let some of my sushi go to the trash, something was not right. Now, it was not foul, nor did I see reason to send everything back.

My mindset was simply this, don't do it. You see it only took that one bad experience from years ago and I've held ever single seafood restaurant accountable since. With the passage of time and through technology, modern shipping and refrigeration methods the life of fresh fish and seafood has been greatly extended. So much so that my attitude towards eating fish has turned around completely and now I crave it.\n\nWhile fish was exiled from my life, Sakana sushi was quietly building a mini sushi empire of Japanese restaurants. Since opening their first in 1996 they've continued to expand and now with 4 valley locations, it won't be hard to get your sushi fix without breaking the bank, especially at lunch time. \n\nEach day Sakana offers several different daily creations and specials in addition to the 15 or so items on their standard lunch menu. Between you and me, go for one of the daily specials. These lunch plates are massive and will satisfy the most famished of appetites. You'll see exactly what I mean if you order up the Chicken Maturi ($8.99). A whole chicken breast pounded out into 2 thin slabs, breaded and deep fried until golden and crunchy is then dressed with a slightly sweet soy sauce. Oh and that's not all, along side is a salad of mixed greens and a half of a crab filled California roll. You will not leave hungry.\n\nAlong with a happy upbeat greeting when you arrive at Sakana, Miso soup comes standard just as soon as you sit down; talk about an efficient lunch service. For a light snack to accompany the soup I also enjoy ordering Edamame ($3.25); steamed soybeans sprinkled with salt, that are as much fun to say as they are to eat.\n\nMany people do not understand the difference between sushi and sashimi. This is actually really easy; sushi refers to the vinegar cooked rice while sashimi refers solely to the fish itself. To see the difference first hand, order the Sakana Lunch ($9.99). Thin slices of sashimi; raw salmon, tuna, shrimp, albacore and house smoked salmon are placed on top of sushi; rice. Served on a wooden board, a California roll and a rotating fried item accompany the special. \n\nIf you're dieting and trying to watch your starch intake, Id highly recommend trying the Sashimi Deluxe ($11.99). Not only do you get a crispy salad but a platter filled with a delicious combination of sliced salmon, tuna, albacore and hiramasa aka Australian King Yellow Tail. However this line up isn't set in stone as the chef will change these out with what's available any given day. What you can take for granted is the freshness and quality of each type of fish served.\n\nFor the price, Sakana is hard to beat, though for peace of mind, I would have gladly paid more.", "business_id": "Bjt3rB73dvSDe1XEPEWc6w", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-04-02", "type": "review"}

All of the rolls I have tried taste great, however, some of them tend to fall apart on you. They aren't very tightly rolled and the rice isn't as sticky as some other sushi bars. I'll give it 3 stars for A-OK because, for the price, I like it but I don't think it goes above and beyond. \n\nI'll definitely be back to grab some quick tasty sushi for happy hour.", "business_id": "Bjt3rB73dvSDe1XEPEWc6w", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-05-16", "type": "review"}

Either way it's worth the wait. The staff is awesome & everyone who walks in gets a friendly greeting from the guys behind the sushi bar. Their creative rolls are delicious but be careful because some can get to be a bit expensive (the Fitzgeroll is $18.99).

I'm not saying undercooked, I am saying the ground meat was RAW.  the cheese was melted, so I know someone put it on the grill to cook it.   Now talk about uncomfortable, we showed our server, who brought the manager (which we didn't ask for I assure you) who brought out a line cook...  What are you thinking, show him this health hazard somewhere else.  I did jokingly say I felt somewhat lucky we had Scottsdale Healthcare right next door after this one.\nIn the same meal, we had two deli sandwiches.  All I can say was the meat was rubbery and wet.  Yes, wet.  To me it was almost like it came out of the freezer or something, sliced and put on the sandwich.  YUCK.  \n\nNow about the service which on my latest visit was ridiculously bad.  The waiter forgot items, didn't return to the table, and all, given the restaurant had 10 customers all together was horrendous.  (BTW, it wasn't our waiter who brought over the manager it was someone else, he was nowhere to be found)\n  \nNow my other recent visit, the service was stellar (at the PV Mall restaurant).  Our server was more than on, he was outstanding.  In fact, for that visit, the service was a solid 5/5... food was 1.5/5 on that one.\n\nAnyway, for us, we have seen our last visits to Chompies.

Probably one of my favorite places in Scottsdale for casual eating.  My friend and I go every Saturday mornings after hiking with the dogs. Obviously since we bring the pups we sit outside. I have to say, I am shocked at reading about the terrible service. In the three years I have gone here at least once a week, we have never had terrible service. There is one waiter who I don't think likes serving the patio people (or maybe it's just us dog people) but everyone else is amazing. We're barely there for 5 min and they are out with water bowls for the dogs, coffee for me, and a diet coke for my friend. \n\nOn to the food. It's thanks to Man vs Food, and my mom, that I found Chompie's. She had seen the episode and since I was moving to Phoenix, she wanted to try. Now every time she visits we have to go at least twice. She has gotten everything from french toast to reubens to chicken and waffles --  and she's loved it all. Her favorites are the sandwiches because they are enough food for 1-2 more meals!! Having celiac's disease, I have to go with what's on the GF menu, but I still love it. My go-to is the GD Bagel w/lox platter. It is so yummy and filling. The rare times I don't get that, I will get the reuben or GF waffles. The pups always get their plate of bacon.\n\nChompie's is now carrying a variety of GF deserts and pastries, which I love!! My non-gf friend and I will occasionally split a chocolate and peanut butter brownie. I'm lucky I have the dog or I would go in before I left and buy more for home.\n\nWell that it is. We'll be at Chompie's with the danes tomorrow for our post hike brunch like we are every weekend!", "business_id": "IM-9thHqQbBK5tX5MfTzBQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-03-21", "type": "review"}

Knock this 5-pound nemesis on its ass within 30 short minutes, and you rule the stoop, my friend!  Myself, I don't entertain delusions: I'm weak.  I didn't even consider the Challenge.

First time around, I ordered shrimp with veggies - the shrimp did not taste fresh so I picked around it and ate the veggies and brown rice.  I went with chicken the next few times, and when I saw that they have eggplant (my fave) on the menu, I started requesting a combo of eggplant, mixed veggies, and chicken. Still, the chicken tastes almost processed - Once again, I eat the veggies and rice.  Maybe the key is to order beef or tofu... I'll keep trying until I get it right, or maybe I'll just have to find an alternative.  \n\nEither way, China Lite gets 3 stars from me.

Every time I go it is great. I have never left feeling unsatisfied or pissed because I spent money on food that was terrible.

They give you sour cream and salsa to mix it up a bit, but I am a purest and stick with just the chips and the dip. They have a somewhat limited selection of beers, but offer the main stays of domestic lights. They also have a beer I have grown to love, Sessions. It's an American lager, similar to Stella in taste.

They are very attentive and are always there to fill up your water or see if you need another drink. There can be a wait here so make reservations or be prepared to wait. There is a bar to wait and grab a drink beforehand, which always makes the time go by faster. \n\nNormally I get the Ahi Tuna entree, when they have it. It comes seared, so rare, but I look mine a little more well done and the staff is always accommodating. The seasonal vegetables that are served with most of the entrees are fresh and either steamed or sauteed perfectly, plus they put a little bit of Parmesan cheese on top. Good touch. I have had the cheeseburger also. It has slowly grown on me. I didn't like it at first, but it is tasty. The fries are great too. I have also had the dirty rice and beans on the side. Black beans and white rice. Nice compliment if you are having a small salad or something. \n\nCan't say that I have had dessert. I think most of their choices have nuts in them.

It was dark and upbeat, but not stuffy by any means. The menu had many delicious options - it was difficult to make a decision.\n\nI started with a side salad with bleu cheese. It was crazy good. It had a housemade bleu and croutons, and even had corn in it. Different and scrumptious.\n\nFor my main course, I had their baby back ribs. These ribs were easily the best I've ever had (sorry Trail Dust). They were beyond fall off the bone they were so tender. The shoe string fries it came with were so perfectly done, they didn't even require ketchup. My wife had the Thai Noodle Chicken Salad, which she dubbed as the greatest salad she has ever had. My mother had the Rotisserie Chicken and Couscous. She was also very happy with her meal.\n\nFor dessert we shared the Belgian Hot Fudge Sundae with Candied Pecans. Damn it was sinfully delicious.\n\nAll in all, a perfect meal. 5 stars, with ease.", "business_id": "jBb5KHHAj4s8hcXVS6QXDg", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-03-10", "type": "review"}

Geez, I like this place a lot, it's one of the few restaurants where if I had the option, I would eat there every day. \n\n      We had reservations for 6:45 and were quickly greeted and sat right down. The place is always lively, always a crowd and always a little noisy, just the way it should be. I got a tasty Jack and Diet and she a glass of white wine as we started with their famous spinach dip. Nowadays it seems every restaurant is throwing a dip of some type together, but none come within thirty feet of the deliciousness that is the Houston's spinach dip. Their chips are crispy and fresh, the spinach dip itself is so flavorful and thick and has big chunks of artichoke in it, it also comes with a side of both salsa and sour cream which compliment the dip beautifully. What a treat! \n\n      On to the main course! I moved over to a beer for the entree, Sierra Nevada Heff I think, mighty fine, and the lady stuck with the wine. I ordered the Hawaiian rib-eye (I'm drooling just typing it) and Kristen had the prime rib, both ordered medium rare. My rib-eye was absolutely incredible... the outside simply burst with this delicious Hawaiian marinade, goodness, if only I could describe the flavor, and the inside was cooked perfectly to my taste, the meat was tender and bursting with its own cow goodness. I could only manage one bite before shoving a taste in the mouth of my partner, who also declared it a natural wonder. The steak came with a potato but I opted for fries with a side of homemade buttermilk ranch for dipping. I could write a novel on these delicious fries, but just try them, get a side of their homemade ketchup as well, wow. Her prime rib was beautiful, absolutely beautiful. Cooked very well, lots of meat, tasty, tender and came with a savory au jus sauce, bursting with goodness. She had the potato which came with the prime rib and looked like a football covered in cheese and bacon (not bacon bits, big chunks of bacon), and man was it good. I occasionally wondered if I chose wrong with the fries, but I didn't, shoot, order them both I say! \n\n      The only sort of negative of the night was our waitress, she just happened to be new and a little naive, or careful maybe? She was overly cautious about our age, checking our IDs more than once (I'm 28) and forgetting our drink orders twice. I completely forgive this, it was busy, she was new and had several tables, no big deal at all, she was a sweetheart. \n\n      If you have never visited Houston's, I highly recommend it, they have many dinner options and even a sushi bar! The atmosphere is super nice and inviting, it is dimly lit and romantic. I love this place.

Another recent issue is the change in potato type for their fries, they're just not as crispy as they used to be. But worst of all is the Houston's/Hillstone split.

As a local, I used to love this place. However over the past few years this has become a tourist trap with all the snowbirds congregating here day after day. \nSnowbird friends came in for three days and wanted to try Houstons. They now take reservations which they have needed to do for years. Without reservations you can wait forever. The restaurant reminds me of many places in Chicago, lots of wood inside, mainly booths . We had a 7pm reservation and were seated right away. The food service was excellent but refills on the ice tea were slow. There were 4 of us, 3 of us had the Hawaiian Marinated Rib Eye which is served with a loaded baked potato. The price was $31.00 and the value was worth it. The steak was big and the potato was HUGE. I took half my meal home. My friend had the ribs which is a full slab of ribs. He had french fries and cole slaw with it. He said it was excellent. \nSo now you are asking...why only 3 stars? They have changed their menu. While I know the big thing now is Kale salad, the thought of Kale Salad as a meal makes me ill. They used to have a Chicken Club Salad, my favorite, that is gone as is the artichoke. The menu seem more limited. That is my protest about restaurants that fix things that are not broken. Also, this is a nice restaurant and while I know this is a touristy area, could you take off the flip flops and white shorts for one hour and put on a nice pair of jeans?

We walked in and the place was jumping.  Luckily there were a few seats available at the bar where we saw one of the bartenders JUST serving entrees as we arrived.  We were met by a female bartender (blonde) who stopped us in our tracks to say \"sorry we are closing and so longer serving\".

I asked my sister to make reservations at her favorite restaurant and she decided on Houston's. She was raving about their Hawaiian Rib-eye that she always orders from them. She was excited to take me here bc she loves food just as much as I do (especially a good filet steak). We arrived five minutes early for our reservation and the hostess asked if we were a party of three and my sister replied yes. The hostess then responded that it will be about a 15 minute wait. My sister then told her we had a reservation here, after I said \"Wait, don't we have a reservation?\". My sister assumed that they recognized her bc she comes here that often. We got seated right away and the night started off right. The ambiance is really nice and we got asked for beverages pretty quickly. We ordered as soon as we got our beverages bc we already knew what we wanted. We ordered the Home Smoked Salmon, Hawaiian Ribeye (for my sister and her fianc\u00e9 to share bc they are on a 'diet'), side of Seasonal Veggies, USDA Prime Center-Cut Filet, and 2 beers. I ordered my filet to be Medium RARE. The smoked salmon came out first and It was OK but my sister loved it. Next our entrees came out... the top of my steak was pretty BLACK. When I cut in to the steak I already knew it was bad. It cut like how you think a thick beef jerky might cut. But I thought maybe the taste will make up for it... I was wrong! The steak tasted like beef charcoal. I then asked my sister and the fianc\u00e9 to try it, thinking maybe I was going crazy. But they agreed that the steak was charred. My sister insisted that I tell our waitress, but I didn't have the heart to. Next thing I knew she flagged our waitress down and told her the situation. She agreed that the steak was over cooked but also mentioned that all their steaks were normally charred. I do not believe that anybody would eat a steak that taste like that! She apologized and said she will bring a new one right out. She took my plate away plus my utensils and I had to sit there watching them eat their food. I didn't have utensils to even take a bite of what they had. My sister offered a bite so I took one off her fork. But they were sharing a plate so I didn't want to eat the little they had. My plate FINALLY came after they already finished their plate. The manager (I assumed he was bc he was wearing a suit) put the plate down and apologized again and asked me to cut through the steak to make sure it was to my liking. He was awkwardly hovering so I felt rushed to roll-out my new utensils out of my napkin and felt rushed to cut through it. I have to say the steak was prepared much better. So I sat there eating my plate ALONE for the next 15 minutes. It was a really undesirable experience. Instead of having normal family conversations, it became more about the restaurant and the steak. We all agreed that for a higher-end restaurant such as Houston's we would expect something to be on the house. But we got our bill and everything was there. Nothing was comped, not even the side seasonal veggies. They did nothing to make up for it. I told my sister that I was disappointed on her choice of restaurant and now she is a little upset even though I was the one who got the short end of the stick. I still gave her a 15% tip bc it wasn't her fault for my piece of charcoal. My sister is going to have to rethink her favorite restaurant.", "business_id": "jBb5KHHAj4s8hcXVS6QXDg", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-03-04", "type": "review"}

This is long overdue and I wish yelp existed when I was going though this on my own. Let me start by stating that I have a pure bred lab (I will allow my next dog to rescue me) and at the time of the needed services I was 20 years old and severely taken advantage of in the situation. This was a long time ago, but I am so much more knowledgable now. I was recalling recently how I was taken advantage of when I was young and in college (GO DEVILS) and my dad is a dentist- for people (and like a wild unicorn, he is still an honest dentist)!!! Dr Visser is a businessman, I know the term HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL, as I am in the industry, and he is in no way that type of \"doctor.\" I was looking to give my girl the best case scenario, without braces, and after paying $1,500 to have her baby canines extracted he advised me to have a dental device put on. I got several opinions (some in Scottsdale, some in the east valley) and was directed to have one of her canine teeth removed. Long story short, after more visits to Dr Visser we went with a great vet that removed the adult canine for $250. My father is a USC grad dentist and he was so happy with the work that was done and we proceeded as normal. My old lady is now 15, we LIVE happily ever after- sans left canine. I recently relived this tale as a one off and thought I should share my knowledge about Dr Visser. I have followed my vet in NYC everywhere for the past 10 years (as long as we have lived here) and we have never been taken advantage of like what we went through in AZ, when I was a poor college student.

It always seems busy so tonight we decided to give it a try.  We got there around 6:30 p.m. and it was fairly busy. In our mid-forties we felt like we were bringing the average age down significantly. OK, we can live with that. Second observation, welcome to the 80s. Its all pink banquettes and turquoise tabletops, with Scottsdale all being about looks and trends this seemed weird.\n\nOur waitress was great. No complaints there. She was attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. Service was quick and friendly. \n\nWe ordered the lasagna special and an egg salad sandwich. The lasagna came with a salad, which was delivered in a little ice cream dish cup. Cute! The lasagna came with garlic bread.  Part of the lasagna was burnt and covered up with sauce (Yuk). The egg salad sandwich was OK.  Also ordered dessert. We ordered the lemon meringue pie and cookies and cream ice cream. The lemon meringue pie was a huge disappointment. The \"lemon\" part of the pie was pasty and had zero lemon flavor. We had assumed the ice cream was home made but when paying we noticed it was just Dryers. \n\nWhen we checked out we noticed a sign that they accept cash and check only. We did not notice the small sign posted upon entering because it was hidden behind people waiting to pay. There is indeed an ATM with a $3 charge right by the register. How incredibly convenient.  When waiting about 8 minutes to pay we noticed a bunch of signs at the entry  that they are not seating incomplete parties, not wanting anyone to sit there to work or do homework, etc.... Seemed super unfriendly. \n\nSo, in wrap-up; the food was mediocre, the service was great, but the method of payment and rather unwelcome signs do not warrant for a return.\n\nNEED TO ADD THIS TO MY REVIEW (DAY AFTER ORIGINAL 5/20 POST). SO THE NO DEBIT OR CREDIT CARD POLICY FORCES YOU TO USE THE ATM AT THE CHECK OUT (BECAUSE WHO CARRIES CHECKS ANYMORE). THE ATM STATES THERE IS A $3 FEE. TODAY I CHECK MY BANK ACCOUNT AND THERE IS A $3 FEE AND A $2.50 FEE FROM THE ATM ON MY STATEMENT (NOT A FEE FROM MY BANK, THEIR ATM MACHINE). SO MY $20 DINNER ENDED UP COSTING ME $29.50 CENTS ($4 TIP AND $5.50 IN BANK FEES). A RESTAURANT THAT IS TOO CHEAP TO ACCEPT DEBIT OR CREDIT CARDS BUT THEN FORCES YOU TO USE THEIR ATM WHICH THEY SUPPOSEDLY NOT HAVE A STAKE IN GUARANTEES I WILL NEVER RETURN.

They're just okay...\n\nI know that these guys have a poor rating on Yelp to begin with, but we were under a bit of a deadline and they were going to be able to deliver.  The salesman was a bit condescending when he found out there would be competing offers, but he did a thorough estimate (showing us cuts and how the carpet would be installed.).  The other companies I got estimates from either could not install in time, simply did not get back to me, or I just didn't like (Empire Carpet.)  \n\nSo despite being the most expensive, we went with Baker Brothers to install tile and carpet in almost the entire house.   \n\nFirst off, they don't have their own people.  They subcontracted our carpet removal, tile installation, and carpet installation.  They MAY have some of their own, but we never saw them.  They said \"the company truck broke down so we're using our personal truck today.\" Haha.  \n\nBack to the salesman, he KNEW we were changing all of the flooring out because the previous owner let their dogs ruin the floors with urine.  We explained a long process of (1) removing carpet and padding (2) washing concrete floors (3) bleaching floors (4) treating the floors with an enzyme eliminator and (4) sealing the cement.  So we were surprised when they didn't want to take out the urine soaked tack strips.  After a very heated phone call, they did it. My salesman was off that day, but eventually they did it.  When they came back after a week of the floor being treated to install the carpet, it took them 14+ hours to install carpet in  the house.. 10 of that doing the actual carpet, about 4 doing tack strips.  One of the guys didn't speak a lick of English and didn't know a darned thing about installing carpet.  Plus they left their lunch garbage and several water bottles in our yard when they did leave.  \n\nThe tile was done beautifully, with no problem by the way.\n\nIf we had not been under a time constraint, we would have had the option of going elsewhere.  And because of the price, we would have.

Name a store, any store and we visited it. Generally we found two things in common. One, area rugs can be very expensive and two, most rug salespeople don't have a clue what they're talking about.\n\nBear in mind we weren't looking for a plain old rug. We wanted what could be described as an \"oriental rug\" but not fancy.  \n\nThe salesman at Baker Brothers (Steve) was more than helpful. Rather than just pointing us at the racks and racks of rugs he asked us a bunch of questions. What colors? What's the room look like? Traditional? Modern? Children? Pets? Lot of foot traffic? After answering all of his questions he actually steered us clear of wool rugs and pointed to the less expensive man-made rugs (by the way, \"less expensive\" is a relative term).\n\nWe found one that we liked but they didn't have it in stock in the size we wanted. So, what did Steve do? Let us take the smaller rug home to make sure we liked the colors in the room.  Nice guy.

Casey was working when I walked in and could not have been sweeter or more efficient when giving me a tour.  (Make sure to arrive at least 10 minutes early so you are not rushed when you go).\n\n3 - Amenities!  Not only did the relaxation area have plenty of magazines, water, tea, fruit, cookies, etc... but the bathroom had razors, toothpaste, shower caps, and more.  (I realize that most spas do have these things, but I just didn't expect it for some reason).  They also have a pool, jacuzzi, sauna, and steam.  \n\n4 - I've had several facials in my life and never really enjoyed them too much; I usually prefer massages no question.  However, this facial was awesome!  My estetician was Ellen - she was fantastic!  I loved that the facial included a hand massage as well as face massage - she even got my chest, neck, and shoulders too.  Plus, the bed was really comfortable - just the right temperature!  It was extremely relaxing and I feel like my skin was glowing when I left!\n\nThere are plenty of details that I'm sure I'm forgetting, but you get the point - this was a really great spa!  \n\n***One thing to note:  the locker-room area, waiting room, pool, etc... actually everything is CO-ED!  Make sure you bring a bathing suit and keep your robe on :)  Come to think of it, if you can get your guy to accompany you, I bet this could be a fun couple activity too!\n\n****I am told that the first Wednesday of every month is 2 for 1 night.

We received a gift card for a couples' massage for Christmas.  It is now the end of May and we finally had a day we could devote to \"us\".  \nOur entire day at the spa was such a treat.  We enjoyed yoga, lunch, the pool, jacuzzi, steam room, sauna, and deep tissue massages.  I have been known to have some sort of preconceived ideas that I may be treated differently based on our appearances and/or socioeconomic status.  I should note that these ideas never made it from my brain to my mouth.  They are based solely on my past supporting an idea that just don't fit in in Scottsdale (I don't really want to either).  This is all on me, and wrongly so.  The staff were all so very genuine.  Everyone made sure we were enjoying ourselves every step of the way.  We were treated respectfully and with kindness constantly.  Thank you for proving my inner insecurities wrong!  It was greatly appreciated and made for an even more fantastic experience.\nSpecifics:\nYoga- \nWe were lead by a very supportive David.  He listened to where we were, what our needs were, and guided us through a challenging practice.  We both left feeling challenged, relaxed, strong, and clear minded.  A great start to a spa day!\nLunch- \nThere is a small menu (which makes sense) and not too many vegetarian/vegan options.  We were able to make 2 of the salads vegan and they were delicious!  They serve a soda and a cookie with the meal, but after yoga I didn't feel much like having all that sugar.  I chose a prickly pear soda (when in Rome...) and drank a bit of it.  It was tasty, but I really just needed water.\nAnd now the massage!-\nWhen these ladies say deep tissue, they don't mess around.  I carry the stresses of being a single mom, a middle school math teacher, and local union vice presidency on my shoulders... and they weren't afraid to dig and and get some real work done!

Clean with the exception of the balcony and up to date with a nice view of the pool area.  Balcony needed to be hosed down since the local bird decided to use it as a stopping point to relieve themselves.\n\nThe bed was comfy and the housekeepers keep it well stocked with free bottles of water, seriously in the evening I had them knock on the door for the turn down service with 2 bottles of water and mints in hand, score!  \n\nA few words about the AC.  You're in Scottsdale and it was very hot outside so you need a good AC, the AC in these units are awesome draw the blinds and you could hang meat in there.  Only thing was the vent blew straight to and directly at the desk so I had to turn the AC off in order to get any work done.  It was manageable, but a bit awkward.\n\nNice property for the price.  I wouldn't hesitate to book again when I return.", "business_id": "CD-2yHTSObgvAhW-pYHfMw", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-05-25", "type": "review"}

We purchased a king size mattress from their in house line and from what the sales lady (daughter of the family) told us, it was supposed to be good quality, individually wrapped coils, with side reinforcements that wouldn't break down for $985 incl delivery and box springs. Unfortunately, it broke down almost immediately. You would have to put a pillow on the side of the break down to try to avoid rolling out of bed if you slept on the wrong side! We tried rotating every which way with no improvement. And the interior of the mattress was uneven and wavy. It didn't bother me as much as it did my husband and so I put off calling in the store to return it until too late (my bad! Life gets busy!) I'd guess I'm about at the one year mark now - I finally called when he started sleeping on the COUCH because his back pain was so intense. Here's the kicker: they file everything by hand so if you purchase here, KEEP the little half sheet carbon copy receipt. If you don't, you won't have any luck getting any relief if you are unhappy with your product. They wouldn't even look it up for me!!! We have already purchased a new Tuft & Needle mattress (which my husband loves! He's finally getting a good night's sleep!). I don't want to exchange it now, so I'm not sure what to do with this Auburn Euro top! I offered to take it back to them so they could see what happened to hopefully improve the product in the future and they told me that if I did that waste management would just come pick it up. At a loss! Sweet people on the onset, if you purchase here - stick to a better known brand, and for heaven's sake - keep that receipt. Local, family owned businesses are great - unless you need access to a record they are unwilling or unable to locate. I wasn't expecting a full refund because it's been about 14 months and I can still use the box springs, but to have them tell me I was totally out of luck and there was NOTHING they could do without the receipt was pretty disappointing - especially considering it was such a poor product.

The walls, doors, and vents in this building (originally built by Merve Griffin) are faulty. Faulty to the point that noise at any usual hotel or motel would mute it so it wouldn't disturb other guest's sleeping habits. When I was walking down the halls, I could hear people talking, snoring, and watching TV everywhere in the building. In my room I could hear the next door guests talking about their sports games or whatever, and I could hear the wake up alarms all go off in the morning across the halls while my room's door was closed. The building is also oddly designed to not allow guests to easily find ice machines, and good luck finding a vending machine, even for water.\nFinally on the last day, the weekend happened and the pool was too full of local people, who seem to view this hotel as a valid home vacation destination, and two different banquets that spilled out into the guest's areas...

We all know that bottled H20 is EXPENSIVE at hotels, so this was grrrreat!

I would not take a specialty item, like a leather bag, or cashmere coat, or wedding dress to this dry cleaner (even though the signage says they do those things), but for everyday items like shirts and pants, or blouses and skirts, they can't be beat. I've been using them for my husband's work clothes and my dresses every week for over a year. \n\nHow do I love them? Let me count the ways...\n1. Convenient:  Close to home and in a shopping center I visit frequently.\n2. Open early and late: 7-7 during the week, Saturday hours are more limited, closed on Sundays. \n3. Friendly: everyone there has been very friendly and welcoming to me. One of the ladies knows my car and gets my order ready to go before I even come in. I'm not sure what country they are from, but it's obvious that English is not their first language. They still manage to convey their meaning effectively and understand what I'm saying. (This is another reason I wouldn't bring them a special item. I think the language barrier is a potential problem.)\n4. Helpful: they check pockets before cleaning the clothes and rescued my husband's rosary beads for me. They were neatly set aside in a small plastic baggie attached to our order.\n5. Workmanship: everything comes back looking and smelling clean and sharp. They've never torn anything or even lost a button. All stains I've alerted them to have been marked and removed with no damage to the garments. \n6. No chemical smells. Usually they have the doors open, but there's never any smell that I've noticed. \n7. Timely: orders are ready the next day no matter what time you drop them off. They will tell you \"after 5pm\" but usually they are ready to be picked up after 3. \n8. Reasonably priced. Not the best deal in town, but good enough for our budget. This week we had 7 shirts and 5 pairs of pants and the bill was about $44. \n9. Reserved parking, there are at least three spaces reserved for their customers, which is great in this busy shopping center. \n10. They recycle.

The first time out of convenience and the second time because the first visit was so good. \n\nBetween the two visits I tried:\nA small house salad which was fresh, served on a chilled plate and had homemade blue cheese dressing. \nA turkey club which had guacamole, chipotle mayo, bacon, pepper jack cheese, plenty of good quality turkey on toasted 9-grain bread. \nA burger on a butter-toasted bun with my choice of guacamole,carmelized onions and bacon. It was clearly not a frozen patty and was cooked perfectly medium and juicy. \n\nEverything I ate was of very good quality, tasty and was matched with prompt and friendly service.

The restaurant closes at 9, so i figured they would be rude and try to rush us out.  However, the exact opposite happened.  David, the manager, waited on us and made us feel very welcome.  \n\nMy grandma is one of the most annoying people to wait on, but David was courteous, answered all of her questions, and she was able to order exactly what she wanted.  I asked for a hamburger, but instead of a beef hamburger, for a piece of salmon - which was not on the menu.  But David obliged and it was a delicious salmon burger with a very nice side salad for like 10 bucks.  My fiance' and grandma had the portobello melts which were pretty awesome for what they are - they came with grilled onions on them and almost tasted like a real hamburger.  My grandpa had veggie quesadallia which was a huge freakin portion and loaded with veges and cheese.\n\nI will be back here due to the service, quantity of food, taste of food, vegetarian options, and price of food.

You are transported back to a time when a gallon of gas cost $.18c , and life seemed...well, cheaper.\n\nThere is a reason why ZAGAT has awarded 5&Diner \"top family restaurant,\" for its fun and child friendly atmosphere - as well as winning accolades from AOL City Guide, The Rep, Phoenix Magazine, and New Times  for \"best cheap eats, breakfast, best diner, hamburger, and best late night dining\"\n\nThis particular location is only open until 11p, but there are other valley locations such as the 16th street diner that are open for 24 hours, and I have been there on numerous occasions with the after-bar crowd to feast on one of their 12 signature burgers such as the \"Blue Moon Burger\" \n\nShakes, malts, chocolate sodas, pies, burgers, and fries...you know what to expect from a diner, and you will get it!", "business_id": "kOh8ZHf8CkFQCwyfDvVJTA", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-05-31", "type": "review"}

I made even more fun of him when he showed me $80 worth of vouchers he'd bought on Amazon Local. Who goes to the 5 & Diner? Apparently he does. \n\nSo we went to the 5 & Diner.\nAnd it was really good.\n\nPickle chips! A whole star just for having these! They were delicious.\n\nI had the \"Diner Dip\"; the meat was nothing special but the bun was soft (I can't count how many places give me a hard-as-a-rock bun on French dips) and the horseradish sour cream was yummy. Boyfriend had some kind of burger, and it was one hell of a burger for under $10; this thing was literally 6 inches tall and densely packed with meat, jalapenos, cheese, and onion rings between Texas toast. He lapsed into a happy food coma quite quickly. French fries were perfectly cooked and tasted fresh. \n\nThe shakes... oh, the shakes. We had the Reeses Peanut Butter Cup as a malt. It was amazing. Chunks of peanut butter cups at the bottom even!  I loved that they had about 20 flavors, ranging from butterscotch to raspberry to chocolate cherry, and all could be done as malts, soda floats, or just regular shakes. So many options!\n\nEverything came out super fast; 5 minutes on the pickle chips and another 5 for our sandwiches. I was astounded to find it had come out like lightning without being held under lamps; they literally cook that quickly. \n\nOh, and now I have to rave about our server: She was the sweetest girl I've ever seen in food service. She was genuinely so nice, not the fake front most servers (including myself) put on, that I was incredibly impressed. She had to take my iPhone to do our voucher and it was crazy to see how carefully she handled it and presented it back to me. I enjoyed her pleasant demeanor so much that I left 40% for tip (and even perfect service will rarely warrant more than a 20% tip from me, because most of them have the aforementioned sickeningly sweet fake front).\nI didn't catch her name, but she had black hair and a nose stud, and worked on Tuesday night, so management please give kudos to her :)", "business_id": "kOh8ZHf8CkFQCwyfDvVJTA", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-03-13", "type": "review"}

We thought it was a good place to suggest 3 of my friends join me last night. after a long day of diving over 900 miles in one shot and loading and off loading a 25 foot moving truck, we wanted a change from the spots along the highway.\n\nMy first impression when we walked in the door was it smelled like a greasy sewer. I headed to the rest room to wash my hands. It was gross and the rest room was even worse. I even noticed little deodorizers like the ones in the urinals in some unusual places outside the restroom. Humm. Makes you wonder!\n\nWe sat and waited for others to join us. We were parked in the second to the east corner booth, by the kitchen door and milk shake machine. We were hungry and tired. Once our party joined us, we ordered.  It was not a complex or difficult order.... 3 french toast orders and I had small diner salad, half tuna and soup of the day. \n\nThe place was far from busy and most other patrons were already eating. It took every bit of 25 minutes or more to get our food. The server Mike (receipt said a different foreign name)  had no clue how to serve, never brought us our utensils, forgetting parts of the order. \n\nBut the part I am really complaining and disgusted about and warning to others has to deal with what we all witnessed crawling all around us.\n\n First, while we were waiting for our food, I watched a roach, yes roach, la cucaracha, crawl on the wall under the counter bar where you can sit. He cruised all around there. Several in our party were somewhat grossed out. Still waiting on our food, a second person in our party notices another one on the floor under the table (booth) adjacent to us where a nice family of 5 were sitting. We did not want to start a panic and said nothing. Ok, this is getting a bit freaky. Then, just before our food came, the more squeamish in our group of us male outdoorsmen, sees a third one behind me, crawling up the wall. That did it. Several told the waiter to return the food to the kitchen and get the manager while the others 2 ate with reluctance.  \n\nBottom line, if you want a marginal meal served in a piss poor manner in a smelly environment, with a triple side of roaches, you got to try this place. By the way,  we were compt our meal and tipped our server a little something but this place has lost what amounts to or will amount to 50 patrons. adios la cucarachas!", "business_id": "kOh8ZHf8CkFQCwyfDvVJTA", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-04-15", "type": "review"}

There's an elementary school on one side (it's really only the screaming that bothers me), and Hayden road on the other. This has bothered me more over time instead of less. There are a few dogs that bark in the morning and night, and with the way the buildings face each other, the barks feel like they echo like in a cave.

The apartments are slightly older, but are well maintained. I've never lived in an apartment with such ethical, responsive staff. Maintenance generally comes the day after a request is submitted, and the office staff notifies you if maintenance determines that they need to order a part that will take a few days to arrive. The management changed about six months ago, but I have not noticed any differences in quality or responsiveness since the switch. \n\nA couple of things to keep in mind: \n\n1) This place is pretty good when it comes to bugs, but there are mosquitos outside and I have seen a couple of roaches over the two years I've been here. I know that sounds terrifying, but realistically, you are going to have occasional roaches pretty much anywhere you live in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area, and this apartment has WAY fewer roaches than most. The mosquito thing is an issue because, in the one-bedroom model, there are no windows in the kitchen/living area, so if you burn something in the oven, you have to choose between letting the mosquitos in and having a super smoky living area. \n\n2) The pool is beautiful and well-maintained (one of the previous reviews complained that the pool is difficult to swim laps in and the pool gates have locks that stick - I have never encountered either of those issues). \n\n3) The shelves in the kitchen cupboards are not moveable. If you are the type of person who cooks, I would recommend against living in the smaller sized two bedroom layout, because the kitchen does not have a pantry and the immovable shelves make it difficult to find space for your cutting boards, cereal, flour canisters, etc. The kitchen in the one-bedroom or larger two-bedroom model is better.\n\n4) Contrary to their advertising/pricing, this is by no means a \"luxury\" apartment. The prices fluctuate a lot and are occasionally outrageous for what this apartment is. I ended up moving out because I wanted to transfer to a two-bedroom, and in the ten days it took me to make up my mind, they raised to price of the unit I was interested in from $1250/month to $1475, which was way too high for what Miramonte has to offer.\n\n5) This is the best apartment I've ever lived in.

And no one was particularly helpful. \n\nWhen we stopped in and explained what it was we needed, they were quick to offer a few suggestions. After narrowing it down to two possible options we decided on a Nikon P100. My wife was very hesitant to spend such a large sum of money. However the people we talked to did a very good job of easing her anxiety and guided us in the right direction. \n\nThe service and help was excellent. The prices were good, and the support after the sale is fantastic. All their cameras come with a free hour lesson, and a manufactures extended warranty. They handle, and file all the paperwork. They also offer classes, that I believe are free. \n\nOverall I am very impressed with this service. And on my next purchase (hopefully a nice DSLR for fun) I will be going back.

This place cannot compete with AMAZON or EBAY, and it's not just because of competitive prices, it has to do with attitude. They are nickel and dimers at this shop, and the markup on every item is ridiculous. 7 dollars for a pack of AA batteries? 100% markup on point and shoots? That's just too much in this day in age.\n\nThe reason this place is still around is because it's a historic store in Scottsdale, the shop itself has been there for like 50 years, they have a lot of senior citizens people who go there to get their ancient film processed and to shoot the breeze, and honestly that is what is keeping this place open. The old folks who don't know what Amazon is and who don't care about spending 10 bucks for a AAA battery, they are keeping this place's lights on.\n\nI love when a small business can offer something fresh and new compared to the big giant guys, but seriously...the markup here is just crazy, and with sites like amazon, eBay, even craigslist...with perfectly good gear, for hundreds of dollars less? It makes no sense to pay so much. The selling point this store has is that they will give you personalized service and teach you how to use a camera...okay, well that still doesn't justify overpaying hundreds of dollars. Considering YOUTUBE and the free, easy ways to learn camera work, it just doesn't really cut it ya know? Does that mean that the markup is basically covering the cost of an extremely pricey \"how to use your camera\" session?\n\nAnyways, there are better deals to be found, and in this modern day paying too much for something is not cool. I also find it very tacky that the owners respond to yelp reviews with such a standoffish attitude...If you are getting low reviews, it isn't because yelp is evil, it's because people are seeing a pattern of not-so-good service.

Each and every time, we are greeted like family.  Denise even remembers our order!  Well, to be honest, every customer is greeted like family.  That is one of the many reasons we can't stay away.\n\nThe decor is unpretentious, and the wood-paneled, nostalgia-filled walls tell the story of years of being a staple in the community.  Don't be surprised if you are offered a taste of whatever is being sliced behind the counter - thank you again Joe, for that Provolone!  :)\n\nReady to taste a little bit of heaven?  Order the Hot Italian Beef with Provolone.  Served on a soft yet slightly crisp roll with a side of Au Jus, I struggle to find words to describe how good this sandwich is.  Just try it.  You won't be sorry.  \n\nMaybe money can't buy you love, but it can get you a fantastic meal - Casella's is cash-only.\n\nI have decided that I want to be adopted by the Casella family.  Sorry mom, but if you ever taste one of Casella's sandwiches, you will understand...", "business_id": "kEyCMHBnohaWc81omLDfYg", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-04-01", "type": "review"}

Since there is nothing around the Goodyear area, I didn't mind driving 30 minutes to visit this place.\n\nEverything about my sandwich gave the impression that the food was fresh and not greasy or stale, like Subway.  The bread was soft with a slight crispiness.  Although, a little flaky, it wasn't hard or tough.\n\nThe sauce and the meatballs were obviously created by hand and had not been frozen or left to sit for a long period of time.  Freezing meatballs can sometimes make them rubbery and tough, but these were pleasantly moist and appetizing.\n\nThe cheese that was included with the sandwich mixed well with the other ingredients and didn't overpower or distract from the overall enjoyment.\n\nAfter discovering that we had driven from Goodyear, they invited us to sample some of their homemade salads.\n\nEven though I was full of meatballs at this point, I agreed.\n\nI am a meat and potatoes type of guy, but I can safely say that their salads are delicious.\n\nI don't know what they put in them, but each salad was delectable and refreshing.  \n\nOn those hot summer days, I would recommend the pasta or \"healthy\" salad.  Both were cool and light and would help to beat the heat, so to speak.\n\nIf you're looking for something more rich and hearty, I would recommend the chicken salad.  I am nowhere near a chicken salad expert or critic, but this stuff was pretty damn good.  The flavor was unique and satisfying and the chicken was tender and well-cooked.\n\nFor an establishment to be in business for over 35 years, it takes skill, expertise and, of course, great food.\n\nCasella's exhibits all of these things.  It has a great family atmosphere and they make you feel like a long lost cousin.\n\nCasella's Italian Delicatessen easily vies for the top spot in the Greater Phoenix area for Italian eateries.\n\nDo not hesitate to visit.", "business_id": "kEyCMHBnohaWc81omLDfYg", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-03-29", "type": "review"}

They did not slice the meat in front of me like I am used to with deli's the meat was in a cooler with the cheeses and condiments.  The same lady who does the cash register also makes your sandwiches and she does not wear gloves or washes her hands, very disgusting to eat food which someone handles money and then makes your sandwich without washing their hands.  The cashier did mention everything is homemade by her father which I had to wonder since they have boxes of food in their freezer not home made but the cheescake comes from someplace else.  The salads and rice pudding looked disgusting.  I know they just celebrated their 38th year but I wish they went back to when they had the slicer out and sliced the meats in front of you and washed their hands before service.  Not a good place to go for fresh food.  The hero was good my friend said I told him I would not eat it because the lady had dirty hands, but he ate it and like it.  if you go ask the lady to wash her hands first, not sure if she will but then ask her to use gloves if they have none, then you know what kind of establishment it is.  Good heros bad etiquette. They operate the same way as subway except subway employees wear gloves.  Want an authentic NY Hero from Subway just bring in a Hoagie roll and they will make you a sandwich, it is all about the bread. Casellas also raised their prices now a 6 inch Hero with roast beef and cheese is $7.65... no more $6 Heros.

We had free passes.\n\nMy fiance's work gave him two sets of Regal movie tickets.  That would be great back in Seattle where the company is because Regal's are all over.  Here, however, there are only two theaters in the Regal family and this is one of them.  The other is on Northsight somewhere.\n\nWe saw a 645 movie and it was all old folks.

The screen wasn't all that large, the sound was awful, and it was an \"old school\" theater.  I consider a \"new school\" theater to be one with stadium seating.  This theater you actually walked uphill when walking towards the screen.  Sounds backwards to me!  It actually might have been worse than a regular \"old school\" theater.  If we hadn't had free passes, we would have left.  Instead, we stayed and toughed it out.  \n\nI guess we'll venture to the Northsight location for the other two tickets.

Normally, when you order a skillet meal, it is blanketed in cheese (which is the best part in my opinion)....I had to go on a search and rescue mission just to find the cheese in this dish!  I think they had used a whole tablespoon of cheese that they plopped in the very middle and covered up with the scrambled eggs.  Seriously?  What a joke, I think a lactose intolerant person could have eaten this dish and had no reaction!  So I sat there and at raw onions with no cheese and eggs with a weird texture that were five degrees away from being cold, not the breakfast of champions I had imagined.

This is Andrew's fifth play there and this time he plays the Knave in Alice in Wonderland.\nNormally, we don't ask for a specific role but the director of Annie Jr. thought he would be cute as the Dormouse as he popped up from the table so that's what we asked for this time during audition.\nAnd we anxiously waited for the casting to be posted.  When the casting was posted, he did not get the requested part and as a mom and a parent, I was glad.\nWhy you may ask?  Because to me as a mom and a parent, it's very important to teach my son the importance of handling success with graciousness and moving through disappointments with a positive attitude.  When he asked why he didn't get the part, I told him in simple words that the director had a vision of what the whole play should be like and she saw Andrew in the role of Knave and that was his special role.  I also told him that it doesn't matter what role you get, if you play it with all you got and go out there and perform with your heart as there are no small parts, you will capture the audience's attention and that will be your moment.\nHe listened with a typical 5 year old attitude and became very excited about being the Knave.  And I was also excited for him because this time around, he had 2 long lines to memorize and speak!\nWith each review, I've written about how Andrew has grown through DST and here I've included a video where you can see him growing aware of theatre and performance:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsG07sMlZ5s&feature=related.  This time around, he started asking me if he was a main character, starting to understand the structure of a performance.  It was great to see his awareness growing.  I highly recommend bringing your own child to audition for a play here.  \nIt will be an amazing experience!!\nReally, DST is about the kids.  Trusting the kids to do their part and giving them responsibilities.  Once the curtain lifts, the kids are responsible for THEIR performance and for each other.  It's fantastic to see the kids have their moments on stage, being responsible for moving and arranging the set, take care of the tech, go from loose energy backstage to fanstatic actors on stage.  It's all fabulous.\nIf you have doubts of what kids can do, go to a show at Desert Stages Theatre and be amazed.  Truly, if you believe in your kids, as DST shows again and again, your kids will shine and raise above your expectations!", "business_id": "VlHp9AFc9repIF6braYCCg", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-03-14", "type": "review"}

I explained to her what usually happens as the cashier gives it to me for half off.. she then proceeded to ask me which cashier was doing that, 'it's not our policy.'\nAfter going back and forth for a few minutes I finally just told her to give me my 2 bucks.. she told me if I would have brought them the receipt back the same day they would have done something about it. Are you f-ing kidding me? Whats the difference besides my being inconvenienced having to drive back there. So I finally asked her if she was willing to lose a potential lifetime customer over 2 bucks? She responded, 'there's nothing I can do for you.'

They put lots of meat on the sub so you won't feel jipped. The meat is of very high quality compared to most sub joints (my Italian sub had prosciutto on it).

My friend highly recommended Dr. Ryan since her and her boyfriend had been going to him for years. I was seriously blown away. I guess I never had a good dentist in 26 years. I have to say it was a life changing experience. Extreme, I know, but I have never left a dentist's office feeling so educated about my mouth. Vicki was my hygienist and I must say that was the most thorough cleaning I have ever experienced. She even showed me how to properly floss and brush my teeth. As dentistry advances I guess normal dentists do not educate you on the new and improved techniques, but Dr. Ryan's office really takes their time with you. You can tell that they care about your overall health and want to teach you healthy habits that will stick for life. Just by looking in my mouth, which I thought was super healthy, they could tell that I am a smoker, drink a little bit too much, and have a lot of stress. The things they pointed out about how stress was affecting my mouth, jaw muscles, and neck muscles seriously opened my eyes. I never realized that the reason I was waking up with a temporary sore throat in the morning or when my cheek muscles hurt when touched was because I was clenching my teeth. I have since started using a heating pad to relax the muscles like Vicki suggested and guess what... I've been cured! That and a little yoga. I would highly recommend this office to anyone.

First, let me state the obvious: custom framing is not cheap. I had spent over $200 to frame a couple pieces of beautiful & intricate artwork that I had bought overseas, while working in Africa. I was VERY excited to see the finished pieces, and so was waiting impatiently for the phone call from Michael's. The phone call never came, but the anticipated date of completion (yesterday) arrived, so I stopped in anyway to see if the pieces were done. The customer service rep at the custom framing desk asked for my name, and pulled out the finished pieces. I asked if they had been done for awhile, because I was curious how long they'd been sitting there completed, while I was eagerly awaiting a phone call. She told me that they were completed on the 7th, two days prior, and told me that from the notes on the sheet, someone had called me that day. My cell phone, which I NEVER turn off, was listed as the number to call. I had not received a phone call from Michael's, nor was there a missed call, nor was there a voice mail message. I politely responded, \"I'm sorry, but no one called.\" To which she countered, \"Yes, they did.\" To which I again responded, \"I'm sorry, but they didn't.\" To which she again said, \"Yes, they did.\" This went on for a few rounds before she said, \"Well, phones are very strange these days.\" REALLY? You are going to argue with a customer who just spent over $200 on a custom framing job, insisting that I received a phone call I DID NOT receive?\n\nIt doesn't end there. I wasn't 100% happy with the way my artwork appeared in the frame and the mat, so the framing manager was called to the desk to speak with me. The tenor of this second conversation was exactly the same.\n\nMe: \"The edge of the artwork is closer to edge of the mat than I was expecting. I was hoping for a little more white space.\"\n\nFraming manager: \"That was the edge of the picture; it was the only way to frame it.\"\n\nMe: \"I bought the artwork, I remember what it looked like, and the edge of the picture was not that close to the top of the page.\"\n\nFraming manager: \"Yes, it was.\"\n\nMe: \"Again, I bought the artwork. I remember what it looked like. Maybe it was cut before it was framed?\"\n\nFraming manager: \"We never cut artwork here. I'm the one that framed it. I know what it looked like. This was the only way it could be framed.\"\n\nThis also continued for a few more rounds. Aside from this minor issue, I was actually pleased with how the artwork looked, so I ended up taking it home as is, but I was SERIOUSLY disappointed by the haughty and argumentative attitudes of the staff, as if I was personally insulting them by suggesting that I did not receive the expected phone call, and that my artwork was perhaps not framed 100% as I expected.\n\nWorst customer service experience I've had in a LONG time.", "business_id": "OXJZlVOYZwyrf5cHLmfStw", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-04-10", "type": "review"}

Goldwater.\n\nOld town location:\nPros:\n-Ladies always get in free, no matter what time of night.\n-Sandwhiches, bottled water, and roses await the patrons as they leave the bar at the end of the night, gratis.\n-Music is very diverse, and bound to please every patron at least once\n\nCons:\n-Dance floor is so packed by 11pm you can forget about venturing out there\n-Crowd is younger, college age crowd\n-Sometimes you can stand in line for an hour, because they pack them in and don't \nsend anybody packing\n- if you are looking to sit back and relax, forget it! there's too many people\n\nNorth Location:\n\nPros: \n-Two for One Drinks all day and all night on Thursdays, until 8pm on Friday\n-all appetizers are half off on fridays until 10p\n-More space\n-Mature crowd, see more thirty somethings and up\n-Music evolves and alternates all night from techno, rock, disco, to hip hop, middle eastern, salsa...\n-Food served until 10pm, and it is delicious!\n\nCons:\n-I can't think of any\n\nHaving stated the previous... Devil's is posh, 80% of the patrons are dressed to the nines and looking like they just got airbrushed, everyone is friendly and just wants to partake in the baccinalia, the drinks are strong (though pricey), the dance floor is flooded with john travoltas and pussycat dolls, and half the people there are looking for late night rendez-vous.\nThere is a VIP area with its own bar, where the DJ booth is located.  Three other bars are found within the club, and there are also private cabanas for rent.  With the cabanas, you have private table, curtain optional, with a bottle of Dom P. and 10 of your closest friends, which is $300.  Basically, you are paying $30 per person, and they get in free at the door and get to drink your expensive champagne, too.\nI have met and boogied with some of the most interesting characters...Physcial therapists in training from Scotland, Aussie backpackers, multi-million dollar entrepreneurs, and a flurry of beautiful young women escaping the humdrum to headbang to AC/DC.\n\n*Hints:\nbest night to go for drinks is thursdays, when it is two for one, but there aren't as much people\nfriday nights it is busy and fun, but you will notice an older crowd\nsaturday nights tend to be the younger crowds, and i notice that i don't have as much fun\narrive early. 8:30 isn't even early here. by 9pm the tables are removed, the chairs gone from the bar. by 9:30 the first people are hitting the dance floor. by 10pm people are standing in line to get in, and the cover charge begins.", "business_id": "M0Pch3_-Gvj45RN1U4I35Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-05-28", "type": "review"}

It was a Thursday, 2 for 1 drinks til midnight, but I thank my good time to the company I was in and the lovely people watching the crowd here provided. \n\nLet's start with problem numero uno- The place is located in a Safeway shopping center... no joke! So get your groceries and come shake your booty all in one trip ;) Now I know Scottsdale has a rep, and to be honest, I do enjoy surrounding myself in that scene once in a while but seriously could not get over the fact that while sitting on their \"posh\" patio, I was watching the cart boy rounding up stray shopping carts. Location location location, this place fails miserably at that. \n\nThe drinks were okay... call me crazy but I actually prefer to taste some alcohol in my martini. \n\nAnd the decor in the place was a joke! You walk in to a big open room... think Rocky Pointe spring break style back in HS when you went to those 20$ all you can drink parties. All that was missing was the video crew recording the raunchy females, cougars in this case. The chairs/seating in the car were cheap looking and overall reminded me of Ikea.\n\nOn the plus side, it was pretty busy but chill enough were my friends and I could enjoy each others company without being knocked into by others.\n\nFor wanting a chill night with great people watching this place is great. But please get over your posh sophisticated attitude because you are far from it and the place would actually have more potential if you realized it. My favorite part of the night... A cougar with a much older sugar daddy. She walks away from daddy to be swept away my 20someyhing boy toy, only to turn around, and hang her purse on daddy before heading to the dance floor to grind on the boy. Poor daddy was left outside, purse and all, looking like a fool. Made for decent people watching. I sadly left and don't know the outcome of this.... If you were there last night and saw these scene please do tell :)", "business_id": "M0Pch3_-Gvj45RN1U4I35Q", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-05-04", "type": "review"}

So... we headed to the store.\n\nWe were used to the introductions upon entering furniture stores by the sales associates, followed by the occasional \"how are you doing?\" and \"can I help you with anything\"s.

My wife and I had ZERO opportunity to chat amongst ourselves during the entire 20-30 minutes we were in the store.  We consistently made eye contact with each other, trying to figure out how we were going to squirm away from this guy.  Finally, we escaped and needless to say, never went back or bought anything.

It had 3 stains on it that I had pre treated with organic products. The stains were removed by me but were replaced with water rings where they used to be. I explained this the sales associate and it was noted on my account. Four days later my husband picked up the cleaning only for the robe to return to me (not in the condition it was taken there in). The robe now had 3 white spots where the silk color was removed and a snag by one of the white spots. I have photos of the robe before I took it in and I never saw white spots or a snag on it. I immediately sent an email to both owners stating my complaint and what had happened. Two days later I received a condescending, lengthy email stating that I rubbed out the color when I pre treated it, and that it was my fault for the white spots on the robe. \nThe white spots were not there when I dropped it off, neither was the snag. Why would I bring a garment in that had white spots all over it... to have them do WHAT? Also, the snag they created was never addressed by the owner in the email. \n\nMy garment is ruined. I understand that not all water stains can be removed however; I did not expect for the color to be rubbed out of my silk garment nor was I informed that that could happen. I also did not expect to have the silk snagged while it was there. What I don't understand is how one spot wasn't treated and tested first in order to see how it reacts to their treatment. Instead all the spots were treated therefore resulting in three different white spots. \nAfter exchanging several emails with the owner and filing a complaint with the BBB I received 4 calls (all on the same day) from the sales associate who originally helped me. I eventually called her back and she passed the phone to the person who cleaned my garment who then stated she saw color loss on the item when they went to treat it but did not contact me and proceeded to treat the garment. Although she apologized for this I still know that there were no white spots on my item or a snag on it when I took it there.

I specifically went to this cleaner because I wanted to ensure that my dress was in good hands and assumed the high prices meant quality and dependability, and I was very wrong. \n\nI brought in a dress to be cleaned for a special occasion, one in which was out of state, and needed by a specific day and time before my flight. Two hours before my dress was to be ready for pick up I received a phone call saying that they unfortunately put a solution on my dress they were unable to remove. I was told my dress was not only not going to be ready, but that it could be completely ruined. They said they needed to soak it for 24 hours to try to undo the damage. I agreed as I really had no option, and was stuck having to make arrangements to make a quick trip to the mall while I was at my destination for the occasion. This was an additional expense and time I did not have prior to the event. Not only that, the solution didn't work, and my beautiful dress was destroyed.\n\nWhen I arrived back to town I went into the cleaner to pick up my damaged dress and talk to them about the reimbursement for it. They offered me way below 50% of the value of the dress and told me that because due to \"depreciation\" it wasn't worth more, and continued to tell me that because it wasn't replaceable that it should be worth less, not more. I refused to settle for the insult offer, and was told to wait even longer for a resolution. The owner said that he would need to talk to his \"staff\" to determine if I deserved more for their error. If I would have been told the dress could have been ruined with a cleaning, I absolutely would have not opted for it. Not only does this place lack in quality, the customer service and disregard for people and their concerns is absurd. If I could rate them zero stars I would.

My boyfriend bought my setting for my engagement ring here, everything was good, layaway went smooth, and picked it up....\n\nNow here comes the issue he found the diamond he wanted online, went to the store asked if they could order it in and no change in price. They told him it was no problem made sure it was available. They then proceeded to show him less quality and NOT GIA certified diamonds. Half hour after they try and convince him that diamond is not what he wants,and  about how you want inclusions so you can identify your diamond, he still wanted the one he found online. So they went to the back ordered it and he put a large payment on it until it arrived. Well no word comes of it being recieved, so at this point he calls and no one returns his call. Next day gets a call well that diamond must have accidentaly been sold... Basically it came down to they did not want to sell it at the price that is was online. (which was according to them alot less that it was supposed to be) So after trying and pushing him to buy something less quality for more we found somewhere else. Not only did we get a reasonable price they explained everything to us and did not treat us like nobodies.

We finally found what we wanted at the Shane Co. We ordered the ring and now we're waiting two months for it to be made. Since the ring was custom made we paid for it in advance. We then paid half of the cost of the diamond in advance to hold it for two months while they make the ring. We didn't realize that they considered our diamond to be on \"layaway\" until we received a letter saying they're going to put our diamond back in the store for sale (even though its half paid for). We spent considerable time on the phone arguing with different people that don't have a clue what they're doing. Its obvious that they don't care about the diamond ring. They can't answer any of our questions about the progress of the ring. They're just focused on getting a \"layaway\" payment for a ring that is mostly paid for. I finally got tired of arguing with them so I paid the rest of it off to avoid them harassing us again for another \"layaway\" payment or putting the diamond back up for sale. The young inexperienced kids they hire have ruined the jewelry buying experience for us. Since this ring purchase was for a wedding anniversary we expected it be a good positive experience. Instead it's been a very negative experience. We don't even know who our sales person was because they swapped us off to different people so many times during the buying process. Today we asked to talk to the manager and were told they don't have one working today. Instead of focusing on their jewelry and customer service they're focusing on harassing us for a little \"layaway\" payment. Someone should teach their staff that their supposed to be helping people celebrate life experiences with their fine jewelry. I hate dealing with the Shane Company kids.

If she ever breaks it or any of the stones fall out (including the main stone) they replace it for free.  Free sizings for life, free cleaning and touch ups if the white gold ever needs to be redipped...

I decided due to sizing, cleaning, and various other things I would stick with white gold or platinum. As usual the staff is incredible, knowledgeable, friendly, and very helpful. Within a half hour we picked out a ring for me and sent it out for sizing. Upon picking it up it was still a little loose, and I was aware the sizing bands aren't always true to fit due to the very flat shape they have. So we sent it back out to have it taken down another half a size, smooth easy process. The ring was ready within 72 hours.   Then I decided to chat with a clerk at the front on my way out about scratching, regular cleanings, ect. She then informed me if I decide I want to try a different style of brushing on my ring when I bring it in for cleaning there are multiple styles I can try, and they are all free with my included warranty.

I went to many of the jewelry stores inside the local mall. The different sales people that I interacted with we're all very polite and helpful but I honestly felt like after I explain to them what I was looking for they picked it up and ran with the best way to pad their commission check. I understand a lot of jewelry stores pay their employees on commission, so I don't fault them for that. I do however fault them for the broken promises of not calling me back when tbey said they would. I just felt very uneasy every time I left one of the stores and I was very happy that I did not go through and make the purchase with one of the other companies before I went to Shane Co. \n\nI knew what my fiance was looking for in style and color. I checked out the  Shane Co website, and yes I found her perfect ring! YAY ME!!!  I went into the Scottsdale location with just a downloaded picture from the website and a item number. The first sales rep that I dealt with had told me that the ring was not available at that location but that he would have it shipped in by the end of the week. Sure enough I had a phone call within 3 or 4 business days as I was promised that the  ring was in the store. You know what they say in that song \" life is what happens when you are busy making other plans\". Life happened I never forgot about that ring.  It  honestly had been about two and a half months since I made it back to the store. I went in there on Monday April 21, 2014  and the sales lady Laura had told me that the ring may have just been shipped out. I was fully prepared to start all over again trying to find the \"next\" one perfect ring for my fiance. She had told me she may have  thought it was still in the back room. She returned about 5 mins later with the ring in her hand. She then asked the standard questions, what kind of center diamond what I like? What  is the price range that I was willing to spend that kind of thing. I had told her that I wanted to spend $3,000-$4,000 max. She then showed me the type of center stone that I was looking for, and a size that was well within my budget. after about a half hour, which went by incredibly fast, I had my fiance's perfect ring all ordered and ready to go. \n\nI have to recommend anybody who may be looking for that one perfect ring for their fiance, or any type of jewelry to put Shane Co.  at the top of the list. The way I was treated made me feel like I was somebody special when in reality I am not. I had just gone into the store after running some errands, and I fully did not plan on going into any type of jewelry store. I was wearing sandals cargo shorts a t-shirt in an old ratty sun bleached Sun Devil hat. They didn't treat me any differently then if I had gone into the store where in a brand new Armani suit. I cannot say enough great things about my entire experience from start to finish with every single person that works at the Scottsdale Shane Co\n\nGuys do yourself a huge favor, and as you search the internet, much like I did, looking for that perfect engagement ring/ wedding set,  when it comes time to actually go into a store, make sure your first stop is your local Shane Co. I can not promise you will find that one perfect ring, but at least give them a shot. \n\nI will be going back for many years to come.  If I could I would rate Shane Co higher then five stars. Yelp, you need to see about changing that. I will so give it the highest rating possible \n\nAddition To My Review:\n\nI keep odd hours, and my schedule and traditional business hours rarely mesh. I had some follow up questions so I went to the Shaneco.com site. I left a message in the general voice mail box. As before, I had a very prompt return call the very next day. For better or worse, my call came across the desk of a VERY HELPFUL employee named Angela.  Through a series of phone tag and voice messages, she answered every single question. She is another fine example of the extremely high caliber of employees that Shane Co. have on staff. Just like earlier in my review, anyone who is out there looking for some great quality jewelry, and very reasonable prices, head into your local Shane Co. location, and at the very least, see what they can do to help with whatever you are looking for. Hopefully you will not be disappointed, I can honesty say that I am not. They genuinely have a very loyal customer for life.  \n\nGood luck to you in your searches for that perfect piece of jewelry.", "business_id": "BUsmaloKEZeOvXLrSjKWSQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-04-28", "type": "review"}

While friendly, the awkward questions began quickly....\"So, how long have you been together?\" and \"Do your families know you are shopping?\"  Weird. \n\nAt Shane Co, the settings are empty and they drop in a loose diamond for you to look at. We asked to look at a few loose diamonds, which prompted a switch of sales people. The next associate came out with 3 diamonds to look at. We were reminded that they do not work on commission so no pressure. \n\nDiamond sales gal asked us to look at the 3 options, but not to mix them. I later found out the prices (color, clarity, cut etc.) ranged from $3000-$10000 in the stones we were looking at. However, the associate couldn't tell the difference between the 3 when they were accidentally mixed up. Hmmmm. \n\nEmployees became extremely pushy toward the end of our visit; asking how much of a deposit we'd like to put down. No thank you!\n\nI will not return to Shane Co.

So our experience has been pretty widespread.  I will cover 4 areas: safety, facility, curriculum, cost and odds-n-ends.\n\nLets start with safety.  You can always find state inspections on the state website for licensed child-care facilities.  These inspections will tell you a lot of useless things but will also provide light on some useful things such as if there is a valid fire safety plan and are all of the teacher background checked and fingerprinted.  The state inspection for Scottsdale Child Care and Learning Center (SLC) as of summer 2009 was just about as good as it gets.  Keep in mind that every facility will have a few citations.  This is how the state makes money.  The other safety feature I liked about this school is that there is only one entrance/exit door and that is through the front.  So the likelihood of a run-away child is nearly impossible.     \n\nFacility: \nI think the facility here is nice.  The rooms for older classes are bigger and therefore in my opinion better.  They have nice size outdoor play areas and adequate shade which is important for AZ.  They have a separate dining area for the kids which is nice too.  My only complaint is that most of the younger rooms smell like a diaper pail.  I'm not sure why the smell is so strong since I saw them taking the trash out multiple times a day, but I really did not like the odor.  I know that there are diapered kids in the room, but in 6 daycare facilities we've attended, this one was the only one with a very strong diaper odor.   Not a deal breaker, but something to consider.   My child hated this odor and it made morning drop-off very difficult for us. \n\nCurriculum: \nThe curriculum here is OK.  Of note, strength of curriculum is related to strength of teachers.  I think they had a mix of mediocre teachers and really good teachers, like most schools.  I think that NAEYC accredited facilites have the best curriculum.  The director here said that they are very familiar with NAEYC and that they follow many NAEYC standards, but I didn't find this to be so.  They are not officially NAEYC accredited.  The other problem was that they shift students around from class to class to maintain the highest ratio legally possible.  While this allows them to aggregate kids in one room to release teachers early, and save on operating costs, it doesn't provide for a cohesive curriculum when there are different teachers in the classroom at any given time. Also, if your child gets moved to a different room to help maintain ratios, then their curriculum changes.     The one thing that I absolutely did not like about the curriculum was that they had two \"movie\" times daily.  Really, it ended up being TV time.  My feeling is that on rainy days or special occasions, watching a movie at school is ok, but twice daily is more than I think should be normal.  Other extra-curriculuare classes that they have are dance and computers which you have to pay extra for.\n\nCost: \nI don't know what the current cost is exactly.  You can go to the website or call the school and find out.  But I did think it was a great deal.  The daily/weekly rate includes for full-day, almost 11 hours of care per day.  Ideally none of us should have to have our kids in child-care for so long, but if you are working and work far, this is a good option to have for those days when you have to go in early or just can't get out exactly on time.  There are only a very few facilities in the area with these hours.  Also, if you tell them ahead of time that you won' t be attending SLC for a vacation week or something, they will not charge you!   This is amazing.  The daily cost also includes hot lunch and diapers and wipes if your child is not potty trained.  This also is a true bonus for the working parent. \n\nOdds and Ends:  Overall I think this is a safe and wallet friendly place to send your children.  For its price point, I think it is the best value in the area.  If you work full time or long hours, it may be one of your only options in the area.  Things that I did not like were the TV times and the use of candy on a fairly regular basis as their rewards system.  I also think that some of the snacks were too sugary (froot loops and other sweet cereals).   I think the curriculum is mediocre but acceptable.  I think that the weakest point is that teachers schedules are so variable.  And for young ones that are attending a day-care, it is important to have daily consistency  with care-takers in lieu of being home with mom or dad.", "business_id": "OH_OHCsAual4kpWa85zl2A", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-04-03", "type": "review"}

The location would have worked out perfectly for our family. Lisa one of the directors gave me the tour and went over the curriculum for the two-year old classroom. As I was leaving the two-year old room one of the day care providers was wheeling in a television. I then was told that beginning with the two-year old room they get 20 minutes of TV time daily. There were Disney movies on the cart with the TV on it. I myself don't consider Disney an educational movie but everyone has different opinions. I was really disappointed with the TV time being part of the daily routine. I let Lisa know that I thought the daily TV time was a deal breaker for me. I personally feel that two, three, and four year olds do not need TV time incorporated into their daily routine. There are so many other educational things that could be done in place of this allotted time. Overall, the facility was ok but if I am paying for a service and part of that service is putting my child in front of the television everyday I think I'll pass. I hope the facility considers omitting TV time from their daily schedules in the future.", "business_id": "OH_OHCsAual4kpWa85zl2A", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-04-30", "type": "review"}

You'll have to hear about all that other stuff in someone else's review. \n\nLOVE their brunch!  We have been going to their brunches for years.  Groups from 4 to 12 of us have made the trip and it's always a favorite.  Last year my friend told me that when she called she was told they had stopped going brunches, but I actually overheard someone talking about going there for Easter. Lo and behold they are back on!  I talked with a girl there and she said it must have been a miscommunication as they always shut down during the off season (summer) and the length of time each year may be a bit different, but they are totally open for business right now.  \n\nBrunch is $32, or $34 if you include champagne, and really, why wouldn't you?  Service has never been anything but positively outstanding.  But the food is what really puts it over the top.  SO much food and so many great options.  More than you'll get at the Compass room, and at least as much as you'll get at Wrigley Mansion - but for half the price.  And because it's part of a resort, you can either chose to dress up, or go resort casual and you'll fit in with their other guests who may be catching a round of golf right after they eat.  \n\nYou can see a sample Sunday Brunch menu at http://www.orangetreegolfresort.com/pdfs/Sunday%20Brunch.pdf.  They also do special Brunches for Easter and Mother's day.  \n\nBe sure to call ahead to get reservations.  This is a popular spot with the locals as well as the guests and space may not always be available at the last minute.", "business_id": "40B5TbtZbiGV4blFR9S6Dw", "stars": 5, "date": "2007-04-04", "type": "review"}

It is on N.56th street and we live on N. 42nd street...so on a nice day...which is just about everyday here i can even ride my bike to the resort.

The restaurant is closed. Bar is closed. Pool bar is rarely open. Front desk - nice people but kind of clueless. I was there for a conference/meeting for 80 people. They seemed entirely overwhelmed by our large group. Rooms were given extremely late, promises that were made when the meeting was planned were absolutely not kept. The main thing is that there is NOWHERE on site to get a decent meal or a glass of wine. Not my idea of a resort. Our room looked like something out of 1982, even though we were promised all remodeled rooms. The weirdest thing was that the shampoo in the room smelled like bacon. No lie. My roommate and I both were horrified, so we had to pick up shampoo (and wine) at a local CVS. Ordering Domino's for dinner isn't my idea of room service or a resort, either.

It was a fantastic experience, and we are really happy that we chose to use that venue for our ceremony (reception was elsewhere).  The Orange Tree is an excellent place to reserve a block of rooms.  Their prices are unbeatable -- people who reserved rooms under our block rate paid $115+tax per night and $85+ tax per night if they caught the Black Friday special.  Also, the rooms are all suites, which is excellent if you have a lot of friends from out of town who want to share a room and also work really well for after parties.  The pool closes at 11pm, which is a bit of a bummer but I think pretty standard.  Also, the bar closes at 6pm, which is somewhat odd.  The ceremony venue was absolutely beautiful, and the staff were very nice and accommodating.  Jennifer Hoffman, the head of catering, is very on top of things.  I only had to ask her to do things once, and everything came together exactly as we had requested.  The bell staff are also very nice and accommodating.  The only reason that I gave the Orange Tree four stars, rather than five, was that the front desk seemed a bit disorganized.  I had asked that we have a room as close to the ceremony venue as possible.  They put us in Building 5, which was quite far from the ceremony venue.  I had put welcome bags at the front desk for our guests.  However, the front desk neglected to give them to five of our guests upon their arrival.  These are small details that didn't really detract from the overall experience, but were somewhat surprising given their overall excellent service.

I'm not much of a 'chain' eater-- but this was my boyfriend's family's pick for his graduation dinner.  It seems to be a family favorite.... which I can't say I really understand.  At all.  I also should mention that this review is based entirely on their only vegetarian dinner option.  \n\nI didn't get a look at the bill, but my course was at least over $25 for far less than exemplar fare. Granted, this included a miso soup, small lettuce & carrot salad, tofu appe, egg fried rice, grilled assorted vegetables as the entree, and a scoop of rainbow sorbet for dessert-- but it reaffirms how one should rely on the old standby of quality versus quantity.  And I guess they have to charge that much to keep the Benihana salt mines open....  heaven sakes! The waitress was giggling to herself about how much water I was putting down, but I really can't imagine that this is a rare thing with their preferred method of seasoning; salting the bejesus out of everything from the pasty, ginger-esque dressing on the salad and the soggy, cold, fried tofu appe to the soy-and-butter sopping vegetables.  The only reprieve was the rainbow sorbet and a nice hot green tea closer.  \n\nEveryone else at the table had either a meat or seafood course, and were quite satisfied with their meals, so MAYBE it was just the veggie option or MAYBE I'm just a picky foodie or just MAYBE this place really needs the constructive criticism.  And yes, I also realize this place is possibly more about the show than the food...???.... but our chef, though nice, was quite lackluster and didn't have a full cashe of tricks to unveil.

I arrived at about 5:45pm and since I didn't have a reservation I had to wait until about 6:30pm for the next hibachi table that had room. No biggie I went to the bar, had glass of Cabernet and order the dragon roll. I mean it was happy hour and all and it was pretty reasonable so I had no problem waiting. \n\nWell lucky me gets seated with a family of 5 1/2. I say that because it was the two adults, three boys (the oldest was celebrating his 14th birthday) and a newborn baby girl, hence the 1/2. The father looked like a George Bush Jr clone, I KID YOU NOT! I had to do a double take that is how much this man resembled him. Let me just say that this family loves them so sushi. They ordered a ton of it along with their man courses. My kind of family! They were pretty comical that's for sure. \n\nOur server (who's name I never got until I got the bill) was friendly enough but I kinda felt like and after thought as she seemed to be more focused on the family. No biggie but even though my meal was \"free\" doesn't mean you have to treat me any different. I say \"free\" as it was free up to the first $30 and anything over you had to cover. Again no biggie. \n\nI ordered the Splash and Meadow which was steak and colossal shrimp. We started off with the miso soup which was really good, especially since it had fried onions and scallions mixed in the broth and wasn't overly salty like some miso soups can be. We received our salads very late, like we were in the middle of our hibachi presentation when we received them. I must say I was disappointed in the salad dressing as it was just blech. Almost like it was missing something and believe it or not, I was actually looking forward to my salad. Oh well. \n\nThe fried rice cost extra and I didn't know it and had I realized it, I would have just ordered regular white rice. It is mixed with some chicken, vegetables, etc, which I understand the extra cost but honestly it tasted as if the rice was undercooked. It was still hard. Another disappointed but oh well. Now the shrimp appetizer along with the all the vegetables and the colossal shrimp that came with my meal were very good. The chef was generous with the shrimp because two of the kids didn't want any. I think they were pretty full from all the sushi that they ate. Now onto my steak. I was a little disappointed because I wanted it medium rare and it was medium done but still not too bad. By the time everything was actually ready, I was full as I had had that dragon roll while waiting for my table and had tasted everything as it was prepared. So needless to say I ended up taking my entire meal home. I spent about $20 total at the bar and for dinner including tip. I will probably be back again someday soon. \n\nSide note, I did notice that they have a sign for all you can eat sushi for $26.95 Sunday thru Thursday. I may have to go back and try that one day.", "business_id": "ishjLG3Sc94ZOelXZZhaIw", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-04-03", "type": "review"}

Brian had the Shrimp, Chicken & Filet Mignon while i had the Lobster, & Filet Mignon, Greg had the Shrimp & Chicken, Kristine the same and Charles the Filet Mignon while Tiffany had the Mango Chicken and Alondra the Filet mignon i think as well. Everyone raved about their food. My lobster was divine. The Fillet Mignon was cooked medium rare to perfection! The Benihana vegetables are always my favorite and i totally wish i knew how to order extra! The chef had many more tricks up his sleeve than most Tepan Yaki chefs around town, so i was still captivated by the twirl of his knife. One thing i miss from the NJ Tepan Yaki spot we frequented was the sake in the season bottle slung at us from the other side of the grill. Never the less i love this place and 6 months in between each visit is toooo long! Luckily we had 8 of us in our party because we took over half of the grill.

We couldn't get a reservation until 9pm on a Saturday so by the time we sat down, we were all starving. And, since we were only a group of 4, we had to wait about 10 minutes until another party of 3 was seated with us. Next time, I will be sure to bring 8 so we can all sit with people we know.\n\nThe waitress was very attentive, getting our drinks and re-fills quickly. We were served a soup and salad before the chef came over to prepare our dinner entrees. In my opinion, I wasn't a fan of either the soup or salad. The soup flavor was bland to me and the salad dressing was sour tasting. The chef came over, introduced himself and began cooking our food. He was pretty quiet, which surprised me because I thought the chefs were supposed to put on more of a show. Oh well, he was nice enough.\n\nThen, when I went to excuse myself to the ladies room, I was appalled at how unclean they were! For such an expensive restaurant, you would think the bathrooms would be really nice and attended for...I literally walked in and two of the three stalls were backed up. And, on top of that, there was a mushroom floating in one of the toilets! EWW! If I didn't have to go so bad, I would have held it. Not okay!\n\nWhen I returned to my seat, the chef cooked our meals and a few \"appetizers\" including hibachi shrimp and cooked veggies of mushrooms, zucchini and onions. We also ordered chicken fried rice, which was to die for! I really enjoyed watching the chef prepare everything...in my opinion the real reason to go here. For our entree, we ordered filet and scallops. We asked for the filet to be cooked medium rare and it was way overcooked! I would say more well done if anything. I also found that the meat was really under seasoned...but they do provide a couple sauces to go with the meals. They do give a lot of food to you....and after dinner, we got green tea and ice cream. I'm glad I shared everything because it really was a lot of food! \n\nAll in all, this place was fun. There were a lot of birthdays going on and this would be a place I would return to have a celebration or just a fun night out with a lot of people. But, I wasn't as impressed as I wanted to be.

How can it NOT be awesome with fancy food tricks, fried rice, shrimp, and steak?  Mix in some saki bombers and you can't go wrong.\n\nFor the Master Chef Experience you are trained at the fine art of teppanyaki then are able to bring your friends/family in for dinner that you cook.  Training is held Monday through Thursday at 1:00ish which I guess is understandable because they don't want you messing around with knives and hot food in the midst of the lunch or dinner rush.  It still pisses me off though because I work during normal business hours.  I guess it is a small price to pay to hopefully make a fire volcano and fling some shrimp at my wife.\n\nThe training was awesome.  My personal teppanyaki chef/teacher (Hideo) and I pretty much had the place to ourselves so I would not be embarrassed if I sprayed rice everywhere.  The training took about 30 minutes and my teacher pretty much went over everything.  He taught me some tricks, some jokes and of course some safety stuff that went in one ear and out the other.

We sat for 15 minutes before we saw our waitress again. She finally figured out she forgot to bring our coffee. We finally got some coffee which was mediocre in flavor. Our food arrived about ten minutes after that. The skillet was supposed to contain sausage, bacon, onion, scrambled eggs, grilled american potatoes covered with cheese and sour cream. Mine had no bacon, two tiny chunks of sausage, no cheese, and the potatoes were so soggy, they tasted like someone had thawed them and thrown them in as an afterthought. It was so unpalatable i could not eat more than one bite, even after loading it up with salt and hot sauce. The waitress never checked on us once during the meal. She came back by the time my husband was finished. I told her the meal was horrible (in a nice way). She offered me something else. By that point, I was not feeling like eating anything else, I felt kinda sick. My meal was comped and we did get an apology. The manager explained that everyone LOVES that special and the potatoes are seasoned and grilled. The cook obviously didn't try my potatoes. Blech.

The staff is also pleasant enough.\nOn the negative side: Don't expect fluffy scrambled eggs. Here they are really just chopped up omelets. Someone needs to tell these cooks out West that scrambled eggs need to be constantly worked while in the pan, not allowed to cook on the bottom and then just chopped up. Also the \"sausage\" gravy that came on my biscuits was really just pepper gravy (tasted like a premix), no sausage in it at all. The waitress, however, was nice enough to bring me some chopped up sausage when I asked about it. The prices on the lunch items are pretty much in line with area restaurants, but breakfast is the least costly meal for the restaurant, and the prices for the customer don't really reflect that. My bill for a coffee, orange juice, and biscuits & gravy came to just under $17.\nOverall, not a bad place to grab a meal, but there are better choices nearby.", "business_id": "nP9zQBRNSxlnU8BsbqYI5A", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-04-30", "type": "review"}

A great time, with good service, delicious food (and fresh tasting fish, according to my co-diners), and very affordable when the final bill came.

Pulled out my iPhone, Yelped 'sushi'. Decided to give the much-raved about Sushi on Shea a shot. \n\nI was seated at the sushi bar--one of the largest I've dined at in Scottsdale.  Directly behind the sushi bar is a gigantic fish tank, serving as a reminder of the living creatures you are about to consume.  It does add a nice aesthetic touch.  \n\nAt this point in the night there were only a few people dining so I had my own personal sushi chef. I started out with hot green tea and some edamame.  It was cooked perfectly (I always hate it when it's slightly over- or underdone.)  \n\nAfter much contemplation and internal debate (the sushi menu is quite large, including many nigiri- and sashimi-style options), I chose the Houston roll, vegetarian roll and unagi nigiri.  \n\nThe Houston:  fresh tuna, cucumber, and jalapeno.  The tuna was indeed incredibly fresh and the portion generous.  Very tasty.  \n\nThe vegetarian:  cabbage, carrot, sprouts, cucumber and asparagus.  It was HUGE!  I loved how I felt like I was getting a full serving of veggies from this one dish.  \n\nThe Unagi was incredibly tender, although the cut of the eel could have been larger.  Props for minimizing the amount of rice it sat upon, and for using the eel sauce in moderation.  \n\nI loooove ginger, and when I asked for a LOT, the sushi chef presented me with a plate of generously cut ginger--clearly premium ginger, if there exists such a thing.  Bonus points for removing the paper chopstick wrapper from the vicinity and for refilling my tea before I had to ask for more.  \n\nA few bucks more per roll, but for fish this fresh I'm willing to spend the extra dough.  Don't be turned off by this--there are several cheaper rolls (including the above mentioned vegetarian roll), and I hear that happy hour is fantastic.  \n\nI've FINALLY found my go-to sushi restaurant in Scottsdale.  And because of this, I think I'll be able to call Scottsdale home.  Thank you Sushi on Shea.", "business_id": "Y2Lfzulh_D9nNcuH49UT4w", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-04-09", "type": "review"}

But this was place rose to the occasion.\n\nI was in the mood for Sushi, so I bamboozled a fellow Yelper into joining me for dinner. She suggested this place.\n\nWhen you walk in, you are reminded of some middle class Chinese restaurant in Salt Lake City. Oh wait....that's just me. Probably because it reminds me of Ocean City in Holladay....right outside the former Cottonwood Mall. I'd go there on my lunch breaks when I'd work at ZCMI/Macy's....but I digress....\n\nThe tables are nicely put together with blue table clothes that could easily match someone's dress. \n\nWe ordered a sashimi combo, the houston roll, and a vegetarian roll. Everything was fantastic. The fish was fantastic. Cold. Tasty. Cuts were perfect. It's all served on top of a bowl of sushi rice which is VERY flavorful. It's mixed with little bits of what seems like carmelized onions.\n\nA very complex, but subtle flavor that is sure to give your tastebuds a hardon.\n\nThe Houston roll was quite large, had a hint of jalapeno. Could've used some more heat, but packed enough flavor, so it didn't really matter.\n\nThe vegetarian roll was simply amazing! It was like eating your daily serving of vegetables right there and then. Even though I was full at the end of the meal, I was trying to convince my partner in crime that we needed to order one more of these. Didn't happen. Probably for the better. \n\nI am so glad we came here. I am #defo coming back. 4-sho.", "business_id": "Y2Lfzulh_D9nNcuH49UT4w", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-04-30", "type": "review"}

I had some free time, and decided I'd go to the nearest Jiffy Lube.

I literally had all day, but fortunately they were able to see me at 9am.  I killed an hour, took the Jeep back, and about another hour later it was ready to go.  I got a list of recommended services for my next visit, but never got the dreaded listing of extras that I supposedly needed before this visit was over.\n\nHow fortuitous that I ended walking 20 feet to the left instead of the right.  $20 without any sort of a coupon for an oil change.

Thought I'd try saving a few dollars since I get a gel mani every two weeks, and a gel mani/regular pedi every six weeks.  The cons to the savings are that there are only a few nail artists and a small number of massaging pedicure stations (five to eight?), whereas the previous salon I went to has easily four times the number of available artists on a Friday morning.  Another con is that because the space here is smaller than other salons I frequented, the number of bottles of polish on display, and these are the regular nail polishes (not gel), is limited.  For gel colors, you must refer to the color wheels in the basket on the table in front of the wall display of regular nail polishes.  These are labeled by brand and number.  If you can't find your favorite colors, any of the artists are happy to take what info you can give them so that the manager/owner may locate the colors for future visits.\n\nI've only had Tammie work on my nails, and I've patronized three times thus far-- two Friday mornings and one Friday afternoon.  (I recommend scheduling a morning appointment, as you will get the full treatment.)  Her sister and mom* have helped to wrap my nails with acetone while Tammie was busy with other customers before, but Tammie is the only one who's applied the base, colors, and top coats.    She's very pleasant to converse with.  I will say that this is the first Asian-dominated salon (I've spotted an African-American nail artist working here) I've been to that employs nail artists that speak English well!  (Not just perfect grammar, but with Americanized accents.  I hope I haven't offended anyone by pointing this out?)  I have lived and worked alongside Asians from many cultures, so I am able to understand most of the spoken, and sometimes broken, English I hear (yes, I've heard Filipinos speak English with an accent, and sometimes I'm told I do too, especially when I'm speaking with family and friends in Tagalog and then have to switch to English- it's normal) and I can tolerate to hear MOST languages and dialects when others are speaking amongst themselves, but if you're sensitive to nail artists/techs that choose to speak to each other in their native tongues while working on you, then perhaps this Top Nails salon is a good fit for you!\n\nFYI, my latest color palette is OPI Red gel (has been for all three visits) on eight nails and Cuccio #38 gel (gold glitter on metallic gold- gorgeous!!) on ring finger nails for accent.  I'm thinking all gold nails for my next visit!\n\n*I asked Tammie if this is a family-run salon, and I gathered that it isn't.

If you love chocolate (and who doesn't?) order the chocolate souffle with your entree.  It's decadent, gooey and absolutely delicious.  The gripe with ZB is that it's so popular some people are turned off by the wait, scottsdale crowd, etc.  Don't be.  Zinc is the best bistro in town and worthy of a visit.

Maybe it was an off day or it was leftovers but it was bland and tasted like it was a few days old. I have had French Onion Soups from at least a hundred different establishments...

Since we had a large party, they even choose not to seat anyone else in the room to give us some privacy... their choice, not ours. To accommodate us, they made suggestions to make the event even more personal by setting up a cheese table and later changed it out for our cupcakes instead of taking up more room on our tables. It was the little things that made the event so special and we never felt rushed to leave so they could seat other guests. \n\nAt the end of the event everyone commented how lovely it was, what a perfect setting, and how impressed they were with Zinc Bistro's staff, and the delicious food. \n\nAs for previous comments on price, I found this very reasonable for the quality and selection.

That's French for something good, right?\n\nIt's not...It's English for freaking amazing, which is the best way I could possibly describe Zinc Bistro. Top to bottom, a fantastic meal.\n\nStarted with Duck pate, my wife had a salad,  we each had the flat iron steak at the recommendation of the server, and we shared a chocolate souffle for dessert.\n\nGoing piece by piece...Salad was very good, fresh greens, vinaigrette and a warm chevre crouton that was delicious. The duck pate was very flavorful and rich, served with marbled rye bread, an herb infused creme fraiche, cornichon, and some sort of meat gelee (which weirded me out). That was a dynamite appetizer, incredibly rich and satisfying. \n\nOur flat iron steaks were cooked to medium rare perfection, pepper crusted, and finished with a red wine reduction and shallots, which created an awesome sauce to dip the pomme frites that came with the steak. Special shout out to the chef(s) at Zinc, the steaks were really cooked perfectly. So often even at really top end steak houses, medium rare can mean medium. This was not the case at Zinc, which I appreciated. Pomme frites were great, crispy and flavorful, and were awesome when dipped in the sauce.\n\nThe souffle to finish was incredible. You get your choice of a finishing sauce (we chose chocolate), so you get the cakey exterior, warm, soft interior, molten center and then the sauce that pairs well with the whole thing. A wonderful way to cap the meal.\n\nI had a Manhattan after dinner that was good, service was very good, timely and attentive, with spot recommendations as well. I also love the atmosphere at Zinc. They do a nice job making it feel Parisian (without the smoking and the judgement...I kid, France...I kid).\n\nAll in all a wonderful meal, and I am sure to be back to Zinc soon!", "business_id": "GIGI8bJfN6HyPzmEW-QqjA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-05-23", "type": "review"}

My mom and I often order the cheese plate to start, which never fails to amaze us. For my entr\u00e9e, I usually order the basil brie chicken sandwich that is always cooked to perfection. The sauces warm, gooey consistency leaves your mouth watering for more. My mom usually orders the shaved chicken caesar salad, which never disappoints. We also place an order of the truffle fries, which are the greatest fries your taste buds will ever experience. Topped with fresh parmesan, the fries are cooked in truffle oil and served with a house made ketchup, thousand island, and mayo. \nNeedless to say, Zinc is definitely one of the top restaurants in Scottsdale.

I've had it many times at other restaurants. (If you're in LA, I would recommend checking out Bouchon in Beverly Hills.) The duck confit came out and it was incredibly dry and stringy.

Normally I would give it a 4 star review for the fresh strawberry martini, chicken chopped salad , pizettes, Jamaican Shrimp and of course the cheesecake.  However, this last experience was bordering on nightmarish there.  Overpacked as usual on a weekend, we took first available seating which was outside.  A litte chilly, but ok.  The table was slanted on an angle which made things interesting and not in a good way.  Then the heater went out.  We were then gassed by 3 different people trying to light it to no avail, even after we asked them to stop trying as the gas smell was so bad.  They refused to stop and literally left a huge stench of gas which turned our stomachs the rest of the time we were there and the non-working heater also left us in pretty much dark and cold.  \nWe ordered and the appetizer never came until the meals did which took quite a long time.  10 minutes after ordering, the waiter came back to say the item our friend ordered was out and she had to pick something else.  She said \"please give me a minute\" and he stood there.  She said it again, \"I'm going to need a minute \"and he finally went oh, and backed off from looming over her then took quite a while to return.  \nWhen meals did arrive, one did not come until 10 minutes after the rest.  My salad had mystery ingredients in it in addition to the normal ingredients (5 black beans and some stuff I had no idea what it was in the dim light).

They were also under staffed and did not have enough cooks on this day which added to the longer than average wait time for food.  Whitney, our waitress was very helpful and accommodating.  \n\nWe waited over 30 minutes for our food and by the time we ordered the food, the place was half empty so no real reason why it would take so long except to say the manager should have called in more help, but didn't.\n\nThe Kale and Quinoa app salad is bigger than small like the waitress said and can be a full meal in itself.  I had to send it back because they first brought it out without any Quinoa and grapes, when I got it back the 2nd time it was loaded with flavor, grapes and Quinoa plus the buttermilk dressing was excellent with it.   Also the incredible egg plant sandwich on brown bread was a hit and actually it was much better eaten alone instead of with the bread.  The Chinese chicken salad was just okay nothing to rave about as was the rest of the food - just ok - fettuccine, market burger, lettuce wraps, just ok nothing wow..  The cheesecakes again were just ok nothing to rave about - the banana cream needed more banana flavor and more cream, the mango key lime needed to be a bit more tart and the guey yellow stuff on top of the mango key lime is terrible and should be taken off.  the only cheesecake which was good was the original.

I love their food, however the customer service has gotten so horrible, I'm considering no longer ordering from here. I always order 1 of 2 things ususally. However, 75% of the time they forget the dressing for my salad, to the point that now the very nice driver checks first knowing where it is being delivered. Then today, I order a salald, no onions, add olives, like I do 1 a week. My salad came with onions piled on it, and no olives. I call a couple hours later when I realize it, while on my lunch, since we placed a group order earlier today. While the lady who answered the phone offered to send me a new salad (I can't eat onions, nor do I want a salad that's going to taste completely like onions now), and gets my info. 15 minutes later I get a call from who I can only assume to be the chef to complain about why I'm ordereing a new salad when all that was missing was olives. He was extremely disrespectful, and insinuated I was lying due to the time lapse (I have the salad still sitting right here waiting for them to come). After explaining multiple times that I ordered a salad with no onions and got onion, he finally reluctantly agreed to make me a new salad which should be here in another 30 minutes or so. \n\nI am just horrified at this customer service. Considering that my office places proably at least 20-30 orders a week alone, and have been customers there since July on a consistant level, they really need to step it up a notch!!!!!!!

With the several LOUD and obnoxious conversations we heard him having with the girls, we overheard the F bomb being dropped several times with a few belches thrown in the middle. The most talked about topic amongst the four of them had to do with monkey penises. And at one point he went ballistic and started cursing about some political topic. I seriously think they forgot we were there. When I came out from behind the corner to get a business card to email the owner, they moved from behind the counter to behind the door in the kitchen. Of course when I went to the bathroom I could hear them in the kitchen...still talking about monkey penises.

I've been here a few times for lunch in the past year and each time I've left feeling a bit underwhelmed.  The atmosphere is great; you feel like you've stepped back into the nineties and Phoebe and Rachael might just be at the next table.  It's definitely got a comfortable coffee house vibe with a nice mix of tables and lounge space which makes for a great casual lunch or meeting place.  The food however, leaves much to be desired.  \n\nThe menu is expansive, offering breakfast, sandwiches, soups, salads, pastries and they even have a juice bar in addition to the coffee.  Unfortunately, the sandwiches that I've had have all been mediocre at best.  My turkey veggie the other day consisted of a completely brown slice of avocado hidden between a clump of your typical grocery store processed turkey.  After I peeled the aged avocado off of the bread, it was edible but it was so very typical and blah that it made me wonder why I paid almost $10 for half a sandwich and a bag of chips.  My past trips have yielded similar disappointing results, with most of my lunch remaining untouched on the table.  \n\nI wish I could say the coffee was amazing and made up for the lackluster food, but the lattes I've had have made me wonder why I keep coming back.  It's just too bad that a local coffee shop like this can't step up their game a bit and really blow the competition out of the water by being the complete package.  Maybe they need to offer less food options and get rid of the juice bar and focus on improving a few choice menu items to create some renewed interest.

Our server checked on us several times as well.  We started with vegetable pot stickers and requested that they come steamed.  They were delicious! Next, we shared 'Indian Curry Vegetables' (I ordered it with shrimp) and Indian Vindaloo Chicken.  Both were extremely tasty - fresh veggies, chicken, and shrimp in really flavorful sauces with just the right amount of spice.  The curry vegetable dish came with broccoli, mushrooms, carrots, snow peas, and long beans.  The chicken dish had tomatoes and onions. We also had steamed white rice.\n\nNote to Flo: We were both disappointed that you took the Vietnamese Spring Rolls off of the menu and I miss the days of the green curry dish with calamari. One more thing - the chicken corn soup that you serve at the DC Ranch location should be offered at the others as well - I love that soup!\n\nFortune cookies came along with the check and we both were happy with our fortunes.

Enjoyed the Mongolian beef (beef with onions, jalape\u00f1os, red pepper flakes, and something that looks like sweet potato leaves), but as always, I felt a little let-down when I bite into the pieces and did not find the satisfactory crunch of the caramelization of past Mongolian beef entrees I've had elsewhere.  I was looking forward to the ginger-hot spiciness of the green curry chicken, and while it was slightly underwhelming, which I'm sure is most likely from the fact that I'm suffering from a cold and could not taste all of the flavor notes, I was happy to be able to detect the ginger in the dish.  I loved the long beans in this entree, which also had basil, lemongrass, fresh chilies, shallots, galangal, garlic, and cilantro.  I had a taste of both dishes for lunch, and I would have to say that the beef was more flavorful- saltier, and definitely spicier!  The noodles were angel hair-thin and had not satisfied my dietary lust for stir-fried noodles I fancied while languishing in bed waiting for lunch time to roll around...  I offered to share my dishes with Mom, but she was too busy enjoying her Shrimp and snow peas!\n\nDinner time came, and I enjoyed the noodles and green curry even more-- it tasted even better, or perhaps I was feeling better from the OTC medication and rest...   Wished this dish contained a LOT of long beans, as I find myself rationing the remaining amount...  \n\nBtw, each entree came with a side salad and the signature house dressing.", "business_id": "H7KzlC0-o1wIhlGg-Me5Ag", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-03-01", "type": "review"}

If I am ever in this area again there is no question that I will be staying here when I do.  \n\nSimone Sophia\nHealthy Weight Gain & Lifestyle Expert\nwww.growwithsimone.com", "business_id": "SYqTY48DJa1cYhglvmgvsQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-03-01", "type": "review"}

For me the pools and the building are not that asethically appealing and kind of blah. Loved seeing the bunnies on the way to the pool. The running trail I thought would go around the golf course it nothing but a trail along the main roads...disappointed so I turned back. The Nellie restaurant was bad and the menu at the pool is very small and not fantastic but decent...again not what is expected at the caliber of a hotel such as this.

I do wish they'd put chairs instead of benches.  Slightly awkward if you're alone or want to really relax.\n- Gorgeous grounds\n- delicious desert counter in the evenings in the lobby!\n\nHowever,\n- We booked online through the Starwood website.  None of our requests (only 2) were sent to the hotel.  We're talking simple things like non-alergenic pillows and high floor.  We got in late, so I addressed it the next morning and was told whoever booked it must not have transferred the codes.  I showed her the notes on my printed confirmation and told her I don't care what internal issues are involved.  Bottom line, I didn't get anything I requested.  \n- Room had an adjoining door.  Luckily the first night, nobody was next door.  The 2nd night, I got to listen to the couple next door talking, watching TV, and then having sex.  At the sex point I finally called the front desk (after 11pm) and told them I need another room to sleep in and that I'm leaving my stuff here.  I just want to sleep and come back in the morning.  The sent me to a room in the middle of a hallway completely surrounded by other rooms, more than my first room.  I refused - finally got a room at far end of hallway and slept soundly.  Next morning when trying to charge breakfast and other items, staff kept saying we checked out.  Had to explain over and over that we're not checked out.  Anyway, it wasn't the couple's fault next door - the walls are just paper thin.\n- Tried to book a cabana at adult pool in advance, but was told they only do full day cabana rentals.  Bummer.  Didn't reserve one since I knew I wouldn't be to pool until 2pm.  Got to pool and probably only 4 out of about 15 cabanas appeared to be booked.  Apparently, they'd rather leave money on the table instead of doing half day rentals of cabanas.  Oh well.  They could have made more that day.  Spoke to pool manager later (just by chance) and he said, oh, see me next time.  I can arrange it for you.  OK, well I called the number on the website for cabana rentals.  Apparently, that's not the route to take.  The spa doesn't have the authority to do 1/2 day.  DON'T make me jump through hoops to figure out who to talk to.  I'm just trying to spend money!!!  The cabanas are not worth it anyway.  They're just patio tables under the tent.  Not like other hotels that have TV's, ceiling fans, etc.  These cabanas are old and outdated.\n- Pool service ended at 6, at which time children are allowed at the adult pool when their's closes.  At 6pm there was probably still 25 adults at the pool.  Such a shame, more money left on the table.  These people would continue to order food and drinks if they could.  Oh well.\n- Pool menu is very limited for drinks.  If you want white zinfandel, you're set.  There's only 3 wines and they won't go to another bar to get more options (I kept forgetting I'm not at the Four Seasons).  What you see is what you get and we're not going to do anything else.\n- 1 server for entire adult pool area.  This is Scottsdale and it's high season.  Seriously - get some help out here.\n- Green your room - this is one of those hotels where you're assaulted with fliers about reusing your towels, get extra SPG points for not having maid service, save water, save our world, etc.  How about no maid service, & give me $50 off my bill.  Why tell me to conserve water when you have green grass surrounding your entire resort, including alongside the pool, driveway, walkways, etc.  How about instead of telling me to conserve water, you conserve water and rip out some of your unnecessary grass in the DESERT!  If I'm paying your rates, I want a fresh towel!  Do you really need grass lining the 1/4 mile long driveway and around the pool that needs watered year around?  \n- I'm not cheap, but the room service breakfast prices are seriously out of control.  I think the cheap breakfast was $24.00 + $3.00 delivery + 22% gratuity.  Really?  22% we're charging now???  When will it cap out?  And I don't understand the delivery fees hotels charge for room service.  Work it into the $24 eggs I'm ordering and $14 pot of coffee.  What's my alternative?  Will you let me go to the kitchen and bring it up myself?  I will.\n\nOK - I'm out of room to type according to Yelp.\n\nAfter talking to manager at check out about the noise issue and requests not honored at check in, no refund, no discount, just extra SPG points.  Gee thanks.  I had to come through your lobby in pajamas at 11pm and you can't offer a break for my inconvenience????", "business_id": "SYqTY48DJa1cYhglvmgvsQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-05-07", "type": "review"}

I have MANY friends that have raved for years about staying at the W - from the amenities, to the heavenly beds, to yada yada yada.  I just haven't had a reason to spend the extra $ on a hotel, and still don't.  However, one of our lovely friends got us a gift card for a one night stay here.  So - reservations were made, we arrived, checked in, and were instantly greeted with a less than promised view - along with popcorn ceilings.  Listen, when the retail price for a room exceeds what I spend in an average Costco trip, I kind of expect to be impressed.  And asbestos-ridden particles invading my mouth and nose is not something I expect unless I'm going home to Idaho for the weekend.  \n\nThe products in the bathroom were great, the lazy river was nice, and the restaurants / bars we frequented that night were spot on.  Then, the next day, when we checked out, it was the most awkward transaction we've ever had with a hotel.  Granted, you're not normally paying for a stay with a gift card, but it's 2013 people - and a place like the W in a city like Scottsdale should have it's customer service on point.  \n\nInstead, they didn't, and they were rude, and even required a follow up call the day after to sort some things out.  In other words, I won't be recommending this place to anyone - whether they be from out of town or a staycation. \n\nIf you do happen to find yourself here, GO TO DESEO for a meal - it was awesome.

I actually prefer prosecco, but it wasn't an option.\n\nThe rooms were clean and spacious.  Comfortable bed.  Westin standards for sure.  The gym facilities were small, but sufficient.  Really enjoyed lounging at the pool with buckets of beer during the day.  They even have a lazy river, but I did not utilize it.\n\nI can't say I was a huge fan of the restaurants.  Breakfast was pretty standard for hotel food and service at one of their nicer restaurants (Deseo) for dinner was really terrible.  Disappointing service and not very attentive waitress.  The food was just OK.  However, the cheese bread was delightful & probably the best part of the meal.  Thereafter, we didn't dine at the hotel for meals.  The first night's meal was just for the sake of convenience & being exhausted from the traveling earlier in the day.\n\nIronically, I rarely ever take advantage of the spas when I go to resorts.  Typically they're always disappointing and over priced.  I've experienced impeccable massages and would just end up being upset to pay someone to give me a disappointing massage and not having it be up to my standards so I can't speak for the spa. Plus, I've got sensitive skin and allergic to most products so with my luck I'd probably break out in a rash which would end up ruining the whole trip.\n\nGreat resort if you're a golfer.

I am a long time SPG member and very loyal to this chain, but I would highly encourage you to think twice before \"choosing\" to stay here. The property is very pretty and it is well situated in the North Scottsdale area. However, the service is extremely inconsistent. After a long day of meetings I ordered up some room service. While checking email and watching TV, I notice that my burger was raw on one side. It was covered with melted cheese, so I did not notice it until after I had maybe two or three healthy bites. I seriously almost threw up after I had realized what I was eating. Maybe it is my fault. Maybe I should have paid more attention to what I was eating. Maybe I should not have trusted The Westin. Maybe I should not have believed that their dinning room was capable of delivering a cooked burger. When I contacted room service to complain, they did offer to remove the charge so my company would not pay for the raw burger in my stomach. My simple question is, what will you do for me? How will the Westin undo the wrong done to me on a personal level? The simple answer from the manager on duty at 11pm on March 19th was nothing. Okay...fine.\n\nI could overlook the atrocious service in your outdoor lounge area.

The hotel is beautiful and the lunch we had at the hotel afterwards was great. \n\nThis past weekend March 22, 2014 myself and 4 girlfriends planned a spa day Westin Kierland Agave Spa. I should preface that I bought a Travelzoo special that they ran for a 50 minute massage with an add on foot or hand scrub and a mimosa.\n\nI made the reservation for 5 girls but only had 4 travelzoo coupons but said I would gladly pay going rate for the 5th girl.\n\nI put myself down as the main contact for all 5 reservations. On Friday, I got the first of 3 phone calls confirming our appointments for Saturday. I asked that they check their records after the first call and not call me 5 times. So much for that. It took them 3 phone calls to get it.\n\nUpon arrival the person that showed us the spa was nice but did not share where the pool was or have any useful information about ordering champagne and mimosas. It took 45 minutes for us to order a bottle of champagne (it came in a plastic cup with a lid on it) something that was advertised with the special. The excuse was that they ran out (This was Saturday at 11 AM at a 4 or 5 star resort).\n\nOne girl in our group tried to reserve a cabana at the pool (we would have gladly paid a fee and ordered lunch) or 5 chairs for when we were finished with our massages to no avail. She was told that the cabanas were reserved. \n\nMoving on.... the 4 of us with Travelzoo got a combined 50 minute and foot massage for the grand total time of 40 minutes. The one that I paid full price for said it was the best massage of her life and got her full hour of service.\n\nAfter the massages were over it took 30 minutes to pay for 1 massage as I already paid in advance for the 4 travelzoo massages. Needless to say I could not find my center and was no longer relaxed.\n\nAt the pool there were only chairs in the shade and they were motel 6 quality at best. The food server's response to what beers do you have was \"domestic and imports\" and menus are scarce. He returned with only 2 drinks, dropped one and forgot 1. We noticed that the only cabana in use at the pool was the one being used as a staging area for water for the servers. At no time was any of the other 12-15 cabanas used. \n\nNeedless to say we will not return to the Agave Spa at the Westin Kierland Resort. My advice is to go to the Camelback Inn which we did last month and will again next month to get the relaxing treatment we pay for when visiting a spa.", "business_id": "SYqTY48DJa1cYhglvmgvsQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-03-24", "type": "review"}

I got a solid night's sleep the whole visit. The morning brunch was very good and convenient.

The area where the Westin is is very new, and most everything is very retail/big chains oriented. It's a nice suburban area.\n\nThe service, sadly, was terrible! I don't know who is in charge of hiring and personnel management at this location, but they need to be fired. The valet service gave us the worst first impression of the hotel and made us feel incredibly unwelcome, the check-in staff was borderline rude and the concierge made a disaster of our entire evening with some of the worst recommendations I've ever gotten. It was Saturday evening and they had a prom, a wedding and a convention going on all at the same time. When we pulled up to the front the valet guys completely ignored us (you may be thinking, WELL with a prom a wedding and a convention, maybe they were busy, maybe cut 'em a little slack? I totally would have chalked it up to that but we were 1 of 3 cars there, and there were 3 valets, 2 of which were casually talking beside their stand the whole time...). Finally 1 of the 3 valet guys lazily came up to us as we were getting our bags out of our car and asked if we wanted help, we said sure and he then said okay and walked away! haha - I don't know if he didn't understand us or what, but he looked like he did. It was weird. We then lugged our bags in ourselves through the incredibly crowded lobby area to the check in desk and my husband went back to park the car. There were 4 people at the check-in desk but only 2 were actively checking people in. Then after 10 minutes of waiting in line I was told we were in the wrong building for the villas and we had to go about half mile down the road to check in (which HAD the valet dude actually been helping us, might have saved us 20 minutes of stressful overload and an overall negative first impression of this Westin.) \n\nWhen we finally did get checked in, we went to the concierge and were \"helped\" by Allan. Do NOT ask this dude for his dining recommendations, we asked him for his recommendations on a place with local-flare and high-end service. He recommended Sol Mexican Cocina (which was chain-like, had disgusting food - fish stick calamari & margaritas that they brag are made with sour mixes) and the Westin's restaurant Deseo. The restaurant Deseo is utterly underwhelming - if atmosphere and service are factors you care about in a dining experience, pass on this place.", "business_id": "SYqTY48DJa1cYhglvmgvsQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-04-14", "type": "review"}

Service and professionalism are top notch at this establishment. The staff work very hard to ensure your stay and experience are memorable. 2.) The view of the place is absolutely gorgeous. Well kept resort with an amazing ambience. 3.) The pool/spa/lazy river are well worth the visit to this place. I have never seen anything quite like this spa/pool arrangement with lifeguards to provide safety. 4.) Location, tons of shopping and restaurants are all within walking distance to the resort.\n\nCons: 1.) Price. I came here for a conference and honestly if the conference was not here, I would not come. Let's be honest, the average American would have hard time justifying the cost of one night here, when they could pay that same price and that would equal 3-5 nights elsewhere. Maybe I am being too practical but for the average Joe (such as myself) this price is steep. 2.) TV. I enjoy chilling and relaxing in the room.

I have never stayed at a resort where the maids come past 3-4, let alone that late. Our room got cleaned once in 4 days. Terrible customer service. So hard to get ahold of anyone while staying here. Left countless messages that went unreturned. Set up cabana at pool and let concierge know I would have guests weeks in advance via email. Day of they told me I had a limit. Almost Ruined birthday party. Pretty much Ruined our stay as it pissed me off beyond comprehension. I was forced to talk to multiple different managers delaying start of festivities.

I just wanted everyone in, so I paid the cost. I was told I could have a limit of 5 people allowed in per room when I booked the second room. When my 9th person showed up, the pool manager tried to tell me he cant let anymore in as I am only allowed 4 per room. Their own employees do not even know their policies. Whether it was the front desk person that was wrong or the manager, somebody was relaying incorrect information to their guests. As I was pleading my case and remaining calm to the pool manager, he rationale was this...\"what happens if your party is taking up too many lounge chair or chaises and my paying guests have no where to sit? Or if someone in your party gets a little too rowdy or drinks too much? I then have to comp my paying guests a free dinner and $500 credit.\" Verbatim. I looked around, it was about 2 pm and there were plenty of available chairs. I pointed him to my cabana that I, a paying guest paid for and showed him the majority of my party was couples sitting on the grass playing with newborn babies. A real tough crowd I tried to bring. He said he is \"just looking out for the benefits of his paying guests.\" He went out of his way to keep using the term, \"paying guest.\" What does that make me? The guy who was roped into buying an extra room, on top of a cabana, and had HUNDREDS of dollars worth of services scheduled at the spa for the next day. He finally relented and let my last two guests in, though the damage was done. I was on edge and stressed out from all the hoops they made me jump through just to have a few people over that I had cleared with my concierge weeks in advance. And it gets better... As I was checking out, the desk attendant asked me how my stay was and I told him the truth, that I wasnt pleased with the way I was treated and how I was put through a ringer to get a few guests into the pool that I had already gotten pre-approval for. I then asked to speak to the hotel manager and he said no problem. He comes out from the back and says the hotel manager is in a meeting but would be happy to call me later today. I gave him my number. That was at 10:30 am. It is now almost 9 pm and i never once got a call. The best part is we had a late flight and we stayed on the grounds and ate some lunch. My concierge gave me a $75 gift certificate that I was told could be used anywhere onsite. I tried to use it to pay for a $30 lunch. The waitress came back and said it had been cancelled and there was no money on it. I am a starwood preferred member, I have a starwood AMEX and I have stayed in only starwood properties for the majority of my adult life. I will do my best to never set foot on one of their properties ever again. If it wasnt for the friends they tried so hard to keep out of their pool area and my girlfriend whose birthday we were attempting to celebrate, the weekend would have been ruined.

And in this case, the F stands for Farrelli's. Talk about a great way to spend an evening! \n\nI ain't gonna lie. You can easily rack up a pretty lofty bill, especially when you're ordering wine by the glass and $9.50 appetizers that taste too good to be true. My fave has to be the Garlic Shrimp Pizza, though it was a tad too greasy. Also good: Baked Brie L' Orange and the Fruit/Cheese plate. \n\nFarrelli's offers a large drink selection, including featured cocktails and seasonal beers. But, for the wine lover, you'll be happily pleased to see their expansive wine list. You can buy by the glass or the bottle. Prices start at 7 and go up to 9.50 for their suggested Earthquake Cab. I had a glass of that (very good), as well as the Round Hill Cab, which I preferred. \n\nA movie will cost ya $8.50. But seriously, it's not the price that matters. It's the experience. \n\nPicture this: You place a simple phone call into Farrelli's and tell them you want to make a reservation for (insert time here) for (this many people here). They put your name on the list, then advise you to arrive 30 minutes before showing so they can seat you and take your order. You are welcome to arrive even sooner and take a seat in their bar, which boasts pictures of Hollywood stars, including the timeless Marilyn Monroe. \n\nThe theater itself feels more like a larger lounge area, with a movie screen. You sit in comfortable leather chairs at a round table. \n\nBest thing of all? You can simply push a button during the movie and your server will answer. What is it that you needed? No worries. \n\nAt the end of the movie, you get a bill, much like at a restaurant. You can split it up however you feel like it. My close friend said, \"Don't be alarmed by the bill.\" Thanks for the warning, for between the three of us, it was $125 w/o tip. I guess every once in a while you just need to spoil yourself, right? \n\nIf you go with someone (or a few someones) and you all can agree on a wine to order, I suggest ordering a bottle. It's the one piece of advice I'd bestow on anyone going here. Also, no need to dress to the 9's. This place will welcome you in jeans and chucks! \n\nFarrelli's is a great experience. I recommend it for everyone - friends, family, a date. The movies they offer here aren't new releases, but they manage. (Be forewarned: Their \"advertisements\" at the start of the film are hideous.

Instantly I was a fan.. unfortunately my taste for smooth, \"luxurious\" hair comes at a rather expensive cost to my wallet. Blowouts can usually run from 200 to 400 bills, depending. When I found a \"coupon\" that would run me about $150 for the blowout treatment and a single process color, I thought it was a steal. It was at a pretty nice salon in Scottsdale too so that was a bonus. I went and got the blowout, but my experience wasn't all that great and I decided that while I liked the work the stylist did, I could probably find another salon that was a little more customer service oriented. It's been about 4 months and time to \"re-blowout\" the regrowth in my hair. I used a search engine and just typed in \"Brazilian Blowout in Scottsdale,\" Choppers was one of the first to come up. I was intrigued by their website and decided to book an appointment with them.  \n\nThe experience itself-\nWhen I pull up the first thing I noticed was the parking lot is a little snug, luckily they're backed by a huge shopping center, so there are certainly other options available, if everything is taken up front. Walking into the building, I was immediately greeted by a staircase and mirrored walls. Of course, the narcissist in me loved that. :) When I got to the top of the stairs and rounded the corner I was then greeted by the staff. Everything about this place just has a real funky vibe to it. You can feel that when you enter the building. The decor on the walls, the staff themselves, everything just screams cool, funky, dive type of atmosphere. They offered me wine or beer upon arrival. I opted for a glass of the Merlot. Kelly is the guy to see when it comes to getting a blowout. He has a certain quirkiness to him, that I liked very much!! He did a wonderful job and I was really satisfied with my treatment when he was done. I really enjoyed everything about Choppers Salon. It was clean, neat, I love wine and the price for the treatment was same as the price I paid for the first treatment with the coupon. The price alone, really can't be beat, especially for everything your getting. I will certainly be back when it's time for my next blowout treatment.", "business_id": "0nUI6eiZ5uT70qD1Ht9VMg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-04-13", "type": "review"}

It oozes pretension (What furniture store needs their own valet parking, especially when the parking garage is literally right across the street from it?), with salespeople that won't give you the time of day if they don't consider you worthy of shopping there. I passed by at least 3 salespeople who walked by, ignoring me.\n\nI walked in and looked at all the furniture. Every single piece had the same drab, linen-pale-beige, burlap-sack colored fabric on it. From the looks of it (And since no salesperson deigned to talk to me to let me know otherwise), it seemed like the furniture upholstery only came in this color, and in this linen-like, sack-like fabric. I know now after looking at the website that there are actually a multitude of fabrics and colors to choose from. Why would they put the same exact, pedestrian shade and fabric on all their furniture, on all 3 floors? Variety is good! It lets customers know that your furniture is customizable!\n\nThe only person there that actually talked to me was their valet, who thanked me and wished me a good day even though I didn't use their services.

That is my experience of \"shopping\" or attempting to shop at the Scottsdale Restoration Hardware. Make no mistake, as a designer, I am a big fan of the look and many pieces that they carry and the presentation is stunning. The problem is, they forgot to include salespeople that bother to even pretend to care about helping potential customers.\n\nThis review is not based off of an isolated visit either. I have attempted on several occasions to even get a glimmer of recognition that I am in the store from the sales staff, let alone actual help. Nothing... Nada. They literally will walk right past you and this is on days when it wasn't even busy with two or three salespeople milling about. Not a smile, not a hello, nothing.\n\nOnce after touring through the entire store and never once even having a sales rep bother to make eye contact with me, I simply had had enough. On my way out of the store I literally had to split between two of the staff who were clogging up the walkway talking to each other and STILL neither one said a word to me! I stopped, turned around and approached them both asking how it was that a potential customer could spend 10 minutes in their store and never once be even acknowledged as being alive? I let them know that I actually could afford to buy their preciously overpriced items and perhaps they should treat me as an \"equal\"... Unbelievable.\n\nWhat a crappy brand experience. Typical for Scottsdale however. I wonder if all Restoration Hardware stores are now that way?", "business_id": "N_SN6NXnXo-Ik30xm8sSHA", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-04-29", "type": "review"}

Service was fantastic, portions were really big, and the company was a cherry on top.  There were 5 of us total, and I think everybody was happy with our experience.  We received fresh warm rolls and a pesto-olive oil sauce off the bat... yum!  Our waters and drinks were refilled constantly which is always a big plus.  Side note - everytime I said 'thank you,' our Italian waiter replied with a 'prego' - so charming; it made me feel like I was really in Italy!\n\nI started with the arugula salad... it was lightly dressed with a perfect balsamic, and had just the right amount of tomato, parmesan cheese and artichoke.  (I think the artichokes came from a can, but I like canned artichokes, so it was fine with me).  The others seemed to enjoy their caesar salads just as much.  For my main entree, I had the linguine vongole cozze e calamari (Linguine with clams, mussels, calamari and zucchini) in red sauce.  It was delicious!\n\nOther dishes at our table were the spaghetti and meatballs, and a pasta dish that had Italian Sausage, chicken breast, bell peppers, zucchini, and mushrooms, sauted in white wine with a touch of tomato sauce - that was a hit as well!\n\nWe were all too full to order dessert this time, so I'll have to remember to save room my next visit.  I really don't think you can go wrong dining at Arrivederci... it's casual, charming, local, and they've proven successful since they've been open since 1995.  Cheers to many more years of success...

First, while I am a fan of cool, rare to unique t-shirts, I'm not quite sure overpaying for average to slightly better than average t-shirts is what I was looking for.  I have a pretty decent hat that I bought from here and a few shirts, they do have some nice sales, but the owners need some help on how to treat customers.\n\nWhile I may not look like a standard-fare, trendy scottsdale guy, wrapped up in affliction and ed hardy, I think owners here are bizarre.  First, every time I see the guy, he has a new look: one time, it was long hair with multiple hair colors and a large patch of the hair on the top of his head missing, and another time he looked like he was trying to give Michael Jackson pointers on how to be a weirdo.  Needless to say, I've seen and interacted with my share of weirdos, but the guy really has a lot of gall in the way he speaks to customers.  Maybe, and this is just a suggestion, he should place a \"Members Only\" sign on the door.\n\nIn any event, the bottom line is that this store, at least for the men's clothing, is overpriced and, most times, you have to deal with a shady character of an owner.  Hmm, maybe he should close the place down, I'll reopen it and sell something completely opposite, say, preppy boating and golfing attire, and he can be treated like the douche when he comes in.  Sounds good to me, but I wonder what the cougars in search of hiphugging jeans will think?  Hmm...", "business_id": "VAkSrbIRXTR1mA-CCDQqCA", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-03-20", "type": "review"}

I mean I don't know about you, but I want to actually be able to see what I am a eating. \n\nSo after being seated and having our drink order taken, it took a minute for someone to actually come and take our order. It was kinda weird as it didn't seem to be that busy but who knows. In the end everyone ordered the fish and we all had it differently. Some had it fried, some had it baked, some had it blackened/cajun and we all either fries or onions rings. Let me just say that it was worth the wait. The fish was so moist and fried perfectly. I had a piece of the cajun as well and it was seasoned just right. Oh and the onion rings? Good lawd they were good. I am not sure what they did back there in the kitchen, but they most definitely made up for our wait. \n\nThe bill came and we were pleasantly surprised. The all you can eat fish special pretty much included the drinks for only .25 cents. Cool huh? So $13 or so dollars per person, plus tip and a VERY full stomach later, we all hobbled out of there and went back to work fat and full. As a matter of fact its 10pm and I am still full from lunch today. Sad but true and I only had one plate of fish!!! The all you can eat fish fry is worth it if you like fish.

Went online to buy Mothers day flowers for my mother and an aunt who live in town. I found two arrangements that I liked, added them to the cart and went to check out. Their site seems to want to send to only one address per order online. I decided to send them one order at a time because they are going different places. I dumped the other flowers for my aunt from the cart. Finished moms flowers, got a confirmation #, then went and started another order for my aunt. When I went back online the cart already had both sets of flowers in the cart. I dumped moms flowers from the cart this time and went on with my aunt's order. I finished the order putting in new info for her address including special instructions about her gate code. I got another different confirmation #. Today I get a call from my mother thanking me for her two sets of flowers, but knew there was a mistake because the second set said her first name and my aunts last name. \n\nCalled Cactus Flowers, the girl was very friendly, looked up the orders and then asked to put me on hold so she could look into it. 25 minutes later a girl answers \"Cactus Flowers, how may I help you?\" I explain that I have already been helped and been on hold for a half hour. She says OK and puts me on hold for another five minutes before I presume is the first girl I talked to asks for a number they can call me back at. I give them my number and get a call a few minutes later from the first girl who is nice and explains that she couldn't get back to me because she lost me in the phone system. Somebody else found me twice, but she couldn't find me. Anyway, she explains that their online system isn't the greatest and feels bad about the mixup. She said next time just call us direct and don't use the internet ordering. She explained that her manager said that they were willing to give me 20% off the next order if I wanted to re send those flowers to my aunt. I declined. So it's basically my fault because I used their online ordering instead of the phone? It was really nice of them to offer me 20% off another order to replace the order they sent to the wrong place.\n\nYou will probably get good service going direct with Cactus Flower, but stay away from their online ordering, especially if you have more than one arrangement to send. You lost a customer for life Cactus Flower. You put out a not so prime time online ordering system and then when it screwed up an order you blamed the customer, not for screwing up the order, but for having the nerve to use the online ordering system instead of the phone. I used the phone today and spent a half hour on hold with Cactus Flower.

I went to this dentist because his office is located very close to where I live.  Keep in mind, I'm in my 30's.  Never had a cavity in my life.  NOBODY in my family has cavities.  Up until my visit to this guy, my teeth were perfect.  \n\nHe uses this sonar wand thing that detects 'microcavities' that have yet to show up on an xray and tells me that my teeth are perfect EXCEPT for these 'microcavities'.  He scares the daylights out of me by telling me that unless I get 10 'microfillings' in my 'microcavities' they will be full blown cavities within 6 months.  Alarmed by this prediction, I set up an appointment to get 4 of these 'microfillings' put into 3 of my teeth immediately with the intention of getting the rest of my mouth done later.  I go in to get my teeth drilled on the next day and the anaesthesia he used was so strong, I felt like I was going to have a heart attack (I have had anaethesia before and it was never like this).  He proceeds to drill on my teeth and that was the beginning of my dental  problems.  For about a month and a half I suffered discomfort chewing and temperature sensitivity.  I finally call the office and complained and they tell me to come in for an 'adjustment'.  He does some more drilling and it seems a bit better, but still my teeth still don't feel the same.  A few weeks later, I notice a black dot on one of the teeth he has massacred.  I brush it and it appears to go away, however, I notice a very small cavity on that tooth that is going through the filling.  WTF?!?  I immediately make an appointment to see my old dentist (who's office is far from where I live, but has been my dentist for the last 11 years).\n\nI tell my dentist what this guy told me and did to me and I come to find out the 'microfillings' were COMPLETELY UNECESSARY!!!  My dentist just shook his head and said 'that's too bad'.  Everyone has small fissures in their teeth.  They are a cause for concern if you are a teenager, but for mature adults who maintain good dental hygiene, they are basically dormant and as long as you continue with good brushing habits, they will remain dormant.  \n\nMy old dentist proceeds to tell me that the dot I am seeing on my tooth is the result of an air bubble in the filling material that popped and exposed my drilled-on tooth to decay.  Now, after this M-F'er jacked my teeth up, I have a real cavity that is showing up on xrays.  My dentist told me I could go back to Douglas and have him fix the filling for free, I said ABSOLUTELY NO WAY IN HELL AM I LETTING THIS A-HOLE within a mile of my teeth.  I would rather pay my old dentist to fix this botch job.  Keep in mind that the reason I had this work done was because of the scare tactics he used.  Well it's been over 8 months and the 6 'microcavities' that I did not end up filling (because of my nightmare experience with the first 4) are NOT full blown cavities like I was scared into believing would happen.  In fact, the teeth on the side of my mouth that this guy did not touch are perfect.

It's like thick nuggets of cod in a light batter and it is so good (comes with coleslaw, chicken meal comes with salad or coleslaw).\n\nThey serve you hot garlic bread in a basket that is often made from Italian bread, French bread and even a sesame French bread, baked on premises!\n\nWe've never had to wait to be seated and its one reason my wife and I do NOT like to go out to eat on a Friday or Saturday night in the Phoenix metropolitan area, where dine-in restaurants commonly have a  1-2 hour wait before getting a table (Grimaldi's, Texas Roadhouse, Applebees, Olive Garden, Red Lobster, Cheesecake Factory, etc...etc...)\n\nThey also sell dry pastas, sauces and oils imported from Italy as well as offer a variety of fresh baked goods, I also like that I can pick up the latest copy of the free New Times newspaper there.\n\nThe pasta dishes are excellent. The only thing we've had they we were disappointed with is the pizza - which is kind of shocking, given how good everything else is and how authentically Italian it is otherwise.\n\nHaven't tried anything from the deli. We go there primarily for the broasted fish and broasted chicken. You have to try both and decide which you like better (most people I take prefer the fish, but agree they are both great!).\n\nPrices are very reasonable and lots of menu items to select from. And they serve Coke products. What more could I ask for?", "business_id": "pmIJn8K3offcYUsrFCWAaQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-05-11", "type": "review"}

Every single thing I have ever ordered there is DELISH.  I have not had a single complaint, or been disappointed even once.  Their sandwiches, particularly the eggplant parm and the chicken parm are incredible.  Amazing crusty bread with a huge portion, they don't skimp.  Their sauce is outstanding as well. The meatballs are phenomenal. I am also a fan of their minestrone soup.  I have gone there just for that.  its hearty, needs absolutely nothing sprinkled on or added to it.  And they are consistent.  Always good, every time.\n\nI am actually salivating as I type this review LOL.  Seriously though, if you haven't tried it, please go.

The chicken I expected juicy mouth watering juicy, which I did not get. it was dry, dry dry. The chicken is better at Costco and way less expensive.  I had to put apple sauce on my chicken to make it moist.  I would tell Guido to stick to one thing which you do good and avoid all the rest as they also sell very high priced pasta dishes, which I have not tried as they are very high priced even for Scottsdale.

He was either intimidated, on drugs or truly just couldn't be bothered by our table.  He couldn't look me in the eyes the entire time while rattling off the specials.  He would look outside - up @ the ceiling - down @ the floor - other tables - anything from looking me @ directly.  We ordered drinks, appetizers and he went on his merry way.

The white sauce with the ever so slight bit of red sauce to accompany it was PERFECT!!  IT was soooo delish.  Two days later he wants to go back for more.  Buckets and buckets he says.  I ordered the lasagna and Josh ordered the tortellini.  The lasagna was pedestrian.  It was ok.  Nothing like the gnocchi.  And the best part of the tortellini was those mushrooms.  Man those were delish!  It was sooo good.  \n\nThere was a couple celebrating what I have to assume was her b-day next to us.  We were treated by Mama Tutti coming over to her table and singing to her in Italian.  IT was terrific.  What a treat.", "business_id": "gHKB66up5VluCWT4vuSZpw", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-05-01", "type": "review"}

If I was on island (home), I ate a the Honolulu restaurant every Saturday from Jun 2007 to May 2011.

Given that Landrys recently bought McCormick and Schmicks and closed the Phx location in addition to the Phx Mortons, I think there's a serious change afoot.\n\nHow does this reflect on quality?  Perhaps to early to say.  But on the other hand cutting away at something as small as management in tuxedos may seem inconsequential, I can guarantee you that there will be 2nd and 3rd order effects that will impact food quality.\n\nNow having said all of the above we ate in the bar.  Ordered the sliders, blt crab sandwiches, mini wedge salad and a bowl of lobster bisque.  I was all good reflected pretty much what we had in Hawaii over the last 4 years.  Having said that, I will go out on a limb here and say that if the tuxedo cutting culture makes it's way into the kitchen, then I predict one of the first casualties will be the crab cakes.

He is a major steak lover and loves these kinds of places but neither of us had ever been. We had a reservation and were seated very promptly by the manager. The server also had a slip of paper with our last names and greeted us as such. We had two servers, Jane and I can't remember the guy's name. Jane had her spiel down (as I heard her repeat it to the table behind us) and was somewhat likeable. I found her off-putting at times such as when she acted caught off-guard when I ordered an appetizer as my dinner. Then she smiled at me in an all-knowing way as if I was one of \"those\" girls ordering something small for dinner. I didn't say anything but my husband caught on as he said something about it after she left the table. Then later I overheard her jokingly ask a gay male couple seated by us \"who is the Mrs?\" when presenting their bill. That rubbed me wrong way, too, but maybe I was being sensitive. \n\nAnyway, they brought a large warm onion loaf of bread. It was okay...I ate several pieces. For dinner, we had the clams casino appetizer ($12), for my meal I had the baked prime platter ($22), my husband had the cajun ribeye ($47), bacon and onion mac-n-cheese ($11) and parmesan truffle fries ($11). Everything was very good except the fries because they never brought it out! It was on the bill, though, so I am not sure what happened there. They took it off when we brought it to their attention. Oh, that reminds me, Jane and the other server apologized for the oversight but Jane took it one step further by saying that at least it wasn't her mistake. Tacky. \n\nMy baked seafood platter consisted of one breaded large shrimp, one bacon wrapped scallop, one oysters rockerfeller, and one small lump crab cake. For $22????? Um okay....the horseradish sauce they gave with it was amazing though. My husband was in love with his steak. I had a bite, too, and it was really good. The mac-n-cheese was very cheesy and decadent. For dessert, we had the small chocolate lava cake with a scoop of ice cream ($15). I'm not sure why Jane said it took a half hour to cook but either way, it was very delicious. \n\nAdding a couple glasses of wine (it took awhile for my husband to be asked if he liked a second glass of wine-after his first had been empty for at least 10 minutes),  our bill came to $150. I knew it would be expensive but didn't care because it was a gift to my husband. I just don't get places like this. The service wasn't better than other places (and in some instance, worse), and the food didn't wow me. My husband had a good point that it could be hard to do that with seafood. I tend to agree but at that price point and the amount of food, I should have loved it. Instead, it was comparable to places half the price. My husband will probably go back....but without me.

But, when you are asked to pay the amount that Morton's charging, then your standard is elevated.  For the price that I paid, I expect to be wowed, and sadly that wasn't the experience.  First, the staff and service was very adequate, not too intrusive, just the right balance, and they were friendly, we were asked by different staff members if everything was fine, which it was, but it wasn't great.  The meal consisted of a Morton Salad, Mashed Potatoes and an 8 oz Fillet Mignon.  The salad was large enough for 2 people, but  unfortunately, it was poor.  It was basically, Romaine Lettuce, chopped eggs and blue cheese dressing.  That's\"s it!  Not  tomatoes, no cucumbers, no onions,  not even lowly croutons.  Tasty, but very average.  The mashed potatoes were good, tasty,  had a slight taste of sour cream and chives. Not bad.  The steak, the entire reason I'm here.  It was not bad.  I ordered medium rare, the marinade seemed a little a sweet for my taste, and I want to say, might have a hint of teriyaki, but I'm not a 100 percent certain.  Not my favorite combination, but it wasn't horrible either.  When I pay 40 plus dollars for a piece of steak, I expect it to be so tender, that the knife goes through it without much resistance.  The first couple bites were almost perfect, but the more I got to the center of  it, the chewier and tougher the steak got.  This steak should be tender throughout.  That was the most disappointing.  Overall, it wasn't a bad experience, but based on other similar steakhouses that I've eaten at, this should have been better.", "business_id": "_YswYrpv6YdO3R3CP8R8oQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-03-01", "type": "review"}

We opted for here since I'd never been. We've been to Mastro's several times, Flemings, and the like but I had my two choices down to Morton's and Dominic's at the Quarter. My finance used to come here a lot several years ago and raved about their food so even though it had a lower rating on Yelp, I decided to give it a shot. \n\nMade reservations on OpenTable the same day and all time slots were open and I was glad to get our 7pm reservations so easy. I noted that we were celebrating a new job in the notes.\n\nWe arrive about 15 minutes late due to some late traffic but check-in was easy. The valet outside is free if you are eating here (with a tip of course) but we did have to wait for another car in front of us to pay $6 since they weren't eating here. I was surprised walking through the double doors at the decor. It felt a little bit like walking into a Sizzler from when I was a kid. The doors were old and it didn't get me too excited about what we were in for. The decor in the rest of this place was okay...big shaded lights hang from the ceiling and they have the U shaped booths lining both walls that I have mixed feelings about. They're a major pain to get in and out of but they're nice to cuddle up in if it's just two of you.\n\nThey had our table ready for us and the hostess was friendly. When we were shown to our table there was confetti on the table and on the top of the menu it said Congratulations. I thought it was a nice touch but wasn't overly surprised since I had made a note on our reservations. When I didn't have too much of a reaction my fiance asked if I noticed it and when I said Yes, he told me that he had called ahead and asked what they could do for the celebration. In addition to the decorations, the hostess came back and took our picture and presented it later in a nice paper frame that said Congratulations on my new job. I thought it was  a nice touch.\n\nWe were promptly greeted by our server and while not overly smiley, he was nice and genuinely seemed interested in our special occasion and even checked out our picture later. After giving the menu a glance we opted for the chopped salad and $17 crab cake as starters, a 6oz filet cooked medium plus, a Cajun seasoned ribeye, cooked medium rare, with the creamed spinach and twice baked potatoes au gratin for sides. They brought over a loaf of the onion bread and while I initially thought I wouldn't like it since I don't like onions, I tried it and thought it was amazing! I could have easily eaten the whole loaf! \n\nOur chopped salad was really good though I thought the bacon was really crunchy. It did say bacon bits on the menu so I'm guessing that's how it's supposed to come. The crab cake was really good but there was only ONE about 3\" in diameter. While good, for the money we'd definitely skip it next time. And then our steaks came out. Standard white plating with some garnish on the side. I was really surprised when my filet came out and it was thin...no more than an inch thick. I'm accustomed to steakhouses at this price point to be a thick cut of meat usually 3-4\" thick. I cut into the slightly thinner side and it was well done but had good flavor and was tender. The further I cut into it, it was more medium so it was okay but I still couldn't get over the thin cut of meat. When we were asked by our waiter how everything was, we mentioned about it being overcooked and he did offer to cook another one but really, the flavor was good and I didn't want to waste the piece of meat. When I had three bites left, the manager came over and offered again to prepare another steak for me and that he wanted us to be completely satisfied. He was really nice and he seemed really genuinely interested in our satisfaction which is probably why I'm giving them 4 stars. The other reason for the four stars is for the potatoes! They were delicious! I haven't had too many carbs in the last three months and these were divine. So cheesy and cooked perfectly and while they weren't thin like a normal au gratin, I thought the chunks were unique. My finance's steak was cooked perfectly though and he enjoyed it. I will say I'd skip the creamed spinach. Wasn't my favorite. We were also given a complimentary chocolate suffle for dessert and while I've never had one before, I thought it was really good! Light and fluffy and not too filling after eating nearly all of the potatoes :)\n\nOne other really nice gesture was our waiter picked up our valet card and had them bring the car around for us so it was waiting outside when we left. EVERY valet place should do this! \n\nWhile the steak wasn't ideal, the other items made up for it. I won't hurry back but I wouldn't hesitate to come back for that bread and potatoes!", "business_id": "_YswYrpv6YdO3R3CP8R8oQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-03-11", "type": "review"}

We were running behind schedule and did not have time to talk to the manager.\n\n1) We chose Morton's for restaurant week.  The menu options were limited and not a great variety to choose from.\n\n2) We ordered the 6oz Filet and also the Stuffed Shrimp and Pasta.\n\n3) The salads were plain and nothing to write home about.  The Morton's salad and the Caesar salad were basically the same.  Even though one came with with blue cheese and egg.  there was no wow factor in the salad like Flemmings.\n\n4) The FILET my friend ordered medium well... however it was served WELL done.  It was dry and not very tasty.  The potatoes served with the dish he ordered were not inventive or special... it was sliced potatoes with onions.  Something I would get from DENNYS!\n\nNeedless  to say the potato dish was a very big letdown\n\n5) The stuffed shrimp...  what can i say.  Over cooked and under seasoned.  The crab stuffing (at least i think it was supposed to be crab) was tasteless.  My wife and I were not able to tell what the stuffing was supposed to be for the shrimp.  Again... this is a dish i would expect from Applebees and NOT from Mortons.\n\nThe broccoli was not cooked enough and not seasoned at all.\n\n6) We ordered the Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e and the Chocolate Souffl\u00e9.\n\nThe Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e was cold... unappealing ... and far too sweet. \n\nThe so called \"Chocolate\" Souffl\u00e9 was not even chocolate in color... did not taste like chocolate and was so wet and sloppy in the center it was unpleasant to eat.\n\nThis was absolutely the WORST steak dinner experience I have had at any restaurant.  This was not our first visit to Mortons...  but it sure was not a good visit at all.  If we had more time I would have talked to the manager.  My wife was so disappointed that he just wanted to leave.\n\nNote: someone from Morton's called me while I was driving. They wanted to apologize for the experience... However they just kept repeating that so many other people enjoy their food. However if you look at the yelp reviews... That is not the case. I think this is one of the worst rated steak houses on yelp.  Flemings, Ruth Chris and others don't have as low of an overall rating.\n\nI am very disappointed that management never even offered to correct the situation.

Nothing like hearing the lyrics \"you gotta lick it, before you stick it, you gotta get it soft and wet so we can kick it\" (yes, that song from a previous decade is now in a cheesy extended club mix version playing exclusively at Sushi RA)....how nice it is to hear such words as you contemplate which raw fish to order.  I don't think so.  I looked around but did not see a dance floor...although I did notice a couple behind us with 2 young girls which made the whole scene seem entirely inappropriate.  I thought for certain they must be offended, but realized much later, during a short break in the music, that they were speaking French and seemed entirely oblivious to the lyrics being pounded out.\n\nThe management of this place need to mature a little bit.

The staff is usually attentive and down to earth, and the food usually comes out pretty quick.

The crazy monkey roll is my absolute favorite with a lot of flavor, but its definitely an acquired taste (if you are a nigiri lover, this is probably not the one for you).  They are open late night too which is great and hard to find in the n snottsdale area.\n\nThe bads - they are not always consistent with their fish.  Sometimes its great, other times it absolutely blows --- the nigiri is a toss up.  A seasoned sushi-er knows when something is not right; I put a piece of nigiri in my mouth that tasted way off, and what do you know it came right back up about 10 minutes later. Normally, I would swear to never return to a place that caused unnatural regurgitation, but the manager was quick to rectify the situation, covering our food on our bill and offering us a voucher for a free dinner of whatever we wanted next time we came back in [this however did not go as planned - check out my review on the ra downtown] Another time I found a bone in my salmon nigiri, definitely not ok.

I think some people may give it bad marks because it's sums up everything beautiful and wrong with Scottsdale in one meal.  The location in Keirland, lends RA to be a haven for the Scottsdale douche elite to hang out at the chain sushi restaurant with mexican chefs, order a dynamite roll and reminisce about the time they ate the freshest yellow fin at the Grand Wailea resort on Maui.    And I got to say, I saw a couple of them there.  But sushi is a funny thing.  You can't fake freshness no matter how hard you try, and the fish here tastes like it was flown in from Japan, Alaska, or Hawaii this morning.  Blows places like Yume out of the water.  My wife and I wondered in on a Saturday afternoon and to our delight happy hour was in effect.  Long story short, we ordered a lot of nigiri, ponzu marinated sashimi, a couple of hand rolls, gyoza, and 4 beers for a total of $64 including tip.  I'd definitely come here during non happy hour, but I have to say, this is going to be my new place for Saturday afternoon indulgences.  You see, like the mexican sushi chefs that work here, Scottsdale is a bit of an anomaly.  There's no real culture here other than the one that's been put up by developers.  All the authentic real grit that resides in the Downtown Phoenix, has been washed away, polished up, and desert that used to be considered no mans land nothing is now the height of luxury in the Valley and its only getting better with time.  I guess what I'm trying to say is that beyond the Pottery Barns and the overpriced Hemingway Cigar Shop bullshit, there are local businesses that have adapted and learned like the chefs at RA and they are turning out spectacular food and doing it really well.  Don't let any other reviews change your mind.

I was disappointed but then again it was the holidays so I decided it was just not meant to be.\n\nFebruary rolls around and I decided to treat myself and see if I could now get an appointment with Alicia.  I called; again Alicia was not available and did not have an opening for over a week.  This time I expressed my frustration and disappointment but understood that I was calling in at the last minute.  I asked the receptionist if she would let me know if there were any cancellations in the next few days.  Within 10 minutes of our conversation I received a call asking me if I would be able to come to the salon in an hour, I was so ecstatic, of course I could be there!  \n\nWhen I arrived at Bravo salon Alicia was waiting for me, she explained that it was her day off and was coming to the salon anyway to do administrative work.  She was more than happy to do my hair under the circumstances.  Alicia made me feel so special, I was so happy that I ordered an extra service, do to her generosity, that I did not plan on.  \n\nYou see what Alicia did not know was that day was my birthday!

They've only groomed my dog once but they are now the groomers I'll go to for anything I need.\n\nI have a 24 pound cocker/lab/border collie mix that is 16 years old.  He goes absolutely ballistic whenever he's put into a cage or confined space.  When I adopted him from the Humane Society they told me he had problems with cages and that he'd probably been abused.  Although their vets were guessing at his breed and age, they felt he was about 9 months old when I got him.\n\nWithin months of getting him I took him to a groomer and asked that they not cage him.  When I returned to pick him up I was told that he went crazy when I left.  They had ignored my request and caged him.  They said they didn't want him back and suggested that I learn how to groom him myself, which I've done since.\n\nThis was the first time I've taken him to groomers since that experience and I called several and looked up many reviews on Yelp before I did.  This place will not cage an animal if you specifically ask them not to.  That alone is hard to find and the reason I initially chose them.  When I scheduled an appointment I spoke with Erica and explained I was nervous about bringing him in and I elaborated several of his health issues.  She convinced me he would be in good hands.\n\nWhen I brought him in Erica came out front and sat on the floor and got to know him for about five minutes.  He's frequently scared of most everybody but his tail was wagging with Erica.  This salon is owned by Erica's mother.  I WILL TAKE my dog back to them and recommend them to all my friends.\n\nThey are \"Top Notch\" in my opinion.  At one point she was trimming his paws and grinding his nails and since the only times he's tried to nip at me was when I was doing this, I asked if I could come back and hold his head up to prevent any possibility of this happening.  She allowed this then told me \"he actually behaves better when you're not here.\"  So I left and went for a walk.\n\nWhile I was holding his head up I smelled something that reminded me of \"Heat,\" a cream I used years ago for sore muscles.  Erica told me she had added Medi-Boost (by Nature's Specialty) to his shampoo while bathing him which adds that smell but helps relieve sore muscles (particularly for older dogs). She said her experience is that sometimes older dogs show signs of soreness the day following grooming, so she adds this in order to help.\n\nFor those that are cost conscious, they are less expensive than any other groomers I called.  They even offer $5 off if you tell them you learned about them on Yelp.\n\nI couldn't be more pleased with the way the treated and groomed my best little buddy.", "business_id": "Ejp7cmKGNlXZWr2MiVo-3g", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-03-05", "type": "review"}

Enter Havanna Caf\u00e9... the best/most reviewed Cuban place on Yelp in the greater Phoenix area. \n\nWe went to the Scottsdale location which is nestled in a random little strip mall... if you didn't know any better you'd probably assume it's some no frills neighborhood diner, but how wrong you'd be... just beyond those stucco walls is a nice quaint Cuban restaurant with dozens upon dozens of dishes most people have never even heard of before. \n\nWe were sat down right next to a live Cuban band... bongo drums and all... they were belting out some pretty groovy tunes. The main singer had a deep scratchy voice and a heavy Cuban accent... and he said 'wooooooooooow' a lot... this combined with the d\u00e9cor of the place really did make it feel like you were really in Cuba, very fun! We decided to order a schmorgisborg of stuff... what follows is a list of what we got along with a brief description:\n\nCalypso Chips - Fried Plantains w/ black bean dip... damn good... good chips and salsa alternative. \n\nFrituras de Frijoles Negros - Deep fried balls of black beans w/ avocado dip... heavenly.\n\nD\u00e1tiles con Chorizo - Chorizo stuffed dates wrapped in bacon... very unique flavor.\n\nPapa Rellena - Meat stuffed in a ball of fried potatoes in a bed of cream sauce... pretty decent though a bit rich. \n\nTamal Cubano - A Cuban ground corn tamale with pork and other random goodness, it was alright but not quite good enough to specifically recommend.  \n\nPotage de Frijoles Negros - A black bean soup... a little too 'beany' if that makes any sense. Made a good dip for the black bean balls though. \n\nOn top of all that we tried a couple of imported Cuban sodas... both were pretty different, but tasted great. The meal was very fun... flavors were all over the place; if you're a fan of trying new things then this should be high on your list. The Tapas section of the appetizer is quite extensive and you can easily make a fun and varied meal by getting nothing but appetizers. \n\nThis place is easily recommendable for any of the more adventurous foodies out there; you'll have a lot of fun at this place trying some new things. For us, this place was more of a novelty, to try once just for the experience... but depending on your pallet I could see this place swooping in a stealing a lot of business from other more bland Mexican and ethnic restaurants nearby.  4/5.", "business_id": "8v1MWkAeU3nEuqGd27jZeQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-03-18", "type": "review"}

We had a couple die hard favorites back in SoCal that we would frequent on a monthly basis. We've been missing our Cuban craving fix since moving here to Phoenix. So last Friday evening as we were deciding where to get our grub on we happened to pass by Havana Cafe. The fianc\u00e9 had heard good things about this place from coworkers so we decided to bust a U turn and give it a try. \n\nIt is located in a small strip mall with a metal gate door. A little sketch looking but we weren't deterred because good food often comes from little dives. The place was pretty busy but we were seated right away. It was a little weird for us to be seated side by side on a bench which the hostess first had to slide the table forward, allowing us access to the bench, and then proceeded to slide the table back in towards us so we were essentially boxed in. But moving on....The place is loud with great live music but you find yourself having to talk really loud to your server to get your order in. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 ordered his usual favorite: ropa vieja. I couldn't really find anything that looked especially appealing to me...for a reasonable price at least. So I settled on a tamal cubano and the ceviche from the appetizer menu. Overall, the food was good. We enjoyed the ropa vieja and the ceviche. I only wished that the ceviche came with chips instead of crackers. The tamale was good and had bits of pork in it which made it more of a crowd pleaser for the fianc\u00e9. However, both of us felt that we didn't enjoy our meals as much as we do at our fave Cuban place back home. Plus, we didn't feel our meals were worth the prices here so we left a little unsatisfied. Don't get me wrong...we are not opposed to spending good money on food that we feel is worth it so please note that our review is not because we're cheapskates or anything. But if you plan on hitting this place up then be prepared to pay $20 and up per entree. \n\nBottom line is that we may or may not go back. Nothing really wrong with this place but nothing overly exciting either.

We were surely pleased, they were hot and mushy on the inside served with a side of avocado dip, OH soo YUM, we also ordered ourselves the lime mojitos, talk about refreshingly good!!\n     We later ordered our main dishes, Tim got the Pollo Cubano and I ordered the Chicharones de Pollo, it was all pretty dang delicious!! Very flavorful, and just down right taste buds satisfying!! \n    We finally topped it off with my favorite, Arroz con Leche!! This on the contrary was just OK, it lacked cinnamon i think, I have made way better arroz con leche myself, If you like I'll share my recipe, but the appetizer and our chicken Cuban plates were bomb!! :)\n\nThank you Havana Cafe for the great service and good food!! :)", "business_id": "8v1MWkAeU3nEuqGd27jZeQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-03-20", "type": "review"}

Havana Cafe used to be one of the few restaurants I used to brag about to out-of-town friends.  They had a dozen dishes that I would classify as excellent and many others that were just \"quite good\".  But it has gone drastically downhill.  Here are a few examples:\n\n1.  The appetizer portions are smaller than they used to be, sometimes ridiculously so.  For example, the chicken croquettes ($6) consisted of two pieces the size and shape of a thumb (a child's thumb), filled with pureed chicken and almost entirely tasteless.\n\n2.  The entrees (we had ropa viejo and picadillo) were adequate in size but spiced very poorly.  The picadillo had no tropical spicing, and in fact tasted faintly bitter.  The ropa viejo was vinegary.  This points to incompetence in the cooking staff.\n\n3.  The prices remain high.  But they are cutting corners -- no bread was served with the meal this time, for example.\n\n4.  The menu was never really authentic Cuban, but it did have a number of popular Cuban dishes, with an interesting admixture of Central and South American favorites.  Some are still on the menu, but others have given way to meat loaf and fried chicken.\n\nIt looks to me like the management of Havana Cafe is flopping around, looking for a way to make money (or more money) and has made a series of poor decisions.  If you are listening:  it's time to hire a better chef, make the menu more authentic, get rid of those $5 plastic chairs, provide real value, and pay more attention to managing the wait staff.  I hope to see you back to your previous glory, but I'm not holding my breath.  And I am not spending $100 for two people for what you have to offer.", "business_id": "8v1MWkAeU3nEuqGd27jZeQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-04-06", "type": "review"}

If you order this item, don't eat lunch before you come.\nMy wife ordered the Chicken Chicarrones which was good but a little dry.

I was able to purchase the groupon for $40 worth of food and drink for $20 and was very excited about it! When I got there at 7:30 on a Tuesday night, the place was pretty dead. There were about 5 tables filled out of 25 or so. An older couple came in and knew everyone, so were obvious \"regulars\", and they seemed to love the place. I ordered the White Bean Soup and the Ribeye steak with Gorgonzola sauce. The White Bean Soup was piping hot and delicious. The little bit of shredded Parmesan that melted into my spoon made the soup delectable. A waiter notified me shortly after I ordered that the ribeye was not available as the meat guy hadn't come. He substituted the porterhouse at no extra charge with the same Gorgonzola sauce that would have been on the ribeye. The steak was okay. The sauce was good, but the Gorgonzola overpowered the flavor of the steak. The steak was a little thin (hence why I'd rather have a thicker Ribeye than a thinner porterhouse). The roasted potatoes that came with the dish were delicious and the vegetables were tasty. I took 2 stars off for ambiance, not having the ribeye, and just overall satisfaction with the meal. I feel that if I had the ribeye, this might have been a 4 star.", "business_id": "863nEWkPZ7uD-ZRTmmJokw", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-05-26", "type": "review"}

We entered and said to  the person at the door (who we were informed was the owner) and said \"Table for three.\"  Without a word he looked us over and led us to a table / booth.   Our waiter came over, asked if we wanted anything to drink and we said we would probably have wine with dinner.   Okay.\nWine list was way overpriced, lowest entry around $46 but most were way above $60.  Selected a bottle which we were pleased with, after the waiter first came back and said they were out,   My wife and sister-in-law weren't too hungry and they asked to share a salad and order of spaghetti and meatballs.   I ordered the chicken/sausage cacciatore.   First came the wine (did I mention they had to go back to find the correct bottle).   Then the salad (pretty good actually).   Then a wait, and I mean a wait.   Probably  over 30 minutes minimum.    Wife and sister=in=law had a hefty portion of the spaghetti and meatball, but it was dry, devoid of any sauce \nnot a hint of red.  Looked like a meatball with spaghetti around it.   My meal was okay, nothing to write home about.  Meanwhile the owner was making his way around the place chatting up the customers (never said a single word to us the entire evening.

TG we had a Localdines certificate because if we had paid full price, I would be totally peed off.\n\nAttended the Scottsdale Philharmonic concert Sunday afternoon  just down the street, & as La Torretta was conveniently located & as DH had been longing to try it for over a year & as we had certificate...  \n\nArrived a little early for our reservation (Open Table) but they seated us immediately, at 6 pm, as only about 3 tables were occupied. First impression: dated. Cheesy 80's goomba, which can be kind of cool. Ceiling has this \"broken\" area so it's supposed to look like an old ruin & you are looking up out an ancient building to the sky. There is a mural on the wall of a naked woman (Venus?) with ornery little cherubs buzzing around her. It was done by an extraordinarily talented artist---the skin tones glow, but still she is in All Her Glory, so I'd feel funny with a younger child in tow. Mostly, I was unimpressed by the cleanliness.  Too much Restaurant Impossible? The carpet was really grimy & I could see thick layers of dust of the back edges of the chairs & supports, & also on the top of the velvet drapes. Told DH NOT to go near the drapes during dinner as I didn't want that crap sifting down on my food!\n\nOrdered wine---very happy with our selections & the prices per glass were reasonable. The wine was little slow to come out, but glassware sparkling clean. Our server recited the specials & my eyes lit up when she mentioned Osso Buco. I LOVE Osso Buco. Fortunately, as I contemplated that, another young man came with basket of bread & oil. One bite of dry, tasteless roll & equally tasteless oil & I became hesitant to spend $43 on the veal shanks. Oil served in a gravy boat with large spoon---very odd. If you poured oil from boat, you got none of the herbs and whatever in it---but the spoon was so large that to take it out of the gravy boat you had to tilt it and lose half the contents. It didn't matter---it had no flavor at all, despite lots of bits & pieces floating in it. I decided to go with the Gorgonzola salad with strawberry vinaigrette & Cannelloni Fiorentino & Gnocchi. Kind of a weird, carb-heavy combo, but description of the cannelloni sounded delicious. DH also got the salad & Pollo Farcito Formaggio Quattro.  \n\nWell, our salads finally arrived about 6.37.  (Yes, by this time I am checking my watch.)  Admittedly, dining room starting to fill up &  appeared our server was only one working, but really? I almost gagged on first bite---so incredibly sweet. But as I started to get the tart, pungent gorgonzola along with the sweet vinaigrette, it was delicious. Also included blackberries & raspberries & candied pecans & greens VERY fresh, so ended up being very good. Took our time, but how long can you linger over a salad?  Probably finished about 6.50. Server did stop in for a moment & we ordered another round of wine. Thank goodness, because our entrees finally appeared---I kid you not---at 7.17 pm. So the runner pops them down before us & I am looking at my plate & not feeling good about this. Looked like two cannelloni just visible under a layer of something---it looked like TVP (texturized vegetable protein). Tasted like it too---tasted like nothing.  There was no seasoning, no depth of flavor--nada. The chicken filling inside was the consistency of baby food and again, no seasoning. I won't say it was disgusting---it was just flavorless. It WAS hot, I can say that! The gnocchi---and I find it hard to believe they were house-made, were actually cooked well, but again, no flavor, despite large pieces of mushrooms tossed in the bland cream sauce.  The veggies were cooked tender-crisp, but again---no seasoning. DH said his chicken was well cooked (I had a taste and I thought it was a little overcooked) but only a whisper of the sweet, rich flavor of marsala. Even rosemary potatoes that accompanied---this is kind of gross, but DH got a couple of hard needles of rosemary caught between his teeth & when he wiggled them out & then chewed them, said it was like eating straw. Obviously, not using fresh herbs in the kitchen & considering even the dried had no flavor, assume it was old, bulk stuff. Potatoes though, were hot & steamy & cooked very nicely.  Server stopped by, looked at my plate & said \"No parmesan?\"  I told her I had not been offered any.  So she whisked away & came back & generously sprinkled shredded parmesan on my dish. Some flavor now? No.  Was that dryish, plastic parm they sell in giant bags from food services. Ugh.\n\nDisheartened, we gave up and had the busboy box remainders, hoping I could \"flavor up\" at home. Waited 18 minutes for server to notice we were ready for our bill. Another 9 minutes to get the credit receipt.  Really?\n\nI feel bad because DH was really looking forward to this restaurant.  What a let-down. Really surprised at all the positive reviews, but then I see Yelp filtered all the 1 & 2 star.  Hmmm.

The cannoli's...amazing! \n\nAlso, they are accommodating for people with gluten allergies. They will either adjust one of their meat/pork entrees to work for you or you can ask about bringing in your own, unopened bag of GF pasta. I do have to caution you that when it is super busy, they aren't always able to accommodate when you bring your own pasta, so just be sure you are good with the back up plan! \n\nCan't wait to go again, but don't foget to bring cash as they don't take credit/debit cards and they do close at 8:30pm!!", "business_id": "AX8lx9wHNYT45lyd7pxaYw", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-03-10", "type": "review"}

I do find 9pm a little early to be closing on a Saturday, but I didn't care. I had a table, a drink, and it smelled good. \nHot bread was brought over with garlic & herb butter.

On my first trip, I ordered chicken parm with a side of mostaciolli.    The second trip we tried the Pasta Alex which was very good and the Italian sausage.

Waited 40 minutes for a table when for 30 of those minutes we stared at 3 empty tables just waiting for people to be sat at them- they remained empty while my party and 4 other parties waited the full 40 minutes wondering why those tables were remaining empty. \n\nWe were finally sat and waited another 10 minutes before we were even acknowledged by the server who clearly was more interested in socializing with the other staff members than with providing good customer service to his tables. We finally placed our order after flagging down the server via another employee. We then waited another 45 minutes for our food before the waiter returned and blamed the delay on something that was \"beyond his control\" and it would be another few minutes,\n\nWe were so annoyed at this point that we told the manager to just box the food up and we would take it to go. To their credit they were apologetic and even threw in 2 free desserts. However, the damage was already done. I guess I would give this place one more chance only because of the great Yelp reviews but I would make for darn sure that we do not get the same waiter with his head in his ass.

The food is decent and the prices are ok....maybe a little on the high side for some of the dishes considering the location in an old strip mall.  However, my judgement of their prices must take into consideration the plethora of overpriced mediocre pretentious restaurants in the Kierland area.   My experience with Italian food is from growing up in San Francisco and eating at the neighborhood Italian joints, including those in North Beach. Also I have traveled Italy extensively.\n\nI had the Spaghetti with Meat Sauce and one meatball.  The soup was pasta e faggioli.  We also had an order of garlic bread.\n\nThe soup was ok. The pasta in it was rigattoni that was properly al dente. That was promising.  The beans had the right consistency as well. The soup however, was not quite as hearty or flavorful as I've had in the past. Still, I would recommend it.  I'd give it a 5 out of 10.\n\nThe spaghetti noodles were of decent quality and just slightly past al dente.  Perhaps it's because americans like their pasta a little bit softer. The pasta I've had in Italy was really al dente.  The sauce was tangy but there was really little meat. I thought it was plain sauce until my wife pointed out a few spots of meat. To me, that's not really a meat sauce.  I like a sauce that has a bit of a kick to it.  This was more of a tangy  crushed tomato sauce. So overall the dish was a 5 out of 10.\n\nThe meatball had a lot of filler in it. It tasted good but you could taste the filler. But the bottom line was it tasted ok.  I'd give it a solid 5 out of 10.\n\nThe garlic bread was bad. Do NOT order the garlic bread. First of all, the bread was plain bread shaped like a roll. That's not proper. Get some good sourdough with a good crust at least.  There was very little garlic taste and it was not toasted enough.  Go to Ernesto's on 24th and Clement in San Francisco. They make GREAT garlic bread and it comes complimentary.\n\nThe service was earnest but plainly there is not enough wait staff. On a Sunday night, there was only the cook, one waitress/busgirl and one server/greeter.  It took forever to get our check. They were nice but plainly overworked. The solution would be to hire one more waiter.\n\nAmbiance is meh.  It's an oasis considering the horrible shopping center it's in. But it's not North Beach Capp's Corner.  Throw some candles on the table at least. Spice the place up.\n\nClearly though, this restaurant has a following. It's usually crowded. I guess people need a casual place to eat away from the silicon breast and botox crowd over at Kierland Commons.\n\nI will return again to try some of their other dishes and report back.", "business_id": "AX8lx9wHNYT45lyd7pxaYw", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-03-07", "type": "review"}
