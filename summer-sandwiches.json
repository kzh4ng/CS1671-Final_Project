I appreciated that the restaurant offered me a reservation when Open Table indicated that nothing was available on this day.

After more than ten minutes had passed after we were seated without a server coming to the table, the hostess came over to ask if she could take a drink order.  She was not able to answer my question about whether the featured beers were draft or bottled.  Soon thereafter, our server, a charming and gracious young man, came to take the drink order.  We asked him to take our dinner order as well, given that this was stacking up to be a very lengthy meal.  More than fifteen minutes later, our entrees came, but no sign of my wife's wine and my beer.  I asked the young man who brought the food about our drinks and a few minutes later, our server came over, apologized, and told us how backed up the bar was.  He graciously told us that the drinks would be complimentary.  We received them more than five minutes after the arrival of our entrees.  These were not mixed drinks requiring anything special to dispense, simply beverages that had to be poured.

It rains a good deal here.  The city was built by many Eastern Europeans, some Italian, and some German immigrants who worked their asses off in the steel mills years ago.  Currently, Pittsburgh is much less blue-collar, but it still maintains much of rough blue-collar charm.  People here are genuine, love their football, beer, cigarettes (Marlboros and Camels not Parliament Lights), and facial hair (usually unkempt ones with neck beardage or the cookie duster mustaches often popular with middle-aged men with last names ending in \"ski\".)\n\nOnly out of a city such as Pittsburgh, could the Primanti Bros. Sandwich become a legendary food.\n\nA Primanti Bros. Sandwich starts with thick slice of homemade bread, then the usual suspects of meats, cheeses, french fries are put on top, and then sweet & sour slaw is slung on top of that, and finally a tomato, and another piece of thick homemade bread.  The entire creation is plopped down flimsy piece of cooking parchment and shoved across the counter your way.  It's a huge toppling sloppy mess.  The only way to fit the damn thing in your mug is too smash it down before you bite in.  Whatever your modus operandi for eating a Primanti, there just ain't a way to eat it with dignity and still eat it right.\n\nIf you're having trouble visualizing this, check out their website. Besides their city menu has the #2 best seller indicated and yet oddly enough absolutely no mention whatsoever of the #1 or #3? primantibrothers.com\n\nThe true yinzer sandwich option that I recommend is the Kolbassi and Cheese.  The Kolbassi is split open and dropped into the fryer.  Yes, a deep fried sausage topped with cheese, fries, and slaw.  The grease just glistening from the singed flesh as it absorbs into the thick white bread (dignity is overrated anyway). Make sure yinz warsh it dahn wit ah cold ahhrn city, en'at.  (translation: Make sure you wash it down with a cold Iron City Beer and that.)\n\nPrimanti Bros. is definitely not diet food, but most definitely a 100% genuine Pittsburgh food.  It is disgusting in all the right ways.\n\nI leave you with the apt lyrics of South Carey. \"Where they don't pour steel, but the kids are real. But why do they all have beards (beers)?

I needed to feed myself, my wife and my two kids. I ordered a hot sausage and cheese for myself, a black angus top sirlion and cheese for the wife and split a order of 6 chicken fingers for the kids (it comes with fries, what a deal!). After I placed my order I waited by the bar and unfortunately it was when the death of Steve Mcnair started to air :-(. The bar quickly filled up after I placed my order. The sandwiches took a little while to prepare and not as quick as I've heard they are. I got my order and in my usual fashion I checked it. No chicken finger and fries....bummer. I go back to the cashier/bartender/cook and asked her for my order who asks the cook where it is and he shrugs like \"I dunno\" so , she grabs some new chicken fingers and tosses them into the fryer so now I have to wait even longer for my food. I was planning to take it to go and eat at my hotel because there was no free parking out front. My hotel is by the airport so I wanted the sandwiches to be fresh as possible so that I can get the full experience. The chicken fingers took even longer to prepare so I am waiting and hoping my food doesn't get cold. Finally, after awhile watching the news my order is ready and I dash out and drive back to my hotel. First let me say the kids INHALED the chicken fingers like I never seen them do before and they have tried chicken fingers everywhere. The fries they didn't care for so much. I ate half my sandwich which was no longer hot and it wasn't bad, my wife didn't really care for hers since the amount of steak was skimpy.

The wall of Clemente, Steel Curtain photos, and my personal favorite, the shoe-string tackle of Nick Harper, which I find amusing to be considered one of the greatest plays in Pittsburgh sports apparently.  The rest of the establishment is clean and well-traveled appearing, and lots of high-def televisions satiates the sports-lover's attention whilst waiting on food.\n\nSo being the tourist that I am, I don't really know what to get, so I ask the waitress of \"what is THE food for a tourist like me?\"  With a confident smirk, she simply says \"pastrami,\" and I thank her for the suggestion, and I realize that it wasn't so much \"a suggestion\" as it was \"the order,\" and five minutes later, this monstrosity on a baking sheet is presented to me.  Thin-sliced pastrami, cole slaw, tomato, and I think there was some cheese in there, but a fistful of fries as well - you guys know the drill.\n\nSo in conclusion, great success.  I thought the pastrami sandwich was the stuff of legend, and just thinking about it has me kind of craving one again, even after lunch.  In fact, the best part of this particular trip to Pittsburgh was Primanti Bros., because my Braves ended up sending out the D-team, who naturally failed to beat a mediocre Pirates squad.

While I wouldn't call them chefs, as the menu at the end of the day is simple, they definitely have a solid skill set at the griddle.\n\nIf you've never been to Primaniti's, here are a few tips from a seasoned veteran.  \nTip 1:  Always get fried egg.  Always.  On everything.  \nTip 2:  Pick up a bottle of hot sauce and sploosh it on the fries...those of you complaining about bland fries definitely need to try the hot sauce technique, as it makes a definite difference.  \nTip 3: The \"cheesesteak\" sucks and is a travesty that people are encouraged to order this abomination, as compared to many other items of deliciousness on the menu. \nTip 4: I'm a  big fan of capicola (with egg) and the colossal fish.  The fish is huge, and you will feel like a fat kid if you finish it.  \nTip 5: A 23oz  \"Iron\" is only like $4.  Get one and talk like a Yinzer for a complete experience.\n\nThe Market Square location is just as good as the original in the Strip.  Oakland is meh, Southside comes up third in my book.  I haven't been to others.  If you're coming in from out of town though, any of them will fit the ill.", "business_id": "NeUf9FyCCIN4MEseNyqkXQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-06-05", "type": "review"}

Now you can't swing a dead cat without hitting a restaurant that is piling anything on top of a sandwich to try to stand out.\n\nPrimanti's, however, isn't some new fad. They have been putting fries and cole slaw on their sandwiches for roughly 745 years (Note: that may be slightly innacurate, but the point is, they've been around a while). This started as a way for the blue collar workers of Pittsburgh to be able to carry their whole lunch in one hand, to eat on th go... and a great idea was born. Adding a fried egg to any sandwich is an option, and it is also almost always a good idea - and should be mandatory if you order the cappicola and cheese. \n\nPrimanti's has a lot of locations now, pretty much all around the Pittsburgh area, but unlike most chains, they seem to have suffered no growing pains from expansion, and every restaurant seems to be top notch and consistent in food quality. The regular sandwiches are big, but if you want to grow your waistline a couple inches in one sandwich, get the colossal fish. It is ridiculously large, and the fish is great. If you're feeling a little adventurous and have never had a real sardine before, try the sardine sandwich. These aren't those slimy little jarred bait fish you get in grocery stores. They are nice sized real sardines - a little oily, just enough briny sea flavor, and being Primanti's, you get plenty of them.\n\nIf you've never been to Primanti's before, its definitely worth a stop... and with locations all over the Pittsburgh area, they're easy to find.", "business_id": "NeUf9FyCCIN4MEseNyqkXQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-06-21", "type": "review"}

Every place we stopped to eat and even a few bars recommended I try their ginger ale and it's really good!  So we all got that to drink.  \n\nTo start we tried the chili since it was posted on the wall as great chili.  A few friends told me \"don't get the chili, you're there for a sandwich.\"  They were right.  The chili wasn't good.  We don't put beans in chili here, and it should be thick, meaty, and able to eat through a spoon.  This stuff was weak, watery and full of beans and maybe some other vegetables.  Our chili would make people in Pittsburgh fall over dead.\n\nI got a double sweet and hot sausage sandwich, the wife had the Philly, and the kids had corned beef and a ham.

(I like the good ones, but I can easily pass on average,) I will say that their cole slaw, which was vinegar rather than mayonnaise based, was quite good. And there fries were above average, but not as good as somewhere like say, Five Guys. \n\nThe ingredients in the sandwich were all pretty good. I had the Pastrami and my friend had the Angus steak. The bread, meat, cheese, etc., were all good quality and were distinct when tasted individually. The sandwiches also seemed to work OK as a package, but for some reason for me--aside from the novelty factor--they didn't stand out. I think that maybe with the fries and slaw in there, there is just too much going on and those two tend to dominate the whole sandwich. It really takes over and you hardly taste the quality of the other ingredients. \n\nOn the plus side, the sandwiches average about $7 each, and for that price, your get a pretty decent sandwich.

It's a bar, whaddya want? In fact, I rather enjoy the casual atmosphere. It just fits. \n\nI made lunchtime friends there, too. Truth be told, I was pretty tired and not feeling super social, but I think about 3 people came up and started conversations with me. (I blame it on my dashing good looks- yeah. I am *sure* that's it.)  \n\nGood eats. And totally cheap.  My entire lunch was like 12 bucks with the tip. It was hearty, filling, and I was very satisfied.  \n\nFrench fries & slaw on sandwiches is the best thing since.....(dare I say it?)......sliced bread.....", "business_id": "NeUf9FyCCIN4MEseNyqkXQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-07-18", "type": "review"}

The reviews looked good, why not give BSS a try. Baby in tow, I walked over in the heat and called a friend to meet me there. When I walked into BSS, I froze in terror. How is it possible that all of the reviews do not mention that this place looks like it hasn't been cleaned since it opened. Yikes. The floors were a mess, the chair cushions were torn and the staff don't seem to even notice nor do the customers. That may have something to do with the food but more on that later. I was pleasantly greeted by an older woman, Ma Roz I assume. She sent someone in the back to dig out a highchair and specifically asked him to clean it. Well, it came out about half clean with some hairs on it. Nothing wet ones couldn't handle. My friend arrived shorty and she was just as shocked as I was. Well, I was committed at this point so we were going to give it a try. We both decided on breakfast. I ordered the pancakes with a side of bacon. There are some interesting pancake mix ins to note such as marshmallow, thin mints and chocolate chip cookies. I decided to go with peaches and blueberries. It didn't take long for our food to arrive. My pancakes looked incredible though they were missing one thing, whipped cream. Not a problem, they easily remedied that situation. I took my first bite and ta da! The light bulb went on. I suddenly understood why locals would keep coming back to this place despite the decor- if you want to call it that. They quite possibly could have been the best pancakes I have ever eaten. The fruit was fresh. That's right, FRESH peaches. Not canned stuff like you might assume for a small establishment such as this. The bacon was also cooked to perfection. They definitely know how to do it right here. And the prices were very reasonable. $4.50 for 3 pancakes, or should I say heaven cakes, and only $.50 a mix in.  I think they may only accept cash here so, you may want to head to the ATM first. Although, I was shocked and quite honestly, taken aback by the decor of BSS, I was also blown away by the quality of the food. If they sunk a little money into cleaning, fixing the uneven floor and replacing the chair cushions this place would be top notch and easily deserve 5 stars.", "business_id": "o_wRqOpli9kyZGXlJtLLdA", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-07-17", "type": "review"}

I'd passed the Bloomfield Sandwich Shop countless times on my bike, and had often wondered about the food and the clientele.  When a friend cancelled alternate brunch plans with my on Fri., but I was still craving breakfast food, the idea occurred to me to finally check this place out.  I'm very glad that I finally did, given the sandwich shop provided me with one of the most memorable brunches I've had in PGH.\n\nThis place is the definition of a hole-in-the-wall--it's very small inside, so expect to get cozy with the owners and other customers during your visit.  In true diner style, CM and I opted to sit at the counter.  Indeed, space was at such a premium that at a couple points, one of the owners placed dirty plates on the counter a bit closer than I'd like for a minute or two before proceeding to clean them.  As for the decor, the best way to describe it is flower child kitsch, with a dash of sports (indeed, surprisingly, the paper placemats contained sports trivia).  You really do feel as though you're in the owners' kitchen when you're here.  CM described it as organized chaos, which I thought was quite apt.\n\nAs for the food, as far as I can tell, the sandwich shop offers the most inexpensive breakfast in PGH (aside from McD's, etc.)--everything on the menu is $5 or less, and the portions are generous.  Despite this, as others have mentioned, the quality of the food is quite good--on par with, if not better than, Pamela's, and leaps and bounds above EnP.  CM ordered a hobo cake, a breakfast sandwich consisting of eggs and cheese between two pancakes ($4.50), with bacon (+ $1.25), and I ordered the short stack of pancakes ($4.25) with Nutter Butter cookies and chocolate chips (+ $1.00).  Both entrees were delicious, and very satisfying, not to mention filling.  (In fact, CM fell into a carb coma shortly after going back to his place.)\n\nAlthough the food and prices are great, what really makes eating at the sandwich shop a real experience is the owners, Mike and Mama Ros.  Mike, who waited on us, has a great sense of humor, joking with us and making us feel like family from the time we walked in the door to the time we left--and even afterward (he greeted us again when he and Mama Ros were taking a break at the outside tables as we walked past on our way back to the car after taking a short walk).  From talking to him, we learned that he and Mama Ros have run the sandwich shop for 15 years (impressive!), and that he lived in San Jose, CA prior to moving to PGH.  We didn't get to talk to Mama Ros much, because she was working the grill at the time we were there and it was quite busy, but they both seem like great people.\n\nNeedless to say, we had an awesome first experience at the Bloomfield Sandwich Shop, and look forward to returning for more.  While I'm tempted to award 5 stars, there were a few minor shortcomings on the food front (use of boxed pancake mix, lack of maple syrup), and the chaotic atmosphere may not be for everyone.  Having said that, if you're looking for cheap and plentiful portions of basic diner fare done well served up by friendly owners, check out this neighborhood institution--it won't let you down!  4.5 stars.", "business_id": "o_wRqOpli9kyZGXlJtLLdA", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-07-05", "type": "review"}

I've been eating there for years and I've never been disappointed. Good food good service, family run. The theme inside the sub shop is all about cars and there's a bar in back. \n\nI have an unhealthy obsession with one of their sandwiches called the z-28. ( see picture) Its a fabulous cheese steak sub and it comes with all the things that dreams are made of,  including marinated steak, sauteed onions, white American cheese and the more minced garlic than you can imagine. The bread is baked fresh daily from a local bakery and is to die for. Some times I get peppers and mushrooms too. \n\nI love this sandwich so much that last labor day i had my boyfriend pick up a sedan (2 ft) z-28 sub and bring it with him from Pittsburgh to Detroit. so we could enjoy it together on our picnic. Sick right? Well I'll have you know that I have seriously considered giving them a call and seeing if they would be willing to ship one to me in LA. No matter the cost. \nI've tried a few other things there too. I think it was the fire bird. Which ever one had chicken and marinara. That was decent. Their loaded cheese fries are awesome. Lots of bacon bits. They call them something else though. Something car related. \nMy boyfriends favorite sub was the carhops special (hot) which is a favorite of many. I didn't really stray to much from my usual sandwich but they have lots of other subs and pizza too. \n\nNow let me just say that in the past five years I have tried to find a decent cheese steak sub that is at least comparable to the z-28 but its just no use. That sandwich is unique to carhops and always will be. The only place that has even come close is Jersey Mikes sub shop in Burbank. (which I'll be reviewing later) Its pretty good but I have nearly unreachable expectations for what I think a cheese steak sub should be so, I will continue to carry a torch for Carhops subs for as long as I have to. \nI love you carhops, I'd marry you if it were legal and sane to do so. \n- Love Laura", "business_id": "aIzx9R8MN9VgSSJt1jy5TA", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-06-19", "type": "review"}

I have only been here a few times, but have never been disappointed.  I have tried an array of sub shops in my time and I can honestly say that this is one of the better ones.  The menu boasts a wide variety of subs and toppings including a Vegetarian menu, if you are in to that, but what separates it from most places is their emphasis on the Cheese Steak and their generous portions of meat.  Most shops around here tend to be a little lean on the meat and they more than compensate you for your dollar.  A regular does me just fine, but for those of a more carnivorous nature, they also have their Ultra menu which gives you double the meat if not more.  Another thing that i find refreshing is their Shoestring french fries, that they provide you with as a side if you dine in extra if you take out.  They also offer a Chicken Cheese Steak, which is also difficult to find in most shops.  Drink wise, they offer a variety of craft soda, craft beer, and of course your fountain.  Refills are extra. \n\nOnto the Service.  In all honesty it can be a little hit or miss.  I have gone and have had great service where my food is ready and brought out immediately and there have been times where I have sat and waited a bit too long.  Having worked in food service I understand that it isn't perfect every time, but generally the wait is worth with it.  Another thing to keep in mind is that the restaurant is Cash Only.\n\nIf anyone is looking for a sub shop with character and delicious hoagies I would highly recommend it.

The fries were piping hot and perfectly seasoned.  Our corn-dogs were the perfect combination of golden batter and awesome dog, and the burger and regular dogs were gone before I could ask the others how they were :)  The ketchup on the table was a little low, but I think we were there just after the lunch rush, so that was understandable.\n\nBy the time I was ready for a refill on my diet coke before heading out, there was a small line at the register.  The cashier waved me to the front of the line when he saw my cup, so I didn't have to wait while others ordered -- I was highly surprised, and very thankful for his consideration.  I wish more restaurants did that.\n\nOne of the earlier reviewers mentioned confusion with picking up baskets right next to the utensil area -- when I visited, there was a young woman running food out (she called the number and waited for the correct person to raise their hands).

Plus the fries are always hot and fresh made to order yummy!! \n\nFYI the BF is rather picky and can be snobby about restaurants but he loved this place too ;-) just saying!!", "business_id": "nkNdTqpv1m5GBKx8xrpluw", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-08-19", "type": "review"}

The menu, in paper and on the wall, is quite large, and with just enough time to eat and run to the next appointment, I quickly skimmed the menu and settled on a half sandwich (roast beef) and the New England clam chowder.  One friend chose the same as me except the potato soup and a 1/2 of aturkey club, and the other friend chose a cheesy baked potato.  If you are familiar with this restaurant, which has many locations throughout the Charlotte area, you will remember that you must order at the counter.  It was a very quick and friendly process at this location.  Also, a nice older gentleman that comes around and ask you how you are doing, if he can be of any help, and asks if he can clear stuff away for you.  Now the food part:  My roast beef sandwich was lacking in thickness of meat, and a bit fatty on the roast beef.  My New England clam chowder was hot...it's hard to please a New Englander when it comes to chowda'...but not hardly any clams, too uniformed cut potatoes and lots of emulsifiers does not a chowder make. Now onto my friends plates.  The potato soup was described as hot and creamy and the 1/2 a turkey club sandwich was quite large and nicely put together.  The baked potato that my other friend had was gi-normous.  I'm telling you, this thing could have been used as a regulation sized football.  Where the heck do they find potatoes that big I wonder?  Really, I had to do a triple take to see whether it was 2 potoatoes cleverly disguised as one, but it wasn't, it was just one big 'tater.  Okay, I know, I'm going to far on the size of the potato, but boy did it look goooooooddd!  It had 2 types of cheese, a nice cheddar cheese for color and a wonderful stringy mozzarella.  \nThe prices for all these items came up to about $25.00.  Really pretty good for 3 people needing a quick lunch.\nI'll go back to McAlister's again, but I think, next time, I'll be ordering that pig skin of a potato!", "business_id": "t719u5GZY0yPX4U7t5whrg", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-08-11", "type": "review"}

When I walked in I was welcomed by the worker at the order counter. She was very courteous and nice, patient and offered pretty good advice, or at least she tries to. I asked her between the mashed potato and the potato salad, which side was better. She said definitely the potato salad. I never tried the mashed potato here but the potato salad I got was pretty great, at least much better than my sandwich. To proceed with my story, after she took my order, She handed the order over the kitchen counter and gives it to another high school/college student who is making the orders. The cook looked like she was ready to get out and dislikes her job a lot. I picked a table out on the patio to sit, which was quite nice. It has a sun roof, metal tables and chairs, fenced in privacy with the shrubs. My order was brought out to me by the lady who took my order. When she puts my food down she asked if I wanted anything else. \n\nThe food was OK. I think it definitely reflects that not a lot of attention was put on the making of the food, by the impatience of the cook. My veggie griller was a 3/5 ish...so it was not AMAZING like the girl who took my order had said. But it's alright, at least she was trying to be peppy and encouraging. \n\nYou cannot refill your own drinks at Mcalister's. You also cannot order fries with your sandwich, which is not an option for the sides. The ambiance is dark on the inside, that is why I chose to sit on the patio. I have tried several of Mcalister's sandwiches and none of them were more than a 3/5. That is the thing, if you are ok with paying an average of $8.50 for a sandwich and a small side made by an inexperienced high schooler cook. I have nothing against Mcalister's hiring the younger population, because I know how it is when you need to make money for the summer or during the school year to have some pocket money. However, this is just something customers need to take into consideration, you can't expect gourmet sandwichs here. I think the next time I go back I'll try one of their spuds(fancy baked potato)...But i have not yet been able to justify paying $8 for a baked potato...", "business_id": "t719u5GZY0yPX4U7t5whrg", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-06-21", "type": "review"}

I absolutely love this place and everything on the menu.  When I was a kid the best times were when my father would take an afternoon delivery to the east side and swing by NOTO on the way back.  It was always such a great surprise when my sister and I would be called in for dinner, and right away you could smell those spices!  Those are some of my favorite memories, and to this day I get a rush of excitement just walking in to the place when I get that first waft...  It really is the best outside of the Gulf.\n\nI really can't even start on what my favorites are because every time I pick something off the menu it becomes my new favorite.  The po' boys are without exception great.  The roast beef was my first love, and I keep coming back to this one.  The French bread is perfect - crisp and the perfect texture for the sandwich.  It took me a while to try the fried oyster po' boy - I was not so adventurous as a kid - but after trying this I see why this is my mother's favorite.  The Gulf shrimp and the fried chicken are incredible.  This place is a 5 star easily on the strength of the po' boys alone, but the rest of the menu is not to be skipped.  The jambalaya is great for those that can't take too much heat, and even better with a bit of Tabasco for those that can.  The shrimp creole - HOO BOY!  Spicy but not excessive, it has enough heat to get you sweating and the flavors are spot on.  Same for the shrimp etouffee.  The red beans & rice with double sausage is my all-time favorite comfort food.  Most of the time I can't make up my mind, so I hit up the Mardi Gras combo, which gives you all three.  Perfection!  And it all comes with a piece of cornbread to finish it all off.  \n\nI've only been to the Fordem location, though there is another on Monroe Street.  I'm certain that had I not graduated prior to this location opening I would have made it a regular destination.  As it is, I love coming down Sherman then Fordem, and you're suddenly right there looking at the mural on the side of the building.

One glance and I could see the stocking that should have taken place BEFORE opening did not.  There were five people behind the pastry/bagel counter, lots of scrambling and not happy faces.   At one point I heard one of the more senior staff quietly asked the manager, 'can I ask why nothing is stocked?'  Clearly I was not the only one with this impression.\n\nI have noticed this in the past, and I have adjusted my schedule to accommodate.  I try and stop a bit later than the 6 am opening to avoid waiting the extra time it takes for staff to get the food out of bins etc. before they can prepare it.  \n\nWhat I do not expect is to be treated rudely.  After 4-5 minutes of standing at the register unacknowledged I finally asked if I was at the wrong register.  There were no less than five people behind the counter at this time, and not a single one acknowledged my presence.  The person closest to me, the manager, replied abruptly, while he continued to stock, 'the two girls are filling an order for multiple bagel packs'.  No 'sorry to keep you waiting', or 'someone will be with you a moment'.  Or maybe he could have taken an order himself?  When someone did finally take my order, there was no apology for the wait.\n\nI later called Panera and spoke with the manager Dennis.  He took the opportunity to tell me how many years he has been a manager at Panera, twelve I believe he said.  Apparently if you are employed a long time, that entitles you to be rude and indifferent to customers.  He did offer words of apology; however his voice tone and attitude were not at all apologetic, and clearly it was not genuine.\n\nThe food here is decent, but I'm not sure the disorganization, wait time, and poor customer service is worth the bagel.", "business_id": "S2x-rEziU3ONR9zO_vpPxA", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-08-02", "type": "review"}

I stopped and stared at the menu. One of the guys working there highly recommended the pastrami, even giving me a sample over the counter. Now I was torn....until I saw my answer.  The best of both worlds...the Vic's Madness!  Egg salad AND Pastrami.....I chose the marble rye as my base. First an egg salad layer topped with another piece of marble rye then a generous stack of pastrami a couple slices of Swiss cheese and topped with another slice of rye. \nNever enough mustard, I added extra deli mustard to both layers of the sandwich. Choosing the french fries in a rush, I wish I had gone for the potato salad or the fruit cup. Don't get me wrong the fries are very good, extra crispy and seasoned just wish now I had taken that option. At $9ish without a drink it can seem a little pricey relative to Subway (which is just another block or so up the street), I can assure you that this is MUCH better!! \nNow I have \"half\" a sandwich (technically a whole) left for later....", "business_id": "9BH18avE46LlHMvJn67MaA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-08-12", "type": "review"}

They also have a convenient online ordering system so you can place your order and pick up when you are ready.  \n\nTheir sandwiches are fresh made to order with exactly what you want.  Try one of their signature sandwiches, YUM! Or keep it simple...it's your choice. If you are not that hungry they offer a mini version of most sandwiches (using one slice of bread but super generous fillings)  I personally prefer to keep it simple, generally going for one of the following, ham sandwich on dark rye with everything, egg salad on dark rye (no cheese) with everything or peanut butter (house made) with honey on whole grain. \n\nThey offer a variety of beverages including beer, wine and fresh brewed iced tea. You can feed your sweet tooth here with a variety of pastries or select candies they offer.  A happy hour is offered in the evenings, sometimes with live music.  \n\nThe service is quick , friendly and the ingredients fresh.  Crisp leaf lettuce and tomato on your sandwich are not treated as an afterthought here.

Now, I will always be a big guy (not \"two fat twins on their matching motorcycles\" big, but you know, not little) but I definitely am eating more appropriately. However, I work in an office, and around 11:30, people start to double-think their lunch choices. Yes, the night before, a breakfast bowl from Jimmy Dean sounds like an excellent lunch selection, but all that pushing of buttons and watching your meal spin in the microwave? Forget it; one \"What are you doing for lunch\" from a buddy and I was out of there.\n\nAthenian was a prime lunch spot for me for awhile, and just fell out of favor. No time like the present to return, plus SB had never been there before today. We took the 2 minute drive to Central and rolled in to a 1/3 filled Athenian Express. Happy to have missed the rush, I immediately ordered my favorite dish, the gyro feta (no tomatoes/onions, add lettuce) with fries, and SB got a chicken sub and potato salad.\n\nFirst issue, no fountain soda? If I can't destroy myself with aspartame in my free refills, it's not a great lunch. Plus, I don't like drinking out of cans unless its a more adult beverage. Fix yo machine, Athenian!\n\nOutside of the $1.50 soda, the meal was as good as always. It was a bit lighter on the feta than usual (and LOVE me some feta goodness), but still had quite a pile. The meat was thick and cooked through, definitely filled up the pita to an overflowing Greek party. The french fries weren't overcooked, which is good because burned fries suck fully. Add in a side of tzatziki sauce to poor over everything, and times were well spent. It's a ton of food for what you pay, and one of the best deals downtown.\n\nMy coworker didn't fair quite as well, but it was more his preferences than issues with the meal. His chicken sub came with a huge breast, which I would think is a good thing, but for him caused the sandwich to be overstuffed (like I said, weird preferences). He demolished the entire thing, so it must have not been too bad, along with the potato salad, which he was a fan of as well.\n\nAll in all, very good lunch experience. I usually get take-out, but the Greek team had their World Cup game, so it seemed appropriate to hang out and watch the \"exciting\" 0-0 match-up.

I don't think they all taste the same either....the garlic rice in some of the wraps is great, and I normally don't like rice in wraps. \n\nEvery time I go here the people are ALWAYS nice, even when getting eye rolls, sighs and rude comments from customers.

And the menu offers quite a bit of variety for a wrap shop.  They have some fairly straightforward wraps, and some that are quite interesting (Very Brady Clubster, anyone?).  \n\nI always look forward to seeing the weekly specials.  Sometimes they do not sound intriguing in any way.  Other times they are the best thing on the menu.  I wish a couple of them would turn into regular menu items, but oh well.\n\nAs for sides, I haven't gone wrong yet.  Their soups are always good.  The chips and salsa are quite tasty as well.  But the Pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance is the pasta salad (in my humble opinion, of course).  It's so simple, so tasty and just a bit unique.  \n\nAnd the service, while sometimes slow is always friendly.  They work HARD there and do quite a bit of business.   The girl up front with the pineapple tattoo on the back of her arm - she's a sweetheart and always in a good mood despite how busy they are.  \n\nMy *only* complaint is the parking, which is minimal.

There have been a few times where I've driven through and couldn't get a spot and had to either go someplace else or be creative in my parking.

I can understand being new at a job, we have all been there, but why make the newest person on the team (and if he isn't the newest he is just the slowest) run the bread/start station?  There were clearly faster workers further down the line who would regularly go out to the dining room and clean up.  Also, the entire time we were there (more than 30 minutes) she, the manager, was sitting at a table by herself, earbuds plugged into her phone and text book open.  This was the lunch rush!  Not only wasn't she helping, but she was taking up one of a few available tables.  When she was needed she would shake her head unapprovingly and walk over to help.  At any given time there were anywhere from 3-6 people waiting in line to give their order, terrible managerial skills in my opinion.  She was focused on herself and would only take time to help when absolutely needed, or she would take a break to bark orders to the employees who were working their tails off.  We went to this location because it was slighly closer to where we work, but will not again return.  In addition, it would seem their toaster is on too high, both our subs came out hard and crispy.

However this location does not deserve your business.\n\nHere was my experience...\n\nI walked in and a small lady was to take my order(mind you, you cannot even see your sandwich being made because they've blocked their sandwich window with a metal cover.) So don't be anticipating seeing if you want more or less of something on your sandwich because they've decided you shouldn't have that privilege.....\n\n--As I was trying to order a man in back was clearly in a argument and raising his voice with someone on the phone. (Found out he was the owner, and that's about as unprofessional as it gets for someone running a business)--\n\nBack to the sandwich... I simply ordered a veggie and cheese. Asked for all the veggies on it but like two things. (They have probably 8-10 toppings.) What I later found out I received: cheese, lettuce, tomato and a couple olives. WHAT?!!?  ......... The owner proceeds to end his argument on the phone to ring up my sandwich, attempts to charge me $2 more for the cheese on it(mind you, the same amount I get at my other location). When I tell him 'no' (instead of honoring it and giving good customer service) he has the lady remove two slices of cheese(that certainly he'll throw away) and takes the $2 charge off! He also tells me that he is going to report the other location I went to for years to CORPORATE because they don't do things the way he does. WHO DOES THAT??\n\n......END RESULT.....\nI received a very empty sandwich at a regular price. Poor service. And a bad energy and taste in my mouth for a place the doesn't deserve your business!!

It's ok pizza but there's a lot of competition in this area. I haven't had their wings in years. I don't remember being impressed, the standard wings that are fried then have sauce poured on them. Most any place does it this way. \n\nSo why even review this place? two words\n\nBROASTER CHICKEN!!!!!!\n\nWhere have you been all my life? It's basically pressure cooker chicken, so it has a fried texture to it, but it's not as greasy as fried chicken. I wouldn't call it healthy, but it certainly could be healthier than fried chicken\n\nIt was kinda pricey, I remember paying 8 bucks for a 4 piece (2 white 2 dark) with XL potato wedges, plus two other sides. I had fries, they were parmesan and herb sprinkled, and good. Macaroni salad was fine, nothing special, but I always hope for mac and cheese. The wedges were also excellent, and as I said, three of them were almost an entire half potato.\n\nBut the chicken was the star. The outer coating was crispy, not as puffy as KFC or other fried chicken, and somewhat reminiscent of home cooked chicken. The inside had more of that roasted taste with very little if any grease. It's like getting rotisserie chicken with a fried coating.\n\nJust writing this review has me considering going to get some broasted tastiness later today.\n\nOh ya, service, etc. It was fine. Not slow, but not speedy. Again, no reason for praise or punishment for anything Streets of New York does. But that chicken?

When we got our new wings they looked a million times better. They were golden and smothered in some of the same weird sauce. These were still partially frozen. I didn't bother sending them back for fear they'd spit in my raviolis. My boyfriend ordered a Philly I ordered raviolis.  His sandwich was sub par. He said it was just some beef, melted processed provolone cheese on a dry sesame bun. Bummer, then my raviolis were big and round, the filling was nearly flavorless, obviously frozen and processed swimming in some sauce that was as tick as ketchup with a taste to match. We waited a long time between refilled and when they asked how my food was I told them it was gross. She left it at the table and brought the check about ten minutes later.

We just moved to Anthem from Dallas Texas and were looking for a great pizza/Italian place to eat at, but this is NOT the place.  We entered and there were only two other  dinners in the place, one was a family of 5 and the other was a family of 3, we were a party of 2.  We were seated and told that are waitress would be with us in just a minute.  Well, that minute turned out to be about 10 minutes.  Having had time to read the menu about a dozen times while we waited, when our waitress finally did show up we were ready to order but she ask us if we wanted to put in a drink order?  Really???  So we did put in an order for 2 glasses of wine and asked for water as well.  About 10 minutes later we received our wine (very small pour indeed) and no water?  As we were waiting for our food order (I'll get to that train wreck in just a minute) we noticed that the other two occupied tables were having issues with their orders and all we could hear was the waitress consistently apologizing, we also watch as the other tables food was delivered, ONE freaken plate at a time, first one child got some breadsticks, then about 4 minutes later the other child got a salad, then about 10 minutes later the father got his order, then they apparently asked for water and it was delivered ONE glass at a time by the same server (not waiter???) then we experienced the same absolutely mind numbing food delivery, with the exception that I had ordered the 10\" pizza (which was pretty good after a 20 minuet wait) but my wife had ordered a chicken pasta dish, which we never received.  The waitress brought the pizza and two plates and started to walk away and I ask where my wife's meal was and she looked stunned, walked away and came back and told us that she had turned in the order but the \"kitchen\" must have misread it, but she would re-enter the order, well that was about 2 glasses of wine each and one very small pizza later, which had already taken about 55 minutes....duh!  So we simply told her to cancel the order and we would just pay for the pizza and wine and be happy to leave.  It was one of the worst dinning experiences we have ever had.  The \"manager\" was there, tending a small bar, at which NO ONE was sitting, but he did manage to go and clean the back door glass while all of his customers were waiting for service.  It was a totally dysfunctional, totally unacceptable experience and I doubt that we will ever return, unless my wife bets me that it couldn't possible be that bad on a second visit and I might be willing to accept that \"sure bet\"!!!  Unfortunately in Anthem the dinning options are very limited and even the Legend Sports Bar (well, sort of a sports bar) is failing as it changes management???  I ordered a pizza there last  week and was told after a 15 minute wait that they had no cheese for the pizza because the whole kitchen/management team just weren't ordering any food?

Was I disappointed.   \n\nMy $8 tuna sandwich, straight off the menu, was supposed to come with fancy olives and red onion and came with neither - just tuna and copious arugula on spongy flatbread.  I was surprised, considering they make the same three or four items over and over, and disappointed, since I was craving a richly texured, crunchy construction. The tuna tasted fine - I think they put some lemon in it and maybe there's an olive or two pulverized beyond recognition into the paste - but it's no better than when I open a can of albacore at home and add a little horseradish or curry or what have you and slap some water chestnuts on top - or when I go to Subway and pile black olives, tomato and cheese on a larger, cheaper sub ( on admittedly inferior bread).  The bread here was round and chewy, spongy, but not crunchy at all - reminded me of the bread at Schlotsky's - the whole thing was just kind of flat.  \n\nMy son had the salami and provelone and said it was \"good\". Not great or amazing. Just \"good\".  We spent $21.62 on two smallish sandwiches and creme sodas to go. No sides. Meh.  \n\nThe girls in front were friendly and efficient and the food came out incredibly fast - so quick I wondered if (dare I say it?) my sandwich was PRE-MADE. Mine tasted like it could have been. I dont know if the bread was intended to be warm or not, but after a 10 min drive home, it wasnt.  They use nice heavy paper to wrap up the food and a cute paper \"to-go\" bag with a handle. \n\nThe waiting area is small and there's one (1) metal folding chair for people to sit on.

Oh, so close!\n\nI've stopped in to Pane Bianco a couple of times and have enoyed the non-commercial sandwiches here.  And by \"non-commercial\", I mean the type my Italian Mom used to make when I was a kid.\n\nOn my first visit I had what amounted to the caprese sandwich (mozzarella, tomato & basil.)  PB is known for its mozzarella, so I wasn't surprised by its goodness, but I swear the sprig of basil must have been just picked that day...so flavorful and fragant.  It really made the sammy!  The price was about $8.50.  If I would have stopped there, PB would have have five stars.\n\nOn my second visit I had the Market Sandwich (mortadella, peach relish, pecorino and greens).  The mortadella seemed a bit flavorless.  It was sliced thin (which I love) but could have used an extra layer.  It just seemed as though the pecorino (perhaps due to the saltiness) and sweetness of the peach relish (a slight departure from the website description) overpowered the mortadella.  In fact, the sandwich was a bit on the dry side and could have used a bit more of the relish for moisture, especially in light of the fact this type of bread tends to be on the dry side.  The relish really shouldn't be any sweeter as, it too, runs the risk of overpowering the flavor of the meat.  If Chris Bianco can find a way to add greater volume to the relish without adding any additional sweetness, I'd give PB five stars!  Now, if only something can be done about the $11 price tag, this could be an \"A+\" sandwich!\n\nFeel like getting experiemntal at home?  Be sure to grab a freshly baked loaf before you leave.  A bargain at just $3.\n\nMy only real disappointment is that PB isn't open on Sunday.  Hopefully, they'll expand once Lux moves from the space they occupy next door and Pane Bianco will have reason to expand both their space AND their hours of operation.  Who knows...maybe even offer some vino???\n\nI still crave Pane Bianco and can't wait to go back,  I'm already salivating over the Soppressata with Aged Provolone & Roasted Peppers.

Having made my pilgrimage to the eponymous pizzeria during my first trip to Phoenix, Pane had been on my radar since the day I moved to town but given the lunch-only hours and my office location in North Scottsdale I knew a weekend would be best and as luck would have it a new website (http://www.pizzeriabianco.com/) and seven day 11a-3p schedule had been rolled out just the week prior.\n\nArriving at the surprisingly large space (especially when compared to Matt's and JoBot from earlier that day - and compared to Pizzeria Bianco as well) shortly after 11:30 and allocating parking in the free lot juxtaposing the Light Rail I debated for a moment whether dine-in or to-go was best and opting for the former made my way into the restaurant where two couples already sat.  Greeted by one of two servers it was suggested I could take \"any seat I wanted\" and opting for a bench in the center of the room where a menu awaited I sat down to browse the menu as well as the daily specials listed on the chalkboard - almost all sounding appealing, but a bit different than the Saturday special listed on the website.  With a small list of beverages available I was asked soon if I was ready to order or if I needed a few minutes I deferred and requested a glass of water that would never reach even half-empty despite me drinking from it consistently and the restaurant soon filling to capacity.\n\nHaving debated the specials but eventually undeterred from the reason I'd come in the first place I soon placed my order for a sandwich and an 'appetizer' which I was told would be 'just a few minutes' and as while I waited I checked out the small market at the Take Away section featuring the famous focaccia, cans of tomatoes, dried pasta, and apparel before returning to my seat where my items would arrive shortly - the first a Manchego and Tomato Sauce Focaccia del Giorno featuring Bianco's delectable wood fired focaccia in all of its spongy glory topped with sweet, ripe tomatoes and an ample layer of briny Manchego; at $4.50 probably the most expensive \"Grandma Slice\" I've ever had yet at the same time also probably the best...or at least on par with that at DiFara in Brooklyn for best of its genre.\n\nMoving next to the original target of my desire, a sandwich of Bianco's House Made Mozzarella, Tomatoes, and Basil on Wood Fired Focaccia my first thought was \"wow - that is a lot of cheese\" while my second, after a bite, was \"wow - that is a lot of flavor.\"  Perhaps as pure of a sandwich as you can find and the result of exquisite ingredients on top quality bread there is really nothing 'special' about the composition of this sandwich aside from the fact that it simply works - a largely unmanipulated masterpiece only improved by a touch of sea salt and cracked black pepper.\n\nLargely unaware on entering that Pane serves dessert it was with much delight that I realized soon after sitting down that three options were available that day and while the flourless chocolate cake I saw emerge from the kitchen to the table next to me looked quite nice there was simply no way I was passing up the Organic Vanilla Bean Rice Pudding with Candied Pecans - another simplistic stunner with creamy Arborio rice imbued with a rich vanilla custard flicked with whole vanilla beans and a few pecans for crunch.  Delicate and smooth, flavorful without being overly sweet, and *almost* thick enough to stand a spoon up straight it was not quite the best rice pudding I've ever had - but a top five contender without a shadow of a doubt - a reason in and of itself to return to Pane Bianco...though to be fair, if I returned it would take pretty spectacular daily specials to prevent me from ordering the exact same trio of items once again.  With Chris and his team now two for two it is only a matter of time before I make my way to Italian Restaurant... and honestly, that time is likely measured in hours and days as opposed to weeks and months.", "business_id": "-AAig9FG0s8gYE4f8GfowQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-08-13", "type": "review"}

Seriously...this is one of the few spots on Central not open late!\n\nI made it at 7-ish, not realizing they closed at 8. I didn't want to be THAT GUY, but staff was definitely still eager to serve a first timer. We kicked off supper with bread and olive oil. Theirs was the best olive oil I've enjoyed on this side of the Atlantic. Delicious, even if the thick, fresh bread was a tad sweet for my taste. \n\nIn mere minutes, I was delightfully presented with the \"Sonny Boy\", a simple pizza with soppressata + kalamata, or in painfully layman terms, pepperoni and olive. I usually hate olives, even kalamata, but these were good. There are limits to any desirable quality in a pizza. We don't want it to be too salty, and surprisingly this was not. We don't want the sauce, crust, or any singular element to overpower another aspect, and for the most part, it was all well balanced. I was able to appreciate it all. \n\nMy only criticism is the cheese itself, which would be refreshing in a caprese or on a white pie, but was just not BOLD enough. It was too milky. Too fatty, even. After doing the most extensive research that has ever gone into a review, perhaps this is from using a more local product rather than the rare Mozarella Di Bufala variety that's hard to get your hands on, but has an unforgettable taste. \n\nIt was so, so close to perfection. Or perhaps I've got some leveling up to do before reaching the status of a true cheese aficionado. Feel free to give your input. \n\nOverall, this is very VERY good pizza, decent bread, and great service. As they closed, they even gave us a complementary loaf to-go.  I was honestly hoping to just grab a sandwich, which I will return to do on the rare occasion I'm not on Central for the nightlife. I wish I could give a 4.5, but since they were nice, a full 5 stars it is. That's what being nice gets ya. =) \n\nPS--I still can't believe my Yelp friends bragged about waiting in line for 3 hours to get a Bianco pie back in the day.

There's always some nostalgic value for places that concentrate on food and comfortable homey environ so that they aren't so hip it hurts.\n\nMy first visit to Duck and Decanter was on a recent Thursday for lunch and was filled with the normal Camelback Corridor office drones and car salesmen. Delicious mix of people I tell you, but even more delicious was the maple glazed ham and muenster sandwich on whole wheat topped with avocado.  My lunch buddy opted for the tuna and it was pretty tasty but not the best I have ever had.  The pricing was average and with chips and a soda came out to about $10. Bonus points for the cheese selection feature bite-sized samples for a dollar or so. \n\nThe wine store was small and charming and the layout of the place is so unconventional (with most seating upstairs) that it makes for some fascinating exploring once you get over the overwhelming collection of tacky bric a brac everywhere. \n\nI'm disappointed that it's kind of hidden, but that's probably best since I would be here all the time for a sammie and some wine come happy hour.

Everyone I know that has ever mentioned the Duck tells me they like it. Yes I have been several times over the years. But a few days ago I was at our office which is on 7th ave just south of Thomas. I was really hungry and wanted something to eat, this in it self is kind of unusual as I can more than likely wait until the end of the day before I have to eat. Plus the fact I have enough fat on me to last a few months I would not be starving to death any time soon if I missed a meal or three. So I asked Bruce, you remember Bruce he is the guy I am always asking things when down at the office. I wanted something delivered as I wanted to stay in the office to get a contract ready for signing. The only place he could think of was the Duck, but he said he could go and get it much faster. So I said ok and gave him my card and told him to get what he wants and order me I think it is called the Ducky or something like that.  Man he was back much more quickly than I had expected him to be, so they must have been on the ball in making the food. But the food as I always find; just nondescript. NO discernable flavour just a mish mash of textures and blandness. So I can say I like the building, the quickness they have gotten my food out and the patio. I guess the folks are also nice, but do not remember them so they were not not nice. I just do not get the praise this place gets, I find much better food for less elsewhere.

I had always wondered about this place because, an East Coast transplant, I assumed that it was some kind of a pub/restaurant typical of big Northeast cities. It was the name that threw me. I was completely taken by surprise when I entered. It is a deli/market/bakery combo. Think Cracker Barrel merged with Le Grand Orange sprinkled with Which Wich. Fascinating concept!\n\nThe sandwich that I ordered was delicious and I took a heap of pickles that come with. I managed to avoid buying anything else like chips or baked goods, but did so with a sad heart. Everything looked wonderful. My friend and I had a great lunch and leisurely talked for hours. No wait staff came to give us dirty looks or cleared our plates as we took our last bites. It was a good experience and I will definitely come again.

I discovered them while searching for a breakfast option one morning. \n\nI actually had a hard time finding them at first. They're located by the parking garage in the SE corner of a plaza that is on the SE corner of E Camelback Rd and N 16th St. Overwhelming amount of directional abbreviations aside, if you manage to find this gem, you will not be disappointed.\n\nI stopped here twice during my Phoenix visit. I had the breakfast burrito with egg, cheddar chz and black forest bacon for breakfast one morning. It was pretty good. Adding their salsa is really what increased the flavor and brought it up a notch. \n\nOn another day, we stopped in for lunch and had the marinated roasted chicken sandwich on sourdough bread. This was a game changer. The fresh, delicious roasted chicken was so good. It tasted like something your mom would make for you if she really loved you. Yeah, that's right mom, I'm calling you out. This is the sandwich I needed growing up. Not bologna and processed cheese. We can still salvage this relationship. Balls in your court lady. \n\nThe food here was great but they're also a specialty store. They have an assortment of greatness throughout. Barrels of coffee beans, containers of different teas, wine, cheeses, beer, different kinds of oils, all kinds of stuff. \n\nThere's seating all over, including outside, but I chose the upstairs loft both times. It was relaxing and there are giant photos of AZ wildlife all around upstairs too... I like animals... and free WiFi. Yup, they have free Wifi.

It's in a tucked away corner of a strip mall.  It neighbors a furniture store and a couple of other places who very  explicitly do NOT want you parking in their store spots if you are visiting Duck & Decanter.  It's huge on the inside.  There is a little cheese section, a wine section, espresso bar with a large selection of loose teas, foodstuffs area, indoor & outdoor seating, an upstairs seating gallery, the deli...like whoah.  It's kind of like an old mercantile of days yore.  You order your sandwich and then have time to peruse the store.  They have lots of Haribo gummi snacks, including my favorite twin cherries.  There are many options for sandwiches.  I got a spicy pulled pork bbq sandwich with cole slaw inside, served in a onion-y kaiser roll.  At least I think it was supposed to be spicy.  It was good, the BBQ sauce was a little sweet for me.  The cole slaw didn't really have a \"bite\" to it, but did keep the bbq and sammie moist and stuff.  I got some seriously overpriced for the size macaroni salad, and it was some of the most mayonaissey mac salad I've had outside of Hawaiian mac salad.  You can take as many pickle spears as your heart desires.  They have a dessert case that looks delicious.  Can't really say that their customer service was stellar.  I initially walked around the store trying to figure out if I wanted to stay for a drink or whatever.  There were a lot of people working. Somebody followed me from section to section, but never bothered to ask if I needed help.  Just tailed me like a store security guard.  Maybe I looked particularly suspicious on this day...without even wearing my escaped convict prison jump suit.  Then when I opted to just get a sandwich, the staff just totally disappeared except for the sandwich maker, who had to finish up what she was doing to help me.  Kind of a weird vibe.  \nSo, would I go back?  Sure, one visit does not make a complete story.  Heat does crazy things to people and it was a CRAZY hot day.

I've been eating here since I was 12 years old, and when I grew older and lived in the neighborhood I ate there almost once a week, many times even daily. Clearly, I'm not even exaggerating a little when I say that I love this place and think the food is amazing. Lately, however I have been experiencing a lot of issues with my orders being made improperly and a lack of support from the staff in compensation for the issue.\n\nI haven't eaten there for a long time, it might be my actual favorite place to eat and for the most part if I could eat anything at all this is what I would choose, so I recently decided to place an order. I got home with my food and realized that everything was made improperly. I called them before they closed to make sure they knew what happened and they gave me credits for free food.\n\nAfter remembering how good their food is, despite the mistakes made to my order, I was left craving more and decided to try again so I could use the free credits they gave me. When I got home the food was made incorrectly again, but I live far and really didn't feel like driving back, so I picked everything off that wasn't supposed to be there and moved on with my day.\n\nSoon after I took a friend of mine there because she had never been and despite these two past experiences I still considered it my favorite place to eat. We ordered, waited, got our food, and sat down. I opened my sandwich to find it made incorrectly, yet again. After becoming quite sad, my friend encouraged me to go back inside and tell them. They remade the sandwich for me and everything was fine.\n\nBecause of my recent issues, when I placed my latest order, I made sure to ask the person taking my order to have the person making the sandwich double-check the bag to insure my food was made exactly as I ordered it. He assured me that he would, and when I picked up my food he confirmed with me that he did indeed check. Unfortunately when I got home I found that my food was made wrong, surprise! AGAIN.\n\nI reached my breaking point and called asking to speak with a manager. I gave her an in-depth explanation of the situation just as mentioned above and asked if it'd be possible to be refunded for today's food and was told that she'd need to look more seriously into the matter and call me back the next day to let me know what she'd be able to do for me.

(I promise I'm going to start going through my memory bank and start writing more of these types of reviews)\n\nSo like I said, went to NYPD for a quick bite today. Ordered a small chicken ceasar salad to go. The cashier was a younger guy and really friendly. I thought there was a deal for checking in on FourSquare, but the manager that was standing nearby said it was only for dine-in with a group of 3 or more. He gave the discount to me anyways (shhh!). Extra points in my book. Salad came out quickly...drove back to work...and enjoyed a fresh and delicious lunch! The end. =)\n\n(Oh and their garlic knots are ridiculous too)", "business_id": "TqHTtjPANCBKGsjGBjDoQQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-07-14", "type": "review"}

The staff is VERY FRIENDLY and I do not have one bad thing to say about this place's service or their regular pies. With that said.....\n\nWhen I moved from Michigan it was hard for me to find good pizza down here. Papa John's is terrible, Little Cesar's is also terrible - THEN I FOUND NYPD! \nI've only tried their regular pizzas and, this past weekend, tried their Sicilian pizza (which is essentially deep dish). BEWARE: the Sicilian pizzas are HUGE! If you've got two or three people to feed - the half size is PLENTY! ALSO BEWARE: the Sicilian is mostly dough, which soaks up all of the sauce and depending on what kind of toppings you have, ends up being very watery because of veggies. I ordered Da Works Sicilian and was VERY disappointed - which surprised me because I LOVE THEIR REGULAR STYLE PIZZAS THEY ARE TO DIE FOR! Anyway, the Sicilian is NOT A DEEP DISH - it's extra dough, under cooked and they didn't even have the courtesy to warn me HOW DOG-GONE BIG IT IS!\n\nOtherwise, their regular pizzas are amazing! Totally worth $20 per pie. My favorite is between Da Works and Big Kahuna - they know how to do a Hawaiian pizza. \n\nI recommend this place to anyone I run into looking for a good pizza joint!", "business_id": "TqHTtjPANCBKGsjGBjDoQQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-08-26", "type": "review"}

We said it is okay, not to worry. The manager came over a few seconds later and apologized for not having the Tabasco and said he had sent someone to get it.

The vast majority of the waiters looked like firefighters (okay, that's probably the uniform, probably supposed to look like the police, plus the fact that Arizona people look slightly different from the Miamians I'm used to), and they were super friendly and on top of things despite the increasing number of customers.

It feels a bit too spread out in there. \n\nThe service has been good on both occasions that I have gone. Everyone who works in the restaurant seems to be very friendly and welcoming. I've only been on weekdays and both times I think the bartender was also serving as a waitress which made things a bit held up when the restaurant unexpectedly filled up around 8 PM on a Monday night, but the staff handled it well and did their best to make sure everyone was taken care of.\n\nThey have a decent draft list of beers, about 5 options, with one of them being an NYPD custom beer. Some happy hour specials too which included discounted beers and pitchers. \n\nAs for the food - I have tried a few different things. The garlic knots, bruschetta pizza, bruschetta appetizer, and penne ala vodka with sausage and peppers. All of it was very good. The portions on the pasta are BIG! Not that I'm complaining, I love leftovers. I want to try the dessert because they look incredible and they seem to have a variety of options.\n\nI'm so happy to have a great pizza place like this nearby and I plan to return in the future.", "business_id": "TqHTtjPANCBKGsjGBjDoQQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-08-19", "type": "review"}

Cafeteria style, so know what you want by the time you get to the counter.  It's a great place to go on Sunday morning and read the paper while you enjoy a carved sandwhich.  Of course, there is nothing heathy about any of this food, but it's solidly tasty and satisfying.  Slightly pricey (hot dog special is a good economic choice), but the atmosphere is relaxing, always clean, consistent quality, and they have free self-service water, so you don't have to bother with getting back into line if you're still thirsty.  \n\nWhat makes it unique is its authenticity and distinction from chain and fastfood stores.  It's not particularly interesting food, just good to satisfy your deli cravings.  Plus, I believe it's locally owned with gives it actual personality.\n\nCome on Sunday and then walk down to PetCo.

Having known the family of this establishment my whole life, I can personally attest to their devotion to their food, the customers and the atmosphere.  The Garcia family first hit a home run with their original deli location at Christown Mall.  When they moved out of Christown they opened up a pair of locations with huge fanfare both at the Colonade and at Arrowhead Mall.  To be honest, I didn't think the Colonade would do all that well as they were invisible from Camelback Road.  Little did I know the following this place had.  Everytime I've gone the place has been jumping.  And rightfully so.\n\nWhen you walk in you immediately notice the fun color scheme as well as how clean it looks.  The aroma from the hot line is as alluring as you'd expect.  No waiters or reservations here.  Just hop in line and order your dish from the cooks as they make it right in front of you.\n\nMy tried and true favorite is the brisket sandwich on kaiser bread with a side of fruit and a slice of one of their fresh pies to boot.  Sometimes I'll grab some pastrami or corn beef as an alternative.  They've also got burgers and kosher hot dogs if you prefer.  Other sides include chili, fries, mac and cheese, or one of a number of soups.  The food is delicious but simple.  And whatever you order, you'll feel like you're in a New York style deli (without the NY attitude of course).\n\nSo why only 4 stars instead of 5?  Well for one, this hip deli near the Biltmore area isn't cheap.  True, you get what you pay for, but I couldn't afford to eat here everyday.  A good meal here usually runs around $15 -$20 so just be aware of that.  Also, this place is wicked busy, especially during dinner.  Usually you can find a seat, but it can get pretty noisy in there.  Don't let this scare you away though.  Especially if you live in the central Phoenix area.  Alot of the folks who eat here are people from the neighborhood so its highly possible you'll run into someone you know.  If you're on the west side, their location at Arrowhead Mall won't disappoint either.  \n\nLet's give props to the folks at Miracle Mile.  This small family operation has grown by leaps and bounds over the years, but you'd never know it talking to the owners.  The same humble attention to good food, a good atmosphere, and a neighborhood following still holds strong after all these years.  Success clearly hasn't changed this family recipe.", "business_id": "fmuj7u1gflmEjW-h0v9bwg", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-08-25", "type": "review"}

This was Hubby's suggestion, mind you, and he was pleased they had several vegetarian options. After a lunch of Peter Piper, however, even his lame veggie sandwich was pretty good to him. We'll see if I have to rush him to the ER later, since MM served sprouts when no one else is right now due to a contamination issue. He got his sandwich with a supposed potato knish. This was supposed to be creamy mashed potatoes with sour cream and seasonings in a pastry crust. What he got was an overly peppered dried out, square of potato chunks in an unnatural color wrapped in an anemic crust that had zero taste, crunch, or flake to it. It had that speckled look that old pastry gets. If this is what a knish is supposed to be, then they nailed it.\n\nI got the chicken and noodles with a side of mashed potatoes. It came with two inexplicable slices of untoasted bread. What is this? 1950? At least it wasn't Wonder Bread. It was wheat. I had asked for sour dough, when one guy told me there were no caraway seeds in the rye they served me initially. There were. The manager \"saved\" me by correcting his employee about the caraway, only to be given the third degree by the ghetto tart working the register. \"Why don't you like caraway?\" she asked. I tried not to stare at her ridiculously over-plucked eyebrows and garish make-up as I replied, \"I really don't like the taste.\" When she asked me \"Why?\" a second time, you'll be happy to know that I refrained from informing her that the gang-bangers she was obviously trying to attract would not likely be frequenting  this establishment. Anyway, the chicken and noodles dish was complete mush and the \"sauce\" was totally canned, and topped with a lovely hunk of congealed cheese. It was also not to temp. The mashed potatoes were 75% instant with some red skins thrown in for that \"real\" texture. Foul, foul, foul. \n\nHence, the grilled cheese.", "business_id": "fmuj7u1gflmEjW-h0v9bwg", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-06-15", "type": "review"}

It's similar to \"The Straw\" but with corned beef and coleslaw.  All sandwiches include fries and a pickle spear.  You can add everything from macaroni and cheese to steamed veggies on the side.

Of course, knowing their hours definitely helps. After planning on a stop at Blue Fin (which isn't open on the weekends), I ended up at Miracle Mile at Camelback Colonnade following a quick stop at Trader Joe's. I ended up being pleasantly surprised with the result, though the price was a little higher than I had hoped.\n\nWalking in, the decor is pretty laid back; clean and open, with a dessert station right by the door (never a bad idea) and an easy path to the counter. My first time there, so I had to do the \"What do I want?\" walk through the line. Luckily, it was slow, so I was able to pick out the Combo sandwich (pastrami and corned beef). Watching them make the sandwich, you could see how thin cut the meat was, and the marble rye looked fresh (other choices include sourdough, rye, and a few types of buns). There were a multitude of options for sides (french fries, a few pasta salads, etc), but I ended up paying the extra $1 for mac&cheese. From there, it was a quick walk to the register to pay $11 for my meal, along with grabbing some free horseradish.\n\nI took the food home, and it was worth the wait. The sandwich, which seemed a little small when the cook made it, suddenly grew to a thick mass of beef. I even had to pick off a few slices that were falling out before taking a bite. Gotta say, it was excellent. The pastrami and corned beef were a perfect match, and there was just enough fat to give it that extra burst of flavor. They give you regular mustard with the sandwich, but I preferred my own spicy mustard, with the occasional addition of horseradish (which had a good bite). The bread was perfect, and the crust broke away with every bite. Finally, the mac&cheese was a great addition. The flavor could have been stronger, but it was very cheesy and the pasta was firm without being overcooked.\n\nOverall,  this was a pretty good find. As others noted, the price is a little steep for a deli, but you will certainly get a full stomach for around $10, so I can't complain too much. It may not be a usual stop, but it was a good find.", "business_id": "fmuj7u1gflmEjW-h0v9bwg", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-06-12", "type": "review"}

(You know, hungry and angry.) I couldn't decide where I wanted to eat and that meant my poor husband had to make a decision. Driving around downtown Scottsdale, my husband saw a new restaurant with bright colors and decided that would be the place. Unfortunately, there wasn't any parking out front, so he drove around back. After we got out of the car, he saw Au Petit Four and knowing that I love French food, decided to take me here. \n\nWe didn't look at the menu posted outside, just walked right in and were slightly confused. The space is rather large and sectioned off into two areas - a bakery on one side and a restaurant on the other. A man and a woman were behind a counter in the restaurant side and asked if we wanted to sit down and dine. My husband said yes and we were seated in the completely empty dining section. In the entire building, it was just the two employees and my husband and me. (Awkward...) There was plenty of seating and open space. The walls were brown brick with pictures of Paris scattering the walls willy-nilly and all tables were covered with plastic red and white checkered table cloths. I didn't particularly care for the table cloths because they stuck to my legs. \n\nAfter looking at the menu, I shook my head at my husband saying I wasn't sure what I wanted to eat. After much indecision (the poor waitress had to come back a few times) I finally decided on the prosciutto sandwich and my husband ordered a savory crepe. \n\nWhile waiting for our food, I went to the bathroom. It was down the long entrance hall, passing by several open doors to the kitchen/storage closets. The bathroom was in dire need of some cleaning and restocking (barely any soap and I used the last paper towel). \n\nWhen I got back to our table, it was only a few short minutes before my sandwich arrived and shortly after the crepe. My sandwich came with the option of salad, chips, or pasta salad. I went with salad. The salad was basically mixed greens and salad dressing on the side. (The salad dressing was good, but I expected tomatoes or something else on the salad.) The sandwich itself was really good. The prosciutto was thickly sliced with even larger slices/hunks of slightly melted brie. There was also pesto spread, tomatoes, and lettuce. Overall, I loved my sandwich. The bread was fresh and really hit the spot. \n\nMy husband said he liked he crepe, but he only ate half of it. I tried a bite and preferred my sandwich much more.\n\nOverall, the only good thing in the entire experience was my sandwich. The fact that there weren't any other diners during lunch, the bathroom was lacking, and the \"just ok\" crepe, I can't say that I will be back. There are plenty of other places to get fantastic crepes and fantastic sandwiches. \n\nPerhaps their desserts are amazing?", "business_id": "wftoNIA0Q8nX-Da47psBCA", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-08-16", "type": "review"}

As I waited, my eyes began to sting, and the haze in the room was visible in the sunlight.  No dine-in for me.\n\nWhen looking at the menu, I thought the prices seemed slightly high.  Once I got my food, I felt that the prices were fair due to portion size.  I got the baba ganoush and grape leaves.  The grape leaves were awesome.  The baba ganoush was interesting, with a consistency that looked like hummus.  Totally creamy, no evidence of seeds.  It was dosed with so much liquid smoke that it kind of tastes like barbecue sauce.  Good at first, kind of sickening after half of it is gone.

The honey mustard gives it just enough tang to really bring out the flavor of the seasoned chicken.  My only \"beef\" with this sandwich is hot lettuce.  I'm sorry, but there are some things in this universe that were not meant to be, and lettuce being served on a hot sandwich (or on a hot Mexican food plate; more on that later) is not one of them!  \n\nMy most favorite sandwich here is the Symphony.  I like to think of it as a turkey club with a twist.  It's loaded with fresh turkey breast deli style meat, bacon, avocado, tomatoes, LOTS of alfalfa sprouts, cream cheese and mayo on wonderful 12 grain bread.  I usually hold the mayo, because that's just the kinda guy I am.  You might say, that's how I roll. But I say, I'm just not a mayo kinda guy...\n\nThe best part about lunch at Sacks is the silver dollar sized warm chocolate chip cookie you get with your sandwich.  And yes, it's been reported that the Tiki sometimes eats the cookie first, but having no photographic evidence, you can't prove it and I'll plead the 5th.  And speaking of tiki's there's a really cool Tiki at the Tutor Time just a few doors down to the north.  Check it out!\n\nOkay, I said the cookie was the best part of lunch at Sacks, but I lied.  The really super dooper best part about lunch at Sacks is the Market Spice Iced Tea.  Some days it's too weak, some days it's too strong, but on the days that it's just right, it will blow your socks off, so you might want to bring an extra pair, just to be safe!\n\nMy only dislike about Sacks is that is can get pretty loud at lunch.  It's usually crowded between 12-12:30 so I try to go early or after 1 pm.  And don't forget, you can always call ahead and take it to go!", "business_id": "S8R5c7-plWe3NtmijYAJvg", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-07-08", "type": "review"}

Wings were really good and service was very friendly and attentive. I would go back to try the thin crust and some of their specialty pizzas.", "business_id": "GvwDppcJLm9lso9iS2hSIw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-08-20", "type": "review"}

Based on it's location, it seemed like it might be less pretentious than some of it's other centrally-located peers.  After several visits, I am glad to give it five stars for being one of my favorite coffee shops in the Phoenix area.\n\nOn my first visit here, I immediately noticed two things: 1) the roasting equipment and raw beans displayed prominently, indicating that they did indeed roast their own beans and 2) the prices, which are lower than the average coffee shop (I'm thinking Starbucks, which came to prominence with a reputation for high prices but has really fallen into the middle of the pack compared with the better local places that have cropped up) and far lower than most gourmet shops.  True, you're not getting a pour over for each cup, but you know that it was freshly roasted (and ground) and it's less than $2 a cup.  The beans are the real deal, though: $10.95/lb for freshly roasted, delicious coffee beans?  I know some good places for coffee but none of them can even touch that price, most hovering closer to $15/16 per lb.\n\nAlthough I usually go for regular coffee when exploring a new place, I decided to get a latte on that first trip visit, which did not disappoint - good smooth espresso flavor and the right ratio of milk for me.  The next time that I stopped in, I asked a few questions about the beans and bought a cup of coffee.  After some debate, I went with their Bold roast, which I later found out is also their espresso roast.  While it makes for a good espresso, I found it fairly light for a \"bold\" cup of coffee, and after adding just a splash of cream it tasted somewhat watered down.  In the future I'd probably go with one of their other roasts, particularly the Double French.  This is a mix between their dark Sumatra roast and Tanzanian peaberry.  I was a little concerned when I purchased it, as the barista told me to \"wait for the oils to come out on the beans.\" Though I don't know a ton about coffee, one of the things I thought I knew was that oily beans = ruined beans, but after making it at home on a French press, it quickly entered my upper echelon of coffees.  I also picked up some single source Guatemalan while I was there, a brighter and somewhat less flavorful roast, but still excellent.\n\nCompared to many of the other places in town, this place is perhaps a bit dumpy, but it's got good character and the baristas are super friendly and helpful.  They display art in the store and even have a special night for it each month (Second Saturdays?)  It's also very quiet and has outdoor tables, so I could imagine getting some work done there unlike more popular and louder shops.  I'll definitely be getting beans and drinks from this place in the future.", "business_id": "4eFIVmbeCvJGCrhzmd-VYA", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-08-02", "type": "review"}

Dive bar and diner feel in a coffee shop.\n\nThe woman working the register was very sweet and knowledgable about the coffee beans. She answered all and any questions I had and also asked me how much almond milk I'd like in my coffee which is surprising because I've noticed a lot of coffee shops in the valley just add what they think is best. I chose the coffee of the day which was their Heavenly Roast and it is very smooth and fresh. \n\nI live about 15 minutes away from here but I doubt this will be my last stop in!", "business_id": "4eFIVmbeCvJGCrhzmd-VYA", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-07-02", "type": "review"}

There was no sign of food on the main menu, and when I asked if they had any, the guy at the register pointed to a stack of papers. I looked and saw they were a circle-what-you-want type thing, so I did that. Then he proceeded to tell me they were out of turkey as well as pepperjack. Ok, sub ham for turkey and jack for pepperjack. Then he tells me they're out of iced coffee....now sure how, but fine...I picked something else. As my credit card was running he made an exasperated noise and told me they were out of pretzel buns too. Honestly, I was at my wits end at this point, but since my card already run and I was starving, I just rolled with it and told him to put it on sourdough. The other guy behind the counter was apologetic, saying they get their shipments on Mondays and that was why they were out of so many things. \n\nI had asked the guy who rang me up for the wifi password and I sat down and attempted to connect to the wifi. There was no network with their name, so I chose the strongest signal, but it wasn't theirs. When the guy who took my order brought out my sandwich I asked which network it was. He told me (and it was not anything obvious) with a tone like I was a total moron and I was putting him out for asking. Then, at 1:30 he walked up to me and said \"I just wanted to tell you that we close at 2:00 sharp.\" I could already tell because they were bringing in the outside furniture, plus I had checked with the nicer of the two employees not two minutes before that, but thank you for the rude reminder.\n\nIt's really a shame that I had such an awful experience, because I'm signing a lease at a place really close to here. I'd love to have a local coffee shop I feel comfortable stopping by or working in, but this one certainly isn't it.", "business_id": "4eFIVmbeCvJGCrhzmd-VYA", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-07-12", "type": "review"}

And, while I find Nick S.'s opinions undeservedly harsh, they do contain kernels of truth that shouldn't be entirely dismissed either.\n   Regarding cleanliness: I contend that Tony's operates on the \"European Standard\". So ,if you've ever been, you know. If your home has anti-bacterial soap pumps at every sink, you carry antiseptic wipes in your purse or on your person at all times, and you fixate on the illusion of a 100% microbe-free world, you may want to \"pass\" on visiting Tony's. I'd assume then, that you would also avoid any contact with street vendors and food stalls in places like Mexico, Madrid, Bangkok, Hong Kong, et al? Yeah, we're all free to set limits on our individual tolerances, but at what cost to the fullest enjoyment of all that our one, single, lifetime has to offer? Scorpions on a stick, anyone? Perhaps a chilled brewski for starters. Do you do calamari, or not?\n   If you're of the more adventurous sort, at least poke your nose into Tony's for the cultural experience. I consider this place a bona-fide living history museum, with a least three generations of family in evidence, and at your service. Want the lights on in the grocery? Ask. Have a question about ANYTHING? Ditto.\n   Also, take time to see the mementos, memorabilia, kitsch, and exotic products liberally displayed on,behind ,and above the counter and entry. Yeah, there IS dust, but for me that doesn't diminish the faded, festive charm in the least. Nor does it alter the palpable sense of eras past, and present, that this place evokes in me. See the vintage ('50's?) black and white photo of Elvis w/some past friend or relation. Or, more currently, the color shot of, and shout out from, the entire Orangewood Cheer Squad of '09.\n   I admit that not everything at Tony's is superfine, or to everyone's particular taste. I don't especially care for the coarse grind of their sausage, for example, but the sliced meats and cheeses are very good, and well priced. I WOULD recommend checking expire dates on groceries, since the turnover on these items is unknown. I've found outdated items at AJ's, Fry's, and  almost everywhere else.  It happens.\n   If you're up for a purchase, let you senses (and common sense) be your guide. I \"second\" the votes for the subs, and the standard size, traditional cannoli @$2.15 is a bargain. (compared to $7 at Aiello's restaurant on Central, which I haven't tried.)\n   Another bargain here is the bulk olives. While I'm not a big fan of green or kalamata types by themselves, a good tapenade is always welcome. With jumbo plain greens @$3.50lb., and Greeks priced at the upper end of $5.49lb., you can pay $11 and up for the same thing elsewhere. Let the Snoot in you decide.\n\n   To wrap, YOU NEED TO KNOW about their SICILIAN olives.\nThey're black. They're ripe. They're wrinkled, and dry-cured, and shiny. They're salty,(very) not sour. They're earthy, deeply rich, and complex. They're meaty, satisfying, and delicious. They're addicting. They're sprinkled with fennel seed, red pepper flakes, and (on a good day) bits of fresh garlic. They conjure Mediterranean breezes, raven-haired maidens in aprons, and hillsides with goats. They're seaspray and sunshine; they're sublime. And they're $4.49. Match with a favorite wine, a crusty loaf, a chunk of cheese, and you're home.. Where the heart is... OR, you can eat them like candy. Try at least ONE in your lifetime.\n   Sadly, Tony's skips the minced garlic more often than not. If your purchase comes without, I strongly encourage you to add your own at home. Makes a world of difference.", "business_id": "unPzS1QJJctlZyLGFSk_HA", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-06-06", "type": "review"}

The place is nothing to write home about. It is located in a strip center with little ambiance. \n\nThat said, the pizza (whiteout) and the bread sticks that we ordered were very good. The pizza was a generously topped olive oil, basil, garlic, tomatoes, romano, mozzarella, and ricotta. The crust was toward the thin side, but crisp and good. \n\nThe bread sticks were definitely covered with olive oil and cheese.

I had to call back two days later, and finally talked to him. He then stated he would return the money for me as I deserved, because I only purchased one pizza. At the time I was understanding, but now two weeks later and still no refund. Then to find out he's been on vacation so that must mean he forgot.. I basically said I would stop by in person tomorrow and expect my refund in person. Not only have I had to deal with awful customer service, but I must say the pizza was not even good.

I was impressed with the online ordering as it was easy to order and allowed me to choose the time I wanted to take delivery of dinner.  It was 3 pm at the time of my order and I specified 5 pm for the delivery.  This would give them plenty of time to plan to get my order on time.  At 5:35 there was a knock at the door and it was the Stumpys delivery guy.  He handed us a few bags and brought out a pizza.  We ordered two large pizzas (a black olive and a ham and pineapple) and an order of 12 breadsticks.  We were given one ham and pineapple pizza, a salad and medium chicken wings.  I told the delivery guy that we had another pizza coming and we didn't order a salad or wings.  He said that he would be right back and left.  He was nice and apologized.  I think that he was new and just trying to figure things out.  I called the store and let them know.  They apologized and said that they would send out a whole new order and pick up what they dropped off.  I told them that wasn't necessary.  I just wanted my black olive pizza and breadsticks.  Frankly, the wings were stinking up the room and I wanted them gone but the kids were excited to get an unexpected treat.  The delivery guy came back with the black olive pizza and breadsticks.  All this by 4:55 pm.  So, they were still on time and the pizza and breadsticks were awesome!

The meat was sliced thin and heated up.  It had a mustard on it that was ok, but I typically eat my sandwiches dry.  The bread was delicious!

I ordered a pumpkin pie and an apple cranberry pie.  We had family in from North Carolina and enjoyed a loverly dinner.  Then disaster struck.  I bit into my apple cranberry piece of pie and THERE WAS CHOCOLATE IN IT!!!  A whole layer of chocolate under the apple and cranberry.  I couldn't believe it and I was so embarrassed.  It tasted horrible.  The pumpkin pie was crappy too!!!    \n\nTo make matters worse I tried numerous times to contact the owner for a refund by phone and through their website and heard nothing then finally sent her a message through facebook!!   I heard back from her and she admitted to me they rarely check their email off the website - thats good business sense!. She asked me for my address to send the check to and gave it to her.  A couple weeks went by, received nothing so  I emailed my address again.  \n\nTo this day (June 14th) I still have not received a refund!!!  We used to lunch there once in a while but now WE WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN!!!  And this year I will make my own pies!!!

Seems like the perfect place to meet for a quick breakfast or lunch.  Last Sunday I ended up there when looking for a breakfast for my daughter, Sammy. See all my talk about junk food has come to fruition and she won't grab a quick bite at Mc D's or Burger King...which is exactly what I want, for her to be discerning ... but  you get the idea. Now I have to find better more expensive choices/healthier foods , oh well she is worth it. \nThis little bakery has a tidy selection of  muffins and scones fresh and the place smelled nice.  Daughter had a Morning Muffin , which I would call a Morning Glory Muffin , it had a spicier taste but not nutmeg or cinnamon , Sammy wasn't thrilled . I thought it smelled good. I had a berry scone which tasted really good.  I would go back for one if I was in the neighborhood.  \nOne down side was the counter service, the gal was doing her best , but one person taking orders getting drinks, bakery goods, and refilling teas and coffee seemed a bit much . While there we saw a constant line of  people and the poor girl couldn't get caught up , she would have to stop and refill tea machines  and that meant people waiting.  I felt bad for her. \nOne side note they had a nice selection of pre-made  food  like fresh cut up fruit , veggies and chicken breast that looked good for fast eating on the run.", "business_id": "j5HLcBru7FEirYJPbKFVWA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-07-12", "type": "review"}

I guess we got here before the lunch rush because it was dead when we got there but the small place started to fill up pretty fast.  There are under 10 small tables in the place so if you are dining in get here as early as you can.\n\nI know they can't help it but the place is pretty small, hot and cramped when it gets crowded.  I also don't like it that you have to ask for a soda refill and can't just get it yourself.  I do understand though that space is an issue here and it isn't a full service restaurant so it is what it is.  All the workers are very very friendly and helpful however.\n\nFor my sandwich I chose the Turkey Jack Stack.  I loved the sourdough bread but the actual sandwich was just standard.  It was of a decent size and had plenty of fresh ingredients, but the flavor was just eh.  Not really worth $7.50.\n\nThe cole slaw is pretty good as it was not overly creamy.  It was perfect for a hot summer day and was quite refreshing...or as refreshing as cole slaw can be.  \n\nThe cookies are also very good and fresh.  There is an awesome chocolate one where they put in crasins which is a welcome touch and adds a sweet-tartness to the cookie.
