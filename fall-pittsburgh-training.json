For review #100, a 5 star review for a 5 star restaurant is definitely fitting.\n\nCasbah does brunch, lunch and dinner, but brunch is my favorite meal and also what they do best.  I ordered their prixe fixe brunch option which is a choice of an appetizer, brunch dish, and drink for $22.  I started off with smoked salmon and had the waitress recommended braised lamb and eggs as an entree and a mimosa to drink.  My companion ordered butternut squash & apple cider soup, wild mushroom omelet, and a glass of fresh orange juice.\n\nWhile waiting for our food, we munched on their complimentary pastry basket consisting of super moist mini-muffins, scones, and super rich and buttery biscuits with honey butter.\n\nThe smoked salmon came with capers, minced red onion, crumbled egg, a drizzle of aioli, and a beautiful fried potato cake.  There was just the perfect amount of everything on the dish; the potato cake was just big enough to balance out the saltiness of the smoked salmon and the capers of course paired beautifully with the smoked salmon.  I tried some of the butternut squash & apple cider soup and it had some a pretty complex flavor.\n\nMy entree reminded me of an eggs benedict with a twist: grilled  sourdough topped with spinach, braised lamb shoulder and two poached eggs.  I love braised meats because braising can do such wonders to tougher cuts.  The braised lamb shoulder was flavorful, tender, and super rich.  The best part about poached eggs is sopping up the extra yolk with bread and it just tasted better with the sauce of the lamb soaking into the sourdough to soften it up a bit.  This dish itself is enough to make me a regular.  I tried my companion's home fries which came with this slightly spicy ketchup (I think it's house-made) and also a piece of her omelet which was pretty good too.\n\nService was good, ambiance was good, portions were big, quality was excellent, AND they take reservations.  Sometimes I don't mind waiting the half hour it takes to get seats at some restaurants (Point Brugge, Coca Cafe, etc.), but most times I'd rather spend time with people in the restaurant at a table rather than waiting outside, especially now with winter approaching.", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-11-01", "type": "review"}

I'd love to know where they get it from as I can't imagine they bake it there, but maybe they do! \n\nThe pork chop is their signature dish and does not disappoint. My husband had the duck the last time we were there and it was juicy on the inside and had a great crispy skin. I had the red pepper casereccia and was thrilled with the amount of seafood in the dish. There were 4 HUGE, delicious scallops and a ton of lump crab. Very impressive.

It had lots of sauerkraut, Swiss cheese, and sauce with the meat piled high. It is one of the best Reubens I have ever had. The chips were thinly sliced and very crispy. There was no need for a dipping sauce, the chips were very good just plain. They had 3 or 4 desserts that looked good but I chose the German Chocolate cake. It's one of my very favorite desserts. There were 3 layers of chocolate cake. In between the layers of cake there is coconut, chocolate, and pecans. The outside of the cake is frosted with a chocolate whipped frosting. It was really good.

The bartender was very nice, introduced herself and wanted to get to know me. \n\nThis seems like a mostly locals only bar, but they are very happy when people from outside the neighborhood stop in. One thing I heard several times while I was in there was \"Troy Hill is getting better, more people should come here and find out.\"\n\nI tried the soup of the day, chicken and corn chowder, and an order of their wings, $.60 during the Steelers games. Both were very good and made me want to come back to try more of the menu. The beer selection is a bit limited, they mostly stick with the big name domestics, but that being said, the beer is pretty darn cheap.

The kid at the counter was nice enough, so service was not an issue. The atmosphere inside pretty much sucks though...and you have to work pretty hard to make a cute little neighborhood coffee shop have zero atmosphere. \n\nThe first thing you see when you walk in a sign alerting you of the \"RULES\": to not use your cell phone at the counter, and that you must pay for something to sit inside, use the restrooms, or use the WiFi. Now, I understand the sentiment of these rules, they are common sense and fair. But it's a rather negative note to start off your experience being yelled at by a sign assuming you are there to steal their interwebz. It just doesn't feel warm or welcoming somehow. The front counter is poorly organized and rather unattractive. If it ever gets busy in there I'm willing to bet it gets rather chaotic.\n\nI ordered an iced vanilla latte, so I was quite surprised when the kid pulls out a pitcher from the fridge of what I can only guess was refrigerated espresso. That was rather disappointing; there's no reason an iced latte shouldn't be prepared with fresh espresso shots. Not surprisingly, it tasted bitter like...old espresso. Then I finished the drink to find the cup was 90% full of ice. I mean, come on. My lemon almond biscotti was delicious. The rest of the offerings in the pastry case appeared pretty underwhelming though; standard prepackaged muffins and cookies. With the number of excellent bakeries in this area, I don't see why they couldn't partner up with someone to provide some higher quality foods.\n\n\nI think this place could learn a lot from Square Cafe as far as decor and atmosphere go. It needs a little pep, a little warmth, SOMETHING. And they need to learn how to make iced lattes correctly. And they could also use an upgrade on their website...it's pretty amateurish and has a 1992 flair... Basically they just need to show a little effort.\n\nI love to support local businesses, but there should be more of a reason for me to return than the fact that it's the only coffee shop in town.", "business_id": "D9sHwmqlNkrVxmX-057i1g", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-11-19", "type": "review"}

When we visit the area....this place always lacks the experience that we receive from ShadySide, Robinson, and Ross Park. Even though it closer to my Dad's House when visiting...its time for us to part ways. The food and service is never as good at this location. I love, love, love their tofu tacos...but this was just eh this time...it was as though the thick pieces fell apart and they were small and too crunchy and maybe just old...bleh. I couldn't even finish them, even though I cannot wait to eat them the 3 times a year I get to have them.

The comments should be obvious to those with any common sense, but unfortunately, I find myself having to state them anyway. First and foremost, and I feel like i am stating the obvious here, the cinnamon & sugar (c&s) bagels are very sticky, especially on the bottom. With that being said:\n1. Do not store c&s bagels underneath any of the following bagels: onion, poppy seed, sesame seed, everything, or any other bagel that has \"loose parts\". When the loose parts fall off  they stick to the c&s bagel. Biting into a sweet c&s bagel and getting a bite of onion (which I dislike) is AWFUL. \n2. either wipe off the counter or place a new sheet of wax paper on the counter after prepping one of the above mentioned bagels with loose parts. Again, when you place a c&s bagel on top of these loose parts, they stick to the bagel. \n3. when someone orders a tub of cream cheese to go with a c&s, please wrap the bagel. If not wrapped, the container becomes sticky and messy from coming into contact with the bagel.\nI was a \"regular\" at the Market Square location before changing jobs and never had any of the above issues. The C&S bagels were kept on the top shelf and they wiped the counter off after EVERY order.The only good thing I can say about this location is that it has drive through.", "business_id": "uwiD9jxs09xxXG0by_xKuA", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-10-06", "type": "review"}

Tried a different bar in town and was highly disappointed by it so we tried this place and we love it!! The only problem is, they close too early on Sunday, lol. We didn't have the food to eat, but everything they have brought out for other customers looks and smells great! But definitely good drinks, great atmosphere and super friendly staff!! Oh!

Why go to the Olive Garden when Pittsburgh has so many great local Italian places?  Hey, it's convenient and the food is decent.  For lunch, Olive Garden ain't bad in a pinch!   I had business to go to near the airport and I stopped here out of necessity.\n\nI had the basic spaghetti & meatballs in marinara sauce.  Not bad.  I wish they had cups of soup 'cos the Zuppa Toscana was mighty tempting.  \n\nOkay, so I admit I like the Olive Garden.
