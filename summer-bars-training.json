The bartenders are friendly and manage to remember my name and drink choice even though I'm here only a few times a year.  My Friday nights here must have made quite an impression!

The food is very homey and very reasonably priced.  The German nachos are always worth ordering, and they are smothered with Gouda cheese.  The spatzle is also a creamy indulgent treat.

But seriously.  This place has been an institution for my family, and I really love it here.  I feel like this is some of the only German food in Pittsburgh, and I think it represents fairly well.  My thoughts:\n\nBrunch Buffet- I love the Sunday brunch buffet more than life.  Omelette station, German and American breakfast and lunch foods, and lots and lots of beautiful, delicious, and decadent desserts.  It's heaven on Earth.  There is usually a decent selection of meats, and the potato pancakes are almost always featured.  They've changed it a bit over the years, but I still love this buffet.\n\nAppetizers- My family loves the soft pretzels.  They are so yummy and buttery, but a bit heavy if you are going to eat your entire meal.  So make sure to share.\n\nMeals-  I, personally, have never had a bad meal here.  The sauasages of all varieties have been great.  The weinerschnitzel also great.  Sandwiches all good as well.  I really like the cheesy spaetzle dish that is just like macaroni and cheese but with spaetzle noodles!  I don't get too crazy and order anything complicated, though.\n\nSides-  I love love love their sides.  I could live on the spaetzle and potato pancakes.  Don't pass the sides up!\n\nDessert:  Also love their desserts.  There is a chocolate chocolate cake that they heat up with homemade whipped cream that is TO DIE FOR.  Not so shockingly, the apple strudel is wonderful as well.\n\nBesides the food, the servers are always very friendly and efficient.  There is also ample street parking, which is really nice.

Wow, a martini bar not named the Blue Martini?  OK, I'm in!\n\nSo I strolled over and walked in.  First impression was it was a cool, cozy, and trendy joint.  Liked the exposed brick walls, lighting, etc.  Only problem is, I don't go to a restaurant or a bar to eat and drink the atmosphere!\n\nSo I grab a table in the bar.  It was about 5pm and there might have been 15 people in the whole place.  Two bartenders made eye contact with me so I figured they would be waiting on me.  I figured wrong.  I sat there for a good ten minutes and was getting ready to get up and leave when the younger tender came over and said with a \"deer in the headlights look\", do you want a drink or something????  Well hell, what was your first guess?  I refrained from quoting Foxworthy and saying \"here's your sign\"!\n\nSo OK we were off to a bumpy start.  I didn't have a martini, however there was a few options on the drink menu.  I was just here for a bite, so my review is based on that.\n\nA few minutes later the other bartender comes back with my water and gives me a menu.  I ordered some turkey wrap with a fruit salad for a side.  I say \"some\" turkey wrap because it was really that unimpressive!  \n\nIt seemed to take forever for it to arrive.  Given the fact that it wasn't busy, it did take a long time to arrive.  When it did, it looked OK.  The fruit salad looked as if it was ready for the trash, so I bypassed that.  The wrap just had zero flavor and was loaded with lettuce........way to much.  The only flavor that presented itself was blandness!  It was very disappointing.\n\nAll in all, I think this is probably a way better bar to have a drink in then a restaurant.

My one and only issue is that its kind of expensive. Martinis are all about $10, the entrees are all around $30, and unless you're going for happy hour, all appetizers are at least $10. I always start to wonder if it's really worth the cost, but honestly, I think it is.\n\nEvery time I've gone I've shared crab cakes. Before you judge the $27 price tag, just realize that they have the type of crab cakes that are actually made with real crab. These aren't $15 crab cakes that are half bread/filling, they are proper (and very large) crab cakes. This last visit we also split nachos and lobster mac n cheese. I've heard the buffalo chicken dip is good and every dessert I've tried has been great.\n\nIt's also a martini bar so you'd expect them to be great at them, and they are. Last visit I had the chocolate covered pretzel, but other memorable martinis include the birthday cake and strawberry short cake (please don't judge- these were actually enjoyed on my birthday.)

He's exactly the kind of sever I would always want to have: nice, polite, and overall just generally good at his job with the timing of bringing food and checking on the table. \n\nI'd definitely visit Olive or Twist more regularly if they dropped their prices like 25%, but you get what you pay for and I'm willing to occasionally shell out the extra dough for a good meal with awesome service.", "business_id": "OxIeMVcop5oxBUWANi-1Rw", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-07-01", "type": "review"}

Bloody Mary's are half off after 2pm, so I often like to work out in the morning and then spend the afternoon having a \"Sunday Funday.\"\n\nThe food at the Harris is generally good, but they change their menu a lot and while that can be a good thing I've found it frustrating as several of my favorite menu items ie Shawshank Redemption and the Crawful of Falaffel are no longer offered.  The food is somewhat consistent, although sometimes it is over seasoned.  I ordered the meatloaf once and it had so much rosemary in it I found it almost inedible--although my boyfriend tried it and loved it.  The DelMonico A Go Go is so fatty I don't recommend it.  It's a good sandwich, but it owuld be better if they made it with different/better meat.  Several times I've gone to order a menu item and they're out of it.  The staff is usually pretty good about letting you know what's off the menu ahead of time but sometimes you want to ask.\n\nWhat the Harris does well they do fantastic.

The historic and charming homes are such a treat in a city where everything seems brand new. \n\nUpon entering this pub-like restaurant/bar we were seated and greeted promptly. \n\nI ordered a cider on tap (a favorite of mine), a side salad, and the \"What it is\" . The star oddly enough was the salad, she said all their dressings were homemade and it certainly tasted that way.  The \"What it is\" was just ok in my opinion. I have had my share of amazing pasta dishes but never have been much of a rotini fan. The dish has a lot of dried herbs and I just prefer fresh...the chicken seemed almost too rubbed in cajun spice for my taste. That being said, I would like to give it another shot and order something else besides pasta ..I really am a tough critic in the Italian department. \n\nMy biggest gripe of the night was the pace of service. I don't know if the server (or chef) had somewhere to be but she was going a mile a minute. I wanted to relax and enjoy my meal not be rushed in and out in less than 45minutes. My dinner came as half of my salad remained uneaten...and the salad was literally brought out in less than a minute after I ordered it.

When my burger came out, it was not a portabello mushroom patty, but instead, a pile of sliced mushrooms on the bun. I asked the server, why it was not a portabello patty, and the server told me it was because they had run out of portabello patties, and this was what they were using instead. Interesting. I told him I didn't want this, and wanted something else. He obliged, took my plate of sliced mushrooms, and went to place my new order. I called the manager over, to let them know the situation. When I explained my side of the story, he rebutted with something \"Well the server told you we were out of portabello mushroom patties, and said you agreed to sliced mushrooms\". WHAT?! I told him, no, that was incorrect, and that I was unware of them being out of portabello patties until I was brought a plate of sliced mushrooms on a bun; my wife agreed. The manager stood by his server. I firmly told him again, that I did not know/agree to having a sliced mushroom sandwich, and that the server conveyed no such message of running out of portabellow patties. I asked him how he could rectify the situation - free meal or something? No he would not, because I was aware of the situation (but I wasn't!), although he did comp me the original portabello mushroom burger...gee thanks.\n\nNow I'm not the type of guy who tries to find fault at every little thing to get a free meal. But come on. I would assume, after having worked in the restaurant industry for several years, that the manager, regardless of how much/little he believed the customer (me) would side w/ me, or at least try to rectify the sitatuion for future business.

I had the chicken breast that  once i got to the bone it blood and under cook.  and to finish the even off they were out of the cheesecake, and some of the guest  got the flourless coco cake which had molded rasphberry on her plate. yikes . it almost went in her mouth.

They had Coronas for $2.50, so that was definitely refreshing. The employees/bouncers/bartenders (male) were all meatheads though...not trying to hate or anything.

The live band that they had was very good, playing the usual popular classics (3am, Sweet Home Alabama, Play That Funky Music, Don't Stop Believing, etc). I think what impressed me the most this night was the upgrade in the music selection. They went way beyond the typical top 40 that they usually play when the live band isn't performing. The DJ kinda sucked though....he was mixing in other songs halfway through songs that just didn't blend in well, and he played some songs twice within a 30 minute time frame. There was some really good hip hop (some old Snoop, Luniz, etc) being played that night. I'm really hoping it's like that from here on out b/c although I believe I could dance to any genre of music (tooting my horn a little), dancing to hip hop is a lot more easier, haha.

The bread, if you are a Costco person, is one of their torta rolls that are deee-licious.  The sandwich was good, and I like that it was served warm, but it needed a little more flavor to it.  Maybe next time I will ask for a side of BBQ sauce or the like to punch it up a bit.  The house made chips were thick sliced potato chips, crispy, but not hard and served with a slightly spicy dipping sauce - they were good and not overly salty, which was perfect.  \nKey Lime Cheesecake ($6.95):  This tasted like another Queen City Pastry dessert and was delicious.  Served with several swirls of whipped cream, this light key lime cheesecake, on a graham cracker crust, with a thin layer of lime sauce on top, was the perfect somewhat light dessert the finish the meal.  \n\nExcellent service and the food was slightly above average for this type of restaurant.

I had to ASK about the Bloody Mary Bar to which she replied - \"oh yeah it's in the back there\" - this server was NOT really hawking the attributes of the restaurant like one would expect - even when we mentioned it was our first time for the Breakfast buffet. It's an eclectic place, and the food is typically good for the most part - but the same old thing menu. Ribs are good and as I mentioned earlier the prime rib is excellent... but that's probably all we will get there from now on, if we return at all. This could be a weekly haunt for us, but it's only become essentially a once a month thing - and now DEFINITELY not for the breakfast \"buffet\" - I do a better spread at home!", "business_id": "Zc2IwSzGY63zkyhfNrr7HA", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-08-10", "type": "review"}

Brats, right? Of course! What? No? It's just me?

Enter Harmony, the harbinger of good things to come. I'm not one who enjoys going out alone, especially to bars, but that's something I'm trying to get over. So it was a relief to see the place only half filled with low key, relaxed people who barely noticed I was there. I was however, immediately noticed by the friendly, smiling young bartender (who looked all of fourteen), so I was put further at ease. Also delightful was a live band playing happy zydeco music in the other room, a genre which I adore. I sat at the bar and ordered my 'beer brat'. With sauerkraut, it's only $5.25. Win! They also had a fairly good selection of craft brews on tap, and mine was cold and delicious. Brat, beer and fries for $12.\n\nThe brat is pre-cooked and then browned in the tiny kitchen just off the bar, and it's always fun to watch food being made (if you're me). They also grill the kraut, a nice touch. It's served on a big, somewhat fluffy sesame seed bun, which seemed like an odd choice, but it worked. The fries are good, too, and the order is huge. I would have sprung for the deservedly popular pub chips and bleu cheese dip, but they were twice the price of the fries. It was a lot of food, and totally satisfying, and I finished every last bite. I think this is a place I can feel comfortable going to alone or with others in the future, and I plan to, often. :-)\n\nNote: cash only.\nFive stars instead of four if only they had a fire grill and not just a flat grill.", "business_id": "KHOHjA8HOcTlFBCtMQFv8A", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-06-22", "type": "review"}

In a foodie way, too.\n\nMy boyfriend and I came here on a hot humid Thursday night. The lightings were great to bring a date or to catch up with a friend and there were fairly good amount of room noise to keep your conversation on the privacy level. The service was just lovely. Oh, the little \"Gum\" note-card was utterly cute. You can either spit your gum on the note-card or exchange phone numbers. :)\n\nThe first time I visited Postino, I wanted to come back for more of their bruschettas. My boyfriend and I shared the various bruschetta platter: \n1. Brie & Apples with Fig Spread - He quickly picked this because the first time he had it became his favorite and was confident that I would absolutely love it, and I did -- I loved the sweet taste of the fig with the crunchiness of the apples. yummm! The composition of the brie, apples and fig gives this bruschetta a sweet taste.\n2. Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato & Basil - Since we had 3 more bruschetta options to pick, we went for something light and simple. Everything was fresh! The combination of the mozzarella, tomato and basil was simple yet blended wonderfully together. \n3. Smoked Salmon with Pesto - This was probably my least favorite out of the four, but it was okay. Although the capers were mouth bursting with favors -- which was delish, but it didn't do much justice for the slight fishy taste of the smoked salmon.\n4. Ricotta with Dates and Pistachios - By the end of the night, he declared that this became our favorite bruschetta, evar! I think they toasted the dates a bit or something of that sort, but it was perfect. The pistachios weren't dry and the ricotta wasn't an overload. All three components made it tasted like sweet heaven in your mouth. When I think of bruschetta, I immediately think savory, but there's nothing wrong with a dessert bruschetta, right? I think not. The texture of this was just perfect. No complaints here!\n\nHe and I tend to order enough to feed 4 hungry men when we dine out. So we also called for the Panini -- the Vegetarian Panini on ciabatta to be exact. We had the side salad with crumb goat cheese. Meh, I didn't care much for this panini, maybe because I was already full off of the tasty bruschettas!\n\n\nThere's a $3 charge for Valet.

Prior to this celebration period the wings were a reasonable medium size. After the celebration period and when they increased the price, the wings were very small. I even joked to my waitress that it must have been difficult to find all of these pigeon legs. On one occasion I had a wing that was only a small piece of meat. Our group of Tuesday night eaters have since quit going to Native wings because of this change. Their other menu items are good, but , when you bill yourself as a Wing House they need to be the best item on the menu.

Right off the bat you can tell this is not a new Native or a very nice one but we wanted to eat. First noticeable thing was the smell. I am actually not sure how to explain it but it sort of smelled like cat urine when you walked in the front door. The entrance is not very welcoming at all, and sort of leads you down a hallway where they seat you. We were seated at a stand alone table, preffered a booth but you can't always get what you want. It was just a wide open room with tables, a bunch of TV's. Waitress came out and took order. It became obvious this was not a traditional Native Ny'er but was previously called something else and was in the process of being changed over. I think they were struggling with an identity crisis as this place is simply not up to par with most natives we have been too ( like the one on Gilbert and Germann) and even the one in Dobson Ranch is nicer than this one. We ordered wings for the kids and us adults all got fish n chips. wings came out and could not believe how small they were. I will call them micro wings. Service was slow. The Fish and Chips actually took 20 or 25 minutes. I expressed a bit of concern with the server on how long food was taking. It was finally delivered. Fries were a little soggy but fish good.
