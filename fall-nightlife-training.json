But I feel positively enough about my first meal there, that taking off a whole star seems harsh.  \n\nI got a free entree coupon for my birthday, for signing up for Big Burrito's mailing list, and decided to revisit Casbah.  The good: we got to enjoy the patio even though the weather was a little cool because it was heated.  My maccheretto, a pasta entree with white beans, sun-dried tomato, pesto and walnuts, was very good.  The pasta was al dente and the white beans were perfectly cooked (not mushy).  It was maybe a touch too salty (the fontina, maybe?), but I was happy with the choice.  \n\nNow, onto the weird.  After taking our orders, our waiter asked if we wanted bread with our big-calorie pasta dishes.  Checking if we want bread is fine--but, umm, he could have left out the comment about the pasta?  My friend and I are both twentysomething women.  Luckily, we're not that insecure about our bodies.  We like to eat.  Yes, bring the bread.\n\nWhen he brought our entrees, he sang \"Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you\" under his breath as he put my pasta in front of me.  I don't like people singing to me at restaurants, so I'm grateful it wasn't audible to everyone else on the patio--but a simple \"Happy birthday\" would have sufficed.  Then when he cleared our plates, he asked if my dish was \"everything [I] wanted, and more.\"  I appreciate the gestures, but it felt artificial.\n\nHe asked if we'd like to see the dessert menu--and added that he was supposed to ask that, that we shouldn't feel obligated.  Uh, what?  I think this and the bread/pasta comment bothered me the most.  \n\nTo redeem the birthday coupon, you have to show an ID.  I recently cut my hair, so it's different than my license photo.  When he returned my ID to me, our waiter said, \"I like the short hair.\"  If this had been the only unusual statement he had made during the meal, I would have taken it as a compliment.  I guess it is one.  But when considered with all the other weird things, it just felt like he was trying way too hard and my friend and I both felt awkward.\n\nThe food here is good and I feel that the service this time was unusual, and the more professional service I had on my first visit here is closer to the norm.

My friend and I had just finished crawling the art galleries downtown, and were in the mood for some libations and grub.\n\nWe started off with some drinks.  Upon opening the drink menu, I was struck by its length and breadth.  I was initially tempted by the lavender-lemon concoction, but ultimately decided to go with a white Russian, since I'd never had one before and my lab manager had talked them up, and I enjoy my drinks sweeter as the night goes on.  It was a nice little drink--very smooth and strong, and I enjoyed the blending of the vanilla and coffee liqueur.  The best part, however, was the graham cracker crumbs on the rim!  My friend went with the painkiller, a favorite of his.  I had a sip, and it was also quite good, even though it involved coconut and I'm not usually much of a fan of coconut flavor.  Later on, he also ordered a beer (forget which kind) and a shot of yellow cake (he explained that this is a tradition because [insert backstory involving hung-over friends here]), whereas the white Russian was sufficient to quench my alcoholic thirst for the evening (I'm a lightweight when it comes to drinking).\n\nIn terms of food, we ordered the large plain macaroni and cheese.  (He doesn't eat much seafood, and I don't eat beef, which precluded all of the other options.)  Given that I'm a mac and cheese connoisseur, and that another friend recommended the mac here, I was excited to try it.  When it came out, it looked quite attractive, with interesting noodles and a sprinkling of bread crumbs on top (I'm a fan of bread crumbs on my mac).  While the flavor of the cheese was pleasant, the cheese:noodle ratio was way too low, to the point that I ended up scraping the plate to get enough of it to cover my noodles. This should never happen with a quality mac and cheese!  Even my friend, who'd had the side dish mac and cheese before, said he thought the cheese was lacking in quantity.\n\nBecause there wasn't any seating available on the patio, we were seated inside the door to the left, against the wall between the hallway and the bar.  The lighting was pretty dim, which made it a bit hard to see.  The atmosphere was definitely casual, and service was acceptable (though perhaps could have been a bit more attentive).  For the items listed above, we spent $50 + tip, which seems a bit steep.  If I were to return, I'd try to come during happy hour, since they have some nice deals on drinks and food.  3.5 stars.\n\nEDIT: I think the lack of cheesiness in the mac and cheese that I received was a fluke, based on reports from friends and the owner's comment (see below).

After seeing the pictures of a variety of mac and cheese options, I knew I needed to test out Harris Grill.\n\nI came in with two friends a few days ago.  My friend and I split the \"I Can Has Bacon Cheezeburger\" and an order of Mac and Cheese.  The total for this was about $12.50 with tax each. The burger was good but not special.  There was more bacon on the burger than most places, but it was not the star of the meal.  The mac and cheese, however, was fantastic.  The portion was quite large, and our awesome waiter brought us some Sriracha, which was a great addition!  There was lots of rich cheese sauce, which was extra yummy on our french fries.  This is one of the top mac and cheeses I have had in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe place is a bit dark, and even on a Wednesday night, most people were already toasted at 6 PM.

This is one of the best bars in the city. Their drinks are remarkably strong, easily on par with Lefty's in the Strip. As a matter of fact, I really don't recommend having more than four or five Mardi Gras cocktails. They will kick your ass.\n\nThis is one of the only bars in the city where I will walk in and just tell the bartender to make whatever whiskey drink he feels like making. I realize this might not sound like a big deal, but I have serious trust issues when it comes to bars. There are only about twenty six bars worldwide where I will even consider ordering  a Manhattan or a Martini. \n\nOne of the best kept Le Mardi Gras secrets is that on Sunday they offer free food to their patrons. Even though we visited on a Thursday, the owner, Rich, was kind enough to put some food out for us. These little touches are what make Mardi Gras more than just a bar.\n\nHere are some of my favorite Le Mardi Gras features: smoking, table top pacman, excellent juke box, fantastic bartenders, intimate seating, dark ominous ambiance and lively patrons. According to Le Mardi Gras' website they've also hosted a variety of celebrities including Rocky Marciano, Harvey Kietel, Sammy Koufax, Sam McDowell, Billy Conn, Alice Cooper, George Clooney, Russell Crowe and Ted Danson.", "business_id": "TIPebazlAGJsp8zAwhNkcw", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-10-25", "type": "review"}

Another review, and this time from the well known Rock Bottom in downtown Charlotte. I came here with a friend who wanted some of their beer as well as their food. And sadly, I wasn't impressed. Inside though they completely changed the outlay of the dining area from the last time I came here, which was about 2 years ago... They added ramps as well as new things to look at and admire, such as the glass between booths and some paintings. But, overall it's all the same with the looks and what not.\n\nI had two things from the menu: Fish Tacos (RB Taco) and the Southwestern Chili.\n\nNow, the good first. Southwestern Chili. It was awesome, I felt like it was very good and chunky. However, I wish the portion was just a wee bit bigger just because it was so tasty!\n\nAnother plus was the service. My friend ordered a steak and it was a little overcooked, the waiter completely understood and took it back to get another steak cooked medium rare. It was fast and I believe even the manager came up to fix the problem. They offered a soup or whatever, but my friend declined (I was wondering why he didn't get me another chili!)\n\nNow the bad. Eating the Fish Tacos was like grabbing a handful of seasoned salt and then eating it. Every single bite was just a burst of not just salt, but just sodium with a little heat kicked in, but that was probably from the amount of salt and it made it seem spicier. After drinking water, it was still stuck in my mouth. Kick back the salt Rock Bottom and pull out that flavor of the fish! After all, it is a fish taco.\n\nOverall, not bad, food is average.

I try to give restaurants the benefit of the doubt when they fall short, understanding that things happen sometimes outside of their control. That said, Cajun Queen has continually failed to provide a satisfactory dining experience for us on 3 consecutive visits. The food alone would earn 4 stars for the advertised menu prices - although they do offer special discount deals fairly often. The customer service however is consistently dissapointing, to the point where I am convinced that the management staff needs to be changed. The attitude toward customers is not one of \"How can I help make your experience better?\" it instead seems to me that all of the workers are more into talking to eachother while dropping items at tables without saying a word. This is not just one bad egg, it seems to be everyone from the water boy to the manager. A friendly restaurant employee is the exception to the rule at Cajun Queen. In my opinion the lack of customer service ability is a direct result of the management failing to instill those abilities in their employees. \n\nIf you get seated at the two person table in a hallway between the kitchen and 2 dining rooms just ask to be moved. That table is terrible and does not belong in any restaurant that has any respect for its customers. And that's just it, there seems to be a lack of respect amongst the staff for their customers here. The hostess at the door stares at her computer while talking to you without ever making eye contact, the bread boy just drops the bread at your table without a word. Water boy, same thing. Server doesn't exchange pleasantries, just straight to drinks and apps. Manager walks by and talks to his buddy about the game but doesn't acknowledge the guest at the table as his conversation is overpowering ours. Workers come barelling through with a table they are moving without saying 'pardon me' or anything at all. On the way out the door the manager guy just stands there staring at the hostess' computer screen without so much as saying thanks have a good night...\n\nWe have kept returning to Cajun Queen always hoping our next experience would prove to be better, but sadly I think we have now given up.

My 2 rating is due to the following reasons 1) my husband and I went to watch NFL kickoff last Sunday.  Ordered our beer and then attempted to order our food.  I said attempt because they didn't have much to offer.  Every time we made a selection it was either 86 or a component was 86. The explaination we were given was it was very busy Friday night and ran out of stuff - hello it is now Sunday afternoon. You are advertising watching the games at your location.  I pointed out that there is a grocery store within walking distance.  The reply was the owners won't let us buy anything.  I ordered shepards pie which is supposed to be a meat potato and veggie dish. When it showed up at the table it had at least 1/2inch of melted cheese on top a fact not mentioned in the description. After scraping that off I proceeded to dig in. Unfortunately the dish was made with less than an ounce of meat alittle bit of peas and corn and a pile of potatoes. I had the honor of paying $10 for that.  2) OK everyone can have a bad day so we returned this Sunday.  Once again they were out of things but not as bad as last week.  I ordered a specialty burger for $11 Safe right?  Wrong. It came out as any basic burger would except for the fact that the actual patty looked liked someone took a bite out of it.  I called the server over to show her the burger and to ask where the special burger was - her reply - it looks like someone bit into it.  When I asked about the bun vs bagel - oh we don't have those anymore!  There is much more that I can say but this is already a novel. Long story short. The food sucks and we will not return.  One other thing when I told our server about our experience last week she stated that she served an English guy that complained that the shepards pie was the worse he ever ate - I agree.

We've eaten at this particular Olive Garden in Madison many, many times. It has usually been very good: a relaxing meal, served well, the food pretty consistently good.....UNTIL!! We were there yesterday after dropping our kid off at UW and moving all the stuff into the dinky student apartment. We were tired and somewhat sad and looking forward to a nice dinner. It didn't start well. Our waiter was a strangely aloof, indifferent guy who seemed to deign to wait on us when he had a moment. Plus, horror of horrors, there are now those little 'ziosk' thingies on each table, just like in a sports bar. We hate those things and so moved it to face the wall. However, when Aloof Guy came to take our order for an appetizer, he pointedly reached across me to get the apparatus and clicked in our app order. In other places where they have these dumb things, using them is optional. Salad and breadsticks came as usual. For my entree I ordered fish and shrimp in 'light wine sauce'. Our entrees came very quickly, we were not done with salads yet, but Aloof Guy didn't care. He just crowded the plates onto the table while we scrambled to make room. When I saw my fish I was immediately wary. The sauce looked like something you'd find at a cheap hotel buffet or a highschool cafeteria. I tasted it, and yup, tasted just like it looked. Very, very salty and with a strange, sourish taste to it. Plus the 'seasoned' broccoli was dry, practically raw and inedible. I politely and apologetically told Aloof Guy that I couldn't eat it and asked for the portobella ravioli, which I've had numerous times before. It's very rich, which is why I didn't order it in the first place. AG said he'd inform the manager and put in my order and then left, leaving the unappetizing plate of fish in yuck sauce in front of me. It took quite a while for him to realize that he'd left it there. Finally he came and got it and finally removed the empty plates from the appetizer and salads. The manager came by and asked about the problem with the fish. When I explained, she as much as told me I was mistaken, as that was her 'favorite'. She just loved that salty sauce! The ravioli finally came and - ah well - not in the sauce they sauce they usually were in - this was thin and broken ( showing the fat separated out). By this time I had given up. I'm assuming that this was just a bad day for the cook, but the aloof and uncaring waiter was a bit much. Also, when we were ready to pay, sure enough, he grabbed the ziosk thing again. I said, are you going to make us use that to pay? and he just firmly said, yes ma'am and left. It was a pain to figure out. So much for the relaxing dinner after a trying day.

Additionally, I've seen a guy literally fall backwards off a bar stool, a couple really close to having public sex, and not to mention countless airborne beverages that have partially landed on or close to me. Yup, it's that kind of place.\n\nThe bar service here seems to be a little quicker than most of the other bars, but still doesn't appear to be really that great, in my opinion. Half the time the bartender can't even hear me, and I always seem to keep getting pushed back in the queue of people to be served, which is aggravating. Even when you do get served, it appears everything is really expensive. $3.50 for a bottle of Miller Lite? Meh.... \n\nThe inside bouncers/barbacks usually aren't too bothersome. Although on one occasion they were checking for wristbands like Nazis every 5-10 minutes for anyone who had a drink in their hand. It was annoying, excessive and I wish I knew why, perhaps an incident occurred earlier? I really don't know.\n\nThe outside bouncers/door guys are even more aggravating. My ID was given a CSI style investigation between 2 checkers, complete with a nearly 180-degree bend test that literally almost broke it in half. It was initially deemed fake by the first checker, but after giving it to the second with a flashlight, my state-issued ID was surprisingly \"real\".  I now have a creased driver's license. Thanks, Red Lion! I might just have the secretary of state bill you for my next one. \n\n1/5 the place is dirty, obnoxious, expensive and I don't care for it. The only reason you might consider going here is if you drink a lot beforehand and feel like dancing (or getting pushed around by) randoms while [bad] music blares throughout the \"castle\".", "business_id": "TxWfLkj8LLlVLBgA0woYEg", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-11-10", "type": "review"}

Well, Bacaro certainly deserves it: I finally went there for dinner last night (after wanting to go for several months), and I was wowed. I'm still salivating thinking about it.\n\nI went there with pretty high expectations (I'd heard great things about it from several friends and coworkers): that's usually not a good thing as it makes it easier to be disappointed, but Bacaro did not disappoint. In fact, I'm happy to say that my dinner there was on a par with my best dining experiences in NYC.\n\nFirst and foremost: the food. My boyfriend and I decided to share a bunch of dishes. For appetizers, we ordered the fresh mozzarella with heirloom tomatoes and pesto, as well as the roasted suckling pig with homemade sauerkraut: they were both absolutely delicious (don't miss the suckling pig!). We then shared one entree: we got the braised pork shank, which came with sauteed spinach, mushrooms, bacon, and fig sauce: soooo good! The portions are not huge, but two appetizers and one entree turned out to be enough food. For dessert, we got the panna cotta with fresh fruit: simple but just as outstanding. That was some seriously great food!!\n\nAs Bacaro is also a wine lounge, their wine selection is quite extensive. We got a sampler of three wines by the glass for $14, all of which were pretty good. Not to forget the 10yo port we got with our dessert (very generous pour...), which was good also.\n\nService was great, ambiance was great (although it's a shame that the place was so empty)... it was really a great dinner (sure, it was not cheap, but entirely worth it!).

The F bombs were being dropped so incessantly that it became annoying. Our server and the manager that was walking around said nothing to this group. Finally when I could no longer hear what Ayesha was saying, I got up and told the Junior Aristocrats to shut the hell up. The manager and the waiter came over to apologize for the patrons' behavior. I wish they would have done the scolding, not me, oh well.  I could finally enjoy my meal. I got the Marguerite which was cut into strips rather than triangles. The pizza sauce was flavorful, and the cheese was real mozzarella, not that processed stuff that you would find on cheaper pizza. The wine that I picked was really good, though I can't remember what I drank (sorry gang). I really liked the decor and the 007 movies playing in the background.

As I walked into this warehouse sized rock & sports mecca I was surely not disappointed.\n\nThis place is huge. There is an outdoor beer garden seating area on the side of the building and when you walk indoors you realize that this place is airplane hanger big. Rock and roll memorabilia is plastered everywhere here with a terriic amount of Alice Cooper posters, gold and platinum records, photos, paintings, guitars, and other stuff representing his Hall of Fame career plastered throughout. Even all the tables are covered in rock photos and images. Along side all of that is a mix of sports memorabilia spread throughout with flat screen tv's and large projection screens everywhere! Yeah, as you can imagine, they play some great rock music here, classic to current. This is the type of place that Hard Rock Cafe wishes it could be.\n\nThe menu here is pretty big with a mix of classic bar food, comfort food, and BBQ. Nice selection of beers on tap and in bottles. We ordered a mixed BBQ platter and it was actually some pretty decent BBQ! Great ribs and tasty brisket. Alas, what caught my eye was The Big Unit. Not just a regular hot dog, but 22 inches of Vienna Beef destruction loaded with chili, onions, jalapenos, sauerkraut, relish, tomatoes, cheese sauce, shredded cheddar, and bacon, along with a bunch of crispy fries. Oh Yeah! This is the dog that Adam Richman devoured on Man vs Food! They ring a big bell whenever this is ordered. I saw a few people give up on it and take half home in a box. Not me. Now I was going to join that fat ass and do some damage here myself!\n\nYup, I ate that whole damn thing! Honesty, it was pretty tasty and was not too hard to finish. Just had to pace myself. Drinking a huge cup of diet Coke while doing this was not too smart as my gut felt like it was going to explode! Still, I got the whole thing down my throat bit by bit and swallowed it whole. Heh-heh-heh! I sat there in euphoric bliss of my accomplishment. Boy, did I feel like a fat slob.\n\nOn the way out we had to look around the souvenier area and picked up a few things. Had a great time here and the food was pretty good. Nice waitress and all of them here wear Alice Cooper-like eye makeup while working which adds to the fun. Menu items are fairly priced too. This part of town is empty unless a game is going on and there is a parking garage across the street, along with metered spots on the streets but after 8PM they are free.

So when I get bad service, a generally OK experience becomes anything but OK. Lets buy a ticket and check out Alice Cooper'stown.\n\n~Fud/Drink~\nGeneral....bar....fare. That makes it really simple for everyone. Now they have some interesting food options, yes, but there is nothing special. Why elaborate further? Alice's joint only offers greasy fried food options, with little time put into the preparing of said items.  For a football event I went to, they were offering breakfast. I ordered a cheese/egg quesadilla which was \"edible\". Filled with grease, I had second thoughts after ordering it, but was hungry. Meh. Of the two stand out items on their menu, the 22 inch hotdog named \"The Big Unit\" is a big hit. Its big, yes....but that's where it ends. You pay $17+ for a big hotdog guys...its really nothing much to write home about. Why pay that?? If going to the Dbacks game, why not get one or two $1 dogs at Chase? Just saying... I must say the other item on the menu that stood out was the catcher's mitt brownie. For $4.99 you get a HUGE warm brownie plus a scoop of ice cream, everyone at the table was impressed. \n\nAs for drinks, they really are just overpriced. I know they have rent, I get it. But seriously, $6.50 for a draft that isn't close to a pint? Horrible pricing decision. I would've had an extra beer but this turned me off immediately. Nothing else to say, just too expensive for what you are getting!\n\n~Atmosphere/Service~\nAtmosphere is OK, it could be so much better. The inside is fun on the surface, and they have some cool memorabilia hanging up..it is nice to see what Alice put out for us to view. But overall the bar is there for large groups to gather and talk, no extra fluff. When each Big Unit comes out, an obnoxiously loud ringing bell sounds and the bar staff yells out a chant. After a good 30+ rings, I was saved by the bell when my football game ended. As for service, we were the first table to be sat, and had anywhere between 3-8 people at given times. Service was consistently slow, despite the fact the bar was at about 1/2 capacity for most of the day. I had to flag down our waitress a couple times to get service, and remember that brownie I talked about earlier? Well, it sat on our table for 2 hours after being finished. It was still on the table when I had began leaving. So, service was bad. Really hitting the nail on the head, there was no reason why we shouldn't have been waited on more, especially since we had the largest group in the joint that day. Poor service..meh.\n\n~Extras/Rating~\nOverall, its not the best option for grabbing a drink and bite before games downtown. I have made suggestions for other locations, and those suggestions stand. They get 2 stars for location and a nice array of TV's for game day. They lose 3 stars for poor service, poor price for quality, and underwhelming ambiance. They can do SO MUCH BETTER...And until they change things, you can do so much better as well.", "business_id": "oCA2OZcd_Jo_ggVmUx3WVw", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-10-03", "type": "review"}

Being from San Diego, I got spoiled by being able to walk around the beaches, Balboa Park, Seaport Village, the Gaslamp District.... You get the picture.\n\nThough the Desert Botanical Garden isn't free ($15 per adult), I gotta say that this has to be on everyone's to visit list, if one ever goes to Phoenix. The desert garden is pretty amazing, with all it's wild life and vegetation. Walking around the garden paths, we spotted lizards, cacti and birds galore! I even saw a garden gnome (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IdCOpMsZ67g-oQZLgAsnOA?select=-TOj_E-xHmaOBW9NggUMmg). No joke!\n\nCoincidentally, the DBG happened to be hosting the Chihuly Glass exhibit, while we visited. So, we got more bang for our buck. For an additional $3, we also got to see the Butterfly Exihibit. Entertaining since butterflies were on people, as well as plants. Pretty cool, considering we spent almost 3 hours here.\n\nA definite MUST. And, though the Chihuly Exhibit is now done and gone, I do look forward to visiting, again, and hopefully checking out another exhibit.", "business_id": "qMkIbQFrROSnPaQ7at85-w", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-11-03", "type": "review"}

We were lucky and went in November.\nNot a lot of flowers but for someone who is not use to terrain it is really neat.\n\nThe tour is free and really just 5 steps in a circle. The elder man was very knowledgeable and talked too slow for a fast pace world. If I wasn't so eager to get out exploring then maybe I could focus more. I did learn a few things from him but do not expect he is going to take you anywhere but a few steps (I am not kidding.) This is not a tour of the garden in any way. \n\nThe food was great at the cafe. I had a wonderful roast beef sandwich with great flavors in it. \n\nThe views were fantastic! \nThe creosota bushes smelled wonderful as it just rained and the hut made of it was fantastic to stand in and just breath that wonderful smell.\n\nNotes: I would appreciate more place-cards. We spent much of the time trying to figure out what was what there. As their were not many flowers this time of year, maybe to have some of the volunteers around to answer questions would be a good idea?  Just throwing it out there.\n\nThe gift shop had a great variety of herbs, Arizona style gifts, gracious shopkeepers willing to help, and many many plants to take home.\n\nTLDR: Worth the visit if this is your thing. I enjoyed myself but I love nature and it's amazing \"live\" art pieces strewed through out the dessert canvas.  I learned a lot about the flora here in Arizona.

(NOTE: \"Main Entrance\" is on the south side of the building. Once you walk in, the bathrooms are on your left - pool tables on your right. So much safer than walking into a game of darts!)\n\nWe walked in through the Exit... and just about took a dart to the temple. Quick, duck! \n\nThere were patrons playing darts, chattin' at tables, standing at the bar... It was filled without being packed. Open seats at the bar beckoned to us, so who were we to ignore the call? I took my seat and ordered a Guinness. Service was fast and attentive. My 2nd round came right as I finished my first. \n\nThis place is cool, although on the night I went (my first night, for the record) I noticed there was plenty of men, but only a few females. This bodes well if you're looking to get hit on, I thought... Of course, what happens when I just want to chill out with a drink? Guess we'll see next time. \n\nIn any case, with my friend in tow and conversation free flowing, I had a great time. Bonus - this place is within stumbling distance from my new abode. Nice! \n\nSo, naturally, the night I'm saddled up to the bar and enjoying my Irish beer and the happy buzz that it gives me, I notice something peculiar. Never mind the mix of people -- from artistic smarts to tat canvases to baseball fans. Instead, I noticed the female bartenders cleaning up the bar with aggressive impatience... almost like slapping their rags on the bar top was the clear call to clear out. What time was it? I checked my phone. 12:18, precisely. Even bars in Oklahoma stay open later than that. I looked at my comrade in puzzlement. What gives? \n\nI guess we were being told that closing was coming soon, and our patronage with on a deadline. Well then. I savored the last gulps of my Guinness and we left... long before last call, I'm certain of it. But I didn't want to stick around to find out. \n\n4 stars - based on a first experience.

I like that on Sundays, they play different football games rather than just focusing on the Cardinals. And I like that they host different things, like live music and trivia nights.\n\nThe food is very bland. However, it's a bar, so expecting the meal of your life is a little silly. It isn't greasy, bad bar food; it's average and a little overpriced. I would stick to a simple appetizer and some drinks in the future.\n\nFish and chips were OK - the corn was definitely frozen, and I think the fish may have been as well. Burger was very simple and bland. I did like the thick cut fries, but they were probably frozen as well. Portions were pretty good, which is a plus.\n\nThe service was OK. A little lackluster - our server seemed a bit frazzled, and she was the only one working the dining room. There were several tables that hadn't been cleared of the dirty dishes after the customers had left, so seating was limited based on that.

Your description needs tweaking.)\n\nI met my friends at the bar area. I parked out back and walked in via the kitchen area. I did NOT, however, realize I would be walking through a full on kitchen. NOPE. I closed the door in confusion. Double-checked the sign outside that said, \"Enter Here\" and proceeded. A very understanding employee provided me \"directions\" to the bar. \n\nThe bar zig zags around to the hostess stand. This is nice so everyone is not lined up like soldiers and conversations flows. There are standing height tables in the bar area as well. The restaurant section has booths (noted on the way to the bathroom) and copious seating. There is also a private room for events behind the elegant wall of wine.\n\nUsing the company's weekly email we scored a free appetizer. The \"Red chile pork tacos\" come two to a plate and are divine. Grilled pork tenderloin w/chipotle aioli & pineapple fennel salsa. YUM.\n\nHaving had a late lunch I could not possibly justify a decadent dinner. But I desperately wanted to after the tacos. Alas, no. Instead, I enjoyed a mouthwatering cup of the daily soup (Friday is the chicken tortilla). \n\nThe group shared something called \"Crispy Eggplant Bites\". \n\nGoodness!\nRed pepper relish, goat cheese, arugula and a sherry vinaigrette are layered over a crispy heavenly crunchy shell.

I've heard about this place for years and have only within the last year or so been in to take it for a test run to see how great (or bad) it could be. It's lived up to the hype.\n\nThe Armadillo Grill is misleading. From the outside, it isn't what you would expect. It's a sports bar with class and the food is awesome. My favorite? The fried pickles...such a guilty pleasure but I eat them with ease. The wings are also fantastic and so's the calamari.\n\nThe wait-staff are all friendly...every single person I've been served by has been attentive, friendly without being over bearing and sometimes, a big ol' smart ass (specifically Jason the bartender) which is right up my alley. \n\nAny place that has reverse happy hour is a winner in my book seeing as I work late most of the time and rarely get to make that 4-7 slot many places have. And the happy hour is fantastic! \n\nEven when I move closer to downtown, I'll still make my trip up to stop in at The Dillo....you should too!", "business_id": "CqhsIZ7TzCfJTrZqg5-gqQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-09-02", "type": "review"}

The food quality was lacking compared to their norm. Usually I could have shrugged this off but this last time was most disappointing. My wife was just cut from a long double. When we walked in I noticed three very young snickering girls at the bar. The bartender approached us and after ordering our drinks he said he couldn't serve my wife because the manager, who was one of the snickering girls, believed she was intoxicated, which was quite the opposite. The girls sitting around the bar continued to laugh. Obviously we were way more aware than they realized. Normally they have decent bar food and good drink specials but if this how they treat customers they don't deserve business. The biggest complaint is their beer lines taste dirty. The biggest plus used to be fried pickles but now I just enjoy them at The Turf instead. Usually I'm not so easily offended but this was bit ridiculous.

The service is really friendly and attentive, although my husband didn't really go for the wine our server suggested to him.   The bruschetta is fantastic and the cheese plate is ginormous.  Its good to try to get there a little early (think 4pm or earlier) because it does filly up and the parking lot is tiny.

Postino fits the bill.  I called and made a reservation for 12 which was no problem.  (They did take my credit card information which I am totally used to doing for large groups)  We arrived and were seated promptly with great service throughout the night.\n\nI was told when I made the reservation that if I wanted to bring in cake there would be a cutting charge but I could bring in something from Tammie Coe with no extra charge.

I would come back again and again even without the discounted food. \nThis restaurant is quaint and cute.

Im sure many of the other plates at this restaurant are delicious as well, but their specialty by far has to be their bruschetta! Almost any type of concoction and combo you can think of to go on flaky/crispy baquettes, this restaurant has come up with. None of the bruschetta's that I tried were dissapointing.\nLet me start by saying, this place is a \"share with everyone\" type of restaurant, which, I have no problems with because then I get to pig out and taste everyones's plates. haha!\nSo, I literally tasted almost every type of bruschetta that was on the menu.\nLet me start with the Brie and Apples with Fig spread- this almost tasted like a dessert because the tangyness of the apples. The Tomato jam with fresh sheeps milk cheese could also be had for dessert. This actually may have been my most favorite out of all the bruschettas! The cheese was sooo creamy, you could eat it with a spoon. That mixed together with the sweetness of the tomato jam------heaven.....\nProsciutto with Figs & Mascarpone\nThe Warm Artichoke Spread was mighty tasty and fresh and this coming from a girl who grew up in the \"artichoke capital of the world\" \nBurrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomatoes- Adding burrata to anything cant be anything but delicious! And knowing that, I, a corndog/bacon LOVER think that this combo will rock anyone's world.

I live right across the street, so I go to this Chili's now instead of the one in PV that I would usually frequent. When I went to go pick up my food, the girl working take out seemed very nice and pleasant in conversation. So I paid in cash for my food, and this chick asks me if I want my change... Like are you serious?? Do I want my change? The change she owed me was like less than a dollar... I didn't get it, it really rubbed my the wrong way. I just told her no, she could keep it, because at that point I felt obligated to give her the .75 cents she so desperately needed to have... Where are your manners? I understand you make tips, but that is not the way to earn them!\n\nI was even more upset when I got home and realized that the kitchen had tossed my salad in dressing! When I went to eat it, I couldn't because it was soggy and drenched in blue cheese! I hope that girl really appreciated her tip that she essentially flat out asked me for. It was really worth it to me, especially considering she didn't even check my food before bagging it up!", "business_id": "_BU867oRCLZnDIRmg7S6Wg", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-10-08", "type": "review"}
