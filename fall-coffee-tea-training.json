Will power won out this time - no scone for me!\n\nThe food was decent and the service was also pretty good. I ordered a chicken salad sandwich, being more in the average category than extraordinary, I don't think I would get it again. Having to serve my own drink from the fountain, waiting in line for so long to just make our order, getting taunted by all the baked goods, the general chaos of the place, and me personally living so far away (in downtown PHX), I can honestly say I'm not going to be making this a destination for dining. If you're close by and it's not a weekend, I imagine this spot is a lot less hectic and easier to deal with.\n\nHappy Yelping Phoenix.

I've read that this place does most of it's business for wedding cakes and specialty cakes, however they do have a case of fresh goodies to choose from a la carte.  This being my first time, I decided to try a few options. I ended up with an individual apple pie/tarte, a chocolate cake with espresso mousse, and a black forest mousse cake.  Honestly they were amazing, and at about $4-$5 it was very affordable.  Can't wait for my next visit.", "business_id": "YgqexscIgNoMBAO__J97zA", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-09-13", "type": "review"}
