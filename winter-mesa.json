See my review on that, if you like, but I have been nothing but disappointed with any of the jewelry stores in the Samuels Jewelers family.\n\nDon't get me wrong--the salespeople are always fantastic. They're knowledgeable, nice, and good at what they do. Unfortunately for them, they seem to work for the crappiest jewelry chain in the country. Poor souls.\n\nWhenever I'd go in to get my ring plated at the Schubach in Utah, there was always some kind of excuse: our jeweler is out of town/on vacation/not taking orders for a couple weeks. What?\n\nSo, I was excited when we moved to AZ--bigger market, much bigger city, better availability and service, right? Wow, wrong. It was even worse than in Utah.\n\nI called on the 20th because I ended up at Fiesta Mall, where their old location was. They told me where the new location was, and I said I needed to bring my ring in to be plated, but that I probably wouldn't make it in that day but would be there soon. They didn't mention what I found out, after an hour drive, the following Monday.\n\nTheir jeweler wouldn't be back until the end of February. Thanks for letting me know when I called... The associate said I could leave my ring there and get it when he was back and taking orders again. Um, really? Not going to happen. I asked if they were bringing in another jeweler temporarily to serve customers in his absence. Nope. Do they have any partnerships or agreements with other jewelers so I could get my ring taken care of in a timely manner? Nope. Where's the nearest location? Oh, Peoria. Arrowhead. Lovely.\n\nThe saleswoman was apologetic but it was clear she was bound by what her company does when their jeweler goes out of town: nothing. Impressive way to make sure to seal the deal that I will never buy from this company again after my experiences with Schubach. Bummer for them. because I'm sure I'm not the only one who's had this happen... my timing over the course of four years, while possibly bad, cannot be consistently that terrible.\n\nOh well! I have a pretty ring and stories to tell about where I got it. Sorry they aren't good ones, Samuels.", "business_id": "B03tExI-vRaXG3lZ-NyIcg", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-01-25", "type": "review"}

Of course, bits of steel got in and rusted, staining my new plaster.  Fortunately it was only a few small areas, but it's still unacceptable.\n\nLast, they didn't even properly secure the gate.  One section has a double door and the only way to keep a child from opening it means I had to zip tie one side in an awkward fashion.  Even locked, the gate swings open.  Thank goodness my children didn't find out it could have been easily opened before I did.\n\nThese are cut rate providers, my guess is their niche is more for dirt cheap homes that just need a cheap barrier up.", "business_id": "sp4yOcRXBM4y9-lIS8rTfw", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-02-25", "type": "review"}

The front office staff is great, and NP Patricia Janicek is nice and is willing to educate patients (2-3 visits with her), but I still feel left out in the cold by this office.  \nMaybe it's because I'm on AHCCCS, but I'm a first time mom and, for the most part, I feel like a number in this office.  I saw Dr Mayes a few times and she seemed to have no interest in educating or even informing me about my pregnancy.  They just take your weight, have you pee in a cup, listen to the baby's heartbeat, ask if you have questions, and then want you out the door.  No \"your pregnancy is progressing well\" or updates on how your weight gain is going.  I've had to ask for that information and got very short answers.  I get more information from my What To Expect When You're Expecting book.  \nVery clinical, seemingly no concern for the mother or her well-being.  Labs are king here.  So, I'm looking to change because NPs can't deliver, so there is no one in the office I feel comfortable with.

If you are trying to find a new psychiatrist, I highly recommend going elsewhere.  I can't speak much to his personal ethics, as I really don't know him. He seems like a decent guy.  His professionalism, however, is insulting and unapologetically so.\n\nI make appointments usually three months in advance, by necessity to get an appointment.  They do not provide any kind of email reminder service, even upon request.  They do call you the day before.  They won't call you any further in advance than that. If the voicemail doesn't work for whatever reason for the receptionist, she is not going to try again.  Of course if you miss the appointment, or are late, you have to pay something along the lines of $200 (fairly typical policy for missing appointments in the industry, but their reminder 'service' really sets you up for failure.)  Even so, it really is your own responsibility to keep track of your own appointment, so not horrible on their part, but certainly inconvenient, as well as unconventionally unhelpful.\n\nEvery single appointment I have had, I was kept waiting for at least a half hour.  At first, I thought, 'ok.  This doc has some patients who have just had the proverbial poop hit the fan, and has to extend the sessions.'  People have bad days, and I know I have been in situations where my therapy appointments ended at times when 5 minutes more would have made a huge difference to my functionality for the next few weeks.  We are all human, and if my waiting an extra 5-10 minutes means someone can get through their week, it didn't seem like the worst policy. \n\nHowever, waiting a minimum of a half hour, sometimes exceeding an hour, proves to me that while he is more than happy to charge you for his time whether you make your appointment or not, your time is completely worthless to him.  Maybe a half hour isn't a huge amount of time, but if you are working a low paying hourly wage job, trying to pay rent, that missed time at work adds up very quickly into you not being able to pay for things like food or rent. \n\nOne day, I had the first appointment of the day.  I got there on time.  The receptionist was unfriendly and without a good morning, said, 'that's x dollars' as if I were buying a hot dog.  Admittedly, I was not uber friendly either.  I wasn't rude, but I also wasn't being paid to be there.\n\nDr. Zenner had his door open and was talking with someone.  It clearly was not an appointment.  He was really just shooting the shit.  Half hour into my appointment time, a guy with a nice suit and briefcase walked out of Dr. Zenner's office.  Dr. Zenner walked him up to the receptionist desk and they had some friendly goodbye words.\n\nHe then called me in.  There was no apology for the wait time.  No real explanation.  He mentioned he volunteers his time on Tuesdays and Thursdays (it was a Thursday).  I think volunteering is great.  But for someone to volunteer my time without my permission, during my scheduled appointment, especially when I was paying a lot of money to be there as well as not being paid because I could have been missing work (it was a weekday), that is excessively rude.  There is no excuse for that.  None.  And it wasn't just me!  Within that half hour, two more patients came in and sat down, waiting for their appointment.  None of them mentioned anything to the receptionist about being early.  \n\nI have been seeing psychiatrists for over 20 years.  I have had plenty of experience in seeing what is out there, what a good psych is and does, and what a poor excuse for one does.  Dr. Zenner is not evil, but he is offering a business that completely abuses you of your time and does not make up for it in any kind of special psychiatric skill.  He has not offered any real psychiatric help to me that I think any other psychiatrist would be able to offer ( i.e. maintaining a treatment plan developed by another psychiatrist).  Like everyone, I have problems, and I have found Dr. Zenner to be of no real help in getting insight into defining them, or finding their solutions.  There are better psychiatrists out there.  Much better.  Find them instead.", "business_id": "CcBOox3znUKO0zV464Jv3Q", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-02-13", "type": "review"}

So I walk in to a totally full waiting room, which is unusual in a psychiatrists office, and that makes me even more uncomfortable.  Then I sign in and pay my copay and then sit to wait.  It immediately becomes apparent that he is picking up pieces of paper with people's names and their payment receipts attached from the front counter and calling them in for 15 minute appts.  Finally 45 minutes goes by and I ask another guy in the waiting room how long the wait usually is....he tells me an hour.  At this point I have to leave to head back to work so I go to talk to the woman at the front desk and she is nowhere to be found, so I go walking through their office looking for someone.  I tell her I need to leave to get back to work and she tells me that someone will call me to reschedule and tells me there is often a significant wait.  Two hours goes by and I get a call from the office and the woman says that they will refund my copay because they don't want me as a patient.  I asked the woman why they didn't warn me about the wait and she said that a wait that long is not normal, which I know is not true.

I used to live near the office in Mesa but 7 years ago I moved out to Glendale by the Arena. I still drive 45 minutes each way to see him rather than find somebody new.\n\nThe majority of the complaints here are about the wait time.  If you are walking into any Doctors office you best be prepared to wait, as I simply don't know of any which will walk you right in.  He does see a lot of patients, and it is true that at times it can feel a bit like an assembly line in the waiting room, but in his office he is as professional as it comes.\n\n10 Years ago I was a bit confused by his demeanor, in that he seemed to really enjoy shooting the breeze about random things during our visits. As the years went by I came to understand he was also judging my reactions, listening to my body language tone and facial expressions while he talked.  At the times when I do go in with a problem it usually only takes him a few minutes to getting around to asking me what's going on.\n\nMost importantly he listens when it comes to prescribing meds.  I've had doctors who tell you what you're going to take, whereas he suggests a course of medications and sets up appointments within a few weeks of any change to ensure things are going well.  If the new meds do not agree with me he immediately takes me off of them instead of telling me to just give it a few more days.  When meds misfire they can cause a serious case of suicidal tendancies, so I really appreciate that he's not pushing me to stay on something I know isn't working.\n\nMost importantly I was misdiagnosed and mistreated 20 years ago, and the subsequent fallout wasn't pretty.  Dr Zenner had me back in working order in no time.  There have been bumps long the way of course, but prior to seeing him nothing worked.\n\nHe may not be what you think of when you imagine a typical doctor, but for my money he's the best out there.", "business_id": "CcBOox3znUKO0zV464Jv3Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-12-16", "type": "review"}

This is a \"coinless\" laundry, and the machines don't take quarters.  So, all those quarters that you have been saving up to use in the machines won't even get your shirts a rinse.  You can use them in the half-empty vending machines or the empty soda machines, but that's not very helpful.\n\n2. To wash clothes, you need a card that you charge with money (like Kinko's).  A new card costs 89 cents, and you need bills to charge the card.  Once this is done you can get going with washing and drying your clothes.\n\n3. Beyond getting a card and charging it, everything is pretty standard.

I know you can request books if they don't have them on the shelf, and it takes only a day or two.  They also have a great little computer section also!\n\nI've come here on several different occasions, and the staff is always friendly and  helpful.  Parking is good, and I can always get what I need.  They even have a little area that have books for sale!\n\nHooray for the library!", "business_id": "Mi64fhK1mOmXndA2VIoCCw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-01-02", "type": "review"}

You can then reserve it and no matter what Mesa library has it, they will ship it to your local branch. If it's not immediately available, you go on a waiting list and they will email you when it's ready. Then you go in and it's waiting with your name at the front of the library. You never even have to deal with a person, which is awesome.\n\nThe only gripe I have is renewing books that have a waiting list. Sometimes you can renew them online, sometimes not.

No more walking down the line while the person behind the counter asks if you want every condiment imaginable on your sandwich. You wait in a line to order while looking at the large menu posted on the wall, and when you get to the register the guy ringing you up asks what you want on it and rings you up accordingly. You pay and they bring it out to you. Instead of giving you a number, they give you a picture or character from a movie. Cute.\n\nI ordered the Jamaican Red with hemp cream cheese. One of my favorites from the past. When I ordered, the guy ringing me up let me know it was an extra charge for the cream cheese. Thank you! It was just as I remembered. Buffalo chicken, olives, jalapenos, cream cheese....and toasted?!?! Yum!! I'm salivating just thinking of it now. They have an excellent selection of other sandwiches, salads, and treats. I didn't get one on this trip, but the rice krispee treats here are the best I've ever had (besides homemade). Back in the day I used to get the southwest chicken salad, also known as the AZ Homegrown. It was my #1 but it's not on the menu anymore. Curious if the White Widow replaced it? Maybe I'll give that a try next.\n\nThis location has some seating so even when crowded you can most likely get a table or pull up a stool along the window. My meal came to just under $12. Ouch!

I called ahead because I heard that they have really good soup bowls and I wanted to make sure that they had the soup I wanted before making a trip there. When I called, a guy answered the phone and said he had no idea if they had any soup and sounded completely confused by my question. He placed me on hold to check with another employee. I waited about 5 minutes and decided that I should just head that way because I had a feeling that I was going to be on hold a while the way it was already going. I literally walked in the door and was standing in line to order by the time the guy finally picked up the phone. I was on hold for 20 minutes! What kind of company keeps someone on hold for that amount of time for any reason. He then told me that they did not have any more soup and they didn't plan on making anymore tonight. I confronted them about how awful the service was and told them that I would never be going back again and instead of saying sorry or even offering a different alternative he just said \" we were busy so I wasn't able to check until now.\" I would not advice anyone to eat here unless you don't mind being blown off as a customer and being waited on by people who honestly don't seem to care about good customer service.

Don't know why because I wouldn't ask his opinion on anything but my other coworkers figured they could trust him on this one. So here we were - four of us on a Saturday night. The mall was kinda hopping because there were a few spots here that were still destinations at this time of the evening - Asiana Market, Hodori Korean Restaurant, Saketini, and Best Hong Kong Dining. Oh yeah, there's also an Oregano's. So we go into the restaurant and it has a funky layout like a diner where you walk through to the cashier and then they seat you - there are rails that sort of force you to walk past the hanging ducks. This place seems to be known for its duck so I was determined to have some. We were seated and given water immediately - love that delicious chemical flavored local tap water. We then put in our orders and waited a while. Luckily we were entertained by some of the other clientele. There was this dude with extremely glittery shoes. I refrained from taking a photo lest the owner of the glittery shoes figured I was mocking him and ends up being a kung fu expert - breaking out into martial arts and/or a Michael Jackson video. Either way I'd be a goner. Googling \"chinese glittery shoes fashion trend\" got me nowhere - this guy was clearly ahead of the pack. Then our food finally came. My coworkers got some boring standards like fried eggrolls, rangoons, crab puffs, etc. I got the duck lo mein that somebody mentioned in a Yelp review - thank you fellow yelper! That was a winning dish for me. Awesome juicy duck with tasty skin together with cabbage and noodles. Noodles were a little greasy but the whole thing together was delicious. Gave some pieces of duck to the coworkers and they all were feeling buyer's remorse about their own plates. Place itself has very much a diner like feel to it and service is good but a tad on the slow side at times. I was full by the time I finished my meal. Price is actually very good for what you get - can't complain there. Parking? In a mall with a bunch of other restaurants so you get what you get.

There is a wide selection of udon and various other items. I'm looking forward to go back and trying other things. \n\nAnd as for the viewers that dissed on the old man.

And I have unrealistic standards because in LA there are so many Japanese restaurants that you can get a giant bowl of ramen for $6. \n\nThe chicken katsu was very well made - reminded me of the home-cooked curry my roommate used to make in college. The sides were amazing as well. I really liked the cabbage salad. And the gyoza were fried perfectly. Alex's house special came with such a huge variety of food. There was sashimi, teriyaki beef, edamame, and a big pile of tempura. The sashimi and edamame didn't seem super fresh, but they were still good. The tempura, especially, was good.

I think based on the fact that everyone else in the restaurant except for my wife and son were speaking Korean that this is a pretty authentic place.\n\nOh, and the menu is mostly in Korean too, and even the parts that are English don't really make much sense and some of the descriptions are horrifying to my uneducated ignorant eyes (you'll know when you see them).  Fortunately there's lots of pictures and I picked the simple Chicken BBQ plate and whooo boy it's super awesome fantastic.\n\nThe serving staff all speak English and are really helpful in telling you what is what, but all you need to know is to order BBQ Chicken, Pork or Beef and you'll be happy.  \n\nAfter ordering the server will bring over 8 or 9 little dishes each filled with some sort of Korean appetizer.  There's lots of Kim Chi which I'm told is excellent, but I'm a coward.  The potatoes, though were excellent as were several other things that I tried.  If you finish any of the little bowls you can ask for more at no charge.  \n\nWhen the meal comes out you're in a for a great treat!  Each plate comes out sizzling like when you get fajitas.  They're piled high (really high) with your choice of seasoned meat and onions.  And they also give you a big bowl of rice.  \n\nEach bite is heaven.  Oh man, just thinking about it right now just before lunch is driving me insane.  I think I'm going to have to drag Lindsay down there tomorrow night.\n\nWe love bringing our friends here.\n\nHodori is tucked away in a strip mall full of other Asian stores and restaurants.  Its decor is blah, but the staff is nice.  If you're not Korean, don't be surprised if you're the only non-Korean there.\n\nI can't wait to go back.

I suggested Korean food for a date one night.\n\nAtmosphere: Was fine,very casual nothing to write home about american family resturant style. I had REALLY hoped for table top cooking because I think it is just more fun that way. makes things more festive. I also like a bit more traditional korean decor.\n\nService: I had a Teenage Korean American girl who spoke perfect english and was polite but not very attentive. She looked like she hated her after school job.\n\nFood: It was good but not great. We both ordered Bulgogi Which came in HUGE piles on sizzling plates witha layer of White onion underneath.the flavor was good but it was bit dry. The Side dishes were excllentt, I loved the Kimchee(the white radish and cabbage),potatoes and the sprout salad. Yummy.\n\nWine: First time I had korean wine at all. We chose the rice wine that came in a wooden bown. We both loved this. My date is Indian and they have a regional drink that is identical he was so excited when he realized.

The tofu was soft and flavorful.  Several other tables ordered their BBQ meats, which also looked/smelled good.  The side dishes were OK but not as many options as other Korean restaurants I have been to.  They have the basics - kimchee, cucumber, radish, sprouts.  Overall, the food was better than I expected for a place in Phoenix.\n\nNow to the bad: the service was absolutely atrocious, if you can call that service at all.  It is a sign of bad service when every table in the restaurant is looking around for someone to help them.  We waited 15 minutes for someone to acknowledge us and take our order.  Another 40 minutes for the food.  The side dishes come with the entrees so don't count on them when you are starving.  The tofu came without rice, which took another 10 minutes.  All this time, you have to flag the waiters multiple times if you want a refill of water or anything else.  Even when they make eye contact, they ignore you.  People actually left their tables to go to the service area and help themselves!  There were no apologies from the waiters for the wait.  They did not even smile.  The very worst part of the meal was paying.  Naturally, we were not able to get our checks at the table, so we lined up at the cashiers table behind another group.  (Keep in mind there is no cashier so we had to wait for a waiter to decide we were worth his time of day.)  When it came our turn to pay, the waiter blew right past us without help us!  Luckily, another waiter finally saw us and got us our check.  I wish we could have given him all the tip.\n\nThis may be the only Korean place in Phoenix, but I will hold out for when I go to LA.  Even if they have unfriendly service, at least they are efficient.", "business_id": "PX3e3qtBx_5VC3vqq47jpQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-01-06", "type": "review"}

I went there on Wednesday, 1/7/09, around 7 p.m., with my BF for his first eat-out Korean dinner. It's in the northwest corner of Dobson and Southern, just north of the gas station, in the same shopping center as Oregano's and Saketini. \n\nMostly, I wanted to try to find tofu soup--crazy-soft tofu pieces in flavorful spicy broth with whatever add-ins you want, from seafood to beef to mushroom to kimchi. YOM. You could smell the spice and sizzle (much of their dishes are served on hot plates, and meat always gives off a certain smell when charred up deliciously like that). Decorations were sparse and the lighting was almost a little too bright, like cafeteria-bright, with the tables and chairs set up diner-style, in neat rows. It wasn't packed (one half of the restaurant, I guess an overflow section, was dark until a couple showed up later), but business was steady. There was a big group of athletic-looking Koreans in the middle of the room having a seriously happy chow-down (everything looked good) and several Korean and mixed families and couples.\n\nThe hostess/waitress waved at us from across the restaurant to ask how many seats we'd need, then waved us to a table. After that, it was a bit of a wait before we got menus. They had an interesting selection, and by that I mean appetizing, choices and decent prices, with entrees starting at $9 and capping in the $20s. They also have a decent selection of lunch specials. It was a somewhat agonizingly long time before anyone came to take a drink order. By the time our polite, attentive waitress came, we were ready to put in our entire order, so we put in for drinks (which came quickly), goon mandu (dumplings) for an appetizer, short ribs, and tofu soup with pork and mushrooms.\n\nThe dumplings came without our getting impatient, and they were pretty tasty--slightly crisped wrappers and plenty of filling. Shortly after we finished, we received our banchan (traditional Korean appetizers on several small plates). I doubt I can remember all of them, but it included kimchi, kak tu gi (radish kimchi), gam-ja (braised potato and carrot), k'ong na mul (bean sprout salad), seaweed salad, and one or two other dishes, which was more than enough for both of us. We thought everything tasted just fine. After we'd enjoyed the banchan for about 5-10 minutes, they brought our little bowls of rice, then our little pile of short ribs on a sizzling plate (with a polite warning not to burn our hands off) served over raw, thickly slivered onions, and after a few moments longer, our tofu soup in a little hot clay pot. They also brought a raw egg in case we wanted one cracked in. \n\nThe ribs were good, but just a little tough--they're supposed to be that way, but if you're expecting something the consistency of all-day braised short ribs, these aren't them. I loved the tofu soup--eat it as soup or over rice, which is ten times better. It was AWESOME, but I\"m biased because it's like comfort food to me. Soft, creamy tofu curds in spicy broth (they ask you how spicy you'd like it, if you want it spicy at all), and just enough pork and mushrooms to still keep it tofu soup. It hit the spot.\n\nThe wait staff was pretty good about keeping my BF's glass of diet coke filled, and that was a feat in itself. It kind of took awhile for someone to bring the check, but when they did, they brought a few tasty coffee candies. We considered desserts, but we couldn't find any in the regular menu or on any special menus.\n\nOverall, the service may have been a little slow, but it wasn't for lack of trying--plating and delivering and clearing the banchan plates alone can be a Herculean task. We really enjoyed the food and plan to go back again. Our overall dinner was a bit pricey because of the short ribs, but it would be easy to get away with a $25 dinner for two if you went for a couple tofu soups and a couple of non-alcoholic drinks.", "business_id": "PX3e3qtBx_5VC3vqq47jpQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-01-09", "type": "review"}

All of us are very white and very non-Korean so I was concerned about the service we would receive after reading a few reviews on Yelp.  I was actually pleasantly surprised with the service.  Our waiter was very friendly and fast and answered any questions with a smile.\n\nIt was about 7pm on a Wednesday night and the place wasn't too crowded.  There were probably 15 other people in the place who were all of Asian decent so you know the place is the real deal.  The ambiance is a bit cafeteria-like but it didn't matter because I was there for a new culinary experience as this was my first time eating Korean food.\n\nNow about the food....\n\nAfter they take your drink and food orders, your table is given 6 or 7 small appetizers.  I don't remember what everything was but I do remember the kimchi.  I've never had it before but I know it is a Korean dining staple so I gave it a shot.  I was not a fan of it and probably won't ever have it again, but it was interesting to say the least.\n\nHere is what we ordered:\n\n* Mushroom Soon Tofu soup with beef - the soup is what this place seems to be known for judging by the Yelp reviews so I had to order it.  The bowl came out boiling hot which was good because we opted for the raw egg to be cracked and put into it right before it was served.  The soft tofu was a bit different to me but the soup had good flavor and a nice kick.  I would order it again but I'd like to try other ingredients such as prawns, etc.\n\n* Short ribs - this is secretly why I wanted to come here.  I was told they were awesome and they were.  The marinate\\sauce was not overpowering and they were very tender.  I will for sure order these again.\n\n* BBQ chicken - not the leanest or best cut of chicken but it was very good and flavorful.  Again, the sauce\\marinade was not too strong.\n\n* Octopus in spicy sauce - this was the \"crazy\" dish for me for the evening.  I enjoy fried calamari and squid/octopus salad, but larger chunks of squid or octopus scare me a little.  I mean they weren't real big chunks but big enough to where you see you are eating a bunch of those little suction cup thingys that octopi have.  Between that and the chewiness of each bite made my stomach turn a bit.  However, the dish had good flavor and a nice kick thanks to the red sauce they bathed it in.  I'm not sure I would order this again.\n\nAnyway, I would definitely come back again.  I enjoyed the service and would like to try other tofu soups and some of the other meat dishes.  I really want to try the bbq ribeye and bbq pork dishes in addition to more of that chicken and those short ribs!", "business_id": "PX3e3qtBx_5VC3vqq47jpQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-01-07", "type": "review"}

Look around...If there are a lot of Asians eating there and it's always packed, then that's a good sign your at the right place.  Let's start with the banchan (small side dishes)...They are always fresh and plentiful and they have the best kimchi I have had at ANY Korean restaurant (LA and NYC)!  Kalbi and Bulgogi are done perfectly and not too salty or sweet.  Soon Doobu chigaes are perfect.  If your feeling adventurous than try the spicy Squid or Octopus stirfry...again perfect.  The true foodie needs to try some of the hard core dishes like Ah Gu Jim or one of their many different Jungols (Hot Pot).  They do all the basic Korean dishes to perfection and the more traditional ones better than grandma!  I can also say that their quality and freshness is outstanding which sadly is not always synonomous with most Korean Restaurants.  What puts HODORI over the top is the great staff...I didn't think it was humanly possible to smile that much!  Also the owner with the strange spiked hair style is a really nice guy that goes out of his way to make sure your happy even though I found out he's a NY fan (Yankees, Jets and Knicks)...hey, no one is perfect.

In reality, it took another hour and ten minutes to get our food.  I tried a kimchi soup this time--it was alright, but not worth the wait or price.  \n\nI NEVER stiff wait staff, having worked in food service myself. But I planned to make an exception this time, as waiting to be served for over two hours after being seated is ridiculous. However, they added a mandatory 18% gratuity to our bill.

We ordered the korean beef, two of the tofu soups, and a few other miscellaneous items. Everything was really great and had a lot of flavor, the two soups were also very very good and I would definitley recommend to a first time korean food tryer. The reason why I'm giving this 4 stars is because service was just okay. Nothing special. The waiters didn't really seem to care about the food or anything. Secondly, I realized that I'm not the biggest fan of korean food, but that's just me. And third, the prices were a little high. Around $90 for a family of 4/5 (My grandma eats almost nothing XD).

We didn't have to wait very long to be seated but it took forever to order, get our food, pay the bill, etc. They only had three ladies waitressing, running the register, and so on. Our water glasses were never filled. Well at least the food was good. \n\nThe Bulgogi had great flavor and was very tender. The entree was pricey (normal for ribeye to expensive at KBBQ places) but they gave us a huge portion so we ate it last night and today too. The Soon tofu was delicious and packed with tofu, kimchee, tender cubes of beef and seaweed. We asked for medium spicy and it was quite spicy! We can handle spice but for those who can't, I recommend you get it as mild as possible. Definitely loved the soup, I will be back for this one! Lastly the seafood pancake was packed with baby shrimp, octopus, scallion, and mushrooms. It was good but got soggy pretty quickly unfortunately. But when served hot in crispy its yummy dipped into the tangy sauce they serve with it. Banchan was unimpressive and limited, the potato side dish was too sweet (I think they put syrup on it) and the kimchee was just okay. I prefer the seafood pancake and banchan at Cafe Ga Hyang more .

Instead, it was just the regular white rice we typically eat.\n\nSoups were not that great as well. We ordered one with pork ribs, and the meat was not tender. The only vegetables in our soups were green onions, which we are not a big fan of (they're great to give flavor to a dish, but not as vegetables for a meal, I think).

They offer the usual Mexican fare, usually in both chicken and beef (and ONE that offered shrimp). Both the quality and quantity of each dish we ordered was substantial. Suffice it to say that each member of our party left the restaurant with a take-home box.\n\nOur server was stellar. The restaurant wasn't very crowded, so if he HAD been lacking, it would have made things very awkward. But, as it happened, Christian was phenomenal! He was patient with us while we waited for the final member of our party to arrive. He was very diligent with keeping our drinks full and our table cleared.\n\nBut, the coolest thing Christian did for us was regarding dessert. You see, it was my wife's birthday, and her parents wanted to go to this restaurant for a celebratory dinner. My wife was deathly afraid that the restaurant employees were going to make her wear a sombrero and sing a song to her...and Christian almost made that happen. However, when he could see the sheer terror behind my wife's eyes at the prospect of public humiliation, he took the clue, and offered to comp her dessert. \n\nThis shopping center that houses this restaurant is practically empty. There are \"For Lease\" signs in several of the windows. I can see why this place has stood the test of time...though, I feel that their menu could use a little updating, which is the only reason I opted for four stars instead of five for this cozy little relic.", "business_id": "VtpnMevn_oAxXGaM9JDrSQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-12-06", "type": "review"}

Luck of the draw, I tell ya. \n\nI had heard great things about this place, yet had been surprised that I had never heard of this place - until it was time to have a group birthday dinner. What a way to celebrate! \n\nWine, appetizers, entrees, champagne, dessert... It's no wonder somebody didn't have to roll me out afterward. I sampled the calamari and prosciutto/melon apps. Both were very good, although the latter was a bit too salty for me. The bread in the bread basket was good - great way to curb the appetite before ordering - but nothing compared the the herb butter. HOLY CRAP! I don't think I've ever met a butter I fell instantly in love with - well, not until I dined at Tutti Santi, that is. \n\nI ordered the special - orange roughy stuffed with eggplant, mushrooms and probably some kind of cheese. Regardless, it was very good. The creamy sauce was heavenly, too, and I really don't like cream sauces. It came with a side of pasta that was seasoned very well. You didn't need to dip it into anything. It was great as a stand-alone side to the special. \n\nI wasn't the only one who enjoyed my entree. Everyone at the table seemed to gobble up their food. I was the last to finish. Maybe I'm a slow eater? I don't know. \n\nThen came dessert - tiramisu, cannoli, cheesecake. My god! Plus, the owner celebrated our birthdays with a bottle of champagne. So good. Surprisingly, I wasn't overly stuffed to where I felt sick. I probably should have been, but after moving all day, I was sure hungry! \n\nI definitely recommend Tutti Santi for a special occasion, whether it's with a loved one, a birthday party or a family event. You can't go wrong here. As for the atmosphere, it's warm, inviting, cozy - with dim lighting and the soft sway of conversation.

We had about 45 people at our rehearsal dinner and they were all raving about the food (including my mother who is 100% Italian and cook like crazy).

There were multiple appetizer courses including their homemade ravioli, salads, three good entree options, multiple dessert options, wine on the table.  It was nice.\n\nI don't remember the exact numbers, but I remember thinking that we got a smokin' deal, too.  I think it was like $45/head OTD including alcohol.  It might have been more, but not much.\n\nThe other thing that was nice was that we didn't have to do much to make it happen.  We sat down with the owner for about 5-10 minutes and made up a menu and he wrote it down on a torn out piece of notebook paper.  He wasn't a stickler about deposits or anything.

It seemed like it had a good portion of nice reviews so I called and made reservations. Let me tell you I was very happy with my choice. From first contact when I called to book a table, the gentleman I spoke with was very friendly and professional (one of the italian gentlemen who work there). \nUpon arrival for our dinner reservation, she beat me there by a few minutes. By her account, either the owner or general manager was very friendly and welcomed her to the restaurant, and immediately had her take a seat and got her a water while she waited for me to arrive. As I walked in, she was talking with him, and very happy with her experience to that point. We were seated by another very friendly italian gentleman, and ordered the calamari appetizer, which we both agreed was probably the best calamari we had both had! The bread was great, fresh, warm, and flavorful. The bus boy was very polite, and tentative, topping off our waters often. The salads were great...simple, light, and tasty (I'm not a fan of having 20,000 toppings on my salad...greens and olive oil are good for me). I ordered a dish that had pieces of chicken stuffed with spinach, and flavorful veggies with a sauce. So good, I didn't leave a morsel on my plate! Nice portion as well, not so much food left I had to take it home. I had a bite of her ravioli, which was a cheesy goodness but not too cheesy. All in all, both meals were phenomenal, although a tad pricy...but I was kind of expecting that, being V-Day and all. Our waiter was great...something about being spoken to in italian by someone from the other side...just makes the experience better. The owner/general manager was all over the place helping his staff, redirecting waiters, chatting with his guests, it was a great sight. The restaurant was busy when we left, and the owner was happily greeting and \"ciao-ing\" every single person who left. Hell, the bathrooms were very clean, tidy, and smelled good, something you don't always see! This is the kind of thing I want when I go to an quality italian restaurant.

Answer again was 'yes?' not a 'hi how can I help you?' which would seem more customer friendly and professional but whatever. We asked if we could have the air looked at because it was very hot. He said he would send the maintenance man over. He climbed on a ladder and looked in the ceiling then mumbles about some hot water bottle being on said to give it a minute and left... We thought..ok it will cool down. Opened the windows and went to bed. I woke up drenched in sweat and hearing this loud noise. We discovered it was a cricket insie the room and luckily found it and killed the loud guy. We couldnt sleep from the heat and the noise and put up with it until morning.\n\n Breakfast was free, which is nice since a lot of hotels don't offer that anymore but unfortunately the eggs were instant eggs... for free breakfast it was ok. After breakfast I decided to go to the front desk and ask about the heat in the room. The woman at the front was very nice and explained that in the winter time when the weather is nice in Phoenix the turn the cool air completely off and apologized. It would have been nice to have air conditioning for the room since it was so muggy feeling and even though the weather was cool outside, there was no breeze to bring in that cool weather.

I went to the front desk the next morning to complain about the second-rate service from the previous night, and learned that the useless attendant (John) that I spoke to was the owner (along with his father). At that point I realized that complaining to them would be futile. \n\nPS - I just saw the other ratings on this place. They are horrible, except for one that has 5 stars.

I  was there for my  first time ever, on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving. I verified the details of the very impressive sale deal offered, the loopholes, (being there on Friday morning, 3 hour window, etc. etc. I just so happened to be dealing with the General Manager, his first name is Chad. Since taking early retirement a couple of years ago, I have developed a hobby, being a hard to get along with customer. The kind of customer we all used to be. The kind of customer who expected very good value, very good and courteous service, and value as a possible repeat customer.That is exactly what I received when I dealt with Chad at this location. I droned on, talking much and asking too many questions. He was calm and professional. I told him about my bad experience. He was still o.k. He was very knowledgeable about  the tires he sells, he is very patient, and he is the kind of man you hope to find in a management position. I showed up on Friday morning as planned and bought 4 very good quality Bridgestone Ecopia tires for my Cadillac for $450. including all those things they add in at the end, and including tax. I opted to buy the somewhat confusing road hazard for an additional $17.50 per tire. I don't believe it is even close to the free replacement warranty available from Discount and Big O tire. When I picked up my car, Chad was not there. I dealt with 2 employees whose names I will leave out. my agreed price was $520. even. The invoice read $520.43. The first employee decided to stick to his guns and demand the .43. I refused. He called in the second employee, who was delayed in responding. People piling up in line, the first  decided to charge the card 520 even. When the second employee arrived, he began a new round of negotiations and demands as soon as he discovered the .43 was not collected. I strongly recommend this location, but try for Chad. He might even let you slide for the .43. My other advice is to ALWAYS make sure you deal with Firestone Complete Auto Care. If the sign says Firestone, without the \"Complete Auto Care\", you are dealing with a franchise store. Yes, they do exist. They do not honor corporate pricing or policies and your warranty will not be honored at Firestone Corporate stores. This is a very big deal. There are hundreds of Firestone corporate stores, and my understanding is that their warranty is good at all. In the case of a franchise store, your warranty is only good at the stores owned by that franchisee, usually one or two locations.\n  I have returned to the location three times to pester Chad with self imposed minor mechanical problems, and once to ask advice on a good price on tires for my friends in Glendale. They were going to Firestone on Bell Road. He was patient and proficient and professional each time.  If you need tires or repairs, go see Chad and tell him Pastor Steve sent you.", "business_id": "8SlI_CYByLG23erfzobK2Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-02-22", "type": "review"}

I also like the Pad Thai but I have yet to try their Chinese dishes, but I love their Thai food :) \n\nI've ordered from there about a half dozen times and they always remember my address and now even my name (!) and are very quick to deliver.

My food is NEVER a freakin' 9... Its usually kind of spicy or not spicy at all. I'll even say, its okay - I love spicy foods and nope - let down. \n\nI still love the flavor and then I'll throw in some red chili flakes and it'll be all good. :) So if ur a diehard Thai food infianado this isn't the place for you, but if you like \"basic\" and yet satisfying place this is for you.

They have a large number of birds for sale. But, most are behaviorally challenged and euphemistically referred to as \"consignments.\" The truth is, the majority are poorly socialized and would be better described as \"rescues.\" Normally, such birds are rehomed for nominal fees to encourage placement. Cage World is simply profiting from what are severely challenged birds.\n\nThe worst part of this is: Cage World makes little effort to socialize these birds. Employees are usually found sitting in the back office surfing the web. While the store is full of poorly-socialized \"rescue\" birds sitting in cages heartbreakingly small and filthy. These birds often see no human interaction for days. Once or twice a day, an employee (usually unskilled help who is afraid to put their hand in most cages) will change the water and food bowls. But, for most of the day, employees are glued to the computer like they have obsessive-compulsive disorder.\n\nRescuing animals is noble. I have sympathy for rescuers who get in over their heads and can't keep up (trying to \"save just one more\"). But, that's not the case at Cage World. Instead of charging a nominal \"rehoming fee\" (20% of pet prices) to encourage placement of problem birds with people who can donate time, they charge 60-80% of pet prices. Worse: employees act like they don't care. I'm always stunned to see them scurrying to their computers. If they're in the business of placing rescue (special-needs) birds, you'd think they would scurry to those birds and work with them every chance they get. Instead, the computer is a bigger attraction.", "business_id": "_PFouVh3JXbrZpUj0KANwA", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-01-23", "type": "review"}

It's almost like a right of passage for a boy it seems.  The name Phoenix Children's has a trusted name, sure.  Urgent Care, sure, it's not the Hospital after all, or is it?  Well I found out the hard way that just because it is a satellite of Phoenix Children's HOSPITAL, they are free to charge you as if you used the HOSPITAL facility in Phoenix.  When I walked in and spoke to the front office check in personnel, they informed me that during the day this Mesa satellite functions as a normal Dr.' s office but after hours (5pm) it is an Urgent Care.  Never did they mention it is a Hospital and can charge exuberant Hospital fees. \n\n My son had a simple fracture, didn't even break through the bone, hairline.  No bone setting or manipulation of the bone was necessary.  Visit one = x-ray and Dr. approving it was a hairline fracture.  $57 for temporary wrist brace, $527 for Dr.s 5 minute consult, $23 for one  x-ray of one wrist, ok nothing alarming there. 2nd visit 1 week later to cast arm.  Met Ortho Dr. to confirm with Urgent Care Dr. that yes indeed it's a hairline fracture = $1922 for a 3 minute meeting of Dr. and a 10 minute wrapping/casting of arm. It was a fiberglass normal cast. \n\n BUT WAIT a charge of $2,300 to use the facility i was told by Billing.  What exactly did I use? \n\nWell I sat in the lobby chair for 10 minutes, they said it was not for the Dr.'s time that was $1922 remember, NO this was simply to walk through the doors. Really? \n\nThe Billing lady then went on to say that these are standard \"hospital\" fees, I told her I did not go to the downtown Phoenix location and use the HOSPITAL facility, i was at the Mesa clinic.  She said there is no difference in their billing, those are facility uses.  \n\n3rd visit x-ray to make sure bone had healed $26, 3 minute consult with Dr. $394, ok. \n\n One of the charges was also keyed as minor surgery, I asked how is a minor fracture where the bone didn't break the skin and the Dr. barely even touched this wrist considered \"minor surgery\"  No answer. Total bill $5,249 for a simple hairline fracture. \n\nThere is not a sign outside the Phoenix Children' s Mesa Clinic that warned me that if I walked through these golden doors, simply walking through the doors I would be charged $2,300.  \n\nSo out of consideration for others, consider this being your sign, the facility fee is approx $2,300, enter at your own risk.\n\nI am much the wiser, I will use the Pediatric Urgent Care at Cooper/Baseline and just make an appt with Orthopedic Specialist at the Core Institute where I have first hand experience that there are no outrages charges. \n\nMy charges are under dispute because I feel I was over charged.", "business_id": "2bD-KHkntojDT1vqUlRSmQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-12-20", "type": "review"}

I am actually an RN who works in a high risk clinical area with infants so I understand how stressful things can get and I have great respect for others in the healthcare field. I am really disappointed and upset with the treatment my 13 month old daughter received at the East Valley Urgent Care. She had been ill with a fever of 102-103 F for 3 days. She was listless, had nasal and chest congestion and seemed to have trouble breathing. My husband took our daughter to the East Valley Urgent Care when we both felt like she needed to be checked out for her labored breathing. I told him to go to Phoenix Children's in large part because it is such a trusted children's facility. I was at work and called my husband to see how everything was going and he told me that they were checking my daughter for a UTI. I would understand that if it was  fever of unknown origin but my daughter had obvious symptoms of a respiratory infection. With the flu season being in full force I had wanted to make sure that she didn't have the flu or possibly RSV. They performed a straight catheterization on my 13 month old daughter not once but twice. They did not get a drop of urine. They waited and wanted to attempt a third time but I told my husband absolutely not. My husband had to hold down my daughter while she was catheterized for a cough, congestion, runny nose, and fever. Like I previously stated, I am an RN and I understand the need to run tests to rule out possible health problems but I am absolutely livid that my daughter had to go through that. I know she won't remember and I know no real harm was done but if you have ever had a catheter inserted into your bladder you would know how very uncomfortable it is.My husband and daughter left the urgent care and my daughter had a full diaper of urine which leads me to believe that they were not placing the catheter in the appropriate place.

The business office I would liken to a Nazi culture. Totally unprofessional IMO. \n\nMedically, they do a very good job and I was a patient for 10+ years. Kathy  who is in charge in the back and Scott Brown , a P.A. ,  are great at this office(Thomas Rd, Phoenix). I rarely got to see Dr. Tesser -maybe twice a year,  but Scott kept me mmostly out of pain from my RA and him and I had a great rapport , always talking about sports or motorcycles.I hate doctors and did not mind going to see these folks. \n\nThen things changed, on one visit they administered an Infusion to me without getting the prior authorization. They sent me a bill after the insurance did not pay for it because of their mistake. It is not my job to get the prior authorization, it is theirs. And,  I was flabbergasted to get a bill and a demand for payment of $200.I discovered all of this after the incident below:\n\nFor the next 18 months I visited them every 60 days or so and then one day I tried to make an appointment and was told by staff I could no longer make appointments. They referred me to the Head of Billing and gave me her direct line.  I called the person from my car and had Billing on speakerphone so my friend who is also a patient could be a witness. \n\nI went through another back and forth with billing about what was billed, when it was for etc. Ms. Head of Billing acknowledged she received my certified letter back undelivered (the one discharging me as a patient)  but proceeded to tell me that the \"Practice\" had decided to discharge me as a patient. Her explanation was that I was too much trouble as a patient and that it was a group decision to \"discharge\" me. I was floored and got emotionally upset and was not happy at all to hear this. Especially after 10 years and thousands of dollars of business they got from me. \n\nBeing discharged after 10 years for a $200 billing disagreement was and still is shocking to me. Granted, it was unresolved but that is because the charges could never be validated.They still cannot tell me what it is for though i figured it out myself. \n\nI tried to speak to someone else and she refused to transfer me to anyone. I asked for her supervisor's name and she said she was the only person I could talk to and that the decision was final and I had no recourse and no, there was no one else to talk to. \"Surely you have a supervisor\" I asked. She avoided a direct answer and repeated herself that there was no one else to talk to.  I asked her if she knew that my RA is pretty aggressive, that I had just had my 10th anniversary as a patient and did she realize I would be without medication etc. and she did not care-100% cold-hearted about the situation. I offered to pay the bill blindly even though she could not tell me clearly what the bill was for \"might be your deductible\" she said. My friend witnessed the entire call (since it was on speakerphone) and can attest to the content of the call, her rude demeanor and her inability to tell me what the bill was for. Essentially, I was fired as a patient and there was nothing to be done about it. \n\nSo, the morale of the story is, if you get on the radar of the 'Billing  Nazi' for ANY REASON i.e. cancelling appointments, disagree about over billing or anything financial, you should find another doctor because they are going to \"discharge\" you the first chance they get. \n\nWhen Dr. Gluck was alive and they were on 19th Avenue(before the name change) this was a friendly and helpful office. His sudden passing must have affected them financially because shortly thereafter, they became part of  Arizona Arthritis & Rheumatology Associates, P.C. They have never been the same since! \n\nGood Luck.", "business_id": "GA6-xbZ-uemHe4fbN2GQXQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-02-05", "type": "review"}

The food was pretty good the service was good as far as I remember and I wanted to go back sometime,  maybe try the lunch menu. \n\nWe went back last night and had a totally different experience. It was late and we did have 2 children with us, the baby who is now 3 months old and her 2 year old brother. We had just been to the Phoenix Children's Museum for their free Friday night sponsored by Target and we were all tired and hungry. We came in here in the hope that we could get something to eat so we wouldn't have to cook when we got home. In fact we picked this place because it is a \"family restaurant\"  and we expected it to be \"kid-friendly\".   Wrong. \n\nThe  little boy was understandably fussy so I appreciate that this was not something fun for the waiter but at the same time when you're in the service industry sometimes you just have to deal with it when things happen like a fussy 2 year old. We did the best we could to keep it under control. I ended up taking him outside twice to soothe and distract him. We ordered his meal first and asked the waiter could he please make sure that got put in while we decided what we wanted to eat and actually the 2 year old was fine once his food arrived (until he'd finished eating his fill). \n\n\nIt took us awhile to order because of the distractions. I ordered a fancy grilled cheese sandwich with bacon, side of onion rings, my daughter got a cheeseburger with french fries, he got some sort of chicken tenders Kids Meal with french fries, which we were all munching on because we were hungry. Because he was tired he started getting antsy again once he was done. I finally convinced my daughter to call the dad and have him come get the child so we could eat in peace. I waited to ask our server for a container to put the rest of the toddler's food in but he never showed up so I chucked the water out of a paper cup and put the food in there. I went up to the manager at the cash register to let him know I was stepping outside just to give the food to the mom and he ignored me and didn't respond, even picked up the phone as if he was making a phone call. Rude! I just didn't want him to think I was skipping out on the bill. \n\nThe bottom line is that the waiter, Lyle, was  not polite to us. He was as cranky as the 2 year old. I understand it was difficult for him but it's his job to be as pleasant as possible to his customers regardless and we certainly weren't doing or saying anything to be rude to him. Obviously we were struggling just to be able to order and to read the menu. He let it be known he was not happy with us which I'm NOT used to. I'm used to a really nice waiters and waitresses and servers and just don't have a problem with people because I'm a nice friendly person myself. \n\nI pretty much always tip 20%, I mean it's been years since I left less than a 20% tip, I can't even REMEMBER the last time I left less than 20%. But last night our bill came to $ 21.89 and I just added added  $1.11 to the credit card receipt because the service was so bad.  \n\nFrom the time he brought the food till we were done and sitting there waiting, it was 30 minutes and he never even stopped by to see if there was anything else we needed, and we could've used more napkins and water. \n\nThe manager was also very unfriendly. I'm staying in a motel and eat out everyday so I know how servers and managers are supposed to act. This place has had several other reviewers complain about the service and management and I wonder why they don't heed the criticisms and try to improve. I know I won't be back, and neither  will my daughter. \n\nMesa has a plethora of wonderful little restaurants and cafes with good food, and good service and good prices so there's no reason to patronize a place that doesn't measure up. I've been the person behind the counter who had difficult customers and unruly children and I did my best to tolerate and help them out so they would leave with a favorable impression of my business and want to return.

I was so thoroughly disappointed after the third visit there (on my third different masseuse, my boyfriend on his third as well - even he was disappointed and he's not a complainer at all), that I tried THIS particular location.\n\n**I know this review sounds perverse, but it's not meant to be! It's a plain massage, so get your minds out of the gutter!**\n\nAND BOY AM I GLAD I DID! I found an amazing massage therapist (Stephanie, I think?). She listens, is nice without being fake about it, does deep tissue and relaxation when I want, and is quite amazing at both. She follows requests immediately and is always spot-on... and, she also has learned what I want. I used to have to tell her \"oh, a little bit harder... a little more lotion, I'm getting friction there\" and by visit three, she had already figured out what I prefer, and I have yet to have to ask again. She asks me how it's going at regular intervals (not every two minutes, but also not once in a visit). It's great. I always book with her, even though her hours are inconvenient with my work schedule.\n\nMy boyfriend and I go together, and (since I insist on booking with Stephanie) he always seems to end up with a different girl. The only time he was let down was kind of a \"oh, I dunno, it was OK.\" So, he's seen quite a few of the masseuses there and has always been happy - a far cry from Tempe Marketplace!\n\nThe one time I was disappointed (I won't go into detail), it was really a combination of things and I was pretty unhappy. I filled out the survey they e-mail to you (as I had for every previous massage), and I let out a piece of my mind. I was absolutely shocked - this place had been amazing for many visits, and out of the blue I had a visit that was one issue after another. Within 24 hours, the manager called. She was very nice, conversational, apologetic, seemed genuinely concerned. She comped both me and my boyfriend's massages that day (though he didn't complain), and she credited our account with a free massage each in addition.\n\nOne last con... I'm 24 and female. Obviously, I would like a massage from an attractive 20-something guy. Shallow, I know... but I don't spend money frivolously - this is a treat and I want the full experience just once! My boyfriend and I are always in the couples room, and he always gets a young, pretty female masseuse. So, for a fifth star, just for one single massage, GET ME A SEXY GUY TO RUB ME DOWN! Then, I will return to Stephanie and be fully content. I know most massage therapists are female, but there has to be an attractive male one out there. Massage Envy needs to find him and snap him up. I don't even care if he'd be more interested in rubbing down my boyfriend. Come on, just for one visit!\n\nIf it weren't for my lingering annoyance with my singular not-so-spectacular visit, I would have given this place 6 stars if I could have. But, alas, I'm not very forgiving... so in another two or three visits, they may be securely seated back in my good graces, at which point they will get a full 5 stars.\n\n- Jessica", "business_id": "xL6bzAhtSzjVTesWeRw1qA", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-01-21", "type": "review"}

I am a regular, or was a regular now!\n\nI never come in on Monday's,  I usually come in on Friday or Saturday.  This is the first time I ever met Bale.  I normally get served by Sarah & Jenn (who are the best & I like dearly).  \n\nThis night, Sarah served my first beer.  When Sarah went on break my beer was empty and I set my glass on the edge of the bar so the bartender knows I am ready for another.  Keep in mind, I am by myself at the end of the bar.  I see her look at my glass and walk away at least two times to serve others at the other end of the bar.  The third time I wave her down and she doesn't even give me a \"I'm sorry I will be right with you\" (recognition of some sort).  So I do something I never done before and that is poor my own beer.  Now, I got her attention! After explaining to her why I did what I did (the fact that she was deliberately ignoring me), Sarah comes back from her break, and I explain what happened.  Sarah knows me and was very nice about her reasons of having to kick me out.  It is illegal to pour your own beer, now I admit, I was not thinking about that at the time, yet I am glad that happened just to prove a point.  It took me doing something like that to get Bale's attention, what does that say about a person like that.\n\nIn conclusion, I was told I can come back another night, but because of my action Sarah had to ask me to leave, I want to note that Sarah has always given me great service.  However, because of one person, Bale, I will not be coming back to this bar.  I have more class than that, to let someone treat me like I am nothing, when I am a consistent customer.  The sad thing about Bale, it is people like her that leave me hopeless in seeing this local economy thrive again.  I moved back to this neighborhood to support this area, yet people like her have made me decide to move back close to my job in downtown Phoenix  Everyone has to understand, I grew up in this area.  If you're a native like me, you'll understand, if not, you probably will not care.  The bottom line is thanks to the internet consumers like me have a voice.

We are in a 3rd story 2 bed/2 bath apartment. \nEvery time our neighbors across from us come home or leave,  it's like the whole building shakes. Anyone who walks heavily up or down the stairs causes vibrations in our walls it drives us nuts.\nOur downstairs neighbors are very nice but must hate us: The floors are so poorly put together that anytime we walk around in our apartment they can hear it. We cannot even go into our other bedroom at night lest we wake them up. We cannot vacuum during parts of the day lest we want to piss them off even more. They are very nice to us, and we try to be considerate of them as much as can, but the poor quality of the apartments actually affects our daily lives, and that is unacceptable.\nMaintenance is awful, although it has gotten better lately. Recently our A/C started dripping all over our kitchen and it took maintenance 2 weeks and 5 visits to fix it. We are also by the center pool, overlooking it, and for nearly a year it was one problem after another (lights not working, pool overgrows with algae, lights fixed but then break 2 days later). It was a nightmare, although there have been no problems as of late. This is just one anecdote to describe how bad maintenance is in general.\nThe only reason we picked this apartment complex over others around it is because they were nice to us on move in, they were legitimately gated (versus gates only partly around it), and they were close to the light rail.\nSpeaking of the gated community part of it - gates are broken 50% of the time, so good use that is.\nOur biggest complaint is really the quality of the apartment itself. Our bathroom faucet leaks all the time, our cold A/C leaks out the front door because it's not sealed properly. We had to install our own second lock because first one was shoddy. When we moved in our carpets were crap, they did not even replace them before we moved in! I know they can put new ones in and get the deductions as they depreciate. They actually had to come in and spot fix the carpets they were so bad, missing entire chunks, etc. The drawers in the kitchen are made of particle board, so every time we open/close one, it drops specks of wood in the drawer below, on top of the things we use to cook with, disgusting! Our oven is a POS too.The only ting new and decent in the apartment is the washer and dryer we rent from them (extra to have that as opposed to using the laundry rooms). We don't use the pool or laundry rooms so I can't comment on them. The gym is so-so as well (there is always something broken).\nWe are already settled in and simply do not want to put the effort into moving again, but I really wish we picked another apartment complex.

Not many people people in Mesa go West of Dobson on Broadway.  If they do, they are going straight into Tempe, and driving by this place without ever even knowing.  I would have been one of those people had I not found this on Yelp.  \n\nI wish the place well.  There is a lot of competition for Middle Eastern restaurants in the immediate area.

But back to the restaurant - looks like kind of Chinese restaurant my parents would have taken to me back when it wasn't one of many choices but THE Chinese restaurant in that part of town where everybody in that area went to get their Chinese fix. Back when asking someone if they preferred Hunan to Szechwan would get you a response like \"what'd you call me?\" So my usual dining companions decided on this place when we tried to go to Beavers Choice but they were closed for lunch due to some odd circumstances. Place is in a mall right near the 101 and has plenty of parking. We entered and were seated right away. Looked like the lunch specials were the thing to go with so we each got our own lunch combo. I got the sweet and sour pork and it came with an eggroll and egg flower soup and also some white rice. Meal was decent and filling - the type I would expect from a place like this. The layout is a little weird - we were seated in a raised area. If you want to get up to use the restroom, you have to cross tiny walkways which also act like delivery express lanes with servers carrying plates back and forth so it ends up being like a game of Frogger - you gotta cross quickly and at the right time. Good times. Price - it was very cheap for what you get - like the prices got stuck in another decade - so my coworkers want to come back here again. Myself, not as enthused as I felt there wasn't anything really that special about the place or the food. Of course, my coworkers were also entertained by our neighbors at the next table whose conversation overpowered ours. Several old gals who talked about past husbands sparing little detail - what little we heard was enough to make my coworkers want to introduce themselves so they could hear more at a future date. I had to drag them away back to work. Would come back if in the area and out of other options and if my coworkers really start working on their script for Fifty Shades Of Grey-haired Bastards.", "business_id": "PNrOTfMmE0CJFV9YwSLzYw", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-02-16", "type": "review"}

After reading the great reviews I thought this would be a great place to drop by this afternoon after school. I called and found that the price for a gel manicure was very cheap and with that and the great reviews, I was in! The technician was very nice, but that's probably the only other good thing that I will say about this place. First off it was dirty, not the station where my nails were done but around it. The molding on the walls and dry wall had holes in it. It looked very run down. Also, the selection of gel polish colors was dismal. Very dismal. They did not have the color that I was looking for (which, I understand is a standard OPI color carried everywhere) so I opted for clear. She cleaned up my cuticles alright, but left quite a little bit to be clipped off. But here comes my REAL issue. Filing. The filing job on my nails was so incredibly sloppy. It left them jagged, uneven, rough, and dirty. I did not notice this at first because I was just relaxing and the place itself was very dark. She applied the polish and I left. Looking at my nails after, the polish was also uneven and painted off of my nail and onto my finger. I actually had to stop by Walgreens and get a nail file and FIX my freshly done nails. I guess you really get what you pay for, which is a real shame. Next time I will stick with my usual place and pay a little more so that I know it will be done right the first time!", "business_id": "2tqzvL7OPWsHkaN3GHNeIQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-01-18", "type": "review"}

Tonight was the night to try it out because a place we know we like looked really busy. The entry way was super crowded (not from being too busy) as customers who enter have to walk around the customers who are in line paying for their meals. It seemed like my kids were getting in people's way. I'll be the first to notice when my kids are being annoying, but in defense of their innocence on this occasion, I must say they had nowhere safe to stand as we waited for the hostess to return. My toddler was almost taken out by a bag of takeout food being offered to a customer standing in the very crowded foyer. How could I have explained that tragedy to his grandparents? \n\nWhen we were finally taken to the \"dining room\" I felt as if I had been magically swept away to a 1970's Waffle House. The lighting in this room -which consisted of ceiling fans and recessed can lights- could truly only be understood by folks who have found themselves in police interrogation rooms. The sunniness of the room does nothing for the ambiance, as it only makes patrons aware of how many crushed chips are on the floor and how the decor is reminiscent of the living room of an 85 year old \"winter visitor\" from Minneapolis. Normally the decor of a place isn't something I would critique, but I would expect something a little more pleasant when price range is considered. It's like being asked to pay the price of a bottle of Dom and instead receiving Boone's Farm Wine. No, it doesn't break the bank, but seriously, this is AZ; some of our best Mexican food is served on a paper plate. I would never critique these places for their lack of ambiance. This place, however, with their $6 (for one) shrimp taco, doesn't warrant the price tag. \n\nUpon being seated our waitress took our drink orders. I decided to have the chicken mole (12.95) and my husband had the green chili chimi dinner (10.95). I think the kids' meals were a pretty good deal and I liked that I was able to order soup for my little guy. After our drinks came, we waited and waited to have someone bring us chips and salsa. We began to wonder if they were in fact complimentary here, as numerous members of the staff walked by without offering them. I finally asked our waitress for some as she walked by. She looked at me like I had a butt growing in the middle of my forehead and said, \"yeah, sure,\" and kept walking. About 5 minutes later she stopped a busboy right in front of our table and told him that when he \"had the time\" he should get us some chips. I was mildly annoyed. \nHe stopped what he was doing (I guess he had the time) and got them for us. Thanks big guy! \n\nWhen the food arrived I was in shock at the portion size. The meat on my plate was enough to serve my whole family. In my opinion this isn't always a good thing. I would rather be served less food and charged a smaller price. These grotesque portions have led to our country's reputation in the global community as the land of lard. Enchanting. The chicken mole itself was decent, nothing to write sonnets about, but it was good. It was served with some iceberg lettuce (tepid from the hot plate), pinkish tomatoes (delightfully flown in from Chile, I'm sure), and a warm, soft tortilla on the side. I liked it well enough. The boy's soup (ablondigas) was \"mildly seasoned\" exactly as the menu proclaimed. The prevailing flavor was that of the saltines we crumbled over the top. Was this bad? No. He's 3, he likes \"mildly seasoned\". He also seemed pleased with his very large meatball. My daughter must have enjoyed her taco, because she left no evidence of its existence on her plate. My husband's chimi was really good. In fact, if we find ourselves there again, I'd suggest splitting one of those with him. It was enormous. \n\nThe bill came to $39 and some change. I felt a little cheated, as I know places in this town where the experience would have been a bottle of Dom at a Boone's Farm price. At least I'll get some \"not too bad\" warmed over chicken mole out of the deal.", "business_id": "CuyNmwDOLeMTrbv2c6rNxA", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-01-28", "type": "review"}

I thought of myself as having some brand loyalty...at least when it comes to local retail purchasing.  I do look online if it doesn't require holding or fitting. \n\nHowever, the last purchase I will ever make from Ski Pro was last summer.  I bought a Ronix ski rope handle.  This was one of their nicest and most expensive models, priced over $120. At checkout I was told about their 2 week return policy.  \n\nThe following weekend we went to the lake.  After 2 or 3 runs, I noticed it was already coming apart.  Not just in one location either.  The rubber grip was tattered already in two different places, the seams were falling apart, and the clear coating was flaking.  \n\nIt never touched anything other than water.  Not the board, swim deck, boat, or anything. Literally, about 3 hours of use by two very experienced riders.  \n\nThe next weekend, 11 days after the purchase, I returned to the store to exchange the rope for a different one and was basically told to \"F off\".  \n\nThe 17 year-old stoner behind the counter said they couldn't return the item.  I wasn't even looking for my money back, I just wanted an in-store credit to buy a different handle.  The answer was still no.  \n\nHis position was that they can't take back the product because it had been used.  Yet he couldn't explain why they allow returns on all other ski accessories which I've purchased mass amounts of over the last 7 year.  I've even returned a wake board I bought from Ski Pro after taking to Lake Powell for a week!  Back then (2002ish) Susan, the owner, ran the Camelback location and had a better grip on things. \n\nSo anyhow, I asked the clerk how I would've know the product was faulty unless we used it.  He shrugged his shoulders and said \"sorry dude, you own it now\".   \n\nApparently, the two week policy is only for unused items.  I asked how they assess if something's been used (given that I've returned numerous items and admitted they were used) i.e. boots that were pinching, shades don't fit right, board not aggressive enough, etc.  \nHe stated \"it's a case by case basis\".  I couldn't believe the product warranty and company return policy was being judged by a 17yr old kid and basing his decision on if an item looks used. He even said to me \"if it looks used, how would we be able to sell it to anyone else?\"  I asked him why they would sell a faulty product to someone else.  He shrugged.   \n\nAfter about 4 minutes of him not being able to explain this ridiculous policy, I decided to leave the product with them in hopes they would reconsider their position and reminded him I would be happy to apply the amount to another handle. No dice.\n\nThat is the last time I'll ever shop there.  Period.", "business_id": "4CMY6DwWo41UdwzE-TUW9g", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-02-10", "type": "review"}

It's contently located next to the 60 and 101. Quick and easy access to anywhere in Phoenix. The pool area is awesome. Our kids swim nearly every day during the summer. This place has the most storage of any apartment this same size that we have seen. A water vending machine is located on site. Laundry cards for the washing machines are much better then lugging around spare change. Some of the new apartments have washers, dryers, or hook-ups. They have two gas grills that we use on a regular basis. There are so many parking spots available which makes it easy if you have two cars. The only thing I wish they had was a playground for my 5 year old. Laura and John in the front office are great. They are always friendly and quick to help you out with any requests or needs. Ray is in charge of maintenance and is always hard working and very polite. You'll see him up at the crack of dawn cleaning the grounds.", "business_id": "vfgTIwE42X5mcg1s_ITk8g", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-02-03", "type": "review"}
