Well, faithful followers, I must now admit that The Dor-Stop has now been verified as only one of the best.  Why?  That's because Gab and Eat I have now found to be THE best breakfast I've ever had.  If it was closer to my home I would quickly become a regular.\n\nI easily decided to order the Mixed Grill (Half).  Before I go on, I must ask...has anyone seen a full order?  Because I honestly can't imagine how much food that is.  I created my own with bacon, cheese, eggs and potatoes.  Based on reviews I also opted to get a side of the sausage and was pleased as punch when our waitress asked if I wanted hot or sweet....or one of each.  I like variety, so I jumped on the change to try both.  I also selected the Italian toast - what other kind is there, really?  \n\nWhen my food arrived, it looked delicious.  There was so much bacon that after eating half of my Mixed Grill it looked like I'd barely started.  The sausage was great, just don't ask me which one I liked best.  My toast?  4 thick slices that looked to be about half the loaf and were buttered on both sides. It was a struggle, but I was determined to enjoy every tasty morsel and not leave a crumb.   \n\nIn case anyone is wondering, yes, they use real butter.  I saw pounds of it stacked in the kitchen with my own two eyes.  The wait staff was quick and efficient as well as helpful and friendly with our larger group of 9 people.  The fact that none of the plates match and I noticed a sign at the front register that said, \"We need mugs\" just makes me love this place even more.\n\nA few tips: 1.) Order the Mixed Grill.  2.) Cash only!  3.) Gab and Eat is a popular place but also very small and narrow (or cozy if you will).  I recommend going during the week when they are still busy but can accomodate a group.  That way you won't feel rushed or crowded.  4.) Get to Gab and Eat ASAP!  You'll be glad you did!", "business_id": "b9WZJp5L1RZr4F1nxclOoQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-04-07", "type": "review"}

We have to agree with most other reviewers that this is a place to eat.\nWe arrived around noon on Saturday and were happy there were a couple open tables. The place is tucked at the end of a strip mall and you have to look to find it. There is plenty of parking.\nInside the decor is quaint and funky at the same time. Country style decorations and signs are mixed with nostalgia signs & posters. Most interesting are all the signatures and comments written on the wall by past customers. We regretted not having a marker to add ours. The other highlight was three large white boards with trivia questions - fun way to spend time waiting for food.\nThe waitstaff there is...uh, experienced. They are attentive, pleasant and efficient.\nAfter reading reviews I had to try the Mixed Grill. But S went with pancakes with a side of bacon. The pancakes were outstanding...maybe the best either of us has eaten. They were thick but with light texture and rich flavor. \nHis bacon was cooked just as requested - as crisp as possible - and very flavorful.\nThe Mixed Grill is a mixed together concoction of eggs, potatoes, onions, peppers, cheese, and spicy Italian sausage grilled together. I'm glad I heeded those who stressed going with the half size order. It filled a full sized dinner plate with a heaping order. I couldn't finish it all and that's rare. How do they serve the whole potion -- in a trough?\nEverything was cooked well. The sausage added a nice bite to offset the somewhat plain potatoes. You can build your own mix but the basic was a good mix.\nMy only complaint was the amount of potato and that they are pretty plain. I like home fries with lots of seasoning that have aged on the grill. These potatoes were pretty uniform chunks with little seasoning. Personal preference.\nIt usually comes with Italian toast but they were out so I went with raisin. It was delicious soft inch thick slices.\nCoffee was excellent and the cup stayed full. The total was less than $15. Fabulous value for the quality and portions.\nWhile I can't say it's the best breakfast in Pittsburgh (only here 3 days), its the best so far and one of the best we've had.", "business_id": "b9WZJp5L1RZr4F1nxclOoQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-04-13", "type": "review"}

The menu is very basic- no specialty pancakes, waffles, or french toast and only 1 specialty omelette. There were no meal options, so if you want home fries or something, it's extra. The omelettes do include toast. (Great bread, btw!) We had to wait a while for our food, which was surprising because we've been to a lot of diners. My husband and I both got omelettes and agreed that the contents were not really cooked with the egg. It's almost like the egg was completely cooked and someone threw the cooked contents in there and just folded it over. As for my mushroom and cheese omelette, the cheese was lacking. My biggest peev about this place is that it's CASH ONLY. Perhaps I missed it, but I'm pretty sure this wasn't noted anywhere on the menu or the front door.

The pancakes are sweet, the bacon is always crisp and I can't find anything bad to say about an omlet special that includes bologna (aka jumbo).  \n\nI guess my best recommendation has nothing to do with menu items: go on a weekday.  Weekends this place is hopping and there will likely be a wait.  Sure, it will be worth it, but if you can swing by early on a weekday you won't have to and the food will be just as good.  A friend of mine will call me now when she has to take her car to the dealership on West Liberty Avenue because she knows I will take her to the Dor-Stop.

I went on a weekday morning so that I could actually get a seat and have the food at it's prime--not cooked in a hurry to see how the food really was.  Well, that was also the only time I had, as well.\n\nI was greeted quickly and seated and given a nice cup of coffee.  They did an exceptional job of keeping the coffee mugs full (another reason  to go on a weekday) and it was good coffee.  \n\nI had to try the hot cakes, but didn't want to OD on carbohydrates so I got the Egg Combo with the speciality hotcakes.  The waitress recommended the banana oatmeal or the apple cinnamon.  I went with the banana oatmeal.  Two over easy eggs and bacon, though they offer sausage patties or links in both regular (sage) and hot.\n\nMy food came quickly and I was disappointed to find the eggs sharing the plate with the hotcakes.  I like my food separated and dippy eggs leave a residue that sometimes can't be mopped up with bacon.  I guess I would have preferred a plate with the eggs/bacon and a plate with the hotcakes.  \n\nThe eggs were cooked perfectly as was the bacon.  Crispy yet chewy.  I have to eat my eggs and bacon before I can eat my hotcakes, because, again, I don't like my food touching--especially something sweet and savory.  \n\nLet's talk about the hotcakes.  They were served with a big dollop of whipped butter which I loved.  Whipped butter spreads pretty easy.  I like that.  I'm picky.  Especially with breakfast.  There were slices of banana cooked in which I also liked.  They tasted like a diabetics worst/best nightmare.  They were sweet and fork tender like a nice pancake should be.  They would have been fine without syrup.  When I added syrup it felt like I was eating a slightly sweeter version of banana bread.  I wanted to stop at one.  I really did.  I really really did.  I was getting full.  I can stop eating food that isn't good without much of a problem.  I had a problem with that second hotcake\n\nMy other \"complaint\" is that is is rather expensive for a small diner.  I paid a little over $10 for my breakfast.  For $10, I would have preferred a more generous portion of bacon, at least.  My idea of pricing is a bit off, I guess, mainly because I live in an area outside of Pittsburgh that is a lot less expensive.  \n\nSo, I will go back, for sure.

Why? Because I eat the same thing every single time I eat there. I have no time to be bothered by some silly pancake when there is serious business, in the form of eggs benedict, that needs taken care of. The eggs benedict at The Dor-Stop is just the way I like it. I feel like so many breakfast spots serve benedicts of all sorts that are usually quite small, have very little hollandaise and are served with a salad. Maybe I am the odd one out in all of this but I cringe when I see a salad served with breakfast foods. I go out to breakfast to eat unhealthy, artery clogging deliciousness. If I wanted to concern myself with veggies I would stay at home and save my money and eat at home. Anyways, their eggs benedict consists of the diner's ham off the bone, two eggs, mancini's bread and a pool of delicious hollandaise. There is no stinginess when it comes to this meal. Everything is heavy handed. In addition to the huge eggs benedict, there is a beautiful mountain of potatoes that comes with it. Everything about this dish is how it should be.

Given that we were headed out to South Park for a hike, and we wanted to get brunch beforehand, I suggested we take the opportunity to try the Dor Stop, since Dormont was on the way and I'd heard great things about their brunch (not to mention that they were on DDD!).  In hopes of beating the late-rising rush, we arrived at around 10:30, and it worked out perfectly, since we only had to wait about 15 min. to be seated.\n\nOnce we were seated, we were promptly greeted and given menus by one of the waitstaff.  Having checked out the reviews ahead of time, I knew I wanted to try the raspberry French toast.  I mentioned the other items that had been featured on DDD--and that people enjoy, based on the reviews--to CM, and he decided to go with the famous pumpkin pancakes (yeah, that's what I call them, rather than hot cakes--so sue me!).  Our order was taken promptly, and was delivered to our table about 10 min. after ordering.  My French toast looked exactly like I expected, based on the pictures--it consisted of four toast points covered with raspberry sauce, and drizzled with raspberry jam.  The toast was perfectly crispy, and the sauce was delicious and flavorful--it was everything I could want in a sweet brunch item!  However, I did find the name of this dish a bit misleading, since the toast itself wasn't actually stuffed, unlike other versions I've tried before.\n\nI tried a bite of CM's pumpkin pancakes, and they were also delectable--unlike most pancakes I've had, they were quite moist even without any syrup, and definitely included real pumpkin, rather than just pumpkin pie spice, like many pumpkin items I've tried.  The butter added some welcome savoriness to the sweetness of the pancakes, and a bit of syrup added some additional moistness.  Since both of our dishes came with a breakfast meat, we ordered bacon (duh!), which provided us with a supply of umami flavor when we wanted a break from the sweetness of our entrees.\n\nOverall, CM and I were very pleased with our experience at the Dor Stop.  Our total check, which included a glass of milk for me in addition to our entrees, came to around $20, which we felt was quite reasonable in light of the quality of the dishes.  Service was friendly and efficient, and the ambiance was cheerful and light-filled--exactly what I'd expect in a diner.  Even though we both felt a tad out of place among the clientele, which was almost completely white families with young children (very different than your typical East End eating establishment, which is what we're both accustomed to), we felt welcome.

On my quest to be a refined English lady I've been on a hunt for the cities best high tea service.  Probably not the most popular past time, but you can't knock it until you've tried it!  And... You MUST try this place!\n\nThis is a proper setting for such an event, you almost feel like you need white gloves and a parasol!  And surprise, the Inn is actually an Inn!  Apparently it dates back to the olden days of yore (late 1800's) and is one of those old Shadyside mansions that was converted into an Inn at some point.  But if you have relatives who want something more unique in the heart of a vibrant Burgh neighborhood, I'd suggest here!\n\nLet's get to the tea service though!  It's served from noon to four daily, which is nice for a \"ladies who lunch afternoon\" or a Saturday or Sunday outing for mom.  It's in a parlor, which is small but charming.  There's also an outdoor patio that would be nice if it's not too hot out (drinking hot tea in 80 degrees isn't too appealing).  There's a full High Tea Service for $20 per person, which seems a little steep, but for tea service isn't too bad.  There's also other combo's for around $12, but I'd say go big or go home!\n\nThe tea menu is VERY large and there were tons of choices. They give you the main choices between black, green and herbal, but you can also blend them together too.  I chose the caramel vanilla, which I guess is being taken off the menu sadly.  It was delish though... so maybe they'll bring it back at some point.  There were honestly a lot of different ones I would have been more than happy with too!\n\nThe one thing I think is very cool and very different is that they offer you a different tea selections with the different tiers of food.  I've never heard of them doing that before.  Usually you get one tea choice and that's it.  I love that you can pair the foods together with different teas for no up-charge.  Very unique and a definite perk of coming here.  \n\nI've been to several High Tea Services and this one would definitely be on the light side.  The portions were small, but surprisingly filled me up for the entire afternoon until a later dinner.  I mean, it's tea service, not a five course meal!  There was a chicken and egg salad sandwich and a mushroom and cream cheese on a crisp baguette.  The winner was absolutely the mushroom and cream cheese choice.  It was amazing and I definitely could have eaten ten of those!  \n\nThere were two scone choices of blueberry/peach and lemon/lemon ginger.  Those were actually surprisingly tiny.  I thought they were both moist and fresh, but I would have loved them to be a bit bigger because they were so good and I love to slather clotted cream on them!   Oh, and there was also fresh fruit.  Which is great and all, but more scone please!\n\nThe last tier was the desserts.  Forgive me for not being accurate enough, but there was a delicious chocolate piece, cheesecake with lemon curd and blueberries.  Loved the chocolate, but I like my cheesecake plain.  While it was good it wasn't life changing.  BUT, the coconut macaroon was honestly thee best macaroon I had EVER had.  Again, ten of those in my possession would have been scarfed down in like 5 seconds.  I would buy a batch of those if I could!  Seriously, can I??\n\nI can't wait to bring my mom here, total mom place fo sho!  But I also love it for myself too!  Or for a bridal shower... If I could do another one (since I'm married I don't think that's proper).  But it's a great place, that's what I'm trying to say and I'll for sure be back to get my proper English lady on!", "business_id": "rUQfZOengMpXFkLvJrNJ3g", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-05-16", "type": "review"}

On our last trip we started with a small bowl of fruit followed by the pastry selections-these are always fresh and made in house.  This time it was lemon poppy seed bread and cranberry muffins. They were both absolutely scrumptious and I was wanting more as you only get a small sample.  Next up we got to pick our entr\u00e9e-they don't have a menu and usually have 4 choices and then eggs any style. I went with the goat cheese, asparagus and leek omelet with potatoes and turkey bacon (loved that this was an option).  My date ordered the hash with poached eggs and regular bacon.

They are nicely crisped on the edges because they are cooked in a disgusting margarine-like substance that always leaves me, personally, feeling a bit ill.  The coffee is forgettable, the eggs are passable, the bacon is inevitably chewy -- which right there should cause someone to be marched out to the firing squad -- and their lyonnaise potatoes are insultingly limp (and, like the pancakes, soaked in margarine).\n\nIf you are dragged here by your friends, find new friends.  If you can't do that, then try to get one of the pancakes that come with some sort of whipped or sour cream.

Well, I figured what better way to experience them than to order a short stack, right?  They were super buttery... Too much so.

Naturally, with all the high ratings we saw on Yelp! for Pamela's, we gave it a shot.\n\nI have to ask: What is all the fuss about this place?\n\nMy companion and I were a little dismayed to see it was a cash-only place, but luckily in Shadyside there is a PNC just up the street. The restaurant was fairly busy with lots of customers chatting at their tables. It wasn't an uninviting atmosphere, more laid-back, but also a little indifferent, if that makes any sense. Our waitress wasn't unfriendly, but didn't really go out of her way to talk much with us.\n\nAfter perusing the menu for a bit, the fella ordered a Greek salad with chicken while I went for the crepe-hotcake dish. Food came out pretty fast, but that was sadly the best part about it.\n\nMy companion's tiny salad was served in a large silver bowl, like the chef had mixed it up and decided better of putting it on an actual plate. The Greek dressing was saturated with lemon flavor, way too tart and sour, and the chicken was pretty paltry for the price.\n\nMy crepe-hotcake thingies were okay, but very oily and griddle-tasting. Way too rich to finish.\n\nOverall, we found ourselves very underwhelmed with Pamela's.

They told us only 10-15 mins and it was spot-on, which we were pleasantly surprised about! Our server came to us right away. I could immediately see how fast-paced they work to keep their customers flowing on a busy morning!\n\nEveryone in my group would agree that the best part of the meal was the lyonnaise potatoes. My friend recommended asking for the potatoes to be \"crispy\" and I'm glad I did. They were absolutely delicious. A crunchy coating on top with soft potatoes and onions underneath. YUM.\n\nI ordered the Gail's eggs which were scrambled eggs topped with green onion and cream cheese. It came with a side of potatoes and two gigantic pieces of bread. The eggs were done perfectly and I although I had never had cream cheese on eggs before, it was delicious!! It's going to be hard to avoid cooking my eggs like that from now on! One of my friends ordered the breakfast special with 2 eggs, meat and a side of their specialty blueberry hotcakes. It falls somewhere between a crepe and a pancake. They cook a giant pancake and roll it up over a variety of fillings. It looks beautiful and tastes delicious! If it's too sweet to order for your whole meal, it's definitely worth ordering as a side for a few to split just to get a taste! My other friend ordered a daily special which was Chorizo hash served with eggs and tortillas. There was a surprising amount of meat and he was very pleased with his meal as well.\n\nThe food is great and I was happy to finally experience this Pittsburgh gem.

That way we each could get eggs, meat, pancake, and potato cravings fulfilled.  When I went without him, I would either get the breakfast special or the corned beef hash with a side of the hotcake, regular.  My favorite hotcake flavor was the banana and chocolate chip, but occasionally we would get the strawberry or blueberry - don't be afraid by the sour cream ingredient.  It tastes AMAZING, and not too rich. (any richer, with the buttery hotcakes it would be over the top and make it more like dessert than breakfast).\n\nTheir hot cocoa is probably from the package, but made decadent by the generous dollop of whipped cream that floats majestically on top.\n\nI once sat next to Franco Harris at the next table.

I give props because I tried making crepes before.. and it's really hard to get it nice and thin.\n\nI like how the seating works too because you order and then sit down.. but sometimes there's not enough seats so that's an issue, but the staff knows that and won't make your food until you have somewhere to sit so it's not like you're standing around with food and nowhere to sit.", "business_id": "cmGR1HS9ms233roSllcglw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-04-01", "type": "review"}

They'd certainly benefit from an expansion.

Welp, it was just ok. I mean I really like the crust! It was thin and crispy and flavor from the flame grill oven was great and the honey ginger dressing was good.

Comparing both, my absolute favorite was the honey glazed. It was just the right amount of sweet to not over power the salmon but give it really good flavor. It's a good thing my friends love me because I pretty much ate half their salmon....I mean to be fair I shared my pizza! But they agreed, that it was just ok but not outstanding.\n\nI'm sure that I will comeback and give them another try... If only for that honey glazed salmon!", "business_id": "hIQRiE3UsYH7UsrsDwJwLA", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-03-22", "type": "review"}

He brought extra items for the kids when they were fussy in addition to handling the adult's requests. The service overall was amazing.\n\nI started out with a simple greyhound cocktail and the juice was fresh and flavorful. I was surprised to find this ordinary drink incredibly flavorful. As visitors from the north, we tried biscuits and chicken and waffles and chicken. Both dishes were fabulous. Another member of our party ordered the pizza. I tried a piece and was impressed with the thin crispy crust balanced with tasty toppings. We even ordered a luscious piece of chocolate cake as take out to share later.\n\nThe place was bustling. So I'm glad we had a reservation. We were seated immediately--a good sign that reservations are managed well. We would have been in for a long wait without a reservation.

Tucked in a strip mall among Burger King and Papa John's, Jumpin' Java is a jewel in the Fort Mill culinary crown. Or maybe it is just a culinary tiara, because there aren't enough decent restaurants in Fort Mill to justify a crown. But I digress.\n\nI've had breakfast business meetings, coffee breaks, lunch with the girls and meals with my family (which includes two small children) there over the past seven years, and I've never been disappointed.

The pasta salad is a unique side, and the croissants are the freshest I have found in the area. \n\nYears ago, they were open for dinner and offered tapas and flights of wine. I was wildly disappointed when they abbreviated their hours to breakfast and lunch only. Their drive-thru option for coffee and call-ahead food orders almost makes up for the lack of dinner hours, though. I can't tell you how fabulous it is to call ahead, order my Warm Goat Cheese Salad, and pay for and receive it from the window without having to unload the kids from the car, take them inside, wait for the order, and then take them back out and get them loaded again. \n\nA word of warning, though. This is not fast food. Though I find the atmosphere welcoming to children with a kid's menu and high chairs, there have been times when I have waited for food for longer than I would have liked or felt necessary.  Since it is difficult to surmise when those times might be, I would not suggest dining there if your children are unable to entertain themselves at a table or if you are in a hurry.

They do fish so well but their shrimp was over breaded popcorn shrimp that did not have that country specialness that you expect from CB.  The hushpuppies were also dry and flavorless.)   I have had very good trout and also a very well done steak.   It fits into a narrow country recipe selection but when you are in the mood for that you can't beat the price and the quality of food.  Service has always been good, the environment is pleasant and there is plenty of room.  The bathrooms are very clean.  The gift shop has something for everyone.  We almost always find something and they don't particularly cater to out taste.   In the midst of country craft, bible baubles and kitchen kitch (is there such a thing?)  we have found some nice decorative items, ornaments, candy, and other gifts.\n\nFound a hair in an egg and they immediately remade the entire meal and the manager came out to speak with us.   Good and appropriate recovery.   My pancakes this time around were not as flavorful as the last.  They were still good. \nOn a cold winter day get a seat near the fireplace and have a nice home cooked meal.  The coffee has always been good too.   It isn't fancy stuff but still good.\n\nFolks here are almost always very pleasant and talkative.\n\nUpdate: The French Toast was nothing special.

My husband and I came with two other friends, with whom we seldom agree on where to eat.  I was curious about this place, but wasn't holding out extremely high hopes, since one of my dining companions is from the Middle East and has sky-high standards for Middle Eastern cuisine.  All these problems melted away, however, when we tried Sam's.  Even my Middle Eastern friend was impressed.  \n\nService is quite friendly and lightning fast, and although the menu is limited, everything is delicious!  All the entrees are very reasonably priced and include such classics as falafel, kafte, hummus, and tabbouleh (which was especially delicious!).  All the dinners come with a choice of two side dishes (hummus, Greek salad, or tabbouleh).  The baklava is the best I've ever had.  \n\nOne caveat:  They do not accept credit cards, so make sure you have cash on hand.  Not knowing this caused my husband to make an emergency ATM run, but the baklava was waiting for him when he returned, so all was well.\n\nI'm thrilled that we found this place; it is a treasure!  My friends and I will now never have to argue about where to go out to eat, and that is amazing in and of itself.", "business_id": "2UAbUSTMsR9G26A8AYO3dA", "stars": 5, "date": "2007-04-04", "type": "review"}

And Dear God, did the combination of both hit the spot! The skillet itself is not greasy, yet you feel like you are eating something substantial. The taste of the ingredients are further complemented by the hollandaise sauce, which was mixed with the two sunny-side-up eggs to perfect the combination. \n\nThe waiter/waitresses were very attentive. They constantly swung by to ensure that we have enough water as my buddies and I just chatted after we finish our meals. They were super polite and gives great insight when asked to provide recommendations of items on the menu. \n\nThe best part about this place is probably the price.

If they spent some time tweaking the dishes they have and adding that extra something many of them miss, they could become a truly top-notch restaurant for brunch.\n\nUPDATE: Went to the tapas-bar portion of RM the other night and was really pleased with the dishes.

I thought the menu items were decently priced, maybe a bit overpriced for the quantity and quality of the food.  \n\nI ordered three tapas dishes - the grilled plantains, the goat cheese, and the beef tacos.  The goat cheese was fried and served with honey and bread and it was absolutely delicious!  The plantains were pretty plain, but still a nice change of pace from what I normally eat day to day.  The beef tacos were tasty, but they were incredibly hard to eat when served in dry corn shelled tortillas.  They cracked and fell apart so it was a bit frustrating to end up having to eat a taco with a fork.  \n\nOur service was absolutely terrible, I had to flag down the host at one point to get my water glass refilled, and she brought out all of our food at different times which was a bit strange.  \n\nOverall, I was happy with the food I ordered and how it was prepared and how it tasted - were talking about Champaign, Illinois, not Chicago or New York - and unhappy with the service.  I wouldn't tell someone not to go there, because it is a unique restaurant for this area, but I would be warned that the service will likely be disappointing.", "business_id": "AB5RgQ0ZnMThdqgFS3cPuw", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-05-08", "type": "review"}

We'd had Sunday brunch and loved it at that time.  In all fairness, it started out wrong.  The employee seating us went to get us a table and was sidetracked by another employee at the entrance to the dining room and let us wait for at least 7 min. while he carried on an obvious flirtation/personal conversation with the other employee.  He finally looked away and saw us standing at the front door and that reminded him that we were still waiting.  I'm a relatively patient person but I was considering walking out at eating next door at Bacaro at that point - not because the wait was so long, but because we were so easily forgotten from the get go.  It was rude.The best I can say is that the dinner service left a lot to be desired (our waitress was tired and stressed) and the accoustics of the restaurant are such that larger tables are extremely loud, making it difficult to carry on a conversation in a normal voice.  The food was marginal at best although you have to give them points for creativity.  Wasn't a pleasant experience and my husband became very ill later that evening and lost his meal.

However, the kitchen was very clearly overextended on the graduation Saturday.

The arancini was satisfying though plain, and the shrimp skewers were well done.  The entrees were bold options that suffered only slightly from less than perfect execution and definitely warrant a return trip.  I enjoyed the pan roasted duck with goat cheese polenta and roasted beets, while my family selected their daily special (a salmon dish) or the hangar steak topped with bacon and a fried egg.  \n\nAs I mentioned, the entrees were good enough to warrant a return trip.

Here goes:\n\nMy fellow students and I had organized a fundraiser to be held at R.M. We were raffling off some of our artwork and had ordered a substantial amount of food because we were expecting 50+ guests. Around 8:30pm, there was an AWFUL stench that filled the bar area, followed by a watery mist that began to fall from the ceiling along the west wall of tables. There were a number of people sitting in this area (myself included), who were covered in this putrid water (I had to go home and shower!!!). The food we ordered which was on a nearby table, was also covered. I alerted the manager who said to me \"It must be our pipes again.\" Again? This has happened to other customers? The manager then called the fire department in to inspect the pipes running along the ceiling, while our guests (those who were left) crowded awkwardly around the bar.  \n\nThe manager took no action in remedying the situation. Our food was NOT replaced, and the water on the tables and chairs was NOT wiped up, so that the guests could resume sitting. The artwork that was hanging on the wall was also damaged by the water, and was NOT compensated for. Radio Maria had quoted us for the cost of food prior to the event, but when we received our bill, it was over twice what they had quoted. Worse yet, the manager only refunded us the cost of one cheese plate. Thanks. You're swell.  This matter is still not resolved as the owners of Radio Maria seem to think they owe us nothing. I disagree, and until we receive just compensation, I will not be returning and hope you don't either.", "business_id": "AB5RgQ0ZnMThdqgFS3cPuw", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-03-18", "type": "review"}

The torta Maria and smoked port torta are unusual and always good. Each week the brunch specials usually include a special omelette, scrambler, and a sandwich. The omelettes are only OK; somehow they seem a bit dry and overcooked.\n\nMy main complaint with brunch is the coffee. For my past several visits it's been quite weak and it's hard to get a refill. At a weekend brunch, I do expect good, hot coffee and not to go 20 minutes with my cup empty.\n\nFor dinner, I think Radio is trying to present itself as more upscale and trendy than it is. A few years ago, the menu had a much more pronounced Carribean/Cuban/South American flair to it, and I miss that. I'm sure everything on the menu is very well-prepared, but it all seems like dishes I can get at any number of places.\n\nFor my last dinner experienced there, I had a tenderloin special. It consisted of two pieces of tenderloin, one correctly medium, one well-done; six gnocchi (I counted); and a scattering of green peas. I believe the sauce mentioned in the description was absent. We did have a large party, but we were sitting at an empty table for nearly an hour before our food was ready; no salads, no bread. I guess we were expected to order cocktails and appetizers. Everything was tasty and was artistically arranged on an appropriately-trendy rectangular plate, but the portions were quite small. I shouldn't leave a restaurant after a $30 entree feeling a bit peckish.\n\nI feel like Radio can't decide what it is. A fancy drink bar? A tapas bar? A haute cuisine restaurant?

I took my family there for dinner during graduation weekend since I had just graduated from law school.\n\nI understand that graduation weekend in Chambana can be really crazy.  However, the service we got was unacceptable.  We ate dinner at a different restaurant in downtown Champaign the night earlier and did not have anywhere near the problems we had at Radio Maria.  Our water glasses were constantly empty, the waiter would go a half hour or more without stopping by our table, he would forget to do things we requested (i.e. fill our water glasses), etc.  The restaurant is also EXTREMELY noisy.\n\nGiven the prices at the restaurant, we really expected better.  Further, although most of our food was pretty good, my grandparents could not eat the hanger steak they ordered to share.  My grandparents cannot do spicy food and the steak ended up being totally caked in a pepper crust.  The bottom of the menu says items on the menu contain ingredients that are not listed, but that is in very small letters and I didn't even notice it.  Apparently, my 90+ year old grandparents didn't notice it either.  My boyfriend tried the steak and said it was pretty spicy, so it seems strange that the fact that the meal is spicy isn't on the menu.\n\nMy grandpa also got meat that was not good quality.  It was very tough and he said it was inedible.  The restaurant handled the problem graciously, however, and took the steak off the bill which we appreciated.\n\nNevertheless, it is unlikely I would go back to Radio Maria or even recommend it to other people.

It's sort of criminal that its average rating isn't higher (particularly compared to duller visits like the unremarkable Esquire's and Applebeesian Destihl).\n\nWhile there may be little in Champaign to compare to bigger-city fine dining, Radio Maria (and Bacaro, to a more intimate extent) shoot pretty satisfyingly close to the mark. Radio's selection of beer and spirits is dizzying and its bartenders have been, in my experience, charming and skilled. Their tapas menu is a little uneven, but with that topography come some nice peaks.\n\nFor sit-down dinners, there's a dining area and outside seating, both of which are quite nice.

We waited at least 10 minutes, in a moderately busy bar for a whiskey soda (don't judge us for loving whiskey. It's always 5pm on Sunday Funday). No biggie though. My steak and poached eggs were not hot when delivered to my table. No biggie though. But when one of my girlfriends ordered a salad with slide of shrimp and was brought 2 shrimp ... like what?? (Look at the picture!) In what restaurant world is this ok? $3 for 2 shrimp? They should have brought her 3 oz of shrimp (an actual serving) for whatever the cost. But 2 shrimp? Don't be petty.

Besides the lack of people I did notice how clean and organized everything was, I liked that! I spoke to the gentleman behind the counter and asked him what the most popular item was and he said the Pastrami or the beef brisket. Since the boyfriend eats anything I got him the Brisket and he offered up some fries with that. I had a hard time understanding much of what he was saying like types of bread for the sandwich or whether I wanted a pickle with the meal but no big deal. Well to put it lightly the Brisket was friggen amazing. I am a very picky eater, I cook well so it is tough for me to eat out because I know I can cook better.... but this sandwich was out of this world tasty.

I am not a fan of it in my home nor in restaurants. I can see why old people love this place. \n\nI ordered the taco salad for my lunch. What a disappointment! Almost bad iceberg lettuce, a sprinkling of all other toppings. No beans, so if you want any protein you have to pay $2.00 extra to add chicken. This salad was not worth $8.95. With a $3 iced tea and a 20% added tip to the bill, I got out of there for $14.00. I will pay $14.00 for a weekday lunch, but only if it is a nicer place with top notch service and food. \n\nYesterday I went to the Eggery again with Nico and his Grandma after church.

My husband ordered scrambled eggs with cheese, side of home fries which were very tasty, and get this- homemade apple juice which was fantastic.

Of course, the food is really greasy, but there IS a dance studio right next door...\n\nThe good: great food. Some of it can be a little 'unexpected', and may not taste as you have tried before, but I would say it's still good. My favorite is The Scottwich. It's pretty big and LOADED with meat, which I love. If I'm going to have something, I want a lot of it, not just a little sampler. The breakfast here is pretty good, as well. Now, my favorite part: the cheesecake. Holyyyyyy....yes, it is amazing. I've had a lot of cheese cake - though I would not consider myself a connoisseur - and, in my opinion, Generations' cheesecake is pretty phenomenal. \n\nI recommend sitting outside - the inside feels a little shabby, and a little stuffy. Surprisingly, I haven't come across any flies yet while eating outside. Oh - and you can smoke outside, which is just fantastic for smokers. For those who don't smoke, fortunately, there are a lot of tables outside, so you can sit far away from me. \n\nThe bad: some of the employees come across as, oh, I don't know..bitter? The average waitress there is at retirement age, which is fine, and that can be really nice: \"what would ya like sweetie?\". But the one of the waitresses at Generations doesn't seem too happy to be there - and she shows it.  That waitress, well,  you can definitely tell when she is having a bad day. I once asked for a little cup of powdered sugar and she gave me the evil eyes!! I couldn't believe it! And neither could my friends and family! But there have been times when she has been very sweet. Though you're walking on eggshells with her. If you get her, be careful not to ask for anything extra. The other employees, I'm not sure about, because we've only really gotten 'her', but I know there is a younger waitress who happens to be very nice and professional. \n\nAnyways, over all, Generations is an authentic deli, with great food (and cheesecake). And if you feel as bloated as I do after eating there, waddle on over to the dance studio next door and sign up for a Zumba class - and say hi to me. We'll talk about their fabulous cheesecake while doing some cardio.", "business_id": "PxeX1M8WtyPxX1MuuGIh-g", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-04-13", "type": "review"}

Being tucked away in newer buildings behind a starbucks, with kind of a goofy name for a lunch market, I was pretty sure this place was going to be a big disappointment.  WRONG (yay)\n\nThough a confusing layout/way of doing things, the small but impressive market of cheeses, meats, pastas, beverages, teas, coffees, sauces and little do-dads is cute cozy and inviting.  The wine room is small but good and fairly well stocked with a good variety of wines, though a measly wine by the glass selection for a fairly impressive cellar.  \n\nWorkers were a little awkward at times but really helpful in making selections.  We opted for a sandwich and a cheese platter for two, accompanied by a bottle of Reisling.  The sandwich was really good and fresh, the sun dried tomatoes were awesome - though as a sandwich in whole i've had better.  The make your own cheese platter was AWESOME-you get to choose as many cheeses as you'd like, getting the chance to look through them and read descriptions and touch, great for someone like me who loves a good cheese but knows nilch about names and pairings.  It was fresh, BIG, and simple-A in my book. \n\nThe owners son was friendly and knowledgeable, helping us select the right bottle of wine to go with our cheeses, a not easy task being I like sweeter whites while he likes dry crisp ones.  Though not the best wine i've had, we got a very good bottle for 15 bucks that was enjoyable. \n\nAs far as seating goes they have multiple areas inside and out, we very much enjoyed the front outdoor patio with sun covers, live music, grass, and the dog and children friendly atmosphere. \n\nOnly downsides I'd have to say would be the confusing layout with lack of direction, and the sometimes \"airy\" staff behind the counters.

Before my husband and I set out on our groupon redeeming adventure all over Phoenix, we decided to stop in here for lunch. This is the first time I have been in here to eat since becoming vegetarian almost a year and a half ago, and before then we used to come in all of the time. At least once a month to get some sandwiches while we were out shopping in this part of town. Today I decided would be a good day to check this place back out, as I was craving sandwiches anyways. We must have come in at an off time because it wasn't very crowded. But then again, most people don't eat lunch at 3pm. There was a musician playing out on the patio for a few guests.\n\nWe walked in and my husband and I both decided on the Where's the beef? sandwich, which was lettuce, tomato, avocado, jicama, celery, sprouts, cucumber, swiss cheese, mayo and mustard. I got mine on an onion roll and my husband decided on whole wheat. We paroozed the store while we were waiting for our sandwiches and we also purchased a large bottle of water and chips. There is also a little section inside where you can purchase teas, coffees, jams, spices, oils, kitchen tools, among other items. I can't say that I have ever bought any of these items but some of them are pretty interesting. Today I saw boxed potatoes. I don't know why but I thought it was the strangest thing ever. \n\nAnyways. So our sandwiches are ready and we pay and we sat upstairs overlooking the rest of the store. I dig into my sandwich and I really love it. I'm a sandwich slut anyways so its easy to make me happy, but there were a ton of veggies. I didn't feel like I was gipped at all. Most sandwich places will give you the flattest sandwich possible. But this one was large and in charge. I got full half way through and still ate the whole thing because of how good it tasted. I think the value for a sandwich like this is just about the same as every other sandwich shop I have had that has a vegetarian option. It was $7, which is about average. So I don't feel like I was robbed or anything. We will definitely be back soon!", "business_id": "HIiVx2mseVWKtx8TKfWC_A", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-04-30", "type": "review"}

You know, where you roll out a clean section of towel to wipe your hands?  Not paper towels, real towel.  I've never seen one anywhere else.\n\nThe area near the kitchen is filled with all sorts of weird luxury kitchen stuff; spices and dishes and expensive decorations, and other crappy junk that no one needs.  I can't decide whether it annoys me or keeps me entertained while I'm waiting for my sandwich.\n\nAt any rate, you'll get a tasty sandwich and the upstairs area is a nice quiet place to talk with your friends during a meal.

I'm so glad I finally ventured in. It's adorable!  \n\nWith copious amounts of places to sit (inside and out) it's perfect for a leisurely bite. My adventure was during a Friday happy hour. (M-F, 5-7pm. $3 drafts! $3 house wine!) Arriving early to secure an outdoor patio spot we meandered thru the space. There's live music on Fridays with a start time of ~ 6pm. \n\nTHE BASICS\nCooking accessories, teas, coffees, spices, a wide array of imported specialty foods line the shelves. Need some meat? They've got it. Want a sweet? Yep. In the mood for a sandwich? Si. Want some cheese? Be adventurous! They have adorable tiny wedges for a buck and change. \"Try something new without fear of commitment.\" Ha!\n\nThe wine / bar area, though petite in size, is lined floor to ceiling with wine bottles. Bob, the bartender on Fridays, is the friendliest gentlemen you could ever meet. The beer fridge is filled with a respectable number of bottles. \n\nSEATING\nThere's plenty of it. Two floors. My visit we were focused on nabbing seating outside near the live music. Turns out the music is fairly loud and you don't need to sit that close! You order your food inside and service your own tables here.\n\nFor noshing we nibbled on a patio cheese tray. I'm not entirely sure what cheese was served. Our platter included a small palmful of soft cheese, a jam spread, sliced bread and sliced apple. For the price point I'd actually have preferred a sandwich. But still tasty!\n\nWINE TASTINGS\nAt Duck & Decanter you can arrange a private wine & beer tasting for groups of 14-24 ppl. Lasting two hours in duration the sessions include the booze (duh!), cheese, printed info and a host. Sometimes they can include additional food. It depends on headcount and budget. ($20-$35 /person + gratuity + tax). This seems like a really neat thing to set up.\n\nTasting menu examples...The Beer Tasting has you traveling thru six different countries. The Business Mixer offers three red and three white wines. The Blind Tasting sounds awesome! Wine is served from a brown bag and it's up to guests to pick the grape. \n\nSo anyway, Duck & Decanter is a pretty neat experience!

My wife and I are attending a conference at the Arizona Biltmore. Rather than joining the group for their offsite party, we opted for a quiet dinner for two at the Biltmore's flagship restaurant. It was a disaster.\n\nWe decided to try the Taste of April - a three course meal $48 apiece with optional wine pairings for an additional $25 apiece. The asparagus soup was outstanding. The lobster pasta was awful - pasta at the bottom of the plate was a perfect al dente but most was very under cooked. Dessert came after about 20 minutes of waiting - a plate of 5 small pastries with assorted fillings. The pastries were tough and dry, and the fillings were not good.\n\nThe wine pairings were OK - but served with no insight or explanation on the vintages being poured. The first wine was poured well ahead of the soup being delivered and a refill was not offered. The second wine was poured after we were chewing our undercooked pasta. And the third came out 10 minutes before its dessert pairing. Suffice it to say we had sauvignon blanc, chardonnay, and merlot. That's all I know.\n\nSomething had to be wrong, but that is not our problem. The waiter was friendly enough, but the service was awful and the food was below subpar.

And, of course, beautiful food.  My experience at Wright's was nothing short of perfection. Starting off with the service: attentive and professional, exactly what I would expect.  I ordered the Chef's tasting menu with wine pairings; a 3-course menu that somehow turned into 5.  The amuse was poached shrimp with a smoked corn and tomato relish, it was perfectly balanced and the smokiness of the corn complemented the sweetness of the shrimp.  Next was the asparagus soup.  I love asparagus anyway, but I LOVED this soup.  Thick and creamy, with pieces of asparagus and bacon, and a nicely poached egg sitting right on top.  The egg yolk added so much richness and depth to the dish.  Following the soup was probably my favorite dish of the night: a seared duck breast on a bed of prosciutto, tangelos, and a salad of petite greens tossed in a tangelo vinaigrette.  This dish was amazing; beautifully presented and absolutely delicious.  My entree was a heaping bowl of lobster rigatoni with green onions and English peas. Everything in the dish worked; the pasta was al dente, the lobster was rich and tender, and the sauce was delicious.  Dessert was the only disappointment of the meal, albeit a small one.  A macaroon tasting plate.  It was good, just not what I would expect from a restaurant like Wright's.

After a really nice weekend with them, we thought it would be nice for him and I to cap it off by inviting them to a lovely Sunday brunch before we headed to the airport. It just so happened that Sunday coincided with Easter. I made my Sunday brunch reservations for the four of us over Opentable.com and the week before the reservation, I received a call from the restaurant asking me to confirm the reservation. They also asked for my credit card to hold the reservation.\n\nThe brunch itself was tasty and enjoyable. The service was great. But we were quick to learn upon our arrival that this was NOT the standard Sunday brunch. That for their holiday brunch, they automatically included a hot buffet, coffee, tea, and champagne for all guests. At first I thought this meant we would all have to pay $35-38 for the hot menu price.\n\nImagine our surprise when my boyfriend received the bill and it was $430 (including tax and a pre-included gratuity)! That means brunch for each of us cost over $100, which is a far cry from the advertised $35 brunch! \n\nShame on Wright's for not telling us about this beforehand. Why didn't they inform us that the buffet would be over 3 times the regular price for this holiday Sunday?\n\nWhile we enjoyed the brunch, I can't imagine we'll be back.

We took our family from New York here. The view was fabulous and the story ends pretty much there if you want to hear good reviews. The food was horrible!!! We all got something different so four people can't be wrong. The server was the worst I have ever seen. Ok so if you know you are busy why don't you update your guests instead of ignoring them knowing that you are busy and won't be able to get to them as much as you would like. Our food took two hours to get to us. I was told it was because of the huge party upstairs. Hmmm well what about the two tables that walked in 45 minutes after us. And got their food 30 mintues before us. Yes that's because their server didn't suck and forget to ring in the food. Then the manager came over and said we will comp you a bottle of wine perfect thank you. But when we tell you how long the food has taken. He argued and said it has been only a hour. And I said yes it has that's when your server remembered to type in the order so that is the time you have on the ticket that gets printed to the kitchen. The table next to us was also pissed and yelling at the server. Get it together!! Your food sucks and so does your service. Well our server any way.

It can spoil the experience when you are focused on what you paid, and not on enjoying the savory feeling of the food in your mouth.\n\nMy wife and I, at the Wrigley Mansion for my birthday, couldn't believe that this place is racking up a high average review. It was unbelievably bad. The food was marginal -- so marginal that we wondered, are we in the same restaurant that these others reviewed? And the \"deal\" that we went in with . . .  wow, what a loser. We had a Travelzoo prepaid voucher, which was supposedly worth $120. That voucher was for an appetizer, a soup or salad, and an entree. According to them, this voucher would pay for food for two that would at its normal price be valued at $120. And they base their add-on gratuity on this inflated figure, as well as the tax.\n\nWhat did we get? The appetizer was a one or two bite item -- two one-bite crab cakes, the size of quarters, and a teacup with one escargot in the bottom of it (our choices). The bowl of soup was actually a teacup as well. The entree we both had was a salmon, a very small filet, and when one of us expressed a concern about an allergy, they took the side dish away that contained the allergen and didn't replace it with anything. Most restaurants would have a baked potato or something to substitute. \n\nWe ended up paying, after they added the gratuity in and the taxes based on the inflated retail price, nearly $120 for this dinner for two that included only two drinks, a well drink with house rum and a house cabernet.  That was our \"voucher deal\" price. That's absurd . . . the Salmon dinner could be had in a larger portion in any restaurant in town for $18-24. The cup of soup perhaps $5-7 and the microscopic \"tasting\" of an appetizer would be a courtesy item or certainly no more than a few $$. How does this equate to what we paid?\n\nWhile the views are nice at the Wrigley Mansion and the place itself is unique, this operation is using it as an excuse to gouge. Don't visit this establishment -- seriously, like many others, you will regret it. Stay as far away as you can from Geordie's. Spend your money at innumerable restaurants with better value in other parts of Phoenix. (The night before we spent $50 at St. Francis and it was incredible).", "business_id": "yPfvOB63thP5t3pGZPJExA", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-05-20", "type": "review"}

My stomach turned and I couldn't imagine why they don't have somebody to clean the handrail.\n\nWe were a few minutes early for our reservation so we walked around a bit. It is an interesting OLD House with narrow hallways and a small room with an old fashioned operators switchboard. It does have beautiful views. The house has a beautiful entrance door and interesting intricate ceilings but over all it really isn't so grand with old worn carpet and common tiles. I thought I'd see a bunch of marble or granite but I didn't.\n\nWe thought this was an interesting Choice for restaurant week because we wanted to see this place. Also this was one of the few places that gave you three courses without dessert. Also the $10 non member fee was waived for restaurant week.\n\nI can't say the food was completely awful but I wouldn't come back for it either even for free so I think that qualifies for the one star rating.\n\nWe asked about cocktails and our waiter said they were the last page of the wine menu but they weren't and only lasted the liquors. He returned and my husband asked for the cocktail menu we saw outside and the waiter brings us the cocktail menu. I decided on a drink but the waiter didn't return for a long period of time so we decided to just order dinner and skip the cocktails.\n\nOur waiter said the Sous Vide Chicken was stuffed with something green and he didn't know what it was but to him it was very salty. He also said the Carpaccio wasn't very good. So we decided to go with the other two starters.\n\nThe starters were passable but nothing either of us would want again. A not so great crab cake sitting on creamy peas with two refrigerated cold roasted tomatoes. The other was a few slices of eggplant with a little cheese.\n\nThe middle plates were not so seasoned escargots with a forgettable salad. The highlight was a small chunk of gorgonzola cheese. The other middle plate was not hot and not cold but unhealthy room temperature tomato soup with a over whipped cream laced with truffle aroma. (Aroma means perfume) (and over whipped means turned to butter). We both thought the tomato soup was the best of what we tried here. It tasted like good tomatoes that would be great on a pizza.\n\nFor dinner we tried the duck and the bronzini. Both were cooked just OK but neither seemed to have good seasoning or flavor however both of our vegetables were salted too heavy. I'd say so heavy I could tell what kind of salt they used and it wasn't good salt. The one thing that I could honestly say WAS terrible was the artichoke , anise sabayon. I tasted it and nearly barffed. I am without words to describe how it tasted but the texture was like hummus. Both plates had what they called polenta towers. They looked (see photo) happy to see us and I thought mine might squirt something when I went to eat it. But I was baffled when I tasted it because it wasn't like polenta. It was like corn muffin mix that was mixed with a farina kind of cereal. It was bready and lacked much of the corn taste and really tasted like cream of wheat cereal.\n\nI can almost say forgettable but I can't because I will never forget the bird poop or the polenta tower.\n\n1.5 stars almost 2 stars but with price factored in I feel one star\n\nSLIGHT UPDATE 9-11-13\nI read that they got a new chef since my review so hopefully they are better now.", "business_id": "yPfvOB63thP5t3pGZPJExA", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-05-26", "type": "review"}

It's filled with so much charm and romance we both were simply glowing with post dinner elation. The place, Vincent's Market Bistro is the scaled down version of the fine dining classic Vincent's of Camelback. It's funny that a place like this is so well hidden without even a hint of signage beyond a sandwich board on the street. Just look for the main Vincent's sign and follow it around back to the Market Bistro entrance, they're housed in the same building. \n\nChef and owner Vincent Guerithault keeps the menu decidedly French with hints of Southwestern flare that he's so famous for. You should look this guy up; he's got some accolades including a James Beard award under his belt. Does kudos translate to good cookery, you bet!\n \nFor one of my favorites, be sure to look for the Curly Endive Salad ($9) with mustard dressing, bacon, and a poached egg. I saw it, I ordered it, I swooned over it. A well balanced ratio of salty, sweet and sour then fresh cracked pepper completes the equation. \n\nPizza offerings are done well with a tender pale crust that seemed more akin to pastry then to your typical chewy crispy offering. Tarte Flamb\u00e9e ($8) was topped with a light cream sauce, bacon, onion and thyme. Another pork laden pizza was the Caprese ($8) topped with pesto, arugula, mozzarella and prosciutto. I just wished that the greens were put on after cooking instead of before.\n\nFor dinner you'll find classics including the cooked in its own fat Crispy Duck Confit ($16) with lentils and bacon, sensing a porky theme here? The tender mallard leg was succulent and intense in flavor while the lentils performed well by countering the richness of the meat. For something a little bit lighter, I use that word loosely, order up the Coq au Vin ($10). Red wine braised chicken served atop gratin potatoes were hearty and comforting. \n\nVincent's Market Bistro also offers a $20, 3 course Prix Fixe menu. On my last visit delights were abound with the likes of creamy Butternut Squash Ravioli, Rainbow Trout and a scrumptiously sour Lemon Tart. This has to be one of the best deals in town that I know of. I mean really, food from a James Beard award winning chef at these prices is unheard of. \n\nGreat food, good prices and excellent service all set in a romantic atmosphere, well; there is one caveat, the hours. Vincent's Market Bistro closes at 8pm, so plan on eating early. We arrived around 6pm on a Saturday night and by 7pm the place was completely filled.

I don't know if we were hard to see or if its just because they were busy, but we waited at least 20 minutes before anyone came to our table. \n\nI ordered the prix fixe (butternut squash ravioli, beef brisket, and some eclaire type dessert that started with a p). My girlfriend had the pizza with bacon. \n\nI don't know if its because it is a european style restaurant or what, but every course took forever, it took us two and a half hours to have dinner.\n\nMy squash ravioli in creme sauce was amazing, but there were literally only two of them. \n\nThe croissant basket that we received was ok, they were a little burned.\n\nThe beef brisket was awful. It was soaked in some kind of sauce that reminded me of gym socks. I would not order it again. The veggies on the side were lightly cooked, very little seasoning, and very fresh, these were great.\n\nMy girlfriend said her pizza was ok, but not anything special. \n\nThe dessert is what really stole the show. I have no idea what mine was called (it started with a P and was really long, I couldn't pronounce it), but dear god it was amazing.

The staff were well trained and didn't falter even when there were a lot of demands on them from hungry customers.\nThe croisants that were served rather quickly were warm, buttery and very hard to resist.\nWe both chose the Prix Fixe dinner.  My husband had the mushroom raviolis which were served in a rich sauce and were very flavorful.  I had the caesar salad which was a little larger than I expected, but it could have used a little more dressing.  The lamb dinner consisted of four perfectly prepared chops, along with potatoes  dauphinois and snap peas.  For our dessert course I chose the Profiterole which is a tower of small, ice cream filled puff pastries.  This was good.  My husband ordered the peach tart and was somewhat disappointed.  The peaches were not as tender as they could have been.  This may have been due to re-heating the pastry.\nMy husband and several of the \"regulars\" we spoke to agreed that Vincent Market Bistro serves some of the best lamb served in the valley.\nOn our next visit, we will arrive around 5:30 instead of 6:30 to avoid the crowd.

As a way of getting more customers in the door, they are offering smaller menus consisting of more economical dishes almost as an introduction to their unique cuisine.  Binkley's now has numerous Cafe Bink locations that offer this experience and others are following suit.  Including, apparently, Vincent Guerithault.\n\nI have to give HUGE props to my date for discovering this spot that I never knew even existed until tonight.  I've been to Vincent On Camelback more than once and was a little nervous when she told me she wanted Vincent for dinner.  I know their food is good, but pretty spendy.  But before I could raise an objection she mentioned they now have a bistro offering a cheaper menu next door.  Wha?\n\nSure enough I met her here after work for dinner and as I traverse the narrow parking lot past Vincent's mothership, there's the bistro.  A small nook tucked in the middle of an already tucked away restaurant.  The bistro has a small outdoor patio with the rest of the dining area opening up to the patio.  On a perfect weather evening like tonight, its a great indoor/outdoor setup.  Altogether the bistro can seat somewhere around 25-30 people tops.  Not big, but not cramped either.  The walls, the paintings, and the music still feel like Vincent, but in a much more relaxed casual setup.\n\nThe menu offers one of three different dining options.  You can order a la carte, a $25 prix fixe menu consisting of three courses (which change everyday), or you can order from their menu of pizzas.  The pizzas seem a little out of place here since the theme is predominantly French, but I didn't order those so that's neither here nor there.  The prix fixe menu had some interesting options that evening, but there was one a la carte dish that immediately caught my attention.  Duck confit.  When done right, duck confit is amazing as I've had a ridiculously good duck confit dish at Zinc Bistro in Scottsdale.  The dish here was served with lentils and bacon.  The duck was tender and the meat fell off the bone with ease.  The savoriness of the duck and the heartiness of the bacon paired tremendously and the portion was just the right size.  Prior to the main event, we split a three cheese tarine.  Essentially a plate of three cheese bruschetta.  The bread slices weren't big, but super rich.  Paired very well with the wines we had.  We actually didn't order dessert, but we each got a chocolate brownie piece with vanilla bean ice cream on the house.  A tasty way to top off the night and oh yeah it was complimentary!  Our server was extremely polite and soft spoken and the pace of the meals were spot on.  Both of us left full, but not uncomfortably so.\n\nAll totaled, two glasses of wine, the bruschetta appetizer, a pair of main courses, two desserts, and tip was $70.  Far cheaper than Vincent's parent restaurant, while still offering the quality service, ambience, and flavors that Vincent is known for.

Their service is fantastic. It is an expensive restaurant, with the entrees in the mid thirties each, but worth every penny. I hate spending a lot of money and leaving a place underwhelmed, but I'll happily spend it at a place like this!\n\nOn the down side, this is the only restaurant this week, so far, that when I told them I wouldn't be eating dessert, they didn't sub out something else. I forgive them a bit considering of all the places, they are taking the biggest hit in terms of average revenue per table during restaurant week, but let me compare this to two years ago...\n\nTwo years ago a fourth guest spontaneously joined my table of three. Then she said she wasn't eating, she just wanted to hang out... I was a bit embarrassed by this, but said nothing. Then she started to eat off of everyone's plates! During restaurant week, that's completely unacceptable, and they could have been quite justified in charging us a plate sharing fee (which this year is $20).\n\nInstead, Vincent's showed their incredible finesse and taste. They brought her an empty plate to make her food stealing easier! Then, at dessert time, they didn't ask what we wanted, they just bought one of each of the four available desserts! They said, \"well there were four of you, so we just thought you would like one of each.\" Even though she didn't pay a dime. This was a deeply classy way to say we see what you are doing but will not stoop to your level...\n\nI left a large tip (about 33%), and have told countless people about how Vincent's is the number one date place on my list for great food and service above and beyond any I've ever seen.\n\nSo this year (my sixth time going, three during restaurant week, three regular visits), it was really disappointing that they didn't even try to be creative with me. And no, it was not busy when we were there. I almost feel like the waitress didn't even ask or something and made the call herself.  I bet a manager would have come to explain if they had made that call. The difference between two years ago was a real disappointment.  But what I did eat was of course fantastic. The lobster roll was perfect on a slightly sweet roll, the ravioli was delicious and delicate. Just what I expected.\n\nSo I am only rating them four stars for this review for their lack of empathy and creativity, and for being less amazing than they used to be. But it really is my favorite date place so maybe next year, I'll give them the star back.", "business_id": "oc0Wl6ktfMLb5VZ2Uz6M2A", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-05-24", "type": "review"}

I want to believe that, I truly do. But what happened needs to be addressed.\n\nFirst off, I've been here before. I came here with my husband, his brother, and the brothers bf. We had an absolute FABULOUS time. Our server was attentive,  kind, and charming. The food was hot and fresh, and our drinks were never empty... That was the first time.\n\nThis time could not have been more opposite. First, no one was a designated host/hostess. So, servers would come outside, ask how many people were in a party, then disappear. And this would happen more than once so now there are two or more servers looking for a table. Often for different parties, so you can imagine the confusion. When we were finally seated we were pointed to the general direction of the table and asked to sit. And sit we did for 10 minutes without water or menus. Not even a run by from the server to let us know that he will be right with us. Nada. At the 10 minute mark menus were all but thrown at us by a server. Still no communication. \n\nThen our server, Elijah I believe greeted us about 5 minutes later. He took our drink order and our brunch order, since we had more than enough time to decide, and ran off. Our drinks came 10 minutes later, along with no eye contact and a muttering of \"I'll have your croissants in a minutes\". 30 minutes later, no joke, we got our croissants. They were cold and hard as rocks on the ends and did not come with the preserves they generally come with. Then 5 minutes later came our cheese plate. And then 20 minutes after that my husband got his ham and gruyere omelet and I got a plate of something that was not my order. I had the runner take it back and continued to wait for my plate. Thankfully I only had to wait a couple additional minutes for my Ni\u00e7oise salad. Salad people. \n\nAlso, please keep in mind during that whole time, not once did the server come back. My husband had long since been out if iced tea and my mimosa glass was empty :(. We received not quite refills about 5 minutes after we received our plates. Meaning a carafe of tea was handed to my husband to serve himself and sparkling wine (half of a mimosa) was poured into my glass without a word spoken. \n\nI will conclude with this. It was busy, but I have been a server before. I know what running around like a mad person looks like and what flat out ignoring a table looks like. Our server was chatting up other tables, so he obviously wasn't too rushed, right? We left a nice tip because we are nice people, but we will not be going through that again. Sorry Vincent's, you lost not only my husband and I, but our families as well. It's too bad.", "business_id": "oc0Wl6ktfMLb5VZ2Uz6M2A", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-04-26", "type": "review"}

The plates are a modest size, so I recommend the prix fixe menu or an appetizer salad if you are starved. Before you order, the server brings you a plate of buttery homemade croissants. After every meal you are given a complimentary dessert. Frankly, if you're on a budget, you can order just a main plate (with the free croissants and dessert) and you will leave the Bistro full and satisfied with a $15 ish dent in your wallet. On the other extreme, you can have a decadent 3 or 4 course meal with a bottle of French wine and easily pay upwards of $50 a person. The food is all served on beautiful vintage Villeroy & Boch china with whimsical patterns of flowers or horses.

It helped that it wasn't at all crowded and that the weather was perfect. \n\nThe service was friendly and VERY accomidating for both of our special needs ordering. I was impressed. \n\nI went into this without reading any reviews or knowing much about the place other than that it exists and people like it. I have to be honest here - I wasn't that impressed with the food. It's a simple cafe menu, so perhaps I'm being too critical, but I just didn't love it. It was decent, but not my taste. \n\nThe food is good... I'm just not going to go out of my way to eat here. The wine was good though. Maybe they have a larger list somewhere, but the wine list I saw was pretty short - particularly for a wine cafe. Still... what we had was delicious. \n\nMy only other gripe was that it was a pretty spendy experience - even with a discount. I much prefer Kasimierz - which is probably an unfair thing to compare it to - but I do. Maybe My Florist would be more appropriate of a comparison, but I haven't been there in years.

I finally got a chance to go check it out. I'm not too much of a drinker, but the $5 Wines By The Glass Happy Hour is great, especially since they've extended it to 5 PM! \n\nIt was a leisurely early dinner, getting to Postino about 4:15, and the place was already starting to fill up! (By the time we got our food, around 4:45, it was completely packed!!!) I wanted to try the bruschetta, but my dining companion (my lovely sister) didn't want to split it (due to allergies, more on that later), and I couldn't take home leftovers, so I decided on the Select Two, going with the Autostrada Panini and Italian Picnic Salad without walnuts. I also got a glass of the Ca Del Sarto Pinot Grigio (I only drink whites). My sister had been to Postino multiple times and knew what she wanted to order, knowing it should be allergen (aka nut) free (also the Select Two, the Prosciutto with Brie Panini and Mediterranean Salad). She informed our waitress though of her condition and thankfully our waitress was very responsive. We sat and talked for about a half hour before our food came (watching the mimosas float by our table sped up the time), and I dug right in. However I was alerted to the shaky voice of my sister that she had found a nut in her salad. We called over our waitress and she was super apologetic about it, and quickly set out to resolve the issue. My sister thankfully didn't eat the nut (which turned out to be a walnut)!!! She got a new salad and sandwich and checked everything over, and everything came out a-ok. Our waitress was really great about the whole thing! My food was quite yummy! The sandwich was full of delectable salty meats, but I wished it was a tid bit warmer. The salad was top notch though! I've always avoided beets in my food endeavors, I don't know why, even though I had never tried them, but the Italian Picnic salad has opened my eyes to the glory that is the roasted beet! The different flavors and textures all blended together so nicely, especially with the crispy bacon! I wish I could have pinpointed what was in the dressing so I could recreate it at home!

Was greeted by a lovely gentleman who asked if we wanted a \"proper table,\" but since we did not, he escorted us to a loungey area and seated us at two super comfy chairs with a nice table in between.\n\nThe place itself is a former historic post office; the space itself is funky and fun, with lots of natural light coming in and wonderful music!

If for some cosmic reason you haven't made it, you really should.\n\nSometimes you just aren't ready to go straight home from work. That's when it's time to tap your local neighborhood eatery, pull up a chair and unwind.\n\nPostino Winecaf\u00e9 is one of those hangouts. Its first location opened in 2001 by the same folks subsequently responsible for La Grande Orange and LGO Pizzeria. Even if either location isn't in your 'hood, you'll quickly feel welcomed by an attractive and friendly staff.\n\nAt the Arcadia location I visited, parking is at a premium, so it's a good idea to come early or late. Checking the car into the valet (only $3) will save potential aggravation. Parking is complimentary at the Central location.\n\nAs I sat taking in the crowd and the space, I couldn't help but ponder: Should I order beer or wine? With a worldwide and world class selection, there is plenty to choose from.\n\nI was feeling like a Belgium beer, so I went for the Chimay Grand Reserve ($8). At quadruple the flavor and double the alcohol content compared to domestics, this beer has a certain yeasty earthiness that's surprisingly not heavy or thick.\n\nA small bowl of olives came to the table so I could start chowing down with my drink selection. They're smart by teasing with a small bowl because after one olive you'll want to order a full bowl ($5) with a blend of Luques, Picholines, Gaetas, Red Cerignolas, Arbequinas and Castelvetranos.\n\nSnacking and sharing is key to the menu, but if you want to compose dinner out of salads and sandwiches, that's just as easy.\n\nThe Pub Board ($10) severs up a soft, hot and steamy pretzels made from local bakery MJ Bread. Alongside are a selection of Schreiner's chorizo, cornichon pickles, aged cheddar and giant Spanish corn nuts for a major snack attack.\n\nPanini, a grilled Italian sandwich, has many varieties. On this visit the Nine Iron ($9.50) was just all right. Filled with hickory-smoked bacon and layered with grilled chicken and fresh burrata mozzarella, it sounds like a hole-in-one, but the soggy lettuce left me in the sand trap.\n\nThe salad that came along was dressed well but it was composed of too many pieces of white and bitter romain cores. After mentioning this to the server it this was quickly addressed with apologies. It's OK to share your expectations with any establishment, whether good or bad.\n\nBruschetta ($12.75), four to an order grilled bread covered with a choice of preparations, scored major kudos. It was love at first bite! My choices were Prosciutto with Figs and Mascarpone, Tomato Jam and Fresh Sheep's Milk Cheese, Albacore Tuna with Gaeta Olives and Salami with Pesto. Salty, creamy, sweet and chewy -- this was a full-on taste party!\n\nThe Salted Caramel Sundae ($5) was the grand finale. Vanilla ice cream with chocolate-covered corn nuts and a pretzel stick with a salted caramel shot was all I ever wanted.\n\nThis is food that I love to eat -- clean, simple and fresh. When paired with my favorite beer or wine, I could easily stop by on my way home from work every night.", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-03-18", "type": "review"}

The valet parking and the Range Rovers out front made me nervous for the clientele that comes here (as my boyfriend and I pull up in my Kia) but I have never had such excellent service.  In fact when we walked in we were slightly overwhelmed and didn't quite know who to talk to about a table when the hostess walks up to us and asks if we needed help and my boyfriend blurted out \"we don't know what we're doing!\" and without even smirking she said she'd take our name for our table of 4 and then come find us when one was available, in the mean time we could get a drink and wait at the cocktail tables. Not 30 seconds from when we walked over to the table another waiter walked up to us and asked if we needed a drink and showed us the drink menu. All this at 6:30pm on an already busy Friday night! About 15 minutes pass, our friends show up, we have our drinks and then a section of the bar opens up at the end that nobody else has taken so another waitress/hostess/whatever asks us \"are you a table of 4? would you like to sit here?\" We aren't fussy so we just sit and here we are the rest of the night. My friend even got a free Fish Head (Dogfish?) beer for just being right there when they accidentally poured the wrong one for another patron.

I have a friend in visiting from out of town and her parents are here also visiting family. So on Wednesday night I decided to take her to Postino, because I went to the one on Central and loved the food (hated the service, but the food was great). So I took her to this location. Much better! The place was way less busy (i guess that's because it wasn't one of their special nights) and we were seated right away. We even found parking over by LGO. Whoa. So, anyway, We shared a bruschetta board with the brie and apple, the goat cheese and bell pepper, burrata and bacon, and prosciutto and mascarpone and we each got a glass of wine. (I got the Haart riesling.... *drool* that has got to be one of the best rieslings I have had). So the bruschetta was good, I thought the goat cheese one was not all I had hoped for, but the apple and brie was wonderful and so was the burrata and bacon... I think burrata is my new favorite cheese.... that stuff is good! Anyway, it  was a nice night and everything was fine. So fast forward to the next day. I went with my friend and her parents to the botanical gardens and then we were going to get lunch, so I list a bunch of places we can go and they decide they want to go to LGO (Now I've never been there but really want to try their pizza, it looks amazing). So we get there and realize A) there is no table service and B) there is no pizza. Lame. So my friend says.... we could go back to postino..... haha! So we ended up going again! two days in a row. \n\nSo the second time we all got paninis and salads (and wine.... yum and 5$). I got the half and half with the turkey panini and the italian picnic salad. The turkey sandwich was pretty good, it had tomato, greens, pesto, and provolone on it. It tasted good, but nothing too special. The italian picnic salad was also just ok. I couldn't taste the vinaigrette that's supposed to be on it at all... maybe they forgot to put it on... or maybe it is ridiculously light. The other ingredients were good, it had beets, greens, goat cheese, walnuts, and some crispy things in it. My friend got the prosciutto sandwich, which I tried and it was delicious. Her dad got the nine iron which looked really good. Anyway, this was not as good an experience as the night before, but it evens out to four stars.

Its the perfect place for a date, and a cheap one at that, on mondays and tuesdays. or a girls night out. \n\n\nthe only complaint is the wait on mondays and tuesdays. the hostess told us it was an 80 minute wait. it only ended up being 40....wtf. haha", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-05-06", "type": "review"}

Most recently I went Tues. evening (5/10/11) at about 6 p.m.  I ordered a Bruschetta and bottle of wine.  The bruschetta came out quickly but tasted stale.

The service was ok, but again, pretty mediocre.  \n\nI hate to say it, but it seems like Postinos Arcadia might just be getting comfortable with their reputation and has stopped caring about the quality of food and service they were so well known for.  I want to acknowledge that Tues. evenings come w/ a coupon for a reduced board and bottle of wine after 8 p.m.  I was there at prime dinner hour and felt like I was treated as a customer coming only for the \"Special of the Day\".

Long-haired young guys with slightly nasal voices talked about multi-timbral effects, VCO's and VCA's, attack, sustain, decay.

Perhaps some of the current patrons were those very same dancers. Like the older guy who complimented me on my fishing vest.\n\nBut anyway, about the salad. It was good. I opted for the prosciutto as an add to the Italian salad. On the side was a good glass of tempranillo. There was a tang to it. \n\nA tang. Yes. A tang which recalled a layered gong effect combining additive and subtractive synthesis--something one might hear from say -- a Korg DW8000--which used sampled waveforms modulated through analog filters. That's exactly what the tempranillo reminded me of.\n\nWhen the waitress brought my check I realized that she looked a bit like Siouxsie Sioux, a few years on and minus the make up.

Postino regulars recommend the bruschetta and everyone seems to have a different favorite.  This is a fun food to order because you are able to choose 4 of the selections.  Fun decision to make with so many great selections!  My top two faves were 1. bacon, arugula and tomatoes (loved this combo!) and 2. warm artichoke spread (excellent!).  R + J loved the prosciutto w/figs and mascarpone.  So highlight of our night was the fun and delicious bruschetta!\nWe also shared olives (meh) and the prosciutto panini.

Parking was kiiind of a pain...not many spots to park in. They have valet parking but when you don't have a bill on you it makes valet diffifult (valet guy was nice polite and friendly). Service inside was spot on as usual. Awesome bruschetta, cheese board, and butcher block. No other issues. Great local wine bar.

I think The Cheesecake Factory has a wine list with more variety. With that being said, I did find a couple of good wines to quaff on a 97 degree day, and the service from the bartender was great.\n\nSecond, if you're going to attempt to be a quasi-Italian restaurant, play good music. The music wasn't totally offensive, but it certainly didn't match the ambiance.\n\nNow for the food. This place clearly prides itself on their bruschetta. Here are the 4 that I chose:\n\nRoasted Peppers with Goat Cheese \nSmoked Salmon with Pesto\nRicotta, Dates and Pistachios\nTraditional with Tomato, Basil and Mozzarella\n\nThe bread they use is excellent. Perfect for bruschetta. My favorite was the salmon, and the roasted pepper one was quite delicious. I even enjoyed the dates and pistachio bruschetta, but probably wouldn't order it again.\n\nTraditional brushcetta is an appetizer for which I measure any Italian restaurant. The fresh bruschetta here was way too salty, could hardly taste the fresh tomato and basil, which appeared to be fresh and of good quality. Why would you over-salt fresh brushcetta? Major fail, and one of the reasons this place is getting 3 stars instead of 4. \n\nI may come here again though, I just know not to order the fresh bruschetta.", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-05-15", "type": "review"}

Coming from the same family of restaurants as Windsor, and Federal Pizza Kitchen, the success and popularity, as well as the quality of Postino comes as no surprise!", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-05-09", "type": "review"}

The $20 for a bottle and board of bruschetta is a *steal*. As one of employee said, \"How could you not order this?\" while we waited for our table.  \n\nMy friend and I arrived early to request a table for four. Perched on a tall side table we enjoyed a full view of the restaurant. Sipping not so daintily we quickly passed the 45 minute wait.  \n\nOnce seated Bethany was a wonder. Our bill was seamlessly transferred and waters arrived. The neat thing about traveling in a pack of four is that, Yes, You Can drink three bottles of wine. What could possibly be better than that? It removes the need to think hard about the bruschetta menu. (There are 12 options so we had one of each brought out.)\n\nWe surprised the fella in the group. He doubted that three bruschetta boards would be sufficient to feed his hungry belly. If you haven't been before, a bruschetta is palm sized and sliced into four pieces. Trust me, there's plenty. \n\nBut if you're still hungry this is a wine bar and they have food. The panini selection is wonderful, I beg to argue the Nine Iron is the best.  (Bacon layered with grilled chicken, burrata mozzarella, lettuce, beefsteak tomato and dijonnaise!) Another approach, perhaps on another visit, is to order the Butchers Block (big assortment of meat and cheese) for $14 and/or the Cheese Board for $13.\n\nIf for some reason wine is not up your alley, Postino's offers pitchers of beer. If you need to drink a cocktail...suck it up kid. That's not happening here. The Mon/Tue special begins at 8pm. I'd recommend scoring a table before the start time, even if that means buying some appetizers beforehand. \n\nMake sure to ask for Bethany!

I grabbed my phone and Yelp (oh dear me) told me Taylor's was a good place for brunch.\n\nWalked in and the place was pretty much empty (it's kinda sad when IHOP is fuller than you are but that may just be a sign of the economy). The inside was nice, full of well-dressed people happily eating breakfast so the girlfriend and I snagged a couple menus and sat down. As it was a Sunday morning and I hadn't had any coffee yet I wasn't paying much attention to the menu. I ordered a spinach and goat cheese omelet, some hash browns, bacon, and coffee; the girlfriend ordered some pancakes and OJ. The coffee came (GIANT mugs which I really like) and the waiter seemed pretty cool. I was thinking all was right with the world and then.....the food came...\n\nThe omelet was not so much cooked, mostly spinach, and severely lacking on the goat cheese. The hash browns were those typical of any diner in America, except greasier and cold. The bacon? Paper-thin and miniscule. My GF's food was equally unimpressive and then...the bill came...\n\nIt was like $46 for the 2 of us!! I knew the bacon would be extra but has browns? For like $4? Really?!? $5 for OJ? It was good but, like I said before, seeing it on the bill was a bit like being gobsmacked with an orange while handing over a fiver.

The parking is not desirable especially during the lunch hour as the restaurant is sharing the lot with three restaurants and the grocery store.\n\nThe restaurant is small with few small tables, shared booth seating, and some outdoor seating. The decor is bright with exaggerated art work of Jazz performers. Apparently, the restaurant used to have some live Jazz music in the past. It is a very cute place.\n\nFor lunch, I had one of the chicken sandwiches which was good. However, I thought the options for breakfast were better. You could either choose one of the specialty omelets or build your own. I had the lox omelet which was excellent with hash browns. I was interested in the country potatoes however the waiter had mentioned that other tables had sent back the potatoes and that the hash browns would be better. Still unsure, he let us sample the country potatoes which were decent. I actually liked the country potatoes over the hash browns, I thought it was nice that the server was interested in making sure that we were satisfied. And overall, we all were. My guest ordered a build your own omelet with chorizo and another guest ordered the waffle with fresh fruit and both looked good and were highly complimented. The server was open to providing separate checks (however I am not sure that he would have been so willing if the place was packed which it wasn't). There was a random To-go iced tea delivered to our table and our check had originally not charged for our coffees but then after separation, had charged.

I don't know how many spontaneous stops I've made at AJ's for sweets in the past... Had I known about Taylor's Cafe being just next door, I'd have stopped in for organic and locally-produced foods, instead of spending money on junk!  Am so glad I took the time to drive all the way to have brekky here-- I also found this plaza to be a quaint area to walk around.  Lots of nooks and crannies that hold promise for other good eats.  Any suggestions?\n\nBefore stopping by, I briefly looked at the online menu and spotted Smoked Salmon listed.  However, upon inquiry, I was told that the salmon isn't wild-caught, so I had to bypass :(  But I wasn't disheartened much, though, since I was also hit with a major sweet craving (thanks to yesterday's viewing of \"The Best Thing I Ever Ate: Sugar Rush,\" on DVR, while on the treadmill!), so I had the French Toast , made w/ two slices of Simply Bread's monkey bread (cinnamon pull-apart), strawberries, bananas, and a triple berry compote.  I also had a side order of Boar's Head smoked bacon.  I had asked for the toast to be \"more well-done.\"  The same went for the bacon-- delicious!  [I'm crossing my fingers they weren't made w/ allergenic ingredients (I suspect they were), bec. I'd like to buy a package of this to prepare at home.]  I enjoyed every morsel of the French toast!  Loved the texture of the cinnamon-swirl bread, which I lavishly topped w/ the compote and fruit.  (I kept thinking I should ask for extra compote, but the portion was actually just right.  I would've enjoyed an extra slice of toast, though, but that's the monster in me with bigger eyes than my stomach talking!)  I also had a cup (or two!) of the special blend coffee, made by Starbucks, which I tempered its bitterness with a little 2% milk.  \n\nGreat spot for breakfast!  Can't wait to try lunch here soon.  Too bad Taylor's Cafe isn't open for dinner anymore, or I'd plan for that, as well.  BTW, service was very friendly and fast!  While my server Kristen couldn't readily address my food issues, she was quick to offer to ask kitchen staff for the answers.  And she did this with sincere smiles, which I really appreciate!  Thank you, Kristen!\n\nLovely murals; sectioned rooms that vibrate with differing, but positive, energies; polished and clean women's restroom; and nice furnishings complete my breakfast adventure this morning and make this cafe a winner!

Man, what a difference- and not in a good way.\n\nIt is unseasonably cool in Phoenix and Vincent's isn't having their brunch experience, so we decided to go back to Taylor Cafe.  There were several less than pleasant surprises.  First off, they no longer have a liquor license and thus no Mimosas or Bloody Marys.  That was a minor issue for us, but worth mentioning on a Saturday morning brunch.  I ordered a cup of coffee, some scrambled eggs with cheese for my hungry toddler, and we looked at the menu.  \n\nIt seemed to have gotten much larger and there were some new interesting items.  I loved the eggs benedict before, and ordered it again.  My husband ordered the crepes.  We anticipated our meals.\n\nMy daughter's eggs came out almost within seconds.  Shocked, I saw it wasn't just eggs, but hashbrowns and fruit.  It was also NOT warm.  That surprise was a $9 meal.\n\nWhile waiting for our meal, I drank most of my coffee.  The server asked if I'd like more coffee to heat up my cup.  He took my cup, which I though was odd, and brought it back with warm, steaming coffee.  Yay!  Upon getting the bill, I learned there was no such things as refills and I was charged for a second cup.  \n\nLastly, our food was delivered.  My eggs benedict was not warm...again!  What is with cool food?  There wasn't enough hollandaise sauce, and honestly, it just wasn't that tasty.  My husband thought his crepes were just ok- not bad, but not flavorful.  Our last surprise:  when the bill arrived and we spent $45 on at best a mediocre breakfast, we were less than pleased.\n\nThe only bright spot- our server was friendly and did his best.  \n\nWe will not go back.

Blue Saguaro is definitely a \"workers\" place - they are not open evenings and weekends and thus have no real neighborhood hangout crowd, but the atmosphere duplicates the neighborly feel admirably.

A dozen or so 2 to 4 person tables are located inside and some plastic seating outside is usually ample enough to avoid waiting for a seat. \n\nThe menu is somewhat extensive for a small place like this but nothing fancy - sandwiches and a few salads; but there are some nice selections - turkey avocado, roast beef with horseradish, and a good veggies one too. And PB&J. haven't tried that yet - maybe next week. No grilled sandwiches. They have a selection of several bagged chips, and side orders of pasta or potato salad. Fountain drinks, bottled juices and waters, and Italian sodas with or without cream. Unfortunately the dessert selection is limited to a few sad-looking plastic-wrapped cookies and cake slices. They close at 2 or 3 PM - can't remember which. \n\nMornings they open at 6:00 and the coffee is almost always hot and ready. They do an assortment of coffee drinks. Breakfast fare includes bagels, bagel/egg sandwiches, and eggs with toast, although I've never had the eggs other than in the bagel sandwich. \n\nOverall I don't recommend making a special trip to seek out Blue Saguaro, but if you are in the 16th St. and Northern area and looking for a quick and tasty breakfast or lunch in a low key non-chain spot, you'll probably enjoy it.", "business_id": "3rJE7qliy8_ylKhY5FdlIw", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-05-01", "type": "review"}

Always hated the long wait.\n\nLong Version: I usually weight my ratings more heavily on food, but in this case, the wait and whole inefficient process of ordering just makes this such a terrible experience. What is the purpose of one person taking orders but not taking payment? How about just taking orders and payment and using the extra person to prepare the food so that we can get through the line faster?\n\nAs for the bagels, the Everything Bagel is my favorite with salmon schmear on one side and light plain schmear on the other side. My office order Einstein bagels for us every Friday so I usually need to get to the kitchen early otherwise the Everything Bagel has been claimed.\n\nOn the weekends, when the line is even worse, I like to order an Egg, Turkey and Cheddar sandwich on an Everything Bagel, but instead of the Turkey Sausage that is on the menu, I ask for Breakfast Turkey, which is just regular Turkey Lunchmeat. However, if you ask for Turkey Lunchmeat, they charge you an extra $1.50, but if you ask for Breakfast Turkey, it's free of charge. It must be a difference in portions. I also add plain schmear to one side, which is important because if it's added to both sides, your fillings will just slide out and your sandwich gets messy as funk.\n\nAnyways, I was there this weekend and it took me, no exaggeration, 40 minutes from the time I ordered to when my name was called.

A couple minutes later, our fabulous waitress came by for our brunch order. We ordered the eggs Benedict, 6oz cheeseburger from their \"secret menu,\" and a turkey cheeseburger. Everything was fantastic. I was happy they asked me how I'd like my burger cooked, so it came out perfectly medium and juicy! It was simply dressed with lettuce and tomato, but I really enjoyed it. The kettle chips it was served with were so yummy; they were clearly made in-house and were so crispy and flavorful! The eggs Benedict were also fantastic. Although they could have toasted the English muffins a little more, they poached the eggs perfectly (these days, this seems harder and harder to come by).

The prices are a bit more than you would expect to spend at a place like this, but the food amount is worth it. \n\nThe waitresses go to the tables, take the order, go back behind the counter and call out the order. And it has to be done a certain way too. There is a lead and three other people cooking, each with their specific job. The lead is handling the bread and the waffle irons. The others deal with the potatoes, eggs, and meats. The basic meal is eggs, potatoes, bacon or sausage and toast. You can substitute grits for the potatoes. We ordered \"1 scrambled, grits, bacon over cooked, wheat and 1 scrambled, potatoes scattered, bacon, sourdough.\" And proceeded to watch the production continue. It was fun to see the whole thing and how quickly our food came out. No written orders were kept in front of the cooks, it was all by memory. There were a few people learning different rolls and funny to see them picking up all the nuances of the waffle house machine. \n\nThe food was good. A bit greasy, but lots of food and fast.

The orange juice was in buckets ready to be refilled. \n\nOverall, I thought it was a little creepy and disturbing in the restaurant.

The place is not open on Mondays and breakfast has limited hours during the week. There are three separate restaurant/eating areas on the farm. The lunch area is close to 32nd street with a canopy covered area and then lots of picnic tables deeper into the property. Back deep into the property there is a breakfast place, Morning Glory and the dinner restaurant, whose name eludes me right now. We dropped in for breakfast (almost missed it.)\n\nWe were able to seat ourselves and chose an umbrella covered table to stay out of the sun. The red and white checkered table cloths were very cute and very gave the whole area a homey feeling. Drinks here are serve yourself and you can just walk up and get what you like. (Try the lemonade/iced tea combo, aka. an Arnold Palmer, yummy. )\n\nThe wait staff were very nice and friendly. They asked where we were from and made a little conversation. SG got the French toast and I got a simple egg dish. The setting was gorgeous. I am not sure how it would be on a summer day in Phoenix, but March was perfect, especially with umbrellas to cover from the sun. Our food arrived fairly quickly. My dish was straight forward but good. SG's French toast was to die for. It was homemade bread, very thick and super good. \n\nThe lunch place was absolutely packed. This was a Thursday and the line was really long. Tons of mom's with little kids and people who look like they were on lunch break from work nearby. Food is served in baskets and then you can take it to your table. It seemed to be more like sandwiches and sides. I do not think there are servers, only counter service, and mostly it appeared to be cold foods. We did not get a chance to eat here. \n\nI have rated this place a 5 because the place is just such a great setting.

Servers were mulling about offering muffins and scones from large baskets as you looked over your menu.  Unlike bread at many restaurants these carbs ain't free.  we were told to help ourselves to drinks.  Nearby, there were spigotted vessels with coffee, water, lemonade, and a unsweetened flavoured iced tea.  Again, you will be charged for these later.\n\nPerusing the menu, we were torn because everything looked delicious. There were a handful of omelettes, eggs benedict, french toast, and even a french toast monte cristo.  You could also order beverages not on spigot, like fresh squeezed oj and mimosas (i think these were $7.50) from this menu.\n\nSticking with self-serve drinks, Jen ordered a South Mountain Omelette which came with rosemary roasted potatoes and an herb biscuit.  I ordered morning glory benedict minus the ham, which came with accoutrement of rosemary potatoes but no biscuit.  It seemed like our food came a few minutes after ordering it.  It was the fastest service I have ever experienced.\n\nJen's omelette had green peppers, red peppers, snap peas, tomatoes, swiss chard, and farmer's cheese ontop,  She said, \"This is the best omelette ever.\"  My eggs benedict (i'm a fan of benedicts) had perfectly poached eggs voluptuously mounting a tomato, on an english muffin bed, a dark green blanket of spinach draped over shoulders, and one of the best hollandaises ladeled ontop of it all.  It was delicious.  Also delicious was the rosemary roasted potatoes.  However, the biscuit was incredibly dry, so it was like mixing Quickrete(r) in yo mouf. (yes, i just said yo mouf)\n\nIt was very good food overall though with the eggs coming straight outta the hen house a few yards away and the veggies hailing from the equidistant farmer's market.  These fresh local ingredients make a big difference.\n\nMorning Glory Cafe would make a great place to take out of town guests, family, bedheaded lovers, or hungover friends.", "business_id": "MLcXtnpzygZvQ9BtseLLlw", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-05-04", "type": "review"}

Wow! Driving into this place you forget that you are in the desert. We arrived a little before 9am on a Sunday and were happy we did because by 9am every table was filled and people were pulling in pretty quickly. \n\nAfter we were seated the waitress said the coffee and water was self serve which I thought was pretty convenient. Everything on the menu looked delicious, so I was really torn about what to order. I ended up ordering the farm burrito and I was happy I did. The burrito was filled with scrambled eggs, tepary fried beans, cotija cheese and chorizo wrapped in a flour tortilla, it was fabulous. The burrito came with a side of home fries and just to warn everyone the portions are huge. I ended up only earring half of the burrito. My boyfriend ordered the farm omelette which is a popular item on the menu. Filled with fresh vegetables and a side of home fries let's just say he cleaned his plate. \n\nThe ambience was great and the views were fabulous. As we were leaving we noted that this will definitely be a go to place whenever we come back to Phoenix.

I had it bookmarked to try for over a year. Finally got around to doing just that on Sat, May 3rd, 2014. I guess it was a bad omen when the BBQ place I wanted to take friends was already sold out and had been before noon that day.\n\nWhile they may serve good ingredients they sure do charge a premium for them. I spent just short of $22 (yep, half sandwich, cup of soup, drink and a small dessert, $22) for lunch and that was no tip included.\n\nWhy no tip you ask? Well other then having to make the sandwich I ordered and pour the soup into the cup you have to do everything yourself including clean up after yourself. TIPS really means: To Insure Prompt Service. There is no service here. Plus they gave me the wrong sandwich. So they got 50% of my order wrong.\n\n$22 for a self service lunch with baskets and plasticware. The sandwich was good and the soup just ok. This should have been at the very most, $10 to $12. I guess you have to pay for the ambiance of dining outside. Hey, it didn't cost them a dime to erect a building, insure it, air condition it, etc. All of the other expenses which might drive the cost up to $22.\n\nAnd honestly while it was nice to dine on a rickety old splinter infested wobbly picnic table under a tree, it wasn't like it was a nicely manicured golf course like lawn. I'm not sure why all you people are so WOW about this place. I'm never going back.", "business_id": "MLcXtnpzygZvQ9BtseLLlw", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-05-06", "type": "review"}

Who knew that this place even existed in Phoenix? Well, apparently 1000 other people on this day at least. And no, that was not an exaggeration. A waitress here told me that's how many people they were planning on serving, and I believe her. There were probably 300 people while I was there at the 10AM seating, and despite the parking situation getting a little hairy, the size of this location can more than accommodate that many people comfortably. At no time did I feel crowded, and I never had to yell at the people across my table.\n\nThe food was great. Farm fresh fruits and veggies. Local sausages and meats. A cute, but somewhat misguided \"mom-lette\" bar. Fresh pastries and desserts. But what you're really coming for here is the atmosphere. The peppers turning colors, the smell of fresh sunflowers, the succulents greenhouse, the tractor your little one can climb on, the over-sized Jenga, or the 2 corn-hole courts. The large grass plots where several fathers were playing catch with their sons after their hearty meals. This place gives you some pretty good feels on mom's day. \n\nOn an average day, I would have to imagine it gives you good feels too with their patio or to-go breakfasts and lunches.

We were seated quickly enough, but that was the only plus. Our waiter gave us our menus and took our drink orders and said that once we are done deciding on what to get, to close the menus so that she would know when we were ready to order. This was not our first time to an IHOP so we all knew what we wanted and closed the menus fairly quickly. \n\nAfter around 40 minutes to a hour, we were growing restless that not even our order has been taken. I had to get up from my seat to notify the waiter that we were ready to place our order. When our waiter asked what we would like it went relatively smoothly till my friend ordered one peach crepe with the creme on the side and well done hash browns, and suddenly came a very disrespectful sigh of annoyance as the waiter wrote that down. Like it was such an inconvenience to her to place such a complex order. \n\nAfter another hour of waiting for the food to come out, we were just about to get get up and leave but the waiter said that our food will come out in just a few minutes. Now, we were sure that the food has been sitting out for a good amount of time because it was cold to the touch. We could not even bear to finish our meals so we left quickly but soon after that a couple of us started have issues with our stomach, such as from eating food that has been sitting out for quite awhile. \n\nWe got out of the restaurant at 11:30pm with such disappointment that it would have been a better choice for us just to grab food from a McDonald's. We generally give out a decent amount for a tip ranging from 20-50 percent, each, for quality service, however, it must be earned. All seven of us did not tip a single cent.

We then went back to the lobby and waited another 10 minutes to be seated in a back room to the left that looked like overflow dining and the ambiance was crap. it looked like an old shed or something that had been converted for extra seating. They handed us the menu, which was 2 one sheet laminated menus and had very limited offerings for Mother's Day. When I made the reservation I specifically asked if it was full menu and was told yes because i have 2 kids that are picky eaters and knew they would order a hamburger. no hamburger on this menu. i asked the hostess if this was the full menu and she snottily said yes, that's it. I then asked the waiter why it was so limited and he had to go ask mgmt if they were serving full menu and came back with the lunch and dinner menus. I'm guessing they weren't but accommodated us after I complained. \n\nThe food was mediocre. I ordered the cranberry pesto turkey sandwich and they literally had about 9 fries on my plate. My kids that ordered burgers had a plate full but I had 9. I literally laughed out loud. The only bright spot was our waiter who was VERY attentive. They gave us each a free muffin to take home. \n\nThen, to top it off, the next morning I went to use my debit card and realized it was missing. Tried to remember when I last used it...Mimi's. Called them and sure enough, they had it. It was then I realized that the waiter never brought my card back to me after he ran it. I remember the 2 white receipts in the billfold that I signed and no card. Yes, I should have realized it and asked about it before leaving so I take partial responsibility but they definitely dropped the ball yet again. when I walked into the restaurant to get the card, the manager checked my id and told me, \"glad you realized you forgot it. these things happen.\" No, I didn't forget it, your waiter never gave it back to me.\n\nAll in all, very disappointed in my experience on what was supposed to be a nice treat for my mom on Mother's Day. I might give Mimi's a second chance with a smaller party but i will NEVER take the chance of celebrating a special occasion there again. It really upset me that our Mother's Day was so blah.", "business_id": "NX5YHSIyesufcsI7Rg5NLg", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-05-19", "type": "review"}

I usually have 2 or 3 (if im starving) and I'm in heaven. I go here about once a week for the tacos and I am never dissapointed.

Although good, I guess they weren't spectacular enough to bring me back.  I got takeout for 6 people Sunday (this place open later than the superior Burrito Co.).  This was not a good experience, but I perhaps will give them another try some day.\n\nI arrived at the restaurant estimated ready time stated during our phone order.  They are busy.  There was just a single funnel line and I had to stand at the end behind numerous people placing their orders, rather than walk up for the phone order I expected to be ready.  Over 10 minutes later I got to the front -- order not ready and I hear a shout to the kitchen to get the phone order ready.  I pay and wait.  At least another 10 minutes pass and I am motioned back to the counter.  Looking at my notes, I see a couple of identical burrito orders and I have the foresight to ask if there are two of those in the bags.  The woman checks -- there is one.  She shouts back to the kitchen to get another one ready and apologizes.  I resume waiting.  When she calls me back she says all is ready and she threw in something else for my wait.  My destination is 5 minutes from this location.  I drive back to my wating guests.  When the food is all laid out, there is an order of 3 tacos (mine) also missing.  The beans are all cold.  I also had ordered a chile relleno with beans only.  It is good, but not enough, and it's got rice.  \n\nI'm sure everyone has had their takeout order messed up.  That's 3 strikes on the same order, though.  Since I didn't get any tacos this time, which is what seems to be the signature item here, I can't comment on those, but the chile relleno, cold beans, and taste I got of a burrito, were merely good.  Maybe I'll drop in again within the next 3 years.", "business_id": "rDvz5jX65gpfONFu7er9Tw", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-04-11", "type": "review"}

I got two fish and one shrimp with rice and beans for $6.75 plus tax and I also got a horchata. There are a couple thing I want to address. First off, the horchata was overwhelmingly sweet and grainy and this is because it is sitting in a container with spout on the bottom, so all the sugar and everything settles there and gets poured into the drink. It tasted almost like bubble gum. Easy solution, get a circulating fountain like most mexican restaurants have or even a container and ladle it out so it can be stirred, like I had in Mexico.\nOk Food, The tacos I had were really good, I just hate that they are only 3 bites each, I could eat like 10 and I'm a small girl. The street tacos in Mexico are bigger for sure. The shrimp was so tiny, like the smallest salad shrimp and there was 3 on my taco, so that just shows how small they are. The fish is good, but it is chopped up so it looks like chicken and kinda tastes like chicken and doesnt have much flavor on its own. It comes with just lettuce and pico which is fine, I would have preferred cabbage like in Mexico. I was offered one of each sauce. A spicy chipotle and a really spicy green. Both are good, the green a lil better. Rice and beans are good, nothing spectacular. I was a lil disappointed that i didn't get lime and napkins and a fork. I could have easily grabbed it myself but I was in a hurry.\nI should also mention that the first time I went, my partner did not like the bombero burrito at all because it was drenched in the chipotle sauce, so if yo don't like chipotle I wouldn't recommend it.\nAs for the place itself, it has a good ambience. The counter girl is friendly. The mural on the wall is pretty badass. No table service so expect to wait for a number to be called.\nOverall it's not a bad spot, probably the only lil mexican taco shop in Tuke. Please take my suggestions about the horchata and putting napkins, silverware and limes in the to go orders and consider upping the size of your tacos, I need more than 3 bites each!", "business_id": "rDvz5jX65gpfONFu7er9Tw", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-04-13", "type": "review"}

I've lived in the Phoenix area for 21 years and eaten at many a Mexican restaurant.  Los Taquitos uses chopped chicken rather than shredded chicken in their taco & burrito (which is A+ in my book).  Many restaurants confuse heat with flavor, but not Los Taquitos!  The seasoning on their meat is so delicious, I can't describe it appropriately.  The tacos have your choice of meat cooked with the most excellent combination of herbs & spices; plus, fresh cilantro leaves, and diced red onion.  They are served in two small (street taco size) corn tortillas.  When I eat the average taco, I like cabbage or lettuce, cheese, sour cream & salsa.  But not at Los Taquitos!  Their tacos are so simple yet so flavorful.\n\nI've been thinking about how good it was for the last week, and wondering how it would do if I used their food for a party?  The only downfall is I live about 30 min away and I'm not sure how it would be if not eaten right away.\n\nI thought the guac had too many onions.  The chips were over cooked and bland (you couldn't taste the corn flavor which is so delicious in fresh tortilla chips).  I liked the chicken burrito, I probably wont have it again just because I don't really enjoy beans, I can take them or leave them.  I did like how the burrito did not have rice in it.\n\nPrice:\nVery affordable.  I did notice that online they have prices listed and the Phoenix location is more expensive and has a little different menu options.  \n\nAmbiance: \nI've never been to the location.  My office brought food in for us on two different occasions.\n\n(I must qualify my opinion of the tacos by saying that I do not care for shredded chicken.  Typically it has no flavor of it's own and has a slimy texture.   I prefer shredded chicken over shredded beef, so I usually end up with shredded chicken dishes at the average Mexican restaurant)", "business_id": "rDvz5jX65gpfONFu7er9Tw", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-03-09", "type": "review"}

(I lived in the southwest for almost 10 years and miss the Mexican food the most.)  So since I didn't know where to go, I relied on Yelp reviews and also I saw that Guy Fieri visited this place, so though it was worth a try. \n\nThe food was good and the prices were decent for what you got, but in the end I walked away wishing my only chance to get great Mexican had been some place better.\n\nWe started off with chips and salsa.  The chips seemed like they were homemade, they were crunchy and warm.  The salsa was great. I could've eaten more than the little cup they provided.  Also I am not used to having to pay for salsa and chips at Mexican restaurants so that was a little off putting. But for $2.50...salsa was good.\n\nWe then had a couple of margaritas (regular and prickly pear).  I am not a fan of regular margarita's so I thought that one was okay.  But mine was delicious.  Prickly Pear was another thing you don't see much of on the East Coast, so delighted to have it.  And it tasted great, would have ordered more if I wasn't driving.\n\nFor dinner I ordered the Burrito Bombero and my boyfriend ordered the 3 chicken enchiladas.  The burrito was good, and if you like spice, and I mean a lot of spice, then you might love it.  I am a spicy food fanatic, but this was just a bit too much.  I felt like I couldn't enjoy any of the other tastes of the burrito because my mouth was burning too much.  I think if they took the spice down just a tad, it would have been a lot better.  My boyfriend thought his enchiladas were a bit salty.  Not very impressed.  I thought they were just okay as well.  I have definitely had better.\n\nWe probably should have gone with the (street) tacos since that seems to be where all the great reviews come from.  If I lived in Phoenix I would give it another chance.

With Mexican food being one of my favorite types of ethnic eats I knew while in the area I would definitely have to give this place a try and I'm glad I did.\n\nSituated in a safe and standard strip mall sits this spectacular site sure to satisfy your stomach. I walked in to see some very nice art of what appeared to be Santa Muerte or some other skeletons on the wall and placed my order. Per a recommendation from a co-worker I ordered the \"bombero pollo\".  Once my order was ready it was time to head back to my office and consume this.\n\nThe bombero pollo was a chicken burrito with some hot sauce and cheese on the outside, I also got beans and rice with it. To start with the entree the hot sauce on the outside really gives this a lot of its flavor. It's fairly hot and I was warned ahead of time, but I'm no chicken, I merely eat chickens, on a burrito. The chicken and other ingridients were good, a little watery. Overall I was very impressed with the bombero pollo as the hot sauce was a great compliment.\n\nThe rice and beans left a little to be desired. These tasted worse than the ones I get at my local Mexican restaurant in suburban Chicago. I'm willing to take a stab in the dark and guess they were frozen and thawed out due to the somewhat bunchy and odd consistency of bean dip. That's not to say they were bad, just not ideal or on par with what I've had other places.\n\nOverall, I really liked the Bombero Pollo, the hot sauce gives it a fantastic flavor.

The amount of egg whites in my burrito equaled the amount of about 4-5 eggs.  I placed my order via phone about 15 minutes before closing, so possibly they didn't have any beans left but this was not okay.  It was disgusting in flavor and texture.

I work in a huge call center and will make sure that nobody I know goes there so yea probably not going to be using that 20% off coupon. What I want is my $11 bucks back for this unseasoned pile of beans, rice, and chicken.

Only 6 orders (both to-go and diners) received their orders before me, so it wasn't like there was a long line waiting for food ahead of us. There were also 8 people behind the counter, 3 taking orders and 5 making the orders, but the people making the orders seemed to run into each other, and kept making orders and then realizing the order was already filled, and then throwing away the food.\n\nThis used to be a quick spot to grab a bite to eat during lunch and get a semi-healthy option for our toddler, but definitely no longer.

The restaurants are always clean, the service prompt and friendly and the bagels (I almost always get a tasty turkey on a toasted everything bagel).\n\nYesterday, I dropped into this location hungry & ready for my usual.  The restaurant was PACKED, no biggie, I've seen this before, these guys are bagel slingin pros and will make short work of this line....\n\nSo, I step up to the order counter, look into the case & notice they're running low on some varieties but have what I'm looking for.  I order and make my way to the register.  This is where I notice they're set up kinda backwards.  You enter the queue on the left of the store, order and move to the right to pay.  The cashier is next to the restroom and drink machines (a dead end) but then you have to go BACK int the queue where people are ordering to GET your food... Not an issue if the store isn't busy but when all tables are occupied and there's a line to the door, it's kind of a mess.\n\nEvery minute or so, an name is called and a bagel lover gets his/her breakfast, everything's in order then right, well.... About every second name called seemed to result in the patron approaching the counter to get his/her order only to be told they'd run out of their bagel choice and would have to choose another.  After 15 minutes waiting for MY name to be called, the moment came and I stepped up to the counter and was told they didn't have any everything bagels and I would have to choose something else.  My response, you had plenty when I ordered, the response \"well, we're out now and people are waiting behind you so hurry up and pick something else.\"  This kinda pissed me off so I looked at the case and said I'll have a garlic bagel, \"if you have any left when you make my sandwich.\" Yes, I was snarky but so was the bagel maker.  The blonde girl next to him seemed offended that I would have anything to say about the goings on and stopped making sandwiches to make sarcastic comments to the guy who was making my bagel.  \n\nAnyway, 5min later I got my order and we headed home.  I opened my bag and inside was NOT a garlic bagel, it was NOT toasted but it WAS an okay onion bagel.  \n\nMaybe I'm overreacting but I don't feel like making bagels is THAT difficult nor do I think it's too much to crank up bagel production when you're slammed on a Saturday (5-11-13) morning....", "business_id": "IYWTOj970XqG2z9Xft_8SA", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-05-23", "type": "review"}

It was closed, bummer. Right next door was Denny's, I never even noticed there was one there before. \n\nOK HUNGARY ... \"I'm going in\".\n\nFirst off this is classiest looking Denny's I've ever been in. (Not that I frequent them) Extra large photos of Phoenix cira 1970's greet you as you walk in. Nice. Relaxed lighting, colors, and seating, HDTV's. \n\nDouble Nice ... as was my late night hostess.\n\nI ordered a classic single burger, fries, and an ice water keeping with my original thought. Wow, what arrived at the table 10 minutes later was a total surprise. A large gourmet angus burger on a fantastic looking bun, all the fix-in's on the side, and perfectly cooked fry's.\n\nWith a totally surprised look on my face, the waitress asked if everything was OK?  I told her I must be dreaming because everything is too perfect. No Denny's I have ever been in looked this nice, nor serves food like this. \n\nI decided to go along with facade ... and sure enough the taste was as good as the illusion. I woofed it all down in minutes, paid with a $10 bill, which included a $2 tip and tipped right out the door.  \n\nOnly when I hopped in my \"beat up\" 2001 Diesel Beetle did I realize this might actually be real.

As we walked in through the tightly enclosed doors there was a line of old people waiting on the side and the front line girl called us to the front of the line.  Kiley got water and I got a soda.  The price came out to about $17.00 for the two of us.  We walked through the totally what seemed to be unorganized restaurant where the only thing that seemed right was there was food on the left and tables, mostly dirty tables, on the right.  \nWe found a table in a quieter section as we passed through a storm of kids that I wondered why they weren't in school as it was a Monday at noon.  We sat down and kinda soaked in the atmosphere for about five minutes thinking the server would come up but after about seven minutes I told Kiley to go ahead and get some food first.  She got mashed potatoes, part of a baked potato, carrots, a corn dog, and some chili.  She said the chili was good and the mashed potatoes were real mashed potatoes, but the carrots were plain and she did not finish the corn dog.  \nI got a salad, which had been sitting for a while,  BBQ chicken which was pretty good, carrots which I to thought were plain, pasta which I really enjoyed, rice and eggs which I didn't care for, and a chicken noodle soup which could've used some seasoning.  The server finally approached not even asking if we've been here or telling us his name and walked away before I could ask him a question.  There were no napkins on the table so I had to get up and find them.  Overall I guess I would say it was pretty good for a buffet but there was a very small selection and the salad bar had a ceaser salad and that's about it.  A lady approached our table and asked if we wanted to try some crab jalapeno peppers and I took one.  I wish they would've had them on the food bar because I could've had like ten of them.  None of the food on the bar went empty so I would say the cooks did a great job.  Most the hot food was hot except the fish.  Overall I was a little disappointed.  Would I go again?

He ordered a skillet. It didn't come out in a skillet and it was more like a stew than a skillet. It was so wet and disgusting. I hadn't gotten to her before they ordered so she had the french toast as well and it was just a bland for her.

As I was waiting for my bill the waitress asked if I wanted a sample of their bread pudding. Wow! so of course I did even though I was doubling over with fullness. It was so crazy good, the bottom had like cinnamon crispies almost what comes on top of muffins w/ the crunchy sugary topping, and it just made it magical.

Thank you, Luana.\n\nWe looked over the menu for a few minutes, it didn't really take us long to figure out what we wanted. My daughter got the kids pancakes, and my wife and I each ordered the Healthy Scram.  For the so called \"kids\" portion of pancakes, my daughter received three full grown pancakes. Of course, she couldn't finish them. If she had, I imagine she would have been in a coma for the next two days.\n\nAs for my wife's and my meal...absolutely delicious. We each opted to have two extra egg whites scrambled in with our orders. Essentially, it ends up being an oversized egg white omelette. Couple that with a cup of fresh fruit and a dry English muffin, and you've got yourself an amazingly healthy and filling breakfast/brunch/dinner... whenever you decide to eat it, I assure you, it will be delicious.\n\nThe three of us ended up spending about $40 for our meals.

Very open with 50 tables and decorated in a Tuscan theme.  The tablecloths are a tacky plastic that reminds me of my grandmother's house when I was little.  Kids menu is priced well at $5 and they offer Kraft macaroni and cheese to my kids delight.  Here's what we ordered:\n\nCalifornia eggs Benedict - Eggs were cooked perfectly and the hollandaise had a light lemon flavor that I look for.  I'm not sure why the hollandaise was so lightly flavored, perhaps theres an opportunity for more butter here.  :)  It was a good light dish but not good enough for me to seek this restaurant out.\n\nKids menu French toast is the same as cinnamon swirl French toast.  The kids enjoyed the french toast, but it wasn't anything special to me.  It was simply french toast with some cinnamon like everybody does at home.  It was good but that's about it.\n\nTurkey Melt -  This took the show at our table for brunch.  The bread had a perfect crunch, the cheese was melted perfectly.  My only knock on this dish is that it's so heavy, but that's what a melt is!  This is a perfectly executed sandwich.  I suggest pairing it with a salad to balance your meal out.  Good stuff!\n\nAll in all, Crackers & Co Cafe is a good option for breakfast.  I strongly recommend coming here if you are nearby, but I wouldn't drive out of my way to go here.  Well executed kitchen, just lacks pizazz in the food.", "business_id": "2nzUx_M8Szyzsf4CszHasw", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-03-30", "type": "review"}

I had found Moon-pies that I hadn't seen since I was in grade school, when my Mom use to throw them into my Superman Lunch Box and it would be one of the high points of my luncheon meal!\n\nWhen you are done browsing the gift shop, the welcome station is in the back, with someone ready to escort you and your party to your table.  Again, the motif' is Country Home Style, and they even have the pyramid peg games at each table for passing time and laughs with your company.  Be ready to take your cholesterol pills because this place doesn't hold back on the fatty substances and such, but the food is good for what it is...Breakfast (round the clock), Lunch or Dinner...\nMe, I was there for the grits and eggs in the middle of the afternoon---lol.....Just had an inkling for it.\nThe service is adequate, the atmosphere fun, the pace is kick-back, and the prices are moderate.\nI give it three stars for the bad sausage patties I got that made me have diarrhea for four days straight!

I demand not only good quality, but good value.\n\nI placed an order for a carnitas burrito with rice added (for $1 extra).  I wanted it like they do in SoCal -- rice, meat and beans.  I also ordered a tamale, which I normally do when I visit a new Mexican food restaurant to gauge their quality.  If they make excellent tamales, that's a sign that they care about quality.  Well, the good news is that the tamale tasted great -- very authentic, the bad news is that it was tiny... maybe 4 oz. at best?  They give you this huge takeout box, which lends to the disappointment when you open it to discover a half-anemic tamale.  The carnitas burrito with rice?  What rice?  In fact, I want to know what happened to the burrito -- it was the size of something I would find at Taco Bell.  Mind you, this was a $5.50 burrito, and for that much I wanted more than a small Taco-Bell-style burrito (that I can get for $2.00).  So no only was the burrito tiny, but it was missing the extra rice.  Overall, for the $7.50 I paid I was very disappointed.  Not worth the money.\n\nI sensed  an order error might happen when I heard the cashier call-out the order to the cook.  When ANY restaurant uses the word-of-mouth system to place orders in the kitchen, there is a huge possibility for error (as happened in my case).  This is unacceptable and their order system should be changed to a computerized system.\n\nPros:  authentic taste, fast friendly service, fresh home-made tamales\n\nCons:  Small, anemic servings, poor order taking, slow cleaning of tables", "business_id": "qgJZUKNVY-LbGKk6XEP3JA", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-03-23", "type": "review"}

In the case of Mucho Taco I quickly overlooked it due to location, location, location. Good thing my little girl is as adamant as I am when it comes to satisfying whats on the taste buds. I did a quick Yelp review look up and was pleasantly surprised by the overall reviews for this joint. Well, I'm not afraid of broadening my horizons. This place has a quaint old town Mexico feel to it. They even have Telemundo on the tele. What really caught my attention is the fact that this place was clean, not a dirty table in the joint. That can really set the mood and so far I'm smiling. \n\nWalked up and the girl working the counter was all smiles and quite frankly had the best attitude/customer service I've seen in a long time. You've got to take a moment to recognize and appreciate such things when you see it.\n\nLucky for me today's especial was a 2 taco plate with rice & beans. Just what my daughter loves. I gave her my American child's request for this and that added and removed and she accommodated with no fuss. Then it was time for the General to make an off the menu request. I wanted a chimichanga but I was feeling chorizo so how about combining the 2. No problemo here! The girl picked up the menu and explained with a picture how they make their chimmi's enchilada style and asked if that would be ok. Absolutely! Paid, the girl and found me a nice place to rest my dogs. A couple seconds after getting situated the young lady brought out chips and salsa. Now being a connoisseur of all things food I was up for the salsa challenge. Gotta say- this salsa is good! Thick, not runny & it had a pleasant little kick to it. Too bad food was ready so quickly because I wanted to beat down another helping. Taco's looked delicious and their was plenty of rice & beans, my little girl's order was perfect. Im regretting not posting a pic of my chimmi masterpiece. Presentation was wonderful! A good sized chimmi laid smothered in cheese and surrounded in red sauce. Could have used a little more sour cream & guac but I know this stuff is so rare around AZ that restaurants share it sparingly. now I'm being sarcastic! But all in all the flavor was delish! \n\nI'm so glad I have a Mexican restaurant to add to my list of happiness.

They have special menus for light meals and are willing to modify any meal for you.  They have a wide selection to please most everyone.  I have siblings that are on special diets because of digestive problems and Mimi's is one place that they can go to and not worry about how they will feel afterward.\nThey are also a chain so when we are traveling we know we will get the same food there as well.  Portions are huge and can easily be split between two adults if not starving.  You can call ahead and put your name on the waiting list.  Weekend mornings are pretty busy.  All of the decor changes from room to room.  My children love the room with all of the instruments and play \"I spy\".\n\nCon's- Really cannot think of any.\n\nMy family can eat at a sit down place for under $20 with tip included.  That to me is a great deal!", "business_id": "-6Roo-EHgSdUa4rP3tWyRw", "stars": 5, "date": "2007-05-17", "type": "review"}

Without batting an eye, our waitress quickly took away the wrong dish and brought the right one, with an extra loaf of that sweet, dark bread coated in oatmeal.  Fast forward again to Chandler, AZ. where we live now.  We have ordered almost everthing on the dinner menu, and ALWAYS been satisfied with the taste, texture, and amount (always take some home).

Why??? Because you deceive your customers.  I am sure other restaurants do too and when I recognize the deception I am no longer a customer.  Good EGG has been (NOTICE: I said has been) one of my favorite places to have breakfast with family or friends. NO MORE!!!  WHY Because you are serving Corn Syrup with a hint of ([probably fake) Clover instead of the HONEY I asked for.  OF Course, I understand over 50% of the Honey Bees have been killed by Monsanto Pesticides and Herbicides. Therefore, there is a Honey Shortage.  BUT that doesn't give you the 'right' to deceive your customers.  If the waitress said, My apology, we don't serve Honey because it is too expensive.  Or we serve Honey with an uncharge of 20 cents, I could live with that. Blatantly serving me FAKE Honey is NOT OK.  Got it???  I won't be back until I am notified YOU have ceased to serve FAKE Honey.", "business_id": "oSDf6BHiMlKGZdFFmIo6NQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-03-11", "type": "review"}

The food and table service was great. The experience began to change with the front of house when I went to pay. I noticed I was being charged for the full \"traditional\" breakfast (eggs, breakfast meat, potatoes, toast), when I requested no potatoes. Yes, i was asked if I'd like to substitute fruit for the potatoes, but I declined. Just wanted eggs, bacon and toast. The front of house politely offered to take off 1.50 from the bill, which was nice, and appropriate. \n\nI paid with card, had left a tip on the table in cash, and proceeded out the door, when I overheard this front of house woman exclaim \"what an unfriendly and unpleasant man\" to the customer waiting after me. It made me stop in my tracks. And I turned around and started walking back to the restaurant. She headed me off outside at the front door and instead of apologizing when I asked her why she declaimed to the customer after me her thoughts about me, she began interrogating me about why I didn't want potatoes.  When I asked if she was the manager, she said no. And when I asked to speak to the manager, she stated there was no manager on site. I admit, the situation went further south from here when she continued to lie that she had said nothing about me to the other customer, so I just walked away.\n\nWhen calling the restaurant a few minutes later to speak with a manager, she picked up the phone and stated she was the manager!  \n\nHumans are strange creatures, and this particular one even more so.", "business_id": "oSDf6BHiMlKGZdFFmIo6NQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-05-18", "type": "review"}
