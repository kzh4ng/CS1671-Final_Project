Growing up in the Seattle area, it was one of those fun places that we always went for birthdays or just special nights out. It was a real treat to go to the original location and when I turned 21, my girlfriends and I found ourselves sitting out on the Seattle waterfront far too often.\n\nFast forward to 2013...when did this place get so freaking expensive?! I'm not sure why I am surprised, but I am. Just like every other mediocre chain restaurant, prices go up, service and quality go down. I'm left with serious eating remorse and I'm kicking myself for dropping $45 on a meal last night that could have been spent in one of our far superior local establishments.\n\nI have been getting the Bleu Ribbon Burger since it was introduced to the menu years ago, but last night I didn't feel like spending $10.79 on one burger so I went with the Patty Melt. It was good enough, and I was pleased. I do love the Red Robin fries and I'm a sucker for their honey mustard. I finished my basket of food and I was actually pretty full. Maybe I didn't need that big burger after all.\n\nMy husband had the Veggie Burger. Kids had the Pizza and the Mac and Cheese. No complaints.\n\nOur waitress was nice and fairly attentive. It wasn't busy and we were seated right away. Drinks took longer than usual to come out but that's because our waitress dropped my husband's beer. No big deal, accidents happen. I had a good view of the kitchen and watched one worker stand around and play on his phone for a good chunk of time we were there. (Employees on their cell phones while working really irks me). We were seated under the air conditioning so it was really cold. (Someone once told me that keeping a restaurant really cold was a way to move people out quicker. Not sure if that's what they were going for, but it's always on my radar now.)\n\nI'd like to say that I have learned my lesson, but I'm sure I will be back because my memories of the past always seem to win.", "business_id": "-GYx5GAx_-4XEsn7mFwdkA", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-05-17", "type": "review"}

First off, you cannot beat shelled peanuts that you are allowed to throw on the floor...I've always thought that was very cool.  The food has changed over the years, but they still do some pretty great bar and grill grub.  Their shoestring fries with hot cheese is to die for.  So are their wings, onion rings, fried zucchini, soft baked pretzels, and Chicken Jack (Not Jill) sandwiches. The atmosphere has changed over the years, as well as the service and attitude.  It's kind of hit or miss now.  You might get both great food and service, but it's a 50-50 shot that the service or food might be sub par.

Unfortunately we live about 20 miles away so we can't get there often, but when we do, we always order the same thing!  Oh, don't you hate people like that?  It's just that the dish is so good, I just crave it!  \n\nMy husband always orders a hamburger.  This is not your ordinary hamburger, this is the best that money can buy.  Fresh quality beef, cooked medium well, on a homemade, soft and chewy roll.  \n\nThe roll is more like a sub roll than a hamburger roll and they make their hamburgers oblong.  To add to that you've got to get the fresh french fries.  Nothing frozen here.  The hamburger is so flavorful it melts in your mouth.\n\nBut I think my meal is best.  I order the half sandwich and salad.  I am in love with Flancer's \"We Must Meat, I Ain't Lion\" sandwich.  It's grilled Filet Mignon, medium rare, topped with Gorgonzola cheese, chipotle mayonnaise & caramelized onions.  Mmmm.  Add to that a small Greek salad with Balsamic vinaigrette and it's a perfect meal.  Wait,. it's even more perfect if you add Flancer's famous creme brulee for desert!\n\nFlancer's is a fantastic place.  The servers treat us like family, the atmosphere is cozy and comfortable, and the food rocks.  Don't wait in line for the yucky stuff.  Go to a local chef-owned restaurant like Flancer's.
