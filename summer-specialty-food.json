Hot Sausage, Sweet Sausage, Meatballs etc.   There are frozen food items available too - pasta, sauce, meatballs etc. There is also a shelf in the store stocked with sausage buns, sauce and other items.  I often stop after work to grab dinner because they are open until 6:00.    Specials:  Pazzo Monday: any sandwich or  1/2 sausage roll with a soft drink is $5.99.  Tuesday/Thursday: Mac and Cheese with ground hot sausage $2.75 per serving.   Friday: Sherrys Pasta e'Fagoli $3.75 per serving Wednesday/Saturday: (MY FAVORITE SPECIAL):  Homemade Lasagna - made with homemade sauce, Tallutos lasagna pasta, grande and lamagna cheese and ricci ground hot sausage $4.25 per serving.  I must tell you that the lasagna is my favorite menu item at Ricci and anytime I get it .. when I eat it.. I get into a \"zone\". And I don't ever share.. yes it's THAT good.\n\nI love to make my own spaghetti sauce using Ricci Italian Sausage.  I have tried using other types of sausages - like giant eagle brand but you can always tell when its \"Ricci's Sausage\" because it's a good batch of sauce and everyone raves about it.    \n\n\nmangia mangia", "business_id": "9tAbTDdYTASHL7EU1e-OWw", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-06-25", "type": "review"}

It pleased me like no other sandwich has ever done. I want to compliment every sandwich maker in that department, specifically Bethany, Eric, and Rick. They know when I walk in their direction from the Fresh Pack section that I'm looking for my second option of the BLT because the burrito isn't available. No matter how bananas and certifiably insane I might seem during my food shopping excursions, they always treat me with such dignity and respect.\n\nMonths have passed since my first BLT experience, and I was completely taken for another ride through satisfaction land during this past week when they offered to notify me \"the night before when the vegan tofu burritos are being made\" because they know how much I have my heart set on that beautiful meal on most days of the week.

Everything you would need to stock your fridge and pantry plus lots of more exotic options too. Much of the produce comes in conventionally farmed and organic options so pay attention to the labels and signs if you're aiming for all organic. It is more expensive to shop here than most grocery stores but you really do get what you pay for. \nThe bulk section has lots of nuts, seeds, beans and grains.\nThe meat counter looks pretty great with some grass fed and organic options (a bit out of my price range for every day eating but its good to know its there for a special occasion). Their seafood counter is passable (that being said, I worked at Wholey's fish market for a while so I have really high standards when it comes to seafood. Not that Wholeys fish always meets my standards, but I'm used to huge variety and at least a few incredibly fresh options). Much of the seafood is previously frozen because it's out of season or exorbitantly expensive when fresh. I honestly can't believe people who shop at whole foods have any interest in irresponsibly farmed fish like tilapia and Chilean Atlantic salmon but they carry it nonetheless. \nStaff are friendly but can't always answer what you might think is a simple question. As in the bulk foods guy probably knows everything about the bulk foods but literally has no clue where you can find horseradish.\nSalad bar and hot foods are good and seam fresh. The sushi is passable if you're really in the mood for quick sushi.

It's the best place to buy spices because they're sold in bulk, and if you want to try something new or only need a little for a recipe, you don't have to buy a whole bottle. There is an entire aisle of spices, spice blends and dried herbs, so there is a lot to choose from. It's also great to buy a little at a time because you can make sure your spices are always fresh.

East End carries all of the ingredients that I need with multiple options. They have recently redone their store (and are still renovating) and have expanded their meat (they didn't use to carry meat at all) and cheese selections tremendously. The meat is a little pricey, actually the whole store is little pricey, but in my opinion it is well worth it. It's nice knowing that the items are organic and come from sustainable farms. Bonus: they buy as much locally produced items as they can as well. \n\nI really have nothing bad to say about them. The service has always been great and I love the selections and products offered. I can't comment on the cafe as I haven't eaten at it, but I hear the food is great. A combination of East End and the Strip has pretty much replaced Giant Eagle for me.

My husband on the other hand, LOVED every single one of them! We also went there for some Rustic Italian or any hard shelled bread. I know this is not the store's fault be there needs to be a sign that says, \"Do NOT touch the actual bread unless you are buying it!!!\" I saw at least 3 people who were squeezing the bread with their dirty hands to see if it was soft.

You do have to buy a minimum weight of any type of cheese, however, I believe it's 1/4 of a pound, which is the perfect amount to keep around for snacking I have found. The customer service, even without \"Dear Heart\" is still stellar, and they have always let me sample anything I wanted to try before buying. What else goes perfectly with cheese? No, not crackers (IMO) but olives! They have buckets and buckets of bulk olives you can choose from-stuffed olives and plain. They have a bread section with Breadworks items and several vats of olive oil so you can buy a large amount. There is a small section stocked with fresh produce in the back near the registers. They have a whole section, as well, dedicated to all types of spices-the smells are intoxicating!

However, many times, some portion of the slice is stale (who knows how long the cake has been sitting there). Their deli products, salads, etc., are not bad, but again, certainly not better than what can be purchased elsewhere for less. I guess I just expect quality comensurate with cost, and certainly don't see much evidence of it here.

However my coworker raved about it and swore us two ladies would love it, so we went. \n\nI absolutely LOVED it. It is a gorgeous environment, all loaded with (admittedly overpriced) specialty food items, gourmet bakery delights, candies, cheeses, a hot food bar, a luscious salad bar - and wine. LOTS of wine. If you're a oenophile (I am not; my two companions are), then you will likely be as delighted about the wine selection as they were. I had one of their weighted salads (I selected grilled chilled shrimp, goat cheese, artichokes, sundried tomatoes - a few of my favorite things!), and it came to about $11. I thought it was insanely delicious, and for those kinds of toppings not unreasonable at all (I've bought those things separately at a regular grocery for  similar salads at-home and the cost is gargantuan). I absolutely loved their salad selection.\n\nMy companions enjoyed their sandwiches immensely (and cracked open a bottle of vino as well to enjoy). My wretched diet prevented me from sinking into one of those lovely single-serve desserts on display - but damn I was tempted.\n\nWe returned the next day for wine happy hour with the rest of the office. The wine room was packed and weren't able to accommodate our party of seven. However, a super-nice young waiter (I want to say his name was Ahmad - he had a faux hawk and lovely manners) was more than solicitous, helping us pull together several tables and chairs, and timely popping around to serve us impeccably. (My knowledge of wine and how it should be served is nonexistent, so I can't wax eloquence about it. However, I was at a table of PASSIONATE wine lovers and they raved about the two reds ordered and didn't make a peep about service so I'm guessing it had to have been very good). \n\nI'm not a wine drinker myself, so I sipped on a yummy diet cream soda (never seen the brand in a Kroger or Target myself - even the diet soda seemed exotic and fancy), and nibbled with restrained gluttony on the delicious cheese plates (rich, creamy, pungent, salty, fragrant cheese with names I can't pronounce). Prices were on the higher end, but the service and atmosphere were just so serenely luxurious that I can even forgive D&D for not carrying my top wine selection (a $5.99 bottle of Barefoot Moscato). \n\nOverall, I loved D&D. I heard that we used to have one in Cincinnati, and I'd be quite happy if they ever thought to return back to the Queen City. Probably better for my budget that they don't though...", "business_id": "hODaBUYzv0AbApej_bfZ-w", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-06-17", "type": "review"}

We needed breakfast, which I was going to pick up, and lunch, which needed to be delivered.  Going through the options and pricing, she made this a very easy process.  She was excellent with communication and everything was on time, well presented, and surprisingly at a comparable prices to other restaurants.  \n\nThe boxes lunches were ooh'ed and aah'ed over, in particular the club sandwich which was huge.  I had the ham and brie sandwich, which was served on a pretzel roll, with the potato salad.  All was above average, but nothing that was amazing.  The cookies were fresh and good (and again, well priced for catering).  \n\nThe breakfast (the Continental) though, left a lot to be desired - it was 90% croissants with only a couple of muffins and some sort of airy breakfast cookie (it tasted like a croissant cookie).   No danish, bagels or scones, which were what was listed on the catering menu.  It came with a fruit bowl and some OJ, which were both good, but for $120 (to serve 8-12), I expected more than a wicker tray filled with croissants.  The coffee also got high marks.\n\nOverall, it was a positive experience.  Caitlin made the process easy, the food that was served was of good quality and fresh.  Delivery was on time and professional.  The price was typical of business lunch cost.

Old Time'll do your 80/20 Chuck for your burgers, they'll do your bone-in ribeyes, they'll give you a pork butt, or shoulder!  I mean.. whatever.  For such reasonable prices, it's a wonder everyone doesn't shop there.\n\nOh wait, they do! =D  You can tell just by the parking lot.  There are two lots that sort of bump up to the front and side easements, but these lots are pretty small (like 7-12 cars per, I'd guess).  There are times you actually have to wait for a space to open up so you can park and run in.  And it's not unusual for someone to be all cattywampus in a space or NINE (I'm looking at you, SUVs =P), so!

The carne asada (a little overcooked) was pretty good and delicious in a flavorful marinade, and the shrimp taco was really good - a much better choice I would add.  Paired with some tamarind, strawberry agua fresca or horchata and you'll be in heaven.\n\nI find the bakery to be the highlight regarding the food.  The pandulce was excellent - if a bit more fresh (than Ranch Market) given the way it's stored behind a glass case rather than self-service.  The conchas and pineapple empanadas were soft, sweet and delicious - with perfect texture.  Everything from churros, to cakes, to flan, to sweet breads, to donuts and rolls.", "business_id": "apCfJVnRyaw6oVUBKujpUQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-06-11", "type": "review"}

We tried an apple empanada, a banana cream empanada, a stuffed churro and a coconut macaroon.\n\nI did not like the empanadas and I think Gary would agree. They were boring and flavorless.  The stuffed churro rocked!  Gary only let me have a few bites, so I want to go back for more.  The coconut macaroon was awesome!

Keep in mind it's still pretty good, but there are better places in the area for getting your Mexican on food wise.  The potato taco is worth getting because it's fairly unique, but it came out so soggy that I had to eat it with a fork.  I grabbed a couple of the Yelp-Advertised taquitos as well - keep in mind these are not the Circle K, rolling taquitos.

The staff is friendly and remembered me the 2nd time I ever came in, and every time since.  The ambiance and decor is fun and the food - oh the food is amazing!  I have brought several people here who doubted my claim of \"best in Phoenix\" and they all left agreeing with me.\n\nI confess that I tend to stick to a few favorites and always over-order, but it's all so tasty!  Their super nachos are much more \"super\" if you put carne asada on them instead of the standard ground beef.  I had never had elotes con todos (corn with everything) before coming here, but somehow, steamed corn on a stick with mayo, chili powder and cheese is a winning combination. Who knew?  There is no way to eat this corn daintily but it's so good that I don't care.  I can floss later.\n\nThe carne asada or carnitas soft tacos are consistently high quality but the real reason I pilgrimage here from clear across town is the fish tacos.  The mahi mahi is perfectly seasoned and flaky, with homemade tartar sauce and queso fresco.  I personally skip the rice and beans because they do use lard in the beans and that doesn't always sit well with me.  The salsa verde from the always well stocked salsa bar is noteworthy and good on nearly everything and just a few drops of habanero salsa on my fish taco is enough for great flavor and a little kick without totally setting my insides on fire. If you like ceviche, try the tostada de ceviche - a great little value for the price - shrimp, avocado, onion, tomato and lime for under $3?  I couldn't make it for that cheap!\n\nThe latest development at La Tolteca is the construction of an outdoor BBQ grill just outside the entrance closest to the parking lot. Perhaps this will reduce smokiness inside from the somewhat poorly ventilated indoor grill.  That would be great.\n\nBefore you leave, be sure to pick up some churros and a fruit empanada or two, or even some arroz con leche (rice pudding) at the panaderia (bakery). Even if you (like me) ordered too much and don't have any room left for sweets, they're just as good as a late-night snack once you get home.", "business_id": "apCfJVnRyaw6oVUBKujpUQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-06-22", "type": "review"}

The tripe taco was fantastic - great texture and flavor - and I'd come back just for that.  I'm not sure I'd do the same for the carne asada, which was good but not as flavorful as it could be, cabeza, which was similarly less flavorful than I'd hoped and more reliant on texture for its kudos, and the fish taco, which was buried in sauce and otherwise not worth mentioning.  The tortillas are a little dense and also a little lacking in the flavor department - again, there's better to be found in the Valley (and, despite La Tolteca's extremely reasonable prices, for cheaper).  \n\nThe chilaquiles, however, are a dish to behold.  A giant platter of still crispy but sauce-laden tortilla chips, egg, meat, queso, avocado, sour cream, onion, and cilantro - it's full of flavor, heavy on texture, well-balanced on spice and hearty as all hell.

They NEVER responded,  and now I can no longer, in good conscience,  shop there because of their apathy.\n\n\"I'm writing, because I had an experience at your store that I just can't stop thinking about. I visited last Sunday, Oct. 30th- close to closing time. As I was checking out, the cashier (a younger man- he looked like he might be of Latino decent) was incredibly polite and professional. However, I had a very negative/offensive experience with another employee of your store that appeared to have just finished her shift and was waiting in line behind me to make a purchase (she was a middle aged woman, with dyed blond hair and heavy eye make-up). As my friend and I were making our purchase, we briefly chatted with the kind cashier. I, in error, went to the wrong place to check out. Your cashier made a friendly comment about how at Costco they have arrows to guide people and that it was an easy mistake for me to go to the wrong spot. It was just friendly rapport. I suppose he was trying to ease my mind in case I felt embarrassed, which I appreciated the gesture. \n\nAnyhow, while he was talking with my friend and myself, the woman interrupts and starts loudly saying to the cashier helping us, and I am QUOTING her, \"Not MY Costco, you live with 'needy' people! You go to the 'needy' people Costco. My Costco is beautiful because there aren't any 'needy' people there. I live in a different city than YOU. I don't live amongst 'needy' people. We're not needy where I live like YOUR city\". \n\nSadly, I am not exaggerating this in anyway. I was completely appalled by the lack of  basic manners. \n\nThis woman is completely unprofessional. Regardless of her personal feelings towards wherever the young man lives or her delusional superiority over \"needy\" people... laughable, since she is working at a grocery store but that's beside the point. I can not believe she would have the audacity to speak to this young man in this manner in front of CUSTOMERS. \n\nDespite her rude, insensitive and unprofessional comments, the young man remained gracious and kind and never said and unkind word or even gave an unkind glance while this woman was attempting to belittle and humiliate him in front of customers. She is lucky that I was too shocked by her behavior to say something at the time, because I am and was completely disgusted. This has left a lasting impression, a negative one to say the least, and I certainly hope that you have a talk with this woman about basic manners and conduct- even if I wasn't present- her behavior is basically harassment and no person should have to deal with such ignorance and insensitivity.\"", "business_id": "Mng1FUcW-xRSdsDkowQm2Q", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-07-04", "type": "review"}

The cashier was having a hard time getting the e-mail address from the customer in line in front of me, who had a VERY thick accent.  I couldn't understand the lady, either.  The cashier was very nice and professional about it, but did need to woman to repeat herself a few times.  The manager, who was standing nearby intervened and was very snotty with the cashier.  She said to the cashier, \"You need to wear your hearing aids whether you like it or not!\"  I was so appalled that she would say that in front of the woman's customers and coworkers.  Apparently this manager has never heard of the ADA!\n\nSo the cashier finishes helping the lady with the accent and it is my turn in line.  A coworker of hers gives her a piece of paper with a note from the manager.  I see her open the note, and I can see that it says, \"wear your hearing aids!\" and I see the cashier's face completely drop.  \n\nI checked out and left the store, got all the way back to my car, but didn't feel right not saying anything about this older woman being humiliated at work. So I walked back in and asked a cashier if I could have a phone number or e-mail address to contact the district manager or corporate. She said she would have to go to the back to get that information, and when she came back, she said, \"My manager said we can't give you that information.  She'll have to take your name and phone number and call you.\" I said, \"That's okay, I'll go online and get that information.  What is your store number?\" and of course I later found that they gave me the WRONG store number.\n\nAlso, all corporate businesses like this has a line customers can call about concerns.  This manager was seriously trying to cover her butt.\n\nSo I called another Williams Sonoma store in Phoenix, spoke to the manager there, and got the corporate telephone number.\n\nThere are other ways to discuss the cashier's disability with her, in private, and come to a solution.  The manager could find out what is going on and see if there are any ways to accommodate the employee, whether that be stocking or inventory where her difficulties with hearing won't be an issue.

(where I grew up) experience about Mexican culture and food into one exciting, colorful, and interesting shopping experience. Growing up, my dad often took me and my sister to local taco stands and Mexican juice places (where they made fresh horchata, agua fresca, smoothies, and juices). We also often made a point to stop at the little street carts where Mexican men would serve up freshly sliced mango, pineapple, and papaya, coat them in lime juice and chili salt, and then pass them on to us for mere pennies. These stands, holes in the wall bursting with locals, and street carts were all part of how I experienced Mexican food growing up, and I absolutely love how Ranch Market re-creates this experience in the context of a full-service market. \n\nWhen you walk in to the market, we were immediately wowed by all of the colorful decor - streamers, pinatas, signage - and by the very varied selection of meats at the butcher counter. If you are interested, you can get a full-on cow's head for only $29.99! We turned the corner and realized that not only was there aisle upon aisle of dry and canned goods, but that the entire perimeter of the inside of the market was lined with little specialized stands where you could go to buy certain types of items to take home *and* try something right then and there - just like the taco stands and carts of my youth! As an example, you can walk up to the seafood counter and purchase octopus to take home and make a ceviche with, but you can also buy some fresh seafood tacos to eat as you shop! There were similar counters for the dairy, fruit drinks/horchatas, breads/pastries, and desserts categories. \n\nPerhaps even more exciting - there is a full eatery/cafeteria right inside the market that serves affordable and delicious Mexican fare. We ordered some assorted tacos, a carne asada quesadilla, and a drink, and it was only $9 or so for everything. The carnitas and chicken were decent, but the tortillas were warm and fresh, and the carne asada was out of this world. I usually find carne asada to be a bit tough and under-seasoned, but here it was tender but still chewy and rich with flavor. \n\nWe didn't actually do any grocery shopping, but we want to go back at some point soon (maybe at lunchtime) and buy some stuff to take home while sampling some goods from the different specialized stands. Some things that caught my eye to buy or try:\n\n*Pre-seasoned steak fajitas from the butcher\n*Seafood tacos from the seafood counter\n*Fresh fruit yogurt from the dairy area\n*Cuban sandwich from the eatery\n*Fresh-squeezed carrot juice from the juice stand\n*Rice pudding from the dessert counter\n\n...and many more!

He told me that they had a great selection of dates and figs (my favorite appetizers to make are bacon-wrapped dates and figs with blue cheese, but I always have a hard time finding them, especially figs), so I went back the other day to see their selection for myself. \n\nThe woman working greeted me with a smile, asked if I needed help, and offered me a sample of fresh watermelon (it was so juicy and sweet!). I told her I was looking for figs - unfortunately, they didn't have any fresh black ones, but they had some bagged white ones which I haven't been able to find at Fry's or Fresh & Easy. The price was pretty high ($4.50), but I didn't mind, since I knew they would be really fresh and that I would be supporting a family-run business and local growers. Plus, I already had the blue cheese and wanted to make my appetizer! \n\nThe only drawback of my experience was the $1.00 transaction fee they charged for paying with debit card. They had a little disclaimer up about being a family-run establishment, and I do understand that the economy's bad, but the fee is really high, even compared to mom-and-pop restaurants in the area.

Anyone who says otherwise either came on an off day or a super busy time.\n\n2. The prices are incredible. Some of the prices may be comparable to grocery stores, but never higher AND a lot of the prices are MUCH lower. \n\n3. It is a small local business. I love that I get to support this business and they are providing my family the best quality products they can. Grocery stores don't do that.\n\n4. After I shop there, I feel happy.

It had eggs, and some delicious asiago cheese and black forest ham on some crusty artisanal bread.  Ahh.  It was missing the bechamel sauce, but it made up for it with freshly-grown asparagus.  How did they know that's my favorite veggie?  I attribute it to kismet, of course.  It was accompanied by some terrific oven roasted potatoes baked in some spices and oil.  Nice...\n\nThe patio is cute in a rustic way.  Think checker tablecloths and white plastic chairs.  Not exactly sexy, but hey, it fits in the grand scheme of the farm.  They have a self serve area for water, lemonade and tea.  \n\nThe mimosas here are the best part.  For only $7.50 you get your own mini champagne bottle and orange juice.  So you're getting the better end of the bargain with about a mimosa and a half! \n\nService here was a bit slow to start.  But after paying the check I spot a wandering blueberry scone that is calling my name.  (Even better, is their scones are featured in Cooking Light magazine too.  Man I love this place.) So I give in, place an order and ask for it to go.  She brings it out.  I ask to pay in cash, since she already ran my debit card, and she says \"Don't worry about it.\"  \n\nCLASSY.  Classy, with a C.  The scone was DELICIOUS, btw.  Nice touch, and I leave her an extra tip for it. \n\nPrices are higher than average for Phoenix.  Expect to throw down about $40 for two.

Being from the northeast and him from the Midwest, we feel starved for green grass, deciduous trees and rustic, wooden fences. The Farm really delivers those wonderful feelings of reconnecting with nature and socializing in an outdoor setting that doesn't feature poured concrete flower beds and overly watered tropical plants. \n\nFor wedding reception/ceremony: We used Mike Kennedy, the nondenominational officiant The Farm recommended for our ceremony, he was excellent. The staff at the Farm as well as Santa Barbara Catering (You must use them to be married here) were outstanding! Our guests said it was the best food they have ever eaten at a wedding, which is a huge compliment. We choose the grove (under the white tent in the pecan grove) for our reception (they have a few other locations to pick from depending on location on the property) and our ceremony was under the large wooden, vine covered arbor - perfection! As wedding prices go, it was definitely reasonable - no idea why the world thinks that in order to have a lovely wedding you need to drop oodles of loot - the Farm is a great option for nature lovers, people missing trees, grass etc, great food, amazing service and a memorable location for their wedding (it was actually less expensive than 90% of the hotel/buffet options out there)\n\nFood: there are three dining options at The Farm, Quiescence (fancy, high end dining) Morning Glory Cafe (breakfast/brunch), The Farm Kitchen - (lunch) I could write a novel here, but overall: the food is a little expensive (lunch is usually $10-$15/person with drinks or if you want desert tack on an additional $3-5 bucks) but it is very good, plus you get the great ambiance of dining under trees on a picnic table or in their little courtyard area. If it's busy prepare to wait awhile to order  and get your food (self serve, you gotta pick it up at the window when they call your number)\n\n For breakfast/brunch at Morning Glory expect similar pricing, but this is located towards the back of the property in a cozy little brick patio area - simple waiter service.", "business_id": "MLcXtnpzygZvQ9BtseLLlw", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-06-24", "type": "review"}

It was a lovely experience (from the environment to the service - having asked for my \"any style\" eggs to be hard boiled.  They didnt bat an eye at the request.) and I wanted to come back for Mother's Day with my family.   \n\nMother's Day - It's crowded.  I mean like WAY over 1+ hour wait for MG, crowded.  But that's understandable.  It was Mother's Day afterall.  If you want to come here for an event like the Mother's Day Brunch, reservations ARE required.  If you miss out on reservations for brunch, and decide to go to MG, go early!  \n\nWe decided to skip MG and were going to eat at The Farm Kitchen, but we ended up having to leave because Little C ended up having a major asthma attack.  We had used the valet service for parking, which offering valet on a busy day like Mother's Day is great.  BUT only if the service is organized.  We hustle back to the valet stand and I had over the ticket.  I look at the valet stand and there are key piled up everywhere.  No organization whatsoever.  They're digging for my keys, meanwhile Little C has just puked all over me for a 3rd time.  2 minutes go by and J and I ask them a couple times if they could please hurry and find our keys.  They find our keys and one kid runs off.  Next thing I know, the head guy (I'm guessing he was the guy in charge over valet), turns to us and says in a snarky manner...\"I'm SORRY your child is having issues.\"  \n\nUmm...excuse me?!  \n\nThank gawd they found the keys and got our vehicle up in a flash or else I would have had to not only call 911 for Little C's breathing, but for my putting my foot up that guys ass.   \n\nI think if we decide to come back, (which I'd like to go back because the atmosphere, service, and food at MG was great) we will self park across the street.", "business_id": "MLcXtnpzygZvQ9BtseLLlw", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-06-30", "type": "review"}

Keep in mind, this is a very small store, and it is very hard NOT to notice that a customer is in the shop.  \n\nAfter about 10 - 15 minutes of looking, I had grabbed a few items (I had about $50 worth of items in hand and was going to buy) when a really nice woman with a brown pony tail finally came to me and asked me if she could do anything to help.  \n\nI asked her if she had any Yarrow essential oil and she said 'Yes we do' and proceeded to reach to get the bottle of Yarrow.  But then a blonde woman with short wavy hair looked at the woman helping me and said, 'No we are out of Yarrow'.  I looked at the bottle of Yarrow and it would have easily filled a 5/8DRAM bottle...which is listed on Desert sage's website for $22 dollars.  This would have been more than enough for me.  The woman assisting me began to say that it looked like they had some, but the blonde woman said, \"No, we can order some, just to let you know that it is INSANELY expensive'   \n\nOn Desert Sage's website, 5/8 dram of Yarrow is $22...a 1 Dram bottle is $36...this is not 'insanely expensive'....  \n\nhttp://www.desertsageherbs.com/Desert_Sage_Herbs/Essential_Oils_files/EO%27s%20Price%20List%20May%202015.pdf\n\nI looked at the her and said, 'It's ok, I'll just order it from Ananda' and then she paused and said, 'If you're not paying a lot for the Yarrow, then it is probably not good.'\n\nFirst of all, I know that Desert Sage Herbs gets a lot of their oils from Mountain Rose Herbs....and like I said, 1/8th of an oz of Yarrow is about $38 dollars (at the time of this review)...I was expecting to pay this (and more for mark up from Desert Sage Herbs....but they didn't want to sell me what they had).  \n\nI really didn't care about the price because I needed the oil....and I knew how much to expect to pay.   I could have ordered this oil online, and I was willing to pay rush shipping to get my oil in quickly.....  \n\nHad the lady behind the counter have been nice to me, maybe ASK me why I needed the Yarrow and if they were really out of Yarrow (when I saw that they did) then maybe she could have recommend another oil for what I needed and I would have understood.  \n\nThe lazy customer service, snooty, and condescending tone of this lady gave me was a turn off.  I put everything I had in my hands back and left.  I will never step foot inside this place again.\n\nCan you imagine how frustrating it is to drive 80 miles round trip for nothing?  Can you imagine driving over an hour in traffic down the 101....to be spoken down to in a condescending manner and told that they are out of something when they are not?  And then implying that the oil was just too 'insanely expensive' (exact words)....when their own website lists the price as $22 for a 5/8DRAM?  I have expensive oils in my collection including Neroli, Rose, and Tuberose....I do not buy oils based on price, but I buy them based on their therapeutic and energetic benefits.   \n\nI was ready to spend a pretty penny at Desert Sage Herbs, but after the rude and snotty customer service I experienced, I put all my items back and left.  I had about $50 dollars of times in hand and was planning on spending over $200 in loose herbs, flower essences, and other oils....ready to grab more items.....   I refuse to support lousy customer service with my hard earned money.....\n\nI am now convinced that the best place to buy oils ATM is Mountain Rose Herbs and/or Ananda apothecary....I am even open to trying Floracopeia to get the oils I need. \n\nI will not be returning to Desert Sage Herbs again.  Here is a list of online essential oil and herb suppliers you can compare shop with\n\nhttp://MountainRoseHerbs.com  (where desert sage herbs gets a lot of their herbs)\nhttp://www.anandaapothecary.com/  \nhttp://www.floracopeia.com/\nhttp://elizabethvanburen.com", "business_id": "Ym256yx44Fpdeqe0NwfWsQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-06-12", "type": "review"}

I just wait until an hour - ish before closing time and everything is fairly quiet and sometimes they're putting out veggies for the next day. WOO HOO! Forget the early bird, I'm a night owl.\n\nAs for the \"weird smell\" as one yelper described, I ignore it. Truth is, I'm used to it and I know it's the same smell of any asian market, hell even parts of Chinatown in San Francisco. I've smelled worse things while traveling the world. Lee Lee's your typical Asian market (shout out to 99 Ranch in the Bay Area!), but better organized than other markets I've been to. The aisles are clearly marked - Chinese, Indian, etc. If you can't navigate it, then how you navigate the roads here makes me wonder if you should be driving at all.\n\nSince I'm hard pressed to find inexpensive Filipino food here in the valley, I find I have to make it myself. Lee Lee's carries all the stuff that I need to try (really, it's try, but never accomplish) and replicate my mom's dishes.\n\nIt's also really nostalgic for me as well when I go down the cookie/candy aisle and see things like the Strawberry Pocky sticks or the chocolate Pocky sticks...It reminds me of going to Japantown in San Jose on Sundays after church so mom could get the ingredients for her menus of the week. But what really makes Lee Lee a winner in my eyes is the desserts from Goldilocks Bakery as well as their assortment of breads.\n\nI'm a total starch slut, so seeing Pan de Sal and the Filipino desserts makes me happy. I buy a few things and then put them in the fridge so I can munch on them during the week.\n\nI also love their frozen food section as well - you can find such a variety of frozen potstickers, Indian food, sea food...it's a wonder one even thinks of going anywhere else.\n\nI like Lee Lee's a lot and their selection of fresh fruits and vegetables is one of the better places in the valley...unless you support your local farmers.\n\nService can be rude, but I don't expect hearts, flowers and puppies in places like this.

Seriously, my boyfriend has to herd me around, lest I spend 45 minutes choosing frozen Indian breads. (Paratha? Naan? Batura? Roti? Garlic, onion or plain?) Or trying to justify purchasing five pounds of lamb. Or considering the merits of roast duck. \n\nAnyway, before I get sidetracked again, let's start where I always do -- the booze aisle. Lee Lee carries a wide variety of Asian beers, of course, plus some good sakes and plum wines. But there's always at least one too-good-to-be-true booze selection. Yesterday it was a half case of Widmer Hefeweizen for $6.88. I've also purchased Konig Ludwig Bavarian weissbier for $2.99 a six-pack, Carlsberg Elephant beer for $9.99 a case, Warsteiner mini-kegs for $7.99 and countless other delights at \"fell off a truck somewhere\" prices. \n\nIf that's not enough to get you to brave Lee Lee's jacked-up parking lot and hordes of chattering families of all ethnicities (united only by an uncanny ability to get in your way), consider this: Lee Lee is also home to aisles of non-Asian delights, like Jamaican jerk sauce and Mexican spices. And of course, my favorite -- the lovingly labeled \"Holland foods\" section. I don't .know why it's there, but  I do know that pickled herring is fucking delicious.\n\nBy the time I leave, my cart invariably looks like the shopping list for a dinner party at the United Nations.\n\nA very drunken dinner party.", "business_id": "5KG0A3WlC7K3DAXtrIFFjg", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-08-31", "type": "review"}

It is rather big, roughly the size a larger grocery store.

As a vegetarian I can't fairly describe the seafood and butcher section, but I can it's large and inclusive, from catfish to pig uterus. Beyond that there are aisles dedicated to Korea, Japan, Thailand, the Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia, Brazil/Caribbean, India, the Middle East, ramen noodles, dried noodles, imported liquor, hefty bags of rice and more. \n\nLee Lee can be a fun place, but it's largely practical. I find that I can get about two weeks' worth of groceries on one trip. However, I always have to go to my local grocer to get some odds and ends Lee Lee doesn't carry, like bagels, cheese and a few other minor things. Other than that I come out with a large amount of groceries for a reasonable price. Don't let the cultural barrier dissuade you. It's a great place to get nori maki arare, Japanese candies, Thai chilies, chicory coffee, tahini, instant Indian meals, crates of ramen, frozen samosas, chutneys, wasabi, incense, and much, much more, right down to bizarre eats: sake in juice boxes, cheese and corn ice cream, grass jelly, silkworm pupae, canned crickets and unnameable horrors from all corners of the globe.\n\nWith that in mind, remember the HSBC marketing campaign of cultural perspectives: delicious in one, disgusting in the other, etc. Give it a shot, try something new while also finding old favorites.", "business_id": "5KG0A3WlC7K3DAXtrIFFjg", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-06-12", "type": "review"}

I always felt it was missing something.  I couldn't put my finger on it.  Was it the lack of meat and seafood?  Yes it was.\n\nLee Lee's is everything I have been looking for in a supermarket.  A produce, meat and seafood section that goes beyond my wildest dreams.  I could have spent a few hours in the store but I was on a time schedule.  \n\nYou know how the back of a market usually covers liquor, meat, seafood and dairy?  Not this place.  It covers meat and seafood and that's it.  it's huge!  They had live tanks with cheap lobster, talipa, catfish, crabs and some fish I have never seen.  Then there is a fish station with every fish I've ever heard of and maybe 20 others.  They'll chop it up for you or fry it free of charge.  The meat section has any cut of meat you could imagine.  Bellies, feet and legs included.  I didn't even know you could buy pork blood by the pound.\n\nThe produce is out of this world.  Veggies I have never seen.  Peaches the size of my head.... and every kind of choy you can think of.  Best part, all of it was the same price of Sunflower, if not cheaper.  \n\nThe aisles are incredible as well.  A whole aisle dedicated to noodles!!  An African aisle!?!!?   Two Korean aisles.  I couldn't believe what I was seeing.
