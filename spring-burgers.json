I decided to explore the McKees Rocks neighborhood and came upon Marge's Place.  I hadn't heard much about this place, but after reading the few reviews I could find, I decided to give it a try.  \n\nInside, it's bigger than I expected but still has that down home diner feel.  My guess is that most of the people there were regulars.  The wait staff was friendly to those they knew but also welcoming to me, someone they had never seen before.  I picked a table in the corner so I could observe what I imagine was a typical Sunday morning.  I ordered the breakfast special: 2 scrambled eggs with bacon, potatoes and toast.  Any place that has Mancini's Italian toast already gets thumbs up in my book.  Being in McKees Rocks, though, they really don't have a choice.  The potatoes were thin sliced with onions and very flavorful.  The only way I can think of to describe the bacon is...porkier.  Is that even a word?  I just don't know how else to descibe it.  The combination of foods was served in generous portions at a great price (under $5).  \n\nOne random note: I liked the tables and chairs.  They were comfortable not just for sitting and enjoying a cup of coffee with my morning paper but also very comfortable for sitting and eating.  Good distance between the table and chairs.  That may sound silly, and I thought so, too, at first.  But when I go to a place and the booth is too wide or too narrow, it can hinder my enjoyment.  \n\nNot only will I return, but I will also recommend Marge's Place to anyone in the area.

How nostalgic you are.\n\nWe were the proud owners of a gift card to Applebee's (Christmas gift!) and the best part of this gift was my boyfriend's reaction to me later.  He has never been to an Applebee's.  Or an Olive Garden.  Or a Chili's.  His first time at a Red Lobster was with me when we were stuck in a strip mall hell for the night.  So he's new to these restaurants, which so many of us grew up with.  I'd only been to an Applebee's a handful of times, but I was down to go back - it seems like they sort of have everything, no matter what you're hungry for.\n\nSince we're spending all our time now packing to move back to Chicago (WOOHOO!), we don't always have time to make dinner.  So we busted out the Applebee's gift card and journeyed to Edgewood Towne Center for some chain restaurant foods.  \n\nWhen we arrived, this server really awkwardly asked us to sit at the bar.  I missed the finer points of the interaction, since he was talking to my boyfriend, but he basically insinuated that he'd just sat some large tables, or something, and it was his turn to have a table in his section but he didn't have the time to serve us, or something, and he didn't want us to wait (for what, I'm not sure) so he was basically like \"Can you sit at the bar?\"  Which was weird because there were like, at least a dozen open tables.   But whatevs.  The cool kids sit at the bar, and we are the cool kids.\n\nChuck, the bartender, was running this show.  Dude.  He was on top of everything.  Taking orders, serving drinks, answering phones, getting takeout orders, keeping his bar neat and tidy - he was HOPPING!  We were both in awe just watching him.  That man is earning his tips, for reals.  So I'd recommend sitting at the bar if Chuck is working.  He's also cute, so bonus there.  The Applebee's bar is kind of a hilarious place - random people having drinks as if it's a real bar and not a restaurant, this one lady READING A BOOK WITH A GLASS OF WINE like it was some fancy cafe, some annoying fratty people....and us.  A healthy mix.\n\nI had a Shock Top and my boyfriend had a Sam Adams - mad props for Shock Top on draft, not expecting that from Applebee's.  We ordered spinach and artichoke dip, which I believe was half price (as are all apps) during happy hour.  It was served with regular tortilla chips (like from a bag) but the dip itself was pretty tasty.  It was served in a really wide but shallow crock, and tasted appropriately spinachy and cheesy.  It was served very hot and was pretty satisfying!\n\nMy side salad arrived shortly thereafter, and it was amusingly huge for a side.  Iceberg lettuce, cherry tomatoes, crispy croutons, shredded cheese, tangy bottled Italian dressing on the side.  I bought it to balance out my entree, but somehow these iceberg lettuce salads never really feel healthy, you know? Like eating crispy water.  With cheese and croutons.  YAY HEALTH!\n\nThen came the entrees - I got an order of wings (which I think is technically listed as an appetizer) with \"Sweet and Spicy Sauce\" which was listed as the second-hottest sauce on the menu.  They were pretty decent - served hot, juicy chicken, and the sauce was sweet and sticky.  It was a little *too* sweet for me - picture gloopy Chinese takeout in sweet sticky sauce, and that's what the wing sauce was like - but it still made a satisfying meal.  My boyfriend got one of their \"special burgers\" from their new New Orleans menu -something like a Bourbon Bacon burger.  They asked him \"pink or no pink\" which we thought was funny.  He said \"pink,\" and the burger came out with like, a tiny touch of maybe-pink in the middle.  Medium-rare, this ain't!  He said it was okay.  Not great.  Just a burger.  I didn't taste it, I just nibble on a few of his fries, which were pretty average.\n\nThat all came in at around $30, aided greatly by the happy hour appetizer discount.  I have no interest in going to Applebee's again because I can get better burgers, pasta, chicken, bar food, everything, etc anywhere else, but if I was road tripping and needed a place to stop, this wouldn't be a bad choice.  Sit at the bar and hope Chuck is there, and enjoy pretty average versions of American bar food.", "business_id": "h3la53L9-OX_HlfeAySh0Q", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-03-01", "type": "review"}

I ordered the Bacon Bleu Cheeseburger with dry bleu cheese. Probably mistake on my part.

There's really no use in rating the actual food, as it's hard to screw up food at a McDonald's. It's all subpar grub, but my penchant for getting filet-o-fish sandwiches this time of year lives on anyway, so I had to go satiate my once-a-year craving.\n\nMy issue was with the service. I walked in and the employees were just chatting it up with their friends and off-hours coworkers who were on the customer side of the counter. It was around 11pm and the lack of customers inside of the restaurant made it pretty obvious that I was the only person waiting for my order to be taken, but that didn't stop the employees behind the counter from finishing their conversations before taking my order.\n\nAfter I finally put my order in, I seemed to wait an eternity (in fast food terms) for my two filet-o-fish sandwiches, regular McBites, and medium french fry order. It was hardly a complicated order, but I've waited less time during peak hours at other fast food chains in the past. Thankfully, there was ONE girl working who saw me standing there for a long time, and asked, \"are his McBites up yet?...where are they?\" I was happy that someone had finally addressed the situation, but it shouldn't have taken that long.\n\nAgain, I'm aware that showing up at 11pm will probably increase my odds of walking into a late-night, preparing-for-the-next-day mess of a restaurant, but even in fast food, it's absurd to think that the level of cleanliness that I walked into is acceptable. Not to mention, the one girl who was working announcing that she was \"going to pee\"  while I was standing there. I wasn't offended at all, but I found it odd that she thought that was acceptable to say in front of a customer.\n\nI guess this experience reminded me of why I limit my trips to fast food chains as much as possible.", "business_id": "xUf11yTcoRagwNiJcY8GAA", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-03-26", "type": "review"}

Earlier in the day, when it's dead, it has that low-key neighborhood vibe. In fact, it's so low-key that the last time I was in, it essentially became a family restaurant with a few of the tables filling up with groups of little kids and their parents after what I presume was a basketball game. Granted, that forced us to move, as our group of adults didn't want to spend the afternoon attempting to talk over the sounds of a dozen + kids, but I guess with a few video games on the one side of the bar, the TV's, and affordable food, it's not an awful option for the locals to bring their kids during the day.\n\nThe bartenders have always been really nice, and the beer selection is pretty good. With a nice pint and all of the TV's, it's a decent place to catch a game, so there are definitely some positive aspects to The Saloon. Just don't expect much from the food. \n\nNow, yes...I'm fully aware that it's a bar, so the food isn't supposed to be great, but their food is actually bad enough that when I'm hungry The Saloon just isn't a place I consider an option unless we're meeting people there. I've given the food on the menu three chances to impress me, ordering different items each time, and sadly, the only food item that I enjoyed was the complimentary popcorn they brought to our table and/or gave us at the bar...and I'm not a big fan of popcorn.\n\nEven something as simple as the buffalo chicken tenders I ordered last time as a fail-safe hope for a meal - after two previous disappointing experiences - scored below-average. The buffalo sauce was almost gritty, as the seasoning in the sauce was too noticeable. Talk about an awful texture. The fries are okay, but the sweet potato fries were too greasy. Now I'm sure there are people who will stand behind the food at The Saloon, but after my 3 unimpressive meals, I know I'll be hesitant the next time I'm perusing the menu during a visit. Perhaps I'll wise up and just eat at Aladdin's or Little Tokyo next door to The Saloon before heading into the pub next time.", "business_id": "jJfTh2O3M2Q716akd9Dr9w", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-03-12", "type": "review"}

He harassed my dinner partner and myself with a condescending tone regarding a sandwich that we order nearly every visit, which happened to be just last Sunday, in which we had great service (she must have worked at a steak house somewhere and SHOULD be the manager, her name is Erika, thank you Erika... and she was rewarded with a 30% tip.  Prior to the plate landing on the table, the waitress commented on its appearance. \n\nWe both agreed with her, tasted it as per our request to be nice, and sent it back to the kitchen as she recommended it prior to us tasting it.  It came back to the kitchen in the same condition, supposedly \"remade\"... which by that time, my sandwich was cold from waiting, in which I kindly requested it to be reheated if that was possible..  We have also ordered the same sandwich from about a dozen other Pittsburgh restaurants.. we know what it's supposed to look like and taste.\n\nNot to mention, our order was delivered wrong.  My offered sandwich toppings were not on the sandwich.  And my dinner's partner side was completely wrong.\n\nSo I complimented the waitress, I told her that she was great.  She told us that she did not know what was going on in the kitchen and that she was sorry for the third or fourth time... something that the \"Manager\" could learn to use in his vocabulary.\n\nSo after the second sandwich landed on our table, and we decided not to eat it.  My partner and I agreed to simply leave and eat elsewhere.  We were planning to pay for our drinks, and tip the waitress, and simply leave as we did not receive the food that we ordered... \n\nThen the \"Manager\" came out.. a loose cannon that has no business even working in an establishment.  He harassed us, we showed him the sandwich, a smooshed example of their culinary art that \"his guys worked so hard on\".  He did not understand the concept behind keeping customers, \"you can get it right 6/7 times a week, but tonight you got it wrong, and we are not paying for an ill-made sandwich\".  Those were my words.\n\nWe even politely called over the waitress to mediate his attitude that had no firsthand experience in our situation.. as she was readily available for us.  She flipped her story, so the sandwich and kitchen that was off in her opinion was suddenly on their A game tonight.  I guess the three to four prior apologies from her was also none of the \"Manager\"'s concern.   \n\nHe threatened to call the police and told us that he never wanted to see us again.  This was after he personally insulted myself for having a couple of light beers...as I was \"welcomed back to enjoy drinks since I enjoyed them so much.\" I told him that a personal insult was unnecessary and with that, I also advised him to attend a management school and that we will not pay for our meal.  He then harassed us more, asking us what was wrong with my sandwich.. at that point I was done.  I simply told him that we were not paying because of the way he treated us.\n\nThe staff illustrates the faces behind the business.  The Saloon would be great in the right hands, but it's in the wrong hands, run by people that may have over 30 years of ownership, but zero concern for their customers nor any competence in organizing and managing their business.  And that lends itself to a less than mediocre ambiance, low food quality, and inconsistent service... hence the 3 - 3.5 star rating seen around the Internet.  And the 5 stars... they had Erika and no \"Manager\" presence nor drinks from the bar.  Not to mention, the bartender has little competence in mixing drinks, hence the long beer list.  Save some money, fire the manager and the bartender.\n\nAfter walking half a block home, we changed our clothes from our traumatizing, filth of an experience from our lovely, family friendly neighborhood restaurant, and headed to the Walnut Grill, where we sent back the sandwich only once (thanks to a kitchen error on the order), there were only smiles and no threats.  There's a reason why Walnut Grill has several locations, the ambiance is killer, the service is stellar, the drinks are mixed the correct way, and the food is just as edible the next day, because it's that great to take home.  \n\nIF the owners were savvy and recognized that they live in 2015, they would know that this review alone can hurt their business by up to 20% or more.  I hope it does.\n\nA $8.99 Sandwich and incompetent service.. lost a tab + tip which was going to be paid.. weekly patrons.. and has initiated an interview with our dedicated lawyer.", "business_id": "jJfTh2O3M2Q716akd9Dr9w", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-05-10", "type": "review"}

Yes, it's April 2012 and Yelp tells me that I've had Matt's bookmarked since December 2010 after reading Cassandra's ROTD. http://www.yelp.com/biz/matts-chicago-dog-charlotte#hrid:Kn7dQhdcPMfAv-UTRkQjxA. And so with my hot dog craving unsatisfied from several attempts, here I am.\n\nPopped in towards the end of the lunch hour and was able to find a seat to drop off my backpack. At the register, I went with the eponymous Chicago Dog of course. But I knew that one hot dog wouldn't fill me up, so I had a Carolina Dog to go with it. And a Diet Coke, to cancel out all those bad calories.\n\nThe Chicago Dog was made almost perfectly traditionally. An all-beef hot dog on a poppy seed bun, topped with sport peppers (a little too hot for my taste, I took one bite and had to put them to the side), tomato wedges, chopped onions, yellow mustard, celery salt and that green relish that practically glowed in the dark. The only ding is that the pickle was a slice (lengthwise) rather than a spear. It doesn't matter to me personally, but a Chicago Dog connoisseur might be upset. Whatever, it tasted AWESOME.\n\nThe Carolina Dog was ON THE MONEY. Also an all-beef hot dog, it was topped chili, mustard, chopped onion, and cole slaw. Messy as all get out, but I was prepared and didn't wear any of it home.\n\nAfter seeing the mentions of the fries, I skipped 'em. Free refills on the soda. If it's a nice day (and it was!) take it outside.\n\nOh, and that pesky craving for hot dogs? Totally slayed.", "business_id": "gpCtDCSXIoQx70cq9itfNA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-04-14", "type": "review"}

I have never had to wait for a table, and the lines move very quickly. Good amount of parking, and close to a streetlight for easy an easy exit to back to the airport.\n\nThe Food: The same sloppy McDonald's assembly, but gosh I do love how the burgers taste. I always get some kind of burger variant (Big Mac, double-cheeseburger, etc) and I am never disappointed. The quality control between individual McDonald's chains makes it a safe bet if you actually enjoy McDonald's food.

This is more of a public service announcement.\n\nI wish I had the email that I wrote to Wendy's about my visit here. Yes, I wrote a letter, I'm that guy. Alas, gone into cyberspace.\n\nAnywho, it went a little something like this. I stopped on the way to the theatre, to grab a bite. There was no one in line, no one in the restaurant and maybe a couple of cars in the drive thru. The restaurant didn't seem all that clean, there was a lot of detritus in the food prep area, but nothing overly repellent. That is until the cashier finally sauntered over after I'd been waiting a few minutes. Sauntered, no rush. You know that body odor smell? That's not good when you're ordering food. Personal hygiene wasn't on the menu that night!! I ordered. After a few more minutes of waiting and my perception of discord in the kitchen and general apathy toward accomplishing anything, I decided I just wanted to leave. The whole experience just left me with the uneasy feeling that I didn't want to put anything from here into my mouth. I asked for my money back and left. So after roughly 10 minutes (with not another customer in the restaurant), I walked away empty-handed. I did make the movie though!\n\nPost script: The owner and/or general manager, Dennis, sent me an email asking me to call him to talk about the issue. I called him, he told me the matter would be \"dealt with.\" Fantastic. I'm still never setting foot in there ever again.

Shockingly huge - rectangular in shape, the building is at least 4-5 times deeper than it is wide. \n+ Bar runs the entire length of the building\n+ Nice selection of taps and bottles available\n+ Was quite surprised to find Abita Strawberry on tap\n\n+ Tons of televisions; our high-top had its own TV\n- Very noisy due to all of the televisions going\n\n- All tables were dirty; staff wasn't too good about wiping down after people left\n- Our server was quite gruff, not terribly helpful, largely absent, and forgot to bring refills of drinks and waters\n\nSo... all of that stuff aside, let's talk about the fish.\n\nTwo options for fish: 3-piece or 5-piece deep-fried cod. No baked cod, and no other fish varietals. \n\n+ The cooking area is in plain view of the entire restaurant\n- You'll leave smelling like a deep fryer\n- We watched as our fries sat and languished on plates for a good 5+ minutes while the fish cooked\n- We watched as our completed plates loitered in the cooking area for another 5+ minutes after the fish was done; our server was busy running around helping other tables while the fish sat...and sat... and sat... \n- Before we were finished eating, our cranky server began clearing a space directly behind us so that they could set-up for karaoke. That's all well and good, but the guy kept bumping stuff into us (the bar stools don't have backs)... he was like a bull in a china shop.\n\n+ Batter on the cod was delicious, if not quite salty. Violet L is a salt fan, and she even commented that it was overly salty\n- The cod itself was dry, slightly chewy, and meh. My fisherman friend said it was \"jerky-like.\" He was, however, quite impressed (as were all of us) by how well the batter clung to the cod. The two components were very well bonded.\n- I thought the batter had a taste similar to KFC's original coating - salty with a bit of pepper. I suspect that those who truly enjoy this fish fry are mostly in love with the batter.\n\nI didn't try the slaw; the roll was your typical cafeteria-style white bread roll.\n\n+ Inexpensive; four of the 3-piece cod dinners with a round of drinks was $34.\n\nI'm not sure why Madison Fish Fry likes this place so much. Perhaps we got a bad round of cod, along with bad service. Fish that sits after being cooked never bodes well... and while I believe in second chances, the overall experience left me quite sour, so it may be difficult to return in a timely manner.", "business_id": "zAsxPh3h9xMQnSDGl41kSg", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-05-05", "type": "review"}

The burger buns weren't so much toasted as burnt. Crispy chunks of burnt hamburger bun....yummmm. All 3 of us were pretty underwhelmed. I can honestly say that even the last fast food burger I had was better than the one I ate at Eagle Crest.\n\nThe bar itself is a pretty typical Wisconsin dive bar. Nothing fancy, with an interesting crowd. Plenty of televisions and gambling machines. There were only a few others in there around 8 pm on a Sunday. We were repeatedly told that we were lucky that the grill was still on, thanks to some guy who I assume is a regular. So I'm not sure exactly why it took about 20 minutes to cook 3 burgers.

Drinks were cheap (I think my giant mug of Blue Moon was $3.75) and service pretty quick, only delayed when the bartender was stuck grilling. She was always apologetic and sure to let us know that she would be with us in a few, and we were in no rush at all so it wasn't a big deal.\n\nAs several Yelpers have documented, the burgers are huge. Like, almost use the whole package of ground beef for one patty huge. I like my patties thin and won't touch anything that's still pink in the middle, so I opted to skip trying their burgers, as my (probable lack of) enjoyment of them would have little to do with the actual flavor or quality. Their tacos sound legendary though, and I'm not expecting anything fancy - I fully expect to be reminded of what my mom served my brothers and I as children (flour tortilla, ground beef, shredded cheddar, lettuce, tomato, and sour cream, for the record).

Its biggest downsides:\n- it's touted as a blue-collar bar, but it's more an excuse to be shabby and dirty than anything; $15 for a 5-bottle bucket of beer is not a good deal, and $5 for a PBR & a rail shot is a special for a couple hours one night a week when it should be the standard price for such a combination\n- the ladies room is ridiculously tiny and awkward, had a seat that was half hanging off the bowl, and no TP\n- every surface was dirty or sticky, yuck\n\nYou probably won't die if you go to see a friend's band play, but supporting a friend should be the only motivation for setting foot inside.", "business_id": "-4PHmmCt_RmAfaE3sDKW_g", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-05-28", "type": "review"}

Once was waaay back in 2008 or so, when I went in and ordered some chicken tenders. They told me they were out of chicken tenders (?) so I'd have to order something else. Pass. I've been avoiding it ever since.\n\nYesterday, boyfriend and friends wanted Hardee's. I figured it was time to let bygones be bygones, so I went to Hardee's and ordered the three-chicken-tender combo basket with curly fries and a drink. The girl behind the counter was efficient but rushed, which is kind of what I expect from fast food employees, so I'm not really fazed by that. My friends were already seated and served, so I filled my beverage and sat with them. I made sure my number was prominently displayed near the edge of the table, as directed.\n\nBoyfriend finishes eating basically as soon as I sit down. This is normal.\n\nFriend A finishes his burger about five minutes later. Still no sign of my food.\n\nFriend B finishes her meal. By now it's been ten minutes. Hmm.\n\nI notice that people who were three spots behind me in line have been served and have FINISHED at this point.\n\nI check my receipt. It's been fifteen minutes. My friends need to get back to work. I flag down the next passing employee, who happens to be the manager. I ask him what had happened to my food. Manager disappears, comes back three or so minutes later. Apparently the person who put my tenders in to cook forgot to set a timer (??) and they burned, so rest assured, they were going to make me new ones and they should be ready in another five minutes or so.\n\nNo.\n\nI tell him to cancel my order and give me a refund. He was sincere and apologetic, which I appreciate, but at this point I had been in the restaurant for over a half an hour with no food. I'm patient for the most part, but there was no offer to comp the meal, just.. \"Hey, keep waiting and we might feed you in another few minutes. Maybe!\" I understand that they may have been understaffed and that it was the lunch rush, but how no one noticed that one order wasn't filled for 15 + minutes just boggles my mind. I took the money from my refund and went next door to Taco Bell, where I was served terrible but tasty food very promptly and with much kindness. I really love the Taco Bell on Neil. It's clean, friendly, and the girl who works the register during lunch is awesome. I even make substitutions and deletions to my order, and they have NEVER gotten it wrong. So, the moral of this story, in short - save your time and money by skipping Hardee's and go next door to Taco Bell.", "business_id": "9SFWEreW7wAXB3zYu28r_Q", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-03-24", "type": "review"}

What's worse is they're usually rude about it. It's like hey you didn't type it into the register correctly, that's not really my fault. They will argue with you and make sure you know you can't have it your way, no matter what their slogan is.\n\nLastly, they don't honor coupons the correct way. I just went there with a buy-one-get-one-free coupon that blatantly says I would get a free Whopper sandwich of equal or lesser value with the purchase of one. NOWHERE does it say that it excludes special Whoppers like the Angry Whopper, etc. So when I asked if I could get an Angry Whopper and the free one be a regular Whopper, the Hispanic, older (maybe 40s) woman with long, painted nails (describing her so you know to stay away from her - she is referred to as the \"Latina hussie\" in the other post) asked me passive aggressively if I wanted an Angry Whopper and two regular Whoppers.\n\nNo, that is EXACTLY why I was asking if I could get that deal because other BKs actually honor the coupon and its ambiguity. I said the coupon didn't specify but she handed me the coupon, roller her eyes like she had something better to do, and said it only applied to REGULAR Whoppers.

It's expected because I have literally been to HR's all over the country, on both coasts, and every single one serves dry chicken.  I guess that's what they teach at the HR School of Cooking.  I guess they just put more focus on music than food.  Who knows.\n\nWhy I gave HR three stars I will never know.  Why I keep going back is certainly beyond my capacity to understand.

So was management that I spoke with so I have nothing negative to say about the service. It was quick and friendly. \n\nBut the menu! It sucks! It is way overpriced! And nothing I had was good. For $10 I got the worst plate of nachos I have ever had! Sure it was big and plenty to share and even more to throw out, but it was awful. Glad I didn't pay another $4 for meat because it was so bad that even meat could not improve it! The beans had no flavor, the jalapeno provided the only bit of flavor to the plate. The salsa was pure trash- more live crushed tomatoes and no flavor! You would think in the SW they could at least adapt and go with a better salsa! \n\nMy other pick was potato skins, I love the things. The guy next to me ordered them, $9 for a half plate of the tiny-est potatoes I think anyone could skin! I think there were 6 halves but certainly not more than 8 halves, all the size of a child's palm! \n\nI had a frozen drink called a Pickled Tink $6.75. Awful! Did not come completely mixed and barely pink. Tasted overwhelmingly of the coconut flavor. It was frozen and slushy and weak enough to feed to a kid. If I had one with me I would have let him/her have it, seriously. \n\nIt was my birthday as was maybe 4 other unfortunate souls to be eating there. They gave us each a Sundae with fudge on the whip cream and a small candle. They shouted at the patrons to to shoot Happy Birthday at each of us at separate times and clap.

We were staying at a hotel which included parking in the garage; therefore, I'm not sure of the garage rates.  I would recommend parking there when in the area.    \n\nPERKS:  Location, location, location!\n\nSERVICE:  The waitress was friendly and very efficient.  Even though it was getting busier each minute we were there, she was very responsive to our table!  VERY happy!\n\nCONCLUSION:  For event nights, DEFINITELY get there at 5 pm.  If you wait until 6 pm or later, it will be quite crowded.  The location alone makes this place perfect for dinner and drinks before attending games/concerts.

I'd never heard of Whataburger before so I thought David Foster Wallace was making it up when he refers to the \"Whataburger Southwest Junior Invitational\" in Infinite Jest (the tennis tournament is made up). When I found out it was a real place, I had to come here. \n\nIt wasn't bad and kudos to the woman taking my order. She upsold me to a meal - \"are you sure you don't want a meal, honey?\" Her voice indicated that she was genuinely concerned about my general hunger situation which, admittedly, was extremely high at that very moment. Then there was the wait outside the take-out window, probably 10 - 15 minutes in total. I  figured they must be assembling one king-hell burger in there. But more likely, it took that much time to fill the giant Whataburger cup with Fanta Orange soda. I let out an audible gasp when I saw it - holy crap it was big. Like I could have gone hiking in the desert for miles with nothing but that giant cup of soda to sustain me. \n\nThe burger was pretty big. Bigger than anything you'll find at any other fast food joint and don't forget the wait, I think the wait is key. Because that wait is what sets this place apart from say, a Mickey D's or an In-n-Out (which, incidentally, Whataburger is way better. Like the first time I ate an In-n-Out burger that's exactly what it did). So sitting outside waiting behind the big white SUV with the smokey exhaust you're inhaling for the ten minutes it takes for them to make their burger, plus the ten or so minutes it takes for them to cook your own and  assemble your meal, fill the giant styrofoam Whataburger cup with Fanta Orange soda, and deep fry your peach pie (very tasty) lets you reflect on the state of your life in relationship to your expectation of wanting a fast food restaurant to act as an instant gratification machine, when, in fact, by going to those other places, you are perhaps missing out on all this personal attention to your burger, meal, soda, dessert assembly (and don't forget that caring moms-like voice so concerned for your hunger situation), in the space of which time you are allowed to reach out to loved ones via your cellphone or text-messaging system (I was able to call my husband twice and read a magazine article about hiking in Tempe), and think about what you want to do next w/r/t your art and just what the fuck are you doing with your life anyway that you think waiting outside the Whataburger for ten minutes is keeping you from actualizing some potential self that may be far better served by simply having to wait a moment for your food?", "business_id": "ixTr1qXUFGTzyaZUuCDDvg", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-04-20", "type": "review"}

This is the third time now that I've gone to this Burger King and ordered a croissant breakfast sandwich with sausage and this is the third time I have gotten ham instead. It's not a very big deal since I do like ham and it tastes all the same anyway when I'm eating quick fast food on my way to work, but it does get annoying after a while. The first time it happened, I looked at the wrapping around the sandwich after I'd realized it was ham and it was labeled ham. So the second time I made sure to look at the wrapping when they gave me my food and it was marked sausage so I thought I was good and it turned out to be ham anyway. This third time I asked when they gave me to the food to make sure it was sausage because the past two times it's been ham, and sure enough they said it was my correct order and that they checked it and I received ham again.\n\nI called this location to let them know that this is the third time... Not to complain to them, but to at least let them know that this is happening in their drive-thru and if it's happened to me 3 times, I'm sure it's happened to many other customers. I talked to the manager and was put on hold and then the call disconnected... Or else they hung up on me. Either way, I'm writing this review just to let people know to check their orders before leaving the drive thru. :)", "business_id": "I2IofjP2sHZUkv7pcoc33A", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-04-03", "type": "review"}

We were out running errands, it was getting late, and this location is right around the corner from the house.  \n\nThe food is average for a chain.  You know what you're gonna get no matter what location you go to.  The service however is hit or miss...and last night the service missed the mark by a mile!\n\nOur waiter got to our table and asked for our drink order.  Good deal.  We order when he returns with our drinks.  \n  \nJ's order - Fajitas. \nMy order - Oriental Chicken Salad\nBaby C's order - Kids Meal Grilled chicken sandwich  (Kids Eat Free on Tuesdays)\n\nOur server, Michael,  runs off before I'm able to state..uhhh...the kids meal comes with a drink and side!!  We have to flag him down.  We state...we didn't have a chance to order the drink or side for our son.  He's like...oh i ordered him fries.  I'll have to go change it.  \n\nREALLY!?  I'm so sorry to inconvenience you!!  And I'm glad you think you know better than I do what I wanna feed MY CHILD!  Wow!  How perceptive of you...ya dumbazz!!  I order Baby C some steamed broccoli and a juice.  \n\nJ's and my food come out as ordered.  Baby C's is MIA.  A few minutes later his sandwich is brought out....with an applesauce.  Again I have to flag down the server so the correction can be made.  About 5 minutes later we get a side of over steamed broccoli...but whatever.  Baby C doesn't seem to mind.  \n\nDrinks...he's on the ball with refills of my water.  But misses the mark with J's root beer refill.  He brings him Dr. Pepper instead.  And then when J says...hey this is Dr. Pepper, not Root Beer.  The server is like..you ordered Dr. Pepper though, right?  WRONG!  \n\nThen we had to wait around for the check and for him to run my card.  It was funny, but I was looking around and spotted the servers other tables.  The one right next to us didn't seem happy either with the service.  In fact they seemed pretty pissed.  \n\nI sure hope we get a different server if and when we ever return.", "business_id": "hzUOqxpcnYYBgLlrgvjQYQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-04-10", "type": "review"}

First off, I like Harvey's.  Do I go to Harvey's all the time?  Nope.  But I enjoy the burgers and the simplicity of the place.  I have probably been there 15 times over the past 3 years, so this is a culmination of all of those meals.\n\nEveryone talks about the decor (or lack thereof).  The inside of the place is DARK (especially when compared to most places in Phoenix).  When you leave the place during the day, make sure you have sunglasses.  After your eyes spend so much time adjusting to the lack of lighting, the sun feels like inmates coming out of solitary confinement for a month.  While the decor gets 0 stars from the Zagat type crowd, I find some sort of enjoyment with how beat down it is.  In fact, if they spruced it up, I probably wouldn't like it as much.  It is a true dive bar.\n\nThe service isn't great, but it isn't what I would call bad.  It isn't like they screw everything up, but it is a bit slow.  If you are in a hurry to eat (like most Americans on lunch hour), then maybe you should go to McDonald's across the street.\n\nFinally, the burgers.  They are great.  Quality meat, good cheese, and plenty of char.  I never found the food unsanitary, but I have also been to Brazil, so the food here is always more sanitary.  I am not a fan of the fries (got to Delux, Gordon Biersch, or Cafe Bink if you want truly great fries), but the onion rings are good (not as good as Ted's Hot Dogs, though).  I love the fact that they have RC Cola.  I have only had drinks there 1 time.  They make them stiff, and will impair your judgement quickly if you aren't careful.

Neighborhood dive bar where everyone seemed to know each other, insanely friendly service (shout out to Kerri!) and killer bar food and chicken wings of epic proportions! \nI am a chicken wing connoisseur, and frankly Jt's may have the best chicken wings I have EVER had! They deep fry those baby's, sauce em and throw them on the grill. They have several choices of sauces the best was the works which featured all of their sauces mixed together minus their suicide sauce which produced a delicious and not too spicy wing! I like my wings ultra spicy so I ordered a side of the Suicide sauce, which I personally loved - definitely spicy but not so that your mouth is on fire. Their wings will set you back $7.50 for a dozen ( Which makes me love this place more!). \nThey have a pretty large beer selection on tap and every liquor you would want!

I came in from out of town and hung out with my buddy Joe. He highly recommended JT's because of their awesome wings and tiny tacos. What he didn't know was that most of the positive reviews of this place on Yelp are ancient reviews from when Julio was still working there. This place had the kiss of death and was taken over by cheap, shady owners. The new owners want to cut cost but still cash in on the positive word of mouth about the food. They also raised the prices. So in essence, the new owners are producing a cr@p product and charging us more money! To add insult to injury they shorted us 2 chicken wings. Talk about trifflin'!! If they're shorting people wings, I'd hate to know what they're doing to their drinks. When we got them they were cold all the way down to the bones and stale like they had been made as a mistake earlier in the day, boxed up and given to us (short 2 wings!!!). The tacos were bland like they just cooked some ground beef without seasoning and threw it in the shell. I added the salsa to try to add some flavor to it but it didn't cut it. I'm sure MY taco has more flavor than this one did. Most of the wings and tacos are still in the fridge and will inevitably meet their fate at the bottom of the garbage can. In conclusion, if you want over priced, piece of cr@p wings that don't taste half as good as frozen ones and tacos that taste better when they come out of you than going in, go to JTs so they can pi$$ on you face and tell you it's raining!\n*Additionally, don't believe the review underneath mines. I'm almost 100% positive it was done by someone who works for them or has some sort of affiliation with this place. It's written like an advertisement. The wings look NOTHING like they do in that picture. This review would be VASTLY different if they did. Our wings were all limp and flaccid when they showed up to film. Nice try you guys.

There were I think 2 or 3 people in line before us and right before it was our turn, I noticed a sign. 10 sliders for some ridiculously cheap amount after 4pm. I can't remember the exact price. I think it was like 10-20cents off their regular pricing. So thanks to the people in line, we were able to place our order at 4:01pm. Perfect. I'm poor so I like deals.\n\nSliders was all we got. They were DELICIOUS! I thought I'd only be wanting 2 since they're a pretty big size, but I ate three!  The bread was soft  and the ratio of meat to bun was perfect!

The smell of GRILLED ONIONS hits you before you even touch the front door.  That is the definition of a Chicago dog/burger joint.  That IS Maxwell Street.  That IS Chicago.\n\nThe Food - I ordered the fire dog, a cheese slider, and fried zucchini.\nThe firedog didn't let me down in the authenticity department.  Good meat, the correct and required condiments (neon relish, celery salt, sport peppers, tomato, mustard, onion. and seedy seed bun), cooked just right, and it smelled up the office when I opened it.  \nThe slider was the ex-factor.  I saw 'slider' and immediately thought White Castles.  But I didn't want to compare it to that, so I slapped my head to get the thought outta there.  Its a little burger with mustard, onions, and cheese.  What makes it special is the way the meat's taste melds with the onions, mustard and especially the bun.  Mine had a little too much mustard...and the bun wasn't a player on the field at all.  In fact, the sub-par bunnage took away from the slider.  BUT, I said I wouldn't compare it to Whitey One Bite's (White Castle's), so for what it is...ITS GOOOOOOD!  You will find yourself wishing you bought 2 or 82 more of them.\nThe zucchini was just filler for the car ride back to the job.  They were greasy and crunchy enough to get me excited at first...but their charm wore off after about 5 of them.  They are little chips of zucchini fried nice and crispy.  The taste of the batter just didn't do it for me, and the flavor of the  zucchini wasn't quite on point.  Doh, I REALLY hate saying anything negative about this place, because of....\n\nThe Atmosphere:\nYou know what kind of place you're in when you open the door.  A joint.  Pure joint.\nChicago newspaper clips, posters, political campaigns, pennants, whatever you can take from Chicago and stick on a wall.  This is the first time I've walked into a Chicago joint and was actually MOVED.  The place made me a little misty.  \nI miss Chicago.  \nThis joint made me remember some of my happier times as a kid, when life didn't suck.\nIts the kind of place you go and sit down with your team or with your buddies or with your kids or with your ma or with your worse enemy.  The SMELL OF GRILLED ONIONS makes everything just fine with the world.  Its the kind of place you go after you've just had some kind of fun, or even some kind of heartache.  Its just the kind of place you can go whenever, for whatever reason.  You feel like you belong here; like the world's bitter and evil hands can't reach you here.  You feel...safe.  Sorry to go off on that tangent, but its just something about the actual establishment itself...\nWho cares about what the floors look like, or what's in the corners?  Its a joint.  Its got joint floors and joint corners and joint tables and chairs.  Ain't nothing crawling.  Nuff' said.\n\nThe Service:\nAfter my nostalgic head-trip back to Chi-Town, I had to let the guy at the counter know they had done right by me.  Not much conversation due to the uncanny line that seemingly popped up out of nowhere behind me.  He told me that when I call in an order, \"Aw, you ain't gotta wait in line, just come on up.\"  That was almost the equivalent of him saying \"I love ya', man!\"  Without the awkwardness.  Oh, when I said I was picking up for 'Mike'...they all went \"Mike's here!  Got Mike here!  Get Mike's order!!!  Let's go!\"  Maybe its a routine, but it makes a guy feel like a million friggin bucks in a recession.  Let's just say I walked out of there feeling 10 times better than I did before I walked in.  And lastly, an elderly lady came in, and they all knew her name.  The guy immediately asked if she wanted something to drink.  I don't know...that just sat right with me.\n\nThe Value:\nOn.  The.  Money.  I kid you not, you got 5 bucks, you can eat...and good.  Get a couple sliders and fries for under 5 bucks.  Or one of the dogs and fries.  You're looking at a little more for an Italian Beef (which I intend to trek back there for), or something like that.  Money is an issue for most people, but you won't hurt yourself having lunch here twice a week.\n\nThe Bottom Line:\nDespite the lack-luster experience with my zucchini and bun, I must say this:  Go here.  Go here often.  Smile when you get to the counter.  Tell them they have a nice place, even though they already know it.  Eat sliders.  Eat dogs.  Eat Frito Pie (and tell me how it was....while you stand a few feet away from me with that corn chip breath).  Sit down here.  Bring friends.  Bring people you don't know that much.  Bring people you don't like that much.  Just see how things turn out.  Your stomach and mouth will be happy.  Your heart will be happier, but perhaps out of a few years.  Write about it.  Talk about it.  Grab a few menus and stick 'em on the board at work.  \nThis place is all right.\nThis place is all right.", "business_id": "iNvY0zAlaD_ye7Z6rHu-Ug", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-03-19", "type": "review"}

My first venture there I tried their Italian beef sandwich, which really hit the spot. I got it with mozzarella and a side of red sauce, not exactly traditional but sometimes I just get that craving. It was pretty good on this occasion, the beef itself was kinda average but the bread was PERFECTION and I was pleased. Round two, not so much...it didn't stack up to the initial experience I had. My quest for the classic Italian beef in Arizona will continue elsewhere... Due to the failed Italian beef situation,  on my next visit I got a burger. Good, but nothing amazing. Visit number four found me giving the double cheese sliders a try, and I think I found my mainstay for this joint. While the regular double burger was a bit much and left me feeling like a fat bastard for the next 6 hours, two of these delicious little double cheese sliders did the trick perfectly. The fries are usually on point, I dump a healthy dose of Cajun seasoning on them as a rule. All in all, a pretty cool joint that reminds me why Chicago will always be \"home\"...", "business_id": "iNvY0zAlaD_ye7Z6rHu-Ug", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-03-26", "type": "review"}

The food is good (not great), but always seems to satisfy! Service varies, but is generally quite speedy and good. The servers look somewhat hustled and overworked. \nI wish I could give the place a quick update of style and maybe some new floors, tables, and a different layout. It seems too crowded with tables and can get really loud. Word of advice: sit in the \"front half\". The back seems even more conducive to a panic attack from sitting literally right next to another table. They need a re-brand and some new plates and silverware. There is a small patio out front with some concrete tables. You can tell they keep the place clean, it just needs a makeover. We unfortunately have sat by some fellow patrons lately who seem to fight, forget they are adults in public and really seem to bring the place down. For these negatives, I give 3 stars.

In the meantime, a waitress was bussing the table behind us and was extremely loud talking to another employee. And when I say loud, I mean LOUD. But that's not what bothered me. What bothered me is what she said... \"WOW! I didn't think they were going to tip me that much because they were black!\" Referring to the family at the table that had just left.  This is absolutely unacceptable, and I don't care what age, race, or what establishment you work in. Advice to the owners/managers- don't hire ignorant staff! Aside from that the food was just okay. Pizza was comparable to something that comes out of a frozen-food box, mozzarella sticks came out luke-warm (meaning the cheese was hard) and french fries were comparable to what you get in a grade-school cafeteria. \n\nSecond time we were here we came for what we thought would be a quick lunch. Serivce was so absolutely slow an incompetent. I ordered a garden salad (or whatever version of that is the small version) and the lettuce came out soggy and there was water at the bottom of the salad bowl. Talk about unappetizing. The whole meal service took nearly an hour and twenty minutes. So much for a quick lunch.. '\n\nThe third and last time I came here, I came with the idea that maybe \"the third time's a charm.\" Boy was I wrong. I ordered the dinner Ceasar salad, boyfriend ordered a small 7\" pizza with buffalo sauce instead of marinara, and we shared a side of fries. \nMy salad came out with the most unappetizing lettuce I have ever eaten in my life. The lettuce was wilted and nearly rotten, and seemed as if the romaine was cut in half (referencing the large pieces of lettuce). His pizza came out with barbeque sauce instead of buffalo. The waitress took it back, but when she did she took the tray and poked and prodded her fingers around the pizza to ensure that it was barbecue and not buffalo. Regardless of the fact that we didn't eat it that's still disgusting. \n\nAside from the terrible food and service, this place is dirty (and by dirty that's a compliment) and dingy and is nothing impressive to look at.

The food here is okay at best, for a McDonald's. It's certainly better than either location on Chandler Boulevard. However, my major complaint is that no matter what time of day I come or if I go drive through versus inside, not a single employee thanks me for my business. \n\nIt especially irks me because as someone who has worked customer service, I always make a point of thanking the people who are providing me the service. I don't think it's unreasonable to expect the same courtesy from people where I choose to spend my money, thus providing them a job.\n\nApart from the blatantly rude service, this location seems to have a problem with employees never emptying trash cans. Especially at the drive through. I can't count how many times I've come, even in the morning, and that trashcan is overflowing. I'm not sure if it's a problem for the health department or not, but I can tell you that it's really disgusting to see birds and flies hang around the trashcan right in front of where I'm picking up my food. Food and trash literally overflow. It's a similar case inside the restaurant, especially at the cans near the bathroom.\n\nOverall this is an okay McDonald's if you just need one that's close by, but don't expect it to be a great McDonald's.", "business_id": "-0HGqwlfw3I8nkJyMHxAsQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-05-23", "type": "review"}

My wife's turkey burger looked a bit sad with a pathetic turkey patty. Once it was brought to the waiters attention, he took it back and was overly apologetic.

It played out precisely the same.  However this time I factored in the error to be made and promptly went to Denny's and waited for my food.\n\nSo yeah, I can't say anything about their food, but I can't see where it would be worth the gamble of being pissed off due to such awful service.

Finally after about 10 mins the other couple and there kids got there food remind you they had ordered pancakes, i mean anyone knows pancake do NOT take that long to make. After we got our food and another refill we were asked about ice cream, we never asked for it but I guess it's included in every meal which would of been great if my daughter would have been with us.

Granted, I have been to no Whataburger! since this location (which I tried twice since it is right across the road from were I live), but both experiences were SO bad that I will probably never try again. \n\nLet me start off by saying that both visits were identical, in every way. And both visits were terrible, in every way. Why did I give it another shot? Everyone has bad days. Now, I'm not really a big fan of fast food, but as I said earlier, it's right across the road from where I live, and we're all creatures of convenience from time to time, so why not? I pulled into the drive-thru, up the screen and was friendly greeted. I assessed the menu, as I always do, for probably one second too long, before I decided on one of the meals, which was I believe a cheeseburger meal of some sort. There was a huge sign offering a new lemon pie. I wanted to try a lemon pie. It sounded good, I like lemon stuff, why not? \"Sorry, we're out of lemon pies.\" Not quickly forgetting the large sign advertising the lemon pies, I reluctantly parted ways with the pipe dream that was: lemon pie. I drove directly up to the window with no wait (curiously uncommon in retrospect) and my money was taken quickly, change returned quickly. So far so good (aside from the bitter conclusion of the great lemon pie saga). But wait my friends, this is where the fun begins. As I part with my money, the window begins to close. Soon to be the barrier between myself and my impending dinner for an excess of 10 minutes. I wait, and I wait, and I wait some more. I see the woman who took my money pass by several times, no eye contact. And even though it cannot be expressed in writing how long it actually felt like waiting for this meal, it was a really long time. Think about the longest time you've ever waited at a fast food window for your food. Multiply that by at least 2, but most likely 3 or 4. That's how long I waited. Maybe one more second for extra emphasis. Finally, I was handed my meal, and I peeled off, extremely frustrated over this scenario. Oh, and of course the meal was absolutely terrible. And I do mean terrible. Old, cold and full of mold. Well probably, I mean it might as well have been.\n\nAnyway, a month or so later, I was hungry, nothing sounded good or convenient, when in the distance, loomed the W I had begrudgingly renamed WheresMyBurger? Ok, Ok I thought to myself. I'll give them one more chance. Pulled up to the window, picked out another meal, a chicken sandwich this time, I think, and yes you guessed it, a lemon pie. Guess what? They were fully stocked with lemon pies. Just kidding, out again. I wanted to drive away right there, but was hungry and decided to wait. Maybe it'll be quicker. Nope, as long as last time. And the food was even worse.\n\nSo in conclusion, and proceeding most likely the longest fast food review you have ever read, I urge you, fellow food eaters, to stay far, far away.", "business_id": "2qf-0qkDNh7r8iU0498htQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-04-02", "type": "review"}

Then at about 6:30 PM that day I got a call from a manager. I told him the two times after the 1st three were fine. He had the audacity to falsely accuse me of trying to make him look bad. I have never had issues at a Whataburger before. I will go back to other Whataburgers. But not that Whataburger. Next time I will spend more money.

Seems month to month you don't know what they'll remove and what new thing they'll add.  Think about it, a class A restaurant that actually does make a good burger doesn't need to play hide and seek with their menu items . . . ever!\n\nIf I were to rate Red Robin burgers over other burgers I've had in my life, I'd give them around a 5/10.  They are simply sub-par and lack any real good burger flavor.  I did enjoy a pot roast burger they used to make, but good old corporate idiots took it off the menu.\n\nThe main thing with any Red Robin is it's all about atmosphere and friendly service, which they do rate a 10 in that department.  Unfortunately, the food is nothing to write home about.  There's literally nothing on their menu that I would find so good it's addictive, and isn't really, really good food what a restaurant should be about?  It's kind of sad, really.

The changes are, sadly, not good.

In addition, the \"garlic fries\" that come with an upcharge used to have real garlic on them but now come with a simple seasoning. Additionally, our fries that came with the burger were cold, so we asked for fresh fries. When we received those, they were cold, as well. When we followed up they insisted thay they were taken out fresh. If that is he case, there is something seriously wrong with the equipment.

When I left San Francisco for Las Vegas the last meal with my friends from the Bay Area was at Red Robin.\n\nI'm glad that no matter where I have been there has been a Red Robin to eat at. I get moments where I must have their bacon cheeseburger. I fiend for their fries.\n\nMy only universal complaint about Red Robin is that it is freaking LOUD in there. I mean the kind of loud that is so obnoxious that I feel I have to take some aspirin. But what I do see everytime are happy smiling faces from their customers. They must be doing something right!\n\nFood can be a bit salty because they put their seasoning on *everything* (I half expected it to be in my ice tea, too) - and their seasoning contains MSG. So being the fussy girl that I am, I always ask that absolutely zero seasoning be put on my food. Yea, call me a killer of fun, but would you rather spend time with me eating and laughing or watching me be carted off in an ambulance to the nearest emergency room?\n\nWhat I also love about Red Robin is their strawberry shake...I haven't had one in a long time, but I know that if I even have one drop, I won't be able to stop. I will want strawberry shakes until I die. So I try to take a sip off of friends' shakes...which usually turns into a brain ache slug that leaves them with more whipped cream than shake.  :D  Oops, my bad!\n\nI really do love their chocolate malts, too.

I dig joints like this as its relaxed and homey feeling. My eye immediately caught the huge vat barrel of salted peanuts at the front door - Score! Nothing like eating peanuts and chucking the shells on the floor or at other people. \n\nStarted off with a nice refreshing pint of Guinness which hit the spot and was on special. My wife and I ordered a dozen regular chicken wings to start.And by the way, when did that automatically become the norm to serve ranch with wings. I live for a while near Buffalo in Rotten-chester...eerrrr...Rochester New York and wings are definitely supposed to be served with Blue Cheese as the dipping sauce...I digress.\n\nAnywho, after I ordered I said to myself \"Dam, I forgot to tell her blue cheese\" and not the nasty ranch everyone seems to serve. When the wings arrived they were attractively plump and not dripping in wing sauce, which I find disconcerting, and low and behold there are 2 LARGE ramekins of sauce - one blue cheese and one ranch. Steven Tyler Pj's, Steven Tyler PJ's...nice call Teakwoods. The wings were really good too...I nearly canceled my dinner order and replaced it with more wings (and I should have). Only issue with the wing app there was only 4 measly pieces of celery garnished on the plate.\n\nFor dinner, I ordered the Caesar Salad with \"Grilled & Chilled\" shrimp. Sounded good...tasted awful...and for $13 bucks far from a good value. The salad itself wasn't bad but a Caesar should be mostly the hearts of Romaine and not inundated with the leafy crap.  I also overlooked the Caesar faux pas of the red onion rings...but the shrimp was unforgivable. My guess is the 13 dollar price point is based on the fact that it has shrimp in it and apparently the menu description of \"Grilled & Chilled\" shrimp actually in essence means cook a large batch of shrimp and throw them in the cooler until someone orders that salad we serve them in. That pasty mushy old shrimp taste is still in my mouth today...zoiks! Fresh grilled skewer of shrimp off the grill in the salad would have made a HUGE difference AND justified me throwin' down 16 bucks for it, which is how much you figure it costs with the tip. Maybe the owner should watch an episode of Chef Ramsey's \"Kitchen Nightmares,\" in fact any episode, and see how he preaches about the evils of the friggin' lazy cook it all ahead of time method. \n\nMy wife has been on Phase 1 of South Beach diet for 2 weeks and was totally cravin' a nice cheeseburger and fires. She was psyched to see sliders on the menu; however, they too were a HUGE disappointment, in fact she didn't even finish them. The bread was not moist and obviously stale, and the meat was dry and tasteless. They screwed up the fries...how do you screw up fries?  She said they were hot but dry and utterly tasteless...dude...some type of seasoning...any seasoning. \n\nTeakwoods did get 3 stars from which otherwise would have been 1 or 2 because the servers were cool and efficient, I liked the vibe, and free peanuts always pull me in like an electro-magnet. \n\nTwo parting words of advice for this restaurant \"Fresh Ingredients.\"", "business_id": "7-4FxYXhNUS2lhpUb_q5-w", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-04-19", "type": "review"}

Just a note - if you have a peanut allergy, avoid this place!\n\nanywho since it was lunch when we were there, i ordered myself a Turkey Dip and my friend an Open the Hatch Burger. Side item choices were fries, side salad, fruit, tater tots, onion rings, or sweet potato fries. I got tater tots with mine, and her's with fries. \n\nService was quick, and the portions huge. The turkey dip was nothing special, quite regular bar food not exceptional and not bad either. Tater tots were crispy and seemed store bought. The burgers are huge and a real mouthful, from what I hear it's ok. Prices are moderate as well.

I don't know why, but the title of the restaurant had me envisioning stuffy people reinventing the hot wing. That's not what I found. Instead, I was treated to a down to earth bar and grill with food that tasted the way it should.\n\nThe sandwich board out front as well as numerous signs on the walls and tabletop informed me of the unbelievable number of special drink deals this place offers. I'd be astonished if someone showed up any day of the week and couldn't find a cocktail or beer they'd enjoy at a discounted price.\n\nI ordered the hot wings and, while I wasn't blown away, they tasted as they should and were just hot enough. After relaxing with a couple beers, we ordered the soft pretzels which were fantastic. If your biggest complaint with a pretzel is that it's tied up, Teakwoods is for you. We received long strips of buttered pretzels (is it really a pretzel if it's straight? A discussion better left to a different forum) with a bowl of cheese dipping sauce.\n\nAs has been mentioned dozens of times in other reviews, they offer buckets of peanuts and allow the shells to hit the floor.

I typically order wine or beer but wasn't in the mood for either. I had a bad day and wanted hard liquor. The well drinks were cheap so I ordered a vodka and cranberry and ended up with a glass of cranberry juice. I know that there was no vodka in it, so I did what I almost never do - I sent it back. I ordered a margarita pitcher instead and that was much better. Not the best margarita, but it was good enough. I split it with my friend of course because my days of drinking entire pitchers of alcohol are long over and not missed. It came with these very stale chips and salsa. I didn't want to be that a-hole customer and send 2 things back in one night, so I just shut up and ate them. $16 for a pitcher and chips and salsa wasn't a bad deal. \n\nOur waitress took forever to check up on us and bring us the chips.

First off, glad to see blue cheese as an option, always a good sign.  Celery and carrots, check.  Good assortment of wings to drums, awesome.

It's hard to watch a thriving business implode, but that's what is happening here.  I've been a regular at this Teakwoods for about 7 years now.  My husband and I liked the atmosphere, food and friendliness so much that it's safe to say we even considered this when we bought our house (within walking distance) back in 2007.  Everyone who worked there was welcoming and hard-working, from the bartenders to the servers to the bussers.  The wings (and other dishes) were great (especially as sports-bar food goes), beer selection was good, prices were reasonable.  We've seen staff (and management) come and go, but we've remained loyal, and actually have stayed good friends with many current and ex-employees, who have become like family to us.\n\nBut things have been steadily going downhill, and now I think they've nearly reached rock bottom.  \n\nIt started with cosmetic stuff.  Leaky ceilings, scruffy empty shelves behind the bar for a long time, mismatched and shabby (and some downright uncomfortable) furnishings, tatty bathrooms.\n\nThen, the food.  We used to look forward to the daily specials; now it seems management is finding ways to \"repurpose\" leftovers or overstocks in new and unappealing ways and, frankly, in weird combinations.  Sliced hot dogs on a lavosh? Really?  Even one of my previously favorite appetizers, the caprese (oh--now spelled \"caprice\" on the menu) tastes bland and worn out.  I used to LOVE the creamy, cheesy, meaty cheeseburger soup when it appeared on the menu, but I had it just a couple of days ago and was disappointed to find it watery, virtually tasteless, and sorely lacking in the meat department.\n\nPrices were raised (during the recent Arizona Beer Week; talk about opportunistic!), and a rash of regulars left in protest, and have stayed away.  But I and a dozen or so other regulars remained, largely because of the friendly and efficient service of a few remaining long-time servers there, along with a few awesome bartenders and wonderful bussers.  The service in general had also gone down over time, but management seems to want to drive it right into the dirt, as they decided this week to get rid of two of their best servers.  That was the last straw for pretty much all of the regulars who had remained.\n\nI feel like I'm going through a divorce.  It's sad and depressing to watch, slowly but surely, a decent business and a fun place run into the ground (going much the same direction, apparently, as the recently closed Maricopa and Phoenix locations of Teakwoods have gone) by bad management and poor decisions, who put \"profits\" over people.\n\nWhy did I even give this place TWO stars? For the handful of wonderful staff who remain--AND for the wings, which are still great.

I love watching it and imagining what it's like traveling around the world, from restaurant to restaurant, enjoying some of the best food in the world. As a direct result, I suppose, I'm a bit of a food critic myself. I'm also a chef. So what does this have to do with Flancer's?\n\nWell, as you arrive at Flancer's, located near Gilbert and Guadalupe, you immediately notice the packed parking lot, bustling patio and the modest presentation of the small building; your destination. \n\nFlancer's immediate visual impact resembles many town favorites, gems in the rough - small, unimposing, perhaps underestimated but certainly welcoming. As you walk through the often crowded set of glass double doors, to the interior of the restaurant, the staff is immediately friendly and helpful. Everyone is observed to be working hard and all with smiles on their faces. Seating is likely to be immediate, however as you may be waiting for a brief moment in the small area available to the ever-present to-go customers, you should take the time to glance into the kitchen, which is directly ahead. It is clean and the energy of the restaurant is matched by the hustle and bustle of the kitchen staff - baking fresh bread, cooking fresh pasta and slicing freshly cooked meats for their award winning sandwiches.\n\nAfter being sat, the server is always prompt and welcoming. He will often immediately take your drink order and ask about an appetizer, give you some silverware and return promptly with the first round. Never imposing but always helpful, the server recommends the items of the day and gives you time to contemplate your order. The menu was recently downsized from a larger menu, which I found to be a good idea. I'd been here many times, but did often feel as if I was navigating the Sahara at times!\n\nI of course, have not had every item on the menu, and do not plan on it. However, what I can recommend to you are these items: The Prickly Pear Sandwich, We Must Meat, I Ain't Lion Sandwich, Roma on the Range Sandwich, The Chipotle Pasta, Goat Cheese Bruschetta, Oven Roasted Garlic Parmesan bread (without the marinara, served on the side, I believe it to be just fine without it), Awesome Balsam Salad and you can't go wrong with the beer battered french fries! All of these items I have had on more than one occasion and I can promise you that you will not be disappointed with them. Maybe some day I will branch out, and try one of the other selections available at Flancer's, but I'm not sure if anything else on the menu will come close to how good these dishes are, haha.\n\nSo in conclusion, whether you're on a business meeting or a Sunday lunch with friends or family, Flancer's offers healthy, delicious and decadent options to people from all walks of life. The American and Italian fusion provided by Flancer's in sandwich form, is seen all over the world, but no one in the Phoenix area does it better and that my friends, is all you really need to know.", "business_id": "JMOK_Sy6aSOZwd4qgkX7hg", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-04-02", "type": "review"}

I'll do anything to avoid chains, so this place really sounded good ... but it was not to be. \n\n I LOVE Bruschetta, but their bruschetta was disappointing.

My steak salad was not bad (the grilled steak was good quality, and nicely cooked - something many places get wrong) but the croutons were the typical pathetic specimen you'd expect at Denny's.  \n\nOverall, I found the menu confusing and the descriptions unappetizing. For example, there's a 'pasta' section, with this entry: \"Love me Tender ... \nFilet mignon, in gorgonzola cream sauce with spinach, mushrooms, green onions and roasted red bell peppers\"   Now - how does a 'filet mignon' end up as a pasta dish? Is the pasta on the side? Is the filet all chopped up and tossed in with the pasta?  Beats me!

They are known for their sandwiches but also carry good salads, pizza and calzones.\n\nThrough not the best sandwiches I have had in AZ, for the $8-10 price range, the flavors are decent and the portions are filling. My italian sandwich was OK, nor super meaty but flavorful and fresh enough. I did the salad and sandwich combo with a side of goat cheese salad (with spinach, pine nuts, garbanzo beans and sun fried tomatoes. I highly highly encourage this option as 1) you get a pretty big meal that is mildly healthy, 2) the sides offered with a full sandwich are definitely not worth the $1 savings. The goat cheese salad was ok except for the overly chunky dressing and the super dry breaded goat cheese (which should have been creamy and sharp in flavor).\n\nNow, the sides. My friends ordered the fruit cup and the jalapeno mashed potatoes, which both sucked. The fruit cup was a tiny bowl with 3  1x1\" pieces of cantaloupe while the mashed potatoes was a little bitter (from the jalapeno), was dry, lacked salt and came in like a fried cake with no remnant of  it ever being mashed potatoes. From what I saw being served around, the sweet potatoes are the thing to order, but since I haven't tried them myself, i'm gonna pull an NWA and say \"don't quote me boy, I ain't said shit\".\n\n ^ If you did not get the above reference then you are too young and I feel really sorry for you. If you did, *high five*\n\nOverall 3 stars for the flavor of the food, though I will say that the service was really good and I would definitely return for a quick bite to eat, but not necessarily recommend it to everyone.", "business_id": "JMOK_Sy6aSOZwd4qgkX7hg", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-05-15", "type": "review"}

Since we were meeting friends from Gilbert for dinner, we decided to try out the Gilbert location. \n\nWe got there about 6pm on a Sunday night. They were busy, but did not look packed. Even with a party of 6, we were seated within 15 minutes. We had a friend waitress, and she quickly took or order and got drinks. My friend noticed that the menu called out draft, so he asked about beers on tap. We were told that only the Mesa has beer on tap. =( We decided to order a kids mac & cheese, two different pizza's, a burger, and a salad. We were told that the pizza's took about 25 minutes, and that was fine, since we had ordered a salad as an appetizer. \n\nNow...the waiting began...about 30 minutes after we were there, the waitress came back to tell us that the kitchen was out of the hatch green chile that goes on their \"The Match with Hatch\" burger. My friend loves spicy food, so was disappointed on this and said to do jalapenos instead. We asked if the food was in process, and was told that it was and they would come back with an estimate. Around 45 minutes, the kids meal, salad, and burger showed up, followed very quickly by 1 of the 2 pizzas. The wagon wheel spinach salad was its typical tasty self. Typically my child LOVES the mac & cheese from here, and dives in. This time, it took a lot of encouragement to get her to eat it. It was a lot drier than usual and didn't seem to have the same cheesy flavor compared to what she usually has at the Mesa location. I typically love their pizza's; however, the Veg Out that we ordered was not up to the usual quality. My 1st slice was burned black on the bottom and tasted burned. At least only 1/2 of the pizza was burned. Our friends told us that their pizza wasn't like what they usually get back in Chicago, but described it as \"edible\" so I wasn't sure if that was their way of saying that they didn't like it?\n\nThe waitress did appologize for the slow service and issues. She did also give us a discount to make up for the long wait times. My impression was that something was off the night of the May 4th for dinner service. I wondered if they were short staffed? We've never had that slow of service at Flancer's or such unimpressive  food. I doubt that I will be able to talk my Chicago friends into giving them another try. =(\n\nThis being said, I really hope that this isn't typical for Gilbert location, and that we just caught them on a bad night. We've always loved the service and great food from Mesa.", "business_id": "JMOK_Sy6aSOZwd4qgkX7hg", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-05-05", "type": "review"}

Not really what I wanted to hear but decided to come back again for lunch and try it again.  Result? Salty,salty,salty.

I mean I don't know about you, but I want to actually be able to see what I am a eating. \n\nSo after being seated and having our drink order taken, it took a minute for someone to actually come and take our order. It was kinda weird as it didn't seem to be that busy but who knows. In the end everyone ordered the fish and we all had it differently. Some had it fried, some had it baked, some had it blackened/cajun and we all either fries or onions rings. Let me just say that it was worth the wait. The fish was so moist and fried perfectly. I had a piece of the cajun as well and it was seasoned just right. Oh and the onion rings? Good lawd they were good. I am not sure what they did back there in the kitchen, but they most definitely made up for our wait. \n\nThe bill came and we were pleasantly surprised. The all you can eat fish special pretty much included the drinks for only .25 cents. Cool huh? So $13 or so dollars per person, plus tip and a VERY full stomach later, we all hobbled out of there and went back to work fat and full.

For a sports bar, I give Arena 4 stars; as a restaurant it would be 3 stars. So I went there as a group of 6 to watch NHL playoffs. For some reason I thought this was a newer place, but turns out it's a rather old local neighborhood hangout, and features an OTB. The bar/otb section was pretty dark and very loud (it was Thursday night), so we opted for the dining room. Our server was VERY friendly and accommodating - she got us a big table, and switched the TV to the Blues-Wild game for us - which is why we were there. As far as a place to watch the game, the dining room was just ok - decent view of tv, but no sound at all. The atmosphere in that room was more for dinner than watching a sports game, but since its a sports bar we didn't feel awkward cheering for our team out loud. The OTB half of the place is much better suited to games etc, but on that night we wanted a little peace to be able to focus on the game.\nWe ended up ordering a few beers, potato skins, a hamburger, 1lb of wings in secret sauce, and 2 large pepperoni pizzas. My friend had the burger and said it was good; I was able to try everything else. Gotta say, the potato skins may be the best I have EVER had. They were nice and crispy all around, and covered in lots of bacon - most places barely put a few bacon bits and serve the skins rather mushy, but not Arena. Their skins were AMAZING. I would definitely order them again. The wings were decent - typical sportsbar chicken wings; about 10 pieces made up a 1lb order. They were nice and crispy and the \"secret sauce\" was actually really good - not too spicy or sweet, just perfectly balanced. The pizza was good too, but my main gripe was the use of cornmeal on the bottom. I HATE it when pizzerias use cornmeal - that is pizza blasphemy! most places do it just so the pizza comes out of the oven easier - that is just lazy pizza skills. I've never thought that cornmeal adds a good taste to pizza, and it makes it messy. Without the cornmeal, I'd say the pizza was a good thin crust foldable NY style.... but as is, the pizza is average and just a hair above mediocre, because of the cornmeal. uggh. \nSo, for a sports bar where one would go to watch games like NHL playoffs, or bet on horses, or play bar trivia with the DJ - Arena is a good local hangout, nothing special, but effectively fulfills expectations (which should never be too high with sports bars). With lots of TVs, and games like billiards and darts etc... Arena is a fun place where you can go with friends or even just go alone if you're bored at home. It's pretty divey, but has a local neighborhood vibe that keeps it friendly. The food is not the best, but a cut-above-average for a bar - the potato skins are HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, and the wings and pizza are recommended, but with reservations. The service was excellent, and the prices were quite reasonable for the location and type of venue. You need a place to go and watch the game and devour some food? Arena is probably a very good bet - not fancy or gourmet, but local and friendly.", "business_id": "_TWT58PWunYIyPgpz1fuog", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-04-21", "type": "review"}

Just say no to lettuce.  \n\nSome other ideas for this sandwich are: Sprinkle some of that Red Robin seasoning on it. It's pretty good. Order it with a chocolate milkshake. That can't be bad.  Oh and Red Robin's has a pretty sweet deal where their French fries are all you can eat, or as I like to call it, the kids eat for free special.

To be honest, all I wanted was a honest and sincere apology from the ASSt. Manager, I now call, goober.  Sadly this is not what I received.  What's worse is the the \"regional manager\" even mentioned how this ASSt. managers so call apology, \"lacked professionalism and sincerity.\"  But what can you expect when all goober did was say how there were two sides to every story and then there was the truth as well as he was \"no longer concerned with what happened.... I am concerned with the embarrassment it may have caused.....\" wow, talk about talking about of both sides of ones mouth!  \n\nSo anyway, the regional manager's attitude is the outcome of this situation is something that is not shared because his staff deserves, \"professional courtesy\" in how it's been handled, if it's been handled.  I guess we, the customer can be antagonized by the managers as they see fit as we, the customer do not deserve any \"professional courtesy\" beside being given a check for our sometimes good food, with sometimes refilled fry's.  As far as their philosophy of \"honesty, integrity, having fun and learning from something or other\".  Well, it doesn't say anywhere on their website that these words apply to the customers and I think I've proven that neither goober, the regional manager of some other bigwig at the corporate office care about those words as they'll not even respond to my e-mails.\n\nSo will I ever darken the door of another Red Robin location,,,,,,,,,,,,  I'm sure at some point in my future I'll suffer a cerebral flatulent moment and dine in one of their locations again, but trust me, should my meal come out cold with the cheese looking like dried nasal mucus most commonly seen on a less than alive individual, the entire store, regardless of how full will know about it.", "business_id": "AgJbkqR-wre409if4fTbWQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-03-11", "type": "review"}

We've stood in line before - just for a shake to go.  \n\nAt this mall one of the other advantages here is that this isn't a part of the official food court.  It's pretty much on the other side of the mall.  So if you're there and hunger strikes - you don't have to walk to the other side of the mall.  And in this mall, that could take you awhile - longer with kids, even longer with window shopping friends.  \n\nBy the way - they have Boca burgers and Turkey burgers.  You want an egg on it?  They can make that happen.  They also have other sandwiches - from a grilled cheese to a Philly.  I suggest ending it all with a Hot Fudge sundae.  \n\nAnd after all that, you'll want to do a few laps of the mall just to breathe again of course.

We have been avoiding it because we dislike cash only establishments, unfortunately we can now avoid it because we don't much care for Ted's. \n\nI am from Upstate NY and I definately want to support bringing culturally pleasing (to me) food out to the desert. Knowing Ted's is from \"back home\" (since 1929), this encouraged me to break with our no cash only policy, besides I had to know if their hot dogs were better than the ones I import from Rochester to Arizona a few times a  year. It's expensive to bring Zweigles (since 1880) to Arizona and if there is a local replacement I was ready to find out.\n\nFirst the ordering of our food was confusing. The person on the grill heard the first two items and then started talking to others in line to take their orders and I wasn't done yet. It wasn't like I paused, it was like he just heard all he wanted from me and moved on. I had to interrupt the ordering going on after me and say, Hey! I'm not done yet. This annoyed him, obviously. But I couldn't believe it when I started to order the rest, It didn't seem like he was paying any attention becuase mid sentance he started talking cheese with the people in front of me!  Ahem... we need two white hots, two footlongs, two corn dogs, three medium logenberry's, a chocolate shake and an onion ring please...\n\nNext thing I know we are at the condiment section and the guy is putting stuff on my dogs I haven't even told him yet what I want on them!  Excuse me, I want to put Weber's mustard on that white hot. The grill guy yells over to me, \"We don't use Weber's, if you don't want yellow you can pump out the spicy mustard over by the straw station.\" \n\nThey don't use the mustard they are advertising in the window? They don't have the spicy mustard at their own condiment station? In the meantime the register girl has already totalled my order and my order hasn't even been made yet, so of course it's not correct. I said, it's not all here yet. This puzzled her. I said I am still waiitng for the corn dogs, the drinks , the onion rings and the chocolate shake. She started over and came up with a second total, also wrong. The shake came in a tiny size, they said they are one size only. Who knew.  The register girl screwed up the change as well. Good thing I didn't just swipe a card and get screwed not paying attention.\n\nWe got to the table determined to see if the food was worth the aggravation. Since the toppings were not done right and the onion rings were very undercooked and a gnarled mess I was really hoping the white hot dogs flavor would kick ass. This was my main reason for coming. It was a decent dog, but it was not better than the ones I have shipped in to my house.  Amazingly enough the best tasting of the dogs we bought were the corndogs! What a surprise. But not worth driving out to Ted's and having cash ready for them. As for the shake, it rivaled McDonalds to me and I'd be happier getting a mondo size Chocolate Peanut Butter delight from Lenny's.\n\nSo for atmosphere, service, food and cost it just doesn't rate more than the two stars I gave it. Looks like I haven't found a way to replace my multi year shipment for back east brats, dogs, etc. with a local alternative.

Once you walk in you see where the line is forming, don't be alarmed, it's really not a slow moving line, once in line you place your order you can c watch your dog (or burger, but really who goes to a HOT DOG joint to order a burger?) cooking on a grill, getting plump and nice grill marks on them! Then once it is cooked, you will be asked what you want on it, now the chili cheese dog did look great but I went for an all-beef hot dog with mayo (that's how I like it) sliced pickles, grilled onions & peppers! BOY O BOY was it good!!  My friend ordered the foot long dog with chili. We also got some french fries & their freshly handmade onion rings, which were very good. They have other types of dogs on the overhead menu, brats, polish, white?, and reg dogs and the foot long & all beef.

Both dogs were near perfect.  Some nice char on both dogs providing a good crunch. The only suggestion would be to amp up their chili a little bit.  It's pretty bland, but is otherwise fine.  I meant to get a side of hot sauce, but forgot.  I think that might have improved the chili cheese dog a bit.  The Italian sausage was mildly spicy with very good flavor. I also had the onion rings.  I thought they were very good.  Nice strong onion taste and fresh and hot.  \n\nI was there on a Saturday morning just after 11, and there at least 15 people in line ahead of me.  That being said, the line moves fairly quickly.  They are efficient at what they do - don't wait until the last second to make your decisions.  They griller will yell out well ahead in line asking what you want.  Be prepared to yell your order out to him as he'll need to be able to hear your from a little bit of a distance.  They need to do this to get the dogs on the grill for you so that by the time you get to the condiment man, your dogs will be ready.  You'll just need to repeat your order to the condiment person so he knows which ones to grab, then you tell him what you want on each one.  Then he hands your completed order off to the cashier - and your done.  By the time I left, there were at least 30 people in line.  It's a pretty popular place - with good reason.  All the staff I interacted with were very friendly.\n\nIt's a good thing for my general well-being and overall health that this place isn't closer to me.  I would eat there a lot.  As it is, it's just far enough away that I'll go maybe once every 2-3 months.", "business_id": "jJhNOhuGpIsJX5SEUFFWYQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-05-25", "type": "review"}

When we heard about this place and read some of the great reviews, we were so eager to try it. Especially when the reviews for the onion rings were so good as well. We currently live in Maricopa, AZ about 35 min drive from Ted's so we were really hoping it would be worth the drive. We were disappointed. We ordered 8 of the regular dogs, I had chili, mustard, and onions on mine. The wife and kids had just ketchup. We also ordered onion rings and a strawberry shake. The dogs themselves sure did look good when they were being cooked. I love dogs cooked on a grill and these ones were nice and crispy on the outside. But the four of us all gave them thumbs down for flavor. Very bland. Not even salt. My chili sauce was the worst I have ever had. It tasted more like tomato paste that I use as an ingredient in spaghetti sauce. The onion \"rings\" were more like \"fragments\" with them looking like scraps that were swept up off the floor. Very overcooked with very little actual onion inside because they were burned up or something. The milk shake was OK flavor, but was in like a 6 oz cup or something. Seemed way overpriced as everything else. I could not even finish my hotdogs which is probably a first in my lifetime. And it is very rare that our whole family agrees that a place is no good. The place did look kinda retro cool inside and was doing great business. But we will not be back. Oh, also the people working there looked like they were employees of a funeral home rather than fun themed hot dog joint. Total cost for 8 dogs, a powerade, strawberry shake and the order of onion \"fragments\" was almost $37! Ridiculous.", "business_id": "jJhNOhuGpIsJX5SEUFFWYQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-03-09", "type": "review"}

Unfortunately no one told me they were not accepting cards, but they did lay out a sign explaining they were unable to accept GIFT cards.

When I got to the register and handed the cashier a credit card she informed me they were not taking cards today, all of matter of factly, as if I was supposed know this before walking through the door.

Today work was extremely slow, and I found myself on Broadway. I thought why not  give Ted's a try. New to Arizona, I am on a quest to find the best Chili Dog in Phoenix and the surrounding area. It is with a heavy heart, that I say, Ted's doesn't have the best. I would rate his Chili Cheese Dog, perhaps somewhere in my top 20, but certainly not the best. \n\nFirst and foremost I'll begin with this; the service was lacking. Having been in the restaurant business for many years, my expectations are high. Upon walking in, (9:30 pm), I'm not greeted. I took initiative and greeted the grill girl. I explained that its my first time eating there. I then asked about the Chili Cheese Dog. The menu said it was $4.49. \"What do I get for $4.49?\" She then said I can have whatever I want. Right, but, you have various types of hotdogs, what kind do I get for that price? \" Um you can get all beef, I guess, and a foot-long. Or the regular.\" So for $4.49, I could choose either size hotdog, any type I want? \"Um... yeah but they're different prices.\" Ok... forget it. I'll have the All Beef Chili Cheese Dog. \"So you want chili on it?\" \n\nThere's more but I'll spare you the entire conversation. I felt like the teenyboppers had very little to offer, in terms of hospitality, knowledge of the menu, or charisma. I like to feel welcomed and when I mention I'm new, I'd like someone to volunteer some popular sellers, or a personal choice. Recommend a menu item to me. Hype it up , make my mouth water, get me just as excited as you are. Nope... Not here. \n\nFood quality was pretty good. I ordered the... well I mentioned it already. I added the onion rings and a small soft drink. They offer no free refills. They charge $0.25 per refill. If you want ranch for your rings, like I do, that's $0.59 extra. Add tax to the bill and my total came out to nearly $12. The cheese for my Chili dog was cheese sauce, like you have with your nacho's, or I could have American cheese. I would have opted for grated cheddar, but a fine establishment like Ted's doesn't  offer it. For the price, I could have gone to Twin Peaks, Portillo's or darn near anywhere else and been served a far better meal. The onion rings were tasty and Diet Dr. Pepper is always a plus. Altogether, I'm not thrilled with my experience, however, I'll give them one more try in the future. Perhaps not so close to closing time.", "business_id": "jJhNOhuGpIsJX5SEUFFWYQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-05-20", "type": "review"}

Having grown up in Buffalo, Ted's is a big deal despite the fact that it isn't very good. It's a bigger deal still on the other side of the country, where it still isn't very good. Better, maybe, because they have Buffalo kitsch on the walls, but not to the level of \"good.\"\n\nReasons: these are hot dogs. Even the best hot dog on earth can't possibly be as good as, say, the median cheeseburger. And yes, you can get a cheeseburger at Ted's for a buck or two more, and they aren't awful. You can get lots of things that aren't awful. You can also get non-awful hot dogs by grilling them yourself at $1.25 for an eight-pack.\n\nUsually the onion rings are good. Disclaimer - I used to work at Ted's. As a starting employee, I wasn't even allowed to know what was in the onion ring batter. All I knew was that making them involved someone dressing up in a garbage bag, ostensibly to keep from getting covered in batter. Anywho, this time around, the onion rings weren't even cooked through. \n\nThis, despite the grill man's comment that the girl running the fryer was the best they had. \n\nThat's saying something. Kids would walk out on the job when they got put on fryer. It's a lot to handle, and you go home with a millimeter of reduced fry oil coating all parts of your body. Even the orifices. Especially the orifices. \n\nSo then, there is also a strange and outdated system of customer service that certainly requires more labor than is necessary.
