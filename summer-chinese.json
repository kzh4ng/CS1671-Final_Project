The food tastes average and the price is good. It's your typical low-end Chinese place. \n\nThe last (and final) time I ordered here I just so happened to be picking up my order while a health inspector from allegheny county health department was making his rounds. While I was waiting on my food (which took much longer than usual) the inspector was pointing out violations. He also requested a copy of a certificate that the man behind the register was unable to produce. The inspector looked at me like I was crazy for waiting on my food despite the obvious poor conditions.  \n\nAs for the rest of the place - it's always been kind of dirty inside. The carpets are just FILTHY and the walls match. There are always children's toys scattered about the floor because the owners children are always there, so be careful not to trip. \n\nThe workers do seem like nice people just trying to make a living but when it comes to cleanliness Don Don is lacking.", "business_id": "SQ0j7bgSTazkVQlF5AnqyQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-06-10", "type": "review"}

I ordered the General Tso's chicken, and my friends ordered the sesame chicken, crab rangoon, and another appetizer (egg rolls?).  They ordered the combo with less meat, and I ordered the one with more--the names were very similar, which I found confusing. The food took quite a while to come up (~15 min.), so I'd suggest calling ahead if you're in a rush.  While we were waiting, the woman behind the counter yelled at someone over the phone in Chinese, and then at a guy who came in to pick up food for delivery (probably the same person).\n\nTo be honest, I'm not much of a fan of Americanized Chinese cuisine (I lived in Singapore for 3 mos. and have visited Hong King and Japan); it's been awhile since I've had it, and this dish reminded me why.  I don't care for the overbearing sweetness and thickness of the sauce, nor do I care for the pre-cut meat in the dishes (I like to cut up my own meat, thank you very much), so the flavors and textures don't do much for me.  Having said that, my friends claimed this was the best Americanized Chinese fare they'd had in PGH (and they live in Squirrel Hill!), so if you're a fan of this cuisine, you can take that into consideration.\n\nIf nothing else, this meal provided us with some much-needed food to absorb the alcohol from the mead, which I appreciated.", "business_id": "SQ0j7bgSTazkVQlF5AnqyQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-08-04", "type": "review"}

One of the \"special\" dishes offered tonight consisted of chicken, Yukon Gold potatoes, and some sort of sauce.  YOUKON GOLD?!!  Do you eat those potatoes with rice?  My order of Singapore noodles had French fried onions on top.  With curry powder. (I assume it was powder, because the menu promised curry but there was no sauce.)\n\n     The restaurant is half-full on a Thursday night, but noisy with at least three decades of American top-40 music blaring non-stop.  The bar is large, the beer glasses are tall and thin, but there's not  a Tsing Tao or plum wine in sight.  This is as US as a place can get.\n\n     But here's the thing:  the French fried onions are crispy and spicy. We order a $5.00 plate of garlic sugar-snap peas and that's exactly what we get:  snap peas stir-fried for not more than two minutes in a little oil, a lot of garlic and probably a pinch of salt.  This is a fresh, simple, tasty treat and it's matched by the broccoli that comes with the broccoli and chicken dish.  The sauce is blandly acceptable, but the broccoli is emerald green and abundant.  \n\n     I hate the PF Chang ritual where they mix their own special sauce for you, as though you are incapable of mixing soy and chili paste yourself.  Worse, it seems to imply that the food they're serving will be so tasteless it will need all the help it can get from this spicy concoction.  But once the wait staff departs, I just ignore the mess and forget my irritation.  Because, much as I hate to admit it, the food, although about as Asian as the plastic chop sticks they distribute, is fresh, tasty and well-presented.  The staff remembers to re-fill the water glasses.  I'd love to give this place two starts but I keep going back, so I have to give it three, or I'm a chump.  But I'll be damned if I call it an Asian food restaurant.\n\nP.S.    I probably must mention that Ben Roethlisberger was coming in to PF Changs just as I was leaving.  With a good-looking woman.

This was the hottest new place on the restaurant scene and everyone wanted to try it. Fast forward to present day and you'd never believe that was ever the case. Chang's is poorly set up as one large open room that's rather noisy. Food came out quickly but was not as good as the Chinese take out we get from sesame inn. Spicy chicken was neither spicy nor very flavorful and had a mass-produced feel to it. Took half home to eat the next day but ended up throwing it out a few days later. Normally one of the great thing about getting Chinese is looking forward to the leftovers the next day!   Another minus was noticing how dirty the floor was on the way back to the bathroom.

These are great folks, and I wish them the best of success in the future.  Remember, everyone, just because you read a negative review it does not mean that the food is bad!  Some people just have lousy taste buds, and many people have no idea what they are ordering to begin with.  Try things for yourself, and you will find some great food at Tasty!", "business_id": "Y2p07YEC8xOsYTHWf0UxiA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-08-15", "type": "review"}

Unfortunately a great deal of what is on their regular menu and with the delivery services is comprised of the American version  of Chinese food.The first time I came to this place they only gave me the American iced menu.But having lived in the Bay Area for many years I scoped out the Hong Kong style menu and vowed to order from it the next time I went to Tasty and I did.Now I just  pick up the Hong Kong menu automatically when I come in.Their Hong Kong dishes are some of the best I've had in Pittsburgh.The garlic eggplant in a velvety sauce combines the right hint of spiciness with sweet and virtually melts in your mouth.The salted squid (what's usually known as salt and pepper squid) has a light, crispy coating with a minimum of oil and the texture of the squid is\njust a tiny bit chewy but not too much so.Texture in squid is a daunting thing to get just right.I am a Chow Fun freak anyway  but their shrimp chow fun with egg sauce is the best I've ever tasted with slightly charred noodles fresh dhrimp and a wonderful egg scramble sauce . Recently I had a friend visiting from San Francisco and took him here (kind of a test to see if my view of this place was somehow off) and he raved about everything especially this chow fun dish.To sum up,if you want to experience the best of Tasty please order from the Hong Kong menu.Since. I don't order American Chinese dishes here I can't comment on them but I guess the genius of this place is authentic South Chinese dishes (as evidenced by the Chinese families I've seen eating here) not the usual  pseudo Chinese dishes many people seem to order here.I expect the chef/cook here just doesn't have his heart in Crab Rangoon or chow mein.", "business_id": "Y2p07YEC8xOsYTHWf0UxiA", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-07-31", "type": "review"}

I set up a account just for this review.  I was deeply sadden by the food I received today. \n\nI first started coming here since 1993. I have moved to Midwest four years later. However,  every times I drive thru Pittsburgh,I always stopped here. I really enjoy the general Tso' s chicken. As part of preparation, chicken was fried ahead of time,and fried again when you order, That is why their general Tso's Chicken was so crispy and aromatic when served. I did not have to make this stop, but after driving 450 miles, I wanted a decent meal.\n\nWell, I stopped by and order the Dish for carry out. When I open them(it was not long, 30 minutes or less), they were so soggy, and based on my experience who grew up on Chinese food, it was not fried the second time. The difference? They tasted worse than Buffet dish sitting above the steamer for hours. \n\nFurthermore, I have ordered the shrimp with garlic sauce. Shrimp was hard to chew. It seems like the shrimp the simmered in the sauce for ages. There was no aroma from garlic or onion. \n\nBeing a decent cook myself, I can tell you those dishes I ordered were not cooked by the main chef, or secondary chef. I suspect this is  probably made by the guy who station the fryer. Truly, the taste of those two dishes were so awful, I toss them out. I purchase those passing Pittsburgh, not really possible asking for refund.\n\nI have had so much memory with this place. Rest assured, I won't be coming ever. It was so bad, I would not dear to try again. \n\nI do hope the owner sees this, and make a statement of this incident. I eager to see you standby your dishes again. If I see owner's rebuttal, I would love to call the owner to discuss this encounter further, and willing to be convinced to come back.\n\nSincerely", "business_id": "hbFCv2Rginf9zjai-lKUNg", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-07-07", "type": "review"}

I don't care if the previous reviewer thinks that this place is Americanized Chinese food--I love it!    As I've said on other reviews, I like my food kind of plain, so I love the Sesame Chicken or the Chicken Broccoli.  I figure that if a place can get the basics right, then they can do the more complicated dishes.  My husband Rick likes his food a little spicier.  His favorite is the Kung Pao Shrimp.  Once when I was feeling bold, Rick and I split an order of Crispy Whole Fish with Homemade Spicy Hunan Sauce.  Spicy?  I think I saw through time after trying it!\n\nOne dish I'm going to try someday is Three's Company.  No, it does not feature Joyce DeWitt, John Ritter, or Suzanne Summers.  It is  Lemon Chicken, General Tso's Chicken and Chicken with Vegetables.  For the vegetarian-inclined, they have Soy Protein with Cashew Nuts, Soy Protein with Curry Sauce, and Wheat Gluten with Garlic Sauce.  Uh, no thanks!  I'll stick to my chicken dishes!  \n\nChina Palace features a full bar, but since I'm a diabetic, I usually stick to my tea.  Plus my drink of choice (Bailey's with Coffee) probably would not go well with Chinese food!  On the whole, China Palace is a place for wonderful Chinese food and definitely worth a visit if you are in the area.\n\nNow should I try one of their other specialties, Three Afire?", "business_id": "Q9BXMPu2HnRDMq9X_2rHrQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-06-03", "type": "review"}

Once I saw the extensive menu, with vast vegetarian selections, I realized that there is hope for a vegetarian in need of a quick fix. And I have found the food to be well above average American-Chinese takeout . \n\nI really like the chewy consistency of their soy protein. I am a fan of chewy...I know it's not for everybody. \n\nThey do have brown rice! At least, they do now, and it's mighty good. A little chewy, too. \n\nLast night, I tried the \"Sizzling Sensation\" wheat gluten (mock beef). The sauce was not as spicy or peppery as I would have liked, but it was flavorful and the texture of the gluten was pleasantly soft and chewy (not as hard as the soy protein, though my dining companion who is not a fan of the chewy likened it to gristle). I also had the broccoli with garlic sauce, which is the dish I usually count on in Chinese fare, and it was a delicious compliment to the other dish. Unlike the broccoli and garlic sauce of most places, the broccoli was not swimming in goop and it actually tasted garlicky and even tangy. The broccoli was crisp and fresh. The meal was entirely satisfying and I will order both of these dishes again. \n\nSpeaking of dishes, one entree that I can warn against is the \"Taro Bowl A-La-King.\" Looks and tastes as if cooked in dish water... \n\nIf you do not like greasy food, order from the selection of steamed dishes, or \"weight watchers\" items. That goes for just about anywhere! \n\nDelivery from China Palace has been quick in my experience, almost unbelievably so! In-house service is also quick and notably friendly.", "business_id": "Q9BXMPu2HnRDMq9X_2rHrQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-06-23", "type": "review"}

She's just not cut out for waiting tables, or interacting with people in general.  My minimum tip is $5, even at the cheapest places.

When I first moved to Pineville in 2001 this was just somewhere close to eat cheaply. At that time they did not have the sushi chef.\n\nThe Chinese Buffet:\nNothing to write home about. Nothing here is truly worth mentioning. Just your standard Chinese buffet fare mostly covered i thick, syroupy sauces and probably very unhealthy. Nothing is particularly good but nothing is particularly bad either.\n\nThe Sushi Buffet:\nThis is why you want to come here (unless you're a sushi snob because no matter what you''re just not gonna be happy)! All you can eat sushi for around $10 (which also includes the Chinese buffet portion but let's pretend it doesn't for the heck of it). This is pretty unbeatable given that the sushi is freshly made throughout the day. Yes, I do agree that the presentation plates could be wiped off between servings on the fried pieces with heavy sauces but not all their offering has tick coatings of sauces. So, in my case, I don't eat those. I like them... but I chose to eat the ones that are not covered in thick sauces and look more presentable.\n\nTony, the sushi chef (I don't know the other guys'  name but thank god he's rarely if ever there) is really cool. He's very engaging with his customers, he remembers your name and your family. He greets you openly and warmly and is always ready to offer suggestions on new things to try. Remember to tip him well even if you don't touch the Chinese food (I usually don't, except for the egg drop soup)\n\nThe staff is very serviceable and are constantly refilling your glass and cleaning your table. They speak very little English but enough to understand what you want should you be the pesky customer who needs everything customized in a buffet style restaurant. Unfortunately, as someone else say, they do have the very rude tendency of always getting in the way and NEVER giving the customer the right of way. They cut in front of you and make you stop or go around them instead of them doing so for the customer. This is what knocked one star.\n\nObviously the staff has changed through the years. I remember a couple of waitresses throughout the years that were really nice and helpful. They got to know my little girls and tried teaching them how to eat with chop sticks. So, my, and Becky's, kids all love it here. This is definitely a good place to take children since they can pretty much try a bunch of things without worrying about not liking it (This is, after all, where my, at the time, 5 year old fell in love with Ikura). The owner, although in all the time I've been going has never once acknowledged that I am a regular (sometimes twice to three times a month) regular, seems rather unfriendly and, actually, kinda sour. I don't know if he is or not... but he doesn't seem very welcoming, warm or friendly. Not that it bothers me, I don't care, I'm there to eat... but I noticed it.\n\nThe decor is a mix of traditional chinese with some modern lighting and tacky foreign cluelessness (yes, I just made all that up but when you see it it'll make sense). And the place is very clean except for the ice cream machine which doesn't get enough TLC from the staff.\n\nThis is a great place to come and have lunch once in a while if you work in the area or have kids who want to try Chinese or have sushi lovers (not snobs) who want good sushi for free. But this is not the type of place that you will be making special trips to visit. Try to avoid dinner as it gets rather expensive without any appreciable additions to the buffet.", "business_id": "5p3Tqyp19UowO0-dAFvxMw", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-06-07", "type": "review"}

The brown rice was good and chewy, and spring rolls served piping hot and crispy, straight from the fryer.\n\nIt may not be the most authentic international cuisine you'll ever eat, but when pressed for time and watching your budget, Soho is as great as anything you could want.\n\nOne last thing - be care with the address!

He had the Chicken and Broccoli (He ALWAYS has the chicken and broccoli!) and seemed to enjoy. We split an order of crab rangoon and it was pretty decent too. It wasn't exactly complex in flavor, but it's tough to screw up crab and cream cheese deep fried in wontons. I had a General Tso's combination and I can best describe my impression as underwhelmed. The chicken was a little to crunchy/chewy for my taste and the sauce was not as spicy as a like my general tso's but I suppose these are both excusable if they happen to be your taste. \n\nWhat was not excusable, and really what is prompting me to write this review, was the egg roll. The only reason I was craving Chinese so badly was because I wanted an egg roll. You know how boiled cabbage can be kind of odiferous? Well imagine a wonton wrapper which contained nothing (no egg, no pork, no nothing) but cabbage that smelled, not mildly, of parade route (anyone who has ever marched behind mounted cavalry knows what I mean).

My husband would just assume not eating it and leaving but I am a little more forward and expect good food when I pay to go out so I went to the owner that usually stands in front of the restaurant and let her know very discretly and  nicely that all 4 of us were unhappy with the quality of food. She then told me that there is NO WAY that I could be unhappy because her food is the best and always fresh.  She very loudly walked to our table and stuck her hands in my sons chicken fried rice and ate it....agreed it was a little dry and would only give us our money back for the 2 cheapest meals although she could clearly see all 4 dishes were untouched.....UNACCEPTABLE and so so UNPROFESSIONAL!!!! Fried rice tasted like it had been sitting there for 10 days and you couldn't taste the difference in my husbands beef with garlic sauce and my hunan chicken.  The chicken wings use to be one of the highlights of going here. NOT ANYMORE.  I read today in south charlotte weekly that they recieved a grade of 90.

My first visit was a bust because they were closed but this time was perfect....a rainy Saturday afternoon what could be better than Chinese food?!!?\n\nI'm a little ashamed to say the reason I've been so anxious to try this place, it's for the chicken wings. Yep. I said chicken wings. They offer them as a side here!!!\n\n Say What!?!? \n\nThe menu is simple, you chose a meat and then a sauce to accompany them. They have your pretty standard variety of meats: chicken, shrimp, beef, scallops, tofu etc. However, the selection of sauces is great. There are tons of options to tickle your tastebuds. \n\nI started with the vegetable soup. It was pretty standard. A really good broth and steamed crunchy veggies and tofu. The crackers that they served with the soup were very interesting. I'm used to the wonton strips; but these crackers were crispy  and blended well with the soup. \n\nFor my meal I chose the Dual (two meats) with chicken and shrimp. I went with the steamed rice, chicken wings as my side (of course) and added an egg roll. I kept it simple and picked the spiced brown sauce with broccoli with a request to make it extra spicy. \n\nThe food was out in no time. The brown sauce was really good, not as spicy as I hoped but still very tasty. The chicken and shrimp were plentiful. In every bite I had either a piece of chicken or shrimp and the broccoli was cooked perfectly. The egg roll was pretty standard, but still tasty. And those chicken wings that I had been waiting to try....were as great as I expected. Super crispy, cooked just the right way and they were actually seasoned really well. Totally worth the hype. \n\nService was great and the prices were just right. I definitely recommend giving this place a try!", "business_id": "IKUVWL75eSoC71G2fBphmA", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-08-19", "type": "review"}

The food isn't bad, it's GOOD. They give you a lot for a good price. Don't expect genuine Chinese food, this is American Chinese food -- just like most Chinese restaurants in this country. \n\nNow here's the hangup I have with Taipei South. Customer service is lacking. The ladies that work the front aren't mean people at all, so let me make that point. But it's always a mixed bag. Sometimes orders are quickly placed, drinks always topped off, and food comes out quickly. But other times it can be the opposite. I'll use my last visit as an example:\n\nThe waitresses said little to nothing (which is the usual case). They did bring out a little jar of Dr Pepper so I could refill my cup faster, but the waitress at one point came by and took the jar and used it to refill another customers drink who didn't even know I had been using that jar... Then she put it back on my table. It was also past peak lunch hour (1:45 and 1/3 full) yet I waited 12 minutes by the time I got my check to when I got the receipt.\n\nReally this place just needs to be more hospitable. It would go a LOOONG way. Maybe they're content with where they're at? I'm sure they do fine since they serve good food. But it's no secret friendly and unforgettable service creates a memorable experience for the customer, something that causes them to always come back.

I recommend the lettuce wraps, they're the shit, and the Honey Shrimp is pretty damn tasty too.  The honey shrimp reminds me a lot of Chicken McNuggets ( maybe its the way their fried, maybe its their colorartion and shape, or maybe I'm secretly yearning for those mini-paddys of chicken scraps fried in peanut oil and dipped in sweet n sour sauce...either way i digress) and the Honey flavor, so crisp... so sweet...what a treat.  Even if your girlfriend orders them before you, still get them their the best things on the menu.\n\nI got the Moo-Goo Gai Pan, ( becuase I was the last to order and everyone else had already ordered the good shit, and I didn't want to look like a poser, so I orderd, well you know)  and it was a little bland, but they have a delicious \"special\" sauce that our waitress said she made herself, and it helped the flavor out alot.\nIf you are in the South Park area check out PF Chang's, or if you have a  first date this would be a great place, because the decor and lighting create a feeling of wealth and exclusivity, but the prices are very manageable, and the food is better than average.", "business_id": "4CPrhBc4Ado90fj7PG6jrA", "stars": 3, "date": "2007-06-05", "type": "review"}

Not horrible, and definitely not spectacular, but just okay. \n\nWe sat at the bar and the best part of our experience here was the bubbly bartender and the lone businessman sitting next to us. We had good conversation with them. But hey, you are reading this for a food review. So here goes:\n\nHot N Sour soup = pretty good. I must now admit that I have some insight into the land of PF Chang's, considering I used to be an employee at a NY location. Let's all be serious here; it's a chain, the mcdonald's of chinese food. The kitchen just pumps the meals out, and you will notice that you can have anything on the menu sitting in front of you within 5 or 6 minutes, minus the chilean seabass. They are so busy, and spit the food out so fast, it just isn't the kind of place that you are going to get a quality meal. \n\nI do recommend the mongolian beef - the mongolian sauce is excellent. Just be prepared for your hands and feet to swell given the sodium levels in this thing - out of control. I also always get the ma po tofu - this was the dish that got me into tofu in the first place, considering I never used to be able to say the word 'tofu' without gagging. It's very tasty, a bit crispy, and in a spicy/garlicky sauce with steamed broccoli. A third and final recommendation is the lemon pepper shrimp - again, the sauce is what makes this dish. If you have room for dessert, do yourself a favor and order the banana spring rolls - it's a night ender, but so worth it!\n\nI didn't find any yucky bugs in my meal, but I will say this: I've worked in plenty of restaurants, fancy and not, and I've seen them everywhere - it is inevitable that roaches will infiltrate. It's pretty unavoidable. That is disturbing though that it made it all the way onto your plate - a quality restaurant, a CLEAN restaurant, will take care of the problem right away before it gets that out of hand, and obviously PF Chang's is just not on that scale.", "business_id": "4CPrhBc4Ado90fj7PG6jrA", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-08-26", "type": "review"}

And actually it seemed like the food we had at PF Chang's were clones of your neighborhood Chinese buffets. We had Mongolian beef because it seems like they said it's one of the best but what I had was a beef stewed in sweet soy sauce with tons of chives. We also had the Cantonese shrimp which was very bland and didn't taste a thing. I say, it is overrated add to that over priced for such a taste.

We typically steer-clear of chain restaurants, but we always make an exception for PF Changs.  We've been going there for years and we have never had a bad meal.  There are some dishes that we like better than others, but we have never had a sub-par dining experience.   The food is consistently good and the service is always excellent.\n\nMy husband and I dined at PF Changs last night (Saturday night) and we brought another couple with us.  I made online reservations earlier in the day and had no trouble getting the time that I wanted (6:30).   When we arrived, the parking lot was expectedly full so we took advantage of the free valet parking.  The restaurant was very, very busy...there people waiting outside as well.  We arrived just after 6:30 and they had us seated within 5 minutes.  \n\nWe started with drinks...Blue Moon for my husband, Asian Pear Mojito for me (Delicious!!!!), Bacardi & Coke and Red Wine for our friends.  \n\nFor appertizers, we ordered Pork Dumplings and Chicken Lettuce Wraps.  When the runner brought the Chicken Lettuce Wraps, he made a comment that the 4 of us shouldn't have to share just one dish...so a few minutes later he arrived with another dish (and more lettuce), on the house.  Very nice way to start off our meal!   To me, it's those types of gestures that kicks PF Changs up a notch or two and we have had a handful of these types of gestures over the years.   The lettuce wraps were hot, fresh, flavorful, and delicious!  The Pork Dumplings were also very tasty!\n\nOn to the entrees...\n\nTuna Tataki Crisps for me.  They are so excellent!  Round, fried wonton as the vessel, topped with Seared Ahi Tuna topped with diced Ahi tuna, cucumber and scallions tossed in a citrus-sesame soy sauce.  The crisp wonton and the soft tasty tuna are perfect together!  \n\nMongolian Beef for my husband.  This is the best Mongolian Beef that we have found to date.  The sauce is scrumptious, the meat is lean, tender and moist, and the scallions add a nice freshness to the dish.\n\nOur friends ordered Orange Peel Chicken and Dan Dan Noodles and they both loved their dishes!\n\nFor the table to share...\n\nGarlic Noodles (my favorite).  I CRAVE these Noodles!  The menu describes this dish as \"Egg noodles tossed with garlic and chili pepper flakes\".  However, that description doesn't do it justice.  The noodles are tender, the sauce is savory, but not too powerful and it has a touch of sweetness, and it's topped with julienned cucumber and fresh Cilantro.  Outstanding served fresh, even better eaten cold (out of the fridge) the next day....if it makes it that long!   I've been known to order an extra to take to a cookout the next day.\n\nPork Fried Rice (my husband's favorite).  Everyone has their fried rice preferences.  For us, we don't like sticky fried rice, we don't like it over seasoned (over salty), and we don't like too many veggies (especially the frozen peas and carrots that most take-out establishments like to use).  Chang's Fried Rice is made with egg, julienne carrots, bean sprouts, sliced scallions, and just the right amount of soy sauce.  Perfect!\n\nWe completed our meal with a couple of dessert minis...Tiramisu and Lemon Dream.  Both were tasty and just the right size following a big meal.  \n\nExcellent meal, once again.  We all left full, satisfied, and happy.  We will continue to dine to PF Changs over and over again.  Yes, we really love it that much.  The dishes may not be \"authentic', but there is something to be said for consistently delicious Asian-inspired food.  For us, PF Changs is the restaurant equivalent of a familiar and reliable friend.  We all have many acquaintances that we enjoy, but the reliable friends are few and far between.\n\nP.S.

My family always orders this dish in various locations and this was by far the worst. \n\nDelay and food preparations aside, what really sets me off is that I not only waited 45 min to receive my food (altogether the preparation time was well over 60min), I have received nothing from the management as an apology but plenty of negative attitude.\n\n Maybe I am spoiled but in every P.F.

I had a reservation so as soon as I walked in I was greeted and seated at our table. Everyone was so friendly and fast. We let our waitress know that we needed to be out of there by a certain time to catch our movie and she did her best to accommodate us. They had an awesome special for $40 for 2 people. It comes with 2 soups, an appetizer, 2 entrees, 2 bowls of rice and a Dessert (2 Wontons). We both ordered the Wonton Soup which was soooo delicious. I'd never had it before. I was surprised to find the shrimp in it. For our appetizer we ordered the Dynamite Shrimp and an extra appetizer of the Calamari. The shrimp were really good. The sauce they put on them didn't have too much kick but it was flavorful. The Calamari on the other hand I could have done with. Not that great but still edible. It was cut into thin pieces. kind of like short french fries. Not great. Their entrees are Family Style, so we ordered the Beef w/Broccoli and Sesame Chicken and both of us got Brown Rice which came with the entree. The Rice was super dry and boring. It tasted literally like they took raw brown rice and cooked it not adding anything to it. The Sesame chicken was just ok. We even told our waitress that we didn't really care for it. She just said oh and walked away. The showstopper was the Beef w/Broccoli. It was super yummy!! Bold flavors with big pieces and filling. This was the only thing that helped us leave floating on a cloud. The wontons dessert was a ripoff. I guess this is where they save money in the deal. They give you two wontons, one of ours was half the size of the other. I noticed it immediately and grabbed the bigger piece :-). They were pretty good though. Melt in your mouth.

The spring rolls were light, fresh and deep fried to perfection, and served with a great dipping sauce. As for the wonton soup, one of the best of have had. The broth had an amazing flavor and came with three chicken stuffed wontons, spinach and thinly sliced eggs.\n\nAs for the entrees, we ordered the Beijing Duck, duck served with plum sauce, cucumbers, scallions and thin light pancakes, and Chicken and Shrimp with mixed vegetables in a brown sauce.\nthe Chicken and Shrimp was a large portion, allowing me to have left-overs Monday night, and was delicious. They do not skimp on the protein. As for the veggies, too many I cannot even recall, but they were cooked to perfection.\nAs for the duck, I am not a huge duck fan, but I did make one pancake and enjoyed it very much.

He really could care less if you have or had a problem. He is nice upfront until an issue arises!

After a \"FEW\" wrong orders one evening I decided to call it back in. After The delivery took 45mins beyond what we were told initially I got nothing but attitude from the young man and was told that What I received is what I ordered. No it wasn't! Still had the paper that we write our orders on and called in with. After I was politely told by him that I must have thought we ordered the other stuff he says that they will send the driver back out but would be about an hour and asked for us to pay the 5.47 difference in price and return the other meal. Maybe it's just me but that's bad business! We had 3 people there to eat as I explained to him and now for everyone to eat together there food would be cold as well as the inconvenience. This happened several times recently as I have said but the COMPLETE ATTITUDE this young man always has when there is a problem makes thus past Friday my last meal from them. Mrs. Nancy and her husband(Assuming they are still the owners) that owned wok Bo are great people I only hope that they see how detrimental to the business this guy is before its to late! I would live to have the old wok-Bo back it was by far a favorite but my business will not return until this young man is gone!

We were expecting more of a fried shrimp in a hot sauce (like bang bang shrimp) but it was a dish with very few shrimp literally swimming in a super sweet sauce, more like a sweet and sour sauce that was very watery.  It was barely edible.  Everything else we ate - sesame chicken, mu shu pork, dumplings, egg rolls, lo mein and fried rice was all delish!  I did hear the counter lady tell someone the fried rice has MSG in it.  I'm not sure what other menu items have MSG but I stuck with the steamed rice rather than the fried.", "business_id": "O6fEzyH0fRP7r8IbSnCgoA", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-08-01", "type": "review"}

I require a side dish of epinephrine if I eat crab, so I appreciate this omission. Now that I have established that I go here just for the cream cheese puffs, it should be clear that I'm far from an expert on Asian food. So take the rest of my review with a grain of salt; there should be plenty to spare in your entree. \n\nI used to think this place was ok -- it still has plenty of variety, a very friendly staff, good chili-garlic sauce, decent potstickers, above-average lettuce wraps, no grisly or fatty pieces of meat -- but lately the preparation has been sloppy and the presentation just as bad. I suspect the quality of the ingredients has come down a notch. \n\nAfter cream cheese wontons, Pad Thai is one of my favorite Asian entrees. My last order looked like Goldilocks's porridge in the \"Three Little Bears\" Golden Book I had as a kid. Dull gray, soupy, greasy, salty and watery, yet somehow sticky. The chopped peanuts added no crunch at all, which is too bad because other than the chicken pieces I picked through the mess to find, I was hoping to find something else edible. Epic fail on this entree. \n\nOn my next visit, I ordered the Firecracker noodles with chicken, as a side to my beloved wontons. Slight improvement from last time but still salty as the Dead Sea and enough grease to de-squeak every door hinge on the west side. The bag was so heavy I skipped my biceps workout for a week. The red peppers had no life left. Again, I hunted and pecked for the chicken, which is consistently decent-quality, well-prepared white meat. My wife's veggie fried rice would have been ok -- they ease up on the salt and Valvoline for this entree -- but the vegetables were overcooked and charred in places. Fresh veggies should present as a bright spectrum of colors -- orange from the carrots, bright green from the scallions, broccoli and pea pods, yellow from the corncobettes. Instead, however, they were the same brown color as the fried rice. \n\nMy last fortune cookie said I'll probably return to Chin's. It's on the way home from work, the food comes out fast and I can't resist those damn cream cheese wontons.

It's like one person owns all these Chinese restaurants or something. But let's get to Flaming Wok's food, their dough on the dumplings are slightly a little thicker than I would like but their dipping sauce is awesome and consistent. It has this smoky flavor to it that just makes it so tasty dipping the dumplings in to. If you're picky about your dumpling sauce and like it smokey I'd recommend the dumplings here. I tried their Dragon & Phoenix and it is pretty good. This has been the ONLY Chinese take-out that passes the fried rice test. My brother and I judge harshly when we go to Chinese restaurants and he always jokes about the fried rice test. The fried rice here is actually flavorful and a little smoky with all the right flavors and bits of roast pork or char siu in it. It is the only place I have found so far that has good fried rice. Most place have I have been to fail the simple fried rice test.\n\nEvery time I make my own fried rice at home it's always guaranteed to be gone. That's a measurement of how good your fried rice taste. The majority of places just throw a little salt or soy sauce into their rice and throw on-top some steamed vegetables and a little chicken meat or eggs and then call it good and label it fried rice. It is disappointing in the amount of terribly made fried rice at the majority of Chinese take-out restaurants. If you want fried rice done correctly this is the ONLY place to get it that does it right in Madison.

She's been coming here for several years so I knew that this place had something going for it, and boy it really did. For our lunch stop, we ordered the general tso's chicken, kung pao chicken, and the house special chow mein. All were above average, but the general was beyond expectations. The breaded chicken pieces were out of this world-- soft, pillowy (yes pillowy) and simply addicting with each bite. If you're into Chinese like I am, you know that many general tso's chicken dishes tend to be overly breaded, crusty, and include questionable chicken parts rolled into one. Not this place! You gotta check it out. As for the kung pao & house special, they both could have had more umff and kick to it, but good nonetheless.\n\nThe only thing we worried about as we enjoyed our 3 dishes was the lack of patrons. We got here just before 2pm on a Wednesday and there was only one customer and a few pickup orders. What's the dealio Madison? I've been to nearly all the Chinese joints in Madison and this place for sure ranks pretty high. To our assurance, the lady owner said they were swamped the other day so that made us feel slightly better. \n\nBesides the great food, their prices are more than reasonable and the service is genuinely inviting. The lunch menu doesn't include anything over $5.95, which includes an entree, rice, and soup.

This has become ours, in Madison. \n\nWe tried 3 or 4 others - including Rubys - and none of them could pass our litmus: it must be able to produce a decent General Tso's Chicken that isn't too sweet or gooey with a modicum of heat, the egg rolls must be fried in clean oil and we should never see canned vegetables. \n\nSo far, they have satisfied. The General Tso's is by far better than anything we have come across in Madison - and no, the chicken has not been spoiled for us. The battered coating before fry is not too heavy and the sauce has a little bit of heat. Personally I would like more chilis, but I realize that is an acquired taste. \n\nMu Shui style pork with plum sauce and pancakes has been fine, not dry and overcooked, and no sight of canned vegetables. Cold sesame noodles were the lightly dressed vinegar kind, not the peanut butter sauce kind. But they were fresh, not gloopy. Looking forward to trying other dishes on the menu but so far, it's been good. This has made us very happy, since we have always enjoyed Asian cuisines wherever we have lived (San Francisco, New York) and Madison seemed to have been devoid of decent Cantonese/Hunan/Szechuan style Chinese food. \n\nSure, it isn't Wu Leng Yi but it is quite adequate for those long work days when you get home and just don't want to cook.

It's seriously neon.\n\nI ordered the eggplant chicken special. I was very excited after recently having some excellent garlic eggplant from Green Jade. I thought, \"Yay! Eggplant Special! Happy Grace!\" \n\nAs it turns out, I celebrated a bit too soon. The eggplant wasn't thoroughly cooked, making it sort of bitter and tough. Also, they didn't use Chinese eggplant, which was sort of confusing. It was American (globe) eggplant. If it had been Chinese eggplant, I bet it would've tasted a whole lot better. Furthermore, it was advertised as 'spicy.' Ahem. That dish was not spicy in the least. It could've used a few hearty splashes of sriracha. (Coincidentally, that's what I plan to do to the leftovers...)\nI also got egg-drop soup, which was alright. However, I got some fried noodles with my soup, and was even further disappointed. They were stale and not very good. On the plus side, Husband's duck and broccoli special tasted excellent! The duck wasn't deboned in the least, and seemed like it had just been hacked apart, but after working around the bones, the taste rocked.\n\nThe service was fast and friendly enough, and the prices were very low - both of us got specials and I got my soup for $12 total.

We were craving pho, and normally we go to Cravings for that but he had come here with his boss and swore it was better here. Noting the couple in front of us eating the beef version of pho I got excited. We ordered the seafood pho.\n\nWhen it came I noticed there was something immediately wrong: the noodles looked suspiciously like Top Ramen egg noodles instead of rice noodles but I dug in cos I was so hungry. My boyfriend was a little annoyed since he had gotten something completely different. It also had no garnish (bean sprouts, basil), no lime, and there was no oil that normally comes in the soup. \n\nWhen we inquired the lack of garnish or lime, we were informed by a very nervous waitress that our pho was \"special\". We then asked for srirarcha (sp?) and got a tiny dollop of it. All in all we paid $16 for beef Top Ramen with seafood floating in it. It was very salty and unpleasant. I felt disgusted that I actually ate half since I was so hungry.\n\nMultiple theories as to why we were treated this way. The couple in front of us had the beef pho and it had the garnish and the lime/oil and rice noodles.\n\n1) We didn't look Asian enough: I'm Filipino Italian (look at my profile picture) and my boy is Filipino but could pass for Latino sometimes. They were too cheap to serve us the real thing or thought they could get away with serving us the ramen since we \"didn't know any better anyway\".\n\n2) They were out of ingredients and were too lazy to bother telling us  and offer alternatives or a refund.\n\n3) A combination of number 1 and 2.\n\nI guess it serves us right for going into a Chinese restaurant for pho but Cravings serves multiple Asian dishes as well and they got it right. What made us the most angry is the fact that the Asian couple in front of us got exactly what they wanted and we left unsatisfied. My boy swears he got good soup there but his boss is more Asian looking and could be the reason why they got it right.

I finally had the opportunity to try it out after suggesting it to a roommate over other options.\n\nSince I've reviewed another Chinese restaurant and hope to continue doing so, I decided it would be best to get the same dish (General's Chicken).  I know this is not traditional Chinese but it is a common dish and is one of my favorites.\n\nThe first difficulty I had with Peking Garden is ordering.  They do not have a website and it is not easily found online.  Luckily I was able to find one on campusfood.com.  Next, I noticed that the entrees were sort of expensive (my dish was $10.90 with tax).  This isn't too outrageous as the portions were relatively large but there are plenty of other, cheaper options in the area.\n\nAfter finding the menu and placing the order over the phone, I was told it would only be about 10 minutes until our food was ready.  When we arrived around 10 minutes later, our food was waiting for us at the front counter.  One thing that I did not care for right away was that the rice for both of our orders was included in one container.  This isn't a huge deal but would have been easier for us had they been separate.   \n\nMy meal had pretty good flavor, though it wasn't as spicy as other places.  Despite the flavor, both my roommate and I noticed that the chicken was tough to the point it was chewy.  This is probably the biggest reason for my 3-star rating as almost all other Chinese I have had has been very tender.\n\nOverall the meal was good but I doubt that I will be returning to Peking Garden anytime soon.", "business_id": "M5E7DW8rqI4v37HhD2pzGQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-06-26", "type": "review"}

If you walk into Peking Garden and they hand you that menu with the classic Americanized dishes (General Tso's chicken, lo mien, fried rice, etc.), tell them that you actually want to see the menu with the traditional, true-blue Chinese dishes (squid, sea cucumber, etc.).  Unfortunately, I can't vouch for the Americanized food items as I've never tasted them.  \n\nHowever, there IS just one thing that makes this restaurant GOLDEN in my book: Peking Garden is the ONLY Chinese restaurant in the Champaign-Urbana area (to my knowledge) where you can eat a very specific type of traditional Chinese cuisine called hot pot (sometimes called shabu-shabu in Japanese restaurants).  If you've never eaten hot pot before, let me explain the general idea: a portable stove and miniature pot of boiling broth will be brought to your table.  You will also be given plates of raw vegetables, meat, and noodles.  You toss whatever you want to eat into the pot, wait a few minutes, and then start serving the soup from your table.  Definitely a treat during winter months, and worth a try for adventurous diners!    \n\nI haven't tried too many other dishes here, but I did order dumplings once, and have been requesting them on visits ever since.  Usually most Asian restaurants (even the Chinese ones) sell what I consider Japanese or Korean dumplings.  The outside dough is paper-thin, indicating that the dumplings were probably bought frozen instead of prepared in-store.  At Peking Garden, the dumpling dough is thick and chewy, the way Chinese dumplings are SUPPOSED to be!  The meat filling is still a little plain (just ground pork and a few carrots, nothing special), but the dough wrappers are FO' REAL!\n\nThe interior decor is that faded '80s look that seems to plague a lot of the restaurants in this area.  You can't really tell if the evening mood lighting is actually mood lighting or if they just didn't bother to fix some broken bulbs.  I wouldn't recommend this place for a romantic rendezvous, but it could be fun for friends eating in large groups.\n\nEverybody loves Lai Lai or Golden Harbor, and while the menus at those restaurants are a good deal larger, Peking Garden does have its own unique specialty, the hot pot.  If you're not sure what to do when you get there, stare at the tables of Chinese diners, follow their lead, and you won't be disappointed!", "business_id": "M5E7DW8rqI4v37HhD2pzGQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-08-24", "type": "review"}

It was not bad by any means, but I have tried better Mongolian beef dishes. \n\nI think the service is a five stars although I only had a limited experience with it on my pick-up order. The staff took my phone order accurately and quickly, understanding all of the items I requested, which was a pleasant surprise. I was given an ETA of my food being ready for pickup within 10 minutes after ordering. I found my order already done when I went to pick it up about 15 minutes after my call.

I ended up using my own soy sauce because of some sketchy ingredients in the soy sauce packets. (see my picture below) Also, the fortune cookies were a bit stale, you can bend it back and forth because of the moisture.

The outdoor area was filled with people sipping drinks and waiting to be seated and the vibe felt really hip and urban, just like the artwalk taking place in the surrounding streets. \n\nThere was a wait for a table, so we put our name down. As many reviewers have already mentioned, the hostess isn't particularly warm and is actually a bit snippy. I don't think it makes the place seem more desirable if the staff is aloof and plays hard to get, but hey, maybe some people fall for that. We then walked over to get a drink at the bar. I tried the Pad Thai martini (a mix of lemongrass and basil, I think it was). It was strong, for sure, but for $12, I expected a slightly larger portion. The flavor was also really strong (very herbal) and not particularly tasty. \n\nWe were seated inside after about 20 minutes of waiting, which wasn't too bad given how busy the area was for First Friday. Unfortunately, however, we were seated at this high, communal table - across from each other, but sandwiched (literally) between two other parties. We didn't necessarily have a problem with this arrangement, but what did piss us off was how *ridiculously* uncomfortable the bar stools were. They were made out of this hard metal criss-cross material and literally dug into the backs of our thighs. My husband commented that they should have sat on them before they decided they would make sense for seating during a meal. On a positive note, the inside was decorated in this really cool urban-loft style and being so close to the kitchen created a really homey feel (although on this 110-degree night, we couldn't \"stand the heat\" but couldn't really \"get out of\" or away from the kitchen). \n\nOur server was friendly enough and the food was definitely decent. For our appetizer, we tried the Thai spring rolls - the rice paper was the right softness and the dipping sauce was awesome, but the rolls were literally stuffed with vermicelli and contained just one miniscule shrimp each. The entrees - the shrimp sesame salad and chicken Xa ho Fun noodles - were definitely good but nothing mindblowing. The veggie selection in the noodles seemed random and not necesarily well-thought-out. The sauce on the noodles was tasty and perfectly spicy, but there was too much of it, so the noodles got kind of soggy. The salad was also overdressed, and the dressing was too salty. However, the shrimp in the salad was amazing quality - we've had a lot of bad shrimp here in Phoenix, so this was a huge plus. To sum it up, for every positive we encountered in our food, there was a drawback. \n \nActually, now that I stop and think about it, the whole negative-for-every-positive thing kind of describes our whole experience at Fate. We loved the bar area but weren't big fans of the drinks. We appreciated the cool vibe of waiting outside a house to be seated but weren't thrilled with how inhospitable the hostess was. We thought the inside of the restaurant was well-presented but hated the imprints those horrible stools left on our thighs. We thought some aspects of the food were great but that others were sub-par. Didn't love all of it, but didn't hate all of it.

If you can't sit at the bar, there are other tables and chairs on the patio as well as a sofa. Good selection of drinks, and the DJ was playing some righteous chill tunes.

For lunch I set out to find a restaurant on McDowell. The neighborhood looked a little sketchy and the parking was minimal. I pulled in a lot which turned out to be the incorrect parking for the place I was visiting. Maybe it was a sign because the other place appeared to be closed, so I headed back toward the car and noticed I was in the parking lot for The Gourmet House of Hong Kong. I was hungry and I like Chinese, so why not? \n\nThe place didn't look that big on the outside, but it was very spacious inside. You walk in through the kitchen and the staff takes you into a large dining room. I also liked the chairs- a wooden chair with a cut-out design of a steaming cup of coffee...or maybe that is hot tea...either way it was cool. Speaking of large, the menu was expansive. A lunch time menu had a good selection of food for about $4.50 each. The regular menu was over 10 pages and as I flipped through and saw squid, live lobster, duck, frog legs and other things I didn't want, I became worried again that it might in fact be more than I hoped for.\n\nI settled with the Kung Pao Chicken which came with steam rice. I added egg drop soup and the waitress asked if I wanted an egg roll. I then bumped up to the lunch plate that included the entr\u00e9e, rice, egg roll and to my surprise a hidden fried rangoon. The soup came out almost immediately. First sight told me this was a hearty soup - I took a sample and YUM! Good broth, good egg and a ton of veggies - celery, mushrooms, onion and snow peas filled the bowl making it filling even for a small. \n\nThe food came less than 5 minutes later. The Kung Pao was loaded down with onions, green peppers and lots of peanuts. The sauce was sweet and not overpowering, but there was a subtle kick to it. The egg roll was good, as was the sweet and sour sauce. The mustard sauce was very strong and one taste opened my nostrils. The total was $6.08 for the plate, $1.69 for the small soup. \n\nI stumbled upon this place by accident, but I am glad I found it. That and the sign on the inside proclaiming an award for Best Chinese by New Times Magazine (couldn't see the year) said I will be back next time I am looking for some Chinese close to the office.", "business_id": "ykfTh6HI219NoMsWBxulxw", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-07-27", "type": "review"}

Located in the Chinese Cultural Center of Phoenix, Szechwan Palace has delicious Chinese food (reminds me of home), and is located close to the airport if you're looking for a quick and delicious meal. \n\nMy mom's friend took me here for a quick dinner before dropping me off at the airport. She goes there often so the waitstaff already knew her favorite dish and bantered a bit, teasing me because of my Taiwanese accented Mandarin and because I can't read Simplified Chinese (it's so confusing though, with all the straight lines and boxiness...). The food was great, the inside clean (light wood floors and tables and white painted walls, making it feel very spacious and airy).  \n\nWe ordered: \n\n1. Wu Gen Chang Wan - I don't know the English name of this, but it's a stew of pigs intestine, pig's blood, leek, white cabbage (the one in kimchi), and red peppers. It was the perfect kind of spice, that warms your mouth, but didn't distract from the flavor of the pickled vegetables, the lightly textured blood, and the flavor of the intestine. The intestines were extremely tender without any chew to them, so you could bite right through and taste the fat and the flavor. It wasn't even stinky at all. \n\n2. Yi Xiang Eggplant - Your usual eggplant from a Chinese restaurant, but with a Szechwan kick. Japanese eggplant sliced and lightly fried in a sauce that was mildly spicy with a hint of sweetness. It had small pieces of minced pork as well. The eggplant was not too fried or burnt on the outside, but well-done and soft on the inside. \n\n3. Hong Shao Pai Gu - This is like a braised pork ribs, served with whole shiitake mushrooms and sliced bamboo shoots. Some of the meat was a little tough, but the overall flavor was great (mostly soy sauce, maybe a little tamarind). This dish was NOT spicy, so it was a good break for my mouth in between the other dishes. \n\n4. Bo Cai - Sauteed spinach with garlic. Fairly typical, the kind of spinach that makes your teeth feel like they've been scraped. Good to get a little green in  there. \n\nThe atmosphere was pretty nice and conducive to a conversation. Apparently you can request more spice; I didn't know that or I would have. I guess this is the usual mild level that they give to new customers. \n\nIt seemed the place was very popular; there were constantly people coming in and out, and several families with small children, which the staff was very accommodating to (with booster seats and high chairs). There were also many Chinese patrons, which is always a good sign. It was also nice to hear conversational Mandarin around me after so long...\n\nIf I ever return to Phoenix, I'm coming straight here to get a real Chinese food fix!", "business_id": "yQONzVpX-DEpGSuKMIov6A", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-07-18", "type": "review"}

I believe they have toned it down a bit (I was actually told this by a 10-year vetran of this spot) and the last time I had it, it was significantly less spicy, but still about a 9 - 10 on a 10pt spicy scale.

I arrived for lunch at 11am and was seated immediately.  The atmosphere was ok, and the bar looked a bit disorganized.  I ordered the the sesame chicken and egg drop soup.  I asked if I could pay extra for shrimp fried rice but was told no.  I chose the fried rice vs white or brown.  Soup came out first which I found to be very bland and very few pieces of egg in it.  On my 4th spoonful my meal arrived and I was not impressed by the way it looked.  The sesame chicken was only bits of fried chicken in batter covered with very little brown very thick and gooey sweet sauce.  Some of the chicken pieces didn't even have sauce on it and grossed me out because it was hard and bland.  The fried rice looked like it was done in a hurry with many white spots in it and with little taste.  The egg role wasn't bad although they did not serve with hot mustard sauce.

If you're looking at the menu that has \"Mongolian Beef\" or Egg Foo Yung, that's the wrong menu. \n\nI can only comment on the dishes I ordered from the one outing, but they all shined:\n\n-Water Boiled Fish (Shui Zhu Yu). There are different versions with beef, pork, or lamb, but the cooking preparation is the same. Spicy with red chili peppers and a healthy dose of Sichuan peppercorns which give a pleasant numbing/tingling sensation to the spice.\n\n-Cumin Lamb: Healthy dose of cumin. Good rendition.\n\n-Chongqing Spicy Chicken (Chongqing lazi ji): Ask for \"with  bones\". The meat comes from the chicken wing and drumette portion.  Comes covered with red chili peppers, but push those aside and just chowdown on the chicken wings and spit out the bones.\n\n-Green beans (gan bian si ji dou).

It is an odd closing time and maybe they were in a rush at 8:45pm packing my to-go order because my two spring rolls at $2 were left out. The dipping sauce for those spring rolls were in there and that ended up getting dumped on the white rice that was included with my noodle dish which is also unusual. So, I tried rice noodles with beef, but rice noodles in this joint are not Singapore style (which I wanted), but instead were chow fun style whic is like american egg noodles basically. The english spoken by the front counter owner was not perfect and she also seemed in a rush to make that crazy 9:15 time a reality. Ok, so the noodles and the onions and scallions in the dish tasted like any other place, but the nasty, unedible and in some pieces uncooked (9:15?) pieces of beef really earned this place its one star. I order beef like once in three years in Chinese places knowing that every place usually sucks and this was no exception. The owner could have mentioned that i could have gotten all veggies, but she didn't when I questioned her and I didn't figure out on the long menu that i could have gotten the same dish for $7.95 with no disgusting beef on the American side of the menu instead of paying a buck more. There must be an asian TV show that starts at 9:30pm or something because I doubt you will ever see a 9:15pm closing time ever again.

Every restaurant I've been to near an Asian market is fantastic and this is no exception. \n\nWhen we entered the place was packed which is always nice to see. The menu was huge which normally I don't like but this place has a great reason behind it - they offer traditional Chinese and Americanized dishes as well and they separate it on the menu too.\n\nWe leaned more towards the American side since it was our first time. The pork fried rice was killer -the tables favorite. The chow mein was next in line and we got just the veggie version. We had some steamed buns that were probably closer to dumplings than buns, but of course those were fantastic as well. We had some chicken dishes too that were awesome but I can't remember what we had (which is probably a good thing so  I make sure I get some of the traditional dishes next time).\n\nBecause I am not as familiar with some of the dishes, I asked a lot of questions of both the servers and the people surrounding us.

My first six months I had plenty of chances to eat out.  The whole time I was looking for more authentic Chinese food.  Not the overly sweet sauces of americanized Chinese food, but edgier stuff.\n\nWhile living in the Netherlands (where Chinese food is even worse than Phoenix) we learned that good Chinese restaurants have two menus, one for the casual Chinese eater looking for a step up from Panda Express and Chinese buffets and one menu for the die hards, native Chinese food eaters.  Often these menus are not even in English (or Dutch as it were).\n\nWell, my looking in Phoenix has come to an end.  Szechwan Palance has such a menu.  Granted, theirs is not so seret, they share the same menu, but in different sections.\n\nI have been here twice and I have found the food to be quite good.  there are some edgier dishes that we have not braved yet (i.e. kidney, brains, intestines, odd seafood etc.) but the ones we have tried have been quite tasty.  \n\nDan Dan Noodle, simple and right on, small bowl, but rather cheap.\nChinese egglplant in spicy bean sauce - very good, ordered it twice, and I do not even like eggplant.\nBeef boiled soup - I have grown to love this dish over the last few years (starting in netherlands),  There are so many flavors and interesting items included.  We love to get rice with it to sop up as much juice as we can.  though we have been told by friends that broth is simply there to cook the meat and veggies, not to eat as a soup.\n\nWe have Chinese national friends and they all claim it is a great place for authentic Chinese Szechwan.  \n\nThe Service - many comment on the service - OK it is only so so.  Last time we were there they never even asked us if we wanted anything to drink.  Had to ask them to clear dishes etc.  Not really rude, just not what we are used to in restaurants.

That dilemma is: How authentic are we going to make this restaurant? Basically, this question is answered by looking at the bottom line. If you are in an area with a relatively low conentration of that ethnicity then in order for your business to stay alive, you need to cater to the tastes of the local majority. The beauty of China Chili is that they walk this line and do it successfully. Restaurants that lean towards authenticity typically tend to alienate the majority of people because its simply intimidating. On the other side, a restaurant that caters to American tastes is hated on for the watered down ethnic experience. What China Chili has managed to do is make Chinese food accessible to the demographic around them. The Asian population in the Phoenix metro area is concentrated in the East Valley and Northwest Valley. There are very few Chinese downtown and that is shown by the lack of Chinese restaurants in the downtown area. China Chili has understood this and has beautifully adapted their menu to reflect the area they are in. In response to the people who commented on the lack of authenticity of the food here, I would say that I agree with that in part. However, being Chinese, I know that if you go into any Chinese restaurant that has Chinese people working there and you ask them, you'll find that there are additional items that the kitchen can make for people who are looking for that authentic experience. China Chili is no different. Just ask for something more authentic and in most cases they can tell you what they have available. I can tell you from first hand experience that they have ALL Chinese cooks in the kitchen. Its not like they don't know how to make authentic Chinese food, but like any good restaurant, they know their audience. \n\nNow to the food. Most of the things on the menu are pretty tasty. One thing that they do that most other places don't is tailor the food to your exact specifications. They can make it spicy, or less spicy, or omit veggies, msg, meat, or add basically anything you want. Some favorites of mines are the House Special Chicken, Salt and Pepper Pork Chops, Chicken Corn Chowder, and Spicy Garlic Eggplant. During lunch, they serve hearty lunch specials that after make you wish you were going to nap time rather than work(to some that may be synonymous). They have even more dishes that they can make for lunch specials than the ones they have listed so make sure you ask. \n\nAs for the decor....lets be honest. Chinese decor is tacky. I'm Chinese, I admit it. If the decor of a restaurant causes you to not eat there, then sadly you have probably missed the most amazing meals of your life because some of the biggest holes create some of the tastiest food. Its not dirty or messy, its just tacky, so please get over it. The Chinese are prone to gaudy, extravagant presentations, or did you miss the opening ceremonies of the Olympics?\n\nIn any case, I love China Chili because it allows people who would never walk into a more authentic Chinese restaurant to put a foot in the door of an enormous culinary world. And at China Chili they can venture in as far as they would want. .", "business_id": "-3WVw1TNQbPBzaKCaQQ1AQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-08-18", "type": "review"}

True, their appetizers are decent and the Hot and Sour soup tasty.  But the main dishes we had -- Garlic Eggplant and a half duck -- both very highly recommended by other reviewers, were mediocre at best.  I suspect most Americans wouldn't know \"real\" Chinese if they saw it  and this restaurant perpetuates the myth, that what they serve is actual Chinese food  (after bringing a friend to a Chinese restaurant off of Northern (Wahsun), which makes real Chinese food, he was shocked to taste what real Chinese food is).  Most of the dishes at China Chili are overly salty and/or sweet  (to be fair though, as a diabetic, I usually avoid both, so I might be overly sensitive on that point).  The service is indeed excellent and friendly.  My biggest complaint was the party of 15 Latinos sitting next to us celebrating a birthday, who apparently think it's okay to have screaming children ruin everyone else's night.  But that's not the restaurant's fault, since machine gunning guests is (still) illegal and there was nothing they could do about it.\n\nIn summary, the food here is okay, with the appetizers being their strong suit.  I've tasted much better in the Valley and don't really think this place deserves all the hype it gets.  Then again, there ARE a lot worse Chinese restaurants out here, so this may be your best bet.  It doesn't hurt either, that they're open till 10pm; a remarkable exception in a city, where the norm is to close at 8pm or 9, even on weekends and which, of course, is ridiculous for a \"major\" city.\n\nI truly recommend \"Wahsun\" in Phoenix, if you want to try real Chinese food.  I think most people would be surprised to discover how very different it is from what they're used to.  The food takes some getting used to, but once you get into it, you'll never go back to China Chili or their colleagues.", "business_id": "-3WVw1TNQbPBzaKCaQQ1AQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-07-08", "type": "review"}

Wish my work was still close to it because I'd eat there at least once a week for lunch.  Their lunch specials are so inexpensive!  We're talking $5-$6 a plate which includes the entree, rice and a cup of soup.  Can't get better than that.  Their service during lunch is amazingly fast.  That way if you only have an hour for lunch, you're in and out with time to spare. \n\nMy most recent review is when 14 of my friends and I went to China Chili for dinner.  We actually planned on going to Gallo Blanco but it was almost a 2 hour wait to accommodate our party.  So off to China Chili we went and there was no wait to boot!  We ordered the peking duck, mongolian beef, house chow mein, fried rice, walnut shrimp, peking pork chops, crispy noodles, ma po tofu...and really, that's all I can remember.  Some of the guys also had beers and sake.  I can't think of one dish that I did not like.  This place does NOT disappoint.  After stuffing our faces, we were delighted that our bill, plus tax and gratuity ended up being $10 a person.  What a deal!!!\n\nI am a huge fan of China Chili!", "business_id": "-3WVw1TNQbPBzaKCaQQ1AQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-08-08", "type": "review"}

China Chili popped up in the list & had received good reviews, so we decided to stop by. The parking spaces in front & behind the restaurant are limited & when we got there, there were no spots open so we had to park on the street. When we walked in, we noticed the restaurant was much larger than it appeared from the outside & was pretty busy - a good first sign.\n\nWe were promptly seated & brought our drinks. We ordered the Fried Golden Prawns for an appetizer and the Chicken in Phoenix Nest & Sesame Chicken for our meal. The prawns were good but nothing special. There were sweet & sour and horseradish sauces on the table which were the only reason that the prawns had any taste. As for our meal, the Chicken in Phoenix Nest was in an interesting tasting sauce - the first couple of bites were good but left a weird after taste. I only ate 3 or 4 bites. The Sesame Chicken was the same way. I understand that it's a different preparation than the sweet American version but this plate just had a bunch of slices of fried chicken with a gravy tasting sauce poured on top. I only ended up eating about 4 or 5 bites of this as well & was done.\n\nAdditionally, one of the things we noticed was that our waiter was really nice. We had a few questions about the menu & he was more than happy and nice, answered everything. Some of the ladies who were waitresses there, however, were not friendly. They glared at people when walking around picking up plates & dropping off meals. It was a little un-comforting / intimidating to get these looks while eating. Overall, due to the taste of the food & experience, we probably will not be back.", "business_id": "-3WVw1TNQbPBzaKCaQQ1AQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-06-10", "type": "review"}

I could literally not tell the \"orange chicken\" from the \"sesame chicken\" from the \"pepper chicken\" by any sense other than sight.\n\nThe rice was room-temperature, but I barely know this because as I was forking a mouthful of rice together on the plate, the alternately obsequious and intrusive waitstaff tried to take my plate out from under me (though, in retrospect, they may have been trying to save me).\n\nThe fruit selection, which I also sampled, looked fine, but was in fact soggy and also room-temperature to lukewarm.\n\nThey have a somewhat vast dessert selection -- particularly for a buffet -- but I'd more than had my fill.\n\nWalking toward the register, there was a prominent sign re-advising me that walk-outs are recorded and will be reported to the police and prosecuted.  There were three more similar signs at the register/gift shop (!).  Again, very welcoming.\n\nI won't be back, unless I'm told they're under new management.", "business_id": "naUFPFYH2CqHtTrV3IAJrQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-06-16", "type": "review"}

It seems to have pretty deep roots in the community, as lots of families poured in on a Friday night. Many came for the take-out. The parking lot outside is not very big, so it can be a tad hectic with folks coming and going. Near the front door, I think we saw someone selling jewelry. Not creepy \"van guy\" jewelry, but a nice lady with her kids interacting with customers. It is not your usual scene here, and I liked that.\n\nI WISH I could have given the food more stars. But, frankly, the wings were lacking in meat. The BBQ sauce we got was ok. I did like the inferno flavor (it was more like a medium/hot level of heat). The wings themselves were mostly bone and gristle, and without amazing flavor to supplement, weren't up to par with other valley wing spots. We also ordered the deep fried zucchini, which I rather liked. But hey, I'm a sucker for deep fried *anything*.

No zucchini, no mushrooms, no pizza - just some wings. The total came out to close to 8 bucks with an extra ranch. I came home to watch the ballgame & really enjoyed them. They were the only pleasant suprise tonight as the Dbacks got their asses handed to them once more.\n\nThey come a little bit on the wet side, which I think works. I would give the sauce a solid 8 out of 10. They cook them perfectly, done all the thru. They must have made some changes since I last been here because I don't ever remember the wings being on this level. Props to you guys.\n\nI'll go back once I need another fix. Perhaps ill try one of there other sauces? One suggestion I would make to the Long Wong familia is maybe offer grilled hot wings to char up some of that sauce.

So basically I could try spring rolls, fried chicken, and rice... for the $5.99. And it was not good. At all.\nThe entire place is pretty damn filthy. Last time I had lunch here was in 2000, and it doesn't look like they have cleaned since. Whatever you do, don't look under the table!\nThe service was not good either. Not friendly or welcome, just point to a table and mutter some words. It's pretty obvious the owners also operate the place, so at least you save some money because tipping is inappropriate when the owners are also the staff (you are just giving them free money at that point). \nWe examined the buffet and asked, before deciding to stay, if it was going to be replenished soon. Our server just pointed at the buffet and nodded. ok? I guess that means yes. Well apparently it meant no. My friend asked her: \"What are the entrees?\"  she points, again, and just says \"5.99\".  Here is the convo:\n\"What are the entrees today?\"\n\"5.99\"\n\"Yes, but what will the food items be when you replenish them?\"\n\"buffet over there\"\n\"Yes, we see that, but what do we get for $5.99?\"\n\"Food at buffet\"\n\"Yes, but there is nothing there, so we don't know what we'll be eating when you bring out the food. What are you going to serve?\"\n\"5.99\"\nNo joke. My friend just got up and left. My other friend and I made the poor decision of staying. Well needless to say, we never found out what the other food was going to be - though I assume based on what was left in the bottom of the pans it was going to be some brown slop.\nThe spring roll tasted like a frozen one that was defrosted and served. The rice was so rock hard I had to spit it out. The fried chicken was just ok. \nThe MSG coma hit us about 20 mins after leaving. That food is really poor quality.\nSo.... filthy restaurant, unfriendly service, empty buffet, bad food....  $5.99 all you can eat! lol\nI cannot recommend this place to anyone other than transients and trailer trash. Which brings up the next topic: the other patrons. We did get some entertainment value from the other crazy patrons. They must have some real characters wander off the street into this place. One guy came in and was yelling at himself, then yelled at the buffet food, then yelled at other patrons, then had a full meltdown and stormed out of the place. 10 mins later he comes and sits down, and apparently is friendly with the owners. LOL. and he had a mysterious animal in a kennel under his table. That was allowed. and nobody asked him to stop being weird with other customers and settle down. My assumption is that this is the norm for this place, the clientele isn't exactly.... top shelf. \nBest part? they have a sign that says \"2012 Best of Phoenix - Best Chinese Restaurant\"..... I stared at it... it was incredulous. This must be a hoax. That made me laugh because it was just so ridiculous. You just walk into the place and you know for a fact that it is NOT best of anything. Ever.\n\nUPDATE: within a few hours of dining there, I had horrible explosive diarrhea.\n\nNew Hong Kong is not for the faint of stomach.", "business_id": "UxMnY3Dxafucv5cXHyfBSA", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-07-09", "type": "review"}

You have to spend $1.50 for a small cup of friend rice. No substitutions.***\n\n______________________________________________________\n\nThe Story:\n\nI haphazardly found China Village on my way to a concert at the Rhythm Room. I wanted something in my stomach before starting my night of music and debauchery. Before even checking my trusty Yelp app, the restaurant caught my attention with its folksy outside d\u00e9cor. Its exterior resemblance to Chicago's China district convinced me that it would, at the very least, have the basics of (American style) Chinese cuisine mastered. So, ignoring the old idiom, 'never judge a book by its cover,' I parked my car and walked into what ended up being an antiquated social environment. \n\nFirst, I'd like detail the food. The menu is laid out in a similar manner to any local Chinese restaurant across America. I always wondered why these are so similar. Is there a database they buy them from? Does the Chinese government teach its citizens how to sell to Americans prior to getting their passports approved? Is it a subliminal demonstration of the Red Dragon's united might? More than likely, the answer is I just eat too much Chinese food. \n\nChina Village lost some points with me from the very start with their policies. First, sodas, which run $2 for a comically small cup, are limited to a single refill. This is often the highest profit item for restaurants and the owners plan to keep it that way with their authoritarian statute. Second, all items come with white rice. No substitutions. You can purchase a small cup of fried rice for $1.50, but you are still getting a large serving dish of white rice. God help you if you don't eat it all! The judgmental looks I got put me back in the mindset of a preschooler getting lectured about starving Ethiopians for not finishing dinner. \n\nThe dishes are presented in an alluring manner but lack any true substance. I ordered the house chicken, which on the menu boasted a plethora of ingredients. Expecting an orgasm, insert childish laughter here, of subtle and complex flavors; I was surprised when all I could taste was garlic. That's it. It didn't have a hint of poultry, nor a snifter of spice, or even a splash of citrus. Just garlic. On the bright side, I no longer stay awake at night in fear that the kid from Twilight will break through my bedroom window. Not because he played a vampire in a movie, but because all actors are soulless creatures that live off the blood of others and are repelled by garlic. It's just a scientific fact. \n\nLastly, I'd like to detail the atmosphere. The entire d\u00e9cor of the restaurant has been well taken care of but appears as if it hasn't been updated since the '80s. The staff, while genuinely courteous, followed too many stereotypes to not be deliberate. Every decision I made was met with a compliment pertaining to my ability or intelligence. No one spoke more than a few words of broken English and all the servers were women. \n\nI'm just an old chunk of coal. I don't know how to tell authentic Chinese cuisine from that being altered for American tastes. I'm not privy of the social markers indicative to Chinese hospitality. \n\nI do know when front is being put up. I'm understand that just because someone talks or acts a certain way doesn't mean they are creating traditional delicacy. \n\nThe reason for this front became alarmingly apparent while watching fellow patrons of China Village. The less English a hostess spoke the more they were tipped and the happier the customer appeared. It was an experience for them; especially those over 60. \n\nThe workers and owners of this establishment are merely responding to an economic incentive. People are awarding them for acting a certain way. Maybe this reminds them of 'the good old days' when an Asian American was only from China or Japan. There's a chance customers don't realize they are sending hegemonic messages. Overall, I don't think this is done with some malicious intent in mind, but it's not something I want to support. \n\nThe food here isn't really that tasty, and because I'm not into the pageantry being displayed, there is very little reason for me to come back.", "business_id": "3DMvGD8ZmlMQmhwV66hdSA", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-08-28", "type": "review"}

I was going to only give this place 2 stars (see below) but because this place was not dumpy like other Chinese restaurants and actually was clean and comfortable, this was part of the reason why I raised my rating. It reminded me of when I was a kid in 80s and would go to Steak & Ale with my family. It was very dark inside, which I love when it's 110 degrees outside, with dark furniture and windows you can see out of, unlike other Chinese places where they have to keep their windows shaded or blocked out for some odd reason. But this place has nothing to hide. Upon entering it is nice to see a full bar and to be greeted right away. I believe this is a family restaurant, and you can see the pride in the way the place is kept up. It is super clean, not dusty or dingy, and the bathroom is immaculate. Nice touch, even though the sun had not set yet, was the placement of lit candles on EVERY table, and only a few were occupied. I also noticed a fireplace, which must be nice if they light it in the winter.\n\nFOOD: one word, BLAND! I just don't understand. From appetizer to entree, everything was missing either sweet, salt, or both. The fried wontons could have a used a lot more filling and the \"sweet\" orangey sauce was not even sweet. What?! The fried dumplings looked like they stuck to the pan, as they were slightly black and some were broken from when they tried to remove from the pan (probably not enough oil, or they walked away for too long). The familiar sauce that came with it was not salty enough so I just used soy sauce. The Kung Pao chicken was unlike any I've had before. Where were the red and green bell peppers? Missing. Where was the heat, even though it was in red to indicate spicy on the menu? Missing. It was just chicken, lots of green onion bottoms, peanuts, and those whole red chiles no one eats but is supposed to add heat. The sesame chicken, usually with a very sweet sauce, was not. The chicken was okay, but slightly overcooked, noticeable by the very dark brown fried coating. I didn't like the tangerine beef: when you have any meat sliced thin, hello, it must be cooked no more than a minute or two or tough, as it was in this case. Think beef jerky. I noticed that the restaurant kept filling up with old people and I thought that maybe a nursing home was nearby, but then it dawned on me; they like bland food so this place was like their mother ship!\n\nSERVICE: This also led me to raise a star as the service was stellar. More than a few people from a couple waitresses to several bussers, took great care of us. They even wrapped the pancakes for our mu shu pork dish for us. Everyone is so friendly and served with a smile, I so want this place to succeed. \n\nYes, you are in Phoenix and the pickings are slim for the traditional, Americanized, Chinese restaurant that serves the freshest and tastiest food. Add some fresh spice, honey, turbinado sugar, fish sauce, whatever!, just turn it up a notch and watch those cooking temps (don't forget fresh meat and frying oil) and you'll have a winner. Add then add home delivery and you'll corner the market. In the meantime, I have found my current benchmark, Chou's Kitchen in Chandler, and I will have to trek it out there when I want the best, until I find something better.", "business_id": "m9Wqqma30o-hH2fAX7dnug", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-06-15", "type": "review"}

Beef pounded into oblivion smothered with a sauce so faint that it cried for flavor. \n\nThe Sesame Chicken, bland as well, was overcooked and nowhere near as sweet as one should like.\n\nThe Kung Pao Chicken was the least amusing dish of all.

The building on the outside looks old and the half lit sign was not inspiring confidence, but I have been craving Chinese and my hubby and I always go past it it and stare curiously.\n\nLets be clear here, this is NOT an authentic, or anywhere close Chinese restaurant. This is a good old fashioned American Chinese joint, keeping that in mind we tried the Sweet and Sour Pork, Singapore Rice Noodles and Sauteed Shrimp.\n\nThe food came out FAST, I mean in 10 minutes after ordering we had our first dish on the table. It was hot and fresh, no rewarmed in the microwave junk. The pork was lovely, big chunks of tender battered pork in that great artificial red sauce which was tangy with just the right amount of sweet. The pork was accompanied by nice sized chunks of pineapple and green peppers that still had some crunch, not cooked to oblivion.\n\nThe Singapore Rice Noodles came in a huge portion, probably enough to feed 4 people. Perfectly done thin rice noodles with lots of shrimp and pork tossed together with a wonderful curry sauce. Not at all greasy or over sauced. We took more than half of the dish home for delicious leftovers.\n\nThe shrimp dish consisted of a good sized plate of very lightly battered shrimp sauteed with chili peppers and large cut green onions. It looks deceivingly simple but has wonderful flavor much light salt and pepper shrimp but with much less mess as they don't need to be peeled. The server asked us how hot we wanted the dish so we went with a 5/10, we ended up with a nice blend of flavor and heat that was a gentle medium for us. \n\nThe service was fast and friendly, the restaurant itself is very clean, it looks like it recently got a new coat of paint. Overall for the price the food is quite a good deal.\n\nOh yes in response to another Yelpers review in where he noted all the elderly in the restaurant and wondered if there was a retirement home in the area.

The chicken was perfectly crunchy on the outside, tender inside, and the vegetables were still a little crunchy and a good mix.

Certainly, I ate my fill of crisp wonton strips, fried rice, egg rolls, stir-fried vegetables, and the inevitable sweet and sour pork. I avoided completely the fried chicken and the french fries, and didn't regret my choice. I tried the chow mein noodles but didn't go back for more. I lamented the lack of lemon chicken, a favorite of mine from when I came here over 20 years ago.\n\nWas it the price? $7 and change for your fill of Chinese food and a drink is pretty reasonable by any standard, even if the selection isn't much to look at and the food itself doesn't stand out either. Service is kept to a minimum - your money (cash only please!) is taken as you enter and water and/or a soda of your choice is brought to a table chosen for you while you load up your plate. Empty plates are taken away regularly, and food is replenished periodically from behind the mysterious doors where it sounds like a lot of cooking is happening.\n\nWas it the ambience of a cash-only business with a single room for seating, the sounds of the cooking behind the scenes nearly drowned out by the sound of someone watching their Chinese film on a portable DVD player behind the counter? The worn tables and plastic plates that look just as they did 20 years ago, shaped vaguely like alien faces from the classic 1950's version of 'War of the Worlds'?\n\nThe truth is that it was all of these things. Mike Kwan's Golden Coin is neither great nor terrible. The selection is limited, the food only fair (though I love those wonton crisps!), the service is minimal, and the price is right. But Golden Coin remains today mostly like what it was 20+ years ago, right down to the worn tables and the alien-face plates.

The mixed veggies, heavy on broccoli, are actually quite good.\n\nTo be so cheap, some compromises are no doubt made in the kitchen. There was also duct tape holding the front door handle together this day. Tables are well worn... But the restaurant seems busy and the patrons happy and satisfied. As long as you have appropriate expectations, the Golden Coin remains a pretty good choice for those with a craving for basic Chinese in quantity.\n\nNote that this is a CASH ONLY business.

I have to say that my favorite chicken fried rice is the one from Tottie's in Scottsdale that not only is delicious but always gives me left overs for lunch the next day.

I have a couple places I like, but nothing I'd rave about. \nUntil Bamboo House.\nI've never been to Chinatown in NYC, but if I had to guess, this place would fit right in. \nI loved the decor. It wasn't new and modern, but old school and comfortable. Reminded me of what a (fictional) popular Chinese restaurant looks like on tv shows.\n\nNow the food. I went with the bf and we started with Egg Drop Soup. 5 stars. It was the best I've ever had.  Presented much nicer than standard thrown in a messy cup- it was brought in a pot and served to us. Tons of tofu and veggies ( I love!!), and it wasn't too thick and yolky.\nI got the beef fried rice, he the mu shu chicken. Beef fried: 4.5 stars. It was delicious. No complaints. Not too dark either. I don't like heavy soy sauce. Mu Shu Chicken was not only chickety-china yummy, but we were fully served. Our waitress folded the crepes for us and delicately placed them on our plates with chopsticks. 4.5 stars\n\nThe serving staff had great team work, our table was immediately cleared without us feeling rushed, they were very friendly, and we felt like guests. 5 stars\n\nOh and too sweeten it even more, very reasonably priced!!", "business_id": "zTfBa__ldlTdbVgSl5h31Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-07-02", "type": "review"}

I got the Pad Thai and Hot/Sour soup as mentioned here.\n\nIt didn't take long to get my food. The decor was nice and it looked clean. The man who gave me my order was nice, he greeted a lady who was sitting near me familiarly.\n\nThe Pad Thai was delicious and a huge serving 3 days of dinner for me. Just spicy enough and the rice seemed to much along with it but it all came together. \n\nHot and Sour soup was great! Burnt my mouth because I was impatient to get it in my mouth. Just the broth had so much flavor.\n\nBoth dishes had huge shrimp and big chunks of chicken in the Pad Thai. \n\nMaybe a few more chunks will make it better and being there the first time with the up/down look made me feel awkward.

I must say we all thoroughly enjoyed our food! I didn't care for the pork, thought it was too \"porky\" but everyone else liked it so I'm the outlier.  The woman manager/owner comes up to us at the end, asks us how we liked our meal. I tell her we really enjoyed it, we live in the neighborhood and we'd definitely be coming back. Then this is where it went south. She asked us if we'd like boxes for our leftovers and we were debating whether to take the steamed rice. She says she can give us a carton of steamed rice packaged already and my husband says that if we take rice, we'd just take our leftover from the table rather than the carton she was offering.  \"We wouldn't want it to go to waste and take new rice.\"  Her reply??? \"Oh that doesn't go to waste, we use for something else.\" Oh really?? My husband asks what it is used for and I'm not joking...she replied  \"We use that for fried rice\". We were speechless. And just so there is no confusion about what rice she was talking about, that we are absolutely clear we were talking about the half eaten rice ON our table she says, pointing to the bowl on our table, \"see, it's like nobody really touches it anyway.\"  I'm not joking.

We also ordered a 2 litre of Pepsi, the price of which wasn't listed on the site. \n\nHad I answered the door and been presented with a $35 tab (the total wasn't given on the phone) I would have refused delivery. \n\nHad the price been closer to what I expected ($25 plus tax) I probably would have given a four star review, even if the food was underwhelming.

This dish didn't seem like Thai in any way to me but I'm not Thai so I can't say for sure.\n\nIf I could I would give 3.5 stars stars because the chicken here was prepared above average for the Chinese restaurants I've been to near this area. Portions from take out were CRAZY large and also very sloppy and messy in package. They do pack too much food in the styrofoam  package so Bring a TOWEL.\n\nOverall a pretty decent place to visit when in the area.

Usually that comes back to bite me in the butt.\n\nThe delivery was fairly fast, it got here in about 35 minutes (fast compared to the estimated delivery time of 1 hour, that is). But I'm immediately taking off 1 star because they forgot my soda. It would be one thing if I was at home, but I'm at work so I'm stuck drinking nasty tapwater with my mediocre Chinese food. Not what I would call a good night (plus, not getting what you paid for is never a good thing, even if it was just a soda).\n\nThe food was definitely warm enough. I ate my cream cheese puffs right away, but the steamed dumplings and lo mein sat around for about 20 minutes before I could get to them and they were still warm.\n\nAs for the actual food... well, it's ok. The dumplings are different than I'm used to, they are more doughy than I've had before. Not a bad thing, just something that surprised me since Chinese delivery is usually so uniform. They almost looked homemade. I was wondering why they were almost as much as my entr\u00e9e- its because there are 9 of them! \n\nThe cream cheese puffs were pretty good, but also more doughy than I'm used to. Maybe undercooked? But still good, I would order them again.\n\nI can't leave a review on the lo mein because the cream cheese puffs and dumplings filled me up and I haven't eaten it yet! I opened the container and it smelled good. Looked a little bit light on meat (I ordered beef) but I can't be sure.\n\nOVERALL, here's my final opinion. If, like me, you are ordering delivery and have limited options, go for it. It's not going to be the best Chinese you've ever had, but it's far from the worst I've ever had (see my review for Lucky Kitchen!). If you have the option of driving, then I would suggest driving PAST this place to another restaurant.", "business_id": "dvjYiddhJ2HrosdSBAqngg", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-06-04", "type": "review"}

If you want seafood and spring rolls and vegetables and no MSG, you'd better head elsewhere.  If you remember going to a china boofay in 1979, back when nobody knew or cared that Chinese people never eat this stuff, and you loved the kitschy decor and salty fried food, then Lim's is your place.  I'll bet that the recipes and decor are the same as they've been for the last 30 years.\n\nYou've got your requisite fried rice, lo mein, beef/broccoli, sesame chicken, sweet&sour pork, egg foo young, eggrolls, fried chicken, and maybe a couple of other items beyond that.  Everything was cooked not so bad as far as the consistency on the Crispy-Greasy Spectrum, but had so much msg that my mouth literally had a buzzing feel when I left.  Not a taste, a FEELING, left over from the monosodium glutamate infused cuisine.  Blech.\n\nThe Discard Pile was actually tiny for the sesame chicken, but instead of honey it was flavored with syrup--cheapass imitaion ''maple'' corn syrup.  Still, I must admit it was lean chunks of white meat chicken, and was my favorite if I had to pick a poison.\nS&S pork looked lean, with large chunks of nonfatty meat, but the insides were a little gristly, and each bite in had about 20% come back out onto the Discard Pile.  Seems like they tried to keep it lean, though.\n\nIn the entire boofay table, there was hardly any color from veggies.  All I found was some icebertg lettuce and coleslaw in the cold section, plus brocolli in the beef&broc, carrots and onions in the S&S, and some white cabbage and a few onion pieces in the lo mein.  That's about it.  Oh, the egg rolls had cabbage inside, too, and Are the old school thick skinned, bubbly deep fried and mushy, not the spring roll thin skinned crispy kind.\n\nLim's had some decent flavors and I created a small Discard Pile, so could be a 3Star boofay by getting rid of the msg, using honey instead of syrup on the chicken, and adding a bunch more veggies into the mix.\n\n$6.25 lunch ($1.50 more for a soda) was not worth it, no matter how much volume you shove in.\n\nStill buzzing from the weird msg high.

I'm serious, you could almost confuse the meat here for \"Chicken of the Sea.\" Same preserved flavor, and that's not the MSG talking.\n\nMaybe we ordered the wrong things, I don't know, but we literally took about 3 bites each and stared in remorse at our inedible dinner, as we contemplated calling for a refund or going out for a frozen pizza. \n\nNever again will I eat here.

You will leave full. \n\nThis is what I order:  \n(I don't mind that there is a small sized splash of what appears to be soy sauce on the zigzag border that sits just above the wood paneling in the booth. It seems like it has been there since my 10th Birthday anyway)  \n\nEgg drop soup. I like a thicker broth, this is the best. It gets better when you take your first bite  and there are fresh veggies like onion, red bell pepper and tofu in the soup. The fried wontons they serve with it make it even better. If I order egg drop soup anywhere else I immediately regret it, and crave this. It is definitely more egg-y than watery, but that's how I like it. \n\nI only eat egg rolls from here. The wrapper is fried to crisp perfection Their hot mustard is the best anywhere in my personal opinion. \n\nHouse Special Chicken( all white meat for only 50cents) Crab puffs, Shrimp and Snow Peas, Lemon Chicken, Almond Chicken, and The Mongolian Beef, are some of my most favorites, and they are safe bets. \n\nAlso, it says they don't cater, but my Dad just got remarried and they let us order enough food for 100 people with advance notice which was really nice.", "business_id": "lAGDe38li38fyf971CslFg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-08-22", "type": "review"}

And speaking of egg rolls, Dragon Palace has the best egg rolls I have ever tasted anywhere.  Their entrees are exceptional and huge; we always have a \"doggy bag\" for leftovers when we leave.  The atmosphere is conducive to what you should get at a Chinese restaurant, with decorations, lighting, and music.

Every time you go, you see the same little kid doing her homework at a small table by herself. Lol.\n\nThe food is pretty standard, but good. We were introduced to this place by friends of ours. After our favorite Chinese restaurant changed hands, we were in need of a replacement. Luckily for us, they had found this place. \n\nIt's tucked away in the corner of a shopping plaza that looks a bit deserted; pretty simple to miss if you were driving by. Once you walk in, you see this old skool cash register...straight up vintage, probably circa 1952. I definitely appreciate how clean it is. The owners take pride in their restaurant. Normally, Chinese restaurants lack both cleanliness and ambiance. \n\nThe restaurant is beautifully decorated. And the service is outstanding! The first time we went there, I asked a lady who was waiting on a to-go order what she recommended. She said the Mongolian beef, which we did order. She was right; it was good.\n\nFull flavored, and incredibly tender beef. I was thrilled bc I was able to get honey walnut shrimp. If that's a dish you haven't tried, you are missing out. I also recommend an order of their chicken wings under \"Appetizers\". \n\nTo enjoy a sampling of their food, we'll order the family meals. Expect to leave with leftovers. I recommend the Dragon Dinner Special. The wor wonton soup that comes with it seems to differ slightly from the one offered with the Mandarin Dinner special. If you're not used to bamboo shoots, you may dislike the wor wonton soup offered with the latter. \n\nMy husband said it had a weird after taste to him. I didn't notice bc I like bamboo shoots. The next day, the flavor of the bamboo shoots was more noticeable. As a word of caution: don't order an extra meal with the family style dinners. It'll just be overkill.

It has the kind of \"dive\" vibe we get very excited about. I can't see what the hubbub is about. The food was pretty terrible overall. I am willing to consider that we ordered wrong, but we got Kung Pao Chicken, Dry-Fried Shredded Beef, Wong's Special Chicken, and Pot Stickers.\n\nGoing item-by-item, the pot stickers were frozen and can be purchased at any Asian grocery store, so, essentially, they were something I can and do make at home. The beef was not shredded but sliced (which makes dry-fried dishes very hard to eat) and tasted like old fry oil and ketchup, disgusting. The special chicken was initially pretty excellent. It is fried chicken in a sweet-and-sour sauce, very similar in style and presentation to Springfield, MO-style cashew chicken. As we ate more of the dish, however, it became apparent that this chicken was breaded in Chinese donut batter and also tasted of old fry oil. Disappointing.\n\nI saved my discussion of kung pao chicken for last. This is one of my favorite Chinese dishes in the world, and we ordered it because one of the regulars waiting for take-out recommended it. This is, without a doubt, one of the saddest dishes I have ever eaten. It had no flavor: no salt, no soy sauce, no ginger, no Szechuan peppercorn, nothing. It tasted of celery, if anything at all. Additionally, the dish was swimming in a watery, brown-grey sauce that was the result of the zucchini in the dish. I'm okay with overly sauced Chinese food, but without any flavor and not thickened with cornstarch, this was just a mess. Additionally, the chicken tasted like it had been par-boiled before being stir-fried, so it was tough, flavorless, and an unappetizing grey color. Completely disgusting.\n\nAs I said at the beginning, I am willing to wager that we should have ordered the fried rice, which people seem to recommend, but I don't believe we will be trying Wong's again, as this food just isn't up to snuff.", "business_id": "ayTBDjx-S7TH4maWKBiAFw", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-08-11", "type": "review"}

Go him. Wong's happens to be fairly close to the house and we'd never tried it (due to its scary exterior), so we figured we'd go for it. I ordered the sizzling rice soup (which only comes in a large size for 7.50) and he ordered the sweet and sour chicken (about 8.50). My soup was steaming hot when it got to our house, so that was great, but the rice didn't really sizzle....weird for sizzling rice soup. It should be noted that the soup broth was more of a wonton broth (as opposed to other places that have more of an egg drop broth base) and contained large vegetables (that were fresh and tasty and included celery, broccoli, carrots, snow peas, etc), different meats and shrimp. The soup was sort of layered indicating (to me) that they cook the meat and veg separately from the broth and add it in later. All of the shrimp was at the bottom, followed by pork and chicken (and green onions), with veg on top. This was fine and probably wouldn't be the case if you ate the food at the restaurant. Overall it was a solid bowl of soup, better than a lot of restaurants, but still nothing I would really think about later. The husband's sweet and sour chicken was on the bland side... not very sweet... and the chicken was the typical fried puff balls of unknown chicken parts... he though it was ok, and I didn't care for it.
