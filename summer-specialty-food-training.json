I've visited Whole Foods locations around the country, but this Pittsburgh location is one of my favorites. It's a small store, but it feels homey and comfortable.\n\nStaff: Most of the staff members are super friendly and willing to do just about anything to help you find what you are looking for. I had one staff member begrudgingly help me out, but I assumed he was having a bad day or was very busy. Either way, it's nice to treat others with respect. \n\nThe cashiers here are so fantastic. They are never rushing and throwing food into bags. They take their time, ask you questions and treat you like a person instead of another number in a long line. \n\nDeli/Made-To-Order: The deli and made-to-order foods are currently my favorite. Sometimes I would rather spend $20 on lunch here with my boyfriend than go to a restaurant or get fast food. My favorite is the vegan chicken salad on foccacia bread. I adore this bread. It's just the right texture, it's nice and herby and deliciously buttery. Topped with swiss or muenster, it's a super delish sandwich. If I am extra peckish, I get extra veg. chicken salad. Yum yum yum! \n\nThe tomato bisque they have is something I newly tried. I'm very picky about my tomatoes and tomato products. This soup delivers. I wish I could have it every single day. It's so phenomenal! My boyfriend got it today alongside a cheddar biscuit that paired beautifully with the soup. \n\nCheeses: If you want fancy gourmet cheeses, the Whole Foods deli counter might be the best choice. We purchased a small amount of Midnight Moon Goat Cheese Gouda and made the most expensively delicious grilled cheese sandwich. We're grown-ups now, say goodbye to gross American cheeses! The cheese counter is so great because all of the cheeses are labeled with the kind of rennet used in the processing. You can easily find a high-quality vegetarian cheese with just a glance. The cheese experts are also willing to talk cheese to you for as long as you like. \n\nStore Selection: Overall the store has great options, but they don't carry everything that I wish they did. Unfortunately, they discontinued one of my favorite products - Field Roast Deli Slices. They bring in new and trendy foodstuffs though, so it's enough to keep me happy. \n\nWhole Foods can be pretty expensive, but if you don't fall for the tempting packaged foods, you can get away with a reasonable grocery bill! I primarily shop here for special items though. \n\nP.S. Their selection of natural body and haircare is great and affordable. If you have sensitive skin or don't want your products tested on animals, go here!", "business_id": "wfCLz9-aeShbPB7CaTY-qQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-07-07", "type": "review"}

We called in advance and the managers were all very kind - they told us to stop by their office and say, \"Hello\" even.

During that time Common Ground has evolved into a true force to be reckoned with--enough to convert even the most avid lover of the national brands. Once a modest selection of vegetables and granola, the co-op has expanded into a full-service store boasting an espresso bar, salad bar, bakery, bulk food section, stock of local produce/meats/dairy, and beer/wine.\n\nPeople with dietary restrictions and health preferences can find all prepared foods labeled in detail (and organic ingredients clearly indicated). A special shout-out to my deli favorites: forbidden rice salad, Cajun spiced tofu, Asian-baked tofu, and sesame noodles. I find a lot of the soups to be under-seasoned, but there are tasting cups set up for you to sample items before buying. If you stay and eat your meal on the patio, there's access to free Wifi.\n\nIn the bulk foods aisle, you can bring your own container from home to fill up (if you don't want to waste a plastic bag). I am obsessed with the nut grinders, which allow you to make your own fresh almond or peanut butter (akin to the coffee grinders you find in most groceries).\n\nWhile products seem expensive compared to the standard Midwestern grocery store, you'll likely satisfy every flavor of \"alternative\" food fad: local, organic, sustainable, gourmet, vegetarian/vegan/gluten-free, fair trade, etc. By virtue of the kind of people who are interested in ethical/eco-friendly food, you'll likely pick up some of the Portlandia vibe, but the co-op also tries to restrain the snobbery (kids get stickers at checkout, most staff are openly warm/helpful, there's an area where you can pick up/donate canvas bags for people who want a re-usable sack, etc.).", "business_id": "Q9eZS4qDdJo1ker0w3wnMg", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-06-11", "type": "review"}

WELL NO MORE!!\n\nMy friend had a Groupon (or something similar) for this place so we went. \nWhen you walk in, you're smacked with the delicious smoke from the FIRE-GRILLED meats they use for your meal! When I smelled that, my anticipation was amplified. You wander past the breads, pastries and cakes, and order from the board and take a seat. Your order number is announced bilingually when ready. Spartan seating, nice colorful tablecloths covered with plastic. Worn floor tile that can take centuries of traffic. You'll see what I mean.\n\nI had the pastor (pork) taco plate with refried beans (slightly runny) and Mexican rice (clumpy), and I accented with selections from the free salsa bar. The salsa bar has whole roasted jalape\u00f1os (you might need to peel some skin off) with onion slices (interesting roasted flavor), another section of veggies, then chopped onions, then cilantro, then salsas in descending heat to the right, begining with haba\u00f1ero red salsa on the left! Made me sweat! WATCH OUT, tell your friends, this is no ordinary salsa that you randomly grab and dump on your stuff. Pico de gallo is at the right end, and the MILD red salsa is next to it. The green salsa is DELICIOUS and mild as well.\n\nSin piedad por gringo: Habanero shot challenge! 2 people or more AFTER your meal. Have ice cream ready. Beer or water won't help.\n\nMy friend ordered two tamales, one chicken one pork, both wrapped in different leaves. Definite authentic flavor. We also got Jamaica (\"ha-MAI-ca\") which is a super sweet red hibiscus juice. You can also get bottled Mexican beers for $1.99. DEAL!! \n\nWater is located on the left side of the ordering counter in a self-serve container. \nExtra napkins (you WILL need them) are not readily available, you must ask for your plush paper napkins. Makes sense, they're more expensive, not cheap fiber napkins recycled from cardboard. \nThere's also a small grocery area. You can get fresh warm tortillas, a few veggies, some pork ($3.99/lb), authentic chicharones.\n\nSuper Inside Skinny: That's freshly made mol\u00e9 in bags at the grocery counter.\n\nCool Inside Skinny: 24 pack of Mexican sodas (Coke, Pepsi, Sprite I saw, but there might be others, maybe Fanta?) in glass bottles for $16. \nI usually buy them for a buck each at the gas station on the fly, but there's the real deal right there. Works out to 66.66 cents each as you can see!\n\nSo overall I'm sold and pleased with La Tolteca. \nTHIS is where you want to take your tourist friends when they come.", "business_id": "apCfJVnRyaw6oVUBKujpUQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-08-28", "type": "review"}
