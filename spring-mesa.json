They were all standing around a table and I had to actually make eye contact to get the head nod directing us to our seats.

Yes, they ignored all of our requests for something to drink until they could bring it with our food.  The food was actually fine.  We ordered three vegetarian dishes - the lentils, vegetable curry and a cauliflower dish.  The spice level was right but the portions were pretty small.  And, they charge for rice.   That's one of my biggest pet peeves.  Has the price of basmati rice gone up so much that you have to make me feel silly for asking if it's included?

Good sign, that must mean that people like the place. I noticed there was a buffet in the back. All the food looked fucking miserable. Of course it did. It's a buffet. What self-respecting person would eat ethnic food at a buffet?\n\nIn any case, we are seated. 15 minutes later, we get 3 menus. 5 people at the table. 9 minutes after that, we all get plastic coke classes of ice water (I shouldve been conservative on this 98 degree day, because this was the only water I got-- no refill). \n\nWe ordered our food, and it was fucking useless. The chicken was undercooked. My mom ordered the beef chapli kabob, which came out to the table sizzling....seemingly great, only to make EVERYONE in the restaurant cough, and give us dirty looks.\n\nMy poor aunt had specially requested no chilis in her dish, and of course, her dish had EXTRA chili. My aunt requested all of this in Hindi and Urdu....native languages to these people. What the shit is wrong here?\n\nAfter we got our food, no one came back to check up on us. On this hot spring day, we never got refills on our waters. I guess now I know what it's like to be welcomed to the desert.

I had this perception as many others have had that taking certain courses at a junior college level would be somewhat easier than that of a university, namely math and science type courses. I was clearly mistaken and earned a new respect for math courses taught at MCC. \n\nOne fall semester apart from my 15 credits at ASU, I also took two additional courses at MCC, a Calculus I class and a technical writing course. I was blessed to be in a Calc. I course taught by a Prof. Santini who began the class with... \"are you guys ready to get on the Santini roller coaster of fun?!?\" upon hearing that I knew it would be an interesting semester. To say the least, it was more than interesting, although I barely passed, this guy knew his calculus, he had the passion and he instilled his teaching in that he wanted his students to understand the foundation of calculus, so, for him the basic formulas were meant to be second nature to us. His class wasn't easy, it was one of the most difficult undergrad courses I've taken but at the same time it was the most rewarding. The same went for my technical writing course in which my professor graded our papers to the nth degree. I have to admit that MCC has instructors that are great in what they teach and prepare their students to be competitive at the university level, well, that was my experience.\n\nI do admit that this is one of the more crowded and busy junior colleges since it serves as a feeder school to Arizona State plus many of its students, like myself were concurrently enrolled at ASU and MCC. Another lesson learned from MCC was my parking skills. I learned how to be hawkish looking for parking. Since my classes were mainly on the side of campus facing dobson rd, my parking options were limited especially since from mcc i only had 45 mins to drive to ASU, look for parking there and get to class. Even now when I have to go to MCC for something, I still get frustrated looking for parking. \n\nOverall, MCC offers quality courses taught by pretty good instructors, and I recommend supplementing your schedule by taking courses at MCC if you're already at ASU because whatever your final grade is at MCC you can transfer the grade for credit towards your degree without hurting your cumalitive gpa at ASU.", "business_id": "XKrEnL9yCtlhhIa6efbtGQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-03-17", "type": "review"}

I eventually went thru detox which was not good for my heart.  i had celulitus and was in fear in getting mursa or the flesh eating desease which we are still monitoring at home. thank god I am home, You know the food was probably good but when I am sick I just cant see eating spicy foods so I couldn't eat for 4 days.  my Husband would bring me yogart to eat.  the med. asst. was walking around the room and I look down and on his foot he had a huge wad of black hair from a previous patient so what does that tell you. I just about thru up.  This Hospital was so filthy I couldn't believe it, if you touch anything there was either black crap or crunchy stuff on the trays,  I finally asked for some wipes to clean my area up. Due to the neglect of the nurses not answering the page I guess I decided to check out oh ya one of the aids came in the room and found me blue (dead) in bed and they had to revive me. I am only 57 and shouldn't be dieing this young I feel it was neglect. Out of all the shifts I went thru the only efficient nurses were the crisis crew, and a Filipino Gal 17yr veteran there and the nurses aid Deanna they worked on the 4th floor night shift 5-20 Sunday.  very very efficient and they deserve a medal... grant id i am a hard patient to work with at times but not that difficult hospital stunk so bad my sister ordered flowers that smelled good to cover up the smell.  whats  with that I have 5 dogs and my house doesn't even smell like dog and with my disabilities I am not able to keep up as well as i would like. I finally was able to take a shower after asking numerous times and if you want you sheets changed you actually have to ask.  to sum it up you need to watch where your hands touch uggg.  I hate doing this but it needs to be addressed for the board members I don't think they would want to stay in that place. If so i would like to see their homes and how clean they are.

Granted, I have been to no Whataburger! since this location (which I tried twice since it is right across the road from were I live), but both experiences were SO bad that I will probably never try again. \n\nLet me start off by saying that both visits were identical, in every way. And both visits were terrible, in every way. Why did I give it another shot? Everyone has bad days. Now, I'm not really a big fan of fast food, but as I said earlier, it's right across the road from where I live, and we're all creatures of convenience from time to time, so why not? I pulled into the drive-thru, up the screen and was friendly greeted. I assessed the menu, as I always do, for probably one second too long, before I decided on one of the meals, which was I believe a cheeseburger meal of some sort. There was a huge sign offering a new lemon pie. I wanted to try a lemon pie. It sounded good, I like lemon stuff, why not? \"Sorry, we're out of lemon pies.\" Not quickly forgetting the large sign advertising the lemon pies, I reluctantly parted ways with the pipe dream that was: lemon pie. I drove directly up to the window with no wait (curiously uncommon in retrospect) and my money was taken quickly, change returned quickly. So far so good (aside from the bitter conclusion of the great lemon pie saga). But wait my friends, this is where the fun begins. As I part with my money, the window begins to close. Soon to be the barrier between myself and my impending dinner for an excess of 10 minutes. I wait, and I wait, and I wait some more. I see the woman who took my money pass by several times, no eye contact. And even though it cannot be expressed in writing how long it actually felt like waiting for this meal, it was a really long time. Think about the longest time you've ever waited at a fast food window for your food. Multiply that by at least 2, but most likely 3 or 4. That's how long I waited. Maybe one more second for extra emphasis. Finally, I was handed my meal, and I peeled off, extremely frustrated over this scenario. Oh, and of course the meal was absolutely terrible. And I do mean terrible. Old, cold and full of mold. Well probably, I mean it might as well have been.\n\nAnyway, a month or so later, I was hungry, nothing sounded good or convenient, when in the distance, loomed the W I had begrudgingly renamed WheresMyBurger? Ok, Ok I thought to myself. I'll give them one more chance. Pulled up to the window, picked out another meal, a chicken sandwich this time, I think, and yes you guessed it, a lemon pie. Guess what? They were fully stocked with lemon pies. Just kidding, out again. I wanted to drive away right there, but was hungry and decided to wait. Maybe it'll be quicker. Nope, as long as last time. And the food was even worse.\n\nSo in conclusion, and proceeding most likely the longest fast food review you have ever read, I urge you, fellow food eaters, to stay far, far away.", "business_id": "2qf-0qkDNh7r8iU0498htQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-04-02", "type": "review"}

At first I just tried it out several summers ago and figured it would be a good budget course to check out when I couldn't make it to a higher end track. Now, though, I'm down to play Dobson whenever. \n\nAs the previous reviewer said, it's only 6600 from the tips, but I've never seen all the back tees tipped out, so it's probably closer to 6300. But it's not the length that will get you here. These greens have some serious slope to them. I know we're not talking about Augusta or Oakmont here, but this is definitely a course where it helps to have played the course several times and know what spots on each green you need to hit it to if you want to have a good run at birdie. Put it this way: I hit 14/18 GIR on Monday and had ONE somewhat flat putt, and that wasn't until #18. Luckily, it's slow Bermuda grass, or else most greens would be a three-putt waiting to happen.\n\nMost all the holes have some good character to them, the rates are very reasonable, staff is friendly enough, lots of trees to provide shade in the summer, some of the best (if not the best) twilight specials in town, and the course is always  in at least above-average condition. That is saying something for a muni.\n\nMy only complaints:\n- Don't come here during peak days and times. It's a guaranteed 5+ hour round. I know that's typical muni golf, but the rangers sitting on their hands not doing anything adds to the irritation.\n\n - They should take a cue from Papago's renovation plan and remove several dozen trees. There's too many unsightly dead pines and  eucalyptus. Plus, even if all the dead/dying trees were removed, there would still be plenty of trees for both scenery/shade and strategic purposes.", "business_id": "bRk44ShCT0osos-1xaTRyA", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-04-23", "type": "review"}

I am an everything snob, so when it comes to food, which is what I do best, all of my other practiced, routine snobbiness comes flooding to the fore.  This makes me the best ever decider of whether or not something is tasty.  You, whoever you may be, are not.  I'm sorry, but there has to be a best of everything, and I am best at this.\n\nSo to those of you who have not given cheba hut five stars, there are only three possibilities: either you visited them on an off day, you didn't try the east coastern (pastrami with mozzarella, mustard, pepperoncinis, toasted on garlic sub roll with everything--mayo, vinegar and oil, black olives, pickle, parmesan cheese, oregano, and probably a little love), or you know nothing at all about food.\n\nThe place needs cleaning, I admit.  But that is the theme.  And while I find it funny that an entire restaurant can be themed after all things stoner, replete with more euphemisms than you could ever dream of for weed, it neither adds to nor detracts from my rating or overall opinion of the place.  No, the subs here are sensational, made with just the right amount of everything all heaped on to whichever bread you choose.\n\nMaybe you aren't creative enough for cheba hut.

Even the sub sizes are extraordinary, you may pick from the following : Nug (4' ), Pinner ( 8'), or if you've got the extra munchies go with The blunt (12'). \n\nTo add to it's uniqueness all the subs carry the various names of the lovely lady Mary Jane. They also have quite the collection of no meat subs for our veggie friends out there, I'd personally recommend the Griefo. It's a garden veggie sub with guac, mushrooms, and cheba huts very own creation : hemp cream cheese. If you like a little more meat on your sub try The Kind (turkey, bacon, swiss, and mushroom) or The Pakalolo (ham, swiss, and pineapple). These are personal faves of mine. \n\nLastly, they have lots of tasty treats to pair with your meal, such as brownies (hemp is great!), goo balls, rice krispie bars, ect. \n\nSo next time your down by MCC, just look for the bright green VW bus and you'll find Cheba hut: Home of  The Blunts !", "business_id": "KS2w8ychyieJbUqRa6kCHw", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-03-10", "type": "review"}

It's been about two years since my last visit and in the past couple of months I've already been here like three times and wanted to go back more. I've decided that it's all about what you order; for example the first time I went I probably felt overwhelmed with all the choices and decided to go for something really plain like turkey with hardly any toppings, have fun! Their menu has a wide variety of yummy sandwiches and lots of new tastes to try. Also, don't be afraid to speak up. I was a little disappointed by the lack of lettuce and veggies on one of my veggie sandwiches but I also didn't pay attention. Now I ask for lots of lettuce and they're happy to make it the way I like. They make their breads fresh and they have garlic-herb bread that has lots of flavor. I won't order a sandwich from there without a side of ranch dressing. I am a picky ranch eater...I hate mayonnaise so I am always super careful that ranch doesn't taste or resemble mayo. I usually like restaurant mayo that is a little more runny in consistency with lots of flavor. They have the best home made ranch dressing here! Pair it with the garlic-herb bread and your sandwich is going to be booming in flavor. OMG! Wipe...sorry I just started to drool a bit. Service is good...everyone runs at the same chill pace which seems to go well with the theme of this restaurant. My current favorite is the Humboldt sandwich...I get the Pinner (8\") but I swear some days I am so hungry I think I'm going to order the Blunt (12\")...maybe someday soon. All sandwiches get toasted. Okay so toppings: Guacamole, sprouts, lettuce/spring mix, onions, mushrooms, tomatoes, black olives (I get mine w/o), cucumbers, pickles, your choice of cheese (I get Swiss), with their house goodies (EVOO, vinegar, herb mixture on top). Now that I found my sandwich, I crave it all the time and can't wait for my next visit. Oh, be sure to check their daily specials too!

They also had noodle dishes (hot and cold, though cold is only served in the summer), and a few, select styles of really simple sushi (not Westernized!) like shrimp tempura and tuna. They do have a note that in the summer months, they do not make sushi for carry out (taking the Arizona heat into consideration) so that it won't spoil.\n\nMy whole group ordered from the entree+rice menu and all got the combos.

As the\nsummer heat approaches, I would recommend their zaru soba which is cold \nbuckwheat noodles with a fish broth/soy sauce dipping sauce.\n\nYou need to stand up and find the husband if you're want a refill unless he's serving\na meal in the restaurant because I think he also goes into the kitchen to help his\nwife.http://www.yelp.com/writeareview/biz/kO1-ZswCgQak2beKUMaYRw?return_url=%2Freview_share%2FkO1-ZswCgQak2beKUMaYRw%2Freview%2FQ3IfvBJ5B1R3IfXbK3832A%3Ffsid%3DSE_43Uc-brVwG_NanttP3w&review_id=Q3IfvBJ5B1R3IfXbK3832A#", "business_id": "BBPkwpj9kSeDuy0uOwWHJA", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-04-21", "type": "review"}

There was only one other table of people when I visited and the ambiance was dead silent. Only one older man working the front of house. He took our order and delivered our dishes. To pay, we walked up to the register. \n\nThe sashimi platter is a good choice for two to three people. It came with a ton of tuna and salmon slices. The miso, edamame, chicken yakitori skewer, and gyoza sides were tasty. Also included was an interesting cup of tiny salmon slices with scallions and a sweet soy sauce. The tuna and eel rolls were nice, in case you prefer sushi to sashimi. Overall, the fish was good, but I have had better. \n\nThe prices are a bit high, but the dishes come with plenty of sushi, However, competitors like RA have higher quality fish. Due to the competition in the area, it is a bit tough to say I would come back.

This isn't any yuppie's vision of Japanese cuisine located in a cookie-cutter strip mall next to a Rubio's Fresh Mexican grill; this place was cut directly out of the landscape of Shinjuku-ku, circa 1985, and pasted in a rather unfortunate part of Mesa.\n\nSome people might gripe or balk on the atmosphere, but I say it really adds to the experience. My server, I'm guessing the daughter of the owners, was very courteous and I found the inattention by the mother and father and the mother's talking on the phone to a relative in Japanese quaint.\n\nSO YEAH, THE FOOD. It was great. I had an unagi (eel) roll with some kind of egg/chicken entree. Everything was tasty, and the fact the lights were off (presumably to save money) and everything around me was in Japanese made my white arse feel like Steven Seagal being a badass eating udon or whatever in silence in one of his 80s flicks.\n\nAnyway, this isn't the place to go if you're looking for an upbeat atmosphere with tons of people and all that. I was the only customer, and there isn't a TV or anything. I guess I'd say bring reading material if you're eating alone. \n\nThe only con I have is that they don't serve alcohol. I'm not a fan of sake, but this place is perfect for it. I really wanted to have a Kirin in a \"real\" Japanese place, but oh well. They do serve authentic Japanese canned coffee drinks and things like that, though.\n\nTOH ZAN ICHI BAN", "business_id": "BBPkwpj9kSeDuy0uOwWHJA", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-05-18", "type": "review"}

Not just sushi, but different types of ramen and udon, as well as bento boxes. I think this is my place to go in the valley! \n\nI really wish Yelp would let you give half stars. There are places that are better than 3 stars, but aren't quite at a 4 star level... that's where I'd put Nagasaki Grill Toh Zan. \n\nMy partner and I took our kids, which is always an experience because they generally don't like anything that isn't processed and full of sugar and crap. It's always a crap shoot when we take them out to eat. We lucked out!\n\nThe place totally looks closed from the outside, but inside it's clean, albeit a little plain Jane. I'm thinking that they didn't put a lot of money into remodeling the place, but it's ok. We sat in a small booth, while a larger group came in and took up a big table by the wall. \n\nThe gentleman sat us, handed us menus and suggested that we hurry up and order before the group did, so we weren't sitting around waiting for their orders to be completed. When it comes to bedside manner, no, he wasn't the sweetest, softest guy around, but considering it's only him and his wife running the place I could cut him some slack. Besides, having lived in Asia most of my life, i'm used to the more brusque manner. It didn't bother me, especially if the food was good. \n\nThe boys both ordered ramen; one got the miso broth, the other got a different broth (I don't remember which). I got the Ka-ri (curry) udon, and my partner got the teriaki chicken don. All the noodles came with inari sushi, which the boys loved... go figure! Decent sized bowls, piping hot, fresh. I think both of them were lifting the bowls up to make sure they got every last bit of broth. My curry udon was great, flavourful and filling. My biggest issue with it is that it really had no protein in it. I would love it if they could do a seafood curry udon, which is my go-to when I'm in Tucson. I would pay a few bucks more for a larger bowl, with a protein of some sort. \n\nMy partner's teriyaki chicken was ok, but not the best I've had. The potstickers that came with it were excellent, however. The chicken was a little dry and the sauce was a little sweet for my taste. But I'm not writing the bento boxes off completely. I plan on going back and trying some of the others, including the Unagi bento. \n\nThe honey lemonade was just sweet enough and refreshing, but the highlight as far as the drinks go were the strawberry boba milk tea. Soooo good! It was like actual strawberry puree in smoothie form, poured over ice and topped with milk. A little unconventional as far as boba teas go, but it was so incredibly yummy! \n\nSo, in a nutshell, I'll be going back, especially since the boys really liked it, and that's a huge plus. There were a few missteps, but honestly, for a restaurant that has a staff of 2, you can't always expect perfection. It's obvious that they put their blood, sweat and tears into this venture, and I'm happy to support a local business like this.", "business_id": "BBPkwpj9kSeDuy0uOwWHJA", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-03-25", "type": "review"}

I tend to get their vegetarian one that has seaweed, kimchi, and mushrooms. It tastes great. The jap chei (wrong spelling!) is vermicelli noodles with meat and veggies. It is also very good. The best part about this place are the side dishes. They always give you a lot and they taste great, except when they put something american in there like sliced hot dogs. The service is also great and I love the endless supply of side dishes. You get a lot of good healthy food for a small price. Their tofu soups are around $8.95 and come with rice and all the sides. Their bbq is a bit more expensive though.

I ate here so often that at one point I was a \"Mayor\" on FourSquare and \"Duchess\" on Yelp!  They've changed ownership twice since 10 years ago, and the new one took over about 4-5 years ago I believe.  Their food's ok, but the best thing on the menu is their kimchi jjigae.  That's the reason why I came here all those times and I don't even touch their banchan, because it's so subpar compared to LA, SF, or NYC that it's laughable.  Their Soon Tofu is average and the Kalbi is average as well.  But you take what you can get here in AZ when you have a craving for Korean food.  \n\nWell, if you're serving mediocre food, at least you expect them to provide really good in service right?  NO!!  I have always been unhappy with their service since day one, but I just dealt with it.  Well, I've just had it today and sort of lost it!  The waiter (in his 20s, about 5'11\" tall) who speaks fluent Korean and Enliglish, just pushed me over the edge!  WTF??  Are you kidding me??  I could not believe the service I was getting from this guy!  OK so here's what happened.\n\nI ordered 1 Soon Tofu Jjigae with only beef,  2 lunch special Kimchi jjigae, 1 Lunch special kalbi, 1 lunch special kalbitang. (5 total items)  He brought the banchan (side dishes) and rice and asked me if I wanted eggs in \"all of our soon tofu jjigae.\"  I said I only ordered one soon tofu.  Then he said I ordered 2 kimchi soon tofu, 1 beef soon tofu, 1 kalbi, and 1 kalbitang!  I said \"no I didn't\" and I repeated what I ordered.  Then he argued with me and said \"Yes you did! You ordered 3 soon tofu, plus kimchi jjigae, kalbi, and kalbitang!\"  I said \"are you kidding me right now?  Look here!  We're only 4 people!  Why would I order so many soups for?\"  The guy must be a moron, because he can't even count how many people there are to be ordering 7 items?  Do we look like we could eat that much?  We were two slim adults, and two kids under 15!!  Then he let out a big sigh and then stomped off to fix the order at the kitchen.  He comes back with our food and he literally bangs the soup bowl onto the table!  He is obviously emanating a negative attitude, bangs down the rest of the stuff and stomped off.  I just shook my head and we started to eat.  Half way through the lunch we needed more rice and napkin so I called him over since he was bringing stuff to the next table.  He obviously heard me and didn't bother turning around.  OK, so I'm thinking to myself, maybe he didn't hear me.  I call him again second time and he pretended he didn't hear me.  Then the third time, I called him loud enough for the whole restaurant to hear me and then he turns around, rolls his eyes, makes a face and then comes over.  I couldn't believe my eyes!!  I asked him \"are you giving me an attitude right now?\"  then he yells (yes he yelled at a customer) at me and says \"did I even look at you right now?\"  Then he passes by our table, goes to the next table and \"politely\" asks  \"may I take your order?\"  WTF?  I asked him to help me get something and he completely ignores me?  \n\nOk so let's recap here.  He takes the order wrong, puts in 2 too many orders of Soon Tofu, then gets mad at me when I correct him that isn't so, then he practically throws the food at us banging every chance he gets, and then he ignores me when I call him!  OMG!  At this point, I'm FURIOUS!  I get up and go talk to the owner who happens to be there today.  I reiterate everything that just happened and he doesn't say anything but to just look towards the direction of the kitchen!  Then I say to him \"is it ok for the server to do that to a customer\" and he turns and apologized.  He said that it's his fault for not training the staff correctly.  OK, so I'll take that for an apology, but then he should go quietly talk to the server, have the server come over and apologize to me personally!  Nope, that never happened, and guess what happened next?  The owner comes over to our table, being extra nice, and says he's going to take care of our lunch on the house.  At this point, I'm still shaking from rage and I can't even eat anymore.  I said I'm not making a scene, because I want free lunch.  I'm going to pay for what needs to be pay for, I don't want free lunch.  So while the owner's talking to me at our table, that server is standing near the kitchen talking to another server, looking directly at me, and laughing at me!  WOW!   Just amazing!  I've dined out at so many restaurants over the years in my life at all different levels, from Michelin starred to hole-in-the-wall scary places, but this was just the worst service ever!!\n\nStay far away from this place!  I called my mother after what happened.  She was at a luncheon with 20 of her Korean friends for a church function.  You can bet that she spread the word.  None of those ladies are going there in the future.  And neither am I.  To the Owner:  word of mouth is a scary thing.", "business_id": "PX3e3qtBx_5VC3vqq47jpQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-05-30", "type": "review"}

However, I've lived in both LA and SF for several years each, so I could be a harsh critique here.\n\nThis is the only Korean restaurant in Tempe (aside from the one-offs like Paradise Hawaiian BBQ) and so you're not exactly picking from a bunch anyway. The food tends to be well-portioned, though many of the dishes had been pre-cooked and are just heated to order (i.e. Yukkaejang). My biggest discontent is the price, which is quite expensive comparing against the price level of other Korean restaurants I've been to, and absurdly expensive when compared against the other restaurants of similar caliber in Arizona.\n\nThe best thing happening here is the pancake, so definitely try it out if you're new to Korean food. It's about $13 (maybe even $15?) and serves as a great appetizer to split between 3-4 people. Don't go for the happy hour stuff-- they are puny in portion.\n\nThe second best thing happening here is the service, though it depends on who you get. The younger servers tend to be really friendly, well-spoken, and willing to take your fight to the kitchen for you. For example, my Yukgaejang (spicy noodle soup) showed up with no noodles-- the girl server had the kitchen serve me a whole side bowl of noodles and soup for free!

The service it's not nonexistent it's pure rude like I borrowed money from them and didn't pay them back!!

One time I was there for lunch at 2:30 or so with a buddy of mine and I asked them if I could order the happy hour dishes that starts at 3 and naturally they said no which was understandable so we order and started to eat til 2:57 when I asked again to get something from the happy hour menu the waitress looked at me with a look the a mom would give to her child when he did something bad and replied it's not 3 at that point I wanted to het up and leave  but my buddy said wait and at least finish lunch, ok I finished stood up and asked our waitress for a togo box from behinds the counter she the replied \"for what?\"....I was so done with this place told me buddy to pay and stormed out \n\nSo for all you awesome people that read the my whole rant thank you and those who didn't.....well I STRONGLY would not recommend this place to eat maybe to get pissed off at but other then that yeah that's my two cent.", "business_id": "PX3e3qtBx_5VC3vqq47jpQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-04-19", "type": "review"}

I had ordered a vegetarian soon tofu soup with everything in it (seaweed, mushrooms, and kimchee) and eveything else ordered was shared with my friend except the soup. Although my friend tasted the soup and thought it diddint taste fresh. Towards the end of dinner, around 9:15, I began to feel suddenly ill. I went to the bathroom and threw up violently and painfully. :( Went out, and went back to throw up. Struggled to walk out of there, I threw up multiple times on the way home. By midnight I was hyperventilating, in extreme pain everywhere, and could not walk. I called my friend who was just with me to take me to the emergency room. I considered calling an ambulence. :( I truly felt like I was going to die.\n\nMy friend found me on bathroom floor. Rushed me to hospital. In the hospital, I blacked out a few times, saw the light, as they rushed to attend to me. I couldn't talk, walk, or function. I had severe food poisoning.  I had chills, sweats, shakes, and feeling hot and cold. Absolute worst feeling in the world. They immediately gave me fluids, nausea meds, and morphine for pain. I was there untill 3:30. My feeling is that soup was bad. It diddnt taste right to begin with, nor did it look right. Also, considering it was a veggie broth, I wonder if because it may be something the Asians there NEVER order (perhaps), they probably had a batch that went wrong, or... maybe something else in the soup wasint right. Lastly, the soup is usually super boiling hot. I felt like it wasint, cause my egg diddint cook right away as usual. Maybe it was the egg from samonila poisening. I'm going to talk to the manager, I want a full refund.\n\nThis has been the most traumatic health issue I've ever felt, and certainly the worst case of food poisoning I have ever had. :(\n\nUpdate: Sean the owner helped to get me a full refund.

One thing I learned yesterday, if Amanda's pouring drinks, order beer. I ordered a vodka and soda. It was a very light pour. So I ordered an extra shot...which came out about 1/2\" of vodka in a shot glass. So, the next drink, I went ahead and ordered a double. It tasted just like the first drink did BEFORE I poured the extra shot in it. And I paid $8.00 a piece for these two drinks! Last week, we met some friends there and the drinks were poured perfectly. I would have been hard pressed to even drink a double. The first time I ate there (after the new menu), I ordered a veggie burger. It was microwaved so much it was like shoe leather. The next time I went in, I avoided the veggie burger and ordered a french dip with a side salad. It was a great sandwich and the salad was fresh and crisp!! Yesterday, I went in and ordered the french dip again. \"Meh\" is all I can say about it. And the salad had obviously been made much earlier and covered with plastic wrap because it was all squished down in the bowl in that shape. I'm sure for the local neighborhood patrons, this is all just fine because they go there to see all of the other neighborhood patrons.

I would probably come back to just drink some fancy wine and sober up by eating the bread.", "business_id": "P2i4eojfX61pZn8i7RZZxA", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-03-24", "type": "review"}

My husband took me here on our first official date.  We've since been back a few times to celebrate anniversaries and what not's.  Aside from the creepy maitre'd at this location, who later turned into a joke, this was a wonderfully romantic first date place.  I mean come on, I married the guy!\n\nThe decor in this location is simple, with an Italian flair and enough elegance to make you think you should dress up.  You don't really have to, but you wouldn't look out of place if you did.  The first time we came here, I ordered the Tortellini Panna Rosa and it was delicious.  The pasta was cooked perfectly and the meat filling inside was super tasty.  The rosa sauce was creamy and tangy, providing the perfect complement to the pasta.  Everything was wonderful.\n\nOn our second trip back, I ordered the Chicken Fiorentina.  Wow!  It is so good.  The chicken was juicy and tender, but the sauce.  OMG the sauce is incredible.  It is called a cognac cream sauce, but they made as well call it ambrosia.  It's incredibly rich and full bodied with a thick texture that perfectly covers your chicken.  Order that if you ever go there.\n\nThe last time I remember going I wanted to get something with that delicious sauce, but I wanted to try something new.  I think I was at the Glendale location, but I can't remember.  It was a seafood pasta with the same sauce and it too was just as wonderful as everything else I have ever had here.\n\nIf you want really good Italian food and you can afford to open your wallet a little wider than the average person, go here.  If you want a romantic date, I suggest this location over the others, it's much smaller and more intimate.  A great overall experience that keeps this restaurant in my top 10.", "business_id": "P2i4eojfX61pZn8i7RZZxA", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-03-05", "type": "review"}

The desk clerk at our hotel gave us a list of restaurants in Mesa and took the time to point out his favorites.  He told us that Tutti Santi had fantastic lasagna---and he was right!\n\nWe went on a Thursday night around 5:30.  The restaurant wasn't very busy and thus our large party of 5 adults and 3 kids was seated immediately.  \n\nWe started the meal with 2 appetizers---calamari fritti and eggplant parmigiana.  The calamari was fried to perfection---not rubbery at all.  The sauce was a spicy tomato one which complimented the calamari wonderfully.  The eggplant was very tasty with no bitterness.  The breadbasket was excellent.  It had pieces of foccacia and cripsy Italian bread.  However, the star was the whipped garlic butter.  It was so tempting to go overboard on the bread just to have that butter!\n\nThe main courses came with your choice of a house salad or the soup of the day.  The house salad dressing was a balsamic vinaigrette and the salad had tomatos and mostly romaine lettuce.  The soup of the day was  spinach egg drop.  I had a taste---it was truly unique.  It had the consistency of a Chinese egg drop soup but was infused with Italian spices and some pepper to give it a kick.\n\nFor entrees, our party had the following: veal parmigiana, gnocchi with Bolognese sauce, lasagna and ravioli.  The person who ordered the ravioli was inspired to do so due to the hostess.  I mentioned that I heard their lasagna was really good and the hostess said it was but the ravioli was even better!\n\nI had the gnocchi but also got to sample the ravioli and the lasagna.  The gnocchi was very light in texture (not heavy at all) and the Bolognese sauce was well flavored without going overboard with the ground beef.  I was impressed with the lasagna.  First of all, the portion size was quite reasonable plus it wasn't too thick.  Yes, it was very tasty.  The ravioli with tomato sauce was also delicious.  The cheese was mild and the sauce complimented it very well\n\nAt the suggestion of the waiter, the kids got penne with a butter sauce.  It was a great idea for a meal for a preschooler as the kids ate it all.\n\nAt the end of the meal, we were all too full to even think about dessert.  Nevertheless, the waiter brought a plate with tiramisu on it plus serving spoons for all.  Again, we all enjoyed it.  Sometimes the coffee flavoring in tiramisu can be overpowering and bitter.  This time, it was in proper balance---not too rich and not too sweet.\n\nMy Dad, who was with us and is well-traveled, told the waiter that he thought Tutti Santi was one of the best Italian restaurants he ever went to anywhere and gave it 5 stars.  While I'm nowhere near as well-traveled as my Dad, I had to agree with him --- this place deserves 5 stars.\n\nThe only drawback---service can be on the slow side.  So go expecting a leisurely dining experience and you won't be disappointed!", "business_id": "P2i4eojfX61pZn8i7RZZxA", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-04-17", "type": "review"}

Unfortunately I came here with a large party so they had a special \"buffet\" menu for groups over 50.\n\nThe first appetizer was a cheese- filled ravioli topped with red sauce, which wasn't bad. Our table was a bit put off when the waiter told us, \"only one ravioli per person.\" The second appetizer option was a slice of tomato with mozzerela topped with tomato salsa, which would have tasted much better on toasted bread. Tomato on top of tomato is a bit too much. The salad had a very light dressing and slice of tomato on the side, which wasn't too bad. The restaurant must be overloaded with tomatoes.\n\nFor the main course I ordered salmon with vegetables and my friends ordered chicken and pasta. Neither finished their meals but I was able to eat the salmon. The portions were small and very unsatisfying. I did enjoy the cream lemon and herb sauce and capers with salmon, but the portion was barely larger than the palm of my hand.\n\nFor dessert they served tiramisu which was delicious but had a lot of flavor, which almost washed away the rest of the flavors we'd tasted before.\n\nI didn't really expect much going in, but at least the atmosphere is very nice. Classy decor and waiters were helpful in retrieving drinks and whatnot. The drinks themselves were not that strong. Overall it was an interesting experience but I wouldn't want to go back unless they were definitely serving salmon.", "business_id": "P2i4eojfX61pZn8i7RZZxA", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-04-19", "type": "review"}

Our waiter was a bit over-the-top-friendly but was excellent nonetheless.\n\n* Bread and butter you get to start = very good.  excellent garlic butter stuff.\n\n* Sauteed calamari appetizer = I wanted the fried but my wife said no.  The sauteed was very good though.  I would order it again.  The leftover sauce was great to dip the bread in.\n\n* Caesar salad = all the entress come with a basic side salad but I opted for the Caesar.  No idea why it was $6 more though.  It was just ok and I think it was just the regular salad with Caesar dressing and croutons.  I would not get this again.\n\n* Lasagna = Very good.  This really isn't your standard piece of deep dish lasagna.  It was about an inch thick and looked to be all \"hand-crafted\".  The portion size was perfect and wasn't ginormous.  It could have been a bit more flavorful though.  Not sure I would order this again because there are tons of other things on the menu that look excellent.  Veil looks like their \"thing\".  Their homemade gnocchi also sounded excellent.\n\n* Tiramisu = Excellent.  It is homemade and very different from other tiramisus I've had previously.  It was very light, very creamy and was without a lot of the \"cake\" I expected.\n\nThe highlight of the meal (for me at least) was the complementary shots of flaming sambuca they offered at the end the meal.  There was no way I could turn this down. This was my first flaming shot and after some coaching from our waiter it was a smooth one!\n\nAll-in-all it was a good meal.  Mom and grandma enjoyed it and had some leftovers to take home so all was good.  I do however think the prices are way high and it is probably some of the more expensive Italian food in town which is weird for a strip mall in Mesa.\n\nPro Tip:  Go to Restaurant.com and get a gift certificate for a couple bucks and save yourself $25.

It was my birthday last Thursday and we went to Tutti Santi to celebrate. We have gone to this particular location in the past and the food has been great. On 3/8/12, I couldn't have been more disappointed. It took 15 minutes just get our drink order (only one glass of wine, an ice, and water). The app. salads varied in extreme size difference from one person to another although it was the standard side salad. The cooks weren't paying attention to portion or size control. It took 45 minutes for our three entrees to be delivered. The fish of the day, (Salmon), was extremely fishy and should have probably been the fish of the day a couple days prior. Our bolognese was mediocre at best. It tasted like store bought tomato sauce, not hearty bolognese. We never got any drink refills, we didn't get bread (even after requesting it from our waiter). \n\nThen to top off our mediocre entrees, the desserts (I did want desert as it was my birthday) were atrocious. They brought me FROZEN creme brulee. I had to wait 5 minutes just to make eye contact with our waiter because he was too busy talking with the bartender. They took it back and brought me another one that they didn't even bother crystallizing the sugar on. That is what separates creme brulee from old fashioned custard. One of my dinner companion's order a canoli that was pre-packaged frozen desert quality. My other companion was served previously frozen tiramasu that was complete mush.

He has great advice and is really approachable. Jaren is equally helpful and is the coral expert. He knows the scientific name of every frag in their tanks and the care required by each specimen.

Since I wanted to removed a think layer of dirt and dust from a car quickly I went here for the quick automated wash. The price was good and all, but the problem happened when I got back home and noticed that the roughness of the automated wash had torn off one of my side mirror panels. I went back there to ask them if they had found it and they let me look around a bit. It had only been no more than 15 minutes since I had left there and it was no where to be found. One of the employees there tried to tell me that it could have slipped under the drain, which is impossible because this panel is over 6\"x 8\" and would not have slipped through the grate. All I got in response to this was a simple \"sorry\" and no offer of anything to make it up. I had to buy a $100 replace for both mirrors as they are not sold individually. Personally, since I looked everywhere for it myself, I'm thinking the piece may have been run over by another customer's car after mine and they just threw away the evidence.", "business_id": "flgqBG9GfVTQN6ITWxOLbA", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-03-25", "type": "review"}

We called to ask if they were open Saturday morning, and they said they were, but only until noon.  We said we would be by to pick the meds up, and the receptionist agreed to have them ready to save a little time.  She did warn us not to come late, because they were closing at noon.  We had some other errands to run, and arrived at the vet clinic at 11:40 am.  The doors are all locked and the lights are out, and there is not a single car in the lot.  We call on the phone, and get the emergency service.  So needless to say, this is no longer our vet.\nWhen we were here before, it has always been quiet, no other customers but us, and the place looks a little run down.

Additionally, my best man was in SF while the rest of my Groomsmen were in Arizona.  I thought for sure it would be best to go to a national location where we could all get measured locally and pick everything up in Phoenix.\n\nI finally got everything picked out and gave the price to my Groomsmen...who promptly freaked out ($236).  My brother decided that give Rose Tuxedo a call since he was married about 5 years prior and he said they were great from him.\n\nLo and behold...Mark (I think he's the owner?) told my brother that he would get us such a close matching design of what I picked that we wouldn't even be able to tell.  He said \"Trust me, we get these requests all the time - especially from people who come from Men's Wearhouse.  If I can't figure out what it looks like from pictures, I'll go to MW myself and get a look!\" - love that dedication and confidence.  Mark got back to us with a final cost of exactly what I had picked out: $107 - holy crap, less than half!!!!\n\nMark let us know that getting measured anywhere would be easy and should be free, and gave us a brief of the type of measurements to expect.  We sent down our measurements, and I have to admit I was a bit nervous but decided to run with - and boy am I glad I did.\n\nWhen we showed up to pick the Tux's up the day before the wedding, I had the same color vest as all of my groomsman, and my shirt didn't fit quite properly.  Mark, without skipping a beat, took full responsibility for the vest/tie not being separate color (even though we never even told him) and not only fixed that and a properly fitting shirt within minutes, but got me a fantastic looking vest that really popped and looked amazing.  Mark seems to really keep up with modern styles, and keeps great stock of many options/colors just for people like me!\n\nMe and my groomsman all looked great, and got compliments throughout the evening on how sharp the tux's were.  Mark did an outstanding job of matching exactly what I had picked, and most importantly put me at ease during a very nervous and stressful time.  Oh, and he's funny too!  \n\nI cannot say enough about Rose Tuxedo, and Mark specifically for their professionalism, flexibility, and dedication to their craft.  Without Mark and Rose Tuxedo, I'm not sure we would've pulled it off all, especially in such a grand fashion.\n\nThank you so much Rose Tuxedo!!!!!", "business_id": "sV45cJCODWCefNdu6k4u5g", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-04-16", "type": "review"}

On top of great suits and tuxedos, the staff is extremely professional.  No joke, I lost 25 pounds between getting measured and picking up my tux two months later.  They altered my tux on the spot.  I really wanted a three-button jacket originally, but after losing so much weight, the tailor had to move the buttons.  After doing so, I felt the jacket hid my vest, so I switched to a two-button after making him do all that work.  Did he say anything?  Not_a_word.  He just smiled and agreed that if I liked the two-button better, I should go with that.  Last-minute shoe changes for two people were thrown into the mix and not an eyelash was batted.

We went and took a look at our room. It was old and outdated, and hot! I am sure they knew they were assigning that room (according to them they were full), couldn't they have the air on even a little? We decided to try and get a little sun from what was left of it for the day and went to the pool.

While waiting over the 20 mins., we go back to check to then be told they only had room with king bed, not what we reserved and paid for, we had a party of 4 and reserved room with two queen beds. In trying to ask what happened, john said without looking at us to speak he had no explanation. We then asked for a refund, rudely he said NO, we booked thru Expedia and would have to contact them, still talking rude never making eye contact, he proceeded to get up and as he walked away mumbled under His breath to his staff, to which I finally told him he has no customer skills and wanted a superior to talk to, where he shrugged and said go ahead you can find her in the next room.  Her door was open, had a client so we waited for a bit, took forever so we walked out contacted ramada corporate to file a verbal complaint, they were apologetic, logged our complaint, attempted to set us up in another location.

I have been a long time customer at this location and have always felt good about the service that I have received. Today was no exception for my oil change. I don't write in today to talk about the service that I received, but wanted to comment on another customer situation that if observed while I was in the lobby waiting for my service.\n \nWhen I entered the store this morning there was a female customer in front of me that was quite emotional and upset with a situation concerning motor mounts on her car. She was very hard to deal with and as I listened to the conversation, even with my limited knowledge of auto repair, I could tell that she was completely in the wrong. She was loud, rude, demanding and very emotional. Customers are NOT always right!\n\nI have spent the past 20 years of my career leading large customer service organizations, so I am no stranger to dealing with upset customers. This customer issue was being handled by Chad, one of your front people for this location. I was blown away by how professionally he handled the situation. He hit every point I would have ever expected from one of my customer service Associates. He stayed calm even when the customer was not being rational, was clearly in the wrong and even personally attacked him verbally. He maintained his composure, sat down with the customer, listened, repeated what he heard her saying, stayed focused on the customer and the issue. He showed empathy and concern, he worked hard to let her know that he cared about her and her situation. He reviewed everything in detail with her, even bringing the part into the store so he could demonstrate the issue with her. He gave her options and did everything he could to help her resolve the issue. He was focused on making her happy and meeting her needs while protecting the integrity of the organization as other customers were in the lobby.\nI don't often take the time to recognize amazing customer service, but I felt compelled today to point out what an amazing job Chad did with this customer. If Chad were in the same industries that I manage, I would offer him a position today. I just wish that all of my associates showed the same passion for the customer and business that Chad did today. You should be very proud of Chad and I certainly hope the you show these kind of Associates recognition for representing your company in such a positive way as they are the face of the organization for customers like me.\n\nKudos to Chad for doing an amazing job today!\n\nYour Long Time Loyal Customer", "business_id": "8SlI_CYByLG23erfzobK2Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-04-17", "type": "review"}

He laughed at me, then proceeded to tell me that doctors don't do that sort of thing anymore. I was practically begging for something to make my son comfortable, and he wouldn't listen. \n\nHe ordered an x-ray, which let us know my son had some chest inflammation going on. No kidding! He's violently coughing and complaining his chest hurts. Groundbreaking! He gave my son a teeny, tiny shot of a liquid steroid last night in the room, and they failed to put what he was given or how much on his discharge papers. Currently waiting until they open so I can call and confirm what he was given. We were sent home with an inhaler with the same medication he's been using at home, after I explained that its not working. \n\nIDK if I will come back to this location. Dr. Young is truly a piece of work, and I can't understand why he is a children's doctor of all things.

Even if it was, it was inappropriate and unnecessary to tell my child this.   If it were truly an issue (which it is not), I would expect Dr. Ravi to discuss it with me privately.  Little souls are sensitive and Dr. Ravi should know better.  \n\nBottom line- telling a sick child (or any child) that they are \"odd\" is cruel and this interaction totally tainted what was otherwise a good experience at PCH urgent care.", "business_id": "2bD-KHkntojDT1vqUlRSmQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-03-22", "type": "review"}

To get all my acrylic and other nail stuff that I need. I have my own fully setup nail salon room in my condo. I got sick of all the shops out here screwing up my nails and not being able to do the crazy wild designs I like. I know quite a bit about nails been getting them done at shop for years until I started doing my own. So when I started setting up I was looking for decent price stuff locally but I didn't want to wait to get shipped to me from Amazon. This store is very small but it has everything that you need. But nothing is priced literally u have to ask the price for everything which i feel like changes depending on the owners mood. Actually he's not even the owner, he's the owners brother. The owner works at the Peoria location.  The only reason why I like this store slightly more than Hollywood is because the pricing tends to be better but I feel like Hollywood has kind of a bigger selection just barely tho. The other drawback here why doesn't get 5 stars is that the owner it's kind of rude and short and I come into this place about once every week and spend anywhere from 30 to 80 dollars EVERY week mind you...You would think that they would be a little bit more polite to returning customers especially when I have questions about certain products and things like that. It seems like if there's any Vietnamese people that come into the shop they get a lot more help than me being Caucasian. Which kind of sucks because I don't discriminate against them why do they have to be like that to us? I've had other girlfriends of mine go in there to get supplies for me to when coming over to get nails done and they've said the same thing that the owner is very rude and short and he'll ask them if they work in a shop when they say no...he laughs like scoffs. This is the only real big drawback that I hate about spending money here and my money is just as good as the shops I may not do as high volume of business but you're open to the public so maybe you guys should start acting like that.", "business_id": "Q_lBAysdntSb4ySUtMpoDw", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-04-07", "type": "review"}

I went on a Sunday at around 5PM. The place is really dark inside and i wish they had more lights on (Since there are lots of lights that were turned off).  It felt like a bar inside. \n\nThe hostess was very nice, but after about 10 minutes waiting for someone to take my order, or heck, even bring me water or tea, I was starting to get frustrated already.  There were only about 4 other tables occupied, and I was wondering what the holdup was.  Eventually the hostess came back over to me and asked if I was still waiting to get my order taken.  I said yes, no one has come yet.  She said she would take my order and give it to my waitress. \n\nI was thinking, why can't my waitress just take it???  Regardless, I gave my order to the hostess, and she walked to the back of the room where my waitress was sitting the whole time reading a newspaper.  (Maybe she was on a break?)  She gave the order to her, and this somehow turned into the hostess screaming across the room to me.. \"What did you order again?!\" \n\nI was appalled but regardless I yelled back my order across the room.  Apparently, she couldn't hear and yelled again and asked if I said chicken or pork.  I was getting really bugged.  This is not the way ordering should work.  *facepalm.   I said chicken loudly across the room again, and finally I see the hostess go into the kitchen with my order, not my waitress! \n\nThe hostess brought out my soup, and i asked her if she was going to be my waitress and she said no, \"I'm just the hostess and your waitress is back there.\"  To make matters more confusing, a different waitress brought me my tea I have been waiting on.  I was regretting my decision to come here, but the soup was actually OK, and despite the horrible service thus far, if the rest of my food was good, I would be happy. That's all i wanted after all, just some good Chinese food.  \n\nI had ordered the Peking chicken, but I saw my waitress bring back something that definitely didn't look like Peking chicken (since its one of my favorite dishes other places) and when she set it down on my table, it looked and smelled horrible.  I asked if it was Peking chicken, and she said yes.  Anyway, the smell was really nasty.  Somewhat like a strong ketchup smell, and unfortunately, it tasted even nastier.  The chicken was extremely fatty and I couldn't even guess if it was chicken.  I really don't think it was.  The sauce it was swimming in was horrible too and like its smell, pretty much tasted like a strong concoction of ketchup and sugar.... It was the most horrible thing I tasted I couldn't finish more then half of it, and they don't give you much at all. \n\nIf I had liked the dish, I would say it was very under-portioned compared to what you are used to getting at Chinese restaurants. At the end of my meal, I had such a horrible taste in my mouth, I just wanted to leave as soon as possible, chew gum, brush my teeth, or purge myself.  It was that bad. \n\nBut I needed my bill.  Likewise, no one checked on me my whole meal, and now no one was bringing my bill.  My waitress was still sitting in the back of the room reading the newspaper, so i alerted the hostess to get my bill, and she went to the back of the room, got the bill off the waitress and the hostess brought it back to me!  What the heck!  My waitress didn't do anything. \n\nI left and slipped the hostess a few dollars, and I'll never go back again. Worst Chinese food I ever had, bad service, and under portioned. I don't say this often since people have varying opinions on what is good, but I really would say avoid this restaurant.", "business_id": "CuYHDItnOSfSlPfPDA9Btw", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-05-09", "type": "review"}

I don't frequent the restaurant part, as I end of spending most of my time in the bar area.  As a member of the Dobson Ranch Men's Club, this bar area serves as the gathering point for the men's club golfers before and after rounds. \n\nThe breakfast menu offers a variety of food. I have especially enjoyed the large stack of pancakes.  This is one of the best places I have found in the valley for pancakes. Forget I-Hop, Village Inn or the other chains, I would go here for breakfast over most other places. \n\nAlso on the menu for breakfast are stuffed French Toast.  French Toast filled with cream cheese filling.  Will probably be my next tasting...\n\nHave also had the hamburgers, wings and dogs for food during my many visits. Friday, had a club sandwich with fries in a to-go box on my way to out for a round of golf.  Now I will admit I was very hungry, but these were some of the best fries I have had in some time. \n\nLocated just south of Baseline on Dobson Road in the Dobson Ranch Golf Course, if you are looking for a breakfast without any lines or waiting, stop by... I think you will find a new hidden gem for breakfast...\n\nOnly downside, it is a little more pricey than the usual.

Our cat was diagnosed with leukemia last year, and we saw the last vet several times without answers to simple questions.  Dr. Barnard answered all of our questions with more than just a simple, dumbed-down answer. And he didn't act like he couldn't wait to get out of the room, which has been our experience with every other vet we've tried.  When I thanked him for taking the time to answer all of our questions, he acted like it was no big deal, like it's normal operating procedure... which makes me a happy kittie-mama.\n\nNot only did he answer our questions, he came up with solutions to problems that the other vet just ignored.  Like the fact that the medicine that she needs is so nasty tasting, she spits it out and there's no way to get her to take it orally.  Dr. Barnard suggested a trans-dermal med we put straight into her ear.\n\nAnd to top it off, the bills, tests, and medicines were less expensive than our last vet.  Significantly less expensive.  And instead of getting tests that we didn't need, he figured out what needed to be done and we did that.  And then, he wrote us an Rx for a human pharmacy because buying the same med from him was more expensive.  Saved us $25 just in that act.  And then to top it off, the pet pharmacy he sent us to was soooo much cheaper than the last vet's.  The last vet was $130 for a one month supply of the oral.  This one was $31.90 for a 2-month supply of the trans-dermal!  \n\nI highly recommend this vet and will do so to all my family and friends.", "business_id": "e2BmliYf0c-P7sDzL4miYw", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-04-19", "type": "review"}

I really truly wish I could give it a better rating based on the fact that there are a few servers and other staff that are really great and it used to be a well run restaurant. However, things have gone downhill the last year and I couldn't recommend it to anyone.\nThe last two visits we have made have both been for birthday dinners. Last visit left us a little less than satisfied with inattentive servers, being seated next to a group of 30 who decided they could take up half the room for their office party complete with applause, and waiting 20 minutes past everyone else's food arriving for my entree which was then so hot I had to take it home to eat. I went ahead and filled out the online survey, marked that I wasn't opposed to having a manager call me, and NOTHING. I was hoping it was a bad night and this time it would be better. Unfortunately it wasn't.\n\nWe have a large family group and are used to waiting, no big deal. An hour wait when quoted 40 minutes on a Sunday night when the lobby is empty (and some whispers amongst the hosts about not wanting to seat certain servers because they want to go home) gets a little annoying, but I digress. \nWe are sat at a table pushed together almost right in a traffic area(we were paranoid of getting elbows and trays to the head the whole time) and one flustered server gave the greeting and walked away without taking any drink orders. At this point we had 3 small children who already were getting tired as it was nearing bedtime after the wait. Waiting for drinks and putting orders in took forever, when we finally brought salads and soups it was already past 9 PM. Then we sat with empty app dishes in front of us for a good 20 minutes with no sign of servers. When my entree came out(shrimp ravioli type dish which was good but nothing amazing) the whole side and bottom of the plate had mashed potatoes on it. I'm hoping someone in our party had mashed potatoes. After eating a bit, most of us were just ready to go home at this point, the kids were sleeping in their chairs, we had to flag down our server who was cleaning tables across the room and ask for our check. We had asked for two cakes earlier for the birthday guy and as we were asking them to just cancel that, the server insisted he had them all set and waiting to go he was just waiting for checks(huh?). So they brought out the cakes and the two servers tried to get our party to sing happy birthday. Poor birthday guy got the most pathetic and tired birthday song ever. When the bill came, that automatic 15% tip added to each bill was just a slap in the face. I know it's customary but being large tippers generally, not having a choice in the matter was offensive at that point. Not to mention the fact that the servers had to have known that our meal took a ridiculous amount of time and we were far from happy, but there was no sign of the manager all night and it was far below what we have come to expect from any Darden restaurant. \n\nWe won't be going back to this location if we can help it.", "business_id": "scVOmQsf5HSY3n9CG06tFA", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-03-12", "type": "review"}

I have since had falafel elsewhere convinced it was good because I understand the Greeks and Hebrews eat it like popcorn and I have found places with great falafel, just not here as the other rave reviews would suggest. BUT they have great Adas soup. It was really spicy in a good way and nice and creamy. So I can't explain the falafel failure. Overpriced for what you get.

I don't want to add up how many times that is but 2000 might be reasonable. I have to admit that the location is a bit weird, its a strange little mall tucked away from the street.  The sign has letters I don't understand.  \n\nI went there because one of my techs was called to work on one of their refrigerated cases and told me how nice it was.   I went in there and did not tell them anything about my guys working there.  They were so incredibly nice and helpful I could not believe it.  When I told them that is was my first time there they patiently explained everything on the menu to me and even brought me samples of some items I had not had before.  \n\nThe shwarma is my favorite for the meats (both chicken and beef) but everything I have tried is fresh and flavorful.  Their kabobs use good quality meat that isn't too chewy.  I am a total hummus snob and make my own frequently.  Theirs is made fresh every day and tastes as good as my home made if not better.  In fact my wife bought some at Costco today and it was so bad in comparison that it made me remember I had to give these people a good review.   You can buy the same ingredients in the attached store and if you ask they will tell you which ones are best.   The have great pita bread in the freezer you can warm up and is better than any other pita bread around here.  Their prices in both the restaurant and deli are very reasonable for the quality of the food.\n\nAnother reviewer mentioned wiping the tables with the same rag as they wiped the tables.  I have seen multiple restaurants do this and as long as the rag has proper disinfectant I do not see anything wrong with it. In fact -- think about it -- you almost always put your hands down on a booth when  you slide in, then you eat with them!  I am GLAD they wipe down the booths with disinfectant.    I like this place because it is clean, you can see back into the kitchen and see how they keep it.  I don't think giving such a low rating for what seems to be a standard practice is very fair. \n\nYes, the different tiles in the dining room a a bit weird, but it is only like 1/4\" difference.  The location is a little different as is the layout.  In the first of this review I mentioned I had driven buy it literally thousands of times over the last 13 years. It seemed a little odd and I missed out all that time by not exploring it.  If you don't like exploring a little different cultures go to McDonald's.  These are hard working people who make the best food they know how, make it fresh and are incredibly nice.  They have some very beautiful women working there who are also very nice and helpful.  The whole place is maybe a little different than we are used to in Mesa but if you want interesting and flavorful experience stop there and give them a try.", "business_id": "4rr-CJp0jMKr-kg9wnrTdw", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-04-18", "type": "review"}

Over the course of time I have unfortunately seen the quality of this place slip.  I used to really enjoy this place.  The Princess Combo was good.  \n\nI went to Princess last night with my wife.  We ordered the Princess Combo.  The following are some of the observations noted:\n\n1) The cleanliness of the place has slipped.  Please clean your booths and tables (the tables and the floors).  It was nearly impossible to find a clean table.  Cleanliness is something that my wife and I do not compromise on.  We have been to the developing world, and even with that, we still find restaurants in the developing world much cleaner.  \n\n2) Some of the dishes need to be cleaned better.  I had a water glass that was stained, and asked for a new glass.  Please pay attention to this.  \n\n3) My wife found the beef or lamb kabab, in the Princess Combo (do not know which one it was) as being very chewy (inedible).  We enjoy kababs but it was just too chewy.  We could not determine if it was beef or lamb.  It was just too chewy.  Either it was overcooked, or undercooked (I am guessing overcooked...it was not red or raw).\n\nMy wife and I have experienced Middle Eastern and Mediterranean food and we love it.  We have been to that part of the world, and have many friends who are from that part of the world.  \n\nAlso, a lot of my colleagues where I work know that I tend to find restaurants that are \"diamonds in the rough\".  I used to think that Princess was one of them.  I am questioning this now.  \n\nMany of my colleagues are former military, and politics aside, they have been deployed in the Middle East, and they remember that corner cafe or related in Saudi, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Turkey, etc.  They acquired that taste while serving there.  They often ask me about places I recommend for Middle Eastern food.  I used to recommend this place.  I am questioning whether to recommend this place now.  \n\nPlease take a long and hard look at your place:\n\n1) Clean it up\n2) Figure out what has changed (for the worse), and fix it as far as food\n\nI trust that you have a good people who mean well.  Perhaps a little training may be all that is needed.  \n\nYou have a good \"product\" or \"service\", you just need to burnish your image a little bit in order to \"return\" to what I would call a 5 star rating.  \n\nI recommend you do it soon so that the reputation of the place is not tarnished.

We ordered the Mu Shu Pork, crispy duck and Peking Pan Fried noodles.\n\nThe service was wonderful and courteous. Now, when they bring out the hot tea without asking and its complimentary, that is old school and what I am used to. The crispy wonton skins was an added plus.\n\nThe waitress made up the mu shu pork with the pan cakes. They used a lot of bean sprouts which took away some of the flavor but it still was good. As for the Peking Pan Fried noodles, I guess I like the Hong Kong style of noodles better which is more crisp. It looked like they added the Chow King noodles from the can and had the sauce soften them. Again, there were a lot of bean sprouts in the dish. The crispy duck was good, but my wife thought it was a little dry. I loved it. Told her she should have ordered the Roast Duck instead.\n\nTo top it off, we were given a fortune cookie and a wonton puff  with honey inside and powdered sugar on top. Nice way to end the meal. BTW, I had enough left over to enjoy lunch the next day.", "business_id": "PNrOTfMmE0CJFV9YwSLzYw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-03-06", "type": "review"}

The tea is excellent and so are the egg rolls. It's also very difficult to find a restaurant that makes a good Egg Foo Young...Golden Gate's is superb! So is their Lemon Chicken, Kung Po, Moo Shoo, and pretty much everything else on the menu. There's only one other tiny problem with Golden Gate...they're located next to a sewer treatment center. Sometimes the smell on the walk just through the parking lot is unbearable. There's nothing they can do about the location, other than move, which isn't possible when you've been in the same spot for as many years as they have.

Traditional chinese decor without being gaudy.  Quickly treated to free tea and  served crispy, fresh, non-greasy noodles.  How attentive!  Even the table has the traditional condiments right on it (soy sauce, real-hot mustard, duck sauce).  Nowadays you have to ask for these as restaurants are cutting down, and the mustard is not the great strong Chinese mustard--it is a watered down type.  Ordered soups: egg drop which had bits of chicken in it and wonton.  The egg drop was very good and the broth of the wonton soup was delicious--the wontons lacked meat inside or at least one of the wonton did not have meat but for $2.25 each I cannot complain about a thing! \nOrdered Schezehan chicken,chicken fried rice and shrimp with lobster sauce.  I wanted to try the shrimp with lobster sauce after the fiasco I experienced at Qwik Chinese Bistro in Scottsdale.  You can read the details in that review.  This one did not let me down.  12 large shrimp in a nice, non-sweet sauce with water chestnuts.  Lovely and delicious.  Made me forget about the prior fiasco.  The chicken fried rice was a large, delicious plate of a multi-ingredient rice. Wow, and they added bean sprouts which i think really makes it even better.  The Schezuhan chicken was made without breading and spicy just as he ordered it.  What a great meal this was.  With our check came the typical fortune cookies AND as a bonus, wontons filled with mashed bananas with powered sugar.  These were better than you might expect.  Such a simple treat and yet so delicious.  They didn't have to do this but they did.  The service was spot-on without being overbearing.  I had to bag up the shrimp and lobster sauce that's how large the portion was.\nBTW, pricing is very reasonable and the service was impeccable.  \nThanks to all at GOLDEN GATE who made this delicious meal possible!", "business_id": "PNrOTfMmE0CJFV9YwSLzYw", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-05-03", "type": "review"}

I found Rose Nails when I had to mail something at the Post Office next store and I was happy that I did. I was running late to my go-to place and therefore got bumped. My fault, not theirs:) I didn't leave work on time. :( I remembered that I saw Rose Nails on Dobson and Guadalupe and decided to give it a try. It was much bigger on the inside than it looks on the outside. They had an opening so I quickly grab a polish (didn't like the color once it was on.... but oh well) and sat my booty into the spa chair. They have a range of pedicures on the \"menu\" from basic ($18) to deluxe ($60). The basic is what I usually get since I go about once a week. I am very hard on the \"peds\". The technician was one of the owners and he was pleasant and just let me read my gossip magazine without needless chit-chat. The \"basic\" includes a foot soak, polish removal, file, cuticle work, light callous work, foot and lower leg massage and application of polish. The pedicure is supposed to last about a half an hour, but he really took his time and my pedicure was about 45 min. Nice! Thanks!!! I think he gave me a little extra in the massage department. It was much needed. Over all it was a great experience. The reasons I didn't give it 5 stars were as follows: 1-the place could have been a bit cleaner (the shop seemed cluttered and unorganized), 2-a basketball game was playing on both TV's and didn't really give the \"spa\" atmosphere, and 3-my callouses are still pretty rough.

I contacted Big Two Mitsubishi to inquire about a used car they had advertised.  The initial inquiry went well.  A salesperson named Nissa answered my questions via email.  Because I was looking at several cars around the valley, I didn't get back to her right away, so she started getting pushy about me coming in to test drive the car.  I agreed to come in after work, but when I got to the dealership for the test drive, she handed me over to another salesperson, who was new but very nice.  I liked the car and was ready to deal, so we walked back in to the dealership and Nissa took over again.  She was sitting at a desk in the middle of their building.  Started the sales process right there, in front of other salespeople and customers.  I was standing, and since it was at the end of a long work day, I would really have appreciated being offered a seat, preferably in an office area so we could talk and negotiate more comfortably and not in a public setting.  \n\nIt ended up that the chair wasn't needed.  Nissa quickly became combative and unwilling to negotiate at all, especially given the condition of the vehicle.  She claimed that Big Two had put lots of money into reconditioning the car, so I asked for the service records to see what they had done.  You would have thought I'd asked for the holy grail.  She was visibly angry and I was ready to walk out when the assistant GM came over.  He had heard some of the conversation was was more than willing to pull the service records for me.  \n\nI offered a fair starting price for negotiations with Nissa.  She refused to budge from her extremely inflated number.  You would think that in a case like this, knowing I needed a car, she would at least offer other options if we were not going to be able to come to an agreement on that car.  NOPE.  Nothing.  I have never had such a bad experience with customer service, even in the automobile sales industry.  \n\nWhile I appreciated Bob's efforts, they were not enough to make up for the aggressive, rude behavior of his sales person.  I will NEVER go back to Big Two Mitsubishi.  Given that I bought a Toyota and live in Chandler, now I'm going to have to think very hard about whether I will take my car to Big Two Toyota.

The place was clean with a number of useless aquaria, meaning that they were not attractive, not kept properly and scum had accumulated on the glass.  The purpose of an aquarium is to bring some beauty to the surroundings.  This was not the case but the least of this restaurant's problems.  \nThe pricing was rather inexpensive and was surprised that the lunch combinations included 3 choices plus fried rice for 5.89.  Crazy, right?  I ordered the pork chow mein, vegetable egg foo yung & an egg roll as my choices to be accompanied with fried rice.  My eating partner just had an egg drop soup.  It took a while for the orders to come so I took that as a sign that everything was freshly prepared.  \nThe orders came in styrofoam containers.  My pork chow mein was a 2 on a scale of 5, the vegetarian egg foo yung came as a hockey puck so I would say it is also a 2, the egg roll was small (that's Ok) with veggies.  It was not over fried.  The fried rice that came with the dish was inedible---hard grains of rice stuck together.  You had to put a fork in it to dislodge the grains.  I did not eat it.  I ate what I could of the combination keeping in mind that I had only paid $5.89 for it.  The egg drop soup looked gelatinous--full of corn starch, but the person eating it said it was not bad. Does that also mean not good?  \nThe woman who took our order and our payment never came by to ask how the food was which to me is an indicator that a restauranteur takes his/her  business seriously.  You certainly want customer feedback.  I would not have been cruel but instead made constructive suggestions.  I still don't understand why they give a choice of 3 items for the combos.  That is taxing on the cook--making 3 dishes for each lunch ordered UNLESS, UNLESS... it is all pre-prepared and all he is doing is re-heating it on the wok.  Just thinking.... \nAnyway, this is NOT a place where I will ever be seen again.  I usually give restaurants a second go round, but I cannot do it here.  The food is just too sub-par. Frankly, I don't know how they stay in business.  \n If this restaurant had been really good, I would have driven from home (13 miles away) to eat here--that's how loyal I am to a good restaurant.  \nStay away folks.... there is nothing here that you want.", "business_id": "bxToHIsD37NjEsW_eE92mA", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-03-23", "type": "review"}

I have never lived somewhere so totally unprofessional and awful. Even the budget suites where I was living prior to this place was a thousand times more well maintained and managed.\n\nFirst off, the apartment we moved into looked like it had been remodeled by a three year old. There were carpet tacks jutting out, the sliding glass door frames were bent and the doors would not slide right, there was human hair painted onto the walls in multiple places, stains on the ceiling of my bedroom, no molding in the living room. There were nails sticking out of every door way, there were planks that were deteriorated to the point of falling apart on the porch outside. There were popcorn ceilings even though the model we had been shown did not have them. The model looks great, and what they actually give you is totally slummy and disgusting. There were issues with the electric, most of the outlets wouldn't hold a plug, and it was like the power was turned up to high because all our bulbs would break every other time we flipped a switch. It took months and months to get them to actually finish cleaning up the apartment to an acceptable level. The laundry facilities were always broken down and DISGUSTING like they never bothered to clean in there, there were random holes in the walls of the outside that were not ever fixed while I was living there. There was always issues with the lights turning on much too late, or not at all, and it made getting around in the dark very difficult. The sprinklers were always broken and shooting water 20 feet in the air creating giant puddles every where. Sometimes the one outside our bedroom window would break and it would spray water into our room. Even after they were \"fixed\" five seconds later they would be broken again.\n\nBut worse than the awful apartment, was the MANAGER!!! Totally unproffesional and vindictive, she made it a point to harass us again and again because we had contacted her boss over the poor state of the apartment. All our neighbors would set their trash outside their door before taking it down, yet we were the only ones who got cited for it. She smoked right outside the office and the smell would drift into our apartment like she was standing there and doing it on purpose. It was very clear she did not like us because we rocked the boat, but we had thought we were moving into a decent place and this place turned out to be a total slum. On one occasion after we had written a letter to her boss she actually came up stairs to yell at us while I was in the middle of cooking dinner. She said she smelled something funny, and 15 minutes later we had the cops knocking on our door saying they had an anonymous tip that someone smelled drugs. We invited them in and of course they found absolutely nothing, and they couldn't smell anything but the salmon and squash we were cooking. The tip was \"anonymous\" but we knew very well it was her just being spiteful because she had gotten in trouble. We were eventually let out of our lease because the poor state of the apartment and the fact that they could not seem to fix things in a timely manner. This is one of the worst places to live in this area and you can get so much better for the price.

I expect a lot. This review is sincere and written by a real resident of Sycamore Square. I signed a one year lease and moved in June 2014. I had problems with the unit and the property, cosmetically mostly, as soon I moved in. In fact the issues were too numerous to name so I'm not going to go into specific details except to say the unit was not well put together upon move in and the property was kind of a mess. I had issues with the management as well, and ended up speaking with a supervisor at MEB management whom was very helpful and respectful. She explained that the property manager was relatively new in the position and put in place specifically to get the property back in order. They corrected everything that was wrong with my unit and fully accommodated me. They hired new maintenance guys who are great! The property is much cleaner and prettier now and my neighbors are all quiet, hardworking, families and students. They do NOT have a bug problem, my unit is clean clean clean in that aspect.

They tried to make me pay fees that I never even owed in the first place. They even harassed me and my roommate at times. When I talk to my neighbors everybody feels the same towards the management.

I took them to small claims court and even the judge couldn't understand all the crap the managers were spewing from their mouths trying to defend themselves.

My roommate and I went in to the front office on the 29th of a month and the following month we were to move out. We went in to figure out how much we had to pay for the rest of our lease.  The employee we saw on the 29th supposedly told us how much we had to pay to finish of the lease to be able move out.  We paid exactly what we were told to pay exactly on time. Then about 11 days later we received a call saying we were behind on rent and hadn't turned in a 60 day notice on our lease.  They tried to make us pay a late fee because we didn't pay the right amount even though we spoke to an employee days before that. We got them to waive the late fee but they made us pay 2 months rent for months we were not even living in the apartment complex. Their excuse was that we failed to give them a notice of us moving out even though we came in on the 29th of the month saying we were going to leave!! We ended up paying an extra 680$ for the whole fiasco. We paid rent for an extra month and a half even though we had moved out. They probably got somebody to move in when we moved out immediately to get double rent income for that month and a half.  Indian springs also is the most environmentally unfriendly place I have ever lived at. There is not one recycling garbage in the entire complex everyone's garbage goes straight to the trash my I have seen people throw an entire truck load of cardboard and paper bags straight to the garbage. Disgusting and extremely unresponsible if you ask me. Also they waist so much money on hiring leaf blowers that wake you up at 7 am sometimes to blow like 5 leaves out of the road. Their laundry room machines break half the time you use them I spent literally 20 minutes trying to feed quarters into one because it wouldn't take a quarter. They do a horrible job of picking up garbage. The entire south wall is covered in garbage on the outside, its a horrible sight.  Oh ya and our air conditioner broke in August so we told them to fix it. It took them three days. Three sleepless sweaty nights with no ac in the middle of an Arizona summer. Then when they \"fixed\" it they tried to blame it on us. They said we turned the ac down to low and it broke. Sorry for trying to not sweat to death, Obviously we are going to turn the ac down if its not working. We aren't mechanics we don't know how to handle an ac machine. I put \"fixed\" in parentheses because they fixed it for a week and then it broke down again. This went on for a few months they would fix it and it would just break the next day we eventually just said screw it. And we didn't have ac between the months of October and may.

They have multiple locations which makes getting supplies pretty convenient across the valley.  Plus it's all commercial grade stuff!  No joke!  Don't plan on Home Depot prices because this stuff is not diluted and is literally the commercial stuff.  I went in to get an arsenal to destroy all scorpion life around my house and walked out with a few different types of chemicals and a sprayer for $230.  I got the nicer sprayer which was $75 and the chemicals turned out to be  about $150 which I was told should last about 6 months.  That's only $25/month for COMPLETE coverage and a 3-stage protection barrier for my house!\n\nNot only do they sell the good stuff, but they will teach you how to mix it, how to store it and how to use it!  Pretty awesome service!  They even offered to service my sprayer for free when necessary.  I will definitely be going into the bug control business at my house.  This way I know it's done thoroughly and done right with the right chemicals at the right concentration.  \n\nPlus these guys have a little bug display that is cool for little kids and big kids like me!\n\nHere's a link on how to do it right.\nhttp://bugweedmart.com/what%E2%80%99s-bugging-you/scorpions/\n\nTHANK YOU BUG AND WEED MART!", "business_id": "2OVyzv2RFtk6QQmhFpGj1g", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-05-19", "type": "review"}

The chefs are entertaining and friendly, and the atmosphere is nice enough for dates or out-of-town guests, yet casual enough for families. The teppanyaki is truly as much about the show as the dinner. And speaking of dinner, it is worth the trip alone.", "business_id": "42xKe5YcCIKmGiqW0i4aGw", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-03-27", "type": "review"}

Very bland, krab used, and lots of rice used in their rolls. The sashimi is decent but there are definitely better places in the area. The teppanyaki is another story! The fried rice is awesome, its a lot of fun, the steak, chicken and scallops are delicious. It is a bit pricey but very fun. The owner is a nice guy, unfortunately if you don't understand how the tipping works with your teppanyaki cook and they waitress you will be bothered about it. We tipped our teppanyaki cook $40 and our waitress was awful so we only tipped her $15 or $20. She came back to our table and asked if we were unhappy with our service and she even broke down how the tipping was handled with her, the cook and the bus boys. It was very embarrassing and upsetting! That alone has kept me away for almost a year! So sad! So don't over tip the cook, he gets a cut of your waitresses tip.", "business_id": "42xKe5YcCIKmGiqW0i4aGw", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-03-01", "type": "review"}

We were seated at a table with another guy, who lived nearby and seemed to visit the place often (as gathered from his conversation with the chef). We both ordered the steak and what a great meal it was. I was in awe watching him make the fried rice... awesome. \n\nCan't wait to go back :)", "business_id": "42xKe5YcCIKmGiqW0i4aGw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-03-28", "type": "review"}

The chef's aren't usually Japanese, but they do a great job none the less.  The food is wonderful and despite the strip mall exterior, the inside is nice.  It's way better than Benihana in my opinion.", "business_id": "42xKe5YcCIKmGiqW0i4aGw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-05-13", "type": "review"}
