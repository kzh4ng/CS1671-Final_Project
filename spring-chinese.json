I typically opt to sit at the bar, where the service has always been extremely personable and fast.\n\nThe food is typical PF Chang's: delicious. As one of the chains that provides their nutritional information, it's also nice to know that I can go there and eat somewhat healthy (I'm all about the orange peel shrimp and steamed shrimp dumplings). While some complain about the portion sizes being too small, I've always felt like they were perfect. I do understand how someone looking at a $15 plate of \"Chinese\" food could wonder why he or she is paying more for less than your standard Chinese restaurant, but it's never bothered me. Most of the meals are consistently good, freshly prepared, and full of flavor. Plus, the sauce that your waiter/waitress makes for you is always a nice addition to any meal. I've tried most of the apps, soups, and quite a few of their entr\u00e9es and have never been disappointed.\n\nI've only had one negative experience at this location in the countless times that I've gone, and it revolved around service in the main dining area. I was there for lunch, and the waitress essentially disappeared. I'm not sure if she had been fired, quit, or what, but she took the order and was never seen again. After sitting there for what seemed like an eternity with empty drinks, etc., I finally had to ask if someone else was going to be our server. I had never experienced something like that, but I received free food vouchers for a future visit, and luckily I wasn't in a rush that day, so it worked out. The experience would've made me give the location a worse rating, but one bad experience hasn't outweighed the countless positives: good meals, solid service (especially at the bar), and great takeout service for large orders and smaller ones.\n\nThe only other knock on this location - and it applies to every PF Chang's I've been to - is the insane wait that you'll encounter at dinner time. My wife and I would actually go there more often if we didn't have to wait forever for a table. I love PF Chang's, but I hate waiting more. If you live close enough, get curbside pick-up, or just find somewhere else. I've yet to meet a restaurant worth a 2-hour wait.

But since that restaurant is undergoing renovations, I was forced to try something new.\n\nSo... I thought I'd try the chain PF Chang's Chinese Restaurant at the Waterfront. Wow, what an unsatisfying mistake that turned out to be.\n\nI started with a cup of their Wonton soup. At $2.95 it wasn't too outrageous of a price, the broth had some flavor and there was much more in it than I was used to, including three giant basil (I think?) leafs that covered everything beneath. In the broth were chunks of chicken, two shrimp, some sliced water chestnuts and two \"pork\"-filled wontons. As I said, the broth had decent flavor, but the wontons were thick, doughy and under-cooked, and the chicken chunks were dry, which is amazing since they were drowned in broth! On a scale of bad to good, it was kind of meh.\n\nNext came my \"lunch-portion\" order of Chang's Kung Pao Chicken (the dinner portion is $5 more). \n\nAt the New Dumpling House, this dish is served with a delectable dark, rich, tangy sauce, which I was really hoping for... Not at PF Chang's. \n\nOn my plate I received about 8 quarter-size chunks of lightly breaded and browned chicken, 7 hot Chinese red chili peppers (mostly inedible unless they are diced into a sauce), a handful of blanched, unsalted peanuts, a few sliced scallions, and a bed of the most bland brown rice I have ever encountered. Uncle Ben would've been ashamed if that stuff came out of one of his boxes.\n\nGlaringly, there was NO SAUCE!. None at all.\n\nI've had Kung Pao Chicken in New York City, San Francisco, and even from a hole in the wall in Bethel Park, PA that was much, much better. Never have I had it served in such a bland, skimpy, and overpriced way! The \"lunch-portion\" cost was $9.95.\n\nAt The New Dumpling House, I could have a delicious lunch, with soup, entree and complimentary hot tea, and I could leave satisfied with just $8 out-of-pocket -- and that includes the tip.\n\nThe service was decent. However, lesson learned. One and done. Never going back to PF Changs.", "business_id": "JDDeaNfb0JXD1NbznSIC9g", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-05-09", "type": "review"}

I live in the Banksville area and have been searching for a decent place for Chinese takeout for years. Particularly, my wife and I have been searching for a restaurant with ample, fresh veggies (with rice and brown sauce or with lo mein) and crisp, tasty tofu. I called Tong's for the first time without referencing a menu and simply described what I was looking for over the phone. They said, \"Yep, we can do that\" and then told me it'd be ready in 20 minutes.\n\nI got there and it's as unpretentious as the reviews say. A regular walked in behind me and asked where the kid was and apparently he was in vacation in China. While waiting for my food (I was early), I perused the menu and noticed that what I had ordered (mixed veggies w/ brown sauce and an order of General Tso's tofu) didn't exist on the menu. I was charged a reasonable amount in spite of this and it turned out pretty good. Not my favorite tofu to date (Mandarin Gourmet downtown wins that) but definitely satisfied my craving. Vegetables were also very, very good. They included zucchini, carrots, broccoli, onions and other good stuff without the typical \"filler\" veggies that you find at cheaper places. With that being said, this place was a buck or two cheaper than everywhere else I've tried in a 10 mile radius. \n\nBottom-line: Best Chinese restaurant this side of the tunnels.

This place is a little piece of heaven for vegetarians and vegans, but omnis won't know the difference.\n\nI've visited this location a handful of times, and each experience has been nothing but pleasant. I have tried the fried mushrooms, the sesame soy protein, the orange soy protein, the sweet & sour soy protein, the wheat gluten veggie mix, the general tso soy protein and the hot and sour soup. \n\nMy favorite is the sesame soy protein, but I plan to try all of the soy protein dishes at some point. The wheat gluten is tasty, but it's not the best I've ever had. I prefer the meaty and solid texture of the soy protein over tofu and wheat gluten. \n\nThe spicy dishes are never spicy. You can always ask for extra chile paste like I do though. It's weird that they aren't spicy enough, but that could be because this area isn't as likely to have a preference for the spicy foods. \n\nMy last visit here on April 1st was definitely the most memorable. The sweetest young male was our server. He forgot sesame on our sesame soy protein, and he apologized profusely and fixed it. He kept bringing us refills, especially on my diet coke. Restaurants can be a little stingy with soda refills, but he was generous. He also gave us free rice refills, and since we all love rice, we were immensely grateful. I can't say enough good things about this kid, but I hope the tip we left him conveyed our gratitude.\n\nChina Palace is a win for sure!", "business_id": "Q9BXMPu2HnRDMq9X_2rHrQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-03-31", "type": "review"}

I really like sushi, but I don't like having to always drive into the city for decent sushi.  I recently discovered this place just a couple of miles from my house located in the suburbs.  I've tried it twice now.  The first time I was a little nervous about trying the sushi... again, due to its location.  Fox Chapel is better known for Starbucks rather than good ethnic food.  I had the curried chicken and the steamed dumplings.  These were both of good quality.  I thought the curry with the chicken lacked a little flavor, but I'm from the caribbean and used to west indian curry.  The dumplings were nice because they actually were light and not too heavy like they usually are.  I think probably the best chinese in town is the Sesame Inn with a few locations, but this place is fine.  What I am really impressed with is the Sushi.  I had lunch there today and was impressed with the servie and the chef.  The service was really good... maybe a little too much attention, but better that than the alternative.  The Chef seemed to be a trained sushi chef.  I'm guessing he learned his trade in Asia.  I had some excellent quality white tuna, which was delicious.  I also had the spicy scallop with avocado sushi.  It was really nice with great texture with the creaminess of the avocado and sushi and the crunchiness of something else (not sure  what).  I also had the crabmeat sushi, which was pretty good quality.  The rice had good flavor and the right amount of stickiness.  The sushi was wrapped perfectly.  The chef was helpful and very nice.  I would have preferred authentic wasabi instead of the pasty type stuff you get everywhere, but again that's pretty standard.  I didn't try any of the rolls.  I don't typically eat rolls, because they usually are pretty heavy and one of the reasons I eat sushi is to offset my typical gluttony.  However, the selection seemed really good and I was told by another customer at the sushi bar that the TAI PEI 101 Roll was great.  It should be with a $24 pricetag for a roll.  The ingredients are 7 oz. of lobster, eel, asparagus, onion, cucumber, and seaweed salad.  If this place were in the city I would probably just give it 3 stars, but the fact that it's in the burb's and has this good quality justifies the 4 stars.

Now we know. The service was impeccable, and we thought the restaurant was spotlessly clean. The food was spot on - from the shumai (tastes like it's made from scratch) to the Taipei Special Dumplings (which have a tasty thin exterior and a rich, savory pork filling), we enjoyed our appetizers very much.\n\nThe main dishes were equally as nice - we had the crispy shrimp and broccoli (lightly battered crispy shrimp and a great sweet chili garlic sauce) and at our waiter's suggestion, the basil rice noodles with chicken. I must say that the basil rice noodle dish was the best of the day; flavorful thin chicken slices with fresh basil tossed in with the delicious noodles and a little bit of sauce. The dish just works... Like other Chinese restaurants, the portions are large, and we probably should have only ordered one entree for the two of us after enjoying the two appetizers. Food was served at the correct temperature, too, which is something I always look for. (I hate it when food is too hot or too cold when it is served!)\n\nThere is room for improvement with regards to the actual menu - it's too big, and has too many items on too many pages, making it a bit difficult to make up ones' mind, but this is hardly unique to Taipei, and I would say 99% of Chinese restaurants have this problem...\n\nPrices are reasonable, and overall, it was a nice Saturday lunch experience.\n\nWill definitely be back.", "business_id": "dwz55gqPZwSBD74yFFb27g", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-04-13", "type": "review"}

I always try never to be seated in the booths to the left of the buffet as you walk in as there is just too much employee foot traffic to negotiate.  Don't get me wrong, I like attentive service, but it was frustrating trying to get out of the booths and to the bar having to dodge the roving waitresses constantly up and down the aisle and, if not moving, firmly planting themselves in the aisle right where access from the buffet and booths are.  There was also little effort to move so customers could freely move about.\n\nAs far as the food, nothing exceptional stood out to me.  The \"house special\" chicken was alright once removing the skin which had a rubbery consistency.  The grilled shrimp were flavorless with no seasoning or grilled flavor making hot sauce or salt a necessity.\n\nOther dishes were as expected with temperature being reasonable for a buffet.  What brings me back are their BBQ chicken wings which really should be labeled as hot wings for those not knowing they have some kick.  Not like wings you'd find at wing restaurants like BWW and a little small, but, hey, you can get as many as you want!\n\nI ended my meal with some soft serve ice cream.  After circling the buffet a few times, I found my only options were to use a soup cup or have a cone as they had no dessert dishes.  Either they don't offer them or all were being washed.\n\nThe machine dispensed really fast, and all the cups were freshly washed (read this as still hot) so I luckily found a coffee saucer to put my cup under so I didn't drip all the way back to my seat.  Again, after nearly crawling over employees set up almost as obstacles to the customer, I had a few spoons of my now almost entirely melted serving in which I had little interest in trying to get another serving.\n\nChina Buffet is a little expensive for lunch even with a coupon.

Mahi Mahi.\n\nI went with the Cantonese Noodles and they were around a B/B+. I think they could have made the noodles much spicier and gone heavier on the seasonings. My friend ordered a General Tso's Tofu, which was delightfully crispy and sweet on the outside but perfectly soft on the inside. He also ordered the Teriyaki Chicken appetizer which was served satay-style on a skewer.

The egg rolls are great, well done like I like them. The won ton soup and hot and sour are standard fare, solid dishes overall. Crab Rangoons are quite good as well.  One of my favorites is the curry chicken, have him add vegetables for a real treat and get it with steamed rice to temper the heat. Not a huge fan of the fried rice here, a bit heavy on the soy. In the winter try an off menu favorite, chicken and vegetable soup. White meat chicken with standard vegetables, bok choy and bean sprouts in a won ton broth. Satisfying yet light. \n\nPortion sizes are good especially for lunch and prices are low especially this close to Midtown.

My wife and I had a little time to kill and stumbled upon Ho Ho Cherry House at lunchtime and decided to give it a go.  Table service was pretty good and the staff was all very nice.  The only thing I would say is that I would like it if they paid a little more attention to the timing and waited until we finished the appetizers before bringing the entree.\n\nWe had fried dumplings and BBQ spareribs to start.  The dumplings were delicious, plump, tender and flavorful with a dipping sauce that was better than the usual offerings.  Ribs were big and meaty with the normal amount of chewing and tearing required to eat a Chinese restaurant style rib.  Nice char but not enough sauce.\n\nFor our entree we shared the Szechuan shrimp and scallops.  It was hot, fresh and flavorful without being overpowering in any way.  The seafood was perfectly cooked, although I suspect that the scallops may not have been real as they seemed too perfectly round and all the exact same size with a strange texture, more like a plug of fish and not very scallop like.  Veggies were all very fresh, texture was perfect and the balance was just right. \n\nI do have a pet peeve regarding shrimp in a sauced dish such as this - Take the freaking tail off of the shrimp.  It is a hot, sauced, stir-fry and we had to take our fingers and pull the tail off of the shrimp before eating it.  I'm OK if it is a shrimp cocktail or jumbo fried shrimp that you can grab the tail as a \"handle\" and pick it up but, not in a piping hot slippery sauced stir-fry...please...it just makes things messy.\n\nThe decor is exactly like any other of this genre and it seemed pretty clean from what we could see. The free wi-fi is a nice touch too.\n\nWe will be back.", "business_id": "cibtubYc6gd8T6Y-nPPByw", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-03-20", "type": "review"}

Also, I am not sure why this place is rated 2 dollar signs, I'd say it is more like 1. Also one last tip, I learned that you can request lunch portion on pretty much ANYTHING on their menu, even the chef's special, so make sure you ask for it if you don't want as big of a portion, it'll save you a good $2 or so on each item. Lastly, try their beef chow fun, OMGGG, awesome. Not the best I've ever had but out of all the entrees I tried from this restaurant, they nailed the beef chow fun.

I went for a \"business lunch\" with my boss.  Who thought I would ever enjoy working more than eating??--I think this meal was a first!\n\nI got steamed veggies and brown rice.  Now I expected it to be pretty bland, since it mentioned no sauces added at all.  But the vegetables were rubbery, not crisp like they should be after a good steaming. The rice was pretty underdone as well, so all-in-all, they got nothing right.  I tried adding some sauces to liven it up a bit, but it was too little, too late.\n\nPerhaps the biggest disappointment was the egg drop soup.  I usually add pepper to mine because I like the extra kick, but this needed much more help than a little pepper.  It was very bland, and didn't taste like anything.  Tasteless egg in water is definitely NOT something you want to keep eating.  And, of course, there was no salt and pepper on the table, so I couldn't even enjoy it the way I like. \n\nBecause I didn't pay, I didn't complain to the waiter, but normally this would not have passed by me.

The view from the entrance allows you to view the kitchen, and it was bustling with food, and servers appeared to be quite busy moving the food out of the kitchen window.  We did witness a first hand accident which occurred at the kitchen doorway, which resulted in a loss of a few meals and dishes......I guess someone else in the restaurant was also on an adventure. I would refer to this as a detour or unscheduled event.\n\nAfter approximately five minutes we were seated in the far left of the restaurant, just a few tables over from a party of thirteen.  This is where the adventure begins.......I will have a few rules of visiting restaurants at the end of this review.....\n\nWe were approached by our server, whom I will name \"K\", she was very helpful at first, but that is where it ended.  On this occasion we had the Kung Pao Chicken and the Chicken Lo Mein, our drinks were sweet tea, and water.  Let me re-phrase that, our drinks were suppose to be sweet tea and water. Water, check, Sweet tea - negative Ghostrider.  This tea was un-sweet and there were no sweeteners in sight.  After a few minutes \"K\" returned, we requested a few sweeteners, and this sufficed.\n\nOur meal came out in a timely fashion, approx 15-20 minutes.  The portion sizes were nice, just enough for possibly two people to share, or if you are like me, the size was just right for a good hearty meal.  I enjoyed the Kung Pao, it was fresh, hot in temperature, just a few scallions, just enough red hot chili peppers, and the chicken had a nice crisp yet gentle taste.  I would consider this a very good meal and for the food,  I give it 4 stars.  My wife's meal was also very good, the noodles were cooked very nicely, and if there were any complaints it was that the chicken was lacking in the lo mein.....again, the food for her meal 4 stars.\n\nNow the reason for the 2 star review.  The service.  Have you ever met someone and felt, \"Gee I really want to like this person, I want them to do very well, I want them to succeed, I want them to just do what it is that they do best\", but in this case, I was neglected, my wife was neglected and to make matters worse, the table of thirteen near us, was receiving all of her attention.  I drink water at my meals, I drink ALOT of water, at this meal, I had ONE glass of water, no refills, no follow ups, and this water was empty well into the meal.\n\nI had to leave the last of my meal, because I did not have any water to wash down the white rice, which as one knows can be bland, if there is no water to help wash it down.\n\nSo here are the rules that should always be followed. ( I broke a few)\n1. If the restaurant is empty and you have to wait more than 5 minutes to be seated, leave.....leave quickly. (this is NOT a good sign)\n2. If you witness an accident involving 2 or more employees which result in dropped meals and drinks, resulting in broken dishes. Leave, leave quickly, that could be your meal next on the floor.  (this is not a good sign)\n3. If you are seated right next to a big party and your server is attending to them, you are delightfully screwed in your needs and this is truly not a good sign. ASK for a different server and section....\n4. If you can't motion your server over due to the fact that they are so focused on others, and you are unable to view them due to your poor seating arrangement. ( I may want to consider wearing a clown shirt)\n5. If your server apologizes to you AFTER the meal, then it may be just a little to late to receive a good tip. This is what I refer to as your OMG moment that you were dreading..... it's called ....the bad dining experience.\n\nSo to break this down:\n\nThe Pros: \n1 Good Food, (reasonably priced)\n2 Nice atmosphere, \n3. Beautiful statues of horses, \n4. Swinging door entrance, and \n5. Good location.\n\nThe Cons: \n1. Waiting for an empty table in an relatively empty restaurant. \n2. Mirrors reflected smudge marks on every mirror located in our dining area. \n3. Service, \n4. Service, \n5. And Service\n\nSo,  to sum up the dining experience it would have been a very strong 4 stars, but the service brought that down to a very strong 2 Stars. I will be back, but I will be assured that I will be in a different section, and insist on a different server.\n\n NCFoodGuy", "business_id": "4CPrhBc4Ado90fj7PG6jrA", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-05-22", "type": "review"}

I've been here once before and had take out one other time and always found it decent food but forgettable and therefore  have forgotten to review up until now. I was told the lettuce wraps were good here so we decided to stop in!\n\nChicken Lettuce Wraps 4/5 stars - these were yummy and I could have made a meal out of it alone!!\n\nSpring Rolls 2/5 stars - ehh they were only okay not a lot of taste going on here except for the heaviness of the lemon grass. The sauce to go with it was just yucky. I do feel spoiled by another restaurant which I love who has amazing spring rolls so I can't help but compare.\n\nMongolian Beef 4/5 stars - I didn't order this but tried it and I really liked it!! I definitely liked it better than the beef that was on my dish!!\n\nThai beef and noodle salad  3/5 stars - I honestly am not sure how to review this one. The taste was pretty good and they allowed me to take out the cucumber and add bean sprouts and I took out the mango. However there were no noodles in my salad?? Maybe I misread something but last time I checked it was supposed to have noodles in it. I didn't feel like waiting around for them to make a new one and they were busy and it was already getting late as we'd waited awhile. The beef was good but kind of dry and not as good as the mongolian beef. Overall I liked it enough that I will order it again to at least taste it the way it's supposed to be.\n\nSo averaging out it gets a little over 3 stars. I'm not sure I really want to round up on this one but since the Spring Rolls really drag it down and they were such a small part of the meal I will round up.\n\nOh the staff was super nice and did a rather good job considering how busy it was for a Tuesday night...

The wait time quote was an hour 20 minutes. They sat us in an hour 45 minutes - not bad! I expected to wait 2 hours so technically they were early! So far so good. Until we got to our table. They had no high chairs so we had to wait. Luckily a guy (I think he was another waiter, not ours) hunted one down for us right away. Our waiter took our drink order and I ordered food for our 20 month old with our drinks. I asked for the toddler food right away. He came back with our drinks and we ordered 2 appetizers and 3 entr\u00e9es - my husband told the waiter he could bring it all together. He said the appetizers and kids meal would be out shortly. I told him I really wanted the babies noodles right away. 20 minutes later our appetizers came out but no kids meal! The waiter avoided eye contact and came back a few minutes later with the kids meal. This is where I should say I worked in the service industry for over 10 years. I understand busy, I understand the kitchen getting 'under water' but the kitchen at this location should have been closed down until they caught up. Shortly after our baby meal (which now our stubborn toddler was overtired and hungry but refused to eat) arrived our waiter brought us an extra appetizer while we wait for the entrees. It wasn't anything we wanted but it was Mother's Day and I didn't want to be nasty, so I didn't say anything. I actually felt a little bad for our waiter, he was not in the 'swamped' zone and he needed to be. Our meal didn't arrive to our table until 1 1/2 hours after ordering. I kept bringing the 20 month old outside to walk around. I think at some point my husband talked to the manager. When our food arrived he stopped by our table for ONE second and said oh good the food arrived. Everybody's happy now. Wait! What?? I am not happy. The 20 month old is NOT happy. And he's hungry! And that's it? So our waiter had another 'extra' dish for us. Some beef something which we again didn't want but Mother's Day not wanting to be nasty in front of my toddler and in laws so I just ate my food and let my husband deal with getting boxes and paying etc. I don't know if he left a tip or not - it wasn't entirely the waiters fault. I heard the waiter at the table next to ours apologize to those customers and tell them they would get dessert. He handled the situation better - tip for our waiter: avoidance is not good customer service. I have worked on nights similar to this one ( to my Garden friends think Black Thursday) and I am proud how our whole restaurant handled it. I'm embarrassed for this PF Chang's and hope you take an opportunity to debrief what went well (the high chair hunter) and what went wrong (from the hostesses to the kitchen and especially the management) and figure out how to make it better. Moral - DO NOT go to this location in any traditionally busy holiday! Lesson learned!", "business_id": "4CPrhBc4Ado90fj7PG6jrA", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-05-10", "type": "review"}

My husband and I were regulars at their sister restaurant, JoJo's, for almost ten years and we were devastated when they closed. We missed the food, the atmosphere and the familiar faces. So we decided to give Baoding a try on the off-chance it might be some sort of substitution. To me, JoJo's was the best Chinese food in Charlotte with impeccable service and a relaxing atmosphere so it has big shoes to fill.\n\nWe walked in and immediately the ambiance grabbed me. It was dim but not dark and the lighting and d\u00e9cor were eclectic and sort of mellow. There is a big mural on the wall behind the bar that looked really neat and we recognized the same over the table light fixtures that were at JoJo's. Look, a piece of home! Our server was quick to bring our drinks - I had a glass of wine and the hubs had some cold sake. We took our time with the menu because it was unfamiliar and organized differently than the one at JoJo's. I was sad that they didn't have egg drop soup. (JoJo's used to not have egg drop soup but then eventually added it. Maybe Baoding will as well.) Instead of a soup, I got a spring roll, which was very good. Hubs got a spring roll and the hot and sour soup, his usual favorite, which he enjoyed. It was just as good as JoJo's, although a different color and slightly different ratio of ingredients. \n\nFor our main courses, I got the moo shu chicken (my JoJo's favorite) and he got sesame chicken, his overall Chinese favorite. The moo shu was presented differently than it was at JoJo's (there you build your own with the tortillas served separately, here they were served already wrapped up) but it was every bit as good. The flavors and textures were basically the same so I was pretty happy. Hubs really loved his sesame chicken, saying it was just as good as what he was used to. \n\nWe saw only one familiar face from JoJo's but he was happy to see us and presented us with a free dessert for being JoJo's regulars, which made us so happy. We used to get free desserts and such a lot at JoJo's so it was so nice to a. be recognized and b. be treated as regulars in a new place. I can't emphasize enough how grateful I was for this gesture. (Also the chocolate cake he brought us was to die for. It tasted like a gooey brownie. Yum.)\n\nThe food, service and ambiance were all something that I look forward to experiencing again. We had such a lovely dinner and enjoyed it immensely. We'll likely become regulars here and get our Chinese fix at Baoding for the foreseeable future.

I'm not sure if you can order off the menu or not.  Frankly, I don't think that I would.  Since the Great Wall doesn't typically do a buffet, but instead puts a variety of their typical dishes out on a jury-rigged affair, it's like getting a family-style selection of meals, rather than your normal Chinese buffet.\n\nWhile you don't have the selection of some buffets, where you'll have three, four or even five buffet lines to choose from, the food is overall much fresher, and the experience much better.  The problem, such as it is, is that if they were busier, the lines would be difficult to navigate.  As it is, the process wasn't a problem at all.\n\nThe bar had two soups, half a dozen different meats, a couple of rices (one white, one brown), lo mein, some vegetable options and a dessert.  Decent selection, and the food itself was certainly the star.  Where some buffets will be too heavy on the sauce, so that it can survive hours on the warming tray, the food here was almost like a large portion that you'd get had your table ordered it yourself.\n\nThus, you were able to really enjoy.

I think we had a different server every time someone stopped by. The Crab Rangoons were simply not Crab Rangoons. There was no cream cheese flavor whatsoever. I am not sure what they were, but not what I was expecting. The Shrimp Fried Rice tasted ok but the Shrimps were full of poo. Not deveined and completely packed with poo. Just disgusting. Wonton soup flavor was good but the actual wontons must have had a teaspoon of ginger in them. Strong and not really what I was expecting in a wonton...Whole dinner sucked.

The waitstaff has always been attentive and professional, and the wait time for food is reasonably short. The restaurant itself and the bathrooms are clean and spacious. The ambiance is relaxed and pleasant, and noise levels are comfortably low.\n\nBut none of these things can save the mediocre-to-bad food. That is, if you get your food at all. On more than one occasion, they have forgotten to include entire entrees or side dishes when I've picked up take-out. I now double-check all of my orders before leaving. The egg rolls taste like they came out of a box in the freezer. They are greasy and heavy, with very little flavor until you douse them in sweet-and-sour sauce that's so sweet it might as well be syrup. The same problems plague the entirely unremarkable crab rangoon. I've had the hot and sour soup, and disliked the taste quite a bit. Not spicy enough, and far too sour. I usually order the ginger beef stir-fry. There's hardly any ginger flavor, and the sauce is thick and also fairly sweet. If they halved the amount of sugar in everything, it would be a good start. I've had more success with the sizzling black pepper beef, which has a punch of black pepper and a good balance of meat and vegetables. On a recent trip, a friend got the beef lo mein. It had a nice quantity of beef, but an anemic quantity of vegetables. It was also very greasy and watery, and tasted extremely bland. The only reason I go here as often as I do is that my grandmother (the poster child for stereotypical Wisconsin taste buds, bless her heart) loves the three delicacies sizzling rice.\n\nI did discover one saving grace: if you dump sriracha on the food, it blends very well with the food and elevates all of the flavors. Too bad they don't have any of it at the restaurant, it could save many a dish. Bottom line: there's much better, more authentic, more balanced, and less heavy Chinese food available in Madison at comparable prices.

Waited a full 2 hours for our food. So if you have don't mind waiting an unbelievable amount of time for food and have all day to waste, then read on. . .\n\nFor years I have drove by the Imperial Garden and referred to it as the \"Chinese Restaurant Gas Station\". I don't even know if they are connected or what, but you see them both as you turn the corner. We decided to go to this place for Mother's Day and check it out. Talking to friends over the weekend, we were told it was pretty good.\n\nThe building is nice and the atmosphere of the restaurant was way nicer than I expected. Very large and nicely decorated. Not so cheesy like a lot of Chinese-American places in Wisconsin. The hostess greeted us very nicely and having reservations we were seated right away. \n\nNow - we were a larger than average group - table of 8 - but they clearly were set up for groups this big as they had large tables in the corner of the rooms with a spinning lazy susan in the middle that was perfect for us. I think we probably could have even gotten 9 or 10 people on this table. The waitress was very nice too. Came right away and got us drinks and very friendly.\n\nThis is when things went down hill. We did order appetizers, which came out right away. Pot Stickers - both steamed and fried - which were pretty good. Once our whole group arrived we all ordered regular items from their menu. Then we waited. Waited and waited and waited. Apparently so did everyone around us. For hours - over two to be exact. The waitress did her best - kept coming by and telling us she was sorry, that the Kitchen was crazy and that we were next. Honestly we should have left - but it was hard enough getting family members from 4 households together at one time. \n\nEventually the food came out. To their credit, I thought everything tasted pretty good. I got two different shrimp dishes. Decent flavor, cooked perfectly - the snap peas and water chestnuts were good. Portion was decent on the Shrimp dinner and much larger on the chicken dinners that others in my group got. I agree with other reviews - its not the most adventurous food. Flavors were safe and my spicy shrimp wasn't very spicy at all. My sister-in-law was upset her Sesame Chicken with Broccoli came with one piece of broccoli. She complained and the waitress brought out a side of broccoli.\n\nOverall, If the food wasn't pretty good - I would have given this place one star. I give our waitress credit for holding it together too. She offered free desert but we were about an hour late for getting to another place so had to go. Saddest thing is we heard that this has been an ongoing problem with the Kitchen. Sounds like they don't fire dishes in the order they come in and they have a lot of trouble keeping up with things. If they could correct this problem and add a bit more flavor into a few dishes, the place really could be ok.\n\nTry it on your own risk - but I would plan on spending several long hours while you wait for your food.", "business_id": "SKLw05kEIlZcpTD5pqma8Q", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-05-12", "type": "review"}

Hubs and I used to live at the Chin's on State St.  LIVED there our entire undergrad years due to our hole in the wall efficiency apt. being directly across the street from Chin's, and the fact that they served healthy, fresh, fast food with rice.  This was probably the only place doing that back then.  The chicken and veggie teriyaki was always my default, as the Szechuan chicken was for hubs -  mine was chock full with crisp pea pods, carrots, red and green cabbage, scallion, and light teriyaki sauce.  We also loved the Thai peanut lo mein.  We were always happy it was actually spicy and the sauce used to coat the noodles was just genuinely good.  \n\nWe moved to Milwaukee after our rendezvous with the campus life and during our first weeks getting to know the city we saw there was a Chin's on Oakland Ave and got excited.  Yet eating there was like an entirely different experience.  The food was horrible!! The noodles were overcooked, the peanut sauce used in the peanut lo mein was like an entirely different recipe - the Szechuan was not spiced well at all and my teriyaki no longer had the delicate flavor and the crisp vegetables I so appreciated.  We tried again just to make sure, and it was the same story.  We had conversations walking out of there questioning if Chin's changed it's recipes.  A couple months later they closed down. I think a Five Guys now takes it's place on Oakland.  \n\nNot long afterward the State St. location went the same way.  Some karaoke spot stands there now and in my bitterness at seeing Chin's go I've refused to check out what they have to offer in it's place.  \n\nFast forward five years and somehow we'd found ourselves back on campus for varying reasons, with an ache for Chin's as soon as we touched foot on good ol' State.  Finding out there was still a Chin's in Madison was a spectacular find for us.  Having eaten at this location in Middleton now multiple times in the past couple years I can safely say I remain a fan.  \n\nPeople here have a lot of complaints and I'm feeling quite protective.  This is my spot! This place is not \"gross,\" it's not dirty, the service has always been absolutely fine, and I'm not reducing stars for them being who they are: NOT AUTHENTIC!  \n\nI appreciate Chin's as I appreciate Noodles N' Company and Chipotle.

(I have eaten in China , both at home and at restaurants, and \"authentic\"  Chinese food,  with it's use of familiar spices  in overwhelmingly unfamiliar ways,  probably isn't really what you want!) \n\nAnd so Chang Jiang succeeds in giving us what we want.   I'm not a gourmet, but I know what I like, and the food is very tasty.  \n\nThe reason I only give the Restaurant four stars instead of five is that their designation of what is hot and what is not, is way off.  As in, it isn't really hot.  At home when we cook, we always make a separate less spicy plate for my step-son vs. what my wife and I eat.  But he enjoys everything designated as hot at Chang Jiang, with no problem.    \n\nWe always get the Kung Pao Shrimp,  and then our other order varies, sometimes Hunan Shrimp, or Garlic Shrimp.

The tofu is always perfectly crispy, the dishes (especially the chow fun) are excellent and the drink menu is fun and creative.\nSo why 3 stars?\nSimply, this place has developed a really bad attitude. Fate is like that friend in middle school who suddenly decided she was \"too cool\" for you, and started moving away from  you at the lunch table and then sabotaging your cheer leading routines.\n\nLast time we came here, the bar next door to it had just opened -- so we made some allowances for slowness -- but STILL. We made reservations and still had to wait an hour. That's ridiculous. Then we had just purchased expensive drinks and were not allowed to bring them to the restaurant. No apologies, nothing.\nThat particular night, after an hour, we were still table-less and  about to leave, as we had seen plenty of couples who were apparently *friends* with the waitstaff (and who had come much later than we had) get seated, while we waited... and waited.. .and waited... Finally, the owner of the restaurant saw us complaining, recognized my husband's friend, and found us seating.\n\nNow, a few days ago, we called to make reservations and dared to ask if they had something earlier than 9:30. What did we get? A snappy, smart ass response.\n\nNo thanks, Fate. There are plenty of other places opening up downtown and we'll start to take our business there.

Several folks asked that their food be prepared mild.  When the food came, every dish on the table was nuclear hot.  I can handle hot food, but this was on par with Los Dos Molinos.  When we mentioned this to our server, she told us that it all has to do with the peppers they have on hand at any given time.  She patiently explained that the heat levels of the peppers vary (Duh!), but the chef always uses the same amount of pepper and never tastes the food.  Therefore, the heat level varies wildly and there is no consistency.  Frankly, any chef who doesn't taste their food needs to get out of the kitchen and into another line of work.\n\nThe concept of the menu with the various preparations and the choice of proteins is great.

It is unlike any pad thai I have ever eaten.  Ever.  The sauce was soupy.  The noodles were not pad thai noodles.

She'd been talking about Hot & Sour soup and hasn't found any in PHX she likes except one place in the far away land of Chandler (compared to West PHX). \n\nHOneslty, she seemed a little disappointed in the food. Hot & Sour soup (from the Chinese menu, not the Thai H&S) was sour, but not hot. She had me try, and I'm no hot & sour judge, but it had some funky (read: not good) taste to it. They brought a wonton and egg roll with her #7 Thai combo (can't remember what it was called). Both were overfried. She mentioned it's like it was fried then refried. HOWEVER, the insides of the egg roll were quite tasty. Wonton- not so much. Corn soup came with my #1 Pad Thai lunch special...it was broth with corn. Very simple. I suppose I expected a little more but it was exactly what they said, corn soup. I should have gotten a salad. \n\nMoving on to the actual lunch. Pad Thai, I've never had much Thai food and I enjoyed this quite a bit. Now I can't compare this to anything else so it's just my taste buds talking.

My mother says she craved Chinese food the whole time she was pregnant with me and by proxy got me hooked on Chinese in the womb. I bless her for having done so. I love Chinese and could eat it every day...willingly.  I've tried Chinese in every city and country I've ever lived or visited, as I always love to see what's out there and experience the regional variances and interpretations. I can usually find something good, no matter how nasty or base a buffet, or made-to-order.  And Lord knows I love take-out and a movie on the sofa.  Great nite, rite?\n\nA few weeks ago I convinced the better half to go pick up Gourmet House of Hong Kong, if I paid and he drove. Deal. Done.  I ordered on the phone - no problems. It's rite down the street from our house, so dinner was steaming hot and in the living room within 20 minutes.  We queued up the DVD and we're ready to go.\n\nThe fried rice was yummy and OK.  Not the best I've had but not the worst either.  The BBQ pork app was good and I liked the dipping sauce it came with. Everything else was skank.  I'd say avoid the noodles at all costs. They were like nasty over-cooked spaghetti in a watery, flavorless sauce.  Even with soy sauce added, they did nothing for me.  \n\nI'm kind of sad b/c the other reviews on Yelp seemed pretty good.  The place is not that great looking from the outside, and never having been inside, I can't comment on that -- but I would never get take-out from here again.  At least we didn't get sick.  It was just bland-o-rama, which makes me sad.  I even threw-out the leftovers, which has only ever happened  one other time with Chinese take-out, when I left for vacation the next day and didn't want to stink up the fridge.", "business_id": "ykfTh6HI219NoMsWBxulxw", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-03-01", "type": "review"}

Michael and his lovely wife are no longer involved, but the new owners retained the same cooks.  The food has always been very good, and little was lost in the transition.  \n\nWe once tried the typical Americanized dishes (sweet and sour pork, lemon chicken, etc.) and weren't too impressed.  We don't order that style of food anymore.  \n\nWe never go for lunch.  We like the dinner menu, and prefer to eat \"family style\", with the various dishes on a lazy susan in the middle of the round tables.  \n\nLots of Asian families are eating there, especially on weekends, so you know the place is going to have good, authentic Hong Kong style food.\n\nWe tend to order these dishes most often:\n\nHot and Sour Soup \nGreen Pepper Beef w/ Black Bean Sauce (over crispy chow mein noodles)\nHunan Beef\nKung Pao Chicken or Shrimp\nMu Shu Pork\n\nThe Hot and Sour Soup is always good, and at times it is excellent.  We do see some variation in flavor, but we always start our meal with it.  Even on an \"off day\" it is still good.  You hit the Hot and Sour Soup JACKPOT when it has that perfect balance of heat (from black pepper) and dark vinegar, along with the meats and veggies.  I tend to discern Chinese restaurants by their Hot and Sour Soup, and this version rarely disappoints.\n\nThe Green Pepper Beef w/ Black Bean Sauce (over crispy chow mein noodles) is so good!  I could eat it every day for a month and not get tired of it.  If you like black beans in your Chinese food, you'll love this dish.\n\nThe Hunan Beef is a dish I don't find anywhere else.  It is what I think is their \"take\" on twice-cooked beef.  It is strips of tenderized beef, cut thin, that has been dredged in cornstarch and deep fried.  Then they stir-fry it with a dark, pungent, spicy sauce that has both sweetness and a sour tang.  It is strongly flavored, and quite satisfying.\n\nThe Kung Pao is standard, but very good.  Hot.  Pungent.  Exactly as it should be.\n\nThe Mu Shu Pork is excellent, and, as other reviewers have indicated, the pancakes are spread with plum sauce and filled at your table by the server.  They use a spoon and a set of chopsticks quite adroitly, so they never touch the food with their hands.  Very fun.  \n\nThose are our favorites.  We've been going to Gourmet House of Hong Kong since the early 90's, and it is still one of our favorite places to eat.", "business_id": "ykfTh6HI219NoMsWBxulxw", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-03-25", "type": "review"}

I should first say that I'm from an area that's saturated with Chinese restaurants, so I have pretty high standards for Chinese food. Lao Ching Hing fell far short of those standards. \n\nAt first glance, it seemed like a pretty nice restaurant. They invested a lot in very nice traditional-looking furniture, which I don't see often. So I enjoyed the overall atmosphere of the place. We were the only patrons when we went, so I can't really complain of bad service since we were the only ones being served.\n\nWe ordered the stir-fried string beans (my all-time favorite dish) and the salt and pepper pork. They were both so bad :( The string beans were under-seasoned and not really cooked the way it should have been cooked. In that particular dish, the beans should have been dried. It seems like they sort of skipped that step or didn't complete that step. So instead of nice crunchy beans, we got squeaky beans. The pork chops were worse though. I'm thinking it was at least a day old - you could taste the old oil - and they probably just re-heated it (we definitely heard a microwave go off). And that old oil taste stayed in my mouth long after dinner was over. Not pleasant.\n\nI think Panda Express has better-quality food than this place.

The service was conducted half in English and half in Chinese, which is typical when our mixed race party shows up at a Chinese restaurant.  I sampled the lemon shrimp my father ordered.  The sauce was a bit too sugary, like lemon drops, and the shrimp itself had such a thick, hard shell of batter that it was hard to taste the shrimp.  No drinks were suggested; we were left with only the water that was refilled every 5 minutes.  When we boxed up some leftovers, they did not give us the rice to take home, which makes me wary that it is being re-used.  A child was with us, and there was no kid's menu, which was a bit of a disappointment.  The food overall tasted alright, but I have definitely had better (and better service too!)

Without that, I won't give a restaurant 5 stars; however, the food here was terrific. I'm always looking for new Chinese food restaurants and I'm super stoked I found this one as it's .5 miles from my work. I got lunch to go, ordered the lemon chicken and crab puffs. The chicken was delicious, the rice (I got fried) wasn't too greasy and it came with a salad, your choice of soup, and egg roll. The salad surprised me, but it was pretty mediocre. I got the egg drop soup and while the portion was not as large as other places, they made up for it in quality. They are generous with the eggs and with the veggies that are in there. I love that they don't use green onions too (HATE green onions). The portion sizes are consistent with lunch-sized portions; pretty much what you'd expect. The crab puffs are absolutely delicious. I hate when I get crab puffs somewhere and they don't have crab or the cream cheese is cold OR they put too many onions in them. This place has them down perfectly; not too oniony and the perfect crispiness.

The dishes we ordered were pretty bland (all needed a generous amount of soy sauce). The one thing I did enjoy were the pot-stickers and the yummy dipping sauce. I ended up pouring that pure yummyness all over my main entree. To tell you the truth, I was hesitant on trying this place again until I took a peek at some reviews and found people had lots of good things to say about the place.\n\nSo i gave it another shot. The atmosphere in this place is like sitting in large asian shoe box, it's one big dining room, yet it's not off-putting. It's strangely welcoming. You feel like your family with everyone else eating there. I went on a Saturday night and I was surprised to see so many old people. I'm all \"this place has to be good if the older crowd is here\". The  psychedelic plastic lighting fixtures cycling through all the colors of the rainbow makes me laugh but I love it. The service is quick and attentive, however when we tried to order a Mountain Dew and Dr. Pepper, the small asian woman had no idea what we were talking about and blurted out something I could not make out. I heard \"Coke\" in the jumble of words and just said \"yes\". They work as a team there which makes for some speedy service. We ordered a few appetizers: Pot-Stickers and Crab  Puffs. The Pot Stickers were good but the Crab Puffs were not. The inside lacked any crab at all and had a runny constancy that quite frankly, surprised me. Eww. Avoid these. I remember reading a review from Alexander C. suggesting the Orange Chicken. What a great choice! The dish made up for the runny crab puffs. The meat was top notch; moist with no grizzly chunks like a lot of places have. The sauce was bursting with flavor and had just the right amount of heat to it. I highly recommend this dish.\n\nChina Chili...glad I gave it another shot :)", "business_id": "-3WVw1TNQbPBzaKCaQQ1AQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-05-19", "type": "review"}

While that dish is tasty, this place has so much more to offer.  Venture away from the lure of the Orange Chicken tractor beam and try such tasty morsels as:\n\nBoiled Won Tons -- a standout dish; the spicy peanut sauce is more like broth than sauce, but in a good way\nChicken Corn Chowder -- a reliable standby\nHoney Walnut Prawns -- deep-fried shrimp enrobed in mayonnaise with honey walnuts; what's not to love?\nLover's Prawns -- half the prawns are in wine sauce and the other half are in spicy chili garlic sauce; very balanced\nPillow Chicken -- along the lines of deep-fried chicken croquettes with savory Black Pepper Sauce\nSichuan Style String Beans (with pork) -- a fantastically spicy dish\n\nThe lunch menu includes a number of their most popular dishes (including Orange Chicken, of course) that are very tasty and wallet-friendly as they include a cup of the daily soup and an egg roll.\n\nThis restaurant is run by a large extended family and the place has a very convivial atmosphere.  The people watching here is great.  The customers represent a broad range of Phoenix residents and there are usually a few gay peeps in the house, which is always a bonus.  \n\nThe decor at China Chili really improved when they moved from Central Avenue due to the Light Rail.  This place doesn't have the decor of C-Fu Gourmet, but it is pleasant enough.  The enlarged dining room can now accommodate a crowd, which has really cut down from the long waits at their previous location that was so much smaller. \n\nBesides table service and take out, China Chili also caters.  The BF and I recently used them for our Tacky Tiki Gay Pride Brunch.  Johnny handles the catering and he's great to work with.  We asked Johnny to create an appetizer buffet, which was something China Chili had not done before.  They did a great job building a custom menu for us and the food was great.  I highly recommend their catering; it's a great way to feed a crowd on a moderate budget.", "business_id": "-3WVw1TNQbPBzaKCaQQ1AQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-05-28", "type": "review"}

Every time I have been here, it is the exact same thing.  The service is quick and attentive, the food is fantastic and brought out freakishly fast, and the meal is always fairly cheap.  Funny thing is, I used to be afraid of this place because of the name.  The husband always wanted to try it, but I said it sounded creepy.  As a side note, I am not a fan of spicy foods.  I have since come to realize I really like Asian spicy, I do not like Mexican spicy.  So I'm a food racist.\n\nOur first time here we ordered the orange chicken and the lemon chicken.  The orange chicken was nice and crispy, with the chicken being super juicy.  The orange sauce was amazing.  It was subtly spicy at first, and then the heat just built up from there.  We still order this every time.  The lemon chicken is nice.  A light sauce that doesn't overpower the chicken.  Another good bet.\n\nSince then we have tried many other dishes, the Almond Cashew Chicken, Sweet and Sour Chicken, Moo Shu Pork, and the Honey Walnut Prawns.  Holy Crap!  You have never tasted how good prawns can be until you eat the Honey Walnut Prawns.  The lovely little crustaceans are served on a bed of shredded cabbage.  They are smothered in a sweet and tangy mayo sauce (I know it sounds kind of gross, but trust me and try it).  Then sprinkled all over the top are this wickedly good honey glazed walnuts.

I walked in and everybody knew me, and immediatley started to make my meal (they would double or triple it, if I had company).  My favorite dish, was called Singapore Rice Noodle.... obviously a rice noodle dish that included stir fried spare ribs, chicken, shrimp, green and yellow onions tossed with a non-spicy curry sauce.\n\nWhen they closed, I was in a state of depression for nearly two years!!  Until last night, when I happened upon China Chili, not my first visit, but my first SIT DOWN experience with the restuarant.  I do what I have done at every chinese restaurant since Silver Dragon... I opened the menu and went directly to the noodle dishes to see if they offered \"Singapore Rice Noodle\".  Much to the delight of my stomach, they did and it was EXACTLY the same as I remember it at Silver Dragon.\n\nI am already conspiring to have it again today for lunch!!!!

I saw this mentioned in an earlier review and the name made my eyebrows go up.  \n\nAll the good reviews and the 2 minute distance from work made me give the place a try.  Glad I did.\n\nFirst time in, I got the Pillow Chicken and the Boiled Won Tons.  Wow.  It has been quite some time since I've sat down to a meal and said 'wow'.  The Pillow Chicken was a new experience for me.  Stuff (chicken, onions, and some other good stuff) is breaded and fried in little 'pillows', then smothered in this black-pepper sauce.  The smell was one of the best experiences my nose has ever had.  And the taste was as good as the smell.  Garlicy and peppery and yummyery.  I've never had anything quite like that dish.  I will order it again to see if my awesome opinion of it is just tastebud shock.\nThe Boiled Won Tons came like a soup.  I think its just that there is a LOT of sauce, and its subtle enough to be a broth.  Don't know.  All I know is that it was delicious.  Its spicy, but...easy.  That's the word for it.  You feel like a stud for eating so much spicy liquid, but its not going to burn your behind-hole on the way out.  (I know that was in poor taste, oh well)\n\nThese two delicious dishes had me wanting more.  so I went back that same week.  This time, I got the Lemon Chicken after the menu told me it was a 'must try'.  \n\n...For Lemon Chicken lovers, yeah it is.  But if you're not that into it in the first place, their offering will not turn you into a fan.  That just isn't my kind of dish.  No complaints, however.\nThe lunch special did come with a soup, though.  I have no clue what the name of it was, but it didn't agree with my taste buds.  No fault of the soup.  Its just not for me.  For what it was, it was fresh, well made, and hot.  Someone out there probably loves it.\n\nMy rating states \"Yay!  I'm a fan.\"  I am.  I will be going back again and again trying different dishes.  You don't do that a place that you don't trust your taste buds to.  I just need to stick to things that sound good to me...like BBQ Pork Slices and anything with Prawns in it.\n\nThe place itself is nice.  Short on front parking, so go in the back and be careful driving down that narrow alley.  The inside of China Chili is nice and open with plenty chairs and tables...I think there were booths...can't remember.  Its accommodating for large parties...which is what you see mostly at lunch time.  Clean place, too.\n\nThe staff were quick to the draw as most have said in their reviews.  While waiting for my food, I watched them wait tables.  Fast.  On point.  However, I can see how some folks would be annoyed.  Its a matter of preference.  Just keep in mind that the staff mean no harm.\n\nSpeaking of speed, I got my order in under 10 minutes.  That is consistent with what you all have said.  No cold food.  No re-heated food.  None of the issues that could arise with such turnaround time.  Just good hot food served quick.  \n\nI'm so desperate for some good chinese food.  I'm completely Panda Express'd out.  This is right down the street from work and the prices are well...decent.  With tax you're talking like $9 for a lunch special.  Apparently, that's a good price for this part of town.\n\nI just can't get over that Pillow Chicken.

It tasted...well, pedestrian.  Don't get me wrong, It was not nasty at all.  \nI suppose compared to Pillow Chicken, this dish seems like its from a different restaurant altogether. Perhaps I should have cut my teeth on something a little less flamboyant than the Pillow Chicken when I first went here, because each dish I've tried after that has left me disappointed.  \n\nHowever, keep in mind that I've been ordering off of the lunch special menu lately, and those dishes are usually a little less spectacular on anyone's menu.  But I guess that's no excuse, as anything you serve to your customers should be prepared to the utmost.  \n\nAnyway, today's dish, House Special Chicken...  Its described as battered chicken in a spicy garlic sauce.  Its battered and spicy, but not very garlicy.  Still its decent.  A good taste, just not a very eventful taste.  Of note is how tender and delicious the chicken was.  I felt like taking it and putting in a sandwich.\n\nAgain, the soup of the day was the one that I cannot eat.  Don't know what this stuff is...but I guess somebody on this planet must like it.\n\nOh well, I can either hold this place in high regards related to the lone dinner entree I've tried and downgrade it for the few lackluster dishes I've had afterwards...or I can give them a break since most 'lunch combos' are only good enough to fill stomachs at the office and not to wow the tastebuds.  \n\nMeh.

She works in the area and suggested we go to dinner here. \n\nI was extremely pleased with our meal.  We started with Egg Rolls, Pot Stickers and Boiled Won Tons.  The egg rolls were crispy and flavorful, the pot stickers were plump and the filling was delish, but the star for me was the boiled won tons.  I have never had anything like them, They were packed full of meat and served in this savory peanut flavored broth. My sister-in-law was a little wary of trying one, but she did and concurred that they were quite good.  She is not the most adventurous eater so that is really saying something!\n\nFor our main courses we  shared Mongolian Beef, Peking Shrimp, Salt and Pepper Shrimp, and Sichuan Beef.  The Mongolian Beef was tender and seasoned perfectly, The Peking Shrimp had a spicy red sauce the had a little tang to is and was served with snow peas (nice and crunchy not over cooked) and onions.  The salt and pepper shrimp were fried with a nice light batter that was salty but not over done and the jalapeno peppers were just right.  The Sichuan  Beef was my least favorite, I thought the sauce made the batter a little soggy but I really liked that sauce so was still a good dish.\n\nThe portions are huge, I was full after the appetizers as were my dinner companions, so we took a lot of our dinner home, and it tasted great the next day.  Our waitress was very sweet and attentive.  I especially appreciated that she boxed up our leftovers instead of just dropping off some boxes at the table.\n\nFrom the outside the restaurant doesn't really look like much, a sand colored stucco building, but inside it is furnished and decorated nicely, the tables are spaced  so that you don't feel crowded and the lighting was bright but not overly so.\n\nMy only complaint would be that their tofu dishes had meat in them so there weren't as many vegetarian options as I would have like to have seen.  I didn't get a chance to ask if they can adjust them for vegetarians, but will the next time I go and before I take any of my veggie buddies there.", "business_id": "-3WVw1TNQbPBzaKCaQQ1AQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-04-02", "type": "review"}

It's really quite good, certainly the best Chinese I've had since I left San Francisco. \n\nD\u00e9cor usually isn't an important part of the experience for me but China Chili is quite attractive inside, it looks small from the outside but was quite spacious inside. Despite being one very large room it was possible to have a quiet conversation. The lighting is quite relaxing without being dim,  and the d\u00e9cor traditional Chinese.\n\nWe had Hot & Sour soup, and were asked if we wanted it spicy; we did; it was. Really quite excellent, among the best Hot & Sour I've had. Very rich and full, I was surprised at the shrimp and chicken, which were perfect in texture and taste; the veggies were just the right crispness, the broth was spicy but not too hot, and all in all I really recommend this soup; my companion said it was his favorite part of the meal. He's from rural North Carolina and had never had it before, nor much Chinese. As for me, I'd come back for more.\n\nNext up the Kung Pao Chicken was little disappointing, in that it had too little chicken, too much okra. But it's a minor point, the flavor was delicate and pleasant, the mix of other vegetables offset the okra and what chicken there was, was nice. Unfortunately it was not very spicy, especially after the soup, and so if you order it I suggest you ask for it to be extra spicy. But still a pretty decent dish.\n\nMy personal favorite of the meal was the Prawns in Lobster Sauce with black beans. Perhaps a little salty but the flavors overall were delicate, the prawns large, tender, and juicy and no hint of greasiness.\n\nLast we had house special fried rice which was excellent, very fluffy and well seasoned, with beef, chicken, scallops and shrimp. Quite gingery which I like. \n\nAll in all, while it's not up with the very best Chinese cuisine in San Francisco, the food and service were more than acceptable, prompt, unobtrusive, helpful and the price very reasonable, $40 for four dishes and sodas including tax; and the portions were more than generous, we took home more food than we ate (by intention). The Soup alone could have been half the meal...\n\nIf you're in Phoenix and you want Chinese, you couldn't go far wrong by choosing China Chile.", "business_id": "-3WVw1TNQbPBzaKCaQQ1AQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-04-06", "type": "review"}

I would definitely come back here for lunch as the price you pay for the amount of food that you get and the quality is great. The only negatives was the service (the waiters stood around not too far from our table looking extremely bored) and the chicken corn chowder soup, which was bland and left a lot to be desired.

The dining room is just a big open room and lots of white linens so it's very bright. The food came in a flash and was delish. The shrimps were huge and the batter was almost perfect, slightly mushy, but I liked it. I always ask for extra sauce to mix with the rice and it was a good amount. I'm kind of a stickler about rice, growing up in a half Japanese household. The rice was the best so far although still kind of dry but I can imagine because it's made in copious amounts. I asked the server for a box because I had about 6 shrimp I couldn't finish. The server brought the box  and offered to pack the food for me :). I declined nicely because it was only a couple shrimp.I asked for the check accidentally assuming he would have brought that too. After ten minutes I think he might have forgot, trying to make eye contact with other servers was difficult as they seemed uber focused on other things or not really wanting to help a solo eater such as myself haha. Eventually I got my bill and due to the tasty food and maybe for them to pay attention to people like me in the future I tipped well and left with a happy tummy. :) I will be back.", "business_id": "-3WVw1TNQbPBzaKCaQQ1AQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-05-02", "type": "review"}

While I was not blown away, I'll probably order from them again and explore the non-chicken menu items for the reasons below.\n\nWe've gotten take-out from here twice.  I've tried several items (sharing with friends), including sesame chicken, orange chicken, the \"house\" chicken, crab rangoon, and fried rice.  The chicken dishes at this place differ from what you may be used to for Chinese takeout, and the result may be a mixed bag depending on your personal preferences:  typically much less breading and more actual meat (a good thing, right??).  In the dishes I tried, the chicken was prepared the same:  lightly breaded dry white meat served in thin strips.  Unfortunately, the dishes universally had less flavor than what I've typically enjoyed at other places.  In particular, the \"house chicken\", lacked flavor.  It was basically a bunch of lightly breaded, dry, white-meat chicken with a thin/unsatisfying sauce.  Seemed pretty mono-demensional.  The other chicken dishes suffered for many of the same reasons.\n\nThey do the fried rice well with a generous portion of shrimp included.  However, combo dishes are served with white rice only and they will not substitute for fried.  So if you want fried rice, you must pay full price for your combo meal and the additional order of fried rice (around 7-8 bucks for a portion of fried rice).  You end up with a lot of extra white rice, which they will gladly not give you, but won't discount.", "business_id": "-3WVw1TNQbPBzaKCaQQ1AQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-05-11", "type": "review"}

By far.  Oregano's, Buffalo Wild Wings, none of them compare with the greasy, spicy, juicy perfection of Long Wong's wings.  And they've got great prices.  My family of 4 will frequently order the bucket of 72 wings, for only $32.52.  For those of you who are curious, that's only 45 cents a wing!  Every day of the week!  We love the Hot and Honey Hot in particular, but all are delicious.  Although, the BBQ and Garlic Parmesan are a little too sauce-y for me.\n\nSome others have criticized the service; I've never had a problem.  That being said, they do seem to have a limited staff.  Every time I've gone the same man and woman have been managing the restaurant.  It does get crowded around dinner time and there isn't really a clear system of lines for those who are picking up and those who are ordering.  Also, when they're busy you may not be able to call ahead.  Superbowl Sunday the phones were constantly busy so I ended up having to go in and order there, then wait.  But overall I've found the service to be just fine and the staff to be pleasant.\n\nNot a place for a romantic dinner, but if you wanna see how comfortable you really are with your SO, take them here and watch each other stuff your faces with wing-goodness.

The medium buffalo wing sauce was hot but had no flavor.  I also had a hot dog.  The bun was super stale and fell apart as I tried to eat the hot dog.  \n\nThe Costco style tables were filthy.

I love their hot wings.  I recently spent 5 months on bed rest in Good Sam Hospital (a very rough pregnancy) and my husband would have to go get me Long Wong's Hot Wings just to satisfy my intense craving for them.   \n\nWhat I like best about them is that they are well cooked so they aren't fatty, with big fat deposits in the chicken skin itself.  Nothing is grosser to me than biting into a chicken wing and getting a big mouthful of greasy, fatty flabby chicken skin.  YUCK.   Long Wong's wings are deep fried and come out meaty and chewy and little bit crispy.  Delicious!  Kinda like the perfectly browned skin on the Thanksgiving turkey, but covered in delicious hot wing sauce.  Someone once complained that they were similar to chicken jerky and I think that was a compliment!  The way they are cooked you can appreciate the meat and crispy skin and the sauce and you don't have to muck through a heavy breading or flabby, fatty chicken skin.  \n\nTheir $5 cheese pizza isn't bad either.  And for some odd reason their fountain Pepsi is somehow more yummy than most fountain dispensed Pepsi at other restaurants.  I don't know if they can adjust the mixture and in this case they are running a stronger Pepsi mixture?  All I know is it's better than most places.\n\nGood cheap food.

My parents were divorced, so my dad pretty much always took me out to dinner on his nights. Long Wong's was a solid part of the rotation, and not just because I only ate cheeseburgers. The place is crazy looking. Literally, the decor looks like it was inspired by an acid trip. Nothing says \"kid friendly\" like a hippopotamus trash can. If you are a single dad who doesn't know how to cook, you should definitely take your kid here for dinner. \n\nSince it had been at least two decades since I'd been inside a Long Wong's, last night my boyfriend and I decided to check it out. We had a craving for wings (I accidentally typed that I had a crazing for wings, which I'm pretty sure is the exact same thing)  and you can get a bucket of 50 for, like, $25. Going to be honest ... 50 wings might have been a bit overkill for two people. Still, it was worth it. \n\nWe did a split order: 1/2 honey hot and 1/2 medium. The honey hot wings are where it's at. My only complaint is that I like them to be a little crispier. Some of them were slightly soggy. The fries didn't travel well either. In fact, everything was just kind of soggy by the time we got home. The wings were still very good, but I think they will be even better once I give the leftovers a little crisp in the oven. I will say, their homemade ranch was delicious. Can't beat a hot wing dipped into good, homemade ranch. \n\nI'm definitely going to have to keep this place in mind the next time a wing craving hits ... and maybe ask for them extra crispy.", "business_id": "BT2Vls7h6sWrCKa5gGXbKg", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-03-11", "type": "review"}

Long Wongs has always been a favorite place for me to eat. My love for long wongs started as a kid. I would get excited when I knew I was going to get some of their wings. This excitement continues even to this day.\n\nTheir is just something about their wings. The sauce is great and instead of baking the wings, they deep-fry them.  Making them that much better, with a crisp out side and a juicy inside. \nAnd this Long Wongs did not let me down. And officers many new flavors of wings. All just as good.\n\nToday I had the Inferno, parmesan and teriyaki wings. All had been wonderful. My wife like the teriyaki the best. Me, I loved the inferno. They have many other items on their menu however,  I have never had anything, but their wings. So I can not give my opinions on the other items. \n\nThe service I received from the staff here is hit or miss. This is still a fast food joint, so this tends to be expected. People with good customer skills get hired on for more money at other places. While people with bad customer skills tend to get fired so you're always getting new people. So your quality of service is random. \n\nWith all that said, I do find that the person's who are behind decorating this place must be some kind of Hoarders. The outside looks like a juck yeard for things the circus has thrown out. While inside looks like a horder ran out of space at home to keep his, or her junk and just started storing it atbthis Long Wongs. \n\nIt is primarily because of this reason,  why I can't give five stars to a place with the best wings. Eating at a junkyard just is not very appealing at all. \n\nPros: Great wings with lots of choices. \n\nCons: service quality is random and I feel like I am eating at a junk yeard.", "business_id": "BT2Vls7h6sWrCKa5gGXbKg", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-03-15", "type": "review"}

Made hubby travel quite a distance to try this well reviewed restaurant.  \nHere's the scoop:\nThey charge 1.50 for the noodles that every other restaurant routinely puts on the table.  They charge 1.50 for brown rice per person.  \nOrdered the PHO (a vietnamese soup) which is on the menu although it is a chinese restaurant. The soup which consisted of noodles, chicken and broth was accompanied by very, very fresh basil, cilantro, jalape\u00f1os, bean sprouts and lime.  Ample and fresh.  The soup broth, although it was chicken PHO, had a fishy backdrop taste.  Can't explain it but it was there.  Hubby gave it a 7 on a scale of 1 to 10.\n\nOrdered the Walnut shrimp which was fried so much so that the batter had totally adhered to the shrimp. The crust outside the shrimp was much too thick.  The sauce was nothing more than mayonnaise.  The General Chicken which we had asked for extra spicy was not spicy at all.  When we told the waiter about it, he brought over some \"spicy oil\" to add to the dish to make it spicy.  Who wants to add oil to your food to make it spicy? Why not add chilies to the food while it is being saut\u00e9ed as other restaurants do?  When the orders came out, the server only brought out one brown rice and that we should share it until we  get another one later.  The order of brown rice was small enough to fit in the palm of my small hand and the rice was as hard as a rock.  My culinary savvy told me that the rice had been overly microwaved and that's why it harden so much so that it was inedible. Don't restaurants keep rice in rice cookers to keep it warm??? We showed the waiter to which he said he would bring another rice, but by then we had already finished eating.  I also told him  that I hoped that he wasn't charging us  for that rice.

I thought the shrimp in my dish were exceptionally tasty compared to many places that have little tasteless shrimp.  The scallops were good, and there were plenty of vegetables in a light sauce.  My wife commented on her dish that the ginger was in larger pieces, packing more of a flavor punch.  The rice was perfectly cooked and flavorful.\n\nThe servers were very attentive and cheerful, removing plates when done and refilling water as necessary.\n\nI have been here a couple times before and have always been happy with the service and the food.  I would also recommend any moo shu dish: the pancakes practically melt in your mouth and the sauce is delicious.", "business_id": "m9Wqqma30o-hH2fAX7dnug", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-04-27", "type": "review"}

We were feeling in a Chinese kind of mood, so we thought: what the heck?\n\nI've never been to this place before, but I've passed it several times. I was excited to try something new and review another place.\n\nAs soon as we pulled into the parking lot, I noticed that there were a lot of people parked out front. I took that as a good sign.\n\nWe walked in to the restaurant and I was surprised at how nice it looked inside! I've been to several Chinese restaurants where inside has pink wall paper, and an assortment of Chinese-type figures all over, and out-dated look, with a huge fish tank in the \"wait-to-be-seated\" area. No, this one was pretty snazzy! Another plus. \n\nWe sit down and our waitress was very nice. She was very cordial, not too chatty. We ordered the honey dipped barbeque chicken and the cream cheese wontons for the appetizer. The chicken thing was good, but there was hardly any cream cheese in the wonton. It was almost just fried dough. \n\nWe ordered our entrees. Sweet and sour pork, chicken and another chicken plate. I thought that it would have come with rice (the menu said it did) but only the plate of egg rice came out (which we ordered). \n\nThe price was reasonable. Not too expensive. It was very filling too. The place was okay. It was better than a lot of other Chinese food places out there, but at the same time it was kind of the same.

While a few better places have similar wraps to Pei Wei and PF Chang's, I'll give these two chains credit for having the best. We jokingly said before ordering our meal that we should just have gone with two orders of the wraps. Ironically enough, we were right. We also Order Chicken Lo Mein. When I took the first taste, I was shocked to taste pretty much nothing. When my girlfriend took a bite, she realized it was sauceless. She then asked one of the \"servers\" (I don't know a better term for guy who brings food you ordered from counter to table and cleans off plates but didn't take your order) for some. We tossed it into the noodles and it made a big difference, but it still was a rather plain and boring version of a popular Chinese dish.", "business_id": "9Vu9KhK2-kBSM-FXvxXGNg", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-05-02", "type": "review"}

Im vegetarian and They leave much to be desirered for a vegetarian. Yes you can get your meal made with veggies and no meat, but thats it. Theirs really no plates made especially for vegetarians. In their defense i will say the veggies are always crispy and not over cooked.  The down side is they dont give you many vegetables. Its such a small portion of vegetables You'll go away hungry. and if you ask for extra veggies they charge a dollar and some times the increased portion is really just the normal portion. pei wei is a  ok as a good go to stand bye restaurant. i  only wish they had more choices for vegetarians and gave better portions especially when it comes to vegetables. I also dont understand why they dont have Indian food or tiebetan food or Kashmir food. Its Called  an Asian Fusion restaurtant and They dont include India, Tiebet, Kashmir  as Asian food.

I've always loved the lettuce wraps, but the last two times I've ordered it, the lettuce I've been given has been the very inside of a head of lettuce-that nobody eats. You know, the small, yellow, wrinkly parts. It was impossible to make a wrap out of it, so I had to throw it in a bowl and make a salad. Which defeats the whole purpose of a lettuce wrap? My last order was Pad Thai, and the broccoli was limp and the florettes were yellow. Like the broccoli was old and should've just been thrown out. I've only had take out, so I can't comment too much on the service. One time when picking up my takeout, I watched a young gentleman with longer hair checking people out. I noticed he kept running his hands through his hair constantly. Which my first thought was, unsanitary! You work in a restaurant. But then figured it was okay since he was only handling money.

We ordered the bitter melon stir-fried with 3 kinds of diced eggs (salted duck eggs, preserved eggs and regular eggs).  The hints of bitterness nicely balanced the creaminess of the preserved eggs and savoriness of the salted eggs.\n\nThe weather was cold so we wanted a braised dish served in a hotpot.  We ordered the mixed veg with dried shrimp and vermicelli (aka mung bean thread) in hotpot.  What came instead of the vermicelli was black moss and the addition of tofu, which was not mentioned.  We didn't mind because we really liked the dish esp the black moss which is a more expensive and rare ingredient.  The flavors were spot on, well-balanced and very comforting.\n\nI'm guessing that food from the Chinese menu is so rarely ordered that the kitchen confused what I ordered with another vegetarian dish on that menu.

This was incredibly greasy, and the flavors were drowned out by the oil. I had the appetizer platter as a meal (shared with my companion), preceded by \"hot-and-sour\" soup, which was neither. The \"spring rolls\" were what I call egg rolls and the filling was greasy - it was as if they were fried at too low a temperature, allowing the oil to be absorbed into the food before it finished cooking. The paper-wrapped (well, foil-wrapped) chicken was of a strange consistency - it was almost fluffy, like ground meat bound with egg and poached. The crab puffs were oily and their filling was a sticky paste, albeit flavorful. The tempura shrimp (when did tempura become Chinese?) were oil-soaked, like the spring rolls. The beef ribs were very gristly, and the beef skewers were OK - probably the best item on there. My fellow diner had the orange chicken, which had good flavor, but the consistency of the orange-peel bits in the dish was really hard - I chewed some for the flavor but decided I didn't care to swallow them, any more than I would deliberately swallow olive pits. Only white rice was offered with the orange chicken. We stuck to water and hot tea to drink, and the tea was good - plus it helped cut the oil and get the greasy taste out of my mouth. The service was fine, it was a Tuesday evening and not too busy; the cost was fair for the amount, if not the quality, of the food. I am a big fan of chow fun, and several other reviewers mentioned that theirs is good, so I might go back to try that, but since it has taken me six years to get there this first time (since I moved back to Phoenix) it may take a while.", "business_id": "F3SEkW6v2LJ5y6Ldo5pPaw", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-05-19", "type": "review"}

I informed her that I was not happy with the way the meat was cooked, and she said, \"Hmm\" and walked away.

After seeing the establishment for years, I finally decided to try it after reading the reviews.  I ordered the orange chicken, the Flamingo special chicken, the BBQ pork fried rice, and the fried wontons.  The Flamingo special chicken was an over-fried slice and diced chicken breast, so dry that it was almost like a greasy beef jerky.  The onion and garlic sauce served on the side tasted like a burnt soy sauce.  I had to soak the chicken in the sauce for 20 minutes to make it somewhat edible, but burnt beef jerky was not what I was hungry for.  The fried rice was ok, with nice pieces of traditional chinese BBQ pork.  The only problem was that it stuck together so much that the rice was more like a giant rice cake than fried rice.  I seems as thought the rice was pre-cooked way too long.  The fried wontons were your typical fried sheets of wonton wrapper with a sweet and sour sauce that tasted too much like ketchup.  The orange chicken was decent, with the sauce being very flavorful.  The chicken chunks were a good size, and of all the items, this was the most appetizing.  It was nice that the dishes came with white meat, and I was not charged additional for white meat like some other chinese restaurants in the area.", "business_id": "aozcOaCMwOHG8s-lbZ6_gA", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-04-11", "type": "review"}

They gladly substituted chicken for pork, and as other people have noted, their chicken is the good stuff.  Also, they are very generous with shrimp, meat, etc.\n\nPeople in my group actually ordered alcoholic drinks from their ample drink menu, which I've never really noticed before.  I'm not much of a drinker.  But everyone really enjoyed the plum wine.  It was pretty cool that they have some different things to offer than a lot of other Chinese restaurants.\n\nFor example, try the house Flamingo chicken.  It is so good.

It was probably best that we stuck with water after sitting outside for 6 hours, so we really didn't think much of it.\n\nHeather ordered the Pad Thai, and I got the House Special Chicken. I wished now that I would have asked if the chicken was large chunks or thin pieces (it's large chunks) because I would have enjoyed it more if I was thin. The sauce, though, was really quite good. Our meal came with Egg Drop Soup. I'm not normally a fan, but I really liked their soup. There were mushrooms and tofu, a new addition to the soup for me, and the broth was thinner, which I also liked. \n\nI opted for steamed rice instead of fried, and the steamed rice was not that great. I wonder now if it was not so fresh. It didn't stick together and soak up the sauce the way I love rice to do at Chinese restaurants. Rather, it was more like home-cooked Minute rice. \n\nI was way too full to even think about eating the egg roll that came with my meal. They gave us quite a bit of food for a $6 lunch special.\n\nI'm so rarely in the area, that I doubt I'll venture out just to go to Bamboo House again, but if I am ever in the vicinity and want Chinese, I'll remember again!", "business_id": "zTfBa__ldlTdbVgSl5h31Q", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-03-08", "type": "review"}

Other people think so too, as it is normally very busy, although the place is big with ample seating, so there is generally no waiting.\n\nThe egg drop soup is delicious. They will make it Vegetarian if requested (water base instead of meat broth). We just love that soup!\n\nThey also serve hot tea (Oolong?) to everyone, which is another big plus in our book.\n\nThe main courses are good, I enjoy the orange flavored tofu and some of their other veggie dishes as well. My girlfriend has tried some of the meat dishes and was happy with them. Dishes come served with either steamed or fried rice (which might be a dollar extra).\n\nWe really like this place and would recommend that you check it out.", "business_id": "zTfBa__ldlTdbVgSl5h31Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-04-27", "type": "review"}

Very good consistent food at an amazing value. The owner Sam is there most of the time and takes good care of his diners most of whom are neighborhood regulars. We get take out from here every week and have tried most of what is on menu at least once. If you are unsure what to order definitely consider the various family  dinner options and come hungry. Easy parking, full bar, simple neighborhood place with emphasis on food not d\u00e9cor.", "business_id": "zTfBa__ldlTdbVgSl5h31Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-04-27", "type": "review"}

Loved the drink menu, specialty cocktails for only $4.50--I had a Scorpion.  \n\nThe food was good, hot and fast.  I had Happy Family and there was lots of shrimp, scallops and other meats.  Hubby had garlic beef, LOTS of garlic and almost too spcity for our delicate palates--you just had to keep eating it.\n\nThey look like that have good lunch specials that even extend to Saturday.

I don't go here often for two reasons... Their lunch is SUPER cheap and I am never home for lunch. And, their food is very salty. I like their food plenty, but dude tone down the sodium! The soups are tasty and the house chicken is good. I keep going back because it is in the neighborhood and it is cheap. \n\nSo, in conclusion, if you are looking for a cheap chinese lunch this is the place. Just realize, it is just a cheap chinese lunch, not fine dining.", "business_id": "zTfBa__ldlTdbVgSl5h31Q", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-05-02", "type": "review"}

All the makings of a \"neighborhood\" staple without the corporate feel. We brought some out of town relatives here and were pleasantly surprised by the massive menu with seemingly endless choices of all different varieties and styles of Chinese food. K and I were both surprised that when we ordered \"spicy as you make it\" they actually accommodated us but with real skill. Not the just dumping spices into a dish and over-powering the meal, but actually cooking the spices into the meal so that it had plenty of heat but still the taste the recipe calls for. Only thing preventing 5 stars is the menu was so large that we haven't had enough time to give it a good sample. I can say that all 5 of our guests loved the food, the price was very reasonable, and the staff friendly. A sure hit and we will definitely be back.", "business_id": "zTfBa__ldlTdbVgSl5h31Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-05-19", "type": "review"}
