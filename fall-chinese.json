There were very few people in the restaurant.  The two of us were seated in the largest corner booth and left to review our menus.  When our waitress finally arrived we ordered the following items:\n\nCoca Cola\nIced Tea\nPan fried pork dumplings\nSesame chicken lunch with white rice and egg drop soup\nChangs chicken with white rice\n\nOur drinks and my soup came out immediately.  Unfortunately I was brought the wrong soup and the server had disappeared before I had a chance to say anything.  I could see her across the barren wasteland that was the dining room and we even made eye contact several times, but at no point could I get her to come back to my table.  I tried the soup and was disgusted with it and placed it at the end of the table.  I didn't know what it was and didn't want to know.  Almost ten minutes later she arrived quite happy with the job she was doing and asked how the food was.  I asked if she could bring out some egg drop soup. I didn't expect to get the stink-eye.\n\nMy egg drop soup was brought out with the dumplings as well as the caddy of different sauces and oils.  The server really wasn't that into the experience, but again gave me the stink-eye when I told her that mixing the sauces was unnecessary since I knew what each of them was and would be able to mix them myself.  I mixed the rice vinegar, chili oil, chili paste, and soy sauce (my guess is that it was supposed to be tamari) to create a dipping sauce for our dumplings. I took a bite of the soup and it was somewhat better than the other soup, but it was still brown.  I ate half the bowl and left the rest for the server.  It was thick and gooey and the flavor didn't wow.  I saw no reason to continue.  I moved on to the dumplings, which had an okay flavor to them.  The skins were a bit thick and doughy.  The meat on the inside did not balance this attribute at all.  The sauce tasted a little odd so I tried to remix and it was still off.  I tried the components individually and found that some of them were either old, stale, or rancid.  We finished our dumplings.\n\nOur lunch entrees arrived.  I had ordered mine extra-spicy, but I guess it came Pittsburgh Hot (super mild) and had a lackluster flavor at best.  The meat was tough and the sauce tasted of soy sauce more than anything else.  I tried some of Chang's chicken and was equally mollified.  This was supposed to be their version of General Tso's Chicken.  Now I have never had a General's chicken that was the same at any place.  It is always different.  Many of them are good in different ways.  This food, though, it wasn't good.  Chang's chicken fell into the same category as the Sesame Chicken -- since it tasted mainly of soy sauce -- with the addition sugar.  \n\nI just don't understand how anyone can like this place.  Even the Yoshida Sauce you get at Sam's/Costco tastes better.", "business_id": "JDDeaNfb0JXD1NbznSIC9g", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-11-30", "type": "review"}

Things turned around for me once I got a car (or made friends with cars), but I was seriously hurting for a while.\n\nTasty was one of the places we found. Back in the day, it was owned and ran by a typical restaurant-owning Chinese family.

If they were in NYC, they'd only be missing an ami.... a bus boy.

The food isn't as good as it was, but the restaurant still gives off the home-style look and feel. It's a small restaurant with enough seating for about 25-30 patrons.

It wasn't spicy like I requested, but the chicken was still crispy after having to drive it home and the sauce was very savory. \n\nOverall I probably will crave the food from here and will be back, on a night when I do not mind driving to pick up.", "business_id": "Y2p07YEC8xOsYTHWf0UxiA", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-11-09", "type": "review"}

I've heard mixed reviews so I wanted to try it for myself. I tried to peruse the menu before ordering but I couldn't find it online anywhere which is disappointing because the hard copy they have available had at least 300 different options from apps, combos, sides, and entrees. \n\nI got their General Tso's Chicken (extra spicy) and because my order was a take-out over $12, they threw in two free egg rolls. #win \n\n(Other offers are Free 1 Small Fried Rice w/purchase of $16, Free General Tso's or Sesame Chicken w/purchase over $28)  \n\nI called on my way there and it took about 10-15 .... When I walked in, everything was ready to go. Large portion of chicken was served in plastic and rice was in standard paper folder container. They were not stingy about duck sauce, soy sauce, and fortune cookies. #win #win\n\nJust like the reviews below, the General Tso's was just so-so. It definitely wasn't extra spicy but it did have a mild kick to it. To me, the sauce tasted a bit like wing sauce from a dive bar. I would get it again because it was good but it didn't have an oriental flavor to it. When ordering from a strip mall Chinese food place, I always expect each piece of General Tso's to be a quarter chicken and the rest fatty breading to which I dissect and just eat the meat.  My expectations were met but I wasn't disappointed because the chicken was good. \nThe meal had a decent amount of broccoli in it which was cooked perfectly for my taste, a little firmer. \n\nThe egg rolls were OK. Super crispy and not much filling...plenty of oil. They were free and so I can't really complain.  \n\nI will definitely eat here again. I'll probably try Sha Cha chicken because it's spicier or Kung Po. This place is good if you want cheap food that will hit a Chinese take-out craving. \n\nEveryone that worked there was really nice - Even the chef in the back said hello.

No \"Thank you, have a nice day\" or ANYTHING. I looked in the bag, no fortune cookie, not even a utensil to eat with. I asked for it and she again acted as if I was asking for too much {whatever}. I get back to my location to grub and find little to NO BEEF in my beef fried rice. I literally counted 7 tiny small and THIN pieces {not even full strips}.

This was obviously done to show off for us but trust me when I say that we were not buying her act. Anyway, after the show off left and let us enjoy our meal, it was perfect. I will definitely be back very soon and will think about upping the review to 5 stars if none of the staff tries to impress us so hard.", "business_id": "hbFCv2Rginf9zjai-lKUNg", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-09-21", "type": "review"}

The beef was battered, which isn't my preference, but was really good with citrus peels in the sauce and great level of spice and flavor.  \n\nOne thing we just haven't gotten used to in Pittsburgh (and maybe it's an East Coast thing??) is that restaurants here tend to mash up all the \"Asian\" cuisines together and you have Chinese/Thai/Sushi (Japanese) places that just don't quite get the sometimes subtle and sometimes obvious differences.  Didn't we learn from the great Inspector Clouseau to never trust Japanese waiters bearing fortune cookies?  Ok, I digress.  Anyway, we've been burned with the combo places before but this place ROCKED THE PAD THAI!  It was hands down the best, most authentic-tasting (yes, I have been to Thailand) dish I'd had in a while.  Shocked me at how good it was!\n\nSo we had to go again. The second visit we had a larger group and the food was not quite piping hot.  We also tried the amazing chicken (still not sure what it is exactly, but it's everywhere in Western PA), and everyone agreed that the Pad Thai was great.  I'll go back for that any time.

No meal is worth waiting that long for, and it is probably just as well that there would not be any tables available until well into the evening because it is not a pleasant place to eat.

She is pleasant and provided good and attentive service with regular plate-clearing and water refills.\n\nThe crispy noodles with which the meal begins are delicious, a great first course.  \n\nI ordered pork egg roll and pork lo mein.  The egg roll was not very good because it was not hot.  The lo mein was priced relatively high at $10.00, but it was worth it as it was ample and delicious.

But upon reading the recent negative reviews, I became nervous. They all had the common theme of: \"used to be great, went downhill, too expensive, try Jimmy Wan's.\" In spite of all that, I called ahead about 20 minutes prior to arrival on a Saturday night to get a table for 6, including two high chairs. We were seated promptly. The place wasn't packed but it was far from dead. Our drink orders were taken and fulfilled and refilled lickety split. We were somewhat indecisive about our entrees, but our appetizers got put in and brought out in a very well-timed fashion. \n\nBetween the four adults, we ordered two egg rolls, crab rangoon (6) and a vegetable roll. All were very good. The sushi was so good that we ordered another to share. In spite of ordering it last second, it still came out before our hot entrees, which were general tso's chicken and sesame beef. I rate both of these high. Chicken was crispy, not overly sweet or greasy with just a touch of spiciness. Sesame new was new to me but i had a bite and liked it\n\nPrices were $13-$17 for the entrees. Some of the chef's specials could get pricey, but there are big ticket items at every sit down restaurant. \n\nAs for the service, it was courteous, prompt and, best of all, patient when it came to wrangling our hyperactive baby. The server was conscientious about keeping plates and other implements away from our grabby baby and didn't give us dirty looks for the puffs that littered the floor beneath his high chair (note: we tried to pick up as many as we could before we left). I think at our somewhat unfocused pace, we ended up being there for over an hour and we never felt rushed. Nor did we need to flag anyone down for service.\n\nMy only regret is that I didn't try something more adventurous. On my way to the bathroom, I noticed a hot pot, some dumpling soup, some kind of dish that sizzled like crazy as they brought it out and some sort of sweet, sort of rice wine-y smell that made me wish I had taken advantage of their liquor license.I also got a good glimpse at their sushi bar, which looked quite nice with all of the fresh fish on display. \n\nAt any rate, I would most definitely come back here.

When I told the server how much I missed them since moving here from NY, she laughed and said the owners were from NY.  No wonder they are on the menu!

They are about $4 on the menu.\n\nBut it's the pineapple chicken dish I want to talk about.  When the server came out with my food, I found myself facing a HUGE plate of steaming, aromatic food.  Easily enough food for three people, I found myself wolfing down perfectly cooked rice, tasty bits of chicken, and huge pieces of pineapple.  Had I been going home after the meal I'd have had more than enough to cover BOTH lunch and dinner today.  Since I wasn't going straight home, I ate way more than I should have - but with a smile on my face the entire time.

Five minutes or so after walking in, I had a bag in my hand full of piping hot food and was walking back to the office. \n\nI have limited options - for health reasons - on what I can order, so I should not be the last word on the menu in any place. So I have mainly stuck to some of the healthier items like Sa Cha chicken or the steamer plates. Even though it's fast, it's always good.

Don't expect to be blown aware by culinary complexity or innovative dishes and presentations here. But, hey, they carry most of the westernized classics.\n\nUS CULTURE TIP ON THE USAGE OF THE TERM \"CHOW MEIN\":\nI learned from my experience here that there is a difference in the US between East and West coast conceptions of chow mein. On the West coast (where I was raised), chow mein refers to the steamed soft noodles and \"Hong Kong style\" refers to the crispy style fired noodles. However, here on the East coast, \"chow mein\" is assumed to be the crispy Hong Kong style, while \"lo mein\" refers to the soft steamed style. Who knew?\n\nAt Cherry House, however, chow mein seems to refer to a bunch of fried rectangular morsels of friedness. I think they are the ones that you find in soup sometimes. In any case, I was a little let down.\n\nThat said, in a fix it is a perfectly viable option. The lunch combinations are a fantastic option at $6-$8 for main dishes with fried rice and egg roll, spring roll, or crab rangoon. A filling lunch for two coming in at under $13?

HO. CHERRY. HOUSE. An inspiring entrepreneur selected for the name of his or her establishment, Ho Ho Cherry House. This is a real thing that is happening around us that we can all be a part of.

I also wasn't a huge fan of their egg-rolls - since I prefer mine with a little more flavor. \n\nI will give it another shot because I thought the chicken sauce was one of the best I've had in a long time.", "business_id": "G3EsKzy3i-CvrEDjZzTV0g", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-09-26", "type": "review"}

While there is very little you could term \"authentic cuisine\" here, I've got to vote with my taste buds and just admit I'm still a sucker for this place.  (Boos and hisses from the crowd.)\n\nI'm even a given for their often too-hyped appetizer- the chicken lettuce wraps (bonus for the vegetarian version too- equally good I've found).  Nobody does it this good- all the components are finely chopped and the cups of lettuce are perfectly shaped.  I even like the sauce they create for you table-side.  Start with ponzu sauce as a base, then add spicy mustard and chili sauce for some spice.  My one gripe on this app is that they never bring out enough lettuce cups.  Every table always needs a few more here.  Why not just bring them out to start with?\n\nThe main dishes are broken down by the type of meat you desire and these is (again) a nicer section for the vegetarians.  Almost everything you see is a take on a well-known American chinese dish- beef and broccoli, moo goo gai pan chicken, etc.  I just find that most, if not all, of these dishes are exceptionally well executed.  Score one for consistency.  I also find portions are big enough to share, and they generally have the price tag to match.  Luckily you also get a choice of brown or white rice, and they'll bring as much s you need.\n\nMy personal favorite is their kung pao chicken.  Sauteed with hot chili peppers and peanuts, the chicken is crispy without being breaded and has  nice touch of spice.  I also put the spicy sauce from the lettuce wraps on my rice- make it as spicy as you dare!\n\nCouple of notes of interest here- their iced tea is all now flavored- tropical breeze or some other fruity mix.  Not too bad but not too good either.  For something different, try one of their many hot teas- the dragon oolong is especially nice.  \n\nThey have also begun pushing these mini-dessert cups that cover most of the well-known desserts categories- red velvet cake, carrot cake, smores, etc.  These are about 3-4 bites big and they all come from the freezer.  I'm not a fan.  These still have a massive cake slice called the great wall of chocolate and, believe me, you will need a small army to surmount it.\n\nWatch out for crowds on the weekends.  Friday and Saturday night used to have a wait that could top an hour.  Most any other time, you should be able to walk right in without any wait whatsoever.  \n\nAs a big corporate chain, I should hate this place, but I just can't deny how good this place tastes.

We appreciate the gift to be able to try it, but we were thankful we didn't come for a full dinner to spend extra.

Sort of like how the movie Blue Lagoon is so awful it's loops around again and becomes enjoyable.\n\nBaoding is not bad. It doesn't make your heart race either. Prices are pretty spendy for what you get. We had soup for appetizers: Hot & Sour and Velvet Corn. Both were very ordinary but fine. For entrees we had Tangerine Beef, which could have been spicier. Also had Sauteed String Beans, which were nothing to write home about, just a big 'ole plate of beans.\n\nThe service is where they set themselves apart. We were seated immediately on a busy Friday night. The atmosphere is comfy and dark with lots of booths for some privacy. Drink and food orders were taken promptly and food arrived swiftly.\n\nWe had our normally darling toddler daughter with us who became An. Absolute. Nightmare. When she became too distracting to the other diners we asked for our food to be wrapped and the staff quickly got us sorted -- but not before our daughter smeared food on the wall mirror by our booth. Great, just great.\n\nHusband removed the kid from the premises as I tried to settle the bill and clean up the mess.

A garbled young voice picks up and says something not quite intelligible. I announce I want to place a take out order. He says HANG ON, followed by a clunk as the receiver is set on the counter. When he comes back, I place my order (Medium Hunan Shrimp, as listed on the menu, is repeated back as Small Hunan Shrimp). \nI ask if they make their Hunan Shrimp with broccoli. \n\"HANG ON\"\n*clunk*\n*background shouting: MA! DOES THE GARBLE GARBLE BROCCOLI GARBLE* \n*Mom shouting back*\n\nThe kid told me 10-15 minutes for pickup, and yes, it has broccoli. (Then he asks - you like broccoli?)\n\nThis is a family run place. \n\nTheir young son was designing a video(?) game in between taking orders on the phone when I arrived to pick up, and I saw what had transpired with me repeat in person: \n\n\"HANG ON\"\n*clunk*\n*kid runs around the counter to get something to write with*\nPresumably customer on phone asks question: \n\"HANG ON\"\n*clunk* \n*shouting: MA, WHAT DOES SMALL SESAME CHICKEN COST??*\n\nTo be honest it was all pretty charming. When he was done taking the order he wanted to tell me all about the game he was designing.\n\nMy food was ready pretty quickly. There was a little mixup where the mom thought I had ordered chicken (mom rolled her eyes at kid, kid insisted: \"I said SHRIIIIMPPPP\"), so she apologized and they remade it with haste.\n\nThe food: good! For the small/medium order, there is a *lot* of it. Plenty of fresh veggies - (chinese cabbage, broccoli, baby corn, carrots, onions), good flavor to the sauce (I might prefer a bit more spice-heat), 5 large shrimp and two big scoops of white rice. The egg drop soup was pretty standard, just broth and eggs, but not too salty, which is a pleasant change from some places. I can see sending Husband out to pick up a quart of the stuff next time I come down with a cold.\n\nPrices are slightly higher than what is listed on their website - probably just an outdated menu - but not enough to matter since everything is so cheap anyway. My meal - a TON of food that I could not finish - was just over $8 before tip, and next time I probably wouldn't get soup since I know just how much is in the regular \"small\" size order.\n\nAll in all, I'm really glad to have given China Jade a shot, and I'm sure I'll be coming back with frequency in the future.", "business_id": "RT-0cJb_8-WYhRuCfKxDjw", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-09-19", "type": "review"}

Singapore Rice Noodles with Shrimp & Chicken was the profile I expected and not something you can get at any Asian joint. The spice was particularly strong in a couple of spots and non-existant in others, so the sauce wasn't consistent. Wife's Hunan Chicken was General Tso's with a slightly sweeter sauce, and the Beef w/ Mixed Veg was what you'd expect.\n\nOnly bad part of the meal was Seafood Lo Mein.

I want to find the exception to the rule and find one that I like, but I am always disappointed & never suprised. \n\nSo, when I want to have good Chinese, I go to Wan Fu. I would have to say that it is most certainly my favorite Chinese restaurant in Charlotte. It has been here for about 22 years, and I think they have maintained the same consistency and quality from day 1.  Yes, it may be a little pricier than the typical little hole in the wall, but the portion size is big and the quality is excellent.\n\nAnd for recent transplants to Charlotte,  it may not be as good as the \"super-authentic-ethnic places\" that you can find in big cities with real Chinatown districts, but for this area, I think it offers the best quality and variety.   In any case, I can always find something here to make me happy.\n\nI love the traditional decor of the building - inside and out.  When you walk in it is a little dark, but I like the ambiance.  I have been here with small groups here as well as with large groups, and the service is equally good either way. They try to be very attentive,  making sure your order has been taken and that your glass is always filled and I appreciate their efforts. \n\nBut I think the key to why I really like this place so much is that every time I have eaten here, my food tastes as if they have used quality, fresh ingredients and that the food was cooked just right. (Chicken is light & sauteed to perfection - not overcooked and rubbery, and the veggies are not overcooked either.)  Over the many years that I have been going to Wan Fu,  I have never had a bad meal here. \n\nI am not a fan of fried rice in general, but once I had their pineapple fried rice with chicken - and it was pretty amazing.  It is nothing like that pathetic excuse for fried rice that you get served at cheaper Chinese places!  I love all of the typical stir fry dishes here - the Cashew Chicken,  Kung Pao Chicken, General Tao Chicken, Firecracker Shrimp, etc.  Of course, I normally go with brown rice and you can choose a chicken & shrimp spring roll or a veggie spring roll.\n\nI have been many times for take out too - with their easy drive up window, its a no-brainer!", "business_id": "i-tKO0n-1Tq6sTFUrhg9-Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-10-19", "type": "review"}

This Holiday season is not the easiest time to start a diet!\n\nThis was my first dine ever at Wan Fu.  If you are not looking for it you may never see it from Highway 51.  So if you do not know where it is, consult the map!\n\nHopefully all of my reviews were written keeping in mind where I am for example, Wan Fu is primarily Chinese, so my aim is to mostly compare it to other (probably none yet that I have reviewed) Chinese Restaurants at a similar price range or if it makes more sense I would compare Diners to Diners and Not Diners to Upper-end Steak and Seafood Fine Dinning!  I hope that my love for Vietnamese, Thai and Korean does not reflect a cuisine from a different culture. So this is a harder review to write and judge fairly.  Most Chinese Restaurants I will avoid and never give them a chance.  Most of the others I have been to and would not return just to write a bad review!\n\nHere was my dinner, comments and rating of each dish on this first visit:  Beef Appetizer good, not very good, just good 3.1 yelp stars.  Fresh Rolls, too much lettuce, still a good taste 3.2 stars.  Peanut Sauce, better than some (better than the ones that are primarily Hoison) though not to my liking 1.29 stars.  Plum Sauce, pretty good 3.5 stars.  The Entree:  Beef 3.2 stars, Sauce 3 stars, Vegetables: Asparagus and Red Peppers crunchy Fresh and perfectly cooked 5 stars.  Rice not rated!\n\nDesserts:  The other one (I took Photos though I do not know what it was called)  I'd call it a Bomb Chocolate Mousse with Chocolate and more Chocolate = good enough for 3.8 yelp stars.  The second Dessert was a Black Forest Cheesecake something special for Black Forest Cake 3.55 stars (better than the one I had in a German Restaurant - In another review I said I am a hypocrite, so there!) the menu photo looked good and I was running out of choices until I leave this place and get more dessert.  Wait staff should never comment on the volume of food I order and they did not here, though they tried to bring me the check after the Appetizers and before each dessert and I had already asked about dessert after I placed my entree order!\n\nThe Service was a great Team effort, everyone was pleasant, polite and all dishes were served hot and as ordered!  For the service they get 5 yelp stars!

You can't help to get excited when you see the oriental inspired architecture on the building.  The interior is accented well with decorations.  There is a small bar in the lobby if you want to get a drink while waiting for your table.  However, there is normally not much of a wait.  \n\nThe food is a little on the expensive side for a Chinese restaurant but it is worth it, in my opinion.  If you go there for lunch the food will be a little cheaper but you will be served lunch portions.  You can do to-go here and you do not even have to go inside.  There is a drive-through window in the back.  I have never used the drive-through window but I am sure you have to call it in first.  \n\nThe cold noodles appetizer with peanut sauce is well portioned and comes with bean sprouts.  I am a sucker for bean sprouts.  However, The thing that makes this Chinese restaurant unique and stand out from the rest is that there are a few plates here that they will bring out on a sizzling plate.  I got the sizzling beef and my fiance got the surf and turf, both of which come on a sizzling plate.  The sizzling beef comes with mushrooms and a brown sauce and the surf and turf comes with mixed vegetables.  The thing about the sizzling plates is that the sauce will boil on the plate and concentrate into a delicious paste.  We both ordered brown rice which they brought out in a covered bowl for us to share.  If you want to keep a low profile at this restaurant do not order the sizzling plates because everyone will be looking at you wishing they had ordered that.  Next time I will try something else but it is definitely worth the experience to get.  \n\nWanFunderful.", "business_id": "i-tKO0n-1Tq6sTFUrhg9-Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-11-17", "type": "review"}

($3.50) Mildly spicy, it looked and tasted unlike the typical hot and sour offerings and we enjoyed the taste, particularly the enoki 'shrooms. The bowl was small but priced accordingly and enough for starters.\n4 stars\n\n- Cold Sesame Noodles w/ Peanut Sauce ($6) a serving of stale pasta noodles with a dollop of commercially made sauce on top. Not fit for consumption. \n0 stars\n\n- Spring rolls, one meat one vegetarian Greasy, tasteless and pretty awful albeit when dipped the sauce made it passable.. barely. Personally I didn't feel cheated,  I'm no great fan of spring rolls, Since they're complimentary : \nno rating\n\n- Bang Bang Shrimp was the favorite. (lunch $8.50, dinner $14.50) I found the flavor mildly spicy, complex and rich. The dish was described as a curry on a bed of angel hair pasta, not what I think of as curry and honestly there was barely any pasta at all however the shrimp was both abundant and excellent, I'd definitely order it again -for lunch.\n4 stars\n\n- Scallops in Garlic sauce w/mushrooms, peppers etc (same $8.50/$14.50) also mildly spicy and tasty but with less bite and too sweet for my taste. Lots and lots of large scallops, I'm giving it an extra 1/2 star for that reason only.\n3 1/2 stars\n\nThe service was trying hard but was clumsy to the point of rudeness, maybe just a cultural thing. We found it amusing and I'm not deducting any points for it - however under the wrong circumstances I could see customers going postal.\n\nShort of hiding an Opium den upstairs I don't see how this restaurant could be mistaken for any 5 star establishment.

Decor and lighting set a great mood. I actually felt a bit under dressed in a tee-shirt and jeans but I wasn't the only one dressed so casually.  The food was so so.  If you like Americanized Chinese you will be delighted as it was certainly a cut above most with that sort of menu.  I, on the other hand, love Chinese cuisine and even cook it extensively at home and do not appreciate the hybridization so much.  I ordered the tofu vegetable soup, pork dumplings, gai lan with oyster sauce, eggplant in garlic sauce, and the steamed basa in black bean sauce.  The soup had a nice chicken broth but the tofu was lacking, just a couple slivers.  The vegetables in the soup were a frozen medley* variety with the processed baby carrots, snow peas, and cauliflower.  The pork dumplings were certainly made in house and quite good. The gai lan with oyster sauce was actually shanghi tips (baby bok choy) with a thin brown sauce that was quite light in flavor and a sprinkling of jarred minced garlic ontop, not what we ordered (or on the menu as we could tell).  The eggplant in garlic sauce came to the table as eggplant with a szechuan style sweet and sour sauce.  The fish came to the table as a steamed fillet on a plate with the same frozen vegetable* ontop except the medley was peppers, onions, carrot, broccoli.  The sauce was not radically different than the sauce accompanying the shanghi tips with the addition of a sprinkling of fermented black beans in lieu of the garlic.  We gobbled it up, afterall it was Thanksgiving for these out-of-towners, and it wasn't bad.

We decided to try it on Sunday after church. It  looked like it might be crowded with all the cars in the parking lot but when we got in the restaurant was bigger than it looks and it didn't feel cramped at all. Another surprise is apparently Sunday's they just do a buffet.  \n\nThe inside was your typical American-Chinese restaurant look with the brass bars, and large fish tanks and a bit of flair from the 80's.  One thing that stuck out like a sore thumb is the absence of sound. It honestly felt like family dinner time after report cards came out. Besides the occasional cough and banging of fork on the plate that was it. My wife and I actually felt uncomfortable holding a conversation above a faint whisper. Don't know what the deal was with that maybe the other customers were regulars and were used to the \"no talking while you eat\".\n\nThe food was average. It was a relatively small buffet, featuring two types of rice, some noodles, sesame chicken, beef and broccoli, egg rolls, chicken wings, and about 5 variations of chicken, cashews, and sauce.  I will say the egg rolls were the size of hot pockets and tasted like had been either fried way to long or they were using old oil. The sesame chicken was crispy which was nice but the sauce tasted like it was just poured out of a drum. Nothing to write home about.  At least the service was good. I noticed on someone else's review, they mentioned the service is a little over bearing at times. I couldn't take a sip of tea with out him trying to refill it.  All in all it was a very bland an QUIET lunch. Maybe since it was on a Sunday the food was a little below par, I'll have to try it again and order off the menu and see how it goes.", "business_id": "qam5QKFE2a8MQBkxznrr3w", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-09-21", "type": "review"}

It was big, but mostly empty...  which isn't a good sign to me at 12:00 noon on a weekday.  The ladies went ahead and I parked the car. The hostess told me that there were not three ladies sitting together. I know they just walked in ahead of me. I spotted them in the corner.\n\nFirst impression: the place is old and in need of some updates. It was really dark inside. There were far too many employees on staff for a restaurant with so few patrons.   \n\nThey sat us at a booth in the corner.  Our table was served the traditional bowls of watered down hot mustard and pink duck sauce...  the fried noodles were too done almost burnt, a disappointment.  \n\nWe had four people at our table. I ordered Hot and spicy scallops, fried rice and an egg roll.  Two people in our party ordered chicken broccoli with fried rice and egg rolls. One ordered chicken with cashews fried rice and an egg roll. The hot and sour soup was delicious and just the right temperature. \n\nWhen the food arrived, the portion sizes seemed correct and the fried rice was tasty with egg, peas and pork pieces in it.  I'm sad to say that the rice was the best part of our plates. One person got white rice instead of fried rice as ordered. The waitress did offer to get the fried rice.  My scallops were undercooked and stringy and mushy, I could tell they were almost done but just barely edible. It tasted very much like the brown sauce was burnt.  The egg rolls were overcooked and almost burnt.  \n\nThe aquarium was nice and we enjoyed it for a few minutes on the way out. I had eaten here before and it was much better in the past.

Keep in mind for this review that we are vegetarians and that did contribute to our disappointment with this experience, but not so much.\n\nWhen we arrived, the image of the establishment quickly began to drop, and it never stopped.   I saw that there were many, many kids both in the restaurant and more who were waiting to come in.  There was a \"policy\" posted on the host stand that dealt with children and having them stay away from the buffet.\n\nAnother thing I noticed was that this buffet was small, and the price I saw that we would be paying per person was $10.99 (definitely a problem for us vegetarians, but I will get to the fact that the quality was still not there).  With drinks, we ended up paying $30 for an incredibly low quality meal that I still regret committing to.\n\nMost things in the buffet were cold enough that when I got to the table to eat, everything I had on my plate was no longer hot.  Most of their vegetarian options were limited, and the buffet did not seem fully stocked.  My girlfriend had gotten some lo mein which I wanted to try, and when I went to get some, the container was empty except for the remaining noodles that were stuck to the bottom.  The egg foo yung (that we both decided to try for the first time) did not have much flavor at all as well.

The calamari was so stringy that I had to swallow it in one bite because I couldn't separate it with my teeth.  The egg rolls were at least crispy and well-rolled, but they had absolutely no seasoning other than a tad too much salt.  The shrimp were overcooked, the barbecue pork was dry, and the hot dumplings were cold and under seasoned.\n\nThen came the entrees.  I ordered Imperial Chicken, thinking that being the restaurant's namesake, it had to be good.  I was wrong.  The breading was mushy, the chicken was dry, and the sauce was basically  sweet and sour sauce with added hoisan, and several dried peppers that were burnt so badly they added an unintentional, overdone smoky flavor.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the Ma-po Tofu.  He loves spicy food, and this was just a little spicy, but the spice overpowered all the other flavors in the dish (besides the scallions).  The tofu was a good texture, but the unbalanced sauce flavors basically rendered it inedible.\n\nApart from the horrendous food was the tepid service.  I had to ask several times for a glass of water.  The waitress came by with the water pitcher and had just enough to fill my glass up halfway, so she returned to the kitchen for a refill and stopped by to fill my boyfriend's glass.  By this time, I drank my half glass of water - and she didn't even bother to top mine off.  I tried to ask for some, but she walked away.  \n\nPlus, I thought it was supposed to be an authentic Chinese food restaurant - what's with the Vivaldi and Mozart soundtrack?\n\nSkip this place all together and hit up the Asian grocery and gas station next door.

They didnt drown the food in sauce and The rice was good too. I didn't expect the food to be as good as it was because I didn't think a franchise could deliver good tasting Chinese cuisine. They did a good job.\n\nI have definitely had better stir fry  but this spot came through with a good dish. I would go back if I find myself in this hood again.

Liked it so much that I got a lunch special to go for the bus ride over to O'Hare. They packed it up tight but remember to take napkins, condiments and utensils. I loved the shrimp with broccoli (also had carrots) and the shrimp were large and plentiful. Wonton soup (4 big dumplings) on a cold day was delish and included in the lunch special. Also got chicken egg foo yung which included large, well filled egg roll - also tasty, mustardy sauce OK (not as good as the brown sauce I'm used to).

Let me first say that I have searched many locations nearby, including the House of Mei, and that I have pretty high (but reasonable) standards when it comes to Asian food: Delicious food, fresh ingredients, adequate portion sizes, and (for a huge bonus) something that makes them stand out from the others. I should also note that the dish I judge all of them by is Vegetable Lo Mein (plain, I know, but it levels the playing field). So, I ordered take-out of the Lo Mein, lunch special (General Tso's Chicken) and hot and sour soup.\n\nFOOD TASTE/QUALITY: The overall taste was okay; pretty good. Not bad, but nothing really stood out to me as tremendous. Some of the dishes were better than others. The General Tso's Chicken was a mix of predominantly dark meat, and the sauce was pretty standard. Some pieces were stuck together, making a clump of meat (not my favorite). The fried rice that came with the chicken was very good. Lo Mein was not bad. The egg noodles were cooked nicely (not overly cooked; firm), but it was a bid too runny for me (i.e, liquid at the bottom of the box). Soup was also pretty good. The vegetables seemed to me a mix of fresh and canned. Again, not my absolute favorite food taste/quality, but not at all bad for Sun Prairie.\n\nPRESENTATION: Styrofoam boxes and plastic containers for the take-out (small box for the rice and Lo Mein). But, it was packaged well and tightly put together in a brown paper bag. Everything made it home nicely. \n\nPORTION: This is where Chang Jiang shined. The lunch special was so much food, that I could not finish it in one sitting. It was allot of chicken -- perhaps 1 to 1.5 pounds. The Lo Mein comes in two sizes (small and large); the box was packed tightly and came with a nice amount. Overall, I was very impressed with the portions. You will not go away hungry!\n\nPRICES: In short, very reasonable. All of their menu and prices are posted at changjiangsunprairie.com , so there are no surprises. As an example, the small Lo Mein was $3.55 (large would have been $6.25). General Tso's Combo plate was $7.55. Soup was $2.15. Considering the monstrous portions, the prices are a HUGE draw. They often have coupons online for an even sweeter deal.\n\nDELIVERY/TAKE-OUT EXPERIENCE: This is a classic take-out place. Pretty small without any real places to dine-in; think small take-out window in a strip mall. I ordered online (before they opened for lunch), and they were Johnny-on-the-spot, having everything ready at the exact time I said I would be there. The person I paid was very nice, even honoring a coupon that I forgot at home. They seemed genuinely happy to have my business. That was impressive. Living in the Midwest, though, I would LOVE for them to take up delivery! But with online ordering and easy pick up, it was pretty good.\n\nFINAL NOTES/IMPRESSIONS (3.5 to 4 stars): As I said, I am admittedly hard on Chinese food take-out/delivery, and want food that blows me away with quality and taste. Was Chang Jiang doing all of that? No, not completely. But, the food was good, the portions were fantastic, and the prices were awesome. In the Midwest, that's not too bad! For me, I will return and would not have a problem recommending it to others.", "business_id": "NDAxF0_RCZBQedVO_d5WnA", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-10-27", "type": "review"}

Since other reviewers did not go into significant detail about the offerings, I'll mention my first time experience recently on a Sunday (where there were about three other tables of diners):\n\n- peanut butter chicken\n- mongolian beef\n- chow mein\n- a few sushi rolls (x2 varieties)\n- crab rangoons (better than average)\n- spring rolls (eggrolls, more aptly)\n- popcorn shrimp\n- two types of soups - your basic hot and sour or egg drop (these were just OK)\n- chicken skewers (these were excellent even though I didn't expect them to be based on appearance)\n- seafood stir fry w/ veggies\n- fish fillets\n- dessert options looked like a few types of cakes and fruit, pudding, and jello.\n\nI like the emphasis on quality rather than quantity. And this place was clean.  It's tucked away in a strip mall by Walmart, so points against it for location.  But you can't beat the price, $7-8 for a buffet meal!

This is the closet I've come, much to my disappointment. This restaurant keeps getting into my apartment building, despite the security doors. Today they just stuck them in the elevator. Which I thought was pretty neat compared to their normal door spamiming. Then I went down to the first floor and realized they also just scattered them all over the floor.\n\nIn my phoenix and dragon I had five \"jumbo\" shrimps. Which are really just average sized shrimp. The only thing I can think of is that they consider the mini shrimp some Chinese places have as normal. I guess compared to those the shrimp is jumbo. The \"spicy chicken\" is just general tso's. I got medium spice which was barely spicy at all. Most of my dish ended up being peas, carrots, and onions in a weird \"spicy\" sauce that wasn't very good.\n\nI also got the rangoons. Some one else mentioned in this that they don't really have much crab. Which is an understatement. There's maybe a flick of crab in each.

Good sauce, good flavor, good consistency.   \n\nLunch doesn't get any better at $4.95 which includes an entree, rice, and soup!\n\nSummary: friendly service, awesome food, good prices.

I ordered my go to - cashew chicken - and my friend ordered one of her go to's - fried rice with beef - and we were both NOT impressed. Second bite into my chicken, and it's HARD. Like BONE hard.

The best parts of my cashew chicken were the cashews and the white rice - which if you don't know - are impossible to mess up.

I was fired on a very contrived reason - I think it was because this place doesn't get enough business.\n\nLocation is pretty bad for visibility, even if it's convenient to campus.  Food is very average, but I like it more than, say Panda Express.  My parents run a restaurant so I have experience (which is why I was hired in the first place) - this is one of the most inefficiently-run restaurants ever.  The vegetable dishes are good, though, and the Chinese-language menu is generally good quality if you don't mind a wait.  The bosses both cook when necessary, but it's best to come during weekdays, when the main cook is in.  The hot pot is also fairly popular, but most of the meats are frozen.  Other things that are frozen include the \"Wheaten Foods\" menu (potstickers, wontons, and meat buns).  I think that's pretty SOP here in CU, though.\n\nPortion sizes are okay.  They definitely shrank in the 3 months I worked there.  I won't analyze pricing, because I'm not used to eating out, but I think most people consider them fair or just slightly overpriced.\n\nThings to not get include the highly-Americanized items on the menu, especially those with breaded chicken in them.  The quick lunch was phased out mostly - now it's a selection of two Chinese braised dishes, so they keep pretty well (and have an average turnover).  Instead, they now offer \"Combos,\" which are your standard rice and a main dish, with an egg roll.  They used to give a soda with these, but now only offer iced tea, hot tea, or a small bowl of egg drop or hot and sour soup.  Don't get the soups (including noodle soups) or appetizers unless you really like egg rolls (they're decent but nothing special).  Certain dishes like the pork with mustard greens (P10, IIRC) are frozen, but I think they're probably okay if you don't mind them defrosting/reheating via microwave.  The smoothies and bubble tea are a no-no - they're edible and not too terrible, or so I hear, but go to Evo's or some other place for these; the slushies are okay if you don't mind a lot of sugar.  Most customers seem okay with the fish, but it doesn't look too great to me (aka it smells, and fresh fish doesn't).  To qualify that last statement, it doesn't reek like rotten fish, but you can definitely get a stronger smell than I think is usual when you gut one (I bass fish at home and clean my own catch) - plus, while it's inevitable, it's frozen and quick-defrosted (aka in the sink, in a water bath with direct contact, rather than through a bag).  Hardly sanitary).\n\nLike some other reviews have stated, they really do skimp as much as possible on ingredients, equipment, etc.  Ingredients come in on Thursday nights from Far East, and I'm not sure when other ingredients come in.  However, I'd say to come on Friday, because they probably push the old vegetables on Thursday (I only worked TR lunch and Sundays, so I can't say for certain).\n\nA few big points about the owners' behavior (which they also try to instill in the workers): first, they will try to dissuade you from getting something that they feel is too much trouble to cook at the moment, never mind if they have all the ingredients ready (usually this is because it's busy); secondly, they do cut corners, as aforementioned.  Another thing that most people probably aren't too concerned about because they aren't very aware of it, is the matter of the \"special soup.\"  They only give it to regular customers, but more generally to any Chinese or Chinese-speaking customers.  If you're not Chinese/speaking-proficiency or a repeat customer who asks, tough luck (I've seen this attitude referred to on foodie blogs as \"soup Nazism\").  A last point on their behavior is that they will lie about what they have and don't have, especially when it comes to drinks or if they feel they're too busy to bother with your order.  Normally this happens with drinks (they keep changing their Combo meals, and they decided to stop giving sodas with them because they didn't want to stock up); they will also refuse to make you a smoothie or other blended drink if they're busy.\n\nBasically, they have an undersized facility, an undertrained staff (one of the bosses in particular gets in the way more than he keeps things going), an undersized staff, and basically a very mediocre business model.  I'm kind of astounded they've survived, but if you know what to get, you can get a pretty decent meal here.\n\nTo conclude, there aren't a lot of repeat customers, but they try to treat the ones they recognize well.  However, I went to Cravings with a friend yesterday, and I saw a lot of former customers that stopped coming there.  I'd say they made a good choice (Cravings has much better service, food, and atmosphere).  Other good Chinese restaurants in the area, in no particular order, include Mandarin and Lai-Lai.  The Wok in Mahomet is legendary among the Chinese on campus, but that's another story", "business_id": "u06X5C_pIAVuOXOznIcPYw", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-11-19", "type": "review"}

When we go out to eat we usually want to try a bunch of things (and have leftovers), so my husband got lemongrass beef.  If you like peppers, that is the dish for you.  The beef was very peppery tasting, but the lemongrass added a deeper flavor, too.

I got to select from maybe 12 pre-prepared dishes for the lunch special (I think they switch the dishes out daily), and I got to pick a side of either rice or rice noodles. I got rice noodles. The amount they gave me was jaw dropping. A lunch special honestly equals about two meals. If you order only two entrees, they pack in more of the entrees to fill the box, so I think it's a better deal to just get two if you don't mind less variety.

He didn't address us at all and just choose to talk Chinese to the only person in the table to understand it. That was extremely rude and I was quite offended by it.", "business_id": "Kck9wE9Z1S_xxzglh1Qdwg", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-09-19", "type": "review"}

(EDIT: See the update below)\n\nWent on what was quite possibly one of their busiest evenings - First Fridays (art walk). Luckily though, we had made reservations earlier in the week. Called about an hour beforehand and asked if we could add one more person to our party of two - they were very accommodating. \n\nWe did have to wait a little bit for our table, but I figured that would be expected on such a crazy night with people everywhere. We got a cute little table in the \"garage\" of the house. The atmosphere was fun, and our room was cozy. \n\nI didn't find the pricing out of the ordinary at all. We shared spring rolls ($5),I had pad thai with chicken ($11) and a side of rice ($1), while my friends had the dynamite with tofu ($9) and the coconut curry.  The three of us all had their fun line of teas which were the only thing I considered to be pricey... $4 for about two glass fulls. \n\nOverall our waitress was really nice, the DJ spun upstairs which added to the fun, and the food was good (spicy!!) and reasonably priced. Also the best pad thai I have had since moving to phoenix from Seattle. I would definitely go back!\n\nUPDATE: Went back a second time, and while the food was again very good, the staff was not as nice. Went on a \"first friday\" again but it was raining so no one was out. Had reservations but waited a bit to be seated. Was again seated in the \"garage\" but when a second party came into the garage, all of a sudden everyone wanted the doors open although it was raining and blustery outside. We were not asked if we were comfortable with this, and as a result had to put our coats back on and rush to finish eating before we froze. Also, the 4th member of our party arrived late and they not only informed us that they had a strict no-late-members policy (meaning she was basically refused food), but they didn't even look at her.

All you Yelpers must be in on some vast conspiracy to chat this place up on days when I'm outside sweating to the sweet sounds of backhoes instead of procrastinating on this site under the soul sucking fluorescent lights of the office.\n\nWell played.\n\nI wish I could say the same about Fate.\n\nMy dining partner (who is obviously in on the scheme as well) had heard rave reviews about this place from roommates and friends alike, so we swung by to grab a bite on a Thursday night. He was looking forward to a delectable Pan-Asian experience. I was just looking for something to satisfy my gnawing hunger. \n\nWe didn't have a very hard time finding the place, which seems to be a common complaint, and stumbled upon a cute little converted house with a group of five sipping beers outside as they waited for a table. Since they're on summer hours or something, only one of the two houses was open, and none of the cool outdoor decorations (aside from the wicked Buddah head) were present. Just a tiny little stylized sign that stated, \"Fate.\" \n\nI really hoped that the stars were about to align and the combined fury of the kitchen and wait staff would result in the culmination of its namesake. \n\nAfter entering the restaurant and approaching the hostess, I was startled by the number of empty tables in the place and pleased that we'd soon have some saucy, ricey goodness to sate our hunger. Unfortunately, that wasn't so. She made us wait outside, after specifically barring us from remaining indoors, for five minutes. Baffling, but no biggie. Then we were ushered into a tiny room at the front of the establishment that boasted Ikea decor and very little ambiance, so I can't even give it points on that basis, which also seems to be a big seller with reviewers. We also sat about a foot and a half from the table next to us and I had to listen to the most pretentious and vapid conversation I've been a party to in recent memory. Not good.\n\nThe waitress was very friendly and attentive, and we placed our order for a couple iced teas and the pot sticker appetizer. When it came time for us to order, she was great help with the menu and we decided on the Cantonese Black Dragon Beef and the Szechuan chicken. \n\nAfter paying four bucks for a bottle of Republic of Tea, which is by no means 'gourmet,' I was a little miffed but willing to ride out the experience and judge by food alone. Then the potstickers came on a bamboo platter and I felt those stars starting to drift into alignment. I raised one to my lips after dipping it into the sauce and the celestial bodies whizzed right by each other with no care for fulfilling their fate.\n\nThey were comparable to frozen Costco brand potstickers and the sauce they came with was heavy on soy sauce and light on any other flavor. I was too hungry to care so I scarfed my fair share, but my dining partner was completely turned off. Still, I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt, maybe it was an off night in the kitchen. Then the food arrived with a little side of rice. \n\nIt tasted a little better than your mom and pop corner shop Chinese, but it was on par with anything at P.F. Chang's. And if I can compare it to a nationwide chain, it doesn't deserve any more than a mediocre rating. My food was the perfect serving size, with just the right amount of rice, but the sauce was drastically different than any other szechuan dish I've ever had and the some of the chicken was diced into itsy bitsy little pieces that funked with the texture. I was really hungry, so I wasn't that critical, but my dining partner ate about three bites of his and declared, \"I'm never coming back here again.\" To put it simply, he thought it sucked. Hard.\n\nFate is a restaurant that seems to cater to individuals that place ambiance very highly in their dining experience. The food isn't great nor is it well priced, but I may have gone on an off night, so I'm willing to give it another shot and possibly adjust my review. I'll just have to find someone else to enjoy it with.", "business_id": "VsO_rhXi5lgbaGxNwoEZsQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2007-09-15", "type": "review"}

It happened to be right by the Roosevelt where we were actually going to meet up with some of you Yelpers.  You know who you are people.  Hi guys!  It was fun!\n\nWe parked and walked up and went inside.  The decor was nice. It seemed to have a decent atmosphere but I am not the type to be suckered in by all that crap.  If a place sucks, I don't care how chic the atmosphere is.  I will call a spade a spade.  \n\nThe place wasn't full, quite the opposite really.  Maybe 2 or 3 tables were occupied.  So we go up to the hostess and tell her we'd like a table for two and she says that it'll be about 5 minutes which I am fine with but when I ask her if we can wait in inside she says \"No.  Please wait outside.\"  What the fuck is that about?  I could understand if they were super busy and they didn't have any open tables for us to even sit at putting us in the way but if it weren't for the damn techno-look-at-me-I'm-cool music they were playing, you could hear crickets chirping in this joint.  Strike one!  So we go outside and wait.  She comes out after awhile and gives some other people that are waiting some drinks then tells us she'll be right back after she goes and grabs a couple of menus.  They must keep the menus in the parking lot or something because it took her awhile to come back.  \n\nShe sits us in this corner that's pretty much hidden away from everything.  So here we are eating in a restaurant that I'm convinced people go to only to be seen and here we are not being seen.  Oh woe is me!  Woe, woe, woe is me!  However will I earn my cool points for the month?\n\nThe waitress was very nice and attentive.  I'll give them that but god damn could they keep this place any darker.  I realize it adds ambiance but when you're struggling to read the damn menu it's a little much.  Strike two!\n\nWe order a couple of $4 Republic of Teas and the pot stickers then proceed to peruse the rest of the menu.  The variety is somewhat lacking and a common theme is sweetness.  As anyone who knows me will tell you, I don't do sweet.  So I order the Cantonese Dragon Beef and my significant other orders the Szechuan Chicken.\n\nThe waitress comes back with the pot stickers.  They sucked.  They were identical to the ones you get at Costco.  They are just like the ones they serve at Casey Moore's during happy hour only there they're free.  Here they cost $6.  I eat one and that's it.  Strike three!\n\nThen comes the entrees.  Decent sized portions.  I can't really tell you if the presentation was good because it was so damn dark in there but I'll just give them the benefit of the doubt on that one.  Mine was in a word, crap.  The best thing you could say about it is that it tasted weird.  I didn't even like the mushrooms.  I am a mushroom fanatic.  If there are two things on a menu that both look awesome and one has mushrooms and the other doesn't, the mushrooms always tip the scales.  But they didn't even save this dish.  I am beginning to think the baseball metaphor wasn't the best route to go as here we are already at strike four.  \n\nSo in my disappointment I decide to give my girlfriends Szechuan Chicken a try.  Baseball was definitely not the way to go because we're at strike five now.  \n\nSo now my only option is the white rice that came with the dish.  This thankfully was perfectly adequate.  Now if I go to a fucking CHINESE restaurant and the best compliment I can give the food is \"At least they didn't fuck up the rice\", we are in some ugly territory here people.  \n\nIf you're looking to go to some hip chic place cuz you want to here the latest spins from DJ Such and such, skip Fate, hit up Hunan Express and then just go straight to Myst or Drift or where ever the shiny shirts happen to be on that given night.

I had high expectations, since I had been to Lucky Dragon in the past (the owners prev joint) which was OK.\n\nIt was the worst Chinese/Asian I've had in AZ, the service was terrible, the chairs uncomfortable, and to top it off my fiancee got food poisoning.... and has been sick for the last 2 days from it. I took her to the ER this morning at 4:30 AM and decided to finally start posting on Yelp since I've been a lurker for a while.\n\nAesthetics:\nInitially looks like a typical hipster restaurant like you might find in another city. Nice patio, cool inside.  However... The seating at a bus stop is more comfy. There is no chair back - just this high bar thing that digs into your back.\n\nI'm going to file this under aesthetics - we ordered the Hot and Sour soup (more on that later) and the waitress suggested it was large enough to share. However, they apparently don't have any kind of serving utensil, so we had to use our little soup spoons to serve ourself soup into another bowl out of this wide shallow terrine. WTF?\n\nService:\nI don't know a nicer way to say it, our waitress was a dopey bimbo. It took 20 minutes for her to take our order. She went missing for long periods of time when I had an empty water glass, and then for a while longer after I tracked her down and asked for some. Not good.\n\nFood:\nI ran into a friend there, and he commented at how he loved the food and was surprised we didn't like it. To be blunt, it was utter crap. \n\nThe hot and sour soup was thin and spicy. That's it. It tasted like chiles and a splash of rice wine vinegar- no other flavors present. It's not like any hot and sour soup I ever had.... in a bad way. There are these weird chewy dumplings like things in it that would be better served at protecting the floor from your chair leg. \n\nI ordered some Saigon basil something or other dish with beef, she ordered the Lemon Grass whatever with tofu.\nMy dish was bad. The beef was sliced thin but tough and chewy, and totally lacked flavor. As for basil, there were 2 small basil leaves in the dish, and that's it. The sauce was thin and one dimensional. \n\nHer lemon grass dish was also bad. The sauce tasted like Tom Yum paste from the chinese grocery store mixed with some water. I felt bad for the poor abused tofu.\n\nI'm not a big fan of chain restaurants.... but Pei Wei and Pickup Sticks are about 10x better in terms of food quality and taste. Screw that, even the chinese place in the mall food court is better. I am not exaggerating. It was a very disappointing meal.\n\nNow for the nasty part.\nI drank water - Fiancee unit drank th 'Green Tea.' It was like no other green tea I ever had seen. It was leprechaun green, with some kind of milk like substance in it.I thought it looked kinda funky, but she drank it.\n\nIt was the only difference between our meals. I tried hers, she tried mine, etc. I didn't drink the science experiment tea.\n\nWell... Several hours later she started having stabbing stomach pains. She spent the whole night up vomiting and with diarrhea.  2 days later the vomiting has subsided but she's missed 2 days of school and is still pooping up a storm. I took her to the ER at 4:30 AM this morning and they confirmed the symptoms were consistent with food poisoning. Admittedly she had just gotten back a 45 days ago from a trip to a 3rd world country where she got (and recovered from) a tropical disease so her immune system is not at it's strongest right now, but come on. This shouldn't be the end result. Plus this IS downtown Phoenix so there are plenty of people around with compromised immune systems, if you know what I mean, due to lifestyle choices.\n\nThere is some great Asian food in Central Phoenix. \n\nMaxim and Da Vang are great Vietnamese places on 19th ave.\nThe Cultural Center has a few great places, esp Golden Buddha. \nThai Lahna has been consistently good for years.\nLike I said I don't eat a lot of chain food - but even the Pei Wei at 7th ave and McDowell is way better in terms of food quality.", "business_id": "VsO_rhXi5lgbaGxNwoEZsQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2007-10-13", "type": "review"}

I don't know if it's the economy, or what, but what's with cutting back portions even smaller? Sorry, but I can't see the justification in spending $12 on 1 1/2 cups of food and a measley 1/2 cup of white rice that might satisfy one person. I mean, the portions weren't large to begin with, why cut them back even more? \n\nAlso, it's time to rethink your management skills. The veteran servers have always been amazing, but what's with the hostess? It would be nice being greeted with a smile and 'hello'. Instead you're made out to look stupid and completely clueless - upping the awkwardness. Also, they need to just get rid of the \"bar\" like table. Everyone mistakes it for a bar and gets their heads bit off when they attempt to wait there...and it hasn't proven to be a comfy dining area unless you're in a big group, so maybe they should just consider actually making it a bar/waiting area or ONLY reserving it for large groups. Forget this sandwiching a party of two between two large parties business...\n\nBack to the management...Johnny Chu and his wife \"manager\" need to jump off their high horses. The elitist attitudes they boast would be more understandable if they actually had reason to do so. \n\nIt's time Fate does some serious re-thinking of their establishment...it's obvious through the Yelp reviews that they're not doin' too hot anymore. \n\n2 stars for the good food (but shitty portions) and veteran servers.", "business_id": "VsO_rhXi5lgbaGxNwoEZsQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2008-10-21", "type": "review"}

The large was $2. Now, it's $3.50.  It is something stupid but still annoying.\n\nAlso, it is hard to order food from them over the phone... To tell you the truth I sometimes have trouble ordering food from them there because they dont seem to be able to communicate very well in English. And you always have to double check your order.\n\nThe food is inconsistent.  It's not great but it's food and still fairly inexpensive. I wont bother eating there again because their food keeps getting worse & worse. I have had 2 friends get sick from their food. Watch out for their chicken! My friend said he got undercooked chicken from this place.\n\nAlso, They wont give out copies of their to-go menu with the new prices on it.

Yes, I said it, Its garbage.  Its a semi formal dining hall serving bland white meat chicken in a variety of sweet and sour sauces.  Restaurants like PF Changs exist, so that people don't have to motivate their taste buds to explore further reaching foods, especially Asian cuisine.  \n\nThen there is the Gourmet House of Hong Kong, masked in an entire ideology against Chain/Bad Chinese restaurants.  To say this is a \"hole in the wall\", would be an understatement of epic proportions.  Found on the corner of right around 10th street and McDowell, this inconspicuous dining hall stands, ready to show anyone who will listen, what true Cantonese cooking is. \n\nUpon entering, do not be scared. No, it is not travertine tile, elaborate fish tanks, black napkins and the playmates of the month serving you your food.  Yes, that is really just a plain circle table with a white paper napkin and some soy sauce and chili oil containers. Yes, the restaurant is old and beaten up.  Yes, that is the smell of fish in the air, do not worry, in around three visits you will be swooning for that sweet aroma to come to your table.\n\nNow lets talk about what matters.  THE FOOD.  Hands down, the best noodles in Arizona.  I recommend the shrimp chow mein.  It is a bed of soft egg noodles, crunchy on top with at least a dozen U-20 size shrimp and baby bok choy resting on a delicious sauce.  I could have this dish by itself every other night of the week and for ten dollars, I might as well.  The wor wonton soup is a deep flavorful broth, filled with not just one piece of broccoli and a few wontons, but swimming with shrimp, beef, chicken, vegetables and wontons.  The crispy dry noodles are a great accompaniment to the soup and are always on the house.  Want to try something different? How about a \"scramble with shrimp\".  This is just as it sounds, a Cantonese variation of egg foo young, that is a medium bed of fluffy scrambled egg with shrimp and green onion mixed in, just phenomenal.  Right now they are serving 1.5-2 pound lobsters for eighteen dollars. That's a ridiculously great deal for such a large lobster. They will make it any way you want, I recommend steamed with black bean sauce and green peppers.  \n\nI could go on and on and about this place, but I will stop here.  Let it be said though, if you are looking for atmosphere or a contemporary hip restaurant, this is not your place. If you are looking to get down and dirty and eat some real Cantonese cuisine, you will not find a better place in the valley.", "business_id": "ykfTh6HI219NoMsWBxulxw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-09-19", "type": "review"}

A few months ago, I had a great experience learning about authentic Sichuan from Helen Y when she invited me to join her at Szechwan Palace in the Chinese Cultural Center, and this past weekend, she invited my husband and me, along with some other very fortunate Yelpers, including David S B, Jason W, and Alexander C, to eat some more amazing and authentic Chinese at Lao Ching Hing (according to her review, their Chinese menu features mostly Shanghainese food with some Sichuan dishes and a few Cantonese dishes). \n\nJust as at Szechwan Palace, the atmosphere of the restaurant was nothing special. In fact, it was a little messy, at least in the little area with the large round table where they sat us - we were surrounded by all of these rows of boxes and random containers. Oh, well - atmosphere aside, the service was friendly and prompt (our waters were always kept full), and the food was incredible. So that you are able to order some more authentic items, I'll give you a breakdown of what Helen ordered for us off the Chinese menu (which she has so generously translated and posted to the business info section of this review): \n\n*Cold jellyfish in scallion oil - This had a nice semi-chewy texture (reminded me of octupus) and a vinegary sauce. Reminded me of kim chi, which I love. \n*Wok-fried rice cakes - Little oval noodles (same texture as Chow Fun) in a savory light sauce with fresh, crunchy vegetables\n*1/2 crispy duck - Tender meat with crispy skin; served with Hoisin sauce\n*\"Ants Climbing Up a Tree\" - Unusual name but tasty dish. It was vermicelli (thin noodles) with a minced meat and chili sauce. \n*Whole salt and pepper shrimp - These were crispy and had the perfect amount of salt and pepper coating. The shrimp themselves were a little fishy, though. Highly recommend eating them whole (including the eyes!)\n*Beef tendon and tripe in scallion oil - I wasn't wild about the texture, but the spicy sauce was really savory and flavorful.\n*Soup dumplings - Little dumplings filled with soup broth that you have to eat in one big bite. They were good, but I preferred the ones that we had at Szechwan Palace. \n*Fish pieces w/ sauce - I could be wrong, but I think these were  the \"spicy soybean paste with sliced fish\" from the menu. They were very bony and difficult to eat, but I enjoyed the flavor. \n*Peking spare ribs - Delicious! Had the most savory sauce and really tender meat. \n*Drunken chicken - Not a huge fan of this dish. The chicken was a bit dry, instead of falling off the bone, and the skin wasn't crispy at all. \n*Chopped Shanghainese greens with tofu in sesame oil  - Served cold. Was really flavorful and light and would be great as a vegetarian appetizer. \n*Sauteed \"snake\" gourd with soy beans - To the best of my knowledge, this consisted of pieces of sauteed squash with soy beans in a clear, mild sauce. The vegetables were cooked perfectly, and the sauce was the perfect complement. \n*Steamed and deep-fried bun - This came in the shape of a long roll that we had to cut into individual pieces. It was delicious doughy and slightly crispy on the outside and was fabulous dipped in some chili sauce. \n*Green onion pancake - This has always been one of my favorite authentic Chinese dishes and has a wonderful mealy texture. Again, excellent dipped in chili sauce!\n*Deep-fried shredded potato - Being that we went at 11:30 on a Sunday, my eye was drawn to this hash-brown-like dish. Didn't regret my choice because it was delicious. Comprised of undercooked and crunchy potato slices in a sauce with chiles. \n\nOne note - nothing we got was ridiculously spicy, but the chili sauce that comes on the table allows you to spice everything to taste and added flavor (and not just mind-numbing heat) to every dish I tried. \n\n15 dishes! I may have forgotten to mention a dish or two, but as you can see, we had a veritable Shanghai feast! In this day and age, feasts usually cost a pretty penny, but the 9 of us walked out having only spent $20 each. Paying that little money for so much incredible and authentic food is just freaking incredible.

I kept looking to Scottsdale for somewhere to eat. We've got just about everything else, from real-deal taco shacks, to excellent Pho, to fine dining. But no real Chinese food. I was looking the wrong way. Up til recently, I would drive all the way to Wong's Place in Tempe just for the real stuff.\n\n\nTHE CHINESE CULTURAL CENTER\nI shop regularly at what used to be Ranch99, that oasis in the desert that makes you feel like you've been transported to the Hell that is Riverside CA. I've tried numerous restaurants in the mall over the years and always been disappointed. The one I never managed to try is the Szechwan Palace. I expected it to be just another Gringonese disaster. Man was I wrong. We eat out maybe once or twice a week, and we've hit this place at least once a week since we found it a few months ago.\n\n\nSZECHWAN PALACE\nI love you, Palace. Dan Dan Noodles. Spice. Yu Xiang dishes. We've been when it's packed full of high maintenance Chinese businessmen and when we're one of 4 tables in the place. Every time, the tiny kitchen and the wonderful servers keep their smiles in place and just give you that little shake of the head that says: \"Solly, it clazy tonight!\" Even though this place pleases real Chinese food lovers, there's plenty of stuff to keep my Jewish mother-in-law happy too (\"happy\" is a relative term).\n\n\nTHINGS I LOVE\n  - Wan Fu: the worst white wine in the world (that I love)\n  - Dan Dan Noodles with extra hot chile\n  - Yu Xiang Shrimp\n  - Mongolian Beef with real beef, not that over-marinated rubbery crap\n  - Fresh veggies that still have some color and snap to them\n  - Incredibly spicy Water-boiled dishes\n  - Any of their soups\n\nWong's thick-skinned pot stickers are still the best, but everything else at the Palace rules.\n\n\nBOTTOM LINE\nIt's hard for me to imagine a bad review being credible unless some key person was missing or they were ridiculously understaffed and got slammed. We've been there for one of those nights though, and it was still very good, once we eventually got served. As others have said: get the real menu as you walk in.

Both the Chinese and Americanized menus are written in English including the description of the dishes. Also, you can ask the waiter to explain the specials. You don't have to speak Chinese or be Chinese to know the specials. After dining here, I realize some people want to sound unique or VIP but trust me, you don't have to be Chinese to taste all the dishes. That is B.S.\n\n2. The Yelp photos donated by members make the dishes appear larger than they are. Most of the sauteed dishes like the Kung Pao chicken and Egglant were not big but then some like the Water Boil chicken was rather big.\n\n3. The food is spicy but it isn't hot. If I had to compare it to a Thai restaurant, the food is about a 5 on a 10 scale. You will probably need to ask them to make it spicier even if you are not one of those crazy people that have to eat everything hot. \n\n4. They do NOT use reheated rice. I was expecting reheated rice that you typically find at Wongs and other Chinese restaurants. This place had fresh soft and sticky rice. It was great.\n\n5. Don't take the American menu for granted. It's done pretty well and includes mainstream meats like chicken, beef, pork. The Chinese menu has tripe and meats not typically eaten by Americans which is why it's left off the American menu. You will likely use the American menu as your base and then use the Chinese menu to add select items. Bottomline: get both menus\n\n6. The restaurant is not a hole in the wall. It's the opposite. It's the nicest Chinese restaurant I've been to in the valley. Yes it is small but stylish and well lit\n\n7. The restaurant is definitely busy but not stand in line busy. We were immediately seated and we went on a Friday night at peak hour. \n\n8. The service was suprisingly good. Like most great and authentic Chinese restaurants, the service is lousy with the waiters being expressionless and forcing you to order quickly. The servers were Chinese but were very friendly and acted like family. They didn't rush you. Water was refilled quickly\n\n9. Dishes - read what has already been written. This is covered well. I insist on order the the Water Boil dish (includes choice of chicken, beef, fish or shrimp) and ordering it spicy!\n\n10. You don't have to be with a big group, a grad student at ASU or someone who speaks Chinese to enjoy this restaurant.

For the unfamiliar its not even related to the black peppercorn, for the familiar its spice properties can be quite magical. Actually the dried berry husk from the prickly ash tree, the USDA banned the peppercorn from 1968-2006. The peppercorn was seen as a hazard due to the potential of carrying citrus canker, a harmful bacteria to citrus crops. The process of heating them to 160 degrees kills any possible bacteria thus lifting the ban. Szechwan Palace, located in the Chinese Cultural Center, celebrates this daily. If you've ever tasted such dishes as Ma Po Tofu or Kung Poa Chicken, then you've had Szechwan cooking before.\n\nThe funny thing about these peppercorns is that they're not even really that spicy. At first the flavor might have a certain peppery pungency that gives way to more of a citrus like aftertaste. Though here's the kicker, as you eat them you might feel your tongue start to tingle then eventually go slightly numb. This sensation is strangely addictive, like getting a shot of Novocain; it might just leave you drooling over your plate.\n\nFor the unadventurous Szechwan Palace does serve your standard type Chin-American food like egg rolls and pork fried rice, but this isn't a strong point. Id skip those items and go right for the more unique dishes, be sure to ask for the full menu rather than the standard \"best of\" version.\n\nBeing a fan of offal and other not so famous cuts of beef, I ordered up the #3 Beef Tendon in Spicy Sauce ($6.95). Fresh cilantro and chewy slices of tendon are mixed with peppercorn oil were a hit. I know that dish isn't for everyone but trust me, its tasty. By contrast the #9 Spicy Cucumber ($3.95) is a little more approachable with cool pieces of raw cucumber seasoned with peppercorns and dried chilies.\n\nThere are a slew of dishes titled \"water boiled\" though none that I have tried seem to be in water. Instead you get a luxurious sauce filled with peppercorns, vegetables and meat or fish. This outing included the #18 Water Boiled Beef ($9.95), fork tender strips of beef in a velvety pepper spiked sauce made my tongue sparkle then go numb. Like I said, these peppercorns are magical.\n\nMy absolute favorite dish was the #98 Rice Cake ($7.95). The thin chewy disks of rice noodles, ground pork and cabbage were bathed in a slightly sweet and smoky sauce was craveable. \n\nWhen ordering the Special Cumin Lamb with Bone ($11.95), Id venture to say that they use the word lamb loosely. The difference between a lamb and a sheep is age and this directly reflects the flavor of the meat. The younger lamb is sweet and tender where sheep aka mutton tends to be extremely gamy and tough, these were definitely the later. No amount of fragrant cumin could cover the extreme gaminess of the meat. This may have been isolated since on a previous visit the dish was exceptional.\n\nWith over 100 choices on the menu plus daily specials, Szechwan Palace brings a whole new level of spice, even if it does numb your tongue.", "business_id": "yQONzVpX-DEpGSuKMIov6A", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-11-26", "type": "review"}

(I didn't complain since it was the same dish but chicken)The dish sounds bland but was extraordinary in taste that smacks you with an ILLEGAL DRUG LIKE EFFECT were each bite gets better and better and you have to keep eating it.

Oil and the right amount of  Szechwan peppercorns float on the top of this large enough for two meal,it was addictive and delicious ,not a building hot spice but completely different .

So when I moved from the Tempe area a few months ago, not being a stones throw from Miu's was, quite honestly, the saddest part.\n\nWhen I found out the Szechwan Palace (Located about three blocks from where I used to live in Arcadia, BTW) also offered the spicy cucumbers, dan dan noodles, and spicy lamb ribs I had come to love, I was so excited to try it and PRAYED it would fill the void in my life that Miu's once filled.  Well, it didn't.\n\nThat's not to say it's not like 1000x better than any other \"Americanized\" Chinese restaurant out there (Also, it's hilarious that they have a an actual section of the menu called \"Americanized Chinese\"), but when comparing Apple to Apples (which I always do when it comes to restaurants like this) Miu's is a 5 and Szechwan is about a 3. Here's my deal (and i ordered my exact order):\n\n1) Spicy cucumbers were warm  One of the most delightful aspects of this dish is the cool temperature combined with the heat.  Warm cucumber are gross.\n\n2) Dan Dan noodles were standard. Much cheaper than Miu's though so that got them a star\n\n3) Spicy Lamb Ribs were a little weak.

From the moment I was seated, every minute or two someone approached me to take my order. I finally explained that this was my first time and that I needed to be left alone for a bit. Mission accomplished.

The Spinach was perfectly seasoned and cooked. A nice mild dish with lots of garlic aroma and flavor in a lovely light sauce. The Yangzhou Style fried rice was not like any other fried rice I have had before, and if I hadn't read the description carefully and seen the picture, I would have been confused by it. The shrimp and the chicken in the dish were particularly delicate, moist and delicious and clearly cooked to order. The roast pork was chopped into roughly 1/4 inch cubes, and the rice was mildly flavored and had a sort of melt in your mouth texture. I needed to add a bit of soy sauce to the dish, along with a small amount of hot oil for bite, but I ate as much of it as I could. The leftovers of both dishes reheated well at home in the microwave (loosely covered).\n\nAt no point did I lack for service, with servers constantly checking back with me.\n\nMy only disappointment was that I could not try everything I wanted to, including items from the \"Americanized\" menu - such as Egg Foo Yung - which I didn't go for this time because I was a little disappointed that the ingredients (peas, carrots, meat, whatever) are all served over the patties in brown sauce rather than inside of the patties. Only onion and bean sprouts are cooked in the patties. When I go back again, I'm going to go for it and see how I like it. It was also a bit pricey, but now that I've experienced the equality of other menu items, I'll spring for it.\n\nWhen I finished my meal and pushed my plates away, my check was brought immediately, along with take-out containers for my leftovers. The payment process went quickly, and soon I had my delicious left-overs in my car to smell all the way home.", "business_id": "yQONzVpX-DEpGSuKMIov6A", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-09-16", "type": "review"}

The place use to not have all that many customers, but today (Sunday) the place was very busy for lunch. Despite being busy, they took our orders very quickly and we were served in under 10 minutes.\nA problem that I had with Szechwan Palace in the past was that despite the price of around $10.00 for a plate (entr\u00e9e) the portions were small and kind of stingy. But today, was very different. The portions were large and everyone at our table of 5 was able to eat with contentment from all five of our orders; the flavor was really good in my opinion. Rice here is free which is a must for a spicy place. \nLastly, I'd like to say that I really enjoy ice water. Some places seem to be so stingy with their water. Today, four glasses. Awesome.\nI'll be now visiting this place regularly.\n\nMy favorite:\nC36. Yu Xiang Pork\nSliced pork stir-fried with wood ears, celery and bamboo shoots in yuxiang flavor (spicy)\nC50.

From the staff to the food, there is nothing to complain about. We love so many different dishes here, but if we have to narrow it down to 3 it is... extra spicy orange chicken, salt and pepper calamari, and the Szechwan shrimp.\n\nThe orange chicken is whole chicken breast that is breaded instead of little nuggets. You get more chicken than a ton of breading. The orange sauce is amazing, especially with some spice.\n\nThe salt and pepper calamari.. may not seem all that exciting or exotic, but it is delicious! I love the favors the green onions and jalape\u00f1o with the salt and pepper. \n\nOur newest favorite dish is the Szechwan shrimp. It is different from what I had growing up. I don't like szechwan anything, so I would have never given this dish a second glance. Of course one day, my friend ordered it and I just about died! I know I am pretty optimistic with my reviews, but I mean it, this dish is delicious and weirdly refreshing.

Less doughy and fluffy and chewy and more like a thin, flavorless, store bought, pre formed crust.  (And I'm sorry, but if you run a special for a $6 12\" pepperoni pizza and the customer asks for just cheese, why not drop the price a tiny smidge, considering that you aren't having to provide any pepperoni on their pizza?  Almost $23 for a small pizza, two dozen wings and one large Pepsi is kinda high.)\n\nThe wings also weren't up to par this visit.  They were badly overcooked, so much so that the drumsticks had all pulled away from the bone and shriveled into little balls of overcooked cooked chicken at the end of the drumstick.  (I can't think of any other way to describe it...)  I like my wings well cooked (like chicken jerky) but last night's wings were just ridiculously overcooked.  They were also woefully skimpy on the sauce, and too boot the butter that makes up the base for my beloved Long Wong's mild wing sauce was kinda off too.  It tasted a tad rancid.  Not enough to make me not eat the wings, but still I could tell it wasn't very fresh like it normally tastes.  It made me pretty sad.\n\nAdding to all that the damn Pepsi wasn't as rich and syrupy and delicious as normal.  This time I could CLEARLY taste the carbonated liquid underneath the Pepsi syrup, and the carbonation was the dominant flavor.  They obviously changed the ratio at the fountain drink dispenser.  (WTF??)\n\nOverall this visit was extremely disappointing.  EXTREMELY.  I am a huge Long Wong's fan, and I live right down the street so I tend to come here a lot, but after last night's visit I am not sure when or if I'll be back...\n\nLong Wong's Management, heed my words.  If a die-hard regular like me is contemplating finding another wing place, you need to take a good, hard look at what you've changed and CHANGE IT BACK.  Whatever penny pinching you did with the pizzas was NO BUENO.  Also, the stinginess on the wing sauce and the Pepsi mixture was not a good move either.  Those were THE things that we loved about your restaurant, and would come and brave the less-than-sparkling-clean conditions at your establishment to enjoy.  If you kill the food quality by skimping on cheese, using some crappy pizza crust, being stingy with wing sauce (ON WINGS!  The VERY THING you are known for!!  DO NOT TAMPER WITH A FAN FAVORITE!) and the syrup mixture on the fountain dispenser then there is almost no way I am braving that frenetic, overcluttered, hot ass mess of dining room restaurant to come back.  Normally I can ignore all that junk on the walls while I savor the delicious food, but now that the food isn't distracting me, I can hardly ignore the random junk dangling from the walls and ceiling.\n\nI am willing to bet you that others will agree here.  You may have saved a little on the ingredients that you just cheaped out on, but it'll cost you a ton in lost repeat business over time.  Penny wise, pound foolish.

The woman helping me was very polite and helped me pick out a few things from the Chinese menu. \n\nThe Singapore noodles were scrumptious and I ate the whole order by myself. \nThe green beans with XO sauce were also tasty, although plan to use those more as a side than an entree (and as a heads up, I do not think they are vegetarian, though one might assume them to be; I think there is some diced dried fish in the sauce making it YUMMY but not veggie).\n\nThe soup of the day was described as \"rehydrated bok Choi soup\". I'm not sure what that means, exactly, since when is bok choi DEhydrated anyway? I don't think she thought I'd like it because it was more of a traditional Chinese soup, but I loved it. It was very brothy with ultra-boiled greens, some unfamiliar mushroom or possibly dried plum thing, and (I think) boiled peanuts. The broth had a slightly sweet quality to it, similar to Pho broth. I'm not making the soup sound that good, but it was. Just try it. \n\nI had heard that the winter melon soup is great, but the woman told me that while occasionally they have it as a daily soup, usually you have to call a couple of days in advance to order it so they can prepare.\n\nI'm so glad I finally found a good neighborhood Chinese restaurant.", "business_id": "UxMnY3Dxafucv5cXHyfBSA", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-11-23", "type": "review"}

We also had a pan fried noodle dish of beef and tomatoes, which was pretty perfect. \n\nThey even have a few items you have to call a day in advance to order- a neighboring table had a large soup served in a gourd called Winter Melon Soup that looked and smelled divine. \n\nDon't miss this place.

Maybe it's a matter of taste in view of the other review on this page,  but we thought this place serves GREAT Chinese, with excellent attentive service and excellent prices, (although I'm used to LA prices and Phoenix is generally more economical across the board.)  We opted for  the fixed menu dinner, which we usually do not do, and the selections were very good.  The moo-shu pork was my favorite, although the rest of the dishes were also outstanding. There is a wonderful garlic chicken dish.  They put a little hibachi on the table so we could cook our own little skewers of beef.  We liked the very hearty soup. I did not notice any of the downside aspects noted in the other review.  The outside is not much to look at, just a rather plain free-standing building, but the interior decor is right out of the 50's, like the old style Cantonese places back then.  They play quiet Chinese music in the background, a nice touch that enhances the experience.  Plenty of parking and a bar if you like that sort of thing.  Thanks for a great evening, China Village !\n\nUDATE:  Dropped in again a few months later- just to see if the quality stayed up- and it was as good as before.  They even recognized us from months earlier.  We had the fixed menu dinner for six and they were very cooperative in making some changes based on our tastes.  Thanks again..

If you're looking for something more on the authentic side, you'll have to keep searching... but if you seek Americanized Chinese food, it's pretty good.  \n\nYour best bet is having one of their lunch specials which features an egg roll, a fried wonton, egg fried rice, plus entree for $7-8.  The portions for it are generous and the food is made to order and fresh.  I have also been to this establishment for dinner with a couple of my friends eating family style and everything we had was rather tasty.  \n\nAlthough the decor is outdated and reminds me of a stereotypical 80s Chinese restaurant, what they lack in decor they make up for in service.

It is the best non-dim sum Chinese food in central Phoenix, since the now long departed Silver Dragon (I think, off of Northern) closed. \n\nPan-fried noodles are excellent, so are mixed Chinese vegetables. This is the really nice feature for me: Desert Jade is incredibly accommodating about substitutions. I get shrimp,chicken,pork, beef combo with broccoli, but without the pork and beef, and substituting string beans for broccoli. This (and similar requests) never cause any sort of problem at Desert Jade. Hot tea is loose leaf, no tea bags, which is another positive for me.\n\nMy companion Mr. Super Spicy gets his usual gin-and-tonic and says it is adequate. He assures me that dishes marked for spiciness are indeed up to his standards, and that beef with broccoli is decent, with lean but tender meat. He likes the pork fried rice (LOTS of pork) and says egg foo yung is good too. Wor Wan Ton soup is full of tasty morsels, not merely thin broth and droopy noodles.\n\nThe ambiance at Desert Jade is a bit odd, it's very comfortable, mind you, but more like a hunting lodge than any Chinese restaurant I've ever seen. Clean forest green velvet upholstered booths, diamond shaped mullioned windows, scenes of pheasants and grouse, etc.  The bar near the front entrance is charming, and more traditional. Also, this restaurant is open until 9:30pm, quite unusual for Phoenix dining!", "business_id": "m9Wqqma30o-hH2fAX7dnug", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-10-19", "type": "review"}

In fact Ive been coming here before I even knew I was coming here.  Let me explain:\n\nWhen I was wee tike and living in Michigan I came to visit my grandparents once a year in Scottsdale.  My grandfather used to take us to this Chinese restaurant because it was his favorite.   For at least two decades after he passed my mother and I scoured the valley because we could not remember the name or area it was in.  It wasn't until recently that I raved about this place and took my parents here that my mother gasped, for she remembered every detail about it.  Lo and behold it was Desert Jade.  Not only my grandfathers favorite Chinese joint in the entire valley but mine as well.  \n\nDesert Jade is legitimate.  They care about their customers and have been around for decades in a small place that is not particularly easy to park in.  Yet its always packed and for very good reason.  I love you Desert Jade and will continue to eat here every opportunity I can.  Thanks for the memories.", "business_id": "m9Wqqma30o-hH2fAX7dnug", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-10-17", "type": "review"}

How did I not discover this place before? So I was in my office and had a wicked craving for Chinese food. But the only place I knew of was Panda Express on 40th and Thomas... I'd rather eat my shoe with siracha than that panda. So I turned to the break room to see what fliers or menus were posted on the cork board... And Lo an behold ... Desert Jade. \nIt was not far at all doe my office and said what the hell I'll try it out. Drove over and liked that it was quiet and quaint. Not to over the top with typical Chinese restaurant decor... I couldn't find any Buddha statues or that annoying waving cat that you can't help but poke it's paw. It was very relaxed and cozy. \nImmediately they brought out water and hot tea... The hot tea by itself with no sugar is awsome. Not sure what kind of tea it is, green maybe or ginger, don't know don't care, it was good. \nThe lunch menu is very inexpensive and very plentiful portions. I ordered the sweet and sour pork with fried rice. It was very rich in flavor for a classic lunch time go to. The fried rice was simple and didn't have crazy extras like bamboo shoots or bean sprouts. Two hearty scoops of fried rice and an egg roll plus my swee and sowa pohkk ... Great food and very hearty portions and left with a bill less than $10 with tip. Can't get that at panda, and unlike Panda, it didn't do the express blowout 30 minutes later in the office bathroom.

It was neither. \n\nI do like that they serve passion fruit China Mist iced tea there. I probably drank a gallon of it during the course of the meal. Though, that might've had something to do with that salty lo mein too. \n\nI am not ready to give up on Super Dragon yet . I would like to go back some day and try that duck.

Seriously, I am wondering if it is some kind of joke.  I ordered delivery from this restaurant, the delivery was executed by a courier service, the order took roughly one hour.  I ordered vegetarian spring rolls, and a green vegetable stir fry.  We are used to seeing spring rolls delivered in what our Asian grocery stores sells as, \"spring roll wrappers,\" made from rice paper.  I did not intend to order fried, greasy mess rolls.  These were friend in either old oil or oil that was far too hot, they were significantly darkened.  Judging by the amount of residual oil, the oil was old and not up to temp.  According to the menu description of the green vegetable stir fry, \"the name says it all.\"  We'll, that's clearly a lie because the name didn't tell me it would be awful.  The dish as delivered was a limp pile of bok choy (wouldn't have ordered if it were only bok choy)...seriously...no scallions, onion, carrot, or any other veg besides the bok choy. The veg was limp and gross, topped in bits of garlic with absolutely no flavor.  There was a little sauce, I am not sure what it was made from and I am a very serious cook, my guess would be oil, freezer concentrate and some boxed thickener.  These were seriously not seasoned at all and my toothpaste packs a better flavor.  On the side were fried rice and low mein noodles, it's just slightly weird to get rice AND noodles, both of which were dreadful.  The rice was unseasoned and lacked vegetables, the noodles had no hint of flavor and no crispness in the veg that might give it some texture.  Nothing was seasoned or flavorful- I poured everything they sent me to try to help it out, this went badly.  There was a tempura shrimp and crab Rangoon on the side, I didn't eat it because I am a vegetarian, but they looked and smelled awful, it wouldn't surprise me if someone became ill after eating them.  The Rangoon was definitely previously frozen, and the shrimp probably made it from the freezer with no pit stops to the fryer judging by the coating.  I literally thought this might have been a joke when my fortune cookie ( generic made by the Kari-Out-Co) lacked fortunes, and I am not making that up.  \n\nThis place definitely needs a health inspection, and probably needs to be closed.  I really feel bad if locals eat here, please try Chinese food in coastal California, Houston or northeastern cities because you will easily see the difference. Overall, this was just epically bad.

We've also tried their chow fun, seafood soup, sizzling rice soup, mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, house fried rice, crab puffs, wonton soup, and I can't think of the others - we haven't left disappointed with one dish just yet.  \n\nThough this Chinese restaurant charges more than your most ma/pa restaurants, it's still a pretty good deal considering how good the food is.\n\nService is not bad at all.  They all are Chinese therefore have a very thick accent, but it's still understandable.  They are prompt and check on you often.  I am definitely a fan of this place!", "business_id": "aozcOaCMwOHG8s-lbZ6_gA", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-10-13", "type": "review"}

We have been back 4 times since! When we are in the mood to go and sit and relax and enjoy a nice Chinese meal - this is where we go. \n\nThe place is definitely dated, but it has it's charm. Its \"Flamingo Palace\", so of course it has to be pink. And it definitely is. It takes me back to various Chinese Restaurants we frequented as a kid in the 80's, so there's some comfy nostalgia to go with your Chinese comfort food. \n\nEvery time we go, we are greeted and seated promptly and by the same two people, a young hostess/busser and then a woman whom we believe to be the owner. Overhearing some other restaurant patrons, \"she is always here\". \n\nThough the place does seem a bit dated and not much effort has been put into updates, you can tell everyone takes pride in their service and the food. We always order the potstickers, and she always politely reminds us that they are cooked to order and will take 15 minutes. We don't care, they are delicious and Zach will often keep the dipping sauce to use on the rest of his meal - it's that good. \n\nWe also always order the Flamingo Palace Special Chicken - it's also just that good. Then we get a variety of other things based on mood. We have really never been disappointed with what we have ordered, but we don't branch out that much here either. I wouldn't say this place is all that different in preparation of the common dishes, not to call it 'basic', but it definitely ranks higher in the quality and freshness category in comparison to many of their competitors here in the Valley that serve stale, old, soggy food. \n\n(One tid-bit of constructive crticism - the dining room could use a regualr dusting and maybe even a spot-painting of the walls. It's not nasty, but I could see how many could be really put off on returning.)\n\nWe appreciate you Flamingo Palace!", "business_id": "aozcOaCMwOHG8s-lbZ6_gA", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-09-05", "type": "review"}

I thought to myself:  How could you have missed this place with great food when I don't live that far from it?  \nWell, I shall start by forgiving my fellow Yelpers who think this is great chinese food.  You are forgiven, my brethren.  \nAs a former East Coaster who has had the taste of REAL chinese food, I have to break it to you.....THIS IS NOT IT.  \nThe egg drop soup was tasteless which means that a good broth was not developed to create a good soup.  With any good soup,  the base is what makes it.  Plus it was too clumpy from the cornstarch.  \nThe combination dinner which consisted of orange chicken, an egg roll and \"fried\" rice was a total disappointment.  Orange chicken was nothing more than dough around pieces of chicken with no orange flavor.  They put a few pieces of orange rind as a costume for the chicken.  But even on Halloween night,  this plain-old chicken knows it is not orange chicken.     The egg roll, while not greasy, had little flavor and the veggies inside had no crunch.  The frozen egg rolls I buy from Chung Kung are tastier---really.  The \"fried\" rice.... anyone notice that I put quotation marks around the word fried???? All you English majors probably noticed it.   This cannot be called fried rice.  They took a large batch of cooked, white rice, saut\u00e9ed it with soy sauce and put it in a holding tank waiting for some sucker to order their combination dinner which comes with \"fried\" rice.  Then, they scoop out a half a cup of the stuff and fling it on the plate along with the other mediocre part of the combo.  Does this sound a little harsh or angry?  Yup, I'm angry that we ordered something called orange chicken with FRIED rice and this so called fried rice is an insult to the palate.  Do they think that we think this is what fried rice tastes like?  Do they think we (by we I mean anyone who steps foot into that restaurant) are ignorant consumers? \nI order the monogolian beef which had a good taste but you needed to have your incisors working perfectly to chew through the meat.  Glad I was at the dentist a few days ago and my incisors are in great shape.  \nLadies and gentlemen of the Yelping Community:  This is NOT good chinese food.

There is a sign at the beginning of the buffet lecturing you to eat everything you take, which I didn't see until after I had gone through once and had a small mound of dry, dry, dry fried rice on my plate that I didn't touch more than twice.  It really wasn't good.  The hot and sour soup was also a pass.  It tasted like nothing - just spicy and bland.  I added some soy sauce but it didn't help.\n\nSeveral other items made up for this though.  The sesame chicken was GOOD, still crispy somehow, and white meat, really sticky.  I enjoyed it, even if it seemed more like a crispy honey chicken to me.  The fried fish was also good, they had some tartar sauce at the end of the line.  I liked the teryaki chicken with its sauce, and the lo mein (why are people saying it's spam? it was definitely chicken).  The fries were also great, clearly homemade but good and crispy.

It was bad enough that if there had been people sitting around us I would have left. Luckily, the side we were on only had one other table of people who were wrapping up as we got there. Even when he was screaming maniacally, when the staff walked by, they smiled at him. They also slipped him a baloon. \n\nThe buffet is small with a limited selection. Nothing was bad. The sesame chicken I got was pretty greasy, but based on other reviews of it being really good, I'm willing to chalk it up to being a bad batch due to the oil being too cool since the orange chicken was not greasy. The sweet and sour pork was very lightly coated before cooking which made it different than most places.

It's back in the corner of a shady looking strip mall, which doesn't exactly draw you in. The restaurant itself is decorated with rather gaudy, gold and red decorations, complete with red paper lanterns.  Although I don't come here for the atmosphere, I wish one of these days they'd put a sound system in and play some background music. Despite the less-than-elegant decor, this restaurant has a certain charm to it.\n\nI've been coming here with my family for about 20 years and it's still my restaurant of choice for Chinese food. The egg rolls and crab puffs are pretty tasty, but my favorite appetizer is the egg drop soup. It's thick, flavorful and I have yet to find a rival anywhere. Great dishes include the Mongolian beef, cashew chicken and house special chicken. Americans everywhere have their favorite, must order Chinese food dish and I'm willing to bet you'll find a pleasant version of it at Dragon Palace. \n\nThe best time to go is at lunch! It's quick and cheap. Their lunches, which come with a generous helping of your choice of dish (say kung pao chicken), rice, egg roll, 2 wontons and either egg drop or wonton soup are less than $6, most around $5. If you're REALLY on a budget, order a bowl of egg drop soup for only $1. \n\nThe only thing you can't get at lunch time is their after-dinner, Banana Caramel Delights! They drop one off for each person with the check.This isn't the actual name for them, but as they are complimentary and not on the menu, I'm not sure what they are called. They are basically banana filled crispy wonton wrappers that are then coated in a crunchy, sugary, caramel coating. If you like bananas and sweet things, you'll love these! \n\nIf you're craving Chinese food, stop and eat here or pick up a to-go order and eat it in whatever environment you choose!", "business_id": "lAGDe38li38fyf971CslFg", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-09-03", "type": "review"}

My good friend and I look on Yelp to find a new Chinese restaurant to eat at and decide to try Dragon Palace based on these ratings, but this place is nowhere near as good as it's rated here.

But looking at people's dishes on the way to our table, I could see the food was not going to be anything special. Turns out Dragon Palace is a bottom-rung Chinese restaurant: dirty plates, RUSTY teapots, sub-par ingredients, frozen vegetables, canned mushrooms, weak sauces, and the cheapest quality of fatty, gristly meats...It was so bad I sent my dinner back and asked for a refund.

Fresh, flavorful, and priced right.  \n\nMy husband and I were sans children, and wanted something close to home, but different than our usual haunts.  Based on the Yelp reviews, I decided to give Dragon Palace a try.  \n\nWhat a great find!  I have seen this place before, when at the Quiltz shop at the end of the little strip center.  I am glad to try any hole in the wall or oddball place, but having had too much bad Chinese in the past, will usually not try one unless it comes with a recommendation by someone.  \n\nHot tea and ice water arrived immediately.  We ordered 2 Dragon Dinner Specials- I the Almond Chicken, my husband the Mongolian Beef.  Evil, delicious little crunchy fried wonton strips showed up after we placed the order.\n\nThe Wor-Wonton soup arrived first- hot, and delicious. Beautiful clean shrimp were so flavorful, and the veggies and wontons were perfect.  \n\nThe eggrolls were crisp and fresh.  The chicken drumette was crisp and flavorful. \n\nOur entrees were so good, reminding me of the old fashioned Chinese restaurants I went to with my parents in late 60's-early 70's.  (Anyone remember Toy's Shangri La??)     \n\nService was pleasant and non-obtrusive.\n\nHere's an observation I made:  there was NO HINT of anything that had been frozen and added back into any dish.  I hate it when places do this!\n\nThe only downside was that we got NO banana wonton desserts!  I think it was because we arrived around 8:15 and they closed at 9, and were closing up the kitchen.  Now we HAVE to go back so we can try some other entrees and those little sweet morsels.", "business_id": "lAGDe38li38fyf971CslFg", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-09-05", "type": "review"}

It's is a thrown back into the late seventies and early eighties with huge red vinyl booths with the high backs.  The walls are solid blue (I guess as a contrast maybe?) with some Asian inspired borders and prints.  They have those old Asian lamps hanging for the ceiling.  Although this place is a through back into time of another era, the place is very clean and comfy.  \n\nService~ excellent from when you enter their restaurant until you leave.  5 star service.\n\nFood~ all of their lunch meals come with water and hot tea, complimentary.  They also offer the usual beverage choices if you so desire something else.  The hot tea was very good!  \n\nTheir menu is also a through back to old Asian restaurants I used to go to when I was a kid.  I remember when mom would say \"we are going to go and eat Chinese\" and I would say \"mom, we're not cannibals do you mean Asian or Chinese food?\"  \n\nAfter a slap on the back of the head we were off ~ ready to get stuffed since they always brought you way too much food.\n\nAll of their lunch meals here at the Dragon Palace come with a very tasty bowl of egg drop soup (thick and tasty!), wontons, egg roles, rice is fried or steamed  and the main entree.  We had their Beef with Broccoli and their Mongolian Beef.  Both dishes were China-licious!!  Our entire meal was less than $20 with the tip!\n\nI'm looking forward to going \"Back in Time\" at he Dragon Palace again real soon.
