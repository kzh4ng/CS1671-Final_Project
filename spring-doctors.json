I love my doctor, Dr Colbert, she is absolutely amazing.  I have built a great relationship with her and she is the only reason I am not leaving this establishment. Someone on the reception staff took it upon themselves, WITHOUT my authorization, to change my phone number to a number that has never been associated with me. Because my phone number was changed without my authorization or knowledge it had happened, I wasn't informed that an appointment I had scheduled for 2 months and took off work for needed to be rescheduled because my doctor was sick. Today, when I went into the office and was glad finally able to see my doctor, I noticed on my check-in paperwork they had a different doctor listed, not my usual doctor that I have always seen and who is my primary care provider. I made sure after my first appointment with my doctor that I would always be scheduled with her and put that in my paperwork  so I'd always see her. Again, someone on the reception staff took it upon themselves to schedule me with another doctor against my wishes, without my authorization, and without my knowledge. I'm not sure if the same person who changed my phone number also changed my doctor, or if the receptionist who rescheduled my appointment put me with the wrong doctor. I realize that mistakes happen, it just seems odd to me that I have never had these types of issues at any other medical establishment, ever, especially when there is so much at risk with the medical industry and patient privacy etc.  Either way, I had to reschedule again and will have to miss work again because of the reception staff at this establishment.

In need of a prescription and not having much time to find a doctor,  I made an appointment with Dr. Stephens.  The woman I spoke to on the phone was Terry.  Terry's attitude through the entire phone call was snappy. She cut me off every time I started to speak.  I assumed she was just really busy and didn't let that sway my opinion.  \n\nAppointment day arrives.  I walked into the office and felt like I had entered into my early  90s doctor's office.  Awful old chairs,  the decor was terrible,  and the fluorescent lighting was so bright it hurt my eyes.  I signed in and was given the usual paperwork.  As I'm trying to listen to Terry to see what exactly I'm supposed to fill out,  there are a few people in the waiting area laughing and carrying on a conversation.  It made it extremely hard to hear what Terry was saying.  When I asked her if she could repeat herself she rolled her eyes and sighed.  Oh yeah,  god forbid you have to explain something twice.  \n\nI didn't have to wait too long for the nurse,  about 5 minutes.  I believe her name was Gail,  she was very nice... however, when I was trying to speak to her she also cut me off and spoke over me. The exam room I was in had posters taped to the wall,  it didn't appear dirty,  just kind of slapped together like a dorm room. \n\nEnter Dr. Stephens... she kind of spoke with me about my history,  and then launched into a lecture about me not having insurance. Excuse me,  no matter how well intentioned your speech may be,  it's inappropriate.  You do not know the specific circumstances surrounding my situation. It made me really uncomfortable.... now,  I've had some health problems before,  so having a vaginal exam is not only extremely uncomfortable,  but I'm always anxious during it.  Her lecturing me made me feel even more anxious.  As she started the exam it was VERY,  VERY uncomfortable, and I was trying to convey that to her and she said the standard, \"If you would just RELAX,  this wouldn't be so bad\" and then pushed my leg out of her way.  Thank you for totally disregarding the fact that I'm so anxious I'm drenched in sweat... and thanks for ignoring that I'm trying to voice my state of discomfort by just talking over me.  \n\nI was so glad it was over.  When I went to pay I had to go to Terry. Funny,  when she was taking my payment she was remarkably pleasant.  \n\nIf I have to have any further testing or treatments I'll be going somewhere else.  This place just made me feel so uncomfortable.\n\n***Went to pick up my prescription today,  Dr. Stephens prescribed the wrong pill.  Which is hilarious because in the exam room when I was trying to tell her,  \"It's XYZ, and I think it's this dosage,  but I'm not 100% sure,  it's in my records....\" she cut me off acting like she knew exactly what pill I was taking.

Everyone in the waiting room was called before I was and I wasn't even seeing my actual Dr, I was assigned a PA instead.  I did the usual Urine sample, and they took my blood and vitals but the PA kept asking me questions I already answered to the nurse which made me notice she wasn't even looking at my file nor had it with her, she was just taking notes on the Patient info sheet I filled out.  She breezed through a low quality ultrasound and I had to ask her for pics which were blurry and barely even worth printing when I saw them.  She explained that I would be going to a different facility in 2 weeks for the ultrasound and then go back to their office for the check up which I wasn't happy about having to go to multiple places but understood.  When she finished I had to ask her about the results of the UA since I told her I felt like I may have a UTI, she told me everything looked fine but they would have to send it out to get those results (I've never heard of not getting UTI results the same day) and that she would just send a script for an antibiotic to my pharmacy which would be ready when I left there and that they would call in a couple days and tell me the results and I could stop taking them if they were negative.  I waited until the next day to go to the Pharm and no script was sent, I called the OBGYN and explained there was supposed to be a script for an antibiotic and they said they would send it over. the next day the pharm called to tell me my script for prenatal was ready but that was all that was sent. I didn't even ask for prenatals since they're over the counter!!!! called the DR AGAIN and had it sent over, still no call from the Dr regarding my results but I thought I would wait another day.  still a week later and 3 calls asking for my results and I had to call THEM to find out that the results had been in and are negative but the PA must have overlooked needing to call and let me know.  I have requested my file and am switching to Maricopa OBGYN, I'm very disappointed in my first prenatal Dr visit as this should be a happy time and your doctor should make you feel comfortable, I hope Maricopa can turn this around and make it a positive experience for me as it should be.", "business_id": "1acmBPmmFDovVSHHzMrJ9A", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-04-09", "type": "review"}

I was referred to Southwest Women's Care by a friend who was very impressed by the Ahwatukee office location and staff. This being my second pregnancy, I was prepared for the lengthy initial paperwork, long office waits, and moody receptionists; however, I was not at all prepared for complete and utter incompetence. I left my initial visit feeling ok with my OB selection, but in all honesty, I wasn't super impressed with the doctors or staff.  I rationalized the lackluster feelings as pregnancy hormones and made follow up appointments.  If my friend raved so much about them then how bad could they be? I went through my new patient information packet and realized the PA who examined me failed to provide me a due date. Wow! Completely unbelievable! Everyone knows it's one of the most important components of the initial visit. I was able to figure it out using a pregnancy calculator but I couldn't believe the miss. \n\nDuring my visit I also set the expectation I would need FMLA paperwork filled out by 5/29/13--I stressed the importance of the forms and deadlines. The person assisting me said that my deadline wouldn't be an issue and assured me she would personally complete the forms if needed. Well, when I called this morning (5/29/13) to see if the forms were completed the receptionist seemed uninterested in my situation and chose to inform me they had \"7- 10 business days to complete any and all medical forms . . .\" to which I responded \"that is not what I was told at my visit and I need those forms as soon as possible.\" She told me she would check into it and call me back. \n \nThe receptionist did provide a prompt follow up call to let me know that they would be making an exception for my forms. She set the expectation that I would be able to pick them up after the office lunch break and left it at that. I was pleased with the quick response and went to pick up my forms as soon as I could. When I got to the office the front desk could not locate my paperwork and the lengthy wait time left little time for me to double check the forms. Imagine my dismay when I got back to my office to discover the forms were filled out completely incorrect.  There were contradictories, wrong information, and misspellings galore.  There is absolutely no way a medical professional could have completed the documents. When I checked the back signature, sure enough, it was different from the rest of hand writing on the forms.  I am completely appalled that a doctor or physicians assistant would sign off on forms without insuring they were filled out appropriately. \n\nThere is no way I would let someone who can't even take the time to make sure basic documents are completed properly deliver my child.  An expectant mother needs someone who pays attention to details. If this is how they handle the little parts of pregnancy then I don't even want to think about how they handle the bigger parts.

The facility is clean. My annual exams usually went fine and I was in and out in a reasonable amount of time. \n\nI had an abnormal pap smear for my first time this year and had to come back in for a colposcopy and cervical biopsy. After a week of anxiously awaiting my results, I got a voicemail from the RNC I saw telling me \"I have your results, please call me back and tell them to track me down personally so I can speak with you.\" I called back and they told me she'd just gone into an exam room and that they'd have her call me right back in 10 minutes. An hour and a half passed and I was really starting to let the nerves get to me.. so I called back. Her assistant said she just went into another exam room and she'd call me back. So I waited. \n\nFour hours pass and no call. Finally, I call back a third time and was able to speak with Ms. Scrivner, the RNC who performed my colposcopy and left the message. What she told me was \"You have high-grade cervical cell changes so you DEFINITELY need to get in here for a LEEP procedure, I'll transfer you to scheduling\" Click. That was it. Scheduling picks up and had no idea what was going on--they even asked ME if I needed to schedule a consult or the actual procedure--excuse me, but isn't it the provider's job to know these things?\n\nAnyway, I got the consult scheduled. I knew absolutely nothing about my condition, all I had was the information of \"high grade cervical cell changes\" and how urgently I needed LEEP. The next day I left a message for the nurse triage explaining my situation and telling them I need more info about my results and to give me a call back. The nurse called back and was horribly rude and condescending. She snapped at me that \"these are precancerous cells that are going to turn into cancer unless you come in here and get the LEEP.\" Out of despair and worry I asked if there were any other options. She snapped back at me again, saying, \"These are cells that will turn into CANCER. You CANNOT sit around and do nothing and NO there is nothing else that can be done because the infected tissue will spread and infect more until you have full-blown cancer.\" That was the extent of information I got about my test results, and simply trying to get more information about my condition so I don't give myself an ulcer worrying about it. Of course I had the words \"these cells will turn into CANCER\" rolling around in my head for days, which was pretty emotionally crippling to be honest. \n\nI was so distraught with the way the triage nurse had spoken to me and how rude, condescending, and cold she was, I started looking into different OBGYNs. I called Southwest to request my records be released so I could bring them to my new doctor. I requested only the past 2 years of records, and they were able print them and give them to me in about fifteen minutes. I decided I wanted all of my records, so I went back in and they told me it'd be $15 and they'd call me when the records were ready for pick up. Fine, I understand. Nine days pass and no call. I call back and they tell me anything before 2009 is in storage and they'd have to physically get it, which \"takes time\". I sure wish someone would have told me that instead of letting me sit around for nine days wondering what's going on.. So I told her it's fine, just give me anything you have on hand. She agreed she'd print everything from 2010 on and call me within 2 days to pick them up. It's now been two weeks, Southwest has never called about my records. The only call I've received is them telling me I owe them more money, despite already being sent an invoice and paying for the colposcopy/biopsy that was performed. I asked why they didn't include all of the charges on the invoice they sent and they didn't have an answer.\n\nWhen the time came that I did have abnormal results, the staff and especially the triage nurse were exceptionally unhelpful and rude--they couldn't even provide me the most basic information about my condition. I took my two years of records to my new doctor, who is an MD by the way (never once saw an MD at Southwest) and she took one look at the biopsy, sat me down, and explained everything that was going on. I don't know why nobody at Southwest could do this for me. feel much more comfortable and confident in my new OBGYN's care. My new OBGYN informed me that I did have other options, I guess Southwest just didn't want to offer them to me. I'm upset I didn't make the switch earlier. Long story short, I think Southwest is more concerned with money and getting people in and out without actually giving a damn about the patients themselves.

I am no exception. There's nothing like spreading eagle in front of somebody you just met, who may or may not know what \"gentle fingers\" really means. (Uhm, yeah right.)\n\nAlas, the search for a great M.D. or OBGYN is one of those exasperating yet essential quests in every woman's life. \n\nSo, imagine my disdain when - newly located to Phx - I had to strike out to find a female MD I didn't want to strangle. \n\nLuckily, luck was on my side. \n\nAfter searching for who was covered by my insurance (on their handy-dandy Web site), I found this place - Central Phoenix Women's Health Care Center - and was introduced to Dr. Susan Morton-Pradhan. \n\nI had no idea what to expect. It's like calling a salon and hearing the name of somebody you never met, who could royally f*ck up your hair. But, there's only one way to find out...\n\nThe Center itself is located in a 3-store office-type building on the South side of Osborn, just shy of Central. You are welcomed by grey walls, stale carpeting, a dingy elevator you fear is going to malfunction at any given moment. Yikes. The Center staff is terse, unwelcoming and standoffish. They seem a tad disorganized, having thought my appointment was for something else and demanded I pee in a cup, just after I had rushed to \"empty the pipeline.\" So, I had to drink 17.5 of their half-sized cups of water-cooler water, trying to entice an encore. That's when they ushered me back through the waiting area and said, \"Oh, we don't need a sample... But you can give us one if you want.\" D'oh! \n\nOh, whatever; they do their job. You fill out paper. You sign-in. You wait. You get weighed. You know, the usual. I can deal with shitty staff, so long as my Doctor is the Patron Saint of Gyno.\n\nNow that Dr. Susan Morton-Pradhan has gone to another place, I can review this Center for what it is: A place for women to go when they need their annual screenings, as well as when there happens to be a bun in the oven. (Oops, how did that happen?) \n\nLucky for me, I have no reason to go back, considering my Doctor relocated and, by god!, I'm following her.

Honestly- I think of Yelp when we want food or fun- it really had not occurred to me that medical PROFESSIONALS would have scores of negative reviews on here.  It sure does now after my experience at TOCA.  As with many of my Yelp reviews- I have blogged my entire experience in full for anyone that is inclined to read more than the 5000 character limit that Yelp provides you can do that here:\nhttps://gerouxcrew.wordpress.com/2015/04/08/run-for-the-hills/\n\nPros: They took my insurance (Health Net PPO), they had an appointment within a few days (while others I called were booking weeks out) , I had two friends that saw a specific doctor at Toca for a similar ailment as mine and both of them had good experiences.\n\nCons: I could not get in with the Doc my friends experienced so settled for Dr Zoltan.  Had to go to Tempe where their office parking situation is a complete nightmare. An appointment is just a suggested time for when you will be seen- but if you are late they will cancel and bill you. (one thing I loathe about medical establishments)- in my case my appointment was later than it was supposed to be because an older gentleman came in without an appointment and they \"squeezed him in before me being taken back *RED FLAG!\n\nOffice staff: When calling to make my appointment they were ok- when I checked in one lady was super nice and when we left the appointment they were on top of wanting to \"help\" but it was far too late at that point.\n\nDoctor Zoltan: rude, rushed, condescending and disengaged.  We brought MRI images with us to my appointment (I had injured my knee a week prior while doing a fun run obstacle course event--Urgent care X-rays were clean but MRI done by Simon Med was showing that I had a completely torn ACL and  2nd degree MCL tear this is why I was seeking out an orthopedic doctor)  Doctor spent about 3 minutes in the exam room with us, manipulated my knee for a few seconds and then left to read the MRI and report.  When he came back he said he did not think my MCL was torn because I was not showing pain the way he felt I should be showing it a week out from the injury.  He then said my ACL is torn but not completely and is likely a tear I had long before this injury and was just unaware of it. (???really?? that is interesting) Doc wants to do \"aggressive therapy\" and check me in a few months but no surgery at this time- I had to pretty much beg him to stop from walking out the door so I could ask 2 quick questions both he replied with \"yup and sure\" as responses as he was walking away- he then did a little point of his finger and wink at my husband and was gone.  Total direct time with Doctor for this orthopedic consultation was less than five minutes.  PT came in and fitted me for a brace (which I had to request-that was one of my 2 questions) so at least I did get SOMETHING out of this appointment.  Nurse informed us Doc wanted to see me again in 4 weeks and I made it abundantly clear that we would not be returning.  Both the nurse and PT were totally not phased by my remarks or by my husband stating that we felt very poorly cared for at this visit and for the most part they just shrugged us off with forced sympathetic smiles and left the room. Total time from when the doctor walked in to the exam room to when we were leaving the building was 23 minutes which included him reviewing my MRI images, and me getting fitted for a brace.\n\nI will be seeking out another opinion (technically a 4th opinion at this point since both the MRI imaging Xray Tech and Urgent Care doctor read my images differently than Dr Zoltan- who didn't even take the time to explain what he did see or did not see in the MRI when he looked at it.\n\nAfter reading the other reviews on here about the lack of thorough patient care and attentiveness- everything I experienced seems to be pretty typical at this office.  I strongly urge others to seek care elsewhere.", "business_id": "oZdqBEQLwl85jEQKL6XMPQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-04-08", "type": "review"}

He then proceeded and was unusually rough in the manner he completed the rest of the procedure.  Once Dr. Perkins was done, I sat up and was escorted to the post-op room where I was crying and beside myself in the experience and pain with Dr. Perkins.  I explained what had happened to the technician and proceeded to check out.  I not only experienced a tremendous amount of pain in comparison to the first procedure done by him but tremendous pain after.  It is my belief that Dr. Perkins did not allow the numbing drops enough time to take effect before proceeding nor did he have the care and concern for the matter.  I am disgusted by his unprofessionalism and the pain he put me through.  It has been 5 weeks since the procedure and it appears that my vision was affected by his poor quality work as my vision is worse now than it was 5 weeks after my first procedure and prior to this second procedure.  I do not believe this doctor should be practicing on such a delicate sense and lacks any compassion and bedside manner.\n\nIt really is such a shame to have dealt with Dr. Perkins because I have had a great experience leading up to surgery.  Dr. Schiff is the pre and post op doctor that has been such a pleasure to deal with.  He is very warm and informative just like the rest of his administrative staff.  After my experience that night, I received a call from their branch manager wanting to address the issue.  She stated she would send me a gift card as some type of consolation.  Three weeks later, nothing.  I sent her an email to verify the address she had for me and after no response a week later, I called her and she said that she sent it to me after we first spoke.  Yeah, maybe it got lost with her response to my email.  Another week, she receives a return on the mailing and realizes that she had the wrong address.  I get the $20 gift card with a note stating, \"Here is another gift card.\"  I was very offended.  She would have gotten a return on the first one since she sent it to the same wrong address IF she in fact did send it the first time.  I was initially impressed by the way K.D. tried to mitigate but then offended in the result.  This is a $4,000 procedure and I suffered a great deal of pain for a $20 gift card that required my constant follow-up.\n\nPlease note, I do recommend Dr. Schiff to inform and prep you for the surgery and his administrative staff, just please ensure you do not get scheduled for surgery with Dr. Perkins.", "business_id": "4R8uKEIwTVzHGLa3Edub0Q", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-03-14", "type": "review"}

I went to Dr. Kwark for the first 5 months of my first pregnancy and it was probably the worst experience of my life. As I said it is my FIRST pregnancy so... maybe for people on baby 3 or 4 she might be a good choice but for me it was awful. She never explained ANYTHING that was happening or that she was doing to me. I never even got information on what I could eat! I had a really really rough start and she never tried to work out what was wrong or help me in any way. She would make vague statements about things being abnormal or odd and I should see this or that specialist and set me to panicking, take mystery blood tests that I never knew what were for or what the results were, and then when I would ask on the next visit she would not even remember correctly... I think she got me mixed up with some of her other clients a few times. She never spent more than a few minutes with me and pretty much avoided any sort of eye contact the whole time. When I filed for intermittent FMLA it took almost 3 weeks to get the paperwork back, the staff in front is extremely rude, and when I started contracting and spotting at 20 weeks I called the overnight emergency service- the Dr. on call took 3 hours to call me back and then could not speak very good english, asked if the baby was still moving (at 20 weeks?... OK) and then said he would have Dr. Kwark contact me the next day. I called 3 times the next day- the first time I was told no message was passed on and to call back, when I called back she was various degrees of busy and would get back to me. I never received a call back and ended up in the hospital because I had NO idea what was going on and was panicking. I ended up seeing 4 different specialists in the time that I was seeing Dr. Kwark before I saw a General Practitioner that explained what was going on, the terms she had been using, said it sounded like she wanted zero responsibility and recommended I get a different OB. Wouldn't you know I'm still sick (thank goodness only a few weeks left) but now I know what is happening with my body and I only have to see 1 Dr. What a concept. This place is a money mill... that is all. Get as many people in and out in a short amount of time as possible.

My husband and I arrived there at 7:30 PM last evening. I was being seen to rule out the possibility of a blood clot in my leg or lung. They asked  me to do the usual registration and things of that nature which I completed in about ten minutes.\n\nWe then sat down and waited for an hour before we were called back to triage. The nurse that was there was friendly.My vitals were taken and I rated my pain about a six on a scale of one through ten. Next, she corrected some mistakes on my list of allergies which were entered incorrectly from my last visit. This is where things went downhill.\n\nShe placed us in another waiting room. At first glance, there were only about four people ahead of me. As such, I reclined my wheelchair and started doing various things on my phone. An hour went by an not a single person was called from the waiting room.  We just figured that they had a critical patient and things would start moving shortly. Unfortunately, we thought wrong! Yet another hour passed and not a single patient was called back to a bed.\n\nAt this point, it is now 10:30 PM and two of the patients (one of whom was having chest pain) decided to leave and seek other hospitals. I told my husband that if I was placed in an E.R. room by 11:00 PM, we were leaving as well. The triage nurse heard this an assured us that I would be the next person taken back.\n\nThirty one minutes later, I was taken back to a room. My husband turned on the TV and we waited for the doctor. A half hour later, the doctor comes in and says that by looking at me, she doesn't think I have a blood clot. I explain to her that just seven days ago my cardiologist told me I had a superficial blood clot in my left leg, and that I was advised to go to the ER if my pain increased or I  had any swelling or redness.\n\nI explained to her that my pain was worse, and I needed to make sure the clot had not moved to a deeper vein and become more serious. She hesitantly agreed to do an ultrasound of only my left leg. Keep in mind both legs are usually examined in order to compare. Furthermore, she stated that if it moved to my lung, I would need a CT Scan, and just because the leg ultrasound was benign does not mean it did not move.\n\nThey did my ultrasound at about 12AM. The doctor came back to my room about 1:15 AM and said the ultrasound was negative for a clot of any kind. Rather than moving on and checking my lungs, she said I was discharged. This frustrated me a lot because if for some reason the clot did move to my chest, it could be deadly.  My husband and myself explained this to her, but it fell on deaf ears.\n\nMy discharge instructions were plain and simple, elevate my leg to decrease the swelling and follow up with my doctor.  I will be doing that tomorrow after I get some rest. Did I mention that it took another half hour to get my actual discharge papers?\n\nIn the meantime, I'm praying to Jesus that there is nothing going on in my lungs! All in all, it was a six hour waste of time and my health insurance's money!! With that being said, I would not recommend anyone go to John C.

Well, I really like the easy scheduling, almost non-exsistent wait time (both in the lobby and for making appts) and my doctor, Dr Gregory De Santo.  \n\nThis location (32nd St) is the 2nd location I have visited and actually, is the closer to my house.  Dr De Santo works between both offices, with Tue and Thur being at this one, I believe.  It's much the same here and has the same set-up and benefits as the other (ultrasound machines, lab in office, etc).  I went to the Scottsdale location for so long but think I'll finish out my pregnancy here.  It's just closer to my house... oh and it has no stairs. haha\n\nHere's my review on the other location.. just thought I'd paste it because I'm lazy to rewrite everything...\n\nNow that I've had a couple of visits to Camelback Women's Health, a review is appropriate.  After finding them on an internet search for prenatal services, I called and spoke to a couple of women.  After answering many of my questions over a few calls, I was ready to make an appt.  ask me what my choice of Dr was and I simply ask them to set me up with the one they preferred... enter, Dr. Gregory DeSanto.\n\nI was always told that picking your maternity doctor was quite the chore.  It's joked about in movies and a matter of stress for many women.  I'm a lil more laid back than the average woman about such matters but, after I met Dr. DeSanto, I really didn't see the need to go to a dozen different doctors and stress.  He's relaxing, knowledgeable and does things himself that other doctors pass off to technicians - like my ultrasound.  He did an excellent job explaining everything he was doing, getting great angles of my lil baby and even showing me the gender before others say they can tell.  It was the most amazing experience to see my lil guy flipping around!!  I'd heard other women say that their ultrasound tech didn't tell them much and actually had them worried by not talking and explaining things but, there was none of these issues with DeSanto.  I'm a fan of his calm demeanor and simple, easy-going approach to things.\n\n* Dr DeSanto is knowledgeable, calming and explains things well.  And Jamie was so helpful with many of my misc. questions and helping me get set-up!\n\n* They have their own lab and ultrasound machine in their clinic so you don't have to run around, wait, or make separate appts for lab work!\n\n* Everyone is friendly enough and it feels like a cozy, comfy environment.  \n\n* There is little waiting time before your appt starts and they must keep gaps in the day because you can get in to see the Dr. in a timely manner.\n\nSee ya there!", "business_id": "nEaJwY77drRqQkJqcd9LRg", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-03-04", "type": "review"}

Initially my experience was positive, as I worked with a doctor named Stephanie Nguyen who seemed caring and attentive, and even once personally called me to give me test results. \nUnfortunately however I am not reviewing her, but the office as a whole. After she left to go on maternity leave, things began to go downhill. \nUnder her care I was prescribed an ultrasound due to uterine pain. I was not notified of her departure, but simply got a phone call from a stranger saying I had hemorrhagic cysts and polyps and that I needed a follow up ultrasound within 10 days of the start of my next cycle.\n\n Following the new doctors instructions exactly, I called the front desk to schedule my ultrasound, explaining to the receptionist on the phone that I needed to schedule an ultrasound within 10 days per the doctors instructions. The woman on the phone scheduled me for an appointment with the doctor very quickly, and considering I knew they did not always have ultrasound techs on staff (they have outside techs come in from an office called Fetal & Women's Center of Arizona) I wanted to make sure we were on the same page. I verified with her multiple times the time and the location of the appointment, that there would be ultrasound equipment and technicians on duty, and explained that due to my narrow window of time (10 days from the start of menstruation) how important it was to get this appointment done right. The woman's tone was dismissive but confident, and I let it go.\n\n Surely enough however, when I showed up for my appointment four days later the nurse on staff said they could not do my ultrasound and  casually closed my chart saying there must have been a misunderstanding because they did not have any ultrasound techs on duty on Thursdays. I was upset and asked to speak to a doctor. In the end I was treated rudely, dismissed, and told to reschedule my own appointment. \n\nUnfortunately, due to their irresponsible staff, I will now have to walk around with hemorrhagic cysts and polyps for another month (until after next menstruation), with no questions answered. Needless to say, I will never be returning to this office.\n\nLong story short - the staff does not listen, the office has multiple locations and outside ultrasound services which they seem incompetent about keeping track off, I was treated poorly and expected to fix their scheduling mistakes, I drove down to an office location despite their not being the resources necessary to perform my procedure and no one resolved this issue, and I will now have to wait until my next menstruation to discover more information about my ovarian cysts and polyps due to their oversight.", "business_id": "nEaJwY77drRqQkJqcd9LRg", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-04-08", "type": "review"}

The front staff was so rude on the phone. The girl I spoke to treated me like I was an inconvenience and how dare I call in to book an appointment. I should have cancelled at this point but I was excited with this being my first pregnancy. \n\nOn the day of my appointment I had to wait over an hour for my appointment to start. Then once I was taken back I had to wait another 30 mins for someone to see me in my room. Tracy came and was the nurse practitioner. She was amazing but I hear she is not longer with them. \n\nNow to the tragic part. I informed them that I would be having my 8 yr old son come in for the ultra sound because we were trying to make him feel like his apart of the process. Dr. Nelson came in. Dr. Nelson has no bedside manner what so ever. He proceeded to tell me right in front of my son that I was going to miscarry. He drop the bomb with little to no bedside manner. He could have asked my son to step out and then tell me. Then he walked out with out explaining anything and basically just dipped out. \n\nObviously I was devastated. I came back two days later to give blood work . Again the front staff was rude and dismissive. The girl told me that they MIGHT call me back the next day and if not give them a call whenever. I don't feel this is satisfactory for someone who is terrified waiting to hear if there baby is not going to make it. \n\nI ended up going with another OBGYN to have my medically induced miscarriage. CWH with out a phone call to follow up with me proceeded to send me a $7000.00 bill for a pregnancy that they deemed was not viable in the first place. You would think it would have been written down somewhere that I was no longer going to need prenatal care after I told them I was going to go somewhere else, my new doctor's office called them, and they DIAGNOSED my miscarriage.\n\nOver all this place is extremely unprofessional and is not a good choice for a first time mom or any mom.

I was fed up with the questionable, indifferent, and invasive and yet incomplete treatment at my old gyn office. My friend told me so many great things about Camelback over the last couple of years, yet I still stuck with my old gyno thinking things would get better and that their methods were probably the same as every other facility's anyway. But three years and five invasive and useless colposcopies later, nothing had changed. \n\nWell, you know how they say that sometimes you don't realize how bad things truly were until you experience the difference? They're right. \n\nI saw Julie Bergdale, NP supreme and all the hype on Yelp about her is true. The most striking thing besides her kind, smart, funny and compassionate demeanor is that she actually listens, truly LISTENS to you and absorbs your info, even the subtle bits. She wanted to know all about my health history, my concerns, and habits. For the first time since I moved here from CA, I felt like I was going to be cared for properly by my gyno office! (I left my truly awesome gyno of 18 years, Dr., Gerardo Bustillo, back in CA and so regretted it. But now, I think I may have some hope of a great experience again.)\n\nI had to wait longer than at my old place, but that's no biggee because it's only due to Julie spending quality time with each patient. And for that, I'm HAPPY to wait! What good is efficiency without quality? For the first time in three years of living in AZ, I got ALL of my many questions answered. Not danced around or dismissed, but answered intelligently and thoroughly. I'm the kind of a patient who knows my body well and takes the time to read books and studies and asks questions, so I need an office that not only doesn't mind but that prefers well-informed patients. Julie decided to do a full metabolic panel, plus CRP, plus cholesterol (amazing) and a hormone panel to boot based on my family history. This should really help establish a nice baseline from where to work. Sensible.\n\nWhy this was never done at my old office, I do not know. The staff and doctor absolutely hated questions, and as she reminded me many a time, placed the weight of their decisions on predetermined, one-size-fits-all protocols. My last phone conversation with my doctor, (a full 3.5 weeks after a mysteriously painful and stressful biopsy episode that threw my period off by two weeks) was very sad indeed. The gist of it? Apparently everything is the patient's fault at her office, even when monsels solutions may be mixed wrong and cause reactions....Very disappointing, yet not surprising. Nothing had changed. That's when I knew I really had to leave.\n\nBut not to worry. They say many times out of adversity comes understanding and positive change. After coming to Camelback, I know now that my last bad experience served as a painful wake-up call to me about my health and being more proactive and engaged moving forward. For the first time in years, I have high hopes of great care for the future. If the NP is this good, I believe this bodes well for the doctors. \n\nOver all, excellent!", "business_id": "nEaJwY77drRqQkJqcd9LRg", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-05-25", "type": "review"}

I came into the office for the first time at 6 weeks pregnant with a subchorionic hemmorage, at the time Dr. Nelson seemed wonderful, but the longer I had to deal with this office the more I real\u00eezed that I had been wrong. \nI came in at 10  weeks for increased discharge with a bit of blood in it, Dr. Nelson seemed irritated that I had scheduled an appointment. during the exam he removes the dirty speculum and shoves it into my face to point out the lack of blood, really rude behavior  considering his office staff told me to come in. I shrugged this off as just an off day for him.\nA few weeks later when I  was around 13 weeks pregnant  I was sent by the office to Labor and Delivery for an exam because my blood pressure had spiked dangerously high, once I arrived  at the hospital my blood pressure had evened back out. Next thing I know Dr. Nelson shows up at the hospital and begins to berate me for coming in to the hospital (even though his office had sent me). In front of my mother in law he says that pregnancy is uncomfortable and that I shouldn't come into the office or hospital  just because I think something is wrong. I later found out from my nurse that  he never comes to labor and delivery unless   you are in laor, he came down just to scold me.\nAt 28 weeks  I called the office because I had some upper abdominal pain, I was told to go to the er, however due to my previous experience I scheduled an appointment instead, I ended up seeing WHNP Amber Swanson, who actually proceeds to yell and berate me for \"non compliance\", then proceeds to tell me that   I have sugar in my urine   and that I  am a terrible parent because Iwas developing gestational diabetes. \nI have a new Dr. now, and I have since found out that Dr. Nelson did not offer us our early  pregnancy testing and many of the   treatments I needed I did not receive, I finally am seeing a high risk specialist and after the treatment I   received I would recommend that pregnant women find a different office it will save you a lot of stress.", "business_id": "nEaJwY77drRqQkJqcd9LRg", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-03-19", "type": "review"}

My pain levels are surprisingly low (about what they were pre-surgery which is exactly what Dr. Lykins said).  \n\nIt's too soon to tell how successful this will be in addressing the chronic issues I've been having but all in all, the experience was great.

About 7 months later I had an experience with them again and realized my initial suspicions about them were correct. \n\nLast year I was diagnosed with cancer in my neck & the surgeon who did my biopsy referred me to this place kind of out of nowhere. I had gone to see him on a Thursday for a follow-up (for what was most likely going to be the last time for awhile) & that Monday I was set to start chemotherapy. He thought it was a good idea to see an ENT thinking maybe they could add something to my diagnosis and/or treatment. I thought it was odd to do this so last minute (If I wasn't able to see the ENT the next day...which I was, I even asked my surgeon if he thought I should delay chemo until after I saw the ENT, but he didn't think that was necessary). He was pretty insistent that I go to THIS ENT office. My dad had just got done seeing an ENT for a throat condition, which he (and I) really liked, but my surgeon said he \"never heard of him\" and REALLY wanted me to go to this office (I looked up info on then ENT my dad saw and he has a very good reputation).\n\nI saw Dr. Bailey the following morning. Honestly, I thought he was a good doctor based on the initial exam I had with him. He was thorough & very personable. Since my appointment was scheduled so quickly he didn't have a whole lot of information going in and said he would consult my surgeon and get back to me. I never heard from his office again, but honestly, I didn't think much of it. I was starting chemo and was focused on that. Unless one of my doctors felt it was absolutely necessary to have an ENT involved with my treatment I was fine with never dealing with this office again (not because of Dr. Bailey, like I said, he seemed good) but I already had enough going on with chemo & eventually radiation. \n\nThat being said, I thought the manner in which I was scheduled to come into this office in the first place (and then never hearing from them again) was kind of tacky & it came across like they were just looking for any reason out there to bring in patients (I also understand that my surgeon also shares some responsibility here).\n\nWell, with chemo & radiation complete I recently had a follow-up with my oncologist and he asked about all the doctors I had seen throughout this whole ordeal. He brought up Dr. Bailey (along with my other doctors), and at first I couldn't even remember who that was since I had only seen him the one time. When I said I only saw him once and that was before I started chemo, my oncologist said since technically I DID see him the one time during this whole process he would fax him my latest report (along with all my other doctors). \n\nYesterday I get a phone call from Entegrity saying my oncologist wanted me to come into their office for a follow-up. I thought this was odd since he never mentioned this to me at my last visit (or called me afterwards to tell me this) so I told them I wanted to contact my oncologist's office before scheduling anything (and find out WHY he would want me to schedule something with an ENT). It turns out that he simply faxed them my report (like he said he was going to do), but never mentioned anything about coming back to them for a follow-up. My oncologist's assistant also seemed confused as to why this office wanted me to come back in after 7 months. If the ENT thought there was a reason to come back in based on my oncologist's report that's one thing, but to say my oncologist asked them to schedule me when he didn't is tacky.\n\nAll this just confirmed my initial thoughts that this office comes across desperate for patients. Like I said, I thought Dr. Bailey was good based on my brief encounter with him (which is why I'm willing to give this place a 2nd star). However, I would never come back here...", "business_id": "e0B-vLvKxGiGV_pTT7vwcg", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-05-29", "type": "review"}
