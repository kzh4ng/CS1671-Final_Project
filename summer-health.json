One reason is definitely the parking. This Y actually has a lot YMCAers can use that's right by the gym that's easily access throughout the day.  As a result, getting in and out of this YMCA takes significantly less time than other gyms.  It also is much much less crowded than the Dowd or Uptown/Childress Klein YMCA, likely because it has no pool or gym.  This YMCA also has  great group exercise classes. Meredith's Turbokick class is really incredible and, for me, sets the bar for all other aerobic classes at other Ys. The room for the spinning classes is a little dingy, but it is private and generally has good instructors. My only complaint is that this gym doesn't have more exercise classes because the facility here, while small, is much more pleasant than at the other YMCAs. It is also a little more difficult to get to from Uptown than the Childress Klein YMCA, which is a shame because I would much rather work out here. Instead, it tends to be a better before and after work gym.  Also, it isn't usually open on Sunday, which is unfortunate. \n\nAlso, because this gym is so close to Johnson and Wales, there tends to be a lot of younger folks here.

The Dowd Y is a very nice gym that offers a bevy of group fitness classes, up to date (and always functioning) equipment and a super clean atmosphere. \n\nWhy I love this Y in particular...the machines are always in service (and I've head that techs are out fixing them weekly if need be). They also do not allow any children under the age of 16 in the workout areas. Now, don't get me wrong, I love kids, just not when I'm trying to get my sweat on. \n\nAs mentioned before, this Y offers so many great group classes. I'm a big fan of Total Strength, Pilates Mat and Kickboxing. I've also heard the Spin classes are great. I've tried Athletic Conditioning, and while it certainly is an awesome workout, make sure you're at least in decent shape before you partake in that class! It's a rough one. \n\nAs other reviewers have noted, this gym can get packed especially after 5 pm during the weekdays. So be patient while parking. Some classes can get a bit crowded too, so keep that in mind when you're sprawling out your mat or equipment. \n\nI haven't had any issues with theft in the locker room, but I'm a big proponent of a big papa lock on my locker.

I keep going back to them, so that is sure to say something. I live very close to the Dowd Y and sometimes will run to this location or hop in my car to catch a class, even though I can walk to the Gateway location (which I do on some days when I don't have much time). \n\nPros: \n-Some people may consider this a con but I LIKE the fact that it is busy and very fast paced. As soon as I walk in the door, I can feel the buzz and excitement that everyone here is truly pumped to work out and better themselves. \n-The Dowd Y has a TON of classes and a varied schedule so you can choose the type of class for you at any time during the day whether it be before work, around lunch time or after work. I would suggest trying the Athletic Conditioning class if you like a challenge! The YMCA's of Great Charlotte posts their monthly exercise class schedule so you can prepare your workout routine in advance. I would like to say these classes are a great way to meet new people, but I am not one to chat while at the gym.. so that may be up to you to introduce yourself to fellow Y-goers. \n-This Y has a very young member base. I also like this. There are a few older members, who I would say are mainly men, that frequent here but not as many as the other Y's around the Charlotte area. \n-The staff is always friendly and most of them say Hello as you pass. I have never had a bad experience with any staff of any YMCA for that matter. They give off the vibe that they truly enjoy what they do! =) \n\nCons: \n-Parking is terrible at times. Mainly around lunch time and especially right after people get out of work from 5-7pm. But don't worry, you WILL find a space. You may just have to circle around the lot a time or two to find one. No biggie. \n-Around the same times, you may also have to wait for a cardio machine in the cardio area on the main level. This one can kind of be a pain in the ass, and probably isn't such a big issue at other Y's. When I show up around busy times and cannot get a treadmill or elliptical right away, I will usually wait a few minutes until someone gets off and offers me their equipment or I will lift weights first and come back to cardio later. Either one always works. So keep this in mind when you show up straight from work. There WILL be waiting times on certain pieces of equipment. \n-Layout: The set up of the Dowd Y is so strange, but considering it is in uptown I guess it makes sense. It is squished into a taller building, so a gym of this size covers several floors and it is confusing!! I still get lost and cannot find certain machines at times. I would suggest getting a tour from a staff member when you sign up, although they usually do that anyway. The cardio area on the main level (which is level 2) is really small and has a strangely low ceiling for a cardio area. It is the typical height of an office building ceiling so if you are not used to it, you may feel a little claustrophobic. I have always been used to gyms that are more spread out, spacious with higher ceilings, so frequenting this gym was an adjustment for me, but not one that I couldn't handle. \n\nIn conclusion, The cons are very minute compared to the pros of this Uptown gym. You could join the Sports and Fitness, which is only a block away from the Dowd Y, for half the price, but you would not be getting the size, variety of fitness classes and sense of community that you would receive at the Dowd YMCA. I pay $40 a month at the Dowd Y and can cancel whenever I need to. No contracts or sign up fee, and it is a monthly draft. This $40 a month also includes the use of the OTHER 2 YMCA's in the uptown area as well! I definitely think this is a much better deal than the close competitor Sports and Fitness. $40 for a monthly gym membership is very reasonable for downtown in a larger city.", "business_id": "b3u-GK6_xj2fJkinzLk_jQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-06-13", "type": "review"}

I don't do classes, yet there are plenty of offerings. The womens locker room is clean when I arrive (vs a disaster area after the AM working crowd leaves :-) ).  The equipment is mostly good (need NEW rowers!!) and kept up by really great maintenance guys (ok, no girls, yet). The weight room downstairs is good, though more often than not crowded. Weight room staff please gently nudge people to get off their blasted phones (emailing, txting, changing their music whatever) & not letting people work in between sets. Also the music in the weight room is TOO LOUD (& terrible)..  I also wish the staff could walk through the 3rd & 4th floors every minutes and get the jerks off their phones who cannot read or don't care about the very respectful NO CELL PHONE signs. One guy weekday mornings (white hat, arrogant attitude) breaks the rule ALL THE TIME, staff has talked to him and he still does it (then others will start being as rude/arrogant about it). One bad guy yet people glare and he disrupts the zen of the morning (9-11 ' ish timeframe) workout adults, who respect people (other than white ball cap jerk).  I think the variety of equipment is great and there is something for everyone. \nFitCentral trainers are THE BEST (especially Janet & Jill) and worth the occasional if that's all - fee to train right for your body mind & soul.  (I cannot be comfortable the Y staff has beyond the basic training, and certainly not the time, to provide a good overall training workout).  \nThis is a busy, high-volume Y so lots of whining people who demand alot. I give them credit for trying to make people happy.  I am smiling more when I workout as I'm less peeved about all the non-caring people, unkempt equipment and unclean locker rooms - because it is truly much better than it has been in a very long time.

They also have a sauna AND a steam room, which, though small, is amazing! \n\nOverall, I feel this is a good place to work out with lots of variety and clean, convenient amenities (like providing towels), for a good price - especially because I get to go to any Charlotte Y.

It definitely gets crowded at that time, so if you can make it here during off-hours, it is a decent gym. Very clean and nice locker rooms.  Plus, I once lost a necklace here, and the cleaning staff found it and gave it back to me, so props for that.\n\nI do have some serious issues with this gym, though. I am a group exerciser, so my main problem is with the group exercise facilities, which seem to have just been thrown together without much thought. Most of the classes are just randomly held in one part of the gym that is separated from the rest of the gym by sheer netting. As a result, when you're exercising the entire gym can (and usually does) stare at you. There also isn't a mirror anywhere for you to check your form. The YMCA actually has a proper group exercise room hidden away in another part of the building where a few classes are held, but it isn't clearly marked at all, plus you have get a special pass from the front desk to even get to it--very inconvenient.  The spin classes are held in the middle of the running track , so while you are spinning, joggers, often engaged in loud conversation, are constantly running by you, which is pretty annoying.  In general, the classes taught here tend to be different than at other YMCAs--the instructors are older and the classes are very Jane Fonda-esque.  I've been to a lot of them and have found the spin classes and the Body Pump (group weightlifting) classes to be the most challenging and have the best instruction. I've never been to the Athletic Conditioning class, but it seems pretty intense, too.  That said, in general, I don't think the classes are as hard as what you find at the Dowd or the Gateway (the Turbokick classes here are in no way as good as the ones at Gateway and the Dowd YMCAs).\n\nThis gym does have great pool going for it. Unfortunately, it tends to be packed with jerky triathlete types who either don't know how or don't care to properly share the lanes. Again, when it is off-hours, the pool is much better. \n\nWhile this Y does have parking in the basement of the building, but it is a little dicey to get around, and I believe parking is only free during off hours.", "business_id": "M89_KGMzLmdevtAlC_Ufsg", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-06-01", "type": "review"}

After they checked me in they had me fill out a form saying I would accept responsibility for paying the bill myself and I told Dr. Cerwin several times that I could not afford even one session if I had to self pay so if that was even a possibility I should not be treated at all there. I explained that the only reason I came in was because they told me on the phone they could definitely bill the responsible party. Dr. Cerwin assured me that getting me better was his main focus, the staff assured me the document was just a formality, and Dr. Cerwin said \"let's just hope they do the right thing at the end and work on getting you better\". I agreed to see him for a while as long as he understood I could not afford to self pay, but he barely touched my back at all.

I was so scared, but Dr. Marashi put my mind at ease as soon as I got in his chair! Here is my breakdown.\n\nPros: \n\n1) He is very professional and courteous. He takes the time to explain to you what is going to happen and how it is going to happen. There are no surprises. You are well prepared by the time you get in the chair. \n2) I chose the sedation because I was a wimp and very scared. It worked great. I have a medical condition, so I could not be sedated 100%, but to be honest it didn't matter. I felt fine and comfortable. \n3) Dr. Marashi is very personable. When I got in the chair he talked to me about movies and what I did today. Honestly, we were chopping it up like we were old homies. \n4) He is on time. \n5) He checked in on me on the evenings after I had surgery. He personally called me to make sure that I was feeling okay. Now that is first class service. \n6) He is cute too! \n7) No pain! I did not have any pain whatsoever after my wisdom teeth extractions! I even went out to eat at the Olive Garden and had a full meal afterwards (and 2 of my teeth had to be cut out)! \n\nCons:\n\n1) He doesn't take insurance, so you do have to pay for the surgery! But who really deals with insurance anymore??? It's worth it to pay for his services.\n\nBottom line: I can't recommend this guy enough.

I could not be happier with the outcome.  After one full year both eyes are stable and I can see better than ever before.  The surgery was one of the hardest choices for me to make.  My fear was unfounded but I'm sure common to most thinking of having corrective surgery. Is it safe, is it worth the risk, will I be happy with the outcome.  All valid concerns and ones that they will help to answer for you.  I can only speak for my experience and the outcome.  It was safe, quick, and no worse than dealing with cutting an onion for a very brief period of time.  I opted for the mono-vision correction. It's a choice really well suited for older patients that are at an age where reading glasses will start to be needed.  So late 30's early 40's.  The procedure corrects the dominate eye for distance and the other eye for reading.  Your brains does the rest and it was seamless for me.  No more glasses and a very good chance I will never need reading glasses.  The procedure was about 10 seconds per eye and I walked out with perfect 20/20 vision.  At my one year visit my vision had even improved to a little better than 20/20.  The doctors at this practice gave me honest answers to my questions.  I never felt I was being sold a service but more guided to the best choice for my goal to never wear glasses again. If you are looking for a doctor that will not offer you a buy one eye get one free deal this is the place.  The cost is set and the value is well documented in the number of happy patients they have.  Don't look for the best deal.  Look for the best doctor that will give you an honest price for safe, virtually painless, corrective treatment.   It's your eyes, you may have been born with poor eyesight, but trust is earned.

I had to get a TB test and showed up as scheduled: 8:30, Easy right? Wrong... let me back up.\n\nTo my own fault, I didn't realize there were parking spaces in the back of the building. I ended up parking at the PDQ where the sign clearly states \" Parking Only for PDQ Customers. Violators will be towed\". Because I'd arrived a bit earlier than my appointment time, I didn't think it would be a long wait and parked my car there ( huge gamble). \n\nWalk into the facility and am instantly turned off. I cannot stand being in any kind of office that doesn't give you and the staff member privacy. The line was nearly out the door. Everyone had to get in line just to sign in, THEN take a seat. Once the line was clear, they called you up by name in the order you signed in. This completely defeats the purpose of having an appointment. Does this make sense to anyone? Certainly not me. Keeping in mind... I am parked in a place I shouldn't have parked my car. Afraid to move it, I crossed my fingers I wouldn't be towed or tickets. I didn't to to leave, have them call my name and miss my slot. \n\nMy name gets called and I think it's time for my to get my TB. Instead, I must go up and fill out paperwork. Why couldn't this be done sooner? The receptionist was quite rude. She was trying to do too many things as once instead of giving me proper attention. No professionalism at all. At any rate, I filled out the paperwork and went to sit back down. If I am becoming repetitive, it's because my actions were repetitive. \n\nOne receptionist, instead of calling the gentlemen to approach the desk, she begins asking him questions across the facility. Not only is this rude but considering the waiting area is the size of an average living area for a home, it causes distractions. Confidentiality should ALWAYS be maintained at such facilities. \n\nI am clock watching like crazy and getting nervous. Every second that goes by, I am risking my car being towed. 9am rolls around.... still waiting... 9:10 rolls around... still waiting... Finally at 9:25 I was called. Almost 1 hour AFTER my scheduled appointment time.\n\nThe TB shot took 2 minutes. Literally 2 minutes and I was out the door. \n\nI am not sure what kind of system Concentra seems to be working with but they need to squash it and rebuild including offering some classes for their front desk staff on learning how to be professional in the work place. \n\nA side note, when I went back 2 days laters to get my TB read, the waiting time was 3 minutes which I appreciated. I was also seen by a Medical Assistant Student. I have nothing wrong with this but as a note, please do keep in mind that Concentra does staff students. Some may take no issue with this while others do. Considering it was on a TB read, I was cool about it. That being said, I will NOT be coming back here. I take my confidentiality seriously and hold my health care providers to a higher level. Considering I am paying a crap ton of money for health insurance, I demand better service. If my primary health care provider treated me like I was treated at Concentra, you better believe by that night, I would have dropped my coverage. Avoid this place if you can. If not... Godspeed to ya. \n\nOh... and I didn't get a ticket or was towed. Happy, happy, joy, joy.", "business_id": "iyHtJGN4KtuSTUbB6fROBw", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-08-23", "type": "review"}

Especially since I've gotten older and my teeth have gone to hell no matter what I do.  (Yes, lady--I do floss.  Yes, lady--I brush at least twice a day, sometimes more.)  It's one of those things we hate because it's annoying, it takes time out of our schedules, and it's often painful.  No matter how we brush our teeth, we are prone to cavities.\n\nMidwest Dental isn't horrible.  I've had maybe five or six dentists in my life at this point, and I can probably say that of those that I've had, Midwest is the worst of them, but even still--they're not horrific.\n\nMidwest tends to assign you a hygienist so you see the same person every time you go. This is the first dental practice I've visited where this is the case. Every other one I went to, the hygienist was whomever was available.  \n\nMy first hygienist at Midwest was a young girl, fresh out of her two-year program, I believe.  She was nice enough, and competent, but she was a kid.  She liked kid things.  My first visit, while she had hands in my mouth and I couldn't scream at her that I didn't give two flying figs, she told me all about what had been going on during \"The Bachelorette\" that season.  The second time, she asked me what I was reading (I had a book with me), and then told me all about how much she loved \"Twilight.\" \n\nI was dreading a third uninformative visit with her, but she moved.  So, I was reassigned to a new hygienist.  Again:  A nice enough, competent hygienist, but not someone with whom I want to have a conversation. She still works there, so I won't go into too much detail in case she ever reads this.  She's a wonderful person, but I'm an introvert by nature. I don't want to make small talk.  I don't want to hear about her kids. I don't really tell people about my kids--why do I want to hear about yours, lady?\n\nThe hygienist is absolutely brutal with the dental floss.  She hammers that wax garrote up and down my teeth with all the subtlety of a teenage boy groping boobs for the first time.  \n\n\"Oh, your gums are bleeding.  You're not flossing enough.\"\n\nLady, I floss every friggin' day.  My gums don't bleed when I floss.  Maybe it's because you're trying to go THROUGH the frickin' tissue instead of along the tooth?  Don't even get me started on her skills with the violent metal pick.  She has cut me like Wolverine.\n\nThey also really like to indict you on anything you do food and drink-wise at this place.  \"Your teeth show wear.  Are you drinking soda?\"\n\nYeah, a can or two a day.  But I brush.\n\n\"YOU SHOULD NEVER DRINK SODA!  IN FACT, IF YOU LIVE IN A COUNTY WITH A SODA BOTTLING PLANT, YOU HAVE TO MOVE!  DON'T COME WITHIN TWO HUNDRED MILES OF A SODA!\"\n\nGeez, lady. Lighten up.  \n\n\"How much do you brush a day?\"\n\nAt least twice.  Once in the morning before I leave for work, and again at night.  Sometimes I sneak another one in there sometimes.\n\n\"How many minutes, though?\"\n\nTwo or three per session, plus flossing at night.\n\n\"YOU SHOULD BRUSH YOUR TEETH FOR THIRTY HOURS.  NEVER STOP BRUSHING.  YOU'RE NOT BRUSHING ENOUGH.\"\n\nWell hell, lady...\n\nThey also like to sell you extra crap that you may or may not need.  \"Here--here's a special paste you should rub on your gums.  It's $15.  Here's a special toothpaste. You can only get it here. It's $15.  If you need more, come back here and spend another $15.  Here's a rinse. It was made from elf urine. It's magic.  $22.\"\n\nIf my dental plan could be covered under another dentist that didn't involve a drive across Madison, I'd probably switch up and go there.  Unfortunately, I'm limited in my choices, so I'm stuck returning to Midwest Dental.\n\nAt least there's a Perkins right next door.  Right after I get my teeth done, I take a special pleasure in going into Perkins for a stack of flappys with extra syrup and a diet Coke.\n\n\"YOU SHOULD NEVER EAT SUGAR!  AND WHAT DID I SAY ABOUT SODA?\"\n\nGeez, lady...it's life. I'm going to live it.  Relax a little.", "business_id": "seYxnMc1VrZsR7nc09ufmg", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-08-06", "type": "review"}

He then shared some personal advise on what works for him.\n\nWith my glasses, I was able to pick out the frames that I wanted and they got them back in within about a week and a half.

Employees are not helpful, but there is a receipt book that they give you at the end of the purchase that tells you about  frame choices (i.e., after you buy your non-rectangular frames for your fat face, they tell you not to do that).

I asked her if she could send them out to another lab and she refused saying they wouldn't be able to do it either, and that my only option was to buy new frames! \n\nNow this seemed insane since my frames somehow got lenses in them inititally. Her excuse was that my frames were to \"beat up\".  Sure, they could have used a few adjustments from me wearing them, but they weren't bad. \n\nAfter I left extremely frustrated I took my script to all about eyes and they immediately sent my frames out to their lab and installed new lenses in a week! All for a fraction of the price.", "business_id": "R7oNZOg09xgqLzbqzVQxvg", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-07-08", "type": "review"}

As a college student with limited funds, I admit that I usually ignore my dental health, at least when it comes to regular visits to the dentist.  Our student insurance luckily covers dental costs, so I thought it would be a good time to get a check-up, especially because I hadn't seen a dentist in over 4 years.\n\nDuring my initial visit, I had a pleasant time with the hygienist, who shared stories and was generally careful and attentive with my teeth.  However, she called in the doctor to look at my teeth, and they both confirmed that I required a deep-cleaning.  I was a bit horrified and thought this was my punishment for evading the dentist for years, as the doctor explained that my gums were now completely infected by bacteria that could ruin my jaw if I didn't have it treated.\n\nThey said the cost to repair the damage would be about $1,800, and they started pressing me when I looked apprehensive.  My dental insurance didn't cover such expenses.  I explained that I couldn't pay for the costs on my own, but--no problem for them!  Why?  They had a dedicated loan counselor on staff (seem fishy to anyone else?) who whisked me out of the patient room and had me sign a loan for the procedure on the spot.  I know I should have been more assertive, but I was very shaken about threats that my jaw would rot off within a year.\n\nAfter a long and painful procedure in which the doctor injected pain-killer in my mouth and then scraped the teeth under my gums, I was told I would have to come back for regular follow-ups each month to make sure the deep-cleaning had worked.  When I came back for a follow-up shortly afterward, I was charged $100 (again, not covered by insurance)!  The follow-up took less than 10 minutes and consisted of the hygienist poking around my mouth, which certainly didn't seem worthy of $100.  I finally gave up on Champaign Dental at that point, regretful that I didn't trust my initial gut instincts.", "business_id": "GNCN5Uy169ix11VW_EAC-g", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-08-13", "type": "review"}

Case in point: they keep sending me notices for 3-month updates--I don't know of ANY dental insurance that pays for 4 dental checkups a year!\n\nLike Heather T mentioned, Champaign Dental uses a more thorough check-up system than other dentists I have used, which includes measuring the density of your teeth to check for cavities.  This may explain why many people who haven't had cavities before find one when they go there (or it may be a scam, who knows).  \n\nI really enjoy the dental hygienist I see.  Her technique is great, and my visits are quick and painless.  Dr. Kuo is great as well.  I have an extremely rare type of dental bridge, and as he's the ONLY dentist in town who has any experience with one, I don't really have the option of seeing anyone else.

When I got there, I had tons of paperwork (btw....since when does the dentist need your social security number?) to fill out which they seemed annoyed that I didn't show up earlier (even though they told me to show up later). They also hadn't sorted out things with my insurance company. They insisted that they could not bill my insurance company and that I pay up front and ask for reimbursement later. I thought this was very odd so I insisted on calling my insurance company there.  This whole process ended up taking so long  that I ended up having to reschedule my appointment.

I just wish that if they had issues, they would have called me to let me know ahead of time so I didn't have to worry about it when I got there.\n\nI will add that they were very kind about letting me bring my bike inside since there's not really any bike parking outside.

I may only be 22 years old, and it may be rare for a 22 year old to have a malignant lump, but I do have a family history of breast cancer that was conceived early in their 20's. \n\nAs for my appointment, I had it scheduled at 7pm and I wasn't seen by the NP until 7:45. When the NP (nurse practitioner) came in, she checked out my lump and told me we need to get an ultrasound right away to make sure it isn't anything we need to worry about. When I had my pap smear she told me it looks like I have a yeast infection too. \n\nShe also gave me \"tips\" about keeping your vagina healthy such as Douching. First of all, this is HORRIBLE advice. Douching is the worst thing you can do for vaginal flora. This is the main reason why women get vaginal infections and bacterial vaginosis.

Second thing is that I was clearly told I have a yeast infection and was not given any prescriptions to take care of it. \n\nI really feel like the office just does not care about my health or concerns and didn't do anything to make me feel comfortable.

Although I do appreciate the \"breastfeeding acceptance\" posters. I loved seeing the babies names posted in their lobby with weights and such. It made me feel like they enjoy delivering babies. They have pictures of babies EVERYWHERE!  When you get to your appointment you have to pee in a cup, so come ready with a bladder ready to go. The front desk staff isn't that outgoing, but the ladies who took my weight and blood pressure were always sweet.  I felt bad about my weight gain during pregnancy, and they didn't come down on me about it. (which was a relief.) \n\nI came into this office when I was 30 weeks along. They took me in, to my surprise because I heard that women have issues with getting a doctor that late in their pregnancy. My doctor was Dr. Sharon Thompson. She's super sweet and down to earth. I picked a female doctor because I just don't feel like a man would understand what I was going through. She basically sat me down when I came in and was like \"We try to do things as naturally as possible around here. No pushing you to do one thing or another.\" AH! What a sigh of relief! I was in love with the office already. I was sad that they wouldn't give me an ultrasound when I wanted one, but I understand it was insurance reasons. Appointments were quick which was nice because it was mid summer and I was super pregnant and wanted to be home. Just a lot of \" do you have any questions?\" and responses. I felt a lot of reassurance in my answers to my questions. I swore I was dying because my feet were swollen. She reminded me it was just a part of my pregnancy and once the baby was out I'd be fine! And guess what? I am fine. \n\nOkay, labor talk. I went into her office for my once a week appointment when I was informed that I was 6cm dilated. She asked if I wanted my membranes stripped, and did. It wasn't that bad, and told me what to expect over the next few hours to day. She said \"tomorrow you'll be meeting your baby\" and I did! She let me push when I wanted to and gave me three different ways to push. I pushed for about an hour to an hour and a half.  She wasn't even mad that my water broke on her shoes. We TALKED the whole time I was in labor. The whole room was laughing at one point because people were cracking jokes. (I did have an epidural) I also had an extremely attractive resident guy there to witness his first birth. Super cool.  \nI never imagined my labor experience would be so amazing.

My perinatologists said that my pregnancy was very complicated and because I was a HUGE hemorrhage risk, and in too perilous a position to go home, I HAD to stay there night and day, even though I only lived a couple of miles away.  They said I could be compared to a water balloon resting on a bed of nails.  Scary stuff!\n\nIt was the most challenging and depressing time of my life.  I couldn't go home to my 3 kids and husband (even though I could *almost* see my home from the parking garage roof), I couldn't prepare for my new baby because I didn't know if either one of us were even gonna make it.  I couldn't be home to prepare a nursery, plan a baby shower, get lunch with my girlfriends, go to work, NONE of that stuff.  It was SO depressing and scary for me.  \n\nThankfully my team of doctors and surgeons and the wonderful OB (and later the ICU) nurses made my experience as pleasant as possible.   They took care of me physically, mentally and emotionally.  The nurses there are all sweethearts and I adored them, they went out of the way to make me at home.   They treated my husband and children like valued guests, and make the process of my kids visiting me as 'normal' as possible.  That was important to me since my kids were very concerned that I wasn't going to come home to them, and were utterly convinced that their baby sister definitely wasn't going to live.  Thankfully, we BOTH made it home alive thanks to the skilled doctors, surgeons and nursing staff that took care of us both at Good Sam and at the Phoenix Children's Hospital NICU inside of Good Sam that cared for the baby once she was born.\n\nAlso, I have to mention that my bedrest room in the OB Axillary wing was HUGE, and that is no exaggeration, it was seriously the biggest hospital room I have ever seen and would easily, comfortably hold a dozen or more visitors.    WOW!!\n\n\n\nNow for the cons:\n\nThe food was really NOT very good, and I think this is where the hospital truly falls down on service.  I would routinely get bizarre, disgusting meals delivered to me, like a plain dry hamburger with a double helping of steamed carrots, no condiments at all.  WTF?   Or once they sent me a slab of dried up cold meatloaf (no gravy) and two plain baked potatoes, again no condiments.  Again, WTF?   And sadly the cafeteria food is NO better.  The food was greasy, mushy and /or tasteless and WAY, WAY, WAY overpriced.  (My mom spent 4 weeks at St. Joe's a few weeks before I was sent to Good Sam and I could see firsthand that St. Joe's cafeteria is SO much cheaper in comparison.)   Because of the dismal food options my family routinely brought me yummytastic meals from the outside, like Long Wong Hot Wings, Pink Champagne cupcakes from Barb's Bakery, hummus and pitas from Pita Jungle, Mexican food from Juliobertos...you know, yummy stuff.  :)   So for this alone I am deducting one star.\n\nAlso there is a VAST difference between the quality of rooms in the old part of the hospital and the newer OB rooms over in the axillary wing.  The difference is night and day, in fact.  The old rooms are minuscule in comparison to the new rooms.  In fact the old tower rooms practically require you to step outside to change your mind.   \n\nBut the crappy food and tiny, old tower rooms aside, the hospital is GREAT.  The nursing staff is wonderful and the doctors are all top notch.  I wouldn't have gone anywhere else for the level of care and observation that I needed.  In fact, the staff here is so skilled that I understand from what I was told that, for what my particular condition was, I would have been flown to Good Sam for bedrest and delivery no matter where in Arizona we lived.  It was just random luck that we lived right down the road. \n\nIt is THE hospital to go to in Arizona for an extremely high risk pregnancy.\n\nI will never be able to properly thank everyone who cared for us for those 13 agonizingly loooooong weeks at Good Sam, but I can only hope that giving them a great review will at least steer others to this wonderful facility.", "business_id": "CAD0tKIttOTTgT7TMJa-lQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-07-10", "type": "review"}

I see people complaining about the empty ED waiting room and how they still have to wait hours to be seen. You may be sitting there with your broken hand or with an upset stomach or itchy because of an allergen. But what you don't know is that behind doors physicians and nurses are in the middle of saving the lives of people who need priority care... people who will most likely die if not cared for first. 20 physicians and nurses could be working on that 2 year old who stopped breathing after being pulled out from underwater as she fights to live, or they could be caring for that family who were slammed into by a semi while hoping that the parents don't die so their children won't grow up as orphans. Some people may complain about how their physician is stuck up or how their nurse doesn't give them enough attention. Sure those behaviors are not acceptable, but sometimes you need to be empathetic. You are not the only patient the physician has to care for. He/she may have over 50 patients they're responsible for that day. That nurse may be busy resuscitating that critical patient whose condition is tanking fast. It is not easy being responsible for so many people's lives. My point is that Banner University Medical Center is a great hospital with amazing physicians and nurses who work hard to develop their skills and knowledge. The work that these health care providers and staff members do is all in the interest of providing excellent patient centered care.

So i looked at it, thought it might be an ingrown hair so i did 'surgery' on it... for lack of a better phrase.  used tweezers, a sanitized stick pin and got the 'ingrown hair\" out (although did not find a hair)...  \n\nSo my daughter wakes up this morning, her whole chin is swollen.  She is a Navy Veteran, served in war and everything.  She is NOT a complainer.   The doc came in and didn't even look at her for more than 2 minutes.  It was a female doc and didn't introduce herself.  Did not put gloves on and examine it, just basically looked at her, and gave her an Rx for antibiotics told her to not squeeze it and said that if it wasn't better in a couple of days to go to the E.R..

More and more red, just doesn't look right....   i said, \"honey, I need to look at that\"  i barely put any pressure on that, and a bunch of green puss (yes tmi) comes out.  it did not take much pressure for me to get a bunch of infection out.   i contacted a friend who is a PAC...  She said I did the right thing and that daughter needs to see a doc soon and keep taking the antibitoics.

I have had a battery of treatments (surgery, rashes, dry scalp, mole removal, laser hair removal, botox, aesthetic treatments and on and on...) there and every single experience has far exceeded my expectations.\n\nDr. Laris' bedside manner is second to none. A couple of years ago, Dr. Laris performed an otoplasty procedure on me. He took the time to explain the process and technique and answered all of my questions with the utmost of care. The outcome was not only natural results, but a boost in confidence after a weight that I had carried around my entire life had finally been lifted. From surgical procedures to botox injections (shhh...), Dr. Laris' skillful hands deliver tasteful, natural enhancements that make you feel like a better version of yourself.\n\nHis staff are equally amazing, which is no small feat! From the front desk staff to the nurses and PAs, everyone treats you with the utmost respect. I've been seeing their aesthetician, McKenzie, for laser hair removal treatments for a while now and I can't stop going back for more once I finish an area. McKenzie is very attentive and has a bubbly personality. She's helped me clear my \"bacne\" through a series of peels and treatments. Her services have also improved my quality of life immensely!\n\nLastly, I recommend Phoenix Skin to all of my friends and family. My mother had skin cancer removed from her lip by Dr. Laris and countless friends of mine (including my husband) have been getting their once-thought-it-was-the-best-idea-ever tattoo removal done by Caitlin and their state-of-the-art PicoSure laser.

It is really designed for a person who just doesn't have a clue as to where to start on their recovery from mental illness, or someone who functions but never has had a chance to actually learn how to do it.  For people who are higher functioning, there is an afternoon program that really focuses on the processes you have already learned and how to use them more successfully.\n\nI am not going to begin to say what you do is easy at Friendship.  It requires work on the part of the individual.  What is unique about Friendship is even if you have no desire to do the work it takes to recover, they will teach you through group work that you are capable of doing it.  I am proof of the fact that it works.  An added advantage of the program is you are always welcome back.  I'd like to say that anyone who graduates from Friendship is going to handle things from there on out with no problems.  That is never the case. There will always be problems.  If at some time in the future you recognize you are becoming overwhelmed, you can go back.\n\nFriendship's staff is really a dedicated group that truthfully want to assist someone who is dealing with emotional or mental health issues to achieve a happier more effective life.  If that wasn't their goal I guarantee you they would not last.  From Gus who will first contact you, (I remember thinking Gus, sounds like a moron's name, before I met him-but at that point in my life, I would have thought the same of Mother Theresa) to Erika and Shawn in the front office, to the staff, everyone is there to help you regain your health.  They work with you on everything including dealing with your insurance company.  While they can't do everything for You, you will have their support along the way!\n\nI simply can not say how much Friendship means to me personally.  It is there for you or someone you love as well.", "business_id": "3KwmkeqyC-STUvTcPOxsCw", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-07-05", "type": "review"}

Not uncommon, but don't tell me it's \"AZ law\" to get a set of 18 x-rays when it's obvious you are bilking insurance companies. \n\nThird, Dr. Eric the dentist was nice enough, but don't talk over me when I'm voicing my concerns.

Myself or my staff is not accustomed to working with someone with a TBI.\" Then he walked out. Like he did not already know her condition from day one.

They deserve that for being so friendly.\n\nFirst, let me say that from a performance metric perspective, I have no reason not to believe that this office performs at 5 stars.\n\nHowever, from a cost perspective, I would rank this office a 1 or 2 star, because this office is definitely in the upper echelon of dental prices.  Fortunately or not, I have had to move a lot, and that has required visiting a lot of dentists, so I have a good idea of what needs to be done and how dentists work.  So when I saw Dr. Price in Phoenix Best Dentists (or whatever it was that I Googled), I figured I would have more of the same.  However, that wasn't the case.\n\nLet me just say that all the amenities you will see attribute to the cost you pay.  First, the office is like a day spa from top to bottom.  Second, it would appear that every conceivable dental technology exists there.  That can be to you detriment as well, given that I had to pay roughly $50 extra, per quadrant, for laser deep cleaning (when all I asked for was a regular cleaning to save money).  Btw, laser deep cleaning isn't as fancy as it sounds; it's simply an infrared light that is underneath your gum line.  I wasn't aware I needed such a procedure until I visited them, had no symptoms suggesting such prior to my visit, but I trust them.\n\nFinally, I don't believe they have a comfortable handle on insurance policies.  I have requested preauthorizations for nearly all of my procedures, but when I follow up, they provide me with some excuse as to why they don't have it.  My last dentist's office could tell me EXACTLY what I would be paying before I showed up for my next appointment.  With Dr. Price's office, it's always a guessing game.\n\nIf I were to have a padded wallet, I would recommend this office, hands down.

Let me start off by saying that it took me 5 years to save up a few thousand dollars that I spent on a Groupon for an invisalign treatment here. I went through about a year of invisalign....After that, one of my bottom teeth was still rotated and I had to go through a refinement and do another year of treatment (I wouldn't have minded much, but I had to wear attachments with my treatment and I didn't think they were very appealing). I had paid a lot of money and spent a lot of time working on getting my teeth straight and I wanted them perfect. At the end of the second treatment I still have a tiny gap near the bottom tooth, but everything else looks pretty straight. I walked out being averagely satisfied. But this isn't the worst part yet....\n\nI had been going to another dentist for my cleanings. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and let them do my semi-annual cleaning. I had asked them if my dental insurance covered my cleaning before I walked back...and was assured that it did. So, I walked back and they cleaned my teeth. I then checked out and asked again if I had owed them anything, to which they responded no. About a month later I get a bill in the mail saying that I owed them $100 for the cleaning. I was extremely upset. It doesn't seem like much, but it is when you are still going to college. I called them to discuss my concern and the front office lady quickly rushed me off the phone and said that I was \"out of network\" so my insurance didn't cover all of the cost and there was nothing she could do. That would have been nice to know before getting my teeth cleaned, especially when it is covered at 100% at my other dentist. I felt cheated and like I wanted to get this taken care of, so I took off work and went into their office in person to talk to them. I explained how upset I was and the office lady rushed me to a back room to finish discussing. She did end up refunding my $100, but then had the nerve to say that \"That's not how I should handle things in the future\"....\" And that \"it's my responsibility to know my insurance coverage\"...I agree that it is my responsibility to know my coverage...but I work in healthcare...and it is also the facility's responsibility to give the patient accurate information regarding their service charges. After all of this, I was extremely dissatisfied with their customer service. I did not want to continue going here after going through all of this. However, unfortunately I had not gotten a retainer after my invisalign treatment yet. I had planned on saving up another $450 to do so before going through this nightmare. So instead of spending my money there, I decided to go to another orthodontist to have a retainer made. This is the icing on the cake......\n\nDuring my consultation with another orthodontist to get a retainer made, he looked at my bite and my teeth and said that he would not make me a retainer because I still needed about another year of invisalign treatment... and that my back teeth were not touching when I bite...which is true. At this point I just wanted to cry. I had spent thousands of dollars and over 2 years trying to make my teeth nice and I got ripped off because it wasn't done thoroughly. I have a few appointments with other orthodontists and am praying that one is willing to make me a retainer. I do not have thousands of dollars laying around to go through another invisalign treatment, and I just want my teeth to at least stay where they are for now...until I can one day save up again and have them done correctly. \n\nThrough all of this negativity, I will say that Dr. Ginger Price was nice and worked with me when I needed a filing on my front tooth. She was willing to match the price of my other dentist office at $28....when they initially wanted around $350....

I tend to not keep up with regular appointments and I'm ridiculously nervous in any area of the dentist office.  This has been my M.O. my whole life.  But my few experiences at Artistic Dental may have changed that for me.  Here's a few areas worth noting.\n\nThe office.  Artist Dental has a beautiful office located in the Camelback Corridor area.  They provide a very relaxed, homey feel to their waiting area, where you have a choice of chilled bottled waters, keurig coffees and teas and various snacks.  I don't imagine anyone who was about to see the dentist take up any of these offers but it's nice to the have the option while waiting for someone else or as you're headed out of the office.  Additionally, they provide views from each dentist chair (not sure what they are called) so you can see the sky and the beautiful church across the street.  They also have water features and lots of greenery to help soothe the nerves.  :) \n\nStaff.  The staff is really remarkable.  They provide wonderful customer service and professionalism.  They certainly make you feel like they care about you and make you feel comfortable and let's face it, no one feels comfortable at the dentist office.\n\nMary M. (dental hygienist), is one of the most kind, gentle and pleasant people I've been around.   She does an excellent job and shows remarkable patience for squirmy patients like me.  \n\nI've recently had the pleasure of working with Dr. Adhikari.  She has greatly helped with my fear of being in the dentist chair.  She's caring, patient and extremely funny which only makes the process that much easier.   I recently had to have a partial on my back molar and she made the process feel like a cake walk.  She explained all the steps, took a conservative approach and and established a relationship with me which made me feel at ease.   Because of Dr. Adhikari, I'm now brave enough to move forward with a dental issue I've been putting on the back burner for years.  \n\nBritni (Dental Assistant), was also a great pleasure to work with.  She is extremely professional but in a kind and gentle way. \n\nAdditional, the office allows for fraidy cats like me to listen to music while having any work done, rather it's a cleaning or something like a crown and cozy up in their plush blankets to help relax the nerves.  :)\n\nThe office of Artist Dental is a top notch office and I would highly recommend it as your dentist office too.", "business_id": "0eX3fQIVekKGbEISfhcQwg", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-08-08", "type": "review"}

The staff was wonderful and did everything they could to relieve my anxiety!\n\nWe came up with a game plan and part of that was to remove some teeth.\n\nLet's talk prices for a moment.. \n\nKeep in mind the office is in the Biltmore area...need I say more?  \n\nLocation and cost does not guarantee better work.\n\nThey are more expensive than any dentist I have seen but....they say you get what you pay for and my smile is very important to me.\n\nI decided to let him do my top teeth and if the results were positive I would let him do the bottoms.\n\nIt was several weeks before I was to start the work and I had a terrible toothache so I went in and  told Dr Dougherty which tooth was hurting and requested he pull it and that would make one less to be pulled in a few weeks.\n\nWhen he was done I looked in the mirror and was horrified to find he pulled the WRONG tooth!\n\nBecause of this I was embarrassed to smile in fear my big gap would be seen since the tooth was toward the front.\n\nAlthough the Doctor apologized I had lost my faith in him and was now petrified to have the remaining work done...\n\nWhen the time came I put on my \"big girl pants\" and went back for the other extractions .  I made it clear how nervous I was and Dr Dougherty assured me he would be gentle and I wouldn't feel any real pain......HE WAS WRONG !\n\nSo  what would have happened if he told me the truth?  I now felt lied to ... So let's add things up to this point:\n\nHe pulled the wrong tooth\n\nHe lied to me\n\nHis prices are exsorborant \n\nMoving on... When I paid for the top work I had given them the full amount to cover top and bottom from the estimates they gave me... Although the estimates seemed to keep changing! \n\nThe top teeth, although beautiful simply did not fit right... Even after the alignment ... and the only way to fix it would be to drive the 28 miles each way to his office and leave iit with him and make the same drive back to get them with no guarantees .\n\nI decided to just deal with them and find a new dentist.  \n\nAfter my experience I put the dentist off for over a year and found a wonderful new dentist close to my house\n\nWhen I told this new dentist of my anxiety he was HONEST with me and said there may be some pain for a very short time during injections but they would do their best to distract me.\n\nWhat do ya know... Honesty... And it didn't kill either of us in fact I trusted him completely after that \n\nAt Artistic dental AFTER insurance I would be responsible for appox $1800.00!!!!!!\n\nMy new dentist did the same work for $725.00 after insurance!!  Saving me $1075.00!!!\n\nI called Artisic dental and told them I would like the $800.00 approximate  money they were holding sent back to me so I could get the work done.\n\nI also requested a refund of the \"alignment\" since it didn't correct the problem. I was told they would speak with Dr and call back\n\nI got a call back and surprise surprise it seems they had a bookkeeping error almost 2 years ago and never billed something therefore they only owe me appox $300.00\n\nEXCUSE ME....WHAT? !\n\nI asked her why they are just finding this error now and why they have had my money for almost 2 years and never bothered to call and ask if I wanted it or if I was ever going to come in again.\n\nI told her that was unacceptable and their error from long ago just won't cut it nor should I be held responsible \n\nI had mentioned to her it would cost me $ 725.00. to have work done and I agreed to accept that and put this experience in the past .. Until.... Yesterday.\n\nI was with my friend who had her work done at Artistic Dental and she also told me of her \" BILLING ERRORS\" she had with their office and that is why she has not been back.\n\nIf you are looking to whiten your teeth or do cosmetic work I am sure Artistic will work for you.... But I would think twice about letting them do any serious work. \n\nMy last words of advise are.... Check their billing!!! Make sure they are billing your insurance only once and that you are getting the credits!\n\n\nOn that note I will say...\n\nLive each day as though it were your last and....

However, when we got into the office, they acted like we couldn't afford the procedure and therefore weren't worth the time. They didn't explain any of the tests they did, nor did they talk to my husband the entire 2 hours he was there. When my husband tried to ask questions, he was ignored. When the doctor saw him, it wasn't any better. He was brief and to the point. My husband required PRK LASIK and it would be about $4000. When my husband tried to ask a question or inquire about the vision for life program, he was told quickly about the medications he would need to purchase in addition to the procedure. The doctor then promptly closed his folder and left. \nIn contrast to this, we visited another LASIK doctor with good ratings and were treated like we were worth his time, explained everything to, and talked to thoroughly about the procedure and medications.

So far, so good. My vision is still a bit hazy but I checked out at 20/20 during my post-op the following day. AMAZING!\n\nI got off to a shaky start with this clinic. The person who performed the consultation exams was extremely friendly and professional. She did seem to want to push me toward the ICL but when the doctor (Dr. Schiff) came in to review my results, he said there was absolutely no need for that and said I was an excellent LASIK candidate. (I did not feel that he tried to steer me into a procedure that I did not need.) His 'bedside manner' was perfectly acceptable and I felt he was thorough. He reviewed my results with me, explained the procedure, and then popped in a demonstrative video for me for me to watch.   \n\nAfter meeting with him, I was directed to a person I refer to as 'The Closer.' He explained my surgical cost, what the day of the procedure would be like, and then asked if we could get the surgery scheduled. The cost was higher than what I was expecting and when I questioned the cost, I felt that he became a fast talker - 'their technology is the best, they have been around the longest, other vision correction centers are basically hacks, etc.' He also seemed to insinuate that my reservations about the cost somehow diminished what should be my ultimate concern - my vision. I found that a bit insulting. This felt like a sales tactic to me and made it feel a bit like a purchasing a car versus a medical procedure. I couldn't help but wonder what his commission was on this 'sale.' My recommendation to BDPEC would be to review this portion of the consultation. \n\nWhere I was most disappointed in BDPEC was that I left this appointment with no pre-arranged ride home. I was told I wouldn't need one despite the fact my eyes would be dilated during the appointment. I do assume personal responsibility for this but I had NO business driving myself home this day. My vision was horrendous - I slowly worked my way from Phoenix to Chandler using as many side streets as possible. I admit that I should have pulled over and waited it out but, as it turns out, it would have made little difference. My vision was still blurred 24 hours later! When I called to ask if this was normal, they said it was and that it could take up to 48 hours for normal vision to return. If that is the case, why would they not tell you to arrange transportation on your consultation day? I considered that a strike against their care for their patients.   \n\nAfter talking with several friends who have had the LASIK procedure, weighing their experiences, what they paid, etc., I chose to go ahead with the surgery at BDPEC. I was told I would be called with my surgery time for the following Friday. By Tuesday afternoon the week of surgery, I had not received a call and had to call them to find out when I was scheduled. Perhaps I was being impatient but I did have the schedule of my husband (who was driving me there and taking me home) to consider and wanted him to be able to arrange his day with as much notice as possible. So, that was another little strike as far as I was concerned.\n\nThe day of the surgery, everyone was quite nice except for maybe one person who administered the Valium - she just wasn't very friendly. No biggie. The surgeon sat down with me for a moment to review any questions I had. Despite a full waiting room, I did not feel that he was rushed and did feel that he was engaged in our pre-op meeting. The staff were thorough about plastering my name all over me - I assume to avoid mixing up prescriptions and patients. I appreciated that! They told me to expect to be there for about 90 minutes and I was. During the surgery, Dr. Fintelmann and another gentleman assisting him were both very calming. I was quite nervous and they really did what they could to keep me focused and relaxed. I am so grateful for that! The procedure took minutes and when I sat up, though very blurry, I could see! Dr. Schiff took a quick look before I could go home and he was kind and excited for me.\n\nAt my post-op the following morning, everyone again was friendly and welcoming. Though I am sure they experience this multiple times each week, they seemed genuinely excited for me as they congratulated me on my 'new eyes.' On a personal note, it is a very moving moment to hear someone tell you that you have perfect vision after a lifetime of being dependent on vision correction.\n\nI would recommend BDPEC based on my overall experience.", "business_id": "4R8uKEIwTVzHGLa3Edub0Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-07-22", "type": "review"}

He told me I had pink eye and gave me antibiotic drops that made my eye feel worse.  As soon as I stopped taking them, my eye felt better.  It must have just been allergies, so kind of a waste.\n\nI recently made an appointment with Dr. Bauer, and this time they were able to get me in within a couple of days!  I didn't have to wait too long, but I thought it was strange when she came in and said 'it's been a long time since I've seen you!'.  I was like, 'uh, I've never seen you.'  Nonetheless, she seemed pretty nice and concerned about my symptoms.  I was having some weird symptoms, which were difficult to diagnose, so she told me that I needed to get ultrasounds and also they'd like to do some blood work.  She told me to go to the waiting area and someone would come get me.  When the gal came to get me, I was trying to chat with her but she seemed like she wanted nothing to do with me and pretty much ignored me.  I didn't like that, considering she was sticking a needle in me (and who likes that??).  After that, she told me I could go, and was left standing there confused.  I thought I needed to get an ultrasound?  Was there paperwork I needed?  Would they tell me where to call?  I waited another 5 minutes to find someone at the front desk and was finally given a paper to bring with me, along with the info for the ultrasound.  I thought that it was strange that no one cared to tell me what I needed to do.  A few days after my ultrasounds, I received a call from the office saying that they received the ultrasounds as well as the results of my blood work.  The blood work all came back fine and there was nothing wrong there, but she wanted me to come back in to discuss the results of my ultrasounds.  Uhhhh... I called right away, totally freaked out about what the results were!  I had to wait two days to get in to see her, and I had nightmares.  It was not fun.  I go to my appointment, and I have to wait 45 minutes before she ever comes in to see me (and I had gone in the middle of my work day!), and what she wanted to 'discuss' with me was................................................ nothing.  The ultrasounds were all  normal and everything looked fine and dandy.  What?!  Why did I have to come in for that???  So I can pay another office visit fee?

After only a few hours post-op, I was able to see road signs and my clock from my bed, which were things I could never do before. The next morning, I went in and the eye exam revealed that I had gone from 20/600 (-5 in both eyes, one which had astigmatism) to 20/20!   \n\nInitially, they gave us a 10% discount, but I had received an email about procedures being 20% off over the summer, so I asked them for an adjustment. The amount for the entire procedure ended up being around $3,500. A friend of mine flew to Korea for her procedure and paid $1,400 for her flight and another $1,800 for her IFS LASIK procedure, but if I were to do it all over again, I would choose to go back to the LASIK Vision Institute in a heartbeat. \n\nMy husband was really pushing me toward PRK, but I chose LASIK because I did not have the recovery time (they said it would be 2-3 weeks vs a few days) and still, if I were to do it all over again, I would choose LASIK. I had minimal discomfort and dryness and I opted not to pay for the permanent punctal plugs. I used the prescribed eye drops, which cost me $80 at Walmart, quite liberally. I will say that they cause a strange metallic aftertaste that is appalling, so be forewarned.  \n\nI was concerned with the blurring in one eye that kept coming and going, but I have read that it is normal. I also had some ruptured blood vessels from surgery, which are now gone. Surprisingly, I've had minimal dryness compared to what I was expecting. You know, like having dry eyes while wearing contacts. Even the Acuvue Oasys brand contacts would cause great discomfort. An optometrist basically told me I shouldn't wear contacts at all because my blood vessels were growing toward my corneas, so glasses were the only option for me. I'm in my early 30's and I don't know why I didn't have LASIK sooner. Also, the halos they warned about don't seem any different from what I experienced with glasses. \n\nI'm thrilled. My husband says that there is a glow about me and honestly, I feel liberated. No more smudged glasses or crooked glasses, worrying about getting them knocked off of my face, or fumbling for them upon waking up.\n\nMy only gripe with this facility is that they scheduled a bunch of us for \"surgery\" at 9AM. The receptionists seemed to spend more time in the back of the office than the front. I waited until 2PM. The procedure itself lasted only 15 minutes. As we sat, nervously waiting in a dark room in our ridiculous garb (a hair net and some shoe covers), we were reassured that all we needed to do was stare at a light during the procedure. Dr, Kownacki performed the procedure and again, repeated that all I needed to do was stare at the light. The procedure itself is indescribable and there was slight pressure due to the suction and speculum. He must have done a fantastic job because during my post op, the person who examined my eyes said he could barely tell that the procedure had been performed. \n\nI know there are a lot of horror stories out there. I read a ton of reviews before deciding to go through with the procedure. The consent forms I signed at the office also caused my stomach to churn. However, nothing in life is without risk. Do your research, ask questions, and negotiate the price of your procedure.

She had nothing but great things to say about Dr. Zacher and his staff and I always trust my big sister, so I made an appointment. I just wish I had listened to her sooner and visited him much earlier than when I actually did. Now, going into my teeth cleaning, a tooth was aching so I had a feeling some work would need to be done, but I didn't know the extent. However, I was about to find out.\n\nThe day arrived for my teeth cleaning and when I arrived, I noticed that it's just down the street from LGO which is a bonus right there! I entered the cute office and loved how fresh and open the waiting area was. It didn't even feel like a dreary dentist's office at all. I also saw that they have a play room for kids, so you can let your child play while you have your appointment. Amy, the adorable dental hygienist did my teeth cleaning and from the second I met her, we didn't stop chit chatting! She's so much fun, extremely gentle on the teeth and does a great job of helping you to forget that you're at the dentist getting your teeth cleaned! Another thing that helped my to escape dentist reality was the fact that they have TVs in every room, so I got to watch The Today Show while I got my teeth cleaned. Between Amy's friendly personality and The Today Show, I almost (almost) didn't want my teeth cleaning to end. \n\nI won't go into dreadful detail, but let's just say that the ache in my tooth resulted in several more appointments throughout the next couple of weeks. While the work that had to be done wasn't the most enjoyable experience, Dr. Zacher and his staff did everything possible to make it as painless and pleasant as possible, and they succeeded! Daisy, Dr. Zacher's helper, did a great job of chatting with me before the work was done so that I stayed calm, cool and collected. The TVs continued to play so I got to enjoy The Today Show or HGTV during my appointments. Rhonda was always smiling when I walked in and it always made me feel so happy to see that she was genuinely happy to see me (and me her!). Dr. Zacher worked magic on my teeth and after the appointments, I left with a mouth in tip top shape. He did great work and I never had one issue after the appointment. He was also very gentle during the procedure so it was never painful. \n\nNot only do I like how they do business here and enjoy the staff, I also really like the local feel to the office. Dr. Zacher grew up in the Valley and has been around for years. He's honest and helpful. He's not like other dentists who might not have your best interest in mind. I knew every step of the way that Dr. Zacher and his team had my best interest (and my budget) in mind. Rhonda knows every client by name and always has a huge smile on her face. I could tell how bad she felt when she had to break the news to me on payment, but she did everything she could do to work with me and make it as least painful as possible. \n\nAfter my last visit, it was bittersweet because although I was so happy that my work was finally done, I will miss the friendly staff who treat their clients as if they are a part of the family. Luckily, I'll be back in the winter for my teeth cleaning, and I vow to floss every.single.day!", "business_id": "SeSmcvfWQxj3PKiizxkdQg", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-07-16", "type": "review"}

I was told I needed multiple crowns, fillings, sealants, etc. I was shocked...but trusted they knew more than I did and I wanted to keep my teeth past my 40's! \n\nAs soon as I entered the front door of Dr. Zacher's office I had a good feeling. The office is lovely and comfortable but not over the top - as some are. The staff is very warm and friendly.\n\nAfter taking a look at the xrays I had sent over from the other office and a thorough exam, Dr. Zacher determined that I only needed a couple of fillings...Seriously. Of course the work I actually needed was a FRACTION of the cost I was quoted at the other place.\n\nI scheduled an appointment for a few days later...45 painless minutes later I was done. Done! I'll be back every 6 months for a cleaning. They've got me for life. \n\nI cannot be more grateful. If you want an excellent dentist that has some integrity... just make your appointment.

I wanted to see Dr. Romine (and thought I was) but saw a tech or PA and was given a steroid injection and put on Solodyn to take inflammation down, was suppose to reschedule to have Dr. Romine remove the cyst. So, this is what's happened. I took Solodyn, (it's a horrible medicine) and yes, it has cleared up my face but had caused me to break out in little red dots that didn't itch, it was just ugly. So, I waited a week, still had them and called Camelback Derm. The assistant I explained this too said, no, I'm sure it's not an allergic reaction, I would just keep taking it. So, I kept taking it, two weeks later, I have hives and swelling and joint pain. I called Camelback Derm. to explain I needed to get in. I go in, and was told to stop taking the med. and they instead prescribed me a topical cream for my hives and said go home and just use the cream. What they should have done was given me an oral steroid, not a topical cream!!! So, I get the prescription filled and go home, rub the lotion on and the swelling and hives and pain get worse. I ended up driving myself to the ER the same night (last night) and was given iv fluids and benedryl which did not help. The dr.s there were convinced I had an autoimmune issue and to see a specialist. I went today to my PCP and was told I have had a severe allergic reaction to Solodyn (which contains Tetracycline) and that I have Steven's Johnson Syndrome and dermagraphism. Google it, it's pretty nasty. I was put on oral steroids and have to see a Rheumatologist as I may have developed Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Yes, everyone there seems friendly, but every time I've gone in, I'm ALWAYS being \"sold\" on prescriptions and \"you should be taking this\" or \"have you tried this\".

I made an appointment (dealing with mild acne), and was optimistic for some new treatment as well as to get a prescription for a topical I had already been using.  I knew going into it I would be seeing a PA first and then meet the doctor.  I made it clear on both the written forms they have you fill out as a new patient and verbally stated to the PA that I have an autoimmune disorder and cannot take certain medications with antibiotics.  I met the doctor for only 5 minutes.  i was still given a prescription for a topical with an antibiotic in it and when i got home, after doing more research, it was highly suggested on many websites (including the drug company's) to not use this medication because of my autoimmune disorder.  This was the first frustrating issue.  I called the doctors office and left a message with the nurse's line, and they did call back pretty quickly saying they would change the prescription.  While it was nice that the doctor gave me samples and coupons for the prescriptions, one of them was expired, and could not use it at the pharmacy (though I did end up later finding one online through the drug company).  I also found that frustrating-but only because it costed me an extra half an hour of going back and forth to the pharmacy.  Overall, I felt most bothered by the fact that I expressed more than once that I have this pre-existing condition that should be taken into consideration, and the neither the PA nor the doctors seemed to take notice.  I do understand that this doctors office is very large and busy, but being that I was a new patient to the office, I felt very rushed.  But, this office location is very convenient to where I live, and for the most part do not have many other skin problems to deal with, so I don't plan on having to go to this office very often, other than to follow up on my progress with these medications.", "business_id": "tGTw5eeAwLmaSFKLVasb7w", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-08-02", "type": "review"}

I came here because I was having issues applying makeup. My skin was too dry and I wanted to have a smoother texture on my skin. I left here 4 months later with horrible, horrible acne. I HAD NEVER HAD A BREAKOUT LIKE THIS IN MY LIFE. Was told at first I just needed 2 or 3 chemical peel treatments for my dead skin. However I got about 6, because I was told I waited too long after the first one and I needed the receive the treatment every 2 weeks for it to \"work.\" It seems here their aesthetician is more concerned with having clientele come in every 2 weeks, rather than actually doing good and making the issue better, therefore the client wouldn't have to arrive every 2 weeks. (And I was commuting far...) Every time I left, the aesthetician always made sure to recommend me 5+ products to buy at the door. (None of them were \"cheap.\") When i purchased a suggested face wash that only made matters worse, the aesthetician, Kristel, and Molly refused to listen and believe me that it was making me break out. They would not issue me a refund, but my biggest concern was that they would not listen to me. They acted as if they were home with me every night, caring for my face at all times, washing my face and applying my make up and sun screen. As if they knew my own skin better then I did. The only thing that cleared my face back up was TO STOP going to them. They also prescribed me multiple antibiotics and hormone pills, which also made matters worse. But did they listen? No, instead of admit to trial and error EVER; all they did was try to convince me it was a hormonal issue. (They made matters worse, prescribe more pills my body could not handle, now I have been diagnosed with anxiety and IBD.) It's sad that I was so belittled and not even treated as a reference to my own skin issues by healthcare professionals, who I trusted and believed actually cared for my well-being, however, I NO LONGER trust healthcare professionals because of the staff here.) Bottom line, the staff here has an \"one size fits all\" treatment when it comes to acne, but that's not the way skin works. (Especially ethnic skin! If you do more research on chemical peels, birth control, and ethnic skin, you will find why.) There's so much more I could say... I am certain if the staff saw me now, they would not even be able to recognize me. Since mid treatment, I began to feel like they didn't even remember what my skin looked like on the first day I consulted with them as a new patient. Nor did I feel like my original issue mattered anymore, because they created bigger issues. On a positive note, isolaz does work, it's covered by insurance, and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to operate the machine :) There's so much more I could say about this business, if you have any questions, just ask, but I'm telling you with all good intentions for someone out there struggling with the same issues I had, do not come here! My skin is cleared up now, but I still have scars under my make up to show, and the emotional scarring this caused me will last my entire life. I use to cry myself to sleep every night. Not to be dramatic, but I did develop other health issues thanks to the pills Molly prescribed me, which will also last my entire life. I did look into filing a suit for my claims, however I know I signed a couple of waivers, so I don't think legal action could be possible, but I do know now to be a smarter and more assertive person in the future. I know I could also contact the BBB.", "business_id": "tGTw5eeAwLmaSFKLVasb7w", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-08-11", "type": "review"}

He indicated that that day may come but for the time being all was good. We left feeling like when the time did come we certainly trusted Dr. Meger as he didn't seem to be selling procedures.

We were in the ER at JCL DV where he was \"medicated\" with morphine &  valium for the pain & then sent him to CT. The CT went well - and he was handled properly. We contacted the surgeon (Dr. E) that had repaired his neck/spine - who was operating upstairs at the time, and he ordered an MRI. \nThe Tech came & got Jack & wheeled him to the OUTSIDE of the MRI suite. He asked him to WALK into the room since he said the bed wouldn't fit thru the door. ??? Being 'medicated' Jack went along with the request. He put one foot down & as the other moved down in front of it, he tried to take a step into the room & hit the floor, falling to his elbows & knees...his face inches from the floor. \nAt this point the Tech - KB  - said 'should I get help' & Jack didn't have a clue - he was on the floor... so KB reached for his left side with 1 hand & tried getting him up. \nJack was in terrible pain but so medicated he wasn't thinking straight. He had the MRI... was wheeled back to the ER - where he told me about  this ...and Karl bolted back to the MRI room.  How can a guy that weighs 150# soaking wet hope to get a 220# man from a bed to a table ALONE & WITHOUT A BACK STRAP for help?? Jack came in to the ER unable to walk or stand and this moron tried to do more than he could. \n\nThe Dr. re-medicated him while we awaited the results. \nSubsequently, when we got home - Jack had SEVERE pain in his shoulder & neck, which we thought was damage to the neck because of his recent C-spine surgery. I filed a formal complaint online with JCL and their Patient Advocate - CONNIE - processed it - and I got email confirmation from her. \nFast forward almost a year - and our Lawyer gets notification that the HOSPITAL IS DENYING IT EVER HAPPENED. Jack had to have surgery on what was a perfect shoulder (for a 55 year old man). The surgeon called it 'from impact' & had to shave part of his shoulder bones! (that was AFTER he had to have lower back surgery first!)\nWe will NEVER go back to JCL unless it is our only option. The protocols are NOT SAFE. The letter from them said \"We are sorry you had a bad experience & have taken action\". HOW can they deny it happened?? We only asked for enough to recoup medical bills & a little pain & suffering - since Jack lost time at work & has more restrictions at his part time job in retail. No idea how long he will be able to work now. He lost 30% use of his shoulder!\nSo - they LIE, and LIE and LIE. \nWe have kept quiet about this for a year in the hopes the HOSPITAL would do the right thing. Now we are worried about the risk to others - since they still have KB working there in the MRI area! Be aware of everything that happens in the hospital... and if you are in doubt - ask for HELP - BEFORE it gets out of hand.\n\nAs a p.s., His spine surgeon Dr. E. (not his shoulder surgeon) \"does not want to get involved\" so he will not confirm we reported it to him on Jack's visit 2 days later! That was the final nail in the coffin for us - and the hospital used that against us!", "business_id": "8rMSbtMFVtEien-2EfFu6w", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-08-05", "type": "review"}

Once we do that she might recommend skin tips for that season of the year or new products that have come out. Dermatologists also have a butt load of samples that they really do want to get rid of. Last time I was seeing my dermatologist Katie I had mentioned to her horror that I was going on a weekend camping trip. She of course was sickened by the fact that there are no showers in the woods, but she loaded me up travel size samples perfect for camping so fast! Whether we talk about healthy ways to be in the sun or how many times your should really exfoliate your skin I aways feel better asking a doctor my weird skin questions. \n\nNext time you have any kind of skin or complexion problem, invest your money in seeing a doctor! Your a lot more likely to solve the problem the right way and quicker.", "business_id": "6r8KHqgmlM3PWVZ7suyQ6w", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-06-28", "type": "review"}

However, as long as I've gone there, I haven't ever been completely happy with the experience. It just seemed easier not to deal with the hassle of dealing with switching, until today. \n\nI called and asked the woman at the front desk if there were any available appointments in the next couple days. She made the hugest sigh I have ever heard and said, \"Well, uh, um, we don't even have any physicians in the office until I don't know when.\" She said this is a really rude manner like I was bothering her. Then I asked, \"Well, I normally just see one of the physician's assitants, can I get in with them?\"  She says , \"(scoffs again) No. No one is in the office. What is it exactly that you need?\"  I said, \"I just need an appointment! I need a prescription refilled and somone to look at my skin!\" She then RUDELY told me that nothing was available until the end of August. I just said thanks anyway and she hung up. She really made me feel like I was out of line for asking for an appointment at all!\n\nThis is only one of my rude encounters with the ladys at the front desk at this place. One time I got yelled at for quietly talking on my phone in the waiting room. Also, I got two moles removed here by physician's assitants, only to later find out later by the doctor that it should never have been allowed. PS~ The moles ended up taking WAY longer than normal to heal, and have awful scars that are way worse than the moles were themselves. \n\nDON'T GO HERE!", "business_id": "6r8KHqgmlM3PWVZ7suyQ6w", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-06-15", "type": "review"}

So I know hospitals. I know healthcare. SO in knowing the \"in's and out's\" I added a star because working in an ER is rough goings. It's busy, understaffed, unpredictable and exhausting. I wouldn't do it again. But if one chooses that as thier nursing area of choice, then I expect better service. \n\nOnto this experience. Husband comes home with a wicked case of food poisoning. It was awful. We tried all we could at home for a few hours, but he's diabetic and at this point, I realize there is no way to keep his blood sugars in check, so I put him and a bag in the car and off we go. \n\nWe arrive and he is very weak. I go in to ask for a wheelchair because we don't need to add a broken bone from a fall onto this trip. The staff gave me one and sent me to go sort getting him out of the car on my own. Okay, well whatever I can do what I need to do.\n\nWe then sit in the waiting room for about 30 minutes before seeing the triage nurse. Not bad as far as ER waiting times can go! She assesses him, all while ignoring me. Here in lies my major frustration with this hospital. BE NICE TO PEOPLE'S LOVED ONE'S. You are treating more than just the \"patient\". Family members and friends can provide a lot of great information! I tell her his last blood sugar and that I had attempted to give him a couple glasses of regular coke to keep his sugars up and help settle his stomach. She then says we need \"diabetic teaching\". (This almost put me over the edge, but I kept my mouth shut). Amazingly his sugar was 62, so I think it is SHE who needs diabetic teaching, because if he hadn't had that sugar he would be seizing at this point. I think I know my diabetic spouse's needs a little better than her- I have been caring for him for years.\n\nThe rooms are nice- seem upgraded and clean and had a flat screen TV. Ours didn't work, but oh well. The blanket warmer is always a big plus as well. \n\nThe doctor was AWESOME. He was the highlight. Personable, fun, listened and actually acknowledged the fact I was there (The rest of the staff ignored me). \n\nOur nurse was okay. Not overly friendly, but not rude.She seemed new and not quite as knowledgeable as I would like in a hospital. \nI wouldn't trust this hospital for something serious, but they got his symptoms controlled for basic food poisoning. \n\nOur bill was over 4 grand for an hour stay that included IV fluids, IV morphine, IV Zofran (for nausea), a basic blood panel, and a urine sample. (Quite steep, but that's for profit healthcare for you!)  That is why I only work non-profit *wink. \n\nNice work on the upgraded rooms, cool doctor, and fast wait time. \nNot such nice work on being respectful to families.

OMFG!\nAnyone with medical experience - here's the $25,000 question.\nPatient - 64 overweight female complaining of extreme nausea and vomiting(almost 24 hours) and a few days unable to have a movement.  Not very alert, BEGGING for water or ice chips.  You do NO CBC.  No blood or urine test of any sort.  WHY????\n\nA blood test likely would have shown blood sugar well into the mid 400's.  A urine test would have shown ketones through the roof.  Either of these simple tests would have likely gotten her admitted on the spot to get her newly discovered diabetes under control.\nInstead - you do an X-ray to make sure there's no obstruction, give her some prescription anti-nausea drugs and laxatives and send her on her merry way.\n\nWell, her husaband brought her back to the ER - while on vacation in Washington State just 3 days later.  By then her blood sugar was well over 500, her ketone level was atrocious, her pH was dangerously low. Then she got to spend 2 days in ICU.  Intensive Fucking Care!  In a state far from home.\n\nFor what it's worth - when the hospital in WA recieved the records from PV and saw no blood or urine test was taken, they couldn't understand WHY.  If nothing else, a CBC to check for infection would have been one of the first things they did.  (And, in fact, WAS one of the first things they did.)\n\nHours in your ER for nothing.  Minutes in Washington, and she's in the ICU. She should not have been released from your ER - she should have been admitted.  And maybe with the extra 72 hours to work with, ICU could have been avoided.  And I'd be able to see my mom in the hospital.\n\nShe's out now - and on her way home.

This individual was very apologetic and extremely professional, which I can certainly appreciate. \n\nOriginal post:\nI went to a walkin clinic on a Saturday and was told I would have to go to a hospital because 1. I didn't have insurance and 2. I most likely needed pain medicine beyond what they were able to prescribe. I was in excruciating pain in my head and had already fainted that morning. My nearest hospital was PV so I went around 9am on 7/26. \n\nThere was one other person in the waiting room at the time and I was brought back to room 11. I talked to a physician assistant about my pain, in tears the entire time. About an hour goes by and nothing. I wasn't checked in on, didn't see a doctor, wasn't told how much longer I would have to wait, nothing. I've been alone in this bed for an hour crying, feeling dizzy and light headed. \n\nFinally, I get up to what I guess is the nurse's station to hear people talking about going out to some concert and laughing loudly and hysterically. I have to ask multiple times to get this older woman with short curly hair to pay attention to me. In tears again, I explain to her that I not feeling stable and that to make matters worse, I got a call that my dog had escaped and that I needed to go soon. VERY rudely she snaps at me and tells me to wait. I go back to the room to wait. She comes in with paperwork for me to sign so that I can leave. \n\nI am trying to speak with her but I am in so much pain and dizzy and crying and I ask her how much longer until I could possibly be seen she practically yells at me saying \"there are people bleeding here! We are busy!\"  Which I understand but I would have appreciated ANY update. She asks if I'm going to go or not which I explain I do not want to as I do not feel okay and ask again for a ball park on to when I could be seen as I haven't been seen yet. She throws her hands up and says \"I don't have time for you I have paperwork\" and leaves. I have NEVER been treated like that by a health care professional before in my entire life. I wish I had gotten her name so that I could properly complain about her. \n\nI was told in the beginning that because I do not have insurance, I would be billed by mail and have 10 days to pay. I am not paying a dime to PV hospital. Not only did I not get seen by a physician, but I have experienced better care and concern at the MVD! To tell a patient who tells you she feels like she is going to pass out again that you have paperwork and are too busy to \"deal\" with her? You should be appalled. I am a patient person and would have been completely understanding had someone ever told me that it would be a while to be seen. Instead, when I sought answers I was snapped at treated so poorly. I hope that this is not how everyone is treated at your hospital. \n\nIf I could give PV zero stars, I would.

Well, I KNOW I have the best dentist!\nAfter nearly 10 years of neglecting my dental health (nothing hurt, nothing looked bad...), I figured it was probably time to get a check up and cleaning with a dentist. Baseline Dental was one of the closest dentists to my house, so I decided to give it a try. \n Well, it turned out that just brushing definitely wasn't enough, and I needed something like 11 fillings. I also still have all of my wisdom teeth, and Dr. Chris said that if they aren't bothering me, why pull them out? Cool with me. I was never ever made to feel ashamed/guilty for not flossing or seeing the dentist for so long, which I really appreciated.\nThe front desk staff and Dr. Chris really worked with me to keep the price down for the dental work I needed, and helped me sign up for a dental discount plan called Careington that has probably saved my husband and me thousands of dollars over the last few years. In fact, when my husband most likely needed a pricey root canal+crown, Dr. Chris said he would try something else that cost much less, and it has held up for several years now. I completely trust Baseline Dental to recommend only the treatments that I need.\nI found Dr. Chris's bedside manner to be great and I have always felt at ease when I am there. I have never felt the slightest bit of pain when he does my fillings or gives me the big shot of numbing juice. If you think you're one of those people that is afraid of the dentist, I bet that Dr. Chris will change your mind.\nI love seeing Suzanne for my 6 month cleanings.

Dr. Peter has made such a difference in my life that I felt compelled to write my first review.  I'm not new to chiropractic care and Dr. Peter is definitely the best I've seen.  I've been an adrenaline junkie my whole life and figured all the crashes/injuries have just caught up to me.  Recently I've had to alter my workouts, reduce the amount of weight I lift or eliminate exercises because of knee, shoulder or elbow pain.  Dr. Peter takes the time at each visit to assess my current condition and addresses each area methodically.  I never thought a chiropractor could fix pain in a joint but I am experiencing otherwise!  As an engineer, I love to know 'how' or 'why' and he gives explanations for everything he is doing and answers all my questions.  He provides exercises and stretches to do on my own time to speed up the healing.  The 'crunching' in my knees is actually going away!  Additionally, he is addressing my 'longer' leg issue that I've had since childhood.  Other chiropractors said it is probably misaligned hips but would take too long and be too painful to try to correct.  If you have pain or issues you are living with because you assumed they just couldn't be fixed, I highly recommend going to see Dr. Peter.  I'm sure you won't be disappointed!!!", "business_id": "wNzNiCNab2FqXxcTlXYYEg", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-08-11", "type": "review"}

The staff and  Dr. Edmonds are very friendly, efficient and informative.  I went here because I needed 3 wisdom teeth removed. You may be wondering why 3 and not all four? That's because a year prior, I had one of my wisdom teeth removed at a normal dentist office and the experience was absolutely dreadful! So dreadful that I refused to let the dentist remove the other three at the time. The dentist at the time recommended I see a Maxillofacial surgeon due to the difficult placement of my teeth and so I could get general anesthesia to be put to sleep during the procedure.  I found this place just in passing and decided to Google them. I didn't find anything negative about them on the internet so I decided to call in and make an appointment. The initial consultation was quick and informative. The ladies at the front office know their stuff and provided me with a great quote with the breakdown of all the charges due on the day of surgery. During the consultation Dr. Edmonds thoroughly walked me through the game plan and explained to me what I had to do to prep my body prior to the extraction. The day of the extraction went much better than expected! The anesthesiologist knocked me out while I was yammering about my love of peanut butter and the procedure was over before I realized I was ever under! Dr. Edmonds wrapped my head up with an ACE bandage which looked ridiculous but due to this technique I barely had any swelling at all. The procedure went so well that I was able to go a picnic the next day with no swelling or pain! Fast-forward two weeks, it turns out my insurance covered more than originally expected  so the office sent me a check for $20 to cover the difference!

Not only that but I went for a second opinion to make sure I wasn't being fooled but modern-day medical over diagnosis. That dentist also confirmed the truth - 8 cavities and a possible root canal if the prior cavity filled was too deep to fix. Not only did they show me the x-rays but also the photos of the black holes and pits.  Several had been there for more than 6 months and probably more than a year. And I go to the dentist every 6 months - I like my teeth clean and that awesome feeling that there are no icky cavities. \n\nJust an FYI - Dr. Walker said I had stains on my teeth and they were definitely not stains.

Didn't get a call that day. Fine. Called them the next day and asked them about the fax from my doctor and setting an appointment.

She was obviously confused because asked at least 4 times in a row. For Christ's sake and all that is Holy!! Write it down if you cant remember! She then told me she couldn't find the fax and would call me back. She said \"The best number to reach you at is 602..what is your number?\" Why did she start telling ME what the best number to reach me at?\n  Nevertheless, I didn't get a call back that day. \n  I called the next morning and told them I need to set an appointment and I was supposed to get a call back the last 2 days. I was given their standard 4 repeated questions about my name and date of birth and then put on hold. She said they never received a fax. I asked why didn't get a call the past 2 days. The woman told me in a defensive tone that they called me yesterday and left a message. I had never received a call, let alone a message!!!! So my call history in my phone and voice-mails must be deleting themselves? \n  I got off the phone with them and called my physical therapist. I told them AZ-tech never received a fax to which they replied they sent the fax twice. I was livid at this point because I had to schedule an appointment with the therapists but appointment to do the MRI and kept pushing it back. \n  I then called AZ-tech back and told them that a fax was sent twice. They were confused about receiving a fax (no surprise) and they put me on hold. They finally found it and set up an appointment. I tried to let them know that they \"need to get it together over there\".

I expressed my displeasure toward the Gilbert office, so she set me up with the Tempe office at a different time. \n Today due to traffic and crazy construction I was running late to the appointment. I called the Tempe AZ-tech location to notify my tardiness. They told me that their MRI machine was down and they tried to call me the day before. They said they would set up an appointment at 10:00 at the Gilbert location a little later in the day. I was dreading it with my recent interaction. With their reputation I decided it would be a good idea to call that office beforehand. \n  When I called I told them my name and that the Tempe office had set up an appointment for me at that location today because their MRI machine was down. Literally the lady then asked, \"So you want to set up an appointment for tomorrow?\" I had no patience left and replied, \"Did you hear what I just said?\" \n So I repeated my name and everything very slowly.\n Of course she asked me my name again and then told me the appointment was set for 9:30. I told her that the other office told me 10:00. DONE. Needless to say, I didn't show up to the appointment.

Dr T was willing to do the root canal that day, but they were very busy, so I opted to schedule the root canal for the following week. The procedure itself went really well (I mean, it's still a root canal and all); Dr. T and his assistant worked like a team, and I was out after 30 or 45 minutes. Later the next week Dr. T and Johnny prepped for the crown and set me up with a temporary; I'm currently waiting for delivery of the permanent (it takes two weeks, which is fine). Johnny's temporary crown is very comfortable; he took a lot of time to make it just right, and he clearly took pride in his work.

So if you are trying to take care of something on your lunch period its not going to happen. Then when you do reach someone in the hours that they are open you have to leave a message for someone to call you back ( which is like most offices so I understand that). The kicker is that when they do call you back its about 5 mins before they close so if you miss the call and call back after 4pm then you are out of luck (since you cant leave a message) and then you have to start the process all over again. With that said, if you do reach someone it takes them a good 4-5 days to call you back.. and then when they do call back of course the suggest you come in to the office of course so you can pay another visit to the doc and pay another copay for the office visit.
