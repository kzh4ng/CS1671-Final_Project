Firstly, often when I've placed an order in their drive-thru I've found that I've had to sit and wait for my \"fast food\" for 10 to 15 minutes. After waiting for my food - on the days that I didn't leave the line in frustration before placing an order at all because I couldn't even do so in a reasonable amount of time - I've found that what I've gotten has been mediocre compared to what I've experienced at other Arby's. Common issues I've come across include the lack of sauces when I've asked for them, overcooked food, and so much grease that the sandwich begins coming apart, AND after eating I begin to feel sick to my stomach.\n \nSorry, guys.

Famous.\nTom's Diner in NYC? Famous - if only because of Jerry Seinfeld and Suzanne Vega.\nSammys? ...to... ...Pittsburghers...? \n\nBut none of my pals had ever eaten at Sammy's.

So I decided to do it myself. \n\nHere's how it went:\n\nMy corned beef sandwich featured (drum roll, please): corned beef (!!!), Swiss cheese, rye bread, sauerkraut, and Russian dressing. I double-checked my notes on corned beef sandwiches I had previously consumed in my lifetime. ALL THE INGREDIENTS WERE THE SAME. So, I asked myself: what makes Sammy's corned beef famous? \n\n1. It's not the corned beef. I mean, it was good corned beef, but it wasn't life-changing. I certainly wouldn't challenge another deli to a Corned Beef Showdown with Sammy's in my corner.\n2. It's not the Swiss cheese. I'm pretty sure that Swiss cheese served in Switzerland would be vastly superior. \n3. Maybe it's the bread. Most rye bread is thin. Sammy's has thick rye bread. And it's soft. Very pleasant.\n4. It's not the sauerkraut. My German grandmother whips up a mean sauerkraut, the kind her mom made in the Old Country 50+ years ago. Sammy's isn't anything to sneeze at.\n5. It's not the Russian dressing. Can anyone stake a claim in truly superlative Russian dressing? Maybe the Russians. But not Sammy.\n\nIt seems that I'm bashing Sammy, but I'm not. I just don't think it was anything special. I enjoyed my sandwich, but I might have enjoyed more the conversation I was having whilst eating the sandwich. \n\nMaybe, Sammy, you're famous for claiming you're famous. \n\nThat's how Paris Hilton achieved fame, so you're in good company. \n\nI think.", "business_id": "YDCxBTJmF-lLCk1Qx8vDfg", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-07-27", "type": "review"}

My sandwich was dripping with sauce and had EVERYTHING on it! I'm on a new diet and cant have all of the nastiness that was all over that poor chicken sandwich! I was now a little angry and hopped back into my car to have them correct their mistake.\n\nWhen I got there I explained to the young lady what the problem was and she was very nice. She turned out to be the only pleasant person during my whole experience. She asked the staff to fix the problem and as they were fixing it I could here them arguing with eachother about whose fault it was. Personally I dont care who messed up!!! The fact is that I am starving, upset, and now in a hurry, but all I hear is what sounds like a teenage he said you said going on. \n\nI'm very disappointed in this Wendy's because I have never had a problem with them.

Bread, cheese, meat - that's it.  How hard can it be??  When my simple little ole iced coffee came out wrong (after they had overcharged for it!) that same man smiled at me and said \"Good luck with THAT!\"  \nAs for the drive-thru?  I've had to jump out of it too many times to count because after I had placed my order at the speaker, we never seemed to move along.  If the car at the pick-up window is waiting on something that is taking an extra long time, YOU will have to wait also.  They don't have that car pull out of line for an employee to bring them their item(s) when ready.  OH NO!!!   EVERYBODY in line has to wait!!    \nDon't bother calling any 800 # about this McDonald's - it's useless.  One would think that the owner of this location would be more proactive in making it a better McDonald's, but after more than 6 years of the same kind of service (or lack thereof!)  I guess not.

The burgers had no flavor and they were poorly put together, the tacos are as flat as a sheet and the shells taste stale. The only thing I liked from the box was the French fries. We thought that the poor quality of the food was just because it was a late night special so we gave jack in a box another chance.

The chicken was a little too spiced for me... not spicy, but whatever spices they used for the chicken it just had too much. The entire thing was very bland but exceptionally the blueberries. The salad also had some flat, white, tasteless strips of what I thought was Provolone cheese but turned out to be Asiago. It really didn't add much to the salad. I couldn't detect the almond flavor even though I felt the crunch of the almonds as I chewed. The strawberries on the other hand were nice, big, plump and nicely sweet.\n\nAt $4.50 thought? I think I overpaid a buck fiddy...\n\nFrom now on, I'm sticking to burger though.", "business_id": "qib8Pu8_auDKPMBm8Ac89A", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-06-09", "type": "review"}

You need to prepare more product so you move a car to a spot to keep the drive thru flowing. \n\nSo when we got the nuggets, at least they were hot and fresh. We plowed through one box, no problem. However when we started chowing down on the second, my friend asked me to try one because the flavor was off. Sure enough, she was right. They did not drain them long enough so the grease reabsorbed into the breading. Boy, did I regret doing that favor for her. I kid you not, I almost crapped my pants. Like walking down the sidewalk, stopped dead in my tracks, I almost dropped a big one, right then and there. Thank god, I made it to a bathroom in time. When we called about it, they were very rude, claiming it wasn't their problem. All we did was tell them what happened to help the common folks' protect their pants.

Why I am not surprised that they are too lazy to cut up the bacon slices like in the picture.\n\nGoodbye forever, Sonic.", "business_id": "po5FyERB4lUZNnBIwnhFlg", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-06-30", "type": "review"}

We pulled into the parking lot of a fast food joint. Colorful 3' x 4' screens separated each parking space on the driver's side. \n\nI immediately recognized the old car hop vibe. Pulled into an empty space. Kept the engine running and air condition blasting. The screen turned out to be the menu, speaker, and ATM all in one. WHAT?!?!?! How innovative.\n\nScanned the menu for items I wanted to order.\n\nPressed the speaker button to alert the assistant inside that I was ready to order. A very pleasant, disembodied voice took my order, then said she'd be out in a few with my order. Ok, let's see how fast . . . \n\nIn the meantime I inserted my credit card to finalize the transaction. Receipt rolled out.\n\nAs promised, within minutes a sweet young lady arrived balancing a red tray loaded with 2 paper bags and a couple of drinks. She confirmed my order according to the receipt printed out on her side, then she handed over my booty.\n\nHanded her a tip and I was on my way with a Sonic burger & fries, classic hot dog with the works, condiments, a limeade and a blue coconut slush and 2 peppermint candies. Yaowzaaaaa!\n\nNo Sonic anywhere near where I live, but when they show up I'll be one of the first in line.

While visiting Phoenix over the July 4th week, this Sonic, on the North side of E. McDowell between N. 48th and N. 51st, became my go-to drink restaurant of choice.\n\nWhat is unique about this particular Sonic is that there is a drive through, but no drive through window.  Feel free to ponder this for a moment or two.  There is a menu and a speaker where you can order whatever you like, and then you pull forward to... a solid wall on the side of the building.  No window to hand them your cash, and - most distressing of all - no window where they can hand me my humongous frosty beverage.  Well, okay, I did eventually receive my beverage as one of their servers walked out the front door and handed it to me where I tentatively pulled up to the edge of the curb.  Now, I know what you're thinking - Sonic is basically a drive up restaurant where they park and bring your food TO YOU, so why would I insist on driving through?  None of your beeswax, buster, I just do.  \n\nIn addition to driving up and parking to order, there are plenty of outdoor tables, most with shade, where you can also sit, order, and enjoy your food or beverages.\n\nSo, do whatever your little heart desires: park and sit in your car, park and sit at the tables, or order at the drive through and act really confused when you can't find the drive through window.  Just make sure you try the cherry limeade - trust me on this one.", "business_id": "po5FyERB4lUZNnBIwnhFlg", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-08-02", "type": "review"}

The funniest joke about this was that he was an older Caucasian adult male. He even responded when I said 'thank you'. That is what made the difference of treatment stand out to me.

I was hoping to be in an out but the food took a long time to cook. I probably waited about 10 minutes before the food came out. The Tortas was a good size and was a mix of good and bad. The Carne Asada had good flavoring but was tough and the guacamole while good was layered on there thick. It was to the point where I got a guacamole torta with some carne asada topping to it. The fries here - well frozen Costco fries. \n\nAs to ratings, Filiberto is ok. It fills a need and nothing more.

But, here is the deal.  I LOVE my fat ass.  And my fat ass is a good American...I fucking paid for it, gimme what i WANT!  I had plans for the remains of the burrito I SHOULD have gotten.  I was gonna eat it til I got full and then sat around with the remains, watching Rome and slowly nibbling it into annihilation even tho I would be WAY too full after consuming it.  This was my plan.

I am from San Diego, and we have about 6+ last time I checked. I chose to review the one in Phoenix because it was out of the norm of doing it in San Diego (and I'm cool like that). THIS REVIEW GOES TO ALL THE CHIPOTLES THAT EXIST, NEVER A BAD ONE THAT YOU CAN GO TO. First of all, Chipotle is NOT a Mexican Food joint, BUUUUT, it is an AWESOME-food-joint. Chipotle is, how I describe it - \"THE SUBWAY OF BURRITOS\" - its McDonald's way of getting you to come it and, \"Eat Fresh\" - take THAT, Jared! I go to School in New Mexico and this state doesn't have one, they suck, they're lame, and New Mexico doesn't know what it is missing! Recommendation: I always get the Vegi-Burrito Fajita Style (adding bell-pepper and onions) and go half-corn salsa half-tomato salsa...then the wonderful people behind the counter stuff it full of LOVE and GREATNESS!! Best burrito you will ever not-finish. I HEART CHIPOTLE and no matter what, I will never STOP going! Try their Chips and Guacamole (their guacamole is FAN-TAB-U-LOUS) and another little secret: IF you're in San Diego, if you show them a College ID, your drink is FREE - not so in  Phoenix, damn you Arizonians (Arizon-inites?

I told him don't worry about it because it seemed as if I would be standing there for ages waiting for pennies. We sat down and ate and when we were finished we both had leftovers.

We were fine just talking there anyways, but when we were ready to go I went and grabbed my own containers from the counter. The employees were just hanging out at the register talking to each other.

Checked Yelp 1st, 4 stars on 11 reviews was enough to convince me. \nNice and clean when I walked in, and greeted by an extremely nice cashier! \nTheir menu is pretty simply so I decided to give their original single burger a try and their chicken bites.

They give you a little Tag to place on your table and its brought out to you. The young mad that brought it out to me was very nice and had another tray with him offering Ketchup, Napkins, utensils. \nOn to the food! Chicken Bites were SUPER Hot! That's a great thing as they were probably made to order. Tasted great once they cooled off a bit and the Creamy Gravy was pretty good too. \nOn to the Burger! Very impressed for a Fast Food Place, I'd moreso call it Quick Food instead! Made with care, fresh ingredients and a nicely cooked pretty thin patty. \nNow, on to the fries......I am a Fry Snob, let that be known.

They had a little girl with them, and I'm not good with kid ages but I would guess her to be 2 or 3 maybe? They kept walking back into the back of the kitchen with her...sometimes with a woman, sometimes a man. I assume they were the owners or something, right? None of them are dressed like they work there. They are wearing clothes that clearly don't meet health department specs...tank tops, hair hanging all over the place, open toed shoes, etc... They walked past customers in line, helped themselves to ice cream and stuff while customers had to wait to get their orders because these people were in the way. They didn't greet the customers. They didn't acknowledge the customers. That was bad enough, but then I go to the bathroom, and the little girl throws french fries over the booth into my purse. My boyfriend saw her doing it!

The condition of the structure makes me believe that it probably WAS a drive-in restaurant in the 1950s, and ownership must have changed hands several times since. It seems, though, that the present management or owner isn't too concerned about the maintenance of the external structure of the building itself.  It was nighttime, though, and the place looked OK. And since I am fascinated by mid-20th century Americana (see my review of MacAlpine's restaurant), I told my friend to pull in so we can order a snack. The menu showed items typical of most fish & chips places in this region, and the items were quite inexpensive. The burgers we ordered were about par for a fast-food joint, and the fries were quite good. As we dined, I looked around and imagined what the place must've been like half a century ago: cars with tailfins parked alongside the carport-like dining area, perhaps carhops bringing trays of ordered food to the people in the cars.\n\nI returned with my friend last week, in mid-afternoon this time. The poor state of maintenance of the building became even more noticable in bright daylight. I ordered Krab and chips (K, not C, because it's surimi, not real crab) while my friend ordered burgers and fries. I do like surimi, so my order was OK; and as before, the fries were good. My friend's burger, though, was obviously a frozen burger patty that had not thawed sufficiently before or during cooking, so it was cooked outside but raw within. \n\nA visit to the place could really be a cool nostalgic trip back to the glory days of the drive-in restaurants, if only they would give the building some needed repairs and touch-ups, and would pay just a bit more attention to the cooking.", "business_id": "ljtx2V23dmWy-IV-zdYj7A", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-08-09", "type": "review"}

The service is quick, as the counter people pass your food down an assembly line, adding the burrito stuffings right in front of you, then passing it on to you after prompt payment - cash, debit/credit cards accepted.\n\nThey have the usual fountain drinks, ice tea, beer and wine\n\nQuick, easy and tasty.", "business_id": "Cv4kZH9zN0wpN2Drn0qkLg", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-07-05", "type": "review"}

Tasty!  \n\nI do have to give a kudos to the staff here.  Clearly, they were extremely busy, and despite that, I was treated with courtesy and a smilng face!  That goes a long way for me, as I know how frustrating it can be when you are looking at a line out the door.  \n\nI also really like how thier menu's set up.

Always have, and always will.  So this review is nothing against the company itself.  I will continue to be a Chipotle customer, just not at this location...\n\nI went to this location after work on 7-22-11, around 5:45 pm.  First of all, I waited in line for approximately 20 minutes.  Not a huge deal, since the line is usually pretty long at Chipotle (particularly at this location).  And I was there during the dinner rush.  But still, an extra staff member or two helping out would've been nice.\n\nI finally got my food and headed home with my three soft barbacoa tacos.  A few bites into my first taco, I bit down on something hard and relatively big.  After spitting it out and cleaning it off, it was apparent that it was a rock about the size of a dime (Picture: http://i72.photobucket.com/albums/i175/starstruck1980/chipotle_rock.jpg).  I had several other family members inspect it as well, and they agreed that it was a rock, rather than a bone fragment.  Since I didn't swallow it, choke on it, or chip a tooth, I did continue to eat the rest of my tacos (which, despite the rock, were quite delicious).  My family members weren't exactly pleased with me for continuing to eat the tacos.  They advised me to take the tacos back and speak to a manager.\n\nHad I eaten in Chipotle, I probably would've spoken to the manager.  However, since I was at home, I felt that going all the way back and causing a scene wouldn't have been all that effective.  I didn't want to upset anyone, make a scene, and I definitely am not going to sue or do anything drastic like that.  It was probably just a mistake, but certainly a big mistake that definitely should never happen again.  They need to make sure they inspect their food better before it goes anywhere near those serving pans.\n\nI was disappointed because Chipotle prides itself on clean, fresh, organic food, which is why I'm a regular customer.  This experience has left a bad taste in my mouth (quite literally), but hopefully this was just an isolated incident.\n\nAgain, I felt that a Yelp review would be more effective than any other measure I could've taken.  I just want to make people aware of this incident and to be alert for any rogue rocks hiding in their foil wrapped tacos!", "business_id": "Cv4kZH9zN0wpN2Drn0qkLg", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-07-24", "type": "review"}
