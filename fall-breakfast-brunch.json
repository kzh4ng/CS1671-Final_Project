Way to go Justin!  The restaurant is in a strip mall across from the Dairy Queen.  The grill is right up front so you can see them cooking.   They have counter space for eating and tables/booths for 4.   Don't expect to sit at one table if you have more than 4. They have a great looking breakfast menu.   We all got burgers of varying kinds!  They were tasty!   The buns were buttered, toasted and soft.  Yum!   the amount of butter didnt bother me  but it did my whiny mother. Who whined even though there is a no whining sign as you walk in the door.   We ordered fresh cut fries as onion rings.  Both of which were great.  The half order was plenty and a nice option to a full order.   The restaurant was full of local men at lunch which is usually a good sign.  I give it a 4 star only because of the waitress who kind of threw straws, silverware and napkins at us as she walked behind the counter.  At least she didn't throw the food when it came!   She also served the fries and Onion rings way before our burgers came out which was kind of weird.   They were nice and hot but would have been cold had we waited for the burgers.

In very large part, because *everything* on the menu is made fresh daily.  This includes the ham, which the restaurant roasts every morning, complete with their own glaze.  The ham is cut from the bone to order, absolutely succulent, with a hint of clove.  The ham alone is reason enough to visit this place, but that isn't even the best offering.\n\nFirst are the pancakes, which includes specialty pancakes like apple and cinnamon and pumpkin - all of which (including buttermilk pancakes) are among the very best pancakes I've ever eaten.  The batter is prepared fresh every morning.  They have a slightly crispy exterior (plenty of butter and sugar in the batter) and fluffy center.  The apple and cinnamon pancakes are so good that I don't even eat them with syrup lest I mask the subtle flavors of cinnamon, cream, vanilla, and apples in the batter - a dusting of powdered sugar and a smear of half-melted butter is all that's needed to elicit an involuntary eyes-rolling-into-the-back-of-the-head expression of pleasure.  Seriously, these pancakes are DAMN good!\n\nSecond, all the egg entrees are fabulous!  Try the eggs benedict - that juicy ham, fresh cut from the bone, piled high atop two thick slabs of toasted Italian bread, topped with sunny-side-up eggs, and freshly prepared hollandaise.  Fantastic.  The omelets are great, and the \"jumbot\" - an \"everything in the prep table\" hash of stuff and scrambled eggs will satisfy the heartiest of diners.\n\nThe food here is really top-notch.  I realize that it's just a diner, but when I see and taste food this good, and this lovingly prepared, I want to see *everything* as perfect as most of the food.  With that in mind, I'd really like to see the restaurant offer real maple syrup - not the imitation \"table syrup\" stuff that I've seen them pour from a milk-carton-type paper container into the syrup bottles!  I'd gladly even pay a $1 premium to have real syrup with those delectable pancakes.  Also, I'd beg them to consider making their own biscuits, and possible serving them with a sausage (or sausage and herb?) gravy.  I'd *crawl* to the Dor-Stop from my home to eat there!\n\nThis place is PACKED on the weekends - be prepared to wait unless you get there very early.  The wait, however, will be worth it.  I eat here at least once nearly every weekend for breakfast.", "business_id": "2Igiyhi82R8_QaaPplRmCw", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-11-12", "type": "review"}

When I asked the waitress about the special, she had a difficult time describing it but I still wanted to give it a try. Once we ordered, it took well over 15 minutes for our food. I understand that they were very busy but that amount of time did seem a bit excessive for diner food. When my french toast arrived, it was not exactly what I was expecting per the description but, it was very tasty. The french toast had a nice crisp on it and the cream cheese sauce had a lot of flavor. However, for being APPLE harvest french toast, it was certainly lacking apples or apple flavoring. This french toast would have been perfect with slices of cooked apples on top instead of the small apple pieces that were mixed in with the cream cheese. The bacon also lacked a nice crispiness. \n\nI also had the opportunity to try my husband's banana chocolate chip pancakes. Although they looked delicious with the bananas and chocolate chips baked into the pancakes, they tasted rather salty. My husband agreed with my assessment. It seemed like the cook was a little heavy handed when adding salt to the batter. Overall, I wasn't overly impressed though, I would give the Dor Stop a second chance based on their huge selection to choose from.", "business_id": "2Igiyhi82R8_QaaPplRmCw", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-09-06", "type": "review"}

However; we knew about that situation in advance, and actually we didn't have to wait too terribly long for a table).\n\nI ordered a vegetarian (three-egg) omelette with egg whites, which came with toast & hash browns - and my husband ordered a vegetarian burrito.  We both ordered coffee, too.  The food was *delicious* & portions were quite sufficient, and the coffee was pretty good (a little too weak, but better than at most diners [and also more expensive, at $1.89]).\n\nOur server was *terrific*; she had a great sense of humor (we had a very amusing conversation with her) and she was also very attentive.  The people at the cash register (who also took names for tables) were friendly, too.  Afterwards, I complimented the wife half of the owner couple (who have owned the Dor-Stop for 26 years) and also their daughter & the (three) cooks.

Go all out, you deserve it. \n\nOn a recent visit, I also discovered the french toast menu, which has caused me to forsake my hot cake habit. The french toast is almost deep fried and covered in this raspberry yogurt. It is a can't miss item on the menu, rivaling that of the hot cake.

But hey, they definitely deserve it! In fact Dor-Stop is so good that I came here two days in a row a couple weekends ago - once for a sit-down meal, and once to get a meal to-go just so I could try a second item on the menu.\n\nI actually hadn't eaten at Dor-Stop in years until earlier this month - their hours and my schedule don't tend to mesh. But one afternoon I just happened to be using 1/2 a vacation day, so I came with a family member. Since it was the middle of the day on a Friday, the place was fairly empty, which I definitely didn't mind - this place is pretty cozy and so it gets cramped quickly during weekend dining rushes.\n\nBut on to the food, the important part of this review! My dining companion ordered a salad - complete with French fries, 'cause that's how we do salads in Pittsburgh - and I ordered their Feta Burger. Sure, their Raspberry stuffed french toast caught my eye...but Feta burger! How often do you see that on the menu? And I loved that burger, by the way - it was well cooked and the toppings blended perfectly (I snagged a few mushrooms from my companion's salad which made it even better), and definitely felt like good diner food. I left feeling super happy with my meal.\n\nBuuuuut...the next day I still couldn't get that french toast of my mind. I just couldn't. So I called in an order for pick-up - good thing I did, too, because there was nowhere to sit when I came in! Saturdays are definitely jam-packed here, understandably so. Well, I got my food, brought it home, and proceeded to devour it. Just, YUM! Seriously - that french toast is a MUST!\n\nIf I was going to complain about anything it would be that the seating really isn't the most comfortable on the planet, buuuuut...I can't hold it against them.

First and foremost, and I feel like i am stating the obvious here, the cinnamon & sugar (c&s) bagels are very sticky, especially on the bottom. With that being said:\n1. Do not store c&s bagels underneath any of the following bagels: onion, poppy seed, sesame seed, everything, or any other bagel that has \"loose parts\". When the loose parts fall off  they stick to the c&s bagel. Biting into a sweet c&s bagel and getting a bite of onion (which I dislike) is AWFUL. \n2. either wipe off the counter or place a new sheet of wax paper on the counter after prepping one of the above mentioned bagels with loose parts. Again, when you place a c&s bagel on top of these loose parts, they stick to the bagel. \n3. when someone orders a tub of cream cheese to go with a c&s, please wrap the bagel. If not wrapped, the container becomes sticky and messy from coming into contact with the bagel.\nI was a \"regular\" at the Market Square location before changing jobs and never had any of the above issues.

The interior of this place is cozily modern, and the food is fantastic:\n\n- Home fries: cooked to a mealy perfection, then smashed before frying in order to maximize their crisp-able surface area. They must put some kind of cheese in them to get it that lovely golden brown color and perfectly crunchy texture. \n- Hotcakes: kind of like a thick crepe, but better. Each bite is different - sometimes sweet, sometimes a little saltier, fruitier, other times crunchier. Delicious every single time. \n- Omelettes: Their egg white omelettes do a great job posing as normal eggs. The fillings are fresh and flavorful without overpowering the flavor of the egg. \n- Toast: Yes, even their toast is excellent. Crisp on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside. And their toast comes pre-buttered - taking care of that pesky cold-butter-on-hard-toast problem.\n\nIt's greasy spoon brunch fare at its very best. My parents ate here two days in a row, which says a lot because they're Asians from Asia and typically don't like greasy American-style brunch foods.

Friends who live or have lived in Pittsburgh rave about this place.  It was supposed to be THE PLACE for breakfast and brunch in this city.  I first visited this place on a short Pgh Apt hunting trip back in April 2013.  Went in, got excited, as the place was packed with people.  It had the classic diner feel.  It had to be good.  Sadly, it wasn't.  Not wanting to give up hope, I went back to Pamela's the next day, and went with the corned beef hash, since many yelpers had mentioned it.  Again, disappointed.  Having settled in Pgh for a few months now, I decided to give Pamela's a third chance recently.  *sigh.  I don't get how this place has such high yelp ratings.\n\nFood = (6.5/10) = As mentioned above, my first visit I tried the western omelet.  It was just ok.  Not well seasoned, and the cheese was meh.   Quantity wise, you do get a huge amount of food for what you pay for.  Second trip was the corned beef hash trip.  Really don't understand what is so great about this dish.  My third trip I tried the tex-mex omelet.  Again, eggs under seasoned, and cheese was meh.  What bothered me the most was the \"guacamole.\"  It's more like avocado paste with mayonnaise consistency.  Like something you would squeeze out of a toothpaste tube. Texture was not appealing.  The friend who came with me on this third trip ordered the pancakes, which he thought were fine.\n\nAmbiance = (7.5/10) = it's got the classic diner feel, with diner friendly waitresses/waiters.  \n\nService (8.0/10) = as mentioned above, the classic diner friendly environment.\n\nOverall opinion = I wonder if those who give high ratings to this establishment, are the locals of Pgh, and college/grad students on a budget and naturally appreciate the large quantities of food for cheap prices.  This place is just ok for me.  I'm still searching for my go-to-brunch place in Pittsburgh.  I do recommend trying this place out and making your own judgement, especially if you've just moved to the area.  There is always a wait to get in on weekends, so they must be doing something right.

Pamela's is known for stick-to-your-ribs diner food and they do it very well. Definitely my go-to for weekend brunch or hangover recovery in Pittsburgh. The Oakland location you'll find is often full of Pitt or Carnegie Mellon students, whereas the Squirrel Hill and Shadyside locations usually have a more yuppie-type clientele.\n\nPamela's hotcakes are a masterpiece. Never mind that they use pounds and pounds of butter for these hotcakes, you'll be hard-pressed to find pancakes/crepes as delicious as these. What's great is that they can be eaten alone in a savory manner, or piled with fruit and whipped cream and more butter for a sweeter breakfast experience. The lyonnaise potatoes are also something to marvel at. You can ask them to griddle the potatoes a little longer for a crispier taste, which I definitely recommend. \n\nThe omelets are all pretty standard fare here, but they do them consistently well every time I've been. Best thing is that most combinations or menu items will only run you at about $8-10, with tip and tax about $13. Pretty awesome. Only downside is that it's cash only, but since there are a couple ATM's and a PNC nearby, it can be overlooked. \n\nOverall, come here for some of the best breakfast comfort food that Pittsburgh has to offer.", "business_id": "TxKmAsKQjND5vbhBdUSyIA", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-11-27", "type": "review"}

You see, we used to go here every Friday after our first (and last) class of the day in college.  It was/is a mild obsession- a love affair of sorts.\n\nWhen we got here just before 10:00, we saw that it wasn't open yet.  It was slightly odd that we stood outside until 10:15 before they opened the door.  I think that instead of making customers wait, they should just open the restaurant later, but whatever.\n\nWe walked downstairs and got in line at the register.  I was so happy to see that nothing had changed- I ordered the mixed veggie crepe with soytang sauce, and a nonfat cafe au lait.  They only accept cash, so come prepared.  I paid, took our number, and sat down.  The space is really small, so it does fill up, but it's perfectly cozy.  Our crepes were as good as ever, and including my coffee drink, my bill came in at just over $10.00.\n\nThe owner is very friendly, and normally behind the crepe maker.  This is a great place to have brunch or dessert- they also have sweet crepes (Nutella and banana is my favorite)- so be sure to check it out.

Very recently renovated inside, the light and color scheme is much brighter across the range of booths and tables that fill the space.  While there is a menu on the wall and a take-out counter, breakfast is table service and the truly Southern ladies who wait the tables will welcome you in and invite you to pick your own table.  I've never had to wait and I kinda like being able to pick out my own digs- is it a window kinda day, or do I want to bury into the back corner?\n\nMenus are on the table and they have all the regular breakfast staples.  Omelets, waffles. eggs your style, hasbrowns, and all the usual breakfast meats. While I usually skip the meat, I do appreciate the fact that turkey sausage is always an option.  Service is speedy and the ladies who constantly walk around will make sure your drink never goes empty or that your coffee always stays refreshed- no matter if they took your order or someone else did.  Now that's some customer service.  \n\nAnother thing I really like is that they recycle newspapers from earlier guests.  I can usually find several whole local papers stacked up in a central location to be read and returned as \"community paper.\"  I can get caught up on the affairs of the day and pass it on.\n\nWhat you'll really love here is that the prices are so easy on the wallet.  When both my wife and I can have a full breakfast for under $12, with tip, then I am amazed.  Try to find breakfast for one for under $12 at some of the \"other breakfast places\" around town- their biscuits may fly, but they will weigh your pocketbook down!\n\nNow this place, like all other Showmars, serves a lunch and dinner with plenty of Greek staples, including a pita burger.  I'll save that review for another time.

The place always feels extremely comfortable to me, it's like home away from home. The right amount of brick and wood, the right amount of bustle and noise, lively but not raucous. The service is the way I like it efficient but not obtrusive. The American comfort food was of good quality and well worth the price. \n\nFlash forward to now, the tasty grilled Portobello sandwich is gone. The smallish 11 oz  prime rib is $20 and comes with only one side. Keep in mind that  prime rib is ALWAYS very fatty, I trim about 1/3 rd of it.  What was left was less than 1/2 pound. Worse is that I asked for the fried sweet potato and it's now the frozen, pre-seasoned fast food type where it used to be simply real potato. \n\nThe prime rib was as rare as I asked but -as it's often the case- the chef had rubbed way too much salt on the slab before cooking it and there's no desalting it. Most people do like it prepared that way but what about those who don't or who have to cut their sodium intake? \n\nIt's way too obvious that it's a franchise and management cuts way too many corners for the prices they charge. Physically it's still the same location but the food is like Orlando, FL.\n\nThen I think about the Texas Roadhouse. I hate that type of theme restaurants with peanuts, overly cheery (and overly young) servers ... but know what? For those same $20 I got a large 16 oz prime rib every bit as good or better as Harper's, a couple of decent sides ( the sweet potato was baked but it was a fresh potato) they threw free appetizers at me and we drank five buck Margaritas or Martinis. \n\nSo the place is messy, full of kids and has no class but the economy is tough these days. For my money I'll get my beef (or smoked pork chops) there instead of Harper's.

I was a little reluctant when some friends suggested Harper's but I decided to go with the flow and unfortunately, ended up pretty disappointed.  \n\nThey do a lot right so I don't want to totally bash them but the quality of food is just not up to par.  I was super hungry when we arrived so that should have benefited good old Harpers but apparently it was mind over matter and I have a clear picture of everything I tasted.\n\nQuick Summary:\n\nThe dipping trio:\nSalsa tasted like it came straight out of a jar...Harris Teeter or no...food lion brand.\nPimento Cheese--tasted like mustard with chunks of cheese in it\nArtichoke and spinach dip--dry and flaky..had decent flavor but not creamy\n\nThe chips were thin and greasy and mostly small pieces.  \n\nI ordered the Chicken Salad with some type of ginger soy dressing.  It was just ok.  The chicken looked like it had been shrunk...it was pretty dry.  It was basically like what you would get in a frozen fajita meal.  You know how the chicken is small, salty and fatty?  The lettuce was chopped but dry and looked like it came straight out of a bag.  The cucumbers, red peppers and onions that were supposed to be in the salad must have been playing hide n seek.  I think I had one piece of each.\n\nOthers are my table tried another steak salad, blackened chicken pasta and the burger.  Everyone pretty much had the same response...\"just ok.\"  In fact, my friend tried to justify her reasoning for choosing Harper's by saying, \"wow, I haven't been here in so long.  I remembered it being so good as a kid so I thought it would be fun to try it again.\"  Um, is that your way of apologizing?\n\n\nThe service was decent but our waitress clearly had a bad attitude.  She didn't smile once.  Half of the food for our table came out about 10 minutes before the other half so the manager offered us a free dessert.  I thought that was super classy because we didn't even have to bring it to their attention.  I can't complain about something that was free but I'll let you know we tried the warm cookie that came with vanilla ice cream.\n\n\nI know Harper's is a family favorite for so many so I don't want to burst any bubbles and I can see why people like it.  They have a diverse menu, nice atmosphere for couples or for families, nice location, etc.  They aren't super expensive but I don't think they are priced right for their quality but that's just my opinion.

Their menu is timeless as is their history in the South park area.  Yes but try telling that to the hostess who greets you by chewing gum and texting on her phone.   Yeah, I get it, sometimes you just got to get your tweet on, I agree, OMG LOL, I can't believe this guy who just came in here to get his to go order, #LMFAO.   Now don't be discouraged to dine in and sit in the bar area, where if you truly want to feel disconnected from your date, then the touch screen monitors are perfect, for you or the hostess.  After all who sits and talks with each other at dinner any more? The food is on par with an Americana type mid level restaurant, however the service leaves a bit to be desired.  When my salad came with a dried up crusted chicken breast on it and no dressing, I called to speak to a manager, but they were busy. Apparently a Tuesday night is busy for the manager (not the hostess).  The veggie burger tastes like cardboard, although the bun gives it a sort of layered cardboard effect which is not bad, if you're washing it down with tequila.  The filet even if ordered med. rare, comes out med. edible, and asking the wait staff for a refill is like asking the DMV for an estimated wait time; you're probably not going to get what you're looking for.   This is particularly sad because I used to love this restaurant, but even with prepubescent couples or online match dates who sit in the bar area to have the touch screen monitors mediate their awkward conversations,  it's still probably not the right fit.   The ribs are good, but the sides aren't.  If I was going to take anybody here, it would have to be my next door neighbor who lets their dog crap all over my lawn and never picks it up, or my grandfather who doesn't have any taste buds left and isn't bothered by slow service, because it takes him two hours to finish a bowl of soup anyway.

Unfortunately I have noticed a marked decline in the quality of their food (at both locations).  Though the portions have remained relatively generous, I would rather have a smaller amount of better food, if that is what is required to up the quality.\n\nAfter an especially harrowing few weeks, the boss decided to reward me for not going on a homicidal rampage by giving me a gift card for Harper's.  So, on a Wednesday evening right after work, off to Harper's I went to spend the balance of my gift card.  I say this only in that if I were spending my own money, rather than the boss man's, I would not have ordered a steak at Harper's, I would save that for a steak place.\n\nTheir menu is on the smaller side, but it contains a variety of beef, chicken, pork and fish dishes.   I decided to splurge and try their prime rib served with a loaded baked potato ($25).  It was an inch thick, medium as requested and looked delicious.  Upon cutting into it - bleh.  Tough and chewy, and the dull knife was not helping out.  I had to saw at the piece of meat to get bites cut and immediately dipped it into the tasty au jus (salty meat juice, yum) to get any kind of flavor.  It honestly tasted like a hunk of meat taken off of the roast beef carving station at some kind of buffet.  Harper's isn't a \"steak\" place, but I expected better.  The loaded baked potato was delicious.  \n\nFor dessert, there was a \"homemade\" pumpkin cheesecake ($6).  It was fine, nothing special.  It was not very creamy, and not very pumpkiny, but that might be a personal preference of mine as far as cheesecake consistency and flavor goes.  I wouldn't bother to order it again.\n\nMy server, Tonji, was spectacular.  She kept my ginger ales coming and continued to check on how my meal was going, without being interruptive.  The manager did stop by and ask how the meal was and I should have spoken up, but I hate being \"that girl\".  \n\nI have spent all of the $50 gift card and wouldn't intentionally return to either of the Harper's locations any time soon - the meal from the Carolina Place location on Saturday was mediocre and the dinner at the Southpark location on Wednesday wasn't anything to write home about either (though the wait staff at both locations was quite good). \n\n(Another piddly comment I have - wait staff shouldn't set up in the rest room changing clothes/getting ready for shift and gossiping.  As a paying guest, I shouldn't have to shuffle around them to get to a stall and then again to wash my hands.)", "business_id": "hIQRiE3UsYH7UsrsDwJwLA", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-10-17", "type": "review"}

I mean, it was FANTASTIC. \n\nWe only waited about 5 minutes to be seated (LOVE when that happens on a busy Saturday night) \n\nThen, the best part of the evening, our waitress came by. Brianna was her name and she was absolutely wonderful. She knew everything about every item on the menu, and was just beyond pleasant. Seriously, servers make or break my dining experience in most cases, and she definitely made it. Next time we go, (I'm not kidding) I'm going to ask that they seat us in her section if she's there. She's THAT amazing.  \n\nIt was like she was reading my mind when she asked if I was interested in trying the daily soup (potato cheddar) because I REALLY wanted to try it but didn't want a bowl of soup. She brought me an adorable little cup of soup and OH MAN it was good. It was creamy, just a little spicy, and had the perfect amount of crunchy little scallions to add some texture. Then, the real food came out. My boyfriend got the brisket which comes with your choice of BBQ - vinegar based Eastern Sauce, or ketchup based Western Sauce. He chose Eastern, and it was SO good. The brisket was cooked to perfection and he devoured the mashed potatoes and slaw he got for sides. My burger was REDONK. I mean, I ordered a burger, so I expected just a burger. I read the menu and saw that it had a Hickory BBQ sauce and cabbage, so I thought, \"yum, BBQ burger\" but I was NOT prepared for the deliciousness that graced my palette. I can't even describe how this burger tasted. They found some kind of magical combination of flavors that had me going \"oh my..\" in between every bite. I know it sounds ridiculous to say so many things about a burger, but I am so serious. Then, my boyfriend ordered a cappuccino (which Brianna made herself), and he loved it. \n\nNow, you guys know what the atmosphere is like so there's no point going into too much detail. It's awesome. I absolutely love being in this restaurant. The lighting is intimate but abundant and the tables are perfectly sized and spaced. Table spacing is a HUGE bullet point for me, and I have never been unhappy with a table here. \n\nOverall, the food was ridiculously above par (even better than the other times I've been here), and I am SO glad we got Brianna as our waitress.

And they're one of the few Charlotte brunch options that opens before 10 a.m.  They offer an extensive menu of breakfast selections, including eggs, waffles, and, of course, pancakes.  \n\nSince I'm usually an egg person for breakfast, I'm usually steered past the pancakes and waffles and go right for the omelettes or other egg dishes.  Their omelettes are HUGE.  They seem like they're made from like 18 eggs or something.  None of the omelettes really seem to have a lot inside them (the ingredients aren't overflowing), but my favorite is the sausage one.  Also tasty are their seafood crepes and Eggs Michael (Eggs Benedict with sausage instead of Canadian bacon), as well as their regular Eggs Benedict.  And, last but not least, there's the Kosher meal:  eggs with salami and potato pancakes on the side.  YUM!  I'm not Jewish, but I do love a good Kosher breakfast!  (Miami has an awesome Jewish breakfast place, too, but I draw the line at \"tongue.\")  Potato pancakes are a delicious treat -- more tasty than hashbrowns, but not as filling as regular pancakes.  \n\nThis particular location of the OPH is across the street from the high-end SouthPark Mall, so you think it would be a little more stylish, but it's got that old 80s restaurant feel to it.  A renovation in decorating is definitely needed.  OPH should feel (and look) more like a diner.  I guess that's part of my reasoning for only 4 stars instead of 5.  \n\nIf you go on Sundays, be sure to get there before the church crowd!

I really liked the scones, but I didn't like the fact that they didn't open until 7 which usually made me a bit late.  I didn't even consider that they might have more than bakery goods, and every time I had stopped the place seemed empty.  This was of course due to the fact that it was 7:01 AM and I was the first person through the door.  So this weekend, based on Chris & Kelly's recommendations, I stopped in for a nice leisurely breakfast before heading into the office.  I found out that all this time I was seriously overlooking a great place right in my neighborhood.\n\nI was a bit taken aback by the number of people inside.  The place was pleasantly crowded, with the warm buzz of morning conversations and a relaxed atmosphere.  I walked up and ordered the breakfast special - I was used to just picking out scones so it took me a minute to get my bearings and find the menu board.  The price was OK, not under $6 but not more than I would have expected anywhere else.  I was given a number and found a nice table along the bookshelves.  I'd never really taken the time to look around the place before, and I was really impressed by the decor.  I got a cup of coffee from the self-service area, which is a great idea - I love diners where your cup is constantly refilled but I tend to keep drinking so long as there's coffee in the cup, leading to the over-caffienated jitters.  The coffee was excellent, truly delicious and fair trade to boot.  I savored it while I read a magazine and waited on my breakfast.\n\nAfter a bit of a wait the breakfast special came out.  The wait wasn't especially long considering the amount of people there, but I was into my second cup of coffee by the time my food came.  It was served on a fairly large plate, so my first impression was that there was not much to it, but this was a mistake.

Most days the food is tasty if unimaginative, they can accommodate groups, and they usually can get you in and out pretty quick despite the lobby being packed to the gills on weekend mornings. \n\nFor the last few years I've avoided Perkins on the whole because of sub-par food and service from another location (an annual stop after a camping music festival due to their being open on holidays and ability to seat 10-12 of us with no reservation), but my man friend really likes their breakfast and, more specifically, not having to wait for breakfast like you do at most places downtown. Over the summer I had an avocado/queso/english muffin creation that actually really surprised me with how good it was and breakfast potatoes that were clearly deep fried but similarly surprising in how much I enjoyed them. The breakfast combo price was right ($8ish dollars), and for some reason one of the available sides was a muffin, so I came away with breakfast the next day, too. \n\nFast forward to a couple weeks ago when we stopped back in. Sadly, my breakfast find had disappeared from the menu and they appear to have done away with the bonkers muffin side. Nothing was really striking my fancy on the most recent menu, so I decided to pick one of the most ridiculous offerings, an apple cinnamon muffin that was sliced into thirds and turned into french toast. I'm sure it was terrible for me, and while the flavor was surprisingly good, muffins just aren't stable enough to hold up to being battered and so it was kind of mushy mess. Compounding my meh meal was the fact that it took close to 40 minutes for our food to arrive, tracking down our server was difficult, and my appetite was put off by how dirty the ledge under our booth was. We were seated in one of their tiny (but cool) two-person booths along the window and with the morning sun pouring in I could see all the crumbs, bits of paper, and rusty bobby pins on the window sill. If anyone from Perkins happens to read this, please, please clean that up. The fact that the pins were rusty tells me it's been awhile since a vacuum has made its way to that area. Yuck. \n\nWhile my most recent visit was definitely a two-star experience, they've been just fine on other visits so I'll leave my overall rating at a three.

The dining area is small so it isn't like they have a 100s of diners at a time, but they always have 20 or so workers working and their service is still terrible and unorganized. I went there a couple of weeks ago and when we walked in not one person said hi to us, and the lady behind the counter was on the store phone (understandable) but after she got off the phone she just walked away...another worker came up near the Counter to ring someone out & still said nothing to us. By the time the first worker had came back, 2 other families had came in after us and then started to seat them first, telling us we had a wait time of 10 minutes! I had to raise my voice to let her know we had been there first and had been waiting several minutes. I went there again 2 days ago. My friend got her food about 10 minutes before I got mine & the waiter had just walked past setting the food on the table without even asking if she needed anything else right away. She had no silverware and our waiter then disappeared for 10 minutes until he brought my food, at which point her food had gotten cold. She was able to tell him we needed silverware when he dropped off my food, but took several minutes to bring it back to the table and then did the same thing he did before-set it on the table and walked away. All my food was cold besides my eggs, and my toast was cold, hard, and only one piece had been buttered. When we told one of the waitresses we wanted to talk to a manager (because our waiter was MIA once again) the manager came over and listened to our complaints and then said \"Oh well someone ordered toast with no butter so yours had to be remade\" and then walked away. No apology, just an excuse for piss-poor service! She did end up giving us 15% off our meal but acted like they hadn't done anything wrong.

Of course my first thought was to look it up on yelp and I was pleasantly surprised to find that it had 4.5 stars.  As we drove closer to the restaurant however I got a bit nervous because it had more of a diner look than I preferred.  It's not that I don't like diners.  It is more so that the food can be hit or miss; though I guess the same can be said of most restaurants.\n\nWe walked in and the entrance was packed with people hungrily waiting for their seats.  The hostess was very sweet and was seating pretty quickly which was nice.  They have a good sized menu with of course the normal breakfast fare.  There was also a specials board across the room that caught my eye with its chorizo special.  I am a HUGE fan of chorizo!  I ordered that and was given the green light by the waitress as she raved about how good it was.  \n\nWhen my food came it had a layer of hash browns, covered with eggs, and topped with chorizo.  I had never seen it served this way before and I honestly can't say that I thought I would like it this way.  Well I was wrong.  Like super wrong!\n\nThe dish was amazing!  I mean like so much flavor on the hash brown, eggs, and chorizo.  It was so good that I was pretty silent at the table while I sat and devoured the deliciousness!  I asked the others at the table how their food was and they seemed to like theirs as well.  One got steak and eggs for $7.99 and another eggs, bacon, and potatoes for around the same price.\n\nI am very much looking forward to finding myself in Cottage Grove soon so I can have this dish again .

The oatmeal was really good, no quick oats here. And I ended up buying a \"ChiChi the Chihuahua \" dog for the car trip. Trust me.

They have flecks of meat in them which is what makes them good.  This is the reason that i like southern cooking.  The biscuits and cornbread are also very good.  I would avoid all other of their meat entrees, particularly their meatloaf which has a really weirdly fluffy and light consistency, as if meat had been aerated and transformed into a different substance with different properties, and the \"chicken n noodles,\" which is like condensed chicken soup from a can, but with extra slime.  Beef stew is a disaster; even the waitress described it as \"fatty.\"  \n\nDesserts are insanely huge and can be shared if you are a family of 4.

I tried several times over the course of two months following my last visit to register a complaint at the crackerbarrel.com feedback page .. that .. when submitting the feedback.. threw a 'web server 501' error (likely meaning a programming or setup error malfunction on the server prevented the operation from finishing).  Finally, in August 2012, the 501 error was fixed and they received my feedback .. albeit 2+ months late.  They promptly responded in snail mail a FREE 1 PERSON MEAL coupon to be used sometime before 1-13-2013.\n\nWell ... today ... Nov 24, 2012 was the day I returned to Cracker Barrel to give them another chance at making a Rib Eye dinner for me.  My girlfriend ordered a Meatloaf meal.\n\nOur meals were .. .much much better (at least mine was) than last time.  The Rib Eye was cooked to medium (as I like).  I could use a steak knife and cut it rather easily.  It had good flavor.  I also had cornbread muffins and a baked potato with butter.  Cornbread muffins *always* tend to be a little dry and tend to clump in the back of my throat. Usually I need a drink handy to wash it down as it clumps.\n\nMy girlfriend really like the meatloaf meal she ordered.  Thought it was a good change from what she considered to be normal.  It was quite tasty and the vegetables she selected were also very good.\n\nThe only chink in the armor of my meal was the baked potato.  It was very very well cooked (or nuked.. not sure if they use a confection oven or a microwave oven) with the ends of the meat of the potato being very hard (like an over nuked or over baked potato gets) and the skin (which I do eat) was extremely tough.  When I asked the server for a new potato, I said \"the potato's skin cuts like leather\". When coming to that conclusion, it took quite a bit of downward force on the knife to cut through the potato.  A baked potato shouldn't offer so much resistance to being cut.\n\nAfter the server replaced the potato, the replacement was absolutely fine. No problems.\n\nThe only other chink was service.  Service wasn't spectacular. Generally, I give servers a standing rule that if they see my drink nearing or beyond half full, bring another without asking me.  Eventually, I'll slow down and on my last drink it'll take a long time for me to get down to the halfway mark.  This particular server had a hard time keeping me well lubricated with my Coca Cola. There were many times I waited for the next Coke to arrive for a few minutes.\n\nIn general, this visit to Cracker Barrel was somewhere near average.  Not great. Not awful.  Had my first baked potato been edible an the server kept me sufficiently lubricated with a constant flow of Coke .. they'd have received 4 stars.  Because it didn't .. this was a great improvement over the last time .. but didn't WOW me.\n\n3 stars.", "business_id": "u-y1z3usKenHtOGrH5Vveg", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-11-24", "type": "review"}

 the memories.  the people, the conversation, the bonding.  all of it.  i was introduced to merry ann's by upperclassmen who used to come here and just talk about stuff.  just you and some friends fitting no more than four to a booth and talking about life, about school, about what lay ahead, and bonding over a stack and a smoke (back when you could smoke in restaurants.)  as a student, you couldn't get to merry ann's unless you had a car (which i didn't) so it meant something to me when i would be invited to join them.  when you're young and a few hundred miles from home and living by yourself for the first time, it was nice to have a place where you can open up or just sit back and enjoy conversation.\n\ni've spent many a good time and never a bad time here.  i enjoyed everything about it.  i liked that it was 24-hours, so you could head over after the bars closed, or in the middle of the afternoon (i've done both, and maybe once or twice during regular breakfast hours.)  i liked the fast and friendly service, which it was for the most part.  i liked that they always asked if we wanted our checks split.  i liked that townies ate here; made from bits of real townie, so you know it's good.  i liked the menus that never changed, except for when they got laminated.  i liked watching the cooks assemble a stack like an artist at work.  i liked sitting on the left side a little more than sitting on the right - don't know why.\n\ni leave you now with a couple of do's and don'ts for merry ann's; some words of wisdom if you will.  do eat here.  do not judge it until you do.  do try the diner stack at least once.  do not box or take it to-go (it won't be the same.)  do make sure at least the driver is sober enough to make the drive here.  do not eat all by your lonesome (invite someone.)  do expect to wait for a table (and if there's no wait then it's all gravy - see what i did there?)  do not go there to study.  do respect the staff and other patrons.  do not overstay and take up a booth if there's a long wait formed.  do tip well.  do not sit in silence.  do engage in good conversation.  do NOT talk about fight club.  and do come back now, ya hear?\n\nso many words for a little diner in central illinois.  i promise future reviews won't go this in-depth or off-tangent, but this was more about paying homage to friends, to this place, and to memories from way back when.  i know to some, it's just a diner.  not me.  yeah it was far.  yeah it was never really clean.  yeah it was just diner food.  but to me it was more than just that.  the time i spent at merry ann's was always...comforting.", "business_id": "vBg5V39Vf4eTx1JVgl_5Pg", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-09-20", "type": "review"}

She told me that she could combine all of the punches on one card for me so that I could come back the next time and redeem it. That was SO generous of her. When I grudgingly paid, the host also looked at the signature line of my credit card that said \"SEE ID.\" So, she asked me, \"Do you want me to look at your ID?\" I answered no.

The Le Peep up near Northwestern was one of my favorites. The menu was a bit pared down compared to its northern counterpart, but it had all the usual egg, pancake, and crepe dishes. You can also get flavored coffee, though with a few less options.\n\nI went for the irish benedict and a cafe mocha. Both were about on par with the usual high standards that come with the name. One issue was that the poach was perfect on one of the eggs but a little overdone on the other. Not a huge deal, but the yolk mixing with the corn beef hash is the star of that meal. \n\nThe only thing that makes Le Peep lose points with me is that I got tagged a little extra for exchanging the ever-present diced potatoes for fresh fruit. After corn beef hash, an english muffin, two poached eggs, and hollandaise sauce the last thing I need are these dry, starchy and very overrated potatoes.

I had read the reviews on yelp before I went, but my friend really wanted to check this place out.  \n\nMy first impression:  There are at least 7 empty tables and a totally empty bar.  The hostess asks us how many, and are we here for drinks, tapas, or full meal?  I tell her tapas, and she tells us it's going to be 5-10 minutes, would we like to have a drink at the bar?  Sure, we walk past several empty tables and sit at the empty bar.  We are impressed with the blue light coming out from the bar top, when a \"bartender\" walks past and LITERALLY THROWS a drink menu onto the bar near us.  And keeps walking by.  I wasn't shocked because I had read the reviews, but I thought that was totally rude.\n\nI asked another guy walking by for a glass of water.  He was able to ablige, and by the time we got our water, amazingly the empty table behind us was available.  We sat, checked out a menu, ordered 3 tapas, and my friend ordered a beer and I ordered a glass of wine.  It took quite awhile for just the drinks to get delivered.  I was disappointed in the amount that they called a \"glass\" was about half of a glass I've gotten at other restaurants.  And when I was looking at the wine list, I asked for a recommendation, and said I didn't like fruity reds, I preferred more on the dry side.  I took a sip of an incredibly fruity red wine.  Sigh...\n\nWhen the food arrived, it was alright.  Maybe I just expect more.  It was okay food, just not as tasty as I've had elsewhere.  There were no outstanding flavors, or a bite of food that made me sit back and go \"wow.\"  Just ...average.\n\nThe waitress asked if we wanted to see the dessert menu.  Sure, why not.  We went with the dark chocolate cake.  About 20 minutes later, we finally got the cake.  What took so long?  Who knows.  Maybe they had to bake the cake after we ordered it...  Anyway, I have NEVER left a piece of chocolate cake on a plate at a restaurant before.  My friend said the cake tasted like deli meat to her.  How does one make cake taste like deli meat?  I have no idea.  It tasted out right burnt to me.  Burnt cake peeled out of a pan, with some hersey's syrup on top to cover the taste.\n\nI ask for the check.  She came by with the check, I gave her my credit card, and away she went.  Another 15 minutes passed, and she had walked by our table about 5 times.  The next time she walked by, I asked her for the credit card receipt.  She was totally suprised, and hadn't realized she had never given it back to us.  She was sincere, it was just annoying.  \n\nI wasn't impressed with the food, and somewhat unhappy with the service.  There was dancing (salsa or something) starting as we were leaving, but I wasn't in the mood for it.  I don't know if I would recommend this place.

We decided we could easily wait so we snagged two tables outside and ordered drinks.  The waiter delivered the drinks and took our tapas order so he could put in the order as soon as the kitchen opened which was a marvelous idea!  Before you knew it we were sipping on Sangria and our food began to arrive.\n\nWe tried the cheese plate which was outstanding.  I could have just eaten that and been happy.  The mussels were grilled which had a pleasant taste but the grilling did dry them out.  The biggest disappointment was the Spanish tortilla, the traditional egg and potato omelet of Spain.  This had been prepared like more of a quiche and no one at the table liked or ate it.  I adored the fantastic lamb meatballs, we even ate the sauce with some of the bread which came with the cheese plate.  The other tapa I tried were the marinated olives which were not nearly as good as I had expected.  The marinade was so vinegary, not a smooth flavor at all.  I would not order that again.  We shared everything but there were some dishes I didn't try as I had ordered paella for my entree.\n\nThe paella was really really good.  It had a spicy chorizo but it did not overpower the overall rich saffron/olive oil taste of the dish.  The rice part was outstanding and the chicken and seafood were generous and tender. What a treat!  I had partaken of too many tapas so my husband had to finish mine, now that is a generous portion.\n\nWe had a great meal, my sangria mellowed me out after like 4 sips, the Illini had won and the weather was beautiful.  When the sizable check arrived I might have blanched at bit under normal circumstances but my husband and I just laughed and put it on a credit card.\n\nIt was a great meal with the family but very expensive.

Service was super slow and less than stellar: 2/5\n\nWe arrived around 11:30 on a Sunday morning and were told we would have to wait 20-30 minutes since we hadn't made a reservation. Ok, fine that seemed reasonable enough and maybe would be a testament to the quality of the restaurant, I figured. Time easily killed by a walk around downtown. The hostess said that we could leave our phone number with them, and they would call us when it was our turn to be seated. A nice touch, I thought.\n\nWe never received that phone call, but wandered back of our own accord some 15-20 minutes later, and our table was ready. We received menus promptly, and then spent the next fifteen minutes waiting for our waiter. \n\nWhen he finally showed up he did apologize for not coming by sooner, asked us if it was our first time there (yes, for myself and one other in my party), and then proceeded to describe Radio Maria's menu: the uniqueness of the Mexican inspired breakfast items, the deliciousness of the omelettes, etc. I think I would have really appreciated that primer if I had not already had the opportunity to read over the menu several times while we had been waiting for him to show up. He seemed really startled when we informed him we were actually ready to order, because clearly he was not ready to take them, citing the drinks he had to bring to another table. So cue another wait...\n\nAll in all, we saw two tables that had been seated after us order food, receive their food, finish eating, and pay in the before we had gotten ours. Which points to less of a systemic problem (because, clearly, some patrons DO get their food in a timely manner), and maybe more of an individual issue. Our waiter did seem very harried, and I would venture to say even distressed, so maybe there is an issue with the division of work. I did notice that another employee stepped to help with water refills, but during only the last quarter of our meal.\n\n\nFOOD : \nWe ordered: two veggie masa boats, vegetarian Eggs Benedict, Mexican coffees,and a side of beer bread.\n\nRated from best to worst:\nVeggie masa boats (4.5/5): perfectly cooked eggs, and the masa black bean and tomato combo worked for me. What did not work: the goat cheese. I actually would have liked something a wee bit less salty and more melty, but I was in the minority at my table on this one.\n\nVegetarian eggs Benedict (4/5): I guess I am used to versions with meat, but I could have done with a little more salt or other sort of seasoning. The slice of tomato/avocado combination didn't do anything for me.\n\nBeer bread (2/5): really dry and cakey\n\nMexican coffee (1/5): Came with a half-inch of spice grounds at the bottom, and was cloyingly sweet (The upside to this is that a refill of regular coffee, added to the grounds, makes for an actually drinkable beverage).\n\n\nOverall... meh.

I didn't feel like messing with that and elected against it.  Probably a good thing since I overheard the table next to me complain about how bad the bar service options were.

That being said, of all the more expensive places to eat around town, Radio Maria takes the cake for me. First off, the restaurant has a GREAT atmosphere. The setting/lighting is damn near perfect and they have great outside seating if the weather is nice. There's weird kitschy crap all over the walls and table too, which I mean as compliment. On top of that I've never had anything but a pleasant experience dealing with the staff.

Every time I look at the menu (for tapas especially) it's a lot of fun. For those who don't know there are two menus regularly available here, one that is a more traditional appetizer/entree menu and on that is for tapas dishes. There's good variety in terms of vegetarian and non-veggie dishes and the prices aren't outrageous for a place of this caliber. The paella is a definite must every time I go and on one day of the week (Tuesday?) they have 1/2 off wine bottles! Speaking of booze they have a full bar and a great selection of wines and beers as well as house infused liquors rotating every week or so which is really neat. While cocktails are always the thing to break the bank sometimes I just can't resist! All in all this is a great restaurant and one of my favorite CU establishments. I certainly won't be dining there very often but on a special occasion they're always high up on my list of options.\n\nP.S.

When we talked to the waitress about our disappointment she seemed flustered and then admit to us that she agreed it was weird to serve pita with the cheese but they were out of the crackers (we weren't even referring to the how weird it was to get pita with the cheese plate at this point) and then she continued to ask us if we wanted her to serve the bread that was supposed to come with the bread and butter... She then brought us out some cold, but real bread. Still not sure why this wasn't served in the first place...\n\nIn summary:\nService: Terrible \nFood: Pretty good, despite the fee makes that chef made \nAtmosphere: Very nice! You can choose to sit in a casual area or a dining room\nPrices: Pretty expensive for the amount of food you're getting", "business_id": "AB5RgQ0ZnMThdqgFS3cPuw", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-11-04", "type": "review"}

I felt if we were bothering her by showing up. She was slow to seat us and walked like a sloth. \n\nAs we sat down we over saw a few waitresses talking about how one has no one or nothing to do and the other two telling her to just go find something to do. \n\nOur waitress came over after a good 5 to 7 minute wait. ( not any of the girls that where bickering from earlier.) we asked for water and that took a few more minutes. \n\nWe ordered our meals and I did asked for them to use sour dough bread instead of the regular bread for the double-double bacon BLT. \n\nThis must have really caused an issue in the kitchen. It took 45 minutes to get our order out. I looked around and saw other people leaving, some left half the bill in cash and took off. Waitresses bad talking customers and the manager yelling at them to pick up orders. Clean this and clear that table. I feel the Manager had no control.\n\nI was really angry at this time.

Their 3003 N Central Ave. # 118 Phoenix address can be very misleading. There isn't any signage or entrance on N. Central Ave.  Instead, it's all on the side street, Catalina Dr.\n\nCranberry Hills offers breakfast and lunch for dine-in, to-go pickup or delivery and catering. For breakfast, they offer a selection of omelets, egg sandwiches, baked goods and fruit. Their lunch menu consists of standard items such as cold sandwiches, salads, pasta, pizza, soups and bakery items. \n\nEverything on the menu is extremely reasonably priced. You can walk out the door with a huuuuge salad for less than $7. They also offer their salads in half sizes as well. The food is all around average. The ingredients could be a little fresher at times, and I'm not too keen on the amount of iceberg lettuce that gets thrown into their salads. However they don't skimp on the toppings. Those extras get piled on top. This place is also CROWDED at lunch time. Everyone in that office park seems to eat there daily, and the parking is awful.\n\nMy favorite on the menu is #48 - the Orchard salad with a standard bed of greens, chicken strips, oranges, apples, jicama, dried cranberries and walnuts, served with country French dressing (that I usually switch out for their Roasted Red Pepper Fat Free dressing, just so save those extra calories). \n\nI've also used this place for catering before and for the price it's very economical and fast. They will drop off your order and set up a really awesome and professional salad bar complete with all the fixings - salad mix, nuts, cheeses, an assortment of dressings, turkey, ham, chicken, fruit, tortilla strips, etc. I've also used Cranberry Hills Catering for those last moment \"oh no I forgot to order lunch and the meeting is in 4 hours from now\" situations. They've saved the day for me countless times!\n\nI wouldn't go out of my way to get their food for just an individual order.

I got the half sandwich and soup.  Vermont chicken and side of chili.  Let me just say that the chili is TO DIE FOR!  I ate it first and then dove into the sandwich.  Sandwich was AMAZING as well!  The only thing I would have done differently is order a different type of bread.  I got the 12 grain and it was a little messy trying to eat since the bread squished down on top.  I'd either ask them to toast the bread or get it on a roll instead.  Either way, the chicken salad is HEAVENLY!  She got the clam chowder in a bread bowl and said it was very very good also.  \n\nWe WILL be back and I'm going to suggest this place to cater our next meeting to our admin folks.  It was amazing!!!", "business_id": "I4L_MJOZsnux3xCU2bLP8Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-09-06", "type": "review"}

We both get iced tea and it tastes funny, like it was made with bad tap water. When the food arrives, Hubby inhales his quesadilla, but says nothing about its quality. The Oreo pancake is sadly the best thing on the table. I gingerly attempt to scrape off the runny, nasty substance they are passing off as country gravy. The only thing that is prepared close to well in my meal are the poached eggs. The turkey sausage is gross and the bacon is somehow not right- it's not crispy and the taste is off. The biscuits taste like they are from a mix. To top it off, the server places a mostly empty pitcher of water that is no longer ice water on our table. Nice.

I'm going to actually review while eating the food for the very first time. That's right, I just got home from Scott's Generation after waking up on a girlfriend's couch with a brutal hangover and a huge craving for matzo ball soup and chopped liver. I picked up a to-go order, and they're sitting in front of me right now, eagerly awaiting my noshing session.\n\nRight now, Scott's Generation is happily sitting at 5 stars. The employee handling my to-go order was awesome and seemed amused at my hangover remedy. Despite the fact that I love challah like a brother and could eat chopped liver for breakfast lunch and dinner, my parents insist I am not of Jewish heritage. However, there's never been an official paternity test, so I'm still holding out hope. On to the food!\n\nThe soup is fantastic! Lots of chunky veggies and chicken in a very tasty broth. The matzo balls are large with good texture. I would prefer a bit more seasoning, but I won't deduct a star because for all I know I'm just an Italian schmuck who doesn't know what a true matzo ball should taste like. But yeah, seasoning is good.\n\nOpening my bagel chips and...wtf? Is that a cinnamon raisin bagel chip! Sorry, deducting a star. Bagel chips are for soups and spreads. I don't care who you are, nobody wants a raisin in their soup. Throw them out!  Eating the chopped liver and....giving the star back! It's delicious and I haven't even mixed in any onion!  I don't think I realized how dense a half pound of chopped liver would be, I kind of wish I would have got some rye for a sandwich. Sorry, internal monologue creeping into review, I'll stop that now.\n\nFive stars for my first ever present-tense review! I can't wait to go back to Scott's to try the rest of their (very large) menu! Though for this trip, I'm glad I got out when I did. I was half drunk and the rainbow cookies were calling my name.

It was excellent!  The beef was tender, flavorful and not dry, and the kishke was sliced,browned and skinless.  This is what I've been waiting for.  \n\nWhile at our table we had a great view of the deli cases and menu boards and I knew I would have to order some food to go for my Mom and for me.  I ordered the Mish mosh soup and that was just okay - the matzo ball was grainy, the kreplach was mostly dough and there was only one of each and no kasha like I'm used to when I order this soup back home.  The chopped liver was good, my Mom and her husband liked it a lot, but I think Don and Charlie's has the best chopped liver in the Phoenix area.  The best thing I brought home was the belly lox!  If I'm going to eat lox, it's going to be the real thing and taste like lox - not the tasteless nova lox that's served to the masses.  It was wonderful and salty and full of flavor and I have enough left for a sandwich tomorrow morning :)\n\nOverall this is the closes to a real Jewish Deli I've been to here in AZ - and I will for sure be back and try the corned beef/pastrami and potato pancakes next time!", "business_id": "PxeX1M8WtyPxX1MuuGIh-g", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-11-13", "type": "review"}

That speaks volumes of coolness.\n\nThere is little to distinguish this from any other Denny's, and during the day it is the mild-mannered place we are all familiar with.  But at night, and particularly in the wee hours of the morning, the alt crowd arrives.  Many people from Goth and LGBTQ clubs pile in here for food at that time after dancing and socializing.  My wife and I went here after our visit to Sanctum--she walked in with her Gothy attire and no-one batted an eye.  The place had quite a crowd at 2am and they were mostly a fairly young, hip group.\n\nFood was. . .Denny's.  Service was fine.  If you go here at 2am, you know you're not going for the food in particular but for the crowd and maybe some people watching if you're into that sort of thing.  If you're looking for a great place to get some post clubbing eats, Jenny's definitely hits a Grand Slam.

It all comes together in a fun and eclectic building set far back from the street and the rest of the shops in the area.  You definitely feel, as you enter the candlelit courtyard beneath an enormous old tree, that the world outside does get a little more muffled than it really should be.  Wandering bemusedly through the tiny shop behind the courtyard, I was really struck by how unique this place felt in Phoenix.  Care is obviously put into not only the choice of wares being sold here, but the quality of food presented to the customer.\n\nWhen I finally got around to the deli counter, I was about to order their specialty duck sandwich when I saw they had a reuben.  As I find it hard to turn down a reuben anywhere, I asked the woman behind the counter what she advised.  Without hesitation she said, \"The reuben.\"  Just as I had hoped and I'm glad I listened.  The sandwich was excellent.  Perfectly proportioned and fresh as possible without going backwards in time.  Making a good sandwich really is an art and the workers here are masterful as their craft.\n\nSitting outside at night with a wonderful sandwich in this strangely out of place shop is an opportunity not to be missed.

The floors, the tables, the walls - everything just looks old and worn.

With a perfect patio to enjoy lunch on a nice day and a gift shop with unique finds to browse through while you wait for your sandwich, it's an enjoyable experience all around. \n\nThe food here is freshly made and up to gourmet par. They have a selection of cheeses to satisfy any dairy like and the wine is equivalently nice. I like to visit the Duck when I want a quality lunch and need it in a short period of time. My go-to sandwich is the ham and brie with honey mustard. It's a big sandwich too so I always have a left-over afternoon snack. They have a huge selection of drinks and chips -- including baked lays and for the times when my sweet tooth takes over, they have a variety of brownies, cookies and candy as well. \n\nI always enjoy browsing through the gift shop and it's a perfect stop if looking for a unique gift that's off the beaten path. Duck also supports local AZ so they have several events throughout the year with local businesses and promote other local happenings around town. \n\nThe wine bar is intimate and full of spectacular vinos.

It seems we are forever looking for a place that has good prices and a quiet place for us to brainstorm and raise our energy. We have stumbled upon Duck and Decanter. \nFinding this restaurant is only half the battle, the other is where the heck the front door is. I felt I was intruding on the outside patrons, only to realize I had to meander through, taking a glimpse at what they were devouring to get to the front door, an added bonus I suppose. \n\nOpening the front door to a happily buzzing place seemed like quite a treat. To your right is small wine area, to the left were barrels and stuff. A bit confusing, but basically it is like walking into a deli shop of olden days. I had no idea what I was doing. I stood in line and squinted at the barely visible menu of an array of deli meats, smoked meats, salads and more. Of course being gluten intolerant one can hope she has hit the conscious jackpot..but not today...I will just have the insides..no bun! But wait! I see smoked duck and wait..I can order the sandwich of my choice and have it made into a salad. Well that is a great compromise! \n\nOf course to know me is to know I am gunna ask a lot of questions, my main concern, does the smoked duck use nitrites, nitrates or any of those other nasty carcinogens. Rather shocked by the question, the gentleman serving me has no idea and had no intentions of looking. Damn! I was really hoping for the duck! \n\nI quickly go with plan B as I weigh nitrites or high fructose corn syrup and soybean oil..with that it was the tuna salad. \n\nYou can not pay for your meal in advance as the idea is to meander the store..so I did. there were barrels of tea and coffee ready to be ground at your request. I was not impressed with the coffee grinder on the floor-ewwww. There was also an espresso area but it was not operational. \n\nThere are gadgets to buy for your kitchen, and packaged condiments and foods that I presume they make fresh there. There are fountain drinks , bottled drinks, good assortment of water and non alcoholic beer, and loads of sugary add ons within tempting reach right at the cash register-brilliant! And there is not tempting this fort Knox (well the rice cripsy treats looked..nooo must...resist...\n\nI get my food, pay and go up stairs. There are different levels and two places to sit outside, which makes this place even more interesting. \n\nI open my package and there right on top are two pieces of bread stuck to my tuna. I read the entry for the Entree salad and it said nothing about adding in the bread. I ordered the salad due to the fact I can not tolerate gluten. \n\nToo hungry to care, I peel off the bread and I dive into my food and I am shocked at how awful it is. What is that mushy stuff? I think it was water chestnuts in my tuna salad. Who puts water chestnuts, (if that was what it was) in their tuna salad? \n\nI was unimpressed with the fact that the tuna salad was put on a bed of spring lettuce (which is a thumbs up for this nutritionist), some sliced celery and string cheese. Cheese?!? Who eats cheese with their tuna? \n\nThe tuna itself was extremely dry and too salty for my liking, and I had a tough time getting it down, and eventually I got so turned off I did not finish it. There was no dressing and no taste.  I ended up not eating the salad either. What a waste of  $10.00 including guilt tip! At least the company I was with was fantastic! \n\nSome restaurants ask you if you have been to their establishment before so that they can have the opportunity to give you the best experience possible. I truly believe this is something Duck and Decanter could adopt. Maybe I was supposed to order dressing, I have no idea. Since I had never been there before and did not know what I was doing. \n\nI did ask someone else about the ingredients and she took the time to look and confirmed my suspicions-sigh. \n\nI can't wait until there is a conscious shift to what we are putting in our bodies and those who are Celiac or gluten intolerant can eat without anxiety! \n\nIs this a place for those who are Celiac or gluten intolerant? \nNO there is not enough awareness of ingredients, and handling of food. \n\nBathrooms? yes weird..outside of the building, but clean. \n\nWould I return? \nNo but for the sake of my friends, which is way more important, I will and eat some where else first.", "business_id": "HIiVx2mseVWKtx8TKfWC_A", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-11-16", "type": "review"}

Theres seating in both the lower and upper levels of the place as well as a nice patio outside that will often have live music.  The staff has always been friendly and the mood is always casual and relaxed.\n\nThey serve breakfast and lunch items, but a true experience here is all about the Nooner sandwiches.  You can customize your own or get one of their signatures.  The Duckling is one you have to try once.  Duck, turkey, cranberry walnut relish, cream cheese and greens on walnut bread.  To me its almost like Turducken in a sandwich.  For custom sandwiches, I recommend the smoked turkey or roast beef.  There's a plethora of breads to choose from (I'm a sourdough guy) as well as a bunch of toppings to choose from.  Be sure to study the menu before ordering as the sandwich combinations are endless.  They also have some hot sandwiches to choose from if you wanna go that route.  Oh, and they always throw in the pickle and taffy are free.\n\nSo if you're around 16th Street and Camelback and looking for a freshly made sandwich or just a casual hangout spot, drive into the Sports Authority shopping complex until you reach the southeast corner of the complex and you see Duck & Decanter's original location.  Beware this place does get busy during the work week, but you can order ahead for pickup.  Its great to see this valley gem thrive and still stay true to its roots as long as it has.  Hopefully Randy's family will continue the business long enough for me to take my own kids here one day.", "business_id": "HIiVx2mseVWKtx8TKfWC_A", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-11-20", "type": "review"}

If you notice my last review, I have been ordering these for over 10 years.  \n\nWhen I got home, I noticed something was off.  No cranberry sauce!  I called to restaurant to ask if they changed their recipe.  They said no.  Then I mentioned that there was no cranberry sauce, just extra cream cheese - he said \"oh we are out of cranberry\".  He was genuinely concerned that I wasn't told when I ordered.  I threw out the sandwiches and went on with my day.\n\nToday, I came in, ordered a duckling, and confirmed that they have all the ingredients, and they did.\n\nNow I get home, and while there is cranberry, it barely covered the piece of bread there is barely any there.  They did add extra cream cheese again to make up for it...\n\nDuck and Decanter... I love you guys.

For my entree I ordered the eggs benedict with black forest ham, spinach and a hollandaise. I was expecting a normal size plate since it is the only main course. What I got was a bonzai deconstructed benedict. There was a tiny silver dollar sized puffy pastry thing. Next to it was a round piece of black forest ham a little larger tan a quarter. Next to it was cooked spinach about the size of a thumb nail. Then came a poached egg which did have a runny yolk but a snotty white. One of our friends actually sent hers back.

The fries themselves were overcooked and tasted like Jack In The Box fries. Generous amounts of catsup were required to make them somewhat edible. For the entr\u00e9e I tried the server-recommended lamb chop, which I requested to be prepared medium. When it arrived, it was clearly not medium.

The mansion itself is a feast for the eyes, with its spanish colonial, californian, and mediterranean architecture.  Built in the late 1920s to early 30s, this 24-room home was adorned with gold leaf ceilings, making it look all the more like the castle on the hill.  \n\nCome on a weekend and visit Geordie's restaurant, where you will have the brunch experience of your life.\n\nPicture yourself in a sun room, overlooking the verdant neighborhoods of Paradise Valley and the Biltmore, with the glittering skyline of Phoenix in the distance.  Live piano music wafts into the room, as the smells of bread puddings and cobblers, french toasts and waffles, roast turkey and prime rib envelop your senses.  Champagne glasses sparkle on the table, covered with crisp white linens, as a well dressed waiter approaches the table to fill the bottom-less champagne flute with your mimosa.\n\nThe lavish and wickedly indulgent buffet is worth every bit of the $50 price tag.  This beats any brunch buffet in Vegas, and is gastronomic luxury at its finest.\n\nBelow are just a few of the items that my company and I indulged in, and loved immensely.\n\nCherry chocolate cobbler, (oh mercy, I thought i had tried it all - until i savored this) blueberry bread pudding, (the gods have smiled on thee) cherry blintz, carrot cake, caramel cheese cake, chocolate espressocake, Danishes, the lavish salad bar, exotic fruit including figs and papaya, seafood bar featuring oysters and shrimp, made to order omlets, various pastas, prime rib, eggs Benedict, and french toast.\n\nSavor a taste of the past, bask in the views and the sun, sip mimosas until you can't stand straight, and eat lots of chocolate cherry cobbler.\n\nSpecial thanks go out to Stephanie Vieira, Catering Sales and Special Events Manager, who recently sponsored a wonderful event at the Wrigley for local wedding and event professionals.  Food selection and entertainment were excellent.  I would highly recommend this facility for a romantic wedding, or just celebrating a special occasion.", "business_id": "yPfvOB63thP5t3pGZPJExA", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-11-13", "type": "review"}

I have been meaning to try this place for years and the Yelp hype has been pretty strong.

The view of the city was breathtaking and I would come back for happy hour, but just to watch the sunset and a have a cocktail. \n \nThat being said... Geordie's restaurant had horrible food. Honestly, one star at best. I had the Cesar salad which was fishy with stale croutons. I also tried the beet and goat cheese salad and I kept looking around for the goat cheese, I had one small dollop hiding under a bib of lettuce. The carpaccio was the worst I have ever tasted. I think the cut may have been bad and I couldn't take more than two bites. I also ordered a side of their white truffle fries; they were the only part of my meal that was anything more than mediocre. For my main I had the tenderloin and it was tough and chewy, the potatoes that came on the side were a joke. \n \nI've been told that Wrigley has the \"pay what you will\" for lunch. If they applied this to the dinner they served I would left with a much heavier wallet. All in all the over hyped experience left me quite under whelmed. Sure it is a great place to impress your out of town guests with, for the view and history alone.

Beautiful building, seriously scary food. \n\nMy dinner began with the Caesar salad, which consisted of wilted lettuce, white flavorless dressing, industrial size baco bits, teeny tiny  chopped pieces of old tomato, with a piece of fried parmesan plopped on top.  And then the piece de resistance  - my entree, described on the menu as roasted, crisp-skin chicken with risotto and garlic sauce.  It would be helpful at this point if you were to close your eyes and imagine the type of food that arrives on your tray as you sit buckled into an airplane seat.. Hold that  image in your mind and you will then know exactly what this dish looked like, it looked like airline food.  And worse, it tasted like it. My meal ended when I leaned over and, as discreetly as possible, handed my plate back to the waiter and whispered in his ear - Unpalatable.   \n\nOr I should say, the meal would have been over if the waiter hadn't then brought us free dessert. To simplify things,  I'll stick with the airline analogy as I describe that dessert.  You know the kind of brownies that a person might buy from a vending machine at an airport?  O.K., imagine if you took those brownies out of their wrapper and put them on a plate and then took a jar of marschino cheeries, opened the jar and let it sit on your kitchen counter for a long, long time (maybe years) until the cheeries and syrup got kind of tacky and sticky and THEN you poured that shit on your brownie from the vending machine.

Our plan was to sit in the lounge, enjoy a few cocktails and have some appetizers and a burger.  This plan was thwarted when the bar tender looked at me like I was insane when I asked about their burger.  He told us they haven't had a burger in years.  The bar menu on their website clearly states that they have a burger which was perfect because my wife and I weren't in the mood for the fancy fare of their main dining room.\n\nWe sat at a table on their patio.  The weather was perfect and the view was even better.  We ordered our first round of drinks and yes they do jack you on the price but that was to be expected.  We then ordered some food to share.\n\n* Flat bread pizza thing - excellent\n* Beet salad - pretty good and pretty unique.  I can't explain it but it is worth a try.\n* Oysters - not so good.  I have no idea why we got this but for some reason my wife wanted it so go figure.\n* Truffled mac n' cheese - OMG - Best.  Thing.  Ever.\n\nThe mansion itself is beautiful but could use a bit of updating especially on the inside.  I do regret, however, not exploring the mansion as much as I should have.  We pretty much stuck to one small wing of the place but there was probably so much more to it than we saw.\n\nOh...and their parking situation is a complete clusterfuk.  The signage telling you where to park, where the valet is, and how to get to the mansion entrance is a complete joke and almost non-existent.  Would it kill them to have more/bigger signs and maybe some lights so you can see them?\n\n** Pro Tip = get the $50 Local Dines gift cert for $25 ( http://bit.ly/dfR4eQ ).  Of course they will complain and try to tell you all the rules that somehow aren't listed anywhere.  They will even try to tell you what \"dinner\" food is and what is not.  Just tell them that if you want oysters and vodka for dinner then that is your choice.

We ordered our food and the first course was really good.  It was a spinach & bleu cheese salad.   The second course was Croque Madame.   It looked wonderful, but on my first taste I almost hurled!  I am not a picky eater at all, but the ham was completely rancid.  I spit it into my napkin and my 4 friends were shocked because I never send food back and I'm the opposite of  a drama queen.  That's why they were so shocked.  The waiter asked if I wanted anything else and I politely declined.   I'd lost my appetite, of course.  My friends fish was almost raw, too.    So we decided to take the tour and have coffee & dessert afterwards.  The mansion was beautiful and the guide, Ashley,  was fabulous.  I was sad to see every single room was set up as a dining room.  There were no beds or dressers anywhere.  But the art, (They have a Renoir) , the chandeliers, the view and the grounds were stunning.  We went back to eat our creme brulee's and our old watered down ice teas, waters and crumbs were still sitting there.  The waiter didn't freshen up anything while we were on the hour tour.  And there were only 2 other tables of 2 there!    So we got our desserts and coffee.   It was good so far.   Then I asked for a coffee refill and I put in my cream & sugar and took a sip and the coffee was cold!!  I was so surprised that it was so cold that I spit it in my creme brulee' cup.  Again, I'm not a drama queen.  This was just so bad.  We told the waiter the coffee was cold & he was so surprised.  DUH!  He was nice but so inept.   We'll never go back, especially to eat!   I was the worst dining experience  that I've had.   They should at least give everybody a pack of Juicy Fruit for the road.

Way better view than from Hilton's Different Pointe of View.\n\nThat said, we bought the Travelzoo voucher for a dinner for two.  First course consisted of shrimp cake or butternut risotto.  The risotto was bland, and the shrimp cake was very flavorful, but the sauces on the plate were noncontributory.  \n\nFor second course we tried the tomato fennel soup and the green salad.  Chef Ramsey would've had a field day - the portions were vastly different among the group.  The salad was good, but not very proportionally or attractively plated.  The soup was ok but nothing to write home about.\n\nFor entrees we got the beef medallion and the trio of fish.  Portions are pretty small here..  the medallions basically looks like a fancified Banquet dinner.  The gravy was sweet and the dish was pretty tasty, but not for the price.  The fish over couscous was cooked well.  Not the most satisfying dish.\n\nWe got dessert of chocolate swirl cheesecake that the server said was \"phenomenal\".  I'd save the 8 dollars and get some Ely's at a grocery store.  The espresso creme brulee was more creme than brulee.  \n\nEven with the voucher, the tab came out to about 55.

I got two Travelzoo vouchers, which many would argue is an attempt to increase traffic when a business isn't thriving or is in its off-peak season.  \n\nSome friends at work decided to make it a group outing.  There were 14 of us.  I paid $120 for four, so I could bring visiting family.  The original \"value\" of the meal is $240.  What a joke!  It says in the fine print that a gratuity of 15% would be charged at the restaurant on the original \"value\" of the meal.  Not true.  Gratuity of 20% was added to my bill at the end of the night.  This wouldn't be so bad if the server/bartender wasn't so HORRIFICALLY unfriendly, rude, and unprofessional.  Really, dude?!  You made over $200 for the 2 hours you spent serving us!  He would have made more if he had been nice.  It was made clear that we had bought discount vouchers, the gratuity was already included, and our service reflected that.  But guess what?  Those are 14 people that will NEVER patronize your business again.\n\nLet's start from the beginning.  When you park, you are required to valet your car to the tune of $7.  Note to Geordie's.  Every other establishment in town that is doing well offers free valet.  \n\nWe arrived 40 minutes early to enjoy the views and a glass of wine on the patio.  I should have known when I went to order wine and was ignored for 10 minutes that the tone for the evening was set.  When I asked for a glass of sweet white for my dining companion and the bartender said \"we don't really have one\" I was officially turned off.  Naturally when we sat for dinner we were offered a wine list boasting hundreds (I think 650) bottles of wine.  Really?!  None of those bottles are white and sweet?  No riesling?  No gewurtstraminer?  \n\nWhen we finally sat, the server ended up being that very same bartender, who made a huge deal about the check splitting and where we sat.  He actually cussed during the process.  So unbelievably unprofessional.  I have never felt like such an inconvenience at a restaurant.\n\nWe all ordered our meal from a pre fix menu of what appeared to be traditional Applebees fare.  When you title your poultry option at a fine dining establishment \"Corn Flake crusted chicken\" you have to know what you're in for.  The portions were decent but I had bland risotto and a confit of vegetables that turned out to be a cold, pasty, flavorless mess.  I tried the chicken bacause I typically order chicken.  It was cooked to chewy and also flavorless except for a mushroom \"sauce\" which I'm guessing came from a Campbell's soup can.\n\nI ordered a bottle of Tempranillo to the tune of $77 which was decent.  Best part of the night, in my opinion.\n\nAt the end, the bill came.  $169.  I had already paid for the voucher, so naturally I thought it was a mistake.  No.  I was charged the $77 for the wine.  OK.  $62 gratuity.  That was hard to stomach.  That's 20% of the pre-discounted $240 meal and 20% of the $77 wine.  Sorry, the guy was a jerk and undeserving of 20%.  Especially since the fine print stated that a 15% gratuity would be charged.\n\nThe last $30 was tax.  $30 in tax!  Do the math, folks!  They charged me tax on the original $240 price of the meal.  Even though the sales price of the meal vouchers was $120!  I don't even think that's legal!  Charge sales tax on a prediscounted price?  Do you go into a store and buy a $100 sweater on sale for $50 and then pay tax on the original $100 price?  That was ridiculous.  Mind you, I had already bought 4 glasses of wine at the bar and tipped the (lousy) bartender for that.\n\nSorry for the lengthy review, but I'm gonna bottom line it for you.  I love  dining out.  In this economy, I understand that fine dining establishments have to nickel and dime you to survive.  But Geordie's is NOT fine dining!  It's actually quite awful!  All told, I spent over $300 for a really sub par meal and I was treated poorly to boot.\n\nGet it together!  They either need to hire a real chef and provide a true fine  dining experience, or cater to a different clintele.  Although I can't think of anyone who would enjoy their food.  I would rather eat at TGI Fridays...", "business_id": "yPfvOB63thP5t3pGZPJExA", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-10-24", "type": "review"}

The pizza was amazing, with plenty of mozzarella, slices of heirloom tomatoes, basil and sauce on a wonderful crust. My youngest said it was the best pizza she had ever eaten! (and she's had Pizzeria Bianco several times!) We ate only half the pizza and wanted to take the rest to go. Debby was very professional yet also fun and personable. To our surprise, she brought out a slice of chocolate cake with Happy Birthday beautifully written on the large white plate. The girls were thrilled, blowing out the candle together. \nAfter our wonderful meal and time spent at Geordie's, we enjoyed walking around the museum like mansion. Many of the ceilings are beautifully elaborate and colorful, and the views of the city are fantastic.\nVisiting the Wrigley Mansion was definitely a highlight to our special day together!", "business_id": "yPfvOB63thP5t3pGZPJExA", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-09-13", "type": "review"}

I wish I could say the food was out if this world. The omelettes were made to order and so were the pancakes which were good. I loved all the fresh fruit. The salmon was also good. However, the rest of the food not so good.   The croissant was dry and the prime rib was chewy. The seafood average. I so wish I could give this restaurant a glowing review. I can't even say the service was that great. They do keep filling up the mimosas but I had to ask for more hot water for my tea and my daughter had to ask for more coffee. I did enjoy the pianist!

First you want to valet, this place is nice, you don't have to dress up, but most people that are there are so it would be best if you did, because in Phoenix if you plan on parking below and climbing the stairs prepare to sweat. And if your dressed nice sweating is not an option. Valet is typically only $5 or $6. \n\nSo in all the times I have ever been to the Wrigley, I have never had to pay just to walk around the grounds and look at things, I have always just took people that are in town and want an amazing view and a bit of history, if they have never been. This last time I went I was charged $5 per person...some daily membership fee or something. I was not too happy with this, especially since we were there right towards sunset, and none of the lights were on within the mansion, so it was hard to see everything.\n\n Secondly this place is not cheap by any means, a typical class of Merlot at the bar is going to run you $10 or more, which is outrageous considering the bottle price. And food here while it is good, is also a bit overpriced, you wont find a plate for under $15. \n\nThird, there is never a whole lot of staff around, walked into the bar to get drinks, and could not find the bartender, had to look for him. And guided tours are not always an option, if they are going to start charging $5 to look around, I expect all the lights to be on, and someone to walk me around the grounds and to provide more information about the grounds then the tiny little placards in each room. \n\nThese were not made available when I was there, which is ridiculous considering they made me pay and it was just myself and one other person. \n\nAll the rooms were dark, so we had to find light switches to see stuff. And they have moved a few thing around, which I found a bit strange. I would also say maintenance and housekeeping is lacking a bit, some of the lights were burned out, and things could be a bit cleaner, the Wrigley is quite old, but it does not mean it can not be maintained better, the place is starting to smell like dust. Not what your looking for if your planning an event or a wedding here, which allot of people do here. \n\nDefinitely a piece of Phoenix history with a view that in unparallelled in Phoenix, unless your living in a highrise at the Optima or Esplanade or climbing Camelback mountain. \n\nThink management has dropped the ball a little thou, over the years. Still I would be willing to go back, just for the view.", "business_id": "yPfvOB63thP5t3pGZPJExA", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-09-28", "type": "review"}

You would be a millionaire within 30 days. Know anyone who could pull that off? Not me! For us working folk it takes two weeks of doubling down to afford Sunday brunch for two at Wrigley Mansion ($49pp). Worth it!  \n\nThe mansion is atop Telewa Trail close to the canal. The best entrance for check-in was on the SE side; upstairs from valet parking. The host was sitting there. But if you use regular parking downhill, then walk up through the pedestrian entrance on the NW side and make your way through the leftmost rooms towards the host. \n\nTable was already assigned and we were politely escorted to a white room with big windows. Lighting was wonderful and tables adequately spaced. As soon as we settled in, a server introduced himself to us and gave the banquet 411. Then glasses were promptly filled with freely flowing mimosas. They were refilled several times while dining.\n\nTake a moment to give thanks. God bless Abundance. My belly is always on my mind and my mind on my belly. This quality buffet presented a fun bingeful experience for my appetite. Not my waistline though, BUT I am currently in the R&D stage of an invention that burns calories as I eat. It's patented! Binge buffeting is 'bout to be the shizith!\n\nBinge. Did I say a bad word? I don't mean it badly. I chose to hit each food section only once and use one plate at each. So I didn't overstuff - loosely speaking. Let me paint the picture: I had four courses - fruit, salad, entre, and dessert and seconds on dessert, but who's counting... \n\nFood in the banquet room had been placed at six stations. I stood there with closed eyes pretending that everything was revolving around me. Fooooooood. Here's how it looked; going clockwise.  \n\n1. At the long center table was about five hot pots. I remember a pilaf, yellow rice, sauteed vegetable medley, salmon in lobster bisque, and a meat dish. Veggie medley was mildly seasoned. Nothing dark green in the mix so I just took a couple pieces of cauliflower. The salmon was very soft and didn't actually taste like salmon. Maybe it was because of the bisque.  \n\n2. On the south wall was the made-to-order pancake and omelet station. This section was manned and those men were a bit stingy with ingredients. Pans were small so my order for a pancake ended up being a weecake. When I asked to have it topped with fresh blueberries, about five berries were doled out. \n\nMr. Omelet Maker was no less stingy. I requested more veggies because he only gave a pinch of my favorites. Literally a pinch.  \nSUGGESTION: Let the diners self-pick ingredients into a small bowl which they can hand to the servers while ordering pancakes and omelets.\n\n3. To the right of omelet pinchville was the dessert spread. I'm pretty sure I was the first binger to crack into them. Cheesecake, chocolate cake, 3 flavors of cupcakes, brownies, apple squares, apple tart, chocolate chip cookies, snickerdoodles, carrot cake, and numerous petite fours including one of pumpkin cheesecake. YUM! \n\n4. A few feet from there was the fresh salad table. Strangely, choices were few and there was only one dressing, maybe two. I remember a huge bowl of crisp romaine lettuce and another bowl of mixed lettuces, also a small platter of roasted peppers and things, olives, onions, capers, pickled condiments. Not much for a salad lover.\n\n5. Along the north wall, was the carving and seafood station. There were slabs of red meat which a server sliced thinly for you, crab legs which he cracked for you, and other sea beings like shrimp were served cold. \n\n6. The table along the east wall was by far the longest and most diverse section - the \"breakfast\" station. On one end huge bowls of cantaloupe, honeydew, strawberries, pineapple, blackberries, watermelon, raspberries. The stars of the fruit show were pineapple and blackberry; both sweet and ooh so juicy. Raspberries were good. Watermelon was okay. Cantaloupe and honeydew unfortunately were unripened. Every bite seemed like rind.   \n\nThe breakfast table continued with cold stuffs like cereal, yogurt, jams, croissants and danishes, muffins, and then it transitioned to the hot items. There were three or four pots, one with seasoned potatoes. Most likely there was some kind of sausage, and maybe oatmeal too.\n\nThis club definitely caters highly to its customers. Staff was bustling nonstop to clear away empty plates and refill glasses. The bill was brought to the table after we finished - a first in my buffet experience.  \n\nMinor annoyance: Every time we left the table, we'd come back to find napkins refolded and placed neatly at our places. So all morning the server was touching and retouching everyone's dirty napkin. \nSUGGESTION: Stop that! Leave my napkin alone OR give me a clean one. \n\nI would definitely come again, but at mansion prices the buffet is the only meal I would  consider returning for.", "business_id": "yPfvOB63thP5t3pGZPJExA", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-10-21", "type": "review"}

Two of us went at 7:00 on a Tuesday night and were seated immediately.\n\nWhat we ate that we actually ordered:  Lobster bisque, salmon quesadillas, coq au vin, seafood skewers.\n\nWhat the server brought-- for free for us to try-- which we ate but hadn't ordered:  The butternut squash ravioli, mini pumpkin chocolate brownie with ice cream on top.

Having lived in NYC for a while, I became a bit spoiled and was pleasantly surprised to find Postino comparable to places I loved out there! \n\nNighttime is the best time to go as it's dim, loud and full of energy. Postino is one of my favorite places to go for a light dinner and drinks with good friends year-round; however, on a fall or spring night, when they have all the doors and windows open onto the patio, it's perfection.\n\nAs many have mentioned, the bruschetta is great. It's a good option for an appetizer or sharing for a main dish, especially if you'd rather focus on filling up with wine than food. ;) The grilled cheese appetizer is tasty, but a pretty small portion. If you're looking for a small compliment to wine, they've got a \"cheese course\" and a meat and cheese \"plate\". The cheese course comes with 3 different cheeses that they switch up frequently. It's a pretty decently sized dish, but the last time I ordered it, the \"fruit\" they mentioned on the menu was basically just dried apricots, cranberries and nuts. It wasn't bad, but with the crunchy bread it came with, there were too many dry things on one plate for my liking! If you like olives, I'd recommend splurging on the $5 olive bowl. It's a generous portion of mixed olives that will not disappoint. \n\nMy all-time favorite item at Postino is the \"Prosciutto with Brie\" Panini, on Ciabatta bread, with salad. The sandwich is soft prosciutto layered with brie, arugula and figs, drizzled with a little balsamic and olive oil and served on a super crunchy ciabatta roll. If this was the only item on the menu, I'd still make the 15 mile drive to order it. The sandwich is big enough to share, but I love it enough to eat the whole thing and suffer the consequences later. :) All of the paninis come with potato chips or salad. Rarely would I choose salad as a side, but I actually look forward to this salad almost as much as the sandwich. It's romaine lettuce, pine nuts, crumbled feta and a very light oil dressing (from what I can gather). \n\nThe two negatives, which is what drops it from 5 stars to 4 are the following: The service is often lacking. There are some really nice, attentive servers and there are some rather pretentious servers (which isn't unheard of at a wine-bar). It's really hit or miss, but I take it with a grain of salt and don't let it deter me from going. After all, a pretentious server can become great material for dinner-time laughs. \n\nThe second negative is the parking situation. This is an issue with any of the many LA Grande Orange establishments located on that corner. Pretty much any time you go there, you will have trouble finding parking. They do offer valet, but call me cheap, I'd rather not HAVE to pay for valet. \n\nTo make a long story short (I know, too late), go to Postino if you're looking for an experience you're unlikely to find anywhere else in Phoenix.", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-09-02", "type": "review"}

Had the olives and pub board as appetizers along with a very nice Spanish red wine that was suggested by the server. The Pub Board was fantastic with Portuguese chorizo, cheese, and a very yummy homemade pretzel. The olives were a really great sampling of many different types and they all complimented our wine well too. \n\nHubby had the Autostrada with the potato cheese soup, I had the 9 Iron with soup, friends split the Proscuitto with Brie with chips. All were positively perfect!\n\nFor dessert, we ordered a bottle of a white Spanish wine Fuente Milano and it had a nice grapefruity after taste that was very cleansing on the palate before we had the Chocolate Bouchon, the Creme Brulee, and the salted carmel sundae. OMG...all were so yummy and the wine went perfectly!\n\nThe nicest part about Postino is that it isn't on a main Scottsdale Rd. drag....it's actually nestled on a side street off of 39th St. and Campbell. You'd never know it was there if you weren't looking for it but apparently plenty of people know about it because it was hopping at noon yesterday.\n\nIf you haven't tried it....go. You won't regret it. It was hip, fun, and the food was realistically priced and absolutely DELICIOUS!", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-09-06", "type": "review"}

But honestly, I think this place is slightly overrated. Don't get me wrong, I like this place, and I oblige them every time they want to go, but I think 4 stars is just right for the rating. \n\nWe went there this weekend, and the typical scenario went down. Parking was cramped (lucked out to get a \"valet\" spot which I parked into myself as it was right out front by the entrance - no I'm not waiting for you Mr. Valet Dude to get into my car and pull it forward into the spot right in front of my face, thank you very much), and there was a short wait (maybe 10-15 minutes). We sat outside, which wasn't ideal since it was cold and drizzly, but we had patio heaters on both sides of our table so it was OK. \n\nSadly we didn't make their $5 wine special, which ends at 5pm, so we were paying full price for the glasses of wine - ranging from $8 to about $12-13. I don't know about you, but I really am not a fan of paying $10 for a glass of wine when I can pay that for an entire bottle. But alas, I had 2 different wines through the course of the night, both on recommendation from the servers, and both decent. \n\nWe ordered the infamous bruschetta, with the 4 choices being: smoked salmon (YUM!), warm artichoke (tasty), roasted red pepper (still good), and white bean with tomato (OK, but nothing to write home about). \n\nFor dinner, I had the half & half combo (where you get to choose 2 different items), and I chose the mixed green salad (REALLY delicious, with an awesome combination of greens, pears, grapes, gorgonzola cheese, pecans, & poppyseed dressing) and half of a turkey/pesto pannini. The pannini was QUITE boring. Didn't have much flavor at all. I think it was lacking on the pesto. \n\nAnd honestly, this is what I come to expect at Postino. Some things are just unbelievable and you want to lick your plate clean, and other things are simply boring and tasteless (like the white bean/tomato bruschetta and the turkey/pesto pannini). \n\nAnd hence my rating of 4 stars rather than 5. If the parking was easier, the wines were always $5 a glass, and the food was consistent, I would give it 5 stars.

It was way more than we expected and both my date and I felt a little full going into the main course just from that.\n\nSpeaking of the main course, I had a panini type sandwhich with chicken, tomato and mozzarella that I really enjoyed. \n\nThe atmosphere and service is perfect for a date.

I had two glasses of wine, Grayson Cabernet (which was really good) and a Reisling (I can't remember which one, but I liked it).  My friend and I also split the selection of four bruschettas.  We had the brie and apple (my favorite), the caprese, goat cheese and roasted red peppers and salami and pesto.  They were all amazingly good!  \n\nSimply put though, I love this place because it is consistently good. The service is always great, it is reasonably priced, the food and wine are delicious and the ambiance is wonderful.

This is definitely enough for two people to make a meal out of or for three to four to share as an appetizer.

(Every Monday and Tuesday night after 8pm, $20 for a bottle of wine and bruschetta) We missed the happy hour but now that Ive had thier homemade bruschetta...who cares! I would come back again and again even without the discounted food. \nThis restaurant is quaint and cute. Sort of small and tucked away behind a random street (obviously Im not a local Phoenix-er) But they have this cute little outdoors area with a fireplace and bar, and when you are in a hot little town in the middle of the dessert, its nice to be outdoors and enjoy the warmth at night, something we dont get to enjoy too often in SF. Im sure many of the other plates at this restaurant are delicious as well, but their specialty by far has to be their bruschetta! Almost any type of concoction and combo you can think of to go on flaky/crispy baquettes, this restaurant has come up with. None of the bruschetta's that I tried were dissapointing.\nLet me start by saying, this place is a \"share with everyone\" type of restaurant, which, I have no problems with because then I get to pig out and taste everyones's plates. haha!\nSo, I literally tasted almost every type of bruschetta that was on the menu.\nLet me start with the Brie and Apples with Fig spread- this almost tasted like a dessert because the tangyness of the apples. The Tomato jam with fresh sheeps milk cheese could also be had for dessert. This actually may have been my most favorite out of all the bruschettas! The cheese was sooo creamy, you could eat it with a spoon. That mixed together with the sweetness of the tomato jam------heaven.....\nProsciutto with Figs & Mascarpone\nThe Warm Artichoke Spread was mighty tasty and fresh and this coming from a girl who grew up in the \"artichoke capital of the world\" \nBurrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomatoes- Adding burrata to anything cant be anything but delicious! And knowing that, I, a corndog/bacon LOVER think that this combo will rock anyone's world.

We came on a Tue night to meet up with another couple we hadn't seen in awhile.  Mon and Tue they have the special where you get a bottle of wine and bruschetta for $20.  This is a great deal.  The place was crowded so if you go make sure you go early and get your name in.  The nice thing is that you can start drinking your bottle while you wait.  We were waiting for around 45 min before we got a table but we were having fun nonetheless.  The bruschetta was amazing and there were many different types to choose from.  We also tried the grilled cheese which was delightful.

I have been wanting to try this place for awhile now since I have been hearing and reading great things through yelp. I mean how great can panini's and bruschetta actually be? More on that later. \nThe actual building itself was pretty cool. A nice chill vibe that wasn't overbearing with pretentiousness. Always a breath of fresh air. What kills this place is the crowd. I showed up about 2 PM. and the crowd was casual and just having a good time. As the time got later the typical Arcadia yuppie / trendy crowd began coming in. Totally killing the atmosphere. I don't know why so many people in Scottsdale and Phoenix are like this, I don't get it. It's not attractive, you look like douche bags. I swear it seems as though there is a clan of people on yelp all yelping together to write great reviews, because it's what they like, so gay. \nOK, now for this food review, it's strictly for the bruschetta's. Honestly I don't know why people praise somethings. I tasted four of them. Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato and Basil. Tomato Jam and fresh Sheep's Milk Cheese. Burrata, Bacon, Arugula, and Tomatoes. And Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese. Let me get one thing clear, they all tasted good, and yes some were more impressive than others, but come on it's a slice of bread with a topping, not really a culinary masterpiece. Although I will give props to the Tomato jam, that was delicious! \nAs an all around value of Postino, you really can't go wrong. The prices match what these items should be priced at, and solid drink deals. I would definitely go back if fellow friends suggest going there, but I don't think I would go out of my way to come back here.\n  But with all this being said, they have 2 locations and are opening up a third one.  So props to the owners, they have marketed a concept and people are loving it so they're doing something right in many people's opinions.", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-09-18", "type": "review"}

The crowd was light at 5 and we chatted for a good hour or so before ordering our first bruschetta board. You get 4 pieces of each selection and you can select 4 different types. The apple fig one was amazing of course the classic tomato mozzarella was to die for. The prosciutto and date melted in your mouth! We gnawed on that for about 30 mins then ordered another to try 4 more!

I have been to Postino's 4-5 times and usually bring someone who hasn't been before....clients for happy hour/husband for lunch, etc. Although their patio isn't large, it is my favorite area and I recently found out they are dog-friendly. Happy hour here is the best....the appetizer menu with different kinds of Bruscetta is unreal. Don't be afraid to dive into their wine and beer menu - if you haven't heard of a label, ask your waitperson. They have obviously been well trained and give great advice. Speaking of the wait staff - they deserve high points. Even when this place is packed, they show up promptly....if fact, we had 2 or 3 different people stop by and ask if we needed anything. My favorite thing on the lunch menu (alas, I've not had dinner here yet) is the proscuitto and Brie panini. This mere \"sandwich\" is my diet Kryptonite...and worth it! Every bite is a food orgasm of salty proscuitto,warm gooey Brie slathered with sweet fig jam.

Lots of food!! Great price point for what you get. Presentation: Rocks, Flavor: Unreal, Price Point: Totally worth it. Because we originally thought the bruschetta was going to be a \"side\" we also ordered the Vegetarian panini with a side Mixed Green salad which was also super delicious.

My top two bruschetta faves are Brie & Apple with Fig Spread and Prosciutto, Fig & Mascarpone. Mmmmm!\n\nI'm not currently drinking (I'm prego again), but of course this is the perfect place to go for a glass of wine or four as well!  \n\nService is always fabulous and the atmosphere rocks too.  So in my eyes, this place deserves five stars... even almost five years from my original review!\n\nOf course, it is worth noting that it's not only a favorite of mine, there are plenty of others that love it too... so, sometimes you may have to wait a bit.

That little for booze?! Sign me up!!! Mondays (I think it's Monday...) all bottles of wine are half off! They feature a lot of local wines and hard to find wines. This is the place where I first fell in love with Moscato. I can't say enough about their Moscato except that it is delicious!\n\nTheir bruschettas are very tasty and hands down the best I've ever had. They get creative with their toppings and there's something to please palettes of all kinds. If I had to narrow down my top 4 favorites, I would choose: the apple, brie, and honey; fig, marscapone, and pistachio; the mozzarella, basil, and tomato; and finally the prosciutto and fig.\n\nDownside - parking can be tough since this place is usually hopping. But they offer valet at a staggering price of $3. That's right - 3 bucks. Not too bad to have someone park your car 20 feet away. Also, the service can lag at times depending on how busy they are.

Which definitely came in handy in terms of hiding our slight shame when the onslaught of food and booze arrived at our tiny little table for 2!\n\nIn true fattiness, we ordered enough food to feed a family of 5! And of course with their happy hour offerings for wine and beer it was too awesome to pass up on! \n\n1. Selection of 4 Bruschetta's: pretty good variety of options, ingredients were fresh, generously portioned and flavor combinations worked. My only problem was the bread to goods ratio. Even though I am a thorough carbivore, it was a bit too much bread for my pref and I tend to like less dense bread for my bruschetta. Nonetheless a great deal for $14!\n\n2. Autostrada Panini - I am not one to pass up on any meat, on meat, on meat, on meat action (yes, 4 types of salty cured pig parts...especially in regards to the Soppressata, LOL!)! And the spicy pepper relish was a nice added zing to bring together all that goodness. LOL!!\n\n3. Bella Postino (warm artichoke dip and white bean hummus with assorted MJ breads) - Probably...no...definitely could have done without this given the amount of food we already ordered but still a good staple to order if you're here with more than 2 people! Haha!\n\nAnd then on to the best part! They have a great happy hour where their wine by the glass and PITCHERS of beer are just $5!! Loved that there were so many options! You seldom see that here in San Francisco. So it was quite glorious! There was definitely some remorse that I stuffed myself so much I didn't have more capacity to fully take advantage of it! \n\nSD also introduced me to a locally produced beer, I believe it was the HopShock? Pretty freaking delicious!\n\nGood food/booze and wonderful company certainly made this a very memorable meal! If I ever find myself in AZ again I will definitely revisit this place. Especially now that I have learned from my mistake of not properly allocating my stomach capacity for happy houring here! ^____^\n\n\"I am not a glutton, I am an explorer of food\" ~ Erma Bombeck", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-09-25", "type": "review"}

I wish they would either extend the hours, get extra table or do something so they can accommodate all of their clients. They will accept reservations if you have a party of 8 or more. So last Mon. we called ahead and made reservations for our large group, we arrived 20 min early to ensure that they would have enough time to get our table ready and they told us that they just gave our tables away to 2 smaller groups. Hello?!?! We were EARLY to our reservations. Very disappointed.", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-11-26", "type": "review"}

I've been a regular here since I moved to the neighborhood over a year ago. However, there appears to be some staffing changes that are interfering with service.\n\nThe food and wine really are top of the line. There hasn't been a single morsel of food that has crossed my palate that I've disagreed with. Unfortunately the experience is not what it used to be, and for that I'm disappointed. If you're ok with extended wait time between glasses of wine, great. I'd recommend ordering a bottle of wine and being done with any further expectation of service. (Including water.)\n\nI've been visiting during off peak hours to ensure there would be no unnecessary wait time or standing around. (So, for example, 2pm for a lunch hour.) This is a wine bar. When you go, it would be nice to receive the wine you order. The last time we went I watched my wine sit at the bar. When my friend managed to flag down our server (fifteen minutes after we had placed our first order) what the status was he joked, \"I can't squeeze the grapes.\" (If it had been convenient/easy for me to move quickly I would have picked it up myself. Crutches, not so much.)\n\nSo not funny. I get it. You can get in the weeds. It's better to admit that.  But - maybe - call me crazy - check in your table more frequently the rest of the meal. We eventually were able to order a second a glass of wine. The wait time for vino was, alas, terrible.  \n\nI'm telling this story as an example of the service I've received as of late. There are others. I'm not sure what's happened or why. The upside to not having any table service (or much of it) is that you have ample time to speak to your table partners. Perfect for a date. Not so perfect if you're on a business lunch or in a rush at all. \n\nAnother option for speedier service might be to sit at the bar. The bar isn't terribly huge but offers comfortable seating. The bartenders are wonderful.", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-11-30", "type": "review"}

It tasted like it had been sitting in the kitchen for a while before waitstaff had gotten around to picking it up and delivering it to me. Ultimately it came out kind of cold, but it was still incredibly good, so I can't complain too much (except I can because I'm Korean like that and prefer it when my food is hot off the fire hot and my drinks are icy cold).\n\nI also had a glass of white wine which was completely forgettable, Hannah's field salad, and 1/2 Tuscan Tuna Sandwich.  I don't typically go for tuna sandwiches, but it sounded perfect, and the pickles and the mustard added just the right hint of piquancy.  The salad was nice too, though a little sweet for my tastes; all in all, it paired nicely with the tuna sandwich.  I love the kale and quinoa combo.  \n\nThis is a fun place to come with friends, so that you can share all of the different types of bruschetta.

Oh, and they offer a side of sauteed mushrooms or spinach.  I usually get both.  They make everything better, even hurt feelings.\n\nThere is this ONE server that I get all the time, who I am shocked still works there.  She's one of those people that you don't want to get mad at because she genuinely seems sort of naive - but she just sucks.  And that removes my fifth star.\n\nThere is ANOTHER server who I used to get very frequently, who was super kick-ass.  He actually offered me my coffee to-go at the end of my meal, which I am certain isn't really encouraged by the manager that does the ordering and cost spreadsheets of procuring to-go containers.  But it's that kind of extra attention I desire, and frankly, deserve.  Ok, that might be a bit much, the deserving part.  \n\nThe food is just really good.  Very fresh and delicious.  Wilted greens omelet, or the caramelized onion and bleu cheese frittata (errr, it might be an omelet, frittita, frittata, what have you) sun-dried tomato bialy.  That is my complete sentence.  Don't let my grammatical errors fool you, I have taste-buds to make up for my bad English.\n\nLunch is tasty, but eh, wouldn't be my first choice.  Breakfast is where it's at.\n\nCoffee is delicious.  They make a nice latte if you have about $5- to throw away on liquid that doesn't get you drunk or offer enlightenment.\n\nI take away a star for my \"um, yeah, that was pretty ok\" lunch experiences,  that one sucky server, and the fact that they don't serve potatoes with breakfast.   \n\nBut the four stars should soundly represent the awesome server, those aforementioned breakfast menu items, (truthfully I haven't met a breakfast there that I didn't like), the offered-to-go coffees, the quality ingredients, the option of getting liquor at breakfast, and the outside seating, though it backs up to the parking lot, your backdrop is ultimately Camelback Mtn.\n\nI find it appropriate to point out that, while you will generally not leave paying less than $12- / person, they do use local / organic ingredients.  This costs more.  Good quality food is pricey.  That's just how it goes.  I'm happy to pay a little extra and not leave feeling like a porky porkster.  Porky McPorkersons with the top button undone.

I am saying that on the basis that everything I saw served looked put together right.\n\nI had the Mediterranean Vegetarian Sandwich.  The bread was nice and fresh which was the start of a really tasty  meal. It didn't taste like the bread at some places that give you a variety of 8 different kinds but they all suffer from a bland sameness.

His French Onion Soup was better at Capital Grille, my antipasto plate was far better at Craftsteak, and my ribeye was far better at 1130.

I went with a group of friends here during Restaurant Week and we didn't regret it at all.  Yeah, the place is kind of a time warp with a very old school steakhouse feel, but the food and service both spoke volumes about this place.\n\nThe biggest thing that drew us here was that during restaurant week, they don't just give you a few choices amongst the different courses.  They let you select from their ENTIRE menu!  Huge points to management for that one.  For appetizers we each ordered something different.  I ordered the caprese salad (good mozzarella) and one of my friends got a crab fondue that was incredible.  For the main entree, I got the veal and sage ravioli.  Very fresh, artful presentation and generous portion.  And for dessert the chocolate volcano brownie was a perfect way to top off the meal.  As great as the food was, our server was awesome.  She was an elderly gal (can't remember her name), but she was warm, energetic, and very helpful with the menu.  Made the experience that much more enjoyable.\n\nAgain, don't really understand all the negative reviews I've seen thus far, and perhaps the restaurant had its A game just for restaurant week.  But the place was busy and it sure seemed like everyone enjoyed it as much as we did.

We placed our drink and food order together- he got a draft  xx lager and the burger w fries.  I ordered the short ribs but they were sold out at the time (8:15).  I got the market salad instead since the menu was so limited.  Our server Colleen offered to have them add a salmon filet which I did.  I also had a glass of lost angel wine, I think a cab or Pinot?  The wine was good but I would have gotten a white wine with the buttery flavor of the salmon in retrospect.  My hunny got his burger medium well instead of medium though The patty did not seem hand pressed, so NOT amazing.  My salmon salad was good, generous with spinach, baby green beans, fontina, tomatoes, and the salmon atop was cooked nicely and had a crispy outer which was yummy!  We had the carrot cake which was ok- wish the sides had frosting!  The flavor was not too sweet and definitely homemade.  My hunny did not like the crunchy bits on top though I was fine with it.\n\nBreakfast: 5 stars\nWe were seated one booth over from the night before.  We were greeted quickly by a super nice gal and she explained the buffet to us. My got the breakfast burrito and I did the buffet.  I got a plate of pineapple, honeydew, strawberries, made a Greek yogurt parfait with almonds and walnuts, and grabbed a muffin and croissant.  The pastries were delicious! His burrito was huge and presented really nicely with yummy garlic potatoes, 2 salsas, a grilled tomato and a baby asparagus.  \n\nIt seems as if they may have been understaffed for dinner though breakfast was better.\n\nOverall I rate the restaurant at 4 stars based on our 2 experiences.", "business_id": "Y3a3RkR97J_ReiKgiMXeJg", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-09-11", "type": "review"}

There were two left in the case and we knew the selection would be pretty wiped out by 1:30 on a Sunday but it seemed we had lucked out. She tried to be very thorough and repeated my order back to me, I confirmed and she \"sent it off\" to the payment register. \n\nWell apparently the \"manager\" Cory, (or Cody whatever his name was...I'll just refer to him as Captain Jackass, Lord of the Asshats from here on out) didn't agree with what she entered and came to the register and rudely snarked, \"We're out of potato rolls, Taylor!!\" Taylor and I thought that the potato bagels would sub just fine but we realized in the short time that it took to put our order in, someone had snatched up one of the last potato bagels.  Captain Jackass threw his hands up in frustration and continued, \"Just great, you already sent it to the next register, now we can't fix it [the next cashier] will have to fix it.\" This dude acted like she kicked his dog or something. It was a simple mistake. I didn't see the problem--just put the sandwiches on bagels, I didn't care, charge extra if need be, I'm an easy customer. \"Is he always such a dick?\" I asked. \n\nCaptain Jackass didn't stop there. He made our sandwiches and turned to place them on the pickup counter. \"Hi, those are supposed to be to go\" I said. At this point Taylor is next to me restocking the drink case and he turns to her and remarks, \"THANKS A LOT, TAYLOR!!\" He throws the sandwiches down like a two year old having a fit and wraps them up to go. Taylor apologizes to him, and to me and asks, \"Did I not enter that they were to go?\" Captain Douchebag Jackass is starting to respond but I had enough and interrupted him. \"Are YOU the manager??\" I asked. \"Unfortunately, yes I am\" he replies. \"Do you always treat people like s#it and talk to your employees like this? It was a simple mistake, it's not a big deal\" \n\nCaptain Pompous Jackass says he's sorry, he's having a bad day, blah blah blah I advise him that I didn't care what excuse he had to give, it wasn't professional or acceptable at all to treat someone like that. \"Thanks, ma'am, I'll take that into consideration, really, I will\". I asked for a corporate number to report the incident so he walks over to the far counter and slaps a brochure onto the counter and walks away. \n\nHe yells, \"Have a great day, ma'am!\", to which I replied, \"You too, a$$hole!!!\"", "business_id": "pNJhovUsGAZ4XqG3lCU-5g", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-11-01", "type": "review"}

We headed north toward the Harkins North 16 Cinema and stumbled upon Denny's.  We still had plenty of time before our movie, or so we thought.\n\nThe entryway was warm and crowded with people waiting.  Only a ten minute wait was indicated, so we decided to stay.  When we were seated, we noticed the restaurant itself seemed a bit warm as well.  We waited a very long time just to have our presence recognized by a server.  Eventually, beverage orders were taken.  Coffee was delivered without an offer of creamer and we labored another five minutes just to make eye contact with anyone who could bring us some.  Food orders were finally taken and were served in a reasonable amount of time, although there was a significant amount of time between when the first person in our party and the last was served.  Not a big deal, but it's awkward to postpone eating until everyone is served and awkward when they insist that you go ahead and eat.\n\nWell, it's Denny's.  The food was fine.  Uninspired.  Just what you'd expect.  Given that you can eat at a really good breakfast joint just a few blocks away, however, I'm just not sure why you'd want to settle for this.  I'm pleased that the Original Breakfast House treats their employees well with the day off, but I doubt that I would ever head back to Denny's anytime OBH was open.\n\nBy the time we were finishing, we had used all of our available time and felt as though we'd been eating in a sauna.  The restaurant never cooled down.  Not revealed to us when we checked in was the not insignificant fact that their air conditioning was broken.  Not all of their air conditioning.  Only the part where their patrons were seated.  Revealing this tidbit of information to customers when they came in the door would have been the honorable thing to do.  Yes, we probably would have elected to go elsewhere, but it's what any good restaurant would do for their customers.  But not Denny's.      \n\nThis Denny's is nice in appearance and some employees seem well intentioned.

I told her this isn't what i ordered and had to ask her to remake it 3 times before she stopped staring at me and had it remade. she then walked away no apology or anything, i didn't see her again while i waited and extra 20 mins for my order.

He's worked here for seventeen years and he will make sure you have a good experience.  5 and Diner is a great choice for families.  The fifties themed decor is fun for all.  Just wish the juke box system worked. On my most recent visit I had to try to explain the concept of a hula hoop to a three year old.  Since a demonstration was out of the question, I'm afraid this little one will have to wait for later clarification.  She did enjoy coloring the paper hat the restaurant provided, however, and her folks enjoyed the $2.75 price tag on the generous junior pancake breakfast.  The menu also features a separate section for seniors.  While technically you have to be fifty-five to order from this section of the menu, in my experience servers will allow anyone who would prefer these smaller portions and prices to order them.  A note about prices.  While the kids menu prices are very reasonable, select off menu junior beverages are a bit pricey (juice $1.79) and can drive up your total cost.  There is also a loyalty card that will help stretch the dollar of frequent diners.\n\nThe Southwest Omelet was perfect on our recent visit and definitely worth a taste.  The pancakes were uniform and served hot. In all honesty, however, it's the decor and the friendly staff that earns the restaurant four stars in this review. Menu offerings are solid, with a few amusing names scattered throughout, but are for the most part predictable and basic.  But come to think about it, isn't that what you want from a fifties diner?\n\nEven though 5 and Diner is not a \"genuine\" fifties diner, instead an Arizona based chain's recreation of the era, it seems genuine enough.

Over the years, where we got our Mexican food has varied, but for the last year or two, it has been Azteca more often than not.  It is a favorite of one of my coworkers, and he was the one who convinced us to give it a try.  And, how thankful was I!\n\nTheir tacos are fantastic -- shredded beef with a bit of kick to their seasoning, in a crispy, thick hard shell. And, even their beans and rice are wonderful. They make it even better, in my opinion, by sticking some chips in with your beans and cheese. It's like a mini nacho surprise. Plus, they always add a small slice of orange with every meal. I usually don't eat it, but it always adds a nice touch and smell to your eating experience. \n\nI've not ventured too much beyond my yummy tacos, but my fellow coworkers always rave about their chimmi's and burritos with just as much gusto as I do about my tacos.  Oh, and the other day, I tried a sampling of their breakfast burritos, and I must say they were muy delicioso. Eggs and potatoes and bacon wrapped in a fresh, homemade tortilla -- that is what I call a heavenly breakfast.\n\nAnd, finally, of course, are their baked goods. Again, I haven't tried their whole selection, but in the past I've been lucky enough to partake of their empanadas, and I've never been disappointed. \n\nAll in all, Azteca is a fantastic Mexican food experience in the heart of downtown Phoenix. It is affordable, it is welcoming and the food is delicious.  What more can you ask for?", "business_id": "d2AeNB4xw67E1Bzpo1Pm7Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-09-06", "type": "review"}

And the staff was amazing and stealthlike...things were always taken care of but you hardly noticed that the staff was there and when you did they were so accomodating and friendly.\n\nMy only caution is to any bride who thinks this is a beautiful setting but does not consider that you are at a FARM! The bride's dress was filthy after dragging it across the ground and everyone's shoes were dusty but no one at this Wedding cared. If this might bother you or guests, this may not be the place for you. I urged female friends to wear wedges or flats because heels will dig right into the grass at the Farm.\n\nRegardless of the event, go check out the Farm at South Mountain.

So I get my order, and it's 3 types of wrong. The waiter gets mad...at me??? Okay. Awesome. So he brings me my English muffin I ordered to being with. Except...it's half. If an English muffin. Confused, I asked where the rest of it was. He confessed that he dropped the other half, then ASKED ME if I wanted another one. Like 'Well I guess I can make you another one.'  Seriously? Wow! Yeah I didn't order half of an English muffin nor am I paying for it! Then because of his mix up, he actually never comes back to our table. Not even to bring me my muffin or to refill are cups (which were not refilled during our stay). \n\nI'm usually not harsh on waiters, they have a hard job. But half of an English muffin?? Please. First and hopefully only time I will never tip a person.", "business_id": "lq2iZK7epi23byzcejjqTg", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-10-20", "type": "review"}

Long waits and Wait staff seem disinterested in what you are ordering, and they seem to always smell of cigarettes. I hate to judge on people physical appearance but the waiters all seem to look like those you would see in those faces of meth ads. Dirty, missing teeth, stained uniforms. I'm sorry but I prefer people to be clean and clean looking if they are serving and handling my food. The food here also has gone down hill.

But I was also lured by the cheese crisp, with carne asada.  $6 for a combo with no steak, only $6.75 with.  Holy cow, there was a TON of steak in this thing, and it was humangous!  But it wasn't what I'd call a cheese crisp, it was really a quesadilla, at least by all of my past Mexican food experiences.  Nonetheless, it was pretty tasty, and a BIG meal by the time you threw in the beans & rice (which were very average).  I also got a chicken taco, on corn tortillas.  The tortillas are tiny, but they load the thing up with a lot of meat and fixins, so at $1.15 (!), they're an awesome deal, and VERY tasty.\n\nOn the Brak-o-meter, the taco rates a solid 5 stars, the cheese crisp a good 3.5 stars, and value rates 5.. for a composite average of 4 or thereabouts.

Ordered a chicken hard taco, pork soft taco and carne asada sopes. Food took a while, which surprised me as they weren't really busy, but it was probably because it's made to order. My food was hot and steamy when I got it and it was goooooood!! Should have ordered more, my favorite was the sopes and carne asada. The salsas were flavorful and while I usually prefer red, I liked their green salsa better. \nService was prompt, the young women that worked that night were very nice. \nI'm glad they're close to us, as we'll visit often.", "business_id": "rDvz5jX65gpfONFu7er9Tw", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-11-22", "type": "review"}

Just never have developed a liking for soft tacos.  I love tortillas, both corn and flour, but as a taco, I just don't dig that style.  If I want a soft tortilla, I'll order a burrito.\n\nOK, enough about me.  On to the Los Taquitos review.\n\nThe Good:\n\nThe beans were very good.  Darker in color than your average re-fried beans, and had a \"fuller\" taste.  I and my 11-yr-old daughter both nommed the heck out of them.\n\nThe Carne Asada was very well-flavored and barely not too dry,  \"walking the line\" between moist and dry.\n\nThe salsa they provided in a plastic squirt bottle was VERY good - the right amount of heat (more than average) and with a good chile taste.  Had my daughter searching for watery relief.\n\nThe kids liked the chicken in the tacos.  Noticeably moist and flavorful. \n\nMy daughter was a big fan of the cheese on the tacos.  Not sure what kind it was, but it was good.\n\nThe \"Not-So-Good\":\n\nWe had the hard shell tacos.  The shells were \"VERY\" hard.  Hard to the point that the whole taco collapsed after the first or second bite.  If they changed to a slightly better hard taco shell, these tacos would improve quite a bit.\n\nThe marinated pork was very dry, and neither of my kids liked the taste of the seasonings.\n\nThe meat portion of each taco was a little on the \"skimpy\" side.  We had massive amounts of shell left over with no meat remaining, after the tacos fell apart and we started eating the pile.\n\nThe \"Blah\":\n\nThe rice was standard, very bland.\n\nSo, all in all, this is a decent place.  I've been eating Mexican food in Texas, Arizona, and in a few other countries for most of the last 35 years.  This place is an above-average spot which could improve.\n\nBut anyone who says this is the \"best Mexican food\" has just not had enough of it to know better.", "business_id": "rDvz5jX65gpfONFu7er9Tw", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-10-01", "type": "review"}

There was a play at the Ahtawukee Children's Theater that day and after the play, we grabbed lunch. We went at 3:00 P.M. and I was expecting more people to be there. It was featured on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives so I wanted to go. I got a carneasada burrito with no beans. It's not that beans make me gassy, I just don't like them. At the first few bites, it was flavorless. I could barely taste the cheese, the meat was dry, plus the burrito wrap (bread) was the most flavorful thing in the burrito believe it or not. The burrito got better on each bite, but it wasn't the best Mexican meal I've ever had. I enjoyed my burrito. You know that cliche saying \"The first bite's always the best.\" It was the other way around with the burrito. The other people that were with me were happy, except for one. She had a  shrimp taco, a fish taco, carnitas burrito and she said it was a little bland. The other person with me is the only one out of us 3 who really enjoyed his meal beginning to end but, he also gave it 3 stars. The place is a little dirty. There was a piece of tomato    on the seat at the booth we sat at. The service was friendly. What confused me was that on the menu, it said that they have Mr. Pibb but, on the soda machine it said Dr. Pepper so that confused me.

We told the waiter who was not surprised at all.  Just offered to take it back and take it off the bill and replace it??   I was shocked and really worried about my son getting sick.  The manager was not concerned and acted like I was overreacting.  \nMy family has never gone back but I was talking with my neighbor the other day and he said the same thing happen to him.

This is the second time I have been dragged to a Paradise Bakery at breakfast time. I can't take it anymore. There was a review for another location where the reviewer says it looks when you step in the door that Paradise has promise. That is so true.\n\nWhen you first walk in and are looking at the bagels, the baked goods, the menu, the purple lights, you almost forget about your last, horrible experience. Have no fear, once the food is served, you quickly remember. I ordered a croissant breakfast sandwich - no ham, and a medium coffee. Seems simple enough. They brought me the sandwich WITH ham. I didn't know when I first bit into it. This ham is still alive, it is so tough, I am sure this is what Wilson rejects for their footballs. What is wrong with you Paradise? Why would you stick a huge slab of tough ham inside a croissant. A croissant that wasn't even toasted. Which brings me to my next comment. You stick an egg on a croissant and you make no attempt to toast the croissant? Even Dunkin Donuts toasts the croissant. You have no clue how to make anything. Even after Panera acquired you, they couldn't impart any wisdom into you? And coming from Panera, that would be little wisdom since they have a terrible menu, which you made worse.\n\nIt was good to taste the same bitter mud, er, coffee, that Panera serves.\n\nParadise, you owe me more money for this disgusting crap you served me, but why can't you try to improve? You clearly can't think this food is good? You remind me of the fat girl in school who boys would tell her, she had a cute face just to get some action out of her. Someone once lied to you and told you, you had a cute face and you believed them.

It used to be that US Egg owned my heart with its patented oatmeal-blueberry-almond wheat pancakes until I tried Good Egg's blueberries and glazed pecans (double toppings, please!) pancakes made with whole-wheat batter, and a little whipped butter on the side, hold the syrup.  If I feel like a little pain (food allergies) with my pancakes, I'd order them with special granola topping.  It is quite tasty!  However, it's heaven on earth for me with the blueberries and pecans.\n\nThe Isle of Capri omelette is delicious, as well.  The capers, sundried tomatoes, and feta cheese give the egg-y delight a slightly, uh, for the lack of a better word, funky aroma, but it tastes so good!  The side of country potatoes, while a bit salty, is equally yummy (can you guess which pieces I like best?).  I hear the guacamole and bacon that come with many dishes are very good, too.  I also recommend the reuben panini... oh my goodness!  I just experienced multiple shudders up and down my spine... bet you didn't know women could have those!  LOL.  Speaking of orgasm-inducing foods, has anyone else had a Smokey Forest sandwich at Duck and Decanter??\n\nBTW, I tried ordering the pancakes here ala US Egg, with oatmeal and almond toppings, but they weren't the same.  I prefer US Egg's version; however, I'm a sucker for those loyal customer punch cards, and, on certain days, Good Egg even offers double punches!  Suh-weet!\n\nP.S.  I've tried four locations [Thomas/Central, Ray/Rural, Dobson/S of 60, and McDonald/Scottsdale Rd (?)] and I prefer those on Thomas and Dobson when it comes to good to great service.

I've tried it a couple of times, but I just don't get it [and I refuse to try it again, 'cause frankly, it's a waste of a good pizza... I'd rather resurrect it again to it's former (but not quite) glory by popping it in the toaster oven].  I have, however, found that I LIKE cold blueberry and glazed pecan whole wheat pancakes out of the fridge!  And guess what?  They're so good, they don't even need butter!

I've been frequenting several of the Good Egg/ Eggery locations for many years now and it's amazingly consistent.

It's perfect every single time! I can only remember one out of a few dozen times that it was a little too greasy. Besides that, it's admirable how consistent they are with the quality of their food.

It was usually the Frank Lloyd Wright location that had horrendously slow service. But I think that was more the fault of management mishandling staff as opposed the servers. \nPlus, who doesn't love the unintentional hilarity of the hokey interior design of the Good Egg? It's like they had members of a retirement center do the interior decorating...I love it. \nSo all in all, due to the quality and consistency of the food, I'll still take the Good Egg over any newer, trendier breakfast places that I've tried (I'm looking at you, Over easy).", "business_id": "8aPTQeDYOMNEu907WfflCQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-11-25", "type": "review"}

It is the Village Inn.  Let me explain...  I had just finished an hour long torture session at Mesa Community College's track/playing fields with a group of friends. (1) We were Hungry (hungry with a capital \"H\").   None of us live in Mesa.  No Yelp due diligence had been completed on the area.  Someone mentioned seeing an IHop at the corner of Dobson and Southern.  Done.  We get there. My heart sinks.  It is not an IHop.  It is a Village Inn.  \"Oh no,\" I thought secretly to myself, \"NOT the Village Inn.\" (2)  But the collective decision had been made.  The group charged in.  Five minutes later, we were seated in a large u-shaped booth.  There were crumbs on the seat and little hand prints all over the mirror behind us.  Children were here before us.  A busboy promptly cleaned up the mess.  By this point, my expectations could not have gotten any lower.  I scanned the menu in despair thinking, \"That sounds good, but can it be properly executed at a Village Inn?\"  Our server, Danny D. arrived.  He greeted us with much enthusiasm and a genuine smile.   He began taking orders, making his way around the table.  By the time he got to me, I was still at a loss.  I looked at him and stated, \"I have a problem with the menu.\"  \"Okay... what's the problem.\"  \"Nothing is quite what I want.\" I describe the breakfast that I do want, a veggie omelet with real eggs, buttermilk pancakes, and fruit on the side. (3)  \"No problem.  We can do that.\"  My mood brightened.  After about 10 minutes the food arrived.  It looked pretty good.   And then I took a bite.  The eggs were light and fluffy, good veggie to omelet ratio, just the right amount of cheese, and piping hot.  Somewhat stunned, I stated, \"Wow, this is actually really good.\"  My friends look similarly stunned.  My feelings were echoed.  \"Yeah, my food is really good too.\"  \"Me too.\"  \"Me too.\"  \"This is fantastic.\"   \"My taste buds are so happy right now.\" To top it all off,  Danny D. was a total rock star server, circling back to bring extra condiments, more napkins, and fresh coffee throughout the meal, and always with a palpable sense of brightness and cheer.  Maybe it was a fluke experience.  Maybe we were all so hungry that dog food would have tasted good? But then again, maybe not.  Maybe this Village Inn is just a diamond in the rough?  Only time will tell.  \n\n(1) See my review regarding Iron Gloves Boxing located in Tempe, Arizona for more information.  \n\n(2)  My experience with this particular chain has not been good.  I have bad memories of going to a Village Inn in Albuquerque with my grandparents and being forced to eat rubbery inedible scrambled eggs. Sometimes with hair.\n\n(3)  The veggie omelet is a \"healthy\" menu item.  Ordered standard, it is made with egg substitute and served with whole grain pancakes.", "business_id": "dbh72sNyNeHUgJqQye9Vbg", "stars": 3, "date": "2007-10-21", "type": "review"}

So we mapped out our chores for the day and found a Village Inn along our path.\n\nOur waiter was very friendly and helpful, but obviously frazzled.  He helped me narrow down our choices by answering our questions about the menu.  I ordered 2 eggs, hash browns, sausage and rye toast.  The husband ordered a sausage skillet.  To our amazement, the plates that were presented to us a short time later, LOOKED EXACTLY LIKE THE PICTURES ON THE MENU. \n\nThis is the first time in Arizona that I received hash browns that were actually brown.  What a concept!! And not just brown on the top. Nooo, these babies were browned on both sides. Crispy, yummy and BROWN hash browns.  And I didn't ask for them to be cooked that way.  Every other restaurant in Arizona does such a pisspoor job of browning hash browns, that I've completely given up on asking for my potatoes to be done \"dark.\"  I usually end up with a plate of mushy potato shreds dripping with butter substitute.  Gross. I've come to the point that I ignore that the potatoes are even there.\n\nBut before my very eyes is a plate with the potatoes cooked just right, eggs exactly how I asked them to be cooked, tasty sausage links and two thick pieces of marble rye.

It's been over a year since we last ate here.  \nI had an uneasy feeling as we got out of our car, but I didn't want to show my uneasiness.

I told my husband, \n\"Let's go to another place, I think this is a sign.\" He gave me that look a husband gives his wife when he's not changing his mind.\n\"Ok, nevermind.\"\nAs we got closer, we discovered it was cheesy mac and cheese. Shrugs shoulders okay, continue on. It must be that good for someone to sneak it out.\nI told the hostess, \"Just so you know, there's food in the parking lot, you might want to have someone clean it up.\" She just smiled.  Umm okay.\nStill cautious, I decided on salad. Finally I was brave enough to try some hot food (french fries & stuffing). My husband came back with his plate, fried chicken, mash potatoes, gravy, mac and cheese! I have always raved about their fried chicken when we ate here in the past. My husband took one bite and it was bloody. I surprised myself by not overreacting. We calmly told the waiter. \nMy daughter and I decided to get dessert (cookies, still playing it safe). We both came back and the manager or owner was at the table. She apologized & said,\n\"We took the chicken back and carefully took it apart.  We discovered it was a vein that popped and was full of blood.\"\nI gagged & nearly got sick all over the table. I exited the building, there was still that yellow glob still in the parking lot, that did it for me, I got so sick.  Sorry to the people who saw me get sick outside the restaurant. Never, ever going back. My husband came out with ONE coupon to eat free.

First off, let me say it is SO cute!  It's got this French sort of theme going on, and upon walking in, you feel a little Euro flair.  It was kind of strange because there wasn't really a hostess, so people were just kind of milling around the entryway, but someone would occasionally come by and seat people, so there wasn't really a wait.  The food options are really great here, and they have a seasonal menu from which I ordered the pumpkin pancakes.  I recommend.  They come topped with caramelized cinnamon apples.  My friend got the blueberry stuffed French toast, which is French toast stuffed with blueberry cream cheese and topped with some other fruit stuff, and he said it was really good, too.  Per tradition, my friend also ordered a side of potatoes, and what we liked about these potatoes was that they weren't hashed.  They were diced red potatoes, and they were seasoned so that you didn't even need any ketchup.  They were soft where they needed to be and crispy in just the right places.  We ranked the potatoes in the top two on the list of Best Brunch Potatoes.  \n\nWhat's nice about Mimi's Cafe:\n1. Jamie, our waitress, was super friendly and super speedy at coming around to top off our coffees (sidenote: the coffee, depending on what batch you get, might be a bit watered down).\n2. If you get the breakfast (with a side of eggs and either bacon or sausage) and don't go a la carte, you also get a glass of juice with the meal as part of the breakfast.\n3. The ambience is really cute and comfortable and family-friendly.  It's a place I would like to take my older parents when they come to visit.  \n4. Prices are great especially if you decide to go with the full breakfast option.\n\nThere WAS a little mix up at the end with my credit card not being returned to me when I paid, but when I brought it up to the restaurant people, they quickly apologized and was able to find it and return it to me.  People make mistakes, so I won't count the incident against them.  Also something to note: I'm not sure how crowded they get during peak hours, but my friend and I went around 10:30, which was a great time to go.  The restaurant itself wasn't totally packed, even though the parking lot would make you think otherwise.  That parking lot was kind of small, but it's not a deal-breaker, especially cuz there's a ton of parking across the street on the mall side if you're willing to walk (I, apparently, was not).", "business_id": "qLXxp0rpzT4kG9tT3wZwfA", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-10-11", "type": "review"}

But I'm glad I let my wife talk me into going here after getting out of a quinceanera mass, because one, we were starving, and two, the food and service were outstanding! Let me begin by saying, it is always nice when the service is so good that you almost don't have to ask for anything. Service wasn't overbearing, but it was nice to know that they appreciated your busines and wanted to make sure that you didn't go without anything.\n\nIt just so happened that it was our server's very first day on the job (no waiting experience whatsoever I might add) so we got to break in a newbie. He didn't take our order, because he was busy with another customer, but he told us he was busy and he'd come back, but one of his co-workers took our order instead. Nice save Mimi's, nice save. With our orders taken and drinks served, our over eager newbie thought I had water, and served my more water. However, I was drinking Sprite, not water! I told him so, and without hesitation, he brought me out a fresh Sprite. No apology necessary, as the problem was quickly fixed, but he did so anyway.\n\nMoving on, the other server, not our newbie had messed up our son's order, as he ordered mini cheeseburgers and apple sauce off the kids menu and was brought a grilled cheese instead, and because of that, the general manager brought us out a 4-pak of their delicious muffins  for \"our troubles and inconveniences\" and apologized for the aforementioned troubles and inconveniences and for the newbie's first day, but we were quick to point out that it wasn't the newbie's fault and that he had fixed his mistakes promptly, but hid the muffins before they decided to take them back! LOL. Awesome! Never in my life have I had an establishment go above and beyond to rectify their \"poor service\" so quickly, but Mimi's, you guys raised the bar and I will never forget my first dining experience here!\n\nMoving on to the food, I had the Cobb salad, asked for ranch instead of blue cheese dressing, and for the blue cheese on the side. That's exactly what I got, and you can't beat a simple salad with fresh ingredients like the salad I was given. Everything equally portioned, not one ingredient over powering the other. My daughter's grilled cheese was rather tasty for being a simple grilled cheese and I'd recommend the Mediterreanean chicken pasta that my wife had which was outstanding! I'd also recommend the honey bran muffin which was perfectly baked!", "business_id": "qLXxp0rpzT4kG9tT3wZwfA", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-11-24", "type": "review"}

I visited this location awhile back when I lived nearby and thought might as well go again since I remember it being good.. wrong.\n\nSad to say it wasn't the same, it was far from it. First off at 8:30am on a Saturday morning it was rather empty, that should have been our first clue. Second, the hostess (older lady with glasses) was rather indifferent about us being there. She looked me up and down, then said \" just two?\", without so much as a Hi or welcome attached. That was the only glance we got our way while she wiped stains off the menus and made smacking sounds with her gum..oh and can't forget the awkward silence before she finally said to follow her. After she sat us down, my boyfriend commented to me about her not even looking as us. He was rather annoyed at the unfriendly greeting and it kind of ruined the start of our breakfast on a beautiful Saturday morning. \n\nThankfully, what changed the mood for the better was our server, she was what you'd expect a hostess to be. She was friendly, conversational and made us finally feel welcome. For awhile she made us forget about the rude person in the front. \n\nSo onto our food experience: Our food was alright, not amazing.. I'm not sure what changed with this place, but something is different. No complaints about the food, it was average and came out like we ordered. I've definitely had more memorable food.. hehe i'm a breakfast lover..\n\nWhen we finished, we felt satisfied and happy with the service from our server.... but as we were leaving we passed the hostess again... and well she was filing her nails by the hostess stand near the menus and only looked up to say \"thanks for coming\" then looked back down without even stopping what she was doing.. That is grooosssss, but at least she looked at us this time..\n\nI really hope the managers actually read these reviews, because if they cared about customer service and hospitality they would make changes. This experience makes me not want to come back, the BOGO was not worth it. Can you imagine how far her fingernail shavings flew around inside?\n\nBy the way...

It is so good i went back the very next day after my first visit, and if i hadn't left phoenix that night, i would have gone back again the next morning.   The first day my companion and I split 2 meals, biscuits and gravy and what they called the California Benny.  The biscuits where obviously homemade.

It was served with two eggs cooked perfectly and their take on breakfast potatoes.  The potatoes were cut like scalloped potatoes but prepared like breakfast potatoes and the high surface to mass ratio gave them a wonderful crispy texture. \nThe California Benny was a twist on the traditional Eggs Benedict.  It was an English muffin topped with bacon, spinach, tomatoes, avocado, poached eggs and hollandaise sauce.  It was more delicious than i could ever have imagined!  the Eggs were again perfectly cooked and all the vegetation was wonderfully fresh and flavorful.  The hollandaise was also amazing.  It was very creamy, smooth and lemony.  At the end of our meal, our waiter had a treat for us because it was our first time.  He brought each of us a small dish of their rum soaked bread pudding.  It was amazing!\nWhen we went back the next day, i again had the biscuits and gravy, somehow resisting the urge to ask for a glass full of gravy, augmented with wonderful rye toast and my companion had cinnamon french toast.  The french toast was soft and wonderful and the biscuits and gravy were just as good as the first time.\nThis phenomenal food combined with the terrific service could easily be priced above the $20 per person mark and people would willingly pay.

The place was busy but not chaotic.  Tables weren't jam packed together which isn't always the case for breakfast joints.  We went around the time the after church folks probably go.  We were seated promptly and quickly placed our drink orders.  I chose the Onassis omelet with a side of pancakes (+ strawberries and whip cream).  Not sure what my girlfriend got but she enjoyed hers.  I knew I couldn't finish all that I ordered so I focused on the pancakes, they were very tasty.  The omelet was good but the potatoes on the side were great.  They were thinly sliced instead of little cubes like most places.  We both have plenty of food leftover that we took it home.  \n\nIn all, with a coffee, OJ, and our meals it was around $25.  My pancakes were an extra $1 and so were the strawberries and whip cream.  Best breakfast I have had in town and we tried out Brunchie's once from the rave reviews on here.  If you want an overrated breakfast joint, go there.  Way too busy and loud with slightly above average food, but nothing unique.  I doubt I'll go back there even though it is  mile from my gf's house.  But we will definitely make the 3 mile trip up to Crackers and Co. Caf\u00e9.    \n\nThe person that complained about a $25 breakfast for 2 two being expensive needs to join the rest of us in the 21st Century.  2 coffees cost $5, the Crab Eggs Benedict isn't even on the menu so either it doesn't exist or was a daily special.  Everyone knows daily specials tend to be pricier, especially if you add seafood to it.  Who orders crab with breakfast anyway?  If you expect real lump crabmeat at a breakfast joint than you shouldn't be eating and ordering it.  Either way that makes your breakfasts about $9 each (left room for tax), since when is that outrageous?  If you want to eat off the Value Meal I am sure McDonald's will be happy to take your order.", "business_id": "2nzUx_M8Szyzsf4CszHasw", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-09-16", "type": "review"}

I love breakfast foods so I knew that even if it wasn't the best, I would enjoy it. It's tucked out of sight, near the Holiday Inn on Country Club. It's housed in what looks like industrial office buildings but it's not a well kept secret it seems because the place was packed, but still no wait on a Sunday, mid-morning.\n\nI'm so, so glad I found this place on Yelp. My mother got a plate of cinnamon swirl French toast. The slices of bread were SUPER thick but still saturated with the egg and cooked all the way through. It was served with a honey butter and hot maple syrup and it was so delicious.\nI got the three meat omelette but after seeing another meat omelette they called The Musketeer, I knew I had to also get it smothered in their hollandaise sauce. I got the Meat Lovers because it also included their honey pit-roasted ham. It was amazingly good and I'll be sure to get hollandaise sauce on all my omelettes now. It was served with a side of \"country potatoes\" only these were sliced rather than cubed like most places. They were seasoned perfectly and had just the right amount of skin. I also had a slice of what I assumed was in-house baked sourdough toast. It was thickly sliced and just perfect. \nTheir \"famous\" desert menu caught my eye because they had a Cinnamon Blackberry Bourbon bread pudding with real whipped cr\u00e8me. It sounded amazing and tasted just as good. I didn't have room for it but I forced it down anyway because it was just so delicious.\nI definitely recommend this place to breakfast lovers. I can only assume their lunch menu is just as delicious! It was also really fairly priced for the quality (about $8 or less a plate and dessert was $5). I also had a raspberry lemonade which was fresh, not pre-made box lemonade. Thick and sweet with just the right amount of tart and flavour. Perfection.\n\nThe wait staff was also super friendly and prompt. I'll definitely be coming here again and again.", "business_id": "2nzUx_M8Szyzsf4CszHasw", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-09-12", "type": "review"}

I rant and rave about how i always want to go because...I LOVE Breakfast!  Their country potatoes are to die for when you get them served fresh. Now i am not saying they have came out gross before i just do not like eating potatoes or french fries after i have left a restaurant they just aren't the same. I cant believe someone thinks their food is bland. they must have made a wrong choice somewhere.  Everything i have gotten has been amazing to say the least.  For some reason i always get the skillets and go back and forth with which one i will get.  But the most recent time i went i got their super amazing french toast that melts in your mouth like cinnabon but not as sweet where you feel as if you will die in the next hour. No the French toast is perfect but next time i will only get one slice not 6. Their biscuits and gravy are pretty damn good too. the sauce isn't watery or soupy but just amazing.  My sister has tried one of the omelletes i just cannot remember which one. i will be trying one today when i finish getting ready for the day. which of course im looking forward too. make sure when you get to crackers if you enjoy lemonade order yourself the strawberry lemonade its my favorite! More than Hot dog on a sticks lemonade which i drink on a regular basis working in the chandler mall.   \nOh one more thing...If you want superb customer service every time go to this location that is behind home depot.  I have been to the Tempe location 3 times now and 2 out of 3 times the customer service was just mediocre to poor. the most recent time a friend and i went our waiter was finally nice thank god. For some reason their hostess doesn't come off pleasant what so ever and obviously doesn't care about quality customer service on weekends(which is when i went once) .

I ordered my standard Ham & Eggs but I was tempted to have their \"Mess\" which was SOS with eggs and a slice of Prime Rib. The one thing I read in the previous reviews that caught my interest was the country potatoes. I'm always looking for a breakfast place that serves home fries where the potatoes are sliced and fried with onion, it's hard to come by. The review I read said that they sliced their potatoes so I was hopeful. The potatoes did not get fried with onion but they were still great. The ham was a good sized slice and the eggs were cooked perfectly. OK, here's how Crackers and Company failed to get the 5th star.....the English muffin was not toasted and they buttered it which made it soggy. I didn't send it back because by the time the second English muffin was delivered most of my breakfast would have been eaten. It's not like the restaurant was busy and they were rushing the orders out, I was the second table of the day so there's no excuse for not toasting the English muffin properly. My suggestion to anyone like me is tell your server that you want the English muffin toasted properly. It's a shame that a place that's been called the best breakfast in the Phoenix area would have to be told how to toast an English muffin. I'm I just being too picky????", "business_id": "2nzUx_M8Szyzsf4CszHasw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-11-13", "type": "review"}

I, being the more manly of the group, ordered the pork carnitas skillet. He ordered the more feminine euro crepes with triple berry sauce.  When the plates arrived, I was tasked with dividing the carnitas, he with splitting the crepes. The crepe splitting went off without a hitch, and let me just say, they were quite delicious. The carnitas division wasn't quite as smooth. My fork pressed a straight line perfectly measured through the center of the plate. The volume of each side was perfectly measured and both sides were consistent in both volume and mass.  As I bit down into the first scoop, my taste buds screamed an exultant \"hoorah!\"  It was tender and delicious. The eggs, the potatoes, the cheese, and the pork. Oh my....the pork: so flavorful, so plentiful. Seriously, lots of pork. A little light on the potatoes, for my liking. As I shoveled the carnitas into my eager chompers, my date looked on with amusement as my male counterpart and his date picked delicately at their respective crepe plates and traded clever conversation. \n\nI was inhaling the last crumbs of my delectable, explosive pork delight, when my friend began his portion. It wasn't long before the reality and horror of my error became evident: my dear poor friend, stirred his plate, and pressed the potatoes from side to side. To his great dismay, there was a conspicuous scarcity, nay, a dearth...of pork!   How could this be?! I had carefully measured and divided the dish meticulously, and most carefully. Surely it could not be my mistake. Quickly, the explanation began to materialize and crystallize in my mind:  the waitress, being overcome with my charm (and early morning bed head) clearly instructed the cook to place the pig's share of pork on my side.   While flattered, I cannot condone such blatant discrimination. I am now forced to somehow resolve the guilt that plagues me for being, through no fault of my own, better looking and more charming than my friend. Crackers really needs to address these prejudices. It's 2014, for Pete's sake!!\n\nNow the good news. I've tried lots on this menu and it's a consistent oral nirvana.

Everyone there was very polite and helpful! not sure if they do it in all the other branches, but I was suprised that they put a lemon in the water, which is awesome!

Unfortunately i can't give her props because i forgot her name due to being dehydrated and tired before we got there and was just focused on eating and water.

My wife ordered off the two course special menu and got asparagus with citrus shrimp. My daughter had the salmon. Everyone raved about how good everything was.

So lemme clarify with the star rating: breakfast/ brunch = 4 stars. Lunch and dinner = 3 stars. Their breakfast menu has so many lovely choices and pictures. K so here is what I have had:\n\nBreakfast:\nEggs benedict - Very good but a bit too much ham on it. Got to a point where ham was all I could taste\nEggs florentine - AMAZING! One of the best benedicts I have ever had! Eggs are always cooked perfect, hollendaise is light and creamy, and I love the mixture of the tomato, bacon, and spinich. This is what I order most of the time. Used to get the eggs houssard which was the best but they did away with it which always happens to me!\nCrabcake benedict - Good but the crabcakes can get a bit overpowering and they turn this breakfast into a very heavy one.\nMixed Berry Pain Perdu - Great for if you have a sweet tooth. They give you tons though and after awhile, its a bit too sweet at least for me. Still liked it alot though.\nChipotle Breakfast Burrito - This is surprisingly very good considering its not from a mexican restaurant.\nCiabatta Breakfast sammich - Very good but a bit too much meat for my liking. I think I will order it minus the ham next time. But the rest of it taste terrific.\nQuiche - Have had a couple different types (brocolli and cheese, crab and sweet corn) and I can say that Mimi's makes some of the best quiche I have ever had. Very light and flaky crust with fluffy eggs and great mixins\nCarrot Bread/ Blue Berry muffins - Some of the best bread and muffins I have ever had. Always warm and fresh\nRedskin Breakfast potatoes - Pretty good. I prefer greasy hashbrowns though\n\nLunch/ Dinner:\nFrench onion soup - Good soup. Better be good cause this is one of the things I think they are supposed to be known for.\nChicken fettuccine - Was ok, not very memorable though. I liked that it had artichokes and sundried tomatoes but the sauce wasnt very thick and the chicken was kinda bland.\nButternut Squash Ravioli with scallops - This was a special at one point and it was very good. The scallops didnt taste frozen like they do at most AZ restaurants and the ravioli were very light and flavorful. Unfortunately, I am not sure if or when this special will come back\n\nSo to sum it up, I am always excited to go to Mimi's for breakfast, however, I don't often consider going there for dinner. I feel that I should go and try more items for dinner/ lunch because the items I have had during those times were not bad. There is definately potential. The prices are reasonable and the service is good most of the time. Oh and I definately need to go back and try their bread pudding at some point to see if it makes the list of best bread puddings.   :)", "business_id": "-6Roo-EHgSdUa4rP3tWyRw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-11-25", "type": "review"}

The manager let us use two coupons (there were four of us) rather than having to sit at separate tables.

It had a variety of dishes available from simple stuff like a burger, salads, and au jus, to \"fancier\" dishes like quiche and pot pie, and salmon and parmesan chicken.  It's not a high-end bistro, but for what it is it is good.\n\nAlthough the setting is casual, their menu is more extensive than similar places with some different dishes one normally doesn't find.

We usually have to wait to be seated because it is very popular. This morning was no exception. We requested a table like usual.

Almost 40 minutes before we got our food. She did fill my coffee up again for me at least.\n\nWhen we got our food it was pathetic. The pictures in the menu of the crepes we ordered were full of fillings and almost round. My husband got the ham egg and cheese crepe. It was as flat as a tortilla with maybe a sprinkling of super-tiny diced ham and a thin piece of cheese melted on the top. The poor crepe. Some one deflated it and made it bland. I got the banana/strawberry/nutella crepe. Again so flat. Maybe a teaspoon of nutella on the inside. Did not really taste any. Then I was extremely lucky to receive 1/3 of a banana sliced up super paper thin and placed and the front a back of my crepe. The strawberries might have equaled and entire half of a full strawberry if you took the paper thin see-thru slices and assembled them into something solid. These are $9 and $10 dishes!! You could at least given me an entire banana and a whole strawberry. Maybe they had a \"see who can slice the most paper-thin slices of half a fruit and see if the customer notices\" contest with the chefs.\n\nI also ordered a side of fruit. So for around $4 I got 3 super-thin slices off of a tiny clemente orange that was way past expired, and 5 whole red grapes. At least they did not cut the grapes paper-thin. I must be lucky to get 5 whole small grapes.\n\nI understand about needing to make a profit, but dang people. At least try and make the food seem not like a super-rip off.

So, regardless of where you are in the valley, you are sure to be close to this breakfast action.\n\nI've been to the Good Egg several times and have to say that the winners on the menu are the \"Sun Devil Scramble\", the \"Breakfast Sandwich\", the \"Old Pueblo\", the \"Bleu and Brie Omelet\", the \"Krabby One\" crepe, and the \"Lumberjack Frittata\".\n\nThe \"Sun Devil Scramble\" is eggs, ham, onions, bell peppers, tomatoes, and melted cheese. \n\nWhen you order The \"Breakfast Sandwich\", you get to customize your sandwich the way you like it. You choose how you would like your eggs prepared, which breakfast meat to put on the sandwich, and what type of bread to put all the goodness inside of. They also add melted cheese. \n\nThe \"Old Pueblo\" is a breakfast skillet that is made up of chorizo, green chilies, tomatoes, melted cheese, eggs, and pico de gallo. This tasty skillet also comes with flour tortillas on the side.\n\nThe \"Blue and Brie Omelet\" is one of the most unique and tasty omelets I've had. It consists of honey smoked turkey, spinach, broccoli, mushrooms, grilled onions, water chestnuts, tomatoes, bacon, and a trio of tasty cheeses, brie, jack, and bleu. \n\nThe \"Krabby One\" crepe is awesome! It is made up of spinach, mushrooms, onion, brie cheese, crab, shrimp, hollandaise sauce, tomatoes, and scallions.\n\nThe \"Lumberjack Frittata\" is probably my favorite menu item at The Good Egg.

Pretty unassuming from the outside, I walked in and noticed the salsa bar to the side of the counter. Good start, this meant I was definitely gonna have to order the chips and salsa. I talked to the woman behind the counter for a few to get an idea of what to expect with certain dishes, and I settled on three regular tacos so I could try a couple different kinds of meat. I ordered one chicken, one steak, and one shredded beef. Now, when I got them home I was a little bummed that they were on the small side, but each one was delicious in it's own way. The steak was perfect, much better than what you find at most places. The shredded beef had an amazing flavor, despite dripping a combination of spice and grease, and the chicken was fajita style chunks of pure white meat. Delicious! My only complaint was the salsa...I tried all three, but none of them were particularly stellar. The best of the three was the one labeled \"Salsa for chips\", but it was nothing to write home about. All of them were kind of just bland and average at best. Despite the minor salsa bummer, I will DEFINITELY be back here...now I know to rock the super tacos (a bit more expensive, but surely bigger), and load up on those and bypass the chips and salsa. Maybe give the rice a try for round two...either way, check out Lulu's, good food here!", "business_id": "CRvVvR6aE1eWVRtzQ0UC6g", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-10-16", "type": "review"}

Not proud of the fact but a character flaw that has been working out for me so far. So, why do I share? I can't help myself and it is so good, I do believe I could be meddling with my karma by not mentioning this little know fact....The Farm House is serving dinner. Yep, you got it. Dinner. One night a week, Friday to be exact from 5pm-8pm and yes, you can order beer or wine. Mother of God, it is nirvana and this is not due to the fact that I live in Chandler and have eaten everywhere else! \n\nDinner items are meatloaf with mashed potatoes, ham steak w/scalloped potatoes, chicken and biscuits...OUTRAGEOUS! There is more, I just couldn't memorize the whole menu. \n\nNow, I'm not a down home cookin' kinda girl. In fact, I would tell you that down home cookin' is just an excuse for not trying hard enough. Well, take me behind the wood shed and beat me silly, this down home cookin' is amazing. I have never ordered anything with biscuits as part of a main entree and again, after the severe beating with a fence post I deserve, the chicken and biscuits is luscious, buttery, chickeny gravy goodness that curls up on your fork and and caresses your tongue till you can love it no more and are forced to chew! \n\nThe wait staff is courteous, swift to keep your water glass filled, helpful with the menu, have tried all the entrees and to kick things off will offer you a dinner roll before your entree. Yes, its a single roll and dumbo (me) rolled her eyes, I'm a slow learner and said no. Well, the rocket scientists I went to dinner with had the sense to say. \"Hell Yes\" and the dinner roll from heaven with wings arrived on its own cake plate with a pat of butter. Don't be an idiot, get the roll. Learn from my stupidity.

The omelets are always light and fluffy, their home fries are really good and different from any others I have had, and their toast is amazing. They toast a french wheat baquette which takes toast to a whole other level! The husband usually gets the green chili pork omelet which is a special on the weekends.

Other things we have tried: cinnamon roll was huge and lovely, chicken fried steak and eggs which is a special on the weekend, and biscuits and gravy which is huge and the gravy definately taste homeade.

Their coleslaw is fantastic, crisp and sweet and light with little bits of broccoli in it.  \nNow for the rest.  I went with two friends and my two children, one of which uses a high chair.  We walked in on a Monday afternoon and the place was about half full.  A waitress motioned from the back for us to sit at a round table so we did, picking up our own menus on the way.  And then we sat.  And sat.  My son squirmed around on my lap but I had nowhere to put him.  I watched two different waitresses walk by us repeatedly, even cleaning tables but not making eye contact. I finally flagged one down and she came over and said, \"You've been helped right?\"  We said no and she turned around and left.  A few minutes later a different waitress comes up, tells us we want coffee and seems put out when we ask for something else and sighs when I say I need a high chair.  5 more minutes go by and we get half the drinks.  Then a few minutes later the rest.  I can put up with lackluster service as long as the food is good and I had heard great things about this place so I held on to my patience.  I ordered the Long John with mushrooms.  Well, I can tell you that if I ever run out of hockey pucks for my local team, I know where to go.  It was almost inedible.  Dry, tough overcooked ground beef patty with a smattering of tasteless mushrooms topped with half melted cheese.  I actually asked for a side of ranch so I could dip it in that to make it moist enough to eat.  The waitress never asked how the food was, and we never saw her again after she ran my credit card.  \nI hope that this was just an off day but really the second star is only because of the coleslaw.
