My best friend and I (she flew in from NJ for a visit and we planned a girls' day) went to this spa for 1 hour massages, both of us choosing hot stone. We both have experienced this type and other kinds of massages in many different places, NJ, NY, California to name a few.\nHere are my main issues:\n1- we are greeted by a very nice woman who does not understand or speak English. We ask questions and we are answered 'yes' every time. When we asked about the spa pools (are they hot or cold water?) we get a 'yes'. I ask again, are they hot? We get a yes. SHe leaves and we touch the water and both pools are ice cold. We find the hot tub, figure it out ourselves and the jets, which do not move, are facing straight up, therefore making a huge mess and we can't sit in front of the jets to loosen up any muscles. It was a joke.\n2- the hallway from the pools to the locker room is so sterile, I thought I was in a hospital.\n3- my massage, was all about the stones. My very nice therapist added hot stones then removed them over and over again for 50 minutes. SHe didn't massage anything. I kept on waiting for the manipulation to start, thinking she was maybe warming me up and relaxing my muscles and she was going to start the actual massage any second. Then we were done. What the heck?  My friend's massage included an actual massage.\n4- the tranquility room is an open space right off the showers. there is no tranquil anything about this 'room'. No soft lighting, no blankets (I was quite chilly), no anything to make me feel I was in a special place to enjoy my quiet time.\n5- the pleasure of this experience, and i use that term kindly, cost me a whopping $175.

I told him I am on my feet all day and I have back problems so I would like him to focus on my back and to please not rub my feet. He did the total opposite. He maybe rubbed my back for 5 minutes ad did my legs and feet for the rest and the time. Then told me one of my legs were shorter than the other and I should get it checked out.

Extremely clean.  Plenty of towels available.  I did wish there was a hot tub in the area like in most spas, but there was multiple dressing areas with lockers (that had robes waiting for us), showers, a sauna and a steam room, plus the waiting area that had an assortment of teas, coffee, water with cucumber or fruit or plain water plus a nuts/dried fruit mix and a mix of chips for us to eat.  I think there were also apples.\n\nWe waited for our massages (which were 80 mins aromatherapy massages that were at a discount because they were the special promotional ones for the Thanksgiving holiday) and our massage therapists came to get us.  Come to find out now only were the rooms next to each other, it kinda was like having a \"couples\" massage anyways because the adjoining rooms actually had a door with sliding doors so it because one big room anyways.  \n\nWe thoroughly enjoyed our massages and when we were leaving, our massage therapists were there for us with water and three roses a piece.

Located in a convenient and bustling Charlotte neighborhood. Near the mall if you're into dinners or lunches at places like Maggiano's. The Phillips Place shopping center also boasts a Palm, a Dean & De Luca (why don't we have one of these yet in Atlanta??? Seriously.), a PF Chang's, and . . . some of the cutest little boutiques this little girl has ever found. Historically, I made myself decide pre-check-in if I was \"allowed to shop.\" It's that good - from Luna to everything else, so many tempting pretties, and right outside my hotel room door!\n\nThe type of service you'd expect from a busy and well run Hampton Inn, always good and reliable Internet service and a well-equipped business center if you need it - plus the whole place has an \"exterior\" that makes it look kinda like a mini White House.

A simply charming restaurant with extraordinary food, decor, and service. Once in a lifetime experience should be a must for those who find themselves in Charlotte. \r\n\r\nChef and Owner Ellen Davis has created a culinary experience of a highly choreographed six-course dinner by reservations only in elegant Victorian surrounding reminiscent of the leisurely, evening-long meals of that era.\r\n\r\nReservations a must.  On Wednesday the week of the Saturday seating, they email you a list of choices for the six (yes six) courses.  You send them back in, and when you arrive, the meal is already planned.  It is located in the historic district of Charlotte in a home built in 1891. The theme is for you to enjoy a meal the old fashioned way with ample time for all courses in a relaxed and luxurios southern mansion setting.  There is only one seating at each of the 6 tables per evening. The tables are spread throughout the home, so you feel you have your own room.  Each room is elegantly decorated in Victorian style.  We sat in the room shown in the upper right on theri website. \r\n\r\nThey have a dress code that requires jackets for gentlemen (tie at your option), and ask ladies to wear something classy.  Upscale for sure, and a hoot to dress up for the evening. \r\n\r\nSo many niceties abound, it is hard to think of McNinch House as a restaurant, but more like a royalty experience. Candles galore, soft classical music, table settings reserved for heads of state as attention to detail and your dining enjoyment is the only goal of the owner. \r\n\r\nChef and Owner Ellen Davis combines French, Southern and European styles to create a \"Continental\" menu. They are known for our Roasted Rack of Lamb with Fresh Rosemary and Dijon Mustard Crust as well as their Pecan-Crusted Baked Salmon with a Red Bell Pepper and Lime Sauce. Other signature items might be Ellen's Signature Low-Country Crab Cakes or her White Chocolate Mousse with Roasted Macadamias.\r\n\r\nWine pairings are offered for each course. We did them all.  Wonderful wines from around the world were selected by the chef.  \r\n\r\nThe food was simply scrumptious.  Every course was unique and done to perfection Simply amazing as how they could keep rolling out some of the finest served food in the nation. \r\n\r\nNeedless to say, our experience at McNinch House was \"out of this world\".  There aren't enough stars to rate this total experience. \r\n\r\nps: fare was just at $350 for the two of us with tip (and worth it!)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.mcninchhouserestaurant.com/", "business_id": "USdRzNk14UdjZWFgBJb0wA", "stars": 5, "date": "2006-09-16", "type": "review"}

First off, the house itself is incredible.

We were here celebrating and decided on the Chef's Tasting menu which is a 9-course dinner and I'm not going to belabor you all with the details of each and every dish.  I'll just say that the dishes were thoughtful, creative and cooked to perfection with the touch of a culinary artist.\n\nThe service was impeccable and not once did we feel rushed to finish or hurry along.  When you reserve here, you basically have the table for the night and that's a good thing because our dinner was over the span of 3 hours (slightly more).  We did chat it up a bit with the staff though.\n\nParking is valet only and is directly behind the house.\n\nBottom line, McNinch is a must do for locals and people visiting alike.", "business_id": "USdRzNk14UdjZWFgBJb0wA", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-09-13", "type": "review"}

When he lived in Uptown, he used to frequent the restaurant often, but it was my first time.  You could say I got my cherry popped.  Alexander Michael's is tucked away from the Uptown skyscrapers in the residential section.  You probably wouldn't see it unless you knew it was there.  It looks like it could be just another house on the quiet street.  There are no big signs for it and not a lot of discernable noise from the outside.  \n\nOnce we got inside, though, we saw that it was quite packed.  We were lucky to get seated right away in the crowded room that resembled something of an English or Irish pub.  The lighting was low and the casually dressed crowd was \"older\" than a lot of Uptown bars, so we felt like we fit in with the 30- and 40-somethings. \n\nWe started with a Woodchuck Cider (not everyone carries ciders!) and it was sweet, bubbly, and refreshing.  We enjoyed that our server wasn't overly attentive, but she was there whenever we needed to order and checked up on us only when necessary.  I tried the blackened catfish and my partner had the honey chicken.  Both were delicious.  Mine (accompanied by spicy black beans) had just the right amount of cajun flavor.  And the portion sizes were just right -- not enough to overfill you, but not enough to leave you hungry when you left.  \n\nIt was definitely an enjoyable experience, and I look forward to returning to this new (to me).  The only disappoint is that we weren't able to see the famous pole that they talked about on the back of the menu.

A side of beans satisfied an additional protein craving without the temptation of the go-to french fries.\n\nThe place is too cute explaining on the back of the menu why there is a beam in the ladies room which finds itself the victim of unsuspecting visitors who inevitably find themselves in close contact with the supporting structure.  They also give some history on the house which makes good reading while you wait for your first round to show up.  \n\nSmall complaint that again, tv in the dining area.

When we arrived, at about 5:30, it was still very quiet but began filling up fast (including other tables obviously going to the Carbon Leaf/Big Head Todd and the Monsters concert.) As soon as we walked in a server approached and guided us to a booth. \n\nFood: We started with the Crab meat Supreme Quesadilla app ($7.60). My girlfriend had the 4th Ward Stroganoff ($13.75) and I had the Feta Chicken ($13.95) as entrees. For drinks, she had a Duvel and I had a Hefeweizen and Oktoberfest on tap. \n\nAs for the starter, I was not very impressed with the quesadilla. The menu advertises it has pepper jack cheese but I detected no pepper jack, just regular monterrey jack cheese. Also, I personally got two bites of crab meat (my girlfiend had several). Given the very mild flavors of crab and monterrey jack, this was a very bland quesadilla. Granted, it did come served with sides of sour cream and salsa and I thought the salsa was pretty good. I just would have preferred the actual quesadilla to stand on its own a bit. \n\nFor the stroganoff, my girlfriend really enjoyed it and would have clean-plated it if she wasn't a carb watcher. I did steal a piece of the beef and thought it was very tasty with the red wine definitely coming through. My Feta chicken was also good (how can you go wrong with Feta?) with extra props going to the sauteed veggies that make up bed along with the penne pasta. They consisted of broccoli, mushrooms, red and green peppers and red onions. I thought they were very well cooked and the white wine/garlic saute was very tasty. The chicken itself was good though a touch overcooked but not enough to ruin the plate. Be advised that, as advertised, it does come sitting in a \"broth\" so is a wet dish. \n\nOur meal, including two pre-concert tequila shots ;-) and an appropriate tip, came to about $90 -- not cheap but we did splurge on alcohol a bit. \n\nService: Our service was excellent with our waitress obviously very familiar the menu and restaurant. As a plus, as it got busier two owner/manager types stayed available in the dining area helping out and making sure everyone's visit was up to par. \n\nAtmosphere: This must be one of the big draws as AM is in an old converted house right in the middle of a residential neighborhood. All dark wood with a gorgeous bar, its easy to imagine coming here after work to just hangout for awhile. A couple of HD TV's are present, as well.  It is a fairly tight space, however, so I also imagine there must be times when it is standing room only. \n\nFood: 7/10; Service: 9/10; Value: 7/10; Atmosphere 10/10", "business_id": "ePP0Eqz8JKSbtdt2phiB4A", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-09-20", "type": "review"}

I had been in town for about 3 hours by this time I'm really liking Charlotte. For dinner I tried something called \"What It Is\". it's a Cajun pasta dish. Being Cajun, I was hesitant to try cajun food so far away from the deep south but they came though. I considered licking the plate. I was actually sopping up the sauce with bread like I usually only do at home.

It truly is a throwback to what I imagine old neighborhood bars were like where yes, everybody did know your name and you always left with a smile on your face. Others have said it here, but I am going to go ahead and reiterate that this spot is truly a gem and all the people inhabiting the 4th Ward of Charlotte are lucky to have it. \n\nWhat makes it so special? Well, as alluded to above, the quaint neighborhood feel of the restaurant itself goes a long way and its impact cannot really be done justice by words--you just have to go there! The staff is welcoming and friendly, and you most certainly are made to feel like a regular (even if you are not like this guy). The few times that I've been here, the tavern is always filled with jovial conversations, laughter, and a real community feeling. \n\nThe food is typical American pub food fare but done extremely well. I've never been disappointed with anything that I've ordered here, nor has anyone that I've come to Al Michael's with. In terms of starters, the spicy crab soup is excellent and the black bean hummus also hits the spot. For your main grub, the ruben, half pound burger, London broil, and quinoa black bean vegetable burger (did I mention they have a surprising number of healthier options?) are staples when we go. The side dish options also bring the goods with choices such as fries, Cajun fries, spicy black beans, or a big ol' baked potato (this option probably gives you the best bang for your buck!). \n\nRight now your taste buds are most likely waking up but you're concerned about what you're going to wash all that delicious food down with. Well, stop your fretting because this spot has a rotating line-up of high quality draft beers with a huge emphasis on North Carolina beers and an even greater emphasis on Charlotte specific brews. Problem solved! On top of that, there is also a full bar and a few selections in the wine department. \n\nOh, and when is the best time to check this spot out? Right before you head out to a Panthers game of course!", "business_id": "ePP0Eqz8JKSbtdt2phiB4A", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-11-18", "type": "review"}

For only six dollars, you see a very well done, multi-voiced view of the area's history.  They make an effort to include the historical voices of the area's historically disenfranchised groups - African Americans, the poor and working classes, women, even children - alongside the mainstream presentation of history.  The exhibits describe the economic progression from farming to industry to financial business and the social and political voices that lived and influenced those economic changes.  You can get a lot of information from a couple of hours spent in the permanent exhibit.  The less permanent exhibit upstairs showcases the current changing cultural landscape as more and more ethnic and religious groups move to the area.\nI suppose my only complaint - and it isn't even really a complaint, more of a comment - is that the whole setup is a little text heavy.  There are certainly a lot of images and a few places where you can touch artifacts, watch video or listen to audio, but as other folks have mentioned your younger kids - I'd say maybe younger than 9 or 10 - or people who just don't like reading a whole lot will take much less away from this museum.

It's a lot more about Charlotte than we'd expected, which is ok if Charlotte really is emblematic of the New South. An interesting question I came away with is: What is the \"New South\"? Is it whatever \"new\" things happened after the Civil War? Is it what we have today? Is it an aspiration for the future? I'm still not sure, but am enjoying chewing on that thought.\n\nI have two major critiques of the museum's storytelling, described below, but all-in-all I liked the museum and would recommend it.\n\nOne thing that I found troubling was the celebration of exploitive lenders. I understand that Charlotte is a banking city and much of the funding for the museum probably came from bankers, so it didn't surprise me that the museum celebrated Charlotte bankers' exploitation of legal loopholes to create the too-big-to-fail banks at the epicenter of the 2008 financial crisis. BUT, it floored me that the museum attempted to justify the FORTY PERCENT interest rates that general store owners charged sharecroppers in the late 1800s and early 1900s, trapping them in an endless cycle of debt!! The museum placard said that these store-owner business men were forced to charge such high interest because they were taking on tremendous risk by lending to poor farmers. And, I kid you not, in three following panels the museum tells stories of white male owners of general stores that were able to turn the profits of their little general stores into ownership of banks and factories! Clearly, they were just getting by charging 40% interest!! (I hope the museum will investigate whether or not their interpretation of this history is, in fact, ahistorical. It should be easy to check. If general store bankruptcies were not frequent and general store profits were high, there would be no reason to believe that these businessmen were \"living on the edge\" when charging such high interest rates. In which case, it is ahistorical to suggest that they were forced by economics to charge such high rates. Furthermore, it would be crude to celebrate the three white store owners who flipped their general store profits into banks and factories. They were actually extortionists, profiting off the Klu Klux Klan terrorism that kept sharecroppers from demanding better lending terms, access to property ownership, and other reasonable things.)\n\nWhen the museum updates their 10 minute introductory film, I hope they will reconsider their portrayal of the reconstruction era. There is no mention in the film of the brief period in which blacks *did* hold elected office (and did incredible things like start public school systems that served every citizen!) before a wave of terrorism led by educated and plantation-class white men erased the gains courageously fought for and realized for seven years under Reconstruction. Instead, the film just makes a single sad mention of how blacks struggled to gain a voice in governance - with no mention that what made it \"a struggle\" was violent white-led terrorism. You'd be forgiven for leaving the theater thinking those black strugglers just must have been employing the wrong strategy. Too bad Ghandi and King hadn't come along yet, right? I'm not saying the film needed to include a graphic expose of lynchings or something. There are many tactful ways it could have acknowledged the fact that black people's capacity for quality governance and leadership was fully demonstrated during reconstruction (even if it was not full realized) and that it was the *success of white terrorism and race-bating* that erased that gain, not a *failure of black struggle*! (To be fair, their is a section of panels in the museum that explain all this, but its absence from the introductory film is lamentable because that is the only place the museum can guarantee it has the attention of every museum visitor. It's far too easy for people to see the exhibit with the Klu Klux Klan cape, think \"I already know about them\" and move on without digesting the full import of the gains that the KKK erased.)", "business_id": "udbtIhRXiehLRQoMFKvNXg", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-11-28", "type": "review"}

I  aware that my boyfriend and I went to enjoy Mortons for the first time during Queens Feast aka Restaurant Week which some may say that is why our experience was so poor. I believe this week is a way to win new patrons and to showcase what your restaurant does well. It may be a discounted price for Mortons but we are still spending our hard earned money. \n\nOur evening started out well, promptly greet by the host, who quickly found our reservation. We were slightly early so they requested that we wait for a few minutes in the bar. We may have waited 5 minutes before our table was ready. \n\nThe decor is awful and the lighting feels like you are under fluorescent. I felt like I had walked into a mans bachelor pad with the black and silver ultra mod vibe. We were seated and given water from back waiters quickly. We discussed the menu, which we had already reviewed online before we picked which restaurant we wanted to try, therefore we knew what we wanted. \n\nWe made a decision on a bottle of wine we wanted which we ordered from the manager. At this point we still had not seen our server. Once the server finally made his way to our table he was very pushy about trying to get us not to eat off the restaurant week menu. It was obvious he was disappointed that we were there to partake in RW. \n\nWe finally made the server understand that we weren't going to do anything over than RW and wine. I ordered the tuna tartare as my starter which took a very long time to reach our table but was delicious. My second course was the Filet (Med Rare) prepared Oscar style with Bearnaise sauce on the side. We waited and waited... Then waited some more. \n\nThere was a large private event which I am assuming took preciseness over us. Even with that being said our server just disappeared!!! I poured my own wine refills. We were sitting there wondering what was taking so long for our steaks and he didn't come by to offer an update. When the steak came out I cut into mine and it was Well Done!!!! My boyfriends steak was also over cooked, he ordered Rare and received MedWell! They took our steaks and then we waited again... Mine comes out covered in Bearnaise sauce!!! I requested sauce on the side because I don't like sauce on my steak, only on the asparagus. Eventually they bring my steal out correct. \n\nWe ate our dinner quickly because of how hungry we were. Very little apology from the staff about the horrible experience. Our table was cleared and the server brings out the dessert which AGAIN was wrong! He rolled his eyes at us when I told him, this isn't our fault that he is getting our order wrong! \n\nEven at the discounted price we paid for Queens Feast we felt robbed. Our server still made good money from us, we never tip poorly but we felt he didn't deserve it. The experience was absolutely horrible and my boyfriend and I vowed to never visit again. \n\nI received an email, from the automated system, asking how our experience was so I wrote the manager telling him about our experience and he never even bothered answering me. \n\nIf you want to enjoy a nice steak dinner take your money to Capital Grille or Flemings!", "business_id": "Lt9o2RmacVY2L-IWLA8uTg", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-11-16", "type": "review"}

So much so that you'll want to go when the place isn't crowded so that you have a reasonable chance of looking it over before ordering so as not to get in the way of anyone else.  That generally doesn't happen in most hot dog stands, either on the street or indoors because you have about two choices: All the way or plain, where you add your own condiments.\n\nAnd the rest...\n\nThough you can find Italian Beef and Chicago-style dogs in the same place, you don't always want to.  Focus on your specialty.  And that's the real problem here.  There is so much going on - visually and on the grill - that they don't seem to do anything really well.\n\nThough the staff is nice enough, and food is decent, it's just not that great.  Fries are limp.  House-made chips are nice and thin, but they are so thin that they can't support anything (dressing, chili leavings from dogs, not even the crunch from the fryer).

Like Nicole said, is it the best Chicago dog I've ever had? Not even close. Is it the best Chicago dog in Charlotte? I say YES. They've got the traditional ingredients down pat, the Vienna beef sausage (yes, that's what a \"hot dog\" is.....an encased meat sausage), the neon green relish, the steamed poppy seed bun (which is the quintessential defining part of a Chicago dog), sport peppers, tomato, a pickle and MUSTARD (Chicago dogs NEVER, repeat, NEVER EVER use Ketchup!). \n\nSo I got a Chicago Dog and a special called the Fire Dog today which was a spicy Polish sausage with grilled onions, brown mustard and I opted for the sauerkraut. It was a good dog, with all the flavors expected. Fries are usually good here, but my criticism is that they lack some seasonings.....hell use Lawry's Seasoned Salt or something and fry them a tad longer to get more of a crisp on them. They're not bad but certainly CAN be better!\n\nBeing a lover of Portillos, Mr. Beef and Al's in Chicago, Matt's version of Chicago Beef is just meh.....sausage isn't bad but their beef just isn't flavorful enough for my tastes. I mean it's not bad, just not up to my expectation from what I remember from back home. OK now I'm being picky and critical.....me bad. \n\nFor first time visitors, just know that the portions are NOT very big (at least for the dogs). Recommend getting a combo with 2 Chicago Dogs or a combo Beef/Sausage. Even the females in my group complained that one dog wasn't quite enough. Jumbo dog is also an option. They should offer a TWO DOG JUMBO combo for us bigger eaters.\n\nSo overall I love Matt's as it does provide me with a LITTLE taste of home. I can only hope that SOMEONE opens up a REAL CHICAGO PIZZA place here in Charlotte....while I love thin pizza, there IS MUCH BETTER out there so please someone, open a Giordano's here!

After stalking tickets for Motown the Musical, I finally discovered that you can get a ticket with a student ID starting 2 hours before the show for $25. There was no line to purchase tickets, as the show was nearly sold out. The ticket guys were friendly and I was fortunate to get what I felt was the best seat in the house, Grand Tier center (F 311 to be exact).\n\nWhen I returned later for the show, the ushers, who are primarily comprised of senior citizens.... not sure how that happens.... were very kind and helpful. The visuals and acoustics of the show were amazing. The great thing about the Blumenthal is that there is NO bad seat in the house. No matter where you are sitting, you will be able to see and hear. It is very well designed.\n\nI think you can often judge a venue by its restrooms. During intermission, the line was SO Long. However, there were ushers in the restroom, which had 48 stalls. Having people direct patrons to stalls was immensely helpful and the line moved very swiftly. While there is an individual unisex restroom upstairs, the better option is to get in the longer line downstairs. Overall, a great place and I highly recommend you see any show there, as all I've attended have been nothing shy of fantastic.", "business_id": "IFwRwGoz4B7glSzA84NWcg", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-09-08", "type": "review"}

It can get very difficult to move, either upstairs or down, but sometimes you can move out to the patio on nice nights & find some breathing room.\n\nAs for the atmosphere, Ri Ra has just never really done anything special for me. I just think of this place as a nicer bar that's always crowded, so I'm always looking to get out of there when my friends want to stay. They have live bands some nights & that just adds to the claustrophobia of the upstairs. If you can get a table, the place isn't as bad, with a good beer selection & excellent bar tab system. You can open your tab at either the upstairs or downstairs bar & then proceed to order from either bar. This takes away from the hassle of always having to go back to the same bar you opened your tab at.\n\nOther than a nice setting inside, Ri Ra just never seems to impress me and/or make me want to come back again. I'm sure there is a reason the place is always packed, so I guess I'm just out of the loop on loving this place.

And that experience confirmed my assumption that it's a good place to party.\n\nNow, last Saturday, I found out that it's a great place for a date with the significant other, too. She loved it. I mean, happy wife, hapoy life, right? She was born in Europe so anything that Europe-like will imoress her. The fact that it's laid back type of place (and not the snobby places I usually like) also made her like it. But hey, we go there to eat and drink, right? Well, they hit it right out of the park with her basic beef burger, my NC grass fed beef stew with Guiness, the fries, and of course, beer!\n\nWe chose the dessert wasn't exactly her style because she likes soft, creamy browines but theirs was a bit dry. Maybe it's an Irish thing. But hey I eat anything (except apples). Oh, the rye bread!! How did I leave this till the end. We thought it was one of the best we had.

My husband and I popped in to catch a rugby match and the atmosphere was fantastic. They have giant movie screen with surround sound and the place was filled with Irish fans, my husband was thrilled (I wish I could say the same for the outcome of the match!). We ordered a few Guinness, of course... Which were all fresh, tasty, and poured correctly.  My husband had the lamb sliders, with red onion, curried mayo and goat cheese. The mini burgers were deliciously unique and cooked to perfection.  I opted for a chopped salad that had everything you could want, grilled chicken, avocado, tomato, red onion. The salad was lightly dressed and with two rustic slices of brown soda bread and Kerry Gold butter, it was a very generous portion. Very tasty and bonus points for the butter. \nBecause we were watching the match I decided to finish off the meal with an Irish coffee.  Which can be risky... They actually serve it the correct way!  Coffee, Irish Whiskey (Powers was my choice), sugar and fresh cream. Simple, and delicious!

Easily enough food for three people, I found myself wolfing down perfectly cooked rice, tasty bits of chicken, and huge pieces of pineapple.

[I will edit this when I get their names.] Love the smoothies in the AM! Also, when the Concierge Lounge isn't open for breakfast on weekends, they give you vouchers for their AYCE buffet downstairs. \n- Bellboys: very attentive\n- Location: right in the center of Uptown (in my opinion) and close to my work area. About a 5 minute walk to a central bus station and I believe the train station is nearby. Less than 10 minute walk to the Time Warner Cable arena and not that far from the Bank of America stadium.\n- Early Check In: has been granted every time I've come in earlier than check in time.\n\nAverage:\n- Clean & Decent Sized Rooms: not expecting too much here as I really just need the shower + bed \n- Gym: Cardio & weight room is decently sized (for a hotel). Their pool is a standard size. Yoga mats (+ space) are available. Open till 10/11 PM.\n- Restaurants: I've had decent food that I can pick up from the Champions restaurant, order to pick up time is consistent (~15-20 min). \n\nCons:\n- Rooms: all rooms generally have the same layout / I have never been upgraded to a room that's bigger. I've only been upgraded to a room that's on a higher floor. Also, try changing rooms if you're given the rooms located underneath the concierge lounge. Starting at 6:30am, all you will hear are footsteps and chairs moving around. Lastly, beware if you request a room near the elevator as it's generally near the vending machine/ice room. When they're restocking the vending machine, you're going to have a hard time sleeping through that. \n- Occasionally, super loud people can be heard through the walls/doors (but this isn't really the hotel's fault...)\n- Occasionally booked solid during busy weeks in Charlotte (they host a lot of events and there's the annual basketball tournament)\n- WiFi: isn't free for non-Rewards members.

We had a party of approx. 10 people. We were seated in the back corner and given plenty of space for our party which was nice, considering it was primetime on a Saturday night.\n\nThat was pretty much when the good things I have to say about the restaurant end. Our server, from beginning to end, was slow. I would post his name, but I don't know if that's against Yelp rules. I ordered a honey dijon chicken sandwich with french fries. The fries were mediocre at best (not hot, plain tasting) and the sandwich was pretty poor. I don't know how you can screw up grilled chicken, cheese, bacon and honey dijon sauce. The bottom of the bun was completely soggy and the sandwich as a whole was bland. Our guest of honor (the birthday girl) ordered a steak which she had to return because it was almost raw inside. She had asked for medium well. Several members of our group DID, however, like their food.\n\nGoing back to the service, several members of our party waited several minutes for drink refills. Also, we had to flag our waiter down for our checks after waiting close to (if not more than) 20 minutes. Even after we gave him our checks and credit cards, he took close to another 10 minutes to bring them back. \n\nOur best guess is that he knew he was adding an 18% gratuity to our checks because of our party size, so he took his time doing everything. I seriously considered crossing out the 18% and leaving 10% and noting on the tab that the service didn't warrant the 18%, but in the end, I opted against it.\n\nDefinitely will not return.", "business_id": "ym9QwkmB5ZKTyj7q5huTDw", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-11-20", "type": "review"}

Another review, and this time from the well known Rock Bottom in downtown Charlotte. I came here with a friend who wanted some of their beer as well as their food. And sadly, I wasn't impressed. Inside though they completely changed the outlay of the dining area from the last time I came here, which was about 2 years ago... They added ramps as well as new things to look at and admire, such as the glass between booths and some paintings. But, overall it's all the same with the looks and what not.\n\nI had two things from the menu: Fish Tacos (RB Taco) and the Southwestern Chili.\n\nNow, the good first. Southwestern Chili. It was awesome, I felt like it was very good and chunky. However, I wish the portion was just a wee bit bigger just because it was so tasty!\n\nAnother plus was the service. My friend ordered a steak and it was a little overcooked, the waiter completely understood and took it back to get another steak cooked medium rare. It was fast and I believe even the manager came up to fix the problem. They offered a soup or whatever, but my friend declined (I was wondering why he didn't get me another chili!)\n\nNow the bad. Eating the Fish Tacos was like grabbing a handful of seasoned salt and then eating it. Every single bite was just a burst of not just salt, but just sodium with a little heat kicked in, but that was probably from the amount of salt and it made it seem spicier. After drinking water, it was still stuck in my mouth. Kick back the salt Rock Bottom and pull out that flavor of the fish! After all, it is a fish taco.\n\nOverall, not bad, food is average. Service is pretty good though. Next time though, I'm sticking away from those tacos.", "business_id": "ym9QwkmB5ZKTyj7q5huTDw", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-11-27", "type": "review"}

The spirit and wine offerings were also pretty good with a solid variety of wines and the usual spirits (with some fun cocktail options).\n\nThe menu is huge and offers enough to please anyone.  Our server was extremely sweet, quick, and very knowledgeable of the menu.  She passed the test when she offered solid beer recommendations with food pairings.  The food was surprisingly good.

For less than $7 per lunch, you're walking out of there with a good experience, good food, and it happens fast.  \n\nI'd love to see some occassional seasonal or straight up menu changes from time to time, but pretty much every little food joint in Latta is limited to what they can actually offer.  It is what it is - if you want a decent value hibachi for less than $7, that's the spot.

It was very, very bad. Very bad. So very bad that I'm writing my first Yelp review.\n\nSummary: Some of the food was decent, but everything else is so so very very bad that it's not worth it. I will tell people not to go there and I will never go back.\n\n[The BAD.]\n\nThere was one guy playing hostess/waiter/bartender/bus boy, hitherto referred to as HWBBB. \n\nWe went there specifically to sit on the patio because the weather was awesome, but were told we couldn't because the HWBBB was the only one on staff.\n\nThe temperature in the restaurant was HOT. Stifling. Not normal. 70 outside, 85 inside.\n\nThe menu was schizophrenic. I had no idea what to order. Sushi, pitas, pizzas, steak. Plus a \"build a 3-course meal\" option. I felt like I was reading the menu at Cheesecake Factory. \n\nThey played dance music? Which is just weird in a restaurant setting.\n\nThey were out of several things. I asked the HWBBB, \"What beers do you have on draft?\" He said, \"We only have 2. We usually have 4 but we ran out of 2 today.\" So I'm already disappointed and I don't even know what they have yet. My husband ordered a glass of Malbec and the HWBBB came back and said they didn't have it.\n\nMy order was wrong. I ordered a side salad in lieu of fries. I received an entr\u00e9e salad in addition to my meal, which still came with fries. I ordered a chicken kebob sandwich and received a beef kebob sandwich. We decided things were so bad at this point that I didn't tell the HWBBB of his error. I sucked it up and ate the stupid beef.\n\nThe beef was very pink in the middle and was of extremely poor quality. Maybe stew meat. I chewed each piece the point I'd realize it wasn't going to break down any further and then spit out what remained. I'm usually not such a disgusting dining companion but this place brought out the best in me. I kept wishing for a normal chewable digestible piece but ended up eventually spitting out every single piece of beef.\n\nWe had a groupon and when the HWBBB brought the bill we got lectured on all the items the groupon did not apply towards. Like alcohol (fine) and the $20 3 course meal my husband ordered, \"because that's already a deal, but I'll make an exception, just this once.\"\n\nWe settled the bill before the dessert from my husband's meal came. Our HWBBB was puzzled that we were still sitting there and eventually asked what else he could do for us. We asked if he could bring the dessert we ordered. \n\nThe apple crisp was like flour and sugar mixed with 3 apple chunks, stuck in the microwave on high for 10 minutes, topped with ice cream.\n\n[The not so bad.]\n\nThe beef tasted good, even if I couldn't chew it.\n\nMy husband's shawarma was good.\n\nThe tzatziki sauce was very good.\n\nThe pita bread was good.\n\nThe salads were ok.\n\nThe curly fries that came with our meals were reminiscent of Jack 'n' the box, one of many other places I dislike but would rather have eaten at.", "business_id": "9fxTX1uyyYF4ugx68AG2sg", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-11-16", "type": "review"}

FOOD. The restaurant (Ember, Bar 10) is a pretty terrible and relatively expensive choice. Examples: Omelet = $18, and it is greasy, tasteless, and they used canned mushrooms; Breakfast buffet (the reason I got the omelet) is typically left to become stale and lukewarm; Dinner choices are typically salty (i.e. Fattoush salad) and greasy (i.e. sandwiches and burgers). I will say that the pancakes were excellent, but they are not the best (nor do they beat Hyatt's pancakes). \n\n2. LOCATION. While the Omni and other comparable hotels surround restaurants, shopping, and other area attractions, this hotels is 5 blocks from anywhere (even a pharmacy). Need I say more?\n\n3. SERVICE. No doorman, concierge has no good suggestion but \"Try Ember,\" and housekeeping seems to come only when you are in your room. On housekeeping, I am also quite sure they do not even vacuum as some cracker crumbs I spilled were still there TWO days later. They also tend to forget some essential (i.e. washcloth or soap). \n\nIf this were a cheap, sub-$100 per night hotel, I would manage. For Charlotte, which is not terribly in demand, this hotel should be spotless, sexy, or at least charming.

It looks so cool outside with their chic building design, concierge service, and a lot of the amenities you'd expect from such an establishment. So why the low rating? I'll elaborate!\n\nThe positives? My room on the 25th floor had a pretty cool view. The beds are super comfy and fluffy. The rest of the room is just okay. The room and bath I'll be nice and call cozy. There's free wifi, the ubiquitous minibar with astonishing prices, and a nice breakfast.\n\nHere's the bad points. Staying here treats you to surly employees that don't even look at you when answering a question. I mean seriously why you gotta be so mean to me after I checked out?! I asked if I could get my parking validated since I didn't have a room key to get out for free anymore, and parking is some ridiculous price of about $7 per hour. So preoccupied with his little computer screen he was that he didn't even look at me and waved me off with a we don't validate parking here, pay the machine on your way out. Seriously? I know I look a bit young and my clothes were kinda grungy when I left but the housekeeping when I first got here was nicer to me than you were. At least she made sure I got to where I was going when I was looking a bit lost.\n\nSo I ended up paying the parking fee of $7, but I think I'll be heading to the Ritz Carlton in the future where I'm sure they'll at least treat me with some modicum of respect instead of treating me like I came in off the street begging for some change.", "business_id": "4nFqPL-glgDm9v7bZptskQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-09-28", "type": "review"}

Located at the end of Uptown (?), I did walk up Tryon and College St. a bit to check out the rest of the Uptown area, and it was no more than 10-15 minutes walking to the different restaurants.\n\nFor a Westin, it is one of the newer ones I've been to.  Westin really knows how to design their lobby and create a spacious setting.  The lobby is relaxed and oddly welcoming, which you can't really say about a lot of hotels.\n\nThe staff was courteous and we checked in with no problem.  The rooms were a nice surprise as it is fairly spacious.  All the usual amenities are there, such as internet, LCD TV etc, and who doesn't love the Heavenly bed and the shower heads??  Although one thing I didn't like was definitely the lack of a mini-fridge.  They only had the mini-bar fridge and you have to request a key to unlock it.  Even after you do unlock it, there's no room for you to put anything there, and I was too afraid of getting charged if anything was moved.\n\nInternet does cost around $13 a night, which is fairly high, but at this point, I've accepted the charges for internet is an expense I will be paying.\n\nThe gym at this Westin is amazing.  The gym is connected to the pool with a \"refresh area\" after you swim.  The gym itself is quite big, especially for hotel standards!  Bikes, elliptical, plenty of treadmills, and a few weight-training machines.  All the cardio machines have their own TV and if you have your headphones, you can just plug it in.  Even if you don't have headphones, they have disposable headphones there that you can use for free!  They also provide fresh towels, as well as water dispensers.  I definitely took advantage of the gym while I stayed there.\n\nAs for the conference space, it does a pretty good job, with plenty of meeting rooms and ballrooms.  Of course, the conference i was attending only had several hundred of people, which isn't that big for a conference.  Caterting was done right near the escalators.\n\nI didn't eat the restaurants on location since most of the meals were taken care of by the conference but I did check it price... and I would definitely venture out and explore the city a bit.  For the same price, I could probably check out a nice steakhouse around the area.\n\nWould definitely try to stay here again next time if I'm able to visit Charlotte again!", "business_id": "4nFqPL-glgDm9v7bZptskQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-11-10", "type": "review"}

When I subsequently ordered a double it came back with a shot floating in the top and... wait for it.... the charge was $24. Yep, you read that right - they charged me for TWO drinks (and for some reason added on a $2/drink charge). \n\nI asked for snacks, and they served me some peanut things that were wet. I guess the dish was still wet from the dishwasher. So it was soggy snacks.\n\nAnd finally, one of my drinks was served in a hot glass (straight from the washer??) So it's quickly melting and getting warm. Bartending 101 dudes. I knew the score because the night before a woman asked for them to repour her martini in a COLD glass. Apparently her glass was hot. At the time I was thinking - what a b*tch, but then it happened to me. Sigh.\n\nThey also charge for internet usage, because apparently the owners think it's 1995.\n\nI didn't stay at the restaurant. My friends said it was $26 for a breakfast buffet. Ouch.\n\nParking will add another $20 / night.\n\nThese little things added up. The Westin has this vibe of trying to be a nice fancy uppity hotel - people waiting to call cabs for you (we used Uber, half the price), and when my bill was emailed to me they called it a \"guest folio\" instead of a \"bill\".... all fancyshmancypantsy - but the thing is they miss the details like a competent bar, and they nickel and dime you for things like internet... in 2015.\n\nPros: Clean, predictable rooms, fast elevator, people watching.\nCons: Bar is hot mess, nickled and dimed for fees, beige.", "business_id": "4nFqPL-glgDm9v7bZptskQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-11-23", "type": "review"}

In my experience the ultra-luxury hotels keep a respectful distance from the less-fancy brands. But if one of your hotel fantasies is to stay really close to a Ritz Carlton, Charlotte can make your dreams come true ... it's just gonna cost ya' a couple of Benjamins.    \n\nSee, the deal with all of the hotels at Charlotte City Center (Holiday Inn, Ritz Carlton, Aloft, Omni, et. al.) is that they are in very close proximity to one another and the City Center.  They are all within a 4 to 5 block range, so you are definitely paying for location.  But it's a good location if you're trying to take in downtown or you have pursuits at the City Center.      \n\nSo, about the Holiday Inn - I like the fancy, modern furniture in the lobby.  I appreciated that it is a very tall hotel and on the side where my room was, it looked out at an art deco office building. So it was amusing to watch the workers doing their work thing as I whiled away the hours at Le Holiday Inn.  \n\nThe room was comfortable and had some nice touches, including an ipod docking station, FREE wi-fi (which seems a bit scarce in Charlotte) and two types of pillows with helpful, little signs denoting them as \"Firm\" and \"Soft\".  I love it when my pillows communicate with me, so I know what I'm getting myself into.   \n\nThe hotel also has a feature that I have never encountered before.  On the roof - which also houses the pool - there is a painted \"track\" for aerobic activities.  I tried it out for running, but I found that an open rooftop on a cold, windy, and rainy day makes for an unpleasant exercise experience.  In my brief little jaunt around the track, I appreciated their thoughtfulness and decided that this feature is probably better for walkers than runners.  Nonetheless, I think it's the thought that counts.  \n\nOverall, I liked the room, had pleasant customer service experiences, and would be willing to stay there again if I went back to Charlotte City Center ...", "business_id": "Fi5sQxROyTLp5qDuYKz6bQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-11-30", "type": "review"}

There were a few customer service issues I had that I'd like to mention so that others are aware. \n\n1- I booked the block of rooms 3 months in advance via the 1-800 number on the website. I have a military ID and requested the military discount. I was given the discounted rate for all 5 rooms and was told I only needed to present my ID upon arrival. Unfortunately, when I arrived the girl at the check-in counter told me that I could not have all 5 rooms at the discounted rate, that I could only have two of them. I pitched a royal fit and 40 minutes later they gave me all 5 rooms at the rate that I was quoted. Bad way to start a fun occasion.\n\n2- I emailed back and forth with Tracy Bernstein about specifics that I needed for this gathering I was hosting (iPod player, Microwave, Fridge, Early Check-in). I was told these things would be ready and they were not. We never got the iPod player, Microwave or Fridge. Bad customer service, Tracy.\n\nNOW, I'd like to tell you about the wonderful things at Holiday Inn City Center. \n\n1- Very clean and modern. I loved the decor and it made great back drops for my photography.\n\n2- The rooms had adjoining doors which made it very easy for our guests to mingle.\n\n3- Jay Jay at the front desk was so friendly and helpful. He arranged a private limo service for us beautiful ladies for a great price. I've been told he has the \"hookup\" so make sure you get with him if you need anything special. \n\n4- Adam is the food and beverage manager and he was so good to me. He offered to bring a 6 foot table in to our room with table cloths for FREE. Are you serious? FREE? He even came by the room to make sure we got all that I requested and warn us about the no noise policy starting at 11pm. We very happily toned it down by that point. \n\nThe stay at the hotel was wonderful and the event was great.

There are great concrete paths that weave in and around the grounds. One loop is about 1.5 miles by the way, if you're trying to get a sense of how much ground you're covering. It can be hilly at times, so be warned. \n\nElmwood is also popular with dog walkers, although there was an issue a few months back about dogs being off their leashes, but that has since been settled. Most people have their dogs on leashes now, although a few stragglers are yet to get the with program. If you're looking to socialize your dog or meet other dog owners, Elmwood after 5 pm is a good place to head. \n\nBut more than anything, it's just a nice place to take a quiet walk (again, assuming you're able to ignore the graves or appreciate them).

So I started hunting for jobs and kept running into the same problem--all of them required an MBA.\n\nNowadays, an MBA is what a BA was 10-20 years ago.  It's kind of the standard now.  To even be considered, you have to have this degree, so then I set out about finding a place that wouldn't only give me classes but give me the intangibles that set exceptional people apart from the rest.\n\nSo I looked at Wake Forest, and I looked at UNCC, and I looked at Chapel Hill and found the same trend--they showed me all the bells and whistles of their program (the updated technology, the facts and figures about success rates, the name dropping you could do), but none of those programs really had substance.  I'd take some classes, learn enough to get good grades, and I'm done.\n\nWhen I visited Queens, not only did Dean Shiffler present the school in a positive light (which is expected), one of the current students did.  Unsolicited.  I was walking around the grounds, struck up a conversation, they were in the program I was interested in, and he gave me the run-down.  It was an honest assessment, and that meant more to me than anything else.\n\nI'm in my second year now in the PMBA program, and I'll tell you this--I will never regret this decision.  I still have a ways to go, but I've learned more than just finance and stocks and bonds and amortization and cost/benefit analyses and all the other information you'll learn in an MBA program.  I've learned about myself.  I've discovered that my vision for my professional path was almost non-existent and I was at a point in my life where I was going nowhere fast.  They truly invest in you here.  It's a small school, which is just what you need.  It's competitive, but rewarding.  Students really build a community here.  You're not just a number--professors remember you by name (or at least face), they're accessible, they listen, and most importantly, they approach their jobs as a person first, and a \"Dr\" second.  \n\nI'd be willing to speak to anyone about the PMBA program at Queens; I have learned some invaluable lessons already as a result.  Aside from the beautiful campus, you get a sense of belonging here--Southern charm at it's best.

For shorthand math, that's 25 minutes on the phone. At this point in time, I'm just praying I don't get disconnected. She FINALLY comes back and asks for my forwarding address, of which I have to repeat no less than 5 times to her. \n\nMe: \"Ok. Just to clarify -- My service is cancelled, correct?\"\nLess-than-able TWC Employee: \"Yes.\"\nMe: \"You have my forwarding address for my last bill, correct?\"\nLess-than-able TWC Employee: \"Yes. Is there anything else I can help you with today?\"\n\n......\"help?\" I was almost insulted that she used that as a descriptor. \"Help\" isn't something that TWC provides. They provide song and dance and circumvention as opposed to service. \n\nThe story doesn't end there. I had to go to this location on Morehead to return the modem we rented. BAD IDEA. It's the saddest place on earth. They opened the doors at 8am and the one woman behind the counter had a small line of \"eager\" customers. She barely paid any mind to anyone and then said, with little to no interest, \"Can I help who's next?\" Then, randomly, she just left and started bringing boxes in to the room one by one.....WHY? Nobody knows. \n\nI got to the counter, returned the modem as swiftly as possible to the rather sad employees, and hastily left the non-existent customer service clubhouse TWC runs there. It was unreal. The whole experience, from start to finish, was the most agonizing exchange I've ever had to go through. Completely malarkey.  \n\nMoral of the story: If you want to do \"business\" with TWC, beware.", "business_id": "vKtMsWeAaThimXGo9Ic_Og", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-09-04", "type": "review"}

I called in 2 full weeks ahead of my requested disconnection date, just to make sure everything would go smoothly. After holding for an hour, I finally talked to a lady who scheduled the disconnect, gave me a confirmation number, and everything. We went to return the equipment at the local TWC office; waited in line over an hour to turn in the equipment. \n\n2 weeks later, I check the internet - they still don't show my service disconnected. I get on line with a chat agent at TWC, and he says I'll have to call and they have no record of me disconnecting. I got very upset at the thought of calling and holding for another hour to talk to someone so I really let him have it. He then agreed to disconnect me as of 9/6, like it was some sort of favor to me. Never mind the fact that I even had the cancellation number from the phone call. \n\nSo today I look online again, and they show that I owe them $25. Actually, they owe ME $25 for the week of service I paid for and hadn't used. So, I get online again, and guess what? the chat agent that I talked to 2 weeks ago didn't set my disconnect for the original date. Instead he did it 2 weeks after! \n\nSo I got online with another chat agent today who once again apologized and is \"escalating my case\". I've now spent over 6 hours trying to help the incompetent CSR's at TWC to actually do this correctly. Meanwhile, we've had AT&T now for over a month. Guess what? Not a SINGLE outage, not a single disruption. And customer service is prompt and helpful. \n\nI will never, ever sign up for TWC again. I don't care if I have to go without TV someday vs. paying TWC another cent. They should be a Harvard case study on how to run your business in such an incompetent, offensive way that you actually lose customers for life.

Listen to these awful reviews and go with someone else.  \n\nTime Warner Cable has got to be the worst company that exists.  I have been through a ridiculous amount just to get cable installed.  When it was finally installed, I still had issues.  I call them almost daily at this point.  They have made me cry at this point it's been so frustrating and such a horrible experience.  I invested so much time, it didn't seem worth it to cancel, but I really wish I had canceled before I wasted too much time.  \n\nHere's my story:  \n\nI'm new to the area, so I google cable and got time warner cable.  I signed up for a promotional package around $100/month, which I was happy with and scheduled an installation date.  I waited around for the technician, and he didn't show up in the window they gave me.  I called time warner, and they said he should be there soon, but they'd send him a message.  I waited around longer, and he didn't show up still.  I called back, and they said he put in a notification that I wasn't home, which was a complete lie.  I rescheduled, for 2 days later and was told they'd waive the $30 appointment fee.  Great - no internet and TV for another 2 days.  So, I leave work early for a second time to meet the next technician and he actually showed up.  But, it quickly went downhill from there.  Long story short, he was at my house for a total of 6 hours.  He spent about 3 hours running around the house looking for who knows what, and eventually called his boss.  At this point, it was 7 PM.  His boss came and took a look and told him what to do.  Around 9 PM he comes in from outside, and starts tinkering around.  Around 9:30, he has a cable box and modem in my house, but nothing is hooked up and he's been at my house since 3:45 PM.  I get a call on my cell phone, and it is for the technician.  Weird to say the least.  So, he talks to the guy for way to long - it would be more appropriate to tell the guy he'd call him on his own cell phone, but whatever.  It's getting late, and he walks outside.  After about 15 - 20 minutes, he doesn't come back.  My husband goes outside to check on him, because it's getting close to 10 PM and we want to get to bed.  The guy is packing up his truck.  Apparently he got fired for taking too long to install.  So, he leaves. We still have no cable or internet, no clue what shape he left his work in.  At this point, I'm furious.  But I wasted 6 hours sitting around at home already so I decide not to cancel.  I call Time Warner to complain and all they can offer is a reschedule and say a Time Warner technician will come out instead of the contract company.  \n\nSo, the next day, I leave work for a 3rd time (first week on the new job, not something I wanted to be doing).  Another technician comes out and spends about an hour installing and we are finally hooked up.  The other guy apparently was a huge idiot and had no idea what he was doing.  These guys fixed his mistake and got us hooked up.  But still, I have now invested 10 hours of my time to watch some TV - way too much. \n\n2 days later, we try to watch TV and realize the cable box is a piece of junk.  I now have to go into the store and exchange it.  \n\nA few days later, I get a bill in the mail.  A bill for $250! Insane.  Apparently the promotion I signed up for was not what was entered.  So now I spend an hour on the phone negotiating my bill.  They aren't able to get the exact promotion I signed up for, but it's close.

My colleague is a regular there, so we were greeted warmly and our greeter (who happened to also be an active local judge???) shared with us some stories from his recent trip to Paris. My meal started with a cream of tomato soup, that was much thicker than I had anticipated, but still very tasty. Lunch was a Carolina Crab Cake Salad which was fabulous. Nice view of downtown Charlotte outside our window table from which we were able to watch a rain storm pass, thankfully, before heading back to work.", "business_id": "df7cda6f5lMADGnoVHd8pg", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-10-29", "type": "review"}

I never went to the Charlotte Convention Center prior to November of 2014, so I can't speak for past reviews, but it seems to me the Convention center has been modernized, and thanks to some new ballrooms in the NASCAR plaza next door, expanded greatly. I was there for the Charlotte International Auto Show in November (don't ask why I decided to write this today) and the main exhibition hall was incredibly large. Yes, I'm sure there are bigger ones somewhere else, the transplants in this town will be the first to tell you that, but frankly, in regards to location, and not to mention close proximity to not only the central bus terminal, but also the Lynx Blue Line (which runs through the convention center!) the CCC is probably one of the best urban convention centers out there. My only complaint is the lack of an attached hotel. I do want to make clear though, there are literally dozens or accommodations nearby, but nothing on site or accessible via sky-walk. If you insist on not utilizing the light rail or bus, there is parking available nearby. Especially on weekends where you may be lucky and locate a street spot for free. During the week I'd recommend keeping it in a deck and leaving it there until you're done. I elected not to eat at the convention center, but locating decent food, especially during the day shouldn't be too hard, During the workday many of the restaurants in the Overstreet Mall are open, not to mention some places like FUEL pizza just across the way, and more expensive options if you're having an occasion, I'm sure Yelp could help you find what you need in that respect.

Having the oppurtunity to meet several people who talked highly of this restaurantbi was highly excited to find out id be going to brunch.\nMy friend and i went to brunch and we split the butternut crunch salad, bank moon and the pork belly holendaise. My favorite dish was the salad. Totally dig the julliened raw butternut squah. Apples we're a good accompinmentt. The bank moon was a traditional vietnameese sandwich with a knock ur socks off aioli. The pork belly hollendaise was to be honest not the best i have had due to the hollendaise lacking much seasoning but at least it was freshly made win lhocal eggs. Perhaps a little more lemon and salt? The pork belly was deliscious and not incredably fatty which means it was properly rendered. Im not a grit fan but hey im a northerner. \nOverall the searvice was amazing friendly and attentive.

Rather than eating there, I decided I would have a better time eating back at my hotel since there wasn't much going on at the restaurant.  It wasn't until on the walk back I realized that the steam from the hot foods probably softened up the fried chicken!  I was prepared to be disappointed...\n\nBUT the amazing thing was that the chicken leg quarter that I ordered was not only juicy, but the skin had somehow retain much of it's crispiness.  As I start to gnaw into the fried chicken, with each bite I was amazed at how flavorful it is.  Didn't need any sauce or anything, it was tasty as is.  Like I mentioned, the chicken is juicy.  Dark meat is always the way to go for me for fried chicken!\n\nWith the fried chicken, I also got to choose two sides, so I went for the yams and mac & cheese.  Lots of spices for the yams, and I like how it still retained its chunky form.  As for the mac & cheese, I only liked the part where the cheese had caramelized.  Not too special to me.\n\nIt also comes with this awesome cornbread and softened sweet butter.  Cornbread + butter is seriously one of the best combos.  I know butter is good with a lot of things, but when you have a tasty cornbread, butter just enhances it so well!\n\nEven with it steaming in its own heat for around 10 minutes as I walked back to the hotel, the chicken was still awesome.

The fried chicken is excellent and I don't think I would ever order anything different here.  I've had the salmon cakes and the pulled pork BBQ, both were just OK.  Just get the chicken and thank me later!  The corn bread they bring you during lunch and dinner is amazing.  It's always been piping hot and serves as a nice base for your meal.  The sides are pretty good, nothing mind blowing, but I enjoy them every time (mac & cheese, mashed potatoes, collard greens, etc.).\n\nNow for the bad: the service and breakfast fare.  I've had spotty service several times.  My mother wanted to substitute a few small things on the menu and her requests were all denied the last time we were there.  Very unaccommodating.  A small upcharge was not even suggested.  I reeeeally can't sub the biscuit for cornbread?  Come on.  I also saw her split a half bottle of Andre (Yes, the $5 bottle at the grocery store) into 6 mimosas.  I didn't taste a lick of champagne.  At $6.50 each I expect better.  The breakfast food wasn't anything to write home about either.  I got the Creole omelette and it had no flavor at all on top of having teeny, tiny shrimp.  The breakfast potatoes were the best part.  Sad.  Just avoid the breakfast food and you'll be fine.", "business_id": "mpDxBBGywUE6GRRKja3sBA", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-11-26", "type": "review"}

The tea ninjas (or wait-staff) make sure our cups never runneth empty and might tell us some jokes here and there. We'd always eat our vegetables if they were like the ones here: macaroni and cheese (I know, not a vegetable), collard greens (got a little pico de gallo), and the okra stew are some of the best. The Daily Fixin's have some classic choices like fried chicken and catfish, but I really love the salmon cakes, which come with sauce that'd be great on burgers. You'll be fuller than a piggy bank on pay day, but some banana puddin'(g) is a spectacular dessert.\n\nI love the album cover decorations and the music that comes from them-all Motown and Stax classics. Soul music is where a lot of the \"Soul\" comes from; the rest is from the quirky decor and the buzzing of conversation from families out to dinner or couples before/after a play. The whole place has old theatre posters and sepia photographs, not because it's \"cool,\" but because Mert's is a beloved part of Charlotte.

The environment is casual and affordable, a bit jazzy, and very Southern. I felt like I was in a grandmother's kitchen, full of history and down home hospitality.\n\nMy run down of this epic meal can't do the flavors justice. \n\nThe cornbread was the best I've ever had, no competition. It was thick, warm, not crumbly, very sweet. It was a meal in itself. \n\nThe green beans were prepared in such a way that leads me to believe this is not a choice for the health minded. They were juicy, wonderfully greasy, and contained spots of other wonderful veggies and greens.\n\nThe candied yams were a treat. Each bite melts in your mouth as the flavors build in your mouth. A tad of cinnamon, a tad of syrup, a lot of velvety sweet potatoey love. My husband told me that these were the best thing he's ever eaten in his life.\n\nFinally, the fried chicken breast was something of legend. The exterior texture was addicting but not salty or typical in anyway. The poultry itself had a ton if depth in terms of flavor, and tasted as if each inch of it was personally marinated somehow with a hint of smokiness, rotisserie, sweetness, peppery... Just a bit of everything. There isn't a fried chicken that can come close to Mert's as far as I'm concerned. \n\nIf you are in the Charlotte area, Mert's is a must.

Merts popped up on my radar after looking for a lunch spot open on a Sunday. Given that yelp only rated this place as a 3.5 stars, I was hesitant on going, but I really wanted to venture out and fill my stomach with Southern cuisine.\n\nI purposely went early to avoid the lunchtime crowds and there was more than enough seats available. I debated between the fried chicken and shrimp dishes the night prior and settled on the shrimp Creole since there were mixed ratings on the chicken. However, when I told nut waitress that I have never tried grits before, she highly suggested that I try their shrimp and grits. And with that, my order for shrimp and grits went through. My waitress appeared within minutes with their famous cornbread. I am not really a fan of the dry, crumbly texture of cornbread on general, but this cornbread was moist and bursting of flavor. I now knew what was so great about their cornbread.\n\nAfter several minutes, my order of shrimp and grits arrived. I wasnt expecting much given that grits do not have the greatest reputation--I heard they are bland, mealy, and literally gritty in texture. With a spoonful of brown gravy, shrimp, tomatoes, onions, and grits, I had a taste. This was Southern comfort food at its finest--the type that transports you to another era...back to the kitchen you grew up in. Granted, I'm not from the South but I could tell that this dish was made with soul. The buttery, creamy grits with the flavorful gravy and crunch of the onions. The shrimp were large and plump and well paired with the gravy. The focaccia bread was also great in soaking up the gravy.\n\nFor allb those looking for comfort food, try the shrimp and grits.

I don't know if it should look like that on purpose.\n\nPrice is around $8 and up and they do have combos.\n\nPersonally, I didn't think this place was that special.

Truly unfortunate, but I would rather not risk spending $30+ to have uncooked food or feel as though we do not even exist in a restaurant that should be serving us, taking our orders, refilling our drinks without us wondering around to find someone to do so :( Really hoping for the best and that the management there straightens up and get this place in shape again.", "business_id": "mpDxBBGywUE6GRRKja3sBA", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-10-19", "type": "review"}

Made a special trip downtown to eat here after picking up a friend from the airport before heading out on the road.  First of all, this location is downtown- very limited parking- so be prepared to pay to park unless you get lucky and get an actual available street spot- very unlikely though.  We found parking in a garage and had to pay $8....umm, not cool!  Upon arriving at the restaurant- it was very slow- but it was around 3 pm.  The ambiance was good and our server was polite and semi-attentive.  \nThe cornbread is great; yet they are pretty stingy with the butter....so be prepared to request more or use sparingly especially if sharing.  I ordered the fried catfish along with yams & Mac n' cheese.  The catfish tasted really muddy/dirty - such a disappointment because it had a great batter on it- but I had to drown it in their unimpressive  and tasteless tartar sauce and some siracha ketchup just to drown out the dirt taste.....the yams were so-so and the Mac n' cheese wasn't very memorable.  The other person in my party ordered the vegetable plate....again yams, Mac n' cheese, and potato salad....her comments matched mine in the similar dishes and as for the potato salad- her comments were that it was just ok.   She got a garden Salad and it was the smallest-saddest little garden salad.  I suppose that maybe since this restaurant was featured in triple \"D\" - then we had high expectations....just wasn't blown away by our meal and there was nothing to crave to make me want to come back.

We stayed longer because of it. I ordered the chicken wings with cabbage and collards. It also came with cornbread; one of my favorite. The cabbage was a hit at the table. I liked the collards even though they did not taste like mine. That had a hint of vinegar and they were topped with chopped onions and tomatoes. They we slightly al dente but that was fine too since they had a good flavor. The meal came with three large whole wings that were seasoned and fried to perfection. Now for the cornbread. I happen to be an expert at this and I know each person has their preference. It was a mini loaf and slightly over cooked. The top should be light brown with no Blackmon the edges. It was more dense than cakey which is okay for me but it lacked flavor. Slightly sweet which is okay too. My issue was that it did not come hot. They whipped butter just sat on it when I cut it open.

LBD status to the max.\n\nMy father, cousin, bro in law, grandfather, and uncle all decided to come down for a weekend for some bball, football, & brews brew. I researched some places to take them to dinner. I'm tired of the traditional places here in Uptown (Blue, Cap Grille, etc), so I decided to try something new. Working at BofA and living on 7th, I rarely have the opportunity to venture down Tryon. This has opened my eyes to a whole new world, just like Aladdin.\n\nNot taking any chances, I made reservations for the 6 of us. For 7 pm, I really don't feel this would have been necessary, as the place was practically completely empty. Let me give you the run down of everything we ate. Please don't judge me. I know I'm a gavone :)\n___________________________________________________\nAppetizers\n\nLobster Mac & Cheese: Thought this was the worst of what we ate. Still, would order it again. Has a completely different texture of your traditional mac & cheese. \n\nCornbread: Comes out in a hot skillet with melted pecan butter on top. Do I need to say anything more about this?\n\nPei Mussels: WOW. The flavor of these mussels will stay with me for the rest of my life. The way they not only smelled, but tasted :)\n\nShrimp & Grits: A teacher of mine used to say: \"So good, it'll make you want to slap yo mama.\" Yeah, that applies here.\n\nPork Belly Sliders: This could have been my meal and I'd be completely happy. I NEED THESE AGAIN!\n\nStuffed Hushpuppies: Halved-hushpuppies, stuffed with crawfished and rock shrimp. This was the complete showstopper. It was spicy, but tasted so damn good.\n\nSome Special Bean Soup: I honestly don't remember the name of it, but it made me all warm and tingly inside. It was in like a beef broth with veggies, beens, and chunks of ham. Splendid\n____________________________________________________\nDinner (yeah, we had room for this too)\n\n\"Old World\" Duck: This was the biggest piece of duck I have ever seen. It was cooked to complete perfection and had the perfect complimentary side of butternut squash. \n\nHickory Beef Tenderloin: A hunk of beef, thrown onto a plate with phenomenal ( and i mean PHENOMENAL) risotto. I devoured this thing faster than you can read this off the menu.\n\n\"Duroc\" Pork Chop: Although I did not have the pleasure of enjoying this, my cuz pounded it (not pounded out). It's a traditional pork chop, but with fresh homemade apple sauce along the side of it. He did not finish at the table, but instead finished while sitting in his underwear on my couch at midnight.\n\n\n\nSo I decided to give this place 5 stars. But if you have read my reviews before, stars don't mean anything. It's all about the LBD scale, and let me tell you, this gets a 9.5 on the LBD scale. If I gave such raving reviews regarding the food, why a 9.5 you ask? BECAUSE I didn't get to try their desert. I'd be lying if I gave it a perfect 10 (like Scarlett Johannson) and it has a terrible desert.

The food can be hit or miss at times, but the staples of crispy bacon, fried eggs and fresh mimosa never cease to amaze! Sunday brunches showcase some of this place's creativity because certain menu items (the specials, quiches and desserts) constantly change with the week and season.

They have a great corporate menu that lets you have a $20 (tax included) dinner that comes with entree, salad and two sides. Your choice is grilled chicken, steak, or salmon with sides of fries, mashed potatoes, green beans, or spinach (can't remember the rest). I will admit, for the most part the taste is rich and delicious, but their execution is so inconsistent. Occasionally the salmon is undercooked, or the chicken charred on one side, or the mashed potatoes liquidy. And once I recieved my food 50 minutes after ordering... but more often than not, I am pleased with the efficiency and quality that I'm paying for. \n\nI would say this is a pretty sweet spot for brunch and a convenient place to grab dinner, but don't always expect it to be \"like last time.\"\n\n4/5", "business_id": "NTfUFk8GyOLL1uPbEO-pVg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-11-15", "type": "review"}

I made a reservation with Mimosa for my family's Thanksgiving meal in 2012.  I called a month in advance and inquired about the menu.  I was explained all the menu choices that would be available and with Mimosa Grill's reputation, decided to go forward with it.  When we arrived on Thanksgiving Day, the restaurant did not have a menu - it was a buffet.  Never was this mentioned during our 15 minute phone call when I made the reservation.  A lot of people do not like buffets - so this should be made clear!  Secondly, the chef had sizzling salmon on the buffet.  This caused the restaurant to REEK of salmon and therefore every bite of food I took tasted like salmon (which I don't particularly like).  The rest of the food was overly heavy and greasy.  But, hey, at least I didn't gain weight over the holiday.  \n\nI believe when a restaurant serves a holiday meal, there is a special trust they must have with their customers.  We choose to trust the restaurant with our most treasured memories. Also, holidays are so booked, we can't leave and go to another restaurant!  Mimosa Grill blew it (although I am pretty sure we will look back at this and laugh).  We did call Zink's (where we ate last year and owned by the same company) to see if they could fit us in.  Unfortunately, Zink's had also chosen to go with a buffet this year (unlike last year)  and didn't have any tables available.

Excellent Mac n cheese and really good selection of fruits, cheeses and cooked vegis - nice thick not over cook breakfast sausages. Good rare roast beef.

Last year, I would give it a solid 4 stars (but this year it's more like a 3.5). Here's why:\n\nThe food was pretty standard for a thanksgiving buffet. They had all the fixings that you would find (stuffing, green bean casserole, squash casserole, sweet potato, and turkey). There was only 2 carving stations (ham and prime rib). The prime rib was INSANELY salty, tasted as if the beef was cured (or the chef forgot how much salt he put in it). The highlight of the buffet would be the giant turkey legs, side dishes, and the raw bar. I love raw food and there was an array of cocktail shrimps, oysters, and smoked salmon where I was able to munch to my delight. \n\nHere's the TLDR:\nPros:\nCasseroles: it's pretty hard to mess up casseroles but I have to say it was pretty delicious\nRaw bar/cheese and meat station: the appetizer courses were honestly my favorite. \n\nCons:\nCarving station: only 2 and the meats were not that great\nDessert: the dessert was all pre-bought and you could blatantly tell. For a thanksgiving brunch, I would want it to be homemade.\n\nFor $40 bucks a person before tax, I do not think this was worth it. But the reason I give this a 4 star instead of a 3 was because of the service. I'm going to be honest with you and my family is filled with looney bins and we ask for some silly requests (warming up cookies and a glass of milk). The server answered all of our requests without hesitating and that basically made our meal. Would we come back again for thanksgiving? Maybe. But we'll keep our options open for next year.", "business_id": "NTfUFk8GyOLL1uPbEO-pVg", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-11-26", "type": "review"}

The lobster was nothing special either, lacking the slight sweetness and delicacy that it should have.

Mainly egg sandwiches served on any number of breads and with any number of regular meats, you can't beat the prices here once you are within the \"uptown grid.\"  Under $3 is a little insane, and so post-workout, I like my odds at Arthurs.\n\nIn the morning there is never a wait and the staff looks a little surprised someone stopped in before 8:30 a.m.  But regardless, the stock English muffins toasted perfectly with a little egg to order.

One note, this Ristorante follows the same menu structure as in Italy.  Everything is ala carte.  So if you order antipasto or insalata, an entree, and dolce you can rack up a big bill.  But, nothing on the lunch menu was over $14, so you can have reasonably priced lunch as well.

Nevertheless, it would seem that this small restaurant tucked away by the Bank of America building, certainly lives up to expectations. \n\nThe diner is spoiled for choice by the authentic menu items, though the choices are not overwhelming. Dishes are described in only three or four words which allude to traditional Italian ingredients and preparation. Then again \"potato gnocchi, tomato porcini mushroom sauce and parmigiano\" already sounds delicious.\n\nThough we waited awhile to be seated, we were handsomely rewarded with free champagne, which kicked things off nicely. The grilled octopus or \"polipo\" was outstanding. Lightly chewy and savory with a nice grilled flavor. The scallops must have been sourced from another planet because they were each the size of small dinner plates. Perfectly browned coat with soft white flesh in the center. Veal Milanese was also quite good, though possibly a little tough. Awesome arugula + parmesan + balsamic garnish. For dessert we had the Semi-Freddo with almond nougat caramel sauce. Great finish.\n\nI would definitely come back here again. My mind wasn't blown, but the food was pretty good and the restaurant's atmosphere felt a little more traditional than those of its contemporary Italian counterparts in the US. In uptown, this will be the closest you get to real gourmet Italian food that resembles anything like its motherland so let's make the most of it!!\n\n4/5", "business_id": "z24h6ZYnZiWjlDTuLXG9jw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-10-14", "type": "review"}

I thought that Luce had taken over the old Coco Osteria space along Tryon St so when we arrived and it said Malabar, we were confused.  I quickly pulled out my phone to check the address.  The addresses matched.  Knowing that there is a courtyard right there, we decided to explore a bit further back.  That's when we noticed Luce tucked way back in the left corner right next to the Hearst Tower.  It's certainly not the most visible location for a restaurant.  \n\nWe booked a reservation on OpenTable.com and when we looked inside the windows and saw the crystal chandeliers and other decor, we had our doubts.  We thought maybe it was skewed to a much older crowd than us and we didn't want a \"stuffy\" experience, only a great meal.  After debating, we finally decided to go ahead with the reservation.  I'm so glad we did.  \n\nOur table wasn't quite ready yet when we checked in, but we were led to the bar area to sit and wait.  We were promptly greeted by the bartender at our high-top table and he offered us drinks.  I tried a red wine from Sicily I had never heard of before.  It was an excellent choice.  It wasn't too dry or bitter.  It was just right and I really enjoyed the BIG glassful that the bartender poured.  We sat and enjoyed our wines until our table was ready.  \n\nWe were seated and promptly greeted by our server, Fabio.  Everyone with whom we came into contact was very friendly and seemed authentically Italian, as if English wasn't their first language at all.  \n\nAll of the appetizer options sounded delicious, but we ventured with the imported italian FORMAGGI (cheeses) with marinated olives.  We ordered the larger version of the appetizer (they have small and large versions for about half of the items -- appetizers and entrees -- on their menu).  We received a cupful of green olives and four triangle slices each of five different cheeses, along with some crisp bread slices.  It was definitely more than enough for two to share.  The harder cheeses had more flavor than the softer ones.   We were also brought fresh slices of bread and a bowl of a whole cannellini beans mixed with olive oil and other flavorful ingredients complimentary for each table.  It was so simple, yet so delicious.  \n\nNext came the entrees.  I didn't want anything with red sauce, so I opted for something new:  AGNOLOTTI.  Agnolotti apparently is \"ravioli.\"  In each ravioli was roasted veal and swiss chard, and then covered in a brown \"butter, sage, and jus de veau sauce.\"   It was freakin' AMAZING.  And that wasn't just the effect of the delicious red wine.  My partner tried the Spaghetti Carbonara, which was very rich and creamy, covered in a white sauce.  \n\nUnfortunately, after all that bread, beans, cheese, and pasta, we did not have room for dessert.  The cannolis were very tempting, though.  For a final good, lasting impression, our server brought us complimentary shots of deliciously sweet limoncello.  \n\nUpon leaving, we were thanked and told goodbye by several of the waitstaff, as if we were family.  It was a fantastic, authentically Italian experience, and I look forward to returning soon!  \n\np.s. When our reservation was confirmed on OpenTable, it said that if you park in the Hearst Tower parking garage, you get two free hours of parking with a validated ticket from Luce during lunchtime hours, or \"free\" with validated ticket on evenings and weekends.  We took this to mean that you could park for more than two hours for free, but when we got our validated ticket, it was marked as \"two hours.\"  Unsure with the conflicting information, we left and found free parking elsewhere to walk around Uptown.  So...I really don't know what the correct parking situation is there.  But at least two hours is free!", "business_id": "z24h6ZYnZiWjlDTuLXG9jw", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-10-29", "type": "review"}

We arrived at about 6PM without a reservation and were seated immediately.  The staff had no objection to our sitting for half an hour eating olives and sharing a single cocktail to pass some time before we ordered our main meal.\n\nAs many other reviewers have mentioned, the olives are excellent.  So was the negroni.  The ambiance was authentically Italian (and we have been to Italy before): intimate, quiet, and comfortable.  A lot of this is due to the wait staff, who are all at least ethnically Italian, and in some cases rather adorably fresh-off-the-boat.\n\nWhen we finally got around to ordering dinner off of their fall menu, we settled upon a meal with one main course and contorni to share.  My fianc\u00e9e had (A) the spinach papardelle with oxtail rag\u00f9 and I had (B) the risotto ai frutti di mare (a daily special).  To share, (1) cannellini beans with escarole and (2) spinach fried with garlic.  Upon the waitress's recommendation we also ordered one glass of Sangiovese to accompany the entire meal.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9e is allergic to most dairy, and when she asked whether the rag\u00f9 had any milk in it, the staff's immediate answer was \"Not that one,\" which really is the most reassuring answer that one can possibly get.\n\nThe food was, on the whole, marvelous:\n\n(0) The first thing to arrive after we'd ordered was a cold cannellini bean salad with peppers, onions, and basil, served with bread.  Every table got this.  It made a great opener.\n\n(A) The pasta was house-made.  Good, though we have had better - but that was in Italy.  The rag\u00f9 was excellent, with the flavors of tomato, oxtail, wine, and carrot in good balance, and an amazing mouth feel.\n\n(B) My seafood risotto had clams, scallops, calamari, shrimp, and mussels.  The key to seafood is freshness, and what went into my dish was certainly very fresh, with no off-flavors whatsoever.  For my part, I could also taste that they used very high quality cream.  The rice, unfortunately, was a bit grainy.  My guess is that they had one pot of it cooking continuously throughout the night, and that since we arrived early in the night, the risotto actually wasn't quite done.  Nevertheless, the flavors were so good and well-melded that I hardly minded.\n\n(1) The cannellini with escarole was perhaps the one disappointment of the night.  The escarole was blanched first, so it lost its signature bitterness, which we both expected it to contribute to this dish.\n\n(2) The spinach with garlic was 'a good straight line' as the two of us put it.  Is there a cuisine in the world which -doesn't- like spinach stir-fried with garlic?\n\nWe finished with coffee; our waiter commented upon our ordering coffee instead of desserts, \"yeah, that's how we do it in Italy.\"  I had black and she had espresso.  The espresso was very well made, and my coffee definitely benefited from (again) the very good cream.\n\nOur whole meal ran us $85 including tax before tip, and included two drinks, two main courses, two side dishes, and two coffees.  We weren't billed for the tiny plates of olives we had during cocktails, so we left extra tip to match the staff's generosity.\n\nLuce is the most authentic Italian dining experience we have had in the United States.", "business_id": "z24h6ZYnZiWjlDTuLXG9jw", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-11-07", "type": "review"}

We only raved about one cheese. All of the hard salami choices were good, but it is hard to mess-up that. \n\nThen came the worst main courses ever!  We ordered the pasta because we had heard such great reviews. I had the gnocchi and my friend had the ravioli. The pasta itself was good, but the sauce ruined everything. We can only describe the sauce as a thin tasteless substance with a hint of the flavor that comes out of a can of Chef Boyardee. I only ate bit of this gruel. We called for the check.

Our server was professional and made recommendations when we asked about the wine. They had a long list & we were both very happy with our choosing. \n\nWe ordered the large cheese & olive plate as a starter & should have only chose the small. It was more than enough for us & very delicious. They also brought out warm soft bread with white beans in a garlic oil. I loved it, but my husband who hates onions wasn't a fan. He kept getting that flavor. \n\nChoosing our main course was difficult because it all sounded amazing. I went with the Mare pasta that was loaded with seafood, served over linguine and a red sauce. The seafood was overflowing on my plate. Lobster, shrimp, mussels, & calamari. So good.  My dish would have been perfect had the sauce not been so incredibly salty. After I ate most of the seafood it was hard to eat the pasta. It almost burned my tongue it was so salty. My husband chose one of the specials of the evening which was super tender steak over a creamy red pasta sauce.

Actual GF beer. I ordered the wood roasted vegetable pizza and it was quite yummy. Huge portion, I actually shared it with my non GF friend who only ordered a salad. They also cooked it in it's own pan, I'm guessing to help avoid contamination. \n\nI was a bit of a problem child. I asked our server for the gluten free menu and then ordered a pizza but I think I forgot to specify that I wanted it gluten free. Totally my mistake, I always try to be 100% clear when ordering and specifying the gluten free option when there is one. So I received a pizza that looked very similar to one of my other friends, and I asked. It was not gluten free. Our server Chad was very nice about it, took it away and got a new pizza started. The manager then brought me a side salad so I wouldn't feel \"left out\" while my friends ate. I made sure to tell him that it was not the servers fault (I was afraid he'd get in trouble!) and that I would gladly pay for the non GF pizza.

The Hilton Garden Inn Charlotte Uptown was booked for me, not by me, with all good intentions.\n\nAs a business traveler, I often get in late and must be up and out quite early, often as early as 5am.\n\nLocation is adjacent to major sports venue. Strike one. Urban center, so there is apt to be street noise that can permeate the rooms, and there was quite a bit of this - emergency vehicle sirens, loud auto sounds.  Strike two. The hotel is not well insulated from outside sounds.  The room doors and the rooms themselves are not designed to contain noise so it does not effect others.  I could easily hear even not loud conversations in adjacent rooms on both sides as well as guests speaking not too loudly in the halls, even after 1am.  I got precious few hours sleep that night!.  Strike three, and they're OUT was the obtrusively loud plumbing sounds.  When adjacent rooms used their facilities, whether it was the toilet, sink or shower/bath, I do not know.  I just know that it created a roaring sound in MY room.\n\nWhen I mentioned this to the desk person the next morning, she acknowledged each of my stated concerns, indicating that this is just the way it is at this property.\n\nIn addition, for anyone in need of ready and waiting cabs, this is another negative for this property.  I requested a cab pick-up for 5:50am, and was assured one would be there and waiting.  As you may have guessed, this did not happen.  Despite their best effort, no cab was there.  About 10 minutes later, one arrived, but it is somehow unsettling when one is on a tight schedule and relies on punctuality.  Of course, I built in some fudge factor so I did not go nuts, but if you need reliance on either waiting cabs at-the-ready or reliable pre-arranged on-call cabs, you might be sorely disappointed in what this hotel can assure.\n\nOn the plus side, their FREE Internet in the room was quite fast, measured at about 9Mbps down and up.

I walked up to the counter to purchase a pack of cigarettes, for which I had a coupon. I waited at the counter for at least five minutes, while the clerk, who had obviously acknowledged my prescence, continued stocking with seemingly no intent on interrupting his task to help me.

My partner and I, who were holding hands, were given a very judgemental, mean look from the clerk as he walked up. Before I asked after my cigarettes, another patron walked in, and lined up behind us. I showed him my coupon, and asked him if he accepted them. Before he even could answer, he took his hand, and physically pushed my partner and I out of the line and waved the man behind us, who was white, clean-cut, in a suit, and obviously heterosexual, up to the front of the line. I stood there, absolutely bewildered at this, not even knowing what to say. He told the man, \"Since these TWO,\" pointing at us and sneering at our interwoven hands, obviously disgusted, \"have no idea what they are doing, and are wasting time, you can go ahead of them.\" At this point, I was absolutely furious, and so completely insulted, that we just stormed out of the store without even commenting.\n\nI have never been so obviously, and literally pushed aside due to a store clerk's homophobia.

I called and made reservations, they were very nice and completely accommodating over the phone.  We arrive on time for our reservations and we are greeted by the hostess who is the first to tell my girlfriend Happy Birthday, everyone inn the restaurant from the servers to the bus boys said hello to us and wished my girl a happy birthday.  When we arrived at the table it was covered in a very classy looking glitter and decorations specifically yfor the occasion.  They made us feel like movie stars, and she thought I was amazing because I had set all this up, but really it was all Capital Grille. So right away the service has set the scene for us to have an excellent night.\n\nThen came the food, we started with a round of gin and tonics, good, and a crab cake appetizer which was amazing, chunks of perfectly seasoned crab meat, and just enough to wet our appetites for the main course.  She ordered the fillet Mignon, and I got the porterhouse.  It was spectacular.  The meat is aged in a glassed in room, which you can see when you first walk in, and tastes incredibly rich, with many layers of flavor, from the smoked grilled aspect to the texture of the aged beef, ummm, I even took the bone home and gnawed on it the next day, it was that good.  The mashed potatoes were really good too.\n\nCapital grille is perfect for special occasions, a little pricey, but when you're celebrating, this is the place to go all out.", "business_id": "CChwRoYVXA3QZulS8a6xOQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2007-09-30", "type": "review"}

I'll have to try that more often. The sales rep from a film production supply house smoothly lied and said Channel 70 Productions was his favorite customers (I am a real pain because I demand perfect service and a high level of competence from my vendors) and offered to buy dinner and I accepted since his offer included the Capital Grille.\nRight away I noticed people actually dressed for dinner. I like that and it gave me a chance to wear the Countess Mara tie my wife had given me the previous week. Yeah, I know it's name dropping, but both my wife and the tie deserve the credit. I'm one of the few men on the planet who enjoys receiving ties as gifts. The tables were too close together for my liking and it was easy to overhear the conversations of others. Perhaps they were just talking loudly.\n I ordered the Delmonico with no seasonings. I always order steaks minus seasoning. If a steak needs that kind of help, then the steak isn't much to begin with. The steak was great. One of the best steaks I've had in awhile.

They know this so I get a call every year inviting me back and who am I to say no?  From the minute you walk into the restaurant to the time you leave it's like they put these rose colored glasses on you and all you see is the awesome atmosphere, service, and food.\nWe received 2 complimentary glasses of champagne, and prosciutto wrapped arracini to start us off.  Lobster & Crab Cakes for sweetie and a tomato mozzarella salad for me.  The tomatoes were cut thick and were complimented by sweet cherry tomatoes and a 12 year aged balsamic.  All very well done.  I admit that I did make a mistake.  I wanted to save room for dessert, so I usually order the porcini rubbed delmonico, but I figured a bone in steak was a bit much.  I ordered the 10 Oz Fillet instead and it was served with 2 large shrimp stuffed with lump crabmeat.  The fillet was cooked nicely and the shrimp were prepared to my satisfaction, I just prefer a ribeye, so looking back I should order what I like and have the mindset to take home what I can't finish.  Now, onto the side dishes...the Lobster Mac N Cheese is like heaven on a plate, I don't know or do I particularly care how much butter they add to it, but it is nothing short of spectacular.  Creamed Spinach is also awesome.  Cheesecake for dessert was like it came out of a magazine.  I think someone told me that their Head Chef was a pastry chef in his past life which leads me to believe that their cheesecake at this location is better than most.\nThe service at the Capital Grille is top notch.

However more modern interpretations like Houston's/Hillstone or J.Alexander's score higher and feel better. \n\nThe service was knowledgeable, but rushed, and not attentive.Not bad in any way but not what I would expect from a place that seems so polished, pretentious and more importantly so expensive. Lets just say I have had much better service for half the price... ( recently Acme in Chapel Hill but I have yet to get to that review)\n\nFood ... OK $40 an entree  ala carte, $10 sides, those are NYC, LA, SF  prices. I expect it to be of comparable quality...... Sadly it was not.  \n\nThe menu list \"daily seafood feature\", when I asked it was, I was told filet(beef) medallions with scallops .... sorry Chef .... that may feature seafood, but it is not a \"seafood feature\" !  \n\nBetween the 2 of us we had - \n\nCedar Plank salmon, slightly over cooked, vastly under seasoned ( my better half rarely salts anything she did this)\n\nBone in NY ordered mid-rare, received very much on the rare side, slightly cold, flavor was good, but undercooked and served with a slightly roasted shallot that was still crunchy (not cooked enough), not the sweet, soft, unctuousness that it could have been.\n\nPotato gratin ( $10) needed an extra 15 min. in the oven, the potatoes were not cooked through... and there was a very very strong raw garlic flavor, AND there was plastic wrap inside ! .. In fairness I understand this happens occasionally and it and the dessert were comped, however I see a trend of sloppiness with the food that should not be happening at this price point.\n\nGrilled Asparagus ($10) it was ok ... but just ok. \n\nDessert creme brule, ......nothing special...  thin  not very crisp carmel, made worse by too many wet berries, and a strawberry fan garnish which even in the darkly lit dining room (as opposed to the kitchen) I could see was past its prime.\n\nit was a $50 dinner for more than $150, so I think that \n\n\"Meh.

My oh my is it amazing. From the bar, to the table and everything in between... absolutely top notch.\n\nDrinks: My knees go weak for an amazing filthy martini. They make it just the way I like it. Bonus: they bring the shaker out to the table and pour it in front of you. Double bonus: blue cheese stuffed olives. I also recommend their signature drink the Stoli Doli martini. Great cocktail. But beware: it's so good you may forget about the fact that it is pure booze. For the wine lovers, the selection is overwhelming... which is a good thing.\n\nFood: the pan fried calamari is CG's signature app. My problem here though is that I can not partake in appetizers or else I stuff myself full before the main course arrives. Last night I went with French Onion Soup, split a house salad with my friend and the Sliced Filet Mignon with Cipollini Onions and Wild Mushrooms. We also got the lobster mac n cheese and grilled asparagus. It was all pretty amazing. I may or may not be still thinking about that mac n cheese. Wow, that's a must get side item there.\n\nDessert: I was already full at this point... like throw-a-white-flag-in-the-air kind of full.

Let me first state that I was  dining solo and was wearing a baseball hat, jeans and cowboy boots. When I entered, the hostess asked me if I preferred sitting in the bar area.  Given what I was wearing and since I was alone, that made perfect sense to me.  I sat at the bar and Richard was my waiter.  I had an absolutely different experience with Richard than was described in a recent post.  He...and the food...made my visit memorable.\n\nLet me first say that Richard had to have been one of the most professional, yet congenial, waiters/servers that I have encountered in a long time.  He had the perfect mixture of banter with me---while waiting for food--- while allowing me to have quality time with my food when it came.\n\nI do not like onions and indicated that to Richard. He then said that he was going to change some of the bread with my meal as it contained onions.  Nice touch!  A few minutes later someone from the kitchen came over and asked me if I was allergic to onions (which I am not).  I make it a habit to let servers know of my distaste for onions, when appropriate.  Never have I been asked before if I were allergic to onions.  I truly appreciate the C.G. staff for going out of their way to cater to me like they did.\n\nRichard also steered me well with food choices.  On my own, I NEVER would have thought of ordering mashed potatoes at a restaurant of the caliber of C.G.  Richard suggested that I have that as a side.  I agreed and am so glad I did.  The best word to describe them was \"sublime.\"  My main dish, salmon, was equally superb.  My only disappointment in the whole meal was that I had two beers which helped fill me up.  Alas, there was no room for dessert.\n\nAre C.G.'s price ridiculously high?  Absolutely!\n\nIs the food at C.G. ridiculously good? Absolutely!\n\nDid Richard help make my visit spectacular?

We were not loud but pretty chatty and never felt rushed or uncomfortable. The vibe was bustling but relaxed for the guests. Only one person had dessert, everyone else were too full.

And it cost $24 with tip, but well worth it!\n\nMy lunch buddy got their cheeseburger, and that also was DELICIOUS! It had to be at least 10oz, bigger than most, and completely covered in cheese.\n\nSo if you want to splurge on a great lunch, this is THE place to come! Just bring a high limit credit card!

Our waiter was \"Ok\". Nothing special. He was semi-attentive but as we were having our first sips of our after dinner drinks he brought us the check. Really? Do you want us to leave or do you want us to sit and spend some more money.?

The customer service in general is not great and I've heard several people say this. \n\nAs Anish said, the bar is good for happy hour after work because you can literally drink and eat for super cheap.

We went to this Stool Pigeons on Church to watch Sunday football and were told that Mich Ultra and Bud Light were on special for $2.25. We're not picky beer drinkers, we would have enjoyed the Bud Lights just as much as the Ultras, we just wanted the cheapest beer because we were drinking a lot. So we start to order buckets after buckets of beer. It started out with 3 Bud Lights and 2 Mich Ultras and then the last bucket somehow ended up being all Mich Ultras. Well of course, when we get the bill, we find out why the waitress was bringing us so many Mich Ultras in comparison to Bud Lights. Mich Ultras were $3.75 a PIECE (not on special like she told us), which is absolutely insanely overpriced for a domestic beer anyway and the Bud Lights were $2.25. She was trying to get the bill higher for a bigger tip by lying and telling us that something was on special and it wasn't. I'm a waitress, I know how this stuff works (although I'm at least an honest up-seller, not a deceitful one.) The bill was over $100 for 25 beers, Nachos (which were not actually nachos, they were cheap veggies thrown on top of about 7 tortilla chips with tater tots underneath. Yes, tater tots. What is that?!), and wings. \n\nShe tried to argue with us about the prices and what she did or did not say, something about the special not counting towards the buckets? Who knows what the hell she was talking about, the girl obviously needed to get her info straight. So we of course ask for the manager who comes over to tell us that we drank them and we had to pay the $3.75 a pop. We were pissed needless to say. The manager actually ROLLED HIS EYES-SEVERAL times and was YELLING at us. I was stunned. He actually yelled at us. Funny thing is, I'm a business major, currently in school and we are learning (even though, common sense) that customer satisfaction is key. Had the manager given us the lower price, they wouldn't have even lost anything because we all know that a Mich Ultra in the store is barely more than $1, so they are still profiting from us. We would have been HAPPY customers, willing to come back since this is a regular Sunday occurrence. But now, we're so ridiculously angry, it was the worse experience at a restaurant EVER. The waitress and the manager were rude and stupid. I guess you can't expect much from sports bars like that anyway. Uneducated morons run the place. \n\nI hope the owner of this restaurant is reading this. Maybe you'll learn something. If a SERVER makes a mistake, you don't make the customer pay for it. Even if the mistake is the customer's, you still don't make them pay for it. It's called good customer service. It's what will keep people coming back. Ever heard \"The customer is always right\" ???? (Even though we were, something like that would have never happened where I work) Now, we will not EVER be back here, nor will we bring any of our 10-15 people Sunday crowd, and we will tell everyone how awful of an experience we had here which will cost you money.  Congratulations, you just screwed yourselves. \n\nPros:\n\nThe wings were good...", "business_id": "t5l-H2KdY4MQgLDMENz9WQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-10-14", "type": "review"}

The staff is always great.\n\nDown Sides: Drinks are fairly pricey and the bar is extremely dark.

Everything from Krispy Kreme donuts to frozen lemonade to hot fresh pizza. This isn't the Bobcats arena, with high-class restaurants, and I would like to see a bit more \"hometown pride\" with some truly Southern-style specialties available, but you can pretty much find something to eat no matter how picky you are, and the prices (for a football stadium) are reasonable. \nAlso, you gotta love that this place is the only place in NC with special permission to sell alcohol early on Sundays. \n\nThe ramps leading to the upper levels can be a bit brutal, but let's be honest, they are spacious and better than stairs. If you truly have an injury or disability that makes the ramps a hardship, they do have elevators you can use to get to the upper levels. \n\nI'm also a big fan of the designated smoking sections. Just because this is an open-dome stadium and not closed off doesn't mean I want people to be able to smoke in the stands. I mean, i bring my kids to these games. \n\nI think this place will start to get more reviews now that they are FINALLY branching out into events other than Panthers games.

One, we had an issue with an unruly, drunken, abusive fan of the opposing team sitting near us during a game. Although numerous people complained (you can conveniently report to stadium security via text message with your cell phone), he was given MULTIPLE warnings and not ejected, even though he was involved in a physical altercation and was spewing curse words and racial slurs within earshot of my 5- and 7-year-old children. At this same game, a friend of mine was ejected for being \"too drunk\" because he merely stumbled while climbing up the stairs to his seat during the fourth quarter, injuring (and bothering) nobody. \nTwo, our seats are just about as far as you can possibly get from the Team Store. Opposite side of the stadium and four levels up. We went to the Team Store to browse after the game, and then they would not let us back into the stadium. I understand that  they don't want people loitering around forever after the game is over, but it was cold and windy outside, and I was with my mother and two small children. It was a long chilly walk back to our car. Just wish we had been informed PRIOR to entering the store that we wouldn't be allowed back out unless it was on the exterior of the stadium- we would've gone prior to the game instead of after!!", "business_id": "g-Q7G5Q2zHb1BqoF8pq-OA", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-11-14", "type": "review"}

We had family from Charlotte and family actually flew in from AZ to attend the game.  Too bad the Giants didn't show up like the fans did.\n\nBy halftime we had had enough, it was our chance to get the lay of the land in the stadium and we found a couple of gems.  One was a Beer stand area called Local Carolina beers which had over 20 local craft beers.  We tried the NC Hefeweizen (wheat beer normally served with citrus fruit), the prices were pretty reasonable, $7.50/$8.50  for a 16 oz which is a lot better than the prices in the NY area.  \n\nNext to the craft beer stand, was a mini sports bar with 6 TVs showing other games being played during that time.\n\nAs other reviews have said parking can be a bit of a pain but we got there early to tailgate and parked about 4 blocks away on Mint Street.\n\nThe people who work in the stadium are all very friendly and really get into entertaining the crowds.  Almost has the feel of a college football game.  I would definitely come back (but not for a Giant game, it was an old fashioned southern a$$ whipping 38-0  OUCH)\n\nWe should have just left after the tailgating. :)", "business_id": "g-Q7G5Q2zHb1BqoF8pq-OA", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-09-23", "type": "review"}

I am a PSL owner and have been so since 2006.  I feel that these improvements to the stadium will help keep it feeling modern for at least another 3-5 years.   \n\nAtmosphere - For the pro-football games played here, the crowd is mixed pretty well between home and visiting fans due to Charlotte's growing population of transplants.  However, this makes a good number of Panther fans less than loyal (me included), which means you can probably get a scalped ticket fairly cheaply on game day.\n\nService - From the person searching you and your belongings before you enter, to the staff pouring your beer, the employees at the stadium always seem to be friendly, even when the Panthers are having a losing season.  \n \nFood - You can get your standard stadium fare of soft pretzels, hotdogs, beer, and pizza (Papa John's ...eh).  The Stadium also has available the local chains of Bojangles' chicken (makes decent chicken fingers and potato wedges...though they can be overly salted) and Qdoba (a Chipotle-esque restaurant).  \n\nWhile they don't sell hard liquor mixed drinks here, the beer selection at the Stadium is great.  It ranges from the InBev brands of Budweiser and Stella Artois to the local brews of Olde Mecklenburg Brewery, Foothills Brewing and Natty Greene's.  I even saw that the Stadium sells wine, though I am not sure of the details.  \n \nOverall - I have always enjoyed myself at games here.  The local fans are friendly and security is quick to act if things get out of hand.  And that's another Panther 1st down...roar, roar!!!\n\nTip:  You can bring two (2) unopened clear bottles of water through security and into the Stadium.  This is something I just learned this year.

Some people walk very far to get to the game so walking back to place a bag in their car isn't all that easy.

I would love to rate them 5 stars based solely on being a fan. \n\nTHAT SAID. \n\nWe have fallen on some hard times. I know there are a lot of Northern transplants into the Carolinas (NC in particular) and a lot of people are still loyal to other teams. However, it is depressing going to games and seeing more people dressed in other jerseys than there are Panthers jerseys! \n\nEvery team has its ups and downs. We have had our fair share of downs, but that is to be expected as one of the youngest (player age AND franchise age) teams in the league. \n\nMy 3 star rating has nothing to do with the team itself. I love my team. However I am a bit embarrassed by the ownership situation. Hearing rumors that they already want a new stadium (ours is only 15 years old and really, what have you done to deserve it?) and adding in the fact that we introduced the whole PSL scam, thereby assuring profits to Jerry R and eliminating any need for him to provide a decent product, is an embarrassment that is only lightly tamped by the fact that other teams have started to follow our (terrible) example and treat their fans just as badly. \n\nAlso, requiring any kid over the age of 12 months to purchase their own ticket? RIDICULOUS. Even 500-level tickets are $60-70. Many 1-year-olds can't even WALK, do you really think they need an entire seat? Their parents are going to end up holding them. I took my son to his first Panthers game when he was 2 months old. At the time the ticket age was 2 years. Now it is 12 months. WTF is that. \nInstead of moving in an anti-fan direction, we should do the opposite. See all those empty seats every week? Why not implement a BOGO instead. For every adult ticket sold, one child aged 8 or under gets in free until the stadium is full. Bragging about a \"91 game consecutive sellout\" streak is a joke when a quarter of the seats are empty at the start of the game. This is the time to build our fan base for the future, and that means starting with the kids, not ripping off a bunch of older PSL owners in the middle of this terrible economic situation.", "business_id": "b0QFCPXbG7k_TBexxs9fCQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-11-14", "type": "review"}

It always makes me feel like it's a real diss to Charlotte. I could understand it with New England playing so far outside Boston, and wanting to draw in the rest of the states in the region. And Boston is so famous already for all of its other teams and things that it doesn't need the Patriot name. But you would be surprised how many people outside Carolina don't even know which city the Panthers play in. \"Charlotte could have an NFL team right?\" said a friend of mine. \"That's a big city isn't it?\"\n\nAnyway, I'm more of a Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill person than a Charlotte person anyway, but more power to the Panthers and good luck to them in all their future ventures.\n\nI just wish they didn't always sound so out of breath.", "business_id": "b0QFCPXbG7k_TBexxs9fCQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-10-19", "type": "review"}

The buzz of the crowd is unyielding.  You get to see all of the action without pesky commercials and you have the backdrop of the city skyline to boot.\n\nThe stadium is pretty much what you'd expect.  Typical food, fanfare, and gear available for purchase.  Get your hotdog, beer, jersey, etc. while in route to the bathroom or back to your seat.  The club level offers a more exclusive lounge area with somewhat shorter concession lines, but don't expect any gourmet pretzels.  Of course the pricing is insane and the selections are limited.

That's great. No frills, no bells and whistles, just an ol' fashioned place to meet friends and grab beers. I love it here. Because of its location in the middle of Uptown, it's a great place to meet after work or before, say, a Bobcats game or concert/event downtown. On most nights, it's pretty mellow here, so it's a great place to chat and drink, or even watch or discuss the game on TV. On weekends, though, and Thursday nights, it gets a lot more crowded--pretty packed, in fact, so it's definitely got a different feel on those nights. Great place to meet singles, as far as I can tell. \n\nThe bar itself has two floors, and the upstairs is usually more rockin' than the downstairs--more people, louder music, etc. There are a million beers on tap, as you'd expect, so you can grab pretty much anything you'd want, and obviously they've got all the liquors down pat, too. \n\nGreat bar.

Beware though, if you have never been, you will be floored at how dark it is! I have a friend who told me the story of when he first moved to Charlotte and stumbled into what he thought was pronounced \"Cannolli's\". He walked in, ran into a table, couldn't see anything and ran back out because he had no idea what he had just walked into. Ha! \n\nBut your eyes will adjust and you will be fine after you grab a Guinnes or a cider. Most of the people that work there are actually from Ireland or another country such as Australia. The experience in a pub is just that much more enjoyable when accents are involved (especially with hot guys). \n\nWhile you're there, take in the music, which is sometimes Irish, sometimes hip hop, and the decor of the room. On the walls you will find all authentic effects from Ireland, such as street signs and sports memorabilia. If you are there on a busier night (which sometimes can be every night) head upstairs if you can. The upstairs is usually open Thursdays through Saturdays, I think. It's much roomier up there and you can always find a few young people dancing up there (again with very little light). \n\nThe crowd normally seems to be mostly young professionals including a lot of after work stop-ins like bankers and lawyers. Sometimes there are a few tourists and foreigners with accents as well (preferably hot).   ;) \n\nTo make the most out of going to Connolly's take it for what it is... you will get drinks very quickly and proably drink A LOT. You can easily meet new friends and sing and dance a little. They don't serve food and even though, it is clean, there's not much else to it. \n\nA HUGE tip for the ladies: if you use the restroom downstairs make sure you lock the door with the large latch lock that slides UP! If you lock the bathroom door with just the measly doorknob lock, SOMEONE WILL WALK IN ON YOU!! I have done this three times in one night to three poor, unsuspecting women who did not know this. Whoops! Sorry 'bout that...\n\nAlso, I almost forgot, they just expanded their patio and it's awesome!! They now have 2 cornhole setups, a ping pong table and outdoor flatscreen TV's, not to mention more patio tables and more standing room. Venture out there; it's a new world! \n\nAaaand lastly, if you do stop by, do me a favor and find the Irsh bartender \"Murph\" and give him a hard time... seriously do it. It will get him all fired up and a good laugh for you and me! ;) He is my favorite bartender in Charlotte but he's still a pain in the arse.", "business_id": "jmzPbvE_02SzTAjwZCTgYA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-10-26", "type": "review"}

I've had much better service in Charlotte on Friday nights.\n\nFood: I had the jumbo stuffed shrimp with buttermilk whipped potatoes and vegetables. Great presentation. The shrimp were stuffed with lump crab and lightly breaded-- and by lightly breaded, I mean just enough to hold the concoction together. You taste the seafood, not the breading. My date had the salmon with penne and cream sauce. The sauce was too thin for my liking, but the salmon was juicy, thick, and not overcooked/over-seasoned.\n\nWould I go back: Absolutely.

Not all of our party was there so we were told we could wait in the building lobby and they would get our table ready soon.  At 7:45 we were still waiting, everyone was there and I had watched them seat several other tables who said they had no reservations.  So, I asked about our table and the hostess rolled her eyes and sighed and said they were still working on it.  When I mentioned that our reservation had been for earlier, she said \"well, everyone else had reservations, too, Ma'am!\" and just walked off.  I promptly labeled her the anit-hostess and another member of our party (of 5) went to find the front house manager.\n\nThe manager seated us but acted like he did us this huge favor.  We were seated in the bar, next to the patio door, so we had the bracing blasts of cold air throughout our meal as staff went in and out this door all night long.\n\nOur waiter was in no hurry to take care of us.  Once we ordered our drinks, he never came back with any more water, and one member of our party had to flag him down each time he wanted another beer.  \n\nOur food finally came and at last, redemption!!  Every single bite was perfection!  I had the filet, my husband had lobster and two others had the snapper.  Everyone oohed and ahhed over our meals.  \n\nPrice point wise I feel we got what we paid for strictly in terms of food and food quality.  The presentation was lovely, temp was good... I really could not find anything to negate the food.\n\nService is a different story.  It was painfully obvious that the wait-staff was stressed by the front manager.

Even though my experience in Discovery Place's theater wasn't as breathtaking, I am glad that we have one in town.\n\nI also recently checked out the Pompeii exhibit, which was a lot of fun.

Good luck finding one!\n\nFood is not that great, cafeteria style. Hamburgers, fried and grilled chicken sandwiches and small size pizzas. Also soups, yogurt, pudding and salad boxes.

At first glance, some of the underwater habitats do seem a bit sparse but the museum published a disclaimer that because they are really starting from scratch, they have to allow time for the heartier species to propagate so that they can introduce more delicate species naturally into a well-established ecosystem.  And that I can appreciate.\nStill as an adult, I was left wanting a bit more.  I would prefer to go to an entire museum that specializes in *JUST* nature or architecture or microbiology because my attention span and interest level is just a little higher.  So come with the kids, but not necessarily on a geeky date.", "business_id": "ZBQWSsUXwixFmm3lpegMiA", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-09-08", "type": "review"}

They had people dress up for the theme and also had a hoverboard for people to play on!

I think it used to have something to do with the train line back in the day.  The layout is great with a huge center bar and lots of booths and tables (Sundays are usually standing room only on game day, so fans come early...like by noon).\n\nService - Usually pretty good.  Occasionally I will get a waitress I do not like, but most are great, even when crowded and w/rowdy fans.\n\nFood - There is a Cajun theme to their menu that has surprisingly pretty good quality.  Not like impress your date good, but a fun place to take someone you already know fairly well.  I usually get their grilled chicken sandwich that comes on a quality roll w/first-rate fries.  Their dirty rice is pretty good too.  Beer prices are reasonable, especially w/specials like $2 bottles.  Dixie's really caters to the Steelers crowd on Sundays, even getting IC Light on occasion.  Down side, they occasionally run out of some hard liquor...how does that happen??\n\nOverall - On a normal weekend night, there are lots of people, no cover and fun familiar music.

My review is based on both my experience in the meeting rooms and an overnight stay in a guest room. \n\nFirst off, the hotel staff down in the  meeting rooms for our events were very helpful and did a good job providing everything we needed for our meetings, including a nice catered lunch.  The bathrooms, ballrooms, and meeting rooms were all clean and well appointed for our event. 4 stars for the meeting space. \n\nHowever, as some of the other reviewers noted, the guest rooms could certainly use some major updating, as this property is older.   As noted in other reviews, the place is a bit on the noisy side and you may need to use the disposable earplugs, which are stocked in the drawers beside the bed. There were quite a few loud drunk people in the hallway and you could certainly hear way too much noise while inside your room. However, if you are just crashing after a night of partying in downtown the noise may not be a huge issue.   What is a little scarier to me is the fact that I noticed a couple of bug-bites on my legs this afternoon.  I didn't notice anything during the night last night, but honestly, I had been drinking before crashing for the evening so it is not surprising that I didn't notice anything at that time.  Now, I did not see any actual bed bugs running around but seeing those bites on my legs today certainly makes me wonder.  Based on those factors,  I am going to say 1 star for the guest room.", "business_id": "QThlnQ7AvzZwXHKD5DjdCw", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-09-27", "type": "review"}

So we went with valet parking.. reluctantly.. because we love our car and don't like strangers touching it. But that's just an \"us\" thing.\nThe concierge was very friendly and helpful. He was very willing to advise us on hot spots for dinner and drinks. He was very polite and professional.\nThe room was impeccably clean and very comfortable.

NO free WiFi. No complimentary breakfast of any type (not really a big deal, but we noticed). The nice 20oz bottle of water in our room, displayed invitingly, was SIX DOLLARS. Well stocked mini-bar but I can't imagine anyone ever paying that much for anything in there unless they were already drunk.

The scents of candles and lotions are incredible, and they were hard to resist with their Fall displays front and center with names like \"Autumn Leaves\" and \"Cinnamon Pumpkin\". Their prices are reasonable and their gift items are very nice. (Sigh)...so here's why I'll never shop here again. \n\nI came in to check out the store and in my browsing around, grabbed a tester for a particular scent and gave it a try. I always like to do this with lotions and perfumes; before I commit to purchasing, I put it on and walk around with it for a few hours to let it soak in since it always smells different than when you first put it on. So I left the store and for the next hour could not stop smelling my hands - it was so good it was intoxicating. I don't even remember which scent it was, but that's not important anyway. An hour and a half later I was back in the store and heading for the counter, bottle in hand. \n\nSo I'm reading the back. I'm trying to be ever so conscious about my purchases, especially beauty products, in that I only buy products that are paraben-free and NOT tested on animals. Call me uptight, but I just don't think animals should be tortured so I can smell like fake juniper. I scan the label and see that it does contain parabens, but it smells so friggin good I make an exception. Then I see it: \"This finished product not tested on animals.\" And for a minute I think, Great! Ready to buy. And then...this...\"finished\" product?  What the heck does that mean? Normally if a product is not tested on animals it will just say \"Not tested on animals\", or \"We NEVER test our products on animals\", or the like. And if it says nothing, you always assume that they do test on animals. But \"This FINISHED product\"? So, the final product that fills the bottle in my hand, the one that I intend to use, has not been tested on any animal. But what about everything before that? And then I just got mad. Very mad. Do they think we are idiots? Some big shot at BBW must believe that their customers are totally mindless, lazy, and can be easily fooled by the wording they chose. I don't know what made me more mad; the fact that they do test on animals, or the fact that they take us all for idiots and try to play like they don't run the tests. Either way, out of principle, I put the bottle back and decided I will never again give a dime of my money to BBW. Excuse the rant, but this just really pissed me off.", "business_id": "Yn4cNkvCw6PhM6KISEGpAg", "stars": 1, "date": "2008-09-11", "type": "review"}

It's right around 20\", with the half grinder around 10\". Also, all of their grinders are over toasted so expect a crispy crust unless you specify otherwise. They have some pretty diverse grinder options to choose from, but you won't be too thrilled if you love to customize (they only have a few options there). \n\nOutside of the grinder realm, their pizzas are pretty good & greasy. Nothing too great though, but not too bad for the price & size. This is their other specialty based on their namesake, but I'd definitely choose grinder over pizza here.

They don't put a lot of effort into theming, landscaping, or guest service at Carowinds, but they do throw some rides your way.  \n\nAs rides go, the rides are okay here at Carowinds, somewhere between a carnival and the theme parks in Orlando.  The old wooden Hurler roller coaster didn't make me want to hurl, but it did make me wish I was wearing a crash helmet.  My head felt like a martini -- shaken and stirred.  Some of the other rides felt like rides I used to go on as a kid; they haven't been updated.  \n\nAs for their food options, they're not great.  We waited awhile for below average theme park fare.  And don't even get me started with the guy who wanted to run off with our credit card to ask his manager something when we wanted to buy a soda.  That was 15 minutes of my life that I'd like back.  \n\nWhat does Carowinds have going for it?  Its proximity to Charlotte and an option for something to do for a day during the summer.  Other than that, save your money and go to Orlando.", "business_id": "n9iK0s1dKxv5JLi3u1eTkQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2008-11-18", "type": "review"}

By the end of the day this place turned crazy!! Sooo many people were there!! We got there by 10 or earlier and walked around in the kids area so my nephews could go on some rides before we headed over to the water park. At this point it was still pretty quite and nice!! \n\nWe went over to the water park area a little before 11 to wait to get in, we walked over and the line was short but getting longer. We had decided we were going to get a cabana over in the Wave Pool area so we can leave our stuff and the kids could go and relax if need be. It was only $54 to rent it out for the day, Perfect!! The Wave Pool was so nice an quiet for a while, but I'm not sure what happened because all of a sudden it was a mad house!!! So crazy how many people were in there! The lifeguards had lost complete control at this point, life jackets were just floating around in the water, kids weren't even using them anymore, someone's hair extension floated by my sister (gross) it became complete chaos!! Thankfully we got there nice and early so the kids could do things like the water slides without much of a wait and even to get on the lazy river we waited a few minutes but nothing like we would have if we were there later in the day!! \n\nWe had grabbed 4 lounge chairs in the front of the wave pool so we could lay out and relax it was a great option to have those or go sit in the Cabana. Again the Cabana would be good if you had an elderly person with you because it has a TV in it so they too could relax instead of having to just sit there!!\n\nThey're is PLENTY of people watching going on and all in all we had a great day we were there for almost 7 hours so we were all tired and let's say some got a little sunburned....me :(", "business_id": "n9iK0s1dKxv5JLi3u1eTkQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-09-07", "type": "review"}

I grew up in SC and went to Carowinds a lot as a kid, and now living in Orlando it's hard to beat the Disney parks, but revisiting this childhood dream brought it all back.\n\nWe bought two-day passes at the gate (it's only an extra $5 to go a second day) for a big group of 3 adults, 2 teens and 3 little kids. Our strategy was to do all the rides on Day 1, and spend Day 2 in the water park. Carowinds has so many rides, everybody in the family got to do what they wanted. The little kid rides (aka \"Snoopy land\" to us) was amazing and had some of my favorite rides, including the spinning pirate ships & the gliders that you pilot on your own.\n\nThe only downside to Carowinds is that the food is expensive inside the park and they have almost no vegetarian options, but no worries - there's a Bojangles just outside of the park. We saw a bunch of families tailgating in the parking lot so we took a break on Day 2 to grab a couple buckets of chicken & side dishes, and had a fun little picnic in the shade in the parking lot. I also recommend the McDonalds outside of the park for a quick cheap meal or ice cream.\n\nMy best advice for kids: MEASURE THEIR HEIGHT ahead of time because the ride operators are very strict about 42 inches vs. 44 inches, etc. and we saw a bunch of little kids cry that they couldn't ride the Rip Roarin' Rapids at the last minute. Also recommend getting the refillable cups - it's a good value if you're there for two days, and they will refill with ice water for free.\n\nHope your family has as much fun at Carowinds as we did!", "business_id": "n9iK0s1dKxv5JLi3u1eTkQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-09-07", "type": "review"}

Not sure if this is because the park resides in two different states.  Which brings me to another point.  One of my friends had bought a bottled drink early in the day and bought another one several hours later, only to find the price went up slightly due to the different taxes in SC & NC.\n\nThe only plus was that we had very limited wait times (the park was not that crowded).

And if you live in Charlotte, then you're nuts not to buy a season pass, and here's why.  If you go just twice, you'll have saved money on your second time in. Plus, with the season pass, you get free parking all summer, so it's worth it for that alone as well.  \n\nAs for the rides, the best by far is the Intimidator, named after Dale Earnhardt, so it's themed accordingly.  It's a good ride at any park, with a steep drop off at the start, and a lot of air time during the ride.  When we go, we usually ride it at least 3-4 times. The line moves really quickly too, so if you see a long line don't be discouraged, it's usually not more than 20 mins to ride.  The other rides are ok, I forget all the names, but the one where you lay on your stomach superman style is cool, but the line takes forever, so it's not really worth it more than once.  The other really good one is the Top Gun ride, but sit in the front row if you can, it's a 1000% times better from there.\n\nAll the other gripes are standard for a theme park, yes, it's stupid expensive for food and snacks, people working there aren't in love with their jobs, shocking since they're a bunch of teenagers working for the summer!

They force you to pay to park to be able to go into the park. This isn't just for premium parking, but its for general too. This is just another way to rake the park goers over the coals.  Having to pay to park, really made me not ever want to come back here.\n\nAs for rides, we focused mainly on Rollercoaster, and wanted to get as many of them as possible. The Eliminator (Nascar theme and biggest in the park) was fun,fast, and rough.  You experience at a lot of G's and airtime on this ride, but my head paid the price and was rattled. Afterburn had to be my favorite of the day, but we experienced a big delay due to someone getting sick on the ride. We finished the night with Nighthawk, and waited inline for about 1.5 hrs.  It was a really fun ride, but not sure if it was worth the \"wait 1 min for 1 seconded of riding\" ratio.\n\nThe rest of the rides were entertaining, no other great recommendations. \n\nThe park was crowded on a the Saturday night, but not painful to move around through the park. Everyone was friendly having a good night out.\n\nSome of the bathrooms were really old and disgusting.  \n\nFood was expensive and not that awesome.

While the rest of the crew enjoyed many of the park's offerings (roller coasters, fro-yo, novelty games), I concentrated on doing laps at the deeper end of  the wave pool (not positive, but I think it went as deep as 12 feet), far from the kiddies.**  (And yes, I tried not to think of how many of them do not bother to leave the pool to look for a restroom...)  I'm so grateful we found a covered table that could accommodate most of us as some went to the lazy river, while others went to swim elsewhere, while I or another stayed and watched over our belongings.  And yes, we also had valuables stashed away at locker rentals nearby.  I STRONGLY suggest going online days beforehand to purchase your tickets, locker rentals, AND cabanas for they will sell out on the day you get there.  Cabanas will run you $60 for six people, and includes six bottles of water and towels to use while at the park.  I tried my hardest to sell the idea to our group, but no takers... I think at the end they wished they'd supported me.  (Forget about locating open loungebeds upon arrival- you won't find any, at least not any you'd like to use.)  Large locker rentals were slightly less expensive than smaller ones, and they rent out fast, and the smaller ones were not very tote-friendly.  (You will also run the risk of not finding enough lockers for your group.) The women's restrooms were puddle-ridden, dirty, and missing toilet paper, with long lines to boot.  I hope the park fixes this problem, stat!\n\nGreat variety of rides and activities to do here.  I think that the exits could be marked better, though.  We all had a hard time finding our way out, but I'm sure this was not an accident!  Kind of like shopping at an IKEA... there's no easy way out, as management wants to keep you from leaving too soon!\n\nOne nice thing about the park is that the themes change from season-to-season, from year-to-year.  Don't forget to check out promo codes online before ordering your tickets!  \n\n** I did try a couple of roller coasters, a mild one, and another that not only looped forwards, but also backwards.  By the time I found out, I didn't want to back out.  I should've, though.  This ride marked the last time I will attempt one, for I had terrible vertigo for the remainder of the afternoon.

Go.\n\nIntimidator replaced my favorite coaster of all time (Millennium Force at Cedar Pointe) and the adrenaline rush afterward made me feel as though I accomplished something big. I have no idea how no one has fallen out riding this - the seating design is revolutionary and freeing and allows completely uninhibited body movement from the waste up. It is the only coaster my husband felt terrified of while riding and he begged to skip this one a second time around. I, for one, felt very secure for some reason and loved the height and speed. It was a serious thrill.\n\nA first for me was the backwards coaster, Cobra. I'd never experienced this kind of design and it was such a blast. The first drop going forward is amazing, and then you reach the midway point and reverse going backward while going upside down multiple times. It was scary, exciting, and unique.\n\nI really liked how the park was designed - no space was wasted. You do not have to walk a quarter mile between fun things to do. The park is huge and hosts a surprising amount of roller coasters, but we did not feel exhausted walking the park itself all day. It was incredibly easy to navigate. Additionally, there were so many cool kid's exhibits and rides that were a big step up from most amusement parks I'm accustomed to.\n\nMy only real gripe is with some of the workers. We spoke with a handful that were just really, really weird. Not creepy... Just a bit off. There was a lot of over sharing involved. The guy that did our caricature portrait also flat out sucked!

Nestled right on the North and South Carolina junction near Charlotte, the amusement park is truly an underrated one. Most theme park enthusiasts have visited or at least heard of Six Flags, Cedar Point, Busch Gardens etc. Yet it seems that the \"Thrill Capital of the Southeast\" is still a little-known gem, despite forty-two years of continuous operation.\n\n Growing up in Columbia, SC (a short hour away), Carowinds was my childhood escape. Columbia being a sleepy little town, you couldn't help but feel stranded and bored in the summer time. While most kids counted down the days until summer break, I dreaded it--there's nothing glamorous about the blistering heatwaves and humidity that transformed the capital city into a desert mirage. Hence, I spent most days indoors, dreaming of waterparks and rollercoasters. After weeks of begging and pleading, my parents would give in and make my dreams come true; we'd pack into our jumbo-sized minivan and start our excursion to paradise.\n\n Even though every experience seems much more vivid and exciting to a child, I recently revisited my childhood muse with my younger brother and was delighted to see the theme park even more lustrous than I could remember. As we pulled into the parking lot, I could hardly contain my excitement seeing all the loopdeloops of new coasters we were anticipating. Having worked in the Hospitality Industry for several years, I've learned that presentation is everything; attention to detail and a polished appearance can make or break an experience. Carowinds has always had a wide variety of thrilling rides, but the shift in ownership from Paramount to Cedar Fair has given the property new life. From the fancy brick inlays and flag masts at the entrance to the state of the art Fury 325 giga coaster (tallest & fastest in the world) to the Boomerang Bay water park expansion project, the park has undoubtedly received a 21st Century facelift.\n\n As far as service is concerned, I have never had a bad experience in all my visits to Carowinds over the years. All the employees I have interacted with have been very professional, courteous, and eager to help. The workers on the rides and the lifeguards in the waterpark were particularly upbeat and very diligent with safety procedures. The park is clean and litter-free, and the upkeep of the public restrooms is exceptional. I am not a big fan of the food and refreshment prices, but no one ever said a trip to an amusement park would be a cheap affair. Even then, Carowinds offers membership in the form of season passes and runs the occasional promotion for cheaper entry.\n\n All in all, I went into my most recent trip to Carowinds with skepticism and lowered-expectations, yet ended up leaving the park with as big of a grin as the kids next to me. The park's growth is pretty consistent with Charlotte's sprawling urban metropolis, which is worth checking out while you're in the area.", "business_id": "n9iK0s1dKxv5JLi3u1eTkQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-09-08", "type": "review"}

Also they won't allow loose articles on Fury which is totally fine, BUT they make you PAY for a locker! I bought a souvenir cup and then had to pay again to put it in a locker to ride Fury! Never have I had these problems at Carowinds until this year! They need to visit other parks and take a few pointers on guest service. Contemplating on whether I'll even go back again. The only reason I give 2 stars is because the coasters are great and I have great memories of visiting here when I was little. I even remember being able to pick where I sat on Intimidator. So sad Carowinds has become such a disappointment. Plus don't even try complaining to guest services. They could care less about your complaints and then tell you some bs excuse.", "business_id": "n9iK0s1dKxv5JLi3u1eTkQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-10-05", "type": "review"}

Today, Sunday October 18th, had been marked as the \"Lowest Price\" day. However when I went to buy tickets that are advertised at the lowest price of $53.99, the price in the cart jumped to $68.99 (same price hike for other admission types as well).\n\nWell, I called the park and eventually got transferred to a manager at a \"call center\". The manager said that the price today was $63.99 and sort of just kept repeating that. I explained they are advertising a lower price on a day marked \"Lowest Price\" but she didn't budge. She then said that price being advertised is only for earlier in the year, but I countered that it's currently on the site being advertised -- if they had no plans of offering that price anymore, it should not continue to be advertised. \n\nShe then placed blame on \"the person who runs the website\", and actually encouraged me to make a complaint against the web person. That's pretty dumb, the web person doesn't decide what's being advertised, they just follow orders from whoever runs ticketing. \n\nThat person was fairly rude but this may of been because they didn't have authority to actually do anything. \n\nThe advertised pricing is confusing to customers, and probably purposely so. It's a bait and switch with acknowledged intent to no longer offered a currently displayed price. The \"As low as..\" wording may have covered them if they didn't also have the \"Lowest Price\" designation clearly displayed on their calendar.\n\nThis is a frustrating and possibly illegal practice (admission confusion is a common problem at other parks too) and something hope Carowinds will change to better serve their customers.", "business_id": "n9iK0s1dKxv5JLi3u1eTkQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-10-18", "type": "review"}

The staff is SO friendly, even more so than any other Y I have been to. Each time I walk in the door or exit, I turn down my music on my iPod to say Hello or Goodbye to the staff at the front desk because they always make an effort to speak to me. And I truly appreciate that. I have also spoken to a couple of the trainers several times, including Victor, who is always very smiley and helpful if I need it. Bonus: If I am not in a conversational mood, the staff just smiles instead of bothering me while I am trying to get my workout on. I'm sure some of you have experienced the flirty male trainers who want to stop you mid workout to chat.. Ugh.\n\nThis location is a little smaller than the main Y's but it has plenty of room to move around as all of the machines and cardio equipment are located on the main level. The lower level houses the fitness classrooms so if you never take one, then you will never see them. No people to watch you while you look like an idiot doing Zumba or yoga stretches. ;)\n\nThe locker rooms are clean and organized and also offer a sauna and steam room!\n\nThe member base of this gym is sometimes sort of blah. A ton of the BofA workers work out here after work or on their lunch break so there sometimes isn't a lot of variety or excitement.. but that's not why we go to a gym is it?!

But fear not! I found a couple of great classes- my favorite easily being turbo kick (Meredith C and Anna K are such great motivators- and they will leave you with a killer workout!). I also really like total strength and cardio strength. Recently I tried rock-it-cardio strength which left me very sore and thus I will probably add that one to my repertoire as well. \n\nClasses that are iffy include Wednesdays Athletic Conditioning which in itself is difficult but a particular female instructor Becky, is a screamer (in an echo-y gym) and doesn't explain directions well so my first class had to be my last...I left with a big headache! The other iffy one is zumba which I feel focuses too much on the dance aspect and not enough cardio itself - thus it's hard to follow along with the hand gestures but doesn't really give me as intense of a work out as turbo-kick.\n\nIt took me a few months to figure out I could park in the church lot (and walk in the back area near the pool) but since then I haven't had an hassles in the parking lot as there are almost always spots there. \n\nTemp-wise the gym is a little stuffy and gets really crowded. I also wish they capped some of the classes...and specifically offered the weight classes in a room with mirrors (at least the beginner classes) - it makes it easier to keep a flat back and watch your positioning.  \n\nFinally if any ladies are reading this - the locker room is just downright uncomfortable at times. Shower curtains are there for a reason and no, I don't want to sit in the hot-tub with you while you're naked after you worked out-gross!

I think I pay more in taxes than I actually net on the small amount of additional income it gets me, so I'd hope any bias I have is well-tempered.\n\nAs someone whose been to almost all the county's Ys, I'm a big fan of the C-K.  Tucked into the Wachovia (now Wells Fargo???) One building, and adjacent to the Hilton, this beacon of sweat calls to the uptown corporate crowd and those in town for just a few nights.  Hint: almost all the traveling shows for the performing arts center give their crew and cast passes to come and use this Y.  I've met dancers, singers, and performers of most of the bigger shows here.  Humorist David Sedaris (and his sister), for example, were in town recently for a one night performance- they both came to swim and had a great time (he even mentioned the visit during the show!).\n\nSo why this Y?  3 main reasons.  First, this place is not so gargantuan that you would get lost making your way from the lockers to the gym floor.  This also means the crowds are manageable and people tend to know the other people around.  I don't find this so much at the Dowd, for example.  The friendly aires here are just a little more appealing both for motivational and enjoyment of the visit purposes.  \n\nSecond, the cardio and weight equipment is well-maintained and logically laid out.  They just put in new free weights and redesigned that part of the gym with some new machines to boot- which was a nice upgrade.  People here generally care enough to wipe down the machines after they are done and don't mind letting you work in for sets.  When you are on a schedule, this helps.\n\nThird, everything you want is here in one place.  Group Ex classes, a pool, an indoor track, personal training and basketball half court.  If you get hungry, check out the food bar at the entrance- it's get a nice selection of food options that aren't fried or wrapped in cheese and bread.  I also find at least the men's locker room to be amply sized, with plenty of shower stalls, a steam room, a sauna, and plenty of lockers for day use.  \n\nLunchtime tends to be busiest, but the early morning crowd gets decently sized too.  The after work rush is much more subdued lately, no real idea why.  If you want the place almost to yourself, come in between 8:30 am - 11:00 am or 2:30 pm - 5:00 pm.  Amazing how things empty out then.  \n\nOne note of clarification- parking is free for up to 2.5 hours in the Wachovia/Hilton deck so long as your are out before 8:30 am or enter after 4:30 pm.  The times do not apply on the weekends, though I am sure the gym here is closed completely on Sundays.  Whatever you do, just make sure you stamp your parking ticket with the Y stamp at the entrance.  The parking deck attendants have little mercy for those who do not follow the restrictions.  Comprende?\n\nI'm a morning person and the best part of this gym, for me, is the community of regulars who also make the daily pilgrimage to burn some calories before the sun rises.  There are some serious athletes who train like crazy and some desk jockeys who live for their exercise highs outside of the office (that's my hand raised in the back of the room).  In all, it is a great mix of people who will open up if you take the time to talk to them.  Join one of the early morning running groups or become one of the die-hards looking for some self-inflicted punishment in one of the boot-camp style fitness classes- whatever your flavor of exercise, you can find it here and all in one nice, compact easy to access place.", "business_id": "M89_KGMzLmdevtAlC_Ufsg", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-11-18", "type": "review"}

Whether for birthdays, work meetings, or just a desire for a nice night out Blue never disappointed, and they often outperformed even themselves on many occasions.\n\nThe staff here is without a doubt one of the best trained in the city, from the waiters to the hostess to the managers and owners, everyone treats you with a high level of respect, and makes you feel like you are the most important person in the restaurant when you're there. After a few visits I found one waiter I liked even more than the others, and I would always request his table when I came, with no problem from the scheduler. Don't forget, if you bring your own wine (which I do quite frequently) make sure to pour some for your waiter! Not that you NEED to bring wine to Blue, because they have a wine list that is second to none (well, maybe Bonterra) in Charlotte.\n\nIt's hard to recommend specific dishes at Blue, because I've had so many fantastic ones and they change very frequently with the seasons. It's a Mediterranean style of cuisine, so expect heavily herbed flavors on whatever you get, and an emphasis on great sauces. Perhaps my favorite meal here was a whole shank of Osso Bucco, served over fava beans and mashed sweet potatoes, with a crab and lobster risotto on the side. Pure decadence. If you see this dish on the menu it is the one thing I would suggest getting over anything else, as the meat is so fall-off-the-bone delicious it is nearly impossible to surpass. The duo of bison cuts is another one I would highly recommend.\n\nThe cheese selection at Blue is also top-notch. There are usually 15-20 to choose from, including several expensive bleu cheeses, which are fortunately all the same price here. It comes with honeycomb and pecans on the side, and unlike many other restaurants doesn't cost extra. Another one of my favorite elements about this restaurant is the very first thing you get when you sit down, hearty bread and the most wonderful spread I've ever tasted. It's a kalamata olive based butter that looks a bit funky at first, but once you eat your first piece the bowl gets quickly emptied.\n\nBe sure to save plenty of room for desert as well (Blue's dinner portions can be quite dramatically large) because they whip up some of the fanciest creations you can find in the Charlotte area. And for those of you that don't go for overly sweet temptations there is also a huge fresh berry desert with homemade ice cream, one of my favorites!", "business_id": "eaqJQP6bp7rQJQt5KqfvxQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-09-26", "type": "review"}

I visited on a weeknight, and enjoyed the darker, upscale ambiance.  However, based on previous reviews, the food is hit or miss.  My dinner there was a substantial miss for a pretty substantial price. \n\nI ordered the mixed green salad and it was nothing special -- the dressing was blah and it was just regular goat cheese -- no crust, no heat, etc.  I ordered the NY Strip because the waiter said it was amazing, as did another member of my group.  Side note: the service was phenomenal, no problems in that department.  When it arrived, we both found the steak to be EXTREMELY tough.  I know it's not a filet, but you're supposed to be able to get your knife through it without breaking a sweat.  I didn't try my friend's steak, but he actually sent his back for being virtually inedible.  He swapped out for a filet with blue cheese and was quite pleased that he did.  Maybe I should have done the same....I don't know, but if you have to send your food back in order to get a decent meal, it's a pretty bad sign, especially at an expensive establishment.  In Blue's defense, I believe they were pretty upset about my friend's meal -- we basically got an entire desert tray for free.  Those were luckily delicious, as they made up a substantial part of my otherwise sub-par meal. \n\nBottom line, I will not go here again except for cocktails, some appetizers, and some jazz.

He was impressed with the restaurant's selection and we were with his. I also had a microbrew amber ale on draft that was wonderful.\nService: Was not over or underdone. Had the flair and attention of a nice establishment without being too snobby/formal. One bottle of wine we particularly liked ran out so the manager came over to talk about similar choices. Nice touch.\nAppetizers: Choosing cheese and then pairing them with membrio, walnuts and bread was lovely. The house bread with butter mixed with kalamata olives was a wonderful touch.  The calamari rivaled your favorite sports bar (I expected better). The Flavors of the Mediterranean plate was good but not extraordinary. It was a nice option from standard fare for certain though.\nMain meal: For the price we each agreed we didn't get anything special. Certainly the seasonal Jumbo Scallops on Risotto was good, but it wasn't lovely. Almost too salty and there was nothing tying the seafood with the grain. And I adore both items. The Bolognese was described as 'eh' and 'standard' and the two who got the pork roasts were equally so-so in review and description.\nAtmosphere: A jazz trio started up as we ate and it added a light and fun atmosphere to the experience. Tables around us were in good spirits, the lighting was set just right and there was enough space to move between tables (very uncommon in SF). It was nice.\n\nConclusion: This was a good experience but not great. I don't want to think because this is a smaller town then I'm used to, \"nice\" local places  = lower standards. I tend more to think there were good ideas here not executed to their fullest. 3 stars is all about the food which is ultimately why we pay these prices and go to these places. I think if the ingredients were fresher and the temperatures and spices were watched closer then this could be a 5 star no matter in what city it's located.", "business_id": "eaqJQP6bp7rQJQt5KqfvxQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-10-16", "type": "review"}

We figured this would give us an opportunity to sample Blue from a limited menu at a cheaper price and then we could return if we really liked it.  \n\nUpon arrival, we were escorted past the empty dining room to a small room in the back of the restaurant, next to the restrooms, that had no windows and certainly not the ambiance of the rest of the restaurant.  We soon realized that this small room in the back was where they put the theatergoers who booked the package, because we overheard others there talking about going to the show as well.  At the time, we didn't say anything to the hostess about the terrible seating because we assumed we were seated here because we were getting a special limited menu for the dinner package and weren't paying \"full price.\"  \n\nOur server, Jason, came to greet us (I only know his name because it's on the receipt; he never introduced himself to us) and we inquired about how to use the tickets since this was our first time booking a dinner package through Blumenthal.  He told us they were each worth $40 (what we paid for them) and we could use that $40 however we wanted to, based on the pricing on the menu.  He left and when he returned, I asked again about the tickets because I was under the impression they included soup or salad, entr\u00e9e, dessert, and a non-alcoholic beverage.  He reiterated his spiel about the tickets just being cash value.  After he left the table, my partner and I looked at each other confused.  We questioned why we bothered to reserve and purchase these tickets in the first place if we could have booked our own dinner reservation at Blue and paid for our bill without the tickets.  By doing so, we would have been seated in the main dining room and not have been treated like steerage shoved to the bottom of the ship!\n\nJason returned and started to deliver his spiel about the menu in a monotone, looking around the room the whole time instead of maintaining eye contact, as if he couldn't be bothered with us.  (We overheard him deliver this same spiel in monotone to the other tables as well.  There was nothing personalized about it.)  One phrase in his spiel particularly bothered me.  He said that we \"should try something that we wouldn't normally prepare at home.\"  What was that supposed to mean?  Was Jason suggesting that because we booked this dinner package (which was no deal at all, as it turned out) and were sitting in the back room by the bathrooms that we ate nothing but fish sticks and tater tots at home?   Who was serving whom?\n\nMy partner started with the poached pear & argula salad; I had the butternut squash soup.  Both were good, but nothing extraordinary for the size and price.  Then we split the falafel appetizer, which was delicious, thick, and flavorful.  To our surprise, we were then (after finishing the other starters?) brought bread with an olive butter.  \n\nFor entrees, I ordered the grouper with pumpkin and duck risotto.  The grouper was average (not much flavor or spices added to it), but the pumpkin risotto was delicious.  It was creamy with a lot of flavor, complemented by the crunchy pumpkin seed topping.  I could have done without the shredded duck mixed in it (duck is usually too greasy for me), but I still ate and enjoyed it.  The \"micro arugula salad\" that was supposed to come with the entree must have been so micro that it wasn't visible to the naked eye.  My partner \"tried something that we wouldn't normally prepare at home.\"  He went with the wild boar.  It was good; kind of like roast beef.   The black currant marmalade on top added a little sweetness.  \n\nWhile the food we had at Blue was delicious, the experience, seating, and pretentiousness of our server was not worth the money and aggravation.  Worse, it turned out that we were were deceived with our \"dinner package\" and paying just as much money as anyone else in that restaurant, only without the service that I expect from a quality restaurant.  We ended up paying above and beyond our \"dinner package\" pricing for less than was quoted to be \"included.\"  Plus, we got to stare at a blue wall with crooked framed pictures in a small room instead of out in the open dining room where the room was dimly lit to create a mood and you could see out the restaurant windows.  \n\nMy rating of 3 stars for the experience and value is generous, but it's only for the quality of some of the food items we tried.  The entrees were 5 stars, the appetizers 3-4, the seating 2, the service and dinner package both get a 1.", "business_id": "eaqJQP6bp7rQJQt5KqfvxQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-11-13", "type": "review"}

I made reservations on www.OpenTable.com and we were seated right away upon arrival.  I had requested that we be seated in the main dining area (instead of the back area near the restrooms that looks like it should be reserved only for large parties).  The main room had a LOT more atmosphere to it, and we were thankful to be a part of it this time.  \n\nOur server was fantastic.  He was very friendly and the opposite of snobby (unlike our server during last year's visit).  We ordered martinis and he shook them in individual shakers right at our table before pouring them.  They were very delicious.  Nightly, they have a martini special, so be sure to ask what it is!   Because they were so affordable, we ordered two each!\n\nFor appetizers, we ordered the (1) calamari and (2) scallops.  Our server informed us that there were two scallops in the appetizer and asked if we wanted three so each person in our party could have one.  We readily agreed and the small upcharge was worth it.  The jumbo scallops had SO much flavor to them and were cooked to perfection.  The calamari was tasty, too!   The kitchen put both appetizers on one large serving platter, so it wouldn't take up a lot of space on our table.  Very smart!  \n\nFor entrees, I opted for the sea bass.  Our server \"warned\" me that the sea bass is brought out whole.  I was hesitant at first because I didn't want to have to pick through the skin and have the head hanging off one side of my plate and the tail off the other.  He then advised me that he brings it whole and then filets it at the table for me, taking away the skin, head, and tail.  So I agreed, figuing it would be entertaining as well, which it was.  He earns bonus points for all that work.  He nicely fileted the fish, leaving only the head attached to the spine and bones.   Yes, there were a couple of small bones in my sea bass, but all in all, he did a fantastic job.  And it was very tasty.  \n\nWe left Blue with a much more favorable impression, so we were glad we returned.  The pricing is a little more than we care to spend on a regular basis, though, so repeat visits will have to be for special occasions only.", "business_id": "eaqJQP6bp7rQJQt5KqfvxQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-09-28", "type": "review"}

On my first visit, there was a Spanish jazz band which was a first for my ears and my ears greatly appreciated the sound. Every time I have gone there has been a different band and that is a plus for me so I can be exposed to varying sounds and types of music.\n\nThe mellow and laid back nature of Blue is very calming and soothing after a wild night downtown and gets me in a calming and peaceful mood before ending the night. I love how the restaurant is very intimate and that the lights are dim throughout the bar. \n\nNow, I can't sit in the bar area and not have a drink or two or three haha! They have drink specials that definitely should be taken advantage of and even if your favorite drink isn't on special, you should still try them out.

A large group of us went out to celebrate a friend's birthday. We all ordered drinks at the bar and waited for all of our friends to arrive. After having a cocktail, we were quickly seated and met by a very nice waitress who not only eloquently described the specials but also made some excellent suggestions for first time visitors. Because there were so many of us, we were able to order quite an assortment of food - salads, apps, and shared entrees. Everything was delicious. \n\nBlue even has a gluten-free menu - one of the reasons I love this restaurant so much is that their gluten-free menu is almost identical to their regular menu because they have such a focus on making amazing ingredients simply delicious without a lot of extras added in... \n\nI was impressed by everything and I will definitely be back to enjoy dinner here again.", "business_id": "eaqJQP6bp7rQJQt5KqfvxQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-11-10", "type": "review"}

Our drinks were fantastic.\n\nFOr starters we ordered the Arrancini. Although this is pretty much just fried cheese balls we both thought that they were very well executed. They were not overly greasy and had a great taste. \n\nFor out main course my wife ordered the Beef Tenderloin, medium rare, and I ordered the Grilled Rack of Australian Lamb, rare. They both tasted exquisite with amazing flavor.\n\nThis would be a 5 star review except we both felt like Blue was overly pricey for what the food was.

Maybe a warning sign. Valet parking was easy, as there was a basketball game, so Charlotte was busy.  The jazz ensemble was playing when we walked in.  Pretty cool - so far.  It took me a while, but I realized after a while that the inside of this place reminds me of a restaurant you would find inside of a Radisson in a medium sized city.  A restaurant that serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner - and mostly from a buffet (not that there's a buffet, here) - I'm speaking about the (lack of) atmosphere.  It was also very loud.  I couldn't really hear the jazz band, just a large amount of noise.  \n\nOh, yeah, the food.  I ordered the Antipasti, and my wife ordered the Pumpkin She Crab Soup.  Those were both pretty good.  My wife ordered a glass of wine, and the pour was pretty minimal.  Look - we get it, we're not going to make the restaurants night on liquor.  I didn't order alcohol, and my wife only ordered a glass - but it was below the 1/4 full mark.  Pretty lame.  \n\nFor the main course, I had the lamb, which is a specialty, and my wife ordered the chicken stuffed with mushrooms and mascarpone.  We would never normally order chicken at a restaurant, but glad we did.  It saved the meal.  It was really good.  The lamb, however, was a stew, with veggies and such in a large pot.  It is as advertised.  It lacked a lot in the flavor department.  \n\nOne word of warning.  If you get the sea bass, it is filleted table side.  The couple (right) next to us ordered it, and it smelled, and looked kind of gross.  It kind of set me off for the rest of the meal.  \n\nDesserts were good.  I ordered the brownie topped with raspberry semifreddo, and she ordered the salted carmel pudding.  Both were OK - but not awesome.  We also had to wait for coffee.  \n\nThe service was ok, but not great.  Our waters weren't refilled but once.  \n\nI waffle between 2 stars and 3.  I think the best way to describe it is, we wouldn't go back unless some good friends really wanted to go there.", "business_id": "eaqJQP6bp7rQJQt5KqfvxQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-11-03", "type": "review"}

Whenever there is seared Fois Gras on the menu, I get it.

So I got it. The first thing I noticed were the incredible aromas. This smelled sublime!\n\nThe dish was obviously a big lamb shank in the middle, with lots of veggies and starches (aka potatoes) surrounding the meat. What was somewhat disappointing was that the meat was NOT as \"fall off the bone\" tender as was described to me. It was good no doubt, but not as tender as prescribed. In fact some of it was so chewy that I couldn't eat it all. So I'd say this dish was a \"miss\" in many phases of the game.\n\nThe service was good, but they did add some things to my check that I didn't order. Thankfully our table's waiter didn't fuss at us and immediately took off the charge when we protested. Now THAT's a great waiter!\n\nAt the end of the evening, I got it all straightened out.

My hubby had the grilled red snapper-a whole grilled fish -yes head and tail included!  It was outstanding.  We order whole fish often when it is available.  It's the best way to preserve the moisture and flavor of the fish and this fish was no exception.

It's a fairly straightforward asian fusion place that offers americanized versions of Chinese and other Asian cuisine.  It's really not that special, and some dishes (Singapore noodles) you wonder why they're charging $9 for them.\n\nIt's a safe place to go for the less-than-adventurous lunch crowd that's looking to \"try something new\".

The bookstore can be relatively expensive so I would recommend shopping around before buying any textbook through CPCC.

I stop here at least once a week to get my carb on.  I absolutely love this place, and let me tell you why.\n\nI first discovered their delectable bread at the farmer's market a few months ago.  I'm forever on a quest for a good bakery.  The had samples of everything they offered that day, so I got to try a few different things.  That first day, I purchase their spinach and feta bread (like a savory, moist challah bread - so good!!).  The texture was perfect, and the eggs made it such a moist bread.  I also tried their blondies that day.  For two dollars a piece, you get a 3x3x1 (or slightly bigger, depending) bar cookie.  It was so buttery and fantastic!  Since then, I've tried many different styles of their bread and desserts.  Their garlic cheddar bread is divine, and they have some of the best whole grain breads I've ever tasted.  If you like a nuttier bread, their Dakota is chocked full of pepitas and sunflower seeds.  Even their low carb whole grain bread is fantastic, and it doesn't taste like the light bread you buy in the store.\n\nBest of all, they don't use any preservatives in their bread.  They use freshly milled grains (ground within 24 hours), which apparently retains some of the natural protein found in the grain.  They also sell all of their goods within 48 hours and donate unsold bread to charity.  Their ingredient list and nutrition information is readily available on their website, along with a schedule of days when certain bread is produced.  The rotate their menu every month, although they do have some bread they offer every day.  The staff has always been patient, friendly, and helpful in answering questions.\n\nWhen you go to their bakery location, you can try anything they have out that day as well, including desserts, cookies, and \"scuffins\" (a cross between a scone and a muffin).  They also offer sandwiches, homemade jelly, and coffee, but I've not tried any of them.  For the holidays, you can purchase pies or their \"jewel bread,\" which is basically a super delicious fruit cake.\n\nTheir prices on bread are about $4.50 to $6.50, which seems a little steep until I think about all the bread I end up wasting when I purchase store-bought loaves.  It's a rare occasion that the bread I buy here doesn't get eaten.  \n\nIf you're looking for healthy, fresh bread, this is definitely the place to go.", "business_id": "q6liXMxYTMYx7evcgz1eQQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-11-21", "type": "review"}

Do you wash every vegetable and fruit that comes into your house?  Make sure you scrub it really good bc those insecticides leave a residue that cant be just rinsed off, not to mention the field workers that collected the vegetables for you.  Btw, do you think they have bathrooms with sanitary wipes in the crop fields?   Pick the hair off and enjoy the crispy noodles. sheesh.    \n\nA grumpy cashier,  well maybe you would be grumpy too after a long day working to feed your extended family.  Or maybe the customer before you was a total jerk to the guy and he was trying his best to hold it in.     \n\nIt is a family restaurant, not some corporate crap hole, be glad there are still some entrepreneurs out there willing to put up with ungrateful customers so they can feed their families and make an honest living.", "business_id": "JgGpBGMAb1Nc2Z5jVIwZMA", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-10-24", "type": "review"}

Komen Foundation.  They do this a few times throughout the year and other times they benefit St. Jude's Children's Hospital.  A chance to eat well and contribute to a good cause?  Sign me up!!\n\nThere was 3 of us and in the past they would put us at a table w/2 burners, but not this time.  In the end we really didn't need different cheese/chocolates anyway.  \n\nWe started with the cheese they are offering on the Big Night Out, it was some sort of french mixture with brie, gruyere, swiss, bacon, truffles, chives and wine.  It was delish!!  Followed that up w/house salads, I love their house dressing.  Then we had our entree.  If I go on a non-charity type night I never order the entree, I don't think its that good and I would prefer tp fill up on the other stuff, but it was included so we ate it.  It included, 3 shrimp, 3 pieces of chick, 3 pieces of steak, 2 ravioli and a bowl of potatos, mushrooms and broccoli to throw in the pot, and 6 different sauces to try.  \n\nLast but definitely not least was the chocolate.  We went with the cookies & cream, it was dark chocolate with toasted marshmallow and oreo cookie pieces.  Sounds awful right?  It comes with strawberries, bananas, cheesecake, brownies, pound cake, rice krispy treats, and different coated marshmallows.  My oldest sister and I were soo full at this point but we couldn't make ourselves stop dipping all the yummy treats into that warm chocolate, our younger sister kept making fun of our gluttonous ways, but I didn't care. \n\nMelting Pot is not the type of place you go weekly or monthly because I really feel like you need to be in the mood for the whole experience and for the almost painfully full feeling you will most definitely have when you leave.

I have always wanted to go, so we went for my birthday on 9/28, unsure of what to expect. I browsed the menu before arriving- not only because I do that before going to any restaurant, but also to try to prepare myself as it seemed like a complicated menu. Despite our newbie status, our waiter, Dave Y., was friendly and patient and guided us through the menu with skill. I cannot say enough good things about our service! Yes, it is an expensive meal, but their \"Ultimate Four-Course meal\" is a must-do at least once for anyone who goes. \nThe cheddar fondue was to die for, and for the \"Ultimate\" meal we chose the premium meats for the cheese, and we were very happy with that choice. The strawberry salad was light and refreshing, a nice break before the main course. We went with the Mojo-style cooking broth, which was very tasty and complimented out meat choices nicely (we chose duck, chicken, pork, and filet, as well as the ravioli. Also included were veggies and potatoes). All of the dipping sauces were perfect. Finally, the portion of the meal we were both looking forward to most, the chocolate, was as amazing as we both expected it to be. Out of all the chocolates, we quickly decided on the flaming turtle and enjoyed every piece of dessert and bite of chocolate! \nWe were both expecting to be completely stuffed by the end of the meal, and even though it was a lot of food, it was the right amount for each course. We left feeling full but not bursting at the seams. A final note, for us the entire meal took about 2 and a half hours, so be sure to allow ample time- don't arrive at 9pm unless you don't mind staying up late!\nI am big on the \"experience\" of going out to eat- if I am taking the time and money to eat outside of my home, I don't want to be rushed and I want to enjoy the time, and The Melting Pot met and exceeded my expectations for dining out!", "business_id": "uDoTFFud2mXE3VT1Jt9L5A", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-09-30", "type": "review"}

I was hesitant to see if I would indeed cook the meat enough to eat it, but to my surprise and thanks to the very helpful staff, it turned out amazing! I opted for the the Strawberry salad because it cleansed my palette and also was very light and refreshing to not weigh me down between courses. The Mojo cooking method is a definite not only for the flavor you can pack into the meat, chopped veggies and potatoes, but also the aromatics are beyond delightful! The sauces were very well paired for the main entree and I definitely enjoyed being able to make my own creation in a way and cook it to order with customized flavor because each person may like a little more or less seasoning. The dessert, let's just say one of a kind! We chose the chocolate fondue and then came the pieces of yummy cake, fruits like strawberries and bananas!

It makes it great for date nights!   \nUsually, we opt for the 4-Course Experience.\nWe always start out with the Cheddar Cheese.  My gosh!   Wow!  It is just so good.  We like a tad of extra garlic in ours and the server will always oblige.  Sometimes, my husband gets mad when the pot gets empty!  \nNext, my husband always gets the House Salad.  They are always so fresh and crisp. When I don't get a salad I will ask for a fruit plate which they substitute at no additional charge.  \nFor our cooking style we always go with the Court Bouillon.  We have tried so many of the entrees here but our favorite is the Land & Sea.   Now, I will have to admit that we switch the chicken out with extra Steak on my plate and extra Shrimp on his. We just like those two the best! You can create your entree any way you like.  \nThe BEST part is the ending....the CHOCOLATE dessert.  The Ying and Yang is what we like.  We once again substitute Milk Chocolate for the Dark Chocolate.  Oh its so good.  The pound cake, strawberries, bananas.  Wow!!  I do wish they would bring back the plain cheesecake though.   We miss it.  \nThe service here is always good.  There are a few that's our favorites because they talk and joke wth us but everyone is very professional and nice.  The manager here is AWESOME.  He always stops by and greets us and checks on things because he sees our name on the reservations.  As you see with my review you can make this experience custom to the way you would like it and you will get every bit of your money's worth.  I highly recommend.", "business_id": "uDoTFFud2mXE3VT1Jt9L5A", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-11-23", "type": "review"}

For some reason, the acidity was too high and some of the flavors did not bode well together.  \n\nMy friends raved about the Nutella pie: it was good but it was much more like a Cheesecake Factory cheesecake slice than a pie: huge and don't order more than one per table--too much. For dinner, we ordered the Pollo Bianco and since we both wanted it, we decided for family style. The family style doesn't come with side dishes so you have to order those separately--so we did. But then they brought the single serving and still brought the sides--and the single serving is served on top of mashed potatoes: one of the sides we ordered. Enter double sides of mashed potatoes. I will say the sauce of the chicken was good, but the mashed potatoes were the same as anywhere else. \n\nI guess it's just another standard chain restaurant. Too bad. It could have been so much more.", "business_id": "MQnNtW1lHS-eid3QNUoUIw", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-09-27", "type": "review"}

I've had several great experiences both in the restaurant and with their catering. That being said, last night's performance -aside from the scrumptious food- was not acceptable.\n\nI went with a group of ~15 people to Mama Ricotta's for a Christmas function. I was one of the people that voted to have the event at the restaurant because I've had such great experiences in the past. I know a larger party requires patience on both ends and that mistakes are inevitable, but we had quite a few... our drink orders were mixed up repeatedly. One person ordered a salad with romaine lettuce and it came out with iceburg. The servers kept placing the wrong meals with the wrong individuals, which I know is hard not to do with a big group -but it added to our frustration. We did all get our food, but none of the dishes came out at the same time, so several people's food was cold by the time the final entree came out. \n\nThe real fun started with the checks. Given the issues we had getting the right entree/drink to the right person, we knew the bills were going to be a nightmare -and they were. It took nearly 45 minutes to get our bills straightened out. By the time I actually received my bill (which was about 10 minutes after everyone else had paid and was leaving the restaurant) it was incorrect. I notified the server that my glass of Pinot Grigio was not on the ticket, he asked if that was a red wine. I know you only have to be 18 to serve alcohol, but it's important for servers to know which wines are white and which are red for customer service purposes. The server tried again with the ticket, which I had to go to the hostess stand to get, and it still did not have a glass of wine on it. Because I needed to leave I spoke to the manager, who was very nice and told me just to pay for my entree... but he kind of made me feel like I was making a stink to get my wine comped -which was not the case.\n\nWill I try Mama Ricotta's again? Yes, but never again will I go back with a large group & I'll make sure not to order wine next time.", "business_id": "MQnNtW1lHS-eid3QNUoUIw", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-11-28", "type": "review"}

It wasn't the best music ever, but it was loud, fast and fun, and everyone was having a good, drunken time. \n\nDefinitely  a fun place to party.

He had immediate attitude b/c I wanted water and then charged $3 per bottle.  Later, I went to the other bartender for another water.  Hmmm, he charged me only $2.

I do like the bar on the separate level and the amount of seating around the bar. There really isn't a bad seat in the house as the sound carries fairly well throughout. The stage is pretty small, but has been good for all types of shows. I've seen rock shows, punk rock, singer-songwriters, and even a few church services at this venue. All have been A-Ok in reference to sound. \n\nMy only gripe would be the parking situation. It's always a little iffy with all of the restaurants and hospital that close. There are signs that notify towing will ensue and yadda yadda, but it's never always very clear. There is parking along the street, but the spaces are snagged like loose gold. \n\nAll in all, I'm glad this venue is in Charlotte/Elizabeth.

Well, I was bored but I know for a 100% fact, I acted very excited / eager at the slightest hint of an assignment... just so I wouldn't seem \"bored / disinterested\". This had such a negative impact on not only my grade, but my self esteem. I had ALWAYS been a great student and very respectful, so this was a huge surprise to me and my teachers.

This has been verified when I look at my cheque--they list the spiciness requested next to the dish.\n\n2)  While quick to refill water, if you order any other beverage, it gets forgotten.  My soda/tea glass is empty, and I eventually have to ask the waiter for a refill.  In terms of service, this is a big issue for me, personally.\n\nBottom line:  good food, pretty good service.  I hope to one day be in Charlotte to try the lunch buffet other reviewers have raved about.\n\nOne last item, this place is in a _tiny_ shopping area with a _tiny_ parking lot, so be forewarned.", "business_id": "nuCgH96Tfe6CFXznvmKdhA", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-09-13", "type": "review"}

Despite being all over the map (sushi, chinese, malaysian, thai, japanese) Cuisine Malaya does really well (as in, authentic) with some stuff, pretty well with the rest. Decent prices + me being able to sit down and have decently executed cuisine from 4 different asiatic countries for dinner = awesome.\n\nThe lunch menu is limited but still very veg friendly. Dinner is where its at. I love malaysian curry (well, curry of any kind, really) and the Curry Vegetable Chef's special hits the spot. Okra and eggplant, tomato, tofu, green beans, yes yes. Oily, smokey curry and delicious coconut milk, yumm. Unless you're ravenous, the 11$ will be well spent, as you'll have lunch for the next day. And we all know curries improve overnight ;) They have both Thom Kha and Hot n Sour veg options, both soups I adore. Tofu can be added/subbed to almost anything here.\n\nAll the sushi I've had has been perfectly prepared, with good ingredients. The rolls aren't 80% rice, 20% stuff. They're also flexible about ingredients, something a lot of places are not (have them make you a vegetable tempura roll - delicious).\n\nI wish they had coconut rice, and gado gado. I don't get the \"shrimp sauce\" served with the hibachi items (a mixture of what tasted like mayo and ketchup, yikes). For my malaysian curry fix, however...

I first visited this place to sample the Indian fare which had a good spin on the campus at CPCC. \nOf course I was drawn to the cliche 1950's pacific-rim archaeologist motif (fan-tan, folding fans, bamboo, etc.) but it was just slightly interesting as compared to the sushi menu, which was surprisingly diverse. The Maki rolls were above average and the Soundboy roll (spicy tuna or smoked salmon Philly tempura) was very good. \nThey have a good selection of Japanese beer and the house sake is the only warm sake on the menu, \nso there is no immediate reason to order the fancy-pants selections, unless you are trying to impress someone - but that can easily backfire like a '79 Dodge Aspen going up a hill. Stick to what you know, or at least what you have learned so far. The Maki is solid and the Nagiri is good as well. \nThe price is a little above average but you get a decent portion of good sushi. Try the Asahi bottled beer with the warm house sake. If you bring a date you can easily share. \nThe Indian pancake is great for a shared appetizer. The Indian side of the menu is pretty good as well, so give it a shot on your following visit.\nI recommend Malaya overall for the sushi, location and atmosphere. \nAfterward, you can take the short drive Uptown and check out the scene.", "business_id": "MMNBgMQCdwyVoNaHg0h_QA", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-11-24", "type": "review"}

It goes a little something like this: Chinese food has Indian influences, Thai food has Muslim influences, Indian food has Chinese influences and somewhere in that hodgepodge is a little Indonesian and something like that. \n\nTo the novice, this might seem like just another Asian food joint. To the veteran eater, it's so much more. Now the food might look similar, but I can assure you, it tastes completely different. \n\nThat's what Malaya is.

This is slow cooked beef in coconut milk and spices. \n\nWe topped off our meal with a Asian style flat pancake folded over some ground  peanuts and palm sugar that was grilled in a pan to blend the flavors and served with vanilla ice cream.

The wait staff was nice - that's the only reason I gave then two stars instead of one. We should have known to skip this place when we saw the cheesy plastic sign and neon logo, but we decided to give it a chance. Our waitress asked if we wanted to sit somewhere quiet or not (which was considerate), but when we said we'd like a quiet spot, we ended up gitting a table right next to some annoying doorbell thing that gave three loud beeps every time someone walked into or out of the door, so we asked to be moved. We were also given lunch instead of dinner menus, so we had to ask for the right menus. When we finally ordered and got our food, the quantity and price looked okay, but the quality was seriously lacking. The duck in the duck spring roll seemed to be prepared well, but there were none of the other subtle ingredients and flavors that one would expect - no rice noodles, carrots, mint, basil, ect. - just iceberg lettuce and cucumber! And the dipping sauce was overly thick, way too sweet and tasted like something that came out of a jar. The wonton soup broth was bland and oily, and the wontons were okay but tasted like something I could get out of a box from the frozen section of a store. The pineapple fried rice was okay, but didn't have as much chicken or pineapple as we would have expected, the chicken was a bit dry and again - none of the subtle flavors that we're used to in this dish that make it so tasty - cilantro, raisins, cashews, ect. The beef rendeng was terrible - a pile of beef bits in a disgusting looking sauce with a side of unseasoned brocoli and cold canned pineapple. The sauce actually had a decent flavor, but it looked so unappetizing and the beef was so dry that I sent it back.
