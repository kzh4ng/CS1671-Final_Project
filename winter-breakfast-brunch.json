Well, I don't prefer greasy spoon joints, but if it's your thing u will like it! \n\nWhat makes this greasy spoon joint different than others is the amazing variety of pancakes and french toasts- you will not get bored with your breakfast here! As a standard on the menu, they have many flavors to choose from: pumpkin, banana, blueberry, choco chip, raspberry, etc. I ordered the special of the day: chocolate cherry cheesecake pancakes. They were pretty good! I liked that there were actual cherry pieces in the filling- I appreciate real fruit being used in my breakfasts. If u like a pancake that holds up against the weight of toppings and syrup, while maintaining a soft spongey texture, you will like these. I hate when pancakes get immediately soggy- these do not! \n\nThe boyfriend ordered Bob's specialty, as it is not a standard breakfast item either- eggs with German potato pancakes, applesauce, and sour cream- it did not disappoint! The potato pancakes were a tad on the sweet side, but I liked them. \n\nAnother great thing here is the down-home feel of the place- everyone is very friendly.

The chocolate chips are warm and well-melted into the actual pancake itself, making for one delicious yummy bite after the next. Their hot cakes are also a nice choice along with the stuffed raspberry French toast, which was oh so good. The raspberry sauce was actually not as tangy as I anticipated ... which is a good thing, considering that it would have been a sore spot (too sour) if it contrasted too much with the sweet consistency of the dish.

I didn't want to eat too much since I had to drive back home but I did find something of interest.  My wife usually gets steak and eggs but she didn't this time.  I had sort of wanted her to get that so I could have some steak but she went with the ham and eggs with German potato pancakes and white toast.  \n\nI had gone with the all American which was 1/3lb burger, eggs, and lyonese potatoes which is basically homefries with onions with toast.

I'm used to only getting 3 or 4 slices usually.  \n\nWe didn't order anything that they could impress us with I suppose.

Matt suggested the Sandwich Shop with a description of a \"quiet, low key, good food atmosphere\" which was much preferable of any other options at that early hour. So naturally, we are hungry after escaping the hipsters of Remedy we are down for some regular chill.\n\nWe seat ourselves outside to wait out some of the crowd and drink the remainder of our 6 pack of PBR cans [remember we had just come from hipster/lawrenceville] when out of nowhere our simple pleasurable time is disturbed with the outbreak of a 10 person fight! [we got lucky because this is apparently unusual] -- there was even astonishment from the participants [\"REALLY? We are having a fight at the Sandwiche Shoppe????\" - yup pronounced that way]\n\nAnyways, there was much scramble to break up the fight and not stub out eyes with cigarette buds and the chefs did quite a job at driving the trouble makers away. Surprisingly, no cops came checking anything out just drove along liberty ave.\n\nNeedless to say this delayed our now greatly awaited sandwiches which we received for free in the process. [we tipped very well that night] The guy making our food brought us our food and engaged us in a friendly chat for about 15 minutes [much needed to restore his nerves]. Also surprising, we were lucky enough not to be involved in this altercation. \n\nAll together this was a great late night adventure, with dinner AND a show!!!

These are far from our tastes, but they compensate (in our eyes) by taking good care of what they have. The TVs aren't even old flat screens, but they do stock the rooms thoroughly with l'occitane.\n\nWhere this place really shines is in the staff and the food. I actually find this aspect to be _better_ or even _much_ better than many celebrated big-city five-star properties. When was the last time that the night staff pulled some food from the refrigerator (gratis) after a midnight arrival caused by flight delays?\n\nThey make everything in-house and it is all extraordinary. On this last visit, I indulged in their traditional french toast with a side of eggs. I forgot that this all includes an additional course in advance with fruit (not just big grocery store chucks of melon) and house-made cookies and muffins. On each visit, they mix these up. For this December visit, they did gingerbread cookies (of course). The Chef (Jackie), from NYC, could be gainfully employed high up the hierarchy of any top big-city restaurant.\n\nThere is no elevator, so either pack light if you want a room on the 3rd floor or choose a 1st or 2nd floor room. The 1st floor room has double doors so I didn't find it any noisier than the others.

Even when Obama visited the 'Burgh last year he stopped in. By the cashier, there's a picture of him flashing a giant smile, flanked by whom I'm assuming are the owners. (He went to the one on the Strip -- I asked.)\n\nThis particular location is in the Walnut Street shopping district, and it's not terribly large. It's not as funky as the Oakland area Pamela's, but the food is just as good. Upstairs is an unrelated Peruvian shop/cafe, which doesn't seem to serve food on Sundays.\n\nAt about 11:30 AM Sunday morning, on Valentine's Day no less, the wait here was only half an hour. Not bad! The crowd seemed to have doubled by the time my party and I left. Originally we had wanted to go to the Oakland one but it was a total mob scene and tried this location instead.\n\nThe Food: \nFattening, delicious, huge and cheap: every diner should aspire to this! They don't serve lunch specials on Sundays, which is fine because all we wanted were the hotcakes! We all got breakfast specials ($6.75 for 2 eggs any style, 2 hotcakes and ham or sausage or bacon) and were allowed to substitute home fries or toast for the meat options. For $2 extra you could substitute a specialty hotcake. \n\nHUGE HUGE HUGE PORTIONS. Two separate gigantic dinner plates were needed for 1) eggs and home fries and 2) hotcakes which took up the entire plate. I made the mistake of spreading butter on top of my regular hotcakes, which I didn't realize were already approximately 50% butter in the first place. They're thinner and crispier than your average pancake and a little too salty but still good. The speciality hotcakes are more crepe-like in that they're stuffed with the filling of your choice and whipped cream and then rolled up. Whoa.\n\nCoffee's kind of weak.

The menu was interesting with omelets, egg dishes, french toast, and the usual breakfast fare. All that I saw going by looked good, but my recommendation would be, if you go only once, skip all that and go right for a pancake/crepe creation. You will NOT be disappointed.

I say, \"might be\" because on my recent (and last) trip there I didn't have an opportunity to sample them.  In fact, I didn't eat anything at all.\n\nPlease let me explain.\n\nThe restaurant is located in the basement of a building off of Walnut Street.  Customers are expected to wait in a line that stretches from the entrance, through the main dining area, to a counter where the crepes are ordered and cooked.  It's a horrendous setup for multiple reasons.  \n\nFirst, there aren't many tables.  When I went there on a Saturday morning, there were at least 20 people standing in line for the ten or so small tables.  Second, the restaurant expects you to wait in line, standing next to tables of patrons who are eating their food, until a table becomes free.  At that point, the woman at the counter takes the next order, a man begins preparing the crepes, and the front of the line is seated while everyone else continues to wait.  Those who have waited long enough, are finally able to sit, while hungry and impatient diners-to-be stand next to their table and wait some more.\n\nIt's a horrible atmosphere, and not one conducive to a pleasant dining experience.\n\nThe dining space is poorly designed, so that the line of waiting patrons snakes directly though the middle of the cramped dining area.  Which means that when you are waiting, you are continually bumped by servers shuttling food to the tables and dirty dishes back to the kitchen.  When you are eating, you are likely to: 1) have a bunch of hungry people staring at you eat, waiting for you to leave your table, so that they may be seated; and/or 2) have a standing person's ass within a few inches of your head.  What a great dining atmosphere!\n\nWhat's all the more annoying is the lackadaisical work ethic of the people who prepare the crepes.  More than once during my wait, the man making the crepes just stood around, not making any food, waiting for another table to open, so a party's order could be taken, and he could then prepare the next order.  \n\nAfter waiting 15-20 minutes while hungry, becoming increasingly annoyed at being bumped at least 2 dozen times by serves traversing the line, and then seeing the owner stop making food until another order was taken, I said to myself, \"enough of this nonsense\".\n\nMy party and I left to go to another restaurant.  I've not eaten any crepe in the world that would justify a long wait under such annoying circumstances, and I will not be back.", "business_id": "cmGR1HS9ms233roSllcglw", "stars": 1, "date": "2008-12-15", "type": "review"}

It's served in an authentic French fashion, in a handleless bowl and comes with a generous circle of white, velvety foam. The beverage is a little on the hot side, which is usually a no-no when it comes to good coffee, but I let it slide because they still pack it full of flavor.\n\nThis place gets packed on the weekends yet the service has always been impeccable.

Most of the crepes are of the sweeter persuasion.  Which is usually a-okay with me, but I was starving for some sustenance, so I needed to go with the savory.  I choose the veggie crepe, with mushrooms, spinach and tomatoes.  The crepe itself was nice and fluffy, with a good amount of veggies in the middle.  I thought it was the perfect amount and even came with a nice side salad, which included mandarin oranges.  \n\nNow I know a lot of you will say, why not just go for the sweet then, but I've gotta have my savory before I have my sweet.  I know, I'm a weirdo!  But, I had a little bit of my friends dark chocolate and banana crepe and it was just a delicious teaser to what will most certainly be my future dessert here!  \n\nHot Tip:  Cash only!

Not surprisingly, it didn't last long, and my heart broke when it closed and I could only get my crepe fix on my yearly family vacations to Disney World.\n\nIn my sophomore year of college, I studied abroad in Italy, and rediscovered my crepe obsession when I found them in a British-style pub. A trip to Paris for four days had me eating the simple street version each day for breakfast. And then I returned to State College, crepeless and sad. How excited was I when I moved to Pittsburgh and found Crepes Parisiennes? I don't even think I need to answer that question.\n\nThese are GOOD crepes. Perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The topping list is unfortunately very limited. They don't have many veggies, they only have one type of cheese, and they don't have bacon for your breakfast crepe or strawberries for your dessert crepe. Still, you can't really go wrong with any of the combinations.\n\nI came back to State College and tried the new crepe shop in town, and it sucked.

Feel my pain: \n\n.....I get there on Sunday at 1:30pm after the rush was over. Their house special \"Eggs Benny\" covers the whole front of the menu. I order that with a cup of black coffee. I get the coffee then my waitress disappears until 20 minutes later when she brings me my plate. I stop her from running off because the food looks suspicious. Sure enough the poached eggs were hard boiled. \"Is that too cooked for you?\" YES.\n\nI wait and I wait and I wait ( just a few customers in the house) and a whole 15 minutes later she quickly drops off the new plate and runs off, NEVER TO BE SEEN AGAIN. It's been 35 minutes since I first ordered.\n\n One egg is borderline ok, the other is hard boiled again, the Hollandaise is dry and starting to curdle, the English muffins are not toasted properly and they're chewy as hell, the hash browns are absolutely tasteless. Not a micro-gram of salt, pepper, paprika, onions nothing to give it any flavor. \n\nNo waitress anywhere, not only mine but all the ladies wearing black tee-shirts are anywhere but in the dining room. After a few more minutes I lose patience, go to the counter find a waitress and ask her for my check.\n\nThe girl at the cash register asks me how was my meal and I tell her exactly how it went.... in detail. She is very very very sorry but doesn't offer to comp even the coffee. For maybe only the second or third time in my whole life I don't leave a tip. \n\nThe worst Eggs Benny I've ever had, coupled with ridiculously bad service: $15 and some change including a cup of coffee. That's right, over FIFTEEN DOLLARS for this.\n\nedit: check out the review that was filtered, I don't see why it was.

We head there every Sunday after church, always sitting at the bar.  It's not that the seats are more comfy or the food is better.  No, we sit there because 1) there are TVs to watch football but mostly 2) because of the AWESOME bartenders!  Shelly has got to be one of my favorite people in Charlotte, and her partners in crime are also friendly.  She is so friendly and sweet and sassy--a great combo in a bartender!  \n\nThe food, of course, is great too, otherwise we wouldn't keep coming back.  My husband adores the brisket (it IS delicious!).  I have had the turkey burger and the regular burger and loved both of those.  Usually on Sundays I get something from the brunch menu.  My only complaint is that it's a bit lacking in length, but there are pretty good things on it.  I have liked the waffles, I have also had the BELT (which was alright) and the French Toast (which was good, but ask for the fruit compote on the side).  The grits (if you have read any of my previous reviews, you'll know that I LOVE GRITS!!) are good.  They clearly make them with chicken broth, which almost makes them too chicken-y, but they also have cheese.  They're very good. (Today, in fact, they lacked the signature chicken flavor, and were some of the best grits I've ever had!)  \n\nMy husband has had the French Dip Sandwich (pretty good), pork tenderloin (also pretty good--not outstanding) and the Cajun omelette (just okay), but he remains convinced that you should just get the brisket.  For $13, you get a lot of delicious brisket with BBQ sauce, excellent fries, and one more side (it comes with cole slaw, but we've never gotten it.  The green beans were good when I had them).  I have also ordered the brisket, and he's right, it is FANTASTIC!!!\n\nOn Thursday they have trivia night.  My husband and I happened to be there this past Thursday, and beat the long-time reigning champs.  It is pretty easy trivia (college mascots, car makers, countries and continents were our categories this week. Apparently the reigning champs COMPLAINED that the questions were too hard.  Excuse me?  You've won for the last few months and have the balls to complain that the questions are too hard?  I don't like these guys.  I'm glad we kicked their asses.--sorry I just got totally off-topic.).

But even if you get stuck in a bit of rush - no worries!  The attendants are usually very prompt in their service and get you in and out as quickly as possible.

The food is expensive (~$12 for two eggs, toast, bacon, coffee) and the coffee isn't great, but the atmosphere is nice and I didn't come all that often so it seemed like sort of a luxury. The staff also isn't particularly outgoing, though not downright rude... until today. \n\nToday is Sunday, and I arrived around 8am. I usually try to get there kind of early and leave before it gets busy so I'm not taking up a table. I bought a big breakfast (as described above) and sat down to work. Just over an hour later, I was approached by a middle-aged man whom I assume is the owner or manager but whom I've never seen before. He asked if I was aware of their \"new policy\" about Wi-Fi on Sunday mornings, and how they don't want people just hanging out using the internet when it gets crowded. (No sugar coating, that's almost verbatim what he said.) For the record, I wasn't actually using their wi-fi, I was writing. Whatever. His point was obvious. I stared at him for a few seconds because I couldn't believe that a proprietor was actually asking me, a paying customer, to leave when I had been there only an hour and in fact still had toast on my plate. He suggested it was fine for now but that when it started to get crowded I should get out. I said that if that's how they felt I would leave now, and he responded, \"That's exactly how we feel.\" I was shocked, and still am. I have never, NEVER been treated so disrespectfully in a place of business. And I'm a regular, paying customer!! I always leave a tip! I still can't believe I was treated this way.\n\nI will no longer recommend this place, now that they've shown their true colors.

I was expecting much better, even from a breakfast-all-day diner, because I've raved over similar diners in other review (see: CJ's in Seattle and Izzy & Nat's in Battery Park). However, no. I have no interest in darkening the door of this diner again.\n\nI rate diners based on how they deliver on four menu items: their hash, biscuits and gravy, country fried steak, and pancakes. I wasn't able to try Merry-Ann's hotcakes or their steak, so I'm just rating my experience on the hash and biscuits and gravy.\n\nMerry-Ann's is a cute, Illini-paraphanalia-ed (is that a word?) diner with overly hovering waitresses and bad orange juice. The booths are teeny and sticky, with an assortment of dairy-free creamer and jam stacked haphazardly on one end. Interesting. But ick. Their $3 orange juice is pulp-less, watered down concentrate.\n\nTheir hash is AMAZING. It's the reason why I'm giving Merry-Ann's its single star. Crispy yet soft, I could've had platters of this thing. Dripping in ketchup or on its own or mixed with the diner's pepper gravy, oooh the hash is heaven.\n\nBiscuits and gravy. Oh gosh. What went wrong? I appreciate the full-size serving, but the biscuits were soggy and the gravy.... I am a fan of sausage gravy in general (I don't discriminate), and I have no qualms of venturing out into the pepper gravy arena, but gravy in general should be thick and flavorful and not congeal and as awesome as it could be. Merry-Ann's does not know how to make a good gravy. It was flavorless and milky and the only reason I even ate it was because I mixed it with the aforementioned fabulous hash browns.\n\nSigh.

I would have to say that the wait staff is top notch. Very attentive friendly and helpful! This is a classic nostalgic diner where the server comes right to the side of your table to take your order. The menu itself is quite limited to basic breakfast items such as eggs, hash browns, sausage, burgers, sandwiches, and salad. I went with the house specialty dish the diner stack that has (hash Browns topped with cheese, hamburger or sausage patties, two eggs, and then smothered with delicious sausage gravy) I missed the part of the menu where it said smothered... The dish had so much gravy on it that you could not make out the food underneath. The hashbrown were oily, no real crispy to it. The sausage and eggs were good without complaint. Overall with the oil and salt, it was somewhat difficult to eat. I think if they changed some of the options to other more contemporary diner foods they maybe better off. I had high expectations, but the food just as other reviewers wrote falls flat.\n\nPros: friendly service, clean\n\nCons: the food really is below par, salty and very greasy not in a good diner kind of way\n\nHidden deals:\nMonday to Friday 6 am to 11 am\n2 eggs, 2 pancakes, 2 ham for 3.99\nHam omelet 3.99\n\nAll day specials Mon-Thurs\nSuper burger 4.40\nGrilled ham and cheese 4.00", "business_id": "vBg5V39Vf4eTx1JVgl_5Pg", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-01-18", "type": "review"}

I have been hearing about Sam's breakfast, in particular the french toast, for months now.  I love french toast, it is my favorite breakfast food.  I wasn't expecting much, thinking that it was sure to be less fantastic than my boyfriend claimed it to be.\n\nSam's is the epitome of a greasy spoon.   No frills decor, you walk through the kitchen to get to the bathroom and your table is likely to be wobbly.  The server took care of us but was busy with other tables so the service was polite and attentive but short and sweet.  We each ordered a breakfast special and then split an order of french toast.  The breakfast special items (eggs, meat, toast, hashbrowns) were basic but good.  The french toast?  Ridiculous.  Seriously, the best french toast I've ever had.  The cook dips the bread in thinned out pancake batter and then fries it up.  It is rich, crispy and seasoned with powdered sugar and cinnamon.  It was a tasty breakfast on a cold, rainy day.  When the Illini basketball team walked in the door, my boyfriend was in heaven.  \n\nAt the end of the meal we realized that we didn't have any cash and Sam's doesn't take cards.  Because my boyfriend was a regular in his college days, Gus, the owner, was nice enough to let us leave, get some cash and come back to pay.  Our total was about as pleasing as the french toast.  12 bucks and change for two coffees, two specials and french toast.  Crazy cheap.

Coffee was decent.  Ordered the Western Omelet.  Huge.  To their credit, it was filled with slices of bacon instead of just pieces, slices of ham instead of diced pieces, and large pieces of sausage patties.  That having been said, the vegetables were soggy and the entire omelet lacked seasoning of any kind.  Totally bland.  The American Fries were a soggy mess and also without flavor.  Had to have at least a half order of their much ballyhooed French Toast after reading the rave reviews here.  Blah!!  Did these reviewers eat the same stuff as I did?  There was nothing remotely commendable about it.  It was soggy and relatively flavorless.  I tried it with and without syrup.  The syrup at least gave it flavor, albeit that of low grade imitation maple syrup.  It's been a while since I left that much food on my plate.

It just seems every time I go, something isn't right. It's not a bad place: It has a charming, homey atmosphere, the staff is always pleasant (if a bit distant), and the food comes reasonably quickly. \nBut that's where the aforementioned not-right-ness comes in: the food is just not great. I haven't tried everything, but it feels like they're cutting corners and doing it in all the wrong places. So on Saturday I ordered the La Petit French toast. I am guessing the 'petit' part refers to the amount of eggs and heat used in making the dish. In my cookbook, 'toast' should definitely have a bit of crisp to it, and French toast involves the use of eggs. This was more like 'heated bread'. I will cop to liking my french toast on the eggy side, but I could not honestly tell whether they used eggs or not. These reminded me of pancakes at IHOP: bland tasting black holes for syrup. \nAnother reviewer said LP is like Pancake House only more expensive. Have to disagree with that: I have never had a meal I didn't love at OPH, and Cracker Barrel is soul food for this honky.

A few highlights among the tapas that I tried: the spicy shrimp in chile-lime sauce are delicious, as are the anchovies (if you like anchovies, that is), and the scallops. They also usually have a bunch specials, which I would recommend trying. \n\nNot to forget, they have an extensive wine list (including a pretty good selection of wine by the glass), and a full bar. The drinks are particularly cheap (at least compared to NYC prices that I am used to), and I'm always amazed at how low the bill is in the end: you can have a really nice meal with alcohol for $40 to $50, which is a pretty good deal considering the quality of the food.

The Pork Tacos were my least favorite as there was too much green onion for my liking.\n\nThe food was good but each dish was made for two people rather than four.

The crab tart, on the other hand, was a clunker, as were the beignets. The tart was made of corn bread and I don't know that I've ever had a more dried out piece of corn bread in my life. It totally overshadowed the crab. The beignets were huge, which meant they weren't cooked through. They were like eating a heavy cake doughnut, not the light crunchy wonder they should be.

The decor was not as quaint as I was hoping, more like old grandma grunts than chabby chic and garden like. Country not Victorian. Anyway, it was the experience we were looking for, and my wife had been here before. \nWell, we started off with a brand new waitress, nice girl, but zip on the training, than a girl with three months experience came out, again, no training. Both of these girls would seem happier in a less than Victorian life. We asked about teas and blends, but had no assistance. They only offered a couple and you had to share the pot! What is the deal with that - for $19 bucks a pop I wanted my own pot of earl grey while my wife sipped on apricot! \nWell, one waitress was quitting that day and decided to slam her boss over and over again to us, we were about to leave when the owner came out - we said it was not the experience we were looking for, she apologized and the service got slightly better. Where were the tea cups - we had punch glasses and cracked porcelain with stains. No plates at first, the tea was nothing to write home about. \nMy daughters tea was ok, the cookie was boring, artless and lacking in any frosting or style. The finger sandwiches were pretty good - not quite British, more like deli style, but tasty. The scones a bit dry and the jam, maybe WalMart strawberry.  The worst was the dessert. COSTCO SPECIAL!

Yup that is what I said while attending a friends bubbly party. For some reason all that champagne had me craving pancakes.

I just had some plain ole pancakes with eggs, hash browns and bacon. None of those fancy pancakes, just plain ole buttermilk pancakes lol. My only disappointed was the bacon. Don't get me wrong, it was extra crispy like I had requested but they were the two smallest pieces of bacon I have ever seen. I had to eat them slowly so that I could bask in the yummy flavor that is extra crispy bacon. Oh and the pancakes, YUMMY! They were big and fluffy, just the way I like them.\n\n\nAll in all, not to shabby for a late Saturday night. Especially since all I wanted was pancakes. I was a tad bit colder in there than I would have liked, and it seems as I was not the only one who thought so because quite a few people had to put their jackets or coats back on to eat.

I don't think it's nearly as organized, friendly or tasty as Panera, although the price is much better at Paradise.\n\nParadise Bakery is disappointing in a few ways. First, I really really hate when places just have pictures of sandwiches on the display board and provide absolutely zero written description. Oh, I see I'm just supposed to guess what is on that sandwich that has a picture in the most inconvenient spot in the whole freaking place. Wonderful. Second, the caesar salad is horrible. I took my first bite yesterday and instantly remembered why I swore I would never order another one from Paradise again. I managed to choke most of it down, but seriously what is wrong with their caesar dressing??? It has a very funny, and not in a good way, taste to it. Also the croutons are not very tasty either. Third, they completely use too much dressing on their salads. Excuse me, but can I have some lettuce to go with that dressing?? And finally, for a bakery, I don't particularly find the cookies and pastries I have tried to be all that amazing. The chocolate/white chocolate chip cookie I tried yesterday was a bit on the dry side and not very chewy/soft at all. Boo.\n\nThe two bright spots are 1) the price...my salad and medium drink was $6.23 which isn't a bad deal at all and 2)the number of tables outside this location where you can escape the office to enjoy a nice, leisurely lunch on a beautiful Arizona day.

Sounds crazy but once I get it in my head I wont be satisfied until I give into my cravings. I wasn't hungry though for just any corned beef, it had to be Boar's Head brand, aside from a few grocery stores the only place you can get Boar's Head is a good delicatessen. I knew just where to go, Scott's!\n\nSituated between an Ace Hardware and a Basha's, this seems hardly the spot for a tasty sandwich. Let me tell you, they serve up massive tasty sandwiches with thick piled meat on your choice of bread and they have choices. Feeling helpless and at complete mercy to my urges I ordered Scott's Perfect Reuben-Reuben ($11.50). So tall you cant get your mouth around it, its stuffed with corned beef, swiss cheese and sauerkraut then grilled to a crispy buttery goodness.\n\nWhen the server set my sandwich in front of me my eyes widened, it was a thing of beauty and desire. As I managed my sandwich for the first bite, I felt the wafts of hot corned beef beckoning, eat me, eat me. Enjoying bite after satisfying bite, my morning craving was quickly becoming fulfilled like an ancient prophecy. Ordering a side of Russian dressing to dunk my fries into may sound slightly odd but after one dip I think you'll agree, its perfectly natural.\n\nFor the health conscious who are rolling their eyes at my delicious choices, Scott's does offer lighter fare such as salads, soup and half sandwiches.

The owners are the same but the guy behind the counter who used to be friendly and Hamish just sat there like a schlub.

I ordered my sandwich sadly assuming that my regular hot pastrami would be (a) HOT and (b) on Karsh's rye since Karsh's is right next door. Neither was the case when my sandwich arrived and the pastrami was not delicious and I asked the waitress if I was mistakenly given the \"lean\" type of pastrami and she said I was not.

The restaurant was filthy. The temperature was hot and sticky despite having the the door open (it was about 72 in phoenix today.)\n\nThe booths had exposed cushioning, tables hadn't been cleared or cleaned and the floor looked like something that belonged in an episode of kitchen nightmares. Ignoring these details was a poor choice on my part. \n\nMy friend and I finally found a clean-ish booth and sat down. Our table was dirty, and when the waitress came by I had to ask her to wipe it off even though there were visible crumbs and our menus were sticky. She acted like it had never occurred to her to clean a table off before. She actually tilted her head when I asked her to do so, as if she had been confused by the request. We should have just left. \n\nWe ordered our food. I got a pathetic bowl of matzo ball soup, my friend a sad looking chicken noodle. I had one very tiny measly looking matzo ball, and the veggies had been cooked to death. There were chicken bones in my soup. The flavor tasted like it had been seasoned with a generic version of Stouffer's dressing mix. \n\nI ordered a lean pastrami and asked for it to go. It came to our table without fries  accompanied by the saddest, wilted coleslaw. It was not prepared to go. The pastrami was fatty (despite the menu bragging about how they don't charge extra for lean) The pickles were great, and house made. The pickles were the only bright spot of the meal. \n\nMy friend asked if they had soda by the bottle, the waitress forgot that they carried Dr Brown's (a deli staple) and I had to jog her memory.

It's like a specialty food shop/knick knack/coffe shop with a deli and a patio with live music wine bar.\n\nI got the D.A.M sandwich and macaroni salad. The sandwich was delicious. Pullpork in a not super sticky, more savory, bbq sauce, cole slaw on top on an onion roll. This place can definitely do pulled pork correctly, it was a tiny bit dry, but still great flavor and piled high. The macaroni salad was whatever. A lil too mayonaisey and not much flavor. I should have tried the pasta salad or one of the other variety of sides in the refridgerated section. You can also get kettle chips. They have fountain soda or bottled or glass/bottle wine available. Pricing seemed fair. Mine was 8 or 9 bucks for a 4oz side and a sandwich. \n\nMy cousin got the ham w/ spinach and some kind of mayo. She said it was good.

As literally one of my favorite places in town one would think it would be at the top of my to do list. Maybe it is my secret desire to keep it a secret, as best as I can, so that it does not turn into a zoo everyday and I can't get my yummy sammies. \n\nIt is also extremely surprising to me that some have gone to lengths of posting a negative review of The Duck. It seems that in those cases they are wanting The Duck to be something it's clearly not; a mainstream-mass production-delivary running-squeeky clean-just-like-every-there kinda place. If that's what you are looking for then I would suggest going to AJ's, they might be a better fit for you.\n\nDuck and Decanter has been around for longer than I have been around. They have won award after award for the best sandwich in town. I am surprised Kanye hasn't busted in on a subway commercial and told Jared that he would let him finish, but Duck and Decanter has the best stuff EVER! It has a homey feel, that makes you almost say (as Jeff L. put it) \"Am I still in Phoenix?\" \n\nThey have daily soups and special sandwiches. Their cheese is out of this world, the best provolone I have ever had for sure. They slice all their meat in house and very thin, perfect! I would tell you what sammy is my favorite, but that list would go on way too long. Turkey on a croissant, bree with roasted red peppers and prosciutto, garlic chicken salad, BLT.... \n\nThe Duck is the perfect spot to have lunch out on the patio on a sunny Saturday or Sunday. They have a musician playing music most of the time and sometimes even have cute little farmers markets and art fests. It is perfectly tucked back in the shopping center with Sports Authority shielding you from the hustle and bustle. There is a fun grass area for pets and children to run around on. They also have some great knickknack shopping available to pa-ruse while you wait for your food. They have all kinds of coffee, tea, dishware, cookware, marinades, candy, drinks, wind chimes, magnets, jewelry, specialty gifts, and so on and so on. You can also call ahead and reorder to avoid the sometimes very long line. \n\nHave fun!", "business_id": "HIiVx2mseVWKtx8TKfWC_A", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-02-15", "type": "review"}

Side options, so many to choose from and not just the normal potato salad or pasta salad. They have those too, but sides like cottage cheese with herbs, southwestern salad, egg salad and more\n\n4. Bread, meat, spreads and cheese selections too - I haven't tried all of them, but they all look delicious\n\n5. The gift store... I'm always looking for a place to bring out of town visitors and this will be one of them. Its an airy building with cute items and some would be useful around the house too\n\n6. All of the seating options, upstairs, downstairs, in the wine bar area, outside with live music, even midway on the stairs\n\n7. Friendly service from the people taking our food order to the bartender taking our drinks\n\n8. Live music in the courtyard area, such peaceful music that is not blaring loud. I can hear myself talk and enjoy the music too\n\n9. That its next to Copenhagen Furniture. Yeah... most wouldn't care, but give me a break, I'm looking for furniture.\n\n10. Half size options. I still take half of my meal home, but at least I'm not eating multiple meals of it.  \n\nI haven't tried the coffee or their breakfast, but I'm sure its good too.

It was a place where we got to spend time together and bond, which was rare because as an  OB/GYN, my dad was frequently on call and at work. \n\nI was pleased to recently find out that after all of these years, Duck and Decanter has not lost its honey feel, warm ambiance, and quality of their food. \n\nThis June, I took my dad there for Father's Day lunch. The sandwiches were as good as I remember. Nothing extravagant or peculiar, just classic sandwiches. Fresh breads, crispy lettuce, vine ripened tomatoes (among other things) and yummy mayonnaise. Not to mention their meat is very high quality and fresh-- all still at the amazing quality I remember as a young girl- fantastic. \n\nThe staff is nice, helpful and super friendly. They give the place a warm feel to it. \n\nWhile you're there, make sure to shop around a bit, as they do have quite a few little trinkets and specialty food items like hot sauces, chocolates, and jams. All of their items are fairly moderately priced as well. \n\nTo eat, you can either go upstairs to their loft area, sit on their tucked away yet lively patio, or in the lobby area of the restaurant.

Lush grass, big and plenty deciduous trees to provide plenty of shade and make that cool sound when a breeze comes through. It is very simple and tranquil to dine at.

After showing them around town on Sunday, Dec. 29th we were all hungry around 1pm. With the numerous dining options in Central Phoenix we decided to go to the Duck and Decanter on E. Camelback.  Friends in town have been raving about that place for years and now this was our opportunity to try it and show our friends a good time.  We arrived last Sunday a little after 1pm.  Outside was very busy but managed to find a an empty table for the four of us.  I decided to wait at the table to save it as it was the last one available. The others went inside to place our orders. My first impression was. Not good. There was no landscaping, vegetation or flowers. Felt like we were sitting on a concrete slab in the shopping center parking lot.  Also looked a bit trashy with several dirty tables left unattended. Ambiance a big Zero.  After about 25 mins of waiting outside at the table the rest of my party came out with brown paper bags and drink cups.  In that amount of time we could of had a fabulous sit down and served lunch at one of the many great caf\u00e9s in the neighborhood. They said it was busy ordering the food and only two persons working behind the line taking orders.  On a busy Sunday afternoon this is unacceptable. I ordered a BLT on sourdough bread with a side of coleslaw.  For almost $8.00 per sandwich they could afford to be a little less chinsy with them. The sourdough bread was just cheap white bread that you can buy at the grocery for 99 cents per loaf.  There were exactly 2 slices of over cooked bacon with a piece of brown wilted lettuce on mayo.  The only ingredient they were generous with was the whole tomato that was sliced and piled on the sandwich to make it appear that it was a heartier sandwich.  I didn't order a big fat tomato and mayo sandwich. Shame on you Duck and Decenter.  My side of coleslaw was practically inedible.  Coleslaw swimming in watered down slaw sauce (more like mayonnaise and warm milk) was not at all tasty.  Another person in my party ordered an over priced spinach salad with barely any spinach.  She never told them when ordering yo hold the spinach. Really people!!!! Also she had to wait another 25 mins to get her ice tea because she was told that they had run out. Couldn't they have told her when she ordered it and let her make a different drink choice.  While eating our less than acceptable meal a man was playing the guitar and singing.  He sounded okay but his volume was way way to loud. We literally could not even coo in ate with each other being at least 50 feet away from him.  This total experience at the Duck and Decanter left a bitter taste in my mouth and not just from the awful food. We will never be back.  They can keep their lousy service, inedible over priced food and \"cluck it\".", "business_id": "HIiVx2mseVWKtx8TKfWC_A", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-01-05", "type": "review"}

I've literally seen people playing board games in one of the nooks. This place has expansive space which allows customers to branch out across the two stories.  You'll see that it's almost treehouse-esque. There's wood everywhere and you walk up and down rickety stairs to get to the upstairs loft/patio. They have a lovely outdoor seating area and again, the space for focus and meetings is unparalleled. I typically spend about 5+ hours here when I come and I see the morning flow (pretty slow and tranquil) then I see the lunch rush. Sure, it gets busy, but I bring my headphones which gets me through that period of crowdedness. The staff doesn't hover around you or make you feel unwelcome when you spend a lot of time there, which I certainly appreciate. They are actually very friendly and helpful.\n\nThe place is quite old and could possibly use some updates (computer outlets, tables and chairs, etc). However, I kinda like the shabbiness of it. \n\nPrices are typical for lunch/coffee. The first time I tried this spot, my dirty chai was eh. It was luke-warm and just not very good.

There was a fixed prix fixe menu offered that evening featuring 4 courses plus 2 chefs tastings, not all of which rendered such a renowned valley establishment with a 5 star reputation worthy of such accolades. But that being said the grounds are quite beautiful - romantic, quaint, offers seating not clustered, and impeccably maintained all while taking in frank loyd wright's protege's keen eye for architectural design. \n\nBut back to the food. \n1st chef tasting - pacific oysters garnished with a creme fresche, diced greens and tomato. The combination yielded a nice light crisp finish, garnishing a no brainier as the oyster varietal naturally has cucumber overtones.\n1st course - lobster bisque - It's some of the best lobster bisque I've had on the west coast. Creamy decadent full of that lobster flavor extracted to the broth augmented by a good amount actual lobster meat from the body. \n2nd course - foie tourchon - think foie gras laid on a bed of fig macadamia pomegranate seeds with a touch of balsamic. The liver content of foie gras seemed watered down. Maybe dumbed down a little for the prix fixe menu. That being said the quality of the ingredients completed each other quite well in this dish. \n3rd course - filet with crab - It was served to the table luke warm. It was cooler than buffet food sitting for hours waiting for someone to consume it. Seemed like a nice char on the outside cooked to order in the center. Asparagus was tasty as were mashed potatoes. Bernaise was unexceptional. \n2nd chef tasting - apple cotton candy. Haven't had cotton candy in years! It was light sweet hint of apple and cleared the palate nicely. \n4th course - chocolate souffl\u00e9 - Wrights makes some of the best souffl\u00e9s in town.

The smooth, slightly tangy sauce, blending delightfully with the dish, is addictive! As for ambience, I've been to many extravagant brunches in my day, but none can compare with the setting of the mansion. The beauty and history of the home is so inspiring. It grabs you as soon as you catch sight of the building, sitting so majestically on the hill. And from inside, the panoramic views of the Valley are breathtaking.

Well, the good things... hostess was pleasant and knowledgeable about the property and we took a self-guided tour.  Views were pretty.  Once we were seated it went downhill.  \n\nMenu was fixed for the Groupon, so no items from the website menu were available.  Basically one could choose the entr\u00e9e, but when my husband chose the Halibut, oops, no halibut tonight, salmon only.  I wanted the Roulade of Beef... when it arrived it was flat, grilled... not rolled, and tough as nails.  (I took it home, diced it for a taco the next day).  \n\nOh, yes there were two forgettable \"courses\":  the amuse was a tablespoon of, guess what, Halibut cevice!  (I swear on a my Mother's grave, not even a full tablespoon, but it was served in a Chinese soup spoon so at the least it was easy to eat all of it and not have to chase the tiny morsels around on the plate.  one bite) Then the soup...a clam soup with the clams still in the shell...in bowls that were chipped and cracked.  When we brought it to the waiters attention he just frowned and mumbled that he would mention it...and then a manager type person showed up and told us \"we like the rustic look of the chipped bowls\"  to which my husband asked, attempting to mask his incredulity \"so you actually buy them chipped for the AMBIANCE of chipped dishes?\"  The manager shrugged and walked away.  There was no side dish for the shells so we tried to balance them on the tiny dish below the bowl with little success.    \n\nWe decided to order dessert, which was not included in the Groupon.  (Coffee was never offered or suggested)   Carrot Cake.  One can \"assume\" that it is difficult to mess up a slice of carrot cake.  One can be in error on this too.  After about 20 minutes we were able to find our waiter and ask, jokingly, if they were baking it fresh for us.  He snipped at us that in fact it was being made fresh... that was how they did it.  I would have preferred this information sooner as we were really ready to leave this overpriced, snobby, horrid dining room that played bone jangling \"modern\" jazz too loud to converse over which luckily was interspersed with occasional softer music.  \n\nWell the long awaited \"carrot cake\" arrived in a small ramekin... I will attempt to describe:  a treacly brown sugar slush was the first layer, about  1/2 inch thick.  I think it was supposed to be akin to a cr\u00e8me Brule with a torched crust, but the torch was probably out of gas so the crust was missing.  Then below that was another smooshy, slightly carroty (I know I am making up words here) very wet cake like smash of.... I can't find a word or even make one up for this.  \n\nThe waiter stated \"the dessert is on us\", gave us the bill (wine was $12 per glass), where the dessert was clearly charged at $7.  Paid the bill, paid to get our car out of valet hock and headed home, laughing at the long anticipated special anniversary celebration dinner I planned for my husband who had never been to the Wrigley Mansion.

Unless you like walking up steep driveways I suggest driving to the top and use the valet parking. Now the food. My wife and I ended up choosing the same items. The seafood cake which reminds you of a crab cake had lobster and crab, was deep fried, tender and moist and was dressed in two sauces that complimented it well as did the veggie garnish. We both had the lemon and spinach soup with risotto. The soup was excellent. Finally, we both had the Three Fish Neopaliton  with another version of risotto and veggies. It too was wonderful. We both had a glass of Seven Daughters Muscat which paired nicely with the fish. For dessert we shared a Chocolate and Blackberry Souffle that was truly a surprise.

In fact, you could sum up the valleys breakfast nooks as vacant or un found.  There is one beacon of breakfast hope that can be found in the central corridor, and Vincents be thy name.\n\nObviously Vincents is a culinary staple in the valley that is known far and wide and adorned by all.  What is somewhat unknown to valley foodies is that right behind the main Vincents restaurant sits \"Vincents Bistro.\"  What does that mean to the food masses? The best price point in the valley on fine dining in a great setting.  Before you engage the menu, make sure to enjoy the house made croissants and butter, this little treat will get your senses going in the right direction.  \n\nThe menu at the Bistro is not complex(neither is the main dining room), but has staples such as Vincents famous smoked salmon quesedilla($10) and main lobster with handmade basil pasta($14).  The Bistro has a daily prix fixe menu that uses the following methodology. An appetizer of choice, a main entree of choice and dessert.  The price tag is never greater than $20 for the prix fixe and I challenge another restaurant in the valley to beat it.  Choices can range from prime new york steak, to lamb chops to a wonderfully cooked piece of fish.\n\n\nWhat are the cons? Good luck coordinating a take out order with the normal busyness of the operation.  Wait times for pick up can range from forty-five minutes to over an hour.  If you feel like your caught in the middle of a whirlwind circus when picking up your order, don't worry, that's just the normal pace.  \n\nIn 1982 Vincent Guerithault catapulted Arizona into the beginning phases of the culinary elite the other larger metropolis cities were already enjoying.

The waitstaff was not rude but they were not helpful either as we had to constantly remind them to bring items; they took nearly 20 minutes to take our order and you had to ask them for anything extra like water or silverware.  It just seemed like the owner walked into Six lounge and asked some people to be servers; they just seemed as if they had no experience waiting on people. \n\nFurthermore, it's not a \"winecafe.\"  It's just a cafe. The wine part makes it sound trendier than it is. The wine selection is a joke and there are hardly any \"by the glass\" selections. The servers have no clue about wine and if you ask them a few questions, you will see they do a really good job trying to b.s. you but if you have any knowledge about wine like I do, you enjoy the spectacle of seeing them trying to sound intelligent: \"Er, do you like white or red wine\" \n\nThe food was good but again, why am I paying a lot of money to be served this for dinner.

The $20 Bruschetta Board and Bottle of Wine promotion they have Mondays and Tuesdays is a ridiculous steal. I didn't want to be the alcey to ask if that deal was limited to one-per-table as I was fully planning on consuming my own bottle of wine and possibly my own board of bruschetta. Luckily the guys across the bar had the same plan, so I didn't have to. FYI: It is illegal for restaurants to serve you your own bottle of wine. Don't ask how I know. I just know. However, you can split 3 or 4 with one other person and nobody says anything. Don't ask how I know this either. I just know. \n\nAll of the different bruschetta options are fantastic. The Prosciutto one tasted like Cinnamon Toast to me. That may have been the booze talking. Considering I kept referring to it as \"Cinnamon Toast Crunch\", I'm going to go ahead and say it was. The roasted red pepper & goat cheese and the apple & brie were equally delicious. Sorry, I don't have a breakfast cereal comparison for them. \n\nTo top it off, the service is fan-freaking-tastic. Everyone is extremely helpful and seems genuinely HAPPY  that you are there spending money. Clearly, from a business standpoint, this should be a given, but more often than not it isn't.

The retail wine area at the entrance is awkward to me, because it's cramped and I frankly think you should all be buying wine at my shop so perhaps I'm a touch biased.

Perfect mix of smooth with a kick that's not too bitey or intense. \n\nThe bruschetta came in generous portions of 4x4, 4 slices of 4 different selections, the perfect amount of food to complement half a bottle of wine. Each was amazing but the gold medal goes to the White Bean and Chopped Tomato. The savory, sweet and tangy flavors will make your tastebuds dance for joy. \n\nTIP: avoid the crowd by arriving before 6:30 or after 8:30. Our 7:00 arrival left us waiting 40 min for a table but my 4 stars says it was well worth it!", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-01-08", "type": "review"}

Lucky me :) I had been to this location one other time, but I wasn't there very long and I forgot what I ate. SO, i was really looking forward to this trip. Plus, Amber W was kind enough to give me a gift card for Christmas. Thanks Amber! \n\nThe parking here is sort of on the ridiculous side because the lot is so small. You have to valet your vehicle. I think it was $3. It was busy when we arrived and were quoted about 25 minutes. So we went over to the waiting area to start with some wine. We didn't even have a chance to order because our table was ready already. We were seated outside and I feared for my date's life because it was a little chilly and I don't think the dress she was wearing was really made for winter nights. Thankfully there was a heater planted right behind her. \n\nOur server took our drink orders promptly. I had the Tierra de Luna Malbec. Very good. She had a Reisling, which was very sweet and fruity. Started with the bruschetta and holy schnikes! I could have eaten this all night. We opted for the Smoked Salmon with capers and Pesto, the Tomato, Basil, & Mozzarella, the Ricotta with pistachios and dates, and the Brie with apples and fig spread. All of them were amazing! I am not a salmon fan, but this smoked salmon was delicious! It was also my first attempt at Brie. This too was good. \n\nFor the meal, my lady friend or special lady, (Big Lebowski random quote) had the Raspberry Chicken salad. It was chunky chicken salad on a bed of greens with a raspberry vinaigrette. I was told it was good. I went for the half panini and soup combo. I had the Vegetarian with the Tomato and Gorgonzola soup. Originally the wrong panini came out. The server got it replaced and put the wrong one in a to go box to take home. Thought that was nice for the mix up. The soup was excellent. It is a very close second to The Roosevelt's tomato soup. The Vegetarian panini was good, but could have used a little more veggies on it. \n\nUnfortunately there was no room for dessert, but they all sounded amazing. Overall, a great experience with great food and drink. Service was great and the atmosphere was perfect. \n\nAgain, thanks Amber W for the gift!!!", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-01-10", "type": "review"}

What's that? I can start my bottle now and easily move with my meal and my server once my table is ready? And you say that I can do this on Monday and AGAIN on Tuesday, starting at 8pm? Every week? Can this be true?  Thank you, Postino, for having the best wine and food deal in the valley, and creating a great atmosphere in which to enjoy wine with friends. \n\nI love wine. So do lots of other people that show up at 8pm sharp, rain or shine, to take advantage of the awesome Monday/Tuesday special. So be prepared to wait for a seat. If you are sharp like a hawk or stealthy like a fox, you might catch one of those coveted bar seats, but otherwise you'll stand at small tables, casually drinking your wine and doing some people watching until the host finds you and guides you to your table. You will love your wine selection. Your bruschetta will be made with the the freshest ingredients on crusty MJ bread, in the perfect proportions. Do try my favorites: Prosciutto, mascarpone, & fig; Red peppers & goat cheese; Ricotta with pistachio & dates; and Pesto with smoked salmon. Happiness served on a wood-cutting board. I paired my bruschetta with a spicy corn chowder, and it was just the best meal for a rainy night. \n\nThe servers are very cool and know what they are talking about. They will not steer you wrong with a wine selection. If you order a bottle that is not to your liking, no problem! They serve all wine by the glass, so you can easily send it back and try another! They want you to enjoy your experience and selection, and thus have built in the flexibility for people to take risks and try new wines. Have fun with it! \n\nMy suggestion is to find a friend or two, valet the car, put your name in for a table, get started on a bottle, make laughter and conversation, and finally take your seats, enjoy your food, and order more wine. You will be fully satisfied and will have had a great night. Do recommend it to your other friends, and definitely make plans to return again soon.", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-01-24", "type": "review"}

I make this sound horrible but it isn't at all, I was just being dramatic.

One plus: no bees inside.  \n\nMy friend and I decided we would day drink (why not? it is the weekend) so she ordered a mimosa and I a Bellini.  Fresh juice paired with champagne (sparkling wine, prosecco, cava, bubbly, whatever) = delicious.  AND all glasses of wine and beer are only $5 from 11:00am - 5:00pm.  Thank you, may I have another?\n\nAfter our second adult beverage we ordered olives and brushetta.  Both were delicious and perfect for a light lunch.

I've been in for lunch, which is a bit of a different vibe than after dark. I think the service is better at lunch, probably because they are less busy. Either way, the wine selection and food are great. I agree with other reviewers that the $20, Monday & Tuesday nights, after 8pm deal is awesome! You get 4 bruschetta & and a bottle of wine for only $20! The vibe of this place at night is neat. It's dark, & dimly lite with tea light candles. There are a few comfortable sofas, high top tables, regular tables, and a great patio outside. It has a very intimate feel and would be a great place for a date. It does get very busy & crowded in the evening so keep that in mind. There is usually a wait on Mondays & Tuesdays after 8pm. Service gets a little slow during their busy times. My favorite bruschetta is Brie & Apples with Fig Spread. It is very sweet! If you're desiring a salad the Raspberry Chicken salad is great. Very flavorful! I also really like the Turkey Panini, very tasty! The only bad thing I can say about this place is the parking is awful! More often than not, you'll end up having to valet your car because there is very little parking.", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-12-12", "type": "review"}

Hence, I tried to make reservations here, called 24 hours in advance... they told mebthey couldnt do it, but  to come in anyway and 'wait at the bar' for a table. I told them I was going to be with some older people, and asked if there was anyway we could just call in 20 minutes beforehand and put our name on the list, so my grandparents wouldnt have to stand at the bar. They said they didnt do that. Seeing as it THE EXACT SAME THING as coming in to put my name on the list and wait twenty minutes there, I dont see the problem. I asked them politely if they could make an exception considering the situation... they said absolutely not. Where I come from, restaurants will try everything they are capable of to accommodate their guests. This IS NOT what Postino's or the LGO owners do at any of their restaurants. After talking to Postino's, I tried Chelsea's and LGO and got the same answer.\n\nI also tried Chelsea's, which takes reservations for less then 10 but got the same story, they were booked and we could wait. Also asked them about calling in when we were on our way b/c I was with two older people who could not stand long... they said no way.\n\nI own two restaurants, I can tell you-- this is not appropriate customer service. Its also not very moralistic. If a frequent customer explains a situation, seeking a little help, and its not ridiculous, the restaurant shoud be happy to do it. \n\nSeems as if the LGO owners have taken a cue from Houston's... which is the type of place that gives Scottsdale a bad reputation. The type of service that scares out-of-towners away from Arizona because we are too \"snooty.\"", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-12-17", "type": "review"}

Honestly, I don't think you can really go wrong with any of their bruschettas.  We have tasted the fresh mozzarella with tomato and basil, prosciutto with figs and marscapone, smoked salmon with pesto, ricotta with dates and pisachios, roasted red peppers with goat cheese, and the warm artichoke spread - all wonderfully fresh, mouth watering, and plenty of toppings so you can experience the full flavor of the offerings.\n\nPeople watching is fun at this location if you're into a varying crowd.

The panini was scrumptious! It was perfectly prepared, and tasted amazing ... I wish I had ordered the full sandwich! The soup was just OK - it wasn't bad, but it was nowhere near as exciting for my tastebuds as the panini. \n\nI would liken my dining experience at Postino to \"If You Give a Mouse a Cookie\" -- after I had one phenomenal item, I had to have them all! After polishing off a bold and zesty Syrah from California, I ended up leaving with a bottle of the Reunion Malbec from Mendoza, Argentina.

Their salted caramel desert sunday is totally worth leaving room for!  This is a great place for a get together with friends or an intimate date night.

Our server was a knowledgeable and energetic gentleman that gladly helped out in any decision making regarding the menu. I tried their beer selection as well as had a cheese tray. Note: For being a wine place, they sure do take pride in their beer selection - however I must say that I was not impressed by their cheese. They seem to take pride in their cheese diversity, but I was simply not impressed.\n\nThe service was great, the ambiance was relaxing, and the patrons were nice.. I truly enjoyed my visit and will be returning to this establishment. It wasn't expensive, but it isn't cheap nor should it be.

Expect an extremely long wait if you get there after 8pm\n\nWhat to order (in order of tasty): [Bruschetta] Tomato jam and goat cheese, fig and prosciutto, Apple and brie, pesto and salami, pistachio and date, caprese (lacks balsamic vinegar and olive oil). [Other] Olives.\n\nDon't bother getting: white bean hummus is pretty insipid and the artichoke dip doesn't add much to your meal, nor is on discount during their Monday specials.\n\nBest group number: 2-4 is pretty perfect. Anything more will be hard to accommodate as the space is pretty small.\n\nOverall impression: ridiculously good deal on Monday to share with 4-5 people, paying only $8-10 to get sufficiently tipsy and full.

Whether its the service you get , the food quality, the ambiance or the amazing deals... its all been said. But hell, I will say it all again..\n\n~Fud/Drink~\nI have had bruschetta many times, at many places. They do bruschetta the RIGHT WAY. They give you so many different options to choose from, and each one tastes as good as the next. I am a salmon fan, so their salmon bruschetta was exquisite in my eyes. They have so many amazing wines to offer you as well, so many its almost impossible to not find the right fit for your meal. I have yet to try other main entrees on the menu, but do not worry I will. Just remember, you can taste the quality. They take good care of their product and make sure the kitchen pumps out quality dishes.\n\n~Atmosphere/Service~\nThe Servers really know their stuff. They understand why you're their and they seem to really rock to the vibe of the place. Hipsters love it, I love it, and the servers are awesome at what they do. The suggestions they provide prove to really help make the night a better one. The atmosphere is great, a real hipster vibe for sure. I enjoy a relaxed calm spot personally, especially after a long day at work, and  they nail it. Its just quiet enough to sit down and relax with someone special, yet loud enough that no one can hear your conversation.\n\n~Extras/Rating~\n\nRegarding the $20 Bruschetta/Wine deal: GET-THERE-EARLY. Or else you might find yourself waiting for an hour to get served. I do not fault them for having to put you on a long wait-list, especially because its such an amazing deal and so popular just suck it up and get there earlier or 30 minutes earlier than what you would normally want. Their $20 Bruschetta/Wine pairing is the best happy hour item I have ever seen. No lie. That alone puts them in the upper echelon for date night go-to's and perfect chill happy hour locations in the valley here. \n\n No one can lay claim to such a unique and perfect option, despite the fact that numerous other bars have attempted. They may try, but the quality of food and vast selection of wines, paired with the ambiance they provide, blows all competitors out of the water.

I deducted a star because I find that the selection of other food lacks variety.  For example, they offer many salads that are terribly similar.  Yes, I know there are only so many variations on a salad but these just all blend together and become forgettable.  If you're going for wine and cheese and bruschetta, you won't be disappointed.

It wasn't quite what we expected--we'd assumed it was the kind of Italian place where you could get a glass of wine and a plate of pasta--but we had a great time.\n\nOur reservation was for eight o'clock on a Saturday night, and the place was busy but comfortable. It felt intimate and not too crowded. The lighting was low, and the space was warm and charming. A great go-to date spot. Service was great. Our waitress was friendly and helpful, and we were well taken care of.\n\nPostino is more a wine bar than a full sit-down restaurant, with reasonably priced bottles and a menu that consists of large format antipasti and paninis. We ordered a bottle of Canto Sur, a red blend of mostly cabernet and carmenere. You can get wines by the glass here, but the bottle prices are only three times the glass prices, putting most of the bottles in the high twenties/low thirties range. We were happy with the wine. We also ordered a few antipasti and tried to order paninis for our dinner when our waitress stopped us--she said what we thought were antipastis would fill us up plenty, and she was absolutely right.\n\nGranted, we were planning to order a pretty big spread of appetizers. We shared the butcher's block, the pub board, and a selection of four bruschetta. Did not realize that each of these boards would be gigantic. Everything was delicious. The butcher's block came with plenty of meat--prosciutto, coppa, salami, and peppered salami--along with goat cheese and white bean hummus. There was crostini, of course, and a huge assortment of great accompaniments--olives, dried cranberries, almonds, asparagus, cherry tomatoes, smoked yellow tomatoes, and three kinds of pickle.The pub board brought another huge spread, this one of MJ's soft pretzels, Scrheiner's chorizo, cornichons, aged cheddar, and giant Spanish corn nuts. It was fun to mix and match everything on these boards, and it was all fantastic. The bruschetta seems to be the main draw of Postino, but I didn't understand why until our selection arrived. We opted to order four of them for $14, and were expecting bruschetta sized like bruschetta. These were more like full-on flatbreads, with the four bruschetta adding up to about a pizza in volume. We had the tomato jam and fresh sheep's milk cheese, the salami with pesto, the prosciutto with figs and mascarpone, and the burrata, bacon, arugula, and tomato. Not a dud in the bunch--loved all the meat, and the tangy cheese with the sweet tomato jam was perfect on its own.\n\nWe took great pleasure in our feast of antipasti and wine. We ate with our hands and enjoyed the variety. I'd love to go back to Postino next time I'm in Phoenix.

Food, service, decor, Postino's has everything. I went here with my husband after rock climbing the camel back mountain.  At first this place kind of threw us off. It has a free valet which made us think our dirty hiking gear apparel would get us snubbed, and everything would be super expensive. I'm sure you have gathered based on the five star rating this was not the case. The gold diggers of Scottsdale were in attendance decked out in Lululemon, to class down the dress code. \n\n To the food: We got two plates of bruschetta, and after basically licking the plate clean we got their meat and cheese butcher block plate. All the bruschetta was amazing--super flavorful and used very fresh ingredients.  We also got some wine and a mimosa, fantastic as well. One of our bruschettas was missing an end, the waitress told us that more would be out soon to make up for the missing piece. Soon afterwards, another server brought it with a little extra added, making for no complaints on our end.\n\nI loved the ambiance. Its really cool and classy with lots of character. You can dress up or wear hiking gear. It also has garage doors to hang outside on those warm-weathered days (basically everyday in Scottsdale!). Complete with heater and misters for the summer.

There were a ton of greens and the seafood cakes that came on top of the salad were both flavorful and well-sized. It's a huge pet peeve of mine when the salad protein is such a small portion that you have to carefully meter out enough bites to last through the whole salad.

However, I hadn't been back since, just because it always seemed to slip my mind. That is, until I was reminded of it today by the one and only Gabi M. \n\nRight off the bat, I like Taylor's Cafe because the moment I step inside, I feel warm and cozy. The restaurant isn't very large but it isn't cramped either. It lives up to its name as a cafe! The servers are very friendly and brought my a Diet Coke right away and kept refilling and refilling. Bad for my caffeine addiction, yet good for my caffeine addiction if you catch my drift. \n\nSo moving on to the food. I love tuna, but my waistline doesn't like the mayo that normally goes into the tuna. However, today I learned that Taylor's Cafe can feed my love of tuna without the mayo calories! How? They make the tuna with fat-free mayo! So, I quickly ordered the tuna on a wheat tortilla wrap with avocado and tomato. The tuna was fresh, delicious and didn't taste like fat-free anything!

Everything tasted good though and was a decent size.\n\nI will go back because both breakfast and lunch/dinner are served 24 hours a day and the food is downright CHEAP.

You know who you are. \nThis is about as it good as it gets for the Phoenix area. Everything is homemade and delicious.\n\nThe green corn tamales are absolutely stellar. This beauty comes out wrapped in waxed paper and corn husk to maintain the moisture and heat. It's like unwrapping presents at Christmas time, a pure delight! Top this bad boy with green sauce and dive in to find kernels of corn complemented by the perfect sweetness. The green chile is also superb and highly recommended. \n\nThe staples even stand on their own. Your meal begins with crispy chips fresh out the fryer! Throw a little salt and green sauce on them and enjoy. The consistency and flavor of the beans is just right and they are not offensively overwhelmed with cheese as so many other restaurants. The rice always has great flavor, but can range in moisture from slightly dry to very moist depending on the day (I'm assuming different cooks.) And lastly the flour tortillas. These goodies are concealed by foil to keep them piping hot. Every time I unwrap them I get a little giddy. The smell is just so damn good! There are few things better than flour tortillas with rice and beans. This is just about the best threesome I have ever had. \n\nThe only downside to Azteca is the limited daytime hours, and the large lunch crowds.

It was amazing.  I can't believe this is only 15 minutes from my cookie cutter stucco house.  It's almost hard to believe it's even in Phoenix - though to a native like me, it's just one more reason to remember why Phoenix is so great.  \n\nWhen most folks used to think of South Phoenix they thought of crime, blight and anything else associated with being on the \"wrong\" side of the tracks.  Sure, there may have been areas right next to downtown that were like that, but most of South Phoenix was all farming community.  While some of this still exists - especially near and in Laveen - most of these farm plots were sold off during the years to individuals for their own homes - and any of the large lots were sold off to developers in the last 10-15 years or so.  Most of these became mass produced houses (like mine) or shopping centers.  The Farm is off of 32nd street (with property stretching back almost to 24th street) between Baseline and Southern.   To put this in perspective - there is a huge Target/Fry's/Ross/Applebee's kind of complex at 24th and Baseline - and the South Mountain Community College is just North of that on 24th.  At 32nd and Baseline there is the Raven Golf course, with lots of condos all around it.  That all seems a whole world away once you pull in to The Farm.\n\nI'm attaching some pictures from their web site www.thefarmatsouthmountain.com.  I've been only to one of the restaurants so far - The Farm Kitchen which is their lunch spot.  But I plan to visit Morning Glory soon.  All the stores are amazing - and it's so cool to see where it all grows.  As we walked by the gardens it was great to see some kids (and adults) having the process explained to them of how they grow the food organically here - and it could end up at one of their restaurants, in one of the nicer restaurants in the valley, or sold at their Farmers market to be eaten in their own home.\n\nCheck out their menus online.  Yes - it's a bit pricey.  I was hesitant that I'd think it was \"worth it\".  But oh it was.  I can't explain it any better than stealing from a commercial - You can TASTE the freshness!  Everything just tasted so much better.  Not that the atmosphere didn't help - but it wasn't the only factor.  One interesting thing to mention - pets are ok.  There were two folks there who brought their dogs.  The doggies seemed quite happy to have some run around space (leashed of course) and then a nice meal by a picnic bench.  \n\nI'm planning to go again - bringing lots of friends and family at different times.  I'd love to try out their yoga and/or gardening classes too! This will definitely be on the short list of places a visitor needs to go when visiting from out of town.  Better yet though - it's one of the few places you can go in town and feel like you took a day trip out of the valley.", "business_id": "MLcXtnpzygZvQ9BtseLLlw", "stars": 5, "date": "2006-12-28", "type": "review"}

He seemed like the nicest man and was so happy to pair a person with the perfect loaf.  My fiance didn't get that from watching him, but I could tell.  We went over to buy some bread and he was in fact one of the most genuinely jolly people I've met - and I don't use the word \"jolly\" very often, but it fits him perfectly.  He had us smell the asiago loaf, introduced us to the jalapeno Cheddar, and finally sold us on the rosemary with sea salt.

I had their special that day - a herb roasted chicken sandwich along with some tasty tomato bisque.  Everything tasted very fresh.\n\nHuge area of picnic tables to sit and watch or bring a blanket and sit on the grass.  There is so much to explore with different boutiques, cafes, and shops all over the the lot.  Hope to come back for brunch or breakfast someday.", "business_id": "MLcXtnpzygZvQ9BtseLLlw", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-12-31", "type": "review"}

I've never written a review of the Farm at South Mountain?  I'm not sure how this is even possible!\n\nI go here so often that this might actually be my favorite place in Phoenix to go for a relaxing cool/warm Saturday or Sunday afternoon in PHoenix.  In fact, I think I'm headed there momentarily.\n\nMany people write reviews for the various \"businesses\" at the Farm on South Mountain on the wrong Business/Venue pages.  But I guess this listing is a catch-all for everything.  Let's see if I can help people get this clear.  I really want to point that the Farm at South Mountain has several \"businesses\" and venues listed on Yelp.  You can go here for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  You can have your baby shower here or your 200+ person wedding and reception here.  You can hold a corporate event in \"Stoned Grove\" area around an outdoor pizza oven or you can have an intimate dinner under mature trees with glimmers of stars at night at Quiessence.  This place is a one stop shop for everything simple and beautiful in the out of doors.  I've written reviews for a few of the places on the farm and I will let those reviews speak for themselves.  I've posted pics too... \n\nOne of the things that the Yelping community might appreciate knowing is that you should visit their website for special events.  Sometimes, they have special Farm dinners.  Sometimes there's a special holiday dinner or lunch.  For instance, I know for Valentine weekend, they have Valentine Dinners and Picnic lunches.  \n\nHere are my reviews of places on the farm:\n\nMaya's Farm (At the end of the Farm Drive and directly North.)\nOrganic Certified Farm.  See them at the Farm on Sunday mornings.  Phoenix Public Market on Saturdays and also get on their CSA)-\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/mayas-farm-phoenix#hrid:5dPGtdn4SQIClbJ_uIe1zw\n\nSucculentia (it is in the green house on the north side of the farm, back by Maya's garden House)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/succulentia-phoenix#hrid:Z91CIQ4jVqF9RG3HrRe22w\n\nThe Farm Kitchen \n(Lunch/Brunch and is the closest to the Picnic Tables.  you see it immediately as you enter the farm, north of  \"The Farm Driveway\".)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/the-farm-kitchen-phoenix#hrid:7w3mgerwC9Yqd_b1amkDjA/src:self\n\nMorning Glory \n(Breakfast only, but the patio is a nice place to rent for an event.  Go All the way to the end of the Farm Drive and YOu'll find it.)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/morning-glory-cafe-phoenix#hrid:yzI8RxBsNlKndP1HMQ0Q6A\n\n\nThere are a few other businesses on the Farm listed on Yelp\nWeddings:\n(I am sure there was a wedding listing on Yelp for the FASM because I used to check in to it accidentally when I first started Yelping.  If I find it, I will update)\n\nQuiessence (I haven't written a reveiw of this either.  SMH!!):\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/quiessence-restaurant-phoenix\n\nBotanica (Been here once, but no review)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/botanica-phoenix-3\n\nThis is a great place to visit after you've completed a Hike on South Mountain too.

To start with, the basket advertisement tells you that you get: 2 gourmet sandwiches, 2 sides, tea or lemonade, 1 cupid\"s cupcake to share and a souvenir.   When we called to make our reservation, as suggested, the woman was very short and rude with us.  She wanted to know what sandwiches we wanted, when I told her I would have to look at the menu, which I had pulled up because we just looked at it, she told me to call her back when we knew what we wanted.  Hmmm... knew what we wanted, just had to look at the name again.  Ok, so we call back, get the same \"happy\" lady, she takes our sandwich and drink order, but then tells us that one of the \"sides\" that we selected was not offered, that there were only three sides to choose from.  It would have helped our experience greatly if the web had 1. Told you to select your sandwich prior to calling (and have the name ready so the \"happy\" lady didn't hang up on you), and 2. To list your sides that you could choose from.  \nWrote the ordering off as an employee having a bad day, and decided to make the best of it.  When we showed up at The Farm, had to choose from three lines, there were no signs to direct you, asked people in line and found out that we wanted line two.  When we received our basket and found a place that we wanted to sit, my husband showed me his pasta salad side, there were literally 4 noodles!  It wasn't even half full!  The sandwich was nothing to sing about, it was just a sandwich, DEFINITELY not a gourmet sandwich.  The cupcake was ok, moist but no flavor.  \nThen came our last slap in the face... your souvenir...a $5 coupon to go the their very over priced specialty shop.  Again... Really!?  I shop at specialty shops all the time, and this was a disgrace. The selection was terrible, and looked as if someone who didn't know what they were doing just set things out and WAY over priced them.  Love to support local artist and businesses, but these clearly were not local artist.\nThis entire process left my husband and myself feeling like we were cattle, moving through getting processed... hmmm... it is a farm, I guess.

I went home and ate another meal....\n\nMy friend got a TEENY tiny Greek salad - literally it could have fit in a 1 cup measuring cup (which they don't even serve with Greek dressing by the way... so the only thing that really makes it \"Greek\" is the olives and sprinkles of feta) and it cost like $6, meh.\n\nService: 2 stars\nEven though there was no line behind me, I felt like I was being rushed through.

Of course what does she bring me, a chicken quesadilla. LOL oh yea that's right i forgot to clarify with my server that when i said chicken strips and fries, i really mean chicken strips and fries!

This was the resort that was chosen after a night out. After years of never being taken out for my birthday, this was supposed to be that \"go to\"  food after being taken out for my birthday. 90% disappointment. There appeared to be only two servers working plus one cook. Not enough staffed for a Friday night/Saturday early morning, by far. It took precisely 23 minutes for my group to get served even just water. Granted there were three other big groups that were in the establishment other than hours the moment we walked on (three other groups totalling six or more walked in those twenty minutes we waited for our drinks), so that is the only reason I am providing some leniency. There were countless orders waiting to be served to customers constantly (minimum five plates waiting to be brought out at a time). Everyone's food, once brought out, was cold when delivered. Compared to the last time, the food actually had all of the advertised ingredients. Nonetheless, all cold. My BLT was cold as if it had just come from the refrigerator. The only thing warm on my plate were the three pieces of sausage (only three, really?). This is twice in a row I was severely disappointed with the staff working, and with the level of food quality. For a 25th birthday late night early morning meal, I'd much rather go to another establishment. At least the food is warm and friendly adequate service is provided. This place needs better staffing and management.

Just Kidding! \n\nOh and here's an important tip if you like Mexican food...Don't order Tamales at restaurants or taco shops, if you have had a real tamale made at home.

Alright, back to the original review.)\n\nBeing from San Diego as well, taco shops are hard to like in Phoenix.  This one isn't.  We went there because of Guy Fieri.  But the carnitas is why we go back...4 times since November.  And we live in Queen Creek.  \n\nIt's a taco shop.  Taco shop = street food, not fast food.  Street tacos are small.  Thankfully, so is the price.  $1.25 each.  That means I walk out full with authentic Mexican food cravings satiated for $5.  \n\nMy wife's favorite - carne asada and carnitas tacos.  While the carne asada is good to great, the carnitas is excellent.  Both have the typical onion/cilantro accouterments with red hot sauce added..  The carne asada has tasty guacamole added also.  I'd prefer they leave the sauce off and give me the option.  They have a green sauce also.  Both are delicious.  \n\nThe carnitas burrito is what I want, though.  First time I ordered it I asked for no beans (a burrito with beans is a strike against them) and got a flour tortilla packed with melty, juicy, glorious carnitas meat.  If you're looking for pure, concentrated, braised pork flavor get the burrito sans beans.  \n\nOther notables:  the chili relleno, the sopa (topped with any meat you'd like.  We, of course, tried the carnitas).  I waffled between 4 and 5 stars because of the aforementioned bean faux pas, and their signature burrito, the Bombero, just didn't cut it for us( consider this a 4.5 star review?).

I had seen it on DDD before but have learned that doesn't mean great food.. just.. interesting food. I have no real complaints. The service was quick, the prices were low, the food was decent. The whole experience was just above average. With so many other great places in the valley I an unlikely to make a return visit anytime soon.\n\nOnto the food:\n\nChile Relleno:\nThe sauce was great, the breading held up pretty well. It was slightly undercooked so the pepper was still very stiff. Had to hack away at it with a plastic knife to cut a piece. As usual it was filled with cheese.. and unusually filled with diced potato. This was a new one and I'm not sure what it really added to the dish. Initially I thought maybe just extra filler to cut down on the cheese needed, but there was plenty of cheese. Good but far from the best.\n\nHard Shell Tacos:\nThis place is known for its street tacos. So just stay away from the hardshells. You'll be glad you did.\n\nStreet Tacos:\nCarne Asada:\nThere was a lot of bold seasoning going on here. Street tacos are notoriously two/three bite'ers so I didn't really get to break it apart. If I went back I think I might get a burrito to really get a good amount of the carne. I sometimes worry when things are so obviously heavy seasoned that they may be covering something up.\n\nAl Pastor:\nVery strong citrus flavor. Almost like the marinade was made with fresh juice that had been cooked down and condensed. It was very salty and pretty greasy.\n\nCarnitas:\nNot to bad.. Had a decent flavor but again was a little over salty/greasy.\n\nRice:\nDecent\n\nBeans:\nReally liked these. They were very rich and creamy but still with some whole bean texture. I'm not sure they can taste that good without lard but I suppose its possible. I've never been afraid of lard anyway ;)\n\nCheese Quesadilla:\nFlour tortilla filled with mexican white queso. Was decent but nothing to super special.\n\nGreen Salsa:\nBold, spicy, and very heavy tomatillo flavor.\n\nRed Salsa:\nI liked this one. It was a good combo of smokey, spicy, and a hint of sweetness. The smokiness I'm sure came from a heavy dose of chipotle.", "business_id": "rDvz5jX65gpfONFu7er9Tw", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-12-03", "type": "review"}

The posole was good not as spicy as I like but that was fixed with some Tapatio sauce and then it was great.  \n\nIf you are in the area I recommend this place and I will be back for sure to try the tacos eveyone is raving about in their reviews.", "business_id": "rDvz5jX65gpfONFu7er9Tw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-02-28", "type": "review"}

Their menu is a little hard to read and that might hold up the line, so guys and ladies of Los Taquitos, if you're reading this,  laminated menus at the start of the line might be a nice touch?\n\nCustomer service, once again, wasn't great, but I've lowered my expectations since my last visit.

I almost wanted to thank her for actually smiling but that probably crosses some sort of line between normal and creepy so I kept my mouth shut.\n\nFood, food, food.  My boyfriend got the burrito bowl, which was a little smaller than expected, but still tasted great.  Was expecting beans and rice on the side, but since you already get beans and rice in the bowl, I guess you don't get more (yes, I'm greedy).  I need to read that menu again.  The tamales with beans and rice were good, tamales a little dry and crumbly and needed some reheating by the time I got home (probably takes us 10 minutes to get home).  I am in love with their red salsa though.  It has a little bit of a kick, and everyone needs a little spice in their life.\n\nWord of advice, don't do takeout.

The experience keeps slipping. I don't think we'll be back after our last visit. \n\nFirstly, and most concerning, is they allow open carry in their restaurants. Last weekend we went for breakfast and of course there was a wait, so we sat with our 5 month old in the rocking chairs. Some yahoo with a revolver slung low on his hip sits down across from us and because the muzzle of the gun was so long, when he sat down across from us the barrel became parallel to his thigh, I looked up and was staring directly into the barrel of his gun. It was pointed at my head and my baby's head. He looked a little on the slow side, how do I know if the safety's on or not? I got up and moved. I don't know why Cracker Barrel would want to take on that kind of liability with having loaded guns carried around a family restaurant.\n\nSecondly, they've filled up the front \"store\" section with so much crap you can barely get through. There's always a ton of old people there, with walkers and/or oxygen and it's a hassle. It's hard to wade through with a purse, and it's a double hassle with a baby carrier. You have to gingerly step around stuff, trying not to knock over any of the bric-a-brac. I don't know what kind of revenue per square foot they're getting in that part of the restaurant to continue adding rack after rack but I can't stand it anymore. \n\nThe clutter in the front is annoying and their gun policy is unsafe. Plenty of other breakfast places to go to in the area. Won't be going back anymore.", "business_id": "dGcVT0WGenhh8Np76ta6AA", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-12-15", "type": "review"}

The food was pretty good the service was good as far as I remember and I wanted to go back sometime,  maybe try the lunch menu. \n\nWe went back last night and had a totally different experience. It was late and we did have 2 children with us, the baby who is now 3 months old and her 2 year old brother. We had just been to the Phoenix Children's Museum for their free Friday night sponsored by Target and we were all tired and hungry. We came in here in the hope that we could get something to eat so we wouldn't have to cook when we got home. In fact we picked this place because it is a \"family restaurant\"  and we expected it to be \"kid-friendly\".   Wrong. \n\nThe  little boy was understandably fussy so I appreciate that this was not something fun for the waiter but at the same time when you're in the service industry sometimes you just have to deal with it when things happen like a fussy 2 year old. We did the best we could to keep it under control. I ended up taking him outside twice to soothe and distract him. We ordered his meal first and asked the waiter could he please make sure that got put in while we decided what we wanted to eat and actually the 2 year old was fine once his food arrived (until he'd finished eating his fill). \n\n\nIt took us awhile to order because of the distractions. I ordered a fancy grilled cheese sandwich with bacon, side of onion rings, my daughter got a cheeseburger with french fries, he got some sort of chicken tenders Kids Meal with french fries, which we were all munching on because we were hungry. Because he was tired he started getting antsy again once he was done. I finally convinced my daughter to call the dad and have him come get the child so we could eat in peace. I waited to ask our server for a container to put the rest of the toddler's food in but he never showed up so I chucked the water out of a paper cup and put the food in there. I went up to the manager at the cash register to let him know I was stepping outside just to give the food to the mom and he ignored me and didn't respond, even picked up the phone as if he was making a phone call. Rude! I just didn't want him to think I was skipping out on the bill. \n\nThe bottom line is that the waiter, Lyle, was  not polite to us. He was as cranky as the 2 year old. I understand it was difficult for him but it's his job to be as pleasant as possible to his customers regardless and we certainly weren't doing or saying anything to be rude to him. Obviously we were struggling just to be able to order and to read the menu. He let it be known he was not happy with us which I'm NOT used to. I'm used to a really nice waiters and waitresses and servers and just don't have a problem with people because I'm a nice friendly person myself. \n\nI pretty much always tip 20%, I mean it's been years since I left less than a 20% tip, I can't even REMEMBER the last time I left less than 20%. But last night our bill came to $ 21.89 and I just added added  $1.11 to the credit card receipt because the service was so bad.  \n\nFrom the time he brought the food till we were done and sitting there waiting, it was 30 minutes and he never even stopped by to see if there was anything else we needed, and we could've used more napkins and water. \n\nThe manager was also very unfriendly. I'm staying in a motel and eat out everyday so I know how servers and managers are supposed to act. This place has had several other reviewers complain about the service and management and I wonder why they don't heed the criticisms and try to improve. I know I won't be back, and neither  will my daughter. \n\nMesa has a plethora of wonderful little restaurants and cafes with good food, and good service and good prices so there's no reason to patronize a place that doesn't measure up. I've been the person behind the counter who had difficult customers and unruly children and I did my best to tolerate and help them out so they would leave with a favorable impression of my business and want to return.

It's an odd blend of shapes and textures that make you think it was somehow cooked up in lab by space aliens based on things they observed about our culture remotely, quickly prototyped in a large hanger, then deployed to our planet overnight in part of a program to observe and study our behavior.\n\nThe menus have the odd appearance of a parts catalog for a Pakistani-made bazooka. Odd, drop-shadowed fonts that just seem  . . . wrong in some way. The graphic designers for this place must just love their jobs. But then the food pictured is all Southern-style good-ol' boy trucker grub. Including grits. This is the weirdest one can make waffles, eggs and grits look without really trying at it.\n\nThe servers for the most part are friendly and efficient, though some of them speak in accents that probably haven't been commonly heard since around the time of the Civil War. I think there are still closed-off little mountain enclaves where people go from adolescence to military service to indentured labor at Waffle House. That's just the way of it.\n\nThe food seems ample, but it really doesn't satisfy. Shove a plate full of the oddly-textured waffles slathered in butter substitute into your mouth and you'll be hungry for lunch two hours later. It's not cheap, either.\n\nSo why does it exist? Setting aside for a moment the alien-conspiracy theory, I think Waffle House offers a minimal level of edible items around the clock. They are usually clean and located near highways. \n\nAnd that's about it.", "business_id": "eONS7DP6U9BV3lkqGAUbOg", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-01-29", "type": "review"}

I remember the first time I went to a Mimis, I was about this tall and lived in Orange County, CA with me Ma and seesters sometime in the midst of the harrowing hell that was the Reagan era. Punk rock ruled the hearts and Duran Duran ruled music television and BMW's painted the streets (doesn't anyone buy American anymore?). I think we had ditched my Da or he was out on some sort of alcoholic binge somewheres of a seedier nature surrounded by other people with like fuzzy boundaries, cold dark and rainy. \n\nMimis was a warm blanket on that cold dark rainy day. The smell was a slap my face telling me what is fine and good and worthy of respect. Comfort in a sometimes seemingly uncomfortable existence (it's not really, relax people. unless you got a real corker and need a laxative or somethin'). The other day for lunch walking through the doors with a good friend reminded me of that first day. \n\nMmmmm... yes please, I'd like some more tea. I was prepared for breakfast, eggs Benedict, but we didn't arrive until after noon. :(  So after pouting I chose the turkey pistachio salad on croissant and an order of onion rings with blue cheese, jogging with a tasty cigarette. Yah? Well I was rushed OK. The sammich was well built and tasted of fowl-ly and fruity goodness. The onion rings and blue cheese were sinfully handled into my belly. I think the old bat sitting in the next booth got a little flush, oh my goodness that's not how you're supposed to eat. Oh yah! pre-sandwich my friend ordered a bran muffin! Her muffin was delicious, especially after I buttered it. I ate most of half of it and then save a bite or 2 for dessert. She also had a salad with blue cheese vinaigrette, I think. I was too frantic about choosing my own lunch to hear what she had ordered but gods almighty it was scrumptious. I wanted to lick the bowl.  \n\nThe service is regular as a healthy baby and as right as rain and this time was no exception. I think I had a gallon of tea in a pint glass that never reached the bottom. And smiles and how do you do's and thank you's littered the place. \n\nWith bill paid we headed out and grabbed bigger handfuls of even more chocolaty mints than we had on the way in and ran and giggled all the way to the car.\n\nAnd 5 stars for the overall experience, nostalgia included.", "business_id": "qLXxp0rpzT4kG9tT3wZwfA", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-02-10", "type": "review"}

Not really sure what I am trying to say except that the visage you see from the street that seems quite enticing has no bearing on the food.  My chicken pot pie contained the entire chicken (or so it seemed).  It had already broken through the crust and was eyeballing the front door when the waiter brought it our table.   It looks like the chicken fought pretty well up until the end however.  Perhaps with a lesser chef the chicken might have prevailed.  In any event I was really bummed.  I have always loved faux french food served in a Thomas Kincaid style restaurant.  Oh...I'll go back.  Cuz I want this relationship to work.  The  Perdu I had years ago will haunt me it was so good.  Perhaps it was just an off nite and maybe thats just the way French folk make pot pie.  Yeah...also...the artichoke dip was really really bad too.  However, who orders artichoke dip @ Mimi's?  I have no idea what I was thinking.  But still, it was awful.  How can that be?  Our seats were pretty good though.  I could keep an eye on my car in the parking lot.  There is some comfort in that.

While it was quick, it wasn't all that friendly.  I ordered the plate that included biscuits, fried apples, and hasbrown casserole, and I added a side of grits to it.  My boyfriend and his dad heard me order it, but apparently, the waitress didn't.  She quickly disappeared after she brought out our food, so I didn't have the chance to ask about my grits then.  She never checked back with us, so I kind of flagged her down near the end of our meal as she passed by our table.  I told her I had ordered a side of grits, but I never received it.  She glared at me and made kind of a grumble noise.  She did bring some grits out a few minutes later, but she didn't smile or say anything.\n\nThe apples were absolutely delicious.  The grits were bland (I remember them being much better at another Cracker Barrel location), and part of my hashbrown casserole was burnt.  The part that wasn't burnt was really good, though.  The biscuits were cold, and they didn't taste fresh.  I was disappointed that my biscuits didn't come with gravy, but maybe they only come with gravy when you order the big breakfast deals?  I dunno.  But my boyfriend let me have some of his gravy, and it, too, was cold.  And it wasn't thick and creamy like I've had it at other Cracker Barrel restaurants.\n\nMaybe this location was just having an off day?  Fortunately, my first experience with Cracker Barrel was an extremely good one (both food- and service-wise), so I'm not going to say that I'll never come back to this chain due to this one experience.  But I can honestly say that my experience at this location doesn't measure up nearly as high as my experiences at other Cracker Barrel restaurants (one of which I would have given five stars to had I been a Yelper at the time).", "business_id": "g5csdtYUt97hkexFMCVf-g", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-02-25", "type": "review"}

We went in to get a table and they told us it would be a 20 minute wait.  After 45 minutes of just waiting around for our table to be ready, we went up to the hostess stand to ask what the hold up was.  The hostess told us that she had called our name and we didn't show up so they thought we \"surrendered our reservation.\"  We were standing there the whole time, with a group of us, and not one person in our group heard them call out our name.\n\nWe finally got to sit, and noticed that the servers all have stars on their name tags, ranging in number.  We asked our server what the stars mean (he had two), and he told us it was their customer service scores.  Uh oh!\n\nI ordered french toast, and they asked if I wanted a fruit topping, and I ordered apples.  They then asked if we wanted syrup, and I said yes to that as well.  My french toast comes out with no syrup and no apples.  I had to flag down my server to ask for these things, and even then I only got the apples.\n\nThen, the gross happened.  We were seated right next to the main entrance, and this little kid came running up and vomited right behind us (In this kids defense, he really was trying to haul ass to the bathroom and just didn't quite make it).  Now, this vomit was not chunky, it was clear (I'm getting to why this is important).  The employees took SO long to clean it up that people ended up walking through it, since it wasn't immediately noticeable to the unsuspecting pedestrian, and tracked vomit throughout this eatery.  They never even offered to move us, so we got to sit, horrified, watching this all go down.\n\nNext time we have a night on the town in Phoenix, we will skip right over Cracker Barrel in it's vomity gloriousness and head straight to IHOP.", "business_id": "g5csdtYUt97hkexFMCVf-g", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-01-26", "type": "review"}

On top of a 35+ minute wait for our food, the dishes were mediocre at best. (And why the long wait? My wife sent her omelette back because there was cheese inside--the menu clearly omitted that fact, but not a deal breaker--and a new one was served up in less than five minutes. So what did they do the other 30 minutes? I understand if there was a sudden rush of tickets right before our order was placed, but didn't seem busy enough to warrant such a wait. Anyhow, I digress.) \n\nWe were starving at this point, so the Dre's (patty)  Melt I ordered was mostly devoured (as a patty melt connoisseur, I'll give it a pass but the meat needed more seasoning), but my wife's face told me all I needed to know about her spinach omelette. She also clearly verbalized it: \"This is the worst omelette I've ever had.\" Doesn't get much simpler than that. \n\nSo, Chase's Diner, great job on the atmosphere--you pulled off the feeling of 'diner' very well. But otherwise, from our experience, everything else needs work. \n\nTwo stars because the waitress was cordial (but also never refilled the water) but the food and wait aren't worth it.", "business_id": "kNnk3xy9eb4ym8nljQUGlA", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-12-11", "type": "review"}

It was totally out of place and totally uncalled for.\n\nWe were finishing lunch and the General Manager approahced our table -- no other table -- our table.  His conversation was directed at my 87 year old grey haired mother.  He began by pulling some $5 coupons out of his shirt pocket and asking her if she'd like to have a coupon she could use in January.  After baiting her with his pitch, he sprung the rest of the sales pitch on her.  She could have one if she'd buy a $25 gift card.  We were shocked.  It was totally out of place.  If he wants to sell coupons, he's definitely in the wrong job.  \n\nNormally when a general manager visits a table it's to ask how everything is and if he can do anything for his patrons, not to see them coupons.\n\nRegardless of any other stars we'd give this restaurant, we won't return.  We go out to eat not to be hassled by a manager coming to our table to try to sell us something.  I could understand at the cash register offering gift cards with a $5 coupon but not at the table and not the way this manager presented it.  I think he needs a training in etiquette before he's let loose in a restaurant. \n\nSo, I dropped an email to corporate headquarters.  They forwarded it on to the Mimi's in Chandler.  This morning I received a form letter in my email from the Service Manager.  Yes, it was definitely a form letter and it definitely had obvious misspelled words -- not typos.   And, why is it they always think they can make things better by offering a free meal and not even addressing the problem?  We definitely won't use it.\n\n-- Hostess was pleasant and efficient.

While those hotcakes made for an excellent meal, they weren't the protein pancakes from US Egg nor the custom-made ones from Good Egg I've been craving for the past two weeks.  So, I decided I'd stop at Good Egg and claim my free entree w/ the customer appreciation card I've been holding onto for more than a year now.\n\nMy server Bailey was amiable and attentive.  She suggested I try adding dollar pancakes to my entree since I couldn't decide whether to go w/ some pancakes or something off of the lunch menu.  Thanks to the two Diners, Drive-ins, & Dives' episodes on breakfasts I'd seen during Monday's treadmill routine, I also had a craving for some corned beef hash (or those wonderful hash browns from Matt's in downtown Phx).  I decided to go w/ a full stack of pancakes ($7.50) and a side of corned beef hash ($3.95).  While having breakfast, I looked over the dollar menu wedged conveniently between the condiments and saw that for a $1 more, I could have \"today's sweet deal.\"  Well, Bailey, what is today's deal?  A choice between an apple streusel bread pudding w/ caramel sauce or a strawberry shortcake w/ house-made strawberry fruit topping, you say?  Decisions, decisions!  Thankfully, the caramel contained corn syrup, so that made it easier for me to choose... \n\nSo there I was, for weeks craving for some of those blueberry-almond-wheat germ whole wheat pancakes and what did you think I ordered?  A stack made w/ sliced bananas, candied slivered almonds, and Ghirardelli chips!  Silly me.  But they were very, very good!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-good-egg-chandler?select=0Wuwde1B28GdL1HXRxQUBQ#0Wuwde1B28GdL1HXRxQUBQ  The toasted slivered almonds added a different texture from those whole candied almonds I have at home, and the chips at GE didn't burn on the griddle like those I'd made myself.  (I'd skipped the secret step to making great choccy chip pancakes... you have to coat them w/ flour first to keep them from sinking to the bottom when you add them to the batter!  Yesterday, however, I just topped my cakes w/ some chips, so no wonder they charred when I flipped them over.)  Um, but I digress...  The corned beef hash, ordered on the crispy side, was crisped nice and salty.  It could've been a little crispier, but these were good enough.  Loved the salt-sweet contrast- what a great meal!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-good-egg-chandler?select=Ojm8b8LkvBVqJ4D3Jrer9A#Ojm8b8LkvBVqJ4D3Jrer9A  The coffee was freshly-brewed and strong, and I liked having a thermos on the table for me to pour myself another cuppa.  Last, but not least, the strawberry shortcake was just the perfect way to cap a terrific experience at GE.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-good-egg-chandler?select=N_Uofl8oX8l-RQMZ6i39Dw#N_Uofl8oX8l-RQMZ6i39Dw  Well, that and the large cup of coffee everyone gets to take on the way out.

Being a small independent diner, they have a lot of breakfast options, and at very reasonable prices. I pass it each day I go bowling, when its closed. I have never been on this side of town when they are open until yesterday. This is the review for a Sunday brunch at Wanda's:\n\n~Fud/Drink~\nI went with family, who love to eat breakfast the traditional way, with a lot of eggs and carbs. Their dishes were huge, and they were satisfied. I asked if they had any complaints, because I needed their perspective, and their was not a peep from them. So this spot is awesome for generic omelets and pancake options on the cheap...BUT, as for me, I choose to eat healthy...This, of course, back-fired on me. They only had one reasonably healthy option on the menu, oatmeal. That's it. I kinda figured that would be the case, why would they have healthy options when it was just waste in their fridge? I asked for the Oatmeal and a side of egg whites. I asked for TWO egg whites scrambled. But, what I got was a shriveled piece of something on a plate. Four bites and it was gone. I was not thrilled, I expected at least a little bit more on the plate... As for the Oatmeal I ordered, it was generic, as was the shriveled egg whites. It tasted good, the nuts they gave me however tasted old, I did not use them. They are a breakfast/lunch diner, and in being this, do not serve alcohol, that's a give in. My family told me the coffee was very tasty for a small joint, they would all come back to eat here again if in the area. I would listen to them, it is a nice option for a traditional American Breakfast. \n\n~Atmosphere/Service~\nThe waitstaff make this place a great destination. \nwere quick to get the food out, and were personable when coming back to check in. Despite being a full house, they were diligent in check back in with us. You can tell they care, the waitresses all had smiles on their faces as they came around filling coffee cups and handing out dishes. You come to expect that at a mom & pop spot, good customer service. As for the atmosphere, its the usual set-up for a small indy diner, a small space with a few tables and outside options. Not much decor, which is fine. \n~Extras/Rating~\n If you like breakfast and are in the Chandler area, there are a number of spots to eat at. They get get crowded quickly, and most locals know that Wanda's is just down the road. I highly recommend it for the average person wanting a cheap breakfast in the area. Don't stop in if you are on a diet. I enjoyed my time with the family, but unless I am in the area and really hankering an omelet its not my kind of spot. The food is cheap and the plates are tasty and large. Support local, eat local! Skip the IHOP's and try Wanda's out. At least you know you will be treated better. Average food gets average ratings, but a solid 3 stars go out primarily to waitresses who did a good job!", "business_id": "bEQjf7c-9qkNWgXvriSGZw", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-02-25", "type": "review"}

Their tostadas are SO FRESH and the taste is so clean.  I crave them!  The place is just a little hole in the wall local place, but the food is great and the quality is excellent.  We found them by eating at Flancer's across the parking lot, where we also go often for their sandwiches.\nLove LuLu's tostadas and beans and rice!  Way better than Filiberto's!", "business_id": "CRvVvR6aE1eWVRtzQ0UC6g", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-12-30", "type": "review"}

I've been going here since I was a little girl and I swear that good 'ol burro get's better every time. I've also had their shredded beef tacos, chimis, enchiladas, and there chips and salsa is tasty. I've had their wonderful horchata and they have the best ice ever!! Is that weird...? If you go you'll know. It's like Sonic ice. It's run by a family and I see the same workers in there every time. I love getting to know them through the years, such a nice family. I do think the taco's are average, good, but average. But that burro... Bean's, cheese, x-tra cheese, and sour cream. Pour the salsa over the top and add some limes. Yummm!!!! I even moved to Los Angeles (mexican food?) and yeah right, I craved this place weekly. I love you Lulu's...", "business_id": "CRvVvR6aE1eWVRtzQ0UC6g", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-01-05", "type": "review"}
