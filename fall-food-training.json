My family and I tend to shop at Giant Eagle, partly because of the large size of their stores and partly because of their GetGo rewards. Kuhn's has somehow become the place we stop when we don't have time to drive to Giant Eagle. \n\nWhich is totally a shame, because whenever I DO stop in here I'm reminded about how nice the place actually is. Today a simple trip for milk turned into a fall-themed decoration shopping spree that went really well (yay super cute owl pillows!) and I ended up picking some breakfast and lunch items as well just because of how cheap they were. I know from past experience that the produce is fresh, and between the wonderful aroma and colorful display the bakery here is absolutely torturous to pass. There's also a ready-made dinner/lunch shelf with sandwiches, chicken wings, pizzas and a few dessert items if you want to grab those on your way out; I've actually gotten dinner here a few times on my way home from the city when I was too tired to cook. What's not to like about affordable and delicious food, right?\n\nHowever, there is at least one thing that does keep me from wanting to be a regular here and giving Kuhn's a 5 star review: the blasted parking lot you have to deal with to go here, which I've cursed in other reviews. This lot is the one that fills up super quickly, creates miniature traffic jams like no one's business, and is a time-stealing trap. Sigh. Suddenly I think I understand why my family always goes to Giant Eagle.\n\nSorry, Kuhn's. Your prices are wonderful, your set-up fantastic, and your options well varied and impressive.

I used to do a lot of my weekly shopping here, but now that I live in the North Hills I've got that can't-cross-the-river syndrome and I only get there every other week or so. It's miles above a Market District, though, in terms of entertainment value and pricing.\n\nThe cheese counter is pretty good. It's not the most amazing selection ever, but it's great for Pittsburgh. For example, they don't carry a variety of aged cheddars or Stiltons, opting instead to offer one or two basic and many flavored versions (with apples, with onions, etc.) They do let you sample, which I recommend; like another reviewer, I've gotten over-old blue cheese here once or twice. They've always enforced the half-pound minimum for me. The fresh mozzarella is great, and I can't resist it when tomatoes are in season. I hate to even mention it, but one time I got home and found... well, a hair in my mozzarella. It put me off for a few weeks but seems to have been a one-time incident (and no, I never brought it up to them).\n\nThe deli has fantastic prices and does proper thin slices, nicely laid out on paper sheets so it doesn't stick together. Daniele prosciutto is amazing, and the domestic is pretty good at a great price. Iberico and Serrano jamon? Yes please.\n\nService at both the cheese and deli counters can take a pretty long time if you go on a weekend. However, I've been able to walk right up on weekday afternoons, and the weekend logjam is kind of fun once in a while.\n\nIn the same room they have the amazing olive bar. I pretty much only buy olives in the Strip. I know the Iggle has an olive bar, but everything I've ever bought from one tastes off in a way I can't put my finger on. Castleventrano olives (a bright, clear light green) are amazing: buttery and briny and fruity with a firm texture. Cerignola are good, and the various stuffed olives on offer are nice if you don't feel like dealing with pits.\n\nI haven't really bought many of their bulk goods aside from Jordan almonds, to which I am shamelessly addicted. They have a variety of pretty colors, as well as the \"seconds\" which aren't as shiny but taste great anyway.\n\nI love the selection of anchovies, tuna and tomato products in the dry goods area. They also have a good variety of hot sauces, though I can't say I've ever seen Pickapeppa there. Full range (I think) of Dave's Insanity, and lots of other brands as well. Important: They do sell Blennd concentrate, which you can also pick up at the Iggle. I have fond childhood memories of drinking Blennd at the KMart cafeteria growing up. I introduced my Michigan-born husband to it and he never visits Pittsburgh without getting Blennd at least once. (You can also get it premixed and cold at Wholey's, FYI.)\n\nIn the next room you'll find baccala (yum), pour-your-own olive oils at a reasonable price (not a huge selection, but the Spanish is fruity and a good everyday sort of thing at $4.99/12oz). I pretty much never buy bread here, opting to hit up the double rustic baguettes at Mancini's instead. The anise love knot cookies are great.\n\nThe last room has produce, normally at a good price but not the best selection. They do have fresh figs in season, thank God. I have to admit I've never tried the fresh pasta, since that's one of those things I just make at home. I should probably remedy that so I can offer an opinion on it. They sometimes have refrigerated and ready-to-go San Pelligrino Chinotto, a bitter soda that comes in a pretty bottle you can use as a small vase afterwards.\n\nCheckout is straightforward and efficient, but you will be in line for a while if you go on a weekend. It's nuts, just like everywhere else in the Strip. If you can, visit all the shops both on a weekday and on a weekend to enjoy two totally different experiences.\n\nThey do have a small parking area behind the store on Liberty, with which I wish you good luck on a Saturday. Otherwise it's street parking, but there's a ton of that, and walking past and through the other shops in the Strip is so much fun it shouldn't matter anyway.", "business_id": "niW0ggRVPW5fafcfImdK7w", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-09-13", "type": "review"}

I didn't add anything to my tea, but condiments and napkins can be found across from the barista's stand where you order.  I also wanted a snack, so I decided to get a potato chip cookie, since (1) it looked the most appealing and (2) it sounded interesting!  It was saltier and crispier than a regular cookie, but was still also sweet, and had a drizzle of chocolate icing on the top.  While I liked the sweet-salty combination, I would have preferred for it to have been a bit sweeter to offset the extra salt--if there had been more icing, it would have been perfect.  It was definitely different and interesting, and worth a try, though!\n\nBefore I ordered, I overheard the barista saying to other customers that she didn't know where the baked goods that they sell come from, which didn't sit well with me.  (If you read the other Yelp reviews, you'll see that they come from Prantl's.) Employees should be informed about the product they're selling.  Having said that, she did describe the potato chip cookie accurately, which partially redeemed her.", "business_id": "yYyWwqPiLJO7eWRt0g_PBg", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-11-05", "type": "review"}

The produce items tend to be more expensive, but, to be fair, nearly all if it is fresh.\n\nThird, Giant Eagle offers a brand guarantee and a return policy which assure customer satisfaction; that is, you can return items you are dissatisfied with.

As I was walking down Walnut Street, I passed by this place and after an initial glance I didn't really think to stop in.  However, thanks to some quick Yelp research I decided to give this place a try and I am definitely glad I did so.\n\nRight out of the gate I noticed that this place proudly bears the exuberant charm of an old school Vegas bar - between the jukebox, the cigarette machine, and the velour decor, I was instantly transported back in time.  I would be remiss if I didn't mention the fully functional retro gold-plated cash register that looks it like a dropped out a time machine from the 60s.  Definitely one of my favorite features adorning this establishment!  I should also point out that this bar has a strong allergy to plastic - no credit accepted so be sure to grab some cash on the way over to avoid the $2 ATM fee per transaction. Not terrible but worth mentioning for the exceedingly budget conscious folks.\n\nOne of the reasons I chose this place was due to its reputation for very strong drinks.  I completely concur with other reviewers that the drinks are as strong as I've ever had any establishment.  Every drink was pretty much a double or even triple compared to any other typical bar.   As you may have imagined, people don't come here for the food.  In fact, the only food they serve are small bags of chips and pretzels kept behind the bar.  I had to leave after an hour or so to go get dinner, though I definitely came back for more nonsense after eating!\n\nThe jukebox has a wide selection of music from the 60s all the way up into the 90s - plenty of options to suit anyone's taste really. Also, as another reviewer noted, this place seems to be popular with hipsters and men in their 60s. In any event, everybody was in good spirits and seemed to be pretty outgoing and open-minded. Most people I spoke with seemed genuinely happy to converse, and either already knew or wanted to get to know one another.  I had some interesting conversations about Pittsburgh and its history with some locally bred patrons.  The bartender was absolutely phenomenal - very sociable and was obviously a big hit with all of the regulars.\n\nI'm staying in Shadyside the rest of the week, and am planning to check out some of the other local spots. That said, it seems Le Mardi Gras is a bit of an insider's secret - a sleeper, perhaps - where only those in the know appreciate it for what it is.  I definitely recommend you stop by next time you're in the area, at least for a drink or two. As long as you don't mind the smoking, a couple drinks will put you well on your way for the evening whether you decide to stay or move on!", "business_id": "TIPebazlAGJsp8zAwhNkcw", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-11-17", "type": "review"}

Kelly Matthews was my catering lead and Jessica also helped on the day of the event.\n\nMy expectations were dramatically exceeded. I would recommend them to anyone for these reasons:\n\n1. Flexibility - As an out-of-town bride, Kelly was quick in responses, edits to estimates and suggestions to queries via email since I couldn't attend in-person meetings too often.\n\n2. Professionalism - Team worked so I didn't have to think about anything on the day of the wedding. They even prepared plates and drinks for my husband and I so that we didn't wait in the buffet line and had a few minutes at our table to eat before crowds arrived. Jessica helped by directing us during the event as well and giving us heads up on timings. In addition to food, they helped set up decor - even lit lanterns and candles on tables!\n\n3. Fair Prices - I wanted interesting food combinations, which doesn't usually go hand-in-hand with reasonable pricing for a big event. However, Kelly was great in offering many choices and speaking to the chef several times to ensure we had great variety.\n\n4. Presentation - Food was displayed beautifully. Kelly gave helpful suggestions on how to set up the buffet for good crowd flow throughout the event. My favorite presentation was a small bamboo plate with a BBQ slider and homemade potato chips - delish!\n\n5. Quality - I received a lot of questions about who did my catering from friends who are also in the wedding planning mode. Guests loved the food and flavors were appealing to all.\n\nAgain, can't recommend them enough - definitely add them to your list when interviewing caterers!", "business_id": "GIqmLJsJYuzwrj7oviJ_KA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-10-05", "type": "review"}

Usually, Safeway is my favorite place to shop. Over the years, i have had countless wonderful experiences at various Safeway's across the state. And I have been known to express my love for Safeway numerous times in public. I don't know how it's possible for a manger to screw up a grocery store more than this. Doesn't corporate come by every once and a while? \n\nI am grateful to read that I\"m not the only one with this impression. Every time I go, they're out of something. And I\"m not talking about Peruvian Wild Goats Milk or some other obscure specialty food. I\"m talking basics. Bread, milk, soda.\n\nBut my main issue is their Signature Sandwich Deli. It is atrocious. A few years ago, I remember people would be lined up to get their sandwiches here. Not anymore. The service is incredibly slow, the sandwiches are made poorly and there is always something missing, or low. And getting a bin refilled seems to be a monumental task, so it just doesn't get done. Today, they hadnt' refilled the artichokes. When I asked for artichokes, instead of refilling it and giving me artichokes, the guy behind the counter took the artichoke JUICE and dribbled it on my sandwich, making it impossible to eat without a fork and spoon later. I just don't ever recall that a sandwich required silverware. \n\nThe time prior, I went and they were out of tomatoes. Huh? IT\"S A GROCERY STORE! Walk over to the produce and pick up a tomato!\n\nThe time before that, I just wanted a chilled Coke. Sounds simple. Popular brand. Large grocery chain. What could possibly go wrong? Well, for one, they hadn't stocked the refrigerators by the registers. When I inquired about getting a coke, the staff looked at the cooler that had 2 Dr. Peppers left and asked me, \"Well, do you want a Dr. Pepper?\"\n\"NO! I want a Coke.\" \n\nNo matter what I go there for, I can't seem to get out of the store without some type of issue. But sadly, it's the closest store to my downtown office. \n\nRegardless, if you have a choice, skip this Safeway, there are plenty of others that will win you over.", "business_id": "7Z7IkR_-94AjUuDw0fbI7g", "stars": 1, "date": "2008-11-17", "type": "review"}

In fact, I've had one for 7 straight days. My wonderful doctor just wrote me two prescriptions so I can kick the pain in the pants. Groovy. Prescription Drop-Off = No problem. 15 minute wait? I can swing that. What's another tick, tick, tick of the clock as my head throb, throb, throbs. \n\nI mosey around the aisles. Nice. Latex gloves on sale - 3 boxes for $10. Oh, look, espresso chocolate. \n\nTick, tick, tick. \n\n45 minutes later without my name called over the loudspeaker (bummer), I head to the Pick-Up. I'm anxious for my meds. It's been a long day anyway, and this is the final stop. Or so I thought. \n\nI take a seat and stare at the floor. After all, the overhead lights hurt my eyes. I glance up and the pharmacist smiles at me. That's pleasant. I continue to wait.\n\n\"What's the name?\" I answer her. \n\nThat's when I hear they have 3/4 of my prescription ready but that one drug (my drug of choice to tackle the migraine) is out of stock. Would it be okay if I waited until Monday? \n\nUhmmm... \n\nMy mind flashes back to another Walgreens on another day when I'm waiting - in agony, mind you, after oral surgery. I want my narcotics like the children of rock wanted their MTV. I was told they were out, and I'd have to wait... or take my carcass to another pharmacy. I opted for the latter, for the claw marks in my palms were evidence enough that I couldn't stomach this pain any longer. \n\nSo, needless to say, when I was told by this particular Walgreens that they were out of my gonna-make-your-boo boo-all-better meds, I had an emotional hiccup. WHAT? \n\nCount up the minutes. One hour in this stinkin' Walgreens and I'm really no better off than when my peds walked through the front door. Double ugh. Why couldn't they have called my name over the loudspeaker like they said they would? Then I wouldn't have waited in vain. \n\nStupid pharmacy.

Order on THIS side, pickup food on THAT side, come back to THIS side to get dessert.  It's enough to make you want to just get in the car and drive home.  But DON'T !!!\n\nIf it weren't for the \"Drool Event\" which occurred today, I probably would not have posted this review at all.\n\nI shared the Green Chile Burger with my daughter, and we were both underwhelmed, really.  Nothing awesome about the burger.  Oh, it's FAR better than fast food burgers, but it's not comparable to Lobby's or Chuckbox (my two top burgers in town, probably.)  The french fries were a little thin and not too memorable really.\n\nMy son had the wings and loved them  But a hitch - I SPECIFICALLY requested RANCH for the wings, and they came out with Blue Cheese, which I then had to take back and get exchanged for Ranch.  Not a huge problem, but just a little annoying.  The Ranch was very good however.\n\nThe \"Olive Oil Cake\" that everyone RAVES about?  Meh.  It's just an extra-moist version of your average pound cake.  Tastes just like the pound cake I grew up eating in Texas, but it was a little \"oilier\" than your usual pound cake fare.  It was good, but not \"Oh My God!\" good.\n\nNow for the best item I had from there:  The Drool Creator.\n\nIt was mostly an afterthought, really.  While standing in line to get the Olive Oil cake to go, I saw the little section where they keep their \"to go\" salads.  I looked around at the varieties, and thought the Chopped Turkey Salad looked promising - bacon, boiled egg, turkey slices, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and two different dressings - Blue Cheese and some sort of yellowish vinaigrette.   I decided to take one home and eat it for lunch at work on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nGreat.  Decision.\n\nI don't really know what the magic was.  Maybe it was just a good combination of flavors.  Maybe it was just all fresh.  Maybe they use some sort of Magical Salad Crack.  I don't know.  But it was a DANG good salad.  Even on the third day, when I ate the last of it.\n\nI just combined both dressings ( about half of each little container each day ) and it was marvelous.\n\nNot too many meals cause me to drool in between bites.  This salad had some serious Mojo.\n\nI WILL be back for another one, hoping to recapture the Magic.", "business_id": "R8VwdLyvsp9iybNqRvm94g", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-10-26", "type": "review"}

We're 100% dedicated drive-thru users, and stick to a usual regimen. Two toasted bagels (typically garlic, sesame, or everything) with two specialty coffees. My wife prefers their hot vanilla latte and I'm the iced caramel machiatto addict (asking for the caramel to be melted and mixed into the espresso to make for a smoother drink). It's a $15 tab and we spend it at least 2-3 times per week.\n\nThe drive thru is typically speedy, with nice service. Obviously weekend mornings are  a little busier than others but that's to be expected, right? The staff still gets you through quickly and with a smile. \n\nThe breakfast sandwiches are a good alternative- and offer some calorie conscious eaters options (turkey sausage and no cheese anyone?)... if you are calorie counting stay away from the blueberry muffin bites. Just trust me on that one.\n\nYou're always apt to see folks with their pets camped out on the small patio space, so it's cool to see the pet-friendly space. Even though it's a typical breakfast chain, it's a great alternative to other fast food places like McD's or BK. The coffee is good, food is great, and staff friendly! \n\nAnd don't forget they offer lunch items- lunchmeat sandwiches served on a bagel of your choice. The taste options are practically endless.

It is the type of restaurant where you place your order at a counter, find a place to sit, and then they bring your food to you.  They can get quite busy during peak meal times, but they are efficient at finding open tables for you, so you're never wandering around looking for a table after you've ordered.\n\nThey are locally-owned and use a lot of fresh, locally grown ingredients, so that gives me a warm fuzzy feeling when I eat there.  Pizzas, salads, and sandwiches are all delicious, but what deserves an extra special shout out is the dessert case.  The gigantic cinnamon roll is perfection.\n\nCan't think of enough good things to say; just go check it out for yourself.", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-09-12", "type": "review"}
