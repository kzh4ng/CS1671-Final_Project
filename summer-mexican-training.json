Not ones that are there because they are forced to.  That way, maybe you can actually earn a decent review.  If you start off with a bad experience with an employee, you're not going to get a great review.\n\nI went here midday on a Sunday.  Thought that was a great idea, especially when I got there and there were no cars in the drive thru.  Pull up to the sign to order and wait for five minutes before I am even acknowledge that I am there.  Finally order and pull around, I wait another five minutes.  I could understand the wait if there was someone in front of me, or if the sit down area inside was packed, but there was no one else there but ME.\n\nI'd gladly tell y'all the employee's name, that is if where the name is suppose to be wasn't ripped off.  All I can really say is that she was a real ball of sunshine.  I was made to feel like I was interrupting her day and that I should have just went somewhere else to spend my money.\n\nYou know what really puts me in a tizzy (yes, I just used that word)?

And I love it. The servers are friendly, the place is beautiful, the best part is the outside patio. The only two negative things are the small bar area (happy hour is only in the bar) and the birds. The birds are cute, very chatty and will join you at your table to try and share your chips.\n\nThe food was great, I got the enchiladas which were tasty and I asked to change the side and the waiter was more then happy to let me do that. A friend got the Tuna salad which she enjoyed. I am not a fish person but she let me try her tuna and it was actually pretty good. The chips that come to your table are okay, I'm not a fan of the sweet potato chips, the texture and taste just do not work for me. So when I go I ask if I can just get corn tortilla chips, and they are happy to do that too. The salsa is a red smokey salsa which is good, but you can ask for green salsa which is just as good.. maybe better\n\nThe best part of this place is the Happy hour. The drinks are cheap and tasty. The best is the Grand Canyon Margarita which a mixture of orange, cranberry and prickly pear juices, its strong and only 3 bucks. The regular margaritas are excellent, on mondays that have a 10 dollar pitcher deal, a friend and I were able to get three each out of the pitcher. Good thing she lives in walking distance to the place. \n\nAnother good thing about the happy hour is the food. The bar has its own list of items in addition to the restaurants main menu. The best thing on that list is the chicken nachos, so good, best nachos I've had in a long time. Another is the cheese crisp with carnitas, very tasty.  Most of the items on this menu are around five dollars, and for five dollars you get a lot of food enough for two. \n\nI would highly recommend this place.", "business_id": "e5kc0CQ4R-PCCDgb274gSg", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-06-14", "type": "review"}

We live mere blocks from here, so we felt it was about time we tried it. \n\nThe chips and tostada base tasted off, as if the oil they were fried in was a little rancid. The cheese on the cheese crisp was plentiful- and pretty oily. My husband called the cheese in his chile relleno the most tasteless he had ever had, as was the relleno batter. \n\nI ordered a #1, but wanted to substitute a hard taco for the cheese enchilada. I checked the a la carte prices, and knew that the taco was actually less expensive, so I was sure I wasn't going to be screwing them over. I can't tell you how long it took me to try and explain what I wanted to our server. I'm sure there are those who would say it's my fault for not speaking Spanish. Anyway, I ended up getting my tostada and the hard taco, but no taquito, and no rice and beans. Then another 10 minutes of my life went by as I tried to explain again what I had ordered when the server asked if everything was alright, but that really, no one needed to bring me out any more food. I had had enough by that point and knew it would already be a Pepcid AC kind of night. The cook and the server argued and finally the server understood that she had gotten my order wrong. They comped my food, which wasn't necessary, but they insisted. My taco and tostada were just alright. The beans in the tostada were cold, which I am not used to.\n\nWe've had everything better somewhere else, and feel no need to return.", "business_id": "cgNIBHS2mLdbTRiodAT6EQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-06-11", "type": "review"}

HAVE YOU?!\n\nThis is THE place to have that experience. I say \"experience\" because molcajete is more like a witch's bubbling brew than a meal. Mariscos is a cozy little restaurant in an area a lot of people won't flock to, but it stays busy. All the good stuff applies here... friendly service, great food, Mexican beers, Mariachis (on Fridays, I believe). It's just a great place. And, now that the formalities are out of the way, I can talk about the molcajete. \n\nMolcajete is actually the name of the stone bowl that is used more traditionally as a mortar for salsas and such. As a dish though, it's a beautiful mixture of spicy/tangy sauce, grilled meats, grilled veggies, and cheese. It's one of my favorite Mexican dishes, period. Mariscos serves theirs with tons of fixins (beans, tortillas, salsas, etc.) that could probably fill two people up on their own, but their generous serving is much appreciated when ordering this dish for a small group. It's definitely one of those meals that'll impress people when it gets served. Order one for the table, and you're going to have a good time.\n\nI could spout on all day about molcajete... But, would ya look at that, I have a decent size review already, and I haven't even talked about the restaurant's specialty, seafood. Well, I'll let you read some other reviews for that.

Minor, maybe, but when the food was delivered to the table, one of the meals was missing and I was assured it would be right out.  20 minutes later I flagged down the waiter once again and with apologizes, was told they would get it right out.  Another 20 minutes went by and my guests had all finished their meals before the waiter came by to see if we needed anything else. When I told him we still hadn't received the meal and since everyone else was done, we no longer wanted the meal and wanted it removed from our bill.  Again with apologies, he left and finally returned 20 minutes later with the meal removed.  Annoyed with the slow service I tried to return the bill with my credit card immediately.

Actually, your subconsciousness would probably just have you look past it and not notice it at all.  But like my buddy's friend told him one day, look for the place that looks sort of run down with a lot of cars in front, they typically have the best food.  Following that advice, looking for food, we pulled a U-turn, went back and parked.\n\nWe were going to get take out until we heard the chips and salsa were free.  Budgeting and maximizing caloric intake, you know how that goes.  Place was hotter than all can be (the 2 a/c window units couldn't keep up), but we shrugged it off like the manly men we were and parked our arse.  \n\nThe waitress was really friendly and helpful in explaining all the stuff they make, and the best part about it is that it's made fresh - chips, salsa, guac, etc.  This place is the real deal when it comes to mexican food.  It just goes to show you how most all places bend and give in, abandoning their tradition, just to meet the \"needs\" of the American people.

The flauta and tamale were fantastic.  The green sauce on the tamale top notch.  The flower taco shell was an interesting experience.  It's the first I've had in the style offered at El Bravo.

El Bravo has a smaller staff and all the food is prepared fresh when you order.  This isn't assembly line style cooking.  You can even look into the kitchen from the counter and watch the magic happen.  \n\nThe dining area is of ample size and fit for the solo diner or families.
