I believe his name is Matt or something that begins with a M.  (Young guy, brown hair, and awesome tattoos).    \n\nMany of my orders get messed up because SOME (not all) of the cashiers are busy talking to each other while my order is being taken.  I don't mind that but focus on the customers too.\n\nThe major complaint that I have with this location is when the high schools let out.  The tons of students from various of communities just hanging out, cussing or making a lot of noise.  They sit on the tables and often just sit at your table.  When Arby's and Wendy's use to be open next door, the management  of these establishments did not put up with this loitering or chaos..", "business_id": "4LcFKTr6Ah87VcxW2z5e6w", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-12-08", "type": "review"}

Coming off of always busy Fairview Road you come down a narrow drive and almost immediately make a left into the drive thru/enter entrance.  You circle the building and have to look quickly to find a parking space.  If you dally, you have to re-circle that narrow area.\n\nA masterful siting for the building and the inside reminds me of the giant McDonald's in Asia.  Multistory and all the goodies.

The other girl was talking to a customer for about a minute  and the customer left. She then looks up at me, doesn't say a word, and proceeds to turn her back to me and text on her cell phone in plain sight for several minutes. This whole time, neither girl acknowledges me whatsoever but I am clearly standing at the counter waiting to be helped. A young man comes and asks the girls if I have been helped and without looking up the both respond no. He helps me and is friendly and fast so I am not completely furious.
