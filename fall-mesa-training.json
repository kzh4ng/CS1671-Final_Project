There were four of us that walked in this past Sunday to watch some football and grab wings and beer. Place was pretty empty and got a seat right away. Server came over and took our order of 3 beers and a gin and tonic, 15 min later we finally received our drinks. The Gin and tonic sat so long at the bar there was barely any ice. It took about another 20 min to even order our food and once we ordered it took 35 minutes for simple wings and fries. Once the wings came out they were cold but didnt want to send them back just to wait another 30 min. All around a pretty horrible experience. Wouldn't recommend visiting here unless you want terrible service and terrible food.

Unfortunately it was the closest hospital to her. First of all you have to wait forever to get a nurse in your room. Since she was hooked up to all kinds of tubes, she had to always wait for a bed pan. When asked if she could wear depends we were told they ran out, and gave her a feminine pad! She had an accident twice when they didn't get in here quick enough. The first time we waited two hours for her to get cleaned up, the second time they told her she wasn't that wet and didn't get changed at all! Then the nurse who took her blood raised up her bed all the way and left it up when she left. When another nurse came in she yelled at ME for her raised bed! Today when I came to visit, there was bloody gauze and some kind of suture on her table that was not thrown away when her chest tubes were taken out. I had my four year old with me and did not want him to touch it so I asked her nurse, Simone, to throw it away because I did not know if it could go in the regular trash. She was on the computer and told me it would be just a second. Thirty minutes later she came in and said did you need something? I know at hospitals nurses have multiple patients, and are always busy. They're normally some of the most awesome people there are. But when these nurses act like it's a burden when they're called, it makes you scared to even call for anything. And I haven't even mentioned the construction they're doing here with all the jackhammer and pounding noise.

Eight months pregnant and she decides to give me an upper unit; no elevators.

It was so far away from where my room was I was just too tired to walk all the way over there.\n\nWe only stayed two nights.

There was nothing we could do and no one to help us at that time. My husband had been working 14 hour days so I know he was so super tired; I was pissed. The next day I called the front desk and spoke to Yvette. I told her the situation and asked her to please get someone to fix the situation. The alarm clock had been unplugged in my room which makes me think that all the alarm clocks in every room are unplugged. Obviously except the room next door to us. She said she would get someone down there to fix right away which I was grateful for. \n\nOur second night here......... my husband and I are both up at 3:30 AM AGAIN because of the same stupid alarm. Cannot freaken believe this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \n\nI go to check out that same day about 15 minutes before 11 AM... and Yvette is at the front desk.

The gyro sandwich was very large and flavorful.  The meat was extremely tender and well spiced.  This was probably the best gyro I'v eaten in a long time. Also ordered the combo kabob platter.  The grilled meat tasted very authentic and the hummus was very good as well.", "business_id": "4rr-CJp0jMKr-kg9wnrTdw", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-10-24", "type": "review"}

Went for lunch after recently returning to the valley of the sun. Not much to write about my lunch. Portion was small. just some breaded chicken some sickeningly sweet sauce and some walnuts. Boring. I had the hot and sour soup that was oddly thick and had WAY too much tofu. The place inside was dark and old and seemed dirty. The bathroom opens to the dining area, so that made it seem worse. Probably wont be back. Disappointing. I remember something better. but maybe its because i was young and hadnt experienced a better place.", "business_id": "PNrOTfMmE0CJFV9YwSLzYw", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-11-16", "type": "review"}

He asked the lady there for a fade, to shave ALL the sides off, and to leave one inch on the top. However, he spent an extra 20minutes there trying to explain to her what a fade was. He explained it to her four times after she grabbed out a pair of scissors and cut his all the hair on his head down to an inch. He repeated to her that he wanted the sides faded, so again...she said ok and kept snipping the scissors to get the hair shorter. My brother at this point needed to tell her a fade is done with electric clippers. \nHe was ready to get another person to get his hair finished but the only other lady was busy. Generally, patient and easygoing but he was very unsatisfied with the entire experience. We currently had to be at a Verizon and it's so embarrassing because he has all the small pieces of hair all over his face! He was very disappointed, but not surprised that she did a horrible job at cleaning up the mess after the hair cut. Horrible place, stay far far away especially if you are picky about how well your hair gets cut", "business_id": "BVJlVm8w5ioi-S6GrY_ZnQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-09-05", "type": "review"}

But wait...Cigna pays set amounts for out of network. Final price? About $160 less thru AmBest. Got the glasses several days later.

A strange bubble had formed on my gum-line one morning, and even though it didn't hurt, I was anxious that it was an abscess. \n\nI had just moved to the area and didn't have a new dentist yet. I also didn't have dental insurance yet figured I might as well go straight to a specialist since I would be paying out of pocket. I picked this local office because it has perfect ratings on yelp. I called at 11am and the receptionist was so kind to me as I explained to her my situation. She was able to slip me in for a 3:30pm appointment that day. I was so grateful they were able to get me in at the last minute!\n\nI arrived and I got brought in without much wait time. They did 3D imaging of my teeth which was very easy and painless, as well as an apical bitewing. I really appreciated the thoroughness of my evaluation. My endodontist that came to see me was Dr. Hamberlin who was very friendly and empathetic. It was indeed what I suspected, an abscess! He explained to me what may have occurred and drew on the digital imaging to help me understand my tooth situation. He quickly made a referral to an oral surgeon who was also wonderful. \n\nI had a really good experience during a time that was rather stressful. The office consult was $99, but I felt it was worth it because they were able to bring me in on such a short notice and I wasn't charged extra for my digital imaging.
