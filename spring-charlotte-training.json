They are impossible to reach by phone, and do not return messages or emails.  They charge patients their co-pay even on preventative visits such as biometric screenings and physical exams what are already covered at 100% by most insurance plans.  They also bill the insurance company for a full physical exam, when they aren't actually performing one. Mine lasted less than 5 minutes and the physician didn't even touch me!  The billing staff are as rude as they come, and could care less about anything or anyone.  I know that Blue Cross is currently investigating.

I went to town on it when I got home and could verify it wasn't going to upset my stomach.\n\nThe asparagus - yum, it had a very smokey flavor.  It wasn't your standard grilled asparagus.\n\nFinally I had the hush puppies.  This...now let's take a minute here.....it's actually a hollowed out hush puppy with a shrimp filling that is all kinds of yummy.  Oh, it was just the bee's knee's.  I'm totally doing this place a disservice with the description above b/c the hush puppies were on point.  And very unique.  \n\nOh and for dessert, a mini pecan pie with chocolate chips.  Yummm.\n\n\nOur server was also excellent.  It was just myself and a friend and we are quite chatty and so was our server.  So I liked that too.\n\nTo recap - I'm giving them 5 stars...so Mimosa Grill please don't let me down next time I visit you.", "business_id": "NTfUFk8GyOLL1uPbEO-pVg", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-03-15", "type": "review"}

I guess likeable for those who really just want chips.  We asked for extra salsa (and were charged I believe 50 cents extra for each tiny tub, woof!) to make it more pleasing.  Most of us got sandwiches, which sounded really good on the menu.  And in fact my philly style chicken sandwich was tasty enough... as long as I bit into a part that had cheese on it.  It was grilled chicken, peppers, carmelized onions and provolone on a bun.  But again, it was just a bit on the dry side, and there wasn't enough cheese on it to mask that.  One of my tablemates asked if she could get a dipped sandwich - the waitress seemed confused, so I guess they don't do that so much down here, but for anyone else who is confused that's dipping the whole sandwich into whatever juicy drippings came off of the meat on the sandwich.

It might not always be delivered with a smile, but it will get done promptly.\n\nAmbiance is pretty good. Manages to achieve a flashy, modern-ish look while still remaining understated.\n\nIt's in the food and drink where this place falls short. Neither of these is really anything special; Blue strikes me as \"just another pricey eclectic American restaurant.\" And that's a problem, especially here in Charlotte. Having places like Blue slinging par-for-the-course means that the restaurant scene here in town can't be innovative. I don't mean to be so hard on Blue... but it is a cornerstone of Uptown restaurants, so I think it should shoulder a larger share of the responsibility.\n\nLooking through the menu, it's the same-old, same-old: calamari with olives and sundried tomatoes, scallops wrapped in prosciutto, steaks and seafood, blah blah blah. For dessert, molten chocolate cake. Well, no shit, Charlie. Hey, Blue, the 90's called; they want their fucking dessert back. Also, last I checked you could get the same dessert at any number of sub-par chain restaurants. Sure, Blue does it better, but it's simply not inspiring.\n\nI do applaud Blue for having a seasonal menu, on which there is a Venison Loin and American Red Snapper. They also list gluten free options, which shows that someone is paying attention to both current trends and dietary needs. Nevertheless, the menu as a whole is tired and generally boring. \n\nDrinks were okay, with the wine list being the highlight. The by-the-glass selection was both high quality and comprehensive. Mixed drinks looked promising, but unfortunately did not live up to the quality that the descriptions seemed to indicate. I ordered a Fig Sidecar, which was very poorly mixed, while a friend was not impressed with the New Fashioned.\n\nSometimes, it's cool to have a place that serves classic drinks and entrees, but I don't think Blue fits that bill.

The sauce is very flavorful, and they'll even make it with less oil upon request.  \n\nI know several people who love the noodle dishes, and it does seem to be a lot of food for a decent price.  The service here is quick and efficient.  You can get in and out at lunch time in 30 minutes or less.  If you get your order to go, check the bag to see if you have enough soy or other sauces.  I find that 2 packets of soy aren't enough for me, so I always have to ask for extra.", "business_id": "hBscDTusN57Ai0SnkQK8Sg", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-04-17", "type": "review"}

I had a suit and a dress that I needed dry cleaned, as well as fixing the buttons.  I was in the market for a place to dry clean, as I had not yet used this service in Charlotte.  This place is close to home and had good reviews, so I decided to try them.\n\nI spoke for quite a while to the gentleman working.  He told me that they do all their cleaning in-house (with the exception of some extraordinary stains), let me know when I could pick them up, and gave me approximate prices.  They have a bar code system in place to keep track of all the items you bring in.  If you drop your clothes off on a Wednesday, you get 25% off.  I thought their prices were reasonable; I had a three piece suit, dress, and the repairs for around $29.  They also have a lady in on Tuesdays and Thursdays who does alterations, and those prices seemed quite reasonable as well.\n\nYes, I may have been able to find somewhere a little cheaper to get my clothes dry cleaned.  Still, I greatly appreciated the service and explanations that I got from the employees working there.  When I drop my clothes off, I want to know that the people I leave them with are going to take care of what I brought.

In need of a prescription and not having much time to find a doctor,  I made an appointment with Dr. Stephens.  The woman I spoke to on the phone was Terry.  Terry's attitude through the entire phone call was snappy. She cut me off every time I started to speak.  I assumed she was just really busy and didn't let that sway my opinion.  \n\nAppointment day arrives.  I walked into the office and felt like I had entered into my early  90s doctor's office.  Awful old chairs,  the decor was terrible,  and the fluorescent lighting was so bright it hurt my eyes.  I signed in and was given the usual paperwork.  As I'm trying to listen to Terry to see what exactly I'm supposed to fill out,  there are a few people in the waiting area laughing and carrying on a conversation.  It made it extremely hard to hear what Terry was saying.  When I asked her if she could repeat herself she rolled her eyes and sighed.  Oh yeah,  god forbid you have to explain something twice.  \n\nI didn't have to wait too long for the nurse,  about 5 minutes.  I believe her name was Gail,  she was very nice... however, when I was trying to speak to her she also cut me off and spoke over me. The exam room I was in had posters taped to the wall,  it didn't appear dirty,  just kind of slapped together like a dorm room. \n\nEnter Dr. Stephens... she kind of spoke with me about my history,  and then launched into a lecture about me not having insurance. Excuse me,  no matter how well intentioned your speech may be,  it's inappropriate.  You do not know the specific circumstances surrounding my situation. It made me really uncomfortable.... now,  I've had some health problems before,  so having a vaginal exam is not only extremely uncomfortable,  but I'm always anxious during it.  Her lecturing me made me feel even more anxious.  As she started the exam it was VERY,  VERY uncomfortable, and I was trying to convey that to her and she said the standard, \"If you would just RELAX,  this wouldn't be so bad\" and then pushed my leg out of her way.  Thank you for totally disregarding the fact that I'm so anxious I'm drenched in sweat... and thanks for ignoring that I'm trying to voice my state of discomfort by just talking over me.  \n\nI was so glad it was over.  When I went to pay I had to go to Terry. Funny,  when she was taking my payment she was remarkably pleasant.  \n\nIf I have to have any further testing or treatments I'll be going somewhere else.  This place just made me feel so uncomfortable.\n\n***Went to pick up my prescription today,  Dr. Stephens prescribed the wrong pill.  Which is hilarious because in the exam room when I was trying to tell her,  \"It's XYZ, and I think it's this dosage,  but I'm not 100% sure,  it's in my records....\" she cut me off acting like she knew exactly what pill I was taking.  Unbelievably angry. Do not go here,  it's an utter disgrace.", "business_id": "jmHing2kjywBhQlZKsgD_w", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-04-03", "type": "review"}

I've never been to Italy at all. \n\nSo I'll say this instead: This is not what qualifies as \"Good Italian American.\"\n\nI've enjoyed Mama Ricotta's catering before, and even dinner several times over the last decade. But tonight, despite not having to pay, having two glasses of Chianti, and having the gal at the bar give me her phone number, I was disappointed. \n\nJamal served us with precision and a smile. One busboy was nice enough to crumble bread on my jacket, then look down at my jacket as if its presence offended him.\n\nThe rolls...these are dinner rolls, coated in oil. They stiffened within minutes, which generally says they spent time in a microwave. \n\nThe oily rolls also came with a dish full of oil. A dish of oil is a decent gesture in most Italian restaurants, but this oil was spicy. And more spicy than I prefer. But if you are from that Italian village where they dip oily rolls in spicy oil, this is your place. \n\nThe highly recommended Warm Goat Cheese and Mascarpone Dip was pleasant tasting. Rich marinara surrounding creamy mascarpone, with bread of proper consistency. In fact, I wish they served a version of this bread as their dinner bread. The presentation could be better. Looked like a dying sunflower made of bread.\n\nFor the main course, I chose Pasta Primavera. While flavorful, and a big heaping plate, this was also heavy laden in oil. A deep pool of oil.\n\nMy benefactor ordered angel hair pasta with tomato basil sauce plus shrimp.

The menu is extensive though a strange combination of Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Indian and maybe more...but I guess it's a little of something for everyone.\n\nWe started with Vegetable Tempura that had onions, mushrooms, and zucchini (minus broccoli since he doesn't prefer it).  It was okay, not the best I've ever had, but not the worst either.\n\nI ordered the Curry Chicken and it was good.  Not too spicy, maybe could've had a tad more spice.  Chicken was tender and well flavored and veggies were cooked through but not soggy.  The flavor was good, but I have had better curry dishes elsewhere. \n\nHe ordered the Basil Beef.  They delivered Chicken (not sure if it was Basil Chicken but it was spicy!).  So we tasted the chicken first before they took it back to exchange it for the correct dish which was on it's way.  Both were good - the beef was tender and flavorful and the veggies in both dishes looked good.\n\nOur glasses stayed full and the waitress was friendly enough and very helpful even though she'd only been with the restaurant for three months, so that was a plus.\n\nI might try Cuisine Malaya again and give them another chance if I was in the area, but I wouldn't make a special trip.", "business_id": "MMNBgMQCdwyVoNaHg0h_QA", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-05-26", "type": "review"}
