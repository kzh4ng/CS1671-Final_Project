The main floor was at capacity but we were told to go back through the kitchen and downstairs into the basement. It was utilitarian, to be sure (cinder blocks, plastic deck furniture) but not really a problem.\n\nThe terrible aspect of it--and the reason this wasn't more stars--was the service. Our waitress was either dealing with all the tables upstairs as well or just didn't know what was going on, because she seemed totally and utterly bewildered (beyond the usual frazzled state of a busy waitress).

Katie K., her sister, and I were wandering around downtown Pittsburgh on a Sunday night and many other things were closed. We stopped briefly to look at the menu that was laid on a table outside, and a nice old man came right out and invited us in. So we followed him.\n\nIt's a cramped little space, made even more so by the insane amount of Greek relics/touristy items everywhere. Even on a Sunday night, though, the place had a good and varied crowd ranging from teens to families to old men hanging around.\n\nOur waiter, who I found out later was the owner, was odd in a fantastic way. He just was bright and quick, and obviously loved his lot in life.\n\nWe started with the Hummus ($4) which came with fresh, hot pita bread. The bread was great, but I didn't enjoy the hummus (too bland). We each had a glass of the house wine (red and white) (~$3?) which were delicious. I ordered the Lamb Kebab ($12.95) which came with some grilled veggies and rice pilaf on the plate but also included a soup/salad. I loved the soup. LOVED it. It was a milky broth with rice. Sounds odd, but perfect for me as I was getting over a cold, and went well with the pita bread from before. The grilled veggies were good, and I really liked the rice pilaf. The lamb kebab was not bad, but Katie K's was so tough she didn't eat much of it. I did not have the same problem, though we'd order the chicken next time.\n\nWe finished the night with Baklava ($3) and the famous Onassis Dessert ($3). The owner regaled the entire place with the story of how he worked on the Jackie O yacht for years and this was her favorite dessert. Goodness, I can understand why. It looks like a simple slice of vanilla cake but it's so much more, with a honey syrup and whipped cream with cinnamon. I want it. I want it now.\n\nOverall, it was a 3-star kind of place. Good but not great. The dessert and wine were top notch, but it lost points on the main entree and the price (which I thought would be reasonable but topped out at $25 a person with tip!).

The owner or one of the staff is often outside encouraging patrons to check out the menu and come inside.  It may seem odd in Pittsburgh since most other places don't do that,  but it is fairly typical in other cities.\n\nI've been to Christos several times now and been happy with each visit.  The biggest down side for me is that they can be very pushy, especially if the owner is waiting on you.  Also, they will ask if you want hummus and pita when you first sit down.  While it is absolutely worth getting (I love the flavor of the hummus) note that it is NOT a free item like getting bread at another restaurant might be.  Just be aware so you aren't surprised when you see it on your bill.\n\nThey have a red and a white house made wine.  They are both pretty sweet, but tasty.  I just wish the glasses were larger.  They are in pretty tiny glasses.\n\nTry the Saganaki!  You can't go wrong with flaming, gooey tasty cheese.  Just be aware that when they bring it to your table, they will scream 'Opa!\" and either whistle or bang.  That really caught us by surprise.\n\nThe food is by no means gourmet, especially in presentation, but it is tasty and home made.  That has positives and negatives.  For example, I had the ground beef/noodle dish (can't remember the name and don't want to butcher it).  It was very tasty, but usually it has bechemel sauce over the top of it.  It was a little dry without it and I was told they don't have any to add on since it is baked right into the dish.   \n\nMost meals come with soup or salad, rice and roasted veggies.  The salads have a nice mix of veggies (tomatoes, green and red peppers and cucumbers) olives and even apples.  There is feta cheese and a nice and light dressing.  A perfect way to start your meal.\n\nTheir \"famous\" dessert is the Jackie O.  My husband tried it and loved it but I wasn't overly impressed.  They do offer several dessert selections including the staple baklava.\n\nIf you are in the cultural district and enjoy greek/comfort food, I suggest a visit to Christos.", "business_id": "PxP19Rb88OQKiSMl2oWNsg", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-02-27", "type": "review"}

Huge portion, perfectly deep-fried, with a really nice, light texture.  Love the falafel, but I prefer tahini sauce, and these come with a yogurt mint sauce.  Don't get me wrong, this is clearly their regional interpretation, Im all about the authentic experience, and this was good sauce.  But, I confess that for my leftovers I'm making some tahini sauce.\n\n- Hummus.  You know, hummus is always a crap shoot for me.  I make my own, from dried chick peas, and I've been working on this recipe for 25 years (along with my Bloody Mary recipe and about a hundred others). This is another of those regional interpretation issues, this was my least favorite today.  I'll try it again, because my own hummus has on and off days.  This was just more on the bland side than I expected,  No one distinct flavor dominated so I felt like it was left with an almost indescribable flavor.  Not bad, totally edible, just oddly unflavored.  I added some lemon and salt, which helped some.  \n\nSarma - if you're expecting dolmathes this will be familiar in flavor, but it texture.  These are served cold with a yogurt dipping sauce.  I'm okay with the temperature, but I just like a little lemon on mine.  These are veg, the rice filling is cooked down to a coarse 'risotto-y' consistency.  I dig them, but those who prefer the snap of dolmathes will find these softer, but just as flavorful\n\nAll in all, outstanding.  Next time, shish tahouk and baba ganouj.", "business_id": "Ryq600aoE3h8_qRQGIed9A", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-12-08", "type": "review"}

Aggressive herbal flavors perfectly matched with a spike of lemony acidity.  My wife LOVED her falafel sandwich...which is really saying something, as she's somewhat of connoisseur.

It's a Mediterranean place owned by three Asian women.  Toni, Suki & Felice do a great job.  They bought the place from a Mediterranean family in 89 or 90 and have being doing it up ever since.\n\nNow, I don't know how authentic all of the dishes are, but they are super tasty!  The hummus is wonderful and creamy with the warm pita.  The lentil soup is delish, creamy and full of flavor.  I love the rosemary chicken & pasta dish too.  Greek salads are always fresh and crispy.  The chicken shushka is my absolute favorite -- shredded chicken cooked in a tomatoey broth over rice.  It's spicy and warm in your tummy!  I also always get a side of grilled veggies -- carrots and zucchini, I don't know how them make them taste so good.\n\nThe atmosphere is really casual, but the service is great.  If you're in here more than two or three times, the ladies will remember you.  Especially Suki -- she's the real character of the bunch.  Nothing fancy here -- paper napkins and no tablecloths.   It's almost like being at your crazy Asian auntie's house when she's having Mediterranean night.  \n\nThe wine list is just ok, so stick to Athenian beer and you'll be good to go.  Special orders are no problem and take out is easy too.\n\nParking can be a bit of a problem, as Med House is in the same strip mall at Richardson's and Dick's Hideaway.

Heidi E. and I are friends, but sometimes friends don't agree. Maybe it's a matter of different tastes, or even different experiences, who knows, but I have a very different take on Med House.\n\nI've been eating at Mediterranean House regularly for the last 6 or 7 years. Started with a group of business friends for occasional lunches, then for dinners with my partner, and now it's a couple times a month for take out. (Have to say I prefer take-out for a few reasons: convenient, neighborhood spot; food travels well; only beer + wine when dining in.)\n\nI find the food here to generally be great - though not always consistent, have had one or two just so-so dinners. That said, when the kitchen is on, the food can be spectacular. We usually order the same few dishes - one of the chicken plates and the gyros platter. \n\nMy favorite chicken plate is the Olympic Chicken, which is grilled chicken breast with a really delicious black olive sauce. The Moroccan Chicken is also really good, and maybe a little healthier with it's herbed breasts, honey-yogurt sauce and side of carrots, apple and spinach (which is not cooked, just shredded, but surprisingly good.) If you want rich flavor, go for the Egyptian Chicken, which is pan-fried in parmesan cheese and herbs. If you want spicy, go for the Chicken Shushka, which is more stew-like, flavored with lots of paprika. \n\nThe Gyros platter is a standard favorite, though Med House does it a little different. No shredded lamb here - instead, you get 4 long pieces of juicy, tender meat. I think the quality is better this way, and it makes for a nice dinner presentation. Pita and house-made yogurt-cucumber sauce are still the perfect accompaniments, and If you like spicy, ask for the spicy green sauce - some kind of minced hot green peppers - the flavors match the gyros meat perfectly.\n\nHummus and Baba Ganouj appetizers are just OK, I suggest the Lentil soup instead - vegetarian, made from scratch, delicious and hearty. Salad is OK as well - dressing can be a little too citrus-y or vinegar-y for my taste, but always fresh feta and crisp veggies. Love the rice pilaf, with almonds and apricots, and the 2 pasta sides - fettucine with creamed spinach or angel hair pasta with sundried tomato and feta - both are rich with flavor.\n\nIf you're interested in trying Mediterranean House, I suggest sooner rather than later, as the strip mall where they're located may be seeing some major changes. The building owner has told tenants he'll not be guaranteeing any leases, and most tenants are already gone. Unfortunately, if Med House loses their lease, they may not reopen at all. I'm pretty sad about that, and a couple nights a month I'm sure my stomach and taste buds will be, too.", "business_id": "FltN1Hnw4n7BORXJH1kaeg", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-02-27", "type": "review"}

DAMN YOU TO HELLLLLLlllll!), said, \"Hey a'hole, let's go here for lunch.\" or something like that and I replied, 'Right on, bi'ch!' or something like that and I've been in love ever since; except on Mondays (I don't like Mondays *tell me why* I don't like Mondayyys...). \n\nMondays the service is really bad (please note business hours). Every other time I've been (I've only done lunch, penciled that shit in and everythin', yo!) and the service was exceptional. Never you mind the previous naysayer reviews about the service being poor, those people that wrote that were obviously paid by jihadi extremists who are trying to destroy the lovely owners of Bybols because they love America. You know they love us as soon as you bite into anything they've made. The homos was the first thing to touch my lips, so creamy and warm and I swear (I don't believe in a god/s by the by) that I heard the National Anthem play with the first bite. How could someone that doesn't love America give us such wonderful food? They couldn't! PROOF! F U terrorists and mercenary reviewer bastards!\n\nAfter the National Anthem finished playing (it always plays every time I eat there but this particular time I was solo) I was serve a Lebanese beer (Almaza or something like that) that the owner recommended to go with my dish which he also recommended. oh em gee golly wiz! Lamb roasted in stomach lining with rice (can't remember what the dish was called; it was a special that day) and garnish and \"to kill for\" lentil soup. So good! Forget the virgins or white grapes or whatever translation you read this dish would be reward enough in this world not to ever want to be die a martyr.\n\nAfter I recovered a bit from the food coma to pay my bill and leave I stopped to convert to Islam and grab a mint or handful and joyfully walked out the door.\n\nThe care put into the few dishes I've had here seems to follow through into everything about Byblos. Please, stop by and try something, you will enjoy it more than these words can tell. There is so much I still need to love there that I have yet to even try.

I ordered a whiskey ginger ale. \nThey do not have ginger ale. They have soda water and pepsi that they will give to you without warning. After returning the first set of drinks we got a second drink which was supposed to be 7up and scotch. It wasnt. I don't know what it was, but it wasn't what i ordered. I couldn't taste any scotch and my drink was still a caramel color. \nThe owners were constantly over our shoulders begging for praise and attention. \nAfter getting our weak drinks we got our hummus which was not terrible but i wasn't impressed. \nWe all ordered our food from the female half of ownership who was insistent on us ordering the lamb. None of us are plain lamb fans so after repeatedly declining her offer we were able to order. Our server went into the back to cook our food and the busser brought out our soup. The Lentil soup lacked flavor, i was upset because it looked amazing. The tomato soup was good. Not extraordinary, but good. \nNext we received our meals.  Gyro salad, beef kabob, gyro kabob and some other kabob i cannot pronounce. Ground beef in the shape of a sausage-turd. Either way, the meat was very dry, in all cases and kind of unpleasant to eat. Large chunks of unexpected toughness in my meat. The rice was plain, and lacked substance. I was hungry enough where i finished my meal, i cant say the same about the rest of my company even being as hungry as we were after a long day of traveling. After warding off the owner for a fifth and sixth time, we had to ask for our check and to go boxes which we decided upon not using anyway.

I will never do that again!\n\nBiggest issue:  The bill came and I noticed just about 30% added to the bill as \"tax\" ... yes, 30%!  When I asked the server about it, he said that that includes 18% as service fee and 8.1% as tax ... and that that is explained in the menu.  I have several issues with this:\n\n1. Shame on me for not reading the menu and the fine print ... my mistake, but if you are reading this review, you don't have to make this mistake.\n\n2. Why am I forced to leave an 18% tip?  The tip is not at my discretion.  If the server is not helpful, I can't express myself in any way.  \n\n3. Why is listed as \"tax\"?  I bet you most people do not even see it and add tip on top of it automatically!!!  That is stealing!\n\n4. Now, it gets worse:  I asked the server that if there is an 18% service fee plus an 8.1% tax, that adds up to 26.1%.  So, why is there an almost 30% charge?  They add 8.1% to the bill and then they add 18% tip on top of it.  So, the effective percentage for tip is higher than 18%.\n\nFood:  It was no special in any way.  I am very familiar with Persian food.  I have had it in many cities and many countries.  I look for Persian restaurants everywhere I go.  This restaurant is not bad but it is not good either.  The food in NO WAY justifies the prices they charge!  I had chicken with bones, and it was not cooked well.  For appetizer, we had tadig which the crispy rice that is cooked in the bottom of the pan, and we had it with two kinds of stew.  Tadig was good but not enough for 6 people.  Stews were OK, but again not special.\n\nService:  It was OK.  The server was not really pleasant: smiling or welcoming.  He was not rude or anything, but I felt like we were bothering him being there.  And the place was not busy.  The service in NO WAY justified more than 18% in tip.  But think about it the guy didn't care because he knew he will get his tip any way.  \n\nI will not recommend this place:  not for food, not for service and not for being overcharged!", "business_id": "QkVSaXjg5475VD3sZixCZQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-01-13", "type": "review"}
