First visit, a mechanic talked me out of getting my brakes repaired after I came in expressing concern about a grinding deeling I experience when I back up. Nothing is wrong, its just the brakes adjusting after it rains he said. Your brake pads & shoes have 40% left he said. A month later I was at Lexus getting my shoes AND rotors replaced. AND was told the front had 5% wear left... and like an idiot, I returned fir my last free oil change (2 free preferred oil changes from Groupon). From the beginning I should've turned around. I came in expressing I ONLY want my preferred oil change because they dropped the ball on the brakes. After explaining the last situation, there was no offer to rectify the matter in any way. A mechanic doing the oil change brought me to the back to show me my front brakes like I didn't just tell him what he was telling me. Then told me I need an air filter. Smh. Simple quick fix. I tell him to add it. Can't mess that up right? Wrong. It took an extra 35 mins to add the add filter. Then I get my bill and see they've only done a BASIC oil change. No topping of fluids, no rotating of my tires... so I ask what oil change did you do? The mechanic says Basic. And I asked, what does the Groupon say? He says Preferred. And I said, my car requires a synthetic blend. And what happened to my tired rotation? The mechanic said oh we rotated the tires too; I watched him do it. Everything that should've been done is handled miss. I go outside, and the same chalk marking that was there on my left rear tire, is still there, on the left rear. Smh. I was already late for my next appointment and beyond sick of this ordeal so I left. And the ENTIRE time this disaster is happening, the store manager is periodically coming out to greet everyone who comes in EXCEPT me.

The compressor is not coming on which is a $500 repair.

He also gives me a quote to keep going to see if there is something else going on.  I take that option and hope for a miracle.  \n\nAfter hooking it up to \"the machine\" and putting some dye through the system, he finds out there is also a leak. He gives me a quote for the new part which he would need to order.  I decide to take it (about $175 for the part and labor).  He got the part same day and fixed the A/C.  He explained everything to me with a diagram and showed me exactly what was wrong and what he was going to fix.  He also was very upfront and shared that while although the A/C is running cold now the compressor will eventually need to be replaced because it is damaged.\n\nMy only disappointment was that it took nearly 5 hours of me sitting there and waiting.  However, I was a walk-in with no appointment and he had to go get a part for me.  \n\nOn a side note, I did really appreciate him helping me get my laptop connected to an outlet.  I needed a three prong outlet and there were none around me.  He went into the shop and brought out an extension cord, hooked it up behind the desk and got me situated.  Honestly, I'm going back here for any other services I need.  I really do trust, Josh.  He did not push me to go forward with fixing it because he was not 100% sure it would work.

When I dropped off the Prius the night before it's service appointment, my neighbor followed me over and told me that one of my brake lights was out (how would I know??!!).  I stopped by Rick's on my way to work at 9 AM the next morning, in my old beaten up van, to tell them to please add that light to the list of things they were to do -- and guess what?  Not only had they found and fixed it, they were DONE with the Prius!  (It took O'Brian's all day to replace four spark plugs!)  I was so pleased with the low bill that I left my van and took the Prius to work that day.  I told them no hurry, but that O'Brian's had quoted me a $2,000 fee to fix the AC's slow leak, and I wanted Rick's to see if THEY could give me a better price.  A week later they called (twice, because I failed to call them back after the first message) to get my approval to re-fix the brakes (Midas' \"fix\" had left it without fluid, DUH), and replace the rusted out straps about to drop the gas tank onto the street.  The next day it was all done.  The AC problem was simple:  they refilled the freon and, when it held for an hour, added a sealant.  Brilliant!  So now I have AC, brakes, and a gas tank that will stay in the van, all for about $600.  I'm thrilled.  After 40 years of having cars fixed in this town, and being overcharged or disappointed, or having to go back again and again, I have found my men!  James worked on the van.  Cudos, James.  No longer do I dread a MAINT REQRD light on the dashboard.  These guys know their stuff and do it quickly, efficiently, and competently.  They're a rare find these days.", "business_id": "-StiqyQX9YxKb6VYp2DRfg", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-05-26", "type": "review"}

He was much more hands-on with my bumper than any of the other 4 places I went to get estimates. He explained every last detail of my repair on a computer that showed all the repairs they were going to make. The price on the estimate itself was competitive with other shops in the area but not the lowest. However, the initial interactions I had with Charlie made me feel comfortable with going to this shop despite not spending the absolute lowest price possible. \n\nHowever, once I had put my car in for repairs, I found the customer service of this office to be incredibly lacking. I turned my car in on a Monday morning and was told that it would be done on Tuesday near the end of the day. After receiving no calls from them, I called their office late Tuesday afternoon and was told it would take another day. The same thing happened on Wednesday, and my car was finally done on Thursday afternoon. At no point did I ever receive a call with an update on my car's progress. I had to call at every step of the way and extract the information from them myself. I will take them at their word and assume that these delays were legitimate. But the fact that they were not forthcoming with these delays does leave some shadow of a doubt as to whether or not they were due to circumstances beyond the shop's control.\n\nAs for the repairs themselves, the bumper looks good as new and the paint job matched perfectly. Overall, a 3-day repair is not too far outside the normal time window for service from other shops in the area. A big plus was that my car was washed and vacuumed on the inside when it was returned to me. This was a much welcomed amenity given that my car had been excessively dirtied thanks to the winter weather.\n\nIt is currently one month after the repairs have been completed and I have no complaints about the work done on my car whatsoever. However, I emphasize again that I find it incredibly unprofessional and discourteous that I was not informed of the changes in the schedule of my car repair. I feel that repair shops should be incredibly forthcoming with this information given that people who have their car in a shop have to make alternative transportation arrangements and oftentimes have to rearrange their daily routines such as work. \n\nOverall, great work, competitive pricing, but on the back end be prepared to be a little more proactive in getting the needed information. To be quite frank it seems like this is a top notch shop, but I would rate my particular interaction with them as slightly less reflective of that rating.", "business_id": "lPySbFYBYXW1zepKUV4euQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-03-17", "type": "review"}

But here's the summary: they're a good, dependable local business that has earned their strong reviews. \n\nOriginal review: \n\"My car died on a Sunday. I had AAA come out and do a diagnostic.  I was hoping it was just a battery problem, and they could fix it and be done with it. The AAA guy worked with my car for almost an hour, but the starter was shot, so I had to have it towed.  I decided to have it towed to this shop because it's around the corner from my house, I like to support local businesses, and all the reviews were so positive.  Robert called me early in the morning and he was initially very friendly.  He told me they would do a diagnostic test for $64.99 and call me back.  I declined the test (because two different AAA guys already told me the problem), and his response was deeply patronizing: \"Wow, well, if you feel confident that *you* know the problem, sure I can give you a quote for the starter.\"  His quote was $500.  I called a couple other shops, including my trusted mechanic in Tempe, who all quoted me around $300.  I called back and asked if $500 was the best they could do.  Robert offered me a different starter (\"it's decent, and it just has a 1 year warranty\") for $414.  I understand that all shops have different prices, but I am disappointed. I won't be giving them my business.\"\n\nUpdate:\nShortly after I posted the review, the owner of the shop (Matt) called to discuss the situation. We chatted, he took down some information, and called me back later in the day.  We talked for a long time about labor costs, parts and vendors, how shops arrive at estimates, etc. He was professional and courteous. I haven't yet decided whether I will ask them to fix my car; I'm updating the review mostly because I agree with Matt's replies to other comments below -- that price quotes alone aren't worthy of bad reviews and that if we have a mechanic we like, we should stick with them.  I left a bad review because I didn't like the way Robert spoke to me *and* because the price quote was dramatically different than other places. I felt exploited because I was vulnerable -- my car was towed there and I was stuck. (I couldn't go to my mechanic because he was too far away and I was running between my two jobs.)  I'm fixing it because Matt has a lot of integrity as a shop owner and I'm grateful he took the time to research the situation and offer me a better solution.  In yelp-speak, everything is A-OK, and I would recommend them to others.", "business_id": "M-MFa0YErVBbFW2IJhGJmw", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-03-02", "type": "review"}

After driving my truck for a day, I could tell the problem was not fixed and even felt worse.\n\nRather than go back to the dealer, I thought it was a good time to sever ties and try some place new. They had to keep my truck a few days to fully diagnose and repair the issue and actually took the time to drive the truck, first to recreate the problem, then to be sure it was fixed. Doesn't seem like a big deal, but the dealer clearly did not do this. They kept me updated throughout the process (what tests they were running, possible causes and next steps), offered me rides to and from the shop and a loaner car when they had to keep my truck a few days. Turned out to be a spark plug issue, adding to my frustration with the dealer, as the technician there had even written, \"probable spark plug issue\" on my receipt/work order, yet failed to fix it. However, their lack of follow through and poor customer service forced me to find these guys, who I feel like I can trust, so all is good in the end.\n\nI went into the situation a little standoffish because I knew my fix would be expensive, but I left feeling good about the service I received.

Thankfully I stumbled onto MB Motors.  It was the only business that I'd ever researched that had nothing but 5 star reviews...too good to be true?  NOPE.  It's about 25 miles from our home, so it's not the most convenient, but there's no other place that I'll even consider taking my Benz.  \nMy most recent experience will explain exactly why.  We were driving from Seattle back to Goodyear last fall, and knowing that the tires were getting pretty thin, I made an appointment to have new tires installed along the way (in Oregon, no sales tax!).  Everything worked exactly as planned; we were in and out of the tire shop in about an hour...just enough time to have lunch.  A couple of hundred miles down the road the trouble began.  The traction control warning light illuminated...what now?  After looking through the manual we finally figured out how to deal with (disable) it; but it was persistent, illuminating almost every time we stopped for a break.  I called a Mercedes dealer and was told that it was safe to drive, just not in \"slippery\" conditions.  OK, fine, we won't go skiing.\nA couple of days after our return to the Phoenix area we found ourselves running some errands in the general neighborhood of MB Motors, so I decided to stop in and make an appointment to get this annoying problem taken care of.  The good folks at MB jumped right in trying to figure out what was causing this to happen...thinking and hoping (like I was) that it was something simple.  After about an hour of testing, tinkering with, and driving it (of course the darn light wouldn't come on with them looking!), they announced \"GOT IT!\"  \nWell folks, it turns out that the tire shop had inadvertently installed the correct size tires on one side of the car, and a slightly different size on the other side, which caused the traction control computer to warn us of a stability problem.  \nAs you already know if you're an MB customer, they refused to charge me for their diagnosis, and even called the nearest tire store (same national chain) to explain the problem and get the ball rolling for replacement of the two incorrect tires.  As an aside, I can't help but wonder if I'd ever have figured out that the tires were different sizes if the car wasn't so darn smart...smarter than me obviously. \nThis place is simply the best...thank you!     \n\nClark", "business_id": "0Xnduj9w6aYHOtN_RlHUng", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-04-22", "type": "review"}

It's always a depreciating investment, and usually a pain in the behind.\n2 - Car dealerships and sales people are THERE TO MAKE MONEY.  The odds of finding somebody that is willing to eliminate their bottom line to help you are slim.\n\nWith that being said, I was in the market for a car... knew exactly what it was that I wanted, had money for the down payment and a trade in, and was just looking for the right deal.  I had been to a few different dealerships, talked to a few sales reps - and in the end, I ended up purchasing my 2011 Sonata Limited from Coulter Cadillac.\n\nWhile I was test driving the car, I did notice that it pulled a tad bit... which ended up being a bigger problem for me than I had anticipated.  Because of traffic, I was not able to take it on the highway.  Once I finally did, which was the next day - I noticed that the car was shaking, bad.  Luckily I know enough about cars to know it was related to the tires, rims, or some sort of an alignment issue.\n\nI can't lie.... the next week or so for me was a real headache.  I was upset that I had bought a shaky car, and really just wanted it fixed.  I had spent the next week driving up to Phoenix to get my car looked at.  I was even given a loaner at one point in time.  Every time my car was given back to me, I was told that it was fixed, and it was not.  The last time was the charm, my car was picked up, and it is now back in my possession and working properly.\n\nSomething else that kind of irked me during this experience was the issues with my interlock device.  Yes... I have one in my car (thankfully it comes off in July).  While my car was being serviced, I had NUMEROUS violations because of missed retests.  Luckily, I have a good relationship with the guys that service the device on my car.... otherwise, I'd probably have to pay a $50 reset fine, and have the device on my car for somebody else's screw up.\n\nNOW... that I've done my \"complaining\" which was merely telling you the truth - I will say that the staff I was working with were very understanding and made it a point to take care of me, even AFTER my purchase.  So yes, the things I had to deal with were a pain - but they could have happened to anybody.... and I could have been ignored and still driving a shaky car.  BUT I'M NOT!  Which is great... and I LOVE my car!\n\nI recommend going over to Coulter, despite my headaches.

In the past year, business seems to have gone up to the point that they CANNOT MAINTAIN PREVIOUS LEVELS OF GOOD OLD FASHIONED \"MOM AND POP\" CUSTOMER SERVICE.  Maybe the perfect 5 star rating here has something to do with that, causing business to explode.  However, when this happens a business either expands, or customer service declines.  Precision imports does not seem to desire expansion, and their customer service has become inconsistent and disorganized.  \n\nTrust is vital with your mechanic, and Frank/Al broke trust with me in a few areas.  I trusted them up until the past year.  Earlier this year Al diagnosed my Nissan with a \"pinhole oil lead causing oil to pool in the back of my engine, replacement required around $500.  It's a very common problem in this model.\"  I have not seen any oil leaking from the Nissan, but they assured me \"just wait it's going to leak.\"  \n\nLater this year, the service engine light came on in my BMW.  I trusted that Precision Imports would run appropriate diagnostics.  They did not.  Instead, they insisted that I had \"run my car too low on gas, which caused the light to come on\" and rebuked me not do let the gas run too low in the future.  (I had not recently let my tank get too low, and it had been low in the past but never caused problems with the service engine light). They got the service engine light off, and charged me $45.  \n\nA few days later, the service engine light came back on.  I thought, ok, the problem must be more serious or a new problem.  I brought my car in.  After several days of waiting, I called to a rude response that they were \"extremely busy and just hold on we'll call you when it's ready!\"  I let it go, and let a few more days go by.  I called back again, and was returned \"It's been ready come and get your car!\"  When I pointed out the poor customer service politely, I was returned with \"Sorry we've been swamped.\"\n\nWhen I came to pick my car up, the reason given as to why the light was on astonished me: \"pinhole oil lead causing oil to pool in the back of my engine, replacement required around $500.  It's a very common problem in this model.\"  SAME SUPPOSED \"COMMON\" PROBLEM AS MY NISSAN WORD FOR WORD!  AND, they were unable to switch off my service engine light.  I just stared at him.  My read: FULL OF BS.  I said nothing regarding this diagnosis, paid, and left.\n\nI have googled this problem in both cars, and asked around a little.  Neither is a common problem in either car from what I\"ve found.  I was even told they have patch kits for the problem, which was never offered to me as an option.\n\nI should add that I also have had 2 \"underquotes\" on mechanical problems here.  I mean, quoted by phone at one cost, then when I go to pay it was higher.  When I've asked about the higher cost, i feel I was given lines of BS.\n\nWHY DOES A SECOND OPINION MATTER?\n\nThe next day I was driving my BMW.  Now call me a jackass for not opening my engine and checking the coolant, but the car was JUST serviced (including oil change, etc) at Precision Imports!  My car started smoking like crazy, and died on busy Bell road.  I was able to get the car into another auto shop.  They found out THE COOLANT WAS EMPTY.  THIS IS WHY THE SERVICE ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON.  The charge was $10.  PROBLEM SOLVED, smooth sailing since.  \n\nI have now taken both cars to 2 different mechanics.  Nothing has been discovered in the area of \"pinhole oil leak\" on either car.\n\nIt used to be that Frank always overstated the price a little, went above and beyond with communication, and took care of me.  He came across as an honest old school guy to me.  It's different now.  Frank's more detached.  I get the feeling Frank is eying retirement, and would prefer working on a much much lower volume of cars.  No comment on the younger guy Al.  Earlier this year when I brought my car in Frank said \"make sure you deal with me.\"  I didn't make much of it, but this could have indicated some other issue going on at the shop.  I did attempt to deal only with Frank this year, but his availability has been very low and he had to route me to Al and others.\n\nI saw a few guys in the shop with a lot of signs pointing to \"previously convicted felon.\"  I'm all about turning it around and 2nd chances, and I realize this can be a staple of many mechanic shops.   But, business is business and I didn't get a good feeling about a few of the newer mechanics in the shop.\n\nI gave them several second chances, and communicated my concerns honestly and appropriately.  But that's it for me.  They lost me as a customer.  I'm hoping that they can turn it around, but for starters they are going to need to lose more customers and reduce the extreme volume or expand to a new location.  \n\nIf you're going to use Precision Imports, MAKE SURE THE COST IS DEFINED BEFORE REPAIRS ARE MADE.  ON MAJOR ISSUES GET A SECOND OPINION.", "business_id": "WH0Q0CmYW00vnJpG37O_cw", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-04-15", "type": "review"}

Precision Imports had rave reviews on both Yelp and Car Talk's websites, so I figured I could trust them.  I have gone in twice and both times they were extremely professional, polite and have fixed my car issues quickly at a reasonable price. They are a little out of my way, but I'll happily drive the extra miles since I fully trust them to give my car the best care.\n\nHere's one example from over a year ago. I took my car into a Toyota dealership for a 30,000 mile check up and they came back with a quote of about $4000 to fix issues with my car that I didn't think even existed, plus my car was running fine! I ignored the Toyota dealership's suggestions. A few months later I drove to Utah, did some off roading and my check engine light came on a day later. I took my car into Precision Imports and they discovered that it was simply some minor alignment issues and fixed it for $45! I asked about the issues Toyota mentioned and they said they didn't find anything like that. Let's see, Toyota told me my car problems about 25,000 miles ago and my car is just fine (FYI: I have over 180,000 miles on my car).\n\nExample two from last week. I took my car into Walmart for an oil change and to check out a slow leak in one of my tires back in February.  They say they can't find anything wrong with my tire and suggest I get a new one. I put off buying a new tire and stick with just filling it up with air about once a week.  My check engine light goes on again. I took it in to Precision Imports for my next oil change and to see if they find anything wrong with my tire. Of course they do. They found a four inch nail in the tire, patched it up and the slow leak is gone. Oh, they plugged in something that Walmart probably left unplugged too. $72 for an oil change, patched tire and to check out and fix the check engine light situation.\n\nI don't know much about cars, but these guys...these are good guys.", "business_id": "WH0Q0CmYW00vnJpG37O_cw", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-04-04", "type": "review"}

I thought ok, my fault for not looking at the mileage. Two days later the truck is making a horrible noise and it sounds like the it is about to fall apart. I pull over only to find that the driver right front tire was in shreds! It turns out that the tire that blew was the wrong size for the rim. The rest were on their way because they were all dry-rotted. My boyfriends dad takes care of the tire issues, purchasing 4 brand new tires totaling over $460. I call him and go over the fact the tire that was on the front driver side was to big, and rotted on the inside hence the pull to the left. I explained this was ridiculous, first the mileage and now I could have been killed on the highway due to your neglect of tires on the vehicle. He (Jason) informed me the only thing they do to the tires is check the air pressure and that there was tread on it, and said there was tread on my tire. Let it go.It was about a week later, the lo-jack system in the truck starts beeping, I called Jason and he tells me that the payment is due. I told him on the paperwork the first payment wasn't due until the following week, he explained that to was wrong on the documents that we both reviewed and signed and that I needed to still come in to get the paperwork fixed on the mileage as well as the due dates for payments. Frustrated with this place i made the payment, I needed a vehicle to move. We move it's about 2 weeks later and the vehicle is spilling oil everywhere, didn't notice this before, now its all over my new driveway. I take it to my mechanic and he tells me I'm lucky this thing is still running, and goes over the list of things that needs to be fixed on the SUV. Call them again, talk to Jason, tell him about the oil, what my mechanic said and he tells me that they need to look at it to see if it can be fixed, and if it cant they will put me into another vehicle. I am ok with this. I drop off the vehicle at 8am two days later and they look at it and explain it was an easy fix. I'm happy, I explain again that I need to make sure I have a reliable vehicle since I work in Tempe and live in Maricopa. It was about a week later the check oil light came on, we put 3 quarts of oil in the car, two days later it starts knocking and trying to stall, we put 2 more quarts in the SUV. Two days later, it's shaking, sputtering, and stalls, wont start. We get it turned around and to the closest store to add more oil, get it home. Call and ask for Jason, he isn't there we speak to Joe, and Joe connects me with a Tow truck driver to tow the car to Auto Europa to look at it.I am speaking to the tow truck driver explaining  where I live, and the vehicle and he says Oh yea, the Gray Isuzu I know that vehicle.  This wasn't his first time towing this vehicle. I call the next day and they are too busy to look at it, and same comment the following day. Hector tells me its going to take up to 3 days because they have to take the heads in to a special shop. I called Friday the 24th it has been a week and  a half and Hector informs me that the engine is shot, they would have to replace the whole engine. I ask for Jason, he still isn't in. I feel like I am being avoided. I speak to Joe, Joe says well we can put a new engine in, I said I need a vehicle, and explained the conversation I had with Jason about if the vehicle doesn't work then he would put me into another one. Joe then informs me that I need a new deposit for another vehicle, and that when they buy back the vehicle that there will be a remaining 500-1000.00 rolled into the new loan. I explained that, that was ridiculous, why am I paying for a broken vehicle.I had no problems paying for the one I had, but to pay for a vehicle I don't own.

Brought the girlfriend's Passat in to have the service light checked, a/c checked, and it was making a strange noise. Wheel bearings, ac leak fixed, oil changed and tires rotated.

I thought that was automatically done after a rotation, but hey, I'm no mechanic! Offered a free oil change on her truck as compensation, and since she had brought it in anyway for its own a/c issue, she was happy with that. \n\nThis ordeal lasted over a week, dealing with multiple employees and manager. The first guy that worked on the Passat apparently quit that day, the next guy had to leave because his wife had a baby, etc. \n\nEduardo told her that all her hoses needed replaced and several other things, before he gave her a diagnosis of the problem we brought it in for in the first place. At this point, we just want to pick it up. So we do, and now the airbag light is blinking. Manager (Seth) refused to speak to us and then we were hung up on. \n\nPretty ridiculous. Not sure if this is because we are women or what, but us being female shouldn't have anything to do with the fact they don't seem capable of fixing a problem without causing a new one.
