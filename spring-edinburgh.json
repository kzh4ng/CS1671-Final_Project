After I got in, got a drink, and sat down, a huge group of guys on another stag event came in with their bags. It was about 1:30 pm, so clearly they just got off the train and couldn't check in either, so hit up The Doric for beer.\n\nThey did have a tasty selection of beers. The best in my opinion was the coconut porter, which wasn't overly coconut flavored, but did give a nice hint of coconut after you had a sip.\n\nOnce more people arrived, about four of us went upstairs to grab a bite. The restaurant seemed nice, and the menu looked interesting. Two of us had the cheeseburgers, one the haloumi stack, and one the macaroni and cheese. We also split some haggis spring rolls, because when you're in Scotland, you eat haggis.\n\nThe food was a major disappointment. The haggis spring rolls were literally just haggis inside of a spring roll wrapper and deep fried. No Asian influence at all. Maybe some cabbage or sprouts or something would have been nice, but no, just haggis in a wrapper. The burger was a major letdown. They made it seem so spectacular on the menu, but it was just a boring burger with boring chips. The other half asked for some of my ketchup with his macaroni and cheese, which is clearly a bad sign.

My own visit in July of 2014 took place exactly 1 day after the Queen had left.\n\nFirst off: I'd recommend a combined ticket for the palace and The Queen's Gallery, which is just opposite. There are changing exhibitions at The Queen's Gallery (during my visit there was one on Tudor-era portraits) - and THERE at least you can take photos. Inside the palace, photography is not allowed even for private use - which is a BIG minus in my book!\nOf course, there are the chapel ruin and the park, which are included in your ticket, and where you can take as many photos as you'd like.\n\nUpon entering, some nice ladies will try and sell you additional tickets (for a guided garden tour e.g.) - personally I did not see the extra benefit, so be brave.\n\nThe inside of the palace is as splendid as one would imagine, though modest compared to, say, Windsor Castle, or even Blenheim Palace. It's very much a limited-time summer retreat. The chapel ruin is impressive, as is the park. Altogether, certainly worth a visit and the moderate asking price.\n\nYou can relax at the not-bad caf\u00e9, which has inside and outside seating, after your visit. The selection of drinks and light food is rather good, though prices tend to be slightly inflated.

The orange juices came out, and I was really disappointed that they were the horrid British orange juice from concentrate that pops up way too often to make sense.

My friend and I each had the waffles with bacon and maple syrup. The waffles weren't terribly hot and were served with the maple syrup already poured over everything - an obvious mistake since it drenches the waffles and makes them soggy, and also doesn't let us customise how much syrup we want, or the quality of the pouring. I'm sounding like a snob here, but it seems really easy and logical for me to serve the syrup in a nice little pitcher so that customers can decide if they want syrup just in the middle (like I received) or evenly distributed in each waffle dent.

As other reviewers have said, the service is variable, usually fine, but sometimes I don't know, stern maybe?\n\nThere is lots of natural light despite being in perpetually balmy Scotland. I've been twice now and got breakfast both times (their breakfast menu ends at lunch time, but they do a full or full vegetarian till later in the day). The vegetarian haggis is not really what I imagine hangs to be. Usually with vegetarian, it is cooked like the regular but is just slightly smoother as it doesn't have those bits in (the suet I think), but the Southern Cross version seemed like basically kidney beans and barley mixed together, so  texture wise it was like chunky mashed potatoes. Anyway, it was alright as it's own thing, but I wouldn't call it veg haggis. \n\nThe first time I went, my friend was visiting and tried (real) haggis for the first time and said it was surprisingly good. I'm not sure if this is worth anything because he tends to only eat things that don't require utensils, and he ordered it as a challenge, expecting a monstrosity of organ parts, but still. It is an okay place to bring people if they want to try haggis cheap as there are filled rolls and what we got which were the bon bons. Not the best in the area, but not a commitment either if they don't like it.\n\nPrices are as expected, and it's a convenient location as it's by the train and just off the Royal Mile.

I'm starting to feel like a Pork Belly connoisseur these days but, with those accompaniments it was too hard to resist, the only competition coming from the Duck dish on an otherwise standard-looking menu. Needless to say the rhubarb and apple made this dish a stand-out; a little too much black pudding I'd note (hardly a complaint... I didn't HAVE to eat it all!) but a fantastic dish regardless.\n\nMy company also seemed very happy with their dishes (burger, battered fish and chicken breast respectively) and the service, all of whom even the girls in our group were keen to point out the attractiveness of. \n\nHamilton's it must be said is a very pretty bar, clientele and staff alike, and it certainly puts out that vibe. We didn't hang around to try out the bar area after our meal so I can only go on observations from my elevated, sniper-like position in the restaurant area, but my observations are as follows:\n\n-- Busy but not overly so. I can imagine a visit here more enjoyable if you can secure a seat and/or table. Or 'sore thumb' be thy name.\n\n-- Potential to be a bit cliquey. However, as in my case, if you're there with a good group of friends (or should I say a group of good friends) this shouldn't and wouldn't even be an issue.\n\n-- An eclectic crowd. Generally quite trendy and lively. Looks like a mix of locals, students and office after-party folk. Good.\n\nAll in all a vibrant atmosphere, good friendly service and a couple of smart dishes have piqued my interest. I'll return at least one more time. After all, that duck is still on my hitlist. But yeah, I could see myself as a regular for the ambience alone.\n\nIn the immortal words of The Guv'nor... I'll be back.\n\nPS. Went back. Had the duck. +1 star.

Another reviewer mentioned that it's owned by the same people who own Treacle which makes perfect sense, but Hamilton's is paired down and feels a bit more relaxed and grown up compared to Treacle.  The service is also better (though as with Treacle we asked for water which we never received), though unfortunately not the food.\n\nWe ordered a sharing platter of all things unhealthy - nachos, shrimp tempura, onion rings, sweet potato wedges.  The nachos were literally about 10 corn chips in a wee bowl with pre-grated cheddar (you know, the kind that doesn't actually melt and just goes all hard and gross?) and a couple of jalepenos.  The salsa served on the side was nice, but the nachos really were abysmal.  The onion rings were in a tempura batter which is ok I guess but seriously lacking in flavour/seasoning.  Both the onion rings and shrimp were incredibly greasy - ok yeah I know they're deep fried but it's possible to do that well and not have everything come out dripping in grease.  \nThe sweet potato wedges were gorgeous with the aoili, but that's pretty hard to mess up!\n\nThe Man noticed some aussie beer on the menu and was quite looking forward to re-living his travelling year with it, but we were told that the entire beer menu was wrong.  Of course not the waiter's fault at all but surely it's easy enough to re-print that page of the menu and replace the apparently 100% incorrect information?  That just seems like lazy management to me.\n\nWe then shared a bean burger with parsnip fries.  I've never had parsnip fries before and think I prefer the sweet or normal potato variety, but they were definitely interesting.  The bean burger was fine, though not really much to write home about.\n\nI know I'm bashing my way through Hamilton's but the truth is that I would actually come back, just not to eat.  The ambiance is good, the setting is comfortable, and the Sunday night live music (while, at 7:30, at bit early) was quite good.\n\nIt's a shame, though, because I really like being able to go for a drink and a bite, and I have yet to find a bar/pub in Stockbridge which has really nice food.", "business_id": "KqgeyLdYbfsd9veyR6UGtw", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-04-18", "type": "review"}

It turned out a happy accident.  Maybe it's because I was just a dumb tourist but I can't agree with some of the reviewers of the place.  \n\nFirst of all, I didn't find the prices to be any more expensive than any other places I visited.  In fact, some of their whiskies were downright bargains.  Other than that, I only had a draft beer so I can't say what their other drinks prices are.  Maybe vodka is pricey there.  The food was also within range of what I'd seen throughout the city and was actually delicious.  I'd eat there again no problem.\n\nSecond of all, from what I could tell, my group of 3 were the only tourists in site.  In all fairness, I was there on a late March Monday night so maybe that had something to do with it.  Still, I was the only \"funny talker\" within ear shot.  The place was quiet and on my visit blissfully calm with just the right amount of ambient buzz.  It was also clean and just warm enough to not feel stuffy or chilled.\n\nLook, I can't say this place is that different from anywhere else that I ate-except for one thing.  The service here was phenomenal.  No joke.  I almost felt like I was a regular with the great service we received.  Writing this, I ask myself why I was surprised it was so friendly.  I can't say I was ever treated rudely on my visit at any other place I ate or drank.   I don't know, for some reason both bartenders were just outstanding in their treatment to us.  From drink recommendations to their opinions on what to order for the meal, they were always smiling and never seemed put off by our questions.  I guess they made me feel like my visit there mattered and that is why they stand out.  Cheers to you Sarah and Luke!\n\nBottom line here, if you're hungry and want a drink to go along with the food, you'll get that here.  What's wrong with that?  Nothing, I say!  Ironically when I checked in, I somehow checked into the statue out front and not the actual bar.  Ah well, I was a bit cold and ready for some warm food.

The best seat in the house is on the restaurant level with a table that overlooks the rest of the bar. An awesome view. I eat on the second level of course, and had a great steak.  The other items on the menu are mussels, bangers and mash, other traditional Scottish fair.  Very good, well made, and fresh food.\n\nOn to the beer! Over 10 hand pumps. Two pumps for the big seller Deuchars IPA. The rest are all different and rotating Scottish micros. All are of very high quality.  Stuarts, \nInveralmond, Orkney, etc.  An excellent selection.\n\nThis is a pub that has been independent for over 100 years, and I love it.

Their new menu is just a plain, boring old menu and even though the cocktails are still great, it's taken away some of the charm. \n\nI was here last week and ordered a cocktail called Candy... something, it had sugar syrup, palma violet flavoured vodka and even a squirt of the raspberry sauce you get on ice-cream cones!

She was clearly a perfectionist or possibly just the slowest cocktail maker in the world. She was cutting fruit, shaking various coloured liquids together and even meticulously placing mint leaves in each glass. She was just placing the finished garnish on each drink when another member of staff came over to serve me. I was looking forward to my cocktails getting the same attention after waiting around 15 minutes, unfortunately this guy took a more wham bam approach to his work. Throwing a couple of limes here, a couple there, a squirt of soda water and they were complete.\n\nAlthough they still tasted pretty good, they weren't as good as the cocktails usually taste here but they were \u00a35 each so pretty reasonable I guess.\n\nAs well as cocktails you can also get pub grub in Bar Kohl, they also have special offers such as 2 for 1 on burgers and hot dogs.\n\nThe general atmosphere is pretty chilled out, minimalist and modern... even though it's \"modern\" it somehow feels slightly out-dated, maybe by about 3 years. \n\nStill a great little (actually quite large) bar though - I'm a fan!", "business_id": "QPsNlmETw14k-_RqX-RULw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-04-27", "type": "review"}

Everything was well made and tasty, and represented good value for money. \n\nHowever, it was the drinks that particularly impressed us. In stark comparison to the food menu, the drinks menu is huge. Clearly a lot of thought and imagination has gone into creating the lovely cocktails and devising new and exciting ways to have spirits and mixers.

I happened to be wandering around on a bitter cold day in Edinburgh, searching for some place to have a warm and filling lunch...  or just a pint to tie me over and get me out of the cold.  I was drawn in by the trendy, retro-esque decor...  but noticed they had a menu as well.\n\nI noticed that it was buzzing, but the staff were very quick to get me seated.  I sat at one of the tables across from the bar, which looked wonderful and in reading the cocktails menu, I'm going to have to go back just to try one.  The waiter was quick to take a drink order, so I asked for a pint of a local ale, to which he gave me a choice, but I channeled my dad and said, \"Surprise me.\"  Whatever it was, it was very good.\n\nIn reading the menu, I discovered it was going to be very difficult to choose something as just about everything on the menu sounded absolutely delicious.  However, because it was cold and I was having a pint, I decided on the Pork and Chorizo Stew served with crusty bread.  The waiter came by a couple times before my order arrived to check on me, which I don't know that I have experienced a lot of that while here in Europe.  Some people might feel pestered, but it is nice to not have to wave someone down to get another pint.\n\nThe stew came out and it looked and smelled wonderful!  It was a large portion, but it looked like the right dish for a cold, winter day.  While I would've liked a little more chorizo, the stew was great!  The pork was tender and it was a little on the spicy side, but it was just the right amount and the pint helped soothe the heat.

The waitress didn't know what I was talking about and though the bar seemed to know, they ended up charging me more for it than was actually advertised.  Admittedly I didn't point this out because I was in a bit of a rush by then and it seemed petty to squabble over 60p, but I did find it an unfortunate oversight.  \n\nTwo of us ordered their tasty cajun potato wedges and we agreed that we should have ordered one to share.  That didn't stop us from finishing both bowls, though.  \n\nMy other friend ordered a burger which, when it first came out was undercooked to the extent that he had to go against his cardinal rule of never sending food back, and send it back.  The waitress was very nice about it and the kitchen recooked the burger and reported that some of the red colour came from the spices used.  This is fine and they handled it perfectly fine but it does seem odd that a place that makes burgers daily would actually churn one out that was SO undercooked.  \n\nSo all in all a pretty \"meh\" experience.

I went with my then-boyfriend and we got great student discount - it was about \u00a34 each to get in. Ok, I'll admit it, it was quite childish going into the time machine, but all in all I thoroughly enjoyed myself! I had thought that the whole thing would be aimed at kids and purely educational, but I was really surprised at how mature the whole thing was and was actually quite fun at times. As well as this, there was quite a big emphasis on Edinburgh, which I quite liked as you don't often get the chance to find out about the geology of your city. Ok, I realise how sad that sounds...\n\nI suppose I enjoyed it more than my then-boyfriend because I am studying Geography, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. It took us about an hour and a half to walk through. The stars/sky thing at the end did make me feel a bit dizzy, but it was a great experience.

So with an extra day off, and no plans, I decided to be an 'at home' tourist for the afternoon and pay Dynamic Earth a visit. It's been a really long time since I was last here, but as I gleefully skipped towards the foot of Arthur's Seat I was very much looking forward to this next visit!\n\nIt cost \u00a311.50 to get in (\u00a37.50 for kids) and I thought this was pretty reasonable (although given I'd just paid \u00a3150 to have personal tour of a volcano, glaciers & geysirs...this was remarkably cheap!). The staff were chirpy, friendly and looked after me well!\n\nDynamic Earth is very well structured, starting with a trip 'back in time' to the Big Bang, and working it's way through the formation of Earth, Ice Age, tropical rain forests and dinosaurs, to modern times and space travel! It's extremely visual, packed with loads of interactive features and has lots of things to play with!\n\nNow, I've always wanted to be a like a kid alone in a toy store, and the fact I'd went into Dynamic Earth quite late in the afternoon meant I got the chance to do just that! I had the ENTIRE place to myself...and I made very good use of it! No crowds, no screaming children and the tour guides all to myself! \n\nWell...I pushed buttons, touched things I maybe shouldn't have, jumped up and down and generated a fake earthquake, cuddled a glacier (made of actual ice, I wasn't tempted to lick it though!), prodded a fake lava flow, got an entire 3D cinema to myself (\"just pick a seat\" requested the bemused tour guide, who still had to go through his scripted speech even though it was just me!), got to spend AGES at each exhibit, rather than having to move on because it's busy and other people want to play with things, and generally just had a ball!\n\nThe tour concludes with a film in the domed cinema (which is sort of like a planetarium. You get to laze back on comfy reclining chairs and watch the film overhead!). It was a new film called 'Are We Alone?' and focused on the search for life in space. It was a lovely animated film, topical (there was a nice explanation of how they landed the Curiosity Rover on Mars), and was narrated by Ron Weasley from Harry Potter!\n\nWhen the film was done, the tour was over and we were guided into the gift shop. It was a great shop, although I resisted the urge to buy a Dynamic Earth pencil and eraser! \n\nAll in all, I had an absolute blast in Dynamic Earth and it was a great way to use an afternoon off! Although it may not be as interesting for younger kids, there was a really fun looking soft-play area. I resisted going in to play though...I'll save that for my next visit!", "business_id": "Rza-FztnKi8YfcSkn1KxgQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-03-27", "type": "review"}

As part of the Scream Pubs family you get drinks prices starting from as little as \u00a31.80, and if you're hungry then \u00a34-5 will ensure you leave with a full tummy. There are two pool tables too, although they are quite close together which means you usually end up on both the giving and receiving end of a pool cue in the back every few minutes at least.\n\nIn the downstairs section there are also loads of tv screens for watching sport, although the awful music they play will definitely make you wish you'd stayed at home to watch the footy in your own living room: the jukebox is programmed to always play the songs that are least selected, i.e. the really awful ones that no-one ever pays for, to make people put money into it to do everyone a favour and change the track.\n\nAnd there are lots of other things that may well put you off coming here.

Regardless of who it was intended for, I took the bait hook, line, and sinker, and was all the merrier for it.

Because I ramped mine up a notch by adding some frills (pepper jack and curly fries) I was still nodding my head in approval when I saw that my total came to roughly 7 pounds.

It is everything I want my local to be.\n\nI'm only living in Edinburgh for a year and I want to taste as many whiskies as possible before I return to a land whose bars stock only only Glenfiddich and Famous Grouse. Bow Bar has more than 200 delicious drams, many if not most of them in the 3 to 5 quid range. But never fear -- if you want to spend more, you can. And if you have a hankering for a whisky from a distillery that's been closed since the 80s, well, you may just be in luck. \n\nEven if they don't have your dream dram, the bartenders are very knowledgeable and will help you find something similar to ease the craving. If you've never drunk whisky before, they'll ask you what you usually like and make a recommendation. Be warned, though: if you plan on mixing your whisky with a Coke, they will not sell you nice drams. \n\nIf you're in more of an ale mood, Bow Bar is still the right place to go, with a great selection of local and regional ales. They keep a few varieties on tap all the time (Black Isle, Stewart's) but usually rotate the other taps -- and quite quickly too. You can come in on a Tuesday and taste the most delicious Tempest Chipotle Porter and return Friday to find it completely sold out. Sometimes I can't decide between all their interesting, unusual ales so I just order a half-pint of each. My only complaint is a strictly American one -- the ales are never quite cold enough for my taste.\n\nWhat people have said about this being an 'old man' bar is somewhat true, but don't let that put you off. The old men are perfectly nice and they're not the only patrons. I happen to love that Bow Bar doesn't play any music -- there's no sensory distraction when I'm trying to nose a dram. The seats do get filled up on weekends and evenings, so if you want to sit and enjoy your drink in peace, I recommend going in the middle of the day or after 8 p.m. during the week. Try to snag a window booth -- they're quite cozy and perfect for getting close to someone special over some truly tasty beverages. \n\nAlso, be forewarned, there's a 40p surcharge if you pay by card.", "business_id": "xFz5u2Tgv1RYmqYZ9kUFFQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-03-14", "type": "review"}

The crowd is also surprisingly mixed, from old guys to students and a smattering of hipsters, all rubbing along quite nicely.\n\nIn this sense, the obvious \"old man pub\" moniker is a bit unfair. It's pretty traditional - in that there's no loud music or hen parties - but is also very vibrant in its own way, with lots of chat and laughter between people who might not otherwise have much in common. That, more than the nostalgia value, is why it's still one of my favourite pubs in the city.", "business_id": "xFz5u2Tgv1RYmqYZ9kUFFQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-05-01", "type": "review"}

They've had a massive refurb. Before it had a slightly gloomy but warm old pub feel to it, now it had a brighter, but cooler feel to it. \n\nThey've gone modern in terms of tech stuff. There are plug sockets at every table by the walls, and they've got free (although limited) wifi. The sockets are a big plus point for me, but I'm not keen on the grey and white decor. \n\nThe biggest plus point by some way is the big step up in food. It's gone from pretty forgettable pub grub to much more up market gastro pub style stuff. I had the mixed grilled veg and hallumi starter with the mushroom risotto. Both were well cooked, although perhaps a little over generously drizzled with pesto (if one could possibly say such a thing) which made both dishes just a teensy bit too salter for what I think they were going for. Rather than than bland though. \n\nIt is worth noting that you get a free small plate/starter if you check in here. The food isn't cheap, but I think since they raised the standard it is reasonable. I got my free starter, main, and a soft drink for \u00a313.50. \n\nAnother I do like about this place is the cellar bar is free to hire out. There are various comedy shows here, and folk sessions.

Located in the Victorian rooftop chamber (at the peak of the building) the demonstration invites to see live moving images of Edinburgh projected onto a viewing table through a giant periscope, which leads to some interesting results including the ability to pick people up on your hands, squash them to a pulp and even make the traffic climb over paper bridges.\n\nFun and relatively cheap its worth clambering up the royal mile to investigate this museum of visual oddities.", "business_id": "-UwZsTF1q2xaSm4bI_Azqw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-05-02", "type": "review"}

You can also \"lift\" people with cardboard, and navigate throughout the city.\n\n Apart from the spectacular views from the top, the rest of the building is full of entertaining activities to impress and challenge the eye and mind.

I'm not particularly interested in optical illusions and this place gave me a headache just by looking at the teasers in the entrance area where you had to count how many legs an elephant had and decided which square was bigger. I've never actually paid the \u00a310 entrance the see the full shabang but to be honest I think that's a bit steep but maybe I'm just stingy.\n\nHaving said that, my friend and I ended up spending just under an hour in the gift shop, strangely enough it's not even that big - I guess we're just really easily amused. They had cute little musical wind up boxes that played Greensleeves and there was even a wind up turtle and spider too. Many of the gifts here are completely unrelated to the optical illusion museum and I even bought myself a soap cat which was supposed to grow hair and when you used it all up a red plastic mouse was supposed to be inside. I didn't find the mouse and my hairy cat ended up in the bin not long after because rather than growing luscious long locks it just looked like it was mouldy.", "business_id": "-UwZsTF1q2xaSm4bI_Azqw", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-05-15", "type": "review"}

If there were a brunch option just to pick selections from the Chef's Table, I'd be happy with just that.\n\nFor my main I had the Sunday roast but the beef was a bit underwhelming and not very flavorful, and the Yorkie just wasn't there. It wasn't as fresh, crispy, light or flavourful as it should have been. \n\nThe dessert choices were good and I went for the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. It was a bit eggy and heavier than I like them, but as I hadn't had one in a while it was still a nice treat. \n\nThe ambiance and feel of Malmaison is generally great - it's a lovely place with many windows looking out towards the canal. Since we came near the end of our voucher time period, all tables were booked about a month in advance and the place was packed. It was frustrating to have long queues at the chef's table. For what we paid (\u00a330 for two) it was an excellent brunch that was a nice treat (four star, but five star if they improved their Sunday roast main). If paying full price, I would have expected a bit more (hence the three stars).", "business_id": "VErgzjUEsusmil_DR4IYbw", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-03-22", "type": "review"}

I visited the brasserie for brunch recently and it was amazing.  It started with the soup of the day, self service from the chefs table, a lovely creamy spicy parsnip soup.  Then we were invited to select something from the chefs table.  There were loads of options such as omelettes, waffles, cold meats, salads, bread, pancakes, pates and terrines.  From past experience I suggest booking your table earlier in the day, as the second time I visited for Brunch the options were limited due to it being busy early on.  Also, pace yourself!  There is so much lovely food on offer, don't over do it on the first two courses, because you won't have room for the rest! \n\nNext was the mains, a selection of six options from the menu, I can recommend the roasts and salmon.  Finally if you have any room, you can order a dessert, don't worry there are lighter options such as sorbet and fresh fruit salad.  All that for a tasty \u00a319.95, marvellous and you won't need to eat for the rest of the day.  The Sunday brunch is very popular and it can be very busy.  Sometimes it feels a little too busy and the neighbouring tables are a little too close for comfort.  When personal boundaries come into it, I feel that they have tried to pack the customers in far too much.  Alas, the brasserie does serve great-tasting cuisine, prepared with incredible local ingredients, so enjoy!\n\nIf the weather suits, you can even enjoy some alfresco dining or drinking on the terrace.  Also if you are lucky enough to be staying and the boutique hotel there is a hotel gym, Gymtonic to work off that heavy brunch!", "business_id": "VErgzjUEsusmil_DR4IYbw", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-04-24", "type": "review"}

We stayed in the Vestry suite which is the most gothic of all the suites and it was gorgeous!  Red velvet and gold line the walls, drape the windows, and cover the bed.  The bathroom has a huge, gorgeous tub, perfect for a long soak after walking around Edinburgh all day.  The staff is also amazing-they lugged our 50+ lb suitcases up 3 flights of stairs-I felt so bad but was definitely thankful after 10+ hours of travel!  We also showed up to a chilled bottle of champagne which was very exciting and an amazing way to start out our trip.\n\nWe only stayed here for 1 out of our 3 nights in Edinburgh because of the \u00a3295 per night price tag but like I said it was well worth it.  You absolutely cannot beat the location-we stayed here the first night and it was the perfect spot to help us get acquainted with the city-we could see the castle from our doorstep and the rest of the Royal Mile was right there at our feet.  You also get a continental type breakfast delivered to your room in the morning-the huge, buttery, chocolaty croissants were my fav!

We had a great time touring around the countryside, but I wanted to make sure to end things on a high note. The Witchery was the perfect choice.\n\nThere is a lot of history here, since the building was erected in 1595. The ambiance was brilliant. Old, dark, hand-carved woods on the walls and ceiling. Every member of the staff we encountered was exceptionally friendly. It was very romantic, with tableside candle light. The table flower arrangement was a thistle and a rose, commemorating the marriage of James IV and Margaret Tudor, which foreshadowed the union between England and Scotland. It was fun having a history lesson right on our table. All in all, it was like having a fancy dinner in the 1600s.\n\nOf course haggis was on the menu (it's Scotland after all), but I'd already had my fill on this trip. We started instead with a bowl of Witchery Shellfish Bisque, complete with rouille, croutons, and gruyere cheese. The croutons and rouille were awesome together: rich, creamy, and garlicky. It was a nice way to warm up my palate.\n\nFor my entree, I couldn't resist their Three Little (rare breed) Pigs: roast loin pulled pork fritter, crispy pork belly, and grilled pork shoulder, along with a Cox's apple puree and sweet potato fondant. I was very anxious to try these local Scottish piggies. \n\nThe sweet potato fondant had a good sweetness to it and paired nicely with the apple puree. My pulled pork fritter was full of tender meat, covered in a magnificent crisp batter. It too was great with the apple. As I expected, the pork belly was very decadent and pleasantly salty. It also came with bacon, which makes everything better. The pork shoulder had a nice sear to it, and it had a good balance of meat and fat. Like everything else, it also paired well with the apple puree.\n\nDessert was essential here. It took some thought, but we finally decided on their Single Estate Madagascan Chocolate Tart, which also comes with an orange blossom ice cream and white chocolate pirouettes. Orange and chocolate go great together in general, and this was no exception. It was dense and fudgey. \n\nWe finished off the meal with some decaf Liqueur Gaelic Irish Coffee. Brown sugar is the way to go with this drink. It was a nice warm nightcap. I really wanted the pistachio biscotto that came with it, but I was way too full by that point.\n\nThe Witchery was the perfect end to what had been a perfect vacation.", "business_id": "4dIzmqGAhFIcuHfI8CySig", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-04-18", "type": "review"}

Actually, I thought I had made the reservation at the Secret Garden part of the restaurant, but when we showed up, we were shown in to the main dining room, instead.\n\nNo matter, we were still awed by the view from the window (Edinburgh Castle, of course).

For my meal, I chose to start with the Roast Arran Beets, and the Cornish Bass for my main. My husband went with the Lobster Bisque for his starter, and the Caringorm Venison for his main. We paired our choices with a glass of wine, and chose to share the cheese platter for our dessert option.\n\nI was very impressed by the food. The beet plate had a selection of different varieties, which was a good representation of how flavors can differ between varietals. My husband loved his lobster bisque (though he did say that it wasn't the best he's ever had). I was in love with the bass entr\u00e9e, though. It was perfectly made, and the flavor was incredible. The oxtail pot au feu - which originally made me cock an eyebrow - actually added a bit of depth to the dish. The sauces that finished off the dish were a nice addition, as well.\n\nMy husband rather enjoyed his venison meal, too. It was the first time either of us had seen black quinoa, but he said it tasted like regular quinoa to him.

They called a cab for us (because heels on cobblestone streets or on a downhill grade would have hurt me in so many ways), and kept us comfortable until it arrived.\n\nThe only thing that makes me sad about the night (other than the fact that we weren't in the Secret Garden, like I had requested) is that they never acknowledged our anniversary.

It arrived and the fish was in a soggy batter (urgh) and the chips were a soggy-fest too. \n\nDetermined to cheer myself up after a less than average fish and chips, I ordered a banoffee pie for dessert. Worst pudding ever. The plate arrived with a cheeky squirt of cheap skooshy cream covering the \"banoffee pie\" (see image). By all accounts, it should have been billed as \"cheap digestive square base with tinned toffee sauce and three slices of banana on top\". It was so bad. \n\nDo not eat here. Even though the place knocked 30% off the bill due to an offer, it was still a tenner wasted. As for drinks, couldn't comment. But the food? Like I said earlier...

I walked past it on a twice daily basis for the best part of a year (I was going somewhere, I should add - I wasn't just walking past to gaze in longingly) and now, long after I stopped walking past it, the opportunity arose as we hunted a post-show drink. Watching ice-dancing is enthralling but also you leave the performance feeling like you've been holding your breath for two hours straight and now seriously need to relax.\n\nSo we sauntered to the nearby Biblos. What to say, what to say. There was a sign on the wall saying that the upstairs space was reserved, but on asking it apparently wasn't, so we went up. It has a nice interior and I was very comfortable, and I even actually took my actual coat off. Yes, the Lizard Woman was warm enough!\n\nBut on the down side, it took a long time for anyone to come and take our order (oh he came around to gather up and whisk away the food menus, and when we said \"we would like to order some drinks\" he just waved the menus at us as though to say \"Not my division. I'm on gathering duty right now.\"\n\nWhen we did order, it took a fair while to come. Now then, there were really not that many of us - seven if I recall correctly - and most of the upstairs was empty, so why it should take so long to concoct our round (which included a lime and soda and a diet Coke; not the most challenging) is a mystery. The arrival itself was also slightly confused and flustered.\n\nNevertheless, it's well located and comfortable, so it's far from being a write off. Ditch the TV (look, I love the IT Crowd, but seriously, what is the point of showing a sitcom with no sound? Football, yes, snooker, fine, but something that relies on dialogue?), whip up the service a bit, and they could have a real winner here.

I may have mentioned in my prior reviews that I commute to work via bus. Recently I was asked to come in to work early, resulting in a 5 AM alarm blaring to start my day. After the first of my two bus stops to work, I realized that I had somehow arrived to find myself with a 30 minute wait for my next bus... all at the lovely hour of 6:30 AM.\n\nSo what, pray tell, is a girl to do in such a quandary on a chilly morning? Naturally to consult her Yelp app and desperately hope a caffeine-filled location exists somewhere close! Let's begin counting our stars here: Costa on Hanover straightaway earns one for location (just off of Princes Street), the second for HOURS. Any coffee shop open early enough for a 6:30 AM visit merits that.\n\nQueue star number three! When I ventured up the stairs into the main foyer of Costa, I was pleasantly surprised. This place is stinkin' cute. I've seen a lot of coffee shops, but this one is not only spacious but really nicely decorated, with tasteful furnishings and giant quirky lamps and such. AND--even better--it has an amazing view of Princes Street and subsequently the castle. (Side note: when arriving at 6:30 AM it's all but abandoned in there, which allows one to enjoy said view of castle in utter peace. Bliss!)\n\nStar number four goes to, naturally, the coffee itself. You've got your standard coffee prices to be found here (perhaps cheaper than Starbucks? hard to say!) and the coffees themselves are just what the doctor ordered. So far I haven't had anything that didn't set me straight for a day of work. The flat white and hazelnut latte I've had were both lovely, but I don't exactly consider myself a coffee snob, so I'm not one for comparisons in that regard. I like coffee in just about any form!\n\nStar number five goes to the gentleman barista who greeted me my first time stepping inside. He was extremely friendly for such an early hour, taking the time to cheerfully acknowledge the great view I was marveling over, and when he asked if I was taking my coffee away, he instantly proffered a Costa bag for me to hide my coffee in so as not to be told to throw it away before boarding. Funnily enough, I'd experienced that very trouble just days prior, and it all but ruined my morning when I left to find a bin and was subsequently left behind by my bus. So when my barista told me that--well, I could have just given him a bear hug for his little gem of helpfulness (and wily coffee-drinking ways!).
