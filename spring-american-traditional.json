Have been there during the years it was less than clean, to the present where it is almost clean. This place is a neighborhood standard that for some reason compels you to return, even if your experience was less than stellar. Fancy it is not. Gourmet it is definitely not. Every item on the menu seems to come from a can, bag ,bucket or box. The wait staff is often clueless and changes like the wind. I have never had the same server twice. But the fact is you get a decent meal for a decent price and always have a little to take home. Yes, the salad bar is very basic. Not every item is a fresh as it should be. The iced tea often takes on the taste of Lord knows what. However,  the fried fish dinner is one of the best I have had anywhere in Picksburg. Their meatloaf is terrific as are several of their hoagies. In a nutshell, this place has a lot of flaws. Like we all do. A few upgrades like a better wait staff, fresh gravy instead of their gallon bucket brand, homemade sauce instead of whatever canned stuff they are using would jump this review to 5 stars. Rocky's is worth going to. You will definitely find something you like and you will definitely go back.

Everywhere you look, there are signs that say kids must be accompanied by an adult, but apparently no one was honoring that at 6PM on a Saturday. I couldn't even walk through the place without someone shoving me. AHHH!\nI get that Dave and Buster's is an arcade and that you're going there to play some games, maybe eat, and kill some time. When I last went there a few years ago, we there for my bachelor party, and while I'm sure we got into some shenanigans, I don't remember children running wild there. We were having adult beverages, playing games, and having a good time. This time, it was ridiculous. It isn't Chuck E. Cheese, yet that's how parents seem to be treating the place.\nOn top of that, the customer service sucked. The place is gigantic, with tables and serving areas everywhere, yet on a Saturday at 6PM, the hostess told us (after interrupting us three times to chat with the other hostess) told us it would be a three hour wait, despite the fact that there were empty tables all over the dining room. I suspect this is a ploy to get you to play games and spend money until you're table is ready, but the food at Dave and Buster's is not worth a three hour wait on any day.\nThe hostess told us we could be served right away if we went to the midway and found an empty table, so we attempted that. Most of those tables were empty with usually one or two adults at a giant empty table filled with coats who informed us that they needed the table because their kids would be back soon after playing games. Next, i engaged in the most rudest thing I've ever done- I began stalking tables where people were finishing up. I would walk up to people paying their check, ask if I could have their table when they were done, and they would inform me that there were already two or three people who asked them and I should get in line.\nFinally, we found a table and proceeded to spend two hours eating dinner. It wasn't because we ordered a lot of food- it was that the waiter took forever to bring our food out. He seemed to have no problem getting us fresh drinks, until we drank as much as we could and then asked for water. After that, he seemed to come around a lot less. \nI had the build your own chicken tacos, which comes on a giant plate with all kinds of fixings. The fixings were fresh, but the chicken was cold and dry, and the tortillas were dried out as well. For $14, it wasn't worth it. \nAfter dinner we proceeded to play games, which entails shoving people to get through areas and waiting in line to play anything. \nAll in all, I didn't like my experience at Dave and Busters. I remembered it being a fun place to go and unwind as an adult. but between all the kids and the crappy service, can't recommend this place.

I was excited! I haven't been to this Dave and Buster's since I was younger and was ready to go back and play me some games! I went with my cousins, mind you, we hadn't ate all day and were very hungry. So, we decided to do the Eat & Play Combo, naturally. Here's where it gets bad. First of all, we get a very snobby hostess that shows us to our table. Then, we wait...and wait...and finally after about 25 mins we get a waitress. Her name was Ashley. We had plenty of time to decide what we wanted, so we quickly put our order in. Next, we were sitting and talking, waiting, we had empty glasses and our waitress had never even come around to see if we needed refills except for one time. She said she'd come back right away with our refills...yea, right. 20 mins later we get our refills. Mind you, our food still hasn't came yet. I see other people getting their food that had come in after us. I was frustrated. After waiting 45 mins for our food, I asked to speak with a manager. One of the servers who I asked replied rudely with \"Well, he's really busy right now. I doubt he'll be able to come out and talk to you\". Finally, 15 mins later...that's one hour, folks. We get our food. What do you think the next problem was? Yep, the food was cold. I was completely fed up at this point, and told my waitress how disappointed I was, especially after driving one hour just to have this terrible service. The manager never came to speak with me, and we didn't even receive our meals for free. The only compensation we got were $10 game cards. Woopty-doo. The only thing good about this place is the games, but the prizes you get for your tickets are all junk and worthless.

Speaking of that, I've been here a few times, but never wrote a review for D&B. \n\nI'm a kid at heart and honestly do enjoy the games. However, there have been multiple instances where I swiped my game card & it took my credits, but no game began. There have also been times that I won and no tickets were released. I guess nothing is perfect but it does happen atleast once a visit (each scenerio)  It's hard to find a worker walking around and for half-price games, you kind of just take your loss with the 1.3 credits for skee ball (hmph!)\n\nThe food- it really isnt anything too fancy. I've had okay food, but super long wait times for a simple chicken fingers & fries for example. It's your basic sandwiches, salads, appetizers & a few pastas. I believe all sandwiches & burgers are around $10 & served with fries.  You can get the Eat & Play deal which includes food from a specific menu + a game card. Besides the game card deal, if you wanted to make D&B a date night you might be better off heading to another place to eat in Waterfront for amazing food.. but to each their own.  Try it once I suppose. The brownie sundae that i devoured last night was satisfying (2 brownies, 2 scoops of ice cream.. one with chocolate syrup; the other with raspberry sauce & fresh strawberries. Oh & whip cream)\n\nDrinks- pretty weak. We ordered 2 liquid maryjanes (2 each that is) which are filled with multiple shots of alchy & didn't really catch a buzz. Oh welllll. They do have a happy hour from 5-7pm. I'd go during that time for the best deal. I believe cocktails are half off & $3 off  bottles of wine. I've never seen anyone walking around with a wine glass though lol. \n\nThe prizes- as others have noted, the prizes are a little cheap for the amount of tickets they \"cost\" However, it's cool to leave with a D&B coffee mug, cup or shot glass. Last night for 2500 tickets we decided on magnetic-style dart board (1,300?) a coffee mug, a D&B glass (our plastic one bit the dust) & a D&B coffee travel mug.. I might be missing a few odds & ends.\n\nOverall it's a fun time but can be pricey. It's best to head here Wednesday for half price games or get the Eat & Play deal while dining. \n\nI can't lie though, I find myself smiling ear to ear a few times within those 3 hours (woah, seemed longer than amount of time :D ) Speaking of which, in that time-frame we played 250 credits (cost= $40) but it was half-price games.", "business_id": "sbW8qHJgzEIH42B0S-3New", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-03-27", "type": "review"}

I understand the prices of the play cards and won't dispute them; however, the food was incredibly over-priced, came out COLD (as in, sat on a counter without warmers for a minimum of 30 minutes) and I literally had to ask the bartender if there was any vodka in my drink. It was pure juice. $38 for three shots that had little-no alcohol in them. (Not to mention, my glass was dirty, and I saw the bartender scoop the glass into the ice basin because she was too lazy to use the sanitary scoop. I know the Food and Beverage Commission would be as disappointed as I was.) The service was terrible. Don't ask for anything from your waiter, as they are a little too busy on their cell phones or conversing amongst themselves. \n\nWas it fun to be in an adult-themed arcade? Yes. If you're looking for a good atmosphere to go with friends to play games, I suppose I would advise you give it a shot. I would never recommend their food, customer service, or drinks.

The bar area gives you a choice of sitting at the surrounding tables with waitress service or hanging out at the bar itself. Complete with a chillie ice strip to keep those yummy brews cold and the ever entertaining company of your favorite bartender.

Which hey, that could be the perfect seat if you're stocking the local comics! \n\n\nThe bar area contains pools tables and dart boards to try your skills. On any give night sports fans can enjoy the games of the day on one of the 6 big screen TVs surrounding the bar area. \n\nThe menu is pretty decent with burgers that are cooked to order with the choice of either steak , veggie or chicken. They have a number of specialty burgers with different cheeses, toppings and creative themes. The bourbonzolla is a tasty burger with a Bourbon based glaze and Gorgonzola cheese. Appetizers which range from nachos to firecracker shrimp. Steaks, pasta and salads with rotating specials from different areas of the menu. \n\nOn Monday the burgers are half off...I don't think you have to be a member of their mug club to get the special.

They admittedly still aren't my first choice food-wise because, by design, they're a pretty generic eatery for the most part, especially compared to other options in the area. Their local brews are really the only thing that sets them apart from other places in the Waterfront, and Pittsburgh has so many breweries and so forth now that even that isn't the biggest draw anymore.\n\nThat said, their brews ARE usually quite good and worth trying. Plus, they ARE improving in terms of service and quality of food, and that deserves a mention. Sure, I may think their menu of burgers, pizzas and American eats is pretty average, but I also think the quality of the dishes is improving. For example, my burgers are no longer coming to me overcooked, and as a result actually taste like a burger and not like a pile of toppings and a dry meat patty. Some dishes are even more memorable now; I actually really like their veggie burger, which is packed full of flavor that even I, a known carnivore, can appreciate. And their fresh pretzels and dip? Absolutely amazing - exactly what you'd expect from a warm pretzel fresh out of the oven. \n\nI was especially impressed during my last visit by a server named Mark, who was incredibly attentive and came to our table regularly to check on drinks and keep us updated. He never said a negative word and was quick to correct any mistakes or problems that popped up during the night. If Rock Bottom hires more people like him, there will be many more happy people coming and going from the place, I guarantee it.\n\nAdd in the fact that this is one of a small handful of places that accepts reservations in the Waterfront - a MAJOR plus when planning big outings with friends in the area! - and you have a reliable place where a group of people can go after a movie, shopping, etc. for food and drinks.

You either like it or hate it. This location is pretty standard; it has the expected mash-up of decorations around the walls that try to give the place a laid-back lounge feel and there's nothing outstanding about the menu or what they offer food wise (and like other Friday's, it's not particularly easy to eat here if you're anything other than a meat lover).\n\nHonestly I wasn't expecting to eat here any time soon; I had called a few days before eating here while planning a day out with friends and asked about reservations for a large group (as it says on the T.G.I. Friday's website that it's ideal to call ahead when you have a large party). However, I was told on the phone that this location does not accept reservations. So my friends and I looked elsewhere, and finally walked across the street to Friday's after discovering just how darn long the waits at other restaurants were. At least Friday's only had a 15 minute wait.\n\nOnce we were seated our meal went by pretty uneventfully. I remember that we had to repeat ourselves a lot to our waitress and I had wondered why she was having trouble hearing us, but at least she was willing to ask questions and clarify things as opposed to taking a potentially wrong order back to the kitchen. Kudos. The food, as I mentioned earlier, was standard T.G.I.Friday's. Nothing particularly wrong with it, just not that exciting either.

My steak was surprisingly juicy, came out fairly pink and was not overcooked at all (I'd ordered a medium temperature steak), and the simple and tasty vegetables offered a nice alternative to some of the other excessive dishes I saw on the menu. Not that that mattered after I ordered a rum punch cocktail, which mixed so much rum, fruit juice, sprite and other sugary beverages together that my teeth probably rotted a little bit in my head. It was worth it, though - that drink was a sweet, tall cup of Heaven.\n\nThis T.G.I.Friday's really fits my exact definition of an \"a-ok\" place - it's not terrible, nor is it not exceptional. It's just a decent place to grab a bite or to enjoy a drink. I'd consider coming back again, but admit that they wouldn't be my first choice so much as a solid back-up plan for when other Waterfront eateries are super busy.", "business_id": "tU-YtoW339PXJmUGSix_AQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-03-30", "type": "review"}

Which I stated right off the bat, that I didn't blame the girl who took my order. I know cooks can't read. I was one for many years. Mistakes happen, and the manger took care of it and took the item off my bill. NO complaints, still ate the food and it was good. Just not a fan of onions on my pizza. \n\nNow onto the bill, the server continues to tell me that she was sorry for the mistake and declares she told the cooks not to add onions. I already said it was taking care of and there's no worries. She goes on to say that the next day was her birthday, and if I felt like leaving all my money as a tip, it wouldn't go unnoticed. I took this as a joke as I had told her earlier I worked in the industry. When I hand over the gift card I had on hand, she comes back and again repeats herself, tells me that cash as a tip is preferred as she doesn't have to claim it at the end of the night. And again if I felt like leaving her all my money, she would just be so freaking happy. Let me explain one thing and hopefully I am very clear on it. No server, and I mean NO server anywhere, should ever ask a guest or customer for a tip, yet alone, do it twice! So out of kindness, which I shouldn't have left anything by this point.

The tables outside, though, are too close and if all are occupied, one can hear every word of what is said at neighboring tables.\n\nThe spinach and chicken pizza, appetizers of zucchini chips and spinach and artichoke dip were all delicious, but the zucchini was extremely salty.\n\nOur server was pleasant and attentive, performing many quality checks.  $20.99 is a lot to pay for a pizza, but the deep dish pies are hearty and plenty for two people. $7.75 for a small glass of house wine is excessive.  The $4.99 tariff for the single serving appetizers was fair for the quality and the portion sizes.\n\nThe weak link was the young lady who seated us.  She was glum, unfriendly, and without a smile.  Instead of saying \"Enjoy your meal\" when seating customers, she says, \"There you are.\"  How a customer is greeted can set the tone for a meal and this is an important facet of the front of the house operation.

It exceeded my expectations which were admittedly very low. We needed some healthy food options for our 1.5 year old as well as enough comfort food to satisfy our starving and lazy weekend bellies. \n\nThere was a short 10 minute wait for a table at around noon but the hostess was nice enough and they gave us a big, clean booth with a partial view of the river. It took another 10-15 minutes to get service although our waiter did pop by to say he would be right with us. Another waitress took our order in the end and they comped us for one buffet. So the three of us ate for the price of one since kids five and under get a free buffet with a paying adult. ($7.99)\n\nOk enough about the service which was slowish but it's a full house at that time so understandable . The food:\n\nThe buffet was constantly refreshed and each container overflowing with hot food. My favorites: really well cooked fried chicken perfectly salted and complemented with Frank's red hot sauce. Biscuits and gravy, the biscuits were a little dry, mini peirogies, cooked baby carrots, really nice mini pancakes, stuffing, bacon, and ok-only home fries. It's too bad cos I generally judge a place by the quality of their breakfast potatoes but in this case the fried chicken more than made up for it. My husband had some decent salad and good clam chowda.\n\nMy kid ate everything on the other end of the buffet: cherry tomatoes, cottage cheese, cooked baby carrots, cantaloupe and honeydew melon, pineapple, bits of peirogie and chicken. The waiter gave him a shamrock sugar cookie at the end of the meal. We helped him eat most of it :)\n\nThere were a few misses: French toast were disappointingly dry and hard and the buttery/oniony noodles were undercooked. Other things looked good but we couldn't try it all: mini-waffles, mash potatoes and gravy, sausage patties, cheesey sauce, scrambled eggs. We'll just have to go again in a few weekends.

Instead of hollandaise sauce, the dish comes with CHEESE sauce. Not my favorite that it came on a thin English muffin either, but our potatoes were good.

It was my first job and continued to supplement my burgeoning shopping addiction throughout High School and into College.  I had a fantastic time throwing people's menus down as a hostess and then filling food orders (and occasionally spilling orange juice on people's crotches, oops) as a waitress and gossiping with my coworkers.  So needless to say, I have a special place in my heart for this lovely establishment!\n\nI think for a Pittsburgh owned chain restaurant it's one of the best.  This is in terms of how the business is run and the restaurants itself.  My love affair of grilled stickies began here.  I may have occasionally shoved one or two in my mouth as soon as they came out of the oven.  I also can't resist a smiley cookie.  They seem to be at every event in the city, so I never have to go long to fulfill on my smiley cookie cravings.  Thank gawd!\n\nMy all time favorite salad is the grilled chicken and portabella salad.  I absolutely love the balsamic dressing and mix of fresh ingredients.  I also had a second in High School (when I didn't have to count so many calories, ew) where I'd order a Super Burger every lunch break.  They are seriously addictive with their super secret sauce combination.  \n\nTheir breakfast buffet is bomb!  I always have to go for the regulars and one word sums that up.  Carbs.  Pancakes, french toast and those delish strawberry muffins!  And seriously, what is up with how good their pistachio whip is on the buffet?

How nostalgic you are.\n\nWe were the proud owners of a gift card to Applebee's (Christmas gift!) and the best part of this gift was my boyfriend's reaction to me later.  He has never been to an Applebee's.  Or an Olive Garden.  Or a Chili's.  His first time at a Red Lobster was with me when we were stuck in a strip mall hell for the night.  So he's new to these restaurants, which so many of us grew up with.  I'd only been to an Applebee's a handful of times, but I was down to go back - it seems like they sort of have everything, no matter what you're hungry for.\n\nSince we're spending all our time now packing to move back to Chicago (WOOHOO!), we don't always have time to make dinner.  So we busted out the Applebee's gift card and journeyed to Edgewood Towne Center for some chain restaurant foods.  \n\nWhen we arrived, this server really awkwardly asked us to sit at the bar.  I missed the finer points of the interaction, since he was talking to my boyfriend, but he basically insinuated that he'd just sat some large tables, or something, and it was his turn to have a table in his section but he didn't have the time to serve us, or something, and he didn't want us to wait (for what, I'm not sure) so he was basically like \"Can you sit at the bar?\"  Which was weird because there were like, at least a dozen open tables.   But whatevs.  The cool kids sit at the bar, and we are the cool kids.\n\nChuck, the bartender, was running this show.  Dude.  He was on top of everything.  Taking orders, serving drinks, answering phones, getting takeout orders, keeping his bar neat and tidy - he was HOPPING!  We were both in awe just watching him.  That man is earning his tips, for reals.  So I'd recommend sitting at the bar if Chuck is working.  He's also cute, so bonus there.  The Applebee's bar is kind of a hilarious place - random people having drinks as if it's a real bar and not a restaurant, this one lady READING A BOOK WITH A GLASS OF WINE like it was some fancy cafe, some annoying fratty people....and us.  A healthy mix.\n\nI had a Shock Top and my boyfriend had a Sam Adams - mad props for Shock Top on draft, not expecting that from Applebee's.  We ordered spinach and artichoke dip, which I believe was half price (as are all apps) during happy hour.  It was served with regular tortilla chips (like from a bag) but the dip itself was pretty tasty.  It was served in a really wide but shallow crock, and tasted appropriately spinachy and cheesy.  It was served very hot and was pretty satisfying!\n\nMy side salad arrived shortly thereafter, and it was amusingly huge for a side.  Iceberg lettuce, cherry tomatoes, crispy croutons, shredded cheese, tangy bottled Italian dressing on the side.  I bought it to balance out my entree, but somehow these iceberg lettuce salads never really feel healthy, you know? Like eating crispy water.  With cheese and croutons.  YAY HEALTH!\n\nThen came the entrees - I got an order of wings (which I think is technically listed as an appetizer) with \"Sweet and Spicy Sauce\" which was listed as the second-hottest sauce on the menu.  They were pretty decent - served hot, juicy chicken, and the sauce was sweet and sticky.  It was a little *too* sweet for me - picture gloopy Chinese takeout in sweet sticky sauce, and that's what the wing sauce was like - but it still made a satisfying meal.  My boyfriend got one of their \"special burgers\" from their new New Orleans menu -something like a Bourbon Bacon burger.  They asked him \"pink or no pink\" which we thought was funny.  He said \"pink,\" and the burger came out with like, a tiny touch of maybe-pink in the middle.  Medium-rare, this ain't!  He said it was okay.  Not great.  Just a burger.  I didn't taste it, I just nibble on a few of his fries, which were pretty average.\n\nThat all came in at around $30, aided greatly by the happy hour appetizer discount.  I have no interest in going to Applebee's again because I can get better burgers, pasta, chicken, bar food, everything, etc anywhere else, but if I was road tripping and needed a place to stop, this wouldn't be a bad choice.  Sit at the bar and hope Chuck is there, and enjoy pretty average versions of American bar food.", "business_id": "h3la53L9-OX_HlfeAySh0Q", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-03-01", "type": "review"}

I've been going here off and on since I turned 21, even if it was just to stop in for fries at lunch, and it's one of the finest dives around.\n\nWe typically stop in here for a fish sandwich and some drinks after the Unblurred gallery crawl in Garfield.  Jason bartends on Friday nights, and he's the best.  He's one of those bartenders that remembers you after your first visit, and remembers what you drink and keeps the refills coming.\n\nTheir food is excellent.  The fish sandwich is church-fish-fry good, and the coleslaw is crispy and mayonnaise-d to perfection.  But the real treat of this place is the fries.  There's something about these fries that I just love.  I think they remind me of the homemade fries my grandpa used to make me in his deep fryer when I was a kid.  They're kind of like a thinner, jucy-er version of Potato Patch fries.  Seriously.  Go get some now.\n\nAnd like other dive bars in Pittsburgh, the prices are cheap.  This is the perfect place to sit around with your fellow Yinzers and watch the Buccos or the Pens (or both, if it's that glorious time of year when both seasons are going - they have multiple TVs).\n\nThe only thing I don't like about Nico's is that it's one of the few smoking-permitted bars left in town (they, like Thunderbird and the Cage, keep the food prices low to skirt that smoking ban loophole).  I've gotten kind of spoiled lately by smoke-free establishments, and I hate coming home stinking like cigarettes.\n\nBut the dives in Pittsburgh are all pretty much maintaining the smoking thing, so I can't complain when comparing.

Alas,  I went there this morning and found out it really is just your typical greek diner with a giant menu.  I give it kudos for the jukebox on the tables (Sopranos finale style) and I thought our server was great.  She easily had been doing this for 40+ years.  The atmosphere is good just like any other diner you would go too.  I was here this morning with my friend Fiona and we both needed a hearty breakfast to help with our recovery from the prior night.  The coffee was good and plentiful.  We never had less than half a cup.  I had two poached eggs and white toast.  The eggs were poached perfectly and the bread was appropriately soaked with butter.  All in all this was pretty good.  My bacon was also fine with three healthy strips.  However, Fiona was less lucky.  She had a veggie omelette which was average at best, size doesn't matter with respect to omelettes I'd rather less eggs, but super beaten so the omelette is light.  The veggies were plentiful, but I'd prefer the veggies lightly sauteed, so texturely there isn't such a difference from the eggs to the vegetables.  The sausage was good, but cold.  She asked for crispy bacon and it wasn't crispy at all, in fact it was exactly the same doneness as mine.  The homefries were okay, but I prefer a little more crust on the potatoes.  I'd say this is a perfectly acceptable diner, but I'd recommend you'll enjoy your meal much better if it's at 2 AM in the morning as opposed to 10 AM on a saturday when most of your whits are about you and your palate is not dulled from the Tequila.", "business_id": "--UE_y6auTgq3FXlvUMkbw", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-05-31", "type": "review"}

I have opted out of Ritters on several occasions simply because I didn't have any cash on me.\n\nOther than that, the food is affordable and tasty. To some of the people complaining about the food, what did you expect? This isn't fine dining - this is a place you go get affordable basic food. If you want fine dining go pay 60 dollars a seat somewhere else. \n\nGood food, good prices, friendly service.

Yeah, that place is that old and that outdated.\n\nMy Order : Eggs/Sausage/Potatoes/Toast, Fried Chicken and French Fries and finally, Chili Cheese Fries.\n\nThe good:\n- They have parking, though their lot is a bit odd. No parking = no visit from me.\n- The eggs were pretty good. Can't say anything bad about them and they were some of the better eggs I had. \n- The potatoes/home fries were also pretty good. \n- I really like the consistency of their french fries. Their fries are long and taste good.\n- The breakfast prices are reasonable.\n- They do have a wide variety of options on their menu. They have seafood, burgers, hot dogs, chicken, steak, breakfast food, ice cream and other stuff.\n\nThe bad:\n- It's 2015 and they have no website or menu. Think about that. I have no idea how they could ever find customers not from the local area. They could put up a website for free and a menu as well. It would take less than 1 day of their time. There's restaurants from third world countries that have menu's online.\n- They want $1.75 for cheese on their eggs. I can almost buy a full pack of cheese for that price\n- The fried chicken is so so, but they want $7.70ish for one chicken wing sized leg, a mostly small breast and an even smaller leg. Not worth it at all, since you can get a better deal at Popeye's or KFC, who I both find expensive. Their chicken is better too.\n\nMy friend got an omelet of some sort and seemed to really like it.\n\nWould I return there? I could see myself returning for a quick breakfast once in a while, but I don't see myself going there for dinner.\n\nRecommendation: I can't say I recommend you going out of your way for this place.

Nevertheless...\n\nA few of us went out after late night bowling to get some food. We went to Ritters because it was literally the only place open within a 5 mile radius and we were starving. Anyways, we made our way past the pack of chain smoking waitresses on the front steps and were seated. Every surface in this place is covered in a thin layer of oily grime. It's clear that cleanliness is not a priority here. Your hand will stick to the table if you touch it. And the bathroom looks and smells like something out of the movie Saw.\n\nThe waitstaff didn't even pretend to be friendly and honestly looked like they just rolled in from a halfway house. Also, our frail, elderly waitress was clearly extremely ill and really shouldn't have been handling food. The food itself was pretty terrible, but it's a diner and the only option around after midnight, so whatever.\n\nWe got the bill and proceeded to the counter to pay. The little old white-haired curmudgeon who I guess runs the place shuffles over to the counter, rips the bill out of my hand and says \"Give me $28.38\". I politely ask if we could pay separately (there were four of us). He grunts something inaudible with a sourpuss look on his face and I ask him to repeat himself. He then raises his voice and rudely says \"Give me $28.38. I don't have time for this, I'm very busy\". It was 1:00 am, there were maybe 10 people in the entire place, and all he was doing was sipping coffee at the counter. He could have just said \"Sorry, we don't split checks\" and it would have been fine. No need to be nasty. He's like the Soup Nazi from Seinfeld but not nearly as funny.

Earlier in the day, when it's dead, it has that low-key neighborhood vibe. In fact, it's so low-key that the last time I was in, it essentially became a family restaurant with a few of the tables filling up with groups of little kids and their parents after what I presume was a basketball game. Granted, that forced us to move, as our group of adults didn't want to spend the afternoon attempting to talk over the sounds of a dozen + kids, but I guess with a few video games on the one side of the bar, the TV's, and affordable food, it's not an awful option for the locals to bring their kids during the day.\n\nThe bartenders have always been really nice, and the beer selection is pretty good. With a nice pint and all of the TV's, it's a decent place to catch a game, so there are definitely some positive aspects to The Saloon. Just don't expect much from the food. \n\nNow, yes...I'm fully aware that it's a bar, so the food isn't supposed to be great, but their food is actually bad enough that when I'm hungry The Saloon just isn't a place I consider an option unless we're meeting people there. I've given the food on the menu three chances to impress me, ordering different items each time, and sadly, the only food item that I enjoyed was the complimentary popcorn they brought to our table and/or gave us at the bar...and I'm not a big fan of popcorn.\n\nEven something as simple as the buffalo chicken tenders I ordered last time as a fail-safe hope for a meal - after two previous disappointing experiences - scored below-average. The buffalo sauce was almost gritty, as the seasoning in the sauce was too noticeable. Talk about an awful texture. The fries are okay, but the sweet potato fries were too greasy. Now I'm sure there are people who will stand behind the food at The Saloon, but after my 3 unimpressive meals, I know I'll be hesitant the next time I'm perusing the menu during a visit. Perhaps I'll wise up and just eat at Aladdin's or Little Tokyo next door to The Saloon before heading into the pub next time.", "business_id": "jJfTh2O3M2Q716akd9Dr9w", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-03-12", "type": "review"}

I don't even MEAN to, I just happen to end up here a lot.  I think it's because it's the kind of place that lots of people can agree on - pretty good food and drinks and a KILLER patio.  For me, the patio kicks it up from 4 to 5 stars.  in the winter they don't serve lunch.  In the summer this place is hoppin' all the time and yes, I'm that jerk hogging a giant table waiting for my friends to show up - they're just PARKING.\n\n(speaking of parking - don't park in the lot next door you WILL get towed!)\n\nNone of the other reviews mentioned yet that they recently changed the menu - one of the great new additions is the BBQ pork sandwich.  I love it in slider form - get the coleslaw with it and stick it on the sando.  delish.  I don't even LIKE coleslaw - including on a primanti's bros sando - so you know it's good.\n\nThe mac and cheese (add the andouille sausage!) is a staple and you can get a mini version as a side to an entree for just a little extra.  \n\nAnother new addition is the chicken fried bacon - yes, you read that correctly.  It is a hearty plate of bacon that is battered and fried and comes with white gravy.  I've shared it 3 times with friends and each time it's been a little different but also kind of left me a little queasy although with a happy novelty food feeling.  I would definitely not recommend one person trying to eat this unless they were trying to commit suicide by bacon - which I also don't recommend - and I LOVE bacon.   \n\nOverall I love this place and I don't think the drinks are more expensive than most of the other places on Ellsworth - half price frozen cosmos are definitely worth it.

However it's changed in recent months and I don't think I will return.\n\nOn a recent Thursday night, my friend and I had possibly the worst waitress ever.  Her name was Amanda and this is my story about her as our waitress.\n\nShe was not present for about 15 minutes after we were sat.  She finally appeared and asked us for our drink order. She disappeared for about 10 minutes before returning.  She served us our drinks then immediately left for another table. It was another 5 to 10 minutes before she came by again, this time taking our order for food.\n\nShe return 5 minutes later with another round of drinks which we don't remember ordering, but we weren't going to complain. We never saw her the rest of the night.\n\nOther waitresses were making their rounds every 5 minutes out on the patio, but ours never appeared once.  I thought she may have died in back in the kitchen or was burned beyond recognition.  I even asked one of the other waitresses out of concern for her safety if she was okay.  She said they would check.  She returned not long after and said she was alright.  I relaxed a little, until another 15 minutes went by... it was now about 30 minutes since we had ordered and no food.\n\nWe waited a bit longer, we still hadn't seen Amanda (our waitress for those paying attention).

Not that they're not trying to have interesting things on the menu, but it all just ends up not being that great.  The prix fixe brunch is similar.  The menu is pretty hilarious, but the food usually disappoints.  The exception is the wings - which do have great sauces, especially the strawberry chipotle BBQ.

Their menu descriptions change periodically, as if one of their staff members got a degree in comedy writing but hasn't made his/her big break yet.  It's always fun reading the menu for the quirky stories that poke fun at CMU students or current events or what have you.\n\nMenu content aside.  I've never been disappointed with the food.  The fish tacos are definitely an excellent bang for the buck, at under $10 (maybe under $9 but I don't recall exactly) and comes with a side of your choice.  The spinach dip is delicious but just a tad too cheesy for me.  I had one of their pasta dishes a long time ago, loaded with chicken and vegetables, which was one of their pricier items, but it was a large dish so I was able to eat it the next day.\n\nAlso, if you're not driving, please try their dessert drinks.  Or at least read the menu for it.  You'd have to splurge a little, but they're still worth a try.  For those not interested in dessert drinks or mixed drinks, the beer selection is decent here, too.\n\nOverall, I like coming here.

I went for the infamous bacon night this past Tuesday and wow - it sucked. First off, our waitress just wasn't good. She forgot to put our order for a basket of bacon in and we had to ask for it thirty five mins later. Bacon doesn't take that long to cook. Then, we had to ask for ranch with our wings - which we'd already requested, but she'd brought us bleu cheese instead. Oh, AND they were out of bacon wings! On bacon night! WTF. \n\nAnyways, we also had to request sour cream for the pierogies, which is normally brought out with them, plates (b/c we were sharing several appetizers), and ketchup. Why ketchup? Let me tell you. We'd ordered the sliders as well, and it was the saddest display of baby burgers I've ever seen. \n\nThey were brought out on one of the same small plates that we had for sharing our apps - like the size of a saucer that you'd put a tea cup on. And there were only TWO of them. Two! For six bucks I'll go get six non-mini burgers at freaking mcdonalds. And to top it off, they were dry as the sahara and served with NOTHING. \n\nI got the sliders at Harris about six months ago and there were four sliders to an order, and they were served on a fanciful, long plate with a selection of condiments - you know, ketchup, tomato, onion, mustard, etc. Normal things that people put on burgers every day. So, that was really disappointing. But it wasn't over.\n\nThe bacon \"baskets\" arrived. The simple fact that they serve it in a basket seems to imply that there will be a pretty decent amount of bacon in there, right? Nope. There were literally exactly four sad little pieces. The big basket only made 'em look all the sadder. And they'd somehow managed to burn half of each slice black, while the other half was rubbery and undercooked. Yuck. \n\nOverall, I would never go back again if it wasn't for the fact that I have a gift certificate. The only things Harris has going for it right now are its patios, cleverly written menu, and nice location on Ellsworth ave.

I cannot comment on the bar and/or alcoholic beverages as I did not imbibe on my recent visit, but the menu didn't do much for me.\n\nWe arrived on a busy Saturday night, but were seated within 20 minutes. Not bad, but our table was questionable. They took a big, corner booth and split it in half so that 2 parties of four could be accommodated sitting directly across from each other. It was kind of weird obligatorily staring at the couple across from me, but I digress.\n\nSome of my fellow diners started off with the Vegetarian Chili. I sampled some and it was well-spiced and hearty, I didn't miss the meat. We also started off with the Spinach Dip. The dip itself was fine, though I've never really eaten anywhere that could screw up spinach dip.\n\nThe entrees then arrived. My companion decided to have their signature Mac and Cheese. The noodles were a perfect al dente, and the cheese itself had a sharp bite. It became difficult to eat after a few bites, however, for the dish was missing a textural contrast. It would've benefited from some breadcrumbs baked on top.\n\nI decided to sample their bacon cheeseburger, which the establishment is apparently pretty proud of. It was cooked to a true medium rare, which is a rare (no pun intended) find in this city. Also, the bacon was heavenly, an ideal combination of lean and fat. They take their bacon seriously here, and it was easily the most interesting part of the burger. The pros of the burger end there however. It was, besides the bacon, pretty boring. The accompaniments (lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, ketchup, mustard) were standard. The patty itself, while well-cooked and of a good quality, was unfortunately underseasoned. The burger could've benefited from something that gave it pizzaz, like a sauce, some spice, or even some more salt!\n\nI opted for onion rings as a side to my burger. They were large, battered, sweet, and a little crispy, though quite greasy.\n\nMaybe it was because it was a busy Saturday night that I was disappointed. I was expecting some high class bar food at this spot. The common theme of the meal was that although the dishes were competently executed, they all lacked something (such as textural contrast) that could've elevated them to true greatness.

One star for food. \nI have been to the Harris Grill three separate times for dining.  The first was happy hour - with a party of six. We waited 30 minutes for a table; we watched several tables empty out and stay un-bussed and dirty for more than 10minutes at a time.  Obviously they must have been understaffed.  Once seated, service was extremely slow.  Our server was slow to arrive at our table to begin and take our drink order. Our drinks took even longer to arrive (approx. 20 min from when seated.)  The appetizers were tasty, although overpriced. Buffalo chicken dip was very good. Service remained poor.  Perhaps they were just very busy and understaffed. \n\nThe second time I came was midweek, midday, for lunch.  The place was mostly empty.  Surely we would get good, prompt service now?  Not so much.  All I ordered was the chocolate cupcake dessert.   It took about 25 minutes.  It looked like half a cupcake was dropped on the floor, and then attempts made at making the broken pieces look presentable on a plate.  Half of it was luke-warm, half of it was cold.  Terrible.  WTF?\n\nThe most recent and I promise the last time I will ever go to the Harris Grill was a Sunday for brunch.  Again a 30min wait for a party of 3 to be seated.  I understand that - its Sunday - its Brunch - lots of places have a wait.  But again we watched table after table go empty and stay dirty.  Finally seated it again took 20 minutes to get our drinks - orange juice. And then the waitress only brought two of the three beverages.  The third took another 10 minutes.  Seriously??  Our food took an hour. SERIOUSLY OVERPRICED!!  Several items on the menu were out.  (We arrived at noon for a brunch that was supposed to last from 10-2pm).  The menu was prix fixed at $14.  $14 for two pieces of French toast with disgusted, dried out frozen tater tots. (They had run out of home fries). The eggs Benedict were dried and hardened - just plain gross.  The eggs over easy had no runny yolk. The sausage was very good.  They served us the wrong toast.

So I was in need of a lunch and off to the garden. I decided a nice salad would do the trick so I ordered the Salad de la Burgh. While I waited for my meal I was sitting in the little room right off the bar, first thing I notice is the table is a tad sticky, then I noticed the hole in the wall. After these little gems I started to scope out the place, kind of soak in the atmosphere. \"Filth\" the joint is run down and fifthly, make matters worse was the cement block propping open the door to the patio outside ( this is the front door to the restaurant people ). \nThe restaurant was busy and my server was a pleasant enough young woman. I received my beverage and then started to check the staff out and how unkempt most of them where, jeans extremely tight and unflattering on the best figures, Harris Grill shirts were not much better trust. I long for the day when restaurants hired servers because they had mad skills not because they are young or hip. My favorite is when I realize that under the host station there were bus pans ( dirty & full ), one young employ thought nothing of maneuvering it with her foot ( disgusting it is on the floor but also the unsanitary way it was handle )\nLet me now explain the salad I got for eleven dollars and some cents. The lettuce was about a cup spring mix I think, not crisp and wilty, and kind of room temperature. The chicken was cold, so was the few fries they put on it, and a half a hardboiled egg. I think I found a few pieces of onion? Two grape size tomatoes, and two thin slices of cucumber. \"Oh\" there was a sprinkling of mozzarella or provolone cheese on it, could not tell which ( they say both so I will go for that ). This was placed in an average soup bowl. To say I will ever go back to the Harris Grill is a definite not & I will warn others to avoid. \n\"PS\" I did not expect the salad to be huge or grand but decent and somewhat hearty, this was subpar, could have gotten a better one at Wendy's and it would have been warm meat, and fries ...", "business_id": "rgmptwPbBH1wLpiBHcbIhA", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-05-05", "type": "review"}

That's right, every Tuesday is bacon night at the Harris Grill and it's amazing! I mean who doesn't like bacon? And it's even better when it's free bacon!  You don't even have to ask. It's just brought out in baskets and placed in front of you. All the bacon you can eat. What a brilliant concept! A bar wants to sell beer so why not offer something that's salty and chewy and would make you want to drink more?  \n\nOh, and the beer selection isn't all that bad either. I had a Founders Centennial IPA and a Philly Kilty Pleasure. Both paired perfectly with the bacon.\n\nThe service was spot on too... although the place was pretty crowded, I got my first beer within a minute of being there and my second beer within a minute of finishing my first. This was all accomplished while the bartender was keeping a steady stream of bacon baskets flowing from the kitchen to the bar. I was with a group of eight others and when it came time for us to leave, the bartender printed out our checks and, without even asking, every one of our checks were correct. Maybe I shouldn't be surprised at this but I think it's pretty amazing how one person can orchestrate all this, making it look so easy and keeping a pleasant demeanor with a smile on his face. \n\nOn top of a great gimmick, good beer and fantastic service, I'd be remiss if I didn't comment on the atmosphere. There's seating out doors for the warmer months. The building looks like it was a house at one time that got converted into a bar/restaurant. There's an elegant staircase heading to the second floor, a fire place giving it a nice cozy touch and there's a number of knick knacks throughout. You just feel comfortable being there.  I need to make note to stop by sometime and try one of their \"Build-A-Bowl Workshops\" for dinner.", "business_id": "rgmptwPbBH1wLpiBHcbIhA", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-03-04", "type": "review"}

This time, I came with CM and a friend of his for dinner, instead of late night drinks and snacks.  Although we came at prime time (around 7:00pm on a Sat.), unlike my last visit, it wasn't crowded at all, which was probably due to the snowy/cold weather.  This time, instead of being seated at one of the cramped tables next to the staircase, we were seated at a prime corner table upstairs with a great view of Ellsworth Ave.  Between these factors, our visit was off to a good start.\n\nAfter perusing the menu, I decided to go with the pork shank special ($17), and CM ordered the jerk chicken tacos ($12).  Additionally, as promised, I ordered the large mac and cheese again to split, to which we decided to add bacon ($13).  CM's friend went with the turkey burger ($9), which came with fries.  Upon being served, my pork shank entree looked quite impressive, impaled with a knife and surrounded by steamed veggies and some mashed potatoes.  When I tried it, however, it tasted like something from a chain restaurant--meaning that while it wasn't bad, it wasn't particularly special, either.  I didn't try CM's jerk chicken tacos, but he seemed to enjoy them, and I didn't ask his friend what he thought of the turkey burger, so I can't offer an opinion on those items.\n\nAs for the mac and cheese, this version was better than the version I'd had previously.  This time, it had an acceptable amount of cheese (although it would have been improved by even more...), and the bacon added some savory depth to the flavor.  As before, it came sprinkled with bread crumbs underneath the bacon, which gave it some extra crunch (as mentioned previously, I enjoy bread crumbs on my macaroni).  However, some of the noodles were a bit burnt (see photo)--perhaps this was due to toasting the bacon and bread crumbs on top?  Overall, while this was an improvement over the prior version of this dish I had here, it was only okay to good, failing to crack the top echelon of PGH mac and cheeses (score: 7.0/10).\n\nService was about what I'd expect for a place like this--not super attentive, but there when we needed it.  The check for CM and I came to around $50, which seemed steep for the quality of the food received.  Fortunately, I had a City Dining Card, which knocked off $10, but even so, with tip, we still almost cracked the $50 mark.  Taking everything into account, I'd be willing to return for Happy Hour or Bacon Night, but I doubt I'd return for (regular priced) dinner, since the quality:price ratio was lower than I'd like, and there are many other options in the area. 3.5 stars.", "business_id": "rgmptwPbBH1wLpiBHcbIhA", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-03-04", "type": "review"}

Their outdoor patio is delightful on warm summer evenings, and the inside, while dimly lit and a bit hipster-y, nevertheless feels welcoming and cozy. The menu is written with a heavy dose of sass and snark, which makes it a fun read. Who wants to order boring old chicken tenders when you can order \"Britney Spears\"? I should probably look into hiring their menu writer to help me jazz up my tech reports for work.\n\nAnyway, I've ordered many things here, and their food is usually solid. My favorite meal begins with a plate of their \"church basement pierogies.\" They cook up a legit pierogie, with a soft, tender shell browned to perfection and housing a ton of delicious, fluffy, flavorful potato and cheese filling. They are *almost* as good as actual church basement pierogies. Then I like to wash down my pierogies with an order of their mac and cheese topped with blackened chicken. Their mac is addictive -- creamy, rich, cheesy and topped with crunchy breadcrumbs. I really like the blackened chicken paired with the mac, as the spicy cajun seasoning on the chicken cuts through the fattiness of the cheese sauce quite nicely. Supremely delicious. I will admit that once in a blue moon the mac and cheese will be a bit dry, which is a bummer. So the consistency is not 100% there. But nine times out of ten, I'm graced with a good amount of cheese sauce and I'm a happy camper. And then I pass out in a carb-induced coma.\n\nThe downside here is, of course, their prices. They are pretty expensive. I recently got my standard pierogies-and-mac meal for take out after not having visited for awhile, and I had forgotten just how pricey they are (it was $25 + tip for my meal for take out).  So be prepared to have your wallet cry a little, but the mac and cheese should help cheer it up.", "business_id": "rgmptwPbBH1wLpiBHcbIhA", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-04-01", "type": "review"}

It is situated in a nice neighborhood and is a few minutes walk  from a really cool glass gallery. I had a $25 Groupon and a craving for burgers, so I took my friend and we ate here.\n\nWe went on a Tuesday afternoon, so the attendance was super light. I think they were only serving two other parties when we arrived, so they were super attentive to us. The environment had a really relaxing vibe as well. The menus are funny- there are puns on their food items and pictures of people (staff, regulars, etc) on their covers. \n\nI got the \"I can has bacon cheezburger\" which was pretty much the best thing to eat on a burger craving. The meat was cooked well, and the bacon was a delicious addition. Plus, the burger was really tall, which is a huge plus. Who would want to eat a small burger anyway? Psh. The only thing I was not a fan of was the bun. In my opinion, the bun was dried, but I think that was on purpose. It ended up being a little bland in my opinion. Nevertheless, it provided a well made burger that you rarely find here.\n\nHarris Grill is a fantastic place that gives you a well-proportioned and flavorful meal.

Really cool experience and it was a beautiful night to sit outside and enjoy the atmosphere.\n\nFirst, Tuesday is bacon night and I'm not quite sure how it works, but I heard it's free bacon at the bar and $1 baskets of bacon if you're sitting at a table.  My friends and I had a drink and some bacon at the bar while we waited for a table (obviously bacon night is a hit and makes the restaurant busy).  I really enjoyed the selection of beers.  I wanted to try the Game of Thrones beer, but liked the amber beer they had too much to switch.\n\nAs an app, we shared the buffalo chicken dip.  It was not the biggest portion, but it's always nice eating grilled pita instead of just tortilla chips every so often.  The dip had very large pieces of chicken and was crusted with blue cheese.  Pretty basic and well executed.\n\nThe menu is pretty simple, but difficult to read.  My friends had been there before so they knew what to look for, but I had a difficult time reading through the commentary and trying to tell what was in each dish.  One of my friends recommended something he had gotten before, so I decided that was easier than wasting my time with the menu.\n\nI got the mac and cheese and added in lobster and bacon.  It was really decadent and better than I expected.  The cheese was very creamy and flow-y.  A lot of times, the cheese on mac and cheese doesn't flow well, but I really liked the consistency of Harris Grill's mac and cheese.  The lobster was also very delicious.  As for the bacon, they just put it on top.  So basically it was lobster mac and cheese with some bacon strips on top.  I was expecting either bacon bits mixed with everything or even bacon strips submerged in the cheese.  Nonetheless, the bacon was very crispy and i dipped a few strips in the cheese which was a solid idea.", "business_id": "rgmptwPbBH1wLpiBHcbIhA", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-04-29", "type": "review"}

I tossed around a bunch of places and my boyfriend and I agreed on Harris. I checked in on the \"no wait\" app when leaving my house (a 40 minute wait was estimated), drove the 20 minute drive to Harris and was seated right away! We sat on the patio, of course, which was such gorgeous. \n\nThe brunch at Harris is a buffet- which I had no idea about until arriving. It was only $15 and included your choice of juice, a frozen mimosa or a bloody mary. I went with the frozen mimosa (duh)! It was delicious and had a nice kick of alcohol to it, which I loved ;)! The buffet was pretty impressive! Eggs benedict, chicken tenders and waffles, omelets made to order, bacon, sausage, bagels with all of the fixings, fresh fruit, potatoes and saut\u00e9ed onions with peppers and macaroni and cheese. The mac and cheese was a little dry, but everything else was AWESOME. I loved the chicken and waffles and went back up for seconds after. The sausage was also very good.

This is the Diamond of Applebee's other locations don't compare (concord location near exit 36 - their cook needs to learn from the one in Pineville)", "business_id": "DE_11y6_vCmPBlbeYskh-Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-03-03", "type": "review"}

I was out driving looking for yard sales in the area when we passed this cute little restaurant. I figured it was probably going to be some amazing southern cooking and my heart was craving some delicious buttered pancakes. To my dismay they were done with breakfast once we arrived. Ah well. No big deal.\n\nWe sat at our table and it took a bit for our server to come and talk to us, and there were only a couple people there. I felt as if our being there was an inconvenience and I was pretty bummed since I'd had such high expectations of the place. We ordered Mt. Dew & when they brought it out, it was in a can. So, obviously, no free refills. Ok. That I was even sort of ok with... \n\nWell when our food came out, I ordered the veggie plate, which was 3 sides. A salad with ranch dressing, mashed potatoes and gravy & corn were my meal & my boyfriend ordered the roast beef special that the server swore by. \n\nMy salad came out and it had only lettuce on the plate with a gallon of ranch dressing. No carrots, cheese, onions or anything but it had a slice of tomato that appeared to have mold on it. Gross. I ate a few bites of the lettuce drenched in ranch before I noticed the tomato & then I pushed it aside. My boyfriend tried the roast beef and said it was so chewy he had to grind it against his teeth for awhile to chew it up & it was just bland in general. \n\nI took a bite of the potatoes because at that point I figure it was the best thing I'd be eating at this place. I stuck them in my mouth and wow... they were flavorless. It was seriously like I'd taken a bite of textured air. Really??? So I said nothing and offered a bite to my boyfriend to see what his reaction was because I knew he wouldn't believe me if I told him. \n\nHe took the bite and stopped chewing immediately and looked at me with a questioning look, and said, \"Gross.\" The corn was good but that was seriously the only thing I could even eat. He ate a portion of his sandwich and left the rest because he just couldn't do it. I was actually a little angry by this point because I can't believe a place that has been around so long could be this terrible. \n\nWhen we got the bill, it was almost $30!!!!! Yeah and those cans of pop we ordered, $1.50 each! Ridiculous. I will never return to this place and if you're driving by I wouldn't recommend it.

I never would have known about Al Mike's (as it is known casually) without reading the reviews on Yelp.  Most people said very positive things, so we decided to go here for my birthday dinner.  There were 5 of us, and then 7 on a Saturday night.  Granted the weather was terrible, but we were easily seated at a comfortable table in the middle of the restaurant.  The waitress put up with our indecisiveness with grace and humor, and answered all of our questions very nicely.\n\nOur group started with the Fried Pickles, and even with that many people one order was enough.  Of course, if you know Fried Pickles you know that too much is not a good thing.  These were light and not greasy, even though they came out to us super-hot and fresh out of the fryer.  Their ranch dressing was wonderful, and really complimented the sharp dill taste of the pickles.\n\nOur entrees arrived very quickly, and our table ordered everything from one of the specials, to pasta, to a burrito.  All reports back on entrees were positive.  We had a vegetarian in the group and he was easily acommodated by their menu.\n\nMy Feta Chicken dish was chicken (duh) served over penne pasta with lots of veggies and covered in feta cheese.  The taste of the dish was great, and my only complaints had to do with texture.  The sauce was more of a broth, which is how it was described in the menu, but I guess I was expecting a bit more structure to it.  And, the chicken was tough.  Flavorful, but tough.  The rest of the dish was great.  The feta was lively, and there were some wonderful mushrooms in the sauce that were a treat to discover every few forkfuls.\n\nBecause it was my birthday, I got a free chocolate brownie!  It came out with a little candle in it, which was very sweet.  Our group also ordered the bread pudding.  Between the two desserts, I think the bread pudding might be the superb choice even though I'm a chocolate girl through and through.  It had a complex flavor that was just delightful.  The brownie was good, as really all brownies are.\n\nI prefer wine, and while the wine list is not extensive here I was perfectly happy with the pinot noir on the menu.  If you are a beer drinker, than this place has a ton of options for you!  The rest of my group drank beer, and heartily enjoyed it.\n\nI am so glad to have found Al Mike's, and I strongly recommend that you make the effort to find it in the 4th Ward.  It's easiest to get to off Graham Street - just turn south onto 9th and it's a block or so up the road.

The place was full and bustling on this particular Tuesday night (despite being past the dinner hour). The host (who I think has been tagged as \"Ken\" in an earlier review was friendly and found me a table for one immediately (a great corner booth that gives a good view of the establishment) and my waitress, Traci, was flawless. Clearly a neighborhood haunt, a wide variety of clientele were enjoying the evening making for some pleasant people watching.\n\nI really enjoyed my time at AM's, but I must confess that the food was good, but not great. The spicy crab soup was tasty, but not nearly spicy enough, and the 4th Ward Beef Stroganoff had a nice traditional flavor, but the sauce was too thin to stick to the meat or rotini or my ribs.\n\nMy personal business travel rules discourage me from eating at the same place twice, but if I were in need of a good comfort food meal in a place with some good energy, Alexander Michael's would be on my short list.", "business_id": "ePP0Eqz8JKSbtdt2phiB4A", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-03-26", "type": "review"}

The only part of the restaurant I didn't like was the lighting, it felt to bright/florescent.

But sometimes you just want somewhere that's laid back, not crowded and has the feel of local pub.  The interior is all hardwoods, there is an upstairs that I think is held for private parties maybe, or just overflow during the weekends.  They have pool tables and of course plenty of TV's for sporting events, etc.  Plenty of dining area as well surprisingly due to the fact it doesn't seem that large when you first walk in but most of the dining area is tucked away near the back of the place. \n\nOk, I've been here a few times, mostly for social gathering and drinks mainly but last night I actually ordered food.  I had The Black Forest sandwich.  It's a simple sandwich really, but they make it perfection!  I'll have to say, a great sandwich is only as good as the bun or bread it's made of.  This one is angelic...hahaha...ok....yeah it's good though.  They use a Bavarian pretzel roll (nicely warm and soft) as the bun.  The combination of the flavor of the bun combined with the great ham, monterey jack cheese, smoked bacon and honey mustard condiment is sandwich bliss.  My side item were there nacho chips and unfortunately all I have to say about those in comparison to the sandwich is.....meh.  They were fine, but nothing to get excited about.\n\nNow, in terms of specials, Tuesday nights is $2.00 draft nights (mostly domestic labels only).  Also they have a rewards program here and it's called the All Star Brew Club I believe.  You earn points for the beer you buy and at certain thresholds you get things like, money credited to your bill, free t-shirt, etc.  It's free to join and they give you $5 off your next order.....that's a WIN in my book :)", "business_id": "-6JY1T0w4XETux5kGOj84g", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-04-20", "type": "review"}

I guess likeable for those who really just want chips.  We asked for extra salsa (and were charged I believe 50 cents extra for each tiny tub, woof!) to make it more pleasing.  Most of us got sandwiches, which sounded really good on the menu.  And in fact my philly style chicken sandwich was tasty enough... as long as I bit into a part that had cheese on it.  It was grilled chicken, peppers, carmelized onions and provolone on a bun.  But again, it was just a bit on the dry side, and there wasn't enough cheese on it to mask that.  One of my tablemates asked if she could get a dipped sandwich - the waitress seemed confused, so I guess they don't do that so much down here, but for anyone else who is confused that's dipping the whole sandwich into whatever juicy drippings came off of the meat on the sandwich.

The biggest plus is the prices. Not many places still have dinner meal for less than $7 with 2 sides and a tea (their dinner specials come with tea). \n\nFood is typical.  Grilled pork chop is a little dry and tough. Better off with the fried pork chop. And when I said pork chop I meant super thin cut ones.  Country fried steak's gravy was the whitest I have ever seen... Thus a little bland.  It reminds me of comfort food people referring to when they talk about their grannies. Nothing against grannies (or moms), but I have found out in the 2 decades I have lived in the south that their cookings are normally pretty plain and non-eventful.

We got our drink orders and he said he would be right back, and we waited and waited...and waited some more....ugh \n\nWell, that gave us plenty of time to review the menu. There is a little bit of everything here steaks, chicken, ribs, burgers, salmon and of course pizza. \n\nSo here goes:\n\nFor our appetizer we chose the lobster end artichoke dip. It was really good nice lumps of crab and artichoke, but the portion seemed really small for the price.  But it was still good enough for me to order again...but not to share (hehe) \n\nFor the meal I ordered the special the Oriental Chicken pizza which has chicken, lettuce, wontons, mushrooms, red peppers (which I didn't get) and honey ginger dressing. Welp, it was just ok. I mean I really like the crust! It was thin and crispy and flavor from the flame grill oven was great and the honey ginger dressing was good. But it just didn't know my socks off. \n\nMy friends both had the salmon one honey glazed and the other blackened. With a side of mashed red potatoes. Now that was delicious! Comparing both, my absolute favorite was the honey glazed. It was just the right amount of sweet to not over power the salmon but give it really good flavor. It's a good thing my friends love me because I pretty much ate half their salmon....I mean to be fair I shared my pizza!

I haven't had showmars in a couple years and decided to rejuvenate my taste buds since I was craving mediterranean food. My review will be based on my experience at this location:\n\nCons:\n1. Don't expect to find a parking spot at this location, especially during busy lunch hours. \n2. Drive through line is so long it wraps around the entire store, so you may as well just park your car across the street at the CVS and walk over to dine inside.\n3. There will not be enough indoor seating, so expect to have to sit on the outside patio. This may be less tempting in the hot Charlotte summers. \n4. I ordered the gyro platter, it was a mistake! I've never been to a mediterranean place that served my gyro in separate pieces, meaning the pita was separate from my meat. Did I mention there was no veggie for my pita, the picture on there menu looks nothing like the food I got. All I got was a piece of pita by itself and a cup of beef strips. \n\nNeutral:\n1. Wait time, I waited about 10-15 minute for my order...which could be a tad faster seeing it's a fast food chain\n\nPros:\n1. Great dining booths and interior decoration for a fast food joint. seriously, the inside looked like a sit down restaurant, great that they also have patio seating option. \n2. Sanitation score is not bad, 96.5\n3. Their daily specials\n4. Milkshakes are only $2.75 (Did not taste test to see if any good so I cannot comment on quality)\n\nTip:\n-Check the board for their daily specials!! I cannot emphasize this enough. I wish I had just gotten the chicken gyro with fries which was a special going on for the day for just $5.69...The chicken gyro itself is worth $.5.29 already on the regular menu so this is a great deal. They have more than just gyros on special, they also have soup, salad etc.\n-If you want yummy authentic greek food, try greco fresh grille on Rea Rd, 10x better!

I'm here easily once a week! They have a great selection of beer and the wait staff is WONDERFUL. They're friendly and funny and if they have time, will usually sit down with you for a couple of minutes to talk and laugh. There are one or two waitresses ( the second may have left) who seem to favor certain groups over others and have given pretty lackluster service every time we have been. There's one in particular who seems to favor groups of guys over our group (probably because she thinks they'll tip better) which I think is a huge mistake on her part because I always tip 25-30% or more, even for just average service. When I went a few days ago, we had this waitress. We planned on getting three beers and some food but since she didn't seem interested in getting us drinks until we were out of beer, taking our food orders, or even just checking up on us in general, we sat there for two hours and only got two beers. If I had this experience my first time there, I never would have returned, but thankfully the other waitresses make up for it. They're wonderful company and always give really good recommendations for new beers. \n\nTheir food is delicious. Try the soft pretzels with warm cream cheese-chive dip. Or the spinach artichoke dip. Or the queso. Lauren's Goat Cheese Salad is terrific too, along with the sandwiches. The only food I have an issue with is the hummus. I'm not big on spicy hummus and  theirs has some spice mixed in that I just personally don't like. Someone else might though. Just a personal preference.\n\nAnd I cannot say enough about the beer. I have had a Crem Brulee Stout. I have had a maple bacon beer. I have had beers that most people generally could not fathom. The lowest price on any beer is $3, but it's always worth it. They have a very wide selection and if you're a beer nerd, you should really consider joining their UFO club and becoming a Beer Knurd. After 200 beers, you get a plate on the wall with your name and as crazy of a quote as you can think of. It's really fun to stare at all the plates on the ceiling after a few beers too. \n\nAll in all, despite the tiny issues of the spicy hummus and the waitress that gives biased service, this place is still deserving of the 5 stars.

I can recall back in the day you could get any pint off nearly half of their brew selection for $2.50. Now-a-days, not much has changed. I still get up nearly once a week and attempt to chip away at my UFO club membership. \n\nFor those who don't know about their UFO Club, by becoming a member you are given a card in which you attempt to try 200 different types of brews. The membership is $20, comes with a free T-shirt, and gives you access to a free brunch every Sunday. You also get a \"plate party\" for you and a few friends, in which you create a custom plate to mount on their wall with your name on it. \n\nOk and not trying to be creepy or anything but their servers are absolutely amazing. Very friendly and more pleasing to your eye than your local busted-ass Hooters girl.

This also means that it can be absolutely packed, and when there are a few college basketball games on, it's even more so.\n\nThis is because the Tavern is not only a restaurant, it is a sports bar.  That makes it a little difficult to classify, but I'll do my best.\n\nFirst, you have a largish bar area.  This section alone is larger than many sports bars these days, and it looks even larger because it's open, rather than being cramped and confined.  While there did not seem to be any smokiness to the area, there could have been some.  It was definitely loud, as most any bar will be on this sort of night.\n\nNext, you have a dining section, which wouldn't be much different than any other family-style dining area, except for the fact that it was right next to the bar.  So if you take the family, you'll want to be aware of this.  It's not exactly set up for a quiet night out, even on the calmest of times, and this certainly wasn't that.\n\nThe good news for older crowds (those without younger kids) is that if you're waiting for a table, you can wait in the bar section.  They also have these very long tables that run the length of the bar area, and you can even eat there if you don't mind the crowd.  We didn't really feel like waiting, and since the whole building had a sort of bar feel to it, felt like it really didn't matter.\n\nIn the end, it didn't.  The only problem with this was getting the attention of a waitress.  Once we did, service went along fairly well, though getting refills was a bit slow.\n\nThe food was good, and priced decently, but appetizers were expensive, as can be expected in most bars.  Wings especially were not cheap.  But it was all tasty.  I don't know that we'll be back, but it's certainly better than most bars, and definitely a leg up on most sports bars.", "business_id": "r-pBY6vR_Iu5XhPRvPnquw", "stars": 3, "date": "2007-03-26", "type": "review"}

We ordered I food pretty fast, so there should have been no reason for us to get it after we had been there almost an hour.

I talked to the same manager I'm sure that fixed the first problem and he said sorry and is supposed to send me a gift certificate.  Apparently this happens more often than not because he didn't find it strange at all.  Moral is and I know that I don't need to tell you this but always check your food.

You just get the feeling that the people eating there aren't really enjoying themselves.\n\nThe food is really bad.  The riblets that I had during my last visit tasted like they were a few days old and had been microwaved, even the bones were dry and there was an odd freezer burned like taste.  My mother had a steak and after cutting into it and taking a bite, she swore that it had been microwaved.  We both had salads which seemed to be extremely small and were made with ingredients that were close to their expiration date (limp lettuce, slimy tomatoes, and old cheese).  I should also mention that the salads were served warm along with lukewarm dressing.\n\nThe overall service was nothing to really write home about (as the old saying goes).  Given the ratio of waitresses to customers, one would expect the service to be more prompt, but it wasn't.  The food also seemed to take a really long time to come out, about 45 mins for a steak with fries and riblets with fries, it may have actually been closer to an hour.\n\nIf you're in the area and in a bind to find something to eat, I recommend that you either find somewhere else to go or just save your money and hit one of the local grocery stores.  Since Applebee's is a chain, I don't think Kitchen Nightmares will be coming to save them :)", "business_id": "98hOHm56D0Boz2LCg0-irg", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-03-26", "type": "review"}

Don't they realize that #1) Mac 'n' Cheese doesn't need any garlic, and #2) that people come here for lunch and need to get back to work, and there's no way that this amount of garlic is going to be a good thing for the person that eats it! \n\nI'm certain there's got to be better BBQ places in N.

However, it didn't work at my table because either they didn't turn on the system or it was broken. \n\nLet me say, this place is not somewhere to eat. It's a drinking place. That being said, I ordered the BBQ burger and it was stacked (which isn't bad). However, there's a catch to it. You would imagine, yeah burger comes with fries right? Wrong. Fries are a dollar extra on top of your $8-9 burger ($2 if you want onion rings) So, if you decide to get a burger, prepare that there will not be any sides. However, I believe that their burger is something to get and actually more than their BBQ. \n\nMy family enjoyed what they ordered, baked potato with a salad and smokehouse burgers. I don't think they had really anything special about it, except that they said it wasn't as oily as other restaurants. (But come on, it's supposed to be greasy!)\n\nThanks to those who reviewed here on yelp, my family and I stayed away from the brisket! And plus, I think no where can compare briskets to Mac's (check out my review on them). Until then, I'll be sure to mention it. I think my next trip for BBQ will be Mac's, but if you're in the Hilton and you're starving for BBQ you really have no other choice.

Ever notice how so many BLTs are lacking in the mayo department? Not at Pine Cone. A literally perfect sandwich.\n\nNow. About that chicken 'n dumpling soup. Here is, word for word, an actual text message I sent to my boyfriend: \"Do you think if we called ahead, they'd sell us like, a quart of that soup to go? I think it's worth trying.\" Most chefs CAN make chicken soup...not many can make it PERFECTLY. Pine Cone does. Well-made soup is very, very important to me, and something I tend to judge a restaurant on. This soup is perfect - excellent meat/veggie ratio, dumplings that are neither too fluffy nor too chewy, but right in between, just salty enough...I could go on and on, but the bottom line is, if you've never had this soup, you owe it to yourself to go out RIGHT NOW and get some. \n\nMy boyfriend usually gets the biscuits and gravy, and they are also excellent (we eat a lot of those too...). \n\nPrices are cheap, service is fast, food is unbelievable...that's all there is to it.

Also, though, I consider myself somewhat of a french toast aficionado. (Whatever that means.) Let me just say: this is NOT for the weak of heart - literally. Pretty sure I locked myself in to a diagnosis of diabetes within the next 6 months. There were three of their housemade cinnamon rolls - a perfect amount, you think, as you dive in with your fork. You immediately realize that you'll need a knife for these bad boys, though, as the sugary everythingness of it is essentially encased in a caramelized shell of even more sugar. I LOVE that there is icing inside - not many cinnamon-roll-french-toast-serving establishments can claim this about the dish. However, after two-thirds of the dish, I was ready to throw up, and had to force the rest down my throat (not because I payed a lot for it, just because I wanted to tell Yelp that I almost threw up eating these).

There are a few places in the mag that I am looking forward to trying but Green Lantern was the first one that we hit up.  \n\nDriving up the place looked kind of small and beat up which was not what I was expecting and not looking forward to.  As we got closer however I realized how big this place was on the inside.  It's huge!   At least it felt huge from where we were sitting.  I'm not sure if it was the article in the magazine that attributed to how crazy busy this place was or if there was a concert or what but this place was insane.  I mean we had to wait for an hour for our table.  On the plus side we had to wait an hour for our table which meant an hour of drinking so I can't really complain.\n\nBecause we had been waiting for so long we also had a chance to look at the menu so when we  finally sat down we knew exactly what we wanted; the waitress loved this.  We started with the calamari which I'm starting to find out is not one of Wisconsin's strong suits.  I don't think I have ever had good calamari here; maybe this will be my next food challenge 'The Great Calamari Showdown'!  Anyway, I had a few pieces of that and let the man have the rest'' he actually really liked it.  \n\nI ordered the salad which was huge, cheesy mashed potato, and 3 pieces of the lightly breaded cod.  The man order the same but with cheesy hash browns.  The fish was pretty good.  It was juicy and fresh and not bad.  I thought it was maybe just a little over the top with the seasoning.  I think I would have enjoyed it more if the flavors were a bit more subtle as opposed to all up in my face the way it was.  With that said however I though it was alright.  The man on the other hand was in love.  He likened his enjoyment of this place to the Tornado Room.  Pure blasphemy.  He clearly doesn't know anything about food. \n\nAll in all I am glad I tried this place but I don't think I will be making it a regular haunt.", "business_id": "rdAdANPNOcvUtoFgcaY9KA", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-03-09", "type": "review"}

We order drinks, appetizer, and the entrees right away since we've been here before and the kids are starving. We get the salads and app right away which was mediocre at best. Crab cakes which are my wife's favorite and she didn't even finish the plate. The wait for entrees was getting long and the little kids were getting restless especially the 1-1/2 year old. When the plates were being delivered of course the waitress dropped a couple of them which \"Murphy's law\" says its the kids food who are impatient ones. The waitress says she sorry and puts a quick order in right away. My wife and I ordered steak which the kids won't eat so they have nothing. BTW they ordered chicken strips and fries so not very hard to make. By now the young one is having a full on meltdown and the 6 year old needs to use the restroom. \"Awesome\" they eventually deliver the chicken strips only to find that they are raw in the middle. We ask to have carry out containers so we can put our steaks in and leave. The waitress was so generous and gave us $10 off the bill (little sarcasm) \nWe head home and have to stop at Culvers to grab the kids dinner while are steaks are getting cold in styrofoam containers.

The Stamm House is walking distance from home, so I figured we HAD to try it... \n\nFirst off, let me say that the atmosphere is typical old(emphasis on the old)-school Wisconsin restaurant. Wood paneling, dated tables and chairs, and GOD AWFUL seventies music piped in. When we walked in(at six on a Saturday night) there was one couple at the bar, and another couple dining upstairs near us. The waiter seated us--close to the kitchen, I realized with disappointment. If I want to hear dishes clanging and the hustle and bustle, I'd be cooking at home. Dining out is for pretending that there's no work involved. It also didn't help that because it was so slow in the restaurant, I could hear every comment the waiter said to the cook-staff, some of which wasn't patron-friendly. \n\nThe BF ordered the fried walleye,and I the beef tips Moutarde. His french onion soup was decent, but my salad was lacking. When the meal arrived, I was so excited because I was STARVED. I picked up a piece of beef with my fork and bit down into tender, juicy...FAT. Fatty fatty fatness. Ewww. I did the not-so-sexy-spit-it-onto-the-side-plate maneuver. All right. Every now and then you get a fatty piece of meat in a dish. A girl can move on. MY next bite was better, and although the sauce was decent, it was nothing fabulous. I was disappointed when my next piece was also quite fatty. You know when you get that cheap meat that is mostly sinew and fat. *Sigh* I'm done. I pushed the dish off to the side and settled for my potato. \n\nTo give credit, the waiter noticed I wasn't eating the dish, and asked me if something was wrong. I told him, and he offered to get me something else, which I declined(by the time it was made, Chris would have been done with his dish). Later, he also offered a free dessert, which we really didn't want. He ended up knocking almost half off my dish, which was appropriate, I think. \n\nOver all, it just wasn't enjoyable. I could have gotten over picking a bad dish if the experience itself was nice, but it wasn't. Average at best. The waiter was decent and tried to be accommodating, but on the whole, it was just sub-par. I left wishing that I had picked another spot to spend my hard earned date-night budget!

Quaint and cozy, lots of comfort foods.  Nothing spectacular, though the homemade breads are quite good.  A bit on the pricey side and can fill-up with people quickly, especially on the weekends.\n\nDetailed review:\nI've lived near C's for about a year now, and have never stopped-in to check it out.  Folks at work gave mixed reviews - some raved about the place, others gave it a \"Meh.\"  I run past it nearly every morning and they always seem to have a good-sized crowd, especially on Saturdays and Sundays, so I figured it had to be somewhat decent... with that, I treated myself to a breakfast this morning.\n\nI wandered in at around 9:30am on Memorial Day and was pleased to find plenty of seating.  The hostess offered me a table outside, which was a nice bonus - the weather was gorgeous, so I happily took the offer.  I also grabbed one of their complimentary/shared newspapers to read.\n\nA waitress stopped by to ask for my drink order - I went with coffee - and to drop off a menu.  She came back a few minutes later with an acrylic coffee cup and a stainless coffee carafe.  She left to tend to another table; I needed some cream for the coffee... oh well, it was nice and I was happy to continue browsing the menu, sans cream for my coffee.\n\nBreakfast offerings were ordinary: eggs, hashbrowns, pancakes, omelets, skillets, and a couple of extras, like eggs benedict, belgian waffles, and some homemade pastries (turnovers, donuts, muffins, cookies, etc).\n\nThe waitress stopped by to ask if I was ready to order - told her I decided on the \"Hen's Nest\" which consisted of 2 eggs, hashbrowns, and toast.  I also ordered a pancake, and requested some cream for the coffee.  She apologized and immediately brought some half-n-half containers.  We were in business.  \n\nBefore leaving to take my order to the kitchen, she asked if I'd like anything in the hashbrowns.  I was pleased!  C's has some specialty hashbrown items on the menu, but I didn't want to order a huge plate of them... so, when the offer surfaced to add onions, peppers, tomatoes, etc to my potatoes, I jumped at the chance.\n\nFood came about 20 minutes later and looked tasty.  The pancake was a lot thinner than I had pictured, but it was quite tasty.  I found myself wishing I had ordered 2.  \n\nThe Hen's Nest was just \"OK\" - the hashbrowns weren't greasy and featured a nice, crispy char,  but the onions and peppers didn't do much for flavor, oddly enough... I found the entire dish to be largely flavorless.  :-(  \n\nThe multigrain toast was very good - and was probably the star of the entire meal.  The waitress only stopped by once more - to drop off the check, which was a bit of a shocker as well... $12 for my modest breakfast - $5.99 for the Hen's Nest, $0.89 for adding extras to the hashbrowns, $2.99 for one (1) pancake (!!!), $1.89 for coffee.\n\nService = 2 stars (nothing great)\nFood = 3 stars (average breakfast fare)\nValue = 1.5 stars (quite pricey for what it was)\nMISC = 3 stars (bakery items looked stellar, nice outdoor patio, very relaxing)\n\nI'd really like to give C's 2.5 stars, but I'm feeling a bit generous so, it's a 3-star \"gift\" rating.  Had I been in a crankier mood, it would've gone 2-stars... :-)\n\nFor what it's worth, I think the Hubbard Avenue Diner has a better overall breakfast, and it's about 1/2 the price.  It'll probably be a while before I visit C's again.", "business_id": "B0Vuwn6Hugc-0U5n31YBfg", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-05-31", "type": "review"}

The place looks really good but I was really disappointed with their food. We reached there at around 1:30 PM in the afternoon and they were serving brunch!! I was slightly skeptic about it and went ahead to see what they got in their brunch buffet!! Almost everything sucks in their menu except the omelette and bacon. They had some donuts, muffins, bacon, cut fruits, scrambled egg, pancakes with two different types of maple syrup, sausages, beef, ham, shrimp and some cakes. They even had a live omelette bar where the chef was standing and looking at others faces instead of letting people know that it's is a live omelette bar. Half the time, he wasn't available as they ran out of butane and hence he was taking the omelette mixture with our choice of add-ons to the kitchen to prepare it and getting it back to the customers. Everyone including me for the first 35 minutes just saw that section, didn't knew what to do and left. Later my sister figured it out that it was an omelette bar which made me go there and order one. Omelette was one of the item which didn't disappoint me. The fruits were just randomly cut and thrown into a huge bowl that was just lying in a place for a very long time which eventually changed the taste of the fruits. Pancakes were okay. The maple syrup wasn't up to the mark. Donuts sucked. Muffins were average. Bacon is good. Sausage and scrambled egg were okay. Cakes weren't good. Shrimp - I didn't even touch them looking at the presentation. The staff weren't friendly enough. They didn't even take care of us properly. They were in bloody hurry always though it was just a brunch going on . They were not changing or replacing the dishes on the buffet counter. They weren't even picking the plates off our tables until I went to one of them and asked them to replace them. \nI didn't like the food and the service at this place. I don't know how it would be if I order from the menu. Maybe it would be good as per the other reviews. But they didn't pull off the brunch properly. The cost of the food wasn't worth it at all.

The margaritas were OVERPRICED ($5.75 for a 16 oz plain lime margarita on the rocks), and the food was okay. I had the blackened fish sandwich which was great... my sweet potato chips were not fresh.

Probably some person that said, \"good enough, let's go make some money\".\nOur burgers yesterday were about 10 bucks each and just basic burgers that should have cost about 4 bucks.   The meat didn't have any distinctive flavor and was rather skimpy, the sauce was not complimentary to the sandwich and the bun was generally regular too.   At least the bun was fresh.  \nI would only recommend this place to my Republican friends because they have no ability to think for themselves anyway and might actually like the place.\nIf you're looking for paradise you won't find it here.

I was greeted by a revolving door that looked like the windows hadn't been cleaned since the last time Jimmy Buffet was in town.  We were seated at our booth, but before I could slide on in I asked if they would wipe the liquid off of the seat.  I went to the bathroom and washed my hands (the bathroom is another story) When I came back, the liquid was still on the seat of the booth.  The waitress just sluffed off the fact i was agitated by the lack of customer service.  Seriously.  How hard is it to wipe off the booth.\n\nThe food was decent.  Nothing great, but ok.  Portions are weak however.  You'll probably have to venture across the lot to McDonalds for a Big Mac afterward if you want to be full.  A Big Mac would probably be as flavorful as the burgers served here. \n\nWhat irked me about my trip here was the service.  First was the lack of caring when it came to the booth's cleanliness.  Second, I never got a refill on my soda.  For $2.49, I'm sure jimmy could afford another glass of soda.  It took our waitress nearly 10 minutes to collect come back with our bill.  It was like they took my debit card and walked to my bank instead of swiping it to collect payment.\n\nThey get two stars because I didn't have to choke down the food.

We knew what we were getting ourselves into, going to an Applebee's and whatnot, but what transpired was so ridiculous, I expected Ashton Kutcher (or at least the host of \"How to Catch a Predator\") to pop out and we all LOL about how horrible the experience was.  Instead, I left the restaurant with an empty feeling in my heart, as a wave of sadness washed over me knowing I had just lost two hours of my life inside a low-rate Applebee's.\n\nWe were first greeted by a host who didn't greet us. He showed us to our table, set down the menus, and sidled back over to the host stand without making a sound.  In fact, I can't be positive he wasn't a ghost sentenced to life in purgatory as an Applebee's host. However I forgot to check if his feet were floating or walking, so we'll never be sure.\n\nThe waitress seemed nice enough, but it soon became evident that this woman was about to have a serious breakdown and that we were about to be her therapists, whether we liked it or not (we didn't).\n\nShe came back with our drinks after a bit of a wait saying, \"it's like pulling teeth to get that bartender to make us drinks, we even have to have the manager back there making them too!\".  Very professional.  As she was taking our order, I asked her if she knew whether or not a particular menu item had red dye, as I have an allergy. She was going to check in the kitchen. \"Be right back!\" she said, and we believed her.  Five minutes later, we see her emerge from the kitchen, taking food out to other tables, filling waters, and taking more drink orders to the surly bartender.  She returned to our table in a huff, her response to my red dye inquiry was severely alarming.  \"The chef says there's no way for us to know if it has dye it in or not.  We'd have to go look it up somewhere, so he said you just shouldn't order it.\"  Now I'm not under any sort of delusion that Applebee's is the kind of restaurant where the produce comes in fresh every morning, and the chefs have been trained in the French Alps.  However, I would expect at least *some* transparency, or you know, maybe just go look it up.  \n\nAs we started to order our food (maybe without red dye, who knows?!), the day started to really fall apart.  First of all they were out of mozzarella sticks.  As we all know, mozzarella sticks are among the top 3 reasons to go to Applebee's, along with $2 long islands and 1/2 priced apps after 10 pm.  The waitress tried to explain to us their newly revamped appetizer menu (albeit without mozzarella sticks) but had no clue what she was talking about.  Somehow she walked away after telling us the particular items we ordered could not come out simultaneously, and whatever was ready first was going to come out.  This came down to me getting my entree before my friends' appetizers came, and my friends' entrees coming out about 45 minutes after everyone else had finished their meal.\n\nThroughout the whole meal, and I use \"meal\" loosely because we had nothing to eat for the majority of the time, we could hear the waitstaff going around to every table apologizing for something.  It was complete disarray.  \"Sorry for the wait, we are so busy!\" (as we're surrounded by empty tables), \"There's a 15 minute wait for drinks, because we only have 1 blender!\" (like, what?)  Not to mention they were spilling drinks, precious 15-minute wait drinks, everywhere.  The manager dumped an smoothie on someone's lap, a waiter spilled a drink all over an empty booth (which the mute host then sat a family at before it was cleaned, and a woman sat directly in the puddle), and another waitress was dribbling Bloody Marys across the restaurant at a rate so fast, you'd have thought it was a scene from Dexter. We were being patient, but other tables weren't as gracious.  One man walked up to the bar to get his table's drinks after they sat untouched for 10 minutes.  That guy was cool: he really tore into the manager for being so unorganized and they had to get another waitress.\n\nWe put in an order for another round of drinks, and hunkered down for the extreme wait that was likely to follow.  10 minutes later (we got lucky!) she came back with one too many margaritas.  \"Oh gosh!  You only ordered two of those right? Oh okay... well, this one is on me!\" which was nice enough, except she went on to complain about what a horrible day she was having, and how her whole life was ruined because another waitress made her switch sections.  \n\nBy the time the final entrees surfaced, we had them boxed up immediately to leave.  It took 30 minutes from the time we asked for the check to the time she brought it out, after being there for 2 hours.  The cherry on top was when she took $3 out of her own tips and laid it on the table for the extra margarita. That had to have been one of the most absurd things I'd ever seen.  Couldn't she just take it off our bill? Like we're really going to take your $3 off the table.\n\nAnyway, food was", "business_id": "JdCFcgw4yk4M1ZRhAhBIag", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-03-02", "type": "review"}

The cook regularly comes out to chit-chat and joke with the customers. It's always a treat. :)\n4. They work hard to support local farmers, with dedicated local and organic specials featuring produce, meats and dairy from area growers. \n5. Their homemade biscuits are to DIE for.\n6. Try the pies.

He also never introduced himself. \nAfter looking over the entire menu the only thing that really jumped out at me was their milk shakes and ice creams.

(Saut\u00e9ed spinach, onions, tomatoes and two poached eggs on top of crusty sourdough bread and finished with Mornay sauce & American fried potatoes  $8.99).

If you go expecting an upscale \"gastro-pub\" experience of chic bar food, then you will be disappointed. There are no waiters, and you seat yourself. You order food and drinks at the bar, and  a food runner brings out your order when it's ready. Its got a dive bar atmosphere, and the interior is pretty run down. \n\nAfter fighting for a table due to the crowd that was rapidly accumulating in anticipation of that evening's band, my friends and I perused the menu. It contains primarily stereotypical bar food (burgers, fries, onion rings, etc), but there are a few exceptions. There are several vegetarian options, including veggie nachos, so if you're a non meat eater, you would probably find lots of things to order at The Harmony. Most notably, The Harmony offers a walnut burger. I'm told they're famous for it, so I ordered the walnut burger with blue cheese and a side of homemade potato chips with \"Bleu Cheese Dip\". (What can I say, I really, really love Blue Cheese!) It took awhile for the food to come out, so we drank beer while we waited. Our table of about 10 people ordered 3 pitchers to share. I am not sure what all of them were, but in honor of the WI bar experience, I stuck to PBR. It was as good as PBR can be.\n\nOnto the food: The blue cheese walnut burger came topped with a creamy blue cheese sauce in addition to blue cheese crumbles, rather than plain blue cheese crumbles like I had been anticipating. It also came with onion, lettuce, tomato, and mayo. The lettuce and tomato were exceptionally fresh and ripe looking. I was really impressed, especially by the tomato (it was actually red!). I bit into it and was immediately transported to blue cheese heaven. It was fantastic. I will qualify this praise with the statement that the reason I loved this burger so much was largely a result of the copious blue cheese flavor. I am not sure the walnut burger itself was why it tasted so great. The chips were also awesome. They arrived piping hot. Some were crunchy and others were chewier. It was clear that they were made to order. The Bleu Cheese Dip they came with was similar to what came on my burger, and as a result, was amazing. \n\nWe ate as the band played and just reveled in how fun the whole experience was. By the way, the band was great! It was a Rockabilly group called The Fast Clydes. If you like that style of music, I couldn't recommend them more. They had a ton of energy and knew how to work the crowd. I had a blast. \n\nAll this said, there are a few things that I think The Harmony could improve upon. First off, the tables in the main dining area are plastic. They're the exact same tables that you played beer pong on in college. I feel like The Harmony excels in spite of its dive bar atmosphere, and not necessarily because of it. Therefore, if they invested just a little bit of money to spruce up the interior, I think they would see a return. The Atwood area is still rocking that hippie vibe, for sure, but more and more, I am noticing newer and more upscale establishments. To me, that says that there's probably a market for it and the times, they are a changin'. Also, I don't mind ordering food and drinks at the bar. However, I think The Harmony would benefit from offering table service, at least during shows on Friday and Saturday night. I have only ever been to The Harmony with a group, and it sucks to have to walk away from the conversation to get another beer, a process which can take 10 or 15 minutes if it's crowded. All-in-all, these drawbacks are minor, and I'll be back at The Harmony many times this summer!", "business_id": "KHOHjA8HOcTlFBCtMQFv8A", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-05-10", "type": "review"}

Went here for lunch and my fiance was excited because the burger came with \"Unlimted Fries\".  Put in our orders for two burgers (his with fries, mine fruit--I do like the option of getting fruit with my burger) within minutes of sitting down.  However, it took 20 minutes to get our food.  The place was NOT busy. There were plenty of open tables and plenty of open seats at the bar, where we were seated.  \n\nAbout 5 minutes after getting our food, my fiance let them know that he would like more fries.  We finished eating, and waited for the fries.  And waited for fries. And waited for fries.  20 minutes we sat there and waited. They continually told us \"They'll be up soon\" and \"Your fries are on the way\".  I did make a point to communicate with the waitress that I needed to get back to work, and continually asked how much longer it would be, and eventually asked if we could get them in a to-go box because I was already late to work. However, the waitress seemed more interested in flirting with some of the guys at the bar than our needs.  This is for LUNCH TIME.  Eventually, we just had to leave because it was impossible to wait any longer.  \n\nIf the menu says \"Unlimited fries\", then provide your customer with unlimited fries! It should not be necessary to wait the entire time it takes to get a full order, just to get some more fries.  I know that french fries are not usually made in individual orders. They make a big batch and split them on the plates as necessary. There were at least 3 other plates of fries that came out of the kitchen in the 20 minutes we were waiting.  I also know that it does not take 20 minutes to fry some french fries. \n\nPoint is, if you are going to make a point to put the word \"Unlimited\" on the menu, then bring the customer the item that is unlimited.

Around 7:30 on a Friday night we walk in to the sign that says \"Please Seat Yourself\".  So we walk through the Pool Table area to get to the back dining area, since it was close to the salad bar.  After searching for a highchair for my son, with no help from the waitress filling the salad bar right next to us, we all sit down at a table.  A few moments after sitting down a waitress (Older Woman) came to our table. She took our drink order: two waters with lemon, a Sierra Mist and a chocolate milk, and disappeared.  She reappeared with our drinks a few minutes later.  The waitress takes our orders, Two Cod Fish Frys and a Perch Fish Fry.  We were informed that the salad bar was included with our meal.  Well... From the time we walked into Tully's II to the time we left they were stocking the salad bar, which is not a large spread.  After 10 minutes of watching this woman stock the salad bar at a snails pace and a distasteful look on her face, we had to ask for silverware and plates. Apparently the woman stocking it didn't seem to notice that they were all gone. I'm sure she thought it was nice that nobody was bothering her as she stocked the bar, not ever considering that nobody could eat from it even if they wanted to.  As my wife gets her first plate from the salad bar our meal shows up 20-25 minutes after placing our order.  Really? That long for a fish fry in Wisconsin?  Then came disappearing act two from our waitress!! The food consists of Heavily battered, greasy fish and tiny french fries.  No tartar sauce, no ketchup, no butter for the rolls on the table or salad bar.  We had to ask another waitress for some tarter sauce.  Another 20 minutes creeps slowly past as we waited for our waitress to come back to check and see if we may want a few more pieces of fish being the fact that we did order \"All You Can Eat\" fish.  At this point we have watched 3 other waitresses continue to mess around with this Salad Bar, chatting each other up and texting on their cell phones, while other tables are getting as frustrated as we are.  One table had to go to the Salad Bar to get food since nobody bothered to greet them at all. Our waitress later commented that she thought someone else had taken their order. Another table had to get up and walk to the kitchen to ask for their bill... they were lucky enough to have the same disappearing waitress we had.  We did notice that our waitress came out of the kitchen a number of times (7 to be exact) to bring things to the two tables closest to the kitchen. But anything past those two ... it's like we didn't even exist. and probably could have walked out without anyone ever noticing. Finally, only after the man asked for his bill, did our waitress reappear to ask if we wanted any more fish.  We mentioned at that time that it would be nice to have some ketchup even though most of our fries had been eaten at that point. We also asked for 3 Pieces of Perch, 4 pieces of baked Cod and a refill of Sierra Mist. Not too difficult to remember.  10 minutes later she comes to our table: 1 piece of Perch, 2 pieces of Cod, 3 pieces of  baked cod and no refill.  10 minutes after that our waitress came back to the table and before she could ask us anything, I immediately asked for our bill.  45 seconds later she returns with my card, the fastest thing this lady had done ALL night.  On our way out, we stopped to talk to a manager, briefly describing the WORST SERVICE we had ever had.  I paid first because I didn't want him to think we were trying to get anything free.  When we pointed out our waitress, he didn't look surprised.  All he had to say was \" I hope you come back and give us  another chance\", not \"is there anything I can do to make it right?\" or \"come back and have a meal on us\"..... nothing.  We walked out utterly disgusted!!  The only reason Tully's II is getting one star is because there is no ZERO star option.  Would not...would not.... would not recommend this place to anyone.. EVER.

I consistently get the steak and lake perch and the last few times I've had it, the steak has been perfectly cooked to order.  The lake perch has been the downfall for me, though.  The fish tastes like freezer to me and always has tons of bones in it.  I would much rather go to the Avenue for lake perch.  Always get a baked potato, and it's hard to ruin that.   Salad is nothing to write home about - just a bowl of lettuce, but I do like their French dressing.  Rolls are always cold with rock hard butter.  I noticed last night that I had two fewer pieces of perch than I normally get.  Husband always gets the lake perch dinner and he loves it, but I think his tastebuds are slipping in old age.  We love that they are so good to our toddler here and they give out a treat to little ones at the end of the meal.  Service is usually prompt, but last night it was severely lacking even though it was slow with several open tables.  Took us 1.5 hours between ordering and finishing the meal, which is unacceptable.  Waitress made several errors with our orders, took 20 minutes to get white milk, drinks sat empty for 20 minutes as well.  Tip for those who want to try it - avoid the extremely busy Fridays and go later on a Saturday.  You can still order lake perch (although I told my husband that we will only go to the Avenue from now on after last night's debacle).", "business_id": "FIR1SRvSAMNTO3VvNaJn2g", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-03-23", "type": "review"}

Sooo much so. All the classic beers are available - Schlitz, Old Style, etc., both of which we ordered.

It was hot, a little greasy, and in thin fillets. The flavor was pretty indistinguishable from my companion's lake perch. Wasn't blown away, but nothing was bad. The salad was just iceberg lettuce, a bit on the dried out side, but still fine.

Place looks like a dump but looks can be deceiving. Like any true supper club you MUST and absolutely MUST sit at the bar and have a drink or two or three or in many cases when Toby's is busy five or six drinks before you seat. We went on Monday and it was super busy. I can't even imagine what Fridays or Saturdays are like. So, you order at the bar and a waitress will come get you when your table is ready. When your table is ready your salads are waiting for you with an assortment of relish, rolls, and cinnamon buns .classic supper club. Then your food comes out pretty fast. I got the blue gill and shrimp combo with hash browns. My friends got the perch and pan fried chicken which looked amazing. AND HUGE!!! Nothing was extremely remarkable in appearance but the taste was good ol fashion comfort food. And it was fried perfectly. Speaking of old fashion, you better order korbel old fashions here. Is there any other drink that says Supper Club like Korbel Old Fashion. Also another thing to note is our hash browns were served family style since we all ordered them as a side dish. I'm definitely coming back to try that chicken .oh, and the shrimp were gigantic. Literally HUGE shrimp. Not even sure how it is possible to serve such big shrimp in Wisconsin at that affordable of a price. Love this place.

(This review is for the Friday Fish Fry.)\n\nIf you haven't been before it can seem a little confusing and crowded. Calm down. Nudge your way in and order a drink from the bartender that never forgets. Rail drinks are about $3.50 a piece ($3.75 for an old fashioned) ridiculously reasonable. They also have a surprisingly good selection of beer and wine. (If you need menus ask while ordering your drink.) Find a waitress and place your order. Find a place to kick it for at least the next hour - that sometimes means hovering if you are looking for a place to sit. \n\nWhen your table is ready your waitress will seat you. Salads, relish, and bread will all be waiting. I love the classic aspect of a relish tray. The dressings have that old style taste to them so keep that in mind when ordering (a la not Kraft.) Almost as soon as you can finish your salad a very hot portion of fish will brought to you. My dining partner got the baby pike with a baked potato and I had the cod with French fries - we shared everything. The pike was super delicious, a mild fish taste with a very light breading. The cod was flakey and coated and fried up marvelously - a perfect brown. The baked potato was absolutely huge and came with a solid helping of sour cream. The French fries are flat cut and fried up nice and golden. Far better than your typical restaurant fries - they could have used a little more salt for my taste but that's why there is a shaker on the table. At the end of the meal you also get a sweet treat. \n\nThe service is spectacular at every end of the operation. From the bartenders, waitresses, to bus boys, everyone is friendly and willing to get you what you need. I definitely recommend this place for when you have the time to just sit back with some cocktails and a fish fry - our meal took about 2 1/2 hours all together - so expect at least that on a Friday night!", "business_id": "FIR1SRvSAMNTO3VvNaJn2g", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-03-14", "type": "review"}

We live on the west side of Madison so it it took a little drive just to get here, but Toby's has been on the bucket list for a while (often rated the best supper club in the greater Madison area) and it was my birthday.  To begin, the bartender we had was amazing.  He made great drinks, and was quick at it.  Their old fashioned's were great.  We put in our order for 2 entrees and an appetizer.  The place is standing room only for the most part because it is so packed.  We got our appetizer but a table wasn't available yet, so we ate our moz sticks while standing at the bar.  They were actually amazing, but how can you screw that up?  It was about 90 minutes before we were finally seated.  We ate are salads and rolls and whatnot because we were starving.  It was probably close to 30 minutes after being seated that we got our entrees.  My New York strip was perfectly medium as requested.  It was very tender and juicy.  The hashbrowns with cheese were pretty bland and nothing to write home about.  She got the steak and shrimp, and thought it was was cooked well but under-seasoned also.  The waitresses were running around and quite busy, which resulted in getting very little in terms of service.  I had to go to the bar for more drinks because we got so little attention.  We were very disappointed at this point with the service and the amount of time spent there and asked for the check.  The atmosphere was very typical of a supper club, except for the fact that the bar was packed 3 deep and it was very loud with conversation.  This might have been more exciting to us if we were locals and knew other people.  I will gladly skip out on the drive and long wait for food to go to Klassic Tavern in Verona, or other similar establishments on the west side, rather than come back.  If you're a local or have recently eaten, Toby's is a great option for you.  I will say the patrons were friendly and helpful, as we didn't know how the ordering process works.  The bartender basically gives you a menu and you wait for a waitress walking around to see you and take your order on the spot.  I would probably be a regular here if I lived in McFarland, but I have better options closer, and I don't get how this has numerous nominations as best Madison area supper club.", "business_id": "FIR1SRvSAMNTO3VvNaJn2g", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-04-10", "type": "review"}

I know that servers and waitstaff have a demanding job, and I tip well even for mediocre service. However, truly bad service is inexcusable. I came with a couple of friends and ordered a frozen margarita. When my drink was brought out, the server spilled the entire drink all over me. This isn't what bothers me. At another restaurant I'd be totally willing to forgive and forget. It happens. Her reaction was what soured the experience. She gave me a half-hearted, insincere apology and brought me out two extra napkins. Mind you, the full drink was all over my lap and running down my leg - not a two-napkin fix. I asked for more napkins, and it took a couple minutes, but she did come back. She offered to make a new drink, but I told her to forget it and bring me an iced tea. She did, and the meal was fine. The food is alright, but nothing spectacular. I had a cheeseburger and fries, and it was pretty good. I liked the fried green bean appetizer with wasabi ranch sauce quite a bit. The real shock came at the end of the meal. We had separate checks, and not only was I never offered a discount or compensation for the server's mistake, but she tried to charge me for the margarita! I've had waiters slip up elsewhere, and while I don't think it's necessary to offer a discount, it sure is appreciated, especially when I've spent nearly an hour eating my meal and covered in sticky, cold margarita, through no fault of my own. A manager eventually came over to speak with me about the bill, and he ended up comping our appetizer and my iced tea.

And why review a Hooters in Champaign when I live in Chicago?  Well once a very long time ago, when I attended the U of I, my roommate and I were eating lunch here on a weekday and in walks Harrison Ford.  Thats right, Han Solo/Indian Jones himself walks in, by himself and treats himself to the delicious Hooters cuisine.  There must of only been about 3 or 4 other patrons where, so it wasn't a big todo or anything.  That is totally random (there is a airport down the road, and Hooters was on of the first restaurants you see when you drive up from it towards town, so he was probably refueling or something).   So +1 star.\n\nSo that aside, as a fried chicken review, I give Hooter's Chicken 4 stars.  The very thing that makes it unique you either love or hate,  Hooter's batters its chicken wings.  Hooters also leaves the \"tips\" on its wings too.  You can ask for them naked, but as its kind of the specailty of their wings I prefer the batter.  The batter does soak up a lot of sauce and oil, so it is by no means healthy.  It does keep ok, but its better reheated if you let it go cold.  Hooters sauces are notoriously non-spicey (and I'm a big wuss when it comes to spice).  \"Hot\" is about medium, \"medium\" is less than what is considered mild at most places, it has no flavor at all besides a buttery oilyness for some color.  Please order at least \"hot\", don't be afraid, its not hot.  The fried buffalo shrimp are pretty good too (but they go too quick).  Grilled cheese was favorite too, but some of these options are not offered as many Hooters are franchised.", "business_id": "JhEA8qHfNmIh8c6OHXnaYA", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-04-08", "type": "review"}

If you can manage to maneuver your way through the sea of bodies in the hella hot and humid place and manage to secure a pool table, it can be alright with some friends and a beer.  They do have heating lamps and an outdoor area for if you need some fresh air from the stifling bar, but all in all, I would say Joe's is my least favorite bar on campus.", "business_id": "1T2rnvl67Gk9Uc0gzsCKQA", "stars": 2, "date": "2008-03-29", "type": "review"}

But with us, we aren't going so much for the food - as for the sports.  \n\nLiving in the downtown/South Mountain area, there aren't many sports bars as it is.  Then you narrow down which ones are showing the events you want, and we often end up here.  Especially for boxing!  One of the things I like about Hooters, and this one in particular, is that if you want to see - you have full view access.  But the TVs are high enough that if you could care less, you don't have to be staring at a television.  The problem is, it's Hooters.  If you aren't looking at the TV you have to be careful what it looks like you're looking at.  Is there such a thing as viewer's guilt?  Maybe there should be.  \n\nSounds bad, but totally honestly - I just feel really bad for the girls who have to walk outside on a chilly night.  The comments that they have to deal with can be really awful.  There should be some kind of a \"Bad comment\" jar, like the old-school \"Bad word\" jars when you cussed.

If you really have to read a yelp review on hooters, then you probably shouldnt be going there. \n\nThings to obviously know before entering hooters:  expect greasy food, slow service, chicks only mildly good looking thanks to butt lifts and makeup, annoying guys who think they are all going to be the next UFC champ, loud sports on 13 tvs, and some drunk guy getting into someones face in the corner causing a scene. The good things to expect is good food at decent prices that is fairly consistent regardless of location, good happy hour (depending on when you go), and great cold beer.  \n\nI give it 3 (this goes for the whole chain) cause i love their buffalo shrimp and buffalo 'chicks' sliders, and of course the wings.  However, I would give this location a 2 - it seems to attract a questionable clientele.  Last time we went on a Monday, sat outside on the patio watching the end of a basketball game, being only 1 of 4 tables in the place.  These guys were sitting behind us at different tables and started lightly arguing; ten minutes later it escalated to punches and beer being thrown literally over my head with the cooks and managers coming out with the cops on their way - subsequently slowing our already slow food by another 10 minutes.\n\nLastly, I will say this - DO NOT bring your kids here.

You should find a job that doesn't involve customer service.\n\nMy friend and I were super excited today for Wing Wednesday ($9.99 all you can eat wings). We walk in and are greeted instinctively but the female bartender who also tells us to sit wherever. I choose a table next to the double doors that leads to the outside seating area. For 10 minutes we sat there without even so much as eye contact or a smile from any of the waitresses. I see that there are two moderate groups outside (6-8 people each), but don't give it a second thought. Still no acknowledgment from anybody. After 15 minutes, my buddy walks up two managers who were fiddling with a tv monitor and 3 other waitresses surrounding them. My buddy goes, \"Umm, can we get some service??\" The female manager immediately appoints someone to go to our table. \n\nThis blondie informs us that **Brittany** is our waitress, but she would take our first order. A few minutes after she takes our order, the lovely Brittany shows up. We had already watched this girl walk right past our table about 10 times back and forth prior to talking to the managers. She apologizes, like a child whose been forced to do so, for \"not seeing\" us. A) Simple acknowledgment would have sufficed. B) My buddy is a BIG tall guy with a mohawk wearing a bright red shirt. How the heck could she not have seen us? She then makes a pathetic attempt to explain that she got slammed, and says that she will now take our order. I tell her that our orders have already been taken. We get our first round of wings in a fair amount of time after the order was put in by Blondie. I asked for ranch and never got it. My buddy's cajun wings were too salty so he only ended up eating 6 wings. Brittany came back and only asked to refill my friend's drink. He told her Mr. Pibb, and she brought back coke. She took his plate away and didn't bother to ask if he wanted more wings since it was all you can eat. He's a big guy!!! Oh that's right. She didn't take our order so of course she didn't know. Shortly after I finished my own round of wings. Typically, the girls will see that you have finished your wings halfway and immediately ask you if you want the next round put it. No one asked us this. So I finished my wings and asked my friend if he wanted to go or keep hoping that the service will improve. BTW, those big tables were long gone by then. It was actually pretty empty by then. The whole time we just watched Brittany try to calculate her tabs and collect her tips. \n\nMy friend wanted out, and he said he'll refuse to pay if they asked us. We head straight to the door and NO ONE bothered trying to stop us. Instead we heard Brittany,\"Sorry guys.\" as we left. They knew what was going on. This is the very worst service that I have ever had. I would have still tipped had we stayed til the end, but it was so terrible. My wings weren't even that great. \n\nIf you come here, and you get a girl that is tan, has shoulder length curly hair, and is named Brittany, ask for another waitress.", "business_id": "qsWxbgQwuomXvMseg23DGg", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-04-11", "type": "review"}

You just have to find a couple friends to go with you... because you do have to buy out an entire table, whether you use all the seats or not.  \n\nMy husband and I met our couple friends to check out the game versus the Cubs.  First thing the men noticed?  How much they appreciated the extra room.  The tables are like 1/2 pentagons, a table cut in half facing the field.  The men are both over 6 feet, and not having their knees jammed into the chair in front of them was worth it alone.  \n\nService was just ok.  They don't have to be awesome, they have a captive audience and they know your bill is going to be at least $130 and gratuity is added in on top of that.  \n\nFood was just ok, your average Friday's fare... if you like it anywhere else you'll like it here.  It's a bit pricer at the field I think, and watch out--the drink prices are considerable (that's because they don't list them!).\n\nSome other cons:  view, if you are really into the game these seats will frustrate you.  It's a good use of the backfield space that would have otherwise been cheap bleacher seats.  But you're looking at the game from a good distance, from the back side.  Also, Fridays is adjacent to the big screen, so you really can't even watch the game or replays on the big screen.  Also con: noise, you're right next to some huge speakers.  While the space would be good for kids, to be able to run around a little more than regular seats... for kids who are noise sensitive, BEWARE.  I was glad we decided to leave our little guy with the grandparents, I think those speakers would have made him pretty unhappy the whole game.\n\nBut, for experience alone it was worth it.  Extra room, ability to chat with friends while watching the game, having food and alcohol brought to you without waiting in line (oh, and bathrooms that are close too!).  I think we'll definitely be doing it again next season!", "business_id": "1-1VcGTL3GyCqUpXZLFTZA", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-05-23", "type": "review"}

The food prices are comparable to any other TGIF but the cocktails are pretty over priced.  $10 for a 16 oz plastic glass of something.

I get the fact that the servers are moving up and down stairs trying to get everyone their stuff.  It was quite a bit of time between refills and the food did not all come out at once.  Actually we had to remind whomever it was that brought out the food several times of things that were missing.  Our actually waitress did not bring us much of our requests.

I'd never heard of Whataburger before so I thought David Foster Wallace was making it up when he refers to the \"Whataburger Southwest Junior Invitational\" in Infinite Jest (the tennis tournament is made up). When I found out it was a real place, I had to come here. \n\nIt wasn't bad and kudos to the woman taking my order. She upsold me to a meal - \"are you sure you don't want a meal, honey?\" Her voice indicated that she was genuinely concerned about my general hunger situation which, admittedly, was extremely high at that very moment. Then there was the wait outside the take-out window, probably 10 - 15 minutes in total. I  figured they must be assembling one king-hell burger in there. But more likely, it took that much time to fill the giant Whataburger cup with Fanta Orange soda. I let out an audible gasp when I saw it - holy crap it was big. Like I could have gone hiking in the desert for miles with nothing but that giant cup of soda to sustain me. \n\nThe burger was pretty big. Bigger than anything you'll find at any other fast food joint and don't forget the wait, I think the wait is key. Because that wait is what sets this place apart from say, a Mickey D's or an In-n-Out (which, incidentally, Whataburger is way better. Like the first time I ate an In-n-Out burger that's exactly what it did). So sitting outside waiting behind the big white SUV with the smokey exhaust you're inhaling for the ten minutes it takes for them to make their burger, plus the ten or so minutes it takes for them to cook your own and  assemble your meal, fill the giant styrofoam Whataburger cup with Fanta Orange soda, and deep fry your peach pie (very tasty) lets you reflect on the state of your life in relationship to your expectation of wanting a fast food restaurant to act as an instant gratification machine, when, in fact, by going to those other places, you are perhaps missing out on all this personal attention to your burger, meal, soda, dessert assembly (and don't forget that caring moms-like voice so concerned for your hunger situation), in the space of which time you are allowed to reach out to loved ones via your cellphone or text-messaging system (I was able to call my husband twice and read a magazine article about hiking in Tempe), and think about what you want to do next w/r/t your art and just what the fuck are you doing with your life anyway that you think waiting outside the Whataburger for ten minutes is keeping you from actualizing some potential self that may be far better served by simply having to wait a moment for your food?", "business_id": "ixTr1qXUFGTzyaZUuCDDvg", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-04-20", "type": "review"}

Their breakfast items were good and at a reasonable price. But over the last 3 years, they have jacked their menu prices time, and time again. Now, it's getting to the point that they are pricing some people out of their restaurants. One example, 3 years ago, a simple biscuit and 4 oz gravy was $1.29-$1.39. As of this morning, that has increased to $2.04. That is a price increase of 70%. I know that costs have fluctuated up and down, but not by 70%. I feel that they are out of reality with their pricing. Too bad, because my office used to make food runs to the location @ 7th St / McDowell at least 2X a week. Not any more. My hopes is that they will reconsider some of their pricing policies. Would it not make more sense to make less profit per item, but possible increase the number of customers?

It's right on the corner of 10th Street & Roosevelt in a cute little red and white dining car.  There are a few parking spaces behind the diner on 10th Street.  I would check the hours, as I think I was told differently than the hours posted in the other review.\n\nMy friend and I went to the diner on a Saturday afternoon and were able to get seats inside at the tiny counter.  I'm sure as it gets warmer, those will be harder to come by and that when the weather is nice, most people sit outside.  It is indeed a tiny space on the inside and half the seats have a direct view into the kitchen area, which is kind of homey.  I'm pretty small, so the size inside wasn't an issue for me, but claustrophobes and bigger people might feel squished.\n\nI ordered a hamburger and fries and my friend got an egg sandwich.  The burger was pretty good, but relatively small in comparison to what's generally served at restaurants.  If you're really hungry or a big eater, you'll probably want to go for the double burger.  The fries were good - nice and crisp.  My friend was pretty happy with her egg sandwich but unhappy with her cup of water, which was apparently pretty bad even for tap water.  They have a bunch of organic sodas, along with Coke and Diet Coke, if you're like me and can't wash down a burger and fries with anything but a carbonated beverage.\n\nOverall, I thought it was a pretty cool place and will definitely return with more friends in tow.  (Possibly for one of their movie nights...movies + tasty food = a good time).

The burger easily beats out even cult-status places like Delux or In n Out, and their handcut fries are subtly crunchy and salty.  Their salsa burger topping absolutely rocks the block.

Get there... now. Payton is known for pushing limits and incorporating fresh, local ingredients. The menu will likely change every week, if not every night, so I'm not sure if my recap will help all that much, but here goes.\n\nThe neighborhood is sketchy, the place is tiny, and the accommodations are \"rustic\", so if you're all into the Scottsdale scene or flashing your dough, don't bother. That being said, Shantal mentioned that being there made her feel like she was camping every night, and I have to admit the evening had a vacation feel to it... National Lampoon's style!\n\nYou can instantly tell that Payton is having a blast and it shows on his face and in the food. We were seated on a collection of old dining chairs at a makeshift table of 2x8s and construction horses in the middle of the front yard, with a candle to light our way... I knew it was going to be a sweet evening!\n\nWe started with the burrata that was lightly seasoned with truffle oil and cracked pepper. Unfortunately a lot of people are adding burrata to their menus and they have no idea that this fresh, creamy, delicate version is how it's truly meant to be. It was served with slices of toast that I expected to be the brick-hard version to which I've become accustomed. Imagine my surprise as I bit into a spongy, buttery slice of bread with just a crunch of the crust! Delicious.\n\nThe porcini foie gras terrine will scare those faint of heart, but it's amazing and the pear butter adds this velvety, sweet flavor that just makes it unforgettable. I wasn't a fan of the pate', but it was a combination of pickle, horseradish, and mustard flavors with chunks in the loaf... all things I can personally only handle in moderation individually and generally dislike, so it was exactly as described. The mains arrived and the Sonoma lamb sugo proved to be an interesting choice. It's not something you would eat on a regular basis, but I'm so glad I got to try it. The shreds of lamb meat were piled on top of a bowl of hearty fettuccine with perfectly cooked chickpeas and dollops of cream that muted any gaminess of the meat. Then you would get a bite of golden raisin to kick in a touch of sweetness; pretty cool combination of flavors and textures without being over the top.\n\nPerhaps the biggest surprise of the night was the bowl of Bolognese that was planted in front of us, it blew me away and I have no idea why!! Payton, what's your secret with something so simple? Dessert followed with apple pie that could've been much tastier if it were warmed with a scoop of ice cream, but all was rescued with a huge chunk of bread pudding that puts my mother's recipe to shame (and it was served warmed with a scoop of ice cream :). \n\nAll in all, we had a wonderful night with fabulous food and fun friends and we didn't want the night to end. If you want a hint of adventure, get to Welcome Diner before the end of May... seriously...

Not so fast, Barilla Boy.  Payton Curry's gnocchi, I believe, are (dry?) pan-seared on both sides,   keeping all the doughy, gummy deliciousness often lost in the water.  The madeira wine and cream reduction here smothers the pillowy gnocchi and tooth-tender walnuts and squiggly good morel mushrooms in a way that makes you close your eyes, shut off your hearing, and attempt to pour all of your sensory energy into taste and smell.  When eating this dish, I more than once covered my face with my hand to shield what may have been unflattering facial pangs of ecstasy.  \n\nLEMON CURD\nWe struggled to choose this dessert over the Strawberry Olive Oil Cake and Strawberry Malt, but we got our strawberry fix as the second layer in this delectable parfait, topped with the airiest foamy meringue, and served in a mason jar.

The macerated strawberries made you want to relive childhood and replace mom's jelly with Payton's strawberries to accompany Laura Scudder in your PB&J sandwich.  We clanged spoons at the bottom of the jar for the last bit of bee pollen.\n\n$62 with tax and tip.  We didn't bring a BYOB wine but would next time.  (The $13 corkage fee seems high, but there ought to be an explanation for that.)  Everyone working in the tiny dinette and serving the tables outside had huge smiles and loads of enthusiasm for what they were contributing to the Garfield neighborhood and to the downtown culinary scene.  Others are taking notice, too. Michelle Laudig (former restaurant critic at Phoenix New Times) and Aaron Chamberlin of St. Francis both dropped in during our dinner.\n\nI worry about the AZ heat baking the charm out of patio dining in May, \nJune, and July for Chef Curry, but I hope to return in April...maybe on a Tuesday at 10pm for half-price eats.\n\nOther reviews of Payton Curry's chef-in-residence at Welcome Diner: http://www.yelp.com/biz/payton-curry-at-welcome-diner-phoenix", "business_id": "tb24fvNJfHhyKEXkKn12Xw", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-04-20", "type": "review"}

I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place.  I've been to Welcome Diner three times in the past two weeks.  I've sampled the lemon ricotta pancakes, the Holy Puerco special and a breakfast biscuit sandwich.  All were delicious, but the Holy Puerco was amazing.  A cheesy grit cake smothered in the most delicious pork I've ever eaten, topped with an egg and house-made pork cracklings, served with flavorful, crunchy potatoes...\n\nI love to sit at the counter.  The crowd is friendly and the WD team is personable and efficient.  There is also plenty of seating outside, as there are only 9 stools at the diner counter.  And since it's in my neighborhood, I can easily walk or bike there.\n\nFood is locally sourced when possible.  I was there yesterday when the guy dropped off the duck eggs.  Most entrees are in the 8-10 dollar range.  They have beer, wine, and limited cocktails.  I highly recommend the Hurricane, with fresh-squeezed juices, light and dark rums, and pomegranate grenadine.  And the new management DOES take credit/debit cards with the square.  You can have your receipt sent to your email or phone number.  I mention this because I saw a couple order who'd never paid with the square before.\n\nWelcome Diner is open for brunch and dinner, but not every day.  I know they close at 3 on Sundays.

I always looked for it when I passed it on my way down Roosevelt but always seemed to miss it.  I practically smacked myself in the forehead when we arrived today.  I felt stupid, but then again, there are some places I just can't see until I plan to stop there.\n\nIt took some convincing to get my husband to give a place other than his favourite Joe's Diner a chance for a delicious (post hangover) brunch/breakfast a chance.  We got there a little early due to it being their last brunch weekend before summer and I am paranoid of crowds and hipsters.\n\nWe arrived and found ourselves seats under an umbrella in the shade.  We got some water from the cooler and perused the menu and specials.  After some deliberating (sunrise sandwich or holy puerco?) and discussion (welcome breakfast has no meat -- I need my protein at breakfast), he went with the special boudin breakfast and I got the holy puerco.  We both had fresh squeezed ojs and beignets.\n\nIt was worth it.  Dear goodness I have not tasted pork jowl cruncy bits like those ever (and their meat is provided by meat shop and shreiners!).  The combination of flavors on the puerco thing was just delicious.  And the hashbrowns were fresh and not too crispy and not overpowering and flavorful.  I kind of wanted some sour cream to go with the flavors and make them like a crunchy baked potato.\n\nThe beignets are not as fluffy as the ones I remember in New Orleans but definitely will satisfy this girls desire for fried dough.  They are yummy and powdered and you must be careful or the sugar will make you cough.  The honey is also oh so good.\n\nThe husband very much enjoyed his boudin special and it was gone very quickly.  He said it was all very tasty and he was glad we braved the heat for the opportunity to try the breakfast before it is gone.\n\nWe also got a hurricane to share at the very end.  It tastes like juice, or sunshine in a cup.  But it does pack a punch.  I felt that drink (the few sips I had) by the time we got back home.

My food was delicious and the staff seemed genuinely friendly and interested in how I thought that the food was, which is always the sign of a good chef.  I did have to wait a little bit, but I didn't mind too much, since it's a small establishment.  People should be forewarned that there is very limited seating indoors and that most of the seating is outdoors on the patio.  I personally thought that it was nice to sit outside, especially with the mural on painted on the fence/wall, but I understand that it might not be so comfortable to sit outside at the picnic tables in extremely hot Phoenix weather, especially if it was a busy day and you had to share a bench/table with a bunch of people you don't know.\n\nI got a fried green tomato sandwich on sourdough with house-made corn salsa and arugula.  It was fantastically delicious.  The ingredients were fresh and everything from the toasting of the bread to the battering of the tomatoes was well-executed.  Although the sandwich was filling and came with a slice of cantaloupe, I wish that it had come with some sort of side, like home-made potato chips, for the price.

Now it's so much more than that.\n\nHave you ever watched someone hand you a glass of local red wine blend through a trailer window? How about a Sazerac? Well, it's time to change that. (Here I am assuming you said no. If you said yes, please un-see this section and continue.) When you start your meal with a southern throwback cocktail and finish it with homemade beignets, you best believe that whatever comes in between is going to knock your socks off. This is fine because you're probably sitting outside, so the dress code is pretty nonexistent, anyway.\n\nMy crew ordered the three most talked-about items on the menu. The peanut butter burger is the safe option + a bit of \"flare\" that is essentially peanut sauce. The meat is delicious, as is the bun and everything else between it. We also had the Carol, which was a unique BBQ pulled pork & biscuit sandwich with slaw... a mustard-y spin on a stack of down-home delicious. Last but DON'T YOU EVER THINK LEAST, the Bumblebee fried chicken & biscuit sandwich with honey and amazing b&b pickles. Us Southerners opted to scoot the mustard to the side and let the honey shine, but you could probably do anything to this fried chicken and it would still be incr-edible. Just get it. Get a bucket of it.\n\nNow let's talk beignets. (Don't you wish people said that to you more often? You're welcome.) You can get them with powdered sugar & honey or peanut butter & jam. The waitress literally said the pb&j beignets were her favorite thing in the world, and then quickly added her daughter as a frontrunner to the favorites list. Not knowing her taste in dessert, or daughters for that matter, I trusted her immediately and was thrilled with the combination of light, lemony fried dough juxtaposed with fresh berries and creamy peanut butter. Ain't nothing wrong with the classic, but damn it, it's 2014. The matrimony between pb&j and beignet shouldn't even be questioned.\n\nTL;DR - The Welcome Diner isn't just tasty, it's soulful and lovely.

It's so perfect that I wish I thought of it myself. \n\nYou order at a little window and can see three guys all crammed inside, cooking up amazing food. They had happy hour specials while I was there, and I got a local draft beer that was delicious. After much debate, I settled on the North Carolina pulled pork biscuit and a special side salad with a shallot vinaigrette (although it was hard not to order skinny fries and Brussels too!). I was worried it would be packed, but there were just enough people to comfortably eavesdrop and still have some elbow-room. \n\nThe food was amazing. You can tell everything is made in small batches, with love and attention to detail. Someone came out and checked on me while I was eating, offered to grab me another drink, and whisked away my dishes as soon as I was finished. Overall, it was a perfect dining experience, and I only wish I could pick this place up and plant it down on the East Coast!", "business_id": "tb24fvNJfHhyKEXkKn12Xw", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-03-11", "type": "review"}

I'm not a religious man. Easter is just another day of the week for me, however I am a man who can appreciate a day off work. That said, I am grateful that you were open so that I and my degenerate crew could enjoy your establishment. \n\nThing 2: Thank you for having delicious food. That is all.\n\nThis was our first time trying Welcome Diner. We pretty much almost tried one of everything... because why not. \n\nThe Fried Green Tomato Sandwich and the Biscuits and Gravy were my top two items. As I've declared unabashedly in the past, I'm from the south and these two items brought me back home. Very well done in their own unique way. \n\nI think the thing that was most surprising about WD is that they were churning out this great food from such an unassuming place. It looks like they just dropped a little ol' diner right in a residential neighborhood. The location is also just east of Roosevelt Row, in a slightly more rough area. Not bad, but some people might shy away. \n\nThe only issue I see, particularly with summer coming up is that, if I'm not mistaken (which I could be), majority of the seating is outside. There are sun shades, but from our experience, even with said shades, if you're sitting in the wrong spot, you could still get pretty toasty from the sun. \n\nWe sat outside on our visit because it was beautiful. Although as the morning moved along it did get uncomfortable at times when the sun would be at just the right angle to blast you for just long enough you could feel the sunburn happening. \n\nAll that said, get there while the weather is good!

Not just for the food but the environment too! Sometimes I admit that I don't always feel cool here cause so many people there are but for some reason I still always feel like I fit in. The staff there is awesome and makes you feel like a family! The customers are so cool you will end up starting random conversations with people sitting next to you. It's pretty easy on the inside since it's only a 9-seat bar but many more options outside. \nIt's so good that we decided to go there on a rainy night thinking it wouldn't be busy since most of the seating it outside - WRONG! The place was packed!!\nMy favorite thing about it is that it provides downtown Phoenix with an amazing option at 1:00am!! Even 1:45am!! \nHappy Hour is awesome! It changes so check it out! It used to be all day Sundays but think that stopped, now I think it's only like 5-7 or something and maybe Tuesday all night? not sure, I'd look into it though! I order the Pountine Fries all the time!! Crispy french fried covered in gravy and cheese, sure I pass out afterward but it always is worth it! Drinks good and strong too!! Great beers on tap, usually a local option or two as well!\nI tell everybody about this place because this is def a local business you want to support and keep in the neighborhood as long as possible!!\nThey also just opened up an awesome chicken & Donut place on like baseline at 16th st.\nDo yourself a favor and go!! But not on Mondays cause they are closed and not until 5:00pm, when they open :) \n*Bike parking available and free car street parking too!!", "business_id": "tb24fvNJfHhyKEXkKn12Xw", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-05-16", "type": "review"}

It's a laid back, casual, hole in the wall, neighborhood gem.  LOVE that there is this historic looking little diner in the middle of what appears to be a residential area.  Reminds me of the historic district back home.   I picked my husband up from the airport at 11pm and thought, \"Hey...why not?! Let's try it!\".  I'm SO glad we did.  \n\nIt was PACKED.  I asked if they were always that busy and he said \"Yep.  Often busier.  We use fresh ingredients and make good food.  It makes a big difference.\"   I felt like a newbie ordering, asking for a receipt, etc. (because they were so busy), but they were as patient as they could be.\n\nMy husband and I both ordered biscuits and gravy to go.  He ordered his with two over-medium fried eggs and I ordered mine with a side of brussel sprouts.   While we were waiting, he had a soda and I had the Ginger Beer.  The Ginger Beer was knock your socks off spicy, but I'm sure it's what saved me from a night full of tummy troubles (eating rich biscuits and gravy right before bed is probably not a good idea).  It was definitely homemade and packed a TON of ginger punch. It will make your throat burn in a good way.\n\nThe food was outstanding.  The biscuits were sliced in half, toasted, and accompanied by the super thick, rich sausage gravy.  For us, the gravy had a bit too much heat (excessive black pepper, perhaps cayenne...not sure), but...it was still VERY tasty and we both ate every bit. His eggs were perfect and my sprouts were fantastic with just the right amount of caramelization and oil/butter. \n\nWe will definitely be back and often.  :)", "business_id": "tb24fvNJfHhyKEXkKn12Xw", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-05-24", "type": "review"}

The sourdough bread they were served on was a treat in itself. We finished up with the beignets with local honey and powdered sugar which were also insanely delicious. A little different than what I've had in New Orleans, but c'mon, deep fried dough and sugar. You can't go wrong. The honey gave it kind of an Arizona twist.

I have to say, this is the worst Cocos location I've ever been at. The food made us feel sick, the service was horrible and the waiters and waitresses were rude. Our original plan was to go to National Pancake Day at IHOP. After seeing the line at IHOP we deiced to find somewhere else. I saw the cocos on the way home and we decided to stop there. \n\nWhen we first got there, over 6 of their tables were dirty wish dishes piled high. The waitress came out and said there was a party of 30 and it would take an hour for our food to be out. She cleaned off a table and sat us. We accepted and started looking at the menus. \n\nA random waiter came out, brought us our drinks and told us that they were no longer making pancakes, which is the reason we went there in the first place. We all decided to change our orders when our waitress came out and offered us the pancakes. We assume the cooks did not want to be bothered making more pancake batter and asked the waiter to tell us they were out. \n\nSome time had passed and we were all out of water with no service. I asked another random waiter for water and our free bread basket that every cocos normally provides. He gave me a dirty look and went into the back. 25 mins later our waitress comes back and finally asks if we need anything. I asked for the bread basket and she rolled her eyes and explained that they didn't have any bread and started walking away. I had to raise my voice to ask again for at least the water refills. \n\nWhen we got our food, it tasted fine, at first, but it made all of our stomachs hurt after a few mins.\n\nIt was the worst service I've ever received at a Cocos! I didn't even tip and I am always a generous tipper. \n\nAlso, this terrible service was from the night shift staff.", "business_id": "SZvYxcvYYVRue9MXcEDjsA", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-03-04", "type": "review"}

As a Scentsy rep, my friend was like....\"It's just like Scentsy, so many to choose from!\" I decided on a blackberry shake as I use to get them as a girl back home in Washington. It was YUMMY!  We both ordered the Pastrami Reuben for lunch on sourdough rather than rye and had the potato salad as a side. The potato salad was divine. Great flavor, consistency, and appeal. The sandwich was good too. Nothing super fabulous but a good standard Reuben.\n\nWe chatted, admired the stuff all over the walls, and strolled around the store afterwards looking at stuff. \n\nI throughly enjoyed my trip to MacAlpine's and will be going back with my daughter to try the dill pickle shake as she's obsessed with pickles!", "business_id": "R6aazv8FB-6BeanY3ag8kw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-05-12", "type": "review"}

Being that I have never seen a Sonic, I was perplexed by these commercials.  So, using the power of the internets I discovered that there weren't any Sonics in the state of Maryland.\n\nWhen I moved to my new home of San Diego, I was confronted by the Sonic commercials yet again.  I internet-searched again and found the nearest Sonic was about 2 hours away.  My perplexion flexed into downright dismay.  Commercials are expensive endeavors--so why would a company essentially throw their money away by advertising whereever they are not located?\n\nOne night, my friend Jen picked me up at the Phoenix Airport for a nice hangout weekend.  We were both really hungry and deciding where to nosh.  When out of the corner of my right eye i spy a garish forty-one hundred kelvin fluorescent beacon in the night.  I thought it was some sort of carwash or super-sized gasstation at first glance.  Jen explained that was a Sonic.  \"What the fvck's a Sonic?\" I replied.  To this point I have never seen a Soinic before in the flesh or in the disgusting eyesore of a prefab materials and light, as it were.  So it was decided right then and there that we would eat this Sonic.\n\nNow, I know I cannot speak for all the distant Sonics in parts of the world a young hooligan such as myself has never been to, but to this, my virgin Sonicage, I can.\n\nThere is a huge slab of concrete which seemed way too large for the size of the building.  On this slab was lots of parking spots under a handfull of overhangs shining enough fluorescent light to make a operating room mildly jealous. Beside each of the parking spots was a lit-up menu with fast-food type stuffs, drinks, slushies, smoothies, ice cream sundaes, banana splits, etc.  As if this wasn't enough, they also have a drive-thru.  Again my perplexion returned.\n\nThe awful shine of it all, the harshness on weary eyes... It is a monument to decadence to the point of bloatation and bloatiosity.\n\nWhile we were deciding what we wanted a Mexican family rolled up beside us with a roller-skated jalopy and young children in the back.  They ordered and pulled away blasting some thuggish gangsta rap as their trunk buzzed with whorish flapping sheetmetal not sealed or sealed or sealed.\n\nJen ordered blackberry iced tea and some fried mac n' cheese bites, I, the tater-tots with cheese and a cranberry limeade. We pulled away blasting while our thuggish gangsta rap as our trunk rattled and flapped whoreishly--waves dissipating into the must of chaparral, waves lifting into the witheringchaped desert night.\n\nGot home and ate in normal lighting--Lighting that didn't make one's flesh crawl rutty-riddled with hungover insomniacian interrogation prior to a privilege afforded to be actually hungover.\n\nThe drinks were surprisingly not overly sweet and made with lots of that pellet style-ice that we so heart in drinks like these.  The iced tea was quality and the crisp tartness of my cranberry limeade (with actual half of a real lime floating in it) was perfectly refreshing.  The mac n' cheese thingees tasted like a crispy fried stouffers mac n' cheese.  Sadly, these are a limited time only option. As for my tater-tots with cheese, eh, not so good.  They were just bland cafeteria-style tots with a slice of American cheese thrown ontop--A wrinkly transparent orangish shellac coalescing my tots into a gelatinous choir.\n\n...and that was and is how I met a Sonic.", "business_id": "po5FyERB4lUZNnBIwnhFlg", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-05-03", "type": "review"}

Rickie and I had spent and exhausting day (and a quick $200) at Target and were thinking steaks. The budget didn't include Morton's or Ruth's Chris. I had brain freeze and forgot the local spots I love so much that grill a mean meat (i.e. Phoenix City Grill), so the first restaurant past Target that fit the bill was our local Applebee's on Camelback and Central. Mind you, I don't expect a decor marvel or a hostess so hip it hurts. I know what i'm getting myself into. For the most part. But I had recently seen a TV commercial from Applebee's and of course the food was airbrushed so perfectly like Celine Dion's face on the current issue of HELLO magazine. I mean, really, Celine, you have no wrinkles even after living in Las Vegas these past couple of years? Anyhoo, we were greeted and seeted promptly by a teenager who definitley just had a smoke and could use a visit to the tanning booth. Once seated, our server, Mo, took our drink and appetizer order and quickly disappeared. For quite awhile. Cue the Jeoporady theme music. Once our iced teas and the new appetizer (tuscan cheese bread extravangza) arrived we sipped and dipped. Not bad.Raspberry tea with an univited yet delighted visit by vanilla and the cheese spread was rich and yummy served with a spot of diced tomato, basi and garlic...aka bruscetta. NICE. We ordered onion chips, like an onion loaf or the blooming onion at Outback....they were good. Two sauces for our dipping pleasure...one your typical ranch, the other a sort of spiced up thousand island with horseradish. Then the entrees arrived. Cue the creepy dum, dum, dum, music...Both NY strip steaks over cooked to such an extreme. The asparagus was limp like, well, let's just say it reminded me of a Vietmanese gymnast I once dated who didn't take the little blue pill. Sides included mashed potatoes (loaded) which means bacon, cheese and sour cream. Ok, Ok, Ok, too much of the extras. What ladle in the kitchen did they pick to put these extras on my mashed potatoes? All in all, I had low expectations at this venue, and they were met. Shout out to Mo the server, a good gal! The clientele was like a scene out of Dawn of the Dead. Sorry. Lesson learned...Applebee's ok some of the time. Get an app and a drink. Skip the entrees. Be nice to a nice server. And for God's sake don't expect a steak worthy of the big chain peeps.", "business_id": "cjUmPLRT43wN9Z87A9BOpg", "stars": 1, "date": "2007-05-30", "type": "review"}

It does get crowded around dinner time and there isn't really a clear system of lines for those who are picking up and those who are ordering.

Nothing is grosser to me than biting into a chicken wing and getting a big mouthful of greasy, fatty flabby chicken skin.  YUCK.   Long Wong's wings are deep fried and come out meaty and chewy and little bit crispy.  Delicious!  Kinda like the perfectly browned skin on the Thanksgiving turkey, but covered in delicious hot wing sauce.  Someone once complained that they were similar to chicken jerky and I think that was a compliment!  The way they are cooked you can appreciate the meat and crispy skin and the sauce and you don't have to muck through a heavy breading or flabby, fatty chicken skin.  \n\nTheir $5 cheese pizza isn't bad either.  And for some odd reason their fountain Pepsi is somehow more yummy than most fountain dispensed Pepsi at other restaurants.

My parents were divorced, so my dad pretty much always took me out to dinner on his nights. Long Wong's was a solid part of the rotation, and not just because I only ate cheeseburgers. The place is crazy looking. Literally, the decor looks like it was inspired by an acid trip. Nothing says \"kid friendly\" like a hippopotamus trash can.

We had a craving for wings (I accidentally typed that I had a crazing for wings, which I'm pretty sure is the exact same thing)  and you can get a bucket of 50 for, like, $25. Going to be honest ... 50 wings might have been a bit overkill for two people. Still, it was worth it. \n\nWe did a split order: 1/2 honey hot and 1/2 medium. The honey hot wings are where it's at. My only complaint is that I like them to be a little crispier. Some of them were slightly soggy. The fries didn't travel well either. In fact, everything was just kind of soggy by the time we got home. The wings were still very good, but I think they will be even better once I give the leftovers a little crisp in the oven. I will say, their homemade ranch was delicious. Can't beat a hot wing dipped into good, homemade ranch. \n\nI'm definitely going to have to keep this place in mind the next time a wing craving hits ... and maybe ask for them extra crispy.", "business_id": "BT2Vls7h6sWrCKa5gGXbKg", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-03-11", "type": "review"}

They have many other items on their menu however,  I have never had anything, but their wings. So I can not give my opinions on the other items. \n\nThe service I received from the staff here is hit or miss. This is still a fast food joint, so this tends to be expected.

So your quality of service is random. \n\nWith all that said, I do find that the person's who are behind decorating this place must be some kind of Hoarders.

While inside looks like a horder ran out of space at home to keep his, or her junk and just started storing it atbthis Long Wongs. \n\nIt is primarily because of this reason,  why I can't give five stars to a place with the best wings.

The waitress was there as I was sitting down. \nInterestingly, Mark had gotten a big ol' glass of red wine to start lunch...a delightful way of lunching for business people that has fallen into disrepute over the past decade or so. I followed suit.\nWe must fight this non-drinking at lunch scourge by taking every opportunity to imbibe at lunch, and I, for one, will help lead the fight!\nThe menu hasn't changed very much over the past few years, but really, why screw around with what is working...the place is always full, everybody seems to enjoy their meals, including me BTW:), and they just go on printing money, year after year! What's not to like about that formula?\nThey had some nice specials (including a bunch of seafood specials), but frankly, I rarely eat seafood at non-seafood specialty restaurants in the middle of the desert. I opted for the Cuban Hamburger. \nA novel preparation, one that was highlighted by some of the tastiest pickles I have ever had on a burger!

I think a restaurant experience should match its rating caliber and sadly it did not. No four stars for fabulousness, it's three stars because it's ok and that's not shabby at all.\n\nWent to dinner with the other half of our awesome pair... my besty Sara V. on a whim. We've been thinking alike lately... and while I was at work... I kept on thinking that it would be nice to go out to dinner... and unsurprisingly Sara V. was thinking the same too... I swear it's like we have ESPN or something! Anywho, I had her come up with the dinner choices since she knows I'm a really picky person (I say I'm not but I really am =P), she texted me the top 3... and I chose PCG since I had read Jana S. earlier review on the place and I've always wanted to try out this place!\n\nAnywho, we got to the restaurant and I really like the intersection it's at, at Bethany Home Rd. and 16th St. coz it's across from Luci's Market and Richardson's, and an awesome looking Starbucks. In a strange way that intersection has a little character plus it's in an older section of upper central Phoenix. I like the setup with the tables outside and the large picture windows. \n\nWe were seated immediately at a two seater booth, noticed it was quite busy, and i liked the general ambiance of the place. We were thinking of the happy hour when we were heading there but were dismayed to read on their large easel board that hh tues. - fri. was from 3p to 6p but on Monday's it's from 3p to close. So we made a mental note that we'll come back for hh on Monday. We were seated and waited for our server, waters were dropped off, and our server passed with a passing remark \"I'll be right back\". Well she did come back after 10 mins. which I ordered a glass of reisling, and an order of the Roasted Green Chile Fundido Queso (ever since our trip in Austin for SXSW last year, we've been looking for a place that serves Queso as to satisfy our Queso fix from TX of which we have yet to find a place, maybe it's a Texas thing). My glass with a small carafe of wine was served... wet. The wine glass was wet! Like it had been just washed and they didn't take the time to dry the glass, no they served the glass WET and our server poured some of the reisling into the WET wine glass. Ok... there went a star. who serves wine in a wet glass?!? apparently PCG does. So, we're waiting to order, mind you, our server did not stop to give suggestions, mention the soup of the day, no we waited, and we had to ask for suggestions, and ask what the soup of the day was. Heck if you're a good restaurant, wouldn't you want to welcome your customers, who if you win them with good service and good food will come back, or are you happily satisfied with the customers and your fans that you're not interested in winning a few more? Ok... deep breath. \n\nI ordered the PCG pasta as suggested by our server, and Sara V. ordered the Smoked Baby Back Ribs (rubbed in Chipotle bbq sauce). Oh did I mention that I had to ask for Sara V.'s water refill the first time round and flag her down to get a diet coke. Sara and I could see the poor girl was handling way too many tables to guarantee good service but that's no excuse. I think there's an expectation that a restaurant of such acclaim should provide great service. \n\nThe PCG pasta was quite good, liked the roasted garlic and chardonnay cream sauce, it wasn't overly creamy, loved the sun dried tomatoes though, it was delicious. Sara V.'s baby back ribs had a kick with them, it was spicy! and the green chile cornbread was okay not bandera's skillet corn bread good though. Oh, the queso was alright as well except i wish it was a little more thicker, this queso seemed too runny but it was a good starter nevertheless. We finished our meal with a slice of the buttermilk pie which had a caramel sauce and pomegranate seeds as garnish, which was the right accompaniment to something rich and sweet. \n\nOverall the food was very good but the service had me wishing it was better and it did affect my overall dining experience. I will come back for the happy hour but I will have to pass on a glass of wine... unless they can guarantee it'll be served in a dry wine glass. And maybe some attentive service. So hopefully next time I'll get my four stars, we'll see.", "business_id": "Pfb6VOIiroqDWOebfgWGPQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-03-18", "type": "review"}

Their brunch menu is quite a few steps above and for the prices, a great culinary investment. I had the griddled corn cakes (mmmm....) and you get a choice of meat. So I had diced smoked ham hidden in between them. It came with black beans and cheese, potatoes and maple syrup. Mom had short rib with a poached, breaded egg on top and a tangy red onion relish. The egg was a gem and the breading wasn't incredibly greasy. To top it off, they were giving moms a carnation flower. Nice touch. As for dinner, I highly recommend the pot roast.

My parents just moved back to Scottsdale after living in Houston for 2 years, and on our way home we realized we were starving, so my mom remembered the PCG and suggested we try it again after at least 5 years not having been there. It's a little off the beaten path (although easily accessible from the 51), but I have to say that it was one of the best meals we'd had out in AGES!!!! I live downtown Chicago, where the culinary/dining scene is truly one of the best in the US, and the quality and presentation of the food here really impressed me. Just a fantastic place.\n\nMy mom and I decided to try a bunch of appetizers, and my dad had the pork tenderloin.  We had the fish tacos, the bacon-wrapped shrimp, the griddled corn cakes, and the crab cakes.  I cannot tell you how fantastic each and every one of these appetizers was!!! The fish tacos were the best we'd EVER had--and we're a major fish taco-eating family! Fresh grilled fish with a chipotle-lime aioli and pickled red onions--just fantastic. The bacon-wrapped shrimp were HUGE! I don't know where they get these shrimp, but they're incredible, and stuffed with cotija cheese. Yes, a little rich, but absolutely delicious.  The griddled corn cakes--incredible! They totally balance that sweet-salty thing that everyone loves, and the corn cakes were soft, fluffy, and surprisingly very light.  Then the crabcakes. We're originally from Maryland so we're VERY picky about our crabcakes--and we were shocked to discover they actually did them correctly!! Fresh, lump crabmeat (not shredded!) and very little filling, served with an incredible lemon aioli sauce and a little salad. Just amazing!\n\nMy dad had the pork tenderloin, and he's a bit of a picky eater and left not a single scrap on his plate! I love how the waiter asked him how he wanted it prepared (yes, you can have pork tenderloin done medium), and it was served with jalapeno preserves, these incredible mashed potatoes, and roasted root vegetables. My dad cleaned his entire plate and loved every bite.  \n\nOn top of it all (yes, we were stuffed!), we decided to split a dessert--the bread pudding, which was absolutely DELICIOUS. Not overly sweet or rich, and nicely presented. Excellent coffee, too.\n\nI was so pleasantly surprised by how great the Phoenix City Grille was that I just HAD to put a review on Yelp (and this is my first!).  Our server was excellent, and I don't have a bad thing to say about this place.  I wish it were in Chicago! We'll be back as soon as possible.  5 stars.", "business_id": "Pfb6VOIiroqDWOebfgWGPQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-05-29", "type": "review"}

Love the atmosphere.\n\nOne of my all-time favorite meals was at the PCG, well over a year ago, and I can't get it out of my head.  It was spicy grilled white fish served on andouille and potato hash over grilled sweet corn puree.  The fish was perfectly cooked - steaming hot on the outside and just set up inside, very moist.  The sweet corn and spicy sausage were awesome together, the meal was just incredible.  My friends were envious - I shared a few small bites :)\n\nMy red meat friends praise the steaks and lamb, I love their seafood entrees and the sauteed veggies.  Hearty portion sizes but not over the top.  Still haven't figured out the magic in those mashed potatoes!

A month ago, I took out-of-town guests for Sunday brunch. Part of the reason I chose City Grille was because they had a promotion where you could get a free appetizer for checking in on a Smart phone. All you had to do was show your server. Well, my server, no matter how nicely I approached the matter, kept insisting that deal was only for people who brought a print-out of an email--even after I showed her on my phone what their own restaurant's Facebook page stated! She just shrugged and said \"Well nobody explained it to me.\" I don't fault her if nobody told her. But I do fault her for not even bothering to say anything like, \"I don't know anything about that but let me go check with a manager\" after I showed proof. It wasn't even the appetizer but the principle of the matter.\n\nI left a comment on the restaurant's Facebook page--very diplomatic, not with any self-entitled overtones. Their social media person asked me to email him directly outlining what happened. Less than two days later, he wrote me, with the owner copied in, apologizing and offering to send me a gift certificate for dinner for two! \n\nThis update is not to say \"Woohoo! I got a free meal.\" It's just an appreciation for when a restaurant is willing to own up to a mistake and try to make up for it. It also sounds like because of me, they will remember to make sure all servers are aware of promotions like that. And when I did go back for my free meal, that same server was there, lol.

I got there 30 minutes early and decided to have a happy hour drink at the bar. Well.... their definition of well drink is a little different than most places, for example, they do not offer a well margarita.....pretty odd. The bartender was terse and I did not care for him. Anyway, as my family arrived we decided to sit down. We had made a reservation through open table and they accommodated our party of 12, so that is a positive. The food was good, not amazing, but solid. My family is big into sharing so I got to try the beef tenderloin (good and came with a tasty chipotle potato), the chicken special (chicken with green chile and really good goat cheese polenta), the pork tenderloin (this was maybe the best thing, it had a really flavorful sauce and horseradish mashed potatoes), and the ribs (flavorful, but a little drier than I prefer). We also split Caesar salads which were tasty, they had very well seasoned croutons. The service was good considering our large party size and it was an enjoyable place to have a large party.\n\n I kind of think of it in terms of a wedding....a lot of wedding food isn't amazing but it works because it works for big groups....I think this place is like that.

We arrived around 8:30pm and the place seemed pretty busy with an older crowd. I think we were probably the youngest people in there.

And OMG were they good! There were only 3 and we definitely fought over the last one and savored every bite!\n\nI'm not usually a girl who orders ribs but these were definitely good. The sauce was unique, a little smokey but not too much but they had really good flavor. The coleslaw was really good, reminded me of KFC with a small punch of ginger and the twice baked potato put a smile on my face. Totally not on the diet but I didn't care. My bf was really happy with his pork tenderloin and the small piece I had was really good. He continued to comment throughout the meal how good it was so I know he liked it a lot.\n\nTo further ruin my diet, we ordered the warm chocolate torte.

The fried pickles are huge and the batter is wonderful. I'll eat 3 of them (they come in orders of 6) and start feeling full. The Fingers and Fries are also great, the chicken is some of the most tender I've ever had. You can very gently pull it apart with your fingers. Absolute bliss. I think they use corn flakes or something in the batter; it's very flavorful and thick.

Decor could use some help, and the TV's were a bit small to be a sports bar. Food was affordable, and portions were large.\n\nDrinks were as expected, nothing good or bad about it. I had Kiltlifter, my friends had sodas and iced teas.\n\nWe ordered some buffalo and honey bbq wings, as well as some calamari. First, the wings were huge, which was good because we only got about 8 for the 1lb order. But they were very well done, and the flavor was not added on post cooking, as most average establishments do. No, the flavor was baked in. \n\nThe calamari was not rubbery, but had a good snap, which means it was well cooked and of good quality. The breading wasn't overboard, and had a nice crunch to it. Very well done.\n\nFor the entrees, we had the Beef Stroganoff, the Buffalo Chicken sandwich, and I ordered the Mac and Cheese with the Buffalo chicken upgrade.\n\nFirst, my Mac and Cheese. It definitely wasn't box mac. It had a few cheeses that were  blended and mixed in with penne, and the dollar upgrade of buffalo chicken was a heapful of chicken on top. It came together very well, and tasted great. Well worth it, and the extra for Buffalo chicken. Portion size was also good.\n\nThe Beef Stroganoff was well done according to my friend, and it looked huge. Comfort foods should always be generous portions and have a nice home cooked feel to it in order to be successful. They were.\n\nAnd the Buffalo Chicken sandwich? My friend said it was the biggest one he'd ever gotten. It looked it. And he enjoyed it. So there's that. It didn't look too extravagant, but then it shouldn't be. It just looked big and tasty.\n\nSo why four stars? First, the decor was fairly outdated. It looked kind of like a neighborhood bar, but facing Camelback, and being so close to the Biltmore, I really thought they could use an upgrade. The TV's were at best 30's and the audio was low. A sports bar usually has at least a few 50's and pump out the sound for the major games. \n\nBut, all this could be why their prices are affordable (just go to Biltmore instead, and overpay for the ambiance), and their food is certainly good enough to keep people coming back. In fact, writing this review, I believe I shall go there again tonight.", "business_id": "CqhsIZ7TzCfJTrZqg5-gqQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-05-08", "type": "review"}

Based on other people's reviews, I was expecting a dingy, dark dive bar. This is just not the case! I think many people simply have never been to a real dive before. The area surrounding the bar was dimly lit, but that's a good thing! It looked pretty awesome in there actually, and the pool tables were in a separate area in the back. We sat in the other separate area with booths which was brighter and gave it a quieter, more restaurant feel (even the bar area was NOT that loud).\n\nI have to agree with everyone's love of the fried pickles. Went with the original kind. I think they dip them in panko after the batter, super crunchy and delicious. I forced my roommate to try one bite with ranch dressing (he HATES pickles), but he actually couldn't seem to stop taking more bites. Pretty funny! I ordered the salmon in parchment special for $9.99. While it was good, it was not great. It tasted like the salmon I buy (and cook myself) from Costco. A little chewy on the teeth, but hey, it's 9.99! It came with green beans, broccoli and carrots which were really well prepared with garlic. I can't remember the last time I enjoyed cooked veggies so much. There was wild rice pilaf as well. Tasted like the kind I used to buy in small boxes at the store. That's not a complaint, it's good. My roommate ordered the grilled cheese and tomato soup which he liked very much.\n\nI think we were supposed to get the pickles at half price since we ordered at 6:45, but were charged full price. It didn't matter this time since we were using a Groupon and were a little short using the whole thing anyway, just something to note. Service was a little slow at times, but not enough to make us upset, we weren't in a hurry. Besides, everyone there was VERY friendly, even the servers that we only saw in passing smiled and said hello. That's pretty rare, especially in Phoenix (I'm a native, I can say it)!\n\nOverall, I would definitely come back. I like the atmosphere, people, food and prices.

Fast, attentive, very good interaction with multiple (and difficult) personalities, and knowledgeable of the product.  \n\nAs far as the food goes, the person I was with swears by their spicy chicken wings.  I'm a big boy and I enjoy having more than a little bite into a wing only to encounter bone on the next nibble, so ... pass for me.  I had the veggie burger, which I would best describe as falafel on a bun.  If you like falafel, you'll like this.  The salad dressing (blue) was weak and the salad itself nothing special.  Likewise, the iced tea was watery.  \n\nI was also surprised how warm it was in the restaurant.  Plenty of fans going, but it felt really stuffy  (ironically, when we left later, it felt cooler outside on the wrap-around patio with misters than it did inside.  \n\nMy friend took me here so we could talk about some private issues he was having.  Why he chose this place -- outside of the fact he's a wing fanatic -- is beyond me.  It is a sports bar and this was evident even at 3pm, when you would think most people would be at work.  To say the noise level was a bit loud is like saying Liberace was slightly flaming.  There were no games on, that I could see, but by the shouts and testosterone-fueled \"yeahs\" you heard every 2 minutes, you would think the Superbowl was moved to a Thursday.\n\nSo, in conclusion, while fans of this place will no doubt have many unflattering comments to throw at me -- most regarding my obvious lack of masculinity -- I can only say that this would be the place to go if you're seriously into sports bars or just can't live without their wings.\n\nAs for me, I'll take my obviously nelly self to a real place where I can enjoy my food and conversation in peace.", "business_id": "CqhsIZ7TzCfJTrZqg5-gqQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-05-08", "type": "review"}

Both plates came out within 10 minutes, which always makes me a little nervous. His was sub par; he ate about 35% of it. The veggie burger was near the quality that I've come to expect from most restaurant vegetarian options. The bread was decent, and the patty was an unaltered Boca burger.

The bartender handed me a happy hour menu and a regular and convinced me on getting one of her \"signature\" margaritas. \nWell I looked over the regular and the happy hour menu. Some items were only like 30 cents below the regular price and another item (Edamame) was $3.98 on the regular menu and $4 on the happy hour menu.

The rim ooozing with a strange red concoction. It was weird,  I asked what it was the bartender said it was chile and claimed that it was the key to making the margarita so great. [Hummm...ok?!]  I was brave enough to sample, which turned out to be some strange chile lime slime instead of salt. Ok?! Just weird I used the lime at the rim of my glass to wipe off this ooze when the bartender wasn't looking...she seemed so proud of this mess she was calling signature. Not one to waste liquor I finished it. \nThe shrimp cocktail arrived and looked promising 6 good sized shrimp, garnished nicely. The cocktail sauce was spicy with lots of horseradish, which I enjoyed. The avocado was a nice compliment not too much. The Shrimp....over cooked, tough....but I ate 'em. The crackers, provided while still individually wrapped still had a taste like they came out of my grandma's purse.

Mom didn't relish the thought of having to dine outside at RR's, so M&S it had to be.\n\nReservation was for two at 8p, and knowing we'd be slightly tardy (we arrived at 8:05p), I'd called before we left and was told that there wouldn't be any problems keeping the reservation.  It took about 10 minutes to be seated, which wasn't so bad, considering that the hosts seemed disorganized and slightly frantic, and there were about 10 or more people waiting in a scattered formation before us (it was VERY cold outside, and no one wanted to feel the breeze everytime someone opened the doors!).  However, it took another 15 mins. before our server greeted us, which also meant we had to wait that long before getting a sip of water!\n\nFood was, on the whole, delicious (w/ a few exceptions), but it was the timing that ruined the experience for us.  After being served water, we both ordered the Turkey dinner, each w/ a choice of side (Mom chose the sweet potato crumble, and I the macaroni and cheese), plus a side salad and dessert (cheesecake or upside-down apple pie- we both chose the pie).  Mom also wanted the calamari app.  How I wished I'd listened to our server when he recommended the crumble over the mac 'n cheese after I'd asked him which was better :(  The SPC was heaven (!), while the mac needed more cooking time.  Even the replacement wasn't any good.  The sliced oven-roasted turkey dinner was terrific, which included mashed potatoes, stuffing, fresh cranberry sauce, crispy green beans, and sliced carrots.  We were served cheesecake, instead of apple pie, and when we nicely pointed out the mistake, we were told that the apple pie would take a little longer as it was still baking, and the cheesecake was taken away.  Mom didn't care for the pie; I, on the other hand, really liked the homemade filling!\n\nRun-down of the timing of food delivery:\n\n8:25p- Water and server greeting.\n8:35p- Salad and app. delivered.\n9:25p- Turkey dinner entrees arrived.\n10:10p- Cheesecake slices placed on table and taken away shortly after.\n10:40p- Upside-down apple pie slices presented.\n10:55p- Credit receipt delivered and signed.\n\nAs I mentioned above, food was solid (w/ exception to the mac 'n cheese and cheesecake mis-step), but service was extremely lacking.\nEven the women's restroom needed dire attention... Perhaps M&S' 4th year of T-day dinner will be more successful (I think this was the 3rd year since they first offered it), but I won't be back to find out.

The dishes here won't blow you away and the prices are a bit inflated for what you get, but when the weather is nice this is a charming little gathering spot for groups both big and small.  A great view of the Biltmore golf course and a casual relaxed atmosphere have been drawing my parents here for weekend brunches for years.  Another part of the draw for many is the fact that many don't even know this place exists, or that its accessible to the general public.  Ergo, its almost never crowded.  As was the case today.\n\nFor those who've never heard of this place, a quick tutorial.  Enter the Biltmore at 24th Street and Missouri.  Take the main road (stay on the right side of the road the whole way) all the way till the road ends at the Biltmore Golf Course parking lot.  Walk towards the clubhouse and you'll find a large outdoor patio area.  Head to the doors that open to patio and that's where the hostess is located.  There's attendants in the parking lot in case you get lost and you don't have to be golfing that day to dine there.\n\nToday I came with my Dad as this is always his weekend brunch standby.  There's seating for probably about 100 altogether, so we've never had to wait for a table.  Today the patio was pretty packed with golfers so we dined inside.  Their brunch menu is pretty much all traditional American faire.  Burgers, sandwiches, omelets, the usual suspects.  One dish that my folks and I have here that stands out is their California Eggs Benedict.  Turkey, poached eggs, avocado, arugula, and hollandaise on an english muffin.  It's not cheap at $15, though the portion is big enough that you don't really need a side.  Today it was just as good as I remembered and I left pretty satisfied.\n\nI will echo some (though not all) of the comments regarding the service here.  The staff here has always been super friendly to us, though I will agree it can be a little slower than it should be.  Today was actually pretty adequate, though we have oftentimes had long waits for our meals and/or long waits for the bill.  The other thing that I will say is unfortunate about this place is the patio is basically unusable during the summer months.  If they would put misters and/or a larger shade structure outside over the patio area you might be compelled to chance an outdoor dining experience during the summer.  But so far, no dice.\n\nSo if you're playing a round at the Biltmore or just in the neighborhood, the Adobe is a fairly decent spot for traditional American faire in a relaxed environment.  No lines, no pretentiousness, no riffraff.  The ambiance is quite pristine given the big city hustle and bustle that surrounds the area.  Its not a goto for me the way it is for my folks, but hey, to each their own.", "business_id": "rJ7HH85lo0wTNr5BiYGQ4Q", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-03-22", "type": "review"}

My favorite appetizers are the avocado egg rolls and the sliders.  Grilled shrimp club, BBQ chicken pizza, blackened chicken sandwich,  chicken chipotle pasta, chicken romano, and chicken madeira are all REALLY good.

And every time he visited the table next to us, he stood between their table and ours, with his behind right in our faces. He was incredibly slow in delivering drinks (we only ordered iced tea) and only came by to refill once. \n\nI ordered the Evelyn's Favorite pasta which was surprisingly one of the few vegetarian items on the menu (aside from salads). My only request was to take off the Kalamata olives. Of course, when the food was delivered, it was chock-full of olives. So not only did the pasta lack flavor to start with, but the small amount of flavor that I was able to detect was ruined by the olives. I'm not a complainer, and I hate sending food back, so I picked as many out as I could, but it wasn't really worth salvaging. I mostly just pushed the pasta around my plate, took a few bites, and pushed it aside, which is disappointing since it's a $13 bowl of pasta. \n\nWhen the bill finally arrived, it added up to just under $50 for two iced teas, one bowl of pasta and one cobb salad. I'm sorry, but that price is just absolutely exorbitant for the poor service and lack luster food. This visit was most definitely my last visit to the Cheesecake Factory.

It was either between this place and Red Devil and I wish we just would have went to Red Devil instead. They do not take reservations but we were pleasantly surprised to find that the wait was non-existent on this night and we were seated right away.\n\nThe waiter took our drink orders and my sister was the only one that didn't want lemon in her drink and he was kinda rude about that, something about making his job more difficult or something but whatever. The menu is huge and they have a Skinnylicious menu that features light menu items if you are watching your weight. \n\nPretty much anything that you could want is on the menu; italian, asian, american, etc. and let's not forget that cheesecake! The cheesecake is the one item where you cannot go wrong. OMG Red Velvet layer cheesecake is 7.95 a slice as they are all aptly priced but it is a huge slice enough for two people.  The mango passion tea is great as were their mixed drinks which are $9.25++\n\nI got the veggie burger which was okay, nothing groundbreaking in flavor or toppings, sauces etc. The fries were a bit disappointing and the food presentation was pretty disappointing and lackluster. My mom got a turkey burger that was incredibly greasy and she was not happy with it. She asked the waiter if he was sure if it was a turkey burger and he assured her it was but again, did not get her something else or offer to take it off of the bill. So somewhat disappointing considering this is Mother's Day and I wanted my mom to at least enjoy her meal.\n\nSummary: Food so-so-may change on a variable basis, Service-abyssmal, we never even got our water glasses refilled, another waitress stepped on my sister's foot but refused to move in a timely manner. I'm going to have to pass on this one unless I need cheesecake in the near future.

When she returned, she had forgotten to bring a tea for one of our party. Moments later, holding a tray with a cleaning rag on it, she dropped the tray just beside me and splashed both myself, and my friend sitting next to me. I absorbed most of the splatter, in my mouth, left eye, and face. She fortunately was only splashed on her body and hand. Georgina didn't even say anything to us, but picked up the tray and kept going. After a few moments of waiting, I got up and went to the restroom to clean myself off, since I didn't even have a place setting or napkin at the table. On the way back, I stopped and asked to speak with a manager. A young man with curly hair, and square framed glasses was brought to me and didn't give me his name. I told him our situation, and what had happened. I told him I could not only smell, but also taste the cleaning solution that had been on the rag and tray. At first I asked if it was bleach based, and he assured me it wasn't. Then he said he'd talk to our server, and left things at that by turning around to talk to the hostesses. Clearly, I was dismissed. So I returned to the table, disgusted, upset, and smelling of cleaning solution. My appetite was ruined at this point, so I choose not to order anything. Having chemicals splashed into your mouth, even a few droplets, will do that to a person. At this point, our friend STILL hadn't received his iced tea. We flagged down a passing server and asked her if she could bring it for him. She went back, and came out with the wrong tea. Now in this, I say it wasn't really her fault. She wasn't our server, and didn't know what type he had asked for. Correcting that issue was minor. Next up, comes our long wait for our orders to be brought out. Georgina hasn't been back to our table for at least 15 minutes at this point. Another young man stopped and dropped one basket of bread and a small dish with 4 butter pats, to serve a group of 7. Another long wait, and the table next to us, who were seated after us, and ordered after us, gets their meals. At this point, my left eye was feeling irritated, and I went to flush it out in the men's room with water as best I could. When I returned to the table, our orders were just coming out. And my roommates order was wrong. He had ordered the garlic noodles with shrimp, and NO asparagus. And he got asparagus mixed into all his noodles. At this point, he notified the food runner who had brought his dish that it was wrong. The young man said sorry, and then walked away without offering to replace or fix the order. he decided to just pick out the asparagus, and deal with it since he was hungry, and didn't feel like waiting another 30 minutes. At this point, Georgina has appeared at our table 4 times total. While refilling glassing, she is reaching directly in front of my roommates mothers face, my face, and our friend seated on the other side of the booth. No excuse me, no words at all, and STILL no apology from her for the splashing. While my friends ate, I again went to the restroom to flush my eye. I again stopped to speak with the manager from earlier, and asked him for the name of the chemical used for cleaning. He immediately told me that \"I already told you sir that we do not use bleach products here.\" He furthermore told me that he had spoken to our server, and she said she didn't have any cleaning solution or rags with her when she dropped her tray. Outright calling me a liar as I see things. Please take into account, from the beginning I told the manager I didn't want anything, and wasn't asking for free meals, or drinks, or desert etc. I simply wanted the name of the chemicals used, so that I could give that information to a doctor if I felt the need to seek out treatment. He informed me that they didn't use chemicals for cleaning, and then said they used a sanitation solution. I'm sorry, but that would be a chemical. I pointed that out, and told him I was very upset with how this had all been handled. I made it clear again, that I wasn't looking for anything from him, except the name of the chemical. He asked if there was anything he could do to make my evening better, covering my meal or anything. I once more told him that I had chosen NOT to eat, after getting splashed and having that rancid taste of chemicals in my mouth. He then said he would get me the name of the solution used, after my having exhausted every other avenue, and telling him I would be contacting the corporate office. At this point, I told him I was done with the conversation, and wanted nothing more to do with him, as he clearly didn't care about the situation. The rest of our evening was spent with little service from Georgina. She had come and taken a desert order from our group while I was speaking with the manager, without even asking if I had wanted anything. Granted, I didn't. She didn't speak a word to me the entire time after the first complaint, and treated", "business_id": "2r8jGeuYvMkyP2ik_X-Bxw", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-05-03", "type": "review"}

They also raised the prices. So in essence, the new owners are producing a cr@p product and charging us more money! To add insult to injury they shorted us 2 chicken wings. Talk about trifflin'!! If they're shorting people wings, I'd hate to know what they're doing to their drinks. When we got them they were cold all the way down to the bones and stale like they had been made as a mistake earlier in the day, boxed up and given to us (short 2 wings!!!).

I'm sure MY taco has more flavor than this one did. Most of the wings and tacos are still in the fridge and will inevitably meet their fate at the bottom of the garbage can. In conclusion, if you want over priced, piece of cr@p wings that don't taste half as good as frozen ones and tacos that taste better when they come out of you than going in, go to JTs so they can pi$$ on you face and tell you it's raining!\n*Additionally, don't believe the review underneath mines. I'm almost 100% positive it was done by someone who works for them or has some sort of affiliation with this place. It's written like an advertisement. The wings look NOTHING like they do in that picture. This review would be VASTLY different if they did. Our wings were all limp and flaccid when they showed up to film. Nice try you guys.

Crazy that in my 3 years in Phoenix, today was my first visit to Wally's, but it won't be my last!\n\nI met 2 friends for lunch.  When we made our plans, they both suggested Wally's because of their convenient location and their 'caramelized vidalia onion & Guinness soup.'  I'm not a fan of french onion soup, but I really wanted to try Wally's anyways, so that's what we did!  I was acknowledged upon walking in by Chip, the General Manager... he was extremely friendly and suggested we sit outside since It was a beautiful day.  He was right - sitting on the patio was perfect!\n\nService was attentive and cold drinks were brought out right away... we started with the hot artichoke and spinach dip for the table... yum!  Good thing I worked out this morning, because I didn't feel quite as guilty enjoying this delicious appetizer - it was really tasty, and a generous portion too!\n\nOf course, my friends Rachel and Lesley ordered the soup as planned - they both seemed to enjoy it.  I went with the Cobb salad.  It was your standard Cobb - with chicken, romaine and iceberg, diced tomato, egg, bleu cheese crumbles, avocado slices, chopped bacon, and balsamic dressing which I requested on the side.  It was good, but I think I was full from the chips and artichoke/spinach dip appetizer, so I couldn't finish it all.  Too full for dessert as well...\n\nI'll have to return to Wally's for sure though - they had a pretty impressive bar menu with a ton of liquor, beer, and martinis too!  I noticed they had a kids menu, and some of my favorite desserts as well (hot apple pie and carrot cake).  \n\nWally's happy hour is from 4-6p M-F with $1 off cocktails & beer and $2 off all appetizers... I'll be back for more of that artichoke and spinach dip with a beer or 2 next time for sure!

While I thought it was strange that the waiter - who I am tending to believe had some weird social skills - took the order of the ladies first and then the men.  He was gracious enough to ask us if we wanted our bill split by couple.  But when he was taking our order, I knew that he also may have had ADD issues. It took forever for us to order (The waiter said he thought we were still looking because some of us had the menu open...)  My friend next to me ordered the scallops and a side of gnocchi. He asked her if she wanted to start of with a soup or salad.  When he took my order, I said the Halibut.  Did he ask me for a starter?  Nope...he said \"Wonderful...make I take your order?\" (To my friend's husband)  \n\nI wish that I did order a bowl of the lobster bisque.  I was able to try that and it was amazing.  Our entrees were delicious as well.  My friend's short rib (I also go to try) was cooked to perfection.  I heard great things about the lobster and the chicken.  My friends did tell me that the rice was a little undercooked and the gnocchi was a little heavy.\n\nNow I wish I could tell you that my dinner was amazing.  I was enjoying the halibut with shrimp, asparagus and purple mashed potatoes.  I finished the shrimp and still had most of my halibut and mashed potatoes when I set my fork down to look at my phone.  (My fault I guess...)  Because the next thing I noticed, a server took my plate away.  There was no \"Are you finished?\" or \"Would you like to take this to go?\"  Nothing...just took my plate away.  I noticed that he stacked my plate, so there was no way to retrieve my food.  My friends were finished with their dishes....so when I said \"I am sorry, but you took my plate away and I wasn't done\", the waiter said that he was sorry and was about to go back to retrieve it.  I told him that I didn't want it now, so he did offer to have the chef make me a new one. (NO!) or if he could refill my drink.  (I was driving, so NO!) I would have thought that I would have gotten a complimentary dessert but I didn't.  I was being treated for this dinner, but still,  the dinner wasn't even comped or had a percentage taken off. \n\nI would love to try this place again since the food and view were great.  I would just hope that my service next time would be better.", "business_id": "3Zsjlum5kl5N5KV712aTMQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-03-29", "type": "review"}

It was anything but. First of all, the drive up there, in a manual, almost gave my boyfriend a heart attack!! The random useless signs that \"try\" to direct you to your destination are more in the way than they are helpful! \n\nAfter we FINALLY get to the top, we are greeted by a couple of very nice, and well dressed young men who politely direct you to the restaurant. This place is absolutely gorgeous. I recommend that everyone eat here at least once. Once we got up, past the lounge area, to the receptionist we of course received a bit of attitude. (happens all the time)\n\nMy boyfriend and I like to eat out a lot, since we haven't the time to cook for ourselves, and since we both are only 19 and look quite young, we tend to run into people who assume that we are the \"typical\" teenagers. You know, rowdy, cheap and obnoxious. Either that or spoiled because of how expensive this place is. \n\nAnyways, after the receptionist barely acknowledged our presence, we were sat in a booth, far from the huge glass windows. I really wish we were closer, but a booth for a romantic dinner is probably the best way to go. Once we got seated, we were addressed by an older man, who definitely did not seem happy with his new table. His introduction was short and sweet. Since the menu was pre fixed, he suggested that we order one of each option so that we may try everything. I can at least thank him for that. \n\nThe biggest issue that I had, really didn't have anything to do with the restaurant. There was a couple sitting next to us in another booth, practically having sex! \n\nBack to the topic, the service after we ordered was very disappointing. We had waaay too many people waiting on us. We had the main server, and 3 food runners/bussers. So we were constantly interrupted. \n\nThe food was delicious though, and the presentation was phenomenal. Definitely have to make a reservation here.  Our bill came out to be about 230, and then a 60 dollar tip, so 290 total.

For a restaurant in this price range I'd give it negative 3 stars. Waiter was extremely inattentive. We ended up getting more (& better) service from a different waiter. Not really sure what our waiter was doing all night since we dined late and the restaurant was nearly empty. Our original waiter waited 30 to 45 minutes after we ordered to let us know that the kitchen was out of some items we ordered. This is 100% inexcusable for a restaurant in this price range.\n\nFood flavor ranged from bland to unimpressively odd. The preparation of individual items and dish combinations were overreaching, unappetizing and spectacularly disappointing.\n\nDesserts where completely underwhelming and generic in options and taste.\n\nTo add insult to injury, we were seated right next to a drunk party of 6 (the restaurant was nearly empty) who spent the entire night obnoxiously yelling over each other, constantly using vulgar language.  It was extremely difficult to hear the person directly across the table from me speak. Again, for a restaurant in this price range, this is 100% unacceptable.\n\nI'd be hard pressed to return to this restaurant even if it had TGIFriday's prices.\n\nConsidering the prices, I prefer to give this place negative 2 stars. I'll have to settle for 1.\n\nIf you want to enjoy the view, simply stop by for drinks.\n\nIf you want a great meal and service, save your money for someplace like BLT or Rancho Pinot.", "business_id": "3Zsjlum5kl5N5KV712aTMQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-03-07", "type": "review"}

It was fabulous. My wife got the Pork Tenderloin, I got the Ribeye. \nNot sure what varietal to pick, we asked for the sommelier, who again to our surprise, recommended a few reasonably priced Syrahs.

The reviews we've read definitely made this place seem like a winner.  I made a reservation for 6:30, just shortly after the restaurant opens.  The drive up the mountain was steep but the resort is beautiful and you could just tell that the view at the top would be amazing.  Were we ever surprised!\n\nThe valet parked my car and we went inside to be seated.  Unfortunately the patio wasn't open for service but they sat us by the window so we had a great view of downtown Phoenix.  One complaint we did have about our table was that it felt like we were in the path of all the server traffic.  It was also right next to a door to the patio so a couple of people tried to come in and out but the door was locked, so that was a little distracting.  \n\nOur server, Lenny I believe was his name, was very friendly and informative.  There were so many people that came to our table giving us water refills and bread and clearing our plates.  Lenny helped me pair a wine with my dinner.  My wife ordered the duck ravioli as an appetizer and I had the lobster bisque.  The lobster bisque was phenomenal, every bit as good as the previous yelpers have proclaimed.  And the duck raviolis were excellent as well.  The ravioli was cooked perfectly, just aldente enough so that it had a nice chew, the way I like my pasta cooked.\n\nFor dinner, my wife had the lobster and prosciutto wrapped prawns.  Both were so flavorful because they were braised in butter, which adds flavor every time.  I had the scallops over a bed of rainbow cauliflower and some sauce.  The sauce was a little too citrusy  for me and the scallops were almost better without it.  There were also a couple pieces of black garlic, which I forgot was in the dish.  So when I took a bite of one not knowing what it was, that sent my mouth into shock and I immediately had to wash it down with water.  Minus that, both dishes were very good.\n\nAfter dinner, we walked out onto the patio and down to the bar section to take some pictures with the city in the background.  The weather was amazing and we were so lucky to have the cityscape as our backdrop.

The other night my girlfriend and I went back for the first time since the amazing Yelp event earlier in the year. We started the night off with a drink at sunset on the outdoor patio, overlooking most of Phoenix. Then we headed inside for our dinner and the manager greeted us with a \"Thank you for coming back to Different Pointe of View,\" which I thought was a nice touch. I assume he knew we were returning since I mentioned we had a card for a free bottle of sparkling wine when I made the reservations weeks before. \n\nWe were seated inside near the window and our waiter was very friendly and attentive. Our bottle of Champagne was presented to us to start the night and we placed our food orders. We decided to split the Braised Duck Ravioli ($12) and the Pan Seared Diver Scallops ($15). There were two raviolis and two scallops per order and we felt both dishes great choices. The scallops were some of the best I have ever had. \n\nFor our main course we each ordered the Grilled Cedar River Filet Mignon ($38). The perfectly prepared tenderloin steak was accompanied with horseradish crust, Swiss chard, roasted fingerling potatoes, smoked apple wood bacon, chives, Cr\u00e8me Fraiche and port wine pomegranate reduction. No I didn't memorize all of that, of course I retyped it from the menu.\n\nFor dessert we split the Classic Tahitian Vanilla Bean Cr\u00e8me Brulee (all desserts $9). It was delicious, but rather small and didn't quite satisfy my sweet tooth. The buttercream blue cheese cookie and fresh strawberries were a nice addition, but even with those it was too small a dish. \n\nOverall, I 100% recommend you stop in and have dinner and drinks at Different Pointe of View. It has been one of my favorite Phoenix restaurants for many years. It's a perfect place for locals and out of town visitors alike. My only recommendations for improvements would be to add a server or two to the outside patio bar area since it tends to be slow on busy evenings. Also, I think the names for some of their dishes are a bit much and could be shortened.", "business_id": "3Zsjlum5kl5N5KV712aTMQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-05-03", "type": "review"}

The wine throughout was just as epic- unique red and white grape blends from California and Arizona to compliment the chef's theme for the evening...which the sommelier apparently learns of as the chef goes! The portions and pours were some of the most generous I've experienced with a chef's tasting, and we somehow found it in ourselves to top off the evening with cappuccinos and chocolates before taking in the stunning views. \n\nDid I mention the views? The giant windows open out onto a beautiful view of Phoenix and the surrounding peaks. And the patient staff are eager to usher guests to the balcony for individual photo shoots against the incredible backdrop.\n\nAnd speaking of the staff, everyone was absolutely lovely. From the exceedingly friendly hostess who brought us drinks when we showed up half an hour early, to the gentleman who smiled at us each time he filled our water glasses, the staff was top notch. Our server was a trip- so much fun and so enthusiastic about sharing the entire experience with us. He felt like a friend by the end of the evening...as did our sommelier, who was warm, laid back, and joked with us as he relayed the stories behind all the wines.\n\nI obviously can't praise this place enough.\n\nOh and P.S.- we're going back tonight for a wedding. Muahahahahaha. Round 2 suckaaaaz!", "business_id": "3Zsjlum5kl5N5KV712aTMQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-03-08", "type": "review"}

Super nice. Beautiful view. \n\nWe get there and there are about 3 weddings going on. Enter the lobby and they tell us we can wait for our table in lobby. We see some people with drinks but don't see a bar. So I ask hostess if there is a bar. \"Not tonight because there is a wedding just go wait in lobby \" That's kinda strange we think to ourselves, but  then it gets even weirder. As we are sitting in lobby as older couple sits down next to us and a server came and welcomed them and brought them each a glass of wine. We were completely ignored. \n\nWe were lead to our table (which was not a window view as Adam requested). We notice some waitstaff taking a rug and putting it over something right next to us. At that point we realize that they are using the rug to cover up vomit. \n\nAfter a few minutes we notice there were a lot of high school kids having dinner before prom. One of the tables of them right next to us was so drunk the girl threw up! I immediately get up to tell the hostess I want to be moved and notice a vomit trail all the way to the bathroom. \n\nWe were relocated to a table in the very back of restaurant. Service was slow and inattentive. The guy knew I was gluten free because I had a few questions. Dinner was good. \n\nAfter dinner. Waiter brought by dessert menus. We wanted to order something but he never came back. 10 minutes later he came back over and asked us what we wanted. I replied \"we would have ordered something 5 minutes ago but now we will just take our check. \". \n\nThey knew it was my birthday because Adam had written it on opentable. The guy came back with a birthday dessert and slammed it on the table with zero comments. No candles. Nothing. And it was the most gluten containing dessert option they has. Let me say that the people across from us got candles and a different dessert that I could have eaten. \n\nTook 20 more minutes after this for us to finally get our check. \n\nHorrible experience for such a special occasion.", "business_id": "3Zsjlum5kl5N5KV712aTMQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-04-13", "type": "review"}

The grilled endive and pancetta were fabulous atop mandolined fennel and apple in a very light vinaigrette.

It was perfectly cooked (ordered medium, came medium/medium rare) and seasoned. The beef was well-marbled and tender. Its buttery and char-grilled flavor was beautifully complemented by the smoky tomato basil emulsion that accompanied it. As well, the cauliflower and sherry risotto was rich and layered.     My daughter had the seared free-range roasted chicken. I was invited to taste a bite; it was moist, delicious, and very well seasoned.

Well, I finally went here last night with my sexy-pants boyfriend. His pants are sexy.\n\nSo, it takes a few minutes to get to the actual restaurant. You drive higher and higher and higher and then directly into outer space. Finally, when you arrive to the top, complimentary valet is waiting for you. Which I zipped right past because I refuse to valet my expensive 2011 standard Golf. I probably should've valeted though, because then I was forced to walk up a slanted hill in 6\" heels and had to cling to sexy-pants boyfriend like an old lady with brittle bones. Once inside, you then go up yet another flight of stairs (don't worry, there's an elevator) where you are finally greeted by the hostess. The restaurant itself is interesting - large, glass windows so you can enjoy the view, said Captain Obvious. Aside from that, it's rather plain and even on the drab side. I'm not saying that's a negative. It could be purposeful to not retract from the view? I dunno. The view is seriously spectacular though! I love the desert and this only amplified my love for it. I know there's a lot of haters in Phoenix who talk shit about how ugly this city is. You shut your damn mouth. If you're one of these haters, I encourage you to visit places like this that give you a profound appreciation of how neat mountains and clear skies really are.\n\nOnto the food: Pretty good! Expensive, as one would expect, but not outrageous. I ordered a \"micro greens\" salad with pistachios, pears, and some type of cheese I'd never heard of it. The salad was truly micro and was almost deconstructed, which I'm not a fan of. I'm lazy and don't want to put my food together. It came out on an overly-HUGE plate and I nearly guffawed at it! Hahaha! It looked really silly and even tinier. Overall though it was pretty good. I also had a side of fingerling potatoes and those were GREAT! S.P. Boyfriend had the chef's special, which was shrimp with kidney beans (I think, can't remember). It was very tasty. We followed all of that up with the peanut butter and chocolate cheesecake - definitely the highlight of the evening. The entire bill came to $76 - not bad! Afterward we went outside to check out the rest of the restaurant and made the treacherous trek back down to my baller car, where my boyfriend literally piggybacked me so I didn't have to break my ankles.\n\nOverall, pretty cool place!

Then off to our shared appertizer - Hamachi Crudo, aka yellowtail sashimi. Well, I had to mark off a star by paying $14 for a plate of fish that's almost equivalent to one piece of sashimi in a normal sushi restaurant, maybe I should compliment great knife work to the chef? And no, you did not use blood orange as described on the menu, the color is too light to say 'blood'. \n\nPan Seared Barramundi - pleasant presentation and tasty fish, but the bed of olives and toasted farro with feta cheese, hmmm, very sour and too salty for me, and maybe too many drizzels of olive oil? Also, it seems like they really like this garlic crisp, saw it twice on three different dishes! And decent 3.5 stars to the short ribs!

We took the waiter's suggestion and took his favorite chiffon cake (no offense to our waiter), but this cake had the strangest taste, the middle part is a saffron flavored ice cream? I had to admit I just tasted Indian or persian on my cake, not to mention that the edge of the cake looked like it was bitten off by a mouse, why so uneven? all three of us had a bite and all had the same reaction - please take it away...\n\nOverall, the high expectations of good food due to such beautiful view did not work for us, and be careful with the dessert!", "business_id": "3Zsjlum5kl5N5KV712aTMQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-05-19", "type": "review"}

Oh was it a thank you.\nWe started out with drinks on the patio while we waited for our table reservation to start.  The view across Phoenix was exceptional.  The drinks where nothing special, as we started with some beers, and my wife a Santa Margherita Pino Grigio. The ambiance outside was fantastic as we had a reservation for 7 that allowed us to enjoy the Famous Arizona sunsets.  Once our table was ready, we continued to enjoy outside for a bit longer.  It was fantastic to just sit, relax, and commiserate with our friends with out feeling rushed into our seating.\nAfter going in, we were at at a table next to the window, the only issue with the seating was that their was a small but powerful light shining down into my eyes at table position 2, but our server Ian was more that happy to fix it by turning the ambient lighting down in the entire restaurant so it wasn't grating on my vision.\nThe dinner was started with drinks, Crown Royal Cask no16 for me, beer for My friend and his wife, and my wife was still working.on her 500ml bottle of Santa Margherita.\nWe ordered a full 5 course meal.  \nMy wife and I split the Seared Berkshire Pork Belly as my appetizer, the other couple had the Sweet Italian Sausage and Fresh Mozzarella Raviolis.  The arrived hot, and Fresh.  The flavor was incredible, and the presentation a master-piece.\nI then had the Belgium Endive with Blood Oranges.  I will say that this was in fact one of the best salads I have ever had.  I ended up sharing a leaf with each of my friends and wife just so they could taste it.\nWe took a short break from dinner, talked, order more drinks (beers for all of us except my wife who had a Stella Red), and then shortly after dinner was presented.  I say it was a presentation, as again, the attention to detail and visual aesthetics that went into the plate presentation where astounding.\nI had the Rosemary Sented Grilled Venison Tenderloin.  This was cooked to a perfect medium-rare, sliced into medallions, then placed on what could be described as sweet potato hash browns.  The Port Demi Glace was just perfect.  The presentation was beautiful, but the flavor was incredible!\nBoth woman ordered the grilled New York Strip Steak.  My wife had her prepared Black & Blue.  For those of you who don't know, this is difficult to do as it is blacked, but not charred on the outside, & only slightly warm on the inside.   Blackened not charred  means the meat is crispy, but no large hunks of carbon hanging on the outside of the steak.  It is absolutely fantastic when done correctly, and can be a pit fall and ruin the steak when done poorly.  This was the epitome of a Black & Blue steak.  Perfection.  My friend's wife had hers medium-well, and while not my cup of tea, it was still very moist and tender, but deep read in the center.  \nMy friend had the Brandy Vanilla Poached Maine Lobster.  It was also just fantastic.  The lobster was silken in texture, not a single rubbery or chewy bit.  \nFor dessert the women split the Chocolate and Sweet Basalmic Cherry Cake.  It was gone almost as soon as it hit the table top.\nI had the Warm Cinnamon Bread Pudding.  It was good, but the sauce was really what made it.  Wasn't fond of the partially spun sugar that it was topped with, but only becuase it was the ONLY part of the meal (the garnish on the desert that is) that felt not 100% authentic, but kind of short cut.  (It was done on a mat instead of the traditional hanging style that I would have preffered). \nBut seriously, that how nitt-picky you have to be to find something wrong with our meal. You have to decide that a completely subjective choice by the pastry chef wasn't the best call.  Seriously though, it was very good.  The coffee after the meal was good.  Strong, some what acidic, but not bitter.  My wife drank it black while I needed just a touch of cream.\n\nOver all, the quality and presentation of the food at Different Point of View, as well as the exceptional service provided by Ian made it THE most memorable date, let alone double date I have ever been on.\nWe will be back.", "business_id": "3Zsjlum5kl5N5KV712aTMQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-04-15", "type": "review"}

We figure Gallagher's would be a safe bet and it was centrally located to all of us.  Two of us get there first and walk into a practically empty bar.  I mean, I know we didn't want out of control, but it would have been nice to have SOME kind of background noise going on.  The annoying thing about all this was that even though it was dead the service was S..........L.......O.........W.............  When my friend and I walked up to the bar the bartender didn't acknowledge us and took about 5 minutes to pour a couple beers for the 3 people sitting around.  Once he finally did make his way over to us he wasn't friendly and took his time pouring our two beers as well.\n\nOnce we finally had drink in hand we made our way to the patio outside to try to escape the elderly gentleman who had started serenading me and also enjoy some of the springtime air.  Unfortunately it appears that if you sit outside you do not get to enjoy the privilege of a server so we had to venture back inside whenever we needed something.  Luckily for the sake of our evening we had a good time hanging out with each other but no thanks to this place at all.  It would have been practically the same experience if we had gone to a grocery store, purchased some beer there, and then sat in front of the store.  So you better believe that if that's the kind of scenario I'm looking for, I'm gonna save myself the money and do exactly that rather than paying bar markup prices.", "business_id": "PkBkqQpAoeX3Ogo5HBthQg", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-05-10", "type": "review"}

I usually like these types of places because of where I grew up but wasn't really feeling the food. \n\nWe went there around 6ish on Friday night... The happy hour specials were good! Half off apps. and 2 dollar bottles or drafts. The atmosphere is quite like a saloon and as said before a bit run down. There were definitely alot of what appeared to be \"locals\" when we were there. \n\nIt is definitely true what is said about the prices but maybe we ordered the wrong thing cause we definitely got what we paid for. I ordered the super wagon burger and my wife ordered the 1/2 rack of ribs. My burger was darn big I must say and was cooked nicely. The problem is that it didn't have any flavor. It appeared to be handmade but didn't have any seasoning and didn't have the best taste. I saw on the menu they were offering dishes that were \"Char Grilled\" but am surprised they didn't cook the burger on the grill. I think that would have been the difference along with a little bit of seasoning salt and some pepper. The same goes for the Ribs... They tasted like they were cooked in the oven only because they were tender but had very bland seasoning and were smothered in sauce. I would like to think I can throwdown with some ribs and one thing I know is that they need to be finished on the grill! Not only for taste but for texture. \n\nI'm not going to say this place was terrible but they completely missed the mark on the two things we ordered. I really liked the homemade potato salad though. \n\nI/we will probably back during happy but not for a full on dinner. Don't have high expectations for this place.

They call themselves a saloon, and from the outside, that's exactly what it looked like.  They also have a sign out front that says no firearms allowed, but they have some weird iron sculptures of guns on the walls inside.  Strange.\n\nAnyway, we were hungry after work, as usual, so we were looking around for something new and interesting.  After giving up on searching for something closer to our current location, we gave in and decided to give this place a shot.  After all, who can resist cheap food?  I had to stifle laughter when we walked in.  I don't know what it is, but this place gave me the giggles!  We stood at the hostess table for a few minutes before we were acknowledged and then a table was cleared for us.  Our drinks were brought out quickly and then we ordered.  Honey Mustard Chicken Wings and Fried Mushrooms for the both of us to share, and a Turkey and Bacon grilled sandwich for me.\n\nNow, you will be sorely disappointed if you come here expecting any sort of creativity with food.  This is straight up generic as it comes food, but they at least do it right.  The chicken wings were piping hot, meaty, and had a pretty good flavor.  I'd probably order a bolder sauce next time.  The mushrooms were really strange.  They were fried, but their breading was soft, and not crispy at all.  I like the outsides to be crunchy, so they weren't my favorite, but I had plenty of ranch to dip them in and make things better.  Now, when my sandwich came out, I stared at it and was disappointed.  It just looked sad, especially with the straight from the bag wheat bread it was made with.  Let me tell ya, don't judge this book by it's cover.  My sandwich was packed with turkey and simply loaded with delightfully salty, crunchy bacon.  It was a really good sandwich, I'm just sad that I was too full to finish it!  The fries were, well, just fries.\n\nI'll probably come back to this place sometime when we're in the area again.  The food is solid, the service is decent, and you cannot beat the prices.

The were tiny and over cooked but they gave us like 18-19 to make up for it. The spice was surprisingly good for mild and they gave a shit ton of veggies with it. The ranch was watered down and tasted like it. \n\nThe burger was said to be 1/2 lb but I doubt it was.

None of which are pricey. Everything is very reasonalbe there.\n\nMy wife normally orders either the mini chef salad with ham. Why because the regular chef's salad with ham & turkey is huge. Even the mini chef salad is more than enough for one person. If she doesn't get the mini checfs salad she will order one of their burgers. She says they are always made to perfection & taste good. \n\nFor me I think over the years I've tried everything on their menu. My favorite is the liver & onions. Just make sure they don't over cook it.

To begin with, the busboy brought our silverware and menus out right away (A+).  Then it went downhill from here...When our server, Aubrey, finally did show up, she asked us for our drink order and we told her were actually ready to order.  This did not matter to Aubrey...she took our drink order and said she'd be back for our food order when she could write it down.  Okay....she brought back our sodas and we order our burgers.  Mine was ordered medium and my wife ordered hers well done.\n\nSome time later when the food arrived, we asked for some sliced pickles....they never showed up until we asked the busboy to bring them to us. I guess Aubrey was too busy helping everyone else to get our measly pickles.\n\nNow, I think well done has a universal meaning of cooked all the way through.  Aubrey may have had the chance to fix this if she ever stopped back by to check on us, but she did not.  \n\nDuring this time, we observed Aubrey checking on other patrons but we somehow escaped her attention.  I was tempted to ask her what we did to upset her but she never came back to our table.\n\nWe finally flagged her down to get our check, it took way too long to prepare.  To give you an idea of how bad the service was, the bill was $24.82, I left $25.\n\nI asked to speak to the manager and David came out and introduced himself as the owner and I explained to him what had happened.  He introduced his wife to me and asked her to get me a gift card for the amount of my check.  He was extremely apologetic about the service we received.\n\nA few minutes later I was out the door with my gift card (which I did not want in the first place).\n\nMy wife was waiting outside (that's how upset she was) and when I told her what had happened, she took the gift card and was going to return it to him and let him know that's not what we wanted.\n\nAs we were walking back in, we spotted a homeless gentleman and offered the gift card to him as we had no intention of EVER returning.\n\nMy wife went in to explain to the owners what she had done with the gift card and the homeless gentleman followed us in and was going to order some food.\n\nWe left and as we were pulling out the parking lot, the homeless man informed us that David had taken the gift card away from him and told him it was not valid and that if he didn't leave he was going to call the police.\n\nWow....really?  Unbelievable...we will never return and I sincerely hope anyone reading this will think twice before patronizing an establishment that treats people this way.", "business_id": "vFJmFFfPVhHkC3bWOeZnNA", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-03-13", "type": "review"}

Pulled up at 6:30 and a line so it must be the real deal.  Gave my name to the hostess and told maybe a 15 minute wait which was perfect as my son and his friend would not arrive till then. 45 minutes passed and I checked with the hostess as I am noticing a few groups being seated who arrived after me. This time the hostess was not the young girl who took my reservation but an older lady who advised me I had a long wait as I was last on the list and at least 6 groups ahead of me. Some how they must have made a mixup but I would not mind the wait as it must be good. Finally 8:10 pm we are seated and quickly served water and menus. I asked about the fish and was told it was all you can eat Fresh Alaskan Pollack, Cole Slaw and French Fries for $9.95. Alaskan Pollack is not too bad white fish, similar to cod where it's namesake Atlantic Pollack is not the same species and is somewhat a slim white fish with color close to the skin and an off flavor, mostly ground and used in fish sticks and imitation crab. While the fish was cooked nicely and the french fries crisp, the fish was not Alaskan Pollock and had the off taste of its namesake from the Atlantic. Service was scatter brained from the hostess mixup to the server who had the memory of a gnat and took us the last 15 minutes to get our check. Just by the sheer number of guests I think I just hit them on a bad night and maybe their fish provider made a mistake this week. I will head back to the Peoria Cafe for my fish next Friday as it is always good but I can't help myself to try new Friday night fish fry's over the Valley.", "business_id": "9UgwLTF5mSf9ip2xEYYy2g", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-03-08", "type": "review"}

First of all, when we got here this place was SLAMMED, like no room to breath because of their fish fry and Lent (I guess?) and most of the clientele were older people. As the night went on, the crown thinned. I didn't eat the food, so I can't comment on that, but I had a few drinks. At the beginning of the night, the drinks were not very good and hard to come by. They did get a little better (could be based on my choices... started with a tequila sunrise that wasn't so good, but later got a coffee with Bailey's which I liked). The best part was the price, very inexpensive with drinks costing about 5$ a piece. So, this was just kind of okay. My main complaint was the karaoke. They clearly had favorites and picked the same names over and over while others didn't get to sing at all. We were a large party and were dropping serious money here, so I thought they would be a bit more welcoming and fair with our group. I get that they have regulars, but still not a good excuse. I can't say that I would come back here unless invited by someone else.", "business_id": "9UgwLTF5mSf9ip2xEYYy2g", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-03-15", "type": "review"}

You'll likely miss the \"cafe\" signage your first time here, but your persistence will be rewarded. It's been hiding here for 21 years!\n\nVery small, with a great Midwestern family sort of vibe. Owner is named Peggy. Friendly waitresses who know the names of all their regulars. But don't worry, they'll be friendly to you as well. And their names are printed on their shirts, so you can call them by name if you'd like. Walk on in and seat yourself. \nLook for a clipboard posted outside on a column to sign yourself in during busy times.\n\nTables are squeezed into a very tight space, really my only complaint, with no table seating more than four. But they'll move tables around for you if you're a bigger party. My \"neighbors\" this day included a dad with a preschooler, a couple of Iowa snowbirds, and some millennials dining after a workout. All friendly.\n\nAnd kid friendly! Crayons. Kids Meals start at $1.50, although $2.95 is the likely amount to be spent. But the big win, at least according to the five and six year old who often accompany me out, is the chocolate chip cookie on a stick you receive if you finish your meal. What could be better than topping off a pancake breakfast with a chocolate chip cookie? Well...\n\nNo, they're not dog friendly, even with limited outside seating. Don't judge, though. It's easy to understand why there have been past problems with both a dog groomer and a veterinarian located next door.\n\nOh yes, the adult food. I can really only speak to their breakfasts, which I love. Look for the specials posted on a whiteboard above a cooler in the back of the cafe. Great breakfast deals M-F until 11:00.

The place is not open on Mondays and breakfast has limited hours during the week. There are three separate restaurant/eating areas on the farm. The lunch area is close to 32nd street with a canopy covered area and then lots of picnic tables deeper into the property. Back deep into the property there is a breakfast place, Morning Glory and the dinner restaurant, whose name eludes me right now. We dropped in for breakfast (almost missed it.)\n\nWe were able to seat ourselves and chose an umbrella covered table to stay out of the sun. The red and white checkered table cloths were very cute and very gave the whole area a homey feeling. Drinks here are serve yourself and you can just walk up and get what you like. (Try the lemonade/iced tea combo, aka. an Arnold Palmer, yummy. )\n\nThe wait staff were very nice and friendly. They asked where we were from and made a little conversation. SG got the French toast and I got a simple egg dish. The setting was gorgeous. I am not sure how it would be on a summer day in Phoenix, but March was perfect, especially with umbrellas to cover from the sun. Our food arrived fairly quickly. My dish was straight forward but good. SG's French toast was to die for. It was homemade bread, very thick and super good. \n\nThe lunch place was absolutely packed. This was a Thursday and the line was really long. Tons of mom's with little kids and people who look like they were on lunch break from work nearby. Food is served in baskets and then you can take it to your table. It seemed to be more like sandwiches and sides. I do not think there are servers, only counter service, and mostly it appeared to be cold foods. We did not get a chance to eat here. \n\nI have rated this place a 5 because the place is just such a great setting. All of the eating areas seemed to have great setups for groups, families, and couples. A designated room is set up for rental and parties. I think this would be a pretty great place to get married too and have the reception.

It's amazing that a place so serene and beautiful exists in the middle of a metropolitan area.  Both times we have had to wait, but nothing too long. Yesterday there were some vendors set up outside Morning Glory Cafe, so my inlaws shopped a bit while waiting.\n\nThe food is absolutely delicious! I love how they use fresh and seasonal products, which I think makes it even better.  The American breakfast is standard breakfast but enough food to make me full without being stuffed. My husband had the belgian waffle yesterday and let me have a bite...it was awesome. Plus the whipped cream they give you with it is so light and refreshing...needless to say I ate the rest of it when he was done!  My mother-in-law loved her eggs benedict and had to give half to my father-in-law because the portions were so large. My father-in-law had the chicken enchalidas...delicious! Everyone at the table snagged some...the tomatillo sauce was so flavorful.  I love how they give you your own mini champagne bottle for mimosas.  I'm not sure what the final bill was because my father-in-law paid, but the first time we went for brunch, I think it was around $50 for my husband and I with tip.\n\nAfter eating, make sure to wander around the property. The Artist's Studio and The Cottage are very cute and full of art and jewelry for sale.  We met the artist in residence yesterday and she was super nice.

There's also an expansive organic garden with rows of vegetables and flowers which I understand supplies the cafes that are on site with all their fresh produce. A little further behind the garden, the Morning Glory Cafe serves breakfast, The Retreat - a place for massages, facials, Reiki and mid-wife counseling, and the Cottage - a place for local artists to display and showcase their artwork.\n\nAfter I had breakfast at the Morning Glory Cate (that's another review) I spent some time at the artists studio looking over the work of some very talented artists.\n\nThe lunch spot is the Farm Kitchen which is located towards the entrance of the complex.

Our selection was Morning Glory Cafe.\n\nThere were lots of cute outdoor tables, some with umbrellas, scattered in a little garden courtyard.  Servers were mulling about offering muffins and scones from large baskets as you looked over your menu.  Unlike bread at many restaurants these carbs ain't free.  we were told to help ourselves to drinks.  Nearby, there were spigotted vessels with coffee, water, lemonade, and a unsweetened flavoured iced tea.  Again, you will be charged for these later.\n\nPerusing the menu, we were torn because everything looked delicious. There were a handful of omelettes, eggs benedict, french toast, and even a french toast monte cristo.  You could also order beverages not on spigot, like fresh squeezed oj and mimosas (i think these were $7.50) from this menu.\n\nSticking with self-serve drinks, Jen ordered a South Mountain Omelette which came with rosemary roasted potatoes and an herb biscuit.  I ordered morning glory benedict minus the ham, which came with accoutrement of rosemary potatoes but no biscuit.  It seemed like our food came a few minutes after ordering it.  It was the fastest service I have ever experienced.\n\nJen's omelette had green peppers, red peppers, snap peas, tomatoes, swiss chard, and farmer's cheese ontop,  She said, \"This is the best omelette ever.\"  My eggs benedict (i'm a fan of benedicts) had perfectly poached eggs voluptuously mounting a tomato, on an english muffin bed, a dark green blanket of spinach draped over shoulders, and one of the best hollandaises ladeled ontop of it all.  It was delicious.  Also delicious was the rosemary roasted potatoes.  However, the biscuit was incredibly dry, so it was like mixing Quickrete(r) in yo mouf. (yes, i just said yo mouf)\n\nIt was very good food overall though with the eggs coming straight outta the hen house a few yards away and the veggies hailing from the equidistant farmer's market.

Then someone else came out and told me I would have to pay full price, I said I understood that, I just didn't want to waste any food. Finally, my order comes out she says \"sorry the kitchen is too busy so you have to get the full order.\"\n\nMy eggs were okay but I think they forgot to toast the muffins so the meal didn't taste good.\n\nThe second time we went there, we decided to try going during the week so it wouldn't be as busy.

I had it bookmarked to try for over a year. Finally got around to doing just that on Sat, May 3rd, 2014. I guess it was a bad omen when the BBQ place I wanted to take friends was already sold out and had been before noon that day.\n\nWhile they may serve good ingredients they sure do charge a premium for them. I spent just short of $22 (yep, half sandwich, cup of soup, drink and a small dessert, $22) for lunch and that was no tip included.\n\nWhy no tip you ask? Well other then having to make the sandwich I ordered and pour the soup into the cup you have to do everything yourself including clean up after yourself. TIPS really means: To Insure Prompt Service. There is no service here. Plus they gave me the wrong sandwich. So they got 50% of my order wrong.\n\n$22 for a self service lunch with baskets and plasticware. The sandwich was good and the soup just ok. This should have been at the very most, $10 to $12. I guess you have to pay for the ambiance of dining outside. Hey, it didn't cost them a dime to erect a building, insure it, air condition it, etc. All of the other expenses which might drive the cost up to $22.\n\nAnd honestly while it was nice to dine on a rickety old splinter infested wobbly picnic table under a tree, it wasn't like it was a nicely manicured golf course like lawn.

We were seated quickly enough, but that was the only plus. Our waiter gave us our menus and took our drink orders and said that once we are done deciding on what to get, to close the menus so that she would know when we were ready to order. This was not our first time to an IHOP so we all knew what we wanted and closed the menus fairly quickly. \n\nAfter around 40 minutes to a hour, we were growing restless that not even our order has been taken. I had to get up from my seat to notify the waiter that we were ready to place our order. When our waiter asked what we would like it went relatively smoothly till my friend ordered one peach crepe with the creme on the side and well done hash browns, and suddenly came a very disrespectful sigh of annoyance as the waiter wrote that down. Like it was such an inconvenience to her to place such a complex order. \n\nAfter another hour of waiting for the food to come out, we were just about to get get up and leave but the waiter said that our food will come out in just a few minutes. Now, we were sure that the food has been sitting out for a good amount of time because it was cold to the touch. We could not even bear to finish our meals so we left quickly but soon after that a couple of us started have issues with our stomach, such as from eating food that has been sitting out for quite awhile. \n\nWe got out of the restaurant at 11:30pm with such disappointment that it would have been a better choice for us just to grab food from a McDonald's. We generally give out a decent amount for a tip ranging from 20-50 percent, each, for quality service, however, it must be earned. All seven of us did not tip a single cent.

If you want to grab a drink, we'll go here! We even spent one horribly drunken New Year's Eve partying it up with the Rock Bottom crew. This would normally be a 5-star review but I feel like their service has gone downhill a bit in the last 6 months and this could stand to be addressed.\n\nFirst of all, you cannot beat Happy Hour! As a beer snob, I often feel left out when the Happy Hour specials only include America's favorite urine-colored watered down drinks. Occasionally I can get a Sam Adam's or Blue Moon, but it's nothing to match. The specials here vary by the day but you'll be able to get a pint of beer or a mixed drink for around $3- sign up for their free Mug Club and you'll get 20oz mugs every time too! There's a patio with smoking on one side only- it's great to sit out there most of the year but does get packed close to the weekends. \n\nThe food specials at Happy Hour beat the oh-so-cheap yet mediocre Applebee's standard. Most appetizers are $3- a few items, such as sliders, show up just for happy hour and aren't even on the regular menu. There is a burger they offer for $5, and you can get a bucket of fries or kettle chips for $1.50. The sliders are my favorite (both chicken and beef), and i'd also recommend kettle chips, the spinach artichoke dip, or the nachos. \n\nThe beers could almost use their own review- there are 6 or 7 to try and account for what people like to drink. There is usually a special seasonal beer along with a cask-conditioned option. As I mentioned before, the best way to drink beer is with a Mug Club card. You'll get a 20oz mug for the 16oz price and accumulate points towards things such as logo pint glasses. If you like the urine-variety of mass-produced beers, try a Dreamcatcher. If you enjoy good flavor, try the El Jefe Hefeweizen, Desert Trail Pale Ale, or Raptor Red. At this location in particular I think the El Jefe is the best. \n\nThe food is delicious- i'm getting to the point where i've tried almost everything on the menu. The standouts are the Mac N' Chicken, the Lemon Chicken, the Smoked Salmon Fish and Chips, and the Prime Rib (they run specials on this at various times of the year). A lot of entrees come with the wonderful White Cheddar Mashed Potatoes, and the vegetables you are served are pretty flavorful. Definitely good enough to deserve coming here even if you don't drink beer.\n\nMy only complaints lately are that the service has gone downhill. We've been several times in the past few months- 3 times for happy hour and once for dinner. One time at happy hour was perfect, the second our food came out and had clearly been sitting around (coagulated cheese skin on top of the artichoke dip), and the third the food had only sat a tiny bit but it took us forever to get the attention of our waitress. The time we went for dinner the food was good, but it took a long time and didn't come out all at once. If the restaurant can resolve this, it'll earn its 5th star.", "business_id": "s_cKw6m0Fw9jZbobRH0YSg", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-04-21", "type": "review"}

Our friends had the angel hair shrimp pasta that was Soaking in sauce.. yet another dish that could have been on the healthy side, but Sadly, was not...  Monday's special of the day (the petit filet) was cooked nicely and tasted surprisingly good with the horseradish mustard that I found on the table next to me.\n\nI wouldn't really want to go back here, but the food was decent... not bad, not great, just plain ol' decent.", "business_id": "SgTjnyElc26gPUghVuCuSQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-03-31", "type": "review"}
