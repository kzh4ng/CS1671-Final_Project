There are many options especially in Scottsdale for fine dining, especially if one craves Italian cuisine. However, one seldom finds as complete a package as Marcellino. The combination of ambience, charming decor, impeccable service, and flavorful dishes makes this an excellent choice if you are bringing a date or celebarting a special occasion. Try the homemade pasta, trust me it is to die for. They also have a version of chicken saltimboca (can't remember the menu name) that is heavenly. If you dine al fresco, you might get some live music blaring from Tapas Papa Frita, which is either a plus or minus depending on your threshold for music volume. Prices are somewhat high, but is within the expected range for a classy Scottsdale establishment. One downside is that I would not recommend the mussels appetizer as the mussels are tiny. The desserts are homemade and decent although not something I would write home about. Truly the main course is the crown jewel of this establishment's menu, but don't get me wrong - the appetizers and desserts (that we tried) are fine, just not up to the standard of the rest of the restaurant.", "business_id": "MLVKDbuI2xaOJQ4-NZj2MQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-09-01", "type": "review"}

After reading the positive reviews I really talked it up to him and we decided to try it.\n\nI also read about the special on travelzoo where you can buy $130 of spa service for $65 (half off) The ad reads \"$65 - 'Best Spas in Arizona': Half Off Massage & Pool Day\" I called Spa Lamar, spoke with Taylor and asked about a couple massage and whether we can use the vouchers. Since the price of the couples massage was over the price of 2 vouchers, I asked if I can buy 3 and use the leftover money for other services. She said YES.\n\nI went on travelzoo to buy the vouchers, the fine print said one voucher per customer so I called Spa Lamar and spoke with Taylor again. She said she would find out for sure and put me on hold. She came back on the phone and apologized and said we can only use one per person. No problem! It was still a good deal. \n\nI bought 2 vouchers, made the appointment for the following day at 1:00 (I had a early evening flight home.) She said 1:00 wasn't available, but she can get us in at 1:30. No problem again.\n\nThe next morning, Taylor called, she said they booked a couple's facial in our room, so we can't come in until 2:00. No problem again!! We got there about 1:50 and were shown to the locker rooms then \"relaxation room.\" There were 4 women in the room drinking champagne and talking very loudly about their children, therapy, etc. You couldn't even hear the music! Now, mind you, I love a girls' day out and do it often. But, couldn't they put a party in room other than the \"relaxation room\" so everyone trying to relax don't have to listen to their conversation?\n\nThe lady (I believe the owner) came to us and told us they pride themselves on being on time, but it was 4 minutes after 2 and it would be another 5 minutes before they were ready for us. No problem!! At 2:15, she walked by us, looked at the clock and frowned. A couple of minutes later, we were called into our room.\n\nMy therapist, Karen was wonderful. She gave me one of the best massages and asked me frequently if the pressure was ok. She was the only positive thing about the place. Unfortunately, my bf felt like his deep tissue massage was just a inconsistent light rubdown. \n\nAfter our massages, we went into the steam room. It smelled musty and mildewy with about an inch of water on the floor that wasn't draining. We left and tried the jacuzzi. The pool and jacuzzi did not look very clean either.\n\nOverall, I agree with Kimberly T. Spa Lamar feels very run down and not very clean. I was extremely disappointed. We gathered our things and went into the showers. Guess what?!?!? There was no hot water!!!!!!! I had to take a freezing cold shower. I mentioned it to the lady at the front desk when I came out and she said they had a lot of guest today and the hot water probably needed to cycle through. I told her my bf took a shower in the one next to me and his was hot!\n\nTo add insult to injury of a horrible experience, when we checked out, they couldn't figure out how to discount the travelzoo vouchers so they tried with a calculator and told us we owed an amount a lot more than we were expecting. When I tried to explain to just minus $260 (2 vouchers) from the amount owed, they said the vouchers were only good for $110 each, not $130!!! The other $20 was for yoga classes. I explained the ad said 50% off $130 value and they insisted it was not all towards massages and the voucher was only good for a one hour massage which is $110. They said it would be the last time they advertised through travelzoo. \n\nI told them of my experience starting with misinformation about the voucher the day before to the appointment time, then the cold shower and they asked what I thought was right. I told them to simply honor the voucher as it is advertised!\n\nAll in all, it was a horrible and costly experience at a run down place. I will never go back again.", "business_id": "EaziHWcmjm5nGmPF-CJgQA", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-11-11", "type": "review"}

I ordered shrimp ravioli and chicken florentine.  Although the chicken florentine is not on their menu, they accommodated my request.  The food was delivered on time and was warm.  I gave them my budget and they worked with me to meet it.  We had so much food but little leftover because it was so delicious.  The owner called me the next day to ask how everything went.

Service was the worst I've experienced in a long time. So disappointed. \n\nI went here with my friends last night for HH. I've been to RA before but tonight I had my $20 gift certificate for my half bday. I love this! I used this last year and couldn't wait to do it again. The Vegas roll is amazing! Now to the service. I initally sat inside but when my friends arrived we went out to the patio. The male server who brought me my drink inside was great! When we went outside and had a new server everything went down hill. First the server only brought us 1 menu for a table of 3 people. We had to ask for the HH menu and she dropped it down and walked away. When we ordered I asked if she could leave the HH menu there in case we wanted to order more drinks and she got an attitude with me (wasn't the first time) and told me she needed to make room on the table so she took it from me. I've noticed that the last couple of times I go to RA they leave the wasbi off of the sushi plates and I have to request for it when i receive my rolls. I had to do this last night and she again responded with an attitude and walked away. She never asked if we wanted refills. She was upset when I was trying to explain who was going to pay what with our cards. She came back with our cards she handed my check to me and mispronounced my name purposely (it's Jaime) so...  gave her my gift certificate and it seemed like the total owed was off she ignored us when we tried to call her over. She looked straight at us and kept walking. I just paid and left. I have no clue why she was in such a bad attitude but it's ashamed because I love the food and she made our experience horrible. Never going back there again and I'm going to vocalize our experience to my friends (at least not at that location).", "business_id": "nk6_ipMkmUvUtq6Xvncf0A", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-11-14", "type": "review"}

They have always been known to have large portions, but the service and the food has just been average. Starving after a flight and getting settled into our resorts, we ended up here for dinner. The 5 of us all got a huge booth. Our waiter was quick to get our drink orders. We ordered steaks, a pot roast and a spinach chicken salad. Two of us shared to meals and the waiter was gracious enough to have the chef split both plates so that we didnt have to. Again, our waiter was great. It turns out he is from Marin and grew up in the bay area. It figures. He made sure we always had our teas and waters refreshed and was there for us when we needed anything. Everyone was more than satisfied with their steaks. The salad and pot roast were great. I think the veggies in the pot roast could have used a few more minutes, though.
