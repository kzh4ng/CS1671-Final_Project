Mad Mex is awesome from their chips and salsa, to their burritos to their margaritas, never a bad meal, drink, or service! I have been here for both lunch and dinner. \n\nThe atmosphere is very fun too, the art is pretty cool  and resembles the Mexican Day of the Dead, and it just has a relaxed vibe to it. It is a casual place so you are perfect in jeans!\n\nTheir margaritas are really good and reasonably priced. Are you a beer drinker? They have a ton of beers that they serve and a decent amount on tap. Around fall they have an awesome selection of fall beers and they have pumpkin beer.\n\nAlso in fall they have this wonderful little thing called a gobblerito.  You must try it,  it is the most amazing thing I have ever tried.  Although to some the idea may sound gross, you MUST give it a try!!! A gobblerito is: turkey, stuffing,  corn, some black beans, and mashed potatoes all wrapped up neatly in a burrito shell. You get gravy and cranberry sauce as a side!

Frankly they take these ready-made empanadas and microwave them before serving them to the customer, so i don't understand why they coudln't have just gotten some more from the huge mound of empanadas i saw in the store just minutes before. but i was too lazy to ask. also, they microwave the empanadas on styrofoam plates....no comment.\n\nthe 1 taco for $3/ 2 tacos for $5 was probably the best deal that I could find in pittsburgh for some close to authentic mexican tacos as i coudl find.  They indeed pack your taco with a lot of the fixings, but in doing so, they don't realize that all the juicyness that comes from the meat (especially the lengua) causes the little corn tortilla to rip very easily.  i have not been any other mexican joint that serves these style tacos with only one little corn tortilla: they're always made with two corn tortillas with the presumed purpose of protecting rippage.  one star off for that.  The salsa on the side that was left out that was the perfect consistency of the type of salsa i like (non chunky) was somehow too dry.  this may have been due to lack of freshness.  if only it were fresher, it would have been a nice complement to my tacos. on the upside, they prepare the meat from scratch, putting a little blot of uncooked meat on their grill, while they prepare it in front of your eyes. that was a welcome difference for this joint compared to other taco joints.\n\nall in all, compared to the other place in pittsburgh i've tried for tacos (Mexico City), I'd much rather come here.  closer, cheaper, and tastier. mexico city does not do mexican food justice.", "business_id": "buVALudg30kgkDusqB3yJw", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-10-17", "type": "review"}

Pittsburgh simply isn't a big city for them (I've heard San Francisco is the best place for Food Trucks). Other then the occasional hot dog vender they are few and far between here. As far as I remember today was my first street food experience and that took place at Reyna's Taco Shack in the Strip District.\n\nI've been told for the past three months by Kandace that they had the best tacos in Pittsburgh here. Being a fan of tacos, and Mexican food in general, I had to judge them for myself. The shack is staffed by a single man armed with two skillets and few ingredients. I ordered a chicken taco and a steak taco to mix it up a bit.\n\n\nThe Chicken Taco:\n\nKandace might be right. This was easily one of the best tacos I've ever had in my life. Tortillas are something that can easily make or break a taco and these ones were excellent. They were obviously homemade and perfectly cooked. The guy manning the shack briefly grilled them on one skillet then transferred them on top of the filling for awhile. It really added to the overall taste of the taco. The chicken was shredded pretty thin which worried me at first because the chance of it being dry was greatly increased. I couldn't have been more wrong. The chicken was extremely moist and juicy. Perfectly cooked. This guy was a master of his craft. Each taco was topped with a good amount of sour cream, lettuce, tomato, cheese, and cilantro (which was a nice touch). They had three different salsa to choose from but I chose to eat mine plain. I'm glad I did. I could easily eat these tacos 2 or 3 times a week.\n\nThe Steak Taco:\n\nBasically copy and paste everything I just said above about the chicken tacos. I did have one issue with the steak though. It was cut into tiny cubes which made some (not all) pieces pretty chewy. It wasn't as perfect as the chicken but it was pretty close.\n\nThe Rating:\n\nWas it filling?: I had 2 tacos and was pretty full. I could have probably had another 2 but I normally devour tacos\n\nDid I feel gross afterwards?: Not really\n\nWould I go there again?: Yes 100%. I'd like to try a burrito or shrimp taco\n\nWould I order it again?: The chicken yes. I think I'd opt to try something different before I got the steak again", "business_id": "buVALudg30kgkDusqB3yJw", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-09-02", "type": "review"}

The actual taco is a perfect blend, and they are packed full.  I got the carnitas and pollo tacos.  They meat was not spiced as well as I wanted, and they were a little too mild for my taste.

Unfortunately, it was not as good as I hoped. The cashier argued with my boyfriend over what kind of dried red chiles to buy, and harassed him when he was browsing the store (she yelled across the store: \"Are you done yet? I already started ringing you up.\"). The house-made corn tortillas were bland and only with the help of a guy running a nearby taco stand (who did not work at Reyna's) did we find the right chiles... The cashier had no idea what we were asking for.\n\nThen there was the Hatch green chile fiasco. Shortly after arriving here, I was searching for Hatch green chile in the area and found out Reyna's would be doing pre-orders. Hooray! I ordered and paid for some online. The website said they would be roasting at the store so I called to ask about it. I was told in a very rude manner that roasting would only happen at the pepper festival, which I would have to pay $7 per person to attend, just to get my chile and get it roasted. Okay, fine. The day before the festival I called the store to confirm that my actual pre-order would be available at the festival. I was mid-question when the clerk on the phone interrupted me: \"What? ... Can you call back later, I'm really busy.\" WTF?\n\nSo I go to the festival to get my chile. The people at the roasting station seem confused when I present my pre-order receipt, but they eventually figure it out, telling me to come back later to get t because it isn't roasted yet. We walked around the festival for an hour then went back, and there is even more confusion over whether ours is ready. Finally they figure it out and give us the roasted chile. Hooray!\n\nOh wait though. We get home and open it up and... Apparently they don't know how to roast it correctly. We bought bulk roasted chiles in New Mexico every year and never had issues peeling it before freezing it. This chile they roasted? It's somehow completely mushy and falling apart, but has almost no visible char, and it's fucking impossible to remove the peel. It's horrible. \n\nSo tl;dr - rude employees, both in person and on the phone. Little product knowledge. And absolutely no knowledge of how to roast green chiles, despite having a whole event around the chiles. I won't be going back.", "business_id": "buVALudg30kgkDusqB3yJw", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-09-14", "type": "review"}

I got the Speedy Gonzales, an enchilada, taco, and rice for a respectable $5.75.  The service was rather impersonal and task-focused, but maybe it was just one of those days.   I agree with Tonya that the sketch factor of  restaurants like these \"raise the stakes\": you'll either discover a hidden treasure or the Bates motel.  Miguel's, however, wasn't either one.

Now, from where I work, you could walk to more skeevy, run down looking, hole in the wall mexican joints than you can count on a hand, and I'm pretty sure at least a few of them would be absolutely delicious (as hole in the wall restaurants tend to be). Unfortunately, I can not report on any of them, because we drove by them and went to Zapatas.\n\nI won't say that Zapata's was bad, partially because i don't think it is deserved and partially because it feels like I am giving credit for more effort than they earned. While the salsa that came with our gratis basket of chips was full of cilantro and onion flavor, that was the high point of the meal. We ate off the lunch menu, and I went with the enchilada and taco plate. The meat in both was slightly greasy and not particularly flavorful. The taco shell tasted like it was pulled out of the grocery store box on my pantry shelf. The rice was bland and slightly overcooked. I do have to give them credit for the enchilada sauce being kinda tasty, but nothing I wouldn't expect from a jarred sauce. The low point was definitely the refried beans, which are often my favorite part. I took one mouthful, found them utterly disgusting and left the rest of them on my plate to form a sad, cold congealed mess.\n\nI have often thought that quality service can redeem an otherwise forgettable meal, well in that case creepy, unpleasant service can cement a bad impression. Despite our party of three being one of less than a handful of patrons in his section, our waiter was slow to get to our table even after being called over. He gave off a used car salesman type of aura and loses additional point for trying to talk me into drinking tequila on my lunch break.\n\nThe only reason I can imagine returning to Zapata's would be at my coworkers request, and even then I might think about sticking with the tuna sandwich I brought from home. Oh, and as for that \"cheap\" bit.

I hadn't been to Pedro's in years due to a not-so-great experience at the now closed west side location, but I decided to take a gamble the other night on the east side. When we walked in at 7 on a Saturday and the place was almost completely empty we should have taken it as a sign and turned around, but we were both hungry and decided to stick it out.\n\nDisappointment number one: the tortillas were dry and tasteless. I used to crave their fresh-pressed tortillas from the east coast, so it was a total bummer to get sub-par room-temperature tortillas first thing instead of the warm, pillowy ones I used to dream about. \n\nDisappointment number two: the salsa was really sweet and thick. If you'd have served it to me in a neutral location, I'd have assumed it was spaghetti sauce that was missing some key herbs. It didn't taste fresh. \n\nDisappointment number three: the rice was so dry that it was almost crispy. The flavor was just overcooked - no spice, no richness, just an overheated taste. \n\nDisappointment number four: I have ordered a chicken chimichanga from Pedro's several times in the past, and I have always ordered it no sauce - I'm not a fan of pouring sauce all over the top of my crispy tortilla, and there was always plenty of flavor in the filling to make up for it. This time, the server/cook took my request of no sauce to mean none at all. I was served a fried tortilla filled with plain shredded chicken and nothing else. The chicken didn't even have the pepper on it that they mix in for the tacos. The filling had no cheese, no salsa, no tomatoes, no onions, no anything that you usually find at least one of in a chimichanga. So. Weird. I can't be mad, I guess, because I did say no sauce, but I've never had it served to me with literally nothing but a tortilla and chicken before, either.\n\nUpsides: the chicken itself was good, and had a fair amount of flavor for being plain; the tortilla shell was perfectly crispy; you get after-dinner mints with your bill (the kind often served in silver dishes with a spoon by registers that look like little pastel pillows). \n\nIt might be worth stopping in on Tuesdays or Thursdays for their half-price margarita special (I imagine those haven't changed over the years), but I don't think I'll be back for dinner.", "business_id": "wPidHd5FxspPRgVqdEQ-Xw", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-09-24", "type": "review"}

Oh, and the salsas they make are great, the red has a mighty nice zip.  \n\nOh, final word - house made chorizo.  Holy crap.  OK, that was five words, but it's unlike any I've had before.

Topped with Parmesan cheese and pico de gallo. This pasta was pretty much soaked with butter. Is that a typical Southwestern thing?

In sporadic meals during my years in Arizona, I've never had service that was other than charming.

The white-chocolate tamale at the end of the meal is perfect if you want a little something sweet but weren't up for dessert.\n\nOrder lots of plates to share among your group because... the food ranges from amazing to meh, and I'd swear sometimes the same dish has been both amazing and meh on different trips. (I'm certain I had the Pablo's enchiladas with a totally exciting salad and very subtle flavors on a past trip, when it was more \"well, that's an enchilada, can't argue with that\" the most recent time.) The good news is that I've never had a dish be worse than meh, and even the meh-est experience was pretty good for the first two or three bites... so if you have a bunch of dishes and are taking a couple bites of each, the odds are strongly in your favor that you'll generally be very happy.\n\nIf that method doesn't work for you, I've had good experience with the carnitas so far. There was also a very pleasant Easter brunch. You're paying about normal street prices, maybe a couple bucks above Macayo's, for enchilada-type meals (and the quality is way better, even on meh days) and $17-$20 for serious entrees.\n\nIn any case, you're really here to converse and drink and nibble chips as evening falls across the artificial pond, which experience they do exceedingly well here.\n\nETA: if you visit on a really cold, sunless day, bundle up! Like many Arizona establishments, this place expects sun through the windows to contribute to a pleasing indoor winter temperature.", "business_id": "e5kc0CQ4R-PCCDgb274gSg", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-10-03", "type": "review"}

There were regular corn chips, blue corn chips, flour chips, squash (?) chips, sweet potato chips..lightly salted and the chipotle salsa complemented the combination.  We ordered our meals and knocked off the chips waiting for our food to arrive.  We ordered more chips, (still hot when they arrived from the kitchen) and our meals arrived. My wife had an enchilada something and I had the southwest chicken salad.  Those chips really enhanced the meal.  The flour chips were lighter and softer, yet crispy and not oily.  The sweet potato chips were slightly chewy and were indeed \"sweet\" and were great.  I had iced tea, my wife had a couple of blue margaritas and said they were very good.

I don't know how they make their chicken so flavorful, but it's amazing. It's like charbroilled or grilled, so tasty. The nachos are basically 4 or 5 tostada's cut in half.  You get a layer of beans, topped with jalapeno's, cheese and chicken. A side of guacamole and sour cream come with this plate.\n\nThe chicken chimi enchilada style with the red sauce is beyond words. It's the same chicken used in the nachos. I basically lick the plate clean. \n\nI have also tried the shrimp enchiladas - too shrimp tasting for my taste, but my sister -in-law, who's big into seafood really enjoyed them. Comes with a lot of shrimp.\n\nThe carne asada tacos - were fantastic.\n\nIf you want really well done Mexican food don't waste your money anywhere else. Just come here. The wait staff is excellent and attentive.", "business_id": "BESmH-lmMm34_EefL8X9fQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-10-20", "type": "review"}

The only opportunity they have is with their Huevos Rancheros, im a fan of Rancheros but their Ranchero sauce was heavy on the tomato sauce and onion, I felt needed more complexity and adding in some Hatch or Anaheim long green would have made the sauce better.

Without reading any reviews, I decided to come have breakfast here. Although it was a full house, they had enough space to seat us promptly. We were greeted right away by a great waitress by the name of Catalina. She was very nice, attentive, and wasn't bothered at the fact that we kept ordering different things, she had a smile on her face the whole time and was extremely respectful. Even when she was walking by with food in her hands for another table, she never failed to ask us if we were ok, or if we needed anything. I haven't had such great service by a waitress in a very long time. They are so attentive that the moment we set our utensils down and were finished with out food, someone was already there picking up our empty dishes. I am so glad I came to this restaurant. They actually have a lot of seafood in all of there sea food dishes unlike most places nowadays. I was here with a party of 5. We all ordered something different. Everyone's food was DELICIOUS! I was highly impressed by the cleanliness and layout of this restaurant. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone. Very family oriented, respectful, and clean. \n\nI'm from California, I have visited so many restaurants both here and there, and it's been a very long time that I have actually been impressed by a restaurant. If I could rate more stars, I would! \n\n\nPs! \nWe had an extremely hungover friend (we had a wild night out) that didn't want to eat and felt sick to her stomach.

Disappointing.\n\nA co-worker and I weren't in the mood for Subway, McDonald's, or Einstein's, so we decided to try Chico's Tacos - a place I'd driven by many times but hadn't tried before.  The items on the menu looked decent enough, and I settled on the shredded beef taco platter and ordered it to go.\n\nI got back to work and settled in to try my meal.  The tacos were actually not in pre-formed taco shells, but instead looked like they were freshly made and fried.  Sadly, there was hardly any meat in either, and most of each taco was the shell.  They had good flavor, but the fact that they each fell apart and broke onto the styrofoam plate below sort of ruined them.  The beans and ride were both inedible.  the beans were overcooked and had a slightly burned flavor, with a layer or congealed cheese over the top.  The rice was mushy and bland, except for the top-most layer, which was over-seasoned with cumin.  I was given a small bag of tortilla chips, and those were passable.  Including a large fountain drink, I paid $10.62.\n\nI won't be back, especially when there's a Filibertos just down the road.", "business_id": "D09yG6Z3gcsh24Qn7Y4gYA", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-11-05", "type": "review"}

First off they offer chips and a trip to the salsa bar right after you pay for your order. This way you get a quick appetizer and something to keep you entertained while they cook your order. But there's only one thing I order each time I come here, Nachos! This place has the most delicious plate of nachos that I've come across in the area. Of course the serving size is generous, I usually make it a point to not finish the plate, it's so big. It has the standard toppings, the beans are good, the red sauce that they drape over it is great. But what makes these better then most is first the cheese, love the flavor and their not afraid to pile it on. But what wins me over every time is that they cook the plate in a broiler, which makes it all nice and hot, melts, crisps up the cheese and the chips. The combination of it all is a heavenly splurge that doesn't hit a spot, but burns a new special place of its own into your gastronomic mind!

We choose a type of food we like, then go out and find 5 different restaurants to try that type of food from. Whichever restaurant we rank highest is where we'll go when we're in the mood for that type of food. There are 4, sometimes 5 of us so the winning restaurants get a nice sale each time we go out. I let the cashiers/owners know about our contest up front so they know we'll be back (plenty) if they win. We've done Gyros (Z's Greek wins), Burgers (Chicago Hamburger Company wins), and now we're doing hard shell tacos.  \n\nToday we tried Rosita's place. I walked in and let the lady know about our contest. She asked what restaurants we planned to try then mentioned that we shouldn't include franchise restaurants because their food will be cheap and sub-par and cannot touch a family restaurant like hers. I appreciated her opinion. \n\nI started my order by asking if I could substitute one of the ground beef tacos in the combination plate for chicken and was given an emphatic NO. She said it costs them extra for the meat so it was only fair to charge us extra. So, I kindly paid an extra 2.50 to get a machaca and chicken taco in my combo and continued the order. I asked for mild salsa with one pair of tacos and was told \"we have red and green and everyone will get both\". 4 of us ordered a total of 8 tacos, 1 combination plate, and an order of chips and salsa. Total sale was around 33 bucks.  \n\nI get back to the office and hand out the food and this is when we realized that we got CHIPS AND HOT SAUCE, not Chips and Salsa which was a very unpleasant surprise. Many of the chips were chewy and soggy and we threw most of the bag away because of this. I expected white meat in my 3.00 chicken tacos but received dark, greasy meat. I thought a family restaurant will always provide quality meat?? The machaca was so overloaded with grease that the lettuce turned gray and slimy and the hard taco turned soft and mushy. I literally had to POUR the grease out. The chicken was flavorless and we didn't get cheese on any of the tacos. Let me guess, only fair they charge extra for cheese?? \n\nNot all of our tacos were as bad as mine but we all expected better flavor, cheese on our tacos, white-meat chicken, the ability to mix and match taco choices, and salsa with our chips; after all, a family restaurant will always be better quality than a franchise, RIGHT? The beans and rice were pretty good and while I do like my hot sauce hot I feel they substitute flavor with spice. \n\nAll in all, I give Rosita's Place 3 out of 1000 stars (for the rice and beans and that's sad). I also found it offensive and absurd that they would openly slam on franchise restaurants when a Filiberto's or Chipotle taco blows the doors off of Rosita's Place. All of us agreed that this place would be at the bottom of the list come time to choose a winner. This is obviously not saying any other entree they have is just as bad; I'm only discussing their tacos. I was waiting all week to get some good tacos and am highly disappointed. It's safe to say I will never go to this restaurant again.", "business_id": "hWhVP-28LYP3llaMlAJ_JA", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-09-07", "type": "review"}

That being said, you might wonder why I am only giving it three stars. I have been going to Rositas off and on since 1998. I have had some of the rudest disconnected service there over that time period. Many of the wait staff seem to think that they are doing you a favor by waiting on you, and at points I have actually felt like a bother. I usually go back once every year or two to see if things have changed. Most of the time it hasn't. The only reason that I have ever wanted to go back was because of the food.\nThis all being said, the last time I went there was a decent experience. The food was great as usual and the service was noticeably better. The waitress wasn't as disinterested or rude like I have experienced in the past. She wasn't super friendly, but I didn't wish I had gone someplace else. Like I said, the only reason I go back is the food, so I was happy to see better service this time. This was a good and welcomed improvement. I'm not picky, check out my other reviews. This is the lowest one I have done so far. Rositas would be the Mexican restaurant of choice in the Phoenix area if the demeanor of the wait staff was better. I am happy to see that they are at least hiring people with better attitudes.

We decided to drive across town and try it based on the Yelp reviews and it was definitely a letdown.

The people at the door were not particularly friendly but little did we know that it would go downhill from there.  Our waitress was one of the most surly servers I've ever had anywhere.  No greeting, no smile, no eye contact.  Just a look of pained exasperation.  We asked her a few questions and she simply ignored them.  It was not busy.  Seriously, the unfriendliness of the staff here is hard to overstate.  They just don't give a damn.\n\nThe food was all over the place.\n\nSalsas - excellent, both red and green. Nice and spicy just like we like it.\n\nChips - fresh, but greasy.\n\nChicken enchiladas in mole sauce - quite good. Humongous portion.\n\nSteak Tampiquena  - just ok.  Not really a traditional Tampiquena.   About four ounces (or less) of pounded round steak with no topping of any kind.  Not bad but a bit pricey for the eleven bucks or so they are asking and not up to the standard that you get at most Mexican joints around town.\n\nBeans - Awesome, as many reviewers point out.  Some of the best refried beans I've ever had. By far the highlight of the meal.\n\nGuacamole -  Overwhelmed by the flavor of what I can only guess to be powdered citric acid instead of fresh lime juice.  Very odd and not really nice at all.  What kind of Mexican restaurant doesn't use fresh limes?  \n\nMariachis - insistent and annoying.

The only reason I was able to eat this and two tacos is because I'm a fatass - I'm pretty sure a normal person couldn't even finish the lone burrito.\n\nI also tried a bite of someone else's fish taco and it was awesome.  Most places deep-fry their fish for tacos, but La Tolteca grills it, which gives a different flavor and texture that is absolutely fantastic.\n\nThe salsas are also really fresh and delicious.  Even though I prefer spicier food, the mild salsa verde was very flavorful and delicious.  The salsa habanera had a good kick to it and satisfied my craving for something hot.\n\nLa Tolteca is awesome, and it's unfortunate that I didn't find it until after I moved out of Phoenix.

The chips were fresh as can be (still warm in the bag), and the salsas...oh the salsas...they were all great, but the stand out had to be the habanero. It was definitely one of the best salsas I've ever had, and my girlfriend considered it the best she had ever had. That's not to be taken lightly because we eat salsa almost religiously. Because my girlfriend got the chilaquiles, I went with the huevos rancheros. They were piping fresh and everything one would expect. The second I cut open the yolk of the egg and saw the yellow and red run together, I knew I was in for a treat. The flavors of that mixed with beans and a little rice were really great! For those of you that have had good huevos rancheros before you'll know what to expect. Alright, and lastly the chilaquiles. In all seriousness, these were the best, and I mean the BEST chilaquiles I've ever had! I'm not sure exactly what was going on in the kitchen, but I suspect a tiny sprinkling of crack right before it was served to us, but that may have just been the garlic. Either way though, it was phenomenal!

We enjoyed good conversation amidst the early Goodwill high back dining chairs, the Formica tables mixed with the old Ethan Allen desks serving as tables (thanks for that insight Mark) and crowd of diners from a broad swath of life.\n\nThe chips were good, standard stuff.  The red and green salsa was also tasty, although the red is mild bordering on hot and the green is just hot.  I recommend waiting until your drink arrives before starting in on the green salsa.\n\nI wanted 2 enchiladas.  They come with cheese and I wanted one with cheese and one with chicken added.  There was a bit of language difficulty and I ended up with 2 chicken enchiladas.  \n\nBut let me start with the basics because that is where my judgment of a Mexican restaurant begins:  rice and beans.  If they miss on the basic rice and beans then they will have a hard time getting me back.  The rice and beans were good.  Not greasy, not dry.  Great.  On to the enchiladas.\n\nThe chicken enchiladas were smothered in a generous amount of enchilada sauce and cheese and filled with a hearty portion of stewed chicken.  Good stuff.\n\nI will absolutely add Tacos De Juarez to my list of good & cheap restaurants.  And having been in the El Paso/Juarez area recently I can say that even though the neighborhood immediately surrounding Tacos De Juarez looks a little sketchy it is not.

I have had better for the same or less $$ and for a much better atmosphere...that place is making a killing they could have maybe some more shaded cheap/vintage seating a sign a mural something...give the place a little character and I can maybe feel better about spending my hard earned $$ there.

My son liked it so much he had one as an appetizer, and another larger one as his main course.\n\nMy brother then had Grilled Octopus - very tasty and tender. I ordered the Fish Grilled in Garlic Sauce. Amazingly fresh, and done (not overdone) just right. Both platters came with  rice. beans, salad, and under the fish - French Fries! Not at all soggy. And the warm tortillas and spicy salsa let you build a few tacos along the way.\n\nWe washed everything down with several Mexican beers, at  4 bucks a bottle, the same as they charge for for 'domestic' beer (although domestic here would probably be Mexican). Friendly waitress and patrons, and even though we were the only gringos in the place, we felt right at home.\n\nThe three meals, as above, with tax, tip and beers came out to only about $70.

We were greeted by the owner who is very attentive, and seated straight away. Having read the Yelp! reviews, I knew I was going to aim for the camarones culichi, and gazed at their vast options anyhow. I consider myself pretty seafood savvy! They have such an array of fish dishes that I long to try! Especially their fish soup... it looked amazing. However, I stuck to my trusted reviews and ordered the camarones culichi, my mother ordered the garlic shrimp, and my aunt ordered the fried fish filet. \n\nI know they said not to fill up on the chips and salsa-- but that green salsa made me so happy, I think I will order a pint to take home next time I go. Trust me. \n\nFirst, they brought by little ceviche tostadas to try-- I was so excited that the fish tasted so fresh and delightful. Also, free ceviche? I have no idea if they do this all the time, but what a deal! It had a chipotle and citrus flavor immersed in it and was light, but very satisfying. \n\nThe culichi sauce is full of tomatillo, cilantro, garlic, and lime-- however, their combination is so magical, I cannot express it without salivating. The shrimp are cooked in the sauce and brought out separate from the salad, beans, and rice, and they have the same amazing taste. I will seriously write a poem for how that sauce tastes-- and they give you plenty of fresh tortillas that I wrapped the beans and rice with and dipped in that sauce to ensure I got every last drop. You could taste the freshness of the fish even in the fried fish, which was seasoned and fried to perfection. The \"exquisite salad\" that they offer with every meal really is exquisite, while simple and melds to the meals well since there isn't a strong dressing on it. \n\nThe point is, we left so amazingly joyful and thanked the owner about ten times.

Real crab meat stuffed enchiladas with rice and beans on the side.

It arrived in a medium-sized, deep bowl, filled half-way with a delicious spicy cheesy gray.  Along the sides of the bowl are shrimp, chicken, beef and scallops.

I noticed they had potato flautas on the second visit.  I used to love flautas when I ate meat and missed them when I went veg years ago.  I was stoked to finally find a place that served flautas stuffed with something other than meat.  They were good and topped with a very tasty guacamole. (I am sure that the meat ones are equally good if not better)  I look forward to trying the torta on the next visit.  (I returned for the torta a few days later and it is excellent as well.)\n\nI am happy to have stumbled onto this place.  There are a number of small Mexican restaurants on this stretch of McDowell and I have been wanting to try some of them for awhile.  La Hacienda is right on the corner of 16th and McDowell. It has a unassuming appearance on the outside, other than its windows splashed with daily specials.  The interior is pretty cool though.

The highly affordable, and seemingly endless choices between 'a-la carte' tacos and burritos, and combination dishes could be smelt cooking in the tucked away kitchen as we perused the menu. \n\nWe started with something to drink. I ordered the Apple Soda which is imported from Mexico and was absolutely AMAZING. I wasn't in the mood for an alcoholic beverage, but there was a variety of  bottled beers that I could see in the stand up cooler behind the cash-wrap for those wishing to imbibe. \n\nI ordered the Rolled Taco combination plate. I had three rolled tacos (basically chimichangas). They were filled with shredded chicken and deep-fried, then covered with cheese sauce, and lettuce. Rice and re-fried beans were served as sides, and a slice of avocado was the garnish.

It is very authentic, looks like a total dive from the outside, and it's in a Hispanic neighborhood. But, the tacos here are great! Now, just to be clear, these are street style tacos, they are small, but they are only $0.99/each, which seems pretty reasonable. \n\nI ordered an adobada, al pastor, carnitas, and a shredded beef with red chiles. Each were very good in their own unique ways, the meat was good quality and everything had the appropriate amounts of seasoning and flavor. The adobada was the standout in my mouth, so much that I had to go back and order another one! I also had a side of rice and beans, which were good, but nothing out of the ordinary. \n\nSo far so good, right? The only slip up this place maybe has, is that my girlfriend, that was with me, who doesn't eat meat, was not overly impressed. She got a bean and cheese burrito and a shrimp taco. The shrimp taco looked good, and she said everything tasted alright, but she was not wowed, like I was, about the quality of the tacos. She did enjoy the beans and rice though. So, this place might not be the best veg friendly location, but I'm not really going to take off for that, because it is very authentic, and veg friendly isn't necessarily what they are trying to do. They are trying to make good, traditional tacos, and that they do that very well. \n\nThey also serve beer here, and I love the way it's served. Your bottle or can is brought out with a mug that is frosted, salted, and has lime juice in the bottom. Speaking of bringing you the glass, the service is wonderful.

We were seated in the weird as can be bar area and were inundated with cheap looking hookers writhing around on a beach on the TVs.  Not the best accompaniment for Mexican food in my opinion.\n\nAnyway, I went off their new Mex and Match portion of the menu.  It's a great option for those of you who want to try more than one thing or aren't really sure what to get.  The options are all reasonably priced too, staying well under 10 bucks.  I got a cheese enchilada and a beef tamale with refried beans.  The tamale was very tasty and the beef inside was very good.  The enchilada, I was not too impressed.  The cheese was bland and there were lots of onions in it.  Eww.  The red sauce on top was pretty tame, even for a lightweight like me.\n\nHonestly, I won't be back.  I don't really care for Mexican food, but if I'm in the mood, I think I will go somewhere with a bit more flavor.", "business_id": "jzPMl-NoB5F2fwoHX3hN8A", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-09-25", "type": "review"}

Maybe the employees were angry and washing their dirty hands in the salsa buckets. Don't know, don't care.\n\nThe Macayo's on Central (of ugly Mayan-themed building and President-dining fame) is different. This is the Denny's of Mexican food - always good, always middle America, lots of screaming kids, lame attempts at kitsch. I find that takeout is a much safer way to indulge in the artery-hardening goodness Macayo's has to offer.\n\nThere are many, many much enjoyed references to dear God, as well as the Mother Mary and her revered child on Yelp. Well, if the sweet baby Jesus was ever to ejaculate, it might taste like Macayo's Baja sauce, and I mean that in the most flattering manner, i.e., SBJ might also spout forth with Cinnabon frosting. Baja sauce is this cream-cheese based, vaguely sweet, vaguely spicy green chili-tinted fatty goopy sauce that can be ladled on virtually any plain Jane item... thus turning water into wine, or some business like that. The green corn tamale slathered in Baja sauce is a most guilty pleasure that always leaves me feeling fulfilled, but slightly unsettled and a tick guilty mixed with a dash of naughty. It's the one-night stand of condiments, no doubt.\n\nSo on nights like these, where my weekend's diet has already been ravaged by Harlow's, Delux, and the pseudo-red velvet cupcakes I made at home (chocolate cake mix + red food coloring), I just gotta say WTF -- Macayo's takeout it is.", "business_id": "jzPMl-NoB5F2fwoHX3hN8A", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-11-08", "type": "review"}

The cantina actually looked a bit more lively but we still opted for the dining area. \n\nThe waitress was actually very friendly and well rehearsed if nothing else, can't complain there.

The meal was decent but I kept wondering why I can't have what I had from the menu at Chase? My girlfriend's side of rice also tasted funky, again the Chase rice was much better - what is going on here?!\n\nThe best part of my meal was actually the house margarita.

The one thing about this location that always made me want to try it was the shape of the building. \n\nIt always reminded me of one of the Mayan pyramids built in Mexico. Anyways when you first walk in they have the usual set up, bar on one side with a few tables and a full dining section for the dinner and lunch crowd. We were seated right away and given a quick run down of everything half off(happy hour pricing). The beer selection is pretty standard and the price for a pitcher was kind of high as well but my friend was happy with having it all for himself since I do not drink.\n\nThe bite size tamale bites were good and the Steak Cortez was great as well. The only thing I would recommend is going before or after happy hour as it can get really crowed and it is hard to find a place to sit unless you are just having lunch or dinner. Also it can be hard to enjoy a meal with the loud sounds of people screaming at the T.V. as the dining area is really close to the bar area. Other than that I suggest stopping in the next time you are in the area.

We were promptly seated at a table with plates, chips, and salsa but no napkins or utensils.\n\nLisa greeted us and took our drink orders. A considerable amount of time passed (all of the chips and salsa had been happily consumed) before Lisa returned with our drinks. Ten more minutes passed and we were left with empty chips/salsa bowls. During that time, we networked with other servers in an attempt to acquire napkins, utensils, and more chips/salsa.  \n\nGranted, we had a large party (eight adults, one kid, one toddler) and I can understand how busy working in the service field can be, but our drinks (which cost roughly $2.50 per drink) sat bone-dry for most of the time we were there. Even a pitcher of ice water at the table would have been helpful. \n\nI can forgive a lack of drinks, chips, and salsa but what truly irked me about our experience was when my grandfather's order was messed up.  The rest of us received our food (and ate it, for the most part, without any drinks) while my Grandfather, who would be footing the bill for his entire family, sat without any food, chips, salsa, or beverage and waited patiently for his order to be ready. Lisa even came back out a third time to verify his order. No one apologized to him, there was no offer to comp his meal - in fact, the incorrect order was still listed on the bill. \n\nDespite the way he was treated, my grandfather left a 20+ percent tip because that's just the kind of man he is - not because the service warranted it.\n\nAside from the recent one-star service, I can't pan the restaurant itself due to one bad experience. I've been there a few other times before and the service was excellent. (I wish I could remember the name of my prior server because he was top-notch.)  The food is traditional Mexican restaurant fare, but good. Their shredded beef tacos and cheese enchiladas are excellent. The Baja Burrito and Quesadilla are delicious too.

Not very busy on a Sunday afternoon around 4 PM...overpriced and certainly light-on-the-tequila margaritas...plenty of chips and salsa being delivered to the table...entrees that took WAY too long to be delivered...portion size and presentation leaving much to be desired...and the waiter kept our water glasses full.\n\nWould you be satisfied with an order of rolled tacos which list on the menu as coming topped with  guacamole?  When the cheese is sprinkled on so lightly that you can count the shred strands on each one?  When the guacamole is served in a 2-ounce solo cup on the side?  I think not!\n\nAnother in my party ordered a chicken soft taco and a bean and cheese burrito...the chicken was in shreds, like someone in the kitchen boiled breast, thighs and legs and subsequently shredded them with a fork.  The worst part was no seasoning...save for the salsa served with the chips.  The bean and cheese burrito was a study in rice...so much rice that it was difficult to find the beans and cheese in the burrito.\n\nThe fourth in our group ordered the nachos supreme.  The chips are advertised as coming smothered in beef or chicken (he chose beef),\ncheese, refried beans, tomatoes, sour cream and guacamole.  Again, the guacamole came on the side in a 2-ounce solo cup as well as the sour cream.  They were not requested on the side...but they came that way. \n\nAs I am in search of the best guacamole burrito on the planet, that is what I ordered...a burrito that is guacamole, sour cream, bacon, cheese and raw onion.  The burrito I received...got the guacamole...got the cheese...got the sour cream...missing the onion...and some really fatty bacon.  It has been a long time since I had a guacamole burrito that chewy.\n\nMargaritas were just a flat-out mistake.  I guess you have to know someone behind the bar to get much more than the faint whisper of a tequila bottle being passed in front of the glasses.  When they are delivered, they look incredible...the glasses filled perfectly...the salt on the rim done so well you could take a measuring tape to the glass and find perfect consistency all the way around.

My husband and I wanted to get a quick bite to eat for an early dinner. Since Del Taco is walking distance away, we figured we'd give it a go. What a mistake! \n\nFirst off, this location shares a building with a Shell Gas Station so the parking lot was a hot mess. We almost got run over just trying to get to the door. \n\nThe store had a sticky dirty feeling to it inside. We stood at the counter for a full five minutes before anyone acknowledged our existence. Finally, a man wearing a drive through headset took our order. He was very curt with us and rushed through the transaction. When I asked how big the large fountain drink was, he simply rang me up for a large drink instead.\n\nThe food was passable at best. We both opted for one of the epic burritos. More like mediocre burrito! The beans in mine are undercooked, the avocado was turning brown and the chicken was extremely bland. I'm not familiar with this chain, however, so maybe this is just par for the course. I'll give them a pass on the food.\n\nWhile we were trying to enjoy our meal, not one, not two but three different people came and asked my husband and I for money. Now I understand that this is Central Phoenix but this made for an uncomfortable dining atmosphere. \n\nAs we were leaving, I attempted to use their one and only bathroom before making the half mile walk back to the house. No such luck. I thought perhaps I needed a key to use the bathroom so I walked up to the counter. I made eye contact with the girl behind the counter, starting talking to her and she literally turned and walked away from me, and started playing on her phone. My jaw just about hit the floor! It's one thing to be too busy to take orders or help customers. It's another thing entirely to be so rude and unprofessional.

I have been in Phoenix for over a month now and have not eaten any GOOD Mexican food!  I was craving some tacos so I decided to try this spot out.  I was glad I drove down!\n\nI walked in and was told to sit wherever I wanted.  I grabbed a table and a nice lady came over to take my drink order and deliver some chips and salsa.  I placed my order for 2 beef tacos and a cheese quesadilla with green chiles in it.  I had a large Diet Coke to drink.  Here is how the food was...............\n\nChips and Salsa-  They bring you out a large basket of chips and a little thing of salsa.  I took a bite of a chip and had a flashback.  They reminded me of something.....I took another bite and then it hit me.  These chips tasted exactly like the chips at El Tarasco in Manhattan Beach.  That is definitely a good thing.  El Tarasco serves up whole fried tortillas.  Juans cuts them into chips but the taste was identical.  I was impressed!  The salsa was tasty too.  It was pretty mild and refreshing.  The chips were so good that I ate 2 baskets full!\n\nBeef Tacos-  I got 2 of these bad boys.  They are a bit small but they were awesome.  These also reminded me of somewhere from back home.......Titos Tacos!  Similar taste, texture and size.  Titos uses more cheese,  but other than that, they were pretty similar (Titos are a bit better but hey...Titos makes the best hard shell beef taco ever...no shame in never being as good as Titos).  The shredded beef was seasoned well, the shells were perfectly crispy. I would have liked a bit more cheese, but it was still enough the way they came out.  It was a fantastic beef taco!\n\nQuesadilla with Chiles-  When I bit into this, it ALSO reminded me of somewhere from CA....... Sombreros!  I would always get a beef taco and quesadilla combo at Sombreros.  This quesadilla was an exact replica!  It had nicely melted cheese, tons of green chiles and it was folded up into a nice flour tortilla.  I dipped this in the salsa and it was a winner!\n\nDiet Coke-  Nice to see they serve Coke products.\n\nTotal for my meal was $11.12.  Not too shabby for a grip of food.  I ate 3 different things and each one reminded me of some of my favorite Mexican food places from back in CA.  You simply cannot beat that!  Service was very friendly and it felt like you were eating in someones house kind of.  I can't wait to go back to try out some of their other offerings.  I can see this place becoming our families go to Mexican joint.  It's a bit of a drive from where I live (its way closer to work), but I was very impressed and will be back soon.

I never saw a cheese enchilada with cheese both outside and inside before--it was almost a mac 'n' cheese-style enchilada.  Rice and beans were actually better than a lot of places I've visited.  Pretty authentic style.  Chips and salsa were so good I ate WAY to many of them, and the sopapillas were primo.\n\nThe price was rock-bottom, and just incredible for all you can eat food.

Lunch should be $6 or at most $7.  \n\nAfter getting over my Scrooge-like reaction at the menu prices, I ordered the pollo con queso (shredded chicken covered with cheese and a spicy baja cream cheese suace).  It was heavenly as I remember it from years ago.  My dining companion chose the mushroom enchilada, which also was quite tasty.  \n\nI still hate the way they serve the salsa here, in tall narrow tumblers.  It's impossible to dip your chips in the salsa container (where is a damn bowl when you need one!) so I had to pour it onto my salad plate and scrape up the salsa from there.  Overall, the salsa is only average.  It needs more kick and this is a big issue for Mexican restaurants in my head.  \n\nYou do end up with large portions, but I'd like to see them pare down the portion sizes and the prices accordingly.  Two for lunch cost as much as three for dinner the other night at Juan's on Thomas and 16th Street.  That's not right.  \n\nSo, overall Ajo Al's gets a B for food quality but a D for prices.

We arrived about an hour after they did, and they were finished when we got there.\n I ordered a stuffed poblano chili dish and it really was not good at all. Bad enough that the food was bad, but when we were ready to leave, we asked the waitress for our check, so she gives us a check for the whole table.\n My wife said, \"No-we want our check only\" and the waitress said that they do not do seperate checks, which is B.S. because we always have gotten seperate checks at the Arriba's in Arrowhead. This created a big hassle for us because we never carry cash, so my wife had to pay back one of her friends for our share of the bill the following week.\n This is no way to conduct a business, and I also sent the main office an email telling them about what had happened, but they never answered the email. I guess customer satisfaction means nothing to them, so we will NEVER go back! \n\n Anyplace can roast chilis, so thats nothing special for Arriba's.\n\n Macayos is the place from now on, and the food there is superior to Arriba's.", "business_id": "ib-y5nsfn3unE0lLY1vfAw", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-09-06", "type": "review"}

So, you can taste four appetizers and enjoy tasting your favorites or finding new ones and not spend lots of money just getting full on one thing.\n\nThey say the Rokerij basement is a cell-free zone. That's because as you descend each slate/rock step downwards, right off the wood front deck, the signal mostly won't go through!

Its a great setup and well done environment. The setting is stylish and dark so you want to sink into a booth and get down to eating some food.\n\nUnfortunately my first experience has left an impression that is less than stellar. My girlfriend and I had been wanting to try it out a few times. We got a booth by the fireplace and settled in for a nice meal.\n\nThe specials are written up in chalk on the wall as you walk in which is a great method for displaying specials. We are both vegetarians that will eat fish and were excited by the plethora of fish dish choices on the specials board. This tends to say that a place can do fish.\n\nOur server was nice enough but when we asked for some recommendations he stared at us blankly and grabbed the menu like he hadnt eaten there in a while. This is a huge pet peeve for me. If a place is gonna charge $20 or more for an entree the staff better be trained on the dishes and be ready to give some recommendations. Show some passion and knowledge and sell me the good stuff.\n\nWe ordered the White Bean Bruschetta to start. It was edible but lacking in flavor, maybe some salt wouldnt have hurt, but something more than just beans and toast please.\n\nNext was the soup of the day which had a lot of smoke flavor going on, not impressed.\n\nFinally we went with the sesame crusted fish with a melon salsa. This dish started off a disaster and just got worse. First of all the server brings it over holding it with a towel. As We shift plates around to make room he starts yelping a bit in pain. Not a great sign. Once he gets it set down we move to dig in but my lovely date brushes her arm on the plate and comes away with a pretty solid burn.\n\nThis is just plain stupid. There is no need for a plate to be 200 degrees. Cook the food and then bring it out. Dont cook it at my table on the plate!\n\nUnfortunately the fish was not edible, at all. The melon salsa was horrid. We sent it back and still got charged.\n\nRokerij I want to love you.

This downstairs bar area of the restaurant has a taverny-old world-European feel to it.  It is usually crowded, but despite the crowd, the atmosphere still feels fairly intimate.  They have a decent wine list with friendly bartenders.  I enjoyed a nice Malbec which seems to be hard to come by here in Phoenix.  This is a great place to relax with a couple of friends or a casual date, but not a good place for large groups.\n\nAs for the upstairs dining room...I was not impressed.  The restaurant attempts to keep a similar theme from the downstairs, but in a more fine dining way.  It doesn't really work.  I am a small person and the booths swallowed me up because they are so huge.  The booths have pillows but there is just something weird about sitting on a pillow to reach the table.  I felt like a child but not in a good way.\n\nOur server was great, she was new, but she did a great job.  I can imagine we would have stressed her out a bit more had we been more high maintenance.  The food, well, did not live up to its glory.  Let's just say I wasn't in a hurry to finish my food or willing to take anything home with me.  The food just missed something and was over powered by one particular sauce that left a terrible aftertaste.  \n\nTo sum things up, check out the basement but avoid the dining room, the whole fine-dining thing is completely overrated.", "business_id": "5kRug3bEienrpovtPRVVwg", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-11-03", "type": "review"}

The parking lot was full, so I started to get scared that we wouldn't be able to get a table or have to *gasp* wait for one.\nAt first, we had gone downstairs to eat there, but it was packed, so we headed to the restaurant.  From previous reviews, I was afraid it would be packed and we would have to find somewhere else to go eat.  I really wanted to impress the guy (HA even though he was buying!) and, luckily, there were a few empty tables upstairs.\nWe were seated at the far end in a corner booth.  Any restaurants with booths get an A+ in my book.  I love sitting close to friends and a booth gives the perfect opportunity.\nSpecials were neatly written on blackboards, but I was at a weird angle to read them.  Chris, our waiter, read them for us and explained each dish.  That was the high point of his service the rest of the night.\nAs we perused the menu, our drink order was taken.  I really wanted to get the small plates and try a few different things, so we both chose 3 each.  I got the crab tostadas.  They were filled to the brim with crab, not too much dressing so the crab flavor wasn't drowned.  I also got the bacon-wrapped grilled shrimp (YUMMY!!!!) and the brie toasts.  Divine!  The cheese was melted perfectly, with just enough of its grease to soak into the bread.  I actually licked my fingers after each one.\nHe got the skewered steak, shrimp on dirty rice and meat tacos.  The rice wasn't all that, but the rest of the dishes were superb!\nAs we ate, and our drinks emptied, we had to call Chris over to get refills.  Not once had he checked on us during the meal.

Upstairs, you'll find an upscale version of what Richardson's was before it burned. Hardwood floors, adobe circular booths, wine cellar walls, another bar, and a beautiful fire make it a very intriguging dining room. They are users of Pandora Radio, so they have all sorts of variety playing over the airwaves. \n\nThe food is fantastic. Some of the highlights are the Rokerij Benedict, an english muffin topped with tenderloin, crab, egg, and jalapeno hollandaise. Try the Surf & Turf if you are truly hungry which is a couple of bacon wrapped shrimp, a crab enchilada, and a tenderloin. Both dishes are incredible, but perhaps not as much as some of the small plates you'll find, like the tenderloin toasts, topped with double creme brie, or the ubiquitous roasted garlic plate. Currently, they are also serving Richardson's menu, and in addition to the dozen or so specials on the chalk board nightly, one could dine here every day for a month and never have a duplicate meal. \n\nRokerij is a true neighborhood hangout with unique food, friendly people, and an atmosphere you cannot find elsewhere.", "business_id": "5kRug3bEienrpovtPRVVwg", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-11-14", "type": "review"}

Sooo.. that being said, I really like this restaurant.  Can I tell you tho that I ONLY go downstairs to eat.  Waaay cooler.  Stairs are a little tricky down... kinda thinkin that they are not up to code and an accident waiting to happen...maybe I could get a free meal?  Hmm.. ok, back to the restaurant.  The downstairs bar is a funky copper and there are 2 seats in front of the big fireplace (I never get the chance to sit there darn it) and all the seating in the restaurant (upstairs and down)is booth.  Love that.  Much more cozy.   Their wine selection is pretty good.  I pretty much have the Klinker Brick red all the time.  My fave dish there is their cornflake crusted halibut w/ salsa.  Deelish!  And their corn side is amazing.. roasted corn and the main man and I were stabbing each other over it.  He always has the mashed potatoes as a side and they come in this little kettle that is super hot. Just warnin you.  I am not much of a potato person but he says that they are good so I will have to take his word.  I even like their house salad.. has chunks of bleu cheese and if I remember right, cranberries.  Btw, Rokerij, you used to have spiced pecans in the salad too but they are gone.  I have a very sad face right now .  \nSooo.. that's what I think.. the Rokerij is  a great date place (but only plan on bringing someone you are really into otherwise later when you break up you may have an embarrassing encounter there) and perfect for the holidays!", "business_id": "5kRug3bEienrpovtPRVVwg", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-11-22", "type": "review"}

My hubby & I met my parents there at 6:30pm this past Sunday. I was kinda bummed we didn't eat down stairs but the main dinning room was very cool so I wasn't too disappointed. Even though we had reservations, we had to wait about 15 minutes for a table. Once seated, we had a big, comfy booth with throw pillows, next to the fire place. & I know some people don't care for it but I loved the dim lighting! \n\nFor starters we ordered the beef tenderloin toasts & calamari. The calamari was good but I didn't like the dipping sauce. It was too sweet, I prefer cocktail sauce. I'm pretty sure I said the beef toasts, not brie, but she brought out the brie. Still delicious but would have loved to try it with the beef. I would have said something but the service was so slow & our server disappeared for 10-20 minutes at a time. She seemed...high...on life maybe? Hmmm... \n\nAny way, for our entrees: my mom ordered the chimayo chicken (Richardson's menu), my dad the prime rib (Rokerij menu), my hubby the garlic shrimp pasta (Richardson's menu) & I ordered one of the specials-a trio of fish: salmon, mahi mahi & swordfish. For sides: 2 meals came with a salad, 3 meals came with their famous green chile potato, 2 meals opted for asparagus & 1 opted for zucchini. My mom did not like her chicken at all but loved the salad & asparagus that came with. My dad liked how rare his steak was cooked but said the horseradish sauce on top ruined the taste for him, loved his zucchini though. My hubby loved his garlic shrimp pasta & salad. I loved my trio of fish & asparagus, so yummy! Those of us who got the GCP did not really care for it, we must be a group of wimps because we found it to be too spicy. Very creative side dish though! \n\nOur total came to about $185, not including tip. We did have about 5-6 cocktails, plus 2 apps & 4 entrees.

Rokerij like everyone on here prob. explains has their own full menu + Richardson's menu.  Both menus are amazing in their own right also side note according to the server in just over a month Richardson's will be reopened directly next door, so look for that to finally happen.  Things I love about this place?  The atmosphere is amazing upstairs and down (downstairs is a underground cellar like bar, super cool i posted a picture a while back they serve a full menu as well), you really have to see it to understand how cool it is!  Taking in the restaurant from the outside is kinda strange its really closed in looking (no windows which is normally ok.. if your at a strip club) but once your inside its really calming and pleasant.  Now that you feel comfortable inside we can talk about the food which is equally as amazing.  Richardson's menu is heavy on the garlic so if its not a 1st date go nuts because its worth it, actually F it if she doesn't like you because you like good food then drop her/him.  The Rokerij menu is less heavy on the Mexican food side, its more Americanized burgers, steaks, fish.  I had the mahi-mahi with pineapple salsa and it rocked my taste buds(in the most positive of ways), the fish was cooked perfectly as well as blackened, I recently had eaten fish in San Diego as well as New Zealand and this fish was just as good if not better quality, very impressive.  Another thing they do is cool is you can get these \"small plates\" 1 for 9 or 2 for 17, it goes on its basically a bunch of tapas like tacos, ahi tuna, prime rib sliders, scallops, steak tartare, etc.  I love tapas and for social settings its a great and delicious idea.  Overall 4 stars for now because i need to eat more items off that tapas menu to upgrade this review, something im looking forward to taking advantage of next time", "business_id": "5kRug3bEienrpovtPRVVwg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-09-15", "type": "review"}

We were happy to learn that it was half priced wine bottles (Sundays and Mondays), so naturally we had 4 bottles on a Monday night :)  \n\nWe had 3 small plates to start the meal - the calamari, quesadillas and ceviche.  All were very good.  I could eat the quesadillas all day every day!  The ceviche has an interesting flavor, almost like cinnamon.  It wasn't my favorite ceviche in town, but I did enjoy it.  \n\nEveryone ordered something different.  Skewers, New Mexican Platter, Swordfish Special, Halibut Special, Surf & turf, Steak Skewers, Chicken Skewers, and I can't remember the last meal.  Everyone was very happy with their food. We did have a small hiccup with the chicken on the skewers not being totally done, but our server was very apologetic and offered to bring back some properly cooked chicken.  But he was already full so he declined.  They took the whole skewer meal off the bill without us asking or even putting up a fuss about it. I loved the surf & turf, perfectly cooked and the shrimp was wrapped in bacon - yum!\n\nWe also had a couple of desserts - the flourless chocolate cake, which was a delicious fudge cake that we devoured ... and the creme brulee, which they brought with a lit candle for the birthdays we were celebrating.  My husband prefers his creme brulee custard a little more firm, but i thought it was perfect!  So I ate most of it  :)\n\nI think our server was new because he seemed to have a shadow most of the evening.  But he did a great job, was very personable, and if I was smart enough to find out his name, I would love to sit in his section again.\n\nThey never seem to hurt for business, yet they still manage to make you feel like they want you to come back again and again!

Our neighbor recommended Richardson's/Rokerij as his favorite so I made a reservation for Monday night.\n\nWe sat in their downstairs dining room tucked in a generous booth in the back corner. My fianc\u00e9 ordered a Dark and Stormy and we split a bottle of Pinot Noir as our server informed us of their 1/2 price bottles of wine deal. Hurrah! We ordered 2 appetizers: the bacon-wrapped scallops and the crab-stuffed mushrooms. One bite of the scallops and we were in heaven. They were GIANT, perfectly cooked, and beautifully placed in a pool of amazingly different dipping sauces. You can never go wrong with wrapping bacon on a piece of, well, anything, but this appetizer was magical.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 ordered the Rokerij Steak with roasted corn and mashed sweet potatoes in a chili pepper.

I ordered the Swordfish special with roasted eggplant and mashed sweet potatoes in the chili pepper as well, and I devoured every bite! \n\nWhat did it for me, however, was the dessert.

I called Soraya who was in route to ask if she had made reservations.. hmm nope. Crap. So when she arrives, I sucker her into going downstairs since everyone that went down, came right back up. Lo and behold there were two seats at the bar. Hmm interesting that no one saw that lol. We hoisted ourselves up and was immediately greeted by Werner as well as the rest of the bar staff. We ordered our wine a bottle of the cupcake wine, which was delicious and it was half off seeing as it was Monday :). We also ordered the prime rib sliders, brie toasts, and the tacos. The people next to us had commented on how hot the tacos were and was wondering if we could handle the heat as they said they couldn't. Don't get me wrong, they were spicy, but I make things way spicier so I was use to it. Soraya well not so much lol.\n\nThe tacos, sliders, and brie toasts were so good, The prime rib was cooked perfectly and the au jus to dip it in was num yummy.

On Wednesday at 8:30pm it was packed, which is a good sign!  We were greeted right away and were taken downstairs to their cozy basement (or cellar I should say).  It is very inviting with wooden ceilings and rafters with alluring stone fireplaces and leather lounge chairs.  I felt like I should be drinking scotch or bourbon down there!  We were seated by our waiter who was quite charming considering the full bar of people chattering away.  I should also note, we were placed in a great spot in the corner where you could observe the busy room or simply enjoy your company as if we were in a room to ourselves.  \n\nWe ordered two glasses of wine, and the Mushroom Brie Toast to start.  The toast was pretty unique and tasty, with a variety of mushrooms piled on perfectly toasted French bread with the perfect amount of cheese laced atop. For an entree I ordered the Ahi Tuna Salad with a soy vinaigrette.  It was good, with a healthy portion of perfectly cooked ahi, but the salad was kind of boring to me (mixed greens and tomatoes).  The vinaigrette was a bit on the soy-y side for me too...Yes I know that is what the dressing is called; I just expected something a bit more exciting and less salty.  \n\nMy date had the NY strip.  It was prepared to temperature and covered in mushrooms, which we probably should have thought of pairing with and alternate appetizer...I think he had his fill of mushrooms for a month hahah!  But it was good nonetheless.  The asparagus was was gone first, so I am assuming it was delicious and the mashed potatoes (came in a little pot on the side) were just kind of boring.

This prompted the manager to inform me it was a spicy dish to which I accepted and said it was fine, he proceeded to inform me of the heat of the dish 2 more times both times I assured him this was fine leading him to question my order again at which time I was in disbelief and asked if there is some reason he doesn't want me to  have the dish..   this was enough to finally agree to let me place the order the soup came and was excellent and spicy.

Completely underground and secluded from the chaotic world above.  We had a drink and went on our way to Richardson's next door which was also amazing, but that's a whole other review.  My second experience was when my best friend and I planned our birthday dinner with our guys.  She made our reservations and requested one of the booths, which we were accomodated with.  Our server was great, she was friendly and very attentive.  We ordered chicken skewers as our appetizer, I had the chicken schnitzel, my best friend had the pork adobada, and the guys both ordered the prime rib.  All were delicious!

Our server David was fantastic, and even though we were seated at the bar for dinner, the level of attentiveness was super. Knowing that we had never eaten at Rokerij, David took the time to explain the menu in detail and made recommendations.\n\nRokerij has quite the wine and beer list, however I opted for one of the specialty cocktails listed on the board. It was a double berry martini. I guess I was thinking double berry meant double the berries but it actually meant double vodka (I am a rookie, what can I say?)and was far too strong for a girl who likes her alcohol embedded in a concoction that tastes yummy. David must have seen I was struggling to drink this so he very kindly got a tall glass with ice and added some lemonade and then poured my \"vodka surprise\" on in. Yay! It was much more suitable and I was able to enjoy. :)\n\nI ordered a sirloin steak with roasted corn and their signature potato baked into a green chile. The potato was cold but it tasted good and definitely had a kick. My friend ordered the enchiladas (one steak, one chicken, one shrimp) and loved their dish.\n\nI would definitely go back and try out some of their other dishes, There was so much that looked and sounded good.

How-EVA, our experience was not fabulous. It was more like DRAB-ulous. Things started out great when we snagged a cozy little table in the corner about 9pm on a Friday night. The liquor wall looked too tempting to pass up, so I ordered a Gibson with some Tito's vodka (my fav!)- well the cocktail onions were soggy and mushy upon first bite and it pretty much ruined the drink. The server did not offer to bring me something different, he just apologized and looked for the jar of onions and said they are all like that. Hmmmm. There were a MILLION specials. It took like 5 minutes literally to read the entire list. It was baffling. The prices are NOT cheap. We were already thinking we should give this place a shot during $5 plate happy hour. Anyway then we ordered some grilled oysters. Well, they came out with Chirozo on them- and I barely eat seafood, but definitely not pork! All the server said was \"Well it listed the chorizo on the menu\"- Hmmmmmm. Again, we just kept them. Then my boyfriend tried one and it was full of sand! At this point, we had already ordered the mushroom toast points, but after the oyster debacle, we had pretty much decided to go elsewhere and especially when the next appetizer came, it just was overloaded with brie and canned looking mushrooms, totally overcooked and unappetizing. We politely told the server that we were just going to call it a night (there was NO WAY we were going to spend 35-40 bucks on the entree lottery)- he then offered to \"do anything\" to make our experience better and we thanked him and just explained why we were leaving and we would be back to try the happy hour another time (truth). Anyway then he took like 15 minutes at least trying to get the manager to take the oysters off (I would rather have paid for them) and then he FINALLY brought us our bill with the two drinks AND the uneaten mushroom appetizer. I am a foodie and have been in the business since I was 15 and I NEVER EVER want anything for free or removed from my check, however, there are certain circumstances- and I must say I can not remember having a completely horrible experience like this one on a long time- where I feel  that as a server, let alone a manager- I would comp the entire tab and offer to have the guest back on some sort of gift certificate or comp.  Again, I NEVER EVER look for anything free in a restaurant, but if you had been sitting in my shoes last night, you would agree this experience warranted some above and beyond customer service to retain guests in the future. Well that didn't happen, perhaps they have been around so long they just figure oh well who cares, we are well known so whatever. Well, whatever is I will NEVER attend that restaurant or any of their other concepts, plus now I have written a poor review, and all my FB friends know about it too. I'm sure in my life moving forward Rokerij will also come up in conversation with some of my foodie friends and they too will know I think this place is overrated. We left the waiter a very nice tip and thanked them by never attending their establishment again. Such a shame. Customer service is dead these days...

Somehow - magically - the space is designed to feel intimate. Cozy. But the space meanders around. (The booths have room to seat parties of four to six, depending on the side of the fireplace you're gazing at.)\n\nDates would be impressed. As would a business partner or your girlfriends. The hushed tones of the dark room encourage whispered conversation. The food and wine has always been impeccably delivered. \n\nThe Oysters - just stop. Whatever you're doing can wait. Go. I promise you, your palate will enjoy the menu. I have a few photos up of sliders, scallops wrapped in bacon and artichoke dip. But that is an injustice. Rokerij offers a robust menu.\n\nHappy hour is quite generous. If you're not sure pay attention: Happy hour is *every day* until 6pm. (Reverse HH is 10pm to midnight.) Alas, the true secrets of happy hour are best revealed by calling in. They change often and may not make it to Facebook or their website in time. Visit often and you'll know the inside scoop!\n\nCurrently... Wonderful, hearty glasses of wine are poured for 1/2 the normal price. All appetizers are $2-3 off a plate. But you *must* sit at the bar.\n\nThe bartenders are well versed in their product knowledge. The table staff are stunning. Visiting here is like visiting dear, close friends. Special note: The space is ADA accessible. \n\nParking is valet. \n\nThanks Rokerij!", "business_id": "5kRug3bEienrpovtPRVVwg", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-11-30", "type": "review"}

I was able to get a last minute reservation at 8pm for our anniversary and that was more than gracious. Friends of mine have been talking about this place for years and I finally got the opportunity to try it out first hand. \n\nWhen we arrived there was complimentary valet which was awesome.  Never having been here before it took a little asking around to find the downstairs bar where we had our reservation.  The hostess was super nice and helpful and told us our table wasn't ready yet but that the bartenders would know we were waiting.  \n\nThe stairway down to the bar is fun,  yeah that sounds silly but it's cool. The downstairs bar ambience is sexy to say the least, including a fireplace:)  It's small yet welcoming and very warm.  We took a seat on the couch and one of the bartenders came by to get our drink order and informed us that he knew we were waiting for a table and that he would take care of us all night.  That he did. \n\nWe were informed our table would be a little late because the people were still sitting around a bit. No worries, we were all about taking it slow and enjoying ourselves. Once we were sat, our server came by and gave us a very informed, detailed explaination of the specials,  and honestly EVERYTHING sounded amazing.  Granted we usually eat dinner around 7pm and at this point it was around 8:20 ish. We were hungry:)\n\nOrders were placed and wine was enjoyed, and then we waited. A very long time.  Once our food finally came around I was pretty damn unhappy.  Our server himself told us that our ticket time was 50 minutes!  Apparently a 40 top came in and their food was a priority over the few smaller tables.  Almost an hour after ordering we finally got our food and I could definitely tell our food was an afterthought. It tasted good,  not amazing,  and was barely just warm enough.  Couldn't tell if it had been sitting around or was thrown together half assed. Our server did the best he could but not once did a manager come by to apologize for the food issue. \n\nThey comp'ed us 2 drinks and gave us a free dessert. I dunno,  I just left with a bad taste in my mouth.  Definitely not an anniversary dinner I feel proud about bringing my husband to. That's frustrating. \n\nLike I said,  ambience/drinks and service were top notch. The kitchen and management really fell through on this tonight. First and probably the last time I'll come here.  \n\nWhat a shame.", "business_id": "5kRug3bEienrpovtPRVVwg", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-11-22", "type": "review"}

The one other thing that kept me from giving a 5 star review is the music down there was a bit loud for folks to have a regular audible conversation.

I just won't order one anywhere else, it won't measure up.  El Pollo Loco's grilled chicken is phenomenal, as are their salsas, and Sonora Mesquite Grill has the most amazing Carne Asada I've ever had the pleasure of putting in my mouth, so I'm covered there also. Now, you may be thinking to yourself \"This girl really has it figured it. What void in her life could Rubio's possible fill that she has to add it to an already stellar line up of very well thought out and eloquently presented Mexican casual dining options?\"  To that I say: Fish Tacos.\n\nI'm not saying that Rubio's has the best Fish Tacos in the world. I may be an expert on a lot of things, but sadly Fish Tacos isn't one of them. But Rubios' are good, and their tomatillo salsa is tasty and, as previously mentioned, they carry Coke Zero which is just so ridiculously head and shoulders above Diet Coke I'm surprised its market hasn't been completely cannibalized by now. I guess some people just enjoy barely-carbonated cola beverages that have the aftertaste of battery acid. But I digress.\n\nI'm going to let you guys in on a little secret: Chicken Balsamic and Roasted Veggie Salad.  Grilled chicken (not El Pollo Loco quality, but it's fair), avocado, and roasted veggies over lettuce with a tangy balsamic dressing. A good portion as long as you're not famished, and really quite tasty. Here's the secret: 310 Calories. For the whole thing, none of that \"without dressing, avocado, chicken, or anything that tastes good\" bull (I'm looking at you Subway).  I like to dip the chicken in tomatillo salsa, which might add like 5 calories to the deal, but I'm okay with it because I'm still saving about 400 calories which can now be put towards a more noble purpose: Booze!

He stared back at me with no emotion.\n \nI turned to the counter guy and said, I really don't want to take the boxes if they put stuff on it.  He says, I don't see that they put anything on it.

I heart the namesake mesquite broiled chicken. A  1/2 chicken + rice + ranchero beans + tortillas (corn or flour, your choice) + cabbage salad is $5.99.  Add in the FREE (yes, I said free and unlimited) chips & salsa and you're set!  The chips are not only free & umlimited -- there's an entire chips & salsa bar/buffet with like 4 kinds of chilled conidments including a delightful salsa fresca & my fave salsa (not sure what it';s called) that's like pulverized tomatatillos & it's super peppery.  They also have that curious carrot/pepper blend that's often found in SoCal & AZ.\n\nChuy's embodies SoCal/baja California cuisine -- right here in the desert.  They are a chain, not like McDo's -- with ~17 locations in AZ & 10 locations in Cali.  Each location is a little unique. I've been to about 3 of them in AZ and the food is consistently nom-nom-nom-a-licious and CHEAP.  I've been for drinks as well and the beers are cold & plentiful.  \n\nI like the Indian School location b/c, well, it's close to me and the patio is awesome for al fresco dining and smoking is permitted out-of-doors, natch.  The staff is typically young, friendly ladies and I have  anew fan at the Ind.School location -- she freaked out (in a good way) when she saw my J\u00e4ger tattoo and told me I'm her new fave customer.  Nice!\n\nThe crowd tends to be baby boomer stoner & surfer types & younger folks looking to dine/drink on the cheap, but it's never rowdy and usually people are very friendly and oddly communal for a restaurant.  There is a sense of community around dining at Chuy's -- almost like the OG's slogan \"when you're here -- you're family\" -- it's like, \"when you're here  -- you're Chuy'n\".  (OK, I know that was bad, but I had too...)\n\nThe downsides: (if this is a downside to you) you serve yourself on the chips & salsa (buffets do NOT bother me) and you bus your own plates & cups after eating.  Big whoop.  Clean up after yourself -- it'll make your mama proud!  Also, the tables can be SLIGHTLY sticky at times...but randomly.  Everything else is top notch, so I give them 4 stars.\n\nAll in all, for the value, the amount of food and the friendly, welcoming atmosphere, Chuy's gets my vote!", "business_id": "7UTlEVHU5v2xBLdkGghyzQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-11-11", "type": "review"}

The menu was a dizzying selection of Mexican seafood that was almost overwhelming.  She brought us some chips and salsa, they were tasty, but the chips would have been even more delicious if they been served warm.  I liked the salsa, it was a brownish, low heat salsa that I've never had before.  It was pleasant.\n\nI ordered the shrimp chevice tostada and since he's allergic to shellfish (the poor bastard) the husband had the cheese enchiladas.  We also ordered a side of rice for the baby.  \n\nMy tostadas were okay, but they were store bought tostadas (because deep frying a fresh corn tortilla for each new diner is too much work?) and the shrimp chevice was way too limey (the overwhelming flavor) and not nearly spicy enough.  I would have preferred a few thinly sliced jalapenos and maybe some more cilantro in the mixture.\n\nThe red sauce on my husband's enchiladas looked watery and artificial and just like canned tomato sauce.  It didn't look very authentic, or good, BUT he swore it tasted okay.  (His tummy was also feeling a tad funny the rest of the day, but that could have been from almost anything else too.)\n\nThe baby's rice was nice.  It was served with peas, carrots, green beans and corn and it tasted quite good.  Also, the waitress served the baby first and gave her a plastic spoon which was thoughtful.  I suspect the waitress is also a mommy and that's why she got the baby's food out first and knew to give her a plastic spoon... ;)\n\n\nOur bill for 2 iced teas, 2 shrimp chevice tostadas, cheese enchiladas and a side of rice was about $23.00.

I needed more, pronto!  I drove down here because of the good reviews on Yelp.  I was happy I took the drive.\n\nThey start you out with some chips and salsa.  I then ordered the \"Don Jose Special\" which consists of a beef tamale, cheese enchilada, bean tostada, beef taco, rice or beans and corn or flour tortillas.  This special came with a drink too.  Total was $11.00.  Here is how everything was..............\n\nChips and salsa-  This was the only thing that I was not truly impressed with.  The chips were nice and thin but they weren't even warm and they weren't salted either.  The salsa that they serve is more of a puree.  No chunks in it.  They both tasted just ok. I've had much better elsewhere although I can think of some places that are worse too.\n\nBeef Tamale-  This was a large tamale stuffed with shredded beef/machaca.  It was covered in red sauce and was pretty hefty in size.  It was a little dry, but the beef was flavored well and the sauce tasted pretty good.\n\nCheese Enchilada-  I am usually not the biggest fan of enchiladas but this one was great!  Plain and to the point.  Lots of cheese, and lots of onions which I love.  This thing was also covered in their red sauce.  It was really good!\n\nBean Tostada-  Simple and to the point.  Beans, lettuce, cheese on top of a fried tortilla shell.  I like how it held up and was still crispy/crunchy even though I ate it awhile after it came to the table.  It was a good tostada!\n\nBeef Taco-  A little bit small but packed with flavor.  It reminded me of a Lolitas beef taco, just smaller in size.  The beef was seasoned well and they topped this with a lot of cheese.  I was pretty impressed!\n\nDiet Coke- Coke products which is awesome.  The only bad thing about the drink was the size of the cup it was served in.  Couldn't have been more than 8 ounces.  It was like a tiny orange juice glass.  Free refills at least.\n\nService was friendly and to the point.  Their a la carte prices on things seemed a bit high so I won't be rushing back to try out other things.  If in the area again, and craving Mexican food, there will be no hesitation to come back though.  Everything was pretty darn tasty and the combo plate was priced well for the sheer amount of food you receive. \n \nCash only!", "business_id": "uevPN8zwJpBpnxRur1jUhw", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-10-05", "type": "review"}

WHY?!\n\nWe entered and were seated right away in a HUGE dining area \"upstairs\" that was way cute back in 1990 when it was last redecorated - but this isn't 1990 and it's - kitchy. After I sat down and saw the plain looking laminated menu, I realized that my mom and I were the ONLY brown people in the building besides a bus boy who looked afraid of his own shadow! Red Flag #3!!\n\nOur waiter Nathan introduced himself and seemed really nice as he brought our chips and salsa and took our drink order. We also ordered our food - I had the #13 - A Little Bit of Everything and my mom had the Veggie Fajitas. I must say that the menu is very uninspired and I wished to see some house specialties or innovation... inspiration and innovation are luxaries that Carlos O'brien can't afford. \n\nWhie our food was being prepared, we enjoyed our chips and salsa which was VERY good, I must say! I SWEAR I've had their salsa before, I just can't place it! But it's still good and worth the trip alone. Our food came quickly and we were disappointed by the fact that my mom's fajitas lacked any soul, had some spice and weren't sizzling off the iron. Boo! She loved that her fajitas had ingredients not normally seen in fajitas, such as potatos and zucchini. \n\nMy plate was a big glob of gooey cheese! The guac on the chicken flautas were good however the flautas were a little over cooked. The Chimis were very good and I loved their cream cheesy sour cream type sauce - I just they didn't give me so much of it! I was scraping it off after my first bite. With a good chili kick and plenty of salt, my Green Corn tamales were DEFINATLY the best part of my meal! \n\nAnd the toastada, rice and especially the beans were the lowlight of my meal. I never had a worse toastada, I don't even know how to you screw up a toastada - but leave it up to Carlos to figure it out. The rice tasted old and were dry. The beans also tasted old and had too much cheese, there was so much cheese that my lil bowl of beans was practically glued to my plate! GROSS! \n\nWe were still happy and eating away and I didn't think we were taking too long when Nathan our waiter gave us the bum's rush! He put down our check andd Offered to bring us to-go boxes when we were still happily eating and showed no signs of slowing down. I was like - there are FOUR tables seat in a 30+ table facility - there's NO ONE at the door, even then - you got the room!! Why are you rushing us out?! We requested two to-go boxes and when he returned with them he seemed disappointed in the fact that we hadden't paid yet. My mom quickly dropped her debt card and I was annoyed.\n\nWe did need to get going - we had another errand to run before heading home but still. The polite thing to do would have been to leave our check and tell us to take our time, replenish our drinks and WAIT for us to ask for a box. GEEZ! Some people's children!\n\nTo my fellow yelpers, if you want fresh, sizziling sexy Mexican food - avoid this place like the plauge. If you want to appease out-of-town relatives with sensitive palates to a nice Arizona Mexican dinner - this is the place for you! Have the green tamales and enjoy the chips with salsa, they're both quite good.", "business_id": "ieYiA4L5gk7S3kZYK0l_dg", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-10-21", "type": "review"}

The waiter was courteous and zipped back to get me my correct order, but came back a mere ten seconds later with a cold burrito. Really? I know I've already waited, but at least give it to me warm.\n\nAll in all, the server generally ignored us because the table to our left was angry they weren't getting any food, and the table to the right of us had a solid 30 people in it. So, I get it in a sense. But it would've been nice to have them tell us straight out that they had a 46 person table on the other side of the restuarant that just ordered, and that the giant party to our right hadn't gotten their food yet either.

Let's start with the chips & salsa because that's really what melts my butter. Perfection! chips were thin, crispy, hot. The salsa was the perfect consistency, not the Hot Ketchup variety & none of that we opened a jar of Pace Picante, hahaha these stupid gringos!  I mean, honestly, my Mexican food standards are not that demanding. Give me the same quality I could make at home without having to drag out my food processor & I'm your best friend. \n\nRice & beans were good, typical, but good. Tortillas are exactly like my grandma's, probably full of lard (sorry if they're not but I don't see this place making the Jenny Craig hitlist anyway). And lard is necessary to build your quality cellulite. That, and butter slathered on the lard laden tortillas; now the clouds have parted. \n\nI ordered the chile relleno plate and the chile relleno was very satisfactory - the batter could be a tad flufflier but, hey, who's measuring. On another visit, I ordered the chicken taco. The chicken was moist & shredded, very good. are the hard shells handmade? I detected a slight comparison to Lawry's but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. I love the shredded lettuce on everything. It's very Baja & makes me feel a little better about the fact that I've completed reversed the effects of 4 hours of Insanity Workout. \n\nThe person who complained about the service should go to Macayo's or Arriba's (excuse me as I hork all over my keyboard). Ok, better now. if you are looking more streamlined, corporate, dining process, these places will be little gems for you.

Los Reyes de la Torta and El Bravo in the same neighborhood.  It's like a dream come true.  \n\nEl Bravo has been on my list for a while now, and I finally made it a few weeks ago.  The typical \"not much to look at from the outside\" place, but I found the inside to be, dare I say, charming with it's colorful walls and mural.  Seat yourself and the wait is not long for chips and salsa.  The salsa was mild, but tasted fresh.  The hot sauce in the ever so popular in Arizona squirt bottle was a little hotter with good strong oregano flavor.  Yes, they do charge for chips, but it's a buck.  Nothing to get bent about, and the rest of the menu is priced affordably.\n\nTo maximize my sampling pleasure, I ordered a 3-way burro so that I could try both the red chile and green chile (both made with beef), beans, and tortillas without ordering too much.  Pretty resourceful, I know.  I also ordered the green corn chicken tamale.\n\nThe beans were good, but a little too seasoned for me.  Not overly seasoned, but I'm a minimalist when it comes to beans.  Salt does it for me.  The red chile was made with shredded beef, while the green was made with cubes.  Both were tasty, but I couldn't detect one being hotter than the other, but you know how 3-ways are.  The tortillas were really good!  Maybe a little less \"floury\" than say a Carolina's tortilla.  Now the tamale was perfection.  I'm usually never impressed by a restaurant tamale's masa.  There's either way too much, or it's too tough or too soft, and it never tastes like home-made, maybe because they're restaurant-made.  El Bravo has it down.  I ordered mine without sauce, and it was served out of the husk, so I'm pretty sure they are made with only one husk.  I like the 2 or 3 husk version so you can peel away the layers....mmm, mmm.  \n\nSo, it's too late to make a long story short, but El Bravo is now my new favorite table-service Mexican restaurant for good ole Sonoran fare.", "business_id": "flUKBy7WHqYdfOrwU1A2SA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-09-12", "type": "review"}

The place is quaint and cozy but didn't feel too crowded.  We waited a while for the food, and I was totally fine with that... until I heard what sounded like the beeping and door opening/closing of a microwave.  Now I know it's the 21st century and the microwave has been a kitchen staple for years... but if I wanted a microwave meal, I could do that at home!  We started with the chips and salsa, and while the chips were light and crispy and delicious, the salsa really missed the mark for me.  I love a chunky pico de gallo style, but this just had weird seasoning and watery consistency.  The stuff in the squeezy bottle was even weirder tasting.  Okay, so no salsa... but the food that was coming out looked good.  As we got down to the business of ordering, we quickly realized there are no kids menu options.  We opted for a regular enchilada plate ($8) and I thought Little Guy could have leftovers for lunch the next day.  Wrong.  The regular plate came with a single enchilada, rice and beans.  So basically a kids portion for an adult price?  The #6 boasted a tamale, flauta and beef taco.  I was most excited about the tamale, but was a bit let down... The filling was sweet - something I guess I'm just not a big fan of.  The flauta was very dry and difficult to cut but was topped with some tasty guac.  The star of the plate hands down was the beef taco.  I think I'm in love with a crispy flour tortilla shell!  The chimichanga got good reviews at the table.  Bonus cinnamon crisps at the end rounded out the meal nicely.\n\nOverall this place was good.  I seriously think Filiberto's is comparable.  For the price ($35 for two kids and one adult, two waters and one Sprite, chips and salsa) I'm not sure it's the best choice for the quality, but I can't deny I'd try this place again just for a plate of tacos and a bucket of cinnamon crisps.", "business_id": "flUKBy7WHqYdfOrwU1A2SA", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-11-09", "type": "review"}

I actually called and complained about it to 2 different stores because when I called this Bell road store to complain they said there was no manager and the girl who answered was the girl I wanted to complain about so DUH I wasn't going to tell her my complaint so she could pass it on to no one so that is why I called the other locations which No one ever called me back soooo... we will never be going back here. \n\nSo on Sunday we went here and yes they were a little busy. Our order was taken within a few minutes and then we proceeded to the salsa bar which either the person before us made a huge mess or the thing hadn't been cleaned in a while. My boyfriend and I ordered the EXACT same thing... chicken taco plate, flour tortillas, mild salsa, add onion. Simple right??? Okay so the taco plates comes with a small bag of chips.... I asked him if I could get a small side of guac for my tacos- he then asked \"do you want the 8oz size with chips\"... and I told him NO... my meal comes with chips I just want a small side. (which I have gotten before and I think it was like 1.50 or so.) So me not paying attention to the receipt didn't realize that yes indeed he did (even though he asked me and I said NO) charged me for the 8oz with chips. Now like I said I just wanted a little guac for my tacos. Which not to mention the guac isn't really all that great. The tacos are good, the service is bad. \n\nSooooooooooooo anyways after we get our salsa we then sit down at a table to wait for our food. Pretty much every single open table was dirty too. Almost immediatly after sitting down a plate comes up in the window and is put under the heating lamp. About 5 minutes goes by and that same plate is still sitting up there. Okay so now the girl working puts that 5 min old plate in a bag and sets it there on the counter. And now about another 5 minutes goes by and a plate comes up in the window and she gets it and puts it in the bag with the old plate. And of course... my luck... it's our food! Okay now like I said before... we ordered the EXACT same thing! So now why did one come up in two minutes and the other take 10???  \n\nSo trying not to be rude but KNOWING that that 10 min old 5 minutes sitting in a bag food was going to be COLD.... I asked her \"why did the one come up so fast and the other take so long and they are the exact same thing... isn't that one going to be cold since it has been sitting in a bag for like 10 minutes\".... and she so rudely said \"I DONT KNOW\".... I don't know???? really????? are you kidding me... that was her answer. So I said again \"isn't that one going to be cold\"... I'm sorry but I don't go out to get cold food... and she said again even more rudely \"I DONT KNOW\". Uummmmmmmmmmm I think that should have been the point where she had them remake the food so it would be hot or something. \n\nOkay so then back to the guac.... So like I said I had realized that he had charged me for the 8oz when I only wanted the small side...  So I then mentioned to the RUDE girl that \"hey you guys charged me for the large side when I only wanted the small side\".... and she said \"WELL IT'S PRETTY MUCH THE SAME\"... ??????? what really???? it's totally not the same. You guys are now charging me for chips when my meal comes with a small bag. yes it was a lot more chips then we usually get but the point is... We didn't want them! So then I mentioned to her that my meal comes with chips and that I didn't want to buy extra chips and then SHE TURNS AROUND... GRABS THE TWO SMALL BAGS OF CHIPS THAT THE MEAL COMES WITH, BASICALLY SMASHES THEM IN HER HAND WHILE SHOVING THEM AT ME, AND PRETTY MUCH SAYS... HERE'S YOUR CHIPS. \n\nLike I said... the tacos are good - BUT NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME TO COME BACK AND BE TREATED LIKE GARBAGE BY SOME GIRL. I am a paying customer that doesn't like to pay for cold food, be charged extra for something that I didn't order, call to talk to a manager and be told that there is no manager, call and complain to not one but TWO different locations and be told by TWO different locations that a manager will call me back and have TWO different locations NOT CALL ME BACK! \n\nWILL NEVER GO BACK!", "business_id": "3msnZ6oe0sslHsE1js1QUA", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-11-08", "type": "review"}

I have to admit, I'm a bit puzzled with the 4 and 5 star reviews. Here is my take on Manuel's Mexican Restaurant:\n\nChips & salsa: the chips were crunchy and not at all greasy or salty. They were perfect. The salsa was more like pico de gallo. The waiter asked if we wanted the \"hot\" salsa. I use the term \"hot\" loosely, it was very mild. The consistency and color was more like a mariana sauce. It taste okay, but it was the weirdest salsa I've ever had. I realize not everyone can handle spicy stuff so I won't hold that against them.\n\nManuel's Taco Platter (me): Instead of going with the steak taco that came with the platter, I switched to a carnito (pulled pork) and chicken fajita. I thought it was strange that it was named the \"Taco Platter\" since a chicken fajita came with it. The pork taco was substantial. It came bare, nothing but meat, but the portion was huge! Pretty good too. The chicken was grilled along with the green peppers and onions. That too was pretty good. My platter came with a side of guac, green chile salsa, sour cream and refried beans. The beans were not that good.\n\nCarne Asada (my hubby): The steak was dry, not like beef jerky dry, but dry nonetheless. His meal came with a side of pico de gallo and a bean soup. I wish the bean soup came with my taco platter because it was delicious. \n\nI would go back for that bean soup.", "business_id": "DXBPI8rR9f_IthOGPDWoIQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-10-14", "type": "review"}

My first experience was ordering take out with my wife; as it was our first venture we both ordered the El Conquistador burrito (Chile Relleno, Steak Picado, Guacamole & Beans). The burrito was very good; the chile relleno was moderately spicy and firm, the steak was well seasoned and served medium and the beans were well prepared and likely scratch made.  One often overlooked but key item really delivered; the tortilla. It was a superb flour tortilla and if not scratch made then they're sourcing it from someone who knows what they're doing.\n\nMy second experience was group dinner in which I ordered Carne Asada tacos (soft).  The tacos were simple (as one should be), fresh and delicious. The beef appeared to be slow cooked in an oven rather than a traditional Sonora style grilled asada but that did not take away from the quality.  If you're a cabeza fan then you'll love their asada.  The obligatory chips and salsa were excellent. Homemade, thin yellow corn chips and two salsa options; a fresh, mild, traditional but tasty rojo and a smokey, spicy offering that was quite good.\n\nThe restaurant itself was very clean. On both visits I was served by the owners, apparently a husband and wife duo.  The wife was fun, friendly and attentive. \n\nIf you're craving some greasy, cheddar cheesy hangover curing Sonoran style gut bombs then hit up Mixtecca.  But if you want some terrific, homemade authentic Jalisco style food at a fantastic price you should get yourself to El Conquistador with the quickness.", "business_id": "cvhsdSDaWPjLVnTThQkx8g", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-11-22", "type": "review"}

I have been going to your restaurants for all of these years.   It used to be my favorite Mexican restaurant, I can tell you now it has fallen not only past the bottom of my list but completely off the list of not just Mexican Restaurants but all restaurants.   I will not come back, nor will I ever recommend it.\n\nHere is what happened.    We came to the Tatum Blvd one Sunday evening about 6pm.    There were maybe 10 tables with people, not busy at all.   I was with my wife and 2 kids, we were seated right away and our waiter was nice enough at first.    My son ordered the #52 as he always does, my wife ordered #24 but thought she was ordering #21, my daughter ordered her customary Cheese quesadilla from the kids menu and I ordered #39 (thought I'd try something different.).   First off my sons, silverware was dirty, (set ups) he simply took some from another table, seemed like not a big deal at the time.   Then when my wife's meal came 5 or so minutes late after everyone else's it was the Vegetarian Burrito not the Fajitas she thought she ordered.   Rather than trying to make it right for her the waiter became argumentative and told her that is what she ordered and gave her no option.    What makes this interesting is she ordered it as #24 but said to the waiter she wanted the Fajitas.   Her mistake but is the customer always right?  Should the waiter try to make her experience correct even if she made the error?   Should we have had the option of getting her the meal she wanted-even if you offered at a cost to us?    I did get my order and it wasn't as good as I expected but it was what I ordered, 1 BIG Standing tray of food, but not a Plate to be had.   Consequently, I dropped a Chorizo covered spoon on my clothing because I had this elevated monstrosity of a serving dish in front of me but no plate to eat of off.     Lastly but probably the most important was my son's dinner.   It seems he had a HARD FOREIGN OBJECT in his re-fried beans; it looked and felt like a pebble.   We pointed that out to our waiter, he response was: \"I'm sorry.\"    I would have thought we'd see a manager by that point but we did not.   I would think a HARD FOREIGN OBJECT which  was clearly not food in my son's beans warranted a free meal if not our entire bill given as complimentary.   You could have had some expensive dental work to pay for.   \n\nHere is the deal.   I am not happy, my wife is not happy, and my son is not happy and begged us not to go because we have had either bad service, messed up food orders, plus I have even had Chicken bones in my food in the past.   In fact I remember a time when he ordered #52 with beef before got it with chicken instead and they brought him an entire 2nd meal because of the error.    My 9 year old daughter is the only one in the family that likes it; plus it's pretty had to mess up a Cheese quesadilla (her order every time).   Here's the other tidbit of knowledge she doesn't get to be the one who buys dinners out, I am.    The consumer votes with dollars and I will cast my vote to not spend them in your restaurants again.  \n\nPlease let me know your thoughts I am very interested to know.   I paid with a credit card the bill totaled $49 and I tipped only $5 because of the sub standard service, I am sure you can find my order in your records.   I have probably had over 100+ meals from your restaurants over the years and I must say the Phoenix stores or should say at least the one at Paradise Valley Mall is terrible.   I don't think I ever had a bad meal at the Speedway location but I moved to Phoenix over 10 years ago and do not go to that location any longer, I cannot say the same for this location.", "business_id": "WxpCYziMlEy8mrEa_VcB1w", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-10-18", "type": "review"}

I like that the food is true to Mexico City and not the usual saucey and heavy Mexican food you see at restaurants. While the food was great the service was a little spotty.

I have been to this place many times, and I will keep going back. My way of judging a Mexican food place is by the Tortilla. If they have a delicious, self-made, fresh tortilla, things are promising and that is exactly what Carolina's has. They have their awards on the wall for all the times they have been voted Best Tortilla in Phoenix, in case you don't wanna take my word for it.\n\nOn to the food. I absolutely LOVE the food here! I have yet to try anything here that I didn't love. The tacos don't come in these pre-shapen, dried out, hard shells like some other places. You can see some of the grease on it form the very recent deep-frying, and it is perfectly crisp without being dried out. The meet is always cooked perfectly. I have never ordered something and been disappointed by dried out meat. Some of my favorite things here are the chimichanga and hard-shell beef tacos, which is shredded beef, not the crappy ground junk that a lot of places use. The Chimichangas have to be my favorite, though. I have never had a chimichanga this great. Be careful, though, because the inside of it is REALLY HOT. You will burn yourself if you don't let it cool a little. I would love to talk about the taste of the food more, but I'm making myself too hungry, so I'll move on.\n\nThe best part about Carolina's is the price. You cannot beat the price for the quality of food you get. Tacos are all $0.75, all the time! I guarantee you will be filled up from tacos before you feel like you spent too much on them, and you won't be disappointed with the taste! I can't remember the exact price for the chimichangas, but I do remember that it is much less than you will pay anywhere else, and much more delicious!\n\nThe location isn't the best, but who cares. The best stuff is always hard to find! If you don't think it's in a safe area and that is what's deterring you, don't let it. There are cops in and out of there all the time to eat. Plus, nobody wants to pull any crap here because it's just too good!\n\nEDIT: Tacos are not $0.75 anymore. I guess they are up to $2.00 now. New price is disappointing, but this doesn't change my rating because they are still the best tacos around!", "business_id": "d52zg-S0o940WUCK-nNiKw", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-11-16", "type": "review"}

American fast food mainstays like McDonald's are drowned out by hole-in-the-wall shacks ending in \"-berto's.\" But the fact of the matter is, for all their ubiquitousness, most of these taco stands are downright awful. I mean, they'll do in a pinch, such as when you're drunk at 1AM and looking for something to compete with tequila for the remaining space in your stomach, but no one ever says, \"Man, the burrito I had at Filiberto's was stellar!\" That's just not the itch those places scratch.\n\nSo, you can imagine how apprehensive I was when I walked into Carolina's Mexican Food and found that it did indeed look \"dive-y.\" Would the food fit the atmosphere?

It looks like your car will be broken into if you are not in the (small) parking lot; 2. The garbage cans are always overflowing... do they ever take the trash out?; 3. There is next to no seating; and 4. Definitely sat near a gang member getting lunch who stared my friends down during lunch.

I've been to tons of dives in my time, but this may very well be the divyest dive I've ever dived headfirst into.  That's not meant to be mean spirited to owner Carolina Valenzuela and her establishment, because in this case its part of the charm of a legendary Mexican establishment that I finally got the chance to try for the first time.  What this place lacks in aesthetics, it more than makes up for with its fantastic food.\n\nThe original Carolina's location is just south of Downtown on 12th Street.  Its an old weathered building that looked like it could've been a pawn shop or a tire dealer in a past life.  I think its fair to say the neighborhood surrounding the restaurant is somewhat impoverished, though theres a fair amount of industrial business nearby too.  Let's just say that Carolina's building blends in with the neighborhood.  That said, you'll be waiting in line forever at lunch as this place gets jam packed during the work week.  I opted to come here after work around 4:30pm.  Still, worried about the lines, I called my order ahead before I arrived.\n\nWhen I arrived for my pickup?  Dead.  I was the only one there.  Maybe my timing was awesome?  I wasn't complaining as I was able to get in and out in two minutes.  There's a little bit of seating inside, but I was getting it to go this time around.  I decided to get a dozen of their tortillas since everyone seems to rave about those.  As for a meal to take home it seems that the chimichangas are a popular staple, so a beef chimichanga combo it was.  A big hearty beef chimichanga topped with guacamole and sour cream with a side of beans and rice.  Total for the combo plus the tortillas was $13.  \n\nThe chimichanga is exactly what I was hoping for.  A thick crispy fried tortilla with plenty of shredded beef and spices to boot.  Goes great with the guacamole and sour cream, though the beef is truly the dominant flavor with this one.  The beans were also very good and had some good chunks of bean I could pick up (not a bean puree like other Mexican food spots I've been to).  The rice was pretty much what I expected.  Nothing wow about the rice, but met my expectations.  And the tortillas I got were enormous.  I decided to make a homemade quesadilla with one of them and I'm already stuffed.  But I agree with fellow Yelpers that its worth getting some of their tortillas.  They're made in house (you can see where they make them behind the front counter), and have a much different texture than the stuff you get at the grocery store.\n\nBarrio Cafe remains my favorite Mexican spot in the valley, but comparing Barrio with Carolina's is apples and oranges.  Barrio is essentially gourmet, whereas Carolina's is Mexican for the masses.  Its inexpensive, the quality is excellent, and its been drawing every demographic imaginable for years.  Its not hard to see why Carolina's faithful turn to this dingy location again and again.  You can damn well be sure I'll be one of them.", "business_id": "d52zg-S0o940WUCK-nNiKw", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-11-04", "type": "review"}

Waitress service, in spite of my not speaking Spanish, confirmed that I had made a great choice and also suggested I try the Coca Cola Mexico. (More on it later)\n\nWhen the Tacos arrive they are quite lovely and just as described. Beautiful red-orange thinly sliced pork, obviously well marinated on perfect corn tortillas (my choice) topped with onion and cilantro. Homemade salsa, fresh lime and cilantro as well as some beans in a fabulous pungent liquid finish off the Presentation.\n\nDon't let the barebones dining room turn you away and I can promise you won't be sorry.  My rule of thumb is that I won't do good Review unless I visit twice (will do a bad one after only one horrible visit) but I have taken that rule way too far with these Tacos from heaven. Let's just say my car can find Asadero Norte de Sonora on its own!  Check the hours because they are a bit strange but GO.\n\nNow for the Coca Cola from Mexico. I am a former Coca Cola addict (NOT Diet), but hadn't had one in several years, because the last was absolutely awful and made me wonder what I ever liked about Coca Cola!

It comes in a half or full size. We got to pick three meats  with the full size and chose the  chicken,pastor and carne asada. We could have also picked lengua,beef Head and another meat i can't remember. I am not usually a big fan of pastor but this pastor changed my mind, it was very tasty. The chicken was really delicious and the carne asada was on point too. We had the choice of corn or flour tortillas and the platter also had several grilled vegetables piled on top- green onion, tomato and Guerito Chiles. They also gave us a plate with fresh cucumber, red onion and a bowl of guacamole. \n\nThe three of us ate for $25 (including drinks) and even had to take food home because we could not finish the full size platter. Very good value and plenty of food. \n\nI would have given them five stars if they had more salsa choices, I personally love a good Salsa de Molcajete and that would have been a perfect compliment as it is a roasted type salsa. Their salsa was just basic and nothing to write home about. \n\nAlso, it is very loud in the restaurant and hard to hear. So, we kept our mouths full with good food and kept the talking to a minimum since it was hard to hear. LOL\n\nAsadero is on the southwest corner of Monroe and 16th St and the parking is a tight fit and very limited. However,  there is an empty parking lot on the other side of Monroe on the northwest side of 16th street that we parked at (as did several other families) and walked the short distance across the street. The only bad part about parking there was coming out after dark and seeing a suspicious guy lurking over in that lot. His body language implied he was up to no good, so be careful if you park over there because that parking lot is not lit at all and as overgrown bushes and trees with a low wall surrounding it making several places to hide behind. \n\nI am from Los Angeles and to go out to get some decent ethnic foods, you have to go to certain neighborhoods that sometimes are questionable. When doing so, you must be vigilant while in those type areas.  I felt I was back there coming out of the restaurant so,  I was  already very vigilant coming out and spotted the guy right away before we walked over there.We had our guy friend drive from the restaurant lot to the one across the street and the creeper guy got spooked and took off. \n\nWe will go back for sure and will be a place to stop when we are in the area!", "business_id": "1nq6zzJuVgwaHtXau97_Iw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-10-28", "type": "review"}

They make it even better, in my opinion, by sticking some chips in with your beans and cheese. It's like a mini nacho surprise. Plus, they always add a small slice of orange with every meal. I usually don't eat it, but it always adds a nice touch and smell to your eating experience. \n\nI've not ventured too much beyond my yummy tacos, but my fellow coworkers always rave about their chimmi's and burritos with just as much gusto as I do about my tacos.  Oh, and the other day, I tried a sampling of their breakfast burritos, and I must say they were muy delicioso. Eggs and potatoes and bacon wrapped in a fresh, homemade tortilla -- that is what I call a heavenly breakfast.\n\nAnd, finally, of course, are their baked goods. Again, I haven't tried their whole selection, but in the past I've been lucky enough to partake of their empanadas, and I've never been disappointed. \n\nAll in all, Azteca is a fantastic Mexican food experience in the heart of downtown Phoenix.

Then 20 mins after getting my drink she came and asked us if we were getting food. A couple of us said yes we are all getting food. She then continued to wave her hands in a circular \"come on\" motion. For what we took as a hurry up lets get this over with.

(Needing a refill by this point) she then precedes to take everyone elses order then walked away (still needing a refill) 30 mins later she brought us our food. We all ate (still needing a refill ) didnt bother to ask for a 3rd time for another drink. I asked for my check. 30 mins later i asked the manager of the bar i belive her name was Lisa. To get our checks she brings them back and they had things on them other people at the table ordered (if she would have went around the table  instead of a russian rullet style this would not have happened) i get my bill.

On that bill was a gratuity of 8.00 i was pissed i was not going to tip her and when i asked why it was on there she smirked saying \"partys of 6 or more is automatic \" i told her she did not deserve thia tip at all and she said \"oh well\" .... tipping is for service. I did not receive 8.00 worth of service. So she took it as it was a for sure tip she didnt have to give good service being she would be tipped either way.

We haven't been to On the Border for many years since we don't live near one. Decided it was worth the drive since we got a Local Flavor voucher. Waitress was prompt in getting our drinks and taking our order. We ordered the trio (with chicken fajitas), two kids meals, and I ordered a fajita bowl. We specified several times that one of our daughter's meals could not have cheese as she is allergic. Even asked to make sure the beans did not get cheese sprinkled on it. \n\nAfter that it went downhill. The food seemed to take awhile to come out. We had to wave down the waitress after awhile because our girls were hungry and we were out of chips (she had not checked on us after she took our order).  No plates, napkins or silverware have been brought to the table so we tried our best not to make a mess eating salsa and chips without napkins.\n\nOur food finally comes out and is brought by someone from the kitchen. We noticed cheese on the taco and on the beans of our daughter's meal. Told the guy she could not eat cheese. He promptly took it back (no apologies from him or the waitress). The dish came back - no cheese on the taco, but still cheese on the beans. I didn't want to say anything else since we didn't want to have to wait for her dinner any longer. Asked the waitress for some napkins and utensils since she did not notice we didn't have any. We waited and watched her go to other tables after she left us, filled up drinks at one, took an order from another and disappeared into the kitchen. After what seemed like another eternity, she came with silverware and napkins for us. My husband and my dish required utensils to eat - it wasn't like we had tacos, etc. where we could use our hands. Would have been nice if she went straight to the kitchen to get our utensils so we could eat. Maybe it was the job of the hostess to have left us with some utensils and napkins?\n\nMy husband had ordered the trio which comes with soup, fajitas, and dessert. He realized when we got our meal that he never got his soup. We had to wave our waitress down for the soup. She made a comment that she had put the order in. She never came back to check on us after that. \n\nWe tried to wave her down several times but she did not see us. Finally got her attention and she was about to give us our bill (without bringing desserts for three out of the four meals that came with desserts). We asked if we could substitute one of the desserts for our girls since she could not have the ice cream that comes with the meal but possibly one sopapilla instead. She said she would have to ask and whoever she asked was kind enough to let us substitute the dessert for our daughter. We got our desserts and had to ask for water. She came back and filled only one cup of water when there were two set out for her at the edge of the table together for her to fill up (we didn't realize she only filled one until after she left)! She brought us our check again, we gave our credit card for payment and it seemed like forever again before we got the credit card receipt again. In and out in just under two hours, on a Sunday night and there were only a few tables besides ours (not at all busy). Our youngest commented she never wants to return since she had to wait so long.

But it wasn't what I'd call a cheese crisp, it was really a quesadilla, at least by all of my past Mexican food experiences.  Nonetheless, it was pretty tasty, and a BIG meal by the time you threw in the beans & rice (which were very average).  I also got a chicken taco, on corn tortillas.  The tortillas are tiny, but they load the thing up with a lot of meat and fixins, so at $1.15 (!), they're an awesome deal, and VERY tasty.\n\nOn the Brak-o-meter, the taco rates a solid 5 stars, the cheese crisp a good 3.5 stars, and value rates 5.. for a composite average of 4 or thereabouts.

The girls liked the beans mixed with rice and I enjoyed the beans and mexican cheese.\n\nThe chicken taquito was the best of the bunch.  The marinated pork took second but was a little dry.  The carne asada brought up the bottom.  It had a bit of a gassy taste and was far behind the great carne asada at El Sol.  \n\nThe tacos here are small as the name suggests but three of them are plenty for a lunch.  \n\nI would like to go back for a Diablo burro and to try the fish tacos.\n\nOverall this is an above average fast food place and the best place I have found for street tacos.", "business_id": "rDvz5jX65gpfONFu7er9Tw", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-10-12", "type": "review"}

Just never have developed a liking for soft tacos.  I love tortillas, both corn and flour, but as a taco, I just don't dig that style.  If I want a soft tortilla, I'll order a burrito.\n\nOK, enough about me.  On to the Los Taquitos review.\n\nThe Good:\n\nThe beans were very good.  Darker in color than your average re-fried beans, and had a \"fuller\" taste.  I and my 11-yr-old daughter both nommed the heck out of them.\n\nThe Carne Asada was very well-flavored and barely not too dry,  \"walking the line\" between moist and dry.\n\nThe salsa they provided in a plastic squirt bottle was VERY good - the right amount of heat (more than average) and with a good chile taste.  Had my daughter searching for watery relief.\n\nThe kids liked the chicken in the tacos.  Noticeably moist and flavorful. \n\nMy daughter was a big fan of the cheese on the tacos.  Not sure what kind it was, but it was good.\n\nThe \"Not-So-Good\":\n\nWe had the hard shell tacos.  The shells were \"VERY\" hard.  Hard to the point that the whole taco collapsed after the first or second bite.  If they changed to a slightly better hard taco shell, these tacos would improve quite a bit.\n\nThe marinated pork was very dry, and neither of my kids liked the taste of the seasonings.\n\nThe meat portion of each taco was a little on the \"skimpy\" side.  We had massive amounts of shell left over with no meat remaining, after the tacos fell apart and we started eating the pile.\n\nThe \"Blah\":\n\nThe rice was standard, very bland.\n\nSo, all in all, this is a decent place.  I've been eating Mexican food in Texas, Arizona, and in a few other countries for most of the last 35 years.  This place is an above-average spot which could improve.\n\nBut anyone who says this is the \"best Mexican food\" has just not had enough of it to know better.", "business_id": "rDvz5jX65gpfONFu7er9Tw", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-10-01", "type": "review"}

You could go down the street to Macayo's and get a meal for twice the price and half the flavor.  More than price, value is king these days, and Los Taquitos knows the drill.\n\nI tend to judge the quality of a restaurant on the goodness of their machaca, and Los Taquitos does an excellent job for the low price point.  In their burritos, quesadillas and tamales, the meat is flavorful and moist.  I second the vote of others on the rice and beans being tasty - I particularly enjoyed the rice in its fluffy, flavorful goodness.  It didn't taste like an afterthought.  Spring for the side of guacamole - it's a welcome addition to the plate, particularly if you're sopping up the whole mess with a bag of chips.\n\nMy husband and I ate like kings and didn't even manage to kill a $20.

The husband and I were wanting something quick and filling after working on house renovations and after a desperate yelp search, I found Los Taquitos with numerous complimentary reviews.  When we arrived, we were underwhelmed by the boxy feel of the interior -- the restaurant is essentially a box with tables around the perimeter and down the middle -- but the place was clean and everything smelled great.  What we DID appreciate was our food.  Really nice flavors, very filling, and fresh.  My husband got a veggie burrito and it was huge.  I ordered the veggie bowl and really liked the hashbrown-style potatoes (and the beans...and rice... and veggies...and sauce...).  Prices are reasonable (about $14 for the two of us) and wait time was pretty short.  If you are ever in Ahwatukee and are craving some Mexican eats, check out Los Taquitos.", "business_id": "rDvz5jX65gpfONFu7er9Tw", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-11-12", "type": "review"}

The service is always quick and friendly. With their new renovations they now have a wide open and colorful dining area with plenty of tables for groups big and small.\n\nOf the many things we've had, it's a tie between the Street Tacos and the Tamales plate as my favorite. The three street taco plate comes with all the fixings, your choice of taco meat (which can be different for each one), rice and beans. I recommend their Carne Asada which has the perfect flavor to it.\n\nThe tamale plate is the closest thing to my Nana's homemade tamales I've found here in the valley. The beef tamales were really fluffy with spicy red chili beef cooked in. The plate comes with two tamales which, like the tacos, can be a mix of their three flavors: Beef, Chicken, or Cheese. \n\nI can go on and on about all the things we've had there because we keep coming back any time we get the chance.
