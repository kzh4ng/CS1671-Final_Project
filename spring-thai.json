They never looked especially busy (but then during theater times, I've rarely been anywhere downtown that really WAS 'especially busy') and we really didn't know anything about it.  So on this particular foray into a night with Lily Tomlin, we thought we'd try something different.\n\nI see all the growling reviews here complaining about...well...everything...from service to food, and frankly, I'm not quite sure we were all at the same restaurant.\n\nI'm also a bit confused by most people calling it 'Thai' when the menu says 'Cambodian'.\n\nLemon Grass was pleasant.  They did seem to operate with minimal staff, but they certainly seemed to keep up.  There was a small group of diners when we arrived, and that number grew while we were there, seemed like mostly people who were going to the same show we were.\n\nThe menu options were quite ethnic and unusual from things I'd seen on most Asian menus, which to me, was very cool. Couldn't pronounce them, but the ingredients were certainly unlike the others, so we decided to try a couple of dishes we'd never tried before, including an appetizer.\n\nThe appetizers were called 'Na Taings' and were like little non-sweet rice krispie treats that came with a very yummy pork and curry sauce to top them with.  There were five on the plate.  Several of their appetizers came 5 to the plate.  Ok folks, what is UP with the odd numbers on appetizer plates around here lately?  If you're sharing with another person, do we really want to incite a riot over who gets the last one?  Even Stevens is best on any shared plate.  Two for you, two for me, or three for you, three for me...not 'Oh no, you go ahead'  'No, YOU go ahead, really'.\n\nAnyway, the appetizer was quite tasty and hit the spot.\n\nMy friend ordered hot tea, which seemed to come in a magical pot.  The pot was only about two inches tall, and about as round as a very small tortilla, but it filled both of our normal sized cups three times.  It was a beautiful little creation of a pot, I must say. It looked like cast iron, and was very ornamental, and came with its own matching trivet to rest upon.  The tea was a very flavorful jasmine. How six cups managed to fit in that tiny pot is amazing.\n\nFor the entrees, I cannot remember the names of the dishes, nor can I find them listed online. Lemon Grass doesn't seem to have its own website, and all of the menu sites only appear to have a minimalist lunch menu, or something outdated.\n\nMy friend ordered something with many vowels and consonants, that was a seafood-curry-vegetable mix on a bed of 'crispy rice noodles', and I ordered another dish with many vowels and consonants, that was a pork based curry and vegetable (but lower on the veggie count) also over a bed of crispy rice noodles.\n\nAfter the waitress took our order, she came back from the kitchen to inform my friend that the dish she'd ordered was out, so my friend opted for the same as I.\n\nThe dishes arrived.  There was a giant mound of crispy white rice noodles, and they were indeed 'crispy', with a decent sized spot of the actual meat and curry portion nestled against it, with a ginormous decorative flower made of beet (my plate) and carrot (her plate) on a landscaping of parsley.  We switched plates...beets make me gag.  Then the waitress asked if we wanted chopsticks, and well...not so functional for a blind woman, but I opted to use them.\n\nThe dish was unusual and quite delicious - but a CHORE to eat, with either a fork OR chop sticks.  The first bite I tried to take with the chop sticks literally thrust the end of a very rigid rice noodle right up my right nostril.  In my friend's case, even with a fork, rice noodles were flying.  But, all in all, it was quite delicious. It was pork, a curry gravy, some bean sprouts, and fried egg strips.  Honestly, except for the grrrrrr of trying to contain the crispy rice noodles to the plate, it was a tasty and filling meal.  Quite pleasant, and it was nice to try something 'new' to us.\n\nThe bill wasn't outrageous, just under $40 for two entrees, an appetizer, and a pot of tea.\n\nWe both agreed that we'd go back...but next time we'll avoid the 'crispy' noodles for something a bit more malleable like rice or soft noodles.\n\nThe staff was fine and helpful - the food decent.  Heck the only thing that made the evening even slightly unpleasant was the cackling yinzer at one table who apparently thought she was in her own dining room at home.\n\nFor the pre-theater or concert scenario, I do recommend it.  It's worth a shot, especially if you're an 'outside the box' eater.  Try something you can't pronounce...what the heck.", "business_id": "Lm_mR5xDF91OeZw97ch41g", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-04-26", "type": "review"}

The cuisine is authentic, and always delightful, and the service is superb. Six days out of seven, there will be no wait when you show up, so of course reservations aren't necessary. The longest I have ever had to wait at this restaurant was ten minutes tops. To compliment the Thai theme, the restaurant is beautifully decorated, everything very tasteful and not overdone. The wood carvings along the walls are interesting to behold, and the music is soothing, but not overpowering to conversation. \n\nThe Thai House is versatile as far as occasion is concerned; it serves well for dinner dates, but equally well for business lunches. Though I would recommend business casual attire, the servers never look down at customers in jeans or casual clothes. They are always friendly, and happy to please everyone. \n\nAt lunch time, along with your entree, you are served a soup of the day which is always light and refreshing, and a fried spring roll. The sweet orange sauce that you dip this spring roll in is to die for. I could make a meal on those spring rolls alone. \n\nNearly every time I dine at this restaurant, I order the Sweet Jasmine Tea-- absolutely delicious. And although many people recognize Thai food for Pad Thai, PLEASE be adventurous and try some of the curry dishes. My absolute favorite is called Panang Neur (with chicken): this has coconut milk, crushed peanuts and bell peppers over rice. When you are served this dish, it will look like soup-- simply dump the white rice on your plate, and spoon out as much of the chicken, bell peppers, and curried liquid over the rice as you please. This is a SPECIAL TREAT. \n\nUnfortunately, the above entree is extremely addicting, and you will find yourself craving Thai House curry dishes on the regular.

I ordered the fried spring rolls, the basil chicken, and a Thai iced coffee. Pretty safe selection, one would think. The spring rolls were okay, I suppose, though really not that great. The problem was really with the basil chicken: it was honestly quite gross. First, why do they use ground chicken? That's just wrong. Ground chicken is wrong. As are most other types of ground meats, in my humble opinion, but chicken even more so. And the dish was just not good. I ate a little bit of it and was done.

Of hearing about it, finally, we decided to walk over and pick up some food.\nthen I read some of the yelp reviews and almost changed my mind. The reviews were pretty bad: several reports of poor service and the -the most alarmingly one of all - pointing out how bland and flavorless the food was. also, there were descriptions of it being a cool baby type place with haughty staff and incompetent servers. Did the tempe pita jungle servers moonlight at wild thaiger?\nI was surprised because all the times I drove past it - before realizing how popular it was - I thought it looked typical of a thai/asian place. The name was silly and cheesy, and the giant purple banner that takes up almost the entire front of the unsuspecting cinderblock rest. has just the eyes of a tiger staring at you from their very purple perch. How can this place possibly be too-cool?\nI checked out their web site (which I was surprised to find they had one as this place looks pretty hole-in-the-wall) so we could order ahead and walk to pick it up. the site was pretty slow and I almost gave up, but I was pretty stoked on the options and the prices. Grilled peanut chicken? Sounds great. Spicy chicken curry, I'll take it. tiger prawn salad, ok. All for about $8?? Sounds pretty reasonable. I went with the curry chicken and the spring roll (all lunch items come with either soup of the day or the roll - unless your taking out, as they won't/can't do soup to go.)\nOff we went and when we walked up I was surprised to find that the ramada-like, large patio with high walls and iron bars took up the entire front of the building. We had to search around for the hidden entrance. Once inside it was busy with a downtown business casual crowd, but a scurrying waitress still held the door and asked if we wanted a table (for the record she was not in skinny jeans, flats and sporting tons of eyeliner and a fauxhawk, as I figured she would be).  We walked up to the bar to collect our food and pay, and the lively atmosphere made me sad we were going back to the office and not eating there. the bar area had a flat screen tv, there was lively if a little over-the-top Asian pop music, and the healthy crowd was a nice change of pace. Alas, we were in and out (they were not even put out by our asking to split up the to go order so we could each pay separately, even though they were obviously busy) in under 10 minutes.\nThe food stayed pretty hot for the 15 minute walk back, and they double bagged each Styrofoam box -thank god, as half my curry sauce came out of the box. It smelled great and the veggies looked good, but I braced myself for disappointment. Perhaps because I was expecting it to be bad, I was pleasantly surprised. It was pretty good. Mine was just enough spicy as is (for me, though and I'm a wuss - so If you're into hot-hot-hot, ask to punch it up a notch or three) and the serving was plenty for the price. The veggie spring roll was great - not even soggy from the trip, how did that happen? I think the curry sauce was a little thin, but it wouldn't keep me from ordering it again - my coworker's ginger chicken sauce looked thin as well, but she said it was still great. The tiger prawn salad had green, fresh lettuce (looked like a spring mix) and came with lots of scrimps that were \"fat and juicy.\" However, they listed that the salad came with crispy wontons, but her box was sans any wontons - really the only foil in the entire experience.\nAll in all I would say it was a score. The three of us agreed that it would make a good HH spot.\nIt's no yupha's, but certainly better than thai basil - and not a chain.

Wild Thaiger has had many TV personalities visit the place, but also celebrities that come by PHX.  I know because of the pictures posted in the back wall - haha!  Decorated with traditional Thai art; Wild Thaiger tries to emulate that Thailand feel along with your cuisine.  \n\nI've been here several times once for dinner and once for Happy Hour.  I'm a big fan of the fried noodles mainly Pad See Ew - Stir-fried fat noodles with your choice of protein; chicken, beef, or pork; and of course vegetables.  Seems pretty simple, but this dish packs a punch of aroma and spice.  It's usually fried in a garlic sauce and the amount of heat is based on how much you can handle.  I can't do the Thai spice I'll admit so I always do the medium.  In any case, Wild Thaiger deliveries with the Pad See Ew along with their traditional Pad Thai dish.  Another stir-fried noodle, but this one is with the skinny noodles and it's much sweeter.\n\nOverall, I would come here for Happy Hour because they have 1/2 off appetizers.  Their selection of Thai beer is always interesting something I think you need to try for you beer connoisseurs out there.

We arrived around 6:15. We were told there would be a 20 minute wait. As we waited we noticed several tables open. I asked about this and I was told they were preparing tables for a large group and once they were done they would assess the seating availability. The open seats were booths and a small table for 2 on the patio. A large group would not use any of these open tables. We Waite some more and when I went to see how much longer it would be I was told about 10 minutes. I reminded the hostess of the original 20 minute wait she originally stated that we were already beyond, and once again pointed out the several booths and tables that were open. She then tells me they only have 3 servers and that is why they're not seating all tables. If the hostess had been honest with me from the beginning I could have made the decision to wait or not. Instead my time was wasted. I could see the owner busy cooking in the kitchen. I would suggest she spend a little more time on the front. We wound up leaving and ate at a very nice place called Sushi Station. It wasn't Thai, but it's a very nice place, and the Sushi is really good. You should check it out.

I would definitely come back and try the other dishes.", "business_id": "KPoTixdjoJxSqRSEApSAGg", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-04-29", "type": "review"}

Laos being neighbors of Thailand, the food is just about the same with of slight differences. After a 20min wait on First Friday, we waited another 15-20 mins per each dish. We ordered 3. The first dish was spring rolls. Let me tell you I have had my share of spring rolls with peanut sauce. I thought I would experience just any other experience I've had, which is average. I mean it's spring rolls. The first bite with the peanut sauce was the most delicious bite I have ever had. I could of just ordered spring rolls and I would of been more than satisfied.

The food was just okay. In fact, it read more appealing on the menu, which is gigantic. How is one ever suppose to decide?\n\nMy lunch buddy and I went today to try Thai Lahna for the first time. It was pretty full around 12:30. I snagged a table. Service was prompt and we had waters in no time. \n\nWe ordered a shrimp app that was made in chili/lime sauce with mint and lemongrass. Uhm, it was okay. The shrimp is nothing to write home about, but I did enjoy munching on the bed of lettuce that was drenched in the spicy sauce. I really, really, really wanted this to knock my socks off, for the seasonings sounded like they would create an \"oh my god\" experience. What a shame.\n\nI ordered the Eggplant Jay, since it came highly recommended. Little did I know I'd have to fight off 500,000 onions for one piece of super delicious eggplant. Not my idea of a good time. I really wish this dish could have been better. The eggplant was good - what there was of it.\n\nMy friend ordered veggies in red curry with coconut. It was pretty tasty, until you bit into a sliver of corn and about fell out of your chair from the punch of salt. Wowza. \n\nPrice was decent. The app ended up costing more than either of our entrees, which was strange to me. But, oh well. It averaged out to about $20 a person for all that, drinks and tip included. \n\nParking is a cinch, since it's in public lot. I had no problem finding a spot during the lunch rush.\n\nSOMETHING STRANGE: \nWe weren't asked if we wanted to box up our left overs until AFTER we had paid and were getting ready to leave. I thought that was strange. But, it would have been one thing if I had really wanted to take the food home with me. I didn't. \n\nChance of my coming back here?

I long ago stopped eating Chinese food entirely--bland piles of flavorless noodles and weird sticky-sweet sauces, no thank you. And I don't have any use for cloying, syrupy Pad Thai dishes that roll around begging for your attention like some filthy two-dollar noodley whore. I like my Thai food spicy. Thai spicy. Pink Pepper delivers, and for that I dub thee the Best Thai in Phoenix. \n\nMy personal favorite dish is called \"Spicy Green Bean with Tofu\", aka Prik King. I'm a vegetarian, and they have a ton of veg options, but not to worry, carnivores, they've got your back. Unbelievably flavorful, with fresh vegetables--not fresh-frozen, really fresh. And spicy? They ask you to order your spiciness based on a 1-to-10 scale, 10 being the surface of the sun. Not coincidentally, very much like the \"pain scale\" you may find at hospitals. I order a 10, and they always ask me \"are you sure?\"--possibly for insurance purposes. So so good. If your tastes are milder, they'll take care of you. You'll get less heat but no less flavor. \n\nI've only had the lunch buffet once--and it is a bit milder, as one would expect when feeding a crowd of suburbanites. It's a great opportunity to try dishes you've never had before, and if you want something stronger they're more than happy to let you order off the menu. \n\nThe service? Well, I live in California and I don't get into town that often. I've only eaten at the Pepper maybe 10-15 times over the last few years. But every time I walk in, the wait staff greets me by name and remembers what I ordered on my last visit.  Incredibly nice folks. \n\nAtmosphere? Well, it's 1985 in there. I like 1985. Kind of a teal green/gray combo. It's a high end Miami Vice video type thing, sans neon. It's very unique, it has character and I sincerely hope they leave it the way it is. It's clean, well-kept, nice low-level lighting, great for a first date. \n\nTo recap: stop reading this and get down there post-haste.", "business_id": "_IE5XDjxeM47NSzhg7sItg", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-04-12", "type": "review"}

I love the pad thai especially because it isn't overly greasy or soupy at all. The tofu was really good, pan-fried to perfection. And I like it hot! Even at a mere 'medium' spice it was burning my palate. The veggie rolls were meatless and were made with lots of pepper counteracted by the sweet and sour sauce. Steaming hot, extra-crisp. Great big portions make for plenty of leftovers for tomorrow's lunch.\n\nThe service is quick and the man who always seems to be working is so so friendly.

As is often with ethnic foods in America that are aimed at those who may have never left our borders, the flavors have one thing in common, sweetness. Sugar seems to be the common glue that tricks the unsophisticated palate into thinking a food is great. Krua Thai conforms to this method of preparing dishes. Consistency in preparation is also missing. True, many a chef will modify a recipe taking advantage of seasonal fresh veggies or substitute when a particular ingredient may be hard to find such as Thai Basil or Kaffir Lime but to not follow the very recipe as it has been printed in their menu, missing common items, not just once, but again and again, this does not bode well for repeat visits. \n\nIf you do in fact find yourself still curious, the dishes marked spicy are only indicators that they can be made spicy, do not forget to ask for them to make your dish with chili otherwise your salty sweet dish will not have a hint of heat.", "business_id": "nefBMCGgMPvOnASoyO_X1A", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-04-24", "type": "review"}

The noodles were not the Pad Thai noodles that I was used to but ramen noodles, and the taste was very bland. Plus it was really oily. I have no idea what was going on but it was definitely not the usual Pad Thai I was used to. \n\nFast forward to yesterday and a friend suggested we meet here for dinner.

Krua Thai redeemed themselves as this dish was very flavorful, even though it was Thai Hot. Believe it or not, the spiciness did not ruin the dish.

Food must taste like food, not candy.  Most other places layer on the sugar, MSG and oil.\n\nEvery time we walked by this place it smells really good, so I finally convinced her to try it.  She went into her usual complicated requests, but the guy was very patient with her, took time to explain it's only a teaspoon of soybean oil he uses, and that his combination helps with the taste.  To exclude it totally, it would not be what she would like.  It went a few rounds, but she agreed and we got our order.  I was simpler.  Kung Pao and white rice.  I was told I could get fried rice, I appreciated that, but opted for simple white rice.\n\nThe chef/owner was very concerned and asked what we thought after our take out was delivered to us.  Well, we had got it to go, so could not reassure him as yet.  But I appreciate that he cared enough to come check if we were happy.\n\nGot home, ate that stuff up.  Wife was very happy.  You don't know what a compliment this is.  She is so fussy.  Mine was very good too.  We both agreed we will go back and try some more.  If they keep up the flavorful, not oily, not too sweet and good size (Pei Wei gives you 2/3 rice and 1/3 food.  This was full food and a side of rice.), it could be a regular place for us.\n\nI understand that Orange Chicken is suppose to be sweet, so when I try that, I will not ding them.

The chicken satay that came with the appetizer sampler was decent, but the rest of the items (fried sweet potato, fried tofu, spring rolls) did not have a crispy enough coating. Perhaps even worse, the coating tasted more like one that belonged on a corn dog than on an Thai morsel. \n\nWhen we had finished our appetizers, the waiter brought out our spicy clear noodle dish, but not our beef red curry. We decided not to wait to start eating and dove into the noodle dish. It tasted like noodles sauteed in hot sauce and...that's it. In my opinion, good noodle dishes have a complexity - for example, a good pad Thai has hints of tamarine, peanut, lime, and fish sauce. This noodle dish had one level to it, and the one level wasn't even that good. \n\nAbout 10 minutes later, the waiter returned with our red curry, started to set it down on the table, and then hurriedly excused himself, going back to the kitchen with the dish. 5 minutes later, he returned with the same dish and apologized, saying that before \"it was too rare.\" Well, it was now the opposite of rare - tough and chewy. Additionally, the curry sauce was thin and milky-tasting, not thick and properly balanced between the spice and coconut milk. Oh, and in case it wasn't bad enough already, the rice was chewy and a bit dry as if it had been made the previous day. \n\nSo that was our experience at Thai Basil. Not great. Not even good. To be fair, the check was very low for such a decent amount of food, but I would have rather spent $20-$30 more and had a good Thai meal at Wild Thaiger or Malee's Bistro.", "business_id": "K4DHwck_2ds1wURnmZdFiA", "stars": 2, "date": "2008-05-08", "type": "review"}

Chang's than dimly-lit lounge and at least for lunch, it was nice to sit in a well-lit, comfortably air-conditioned restaurant and enjoy some quality if standard Thai food. The menu certainly had some less-than-authentic options (crab puffs) and was tailored towards people new to or afraid of \"ethnic cuisine\" (there were indicators on certain parts of the menu like \"if you're new to Thai, start here!\"). However, the duck curry and jalapeno fried rice we had contained really good quality ingredients (the duck curry was full of tender, large slices of duck breast) and were actually quite flavorful. Next time, we'll say spicy for the curry, though, because medium meant just a hint of spice. To sum it all up, this was a great place to have standard but good Thai-ish food, and if you focus on some of the less fusion-y dishes like the curry, rice, and noodles, you will have a good dining experience.", "business_id": "wzKMb1WAJbBVO819P4nDUg", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-05-11", "type": "review"}

They chopped up the chicken in very small pieces and seemed overcooked.  I would stick with the different types of curries (red, green, yellow) though.  It's safer.  The curry sauce would seep into the meat and make it more tender. The curries can also be different textures.  I've had it where it's thick and creamy (the way I like it) or more watered down.  The lunch portions are pretty small, but I guess it's enough for a lunch meal.  \n\nBeware Swaddee's if you're not too comfortable with spicy.

In the mood for Thai and not ready to go to the same bland places I've been to, I reached out to Yelp yesterday and found Mint Thai.  Although the construction on the 101 made getting there tough, it was well worth the drive!\n\nWhen the 4 of us arrived, we were a little nervous. 7:15pm on a Saturday night there were only 2 cars in the parking lot. Once we got inside, we started to feel a little better as the Thai host greeted us. The decor was pretty common Thai...seemed dated but comfortable. \n\nTo start, we ordered some Tom Yum and  Tom Ka, both traditional and tasty, although we agreed that the Tom Ka was a bit richer in flavor.\n\nFor dinner, we ordered 4 dishes and all got thumbs up!\n\nGang Kew Wan....or Green Curry with Chicken...DEEEElicious. The peas, the basil, and the curry had great flavor.  We had ordered it medium and I think I would have preferred it Hot...but was able to spice it up with a little chili powder provided on the table. \n\nEggplant Pad Prik- eggplant, spicy garlic sauce and basil. Awesome flavors and balance\n\nLard Na w/ Beef- The noodles had great consistency, the beef and broccoli great flavor. The gravy was good but a little thinner than I've had in the past making it seem a little watery. The dish needed a little more heat but was still really good.\n\nPad Thai- Should be staple at any Thai place and Mint Thai's did not disappoint. Lots of layers and flavors. Sweet but not too sweet. Good size portion, lots of sprouts and onions and ample chopped peanuts on the side to mix in. Really good.\n\nIf looking for good Thai food without the need for a great deal of ambience and don't mind the strip mall idea, you should definitely check our Mint Thai!", "business_id": "RFeDe3fNr14kvUKlVx6_4w", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-04-19", "type": "review"}

Enjoyed the Mongolian beef (beef with onions, jalape\u00f1os, red pepper flakes, and something that looks like sweet potato leaves), but as always, I felt a little let-down when I bite into the pieces and did not find the satisfactory crunch of the caramelization of past Mongolian beef entrees I've had elsewhere.  I was looking forward to the ginger-hot spiciness of the green curry chicken, and while it was slightly underwhelming, which I'm sure is most likely from the fact that I'm suffering from a cold and could not taste all of the flavor notes, I was happy to be able to detect the ginger in the dish.  I loved the long beans in this entree, which also had basil, lemongrass, fresh chilies, shallots, galangal, garlic, and cilantro.  I had a taste of both dishes for lunch, and I would have to say that the beef was more flavorful- saltier, and definitely spicier!

They have a big menu to chose from! I have been here 6 times and have gotten different dishes each time and it never disappoints! There has been a few times that I have visited during HH, they really have an awesome HH. Happy hour offers Half off all appetizers,  that are flavorful and just the right amount. I always leave with leftovers. Service is really great too  :)", "business_id": "H7KzlC0-o1wIhlGg-Me5Ag", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-03-02", "type": "review"}

Because the Flo's at the Promenade DOES NOT compare to the Flo's on Thompson Peak. The food at the Promenade location is lacking. The Katsu was dry, the soup blah, and the meat was just bland. The service is awesome, which redeemed the visit (been there several times), but if you want the real experience, go hit up the Flo's on Thompson Peak.", "business_id": "H7KzlC0-o1wIhlGg-Me5Ag", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-03-06", "type": "review"}
