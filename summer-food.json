Maybe even decades...is that even possible?  Well, either way, it's been awhile.  So with my gift certificate I took my brother out for a birthday dinner.  \n\nAs I get older, my tolerance for things like crowds and youngsters gets lower and lower.  As a result, I told my brother to be ready by 4pm so we could head to the Waterfront before everyone goes out for date night.  Plus the Pirates were playing at 4:05 so we could enjoy our beers and the game.\n\nWhen we arrived, the bar side was already pretty packed but we were still able to get a table.  Our server was very attentive, friendly and helpful.  Right off the bat we both ordered samplers so we could try all of their beers.  We loved the fact that as she approached our table with a full tray of samples our server said, \"I have to go back for the rest.\"  In all we were served 10 different beers each (in 3 oz glasses, maybe 4 - I can never tell).  I gotta say, Rock Bottom knows their beer.  I liked more than I didn't, and very few were not to my liking.  So the $6.95 10 beer sampler was well worth it.  \n\nDuring our sampling we indulged on some Southwest Egg Rolls.  They were okay, but not quite what I expected.  The spicy ranch was top notch, though.  As we ran out of beer, we each ordered up a Kobe Burger.  They were both cooked exactly to our liking (medium).  And to top off our wonderful evening, the Pirates brought home a win!\n\nMy only complaint, as a beer drinker, is the cost for a growler.  The glass container itself is sold for $12.95.  That's the empty price.  To me, that's a little ridiculous when East End only charges $3 for the bottle and Penn Brewery $5.  Paying more for the bottle than the beer inside seems like insanity to me.  So I walked out empty handed.

I'd checked the website in advance to try and plan my meal since I do my best to pick items on menus that aren't, say, 2,000 calories in one sitting. Their website advertises that they make skinny drinks; when I asked my waiter he said it was possible but that they did not normally do this and that it's a hassle for the people at the bar, so he didn't recommend it. Then why tell us on your website that you'll do it??? \n\nAdditionally, while we had checked in advance when we made our reservation about bringing a birthday cake and the restaurant's ability to handle us lighting candles, apparently there was a break down in communication; we never got the candles we had asked for, and in fact the poor waiter struggled to even find a lighter before realizing there were no candles available. Obviously whatever error occurred wasn't the waiter's fault, and we definitely thanked him and tipped him well for doing the best that he could with what he had.\n \nOn a final note, this is also one of those places where if you ask for a medium rare burger, they will overcook it; I've started ordering medium rare on purpose specifically so that I get a medium cooked burger instead of medium well or well done.\n\nFinal verdict: go for the brews if you must, and the food's nice enough.

It came out hot and tasted awesome. They have a new Head Chef and it shows. I was floored...the new Street Food options are fun and tasty. They are unique and different...not something you'd find at any restaurants in the area.\n\nThe Service was good. My waitress was named Liz and she certainly was on point. She even helped me find a beer after I was sorely disappointed by the IPA offering...which was weird. I always thought the House Brews were tasty and fun, no matter their style or make. I'm an IPA girl, but I would happily drink anything that came from their taps. I was disappointed in the offerings, but I ended up settling on the Pale Ale that was quite tasty.\n\nIn the end, if you were turned off by Rock Bottom before, I'd definitely recommend going back to check out the Street Food and new menu offerings. Service has dramatically improved, food quality has improved,  and I was thrilled.", "business_id": "McikHxxEqZ2X0joaRNKlaw", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-06-04", "type": "review"}

This store is located next to one of the bike trails that I frequent, hence its convenience despite being fairly far from my apt.\n\nOn the positive side, I appreciate the size of this store and the selection of products.  In terms of size, it's larger than the Shadyside Market District (my normal grocery store, hence my standard of comparison), and I'd say the product selection is very similar.  Unlike the MD, when I've visited, the aisles have seemed fairly empty of customers, which may be due to the times of my visits (usually between 7-8pm), as well as the size of the store.  Because it's not a Market District, the prices are a bit less expensive, which is nice.\n\nOn the negative side, the checkout always seems to take forever due to slow customers and/or employees, despite that I've only purchased a couple of items at a time.  The \"express\" lanes move at the speed of molasses, and the self-checkouts are even worse.  Speaking of which, this store has *way* too many self-checkout lanes (about a third of the lanes), and the non-express ones with the belts are unintuitive.\n\nPrior to tonight, I would have awarded this store a rating of 4 or perhaps even 4.5.  However, checkout tonight was even more of a PITA than it usually is.  None of the normal express checkout lanes were staffed with cashiers, despite that I saw at least one employee loafing around talking to another.  So, I was forced to use one of the many self-checkout lanes.  Normally, I don't mind this, esp. when I'm only purchasing a couple of items, but the empty self-checkout lane that I spotted was one with a conveyor belt, and I couldn't figure out how to use it (not that it mattered, since I had only one item, but the self-checkout lanes must be operated using a very specific procedure--see below).  So, I moved over to one of the express self checkout lanes (similar to those in the Shadyside MD), which I knew how to operate.  However, I still managed to bungle the process since I forgot to scan my one item *before* I put it on the scale that doubles as a bagging station, so I had to wait for one of the ever-so-slow employees to come over and key in an authorization code so I could pay.\n\nI'm not sure if the self-checkout stands that GE uses are standard in the industry, since I've never used them anywhere else, but I *hate* the whole weighing/bagging process.  In order to use the self-checkout stations, each item must be scanned and then placed on the scale, and if the weight isn't correct for any reason (including using your own bag), an employee is summoned to check it.  I assume the intention is to prevent people from shoplifting, but (1) it's a major PITA for both customers and employees; (2) most of the employees (including the one I dealt with tonight) don't care, and just key the code without even looking at the error message explaining why they were summoned; and (3) I doubt most shoplifters pay for any of the items they're pilfering--they most likely just stuff them into their purse, clothes, etc. and walk out!  /rant\n\n3.5 stars.", "business_id": "eT5Ck7Gg1dBJobca9VFovw", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-08-28", "type": "review"}

I love that they have slices of many of their cakes and cheesecakes available for individual purchase.  I purchased an assortment of these to take to a dinner party and they were all gobbled up and it was a great way to allow everyone to try small bites of a variety of treats.  My personal favorite was the Chocolate Mousse cake because I love chocolate and it was sweet without being overly sweet, creamy, with the right balance of sweet and bitter from the chocolate.  I also sampled the tiramisu which was delicate with just a hint of espresso and the cream was perfect.  The best thing was that while the desserts were all obviously sweet they weren't so sweet that it was sickening as I've experienced with more commercial cakes from grocery or big box stores.  The other cakes that I bought and all of which the dinner attendees loved were the lemon cake, the oreo cheesecake, one called the sweet spot that had chocolate and peanut butter, and finally a white cake with chocolate frosting.  It is close to my neighborhood so I will definitely return the next time that I need baked goods for a special occasion.

Granted, it has the basics you need, and is 1 of the biggest in the city itself.  Finding things takes work.  My big gripe is that it has one of the weirdest and most illogical layouts that I've seen.  It actually takes time to find what you need as compared to most stores where once you are in there a few times, you easily find everything.  Parts of this store are diagonal and that causes you to go in every direction possible.  Here is a quick summary of the setup as it can be classified as a maze:\n\n1.) When you enter the store through the slow wide door, you go to the left and walk past the front registers to produce.  Normal enough.\n\n2.) From produce in front of you (a quasi L-shaped department), you take a quick left and go diagonally to the right to walk past the pharmacy.  Take a hard right down aisle 1 and then you hit the bakery.   \n\n3.)  From the bakery, you walk along a long meat wall.  Diagonally to the left, you'll find the service meat/seafood counters. And because how the wall goes diagonal to the left, the sign for Aisle 9 is facing diagonally to the right so you don't miss it because the 1 side is longer towards the back than the other. (Aisles 9-14 are almost twice as long as 1-8).\n\n4.) From meat, you have frozen straight back on a long back wall in its own cove.  A hard right (if you bypass frozen) brings you last to hot foods, the deli, and then facing in front of you, the Customer Service desk which is tucked away in a corner (not really visible when you walk in the store).\n\n5.) Once you pass the deli and customer service, take a hard right, then to the left (almost a U-turn) to the checkouts, and then you take a hard left to leave.\n\nMost of the other Giant Eagle stores are much more logical in how their aisles and deparment locations are set up.   You're not going every which way to try and find things.\n\nAlso, the service isn't that great as one of the other reviews said.  Given that, I would take Market District on Centre Ave or GE on Murray Ave over this store.\n\nHowever, for those who remember the Giant Eagle on Centre Ave at N. Craig St, nothing beats how BAD that store was.  There is a reason that store was nicknamed \"the dirty bird.\"  Compared to that North Oakland store that closed several years ago, Shakespeare St GE is light years ahead.", "business_id": "BG4N0V93wml9kaU6YYRxRA", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-06-09", "type": "review"}

I mean, who wants to walk around in the freezer section and then go through a smaller than usual end of the aisle to see, SURPRISE, the meat section hidden off in an area where they could have knocked down the wall so you didn't have to do a little dance to get to it.

She suggested the vegan BLT. I was hesitant, as I wanted something hearty and filling, and let me tell you this!... The sandwich totally did her smile and sales pitch justice. It pleased me like no other sandwich has ever done. I want to compliment every sandwich maker in that department, specifically Bethany, Eric, and Rick. They know when I walk in their direction from the Fresh Pack section that I'm looking for my second option of the BLT because the burrito isn't available. No matter how bananas and certifiably insane I might seem during my food shopping excursions, they always treat me with such dignity and respect.\n\nMonths have passed since my first BLT experience, and I was completely taken for another ride through satisfaction land during this past week when they offered to notify me \"the night before when the vegan tofu burritos are being made\" because they know how much I have my heart set on that beautiful meal on most days of the week. I can't say enough for Bethany and her team of prepared foods colleagues. \n\nAnd everyone else at the store is so helpful and nice, too! So kind! So informative! I love Whole Foods Market of Pittsburgh! AND, for icing on the review cake, they've even begun to carry Brad's Raw Pizza Kale Chips for dogs. So my dog is satisfied, too.

When I lived with my parents in forest hills it was worth the 15 to 20 minute drive to shop here. Lots and lots of organic produce. Everything you would need to stock your fridge and pantry plus lots of more exotic options too. Much of the produce comes in conventionally farmed and organic options so pay attention to the labels and signs if you're aiming for all organic. It is more expensive to shop here than most grocery stores but you really do get what you pay for. \nThe bulk section has lots of nuts, seeds, beans and grains.\nThe meat counter looks pretty great with some grass fed and organic options (a bit out of my price range for every day eating but its good to know its there for a special occasion). Their seafood counter is passable (that being said, I worked at Wholey's fish market for a while so I have really high standards when it comes to seafood. Not that Wholeys fish always meets my standards, but I'm used to huge variety and at least a few incredibly fresh options). Much of the seafood is previously frozen because it's out of season or exorbitantly expensive when fresh. I honestly can't believe people who shop at whole foods have any interest in irresponsibly farmed fish like tilapia and Chilean Atlantic salmon but they carry it nonetheless. \nStaff are friendly but can't always answer what you might think is a simple question. As in the bulk foods guy probably knows everything about the bulk foods but literally has no clue where you can find horseradish.\nSalad bar and hot foods are good and seam fresh. The sushi is passable if you're really in the mood for quick sushi. There's not a very big baked good section and I've never tried what they do have but my dad likes their cookies. \nI usually bike there now, but when I used to drive the parking lot was sort of a mess. Just be prepared to walk from the far end (I'm sure you'll all survive). \nLines at the registers can be long but seem to move fast.

Those two facts have nothing to do with each other--the period in question was close to the end of the first semester of my (super-)senior year, when my friends and I would stay in our studios all night working, haul ass out to Quiet Storm for ambrosia-caliber restorative tofu scramble and coffee, and go back to school bright-eyed and bushy-tailed for another day of class.  And then usually I'd take a three-hour nap after the first class.  But I'm sorry, what is it I'm reviewing here?\n\nThe Quiet Storm has absolutely the best tofu scramble I've ever had.  I'm an accomplished vegan eater (I get stuff in my mouth first try nine times out of ten), I've had the best scrambles New York and San Francisco have to offer.  Believe you me, Quiet Storm tops them all.  I wish I knew their secret recipe, but the part I do know--baking the tofu rather than just sauteeing it--makes a tremendous difference.  Come in on a lazy Sunday morning, get the Nothin' Fancy, and you will see for yourself just how good tofu can be.  On top of that, they are as vegan-friendly as can be, with earth balance for the toast; soy, rice, and almond milks; and a selection of specifically vegan mixed drinks and milkshakes.  Plus, sandwiches!  Get the spicy spinach and peanut butter wrap, ask for added tofu (planks not crumble), and be astonished yet again.\n\nAND AND, as a delicious cherry on top, they have theme brunches, fantastic theme brunches that show off the creativity and chops of the cooks here in a way that the regular menu can only hint at.  Check out their website and see when the next theme brunch is, and make a point of going.

It's a little out of the way, but once we got there, it's exactly the kind of place I want to live close to. It's spacious and relaxed; we sat there for two hours after eating our lunch and were not at all pressured to move on. It had a very good neighborhood vibe, and everyone working there knew the place and the area really well.\nThe drink options were pretty great- the coffee was just fine, but the ginger lemonade I ordered a couple hours after lunch was phenomenal. I wish I could have that more often. The food was great; there are lots of options and the portion sizes were exactly what I wanted. I had the Dagwood sandwich, which was a perfect mix of sweet, sour, and spicy with hummus, apples, hot peppers, cucumbers, and pickles... it came with an option of the side, and I had to try the mockamole. A big fan of guacamole myself, I was totally in doubt of a green pea-based mock version. I also really like peas, though, so I was open. And somehow they managed to make it work, and it really did taste very much like guac, with a slightly less heavy and maybe a bit grainier texture. But definitely worth a try. My friend had a wrap with curry and tofu and I honestly don't remember what else, but it was huge and really tasty. She chose the potato salad as her side, and it was the perfect imitation of German potato salad, so I was pretty happy. \nAll in all, if you're in Pittsburgh and feel a little lost... go to Zenith and Quiet Storm, and you will feel found.", "business_id": "PzG0XmAmtXFs6Fdnubf41g", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-06-02", "type": "review"}

Your wearing the same shirt that you wore yesterday dude.\"  \n\nThe Spectre of Laziness is a dick, but he was also right.  And to my surprise, nothing I had was bad at all.

I am pretty sure that three different cooks made our order, as the cooks were tag teaming the line while they were eating.\n \n4. Last, but not least... the volume level in the place was numbing. The guy working the counter kept on slamming the ice cream freezer door every time he made a milkshake, the music was some sort of Bjork style electronica that I am pretty sure was written to induce migraines and there were about 6 hippy couples letting their kids run wild.\n \nI have been to plenty of vegetarian restaurants in my travels and Quiet Storm does not even come close to the top 10.

The meat is layered just perfectly on it and they don't slather on the condiments (presentation is every bit as good as taste, folks).

After we figured that out by following another patron, we were really excited to walk through the doors. \n\nIf you've never been into a co-op, you should know that they are typically smooshed together and have an interesting smell that emanates from the bulk-spices isle. I love this smell. It's really the best grocery store smell, EVER.\n\nProceeding through the store we noticed the colorful and abundant produce section. So many beautiful fruits, veggies and herbs. The prices varied, but they were probably on par with what you would pay for any other organic produce somewhere else. \n\nWhen we found the back area with hot foods, cold foods and the smoothies...I died of happiness. There were so many wonderful things back there. The food bar is $7.99 a pound, which is a lot cheaper than some places! The smoothies were all very tasty sounding, but I settled on a smoothie with soy ice cream, strawberries and papaya juice. Oh, my, god. It was so delicious! My boyfriend got the King smoothie, and he really enjoyed his too.\n\nRight beside the smoothie bar there is a section for all kinds of books. My eye was caught by an organic and local homebrewing book. It is now on my list of must haves! \n\nThe rest of the store was great. I especially love the cheese selection (we bought AMAZING and LOCAL tomato-basil havarti), the vegan meat products and the prices. \n\nI'll definitely be coming here a lot more. It's a great little co-op, and it is definitely the best I have been in!", "business_id": "-iVcmhjfq79QoTWzrb6pKg", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-07-11", "type": "review"}

Also worth while is their ground beef (we easily go through a couple of lbs of ground beef a week between the two of us).

After trying to match the names with some of the ice creams in the freezers I ultimately went with a single scoop of birthday cake ice cream in a dish.  Whenever they say scoop here, they really mean scoop as there was no extra bit that I feel that you often get, not that I needed it.  Overall I was impressed with the flavor of my ice cream and think that it may have been better than the normal chain that I go to.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would definitely stop back here again in the future.  The employees were friendly, the ice cream good and I was impressed with their selection.", "business_id": "LV_OCiR9rOHVHgdhbpqw2Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-07-11", "type": "review"}

Annie and I are at Ross Park mall walking around trying to figure out our lunch destination when serendipitously her phone rings and it's her Dad, \"Brother Len\" calling to ask us to lunch at this hidden gem.  Nice!  I prefer not to make decisions on the weekend.  Next we are headed down to the strip on a relatively pleasant saturday afternoon.  The locals are out en masse and parking is at a premium.  In keeping with our serendipitous saturday theme we find prime parking right in front of Kaya (another one of our favs').  We walk towards \"Labad's grocery\".  Now, I've been to this grocery before and have certainly walked by it numerous times and had never known of the little cafe located in the back of the grocery.  Len's been a regular here for years and is friends with the lovely syrian family who own the joint.  We walk into the back room which is exactly what I was hoping for in that it was very small a few tables, middle eastern decorations on the wall and a cozy somewhat seperate room which had for some reason multiple stuffed animals next to the table.  There also was a sheet hanging blocking something from view and if I'm to believe Len it was a camel :-).  Annie and I have a seat with Len who is sitting with the patriarch of this family \"Fayed\" I believe his name is.  Fayed has to leave to tend to the store and multiple operations occurring.  One of the sons is selling \"shish kabob\" on the sidewalk.  This is also a grocery store with sidewalk sales and of course the small cafe in the back.  I love the entrepreneurial spirit of first generation immigrants.  Len orders me up some coffee.  It was a very strong version of coffee served in a tiny mug.  I'm guessing their version of espresso.  Len takes care of ordering, which is good because I can't claim to be a middle eastern food connoiessur and tend to be lost after I exhaust the hummus and gyro options.  He orders us some type of platter, not sure the name of the platter itself but can describe the offerings.  I liked the metal plate that all of this food was served.  It was a large round plate sectioned off for each dip/option.  It was served with warm pita bread.  I like family style dining and this platter certainly encouraged sharing.  Now, the only thing that I was familiar with was the hummus and the black olives.  The hummus was as good as any I've ever had.  It was very authentic mashed chickpeas blended with olive oil, lemon and garlic.  It was really good served with the pita chips.  The olives were really good briny small black olives served with the pit.  The other sides were Baba Ganoug, which is really good eggplant dip with oil, garlic and pepper.  I have tried this in the past and really didn't like it.  I really liked this, so I guess the stuff I had in the past wasn't authentic.  Now, one of the two new things I had and probably my favorite was the shanklish salad, which isn't the type of salad you may be thinking of.  There was no lettuce,  but instead homemade aged cheese that is very good and delicate.  The salad also consisted of onions, tomatoes and oil.  It was great.  The final side of this dish wsa the macdoose, which I had never tried before.  It is eggplant pieces stuffed with walnuts and drowned in olive oil.  This wasn't my favorite, but I found myself however I kept eating it, so I guess I must have thought it was okay.  This would have been a great vegetarian meal (first time I've ever said that sentence) if I stopped there.  But, Len also ordered me a skewer of lamb.  At first it was a bit undercooked, but one of the sons (Lawrence?) grabbed it and grilled it for a few more minutes and then it was more to my liking.  I really like lamb and grilled with middle eastern seasonings is a treat with a little pita and some onions and tomatoes.  Annie had a skewer of grilled chicken, which also was seasoned nicely and cooked well.  Throughout the lunch we were greeted like family from other members of the family including \"Mama\" who you just want to wrap up and take home with you.  The guy on the grill (another son can't recall name) also was very warm and friendly and had this killer \"handlebar\" mustache.  Fayed stopped back after we were done with lunch and spent some time chatting with us.  He is a really interesting guy and a true renaissance man with vocations that have included the military, principal in school, chef amongst other things.  One of the most interesting things I found about this guy is that in spite of being a syrian christian part of his history includes teaching the koran to the bedouin (nomadic desert dwelling arab group). A couple other notes Len who knows this type of food says it's the best authentic middle eastern food in Pittsburgh.  Next time I'm there I will definitely try the kibbee, which is spiced ground beef w/pine nuts and stuffing. It's a favorite and you can get it raw if you order in advance.  That would be adventorous.", "business_id": "9D4PMia-8WqCYXnr7TM0Pw", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-07-12", "type": "review"}

La Prima Espresso in the Strip District gets one.  :(\n\nThey've got a good coffee but I will never be back, bc the older woman who is the barista in the morning was unforgivably rude, without reason.\n\nThe coffee is good, I would have liked to become a regular, but I dont want to start every morning dealing with her nasty attitude.  Yesterday she rolled her eyes at me when I asked for lots of room for cream.\n\nI am a former barista.  I *know* asking for room for cream is not one of the more difficult special requests she gets!  If you hate the public, you shouldn't work with them.\n\nThis morning takes the cake, and I just won't be back.  Here's what happened:  \n\nI walked in, and she was talking to a gentleman who was obviously a regular.  Because she was busy and bc I've barista'd myself, I waited patiently.\n\nAnd waited and waited.  It was a few minutes, but an eternity when you really need coffee!\n\nShe never even looked at me.  Then all of a sudden she goes, \"Okay lady are you going to stand there or do you want coffee?\"  \n\nWTF.  I liked her sense of urgency, but seriously?  Rude.\n\nI asked for a medium coffee in a large cup, or if that's not possible, a medium coffee with lots of room. \n\nNot hearing me, she goes, \"What was that?\" and the older gentleman said, \"She wants a medium sized coffee in a large cup.\"  And the woman turns to me and snaps, \"And you couldn't repeat that yourself?\"\n\nEven the guy she was talking to, her regular, was like, \"Whoa.\"  He tried to make some excuse for her, like, \"She's just fired up today!\"  Then the woman slams my coffee down on the counter.  \n\nWas she having a bad day?  Am I the doppleganger of someone she hates?  I dont know, I don't care.  I believe she may be the owner because surely she should have been fired by now, as there are other posts with complaints about her. \n\n\"Do not go here during the week if you expect them to open on time.

Jovial, pleasant, and ready/willing/able to discuss her collection of confections at length it turned out that her original frustration was due to a downed credit card machine and getting the runaround from the IT folks over the phone.\n\nBrowsing the shop while Amy dealt with the folks via phone we stood in awe of the diversity of the collection Aero bars from Canada, Amadei from Italy, and even Hershey from right up the road.  Vintage to current, house made to international, gums, cookies, caramels,  and...Capogiro gelato.  Already full of Pamela's fantastic breakfast we debated (briefly) whether ice cream before 10am was a good idea - a unanimous yes.  Selecting two scoops at a somewhat pricey $4.25 our choices were Cappuccino and Cioccolato Scuro (\"Bitter.\")  Having heard great things about Capogiro but not yet making it to Philadelphia all I can say is that the rumors are true - the flavors were superb, the texture like silk, and the weight light and appealing...the Scuro literally tasted like brownie batter without the doughy texture.\n\nSelecting a few creamy salted caramels, a small bag of housemade chocolate covered blueberries, and a few gifts to take home to my aunt we settled the bill and bid Amy good luck with the tech support.

My friend and I sat on stools right by the counter and enjoyed looking all around as we ate (Chocolate Delight sundae--with chocolate whipped cream!--for me, and an orange soda ice cream float for her).  \n\nSometimes I feel awkward taking photos inside eateries, but felt comfortable here as I snapped pictures of the old school phone booths (just decorative) and the glass cases filled with relics.  This also seems like a good place to check out if you want some old-timey candy that's otherwise hard to find.", "business_id": "kj3qws3WSMgOotUeACSdFA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-06-27", "type": "review"}

You felt like you were walking back into time a little before, with the old knickknacks everywhere and the family running the show. The menu also used to be pretty expansive. It wasn't my favorite ice cream ever, but the atmosphere was awesome, so we'd stop in from time to time and embrace the calorie splurge.\n\nUnfortunately, with the original family selling the business, the only carryovers seem to the building itself and the name...and that cool milkshake machine. Aside from that, I was so bummed after leaving this last time...like the soul of the business was gone. The menu was very basic, and the employees, while new for the most part, didn't seem to know what they were doing. I'm sure this will improve over time, but unfortunately, I'm not sure how they're going to replace the true competitive advantage that they had over other sweets shops around...atmosphere.\n\nThe one positive is that the new ice cream, itself, is better than the Hershey's they were selling before the business closed, and it's great that they have accessible hours now. Being open consistently, and later, is a huge bonus. I'm sure we'll return to see how it's doing, but if you're a fan of the old Klavon's, you might be a little disappointed.

I'd been meaning to visit Klavon's again since it'd been a year since I'd last visited, so I suggested it, and my friend, who'd never been before, was game.\n\nI usually order a soda or float when I'm here, since this is the only place in PGH I know that makes them.  However, most of the flavors were fruity, and I was in the mood for some chocolate, so I decided to go with a sundae instead.  I ordered a regular sized peanut butter M & M sundae, which the woman serving me (who I assume is the proprietor) described as consisting of two regular sized scoops of ice cream.  It was huge!  The ice cream was vanilla with streaks of peanut butter, and the sundae had warm peanut butter and M & M pieces spooned into it.  The ice cream was very creamy and delicious, and there were no problems with freezer burns this time.  Overall, the sundae was great, if not quite what I was expecting.  Other than the M & M's, it lacked chocolate (I had assumed that the ice cream would be chocolate ice cream with peanut butter swirls), which was disappointing since I was looking for more of a chocolate peanut butter combo.  However, to be fair, this was more of an expectation issue on my part since the description of the sundae didn't say anything about chocolate ice cream or fudge, so I can't blame the proprietor for this.  Word to the wise: If you're seeking more chocolate, you may want to have them add some hot fudge!\n\nMy friend ordered the orange creamsicle ice cream soda, which consisted of vanilla ice cream and orange soda, and she enjoyed it very much. The only thing slightly amiss with it was that when she first started sipping it, the ice cream shifted, causing the soda to fizz up and overflow the mug. Since I'd been wanting to try this flavor, I asked her if I could have a sip and she obliged.  The flavor was very good, and I'd definitely order it when I return.\n\nService was friendly, if a bit slow.  The current owner has done a great job of maintaining the decor, down to the penny candy (I saw it this time!) and phone booths.  The only thing conspicuously missing is the scale, which I assume the original owner's family kept as a personal keepsake--but this is probably a good thing for dieters who'd rather not be reminded of their indulgence (ahem, cough, cough).

My first instinct wasn't to leave so that is always a good thing. \n\nCustomer service (5/5): I went there because my husband randomly missed Spain so he wanted to make a bunch of mini bocadillos with different types of meat and cheeses. We already got the meat from another place down the street so what better place to get a variety of cheeses than the Macaroni co? The lady that helped us was wonderful!! She was so patient with us even though there were a million people waiting in line.  She automatically knew which cheese to recommend based on what would compliment the meat that we had. She was extremely knowledgeable about the various kinds of cheese. I could seriously listen to her talk all day about the history of the cheese... she made it so interesting.  My husband is VERY indecisive so he couldn't figure out which one he liked more. \n\nFood (4/5): We tried at least 7 different kinds of cheese and I didn't like any of them... definitely not a cheese person. My husband on the other hand, LOVED every single one of them! We also went there for some Rustic Italian or any hard shelled bread. I know this is not the store's fault be there needs to be a sign that says, \"Do NOT touch the actual bread unless you are buying it!!!\" I saw at least 3 people who were squeezing the bread with their dirty hands to see if it was soft. Totally grossed me out. Why would anyone think that is okay?!?! I can understand if you are squeezing the bread through the bag but don't TOUCH it! That is only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.

While somewhat disorganized, the cheese counter is my favorite place to start. You do have to buy a minimum weight of any type of cheese, however, I believe it's 1/4 of a pound, which is the perfect amount to keep around for snacking I have found. The customer service, even without \"Dear Heart\" is still stellar, and they have always let me sample anything I wanted to try before buying. What else goes perfectly with cheese? No, not crackers (IMO) but olives! They have buckets and buckets of bulk olives you can choose from-stuffed olives and plain. They have a bread section with Breadworks items and several vats of olive oil so you can buy a large amount. There is a small section stocked with fresh produce in the back near the registers. They have a whole section, as well, dedicated to all types of spices-the smells are intoxicating!

I had been wanting to try Pitaland since I first saw it on the boulevard and was excited to finally make it there.  Whenever we finally made it inside, it was not what I had expected but in a good way.  The store was super clean, bright and open with an olive bar, central aisle of grocery items, deli and then a food counter with bar seats.  They also have some tables outside so that you eat there if the weather is nice.\n\nFor my lunch entree I decided to go with the chicken shawarma in the donor size while my father went with the gyro in donor size.  While we were ordering I noticed a rather clever tip jar sign that had something to do with \"pita\" spelled backwards.  After placing our order we decided to sit inside at the counter on this day since the sun and humidity outside would have made for a miserable experience.  After only a few minutes of waiting, our lunches were handed over to us.  My chicken shwarma came out to me on a large pita with lettuce, pickle, onion, tomato and what I think was a a garlic mayo sauce?  The size of the pita was pretty large and I knew that by the time I was finished that I wouldn't need anything else.  Sadly I was disappointed with the sandwich and that mainly had to do with the chicken.  Since it was done rotisserie style I thought that meant that the meat would be good and moist.  However, it ended up being super dry and seemed to be overcooked as well.  The rest of the sandwich ended up being good though and I really enjoyed the larger pickles that were in my pita.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I might head back here again in the future.

I spend a lot of time there studying,  and I find the baristas (do they call people who work at coffee shops that aren't Starbucks that??) there to be just about the unhappiest lot I've ever encountered.  I try not to fault them TOO much for this, as I've worked retail before (though never food service, and I am completely aware that food service may very well be worse), and they probably deal with a lot of grade A d-bags (am I allowed to say that here?) in Shadyside.  But still.  I always go out of my way to be polite to them, and I come in nearly everyday, despite the coffee (which I agree is very 'meh'... watery and just basically pretty average, if not slightly below) and HORRIBLE pastries/desserts.  (Seriously, they taste like they've been around since the place opened.)  But never a flash of recognition, of any sort of 'hey this girl's usually pretty nice and polite so maybe when she quite benignly asks for a cup of ice in addition to her $4 iced soy-vanilla latte+tip, I shouldn't practically roll my eyes at her.'  Nothing like that.\n\nSo, why do I come here everyday?  For the same reason other people must come here, too... the people-watching and melding of inside/outsideness in the place.  It IS pretty lame that the internet isn't free, and especially with how Crazy Mocha has apparently hopped onboard with UPMC to takeover the city, you'd think CTR would at least want to keep up with the competition.  But, with a purchase, you still get 2 hours access, so that does go a bit of a ways in making up for it.\n\nIn terms of the wait for tables, I've never found it to be quite as bad as a few on here have said.  I've never had to wait longer than 3 or 4 minutes for a table, and especially if you're by yourself and only have a book or something, people are generally pretty nice about letting you share their table until one opens up.  \n\nSo, in summary, if you are a coffee snob, this probably isn't your place... if you're any other kind of snob, though, make sure you walk by the place a few times with your oversized sunglasses, gladiator sandals, & Sephora bag, carrying your Cavalier King Charles Spaniel puppy in your purse, so us scrubby kids taking up tables in the Coffee Tree have a chance to gawk at you for awhile.", "business_id": "1qUYk564SajvwTtkNM6KJA", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-07-22", "type": "review"}

Fresh air comes in continuously, and you can enjoy sipping your coffee and getting some work done while watching people pass by on the sidewalk of Walnut Street and in the coffee shop.  In fact, that is exactly what I am doing right now. The coffee shop shines especially during the summer, as a result of the open-air seating in the sitting area close to the sidewalk. \n\nEvenings and weekends can get very crowded and finding a seat in the best parts of the shop can be problematic. The back side of the coffee shop is much less exciting at least for me: not as much fresh air and a low ceiling. Although, they do have a fireplace and seemingly cozy couches in the gray area between the back and the front, which I assume would be great for conversation on a cold winter day with the right set of friends. \n\nThat they are open relatively late (until midnight) is a plus...

Driving though the streets of Pittsburgh up to Walnut Street the GPS alerted us that a programmed destination was close and our plans changed - Prantl's would be dessert, instead.  Ever intrigued by restaurants, shops, bakeries, and cafes that become infamous for a single item (see Haydel's in NOLA or Patisserie Claude in NYC) I felt it necessary to see if the Burnt Almond Torte lived up to the hype.\n\nParking at a Premium at this time of day I hopped out while the others circled the block.  Entering the small shop and finding no less than 7 people waiting in line I grabbed a number and browsed the selections - 5 full cases ranging from whole cakes to single iced cookies and everything in between.  With 5 servers behind the counter the line moved quickly and it would be a matter of minutes before I had to make a decision - opting for three items that spanned a wide range I paid the modest $6 tab and made my way outside.\n\nOpening the string-tied box the smell of cinnamon quickly filled the air announcing to everyone my first selection - a still-slightly-warm Cinnamon roll.  Ample, yeasty, and loaded with butter and Cinnamon I quite liked that the pastry was not overly-iced, instead focusing on the more nuanced flavors and natural yeasty flavor of the roll.  While my sister contested it would have been better hot (I can't say I disagree) it was an excellent pasty none the less.\n\nThe second selection was ordered more out of tradition than out of necessity - a chocolate cupcake with colorful sugary frosting.  Having not yet indulged on a cupcake in our Pittsburgh trip I can't say this option looked particularly interesting, but tradition is tradition and surprisingly it was actually quite good.  Simple white on black cake, moist and sweet - nothing new, but certainly an adequate cupcake for $0.99.\n\nThe final choice was obviously the Burnt Almond Torte - a single \"Bar\" for $3.25.  Large and heavy I was expecting to have my mind blown given the reviews all I can say is that the rumors are true.  Somewhat Twinkie, somewhat Pound Cake, smooth and complex custard plus whipping cream, and sugar laden almonds cooked to just short of scorched.  Crispy, creamy, crispy, creamy - layer upon layer of home style decadence.  Sharing the bar around the car (and making a mess) everyone agreed that this was one of the best baked goods we'd ever experienced - and an absolute bargain at that.  Really, much like King Cake in NOLA and Pizza in Chicago  I can't imagine going back to Pittsburgh and not getting a slice of Burnt Almond Torte from Prantl's.", "business_id": "yWVY1Bq19lDxu3BP7_96EQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-07-06", "type": "review"}

I can't say much for their other treats as I have partaken in few. However, the Burnt Almond Torte will not disappoint..unless you do not have a palate.\n\nI keep the logic with food simple- if a place is \"famous\" for serving a specific item then try it. In this instance, the Burnt Almond Torte is a heaven sent delight. The two layers of moist light yellow cake suspended creamy rich custard, covered in lightly sweetened and fluffy pastry cream with an outer layer crusted with toasted sweet glistening almonds. \n\nI am thankful I did not discover this dessert until I was married. I would have easily polished off this cake after a rough exam or breakup. Fortunately, my husband can share the caloric intake with me. Then again, for those with more self-control they offer a significantly smaller ration in the petit four style presentation. I have also had the pleasure of tasting this version which did not disappoint.\n\nNow for some other items on the shelves. ..the brownies look much more appetizing than they are in reality. The chocolate lacks richness and depth and the batter is drowning in nuts. It is one thing to highlight a brownie in nuts, it is another to forget you are even eating something other than chopped nuts. I've also had a few of their cookies. Hrmp. Nothing bad but nothing good that was memorable either.  I say stick with the torte. \n\nAlso, I must note that the wedding cake tasting is a complete disaster. No worries, I did not deduct points as I might have caught them on a bad day and I did not try the cake. Whilst still engaged two years ago...Prantl's was my top choice until I arrived for the tasting. Imagine many brides in such a small area and limited staff to assist- provided a cow-herd atmosphere to the tasting. Not my thing- I walked in and walked right back out.

As a regular bakery.  I absolutely love going to either this or the downtown location to pick up some \"cake bites\" or any of the other delicious items they create.  I will say stray away from the traditional non-sugar coated items (muffins, etc.), which while good, don't compare to other offerings around the city.\n\n2.)  As the bakery who baked our wedding cake.  When it came down to it, I knew from the beginning that I was doomed to have a Prantl's Burnt Almond Torte as our wedding cake.  This unassuming, simply decorated, flavor powerhouse is the epitome of love it/hate it relationships of those in the burgh...  and I happen to be on the love it side.  Our cake ended up being ABSOLUTELY fantastic.  Definitely not a looker, but man did she please.\n\nWhat didn't please us is the customer service.  After placing the order for the wedding cake at the Shadyside location, the wife and I followed up with a question at the Market Square location (we both work downtown and were told we could modify our order there for convenience).  What ensured was what I can only describe as a sales commission war, with the bridal rep downtown more or less abducting us from the Shadyside location and even calling us to complain when we didn't call her directly thereafter.  Up until we first saw the cake the day of the wedding, we honestly weren't even sure what we were getting (we had to actually calculate the bill for the rep downtown...  yea.).\n\nDespite all of this, I just simply can't bash the cake.

The combination of textures was the most unique I've ever tasted in a cake, and between the fluffiness, creaminess, and crunchiness, it was oh-so-satisfying.

The cake literally melted in my mouth--no chewing was necessary, except for the topping.\n\nAs the icing on the cake (no pun intended!), the cake was beautifully decorated with colorful icing flowers and piped script, which brightened up the cake and made it a pleasure to behold.

Each night on your pillow a menu card appears; check off what you'd like in the morning, what time you'll be eating, and drop it off in the dining room.  The next day, Jackie is ready and waiting with a fresh fruit plate, the pastry of the day, and fantastically strong and flavorful coffee.  Omelets and fritattas are made with local produce and eggs.  Irish oatmeal is served with milk from a nearby creamery.  Toast bread changes daily but is always whole-grain and delicious.  Breakfast meats are lean and filling.  \n\nAfternoons, iced tea and cookies are set out, and in the evenings wine and cheese served.

Let me start with the amazing duo of Cindy (coordinator) and Liz (owner) who both made this luncheon/tea an occasion to remember.

No detail unconsidered. Including the amazing tea. ::: Now, I can't forget to review the food which was not only exceptional, but perfectly plated. Finger sandwiches, scones, mini patisseries, all brought out to enjoy at your leisure. We loved those scones so much, with the creme fresh and homemade jam, Chef Albert gave each of us scone recipes and talked us through ingredient substitutions if needed. ::: Bottom line is, If you live in Pittsburgh and overlook this gem, you're foolish.

I actually like the rest of the store.\n\nWe had previously arranged for an appointment to talk with the cake department, but when we arrived, we were told that the cake decorator had left for the day without plans to return.   We were then shuttled to talk with the event planning department about cake pricing options.   The event planner was cold, and odd, and definitely not in a good mood.  (For brevity and to protect her anonymity, I'll call her stormy.)\n\nStormy then gave us a wedding cake catalog with decorating ideas and pricing.  This is a bit of an overstatement, actually, since they make it intentionally difficult to figure out the price, hiding charges in five or six components and not being clear about any of them.\n\nI went to ask for help from stormy, but imagine my surprise when I found she was busy frantically scribbling a letter to Giant Eagle H.R. about how she absolutely can't get along with another person in her department and how they were always cold and frosty with each other and storming in and out of workplaces when they were around each other.  I didn't see the whole letter, but that was the gist of it.  As I was trying to ask a question, stormy excused herself and said she \"had to get something for us.\"   She took the hand written letter away and came back a good while later, having delivered her letter but not with anything to help us with our search.\n\nEventually, a replacement cake decorator came to our table with samples (good cake, by the way.)  The replacement decorator apologized for the \"drama in the department,\" which I appreciated.  We asked her to help us decipher the pricing, and she gave us some quotes, but then stormy said those quotes were no good, and she would have to look them up in her book.  And then stormy herself became confused and couldn't figure out how much a particular cake would be, since they seem to have recently instituted a more expensive pricing structure.\n\nBetween the two employees, they weren't sure if filling was extra or not, and if it was extra, much it would cost.  Same with whether the cake structure could be modified, and if so, how much that would cost.  They weren't sure how many servings were in a particular cake, (which seems to have changed recently) and thus, how much it would actually cost.  \n\nBut the general gist is that the cakes are overpriced and about 40% more than local bakeries.   \n\nThe sad thing is that we really liked the cake there, and we would have liked to buy it from Giant Eagle.  But considering the ordering drama, we couldn't trust them to deliver a good wedding cake, so we ordered somewhere else.", "business_id": "Tfysaq2SdZAc5_TyPpuyLA", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-08-26", "type": "review"}

Coming from Central PA, I have a soft spot in my heart for Wegmans.  It's the best grocery store I know, and I'm a little sad that they haven't worked their way into Pittsburgh. I know Giant Eagle well from growing up in Erie and having lots of family in Pittsburgh, though.\n\nThat being said, the Giant Eagle Market District on Centre is A-OK.  While it feels a bit cramped (aisles are a little narrow) and I could see parking being an issue on a busy afternoon, I have had two pretty good experiences picking up essentials.  For a grocery store on a pretty small geographic footprint, there is a lot of selection.  In addition to the organic and whole-food options that other reviewers have mentioned, there is also the usual choices of Giant Eagle brand products.  It's a store where you can get exotic, boutique items . . . but you can also pick up the usual suspects.  I'm sure they are keeping an eye on the Whole Foods a few blocks away and striving to be more accessible and affordable, while also drawing customers with more upscale tastes.\n\nStaff members at this Giant Eagle really set the place apart.  I had two good interactions with employees today (one in the meat department, and one in the grocery area).  I've seen plenty of smiling faces and people being eager to help shoppers find things.

Let me see, perhaps because I lack a car and you're the most conveniently located grocery store, a mere 2 mi. from my apartment and on the route of the 71A & C? No, let's be honest here: the real reason is because I'm too cheap to shop at the \"whole paycheck,\" Trader Joe's is too inconvenient, and the product selection at Aldi is limited.\n\nOn the positive side, this store is larger and fancier than the grocery store I grew up with, and the cheese and bulk foods sections are impressive (the latter includes a make-your-own trail mix bar!). They also have a lot of prepared foods, and though I don't often buy them, the quality of those I've tried has been high (esp. the fried chicken!). This store has a wide selection of groceries, ranging from the inexpensive (Valu Time) to the pricey (organic and natural foods), so, like Barnum's circus, there's something here for everyone.  On the weekends, store employees often hand out food samples, and there are sometimes cooking demos at the test kitchen near the seafood section.\n\nOn the negative side, the employees working the checkout lines are often taciturn or surly, and the crowds in here on the weekends are a force to be reckoned with.  The aisles are narrow to the point of awkwardness when passing other shoppers. Product placement is unintuitive to the point that I often have to ask employees for assistance when locating an item I don't usually buy. Also, as others have mentioned, the produce--particularly the loose green vegetables--is often of questionable quality. Compared to Trader Joe's and Aldi et al., the prices are on the higher side, though they still look like a deal next to Whole Foods.\n\nThankfully, because I don't have a car, I don't have to deal with the parking situation, which I'm reminded of when I come here in a car with a friend on occasion. However, I do have to schlep my groceries across the street and onto the bus, which is equally annoying.

In addition to the wedding cake, the package includes cookies, 5 extra specialty cakes and chocolate covered strawberries.

I don't know why Pittsburgh has allowed Giant Eagle to basically have a monopoly on groceries in this city. Yeah, sure, we have some smaller niche grocers and a few low-cost players that have moved into town recently, but let's face it -- in the all-encompassing big supermarket space, there really is no true competition. The market pretty much belongs to Giant Eagle. What I wouldn't give for Wegman's to expand into the Burgh...but I digress.\n\nLimited competition means that Giant Eagle stores can be consistently subpar and people will shop there anyway. Ok, so to be fair, this Giant Eagle isn't among the worst locations as far as Giant Eagles are concerned -- the South Side and Squirrel Hill locations that I used to frequent take that honor. So I'll give this location an extra star for not being the suckiest of a sucky chain of stores. But even this supposed 'nicer' Giant Eagle still doesn't cut it in the grand scheme of supermarkets.\n\nMy main beefs? First and foremost (and this applies to all GEagles) -- the prices. The prices are downright insulting. Yeah, yeah, sometimes they have sales (oh boy, how nice of them!), which take their sky-high prices and bring them down to what most other grocery stores would charge on a normal day. So I hope that your shopping list contains nothing but items on \"sale,\" because otherwise you're out of luck. \n\nSecond, this location seems to consistently be out of stock of basic items every time I come in here. Just yesterday I went in for two things -- baby spinach and sandwich wraps. Two things. And BOTH items were out of stock. I'm sorry, I know that it's the weekend and it's busy, but how about you try to keep up with demand? Is that too much to ask? This is not the first time I've gone in for just a few items and have left without them because the shelves were empty. For a store the size of Giant Eagle, I expect more.\n\nThird, I've personally had issues with meat quality here. Specifically, I've found their Nature's Basket chicken breast to be consistently tough and stringy -- almost inedible. The first time, I thought maybe I just got a bad batch. The second time, I started to get suspicious about the quality. And the third time (several weeks later) when it still had the nasty texture issues, I vowed to never buy chicken there again (and I haven't). As a dubious ex-president once said, \"Fool me once, shame on me. Fool me -- you can't get fooled again.\"\n\nLastly, I've had some really poor customer service experiences at this location. For example, the latest instance came about a month ago. When we went to check out, my hubby put his basket on the conveyor belt without emptying it. Now I used to work at a grocery store when I was a teenager, and I would get frustrated when people were too lazy to put their items on the belt. It's annoying, I get it. I really do. But my hubby didn't know any better. And when this would happen to me as a cashier (which was often), I would smile and take the items out of the basket one by one and scan them (albeit secretly cursing the customer in my head). But Kayla, our cashier? She gave a pissed-off sigh, rolled her eyes....and then literally took the basket, held it pointedly up about a foot or two over the belt, and deliberately dumped it upside down so everything came crashing down at once. We had some fragile things in there (strawberries, blueberries, and eggs) that were damaged from the impact. Completely unacceptable!\n\nSigh. I have countless additional stories about how awful Giant Eagle is, but my fingers are getting tired, and if Yelp doesn't already have a word limit, they would probably consider putting one into place if I keep going.  :)  \n\nOk, one last thing, and then I'm outta here, I swear. They are currently renovating this location to be a Market District (slated to open in early 2015), so we can all look forward to that. Sorry, GEagle, but you ain't foolin' anyone -- you can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig. \n\nAll right, now I'm really done.  :)", "business_id": "AK8T92URfkOUoTAVd7l2EA", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-08-17", "type": "review"}

I remember when it was a sleepy little town prior to 485 with Butler Animal Hospital, Mamma Rosa's and the BK Lounge.  \n\nGracious, they could have planned that highway / intersection anyway they wanted.  Would love to pummel the traffic flow planners with ball peen hammer. . .but I digress.  \n\nStaff generally pretty nice.  Drive-through ok, not crazy fast but not terrible either.\n\nThey make a good cup of Joe if you're on that side of town.  Surprised Starbucks moved in after Bagel Place.  It's just a TERRIBLE traffic flow.  \n\nGiving it a 3* for the staff and good coffee.  I'd give it -5* for location and lack of ease to obtain same.", "business_id": "VUjsoKN5kv5TNcNDbRo-ZQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-08-13", "type": "review"}

So I can't really complain about such trivialities as parking (parking sucks all around here, so while the complaints are valid, I couldn't care less) and the fact that it gets crowded and busy. More on that in a bit. But when you walk into a particular Starbucks and the baristas not only know what you favor every day - in my case, a grande Misto w/non-fat milk - but also have it ready before you reach the wait counter.\n\nThe great news about this location is the recent renovation, which sucked for me considering I was without a workday coffee fix for exactly 10 business days, and when you have to rely on that shitty-assed Keurig-brewed coffee I have to endure at home, or force yourself to walk from Gateway to N. Tryon on a spectacularly and stupidly hot afternoon, which, by the way, I'd rather suck on a wet and frayed towel than have to walk 6 city blocks in 95-degree weather just for a delicious cup of coffee...oh shit, where was I? The renovation, right. The biggest complaint was the lack of space at this location, and when folks were getting their fix between 8-10am and 2-4pm, you know this spot would get crazy crowded, and you really couldn't move around without accidently brushing someone's ass, and then have to wait for some slow poke to finish languidly stirring their mocha choca latta yay extra soy 5-pump coffee, it got pretty frustration. Thankfully, the renovation has not just created a better use of space - there's a nice and cozy sitting spot in the back - but it's even cheerful-looking, in a rustic sort of way. \n\nAnd then there's Sarah, the shift manager, a pint-sized, smart-ass (I love smart-asses) that runs a tight ship but makes everyone feel like they're the most important customer ever. The whole staff is great, friendly even, but Sarah is the shit.\n\nNot all Starbucks are created equal, but this location works just fine for me.

On a Saturday around noon, the place was basically deserted except for 2 other people.  JWU is out for the summer, all of the suits were probably at Lake Norman tied to a boat and drunk, so there were just a few souls out and about at this end of Uptown.\n\nWe were within walking distance, heading back to the Gateway parking deck after our tour, and I was in need of something to drink ASAP.  I didn't really want coffee with cream in it so I asked the young man for some tea suggestions and he came up with a black tea lemonade.  A minute or so later the barista was hollering out my drink.  It definitely hit the spot and I got up to get a refill a few minutes later.  I now feel the need to find the closest Starbucks (there are two that I could throw a rock at from my patio) and get MORE of this tea.  I also had the berry crumb cake, which was moist and tasted fresher than I thought it would.\n\nThe employees were VERY friendly and helpful (there were 3 working and they all spoke and were very nice).  They even held up very well to a bitchy queen who could not be pleased regardless of their \"customer is right\" attempts.  After they remade the drink for a third time, I would have lost my patience with him, but they kept it together and kept on smiling.  There wasn't a *lot* of seating, but there was plenty of bar-type seating for people who take up real estate while wi-fi'ing it up.

Incredible passed hors d'oeuvres, Paella, tapas, shrimp & grits, ceviche, gazpacho, tacos, sushi, a Venezuelan parilla station, late night philly cheese steak sliders, and more somehow all came together beautifully to create one of the best food experiences I've ever had.

I had one of their weighted salads (I selected grilled chilled shrimp, goat cheese, artichokes, sundried tomatoes - a few of my favorite things!), and it came to about $11. I thought it was insanely delicious, and for those kinds of toppings not unreasonable at all (I've bought those things separately at a regular grocery for  similar salads at-home and the cost is gargantuan). I absolutely loved their salad selection.\n\nMy companions enjoyed their sandwiches immensely (and cracked open a bottle of vino as well to enjoy). My wretched diet prevented me from sinking into one of those lovely single-serve desserts on display - but damn I was tempted.\n\nWe returned the next day for wine happy hour with the rest of the office. The wine room was packed and weren't able to accommodate our party of seven. However, a super-nice young waiter (I want to say his name was Ahmad - he had a faux hawk and lovely manners) was more than solicitous, helping us pull together several tables and chairs, and timely popping around to serve us impeccably. (My knowledge of wine and how it should be served is nonexistent, so I can't wax eloquence about it. However, I was at a table of PASSIONATE wine lovers and they raved about the two reds ordered and didn't make a peep about service so I'm guessing it had to have been very good). \n\nI'm not a wine drinker myself, so I sipped on a yummy diet cream soda (never seen the brand in a Kroger or Target myself - even the diet soda seemed exotic and fancy), and nibbled with restrained gluttony on the delicious cheese plates (rich, creamy, pungent, salty, fragrant cheese with names I can't pronounce). Prices were on the higher end, but the service and atmosphere were just so serenely luxurious that I can even forgive D&D for not carrying my top wine selection (a $5.99 bottle of Barefoot Moscato). \n\nOverall, I loved D&D. I heard that we used to have one in Cincinnati, and I'd be quite happy if they ever thought to return back to the Queen City. Probably better for my budget that they don't though...", "business_id": "hODaBUYzv0AbApej_bfZ-w", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-06-17", "type": "review"}

We needed breakfast, which I was going to pick up, and lunch, which needed to be delivered.  Going through the options and pricing, she made this a very easy process.  She was excellent with communication and everything was on time, well presented, and surprisingly at a comparable prices to other restaurants.  \n\nThe boxes lunches were ooh'ed and aah'ed over, in particular the club sandwich which was huge.  I had the ham and brie sandwich, which was served on a pretzel roll, with the potato salad.  All was above average, but nothing that was amazing.  The cookies were fresh and good (and again, well priced for catering).  \n\nThe breakfast (the Continental) though, left a lot to be desired - it was 90% croissants with only a couple of muffins and some sort of airy breakfast cookie (it tasted like a croissant cookie).   No danish, bagels or scones, which were what was listed on the catering menu.  It came with a fruit bowl and some OJ, which were both good, but for $120 (to serve 8-12), I expected more than a wicker tray filled with croissants.  The coffee also got high marks.\n\nOverall, it was a positive experience.  Caitlin made the process easy, the food that was served was of good quality and fresh.  Delivery was on time and professional.  The price was typical of business lunch cost.

I went in to buy flowers since they have always had a great selection and good pricing.  Since it's been a while I waled through.\n\nI have grown to like the wide aisles and big selection of the other stores.  Fresh Market just seems crowded and walking around there isn't a real flow.  The meat counter was understaffed although there was a nice selection.  Walking up and down the aisles there was some pretty good stuff and I found what I wanted.  Cashiers were friendly and the experience was good.  The \"buggys\" were the older metal kind and were dated and rusty.  Definitely time for an upgrade.\n\nWe all know that in Charlotte we have plenty of grocery stores so you're not stuck to one location or one store because surely there is a Harris Teeter on the next corner from wherever you are.

No matter what you're interested in, if you want to have a drink the guys and girls here can help you find the perfect match for your palate. The wine selection is hard to beat, and you definitely won't find better deals anywhere else in Charlotte. The beer selection is also top notch, and they even do a yearly tasting outside with close to 100 beers to sample from.\n\nOne of the best things about the Wine Vault, and something that really sets them apart from the other contenders in this genre, are their weekly tastings. For $5-10 (depending on the quality of the wines that week) you can taste up to 6 wines, and learn a little bit about each one while you do it. There's a large group of regulars who come to almost every tasting, so if you're new to the area it's also a great way to meet some really cool people. There's also an extensive wine cellar (hence the Vault name) downstairs with private bins that you can rent to store you own wine, in addition to a much larger seating area that I think most people don't even realize exists. They do lots of private events down in the main cellar room, so if you want to do a big corporate event like a private tasting it's a really cool atmosphere and something your friends or employees will remember for a long time.\n\nMy favorite aspect though has to be the almost monthly wine dinners that the shop puts on in conjunction with some of the best restaurants in the Charlotte area. They are always extremely reasonable in price, especially when you compare it to similar offerings around town.

The selection is great, and the staff are very friendly and helpful. \n\nHonestly, If you are from out of town and are used to fantastic liquor stores like BevMo or buying mass quantities from Costco like me, it still doesn't come close to the west coast. However; this is as good as it gets in the South. And it's totally worth the 20 min drive! \n\nTip: Bring Cash! They give you a better deal if you with with cash over a card.", "business_id": "2-M1_ok4NZ-fSF6SbBsp1A", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-06-25", "type": "review"}

You've probably passed it going to or from NC to SC, or heard about it. It's the giant liquor warehouse with the view of Carowinds.\n\nJuly 3rd it was a madhouse. Despite that, there was no ill will, grumpy customers or people honking in the jam packed parking lot. The line on the liquor side was all the way to the back of the store. Americans not only love their fireworks, but apparently their booze as well.\n\nAfter a quick visit, I delved deeper on the wine and beer section. Compared to the other side, there were tumble weeds blowing through the aisles. I thought Americans loved their beer too?! Apparently, \"liquor is quicker\"; maybe on holidays we splurge or just want to become inebriated more efficiently. The beer selection was just okay for me and the prices were nothing special. There are bottle shops in NoDa with similar prices. A six pack of Ballast Point IPA was $14.99 here and is the same price at the Common Market in Charlotte. I even think the prices at Total Wine are similar if not a tad better. Some of the more commonly found six packs that you can buy at Harris Teeter or Food Lion were almost $2 more per six pack. Ugh!\n\nThe cash discount doesn't seem to make much of a dent either. A thirty cent discount on a bottle of wine even times ten is only $3. I did not check to see if they have bulk discounts. There was a Growler filling station that was a great feature. The bathroom was pretty gross and poorly lit (bulb out). I get the impression that this place may be better for liquor sales. We have places like this all over New York and New Jersey, so I didn't find it all that impressive.", "business_id": "2-M1_ok4NZ-fSF6SbBsp1A", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-07-07", "type": "review"}

This is a store that could really use a face lift.  The industrial grade linoleum, the high metal ceilings, the harsh florescent lighting give the place that institutional warehouse vibe that just screams 1980.\n\nIt wasn't a real productive shopping trip. The produce quality was not very good.  The celery looked past its prime (think pale green with browning tips).  The same could be said of the salad greens.  There was little in the way of organic produce, but I did like the country of origin signs on the produce. (The poor quality of the produce surprised me since both Pick n Save and Copps are owned by Roundy's and the produce quality at Copps in generally pretty decent.) \n\nThe selection in the deli counter was limited and the meat department was hit or miss.  (I did find some decent looking beef tenderloin, but they did not carry the Smart Chicken brand that prefer)\n\nThe international food section consisted of a third of a row of taco kits, salsa and soy sauce.  The selection of dry goods followed the theme of limited selection with prices 15% to 25% higher than Woodmans.\n\nI ended up leaving and picking up the items I needed at the local Piggly Wiggly that looked downright palatial in comparison to this Pick n Save.

The food is usually good, but today we got the worst service ever. We ordered at the drive up window, and pulled around to the side to wait for our food. Several cars behind us in line came and left, so my husband went inside to ask about our order. They had no idea where it was. The employees inside had no idea that there was an order matching our number. Maybe someone gave our order to another customer. They asked my husband if he wanted to wait for them to make another meal. He requested his money back. But they didn't simply refund his money, he had to WAIT for his money as well, while the manager was going through the register looking for some record of his order. But in the mean time, she was waiting on other customers in the drive up window! There was still no record of our order, so she had to calculate the order over again from what he ordered. It took forever, and finally I decided to leave the car and see if my husband might have been abducted by aliens, but I did see him coming back to the car, no meal in hand. Usually in situations like this, some compensation is made to the customer, either a free meal or at least some coupons. Nothing here.

At 7:30 a.m., the assumption in a coffee shop three blocks from a major freeway entrance should probably be that people are on their way to work, or just generally not interested in a leisurely 15-minute wait for a latte!\n\nWhen I entered the store there was one person already waiting for an espresso drink, one person ahead of me and no one behind me. After one of the three employees rung me up, I waited several minutes as the barista VERY leisurely made the person in front of me's cappucino. She was literally pulling an espresso, standing for a few seconds talking to the other girl, then steaming the milk, then standing, and so on.\n\nAfter she finally finished the other guy's drink, she wiped her area down and took her sweet time to start my drink. It was very obvious I was there waiting, and very obvious that she was just wasting time. Meanwhile, her and one of the other employees started to argue with one another, all the while she does nothing. Finally, I tried to make eye contact with one of them, because I really was in a hurry to get back to Milwaukee. Finally, she made my drink, slooooooowly. \n\nAs an aside, I'm not that uptight or fast-paced of a person, but customer service with no customer focus really gets on my nerves, and there is simply no excuse for ignoring a customer in a coffee shop at 7:30 in the morning.

Crikey - I'm losing it, I tell 'ya.\n\nNo visit to the Madison area would be complete without stopping-by the Capital Brewery.  During the spring/summer/fall months, their beer garden is phenomenal.  It's a large, trellised, open area that's sun-protected compliments of a huge blue tent cover/awning.  \n\nPicnic tables galore, it makes for an ideal location to chill with friends and family.  Bring along whatever type of food you'd like, because they don't serve food here.  Or, better yet, call one of the many local restaurants and request delivery - most of them service the brewery.  Dogs are more than welcome, as are kids. \n\nA large stage frames the eastern side of the garden; you'll find live music on most Friday and Saturday nights.  They used to show movies on Saturday nights, but I believe that has come to pass.\n\nThe staff is always excellent.  You won't find a nicer group of folks no matter how far or hard you search.  Kyle's the absolute best - the guy is unbelievably friendly, funny, and knows everything about the brews.  He often serves as the brewery tour guide, so pay attention if he suggests you try a certain brew.\n\nDuring the colder months, the indoor stube is warm and inviting.  There's a large flat screen television for game watching, and plenty of comfy seating.  The stube operates on reduced hours during the winter months, and just a heads-up that it's often times rented/reserved for private events (think holiday parties), so check their website schedule prior to planning a spur-of-the-moment visit.\n\nThe gift shop is nice, with a great selection of glasses, shirts, and other goodies.  Prices are more than reasonable.  The bathrooms are usually spotless, which is a bonus.\n\nSo... if you haven't been to the brewery, make it a priority to visit.  Stop by on a Saturday or Sunday and take the tour (it's only a couple of dollars, includes samples, and runs hourly), then spend time enjoying some of Capital's great beers.

Next, they put stuff on the canned goods shelves too hight for short people. Many times I have helped people reach stuff they wanted. There is never anyone around the store to ask except vendors, who are no help. The meat quality is good as is the bakery. Its just the crummy feel of the store and lack of any service that gives a bad impression.

Either way, that Parthenon in Madison is crap, people rave about it, what a joke, they have no clue what good gyros is, take a road trip and go eat at Hubs in Chicago, then you will know finally what great gyros is. In the meantime, if you are stuck in Madison, this is by far the best you will find, don't waste your money and calories elsewhere.\n\nFalafel is good, has it's own unique recipe, works for me.\n\nTan Tan Chicken is very good too, highly spiced, which I like, although not spicy as far as heat is concerned. Comes with an awesome garlic dip, which I've only found in Los Angeles at Zankou Chicken, which by the way is the most incredible middle-eastern chicken ever. They even made a \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" episode about it in 2011. If you get out to LA ever, you must go to Zankou and get the Chicken Tarna with the garlic dip, the hummus is also the best ever. Almost enough to make me want to move back to LA.

I think we were expecting a normal ice cream shop kind of atmosphere, with a big case of flavors to look at, so we had a bit of a deer-in-headlights moment when we first walked in, trying to figure out what we were supposed to order. It turns out they only have 3 flavors (vanilla, chocolate, and one other) per day, and most of your choices come from what sort of sundae you get. Once we figured that out, a number of the sundae choices seemed pretty solid. I ended up going with Turtle, and my husband got the Peanut Butter Cup. Both were excellent. The chocolate shell on the PBC was nicely chocolaty, especially for that kind of a product, and I appreciated that they didn't skimp on the pecans for the Turtle. We both had smalls, which were QUITE ample. We also got a K9 custard for our dog, which she appeared to enjoy. \n\nI guess I just have a couple of objections that keep this from being a 4-star place. First, I wish they had more flavors, since I don't always want a sundae (but maybe this is characteristic of frozen custard joints and is not a fair criticism). Second, I think it should be served slightly colder so that it doesn't melt as fast when the hot fudge hits it. Third, I felt that it was a bit overpriced for a fast food-style place. This is especially true of the K9 custard, since we're used to getting something more along the lines of a 79-cent kiddie cone for the dog.

Who knew you could mess up a Blizzard so bad?\n\nFirst of all, the line was out the door.  We assumed that it was just a busy night.  Turns out they were out of multiple items (and did not put a sign up). People were upset and walking out.  Then the family in front of us ordered, but did not pay.  No card, no money left their hand.  What?  So like you are giving out free ice cream and making us wait in line?  \n\nI get up to the counter and ask a question about the ingredients of a Brownie Batter blizzard.  They are like, it is just brownies.  My response: Anything else?  They had to go ask someone.  What?  Seriously?!  So I finally get my answer and order it.  My husband also ordered a blizzard.  He ordered a Turtle Pecan blizzard and received some random peanuts in his blizzard.  We never got a receipt.  When I asked for one, they said they did not have any.  What?!\n\nWe pay and wait.  And wait.  Oh, but while we wait, we get to watch the kitchen person.  He was making a chicken sandwich.  With his LONG ponytail hanging over the grill.  Yum?  More like gross.  Then both my husband and I notice that he grabbed a raw chicken breast (while not wearing a glove) and placed it on the bare counter.  He then wiped his hand on his pants.  What?  Salmonella much?  Any food standards?\n\nWe get our medium blizzards.  The ice cream normally extends to the top or slightly over the top of the cup.  This time the ice cream barely made it to the top of my cup. My husband had ice cream under the cup.  When we asked if this was a medium, they said yes.  And just walked away.  \n\nI walked out feeling very unsatisfied and my husband I determined this will be our last visit to the local DQ.

Let's get the bad stuff out of the way first.  \n\n- It's pricey.  I recently bought 2 sea scallops, a pound of Halibut, and a 6-oz Tuna fillet.  Price: $50.86.  Ouch.\n\n- Limited selection of \"staple-goods.\"  Sure, I can get fresh Alaskan King Crab or a locally-made vegan cookie from the bakery at a moment's notice, but I dare you to find a box of Blueberry Special K on a Sunday night... I think they stock 4 or 5 of those, and when they're gone, they're gone (they're also about $1 higher than Woodman's).\n\n- It's inconvenient to get in and out of.  University Avenue S-U-C-K-S sucks.  And, if you wish to head west from Metcalfe's, you have to turn onto Midvale, make a U-turn, and then sit at the Midvale/University light and wait... The parking lot is also a cluster-F.\n\n- The checkers can be a bit snooty.  That, or I get the same girl every time... it really does seem as though I'm bothering the heck out of her by giving her a handful of items to scan, waiting on a total, and then giving her money.  I usually encounter a \"why-are-you-bothering-me-with-this\" sigh or a roll of the eyes at some point during checkout.  \n\n- The clientele can be a bit snobby (especially the ones that hop out of their leased BMWs).  Yeah, so you think you're cool in your BMW, but we both know that you're living in a rundown apartment, using one credit card to pay the other, and you're maybe 2-weeks from having the Bimmer repo'd.  Get over yourself... and flip your collar down and straighten that hat - you look ridiculous, fratty.  Ok?\n\n\nAnd now for the good stuff.\n\n+ The service workers (Deli, bakery, etc) are fantastic.  Very knowledgeable and helpful.  Makes it seem a little less painful when you're paying $28.99/lb for fish or buying a $4 cupcake.\n\n+ Fruits and Veggies are usually top notch quality.\n\n+ They place an emphasis on locally sourced products.\n\nSo there you have it.  As others have mentioned, there are many better alternatives for regular day-to-day items: Woodman's, for one.  But for those times when you need something that's extra fresh, or a little obscure, check out Metcalfe's.", "business_id": "OxR3b_qcMJlzwzGPU5fmdA", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-08-17", "type": "review"}

Now I'll be the first to admit I'm barely breaking into the grocery scene here in Madison, and I know there are Co-ops and farmer's markets galore. But what really gets me going about this place is that most every meat, dairy and grain product has a sign with the distance in miles that product traveled to Metcalfe's. WHAT? Eggs from 40 miles away too far for you? Grab a dozen from the farm that's labeled 8 miles away... no yolk! Care to chomp cheese that doesn't drive more than 5? They've got it. Add java, pasta sauce even tortilla chips bagged 1 mile down the street at the local taqueria and you have a geographically conscious way to stock pantry fridge and freezer. \n\nOh and Chef Lea Caplan... I have no idea who you are, but I want to know who you are. She is Metcalfe's resident food expert, writing books, leading cooking demonstrations and showing up to festivals and fairs to teach Madisonians about how to take home Metcalfe's great local goods and start using them in rad recipes.

I was able to find several cheese orphans at a good price to sample, conveniently arriving just as their cheesemonger was dropping off a new batch.\n\nThere were some frustrations (no non-saltine store-brand crackers for my cheese, for instance), but to be fair the average Metcalfe's shopper probably isn't cruising for generic deals and will just pay the extra fifty cents for a name brand. \n\nThe store is clean and fairly easy to navigate, and the classical music piped overhead is a heavy-handed touch that I find oddly relaxing.

Therefore, I end up there for groceries more often than not. \n\nThen came yesterday:\n\nI have been looking an issue of Time magazine.  I have tried a few places with no luck.  So rather than waste gas money, I began calling around.  I live about a mile from the Sentry store and thought I would give it a call on the way home.  The phone was answered and I simply asked: Do you carry Time Magazine?  Her response was: Maybe, yeah I think so.  Before I could ask if it was in stock, she hung up on me.  No good bye.  Nothing.  If she was busy she could have said that.  \n\nSo I go into the store to search for it, assuming it is there.  I do find it in the magazine rack and I check the head of the registers.  I hear a voice and immediately recognize the woman who answered the phone.  She had a peach colored fleece on.  She is an older woman in her 50/60's with graying hair behind the customer service register.  I pass her up because I am completely upset to see her doing nothing.  The fact that she hung up on me and I come to the store and I see her sitting on a chair doing nothing angered me.  \n\nI continued to look for my magazine.  One of the cashiers asks if they can help me with something.  I tell her I am looking for Time Magazine.  Her response: Well, umm, what?  Never heard of it.  \n\nNow, I could care less if they do not carry it, but thus far I have been told you might carry it by a woman who hung up on me and then a cashier who has never heard of a national magazine.  I keep looking.  I ask another cashier who might know.  After all, what if I just overlooked it?  She says she does not know.  And that is it.  \n\nThat is my whole experience trying to find a magazine.  I walked out feeling completely terrible.  I shop at the store because it is near my house.  Last night, I decided to stop shopping there.  I will drive to the belt line and go to Pick and Save or up to Sun Prairie.

One half weighs three quarters of a pound, which worries me a little. \n\nLook, I buy from them, I wish they'd become an actual BUTCHER SHOP vs a MEAT MARKET, and while the high school kids who work there are nice, they're not going to butterfly a whole chicken for you so hope one of the managers or the owner is there, or answer a question about just how long that cut of steak should live over coals.

The owner responded to my request with a simple \"no.\"  \n\nOk.  I still shop there for some things, so clearly it's not a deal-breaker.

You cannot even get into the parking lot and resort to parking across the street a the Associate Bank.\n3.

If only I could absorb lecture material that easily.\n\nI ordered the iced latte (easy on the ice), and found it to be much creamier than I am used to (probably because I usually get my lattes with skim or nonfat milk), but it was reallllyyy good and SUPER filling. My only issue with my drink wasn't the drink itself, but rather the paper cup that it came in. By the time I was half way through my drink, the cup had become a soggy mess that was barely holding its shape (which meant the lid wasn't staying on very well either). I ended up having to down the rest of my coffee quickly to prevent spilling on myself. So, JBC, new cups perhaps?\n\nI like the fact the JBC coffee has two separate windows for placing orders and picking up orders. It prevents the congregation of a large crowd in front of the cart which makes it difficult to distinguish between those waiting to pick up and those waiting to order.

For such reasonable prices, it's a wonder everyone doesn't shop there.\n\nOh wait, they do! =D  You can tell just by the parking lot.  There are two lots that sort of bump up to the front and side easements, but these lots are pretty small (like 7-12 cars per, I'd guess).  There are times you actually have to wait for a space to open up so you can park and run in.  And it's not unusual for someone to be all cattywampus in a space or NINE (I'm looking at you, SUVs =P), so!

The shop boasts an impressive selection of different noodles (not just ramen), fresh produce, beverages, and necessary sauces for cooking many Malaysian, Indonesian, Thai, and Chinese dishes.  Where else in town can you find fresh lemon-grass, Kaffir lime leaves, Thai eggplants (golf-ball-size and green), and Chinese leeks?\n\nSome of the staff might seem hostile, but I would suggest approaching the teenagers who work there if you have trouble, as they are very friendly.  After describing dishes I want to cook, I've often received helpful and honest recommendations from the owners about the right ingredients to purchase.\n\nThe best time to pick up groceries at Far East are Thursday evenings or Fridays because these are days when they receive fresh shipments of produce, bakery goods, and snacks.

It may come from working part-time as a barista over the past 4 years or perhaps more simply because I love the quiet solitude of drinking coffee (or your caffeinated beverage of choice) with others in a space that can serve an office, a spot to relax, or a location to catch up with friends.  \nIt might be silly to say, but I think you get a sense of whether or not you'll like a coffee shop and, in regards to Cafe Kopi, I got that \"I'm going to like it here\" feeling as soon as I walked under the store front awnings and through the glass front door.  \nThe lighting is just right, the music is a suitable volume and of a pleasant variety, and the staff were very friendly.  I ordered the iced Cafe Miel (a single shot latte with honey and vanilla) after reading some other Yelpers' reviews.  After talking with the barsta, she assured me that it was good both hot and cold.  I thoroughly enjoyed it as I read my book on this quiet Sunday morning.  It was definitely a nice option for those that are not Mocha lovers.\nI can't speak to the food, but I can speak to the ambience.  It was a comfortable spot to read and get some work done and it is a place that I hope to frequent during my brief stay in Champaign.  There was plenty of seating and outlets; Cafe Koki definitely has the potential to be a great study spot not far from the U of I campus.\nStop in and see if you get that \"I think I'm going to like it here\" feeling yourself!", "business_id": "yzInxReAkf7r0aRbwj02Yw", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-07-20", "type": "review"}

They only have two types of tea prepared (black and green), so if you want a tea from the wall, they have to brew it and pour it on ice. They have a pretty decent sandwich selection, so it's hard for me to choose which one i want. If you go there often, consider buying a Kopi cup. You get discounts if you bring it in!\n\nThe atmosphere is what really gets me. The wooden tables look rugged, but they are so smooth!

The bread, cookies, bars, dessert loaves, etc. are all incredibly good and good every time: moist, flavorful, fresh, well seasoned, and wholesome. The bread is substantial with a well developed crumb -- not airy or light -- and that's the kind I like. \n\nThe occasional specialty breads are to die for. I once took a loaf of the monkey bread to work, and it was mobbed. People from the office made a beeline to Great Harvest to buy more to take home. Some of the savory items are just as good -- the pepperoni rolls in white and the heavenly veggie rolls in wheat (although they aren't available as often). They now offer sandwiches to go, but I haven't yet tried one.\n\nBut it's the day in, day out everyday loaves that make Great Harvest such a great bakery. Their whole wheat breads are especially superior -- chewy and richly flavored. Their white breads and challah are good, too. If the bread is seeded or includes something like nuts or berries, you can be sure there are plenty worked through or across the dough, too. And they will slice just about anything, unless it's a very odd shape.\n\nI've even tried their carb control bread. I won't say it is a good diet choice, because you won't be able to stop eating it. It's denser and less tasty than the regular items, but much better than the other low carb breads you'll find, even in specialty stores. Great Harvest also offers a brochure about making diet choices, for those with diabetic or other dietary restrictions.\n\nWhen you enter the bakery, you'll be offered a slice of bread, buttered and with jam if you want, as a sample. You'll also find some nice gourmet foodstuffs and kitchen items that go with the bakery theme. \n\nGreat Harvest Bread Company is one of our local treasures. Nothing at Great Harvest tastes like it comes from a franchised bakery, and in fact, owners of each shop are allowed (and often do) alter recipes and offer their own to suit local tastes and use local ingredients. \n\nI can't recommend this bakery enough!", "business_id": "-ACBdnpO32tpCaCQmScDGA", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-06-09", "type": "review"}

Culver's and DQ, I am talking to you (they are not even real custard stands, but sadly, that is all that most people will ever know).\n\nBut if you do care, then you know that the way to -chip a concrete it to put a layer of the hard-shell chocolate topping into the middle -- the effect being that when you blend it the custard is infused with tiny little frozen shards of chocolate goodness.  If the custard stand respects you and your highly developed tastes, they will serve you that way.  Jarling's does that right, and earns my Champaign loyalty.\n\nThat is all there is to know; the custard is good, it would have been five stars had they used fresh blueberries, but it was the first hot and humid night of the year so they get something of a pass.

I'd actually driven past here on a previous occasion while in the Champaign area, but did not stop by. I did some research for dessert options in the area, and Jarling's seemed to be very popular.\n\nGoing to Jarling's, I knew I wanted to get a snowstorm (similar to Culver's concrete mixer, DQ's blizzard). I also wanted to try their famous 'cold fudge,' which is hot fudge, but it's cold, and does not melt the custard (explanation given to me by a girl working there).\n\nAnyways, I decided to go with the Tortoise snowstorm. At first, the girl gave me the tortoise sundae, which i should have started eating, but I gave it back instead. I guess she was confused because I asked what cold fudge was, and cold fudge usually comes on the sundaes, but whatever. It was quickly corrected to a Tortoise snow storm. I also ordered  a teddy cup of the cake batter ice cream. A teddy cup at Jarling's is a dip (equvalent to a scoop) with 6 teddy grahams and a cherry. A dip would have been 1.75, but the T cup was 2.25. Not really worth it in my opinion.\n\nI was a bit confused by my snowstorm, to be honest. It said it was vanilla custard, although it came out looking like chocolate. The tortoise is supposed to feature cold fudge, almonds, and butterscotch. When the incorrect tortoise sundae was brought out, it was vanilla custard with a fudge topping. For my snowstorm, it was a different color, so I was confused. I also did not taste any butterscotch, which I was really looking forward to.\n\nI went here with my bro, and he ordered the same teddy cup, as well as a Macaroon snowstorm. I had a bit of his, and it was much better than mine. I think they may have mixed up my order, but either way, the custard was still very good.\n\nThe cake batter custard was nothing special, to be honest. No pieces of cake batter, or any sprinkles.They have a weekly special of flavors, along with their regular (see their new updated website). \n\nJust a side note, we came here at 845 on a Saturday night, and it was pretty crowded inside. There are multiple benches inside, as well as a drivethru. We decided to order and head to my car, which was parked in one of the angle spots. While eating, 2 wonderlake fire dept trucks pulled on both sides of us. A girl who got out of one of the trucks decided to open her car door on my exterior, and didn't even bother to check anything. Not sure I'd want her responding to a fire of mine (nothing against jarling's, but it did happen there).\n\n15 dollars for our 4 dishes. I'm not sure if I will be getting a snowstorm or a sundae on my next trip, but I will be back! I think I should have gone with something coconut, PB, or chocolate chip based next time. I'll be honest, I was disappointed in my Tortoise, but I will go back because I love dessert, and I'd prefer this place over DQ, any frozen yogurt place, or McD. I'd actually put it on par with Culver's, but I love local business, and I'd like to see if my experience coudl be improved.", "business_id": "ciRNik0_EdguibEypTspFA", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-06-30", "type": "review"}

I have been going to this place every summer for years! When the owners announced they would close after they ran out of their initial batch of custard at the beginning of the season, it sent me (and everyone I know) into a panic. Luckily, they decided to re-open, and I have been able to get my annual fill of delicious custard. \n\nTheir menu includes a huge list of flavors for \"snowstorms,\" the Jarling's version of a blizzard.They always have a flavor of the week in addition of the standard chocolate, strawberry, and vanilla. I would say that the flavors for the custards are fairly subtle, so I usually add a topping or two. Every week, there is also a different special deal, like $1 off a specialty sundae. Jarling's is most famous for their cold fudge (and for good reason). It is unlike anything I've had before. Whenever I'm feeling indecisive, I know I can't go wrong with a classic cold fudge sundae. \n\nMost recently, I ordered the brownie fudge sundae and it was just what I needed. It included a generous serving of vanilla custard, their famous cold fudge, pecans, and whipped cream topped with a cherry (which I chose to forgo). I highly recommend trying this one!  \n\nNo matter when you decide to go, you can count on it being busy. However, since each of the three windows has a separate line, the wait is never as bad as it seems. They lock the doors at exactly 10 pm. Even if you arrive at 10:01, they will not let you in (I speak from experience), so be sure to get there in time.", "business_id": "ciRNik0_EdguibEypTspFA", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-08-01", "type": "review"}

They have an incredibly history, one any employee would be happy to share with you (or you can always find more on their website).  \n\nThey've done some renovations in the past few years, giving them a better parking lot (the old one was abysmal, and even though they're still using it, they've expanded to make the drive around nicer).

You either get your treat to go, or your stand around outside and eat it as it melts all over you. ;D  At one point, the store was completely outside, but they built a small air-conditioned foyer-like surround, which is really nice on a hot day and there are 10,000 people ahead of you! ;D\n\nTheir menu is so diverse, I think it'd take the most seasoned die-hard an entire summer to get through all the flavors and combinations (and they're always adding more!).  The price is steep, but you're paying for quality, here, over something that's so processed and artificial it almost ruins the experience.\n\nSeriously,if you're in need and have the chance, get your custard fix at one of C-U's paragons.

That's a good question. Several times I have had to grab a handbasket because there were no carts in stock, even though I had a long grocery list to fulfill. I actually saw the cartboys leaning against the cartrails, laughing and having a heck of a time. Look, I get it, it's hot outside and you don't want to get get the carts, but C'MON!\n3) The first thing you see upon walking in may or may not be a ghetto display of moldy-looking fruit, or on  the 4th of July, a teenage employee roasting hot dogs on a bunsen burner with open containers of ketchup and mustard on a rickety table.\n4) Venture into the produce section, and you will meander through very difficult twists and turns that your cart may not even fit through. Please, managers, make sure that the spaces between fruit stands are at least cart-width!!!\n5) The line for the pharmacy extends into the produce area. Enough said.\n6) Expect for the aisles to have large space-blocking cardboard displays and/or fallen down merchandise and/or an employee restocking items right in the middle of the day. I would say half of the aisles are blocked at any given time.\n7) Once you have completed your hazardous journey of finding everything on your list, you must enter one of the two checkout lines, which are so long that they become another force blocking the aisleways. Two checkout lines, you say? Yes, only two, despite there being 5 or 6 total checkout lanes. If you are a young lady with any shred of fashion or hygiene, expect to be \"checked out\" by creepy older men whilst standing innocently in line.\n8) Your cashier will either be a surly teenage boy or a pregnant teenage girl who does a poor job managing the line and barely gives you the time of day and/or forgets to give you the receipt when you are done. But you are so eager to get out of there, you simply don't care to go back and ask for it.\n\nOh, and there may or may not be trash on the floor.\nIf Safeway as a nationwide brand prides themselves on safety or service, they need to get their corporate people in here to take a look at this store, and either condemn it or fire everyone who works here.\nIt's even more pitiful because they are the closest store to everyone who lives downtown, so they could easily be the most popular.\nPlease, downtown, replace this disgraceful store with a Whole Foods or a Sprouts or a place with a shred of human decency.", "business_id": "7Z7IkR_-94AjUuDw0fbI7g", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-07-09", "type": "review"}

It is also located near a Walgreen's and McDonald's.  Because of the location, however, many homeless are present in the store and in the parking lot. With that said, the prices can be a bit high for some items, but I imagine the rent is out of control.\n\nPROS:  With that said, I'm impressed with the frozen produce and meats, butcher (bacon!), non-dairy \"milk\" selection, bakery, customer service counter, and booze sections. The fresh produce section is hit or miss, and sometimes they have GREAT sales. Whenever meat/fish/poultry is 50% off, I buy it up and freeze it at home in air-tight zip locs.  \n\nCONS: The only real complaint I have is that during \"rush\" times, they do not open up any more cashier lanes...so you can wait in line for up to 20 minutes.

The billboards of the giant super 3-lb. burrito finally cast a spell on me, and I took the plunge.\n\nLa Tolteca is not quite as full service as Ranch Market, but it's somewhat of a smaller version where you'll find a counter-service deli, panaderia, carniceria, jugeria, and a mini-market here.  Even better is their cooking tools section (where you can buy huge tamale steamers, and mortar and pestles for making chile) and the catering menu which starts at $5 per person.  Holy crap.  What a steal.  \n\nUpon entrance you'll see the deep pit outside where some man is grilling all the carne you'll find served inside.  As you step inside you'll see some brisk business - I found all sorts of types and ethnicities here - a young couple on a date, some girls gabbing over lunch and others ordering food and pastries to go.\n\nThe food here ROCKS.   It's very authentic, cooked by commadres and tias just like back home.   The Grandma quotient on the beans and rice was very high -- always a standard assessment in my quest for good Mexican food.  They have every imaginable burrito type here and they're huge and cheap - at $4.  I always opt for the veggie (rice, beans, cheese and guacamole) burrito and am always impressed - the best part being the freshly made tortillas.  I even bought some on my way out to take home.\n\nThe tacos are a good choice too.  The combo plates start at $5.  The carne asada (a little overcooked) was pretty good and delicious in a flavorful marinade, and the shrimp taco was really good - a much better choice I would add.  Paired with some tamarind, strawberry agua fresca or horchata and you'll be in heaven.\n\nI find the bakery to be the highlight regarding the food.  The pandulce was excellent - if a bit more fresh (than Ranch Market) given the way it's stored behind a glass case rather than self-service.  The conchas and pineapple empanadas were soft, sweet and delicious - with perfect texture.

The staff is friendly and remembered me the 2nd time I ever came in, and every time since.  The ambiance and decor is fun and the food - oh the food is amazing!  I have brought several people here who doubted my claim of \"best in Phoenix\" and they all left agreeing with me.\n\nI confess that I tend to stick to a few favorites and always over-order, but it's all so tasty!  Their super nachos are much more \"super\" if you put carne asada on them instead of the standard ground beef.  I had never had elotes con todos (corn with everything) before coming here, but somehow, steamed corn on a stick with mayo, chili powder and cheese is a winning combination. Who knew?  There is no way to eat this corn daintily but it's so good that I don't care.  I can floss later.\n\nThe carne asada or carnitas soft tacos are consistently high quality but the real reason I pilgrimage here from clear across town is the fish tacos.  The mahi mahi is perfectly seasoned and flaky, with homemade tartar sauce and queso fresco.  I personally skip the rice and beans because they do use lard in the beans and that doesn't always sit well with me.  The salsa verde from the always well stocked salsa bar is noteworthy and good on nearly everything and just a few drops of habanero salsa on my fish taco is enough for great flavor and a little kick without totally setting my insides on fire. If you like ceviche, try the tostada de ceviche - a great little value for the price - shrimp, avocado, onion, tomato and lime for under $3?  I couldn't make it for that cheap!\n\nThe latest development at La Tolteca is the construction of an outdoor BBQ grill just outside the entrance closest to the parking lot. Perhaps this will reduce smokiness inside from the somewhat poorly ventilated indoor grill.  That would be great.\n\nBefore you leave, be sure to pick up some churros and a fruit empanada or two, or even some arroz con leche (rice pudding) at the panaderia (bakery). Even if you (like me) ordered too much and don't have any room left for sweets, they're just as good as a late-night snack once you get home.", "business_id": "apCfJVnRyaw6oVUBKujpUQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-06-22", "type": "review"}

WELL NO MORE!!\n\nMy friend had a Groupon (or something similar) for this place so we went. \nWhen you walk in, you're smacked with the delicious smoke from the FIRE-GRILLED meats they use for your meal! When I smelled that, my anticipation was amplified. You wander past the breads, pastries and cakes, and order from the board and take a seat. Your order number is announced bilingually when ready. Spartan seating, nice colorful tablecloths covered with plastic. Worn floor tile that can take centuries of traffic. You'll see what I mean.\n\nI had the pastor (pork) taco plate with refried beans (slightly runny) and Mexican rice (clumpy), and I accented with selections from the free salsa bar. The salsa bar has whole roasted jalape\u00f1os (you might need to peel some skin off) with onion slices (interesting roasted flavor), another section of veggies, then chopped onions, then cilantro, then salsas in descending heat to the right, begining with haba\u00f1ero red salsa on the left! Made me sweat! WATCH OUT, tell your friends, this is no ordinary salsa that you randomly grab and dump on your stuff. Pico de gallo is at the right end, and the MILD red salsa is next to it. The green salsa is DELICIOUS and mild as well.\n\nSin piedad por gringo: Habanero shot challenge! 2 people or more AFTER your meal. Have ice cream ready. Beer or water won't help.\n\nMy friend ordered two tamales, one chicken one pork, both wrapped in different leaves. Definite authentic flavor. We also got Jamaica (\"ha-MAI-ca\") which is a super sweet red hibiscus juice. You can also get bottled Mexican beers for $1.99. DEAL!! \n\nWater is located on the left side of the ordering counter in a self-serve container. \nExtra napkins (you WILL need them) are not readily available, you must ask for your plush paper napkins. Makes sense, they're more expensive, not cheap fiber napkins recycled from cardboard. \nThere's also a small grocery area. You can get fresh warm tortillas, a few veggies, some pork ($3.99/lb), authentic chicharones.\n\nSuper Inside Skinny: That's freshly made mol\u00e9 in bags at the grocery counter.\n\nCool Inside Skinny: 24 pack of Mexican sodas (Coke, Pepsi, Sprite I saw, but there might be others, maybe Fanta?) in glass bottles for $16. \nI usually buy them for a buck each at the gas station on the fly, but there's the real deal right there. Works out to 66.66 cents each as you can see!\n\nSo overall I'm sold and pleased with La Tolteca. \nTHIS is where you want to take your tourist friends when they come.", "business_id": "apCfJVnRyaw6oVUBKujpUQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-08-28", "type": "review"}

Given the opportunity, he would have eaten there every day.  When he and I went there for the first time, I also LOVED it.  But I suspect that my love for the place was a bit (a lot) exaggerated given my infatuation with this guy.  Over the years, I've gone back several times.  The food is good.  It's sometimes really bad, too.  Overall, this place is consistently inconsistent.  The beans are usually runny, bland, and pretty gross, but occasionally, they're actually really quite good.  The shredded beef flautas are good - unless they are over-fried and the meat is an unchewable shredded mess.  While I find this place to be hit-or-miss, it's one of the few Mexican joints that aren't excessively Americanized, so it's worth the gamble from time-to-time.\n\nThat said, the bakery is exceptional, and one of the best Mexican bakeries in town.  The selection is huge, everything is usually really fresh, and it's super, super cheap.  The bakery takes orders for cakes (up to a full sheet, I believe) and the tres leches is really delicious.\n\nAll-around, this is a great option for solid Mexican food and really delicious pastries!", "business_id": "apCfJVnRyaw6oVUBKujpUQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-06-14", "type": "review"}

There are other things that are less awesome such as the carnita sopes, which don't have the same flavorful seasoning as the other items mentioned.

The tortillas are a little dense and also a little lacking in the flavor department - again, there's better to be found in the Valley (and, despite La Tolteca's extremely reasonable prices, for cheaper).  \n\nThe chilaquiles, however, are a dish to behold.  A giant platter of still crispy but sauce-laden tortilla chips, egg, meat, queso, avocado, sour cream, onion, and cilantro - it's full of flavor, heavy on texture, well-balanced on spice and hearty as all hell.

I'm pretty sure the owners think I'm a little strange for the amount of time I spend staring at their tool aisle....\n\nThe family that owns the place is great -- very kind and fun to do business with. \n\nThere aren't enough shops like this left in this country -- I feel better every time I walk through the door.", "business_id": "fAJvlRFhdYJlMyG-CA4ErQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-07-30", "type": "review"}

This store is what Food City WISHES it was!  It takes the best of Mexican specialty stores and eateries and combines it all under one roof.  Shoppers here are mostly Hispanic with a few adventurous gringos thrown in here and there.  But workers there are friendly and know English - some better than others.\n\nHoly crap!  I can't believe it's taken me so long to review this place.  I only go here ALL the time for cheap delicious down-home Mexican food, cheap produce, and Spanish rice like Grandma used to make.  I've been going to Ranch Market for about 10 years at their stores in Bakersfield -- where they first started.  I used to make fun of my mom for going to lunch here.  Heh, look who's laughing now.  I'm addicted!\n\nThe food here is no-frills authentic and seats inside are picnic bench style.  It's not uppity Mexican fare like Barrio Cafe, but it's not Filiberto's diarrhea fare either.  Everything from chile colorado, chile verde, calabasitas, sopes, mole,  tortas, carnitas, chicharrones, tamales, ceviche.  You name it, they have it.   And that's just in the deli.  They have a panaderia with all kinds of cakes, flans and pandulce (sweet bread).  I LOOOVE pandulce.  They even have a jugeria (juice bar) tortilleria, and a counter for fresh cheeses and cremas. \n\nAnd the produce?  Cheap and abundant.  I got some bananas and tomatoes just a little over one dollar.  Don't think about getting any organic veggies here.  This isn't the place.  This is also not the place for low-fat shopping either.  But it is so many other great things that the other stores aren't.\n\nBest of all is the atmosphere inside - it is REALLY festive - like you're at Tia and Tio's fiesta.  Mariachis and bands abound here during the weekend.   Dang!!   Fry's, Safeway, Basha's - take note, por favor.

Certainly one of our famous triple digit days, and as I sat in the passenger seat, bumming a ride from mi amigo, Vicente, I couldnt shake my contempt for his leather seats.\n We drove down Roosevelt in the Garfield district towards Ranch Market, on the way discussing the Alwun house, Rito's, and some colourful housing that we both agreed leant to the overall gentrification of the neighborhood.\n The grounds of this place are sprawling, palatial in fact. I was completely ripped and had on a pair of imitation wayfarers that had a broken arm and kept sliding off my face with the least possible movement of my head. \n Endeavoring not to break them further I held my head at rigid attention my back was grammar school like in posture. I then realized how arrogant and white I must've looked, in my mind I fantasized I was a conquistador with a local Toltec guide showing me the ins and outs of the Aztec village we were entering, then I kinda got sick of that phantasy and pictured myself as a balmy Harrison Ford intrepidly following Albert Molina through an alternate ruinous Mayan temple, all the while expecting danger and betrayal at every corner.\n I probably looked half insane as some of the patrons looked at me oddly, giving me a wide birth. Entering the place it's just as big inside. It's like costco and food city had a wild passionate tequila filled tryst and gave birth to the Eva Longoria of grocery stores.\n Vicente and I immediately split up, probably not the best of ideas, but I wanted to explore and he was eager to do the same. I quickly snatched up the worst shopping cart in the store (you know the one with a bad front wheel and sticky grip) and let my stomach guide me.\n Two gallons of horchata. check. Exotic mozzarella style cheese from Oaxaca and  some delicious salty Cotija. check. A lb. of plantains. check. Mango's, apples, dried pinto beans, sugar snap peas, string beans, potato's, roma tomato's- check! \n Grocery shopping while intoxicated can get a little quixotic, and confusing to say the least. I hadnt the slightest clue what I was going to make, but the colors of the produce were certainly alluring.\n Finally Vicente caught up with me and laughed gutturally upon seeing my hodge podge of a shopping cart. I stared thru him with glazed eyes as I espied the \"cafeteria\". I abandoned my shopping cart and slowly walked over, intriguiged, literally beguiled by the aroma of cooked meats. \n I hadnt the slightest clue what most of it was, and what broken Spanish I know certainly wasnt helping with most of the dishes behind the glass, until bingo; Carnitas.\n There was a word I knew and loved, I stared at the \"meat\" not quite convinced I knew what I was looking at. Sure it said carnitas, but this was...well...it resembled a tamarind bean, but was much longer, and had a color ruddy and blackish, certainly most unappealing. The tube like meat sat coiled amongst itself like tentacles in a brackish water. I stared at it hypnotized, until a young Mexican attendant came to take my order. \n \"Hey man what you want?\" he asked, breaking the glamour that held me entranced.\n \"...a half a pound of this...\" I said unsteadily. He looked at me almost impressed, and half cautiously. As he deflty grasped a pair of tongs and started sloshing the meat back and forth in it's brackish juices, attempting a better grip, it looked more alien to me than ever. I was beginning to come to my senses out of a stupor, and it was slowly dawning on me what this was.\n In a slightly horrified and hoarse whisper I leaned over the counter and looked him in the eyes and asked, \"Wait, wait......what is this...stuff!?\"\n Then he said, grinning a knowing, mocking grin, \"Yoo don' know whad tis is and yoo wanna poun' of eet man?\" \n Just then Vicente strolled up casually behind me and saw what I was doing, the two exchanged a brief chuckle as apparently Vin had overheard the attendant's query.\n \"Trrrriiipa!\" Vicente exclaimed, using his dormant mexican accent that usually only comes out when drunk or speaking with his parents, to which the attendant grinned and nodded enthusiatically.\n Aghast, I stepped back in revulsion, I'd nearly ordered a pound of pigs intestines.I felt profoundly embarassed, never more had I shown off the \"pinche gringo\" side of my personality than in that moment. \n I ended up just ordering some pork ribs that'd been marinated in a chile sauce, along with the ubiquitous spanish rice and refried beans.\n I love ranch market, but I'm certainly not going back until the raspberry of embarassment lightens.", "business_id": "VXIkI9_EbDbYHeO9IzKjJg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-06-27", "type": "review"}

I have been to Food City near my house, which I love, but I heard Ranch Market was like a Food City on steroids.\n\nI was disappointed by a few things...\n\nFirst the good. It's huge and has every Mexican delicacy you can think of. Awesome bakery, tortilleria, hot foods, huge cheese section, random pig body parts in the cheese section. \n\nMy tummy was growling so I decided to get a bean burrito before I shopped. The people working there were quite disorganized. There were 2 people ahead of me. I person ordered a cup of green chili and the other person ordered a side of rice. Between 3 employees it took 5 minutes to get our three orders out. After getting my burrito, I turn around and my cart with a couple items in it was gone! I seriously turned my back just for 30 seconds. It was obvious it was mine... hmmmm.\n\nLuckily the burrito was delicious. Do not underestimate the power of a good, simple bean burrito. The tortilla was puffy, the beans creamy, the cheese gooey. Yum.\n\nI go get myself another cart and by the time I get to the produce section I realize the handle of my cart is quite sticky. Yuck. Thank God for hand sanitizer in my purse.\n\nYes, the produce section is huge and has great variety. I saw some childhood favorites there... nopales, jicama, etc. The sale prices on produce were very good. However, the quality of some items were bad. The tomatoes were on sale, but they weren't even ripe. They were pale pink. I didn't even bother. The lemons were mushy and infested with flies. \n\nThe condition of the store in general was run down and dirty. A cooler holding frozen fruit was filthy. The lack of sanitation made me a bit nervous.\n\nAlso making me nervous were the many unsupervised children running amok, pulling things off shelves and just creating chaos. I almost accidentally hit a few with my cart. \n\nStill, I came out of Ranch Market with lots of produce, lots of pork for carnitas, fresh cheeses, fresh tortillas all for under $30. With a delicious bean burrito in my belly. Yep, I call it a good night.", "business_id": "VXIkI9_EbDbYHeO9IzKjJg", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-07-13", "type": "review"}

I asked if they were as good as Rainbow, but she had never tried Rainbow.\n\nSo - we decided to do a taste test.  Three of us in the house - so we would get 3 different (but like) donuts from each.  The plan was to bring them back home, cut to sample size, and note flavor, texture and overall preference.\n\nThe guy roommate's favorite is glazed raised.  The gal leans to sugar raised and I figured glazed old fashioned is a safe baseline for taste testing.\n\nWe went to Rainbow first.  No problem getting the donuts we wanted.  I also picked up a half dozen donut holes.  Was not thrilled to be charged $0.50 for the box, but c'est la vie.  Girl roommate also got a watermelon frappe type of drink.  A bit sweet for my tastes, but very, very watermelony.\n\nNext stop Bosa.  They didn't have regular sugar raised - used powdered sugar instead.  (I have a hard time trusting that the regular sugar didn't stick - somehow they managed to make it work at Rainbow!)  So the granulated vs. powdered sugar raised would not be as scientific a comparison, but we'd make do.  No problem with the glzed and old fashioned.  We also picked up ham and swiss croissants.  One can never have too much pastry, right? :)\n\nResults - \n     Glazed raised - Bosa was slightly denser and chewier - more mouth satisfaction.  Rainbow was cloudlike fluffy and light.  Great texture, but we didn't feel satisfied from chewing.  Rainbow was slightly sweeter.\n          ~Votes - 3 for Bosa.~\n     Old Fashioned - textures were identical.  Rainbow had a slight lemon (or maybe aspatrame?) flavor in the back end of the tasting.\n          ~Votes - 1 slight lean to Bosa, 2 Draw~\n     Sugar raised - texture of donut was identical to glazed raised above.  (duh - same donut, different topping.)  The gal roomie likes granulated.  The guy roomie preferred the powdered.  I liked both.\n          ~Votes - 1 Bosa, 1 Rainbow, 1 Draw.\n\nSo, Bosa comes out with a slight edge.  And we came out with a slight sugar rush.

Alcohol selection is great, and the Kirkland brand is generally quite good for a house label.  \n\nGas is also up to 30 cents cheaper per gallon. Very convenient for those of us who live nearby. I don't drive a fancy car so I'm not concerned about it possibly not having additives like the \"top tier\" brands. My family has been getting Costco gas for years and our vehicles are going strong with 215,000+ miles.  The rewards of the AMEX card pays for my membership so it's basically free and then some.  \n\nCosto has everything: food, clothes, jewelry, electronics, housewares, liquor, wine, beer, sugar, salt, toys, towels, juicers, movie tickets, drugs, vacations, coffins (save a family member some trouble later on?).  Do your research and find out what's worth buying or not.  \n\nI dream of the $1.50 polish sausage and soda.

What the heck are you doing to the bananas???  I mean, I know the sign says, \"Control Ripening Technology\" but this so-called \"technology\" is making your bags of bananas turn into bags of banana mush.\n\nBasically, I buy the bananas. I leave them in the bag. The bag assures me that moisture in the bag is good for my bananas.  But, THE BAG IS WRONG.  My bananas get soggy. The peel falls off. The banana turns brown.  \n\nIf I try to eat the bananas immediately, when I break one off, it breaks away the peel from the other bananas because the moisture has made the skin weak and useless. So now I have a bunch of partly unpeeled bananas.  It is madness.  \n\nI will cut you slack because they are insanely cheap and you give me free samples of tuna fish on fancy crackers, but Costco, it is time to reject that stupid technology and put the holes back in the bag. Or, just stop selling bananas because as of right now you are reeking havoc on our local garbage men who are forced to deal with garbage cans full of bananas mush.  I know, in the realm of trash, banana mush is seemingly innocent, but that stuff LEAKS.  Then you step in it and your shoe becomes squeaky. The mush leaks onto other bags  and then you have banana mush laden trash that attracts fruit flies.  Nothing annoys me more than fruit flies. (And, apparently I speak for all trash men.)

Plenty of living room furniture to sit on and kill time.)\n\nMeandering inside to the Tire Department I was greeted by a lovely chap. (I believe his name is Rene.)\n\nRene: [Sprinting across the floor] Have you been helped? Can I help?\nMe: [Still mentally sluggish] Uh...yes. My tire is ...\n\n[I stare around looking for a word.]\n\nMe: Flat. \n[It's not my fault I like Guinness.]\n\nRene: Ok! Let's go look. \n[Starts a walk so fast thru the parking lot I struggle to keep up.]\n\nRene examines my tire visually. As there is no visible signs of damage my tire is then misted with a soap spray. Still, nada. I head inside to start a work order. I meet Mari, cute as a button, who has more energy than a tween. [I suspect Marie was not out drinking Guinness like a champ six hours prior.]\n\nAs Mari enters my information my mind wanders to the cost of a new tire. Despondent over the fashion things that will be affected by this un-planned cost I inquire on tire pricing.\n\nMari did not laugh at me. \nNo, I don't know the kind of tires on my car.\nNo, I don't really know the year of my car.\nNo, I don't know if my Ford Escape is an xlt. (What the hell is that? This New York City girl bought a car. There are wheels on it. One of them was flat at an ungodly hour on a Sunday.)\n\nWell. Hang on. Mari did laugh, but *with* me.\nYes, I am a fool as to all things car.\n\nApproximately two hours later Mari rang me and I headed back. First Mari, then Rene, explained the steps taken to test my tire. In English. Not a damn thing wrong with it. Highly probable a rapscallion LET THE AIR OUT on purpose. (Thanks to whomever for that.) Just in case, Rene replaced the air valve stem.\n\nTen minutes later my tire is plopped back onto my car. My car has been vacuumed (!) and I was free to go.\n\nHere's the crazy thing:\nCostCo didn't charge me a penny. I sucked up their time and energy. My Dad had sent me there saying \"they're good\". I had no idea. (Pfft! Tires? Aren't they all the same?) \n\nAfter yesterday I know where I'll be shopping for tires when it is time. Customer Service goes an amazing way.

I think this store (this location!) feels like home. Everyone is very nice.  When you walk in the first thing you see are the beautiful and unique display of flowers. Go  forward and you will walk into the fresh produce, and again a very unique assortment. Each department if filled with very knowledgeable employees who are happy to help you. In the back on the produce area is my favorite, the Italian kitchen. GREAT PIZZA!! there is always 2 to 3 pizza available by slice, but if you call ahead they can make you any specialty pizza you want. Next up is the butchers corner. Fresh seafood, beautiful cuts of meat, and some already done up wings, twice baked potatoes, ribs, the lists goes on. next big section is the booze. A whole wall of specialty beers, rows on fabulous wines and a great aisle of liquor and yummy choices to mix that with. As far as i know, AJs can order anything you want, but they don't have. Keep walking and you will find delicious cheese's and olives. Moving on to the salad bar and you have found lunch!! very fresh lettuces,romaine and mixed greens,  spinish,turkey, chicken. peppers, the list goes on. If its a chili outside AJs always has at least 1 daily soup available. Plus a deli with hot food and every kind of sandwich you want. almost to checkout and you will be stopped by the beautiful display of baked goods. From just a slice of cheesecake, to cookies. Go in before work and you will be taken away by the Illy coffee, and pastries. Enough said.\nPS there are 5-6 rows of specialty barbecue sauces,rubs,anything you want to bake with yadda yadda yadda.", "business_id": "Mng1FUcW-xRSdsDkowQm2Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-08-02", "type": "review"}

They NEVER responded,  and now I can no longer, in good conscience,  shop there because of their apathy.\n\n\"I'm writing, because I had an experience at your store that I just can't stop thinking about. I visited last Sunday, Oct. 30th- close to closing time. As I was checking out, the cashier (a younger man- he looked like he might be of Latino decent) was incredibly polite and professional. However, I had a very negative/offensive experience with another employee of your store that appeared to have just finished her shift and was waiting in line behind me to make a purchase (she was a middle aged woman, with dyed blond hair and heavy eye make-up). As my friend and I were making our purchase, we briefly chatted with the kind cashier. I, in error, went to the wrong place to check out. Your cashier made a friendly comment about how at Costco they have arrows to guide people and that it was an easy mistake for me to go to the wrong spot. It was just friendly rapport. I suppose he was trying to ease my mind in case I felt embarrassed, which I appreciated the gesture. \n\nAnyhow, while he was talking with my friend and myself, the woman interrupts and starts loudly saying to the cashier helping us, and I am QUOTING her, \"Not MY Costco, you live with 'needy' people! You go to the 'needy' people Costco. My Costco is beautiful because there aren't any 'needy' people there. I live in a different city than YOU. I don't live amongst 'needy' people. We're not needy where I live like YOUR city\". \n\nSadly, I am not exaggerating this in anyway. I was completely appalled by the lack of  basic manners. \n\nThis woman is completely unprofessional. Regardless of her personal feelings towards wherever the young man lives or her delusional superiority over \"needy\" people... laughable, since she is working at a grocery store but that's beside the point. I can not believe she would have the audacity to speak to this young man in this manner in front of CUSTOMERS. \n\nDespite her rude, insensitive and unprofessional comments, the young man remained gracious and kind and never said and unkind word or even gave an unkind glance while this woman was attempting to belittle and humiliate him in front of customers. She is lucky that I was too shocked by her behavior to say something at the time, because I am and was completely disgusted. This has left a lasting impression, a negative one to say the least, and I certainly hope that you have a talk with this woman about basic manners and conduct- even if I wasn't present- her behavior is basically harassment and no person should have to deal with such ignorance and insensitivity.\"", "business_id": "Mng1FUcW-xRSdsDkowQm2Q", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-07-04", "type": "review"}

In the case of Fry's, they typically ignore you when you come to the window, take 40-minutes to fill any prescription - even something that's in a box and all they have to do is pull it off the shelf. I've even had them take 40-minutes and then tell me that they were out of the medicine and I needed to go to another store.\n\nEnough about Fry's - eventually I'll write a review of them - and back to today's tremendous experience at Walgreen's.\n\nBecause my in-law's are currently out of town, I agreed to pick up a prescription for my wife's grandmother and deliver it to her nursing home. My mother-in-law told me that I could just go through the drive-through and get it. Unfortunately, when I got there it turned out the refill had never been ordered. \n\nLuckily, the pharmacist looked in the computer, determined the needed medication, put in the refill and told me it would be ready in 20-minutes.\n\nI took my kids to run another errand and then came back to the store. When we came back to the drive-through, the first pharmacist still couldn't find the prescription in the system. However, instead of giving me the brush-off, as the would have at Fry's, she went and found the pharmacist I had talked with 20-minutes earlier. As it so happened, that pharmacist was in the midst of filling the prescription and they had the medication to me in less than 5-minutes.\n\nDespite the fact that Fry's is just around the corner, I may be transferring the family prescriptions to Walgreen's.

If you are (were) like me and had no idea how it works or if it's legit, here you go:\n\nAbout once a year I find myself in need of minor medical attention and without a primary care physician. I usually skirt the issue by having plenty of family in the medical profession that can call me in a prescription for whatever ailment I have self-diagnosed (ear infection, sinus infection, worse than usual allergies, etc.) \n\nIt's not that I wouldn't love a primary care physician to call my own - he would be old, gentle and white haired (not hasty, distracted, a bad listener or curt, like most doctors). But I am a generally healthy procrastinator, so when I had a cold that I suspected was turning into a sinus infection, I couldn't wait three weeks to six months for an opening at an office -- that is, of course, if they're accepting new patients at all. \n\nSo this Walgreens business - though strange, I admit - appealed to my urgency. It's an urgent care, basically, with a nurse practitioner on staff at more reasonable hours than a doctor's office, slightly less convenient hours than an ER or UC. It seems like a good bet when you pretty much already know what's wrong and you just need the appropriate signature to get the drugs you need to get better faster.\nI called to make sure they took my insurance and was told the copayment would be the same as a specialist. The deal is you walk in - no appointments, ever - and sign yourself in at the kiosk. Basic info only: name, number, zip, and check from list of typical maladies and then it gives you a wait time. In my case - 1 hour, 20 minutes. So at this point I'm at the same wait and cost as Urgent Care. Bummer.\nLuckily I work just across the street, so go back to the office for an hour and come back. Of course, my name was called while I was gone. So I re-enter at the kiosk (frustrating that there is no actual person to address concerns) and am given no wait time this go round. So I just sit and wait. About 10 minutes later the nurse emerges and bc there was no one ahead of me this time, I'm taken to a back room where we go thru the rigmarole that front desk admin usually takes care of before hand, so that took another 10 minutes.\nWe finally get to the medical assessment, which was taking my temp., checking my lungs and heartbeat and looking in my ears, nose and throat. That took about three minutes and my self diagnosis was confirmed. She entered my prescriptions into the computer which is automatically sent right out to the pharmacy outside and I'm done. Oh, turns out my copay was less than I was told, which was nice. (If you don't have insurance it's like $70 - yowza!)\n\nAll in all, it was convenient in a pinch and got my drugs same day. The nurse was nice enough. But I'll still put \"find a primary care physician\" on my to-do list.\n\nAlso, as someone noted, this location attracts a lot of crazies and weirdos - perhaps bc of its proximity to the LR station and Central Ave in general.", "business_id": "HfWkdqxegjiGEXzI8j7Wwg", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-08-25", "type": "review"}

I'll try to be as detailed as possible, as this review may be used in court one day. First, let me say I have a chronic condition and I am a polite and easy-to-get-along-with \"regular\" of this pharmacy. I've never had an issue before tonight. Efran, who I normally deal with in the pharmacy, is a great guy- super friendly and always smiling. Monica, the manager, was very responsive and polite when I called her tonight. Hopefully, she will resolve the pharmacist's problem.\n\nHowever:\n\nI badly injured my finger and it became infected. It is swollen to triple size and a doctor had to slice it open today to drain the puss. The doctor used zero anesthetic, but he had good reason. That's another story.\n\nSo he gave me a prescription for 15 Vicodin and 20 antibiotics. I wasn't picking up 200 Oxycontin tablets or doing anything weird. It was a small amount of pain pills and antibiotics to match. My injury was also very visible on my right hand.\n\nI was asked for ID, which is understandable, because I was picking up a regulated narcotic. I get that.\n\nSo I hand the pharmacist a government issued photo ID. The government ID had a matching address to my prescription. In addition to that, I had an ASU student ID, a credit card (that I was paying for the prescriptions with), and my insurance card ...and I also had a visible injury. A visibly infected injury on my hand, and I was picking up the exact prescription that would match the physical evidence.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that it was crystal clear that I was who I claimed to be.\n\nHowever, the photo ID that I showed was unique. Only certain people get to carry it. I am not saying my ID was a green card (and I'm not saying it wasn't), but a green card would be an example of a government photo ID that is not commonly shown.\n\nBut if you are visiting from a foreign country, for example, and you are here legally, you should be able to get prescriptions that you need. I know that Arizonans aren't fond of illegal aliens, but people that are here legally should be able to get medication if they are sick.\n\nNot at this Walgreens. The pharmacist declared, in front of witnesses, that they won't serve everyone. If you are visiting this country, go elsewhere. The pharmacist at this Walgreens will not help you.\n\nUpon inspecting my government issued, legal photo ID (that the bank accepts by the way), the pharmacist said, \"I'll take it this time, but next time, you'll need an ID from the DMV.\"\n\nFrom the DMV! Can you believe it? She actually said \"from the DMV.\" \n\nI said: \"That's a legal government-issued photo ID. You can't deny me.\"\n\nShe then arrogantly proclaimed: \"I am the pharmacist and that is our policy! We need an ID from the DMV!\"\n\nI protested, because, since I don't drive, just going to the DMV is a tremendous pain in the butt. And what law says that you need DMV ID? Who says that you are required to visit the DMV ever? As far as I know, you just need to be able to prove that you are here legally. My ID proved I was here legally. And again, it was government issued photo ID.\n\nUpon me protesting, she snatched my prescriptions from the cashier (all on videotape) and said, \"Then I won't give them to you if you want to argue!\"\n\nOkay, so this girl has a power-struggle issue. I get it. \n\nI'm in agony, and I know when I am dealing with a nut-job, so I satisfied her narcissism and agreed that yes, she was the pharmacist and no, my ID wasn't good enough. And she handed me my prescriptions. Thank God. You see, it was never about the ID. Otherwise, I wouldn't have my Vicodin right now. It was about exerting control over a customer. A regular customer that has spent over a thousand dollars in that store, in 2012.\n\nShe actually held pain medication over my head, until I agreed to her illegal, discriminatory policy.\n\nSo, in a state of duress, desperate, I relented. I said, \"Okay. I agree.\" (clenching my teeth in agony)\n\nAs I was walking out, I turned to her and said, \"I am now going to write a review online.\"\n\nShe replied: \"Good! Go ahead.

I was than greeted by someone (I have no idea if he was a doctor, a nurse or the receptionist). This person never introduced himself, walked me into a room with someone else's stuff. He was a young guy in his 20s with clearly very little professional experience. When I told him I wanted a physical, he let out a big sigh as if I was causing him an inconvenience. He asked me why I hasn't filled out paperwork (which were nowhere to be seen) and grabbed the papers I had brought (for the physical). He stared at the papers and  looked at them as if they were written in a foreign language. He let out another sigh. It was at this point that he wanted to start the exam, but it was also at this point that I decided I wasn't comfortable with this person ( who was frazzled, unprofessional and still hadn't introduced himself to me).

The staff who used to be nice are long gone, replaced by kids who think it's funny to allow line jumpers and staff who move at the speed of slow and look resentful at doing their jobs.\n\nPrices are up dramatically, while the fresh fruit is gone, many of the fresh foods are gone, the housewares section has lost its verve. You can still get bargains in the beauty section, but otherwise you will be paying through the nose for convenience (plus the privilege of being treated rudely).\n\nQuality has also generally declined. The house brand cat litter, which used to be great, is now as useless as beach sand and exists solely so you remember how the box stank all week and pay double the going rate for Tidy Cat. The $15 rayon dresses -- wonderful for summer around the house -- are now so skimpy that I can barely get my arms through the arm holes (they used to err the other direction). \n\nAs the place has declined, the clientele has gotten sketchier, too. You now have less chance of being hassled and hustled at Fortess CVS down on McDowell, which is adjacent to a homeless encampment.\n\nNext time I need cat litter, I'm setting the alarm early and going to Walmart when it's not hotter than the surface of the sun here. When your service makes the Christown Walmart look like Nordstrom, you're doing it wrong.\n\n(The funny thing is, before the Great Recession, stores cared about customer service. Now that same-store sales are in the low single digits, if not actually negative, and chains are struggling to hold stable against the behemoth of Amazon, the prevailing customer service attitude is \"Don't like it?

I'm always on the lookout for a local joint that is special, a place I can take out-of-towners and say, \"This is one more thing I love about Phoenix.\" I had high expectations for SunUp since it is in my neighborhood, a short ride or healthy walk away from home\n\nBut after several visits over the last couple of months and as many disappointments, SunUp Brewing is on my list of places I might go if I'm desperate, not as a destination, and certainly not a place I want representing my city to friends from elsewhere.\n\nI'm no beer aficionado, but I know what I like, and for the most part I like the brews at SunUp. I particularly enjoy the Light Rail Pale Ale as a mild-bodied thirst-quencher, and the Vanilla Porter, which is rich without being too sweet or heavy. I also like seeing what seasonal offerings they have, many of which I enjoyed.\n\nOne constant on my many visits, however, is the truly bad customer service. I don't care if you make minimum wage or six figures; if your job is to take orders and serve people, then do it. Many other Yelp reviewers indicate they have suffered lackadaisical customer service at SunUp, and my experience is that this is the rule, not the exception.\n\nTake today, for example: At 1 p.m. on a Sunday, the place was virtually empty save for about three tables and a couple in the main bar area. The last problem I thought I'd have would be getting attention, but my disinterested server/bartender pulled a disappearing act after pouring my beer and plopping my burger in front of me. She was more interested in sitting in a booth in the adjacent room with a paper in front of her, watching TV.\n\nIf she had bothered to follow up with her customer, she would've learned my burger was the opposite of the medium-rare burger I ordered. Even more aggravating was when she did walk quickly past me (including one time when she told the other server she as heading out back, presumably for a break), she looked directly at my barely touched meal but didn't inquire as to why I wasn't eating it. I'm not going to chase down a server, especially if it involves going room to room to find her. All she had to do was notice I hadn't touched my meal for 20 minutes and ask if everything was OK.\n\nI've had similar experiences with the staff at SunUp before although this example was the most egregious. Like other reviewers, I've waited at the bar either with a growler ready to be filled or a bill I'm trying to pay while the bartender chatted with friends even after acknowledging me.\n\nIt shouldn't be this hard to find a place that wants to sell me something, but evidently the folks at SunUp have more cash than they need, so I see no reason to spend mine there again.", "business_id": "3UMcsN9IjoeV8JZvC4apag", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-06-27", "type": "review"}

You wouldn't think this place is a brewery because of its small size but it is.  The inside is very quaint and taverny.  It has a very relaxed vibe going on.\n\nI ordered the sampler and all their beers are pretty decent.  I decided on the Amber for my pint, but they were all good so it was a difficult decision.  Not bad for a little local brewery at all.  For a quick bite before we moved on we ordered the calamari and the bratwurst splitter.  The calamari was pretty standard and the aioli had a nice kick to it.  The bratwurst was excellent and unique.  Each was perfect to split among 4 people.  The rest of their menu looked good but is pretty much typical bar food.  Well probably a bit better than average bar food.  Anyway, it is perfect food for the place and looking back we should have probably eaten dinner there instead of only an appetizer.\n\nPro Tip:  Cross over to the north side of the street at the light as soon as you exit the light rail station.

I was a fan when it was still Sonora Brewhouse, and I was a fan after the name change/change of ownership/whatever.  The waitstaff was always sort of iffy, but the patio was comfortable (when smokers weren't around), and the food was pretty consistent.  I was particularly in love with a new addition to the menu - the spicy pulled pork sandwich.\n\nIn search of a good place open on July 4th, I stopped in with a friend, already craving that delicious sandwich.  After waiting a couple minutes to be seated (and not even being acknowledged by anyone when we entered), we were led to a table by an older woman.  She took our drink orders and left us with menus to look over.  It took me a minute to realize they'd changed their menu.  Instead of one with appetizers, salads, sandwiches/burgers, entrees, and desserts, they instead now have a lunch and dinner menu.  And, sadly, the pulled pork sandwich had been discontinued.  I settled on the green chile chicken sandwich of some sort and an iced tea.  The waitress wasn't very friendly and seemed to be uninterested in being pleasant.  Our meals arrived but without the chipotle ketchup we requested.  A few minutes later, the waitress brought it to our table.  There was nothing impressive about my sandwich.  It was fairly blah and unseasoned, and the sweet potato fries were crispy on the outside but tough and hard on the inside.  Shame I paid $1 to upgrade from regular fries.\n\nOnce it came time to pay, the waitress took an exceptionally long time to return our cards and receipts to us.  My companion saw she was just standing around in the back not doing anything.  The place was pretty empty, so I don't really know why service was so bad.

It was busy, not crowded and we were seated right away.  The decor is very basic  - there is a bar and two rooms with table seating.  I didn't ask about the brewing facilities or if there is a tour as we were more interested in catching up with our sons after being out of town for a while.  After perusing the beer menu (all beer is brewed on site) I decided to have the Trooper IPA, others had the porter and pale ale.  There were a nice number of special seasonal beers on the menu and they also have a full bar for non-beer drinkers.  All were quite tasty and refreshing.  We ordered pretzel bites and wings for appetizers.  The wings were medium, with most of the flavor coming from the rub which gave them a nice crispy crunch while being juicy on the inside.  The pretzel bites were soft and  chewy with a creamy cheese sauce with a bit of a bite.\n\nFor dinner I had pork and green chili which was a nice stew that came with soft tortilla wedges that had been roasted on the griddle.  Nice blend of flavors in the stew - spice level was moderate (see my review of The Shed) but still quite nice and satisfying.  For the stew I switched to their SB 1030 Session Pale Ale, the crispness of which paired nicely with the stew.  If you don't know, SB 1030 was the Arizona law that allowed craft breweries and small batch wineries to compete on a more even footing with the large distributors and enabled many more craft breweries to open in the state (yea!).\n\nI would definitely go back and if you live in this area and are into craft beer you must make this a regular stop.", "business_id": "3UMcsN9IjoeV8JZvC4apag", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-06-27", "type": "review"}

When I got there she right away told me it was the apricot i ordered. i told her it did not taste like apricot (and neither did the other 8 people in our party) she tasted it and said its apricot. i said well maybe its a bad batch because it did not taste like the usual apricot we order or eat on their cookies. after thinking i was going to say okay and go home, i told her to take it to the owner so i could get my money back. they had me waiting for 10 minutes before this emormous man (6'6 and 340)comes out from the back room. He said with his deep voice  \"i tasted MY cake and its fine\". i could not believe this man actually tasted the cake. this just set me off. i told him you think your a big man and your going to imitimidate me by your size? he got sassy and said do you want me to get down to your level? i am 5'4. what a complete idiot. now remember i have been buying items at this place and their prior location for over 30 years. he argued with me for over 5 minutes and believe me i arged right back with him, he wasnt going to try to intimidate me (which i am sure he is use to because all of the employees couldnt believe i wasnt backing down to him).\ni am soooo disappointed with the actions of the owner and the manager that we will NEVER go back. These little bakeries then wonder why they have to close their doors. \nBy the way i am not the only one to complain about the taste of the products at this bakery, i would STAY AWAY and find a place that is resepctful to a customers first visit or 10k visit.", "business_id": "vaqmESluryt5i4Wbkb6KRA", "stars": 1, "date": "2008-07-31", "type": "review"}

That meant I was going to miss my little sister's baby shower! :(  That made me incredibly sad.  What made me even sadder was her tearfully explaining to me that the baby shower her (bossy) mother in law was organizing for her was a hot-ass mess, AND that her mother in law was refusing to provide a cake for the shower!\n\n\"Ah ha\" I thought!  \"I can save the day from my hospital bed AND provide a kick ass cake for her baby shower!  Yay!!\"  \n\nSo I called Karsh's because they have some of the most YUMMYTASTIC cakes I've ever tasted...  Well, my first call to Karsh's didn't go so well because the first employee I spoke to didn't seem too interested in helping me AT ALL (it was close to closing time apparently) so I decided to call back the next day.  On my second call to Karsh's I reached an employee who said he was a manager, so I explained to him that I was stuck in the hospital, but that I would like to order a baby shower cake for my little sister's baby shower in a couple of weeks and that I would pay for it over the phone with my credit card and that my husband would pick it up for me the day of the shower.  He said he would be happy to help me with this order.  I told him what size I needed and what flavors we'd like for the cake and then he asked me about a decoration for the cake and I told him that her baby shower theme was baby turtles and baby owls, and maybe could they do something with that theme in mind...?  He said 'sure' and I assumed that dealing with a professional bakery and all, that they'd do something nice within those parameters.  \n\nHoly Mary, Mother of God, was I dead wrong about THAT.\n\n\nYou see the day of the shower arrived and my husband ran over to Karsh's Bakery and picked up the cake (and trust me, it wasn't a cheap cake) and then he brought that big, pink bakery box over to my hospital room so that when my little sister popped in to see me before going to her shower, I could surprise her with a beautiful cake to take to her party.\n\nWell, let me tell you what, my husband opened the tape sealing the edges of that pink bakery box so I could get a sneak peek and my face just froze in an expression of utter horror...  The idiots who decorated her cake over at Karsh's Bakery went and printed out an ugly black and green edible image of a giant sea turtle and plastered that monstrosity across the front of my sister's baby shower cake!!  And then in teeny tiny pink letters at the bottom of the photograph wrote \"Welcome Baby Emma\".\n\nI have never cried so hard in my LIFE!!  I think my nurses were worried I was going to go into labor I was so upset and sobbing.  Seriously, I was a wreck.\n\n\nI was crushed.  It was the ugliest, MOST disastrous mess you've ever seen.  I seriously cried for hours and I couldn't even look at my little sister when she came to my room to see what the \"big surprise\" was that I had for her that day.  I hid my face in my pillow quietly sobbing and pretended to be sleeping when she came by.\n\nIt was the most unprofessional thing you've EVER seen.  :(  \n\nWe should have taken a picture of it for the cake wrecks blog, but I was so distraught that I didn't want to look at it anymore.\n\nMy family still put on a brave face and took that monstrosity to her baby shower, while I hid in my hospital room and sobbed, and while everyone who saw it all agreed it was hideous, they also said it was quite delicious.  \n\nThankfully my sister was quite a good sport about it and thanked me profusely for the gesture.  I think she knew my intentions were good.\n\nSo there you have it; take it for what it's worth.  Karsh's makes delicious cakes, as long as you don't mind your 'adorable' baby shower cake looking like some Jacques Cousteau nature photograph out of a dusty old circa. 1960's textbook with some tiny, unprofessional greeting piped out frosting at the bottom of the ridiculous photograph.", "business_id": "vaqmESluryt5i4Wbkb6KRA", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-06-25", "type": "review"}

They had a huge selection (probably too big which was why things weren't as fresh as expected) plus Polish grocery items and an area for sandwiches. \nThis would be the perfect place for someone from/a fan of east-central Europe food and goods but for someone who just wanted a super tasty cake, it didn't hit the spot.

Still early for lunch.  No one around, see?\nI walk in and the place, it don't look like no sub shop, ya know.  Looks solely like a nice little authentic Italian grocery, you get me?  I like it.  They got everything there, and my eyes are buggin outta my head like *this*, see?\nI mean, I'm lookin' at this quaint package that looks like it could either have a bottle of, emm... a Sangiovese, or maybe even a nice Dolcetto for the lady types.\nAnd, then they got these tins of all kinds of olive oils.  They got these dried salamis and a big thing like *this* of Prosciutto.  There's a nice little case there of homemade pastries that were tasty just by lookin at 'em.  Jars of authentic sauces up the wazzoo!\nI dunno, what am I sayin'?!  GET OUTTA 'ERE!... they ain't got no Safeway stuff here, c'mon!  Hckck!\nI just ain't seen so much authentic Italian stuff.  And the place, you know, it's 'bout as small as one-a those swanky studios downtown, and they got it packed to the chin.  But hey, I digress, look at me!\n\nSo, I looks up at the menu and I sees they got \"Italian Sub\" up there as one of their six or seven sa'mmiches.  It's nice, ya know?  So hey, anyone can claim to make an 'Italian' sub, so I gotta ask to make sure.  I ain't a fool!  Hahaha!... ok, knoggitoff, listen!...\n\nThis guy comes up to the deli case and he looks to be a nice enough gentleman.  He's got his apron on to keep himself proper, a conservative pair of prescription sunglasses that you can still see him look you politely in the eyes like you're family, and the guy even cleans his hands before he's ready to listen to what I gotta say.  Hey, that's class, and respect!  Other places don't know about that.\n\nSo, this is what I asks, I asks this right here... I says, \"What's in the Italian sub?\"\nGuy goes through a quick list with his fingers: \"Three meats, cheese, tomato, lettuce and dressing.\"\nHey!  That's perfect!  You can't get anymore honest than that, and that's the best that I need to know.\nSo, \"Ok\", I says, \"I'll have one\", and he gives me a nod.\n\nSo, this guy gets to putting my sub together, and I see he's just graceful at it, like he's just pulling the elements outta thin air.  Not like those kids over there at Mr. Subways, acting all confused and empty like a clan a-mice with hats on, forced to stand two inches from one another for 8 hours!\n\nI mean, this Niccoli guy's just effortless, putting a little a-this, a little a-that, and - DONE!\n\nI sh*t you not, jerky, it takes this guy no more than 40 seconds to put that thing together!\n\nI ask for a bagga chips, too.  He asks if I might want a drink, but I thank him and pass, since I got one back at work.\nNine bucks and change it costs me.  The size of this thing, though, they aren't faking 'cuz I can see this sub's an honest foot!  And, I can already smell the dressing and salami from it!\n\n\"You have a good day\", he says.\n\"Thanks.  You too\", I reply.\n\nI get back to my desk, and I unwrap this thing, and it's just like the guy said: it's stacked, but not too ridiculous like.  It's holding everything nicely and naturally like.\nI take my first bite, and it feels like... it feels like... I'd been reborn.  This thing is the best sub I've had since... since I been born!\nIt's dripping a little with the purest most wonderful olive oil I ain't tasted before, and that bread roll I tell ya, it's keeping fresh and crisp like it's just meant to be!  I can't believe it!  I had to set the thing down as I was chewing, sit back in my chair and close my eyes, and just... LIVE!  That salami, too!  And, there's provolone and ham!  It's all fresh.  And, there's even some herbs in that dressing that made me feel like an a**hole in heaven.  I ain't never been treated to a sub like that.  THAT'S Italian!\n\nYou gotta get one a-these!\n\nHey, you got some schmootz there on the side-a your mouth from droolin.  Go over there to Niccoli's.

We are from NY and have Italian in our blood. We are used to good Italian delis in NY.  Yours doesn't even come close.  I should have realized when there was no smell of cheese when we walked in.

After filling my arms with products to make a homemade Italian meal, I then made my way to the counter and my mouth started watering as I read about all the sandwiches and menu items they offer.

My coworker and I were waiting for a movie across the street and decided to try and beat the heat by getting some ice cream. I have allergies to soy so I have to be very careful about what I eat as it is in *everything* these days. There were two gentlemen in the store one dark haired and kinda sullen looking,  the other heavy set. I failed to get their names as I was quickly put out by our experience and just wanted to leave. \nThe heavy set guy was busy with a customer so we asked the dark haired one if there was nutritional information available and politely explained I had allergies and had to be aware of everything I eat. He looked at us blankly and kind of put out sounding responded \"I have it in a book.\" There was a pause as he just stood there staring like we were some sort of circus oddity. Finally, my coworker politely asked if we could see the book. Without saying anything and with a slight roll of his eyes he turned, grabbed the book and shoved it in my face kinda rudely. I took it from him and turned away from him because it was clear he had some sort of problem. I remarked to my coworker \"Friendly... Love that\" because he clearly was not.\nPerhaps he despised his low paying job. Perhaps he thought we looked too low class to be in his presence. Perhaps he was having a bad day. Perhaps he was just a jerk. Whatever the case, his unfriendliness and and our unwelcome  were palpable. I flipped absentely through the book but quickly decided I really had a problem giving money to a store who had employees that seemed to think openly treating customers with disrespect was okay . Handing the book back to the employee in question, I smiled and said thank you as we left. As if this wasn't enough, as we were leaving I noted that he never took his eyes off of us and even kind of elbowed his co worker and started making some sort of comment while staring us down through the window of the store as we left. They chuckled amongst themselves if full view of us as I watched. They seemed not to care that I could see their every move. \nWhen I called back after we left and asked to speak to a manager, at first I was put on hold while whoever answered said they would go get the manager. A couple seconds later, the same person came back and said, \"Oh I'm sorry. She's not here.\" He then informed me he had no idea when she would be back in. \nCall me crazy, but I find it hard to believe in a store of that size one could be unaware their manager was no longer in the store and further could not give me any sort of estimation of when she was expected except to say she was \"usually\" around in the morning. \nAt any rate, I have scarcely been treated so rudely in a customer service environment ever. So, to the manager, whoever you may be, I would suggest you inform your employee he should endeavor to adjust his attitude towards paying customers if he intends to continue working with the public. Honestly, I really don't care what his problem was. Not my issue. I couldn't care any less what he thought of me or my coworker. However, I steadfastly refuse to give my hard earned money to a store which allows this kind of blatantly unacceptable behavior from one of its employees. Next time, I'll just find a Ben and Jerry's or simply endure the heat without aid.", "business_id": "PIu2Rocm6_Vyp2M3v6TKdA", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-06-28", "type": "review"}

Having known the family of this establishment my whole life, I can personally attest to their devotion to their food, the customers and the atmosphere.  The Garcia family first hit a home run with their original deli location at Christown Mall.  When they moved out of Christown they opened up a pair of locations with huge fanfare both at the Colonade and at Arrowhead Mall.  To be honest, I didn't think the Colonade would do all that well as they were invisible from Camelback Road.  Little did I know the following this place had.  Everytime I've gone the place has been jumping.  And rightfully so.\n\nWhen you walk in you immediately notice the fun color scheme as well as how clean it looks.  The aroma from the hot line is as alluring as you'd expect.  No waiters or reservations here.  Just hop in line and order your dish from the cooks as they make it right in front of you.\n\nMy tried and true favorite is the brisket sandwich on kaiser bread with a side of fruit and a slice of one of their fresh pies to boot.  Sometimes I'll grab some pastrami or corn beef as an alternative.  They've also got burgers and kosher hot dogs if you prefer.  Other sides include chili, fries, mac and cheese, or one of a number of soups.  The food is delicious but simple.  And whatever you order, you'll feel like you're in a New York style deli (without the NY attitude of course).\n\nSo why only 4 stars instead of 5?  Well for one, this hip deli near the Biltmore area isn't cheap.  True, you get what you pay for, but I couldn't afford to eat here everyday.  A good meal here usually runs around $15 -$20 so just be aware of that.  Also, this place is wicked busy, especially during dinner.  Usually you can find a seat, but it can get pretty noisy in there.  Don't let this scare you away though.  Especially if you live in the central Phoenix area.  Alot of the folks who eat here are people from the neighborhood so its highly possible you'll run into someone you know.  If you're on the west side, their location at Arrowhead Mall won't disappoint either.  \n\nLet's give props to the folks at Miracle Mile.  This small family operation has grown by leaps and bounds over the years, but you'd never know it talking to the owners.  The same humble attention to good food, a good atmosphere, and a neighborhood following still holds strong after all these years.  Success clearly hasn't changed this family recipe.", "business_id": "fmuj7u1gflmEjW-h0v9bwg", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-08-25", "type": "review"}

This was Hubby's suggestion, mind you, and he was pleased they had several vegetarian options. After a lunch of Peter Piper, however, even his lame veggie sandwich was pretty good to him. We'll see if I have to rush him to the ER later, since MM served sprouts when no one else is right now due to a contamination issue. He got his sandwich with a supposed potato knish. This was supposed to be creamy mashed potatoes with sour cream and seasonings in a pastry crust. What he got was an overly peppered dried out, square of potato chunks in an unnatural color wrapped in an anemic crust that had zero taste, crunch, or flake to it. It had that speckled look that old pastry gets. If this is what a knish is supposed to be, then they nailed it.\n\nI got the chicken and noodles with a side of mashed potatoes. It came with two inexplicable slices of untoasted bread. What is this? 1950? At least it wasn't Wonder Bread. It was wheat. I had asked for sour dough, when one guy told me there were no caraway seeds in the rye they served me initially. There were. The manager \"saved\" me by correcting his employee about the caraway, only to be given the third degree by the ghetto tart working the register. \"Why don't you like caraway?\" she asked. I tried not to stare at her ridiculously over-plucked eyebrows and garish make-up as I replied, \"I really don't like the taste.\" When she asked me \"Why?\" a second time, you'll be happy to know that I refrained from informing her that the gang-bangers she was obviously trying to attract would not likely be frequenting  this establishment. Anyway, the chicken and noodles dish was complete mush and the \"sauce\" was totally canned, and topped with a lovely hunk of congealed cheese. It was also not to temp. The mashed potatoes were 75% instant with some red skins thrown in for that \"real\" texture. Foul, foul, foul. \n\nHence, the grilled cheese.", "business_id": "fmuj7u1gflmEjW-h0v9bwg", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-06-15", "type": "review"}

Of course, knowing their hours definitely helps. After planning on a stop at Blue Fin (which isn't open on the weekends), I ended up at Miracle Mile at Camelback Colonnade following a quick stop at Trader Joe's. I ended up being pleasantly surprised with the result, though the price was a little higher than I had hoped.\n\nWalking in, the decor is pretty laid back; clean and open, with a dessert station right by the door (never a bad idea) and an easy path to the counter. My first time there, so I had to do the \"What do I want?\" walk through the line. Luckily, it was slow, so I was able to pick out the Combo sandwich (pastrami and corned beef). Watching them make the sandwich, you could see how thin cut the meat was, and the marble rye looked fresh (other choices include sourdough, rye, and a few types of buns). There were a multitude of options for sides (french fries, a few pasta salads, etc), but I ended up paying the extra $1 for mac&cheese. From there, it was a quick walk to the register to pay $11 for my meal, along with grabbing some free horseradish.\n\nI took the food home, and it was worth the wait. The sandwich, which seemed a little small when the cook made it, suddenly grew to a thick mass of beef. I even had to pick off a few slices that were falling out before taking a bite. Gotta say, it was excellent. The pastrami and corned beef were a perfect match, and there was just enough fat to give it that extra burst of flavor. They give you regular mustard with the sandwich, but I preferred my own spicy mustard, with the occasional addition of horseradish (which had a good bite). The bread was perfect, and the crust broke away with every bite. Finally, the mac&cheese was a great addition. The flavor could have been stronger, but it was very cheesy and the pasta was firm without being overcooked.\n\nOverall,  this was a pretty good find. As others noted, the price is a little steep for a deli, but you will certainly get a full stomach for around $10, so I can't complain too much.

Over-share honey! I'm supposed to order food and a drink now that we have discussed your butt? Anyway, finally moving on I ordered a tea and my friend got a water. Her timing for check backs were great, but refilled my tea waaaaaay too much, I would take two sips and then there she was again refilling my glass (and filling the air with unnecessary commentary), not to mention when she refilled my glass she had to pick it up every time and twice she touched the times on my forks. I know it sounds weird, but really bothered me. Another one of my big pet peeves, if you are wanting to remove a plate from the table and I have a utensil still on it, ask me to grab it off or just bring me a new one. DO NOT remove it yourself and place on the table, ick! She also grabbed my butter wrapper off my plate touching my bread. Just leave me a lone lady, stop touching all my s***! I felt like she wanted to pop a squat with us and have girl talk. Back off. \n\nThe food came, it was alright. I started with a side salad and friend for fried artichoke hearts. My salad clearly had been pre made and sitting in a cooler for hours, as the lettuce was brown and over dressed. The artichokes were good and the dipping sauce it came with was yummy. Everything else that hit the table was great. PS: Vanilla bean cheese cake is awesome! \n\nOver all we had a good time.

I'm not much of a fan of chain restaurants, but I must say the decor and ambiance have been nice and the restaurant always clean. \n\nOn a past visit I had a Buffalo Chicken sandwich which is no longer on the menu...and probably with good reason. It was the sort of quality I'd expect from a fast food drive-thru, only a larger portion and served on a plate. This time, I had the Cuban Sandwich with a Green Salad side. The sandwich wasn't bad, just not memorable. The portion was plenty for lunch and some to take home. My friend had the equivalent of Chicken Parmesan with a side of spaghetti (don't see it currently listed on their website menu) which he downed in no time, despite the large portion. At the server's recommendation, we shared the Hershey\u00ae's Chocolate Bar Cheesecake, which was fresh and flavorful. \n\nThe second server (the first one's shift had ended) was late in bringing some water I'd asked for. While I wasn't concerned about it, he noticed his own service was too slow and he promised to \"make it up\" to me. Not sure what that meant and I never saw any benefit. \n\nWhile the portions were more than ample, I'm not sure the prices are in line for the quality being offered. Two lunch entrees with nonalcoholic beverages and one dessert came to about $50.00. For the money, I would've preferred to go elsewhere. \n\nI will say I've stopped by the carry out counter for cheesecake to go before and absolutely LOVE the Lemon Raspberry and will always consider it a \"go-to option to-go\"!!!", "business_id": "2r8jGeuYvMkyP2ik_X-Bxw", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-08-18", "type": "review"}

What I didn't appreciate was what we got in exchange for his mistake. If I was in his position, knowing he was serving someone on his birthday, I would have at least comped the cheese cakes...I really didn't want to be that person that screams over their meal, but I thought for being so nice about everything, he would try to do some kind of a discount on our meal, and not some \"free soup\" that we didn't order in the first place.\n\nI am embarrassed because this was my boyfriend's birthday dinner.

Away from the busy main street and all the other loud obnoxious restaurants (people) Scottsdale is filled with.  \n\nThere is one woman in particular who works here who is an absolute rock star. She's younger and every time I'v interacted with her my experience has been amazing. She is kind, patient, and once even delivered my lunch order to my past work space near by. Its a local and family run business which i love to support! Although the man and older woman who work there haven't given me the best service when I've gone in. The woman talked on the phone the entire time she was helping me and I almost felt rushed by her to make a decision with my order making me feel like her phone call was much more important than a paying customer. Not so cool.\n\nAnything you order from Au Petit Four will be delicious. Whether is a beverage, a pastry, or a meal, you'll be happy. The prices are pretty steep for consistent lunch visits but every once in a while you can stop in here. Average spending amount on lunch will be around $15 after tip. One time i ordered a fruit tart and a small soy latte and I still spent $11. I thought that was pretty price BUT they make everything fresh and there is something to be said about that. \n\nThey do have a half sandwich/half salad lunch option for $7 but prepare to spend $9 or $10 after tip. Its a decent sized lunch for the most but men, you may need something bigger! The goat cheese panini is ridiculously good and their lattes are super yummy. I love that they add a fresh green (no iceberg!) salad with their panini's and that its a lemon olive oil dressing on the side. \n\nI adore the idea of supporting this place, so here's to the young woman who kills it in the service department! and to all the fresh delicious food!", "business_id": "wftoNIA0Q8nX-Da47psBCA", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-06-11", "type": "review"}

(You know, hungry and angry.) I couldn't decide where I wanted to eat and that meant my poor husband had to make a decision. Driving around downtown Scottsdale, my husband saw a new restaurant with bright colors and decided that would be the place. Unfortunately, there wasn't any parking out front, so he drove around back. After we got out of the car, he saw Au Petit Four and knowing that I love French food, decided to take me here. \n\nWe didn't look at the menu posted outside, just walked right in and were slightly confused. The space is rather large and sectioned off into two areas - a bakery on one side and a restaurant on the other. A man and a woman were behind a counter in the restaurant side and asked if we wanted to sit down and dine. My husband said yes and we were seated in the completely empty dining section. In the entire building, it was just the two employees and my husband and me. (Awkward...) There was plenty of seating and open space. The walls were brown brick with pictures of Paris scattering the walls willy-nilly and all tables were covered with plastic red and white checkered table cloths. I didn't particularly care for the table cloths because they stuck to my legs. \n\nAfter looking at the menu, I shook my head at my husband saying I wasn't sure what I wanted to eat. After much indecision (the poor waitress had to come back a few times) I finally decided on the prosciutto sandwich and my husband ordered a savory crepe. \n\nWhile waiting for our food, I went to the bathroom. It was down the long entrance hall, passing by several open doors to the kitchen/storage closets. The bathroom was in dire need of some cleaning and restocking (barely any soap and I used the last paper towel). \n\nWhen I got back to our table, it was only a few short minutes before my sandwich arrived and shortly after the crepe. My sandwich came with the option of salad, chips, or pasta salad. I went with salad. The salad was basically mixed greens and salad dressing on the side. (The salad dressing was good, but I expected tomatoes or something else on the salad.) The sandwich itself was really good. The prosciutto was thickly sliced with even larger slices/hunks of slightly melted brie. There was also pesto spread, tomatoes, and lettuce. Overall, I loved my sandwich. The bread was fresh and really hit the spot. \n\nMy husband said he liked he crepe, but he only ate half of it. I tried a bite and preferred my sandwich much more.\n\nOverall, the only good thing in the entire experience was my sandwich. The fact that there weren't any other diners during lunch, the bathroom was lacking, and the \"just ok\" crepe, I can't say that I will be back. There are plenty of other places to get fantastic crepes and fantastic sandwiches. \n\nPerhaps their desserts are amazing?", "business_id": "wftoNIA0Q8nX-Da47psBCA", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-08-16", "type": "review"}

You are groovy and 'green'.  You buy Jicama milkshakes and no-pesticide turnips.

First and foremost, I never leave here without restocking the $3 buck Chuck - Shiraz and Cab for mid-week meals when you don't feel like busting out the $15-$25 dollar vino.  The rest of the wine selection is surprisingly so-so and seems to have faltered in the last few years.  A once proud beer selection (and they allow you to mix-n-match sixers) has also decreased in quality, though they DO stock a nifty amount of Oak Creek Brews, which any proud Arizonan will stock up on without nary a glance at the Guinness or what have you.\n\nThe produce is not as expensive as the organic section of Safeway, so its a good place to stock up on a few extra 'healthier' (*cough*) veggies (my fiancee thinks so, anyway) at no extra charge.  Their meat selection is pretty decent for a store whose clientele are poster-children for the PETA Militia. \n\nTJ's is a nice place to supplement you grocery stash, but I just don't think I could do 100% of my shopping here -- and this from someone who eats-in very healthily about 95% of the week.  We have staples here that we almost always pick up -- that wine I mentioned before, edamame, veggies, a variety of fish, beer, and a couple of snacks like popcorn or cookies -- but that's primarily it for TJ's.

If you have a sensitivity to gluten, but have a hard time finding snack items that taste good, look no further. Even though I'm not celiac or gluten sensitive I find this treat hard to resist. \n3. Fat-Free Greek Yogurt. Obviously this won't be an option for my lactose-free and vegan friends, but with a little bit of Stevia you can have quite a healthy, weight-concious, and satisfying meal (It takes me half a container to fill me up [blush], you may need less). \n4. Dried Mango slices with Chili. For people not familiar with Central and South American treats, this is gonna sound weird...maybe even blasphemous, but you must sample at least once; I'm sure glad I did!

Their best one is the \"Lemon Chicken Salad Salad\" with a small bowl of chicken salad added to the box.  OH WAIT -- I just found out they discontinued it!  It was their best salad though...who doesnt have their thinking cap on over there?\n\nThey do have a public restroom which I believe the employees also use.  But dont expect it to be clean & sparkly like the rest of the store.  In fact when I used it, it was filthy, there were no paper towels, and someone had spit into the sink.  The employees prepare the boxed salads in the back area too, which causes some concern.  What help is it if the salads are organic if they are prepared by 20-somethings who must use that restroom?\n\nThey are open daily until 9, so don't be put off by the dark charcoal window film on the entry door. At night it looks as though they are closed from the parking lot.  They need something to keep the store cool in the summer at sunset, but it needs to be removable in the winter.\n\nWhole Foods is right next door now (used to be a Linens & Things), so that's good in case Trader Joe's is a little too limited for your shopping list you can hoof it over there without re-parking. If you STILL can't get everything on your list just go to Fry's across the street. \n\nBut good luck finding anyone on the road who will make crossing 20th Street convenient, easy or even SAFE. In fact, EXPECT the arrogant, unnecessarily-harried luxury SUV driver to spot your predicament and SPEED UP to try to intimidate and punish you for having the audacity to even potentially cause them to slow down in the least.  Once you make it alive you will find that their parking is bad too at Fry's. But the arrogant driving on 20th Street ends in the Fry's parking lot where the piss poor layout necessitates the greatest of community cooperation and patience -- PROVING that the display of arrogance on 20th Street is purposeful.  Why?!!  \n\nWhat I want to see is ONE BIG GROCERY STORE the size of Coscto that has everything all 3 stores would have IN it.

A couple nights ago, we stopped in at Hava Java for a caffeinated beverage before enjoying some gelato next door.  Being the afternoon of July 4th, the place was empty, save for the barista and a guy who was in there chatting her up.  I ordered a cafe au lait, he an iced coffee of some sort.  After asking me if I preferred skim milk or 2%, the barista handed me my cup of milk and foam and told me the coffee was self-serve and pointed me in the direction of the three coffee dispensers on the other side of the bar.  Really?  $3.75 for a cafe au lait and I have to pour the coffee myself?  I suppose that wouldn't have been entirely terrible if it had been any good.  It's amazing how much difference whole milk makes, but even beyond that, the coffee was weak and flavorless, and since it had to be pumped over the weak foam and milk, my drink tasted like little more than a drip coffee with milk.

The cashier was having a hard time getting the e-mail address from the customer in line in front of me, who had a VERY thick accent.  I couldn't understand the lady, either.  The cashier was very nice and professional about it, but did need to woman to repeat herself a few times.  The manager, who was standing nearby intervened and was very snotty with the cashier.  She said to the cashier, \"You need to wear your hearing aids whether you like it or not!\"  I was so appalled that she would say that in front of the woman's customers and coworkers.  Apparently this manager has never heard of the ADA!\n\nSo the cashier finishes helping the lady with the accent and it is my turn in line.  A coworker of hers gives her a piece of paper with a note from the manager.  I see her open the note, and I can see that it says, \"wear your hearing aids!\" and I see the cashier's face completely drop.  \n\nI checked out and left the store, got all the way back to my car, but didn't feel right not saying anything about this older woman being humiliated at work. So I walked back in and asked a cashier if I could have a phone number or e-mail address to contact the district manager or corporate. She said she would have to go to the back to get that information, and when she came back, she said, \"My manager said we can't give you that information.  She'll have to take your name and phone number and call you.\" I said, \"That's okay, I'll go online and get that information.  What is your store number?\" and of course I later found that they gave me the WRONG store number.\n\nAlso, all corporate businesses like this has a line customers can call about concerns.  This manager was seriously trying to cover her butt.\n\nSo I called another Williams Sonoma store in Phoenix, spoke to the manager there, and got the corporate telephone number.\n\nThere are other ways to discuss the cashier's disability with her, in private, and come to a solution.  The manager could find out what is going on and see if there are any ways to accommodate the employee, whether that be stocking or inventory where her difficulties with hearing won't be an issue.  She should NOT handle this by belittling the cashier in front of customers and coworkers.", "business_id": "31bXixwy2GNmRlhpl21reA", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-08-03", "type": "review"}

I live down the street so I figured I'd check it out, get breakfast and coffee while getting some work done on my laptop.  The breakfast sandwich (egg, ham, cheese, on their AMAZING multi-grain toast) is one of the best I've ever had!  Coffee is so-so, wasn't very strong, but tasted good.\n\nThe service is what I have an issue with.  Every time I went there (a total of 3 times) was planning on hanging out for a while.  On my second visit, as I was using my prepaid online deal thing, the Coffee Lady rang me up and I gave her cash for the small difference in price between my certificate and what I owed.  While she was getting change for the cash I gave her I slipped $3 into her tip jar (which she apparently didn't notice-but t doesn't matter anyway!)  and when she handed me 50 cents back, I put that into the tip jar too.  Awkward/uncomfortable/rude service moment next!  She scoffed and commented on how LOW my TIP was!!!  Are you kidding me???  1)  Just because you THINK someone is giving you a low tip, it is SOOOO RUDE to comment on it and try and make them feel bad about it  2) I really DID tip $3 on my coffee and breakfast sandwich and really just wanted to take my $3 right back out of the jar that second.  But I didn't.  I stayed, waited for my food, coffee and left later. 3)  If someone doesn't have extra money to tip you at a walk up coffee shop, it really isn't that big of a deal that you need to make them feel publicly shamed.  \n\nThe decor is cute and home-y inside, there are plenty of tables, very unreliable wifi, good breakfast sandwich, bleh coffee and crappy service.", "business_id": "e_kbfiEZ87L-ZryMZxvJkA", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-06-15", "type": "review"}

I completely understand, as I had a very similar experience! I went this morning to use a $10 certificate that I had purchased for $4 through a daily deal.  I usually love discovering new places this way because it gives you a chance to spend less money at a new place and decide if you like it or not. And I've made the assumption that owners are happy to see customers with a coupon because it means the marketing they chose worked and new people are coming in.  You would THINK they would want to make a good first impression. But not the Coffee Lady! I came in and ordered an egg salad sandwich. She went to her fridge to get some egg salad and said \"The tuna and chicken are a lot more filling if you want that, but we are famous for our egg salad.\"  I wasn't sure if she wanted me to change my order, or if she was just making conversation, but it seemed like an odd statement to me and I started doubting my order, but I didn't say anything.  The next thing I heard was \"Ah, this is kind of skimpy, let me add another egg.\"  And when I looked over, I could see that the container she had pulled out with egg salad was nearly empty, which clearly meant she was using yesterday's leftovers (as it was 8 in the morning when I came in), and I was a bit disappointed that the egg salad isn't made fresh daily. She literally peeled and added an egg right into what was left. I was just surprised at how nonchalant she was. Then I ordered a latte, since I knew I had to use up my $10. The latte was good (nothing out of the ordinary) and she was very friendly to me while making my drink. But then it came time to pay...and when I pulled out my coupon she said \"Oh, one of THOSE....great, I have to start my day off with one of those, huh?\" WOW! Talk about poor customer service. If you don't want to get new customers into your store at a discount, then why did you agree to the deal???  Her attitude was a total turn off...So then she added up my two items and said \"OK, you're just under $10 but you do have to pay tax, which is $.84 and that doesn't include a tip either, if you care.\"  (and this was as I was putting a cash tip in her jar, which she did NOT deserve, and I kicked myself for doing that, though CLEARLY she is hurting if she's that upset that I'm using a coupon, and VOICING that it doesn't include the tip). Then she had the gull to inquire if I lived nearby because she wanted me as a return customer. UNBELIEVABLE. I will NEVER go to this place again. Even if they HAD the best egg salad sandwiches or coffee in town, which they DON'T (and wouldn't you know, I ended up with an egg shell in my sandwich), I wouldn't go back.  \nI do not like to be negative and truly do have better things to do with my time, but I don't appreciate being treated badly or differently for trying a new place on a budget.", "business_id": "e_kbfiEZ87L-ZryMZxvJkA", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-07-22", "type": "review"}

I was the first (and thankfully the only person) to eat the cherries on Sunday.  The next day I was overcome with extreme food poisoning symptoms that lasted two days.  I could not do anything with my family.\nToday I took the cherries back to the store asking for a refund and explaining the reason.  The customer service person was about to refund my cherries at today's special price of $1.99 instead of the full price I paid.  I explained I didn't have the receipt because I used the bag with the receipt in it to use to pick up my dog's waste.  She kept telling me that I needed the receipt.  After telling her what I went through this week, she called her boss \"Bobby\".  \nBobby again went through the same requests, and I gave him the same responses.  I also told him I didn't expect to be buying tainted produce.  Finally he allowed the CS person to give me a gift card for the full price refund.\nNever once did Bobby or the CS person ask me if I was feeling better, or ask me if there was anything the can do for me.

Too bad their approach left me with mixed emotions. \n\nIf you've never been here, prepared to be overwhelmed. Seriously. The menu is so big, you don't know where to start. Go with a friend who's been and can give you pointers. My lunch friend made a couple recommendations. I ended up ordering the Mona Lisa. I was gonna nix the lemon capper mayo, but I figured a little wouldn't hurt. Whoa. Both slices of bread were slathered with this white stuff. Not bad taste. Just bad on the waist. \n\nThe sandwich was very, very good. Smoked salmon with sprouts on pumpernickel bread. It was very good, and I was very hungry. \n\nBut I just ordered one sandwich and it came to $7.57. That doesn't include anything else. No drink, except water (which was tap). I'm told they charge for everything here - every little extra you ask for. So, my cup of water my have cost me. Who knows. \n\nMy sandwich came with a \"free\" cookie, too. Come to think of it; maybe they charged me for that too!\n\nWould I be back? Well, yes. You buying? I mean, I love a good sandwich. I also love getting my money's worth. For $7.57, I would have hoped for a sandwich large enough for me to divide between lunch and din-din. No avail. I wolfed the entire thing down happily. Even better, it didn't make me bloated later, which I feared, since most foods tend to be heavy on the salt.\n\nThe interior is a bit messy in the sense that it's chaotic. This is more of your lunch rush place. Order. Grab. Eat. Run. \n\nWhen you place your order, they ask your name. Then they call your name when it's ready. I told the cashier how to spell my name, so when the order-yeller looked peeved that nobody was picking up the sack, I felt no remorse. \"Alisia\" is not how you spell my name. I let the cashier know this. He just shrugged. \n\nIn fact, that's one stellar way to sum up Sack's. Just shrug. Go on. Do it now. Shoulders up. Shoulders down. Yep.

I saw a 45+ year old woman carrying a metal lunchbox purse.  Need I say more?  Good people watching, but stay and eat while you gawk!\n\nOk, first of all, if you haven't tried the sangria, you really should.  It was light and very refreshing.  They have white sangria in the summer and red in the winter-ish months.\n\nWe started with the shrimp ceviche, which was a delight to the senses -- reminded me of the Moroccan gazpacho from Pita Jungle -- but just a CRAPLOAD more expensive -- $13.  It's served with hot sauce (which really made this a killer) and tortilla chips.  \n\nFor dinner Kelly and I split their pizza special -- it had heirloom tomatoes, fresh basil, fresh mozzerella with a balsmaic reduction.  Pretty much a caprezze salad on pizza.  It was HEAVENLY.  \n\nThe service was pretty solid -- just maybe not as attentive as I'd like.  \n\nI agree with some of the other posters that the parking sitch can be a little tenuous.  It's a tiny parking lot, with tons of people trying to get in, so be warned.\n\nThe grocery was absolutely charming, but rather overpriced.  If you love funky candles, this would be a great place to look -- tons of choices, but again, they're a little pricey.\n\nAll in all, this would be an ideal place to take friends or family that are visiting.

Because to get anywhere cool other than Downtown Chandler takes google-mapping and planning for drive-time and checking for construction on the 101, 60, 202, I rarely leave my 'hood. Sad. I know.\n\nI kept hearing about LGO from friends, coworkers and others who've apparently always dealt with driving everywhere and don't see this as a major pain in the ass. Poor souls just haven't lived where walking and public transportation are all you really need, and everything awesome is just a short walk or train ride away. My god, I miss NYC... but I digress.\n\nLGO.\n\nMy friend Monika and I planned to meet for breakfast at The Farm at South Mountain (yet another place to which I hadn't taken a \"road trip\" in these 3 years). When we got there, it was closed for summer. Oops. Guess we should've checked. Standing in the parking lot across the street, stomachs rumbling, beautiful morning... She says, \"Oh, how about La Grande Orange? I know you haven't been there, and you'll like it.\"\n\nMonika is a non-local local and knows everything about everywhere. She is one of the people who has most influenced my decisions on which places I've decided to go check out and she's always spot on with her recommendations. So LGO it was. She already had me out, and I had a full tank of gas. Let's drive. \n\nAnd drive we did (well, more than I like to, or am used to, but truly it was maybe 15-20 minutes from The Farm when all was said and done, on a Friday morning, after 8AM).\n\nWas it worth it? The food (at least this time around), not so much, but the overall experience, definitely.  The breakfast I ordered wasn't \"oh-my-god-the-best-egg-white-omelet-i've-ever-had\" but it was good. It was also the first egg white omelet I ever get that is not covered in oil, isn't huge, and isn't overstuffed. It was a normal portion, for a normal person, with an average appetite. It's called the Daybreaker: egg whites (they come like that, it isn't an extra $1.50 like it is at some places), turkey, and a tomato-avocado salsa. \n\nI tend to order healthier breakfasts, though I always fantasize about the pancakes or waffles. If I can share those with someone, then I'm game, but I know Monika and I both tend to sit on the \"healthy\" side of things, so I didn't even suggest it. She ordered eggs, toast and jam. Pretty simple breakfast, but again, very normal sized portions, nothing looked shiny with oil. \n\nI know you all were probably hoping I'd dish out rave reviews about something else, like the pastries in the case, or their breads... I promise  I'll return, and I will indulge in something other than egg whites, in the name of Yelping.  But truly, my fairly-priced Daybreaker omelet was good - not great. The tomato-avocado salsa truly gave it that \"mmm\".\n\nI also noticed on the sandwich menu that they have a Cuban sandwich, aptly named Cubano. Not so sure it'll taste authentic, but I'm not a Cuban food snob, and if some non-Cubans are giving it an honest try, even putting their own spin on it, I'll try it. And I'll probably love it (or at least like it a lot). You can't go wrong with a Cuban sandwich, especially one whose special spin is Gruyere cheese and spicy brown mustard. I'll let you know. Promise. \n\nThey have sushi (which I won't eat, ever, anywhere, any kind), salads, and some other breakfasts - egg dishes, yogurt/granola, oatmeal, burrito, etc. Nothing that really calls to me. So I'll likely just return for the Cuban sandwich and pastries.\n\nIt wasn't really the food that was good about this place. More than the food, I just loved the environment. Yes, there were people having conversations on a phone or with another person. People on laptops. Some tourists. So what? Live and let live, you know? \n\nWe spent 15 minutes eating and then 2 hours perusing the shop/market. They've got some unusual items, gourmet/specialty candy, ingredients, mixes and other foods, some really neat gifts for people and pets and some awesome art. Not sure how often or what kind of variety they carry. When I went they had these really interesting vases, one-of-a-kind, with things written on them. They were funny, or twisted (or both), and totally thought-provoking. The artist is Kaelyn Loes. I may pick up one or two for some good friends who I know appreciate \"word art.\"\n\nAs for parking - it sucks, but we got lucky. The parking lot is across the street and tiny, and I can see this being a problem. In fact, others' reviews mention that too. I read somewhere that the designer for LGO did this on purpose to encourage foot traffic and make this place a \"community\" gathering spot for the area locals, so I appreciate the concept. and you won't find me bitching about the parking situation. \n\nFinal word? If you live in the valley, go at least once. It's not like any of the boring, personality-lacking chain places at every strip mall. A diversion from the predictable crap on every corner in suburbia.", "business_id": "R8VwdLyvsp9iybNqRvm94g", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-06-26", "type": "review"}

With that said, I think we may have an ugly baby here. Don't get me wrong, there are some redeeming factors here, but for the most part I think that there might be a bit more hype than anything going on these days at La Grande.\n\nI went here for lunch today not recalling that 50% of their menu is not available 100% of the time and that kind of bummed me out because that means no pizza until 4 pm during the week unless it is Friday or Saturday and no burgers unless it is Friday or Saturday.  Either way, 11:15 am on Wednesday means I have a full choice of sandwiches, pastries, salads, and breakfast choices.  Many will say that those choices should be more than enough to choose from if I am willingly going to dine here.  Well...it wasn't my day to pick the lunch spot.  A work colleague actually picked it which is amusing due to my second gripe: between the loud music, gabbing hikers, lunching ladies on their way to or from the Biltmore or Fashion Square, the place doesn't necessarily lend itself to normal conversation.  That is assuming there is a place for everyone to sit. Just because you are alone, with your latte and laptop doesn't mean that you need to take up an entire 4 top to yourself.  The place itself and the atmosphere just doesn't feel as \"phoenix\" as I recall when I first went. Something has changed. I feel like all of the LA transplants come here to recharge and then go off again to do their thing. It only made me laugh harder when I was leaving the restaurant and noticed the sign on the door that read \"LGO now open in Santa Monica.\" Yahtzee! That is exactly where I thought I was anyways during lunch so I guess it makes sense that they opened another one out there.  I also think that the flow can be improved from finding parking, to the ordering, to the waiting at the end of the counter for your food, to finding a seat.  I would think for all the hassle I was going to get served a plate of food that was made from the water of the fountain of youth or at least a hint at the secret of life.  But alas my $8.00 tuna salad sandwich only came with a couple of pickles and a watermelon wedge.\n\nWhile I will say one of the redeeming is the food (although an $8.00 sandwich has to be pretty damn fantastic to be $8.00). My tuna salad on 9 grain was fresh, not too much mayo or other junk in it.. It is served with tomato, cucumber, apple and greens. I will be honest, the tuna is stacked high, but the bread is overly toasted and I hardly tasted the apple. But I repeat, the tuna salad itself was pretty good.\n\nI know when I first tried La Grande I liked it a lot. I thought the breakfast was great and I truly enjoyed the scene there. These days it just seems like it has lost a bit of it's luster for me. I am sure I will be back in the future and will give it another chance. It will probably be when I can get dropped off, have called in my order ahead of time and it is between the hours of 4 and 5 pm on a Friday so I can freely order from the entire menu.", "business_id": "R8VwdLyvsp9iybNqRvm94g", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-08-12", "type": "review"}

I have been there hundreds of times previously.  I have had many wonderful experiences previously and have referred dozens of friends to LGO, Chelsea's Kitchen, Postino, etc.  \n\nSo, it's this past Sunday morning and I run in real quick for a few breakfast items, those being English muffins and a regular iced mocha latte.  The place was packed as usual but seemed more so because of far too much merchandise and no where for people to wait or even stand.  The service was friendly.  In case you haven't tried the English muffins, they come in a 5 pack and they are very tasty-a must have and great toasted.  \n\nMy heart burn on this visit begins at the register.  Two two items together totaled $18.02.  I was shocked so I asked the girl at the coffee bar register if she rang it in right and she assured me she did. She was very nice about it but OMG WTF?  I paid and came home.  The mocha was way too sweet and not even comparable to Starbuck's(which I do not like for the record).  So, essentially, I paid $18.02 for a pack of English muffins.

My favorite thing on their sandwich menu is in fact the Cubano - their interpretation of the traditional pressed Cuban sandwich (no pork, but still \"muy delicioso!\"). \n\nI've also had their salted chocolate chip cookies, and tasted the chocolate peanut butter cheesecake (I think both are from Tammy Coe, next door).

The muffins from Tammy Coe are to die for. I always stop in the Grocery to grab bread or cheese for nice dinners or even a picnic lunch. \nStopping by after work for pizza and gelato has also become a bi-monthly occurance in our house.

Bringing my laptop as my date, I took advantage of their free Wi-Fi service to create some clever rap review, but hit a road block. NOTHING rhymes with \"orange!\" Sure, I could've came up with something more clever, but I found myself easily distracted with this new tidbit and had to share it! :)\n\nOkay, okay...now back to LGO. I grabbed a fresh smoked salmon chopped salad ($8.25), which had bits of asparagus, sunflower seeds, couscous, tomatoes, craisens, and a side of champagne vinegerette dressing on a bed of romaine lettuce. Not being a fan of the dressing, I was more impressed with the generous amount of fresh smoked salmon, which was delivered at the right temperature mixed with the fun texture of couscous. Adding a bottle of water, it was the perfect and delicate lunch to balance the heavy, 98 degree weather. The portions at LGO don't look large, but they always fill me up. Maybe it has to do with the backdrop of super attractive, earthy, trendy looking people in sunglasses, chic capris, yoga wear, and sandals that keep my appetite in check? Either way, LGO is a great place to grab breakfast, lunch, or dinner with their casual menu. I'm slowly becoming a fan of their pizza as I'm getting use to the taste of sourdough crust, but love, love, love their array of freshly baked pastries, muffins, cookies, cakes, etc. Many slices of heaven await my eager and grubby hands as I fog up the glass case, while admiring their perfection. The price points are a tad high, but considering they use fresh ingredients and bake in-house, it's quite reasonable. When the weather is cooler, the patio is a great place to seat and catch up with friends. A lot of bikes are usually parked along the brick wall, adding a bit more flair and color to the place. The music is always on point with an eclectic mix of Jay-Z, Kings of Leon, indie pop, or electro-often making me want to bottle pop from their large selections of wine. Not only do they carry an array of vino from the floor to the ceiling, they also have a classic candy isle with modern day pricing, pet and kiddy goods and treats, a coffee bar (not a fan of it personally) and lots of other unique trinkets and gift items to browse through while you wait to order.\n\nWhich now brings me to the only 2 things I dislike about LGO: The California-like traffic in their parking lot and grocery store/restaurant/pizzeria/coffee bar and...that nasty coffee. If you come during rush hour, you should expect to fight for a parking spot or be cautious of someone backing out (hopefully, not into you), and those randoms (don't assume they're  all Asian :P) driving the wrong way. If you survive that, you'll be entering into a mess of people browsing up at the menu, with those that are annoyed because they know what they want, with the \"regulars\" who are actually in \"line\" to order, to the people frozen in place looking at the pastries, in-between the \"pick up\" area where people are actually picking up their orders, standing next to those who are still waiting to pick up their order, while getting in the way of the people in line at the coffee bar who just want to order their damn coffee and OJ, and the rest are now just trying to grab their silverware and napkins to eat. Just remember to breath...and breath. Kundalini. Some how, some way, you do end up with a seat somewhere and actually enjoying your meal. Otherwise, come in at an off beat time where the place is yours for the taking :) As for their coffee...have ordered it 3 different times and still hate it. They rank 2nd to Pita Jungle when it comes to the worse coffee I've ever ordered, which is too bad since the open air ambiance would perfectly compliment a great cup of Joe.", "business_id": "R8VwdLyvsp9iybNqRvm94g", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-06-11", "type": "review"}

I don't really see the appeal of coming here on your lunch hour squeezed in with everyone else. \n\nI chose a Caesar salad from the case as I was in line.

I don't even mind that there is a parking issue most of the time, I mean how can you blame them for that? It's in a great neighbosrhood and I think they have made the most of the parking space they have - I've never really viewed the popularity of this place as a negative.  \n\nTwo: For such a busy place, I think they do a great job with customer service.  Because of the nature of the restaurant (ordering at a counter, picking up your food when they call your name) you don't get a lot of chances for one-on-one rapport building and encounters with the staff are pretty brief, but always pleasant.  I love that it's efficient and on the rare occasions I already know what I want to order the staff behind the register can somehow quickly sense my determination and call me to the front.  If, like yesterday , I want to peruse the menu, there are usually girls walking through the line handing out menus so you don't have to stare up at the chalk board.  I originally grabbed a salad out of the cold case and brought it up to the register. I asked if I could have it without cheese and extra beets, they made me a fresh to-go salad in no time and were super friendly about my requests.  \n\nThree: Every single thing I've had here has been delicious.  I try to get different things every once in a while and I've never been disappointed! Yesterday I had the Sonoma chop salad which is amazing and also grabbed a thai chicken salad for a friend and it's my new favorite thing.  \n\nI hope people will continue to patronize this beautiful little eatery that we are so lucky to have in Arcadia.  If you are new to LGO, keep an open mind and I think you will find that the great things about it absolutely outweigh the \"bad.\"", "business_id": "R8VwdLyvsp9iybNqRvm94g", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-07-14", "type": "review"}

Ive lived in Arcadia for years and have gotten a spot out front once. The valets are great but if you're just running in for 5 mins it adds another ten to get your car back. \nWhat frustrates me more than anything is there lobby/order pickup area. First they have crammed so many shelves full of rare peanut butters, custom greeting cards, children's educational toys, and hand made wine bottle holders that there is literally one small area for everyone to make an elementary school style line weaving through all this junk. Second, after ordering your $10 sandwich you are forced to wait in a crush of people all clamoring for their food. On more than one occasion my food has been taken by a hungry soccer mom or avid bicyclist in spandex. Then off to the cafeteria style seating to find a table. \nMy problem is if your spending over $10 for their food items then they should give you a number to take to your table so its delivered, not fight cougars in a game of life and death for your meal. \nI'm over it.", "business_id": "R8VwdLyvsp9iybNqRvm94g", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-07-29", "type": "review"}

I have never ever ever had a bad meal here. They have everything that you can ever imagine. I mean if I am feeling for an omelet, I can get one of the many that they serve all day- mmhmm my breakfast cravings can always be fulfilled. If breakfast foods aren't your thing, there are plenty of salads, sandwiches, pizzas and daily specialties. (It's always so hard to choose!) I think the best selection is on the weekends but you are going to have to risk the crowds. \n \nNormally I get one of their salads, but this time I got a gluten free pizza. (their new specialty) Um yummy!! I want to make it clear how hard it is to have delicious gluten free pizza. Normally GF pizza is hard and dry- and bland uck!. It was ooey gooey goodness with more of a cracker thin crust- fine by me, I have another yummy pizza place on my list! I was literally dancing in my seat because I had found another place place to go out to.  (My mother finds it quite funny when I do my \"Happy Dance\")\n\nTry Tammie Coe's cupcakes and cakes, I mean yes they are expensive but if you want a celebration in your mouth fork over the 3 bucks, it will be well worth it. If you are a true friend buy your comrade a birthday cake here, they will be indebted to you forever. \n\nYou may wonder, why did this girl give only three stars? She must be crazy and have outrageous expectations. (I really don't I promise) I mean if I was only rating the food, sure I would give it five out of five stars in a heartbeat. But seriously, there is NO parking, I mean none at all. It is beyond frustrating to drive a bit to come to this delectable haven only to find yourself without a parking spot. Once in a while there is valet, but I don't rely on it because I have been there a couple of times and have to search for a good twenty minutes to get a smig of a spot. (I sometimes have to get creative) And the confusion continues when you walk inside. Yes the grocery is cute but it's a traffic jam just to order. I always seem to find myself running into the cute little nick nacks or into another customer. I like my space and always feel crammed when ordering. And I NEVER go during peak hours, if you do you will never find a seat. I will have to be sneaky and search around the dining room eyeing who may be done with their meal and nonchalantly wait for the table. It's like a game, but it seems that I can never win at.\n\nOkay yelpers, don't cross this place off your list, it really is delicious and I always have an enjoyable time.

It was our first time and even though parking was difficult I had really high hopes going in. I read up on the reviews from my fellow yelpers out there--and was ready for the challenges that eating here brings. Even though I knew about the long lines and needing to find a table first--I still found it difficult to navigate through this place! \n\nOnce we got to the counter and we ordered, I was shocked that our bill was over $25. I had the oatmeal with an English muffin and he had the Daybreaker--egg white omelet--we each had OJ and that was it! I asked for a little side of cream and some butter for my oatmeal and it didn't come with our meal. When my husband politely asked for it--the gal at the counter showed little in the way of customer service skills and pretty much treated him as if she didn't have time to deal with his request--a common denominator from other yelpers as well. \n\nMy oatmeal was decent (although I've had better at Taylor's Cafe--costing about $2 less, much bigger portion and it comes with fresh blueberries, strawberries, banana's as well as cream, butter and brown sugar! :-). My husband's omelet was completely tastless--it was an egg white omelet with smoked turkey breast with avocado and tomato salsa. The tomato's were nice but the omelet had no flavor except for the salt from the turkey. If you're expecting cheese in your omelet--be sure to ask to have some added! It contains exactly what the ingredients lsited on the menu reads--no more, no less. The smoked turkey is your average sliced sandwich turkey meat on top of the egg white rolled up with the tomato's and scant avocado pieces tossed on top. \n\nI'm so disappointed--maybe we just ordered the wrong things? When looking around we did see some delicious looking sandwiches and it did seem that people were enjoying their food, we were just wishing that we were enjoying ours as well. We finished quick and got outta there. \n\nWe'll probably give it one more shot some time down the road. We had the same reaction when we ate lunch at Chelsea's about 6 months ago. Not much in the way of portion for the price you pay. Knowing they're owned by the same company--it sure explains that taste and atmosphere didn't make up for the sticker shock.", "business_id": "R8VwdLyvsp9iybNqRvm94g", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-08-15", "type": "review"}

Not only do they serve up some pretty incredible eats, but also the atmosphere and energy are infectious. I always leave feeling like I did more than have a meal: I leave feeling like I had an experience. \n\nFor a place that sees as much foot traffic as LGO, and for as little space as they have in the market/counter area, they do a great job of controlling the line and making it so you don't wait too long to order up. I was there during that odd hour in the morning when it feels like you may have missed out on prime breakfast time, but it's too early to order lunch. After going back and forth a bit, breakfast won out, and I got a Venice Beach Burrito with a side of potatoes and a 'Sunrise' (their tangy blend of grapefruit juice and pomegranate). Food came out fast, and I was meeting a friend who had already snagged a table: Two bonuses in my book.\n\nEverything tasted great, but I've never been to LGO and thought otherwise. The VBB  with tofu chorizo, mushrooms, corn, spinach, potato, egg whites & charred tomato salsa rolled in a wheat tortilla packs a flavorful punch, but didn't leave me feeling so full that I couldn't go back up and get a cookie later! Breakfast was SO good in fact, that on my way out I decided to get lunch too, and grabbed their stacked turkey sandwich to take back to the office. Knowing that I'd be eating it a bit later, I asked for it dry, and asked them to hold the bread and wrap up my turkey in that same tortilla that my breakfast came in. They are always open to substitutions, and never give me a hard time when I start swapping things around.\n\nEven more enjoyable than the food is the diverse and eclectic crowd. LGO has become a gathering spot for business-folk hosting working lunches, moms taking a break from the kids and groups of friends reconnecting.

Ladies and gentleman: the perfect amount of cheese, avocados, proscuitto, fresh basil, and lemon zest.

Didn't get a chance to meander through the shop, but honestly, I wasn't there to shop. \n\nWe parked in the back and basically walked through the kitchen (which is in the shop) and the shop to get to the pizza place. There are far too many entrances. We had to walk through 3 doors, and then walk to the other end of the restaurant, just so the hostess could see us, and walk us back the way we came to seat us at a table. Kind of felt like I was walking in circles. Not so good if you go hungry. But all that can be overlooked because the food is fantastic!\n\nWe got the avocado pizza and added prosciutto and spicy chilies. Now, let me preface this with the fact that I'm not really a pizza person, unless i make it myself. Generally the crust is just blah and there's too much sauce. I am now a LGO pizza person! the pizza was just big enough for the two of us, the crust was thin, hand-made and perfect. The toppings were fresh, and you could tell. I didn't have a problem with the topping ratio, either. Usually I find that there's too much of one thing, not enough of another, but this was not the case. Avocado, 4 cheeses, prosciutto, tomatoes, spinach and chillies. No red sauce. Right off the bat, that made me happy. The flavours were perfect, the crust was perfect, it was pretty much a perfect pizza. \n\nOne issue I had with the meal: no refills on sodas. They give you a can, a short glass and 2 (yes, really) ice cubes. Kind of a let down. Stick with iced tea, or remember to ask for a large glass with ice. \n\nDessert. it was my birthday dinner, so of course dessert was a must. Our friends (who got the same pizza as we did, sans chillies) got the million layer red velvet cake with cream cheese frosting. I got what they call the Old Timer, which is essentially a homemade Hostess cupcake.... on crack! I'm a fan of red velvet cake, but i'm super picky about it. This was moist and perfectly done, and the frosting was finger-licking good. My Old Timer was just ridiculous. Cream filled devils food cake with chocolate ganache all around the outside. The cake was perfect; moist but not mushy, the ganache was rich but not so rich you couldn't eat it and the cream was fresh. \n\nI can't wait to go back for a date night and try an appetiser, maybe a different pizza and a different dessert. I'd love to go for brunch, try a pastry, mosey around the store...", "business_id": "R8VwdLyvsp9iybNqRvm94g", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-07-22", "type": "review"}

Although, this well NEVER deter me from going here. Even if its just to grab a quick coffee.\n\nOk.. now that I really sit and think about it, that is the only Con to this delightful establishment. Walking through the shop you can find the most darling and useful items including: funny/witty random items, coffee mugs, to go cups for iced drinks (a MUST in AZ), t-shirts, books, art, calendars, magazines, etc... You can also purchase cold beverages outside of the restaurant or coffee bar and they also have a huge selection of wine for a small store. I purchased a darling La Grande Orange to-go coffee mug and if an art piece my boyfriend loves is still there when I arrive next friday.. I will be getting that for him.\n\nThe coffee bar smells amazing and even though I have only had one  iced toddy (AZ friends, i'm catching on ;))  from them, I am in love. The barista was super knowledgable and friendly and guess what ? She managed to not screw up something as simply as an iced beverage. I also purchased a bag of their Organic Ethiopian coffee. It is sitting in the apartment in AZ just waiting for me to come back! They bake all sorts of delicious treats daily and they have a food menu outside of the restaurant. They offer lots of quick fast goodies to take on the go as well as breakfast options for all of us loungey-coffee/brunch/patio-with-our-laptops people. ME. \n\nWhile I was there I dined in the restaurant and our experience was great. We ordered cocktails while we waited for our table and they were fresh and delicious! So nice to have a real drink outside of UT. We were seated quickly and our server was very helpful, friendly but also very laid back which I love. We ordered the  grilled artichoke which was of course amazing, a vegetable pizza and another round of drinks. As we finished up our dinner we walked around the shop one more time to take in all the amazing random stuff they sell all while a great AZ storm was starting to brew outside. \n\nThis place is amazing.

LGO has great salads and sandwiches and I like their friday night free wine tastings. My favorite salad is the kale salad (however I have noticed the amount of actual kale over the last several months has gotten smaller) but very fresh, delicious and nutritious. Their Ruben is really good too! :-) Also, if your in for a sweet treat, their sugar cookies are fabulosity, really, just take my word for it!\nOn to the actual ambiance and um, I guess you can call it customer service. Very hipster/ California vibe (which is to be expected since the original started in CA). As for the people that work there... I must say if you are going somewhere to get stellar service or to get a warm hearted hello or welcome, or really even be treated like a human, 95% chance that will NOT happen at LGO. I go there a lot and have a lot of friends that do and we all agree on one thing thing, great food but nasty, mean, bitchy employees that treat you as though you are an inconvenience for even being there. I have actually turned around and left before, and have avoided going there because I didn't feel like being treated as a 12th class citizen. If they could fix that issue, it would make the whole experience much more enjoyable. But hey,  you can always call ahead and get it to go.\nAll in all though, good place :-)", "business_id": "R8VwdLyvsp9iybNqRvm94g", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-06-15", "type": "review"}

It is going to be LOUD and CROWDED and you are going to have to STAND and WAIT for a while. AKA- don't go here when you're hungover or bring a hungover individual because they will NOT enjoy it (too much hustle and bustle when you're feeling weak/sick). It reminds me of some cafes/groceries I've been to in Europe which I think makes me like it even more. All of the breakfast items are delicious. The commuter sandwich is yummy. I like it with avocado, lox, or turkey, it's good no matter which way you get it because of their amazing English muffins. The day breaker and eggs to order are other faves of mine. I like to snag a picnic table outside and eat out there. Their iced tea is also really good and they serve it with an orange slice instead of a lemon slice.. YUM.

Last weekend we were there and people paying for their meals hover directly over the muffins and croissants, talking over them and brushing up against them.

Great event.  I was very happy that I got the chance to have b'fast with 2 yelpers I have not seen in a while, Joan G and Meagan G - so nice to see these ladies!     I had the egg-white omelet.  That was fantastically delicious.  A lot of people love their English muffins too and they sell them by the half-dz.\n\nSo, I am finally, after 4 years of shopping here, writing a review of LGO.  \n\nI love coming here.  Everything about this shop screams hipster and I like hipster stuff too.   I love the lunch salads.  Their salads are often creative and delicious with fresh local ingredients.  Just grab a salad from the cooler in front of the main counter.  \n\nI love the pizza.  IN fact, the pizza here is some of the best in the valley to me.  The star of their pizza, to me, is the delicious crust!  the crust of their pizza has an appropriate balance of crisp and chewiness.  I have also enjoyed some of their cookies.  Certainly the last Yelper Cookie recipe in July 2013  was the best cookie I've had from their Bake Shop.\n\nI know they sell wine and a bunch of other stuff.  I always feel like I'm running into stuff on displays for sale in there; but to be honest, I've never paid that stuff any attention.  I don't know what is on those displays in that store.  When I was in there today, I noticed a children's book on one of the shelves and remembered thinking, odd.  But maybe people buy them and read those books whilst they eat lunch. (?).  \n\nThe parking situation at this corner of Campbell and 40th street is typical of most central phoenix eateries - frustrating, limited, best-to-valet - to name a few adjectives.  Which is why I normally get what I want from LGO to go.  They have convenient \"to-go\" parking spaces right in front that are almost always vacant.  I park, run in , grab what I need and come right back out.    \n\nUntil this morning, LGO certainly had a round-up-able-to 5 star rating in my book.. I had to knock them a star for the following TWO  reasons: \n\n#1 this place doesn't lend itself to large groups at all if you come for lunch or breakfast.  No reservations.  Just dispatch your buddies to hold seats with cell phones, napkins and whatever else you can use as place holders.  \n\nRCV Alert:  \n#2 They got rid of or lost the Tammie Coe Cake's  Red Velvet Cupcakes.   I came to know TCC's RVC when I stopped in to have lunch at LGO once and that's where my love of TCC's RVC originated.  When I stopped in some time ago and saw the RVC cupcapes in the display.  I instantly knew something ewas off/wrong.  It didn't look like my beloved TCC RVC cupcake.  I inquired about the cupcake and why it looked different.  I discovered that TCC's was no longer being sold there, a person working at the counter told me LGO's RVC was just as good as TCC's.  Uhm, Houston, we have a problem, that sales person MUST have fallen and bumped her head!  I don't think so.  I've tried the RVC made by LGO's bake shop 3 times to see if it came close, the cake itself is not as good as TCC's.  The cake itself lacks the appropriate flavor.  The taste is off..  The cake is moist enough, and the texture is just right.  but the lack of enough flavor is where they loose the battle.  The cream cheese frosting is perfectly done.  If their cake's taste popped more, they'd be in a position to take on my #1 RVC in PHX.  Certainly a contender in my Top 5 favorite RVC's in Phoenix.  .", "business_id": "R8VwdLyvsp9iybNqRvm94g", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-08-17", "type": "review"}

Add bacon, egg and cheese to that and it is even better. Now here comes that big but I was talking about. They do not to breakfast service well here. It fact they don't do it at all. There is no service at breakfast. You can order breakfast sandwiches and stuff but then you have to go next door, stake out a table, go get your order when it is ready, then get your own silverware and water and coffee. After you are done they want you to bus your own dishes. The funny thing was that some people weren't picking up there food so someone would bring it over and track them down it give it to them. Hmmmm that sounds like maybe something they should do all the time. Probably a crazy idea.\nSo I will come back for more baked goods and to try the pizza but I don't think I will stop for breakfast again.

The problems? Many!  We went there again on Sunday morning, November 24th.  The girl taking our order didn't even know what a basted egg was, so I had to order over-medium eggs. La Grande thinks it's cool to have their music blasting so loud you can't communicate with another person.  The bigger problem- counter workers yell out your name when the order is ready, but you can't hear your name being called because the music is so loud.... then they let your hot food sit on a counter with no heat lamps making zero attempt to find the customer.  If La Grande is going to keep the current system in place, which does not work (cold food and too-loud music), they will need to install an intercom speaker which cuts off the music when a customer's order is ready for pickup, so customers can hear their name being called.  By the time I found our food it was completely cold.  (btw, the food is never more than warm here). Upon complaining, a young woman offered to place the eggs, bacon & English muffins in the oven lol.  I refused & asked them to prepare the meals again.  Even after remaking our order, the over-medium eggs had runny whites, the scrambled eggs luke-warm at best & the English muffins were barely toasted (as usual) and barely hot enough to make butter melt.  The latte was plenty acceptable.  I openly told the counter worker, I've been coming to La Grande for many years, but have mostly stopped the past two years because the music is always ridiculously loud and the food is always cold. I expressed my disappointment in spending $30 for breakfast (which I have to pick up at a counter) and never being able to get a hot plate of food. Cold eggs, cold English muffins...YUKK!  I frequent their other restaurant Chelsea's, which does not appear to have any of these problems.  Additionally, what has happened to the \"Grocery Store\" Part of La Grande Orange Grocery???? Most of the cool metal racks of gourmet food items have been replaced with garbage trinkets such as candles and t-shirts!!!  On top of that, the pastry case has gone way down hill since the exit of Tammy Coe's baked goods.  On this trip in, we wanted something from the pastry case, but saw nothing that even looked appealing, so we purchased nothing from the case!!!  The display tables offering merchandise are far too close to the ordering and food pick-up areas, creating an environment where the customers can barely move past each other within the establishment.  Recommendation- delete 20% of the trinket selling tables in favor of respecting your customers need to walk through the place!  This place has some problems that have been going on a very long time (cold food and too-loud music top the list of issues), plus many new problems.  The owner needs to revisit the concept of \"Restaurants 101\".... Hot food and doing things which make sense,,,, and remember- just because profits are likely big RIGHT NOW does not mean you don't have problems!", "business_id": "R8VwdLyvsp9iybNqRvm94g", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-07-23", "type": "review"}

BIG family b-day party), I wanted to share my absolute delight for Cole Turner, and his bake team at LGO.\n\nAs we are HUGE fans of LGOs Key Lime pie, we had hoped that they would be able to craft a gender reveal pie for us to celebrate our pregnancy. However, we weren't exactly sure what we wanted or how to make our random ideas work. Cole listened to our suggestions, and ultimately created a beautiful marriage of what he knew would be successful, from a Pastry Chef's perspective, with what we wanted our guests to experience. His ability to relate to how special we wanted this moment to be and find any way to make it work, was outstanding. When we cut into the pie, it was exactly as he described it would be, it was delicious, and it was the centerpiece to a wonderful holiday celebration.\n\nWhen it came time for the baby shower, we knew exactly who to call. This time around, I gave Cole extremely short notice, and asked for dozens of miniature versions of their classic pastries. Assuming that we would be out of luck, he and his team found a way to make it work. Cole appreciated having our repeat business, and ultimately thanked us for our loyalty to LGO. But remember, we were the one's giving him the smallest of windows from which to work. I couldn't believe his dedication to the customer and their ultimate satisfaction. Once again, the desserts were 100% on point and the talk of the party. In fact, they pretty much stole the show. \n\nAs months pass between each request for their delicious baked goods, Cole is still my #1 contact for any desserts that I need catered. And each time I contact him, he remembers my name, asks about how my family is doing, and makes me feel valued. Customer service is the end-all-be-all in my book, and the bake team at LGO, led by Cole Turner gets my highest recommendation.

I have no clue whether or not they ever sent anyone to clean the bathroom, but I sure hope so!\n\nOn my last trip there, some guy was walking around the parking lot begging for spare change so he could eat. I gave him the three quarters I had in my middle console. He thanked me, walked away and returned to my car window a few seconds later.

I thanked him and immediately thought about my guardian angel.

When I'm not eating out, I'm looking up a recipe on Epicurious, Chow or Food.com for a recipe that pushes my boundaries as cook. Lately, I've been working to perfect my ability to braise pork and beef. It is therefore very important to me to find the ingredients I want, since I'm working to pin down my techniques before I feel more comfortable experimenting with ingredients and flavors.\n\nThis particular Fry's is my go-to grocery store.  I shop here for my daily necessities and usually start here when I'm looking to cook something up from a recipe. Unfortunately, as I start to diversify my cooking ability, it has become more and more difficult to find what I need. I understand that Fry's isn't really the spot for finding unique grocery items like baby artichokes, but it definitely has become frustrating that I end up spending 30 minutes looking around for what I need without someone in sight to assist, only to give up or find out that it is not stocked. It's a bit too after-the-fact for them to ask upon checkout, \"Did you find everything alright?\"\n\nIn the recent past, I've started my shopping at Fry's and then worked my way over to other grocery stores for the other items. I've shopped for my other items at Sprouts, Whole Foods and AJ's. If cooking something extravagant, I may need to shop exclusively at one of those instead of splitting my time between Fry's and one of the others. \n\nSelection aside, you really cannot beat Fry's on price for a lot of their standard grocery items, especially meat and produce. Walmart and Target sometimes offers cheaper prices for canned, bottled and boxed products. I'm not a huge consumer of those, so I'll continue shopping at Fry's for my day-to-day items.", "business_id": "5WQhLNpG6xZryVCla4gMRA", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-07-30", "type": "review"}

It was recently remodeled and the floors, shelves and produce are all clean and in working order.  Ive never been in the bathroom tho, so I cant speak for that.  It seems as if people like David W. haven't even been here.  Yes, there is a Starbucks inside this location.  There is actually a fairly nice lounge area by it too.  Free Wifi too.  Wells Fargo has a full branch at this location as well.  \n\nI would describe the clientele as 'gritty'.  Yes, every once in a while you will be asked for change in the parking lot.  I've been asked for change in many cities and many stores.  Some have been in extremely nice areas.   Never once have I held it against the business or city I am in.  What a weird reason to give less stars.  I would rather hear your experience about the goods you purchased, not a tirade about drifters in the parking lot.  Nobody cares about your minor inconvenience of saying 'no' to another human being. \n\nI have for the most part had great service here.  I get in and out very quickly.  There are usually a lot of lines open and there are 6 self checkout stations.  \n\nOk, now for the negatives.  We have had a few issues with some produce we purchased here.  We have purchased a couple bad onions.  I hope Frys reads this and gets a new onion supplier.  Sometimes produce items are out of stock.  This is a very busy Frys and seems to churn thru their product fairly quickly. There is a good amount of produce they do not stock.  Maui onions and crimini mushrooms come to mind.

So, I have no information on the shop or the service, only the taste.  \nAnd let me tell you, it is definitely NOT worth making the trip to the bakery.  I received four samples, White Chocolate, Strawberry Rum, Raspberry, and Chocolate.  The cake was light and fluffy, but honestly resembled the kind of cake layers that you get from a grocery store.  You know, unnaturally light and fluffy.  (If you've ever made a cake from scratch, they are more dense than that from a box.)  There is no way this cake was made with fresh ingredients.  But, this doesn't matter to everyone, and the taste of the actual cake was not that bad.  Also, there are some decent boxed cake brands out there.  As for fillings, there seemed to be a layer of pudding, (vanilla and chocolate, depending on which cake you try) and it, too tasted like it came out of a box or a can.  My guess would be from a large tin can, which certainly has it's place on a Chinese food buffet, but not on a supposed gourmet cake.  In addition to the pudding, there was the flavor of choice for the cake.  One was a layer of strawberry jam, which said it was strawberry rum, but I couldn't taste the rum at all.  The raspberry was also a jam and pudding combination.  The chocolate was the least offensive of the cakes (a majority vote by the two friends I had with me) and the worst was the white chocolate, which my friend's 6 year old son tasted and then made the most hilarious face before asking if he had to eat anymore.  (And we're not talking about a picky kid here.  He routinely eats burritos from Chipotle with spicy barbacoa and guacamole, which is not something you'll see a picky eater do.)  To top it all off, no pun intended, the frosting was a non-dairy whipped cream.  Are you kidding me?  Spring the extra $1/gallon for the real stuff!  You've clearly skimped on the rest of your ingredients, so how about you go nuts on this part.   \nIn case there was any doubt left in your mind, no, I did not decide to order cake from Fleur De Lis.  If I wanted a grocery store cake, I'd go to a grocery store and probably pay a hell of a lot less.  Sadly, they have quite a few pictures on their site, which means lots of suckers have shopped here.  It is \"unforgettable\" for sure.  I will definitely remember not to recommend it to anyone.

Our cake has 4 tiers, which means we can have up to 4 flavors, and I also had a specific cake design which was at no extra charge (I'll post a pic after our wedding day, I believe it'll start a trend- hehe) this other bakery was trying to rip us off and charge $500 extra dollars for \"labor\"!!! not to mention that I will be provided and making this thing, all they needed to do  was install  it in the cake) ...

Based on it's location, it seemed like it might be less pretentious than some of it's other centrally-located peers.  After several visits, I am glad to give it five stars for being one of my favorite coffee shops in the Phoenix area.\n\nOn my first visit here, I immediately noticed two things: 1) the roasting equipment and raw beans displayed prominently, indicating that they did indeed roast their own beans and 2) the prices, which are lower than the average coffee shop (I'm thinking Starbucks, which came to prominence with a reputation for high prices but has really fallen into the middle of the pack compared with the better local places that have cropped up) and far lower than most gourmet shops.  True, you're not getting a pour over for each cup, but you know that it was freshly roasted (and ground) and it's less than $2 a cup.  The beans are the real deal, though: $10.95/lb for freshly roasted, delicious coffee beans?  I know some good places for coffee but none of them can even touch that price, most hovering closer to $15/16 per lb.\n\nAlthough I usually go for regular coffee when exploring a new place, I decided to get a latte on that first trip visit, which did not disappoint - good smooth espresso flavor and the right ratio of milk for me.  The next time that I stopped in, I asked a few questions about the beans and bought a cup of coffee.  After some debate, I went with their Bold roast, which I later found out is also their espresso roast.  While it makes for a good espresso, I found it fairly light for a \"bold\" cup of coffee, and after adding just a splash of cream it tasted somewhat watered down.  In the future I'd probably go with one of their other roasts, particularly the Double French.  This is a mix between their dark Sumatra roast and Tanzanian peaberry.  I was a little concerned when I purchased it, as the barista told me to \"wait for the oils to come out on the beans.\" Though I don't know a ton about coffee, one of the things I thought I knew was that oily beans = ruined beans, but after making it at home on a French press, it quickly entered my upper echelon of coffees.  I also picked up some single source Guatemalan while I was there, a brighter and somewhat less flavorful roast, but still excellent.\n\nCompared to many of the other places in town, this place is perhaps a bit dumpy, but it's got good character and the baristas are super friendly and helpful.  They display art in the store and even have a special night for it each month (Second Saturdays?)  It's also very quiet and has outdoor tables, so I could imagine getting some work done there unlike more popular and louder shops.  I'll definitely be getting beans and drinks from this place in the future.", "business_id": "4eFIVmbeCvJGCrhzmd-VYA", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-08-02", "type": "review"}

I looked and saw they were a circle-what-you-want type thing, so I did that. Then he proceeded to tell me they were out of turkey as well as pepperjack. Ok, sub ham for turkey and jack for pepperjack. Then he tells me they're out of iced coffee....now sure how, but fine...I picked something else. As my credit card was running he made an exasperated noise and told me they were out of pretzel buns too. Honestly, I was at my wits end at this point, but since my card already run and I was starving, I just rolled with it and told him to put it on sourdough. The other guy behind the counter was apologetic, saying they get their shipments on Mondays and that was why they were out of so many things. \n\nI had asked the guy who rang me up for the wifi password and I sat down and attempted to connect to the wifi.

Then, at 1:30 he walked up to me and said \"I just wanted to tell you that we close at 2:00 sharp.\" I could already tell because they were bringing in the outside furniture, plus I had checked with the nicer of the two employees not two minutes before that, but thank you for the rude reminder.\n\nIt's really a shame that I had such an awful experience, because I'm signing a lease at a place really close to here.

And, while I find Nick S.'s opinions undeservedly harsh, they do contain kernels of truth that shouldn't be entirely dismissed either.\n   Regarding cleanliness: I contend that Tony's operates on the \"European Standard\". So ,if you've ever been, you know. If your home has anti-bacterial soap pumps at every sink, you carry antiseptic wipes in your purse or on your person at all times, and you fixate on the illusion of a 100% microbe-free world, you may want to \"pass\" on visiting Tony's. I'd assume then, that you would also avoid any contact with street vendors and food stalls in places like Mexico, Madrid, Bangkok, Hong Kong, et al? Yeah, we're all free to set limits on our individual tolerances, but at what cost to the fullest enjoyment of all that our one, single, lifetime has to offer? Scorpions on a stick, anyone? Perhaps a chilled brewski for starters. Do you do calamari, or not?\n   If you're of the more adventurous sort, at least poke your nose into Tony's for the cultural experience. I consider this place a bona-fide living history museum, with a least three generations of family in evidence, and at your service. Want the lights on in the grocery? Ask. Have a question about ANYTHING? Ditto.\n   Also, take time to see the mementos, memorabilia, kitsch, and exotic products liberally displayed on,behind ,and above the counter and entry. Yeah, there IS dust, but for me that doesn't diminish the faded, festive charm in the least. Nor does it alter the palpable sense of eras past, and present, that this place evokes in me. See the vintage ('50's?) black and white photo of Elvis w/some past friend or relation. Or, more currently, the color shot of, and shout out from, the entire Orangewood Cheer Squad of '09.\n   I admit that not everything at Tony's is superfine, or to everyone's particular taste. I don't especially care for the coarse grind of their sausage, for example, but the sliced meats and cheeses are very good, and well priced. I WOULD recommend checking expire dates on groceries, since the turnover on these items is unknown. I've found outdated items at AJ's, Fry's, and  almost everywhere else.  It happens.\n   If you're up for a purchase, let you senses (and common sense) be your guide. I \"second\" the votes for the subs, and the standard size, traditional cannoli @$2.15 is a bargain. (compared to $7 at Aiello's restaurant on Central, which I haven't tried.)\n   Another bargain here is the bulk olives. While I'm not a big fan of green or kalamata types by themselves, a good tapenade is always welcome. With jumbo plain greens @$3.50lb., and Greeks priced at the upper end of $5.49lb., you can pay $11 and up for the same thing elsewhere. Let the Snoot in you decide.\n\n   To wrap, YOU NEED TO KNOW about their SICILIAN olives.\nThey're black. They're ripe. They're wrinkled, and dry-cured, and shiny. They're salty,(very) not sour. They're earthy, deeply rich, and complex. They're meaty, satisfying, and delicious. They're addicting. They're sprinkled with fennel seed, red pepper flakes, and (on a good day) bits of fresh garlic. They conjure Mediterranean breezes, raven-haired maidens in aprons, and hillsides with goats. They're seaspray and sunshine; they're sublime. And they're $4.49. Match with a favorite wine, a crusty loaf, a chunk of cheese, and you're home.. Where the heart is... OR, you can eat them like candy. Try at least ONE in your lifetime.\n   Sadly, Tony's skips the minced garlic more often than not. If your purchase comes without, I strongly encourage you to add your own at home.

After trying to think of something a friend of mine who had begun dieting mentioned how Whole Foods is open late and has an awesome salad bar. Perfect! \n\nThe salad bar was just what we needed. It had a huge selection and almost everything in it was organic! The store itself was also huge compared to most of alternative grocery stores I have been to.

I'm budget-conscious (save more, spend more!), 2. it's several miles drive to another Walmart, and 3. for health reasons I don't have the ability to have to run all over NE Phoenix to do a few simple errands that I can often get done right here.  Plus - there are some things I can only get at this store and not at other grocers or even at the next closest Walmart.\n\nThat said, i'll be honest, this store continues to be a mixed experience and this 5 start rating and following review comments are LIMITED ONLY to the topic of their employees and service:\n\nSeveral of the employees at this particular store are truly wonderful people, some of whom have worked there for years and I'd like to give them mention by name.  They deserve special recognition for not only a job well done but for standing out -- in a positive light -- among their peers as excellent representatives of this Walmart Supercenter:\n\nNEDDY - always cheerful, kind, friendly and obviously a very hard worker\nBONNIE - we miss your friendly helpful nature at the self-checkout now that you've moved to pharmacy...  you always kept things moving with grace and ease\nNADA - warm and helpful, a fast, competent worker\nJAIRO - friendly and very helpful, knows his stuff\nJESSIE - always upbeat and friendly while obviously extremely competent and a real hard worker\nMAGGIE - fun and friendly, she really knows her job and how to keep a cool head\nAMANDA - lovely person and so helpful\n\nThere's also a woman w/long red hair (and an adorable grandchild that I met once while we were all in line :-)  I'm so sorry i didn't get her name but I'm sure her manager will be able to ID her...  She's super pleasant and one of the most efficient, competent cashiers I've ever met (along with the others mentioned here, of course!)\n\nThe 2 male greeters on the evening shift...  one from back east, NJ, I think: he's funny and friendly -- always makes a visit to WM an adventure.  And the other gentleman wears a small neat ponytail.... he's more understated but warm and friendly - always makes me feel welcomed though the door!\n\nAnd last but not least, the evening shift front end manager, Lou.  (not sure about title).  Lou deserves a hearty pat on the back and not only recognition for her own hard work and friendly, pleasant attitude (especially considering the pressures she must face), but she also deserves kudos and recognition for leading a team of so many outstanding representatives for Walmart in a store that still has some serious challenges.  \n\nThank you, Lou and thanks to your wonderful staff!\n\nPS - I'm sure to be able to get the other names and will try to eventually come back and update this when I do.", "business_id": "1OigyqVxIfE6AGKNGWZjnw", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-07-06", "type": "review"}

Well now, 10 years later (wow.), the sandwiches are still very tasty. I went yesterday with the BF for lunch and, despite a few flaws, it was really good. I had a half build your own sandwich and a cup of soup and the BF had a build your own sandwich. They forgot to put some of the items we asked for on both sandwiches....they forgot the BF's cheese and they forgot a couple of my veggies. Additionally, I asked for the pesto on the side and it came out on the sandwich, so I was not thrilled with that. Despite these errors, the food still tasted good. We both had turkey sandwiches, I had mine on focaccia with a bunch of veggies and the BF had his on sourdough with bacon. Both sandwiches had fresh ingredients and soft bread...very good. I also had the albondigas soup which was a bit on the greasy side, but had a lot of flavor.

I was thinking \"did I hear that right? Is this real life?\" I've had interesting experiences in restaurants before but this one takes the cake. I've never witnessed anything so unprofessional in my life. She eventually came over and apologized but it was kind of forced and unauthentic. She then started talking about my friends and I in a negative manner to some friends she had there while she was still working and we were still in the building. I won't ever be back. I was really upset and, even more so, embarrassed. It ruined my whole night despite my best efforts to continue having a good time.

I'll start with the fact that the owner/operator was extremely polite greeting you when you enter and welcoming you.  I had my 2 toddlers in tow, and this can be intimidating to most small shop owners knowing one bad move can cause chaos from a toddler.  We sat down ordered some meals, lamb gyro, chicken ka-bob sandwich, hummus.  Easy mediteranean meal almost imposible to mess it up.  We walked in at opening so it took 10 minutes or so for food, but the array of goods in the market to shop made the time fly.  With no prompting they took it upon them selves to split the gyru meal for my kids, which was awesome and a super time saver for me.  The flat bread pita was good more authentic to the chew than the buttery mall version (though I like both).  The meat was perfect the lamb tender with a nice sear on it, very generous thickness as well preserving the meat texture.  their tatziki was a chunky version with great flavor and a crisp cucumber crunch through-out very refreshing in the 100+ degree lunch temps we were having.  The chicken was good with a nice subtle flavor and plenty of juice left inside the well grilled meat.  \nThe hummus was traditional and very smooth more dip than spread.  \nOverall I am super impressed, the market has every canned and jarred good you could imagine from SPAM to stuffed Olive leaves and all stops in between.  The deli counter had a simple variety of olives and various feta cheeses, their produce was depleted (possibly because I walked in as they unlocked the doors) or not stocked yet.  I will be returning to shop and to eat again.  The welcoming owner made me feel as though my children will also be dining there regularly.  I will try to work my way through their menu board over the coming weeks, and will try to report back.", "business_id": "doEZAj-NSnoEMOJl5yXcNw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-08-16", "type": "review"}

We also often made a point to stop at the little street carts where Mexican men would serve up freshly sliced mango, pineapple, and papaya, coat them in lime juice and chili salt, and then pass them on to us for mere pennies. These stands, holes in the wall bursting with locals, and street carts were all part of how I experienced Mexican food growing up, and I absolutely love how Ranch Market re-creates this experience in the context of a full-service market. \n\nWhen you walk in to the market, we were immediately wowed by all of the colorful decor - streamers, pinatas, signage - and by the very varied selection of meats at the butcher counter. If you are interested, you can get a full-on cow's head for only $29.99! We turned the corner and realized that not only was there aisle upon aisle of dry and canned goods, but that the entire perimeter of the inside of the market was lined with little specialized stands where you could go to buy certain types of items to take home *and* try something right then and there - just like the taco stands and carts of my youth! As an example, you can walk up to the seafood counter and purchase octopus to take home and make a ceviche with, but you can also buy some fresh seafood tacos to eat as you shop! There were similar counters for the dairy, fruit drinks/horchatas, breads/pastries, and desserts categories. \n\nPerhaps even more exciting - there is a full eatery/cafeteria right inside the market that serves affordable and delicious Mexican fare. We ordered some assorted tacos, a carne asada quesadilla, and a drink, and it was only $9 or so for everything. The carnitas and chicken were decent, but the tortillas were warm and fresh, and the carne asada was out of this world. I usually find carne asada to be a bit tough and under-seasoned, but here it was tender but still chewy and rich with flavor. \n\nWe didn't actually do any grocery shopping, but we want to go back at some point soon (maybe at lunchtime) and buy some stuff to take home while sampling some goods from the different specialized stands. Some things that caught my eye to buy or try:\n\n*Pre-seasoned steak fajitas from the butcher\n*Seafood tacos from the seafood counter\n*Fresh fruit yogurt from the dairy area\n*Cuban sandwich from the eatery\n*Fresh-squeezed carrot juice from the juice stand\n*Rice pudding from the dessert counter\n\n...and many more! If you love Mexican food, stop in to the Ranch Market. You'll have your own list soon enough!", "business_id": "iyjEqYqSk-mAya95A9hW8w", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-08-18", "type": "review"}

My husband stopped there for a sandwich the other day - for only ~$5, he got a turkey sandwich, chips, and a beverage. He said that the meat wasn't great quality, but that the freshly-baked bread was phenomenal. He told me that they had a great selection of dates and figs (my favorite appetizers to make are bacon-wrapped dates and figs with blue cheese, but I always have a hard time finding them, especially figs), so I went back the other day to see their selection for myself. \n\nThe woman working greeted me with a smile, asked if I needed help, and offered me a sample of fresh watermelon (it was so juicy and sweet!). I told her I was looking for figs - unfortunately, they didn't have any fresh black ones, but they had some bagged white ones which I haven't been able to find at Fry's or Fresh & Easy. The price was pretty high ($4.50), but I didn't mind, since I knew they would be really fresh and that I would be supporting a family-run business and local growers. Plus, I already had the blue cheese and wanted to make my appetizer! \n\nThe only drawback of my experience was the $1.00 transaction fee they charged for paying with debit card. They had a little disclaimer up about being a family-run establishment, and I do understand that the economy's bad, but the fee is really high, even compared to mom-and-pop restaurants in the area.

I love it.\n\nHot damn, it was warm this morning, but not enough to make a difference on a 5-star place like The Farm at South Mountain.  I was in a rush to try this place out this weekend before it closed.  (FYI, it closes every summer from June - September.)\n\nYou pull up to the place in the midst of this vast city of ours to find a huge, and shady (in a good way) farm before you.  At the Morning Glory Cafe, the small menu has just the right mix of items to please just about anyone.  Lots of veggie options to be had here, btw (Bonnie would DROOL with desire here).\n\nThe food is really incredible.  They had my favorite dish on the menu - croque madame.  It had eggs, and some delicious asiago cheese and black forest ham on some crusty artisanal bread.  Ahh.  It was missing the bechamel sauce, but it made up for it with freshly-grown asparagus.  How did they know that's my favorite veggie?  I attribute it to kismet, of course.  It was accompanied by some terrific oven roasted potatoes baked in some spices and oil.  Nice...\n\nThe patio is cute in a rustic way.  Think checker tablecloths and white plastic chairs.  Not exactly sexy, but hey, it fits in the grand scheme of the farm.  They have a self serve area for water, lemonade and tea.  \n\nThe mimosas here are the best part.  For only $7.50 you get your own mini champagne bottle and orange juice.  So you're getting the better end of the bargain with about a mimosa and a half! \n\nService here was a bit slow to start.  But after paying the check I spot a wandering blueberry scone that is calling my name.  (Even better, is their scones are featured in Cooking Light magazine too.  Man I love this place.) So I give in, place an order and ask for it to go.  She brings it out.  I ask to pay in cash, since she already ran my debit card, and she says \"Don't worry about it.\"  \n\nCLASSY.  Classy, with a C.  The scone was DELICIOUS, btw.  Nice touch, and I leave her an extra tip for it. \n\nPrices are higher than average for Phoenix.  Expect to throw down about $40 for two.  But let me tell ya, that will be the best $40 you've spent in a while. \n\nI am now eager to try the other restaurants here.

We choose the grove (under the white tent in the pecan grove) for our reception (they have a few other locations to pick from depending on location on the property) and our ceremony was under the large wooden, vine covered arbor - perfection! As wedding prices go, it was definitely reasonable - no idea why the world thinks that in order to have a lovely wedding you need to drop oodles of loot - the Farm is a great option for nature lovers, people missing trees, grass etc, great food, amazing service and a memorable location for their wedding (it was actually less expensive than 90% of the hotel/buffet options out there)\n\nFood: there are three dining options at The Farm, Quiescence (fancy, high end dining) Morning Glory Cafe (breakfast/brunch), The Farm Kitchen - (lunch) I could write a novel here, but overall: the food is a little expensive (lunch is usually $10-$15/person with drinks or if you want desert tack on an additional $3-5 bucks) but it is very good, plus you get the great ambiance of dining under trees on a picnic table or in their little courtyard area. If it's busy prepare to wait awhile to order  and get your food (self serve, you gotta pick it up at the window when they call your number)\n\n For breakfast/brunch at Morning Glory expect similar pricing, but this is located towards the back of the property in a cozy little brick patio area - simple waiter service.", "business_id": "MLcXtnpzygZvQ9BtseLLlw", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-06-24", "type": "review"}

It was a lovely experience (from the environment to the service - having asked for my \"any style\" eggs to be hard boiled.  They didnt bat an eye at the request.) and I wanted to come back for Mother's Day with my family.   \n\nMother's Day - It's crowded.  I mean like WAY over 1+ hour wait for MG, crowded.  But that's understandable.  It was Mother's Day afterall.  If you want to come here for an event like the Mother's Day Brunch, reservations ARE required.  If you miss out on reservations for brunch, and decide to go to MG, go early!  \n\nWe decided to skip MG and were going to eat at The Farm Kitchen, but we ended up having to leave because Little C ended up having a major asthma attack.  We had used the valet service for parking, which offering valet on a busy day like Mother's Day is great.  BUT only if the service is organized.  We hustle back to the valet stand and I had over the ticket.  I look at the valet stand and there are key piled up everywhere.  No organization whatsoever.  They're digging for my keys, meanwhile Little C has just puked all over me for a 3rd time.  2 minutes go by and J and I ask them a couple times if they could please hurry and find our keys.  They find our keys and one kid runs off.  Next thing I know, the head guy (I'm guessing he was the guy in charge over valet), turns to us and says in a snarky manner...\"I'm SORRY your child is having issues.\"  \n\nUmm...excuse me?!  \n\nThank gawd they found the keys and got our vehicle up in a flash or else I would have had to not only call 911 for Little C's breathing, but for my putting my foot up that guys ass.   \n\nI think if we decide to come back, (which I'd like to go back because the atmosphere, service, and food at MG was great) we will self park across the street.", "business_id": "MLcXtnpzygZvQ9BtseLLlw", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-06-30", "type": "review"}

Warner Rd, Phoenix, AZ 85044. I have shopped at this Bashas for over 7 years. Today took the cake. It started at the Deli, I order the 8 piece chicken meal, and I would like to first and foremost state the girl who served me was excellent. I also wanted to get some chicken salad but there were no prices on any of the items so she found what she thought was the price and she quoted me 5.99 a lb. OK perfect As she was getting it for me her coworker called her out in front of everyone saying she misquoted you its 7.99 but she will honor the price. I was ok with that but to be called out for a mistake like that is very unprofessional.\nNow comes the biggest issue. Upon checking out with cashier 0135, Eva store #11 I gave her a coupon for Coke Cola which clearly stated .77 a bottle with my rewards card MAX 6. After we were done I checked my receipt and saw she only took off 1.22 for Coke which would equal only 1 bottle. 1.99-1.22=.77. Perhaps she should stop commenting on everything I bought and pay attention. \nI took my receipt up to customer service and cashier #501, who I really hope was not the manager.  I explained what happened he immediately takes my receipt and goes all the back to the Coke aisle to verify the price. While he was doing that I simply went and got a copy of the ad with coupon so I could show him. He comes back and tells me it's a MAX of 5. I show him the coupon to prove I was telling the truth it's a MAX of 6 so according to my calculations 1.22*5=6.10. As I am showing him this he is quickly working the register and tries to give me back a 1.99. My husband at this point is losing his patience and has to correct him and tell him No... 1.22 Per bottle discount times 5 is 6.10. Finally the guy gives me my refund. \nCan you please tell me why I have to do your employees jobs for them?

I frequent quite a few different Einstein's locations in the Valley, as I am all over the Valley for work. This one is the worst.\n\nI went in today midday and found that I was the only customer ordering (with a few people already served and eating). I ordered from the first line (where they take your order) my \"usual\"- cinnamon sugar bagel toasted with honey butter and cinnamon sugar on top. There were 4 employees on the \"line\", one taking my order, one putting paper in baskets by where you pay, and another one restocking the self-serve chiller in the middle. I proceeded to move over to the \"paying\" line and sat there as the employee putting paper in the basket just looked at me, not acknowledging that I was waiting to pay. The lady restocking the chiller (who was the only decent employee I had during this visit) came over and said that someone would be right with me. Nobody came to ring me up, so she went to the back and got someone to ring me up. I filled up my drink and turned around to see my bagel JUST going into the toaster, as 4 employees on the line talked and kidded with each other. My bagel popped out of the toaster and Zach (I found out his name later when I called to complain) took the bagel out of the toaster and set it on the counter. He then turned to a fellow employee and started chatting with him. When there was a break in the conversation, he spread butter on my bagel. It was apparently one of the employees' last day and she was leaving work. So Zach stopped making my bagel to say goodbye to her and chat with her before she left. All my bagel needed was cinnamon sugar sprinkled on top...as I sat there and waited. \n\nI finally stepped up and said, \"Hey guys, can I get my bagel? I have been waiting for a bit.\" Zach turned to me and replied \"You have only been waiting for 3 minutes and 51 seconds.\" Obviously, this didn't sit well with me, so I responded, \"Well there are a bunch of you standing around doing nothing and I am the only customer in here\". He finally gave me my bagel and I left.\n\nI called later and spoke with the shift manager who clearly remembered me. He explained to me that he would \"talk to\" Zach about his inappropriate/disrespectful response to me and that they are the 4th busiest Einstein's in the Valley. Funny, because I have been to busier locations who served me quicker and treated me with respect. Calling and speaking with the manager didn't accomplish much, so I will be calling corporate (1-800-BAGEL ME for anyone else who needs it).\n\nIN SUMMARY: long wait times, employees standing around not helping customers (like the other reviews), bad traffic flow, disrespectful employees\n\nTHE ONLY GOOD THING GOING for this place was the bagel was decent...hence the one star.\n\nI wonder how many people/reviews saying the same thing it is going to take before the store manager and corporate step in?", "business_id": "IYWTOj970XqG2z9Xft_8SA", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-07-01", "type": "review"}

But this is a perfect example of the fact that to be considered a 'good resturant', even if it is a basic resturant and not fine dining, they can't just throw good food at you and expect return business.  Ambiance and service are important pieces of that overall recipe.\n\nSo I'll start with the food.  This place serves the best, most authentic Mediterranean and Arabic food I've ever had.  The food is fantastic.  I'd say that's a pretty across-the-board statement... everything I've tried here is good.\n\nThe ambiance:  Flat out poor.  It is a combo ethnic grocery store and restaurant, so that is a pretty big handicap to overcome from the outset.  No real separation from the grocery store,  Seating area is crowded even though there is only seating for about 20 total.  The seating is primarily booths (that wobble and aren't bolted down) that look like they are from a 1980's McDonalds.  There are some cafe-style bar-height tables for two scattered about in addition.  During lunch it will get full enough that there will be poeple standing around, eating wherever they can find a bit of space ( a testament to the good food).  Cleanliness of eating area was marginal.\n\nService:  Only marginally better than the ambiance.  The servers, although they can handle orders in English, they clearly prefer taking orders in Arabic.  They have at most two people working tables, and often one.  The server is also responsible for running the grocery store cash register, so if 3-4 customers try to check out at the same time from the grocery side during lunch, they'll spend the rest of the meal trying to catch up.  You'll likely have to chase them down for anything except ordering the base meal and getting that brought to the table (and that might require proactive nagging as well).\n\nCost:  Very affordable for the quality of the food ($9-$12/person).  Runs on par with Spices and other Mediterrean places in the area.\n\nNet:  Not a good place for families, groups, or dates.  Great place for foodies that want cheap, good authentic food.", "business_id": "4rr-CJp0jMKr-kg9wnrTdw", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-08-11", "type": "review"}

Partial treatment.  One of the young waitresses caters to regulars.  For example, the other day she went out of her way to hand plastic cups to her group of friends and offered to individually pour them water.  Why not treat  all of your customers that way?  I felt like I was in high school again: extremely cliquey. \n\nI've also observed that one of the male workers gave free desserts to a family and a big block of feta cheese to a couple next to us.  Perhaps they were good friends.  But that's irrelevant.  Again, why not hand out free desserts & blocks of feta cheese to all of your customers?\n\nInconsistent quality of food.  One day my falafel sandwich was amazing - a mind-blowing experience.  But then a month later my falafel sandwich was a dismal disappointment.  There was no plump, well-cooked warm falafel inside of my pita sandwich.  Instead there were tiny bits of cold leftover crumbles of falafel thrown inside a soggy, almost inedible rubbery pita.  I complained to the waitress expecting a brand new falafel wrap to be made.  Instead she came back and handed me a plate of four disproportionately sized falafel; not a single one was in the nice shape of a medium-sized ball - one looked like an elongated, stretched out elephant turd, the other was in the form of a tiny black dot.  Plus it was overly cooked (crispy & burnt).  I'm guessing this was left over scraps from a burnt stove.  She told me to just \"throw it in\" my wrap as she quickly walked away.  \n\nWhat's the point in eating \"good tasting\" food if you're preoccupied with horrible customer service?  You cannot enjoy the food much less digest it properly.\n\nAlso, the establishment seems to exude a certain element of Arabic/Lebanese elitism.  Which probably explains the partial treatment of their \"favorite\" customers.\n\nFYI: I strongly encourage you to go to Haji Baba.

Second, no longer do you see the family members working there with their friendly faces but instead are these high school teens that don't care about their job and talk about their high school drama instead of showing some courtesy to the customers. Lastly they don't have a lot of toppings to choose from and I feel they're a bit pricey so I never get them.\n\nFor years I refused to get yogurt anywhere else because MFY was sooo good I didn't like any other shops but alas I have ventured and found other great places that are doing a better job at creating creamy yogurt.

This has to be the oldest Wal-Mart in the Mesa/Phoenix area and you can tell before you even step foot into the store!

Then you go into the store and the flooring is old and gross, the lighting is bad and it has a weird smell. \n\nIf you happen to need something and you can't find another store near by, this Wal-Mart still has great Wal-Mart prices and the people working and shopping there are really nice. BUT! Do not use their self checkouts!! You have been warned! Here's what happened to me: \n\nI scanned two items that I kept in the cart so I pushed that \"I do not want to bag this item\" twice, the scanner was having a really hard time picking up the bar codes so I had to very slowly repeat my waiving motion over the lasers. Any ways, I get to my next item and it's super light so when I put it in the bag it was like \"would you like to bag this item\" and since it wasn't picking it up, I just hit the \"I do not want to bag this item\" button again. Well...that was the 3rd item I didn't want to bag so it triggered an alert and I needed a 'Store log in\" The attendant was helping someone else so I sat there...and sat...until the guy came and fixed it for me. Then I got to scan my next item (super glue) - I guess super glue is a controlled item because, again, I needed an override. Okay, I finish up checking out and request $100 back...bad idea I come to find out - the machine only gives me half the change in $10s, but it's still making noises like it's trying to get money out to me. I call my helper over and he kicks the machine and it shoots out two $5s...the thing sounds like it's dying...so my helper calls over to a coworker, who comes over and says \"Well you've got to kick it, did you kick it yet\" So apparently this happens a lot.

I waited for about 10 minutes with multiple people walking by not even acknowledging that I was there. I had to ask someone if there was anyone available and she said she would check and no one came. About 25 minutes waiting, a young man walked up and asked me if I knew when they'd be back, I told him I didn't know and he apologized. (He was actually there for an interview) After 30 minutes a woman associate walked up and asked where the male associate was, I stated that I didn't know, and she seemed confused and it took her about 5 minutes to get my photos.  As I was leaving with my photos, the male associate finally arrived and looked as if he'd been sick for weeks. I do not blame the associates for this problem, I blame the company.

Considering the extreme amount of marketing Safeway does, since I know personally I receive a SW paper weekly, they should save some of their marketing money, and give us the consumers better discounts. Secondly, evertime I shop this SW, I find expired product. Many times they are discounting food that will be expiring in one to two days. How is that allowed?

None of them are dressed like they work there. They are wearing clothes that clearly don't meet health department specs...tank tops, hair hanging all over the place, open toed shoes, etc... They walked past customers in line, helped themselves to ice cream and stuff while customers had to wait to get their orders because these people were in the way. They didn't greet the customers. They didn't acknowledge the customers. That was bad enough, but then I go to the bathroom, and the little girl throws french fries over the booth into my purse. My boyfriend saw her doing it!

I quickly picked up my phone and texted a friend back in Denver. \"Guess what I found?\" He's a huge DD fan and the closest one is in Colorado Springs. I told him I was Driving Thru and was buying a small box of Munchkins and did he want to share. I got a text back . . . \"I hate you.\"  I just smiled and stuffed another jelly filled glazed Munchkin in my smiling mouth and I drove away exploring for more miracles.", "business_id": "YDeM8-M4GwxyymCoV7Y-Tg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-06-28", "type": "review"}

I always get the shaved ice here, so that's what I'll review. First of all, a shaved ice is a great treat to have when you're watching your weight...225 calories (add 75 for tropic creme) for a small one & it hits the spot! The small isn't really small either...it's a tiny mountain of fluffy, frozen, sugary goodness. \n\nI like that if you want something smaller a \"baby\" size is available :) (169 calories). They also have sugar-free options. Lots of flavors to choose from...I love to get 2 flavors side-by-side, usually pineapple & coconut. \n\nThis location, unlike others I've been to, has a drive-thru which is nice, but if there are cars ahead of you be prepared to wait awhile. I believe they close at 10:30 pm.

One lane open at 10pm? That's okay if there's only a few people checking out. However, when there are 20 people in line for one register and at least three employees walk by, two of which were clearly cashiers, and there is still only one register open, there's a problem. \n\nThere have been numerous times I have wanted to buy something, but didn't have 20 minutes to wait, so I put what I could back without wasting too much time and left. I know I am not the only person that has done this. \n\nEven during the day when there are copious amounts of people, there never seems to be enough cashiers. Why not do the local economy a favor and hire more? Or does the manager get a bonus if they can get employees to do double the work for a third of the pay? \n\nThat being said, if you can get a hold of Wendy or the other managed (his name escapes me) and you have a legitimate concern, they will help you out. Wendy does a lot for the community, and it is probably corporate's fault she can't get more cashiers but...

I'd even say that I'd rather have gelato at Arlecchino than at AS, which is a little saddening as there aren't many places to get gelato in Chandler.  Main reason I don't enjoy AS as much is the lack of textures in their frozen sweets.  Seriously, where are the textural components that were here a year ago?  Gelatos offered at Gelato Spot, Arlecchino, and even the wonderful gelato bar at Olive & Ivy have so much texture (provided by the addition of chocolate chunks, cookie clusters, nuts, such as hazelnuts, pecans, and pistachios, fruits, etc.) that I'm in ecstasy from the first scoop until the last; whereas the smooth texture and cloyingly-sweet taste of AS' gelato leaves me wanting for much more after only two itsy-bitsy scoops.  Gelato Spot tops off their gelato cups with a pirouline, and Olive & Ivy with a shortbread cookie.  AS?  Zip.  Nothing.  Nada.\n\nUnless they start offering great-quality chocolate-dipped wafflecones and bowls, and/or some great toppings to choose from, I probably won't stop in anymore.  FYI, I've had plain gelato from other places (including those I've mentioned above) and was satisfied with the intense flavors, so it's not like I NEED these extra bits to keep my tastebuds, olfactory system, and synapses happy.  \n\nBTW, the  prices have increased- the lower cost I found here as late as last year was a large factor in my positive reviews, but now I'd rather spend the same amount elsewhere and get what I want out of my dessert!", "business_id": "XWpkTxBLgRXxl7g2Hw62Qg", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-08-07", "type": "review"}

I only came to Desert Sage Herbs because it was on a recommended list to buy essential oils.\n\nI needed yarrow essential oil for a meditation inhalant blend I was developing and I needed the oils in less than a week.  At the time of this post, I know that MountainRoseHerbs sells 1/8th of an ounce for about $38 and Ananda sells 12mls for about $32 at the time of this post.  I needed this oil within 5 days and I was willing to pay rush shipping for the oil if i ordered it online.  But I I decided to give Desert sage herbs a try (I had never been there before).  \n\nI live in Glendale and drove over 40 miles (80 miles round trip) to get to Desert Sage Herbs and the first thing I noticed was how I was ignored by staff....no 'Hi', 'How are you', 'How can I help you, etc'  .  But it was ok because I started to look around to see what they had. Keep in mind, this is a very small store, and it is very hard NOT to notice that a customer is in the shop.  \n\nAfter about 10 - 15 minutes of looking, I had grabbed a few items (I had about $50 worth of items in hand and was going to buy) when a really nice woman with a brown pony tail finally came to me and asked me if she could do anything to help.  \n\nI asked her if she had any Yarrow essential oil and she said 'Yes we do' and proceeded to reach to get the bottle of Yarrow.  But then a blonde woman with short wavy hair looked at the woman helping me and said, 'No we are out of Yarrow'.  I looked at the bottle of Yarrow and it would have easily filled a 5/8DRAM bottle...which is listed on Desert sage's website for $22 dollars.  This would have been more than enough for me.  The woman assisting me began to say that it looked like they had some, but the blonde woman said, \"No, we can order some, just to let you know that it is INSANELY expensive'   \n\nOn Desert Sage's website, 5/8 dram of Yarrow is $22...a 1 Dram bottle is $36...this is not 'insanely expensive'....  \n\nhttp://www.desertsageherbs.com/Desert_Sage_Herbs/Essential_Oils_files/EO%27s%20Price%20List%20May%202015.pdf\n\nI looked at the her and said, 'It's ok, I'll just order it from Ananda' and then she paused and said, 'If you're not paying a lot for the Yarrow, then it is probably not good.'\n\nFirst of all, I know that Desert Sage Herbs gets a lot of their oils from Mountain Rose Herbs....and like I said, 1/8th of an oz of Yarrow is about $38 dollars (at the time of this review)...I was expecting to pay this (and more for mark up from Desert Sage Herbs....but they didn't want to sell me what they had).  \n\nI really didn't care about the price because I needed the oil....and I knew how much to expect to pay.   I could have ordered this oil online, and I was willing to pay rush shipping to get my oil in quickly.....  \n\nHad the lady behind the counter have been nice to me, maybe ASK me why I needed the Yarrow and if they were really out of Yarrow (when I saw that they did) then maybe she could have recommend another oil for what I needed and I would have understood.  \n\nThe lazy customer service, snooty, and condescending tone of this lady gave me was a turn off.  I put everything I had in my hands back and left.  I will never step foot inside this place again.\n\nCan you imagine how frustrating it is to drive 80 miles round trip for nothing?  Can you imagine driving over an hour in traffic down the 101....to be spoken down to in a condescending manner and told that they are out of something when they are not?  And then implying that the oil was just too 'insanely expensive' (exact words)....when their own website lists the price as $22 for a 5/8DRAM?  I have expensive oils in my collection including Neroli, Rose, and Tuberose....I do not buy oils based on price, but I buy them based on their therapeutic and energetic benefits.   \n\nI was ready to spend a pretty penny at Desert Sage Herbs, but after the rude and snotty customer service I experienced, I put all my items back and left.  I had about $50 dollars of times in hand and was planning on spending over $200 in loose herbs, flower essences, and other oils....ready to grab more items.....   I refuse to support lousy customer service with my hard earned money.....\n\nI am now convinced that the best place to buy oils ATM is Mountain Rose Herbs and/or Ananda apothecary....I am even open to trying Floracopeia to get the oils I need. \n\nI will not be returning to Desert Sage Herbs again.  Here is a list of online essential oil and herb suppliers you can compare shop with\n\nhttp://MountainRoseHerbs.com  (where desert sage herbs gets a lot of their herbs)\nhttp://www.anandaapothecary.com/  \nhttp://www.floracopeia.com/\nhttp://elizabethvanburen.com", "business_id": "Ym256yx44Fpdeqe0NwfWsQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-06-12", "type": "review"}

Coffee Rush has always been a favorite place of mine, and I've never had any trouble with the staff.  \n\nAfter just a few visits here, the staff learned my drink preferences.  And when I say \"the staff\" I mean everyone I've ever ordered from.  Nathan, Stefano, and Bethany just can't be beat at their customer service.  Over the time I've been coming here they've actually taken the time to get to know me a little, and that's refreshing.  If I miss a Monday night, one of them is always quick to point out that I haven't been.  This is only surprising because Coffee Rush seems to have SO MANY regulars; it's wonderful that everyone here really does try to get to know you.\n\nThe menu has a lot of really wonderful drinks on it, from lattes to Italian sodas, and more types of tea than you can shake a stick at.  They're always willing to recommend a drink if you're in the mood for something different, and I've never had a bad drink.  My recommendation?  A first-time Rusher should get the black and white (hot, iced, or frost it's delicious).  I'm currently on a chai kick, but I order it with soy instead of milk for a little added flavor.  Delish!\n\nThere's not a huge food selection: mostly breakfast pastries and desserts, but it's all good.  They usually have a few different varieties of cheesecake, from the traditional to the utterly decadent.  However, if you're feeling a bit peckish, they won't frown upon you bringing in your own food.  Just don't bring your own drink.\n\nMondays are double-punch days, so there's extra incentive to go!  They're usually quite busy in the evenings on Mondays, but the staff has always been willing and able to accommodate our relatively large group when we go.\n\nWiFi is available with the purchase of any drink, or you can choose to get a computer code that lets you access the Mac minis in the back.  Codes expire after three hours, which I find to be more than reasonable.\n\nHours are great--open early in the morning until midnight, with a last call for drinks at 11pm.  The view is stunning, and there's outdoor seating (good for smokers and anyone willing to brave the Arizona heat) and indoor seating to spare.\n\nMost of the one and two-star reviews mention customer service, which I can somewhat understand.  My tip?  Order a drink before you sit down.  It's common courtesy.  Would you sit down in a restaurant for an hour before you were ready to order your meal?

I can always appreciate local, small coffee shops and am always looking for new environments to get my studying done. I had been to Coffee Rush several times before, and usually order something directly off the \"favorites\" menu for convenience. When I first got to the coffee shop this morning, I decided to sit down and study a little before I ordered a drink. The barista behind the counter appeared outgoing, interacted well with the customers, and worked quickly to make drinks. I particularly appreciated when a customer asked him to create a drink of the barista's choosing, and the barista gladly made something interesting for him. After about 30 minutes, the barista directly spoke to me over the back counter while I was studying and asked me to \"Come on up.\" I was a little confused-- was I obliged to buy a drink right away before I was allowed to sit down to study? I had full intention of buying a drink... I just didn't want one RIGHT now. I didn't want to be rude and it would have been awkward if I just ignored him, so I went up to the line to make a purchase. When I got to the front counter, I asked the barista if they made Jasmine tea lattes. He threw a bunch of jargon at me like \"London fogs\" and different styles of lattes, and gave me a judgmental look when I told him I wasn't familiar with the terms. I proceeded to suggest that he make a recommendation or come up with something tasty because I wasn't picky, but instead, he tells me aggressively that I needed to tell him exactly what was in the drink. For the third time I tell him I don't know what's in it, and explain that I just usually ordered a drink called \"Jasmine tea latte\" when I go to places like Coffee Bean. That's probably when I hit the wrong button. At this point, he condescendingly tells me he does not 'frequent that place' and still cannot tell me how to make the drink that I request. I'm standing there uncomfortably while a bunch of people are waiting behind me. Instead of doing his job, which I thought was creating drinks and coming up with new combinations/flavors, he forces me to just buy a drink that I didn't even want from the wall menu just to get the line going. And I thought he created a new drink for the other guy in front of me?! I didn't appreciate being spoken to that way by an unprofessional and pretentious employee, so I left as soon as I got my unwanted drink. I'm sitting here now at Coffee Bean writing this bad review and plan on ordering myself a Jasmine Tea Latte.", "business_id": "l1MZjZK2tLxfFRB62lQmsg", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-07-25", "type": "review"}

Amazing way to expand your palate...though I must admit that sometime my palate doesn't stand up quite so well to my adventurous spirit.\n\nLee Lee (particularly the live seafood and meat counter) is not for the faint-hearted nor for those pressed for time as they have their own unique way of labeling the aisles by country....so if you're looking for soy sauce, then it would be in the soy sauce aisle as well as in the Japan aisle and the Korean aisle depending on what brand you're looking for and where they're made...and some origin labeling can really make you wonder what they were smoking...for example, ketchup was in the African-Caribbeans aisles\n\nGo there when you've got a free afternoon...my latest treasure hunt at Lee Lee yielded real dulce de leche from Argentina.\n\nGood luck hunting!", "business_id": "5KG0A3WlC7K3DAXtrIFFjg", "stars": 5, "date": "2007-08-28", "type": "review"}

Seriously, my boyfriend has to herd me around, lest I spend 45 minutes choosing frozen Indian breads. (Paratha? Naan? Batura? Roti? Garlic, onion or plain?) Or trying to justify purchasing five pounds of lamb. Or considering the merits of roast duck. \n\nAnyway, before I get sidetracked again, let's start where I always do -- the booze aisle. Lee Lee carries a wide variety of Asian beers, of course, plus some good sakes and plum wines. But there's always at least one too-good-to-be-true booze selection. Yesterday it was a half case of Widmer Hefeweizen for $6.88. I've also purchased Konig Ludwig Bavarian weissbier for $2.99 a six-pack, Carlsberg Elephant beer for $9.99 a case, Warsteiner mini-kegs for $7.99 and countless other delights at \"fell off a truck somewhere\" prices. \n\nIf that's not enough to get you to brave Lee Lee's jacked-up parking lot and hordes of chattering families of all ethnicities (united only by an uncanny ability to get in your way), consider this: Lee Lee is also home to aisles of non-Asian delights, like Jamaican jerk sauce and Mexican spices. And of course, my favorite -- the lovingly labeled \"Holland foods\" section. I don't .know why it's there, but  I do know that pickled herring is fucking delicious.\n\nBy the time I leave, my cart invariably looks like the shopping list for a dinner party at the United Nations.\n\nA very drunken dinner party.", "business_id": "5KG0A3WlC7K3DAXtrIFFjg", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-08-31", "type": "review"}

It is rather big, roughly the size a larger grocery store. The parking lot is a bit on the scary side and the store is often crowded, but the latter should be a good indication of what to expect inside.\n\nLee Lee has a nice produce section, full of staple fruits, vegetables, tubers and so forth like carrots, apples and potatoes, but it also has a wide array of specialty foods like Indian eggplant, bok choy, lemon grass and dare you try it, durian. As a vegetarian I can't fairly describe the seafood and butcher section, but I can it's large and inclusive, from catfish to pig uterus. Beyond that there are aisles dedicated to Korea, Japan, Thailand, the Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia, Brazil/Caribbean, India, the Middle East, ramen noodles, dried noodles, imported liquor, hefty bags of rice and more. \n\nLee Lee can be a fun place, but it's largely practical. I find that I can get about two weeks' worth of groceries on one trip. However, I always have to go to my local grocer to get some odds and ends Lee Lee doesn't carry, like bagels, cheese and a few other minor things. Other than that I come out with a large amount of groceries for a reasonable price. Don't let the cultural barrier dissuade you. It's a great place to get nori maki arare, Japanese candies, Thai chilies, chicory coffee, tahini, instant Indian meals, crates of ramen, frozen samosas, chutneys, wasabi, incense, and much, much more, right down to bizarre eats: sake in juice boxes, cheese and corn ice cream, grass jelly, silkworm pupae, canned crickets and unnameable horrors from all corners of the globe.\n\nWith that in mind, remember the HSBC marketing campaign of cultural perspectives: delicious in one, disgusting in the other, etc. Give it a shot, try something new while also finding old favorites.", "business_id": "5KG0A3WlC7K3DAXtrIFFjg", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-06-12", "type": "review"}

I always felt it was missing something.  I couldn't put my finger on it.  Was it the lack of meat and seafood?  Yes it was.\n\nLee Lee's is everything I have been looking for in a supermarket.  A produce, meat and seafood section that goes beyond my wildest dreams.  I could have spent a few hours in the store but I was on a time schedule.  \n\nYou know how the back of a market usually covers liquor, meat, seafood and dairy?  Not this place.  It covers meat and seafood and that's it.  it's huge!  They had live tanks with cheap lobster, talipa, catfish, crabs and some fish I have never seen.  Then there is a fish station with every fish I've ever heard of and maybe 20 others.  They'll chop it up for you or fry it free of charge.  The meat section has any cut of meat you could imagine.  Bellies, feet and legs included.  I didn't even know you could buy pork blood by the pound.\n\nThe produce is out of this world.  Veggies I have never seen.  Peaches the size of my head.... and every kind of choy you can think of.  Best part, all of it was the same price of Sunflower, if not cheaper.  \n\nThe aisles are incredible as well.  A whole aisle dedicated to noodles!!  An African aisle!?!!?   Two Korean aisles.  I couldn't believe what I was seeing.  They also had a wonderful imported beer lane but I don't think it compares to the prices at Topps liquor.  \n\nI was so overwhelmed on what to buy so I kept it to a minimum.  I bought the produce I normally buy and I saved a good amount of money.  I bought a fish I've never heard of and now I have to figure out how to cook it.  I saved a lot of money buying it.  4 pounds for $7.  \n\nWithout a doubt, next time I go I am going to have some recipes in mind.

I love it here and I love browsing the aisles looking at food from all over the world:  African, Brazilian, Indian, Korean, Japanese, Chinese and picking up items that I've never seen or tried before.\nEach shopping trip feels like a trip through the United Nation of Food.\nLove it, love it, love it!", "business_id": "5KG0A3WlC7K3DAXtrIFFjg", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-06-20", "type": "review"}

Lee Lee's is a staple for those ingredients or food items you're just not going to find at a Fry's or Safeway. It's not even strictly \"Asian\" - I used to get a good bit of Brazilian food items from here :)\n\nSome tips:  \n(Note: All of the things I describe below I have been able to accomplish without any skills speaking any sort of Asian language)\n\nFish counter: they will remove the scales and guts of any fish they sell. They will also cut it however you want. \n\nMeat counter: You can even order marinated Korean BBQ (they will thinly slice the pork/beef and marinate it for you). You pick it up ready to throw on the grill. \n\nOther meat: they sell chicken hearts (don't judge. They're delicious).\n\nProduce: lots of Asian veggies and some fruits (not sure if \"seasonal\" is the correct way to describe the variation in fruit selection - really it just *varies*). Fantastic selection of fresh herbs (stock up - you can pre-chop and freeze. Throw the frozen herbs into your dishes while you're cooking).\n\nRice: the only place I buy rice. Pretty exhaustive selection. Be prepared to buy at least 10lbs.\n\nNoodles: every noodle type you could need. \n\nSpices: Don't ask me why, but their Thai curry paste selection is the best you will find. I absolutely cannot make a decent green or red curry unless I use a paste from Lee Lee's. \n\nOther: they have some decent bakery items, frozen items, and kitchenwares you can buy. Not the *best* selection in these areas but better than nothing in most cases. \n\nNavigation tip: try and discern what a product is by the picture on the label. Lee Lee's a lot of imported brands and not everything has an English translation on the label. Or, sometimes I will go to a section and find something with an English description and then search for another item that's similar but with a non-English label (this has worked on multiple occasions to get more authentic item without being completely surprised by my purchase).", "business_id": "5KG0A3WlC7K3DAXtrIFFjg", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-08-01", "type": "review"}

Lee Lee's has never had an outstanding Japanese food section, but it had most of the essentials. Being of Japanese descent, this section was a lifesaver for me-but no more. Instead of the familiar brands and selection of Japanese goods a ten-foot section of shelves was being fronted with CostCo (Kirkland) roasted seaweed. While I do buy seaweed from CostCo occasionally, when I'm having some good rice I look for the slightly thicker and more flavorful Japanese brands.

Maybe I'm the only germaphobe).\n\nThe one downfall was the cart, while not disgusting, and there were wipes, was not the most appealing (aka dirty). Got over it quick since I found everything I wanted.....that day. ;) Happy, happy, happy Target snob today (well, yesterday lol).", "business_id": "DcML-4f7oib19ed67Ruv6w", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-06-27", "type": "review"}

If you tell them it quickly becomes obvious that they do not care.\n\nBe careful if you use the bakery because apparently the \"bakers\" don't understand that when you remove bread from the oven you are just supposed to let it cool before wrapping it, and not let it sit for hours exposed to open air. You can get \"fresh\" bread that was just recently baked and still have it be like two day old bread! If you happen to mention that you could fracture someone's skull with the bread they are highly offended.\n\nIt's surprising how many \"mistakes\" they make in their pricing, and the \"mistakes\" are always to their advantage. If they ring up the wrong price on an item and you show them that the price on the shelf is different, it is likely that they will tell you someone forgot to remove the old price tag. There is a LOT of forgetting in this store. You may well have a problem trying to figure out the actual price of an item given that they have so many schemes where they display a price prominently like it is the actual price, only to find that there is small print that explains all of the conditions that have to be met before you will get that price. It's quite obvious that they make a lot of money off of people buying stuff that they thought was lower in price.  As an added bonus, this store must have some of the highest prices in a grocery store anywhere. They put stuff on sale that is still much higher than normal prices at another store.\n\nWaiting in a long line happens all too frequently because they have no self checkout and only one cashier most of the time.\n\nI have been to this store (as a secondary choice) extensively for years just because it is so close to where we live, but I have had enough.

There was a mistake made when entering my purchase and was overcharged by 19 dollars.

I saw this charge on my account a week later and was shocked! When I went to the store to see if they could remedy this situation, the owner was rude to me and told me because there was no proof (I didn't have my receipt) that there is nothing he can do. Instead of trusting his customer and remedying the mistake his employee made, he was rude and basically called me a liar. I am so upset about being over charged, I WILL NEVER GO HERE AGAIN. Please do not give them business ( See's candy is just downstairs), the owner is rude and does not know about good customer service.

She suggested several items and very patiently took care of two of us adults and the kids while we waited for two others in our party to arrive.  Hannah was very attentive and engaged our kids too!  This is always great from a server because our children are a big part of our experience and they comment to us on restaurants, services, hotels and entertainment.  Sometimes too much.  Our daughter loves the bread the Factory brings to your table and of course the Godiva Cheesecake!\n\nOur other dining guests arrived, with more shopping bags then we left them with, and we proceeded to enjoy the palate creations from the menu. We decided to try multiple appetizers for a variety of flavors. We ordered the fried artichoke hearts, avocado eggrolls, Tex-Mex eggrolls, ahi tartare, shitake asparagus bacon pizzette and Thai lettuce wraps.  The kids enjoyed mini corndogs and bowtie pasta.  Our son loved the mini corndogs because they came skewered and he had sticks to stab his fries and anything and anyone at the table. \n\nThe different flavors and textures were wonderful.  Our table have been/are in the food business and we enjoyed discussing the sauces, what we would change, how it would affect the items they came with and just plain enjoyed the entire meal.  We also enjoyed the drinks, particularly the sangria.  It was very fruity and extremely refreshing on the patio!  \n\nWe ordered cheesecake, the Godiva Chocolate, for our daughter of course, the Dutch Apple Streusel and the Caramel Pecan Turtle.

The sauce and the chicken did not go together at all.  My wife had the chicken mushroom lettuce wrap.  It was OK at best. We ended the meal with the warm apple crisp with ice cream. It was way too sweet; spoon for spoon, pure sugar would be less sweet. Only the vanilla ice cream and whipped cream were any good.

I couldn't decide on dinner and asked for her to give me a recommendation.  \nI went with a salad, I think it was their version of an Asian salad but truly I just can't remember.  I had asked if there was a salad with strawberries and chicken and what she suggested is the one I had, but she got the kitchen to add strawberries so it was more to my liking.  Excellent.\nAnd hubbies pasta was served up as he had requested too.

Not being a fan of Key Lime pie I wasn't so thrilled with that part but thought the Mango might make the Key Lime a nice blend.  Eh, not the case.

I came here with the party of about 15 a few nights ago and was thoroughly impressed with how accommodating they were to our needs. They were quick to seat us, bring us waters and provide us with bread while we waited for the entire party to arrive. They checked back frequently for all of us to arrive and was ready and waiting to take our order when we were all present. Also, they had no problem initially separating our checks during ordering so we wouldn't have to worry about splitting the check later on. Which was GREATLY appreciated and made checking out that much easier. Now, everyone knows how overwhelming Cheesecake's book of a menu is. I didn't mind waiting for our late friends because it takes that long to decide what to order. They also have a separate \"SKINNYLICIOUS\" menu that I've never seen before! This is news to me. We are usually pretty healthy eaters but this particular night was a \"cheat\" day for us. We ordered off the regular menu: fried avocado, zucchini, and portobello mushroom starter and the avocado egg roll appetizer. They were both great. In attempt to be somewhat healthy, I ordered the almond crusted salmon kale salad on the regular menu and this dish is not good at all. I gave it a chance and took a few bites hoping that the salmon flavor would kick in or the dressing would save it but I didn't taste anything. It was very bland. I had to ask the waiter to take it back because I didn't even want to take it home. I hate doing that and wasting food but I had to and he was so nice to take it off our bill. Thank you so much, I really appreciated it. Thank goodness my fianc\u00e9 ordered the salmon and steak plate because it was enough for both of us to share and the flavor profile of this dish was wonderful. The steak flavor reminded me of adobo and the salmon was cooked to perfection. I had no more room for dessert which was a bummer because I love almost every dessert I've ever tried here. But I did have the privilege of trying my friends lemon cake/strawberry cheesecake and it was SO GOOD. I will need to get it the next time I go in.

There's something for everyone here no matter what meal you seek--breakfast, lunch, or dinner, and it is all good.\n\nBreakfast is served later on the weekends, but it's worth getting up for on any weekday.  Their frittatas are delicious, but I'm nuts about the toast.  The bread is flavorful, crispy, and chewy all at once.  Just make sure you ask for jam.  It comes in a cute glass container, and the flavors are divine.\n\nLunch is usually why I come here, and Wildflower never fails to disappoint.  As a vegetarian, coming to a bakery can sometimes be difficult.  Not many places offer veggie-friendly sandwiches that are actually tasty, but Wildflower offers several.  My favorite is the roasted sweet potato, but the portobello picnic is climbing the charts.  They rotate through a seemingly-endless selection of soups, and always offer at least one (though usually 2) vegetarian-friendly soups each day.  My favorite?  The vegetarian black bean.  Hearty, mildly spiced, and served piping hot.  I wish they served it every single day, but even if they aren't, I have half a dozen menu items from which to choose.\n\nI finally had their pasta the other day, and this has proven to be the second-biggest disappointment about this restaurant.  This isn't to say that it was bad!  In comparison to the rest of their stellar food, the pasta was merely satisfactory.  Still filling, and still a masterful medley of flavors and ingredients not often found in food at chain restaurants.\n\nDesserts are rather \"eh.\"  Twice I've had the coconut lemon torte (I think that's what it's called?) and while the flavors blended well, it had the distinct taste that freezer-burned baked goods have, and that was enough to put me off of ever ordering dessert from them again.\n\nStill, the fast, friendly service and excellent breakfast/lunch menu is enough to make me rate this place 4 stars.  Even during the lunch rush I've not had to wait more than a few minutes for my food, though it can be next to impossible to find a table sometimes.", "business_id": "U9iWs_XQ88IEj_Cgawyz4w", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-06-30", "type": "review"}

It wasn't a fave WBC item of mine in '03 (it was all about the Lemon-ricotta pancakes for me then, and still now, although I haven't had any since Sedona, and that's bec. it's rare for me to make my way to WBC on the weekends, when breakfast is served till 2p, and before 10:30a on the weekdays), but I really am a fan of it now!  Even if you aren't a vegetarian, as long as you like your veggies, you would find something you'll like in this sandwich.  (WBC is also willing to customize most items for you- omitting certain veggies and subbing others, if need be.)  This sandwich was very filling, and I could easily have squeezed two meals out of the serving.  I didn't.\n\n5/26/10\n\nWas very hungry, and I couldn't decide if I wanted the Penne or Linguine or the Chopped Salad, so I ordered both!  The pasta came w/ a choice of pasta and a choice of sauce (marinara, pesto, or alfredo), topped w/ parsley and grated parmesan.  All pasta dishes, available from 3pm 'til closing, are served w/ a small piece of grilled garlic bread.  I chose penne and alfredo sauce.  The chopped salad usually comes w/ wild Alaskan salmon, couscous, feta, arugula, red bell peppers, sweet corn, dried cranberries, and sunflower seeds, w/ a pesto vinaigrette and a bit of bread.\n\nDidn't care for the penne alfredo at all.  The alfredo sauce was VERY watery, w/ no viscosity to it, whatsoever.  It was very bland- I asked for more parmesan, but it didn't help.  Next time, I'll try the pesto.  The chopped salad, however, was terrific!  I ordered mine w/out the red bell peppers and corn, but it was still very flavorful.  The texture of the wild salmon seemed of the canned variety, but it was nicely presented, and added another dimension to what was already a great salad.  I'd have been happy w/ the feta, couscous, arugula, dried cranberries, and pesto vinaigrette!  Loved the flavor that the sunflower seeds gave to the salad, as well as the crunch factor- so much fun!!  The plain bread that it came with, however, was pretty dull, but that's just me.  Next time, I'll ask if they can sub some grilled bread, instead.", "business_id": "U9iWs_XQ88IEj_Cgawyz4w", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-07-24", "type": "review"}

The one in Cupertino is nice and big.  I had some time to kill before I went to a movie and it was July 4th so some of the other places had closed early.  BJ's was pretty empty.  I bellied up to the bar and the bar tender was there instantly.  She was great!  She gave me a menu and gave me a minute to look over a wine list because, silly me, I thought I would have a glass of wine....what was I thinking?  The bartender told me they had a great seasonal brew so I said I would give it a try.  It was a heif...er.....hief....dang, I can't spell it...but you know what I mean and it was good!!  It has a nice cardomon finish but not overpowering at all.  \n\nI ordered a Santa Fe Salad and it was delish!  Nicely cooked chicken breast and cruncy tortilla strips.  The dressing was good but a little too much of it.  Still I would order it again but maybe ask for dressing on the side.  \n\nThe service was stellar.  The bartender, which I could remember her name, was knowledgeable and she was pleasant.  We chatted a bit and she was the same with the other patrons at the bar too.  When you eat on your own it's nice to go somewhere where the service is friendly and welcoming.  They brew the beer here too.

Me, my mother, husband and 5 month old son went to the restaurant on a weekday night around 10:00pm after leaving the movies..... ( We Saw \"Brave\" Great Movie) \n\nAnyhow, lets get right to the important stuff when we entered the restaurant it was very clean, the setting was very romantic, it is a very smooth relaxing place for grown mature adults and families....  We received Friendly customer service immediately as soon as we walked through the door.... Since it was a pretty late  Monday nite  it wasn't too busy so, our waitress informed us that we could sit wherever we pleased.... We took a seat in a nice big round booth that was pretty comfy.... \n\nThe waitress was very nice and pleasant..... Their menu is huge they have everything from Lobsters to burgers, salads, pizza and everything in between except for breakfast.... They specialize in freshly brewed beer and drinks.... Me and my husband don't drink so unfortunately I can't give a review on the alcohol.... Once seated the waitress took our drink order and me and my mom ordered they're Strawberry-Lemonade...... It was cool and refreshing, very tasty, the drink had plenty of strawberries the lemonade was not tart or too sweet, it was just right..... The waitress told us that they make it fresh every morning.... They actually charge per glass for the strawberry-lemonade..... But, our waitress gave us free re-fills...... (So in return she received a huge tip) \n\nSo on to the best part.... (I did taste everyone's dish)The food was Hot, freshly made, and very flavorful....  My mother ordered grilled pork chops with mashed potatoes and veggies.... Her meal also came with this awesome sauce which I will get into in a moment....  The grilled pork chops were so tender and juicy the seasonings and flavors were just right..... I will most definitely be ordering that next time I go again..... They also gave my mom this great vinaigrette, red wine, mustardy, type of sauce for the pork chops.... The sauce was amazing.... The mashed potatoes where fresh and hand mashed or blended (either way it wasn't instant mashed potatoes) They were red potatoes and they were seasoned just right and they were delicious.... (my 5month old son loved them) The mixed veggies were steamed and seasoned lightly.... They still had a nice crisp to them and great bright color..... \n\nNow my husband he ordered the salmon with veggies and white rice.... His salmon was very moist and  tasty......  The rice was lite and fluffy..... The veggies were crispy and very refreshing.... My husband had water with his meal....\n\nLast but not least, I ordered the steak salad... The salad was green, fresh, crispy and cool it had romaine lettuce and a lot of other great healthy greens.... the salad came with a very flavorful vinaigrette dressing.... they placed the steak on the side of the plate.... I think that they were a little stingy with the steak.... but other than that the steak was juicy cooked med-well and had a great taste..... The salad was very fulfilling and tasty..... it also came with a piece of bread and it was good nothing to brag about..... \n\nOverall this is one of my favorite restaurants.... Me and my husband usually go here for our date nites and when we want to be romantic..... Its a great atmosphere and the food is amazing.....", "business_id": "IMGW6y8wHQCfr_6k-YXg_A", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-07-21", "type": "review"}

I haven't been here since probably they opened way back in the day. It is one of my girlfriends favorite places and after the first place we were going to go to was full of obnoxious drunk people I decided we should come over here after hearing her talk about it. It turned out to be a great decision.\nThere was a 20 minute wait when we arrived but that was not a big deal and not to bad for a Saturday night at a place at a mall. We put in our name and we were given a buzzer so we waited. The hostess even used my name when we came back in when the buzzer went off. Not a big deal but a nice touch. Most places ask for a name and never use it. The place was pretty busy but still not too loud. We got a nice booth and started to look over the menu. They had a lot of stuff that looked good. My girlfriend advised against any pasta dishes as she felt they didn't measure up. Of course she is part Italian so she is going to be a touch critic on Italian dishes. I saw the double cheese burger and my eyes lit up. Can't pass that up. Well it turned out to be a good and bad thing. That burger was HUGE but so good. Big patties, bacon, cheese and everything else. Cooked just how I wanted it. Very good. As got the spicy potato wedges, another tip from the girlfriend, they were delicious. Good thing I was hungry from swimming most of the day but I still couldn't quite finish it. Also I was saving some room for a Pizookie. Which I had never had and my girlfriend never goes to BJs without getting one.\nI ordered the triple chocolate one and even though there was a little bit of a wait for it, they don't make it until you order it, it was so worth the wait. So ooey and gooey and good. I will definitely be having one too every time we come back here.\nOverall, I really liked this place. Maybe won't get such a huge burger next time but I will be back. I also really like their in house beer. I had the Scottish ale and it was really good. I would like to try more of their different beers next time.\nThere will definitely be a next time.

I'll start with the positive:  The appetizer platter we got was very good and the kids LOVED the mozzarella sticks.  The adults enjoyed the avocado spring rolls, the other kind of spring rolls (not sure what they were called), and the artichoke dip with chips. The beers we selected were also good.  I loved mine, but once again I can't remember the name (it was the one our waitress said was the closest to a blue moon beer).  Lastly their thin and crispy fries were wonderful!  \nOk, so now for the bad:  The men in our group ordered some kind of chicken tacos and the other ordered a personal size pizza...both were TINY portions.  I was not thrilled with the so called sourdough bread that my California chicken sandwich was on...the bread tasted a little burnt.  The worst thing about this meal was that the waitress announced that they were out of the chocolate chip pazookie dessert for the rest of the evening....WHAT?!  When you have little kids that look forward to this dessert, it is not a good thing when you are told that!  This was a late Saturday afternoon...how do you not have plenty of those desserts on hand for a SATURDAY NIGHT????  I still enjoyed the white chocolate and macadamian nut mini pazooki that I got and the kids liked the cookies and cream one they tried.  The pazookies at Oreganos are still better in my opinion....\nAnyway, not sure if we will be going here again, but maybe we'll try the deep dish pizza next time.", "business_id": "IMGW6y8wHQCfr_6k-YXg_A", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-08-18", "type": "review"}

This is a busy business, but has adequate seating between the bar, the huge and beautiful restaurant and outside patio seating. We waited around 15-20 minutes on a busy night, but definitely worth it.\n\nSometimes you go places and the menu is so small that it's either really easy or really hard to make a decision. Not the case with BJs! The menu is practically a bedtime storybook, which is awesome because you get to decide from a huge array of dishes, but also a pain because you want to eat everything, as in the case of myself! Boyfriend got the buffalo chicken wonton tacos for an app and he enjoyed them. He had the lighter option pork chops and enjoyed those as well. I had a burger and fries and it was very good. Service was good, too! \n\nAnother great thing is the dessert menu, which has a lot of good options, especially more than the average restaurant. (I'm not lying! See here: http://www.bjsrestaurants.com/menus/desserts). Opted for the Baked Beignet, but they were out of it, so 2nd choice was the Oreo Cookies N Cream Pizookie! It was suuuuper delicious.

They've got a very extensive menu with various types of cuisines, so it's sure to suit everyone in your group or the individual who just can't decide on one food type that sounds good. \n\nI've tried several things on the menu in the past, and I've thoroughly enjoyed their signature gynormous potatoes, tasty beer, and melt-in-your-mouth pizzookies.  If you're looking for something with a little bit of spice, try their jambalaya - not sure how it fares with authentic cajun cooking, but it hits the spot.\n\nI may have to give the lunch menu another try, but I was a bit disappointed with the things I tried today: Chicken quesadilla- hardly any cheese and not enough food for a lunch, Margherita Flatbread - too small and sauce tasted like the diy luncheable pizzas from elementary school, Turkey bacon ham sandwich - just your regular sandwich nothing special, and their Pale Ale chili - no spice and not a very good overall flavor.\n\nDespite my lunch experience, I'm giving them a 4 because my past meals have been consistently good.

And when I say east, I'm talking east of the loop 101.  I appreciate the fact that they have live bands, and it's only a few miles from the house, making it an affordable cab ride home, or worst case scenario, a long walk.  \n\nThe kitchen is open until 11pm on the weekends which is nice, I ordered the fish and chips with onion rings as a side, which was pretty tasty and would easily feed two people.  They also have a crazy long happy hour, but I forget what the exact hours are.   I dig their slogan as well, \"The Liver is Evil and must be Punished!\"\n\nTonight the service was great, Sean/Shawn deserves special praise as a bartender.  In addition to being a great bartender, he gave me the low-down on the best bacon-aversion routes to avoid the Gilbert Gestapo and make it home safely from the bar.   Turns out the pretext that 70% of the local DUI victims get pulled over for is swinging too wide while making a left hand turn onto Baseline, that is, not sticking to the innermost left hand lane.  So if you're leaving the bar, try to plan your exit so that you only make a right hand turn, and STAY IN YOUR LANE.   \n\nSO....now that I've gotten that of my chest, let's continue with the review, shall we?\n\nThe crowd is pretty much East Valley'ish if you know what I mean, most people were outside on one of the two patios enjoying the summer night.  Kinda dead tonight inside the main room, there is a another back room with a shuffle board and full bar separated by glass doors.   Granted it's quite a bit smaller than the main room indoors, although it always  seems to be a bit more crowded for its size than the rest of the bar.\n\nDoor cover was $5 and the two bands that I saw tonight were pretty decent.  The second one had good sound, was technically proficient, moved around, and the first thing I thought to myself was \"these guys must be heavily influenced by Incubus\".  This was confirmed later that night when they played a cover of Drive.   \n\nThe restrooms here are nice, better than the most I've been in lately, although they were out of paper towels.  Tons of parking available.  Decor in the bar is contemporary, although I'm not super big on the blood red walls that make the band/stage corner.  The ceiling is all exposed and painted black.  \n\nYou can usually catch what's going via the bar's myspace page.

We walked in and it felt like a big empty room... which it really was actually.  I'm not sure if it's a dance floor at night perhaps?  But it was just a strange feeling and layout. \n\nThe place was dead, I could count the number of people in there on 1 hand (granted it was like 5pm on a Thursday, but hello... happy hour anyone?) and it was also super quiet and awkward (hello, MUSIC anyone?).\n\nWe had one drink and left.

We saw the sign for Crabby Don's, thought it was funny and decided to give it a try.  At 11:30 a.m. on a Monday it was pretty slow, but the bartender was staying busy multi-tasking.  Looked like she was setting up glasses for both bars and attending to a couple of patrons who were sitting at the bar.  She still found time to be friendly and helpful with us and we did not feel neglected at all.  \n\nWe were thrilled to find $2 Rolling Rocks and then when I asked about food, I noticed they had Breckenridge Brewing SummerBright Ale on tap.  (I'm easily distracted when it comes to beer).  It's not often I see a BB beer here in this area, so we gave that a try.  Not too shabby.  Definitely a passable summer lager.  We didn't want a full meal so shared the sliders.  Very simple cheeseburger sliders, but they had a good grilled flavor and the buns had been grilled too which is a simple touch that I like a lot.  I also like that they give you 4 instead of 3, like a lot of places do.   4 is perfect for sharing with the one you love, or the one you want to love for that night.\n\nOverall it was a good dark cool divey place for a pit stop with a good drink selection.  The food prices aren't too bad either and it's the typical bar food menu.  I'm probably too old and square to enjoy the bands, etc. they get in there, but I would definitely stop in again if I'm out in the area.", "business_id": "xuEsUDFIWIEnBXvj1EBXlw", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-08-06", "type": "review"}

We had to correct him, and wait longer for our food because of it.

I'm giving them a firm 3.5 stars.\n\nI was really wowed by breakfast (working breakfast - always fun anyway). They make these amazing breakfast potatoes that, well ... Jim W and Abby W would have gone nuts over.\n\nThen came dinner with fellow Yelpers Marian and Kevin H. It was a really enjoyable dinner. Jim W and I split a burger and a chicken pizza. The company was terrific and the only dark spot on the evening was when the woman at the counter informed me that they don't make grilled onions for their burgers. I was really surprised by a place of this quality not offering cooked onions as a burger option.\n\nLast came my lunch meeting and the reason I've downgraded Liberty Market half a star. I was debating between the chicken sandwich and egg salad when I happened to notice that they offered caramelized onions on one of the sandwiches. Suddenly the burger appeared to be a viable option. Here's how that went:\n\nme: \"I'd like the tower burger - medium - with cheddar, bacon and caramelized onions.\"\n\nher: \"We don't have caramelized onions.\"\n\nme: \"They're on the menu for the rancher.\"\n\nher: \"That's at another counter.\"\n\nme: \"I beg your pardon?\"\n\nher: \"That's at a different counter.\" (this time with a bit of attitude)\n\n3rd employee at bar: (under her breath) \"We can do that.\"\n\nher: (after glare at 3rd employee) \"They'll be cold. They're for a cold sandwich.\"\n\n3rd employee at bar: (slightly louder this time) \"We can heat them up.\"\n\nWhen the burger arrived there were no onions to be seen. 3rd employee happened to be the one who brought the food and when I pointed that out to her the irritation was apparent. She looked at me, as sincerely as she could, and told me that she would have them heated and out to me as soon as possible.\n\nNow, I have to say that the tower burger is absolutely fantastic with caramelized onions and they should ALWAYS offer it that way. Once I had my burger the way I wanted it I really enjoyed the meal. But, seriously, it's at another counter?! I can't imagine anyone refusing to walk ten feet to make a customer happy.

I need to figure out how to make it so that I can take credit for it at thanksgiving dinner. with respect to liberty of course :)\n\nsecond- how the heck can i pick a favorite between balsamic drizzled bread with ripe, red tomatoes, tons of fresh basil, divine mozarella or the turkey with bleu cheese crumbles, granny apple slices, and candied pecans? both sandwiches were so amazing. my eating companion and i decided that the caprese sandwich was the winner. so amazing. but that doesn't discount how awesome the picnic is, because that is amazing in it's own right. \n\ni've already figured out my next trip. instead of ordering two entrees and switching halves with the other diner, we will order and split only one entree, one side and then we will have room for dessert. \n\nor i'll just go in and order a ton of desserts. whatever.", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-06-27", "type": "review"}

Here is what I have tried:\n\nSammiches:\nArizona Sky Pressed Sandwich - Really good\nCaprese - Love this sammich. The Balsamic makes it!\nMaiden Lane - Another fave next to the Caprese. \nPicnic - Good but needed more apple and carmelized pecans. Gorganzola was a bit overpowering\nFarmer - Probably my least favorite. Was good but the sweet potatoes needed to be cooked more (they were hard). The goat cheese was awesome on this sammich though\nLiberty grilled cheese with tomato - By far the best grilled cheese I have ever had\n\nSides:\nRoasted Sweet Potato salad - Different but very tasty\nGrilled vegi medley (special) - Really flavorful for being just vegetables\nCreamy Potato Salad - I didn't care for it. Its more of a dill potato salad. I prefer potato salads that have sweet pickle in them.\n\nDessert Case:\nBread Pudding - 2nd best bread pudding I have ever had. Charlestons has the best   :)\nBlueberry Scone - Not usually a fan of scones but this was really good and the home made whipped cream was wonderful\nSalt River bar - Was ok but I don't think I would get again. I thought it would be sweeter but it really wasn't. A little too salty in some area's\n\nAll in all, Liberty Market is pretty legit. I really like their sammiches and have never had anything like their roasted sweet potato salad. The atmosphere is really cute. The service can be a little slow at times but all the employees seem really friendly.", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-06-27", "type": "review"}

Service, food, decor all excellent.  Everyone else who is offering reviews is doing a nice job of talking about the food so I am going to mention a few different items of interest.  But about the food I will just quickly mention if you are having breakfast it may sound unusual but get the meatball as a side dish. It blew me away. \nNot only does Liberty market offer Gilbert residents quality food, they do it at a reasonable price.  For a long time the Johnson family has been giving away free meals once a year at their flagship restaurant Joe's BBQ, right across the street.  In keeping with that tradition of bringing residents together they are offering a \"Community Dinner\" at Liberty.  The concept being that 30 residents can sign up for a dinner consisting of 5 or more courses including a chef's surprise course.  All for one very affordable price. The community part is that they sit you at a table of 6 or so offering diners an opprutunity to get aquinted with thier neighbors.  The dinner is limited to just 30 people on a frist come, first serve basis. Wonderful idea.  Earlier I was bragging about how good the meatball's are. I understand they have a Meatball sandwich which is not on the menu. Also not on the menu is a breakfast burger which is only served on the week ends between 11 and 1.  Not only does this dish sound wonderful but a menu item that is only available 4 hours a week has a strong allure for me.  While I was leaving I was looking at the pictures on the wall and I noticed that the family was pictured outside of the famous Culinary Institute of America Greystone.   I noticed that my waiter was pictured and after tracking him down again I find out that he was a family member, Willie Johnson, how unpretentious.  So that explains some of the good food. They have a strong background.", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-07-03", "type": "review"}

The surprise star, though, was the humble biscuit. I'm very harsh on biscuits. They're always too dry, too tough, not crusty enough, or otherwise compromised in some way.

That little cup of goodness had escaped my radar but now I can't stop thinking about it.  So rich and lightly sweet with a nice foam.

I'm sure I've skimmed your edges, or skirted just around you many times in the past. Sometimes maybe even on purpose. Sorry. You've probably seen me drive by and thought - \"There goes that prick again. Who does he think he is?\" But you're miles away. We don't have any friends inside you. You lacked a compelling draw to pull us out of our mid-town cocoon. Until now. So I hope we can put the past behind us and shed our preconceptions about each other and just move on with our relationship. So...\n\nLIBERTY MARKET\nWhat a refreshing, rewarding surprise. A hip, family-friendly, easy-going place to get great food and beverages in a clean, clever setting. The website hinted at its authenticity, but how many times does that fail you??\n\nOn the street, it's a nifty setting that harkens back to an Americana that I grew up with in the midwest: water tower, mid-century neon diner signage, real brick, public sidewalks intended for human use, trees, etc. But the building itself is a clean juxtaposition of modern worked into a cool old (by PHX standards) building. Old brick meets steel beams and open space. Everything is functional, not just there to look cool. From the structurally relevant beams to the authentic wood-fired oven, it all serves a real purpose.\n\nWe (me, wife and 9mo old daughter) chose our seats at the pizza oven counter and clamped on our baby's magical floaty chair. We immediately struck up a rapport with James, at the oven, and learned that almost everyone we encountered, other than customers, were his family and friends. That's pretty cool. We've now been several times and the food has never let us down. In fact, we've been drawn back almost weekly on our little pilgrimage to keep exploring the menu. I don't see a James Beard award in the future, unless they give one for consistently delicious, honest comfort food. But we're all happy to drive out of our way for a visit that puts a smile on our faces every time.\n\nTHAT CHRISTIAN THING\nNow, to address something that really shouldn't matter, but often does to many people: \"The Christian Thing\". Due to the amount of interest in Agritopia and its \"Bible-based design\", I think most people know going in that this is a Joe Johnston place (Joe's Farm Grill, Real BBQ and now LM) and he's pretty open about his beliefs. I'm sure to the surprise of many who would avoid establishments that clearly identify as one religion or another, there is nothing in-your-face or proselytizing or patronizing about this place's pretty public Christian identity. If anything, the experience speaks volumes about the honesty of their description of their beliefs on the Liberty Market website. Yes, when you know about it going into it, you feel the presence of their faith. But all in a good way.\n\nI almost feel like bringing this aspect of it up was unnecessary, but at the same time, I think it needed to be brought up; simply because of how many people I've talked to who immediately jumped on that angle - \"oh, the Bible Thumper enclave in Gilbert\", or \"sounds kinda Stepford-ish\", etc. If you just wandered in without any background info I think your takeaway would just be - \"Now that was a friendly group of people and a great meal.\"\n\nOh, and check out the bathrooms. It's fun.\n\n\nSo for what it is: friendly, sincere, fresh, honest, well-thought out, comfy, delicious, consistent, complete and did I mention friendly? - 5 stars.", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-07-29", "type": "review"}

I've been here several times for breakfast and lunch, and have never been disappointed. They have the BEST eggs!  I also love the layout and of course, the free wifi. August is their \"Burger Daze\", a different burger every day for the entire month. Today's burger was the wasabi burger, and being a fan of foods with kick, I was thinking about this burger since yesterday. It almost makes me cry to say I was underwhelmed by it. It was a burger with a creamy horseradishy sauce on it, and you got a little wasabi flavor, but it lacked that kick you get from eating wasabi. It also had an Asian salad mixture on the burger as well. Don't get me wrong, it was tasty, but when I think that I paid $11 for that and a side of potato chips, I feel a little slighted. If you eat ten of their burgers over the course of the month you can get a $25 gift card (save your receipts). The burger just wasn't good enough to get me to come back 9 more times this month.  \n\nI'll definitely return to Liberty Market again- as I said I do love the restaurant and would recommend it to anyone looking for a place to eat.

But please do not be misled by the name in thinking that this is anything of a market.  I'd question whether the owners really know what they want it to be, which is a common complaint from me when visiting these upscale \"market\" cafes.  But so be it.... here's my take on the experience:\n\nVisit #1: Morning coffee meeting before heading into the office.  I was thrilled by the way the owners have renovated this old space.  Furthermore, it was a quick and comfortable experience for my morning coffee needs.  Coffee was pretty good too.\n\nVisit #2: Lunch meeting with colleagues.  There were six of us, which posed a seating challenge in the busy restaurant at first, but then an employee/manager noticed us and helped out.  I ordered the Arizona Sky, which was a tasty ham sandwich, and enjoyed a wonderful sweet potato salad on the side.  The sandwich, with a cup of coffee, was roughly $9 if memory serves correctly.  While quite tasty, I hope the lunch prices come down as more worthy competition enters the market.  So, overall, great place for an occasional change of pace, but not something I'd do frequently. \n\nVisit #3: Another coffee meeting.  This time, I was feeling a little like having a snack, so I thought it was great that we were in a \"market.\"  And this is when I remembered that this place is not really a market at all.  Yes, that's what I thought was off about this place -- I knew something wasn't clicking for me.\n\nSo in summary, I'd say that this is a nice little breakfast/lunch restaurant, but not quite what I wanted it to be based on its name or history.  And hey, yet another interesting take on the classic casual cafe/diner vibe will only help this genre of restaurant move forward in Arizona, so I'll keep tabs and look forward to trying it again.", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-08-15", "type": "review"}

But, today changed everything.  I was completely disappointed and shocked with the customer service today.  I walked in with 4 of my girlfriends to have brunch and meet about an event we are planning.  We were immediatley met by the chef's wife, who quickly told us that we would have to sit at the high top bar due to the fact that they are trying to save their regular tables for people eating.  I explained to her that we would like a table because we wanted backs on our seats.  She told us that we needed to wait for two ladies by the window to leave (who were already done with their meal) and she would push two tables together and allow us to sit there, but we needed to wait at the bar until then.  We ordered our food and sat at the bar. There were several 4 top tables and I asked if two could be pushed together so we could sit there.  She told us no.  I explained that I was a paying customer and frustrated and irritated that we could not have an open table.  She explained that this is how they run things...that they want you to eat and get out and since we were meeting she couldn't let us sit longer than an hour.  I was in utter shock over this.  Have you ever heard of a place saying that to a paying customer.  For the record, we had spent $66 on our brunch.  I asked if we had not had binders with us if she would let us sit there and she said yes!  I told her how uncomfortable it was sitting at the bar so she agreed to push the tables together and let us have the tables, but only for one hour.  We ate our breakfast (which was delicious) and believe it or not, at an hour, she came and told us she needed our table.  Again, shocking!  Also, the table that she orginally promised us still, after an hour and ten minutes, had the same two ladies at it chatting!  \nI am sad about this situation as this is a place I frequent 5-6 times a month.

When you walk in you think that there are available tables, but then someone comes over to you and lets you know that she is \"seating the table right now\", and you can order and she will find you a place to sit. That's fine, but a sign near the door stating, \"please wait to be seated\" would solve about 99% of the \"hostess\" running around and rearranging people, and 100% of the confusion for first time visitors. They would almost serve themselves better by letting people seat themselves....It was stressful enough to watch the poor girl run around trying to seat people. \n\nOn that note, I saw her let people sit down until she had to seat a party, then she made them get up and stand, which I thought was incredibly rude. She also seated my party of two, and after we sat down, SHE MOVED US! To a smaller table. Fine, we are only a party of two, but once you make up your mind on where you are going to seat a party, keep it, its rude to make them move after they have been seated. \n\nWe ordered our food, I got the Chorizo Quesadilla...good, but nothing great that I couldn't get at other establishments. We even commented to each other how the food should be outstanding...it must be for us to want come back, but again, it was nothing to rave about. \n\nThe food took a long time, and the place is LOUD. The busers are around in flurries setting up and taking down tables, but it's beyond impossible to flag one down to get a box for your food at the end of the meal. \n\nWe left more stressed out then full in our bellies. Granted we visited on a busy Sunday morning, but customer service should always be a companies top priority, here it wasn't. I felt like we got nothing but a stressful expensive meal instead. I rated Liberty Market \"fairly\" at one star, because like the rating says, I think not. I would not visit again, nor would I recommend to my family or friends.", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-08-22", "type": "review"}

Then I came back for lunch a week later, and decided to never leave again.  Having frequented Liberty Market now probably, ohhh...10+ times - always on weekends and always for breakfast/lunch, I'm dubbing it my go-to weekend meal.  I'm not normally a breakfast person, but this place has changed my mind many times over, especially when it comes to flavor, plus they've got something for everyone.  \n\nThere is almost always a constant line that can easily be 15-30 people deep at any given time, but it moves steadily and you never really feel like you're waiting and there's always a seat ready for you by the time you order.  Depending on when you walk in, menus are available for breakfast, lunch or dinner (or both breakfast and lunch if you come in on the weekend between 10am and 1pm) and you can peruse the menu at your leisure while you wait to shuffle up to the register to order.  As you amble through the line, you snake along a tall cooler full of beverages from cans of limonata and bottles of exotic juices and sodas to cans and bottles of craft beer (including some local).  Further along the line you'll pass the pizza making station, where you can watch the cooks toss dough and unique toppings around before gently thrusting a fresh-made pizza into the brick oven (you could even watch it bake if you aren't in a rush...or hungry).  Right after the pizzas, the sides/appetizers and desserts taunt you from a cooler covered with glass that seems to sparkle thanks to all the delicious treats inside.  Just before you can take a look, someone will come up to you and give you a number while pointing out your table for you.  Then you can admire the caprese pasta salad, roasted sweet potato salad, corn-tomato-and-bean salad, hummus, fresh fruit and vegetables of the day, zebra brownies, carrot cake, bread pudding, red velvet cake, ice cream cookie sandwiches, and a cupcake of the day.  When you finally get to the register to order, food is the first thing on your mind and you can't wait to try everything.\n\nAlso, if you're looking for some caffeine...order the cortadito.  Just do it.\n\nI could go on and on, but basically, the food is delicious and the wait times are manageable (the food arrives within 10-15 minutes after you sit down, if that).  It's not too fancy and it's definitely not plain, and yet it still avoids being pretentious while staying in the \"just right\" zone.  I'm not sure if that makes sense, but it's accurate.  \n\nQuick tip: they do not have a mist system outside, so they don't normally sit people on the patio in the summer, but it's well-shaded, so if you have a dog with you or just want to be away from everyone inside, they will sit you out there, you just have to ask.", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-07-14", "type": "review"}

First, big props to Mr. Johnston for renovating an old (for Gilbert) buidling instead of doing a tear-down which is more common in the Valley. My architect cousin was seriously impressed with the structure. I remember Liberty Market when it was a ghetto liquor store that sold some decent chorizo. It's wonderful to have this space turned into a great restaurant where you can meet up with friends for breakfast, lunch or dinner.\n\nBreakfast is yummy. I always get the veggie scramble being a vegetarian. It's loaded with goat cheese so what's not to love? Biscuits, cinnamon buns, and sticky buns are fantastic.\n\nFor lunch and dinner, I stick with the caprese salad or sandwich. Their thin crust pizza is very good, but the caprese is exceptional so it's hard to venture from it. I've had this dish all over town and while some places may have better bread (pane bianco), the actual fillings are so much better at Liberty Market. The other item I have a hard time straying from is the sweet potato salad. It's unreal! No mayo here, instead it's tossed with chipotle (i think) flavored oil, craisins, and pecans. On a side note, I would love it if Liberty would over some veggie meat option a la Capriotti's so that I could try their other sandwiches.\n\nDesserts all kick ass. I've had the red velvet and carrot cakes here, both some of the best I've had. If you're only going to get one dessert, make it the bread pudding. A friend of mine who lived in France for two years said it was the best in the world. It totally is! It's a great value two considering you can share it among 3+ adults.\n\nIf you come here for nothing else, you must have some coffee. As a coffee drinker, it would be an abomination for me to visit Liberty and not get something from the E61 bar. The last time I went I got an iced latte, and I was actually mad because it was *so* good.

The pancake was delish-- super light and fluffy but the eggs and sausage were kind of lacking in flavor. Same went for my date's, though he said the biscuit was the best he's ever had and I'd have to agree. All this, plus their yummy display of desserts by the order counter, leads me to believe that Liberty Market knows how to bake but needs to add a bit of spice to its cooking. If I ever find myself in the boonies again, I would hit this place up (if only because there's not a whole lot of other options.)", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-08-08", "type": "review"}

Yes, I know, there are already 250+ Reviews, what more could I add? Don't worry, I'll stick to the facts; consider this the cliff-notes version.\n\nTake the first parking spot you can find or drive the the lot west of the building. Walk in, grab a menu, and get in line.  With all of the goodness on the menu, try to make your decision before you get to the register.  \n\nA few of my favorites\n1. CORTADITO - coffee drinkers, do NOT miss this one!  Cuban miro-latte, on the sweeter side, served in a pair of espresso shots or a bowl, perfection!\n2. Rancher Salad - steak, caramelized onions, blue cheese, arugula, do I have to keep going?\n3. Sweet Potato Salad - a unique salad, SO much better than your average potato salad\n4. Cinnamon Rolls the size of a human face, if you're into to that kind of thing, share with a friend, or four.\nthere are more, but I promised to keep it short.\n\nBack to the line. As you're making up your mind, be ready to answer the number of people in your party so they can set you up with a table.  Try to resist the incredible looking, super-sized pastries and desserts in the case, or not, what the heck, just get it!.  Pay the friendly cashier, proceed to the fountain drink station to fill your glasses, and maneuver the maze of tables to find the one with your number.\n\nJust a few tips.  One, it can get a little noisy in there, so may not be the best place if you're planning a discussion over your meal. Two, LM gets busy and the staff is always trying to find a table for the guests in line by the time they finish at the register.  So, while the dining room attendants are friendly and attentive, they are definitely trying to turn the table as soon as you'll let them.\n\nAnd now you know what to expect.  If you don't like lines or loud places, this might not be your favorite place. Overall, delicious, fresh food and shinny, happy people to bring it to you.  Let's just say LM is enough to get me out of my five mile Ahwatukee radius, and that is hard to do! Now you know the scoop . . . I'm out!

Cheese, good.  Tomato, good.  Basil, good.   Bread, not good.  For whatever reason they toasted the bread to the point of it being a crouton.  Really??  It was supposed to be a panini type sandwich, but it comes out like a crouton??  For all the hype behind this place you'd think they could toast a piece of bread.  I mean I can and I don't even run a restaurant.\n\nOk, on to the liberty sandwich, which is actually a turkey sandwich with green apples, candied walnuts, bleu cheese and red pepper aioli.  Good news, they didn't toast the bread so it actually came out pretty good.  Turkey was good.  As for the combination of all the ingredients...not so much.  I get someone sat down and put this all together and somewhere along the line thought it was a good idea but in reality, too many competing textures, too many competing flavors.\n\nBoth sandwiches came with potato salad...not bad...but I didn't come here to eat potato salad.\n\nNow having said the above, the place was as busy as a Greyhound bus terminal (lunch time).

The pizzas are great (and the perfect size for 1 while still sharing a slice), the burgers fantastic (be on the lookout for their burger of the week - always especially good), and their breakfast is wonderful. I'm usually here for breakfast, my favorite dish being the western scramble. (if you like horseradish.. just trust me on this. Don't even bother looking at the rest of the menu.)\n\nCouple of things that i think sets this place apart; you can tell they use fresh ingredients and cook from scratch. Their breakfast potatoes are more than just plain diced, unseasoned squares, and the fresh, always soft-&-warm biscuit they serve with most of their (breakfast) entrees. Also, the staff is always amazingly friendly.\n\nI wasn't a big fan initially of their style of  \"order at the counter and find a seat,\" but they do a good job of finding & having a table ready for you by the time you get your order in, and I don't mind getting up to get my own coffee / water / iced tea. Just be aware if it's you're first time in. It can be confusing to the uninitiated. (I came here the first time with my parents and grandparents... and my grandparents were completely confused as to how the system worked. And I wasn't too sure either) Also, if you walk in with just 1 or 2 of you, there's often room at the coffee bar, and you can sit over there, skip the line, and order from the barista.\n\none last tidbit; their espresso is pretty great. Ordered a vanilla latte with breakfast the last time i was in, and it was fantastic.

It's my favorite type of food and I can eat it anytime of day. \n\nMy husband and I were headed to the Gilbert Farmer's Market and needed food. We walked in, grabbed a menu and the minute I saw Buttermilk Pancakes with Chopped Bacon I was sold. There is seating inside and outside; when they're busy they go through the line and assign you a table number based on the size of your group. This makes things move smoothly unless you're rude and decide that your assigned table isn't good enough for you. Yes, people really do that.\n\nThere are several things that make these pancakes amazing. When they're on the griddle they sprinkle cooked, chopped bacon on the wet side, flip it and serve. It's genius. Then they put a wrapped butter pad on each pancake. This is awesome, because the butter starts to melt. There is nothing worse than rock hard, cold butter that tears apart your pancakes as you try to spread it. It comes with a side of syrup that is good, but doesn't overpower the flavor of the pancake itself. \n\nThey carry Revolution Tea which makes my hubby very happy. Their French Press of Stump Town Coffee is very tasty, but their latte tasted way too burnt and just wasn't enjoyable. \n\nAt some point, I will venture out and try one of their amazing burgers or pizzas which all look amazing.

In general we have found the food to be good, though at times inconsistent and unexceptional, but acceptable when in the area (not a destination eatery we'd drive to otherwise). Unfortunately, the service is uninspired or totally lacking. It galls me when a place charges the same (or higher) prices than other establishments that offer full table service and comparable (or superior) food.\n\nA recent visit there will be our last. The evening we went there were 4 of us who were meeting to discuss planning of an upcoming old town event and we wanted a quiet place to converse over wine and food. This time the service was not only uninspired but downright rude.\n\nWhen 3 of our party attempted to sit at larger table with chairs for six (allowing us to more easily view our materials), one of the staff said \"you can't sit there because it's ONLY for parties of six.\" He subsequently pointed to a small 4-top and said \"sit over there\". In many restaurants the 4-top he pointed out would have been a 2-top, so our casual planning session was cramped and uncomfortable.\n\nTo emphasize my point even further, the place was less than 1/3 full and it was near closing... in fact the 4th of our party, a business owner from across the street, arrived only a about 15 minutes before the manager locked the door. \n\nInstead of building customer good will and making us feel welcome, this staffer decided to convenience himself and inconvenience us.\n\nJoe's BBQ across the street definitely projects a feeling of appreciation for their patrons, but the management team at this restaurant where Joe is a partner, is worlds apart when it comes to \"community\".\n\nWe really wanted to like this place and have been going there since they first opened in 2009, but after this last encounter we will NEVER return as there are dozens of establishments in the area that make you feel welcome and appreciated, as well as offering comparable or superior food with the added benefit of full table service.", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-08-19", "type": "review"}

It was a acid bomb; orange marmalade and lemon up front.  As it cooled, a semi sweet chocolate rounded the predominate citrus notes, leaving a long finish.  My only complaint is the espresso was too hot.  As a barista I struggle with this as well.  And maybe I'm just sensitive to this because I really dislike drinks that burn the tongue.  To the barista's credit,  he tried to combat this by flushing the group head for longer than I have ever seen anyone do,  rarely half a minute.

Only having lived in the Gilbert area for about 9 years, I have been able to see much of the old town grow into a more upscale, urban vibe to it that sort of meshes well with the dusty, tumbleweed blowing across the street scene that it is.  Confusing and sort of awesome all in one, the little old street in Gilbert has become a place of choice not only for me, but throngs of east valley residents as well.  There are too many good places to eat in this area and this is a good problem.  \nThe review:\nLiberty has been a place I have been ordering take-out from for over two years now and my actual dine-in experience has been minimal. Parking is reasonable though can at times be difficult with Postino's, Joe's, and Oregano's all smashed together.  Phone-in orders are always courteous, almost always fully accurate with special order types, and the wait has never been prolonged.  The restaurant is clean and just fun to look at.  \nFood is delicious.  I have not sampled the entire menu but it is varied and well thought out.  Pricey?  Maybe.  I have learned that more imaginative and fresh food equals a more premium price and for the most part, I accept this.  \nAs a creature of habit, I can speak on the salmon blt with authority; never fishy, good char on the bun, bacon is always delicious, tomatoes are thick and red.  Sandwiches are clever with designer cheese and excellent breads.  Homemade kettle-styled chips = yum!  \nBreakfast is also varied and delicious.  \nCoffee bar:  This is my favorite region of  Liberty.  I have shed the Starbucks addiction and moved to more local coffee houses that can replicate a good cappuccino.  Liberty can do this to my satisfaction.  The baristas are knowledgeable and friendly.  They will remember your order and chat with you if not too busy.  Adult coffee drinks?  Sign me up.  \nI love this place.  I want to move in to this place.  I dislike people.  Herein lies the problem.  The times I can visit are always peak when there are throngs of \nobnoxious humans and the acoustics are terrible.  Navigating the Yukon models of strollers to a table is an exercise in patience and contortion; space between tables is at a premium.  \nIs this a place to quietly work on your laptop with a cup of coffee? Depends on the time.  Is this a place to get an excellent coffee drink?  Yes.  Food is delicious and the atmosphere is engaging.  \nPros:  Food and coffee drinks; decor and yes, bathrooms have character.\nCons:  (Peak hours) Parking, too much humanity in one establishment, acoustics.  \n  \nThe Joe's chain has another winner.", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-08-05", "type": "review"}

I've been here many times, with both family and friends. I love the look and feel of the restaurant, from the open kitchen to the coffee bar. And the food is always fantastic.

The other day I tried the pasta bowl for the first time and I might start ordering that from now on. Everything is super fresh.

We showed up a little later than the rest of our party, who had already grabbed a table. When we got there, there was a long line and we were afraid that the others in our party would have to wait awhile for us to eat our meal. Well, there was no worries to be had, as one of the staff asked if the rest of our party was already seated, we said \"yes\" and she then brought us over to the coffee bar to order our meal, so our whole party could get their food at the same time. \n\nMy friend and I split the Italia salad, white pizza, and red velvet cake. The italia salad was very flavorful with high quality salami, artichokes, chick peas, basil and a tasty lemon vinaigrette. The white pizza was very good, the cream sauce, bacon and pine nuts were a very good combo. The red velvet cake was moist and the cream cheese frosting was delicious, very similar to La Grande Orange's. \n\nI recommend Liberty Market as their food, quality, and customer service were very good.

Went there on a Saturday for lunch and expected it to be busy - it was, but no problem. Greeter was pleasant and immediately handed us menus and explained how the system worked (read menu while in line, order at end, take number and find table). The nice thing about waiting in line is that you watch the meals being made! I also watched a cook dump someone's plated lasagna on the floor - clearly a new cook. I ordered the Cuban sandwich with the side of roasted sweet potato salad, my lunch-buddy ordered the burger of the day, the bison burger, with chips. The food arrived pretty quickly considering the crowd (a very noisy crowd...but again, to be expected at lunch on Saturday), and nice and hot. But...the Cuban sandwich had absolutely no flavor. It was dry and I wouldn't have known it was supposed to be a Cuban. The roasted sweet potato salad was mushy and congealed  in goo - I took 1 bite and offered it to my lunch-buddy in case I was being overly picky. He made such a face, I know it wasn't just me. Since we split the Cuban and burger, I asked his take on the Cuban. He took a bite and dumped the rest. The bison burger, luckily, was great. The chips with the burger were standard out-of-the-bag chips. Three sauces were served with the burger - a bottled ketchup, a bizarre canned pineapple sauce(?!), and a tasteless orange mayonnaise that I think was supposed to be \"spicey aioli.\" I've heard such good things about Liberty Market that this was a real disappointment - most of the food we tried was dismal.

Here are all things worth noting, for those of you taking notes. (For those of you not taking notes, I can just text you):\n\n1) The ordering system is similar to a Corner Bakery, in that, you pay first then take a number, then they bring food to your table. What is nice/different, though, is that you get a hard menu to hold in line, instead of having to look up at a board behind the counter. This allows The Indecisive some intimate time alone to analyze and dissect each and every option without the board making their glances feel like they've overstayed their welcome.\n2) It's a better value than Panera, who's been sneaking up their prices and making my wallet whine. Places like Liberty Market are fighting back, so one day our kids will say, \"Panwhera?\" #forced\n3) I ordered the Farmer sandwich and a side of Hummus. It should be in the Constitution that hummus should always be served with soft bread, never hard toasty toast. (Note for next time, folks, especially if you want it changed to \"Life, Liberty MARKET, and the Pursuit of Happiness\"). \nThe Farmer sandwich was not as hot as it could've been, probably because of the waiter's poor pickup timing from the kitchen....\n...but how long could I stay mad at the waiter when, 4) he gave me free coffee? Or maybe he just gifted the coffee because I looked like I had to poop and he was just trying to push me over the edge...\n5) They REALLY won my heart, though, by playing my favorite Oasis song, \"Don't Look Back in Anger.\" It was as if they were spoonfeeding me through my ears.", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-06-03", "type": "review"}

We still need to go there!!  I happened to be off from work one day and we were both up early.  And hungry.  I suggested we go somewhere for breakfast.  Being from California, I remember cinnamon rolls were a big deal, and they seem all that impressive anywhere I've been in AZ.  I did some searches on Yelp and then I just switched it to breakfast, and Liberty Market popped up!  OH SNAP!  The place was busy enough with a long line, but nothing obnoxious and definitely worth the 9 minutes we were in line.  He ordered the breakfast sandwich, I the breakfast quesadilla with chicken, a pitcher of sangria, and a piece of carrot cake to go.  It wasn't cheap.  Tip and all it came out to sixty bucks, but the sangria itself was about 25 - be ready to drop some coin, but don't worry, the place will earn it fa sho!  There was one particular employee who I think was a manager that was better suited for a non customer contact position, like data processing - or worker at DMV.  We didn't let her spoil the morning.  I may have mentioned it on FourSquare and Twitter, but made it clear we were LOVING the experience.  They tweeted back before we even left saying thanks for coming in!  The portions were plenty.  Especially my quesadilla.  It was SO big and SO full I chose to take the other half home so I could tear into it while no one was watching at home. HA!  The carrot cake...  how my hunt went from cinnamon rolls to ending up with a carrot cake, I don't know, but aw lawd it was to die for!  If anything of the desserts or salads on display at Liberty Market are from Cisco, I'd be shocked.  Oh, except for the mixed fruit salad... that looked like it was straight out of a can of Dole.  I can't wait for our next visit.  We left satisfied, not STUFFED, and the whole experience, and sangria, put us in a great mood for the rest of the day.  I recommend this place for coworkers, friends, or even for a fun date before heading to a movie or Golf Land.", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-07-30", "type": "review"}

I was pleasantly surprised when I saw the variety of choices, particularly the delicious-looking pastries, side salads, and desserts, and tasted the food. There are a number of things that looked great, and I could only try so many things on my first visit, so I'll likely be coming back for more.\n\nYou order up at the cashier, and they bring your food to your table. The cashier was very helpful in figuring out exactly what was in a couple of the dishes that piqued my curiosity. There was a guy helping out with seating while we stood in line, so there was no question as to whether there was a table at which to sit after ordering food.\n\nI ended up ordering the Chopped entree salad, which consists of kale, cabbage, grilled chicken, dried apricots, pumpkin seed brittle (I'm coming back to this), jicama, a couple of other ingredients, and a honey serrano vinaigrette. Everything on the salad was nice and fresh. I wouldn't have minded some more chicken in the salad, but what was in there was tasty. I ordered this in large part because of the dried apricots and kale, but when I got it and started eating, I quickly realized that the stars of the show are the pumpkin seed brittle and the honey serrano vinaigrette. The vinaigrette has a lovely flavor to it, and the spiciness adds a perfect level of heat to every bite of the salad. I'll admit that I'm a bit of a pepper belly and I love spiciness in practically everything, but this is really well executed. And every time I got a little chunk of that brittle, I got a little smile on my face. So good!\n\nI also had a side of the sweet potato salad. I saw sweet potatoes and cranberries and knew I had to have some. It was a solid addition to my meal. I just realized that the cup is only $1 more than the side portion--I'll have to remember that next time, because the side portion was a tad small for my likings.\n\nMy friend shared her Best Chicken sandwich and rice pudding with me. The chicken sandwich, though maybe not the \"best ever\" as the person delivering it claimed, was certainly good. The chicken was juicy and tender, the avocado spread and chipotle vinaigrette added some nice flavor, and the sesame bun added some great crunchy texture and flavor. The tomatoes were pretty flavorless, and I am never a fan of iceberg lettuce. But it was definitely a solid sandwich! And the rice pudding was excellent. It reminded me of the arroz con leche my dad always made for us when I was a kid, and I had to hold back from eating a ton of it.\n\nI saw other people's orders and thought that the pizzas looked great. The pastries and desserts all look excellent--I imagine that this place would be worth visiting just for those items. And brunch--I'm game.\n\nI'm a fan.

We stood in line approximately 15 minutes (at 11am on a Sunday) before placing our order and being seated. While waiting to place your order you are forced to walk past the pastry case, filled with delectable treats such as French macaroons, sweet potato muffins, and the largest cinnamon rolls you will ever lay eyes on. Of course we had to try several items: the honey lavender macaroon and the sticky bun. The macaroon had a nice light flavor, definitely an enjoyable small treat. The sticky bun was massive, enough for several people to share. \nFor entrees I had the green chile pork scramble, my mother had the bread pudding, and my boyfriend had the lox and bagel. All 3 were delicious with the only complaint being that the bagel was a little on the tough side. \nCan't wait to go back and try some other items.", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-06-14", "type": "review"}

It was a bust. Hard little green peaches and some very sad captive animals were detractors from the pleasant scenery. \n\nSince we had driven all the way to the other side of the valley, we decided to look around. We stopped by the Queen Creek Olive Mill and picked up some nice olive oil and fig balsamic vinegar. Seeing a sign for the Pork Shop, we drove a few miles further down the road. \n\nWe bought a several items including Fat Tire Beer brats, pepper cured bacon and some breakfast sausage. We also indulged in a couple of hot burritos they sell there out of a little warming cabinet behind the counter. The burritos were very distinctive, smokey and juicy. \n\nWe ate the brats right away. They were definitely some of the better brats we've gotten in AZ. The seasoning was just right. \n\nNow, for the big deal... I just made the pepper cured bacon today. Hands down, the best bacon I've ever had. It was very tender, had the slight bite of cracked black pepper balanced by a very subtle sweetness.

I just had to write a review, because I am so thankful that a place like this still exists on the outskirts of Phoenix.\n\nThe family run farm is fun and relaxing, especially on a nice sunny day. They have a Country Store stocked full of delicious butters, oils and preserves made from the farm's produce. Not to mention, you can take a hay ride out to their orchards to pick various types of organic fruits when in season. And even though it is intended for children, they have an amusing little petting zoo where many of my adult friends have enjoyed getting up close and personal with the farm animals! \n\nOne thing that I have noticed in visiting the farm and engaging in their social networks online is that the family owners are the ones who actually run the place. Imagine my surprise when I got in line to order pancakes at the peach festival to find that Carrie Schnepf herself was making them over the grill! This kind of personal involvement really makes Schnepf Farms something special.\n\nOverall, Schnepf Farms seems to be doing everything right when it comes to running a small family business that actually does significantly benefit the community around it. I can only hope that they will continue to grow in the direction of their goals, which are humbly acknowledged on their website.\n\nMy only recommendation to them would be to encourage the development of their online presence, which has the potential to generate more visits to the farm. The family does a great job of updating their Facebook and Twitter profiles, but seem to be in need of some help when it comes to turning their website into a central hub of information that is easily accessible. While there seems to be a lot of great content on the website, it is very difficult to navigate through. This is the only reason I give them four stars out of five.\n\nI look forward to visiting more often throughout the year to experience the farm in all seasons.

The train was running, which is just a slow train that meanders around the property. Relaxing for adults and thrilling for dogs (which they are more than happy to allow on). Bathrooms aren't nice but they are functional. There are a lot of cute little places to eat, and places for kids/dogs to play. As a working farm, it was a little unclear where we were supposed to and not supposed to go, or even when it closed, but the flip side to that is how relaxed the place was, no one was rushing us out the 'door'. \n\nI mainly liked it because they welcome leashed dogs year round, it's free to go, and it was something different to do. But if you go kinda off season like we did, you gotta be in the mood to entertain yourself.", "business_id": "1V8f3A7p3HV2r0BgAbqvaw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-06-06", "type": "review"}

Everything was super full of people but the lines moved fast which was awesome. Not a lot of directions unfortunately but when we started to ask questions people were very nice and helpful. We enjoyed the tractor ride out to pick the peaches and our daughter enjoyed picking the peaches which was fun. We came back and hung out in the shade and had italian ices to cool off. We bought a lot of peaches way more than I thought we would and we went home with a pie which was heavenly! Totally want to go back next year!

I started going 4 years ago and have made a point to go back every year. The Peach Festival is okay. I personally like to go on days that the Peach Festival is not going on as it's really busy and it's not as much fun to pick peaches. If you go when their festival is not going on you can drive your car up to where the peach orchards begin and literally walk 10 feet and your at your first peach tree. Otherwise, if you go during the festival you have to park at the front of the property and carry the pounds of peaches you just picked a mile back to your car in the heat...

The farm was big & the festival was well done. There was a roller coaster & some other rides along with a huge trampoline & a rock climbing wall, all for free. Additionally, there were small booths for food (all over priced) & small activity booths such as pumpkin painting. There were some pig races & a dog show which was kind of fun! My favorite part was the small wagon that took us to their corn maze. It was nice to be away from the city & enjoy the time with loved ones.

I think this is Carrie Schnepf since she was the one I saw on the news. I was standing over by the refrigerator where the water bottles are kept looking for a sign posted stating the price of a water bottle. I had made brief eye contact with her and she screamed, \"What??!\" and threw her hands up in the air obviously annoyed by my very presence. I was so appalled and just responded with asking how much the water was. Then she screamed \"$2.00!!\". \n\nMaybe she is a nice person, I don't know but I do know that is no way to treat a customer that contributes to keeping your business alive. A little kindness and courtesy is all I'm asking for - especially from the owner and especially after paying $12.00 for pancakes I could have made better myself.\n\nOther than that it was a pretty fun day. I do think the farm could use some overall clean up. There were just random objects laying around every where that didn't appear to have much purpose.
