The staff was extremely considerate when my cat passed--some who knew him were even crying.\n\nMy other cat gained a reputation as a menace.  But the staff never complained--not even when she required four people to hold her down just to get her shots.\n\nWhen I was sold a diseased turtle a a child, Dr. Moore was very kind and did not charge for the visit nor the medication.  He recognized my interest in science and patiently answered all of my 11-year-old questions.  He even showed me how he made slides and how his microscope worked. (I later studied biology and worked as a lab tech, so thanks.)  Dr. Moore also took exemplary care of our rabbits, who all lived unusually long lives.\n\nOn a practical note, they require ALL animals to be in a cage or on a leash.  I once had a well-behaved cat, who was too sick to chase the dogs, wrapped in a blanket since his collar would have been over an open wound...But they generally enforce the cage/leash policy for the safety of all animals.

Not to mention you'll be right on top of people browsing through the kitchen section.\n\nA lady I was chatting with told me that she has seen women come in wearing tight fitting shirts/tank tops and spandex tights (hey, those are somehow socially acceptable as pants in public now, anyway!) so they are able to easily try everything on over their clothing (still weird).\n\nAs annoyed as I was about the fitting room situation, I will probably make a trip out there again in the future to browse based solely on the size of the store.

Getting out is a bear if you're heading back towards the city, like I usually am, because to pull up to the traffic light you have to go the wrong way through the very narrow parking area in front of the store.

They are always ready to help.  There are a couple of times when it was just a tiny problem with my car, they fixed my car without charging me, and even refused to take my tip.  They always explained to me what problem my car had, gave me recommendations, and found the least costly way to fix it.

Things turned around for me once I got a car (or made friends with cars), but I was seriously hurting for a while.\n\nTasty was one of the places we found. Back in the day, it was owned and ran by a typical restaurant-owning Chinese family. They had the works - pushy lao ban niang (boss lady), chef slash dad, and, during school off-hours, junior high school daughter manning the cashier. If they were in NYC, they'd only be missing an ami.... a bus boy. The food was pretty good, and if you order in Chinese, the lao ban niang hooked you up with extras because \"your parents teach you good to talk Chineees\". \n\nI'm pretty sure Tasty is under new ownership now. The food isn't as good as it was, but the restaurant still gives off the home-style look and feel. It's a small restaurant with enough seating for about 25-30 patrons. Cheap tables, cheap seats; after all, restaurant extras are just a waste of money. The customers should come back for the food, this *is* a restaurant.\n\nThe new waitress is not friendly, but she gets the job done. The food is still good - so if you're craving a home cooked meal, you'll be somewhat satisfied here. Don't expect grandma's cooking, though. Order the vegetables, the mapo tofu is good, beef/chicken chow fun, etc. They have a lot of other staple items on the menu too. Don't get the salted pork chops - save that craving for Orient Kitchen. Try things, and share your thoughts.\n\nTasty - it's more than your neighborhood take out joint.\n\n- written by a former junior high school daughter cashier", "business_id": "Y2p07YEC8xOsYTHWf0UxiA", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-10-13", "type": "review"}

And they will arrange the tables nicely, and cover them up with some festive table cloth.

I was only there about 10-15 minutes and got sent on my way.\n\nA few days after that (Monday), I took my car in for the repair. It did take a couple days longer than they said, which is really the only negative thing I can say about Mike's, but considering I didn't have to pay for the rental car, it wasn't a huge deal. When I did get my car back (Thursday), like others have said, it was in even better condition than when I took it in (besides the dent, of course)! They had cleaned/waxed the outside, and even cleaned and detailed the inside! If they just did detailing, I would take my Impreza there every time!

While I realize it's more popular to back the more selective (aka \"no-kill\") shelters around Pittsburgh, the \"open door\" policy places the ARL at the top of my list. Where the so-called no-kill shelters can afford to be choosy and accept all-star pets, the ARL will accept any pet, from a private owner, someone who finds a stray, or even the city's animal control. A small, over-extended staff collaborates with a dedicated troop of volunteers, and manages to adopt thousands and thousands of pets each year into family homes. \n\nI have adopted two cats from this shelter, and also participated in the adoption of several friends' pets here, too. The paid staff can be spread a little thin, especially if you come on a Friday afternoon/evening, or a weekend morning. Guess what, lots of people want to adopt a pet on the weekend when they have extra time to help it settle in. So don't be surprised to find crowds of potential adopters and exhausted staff!!! For a quieter experience, try a weekday. For the most intimate pet-finding experience, go during a Steelers game. Seriously, you will have the place to yourself. \n\nIs it sacrilegious to tell you to do anything during a Steelers game? Whoops. \n\nThe ARL lists some of their pets on Petfinder, but I have found that the selection on the adoption floor is often too vast & quick moving for them to keep the profiles online updated -- what I'm trying to get at is this: Don't get super attached to a pet online, because there's a reasonable chance it already has a home. And don't avoid a trip because you don't see anyone you like online. There are more future fur-friends waiting for you at the shelter. \n\nThe staff of volunteers is extraordinary - I adopted one of my cats directly out of a foster home, and the volunteer must have gone out of her way to come to the shelter at my convenience and explain all the in-home habits of my future baby. I had such a positive experience with her, and the shelter. They invite you to send updates and pictures as your new pet adjusts. Yes, the staff & volunteers have a vested interest in the pets and want to know how things go! \n\nThe rates for adoption vary, depending on the season, so if your finances require some help to acquire your new best friend, keep an eye on their website for info about \"sales.\" You can also donate old sheets, towels, pet carriers, and toys for the animals who stay here on their way to permanent homes. I donate a big pile of worn towels and sheets every time i sort my linen closet. They also accept ca$h donations to help keep up with expenses. \n\nMaybe I seem like an over-enthusiastic cheerleader of this place, but the fact is that this organization connected me with two very important cats in my life, and every scratch on my arms, every litter box, and every fur-covered outfit in my life is due credit to their tireless efforts.

While struggling with my horrific grief and having difficulty getting back into life as I once knew it, my grief counselor suggested that I \"help something else\" in order to help myself feel better.  We decided that since I was an animal lover I would try volunteering at an animal shelter.  I was not working, so I had a lot of time and wanted the shelter to feel right.  I visited a few, they all do good work, but the one that kept drawing me back was the ARL.  Yes, the building is old, it's a bit run down, but that doesn't stop the staff and administration from doing the best they can with so very little and in not the best of space.  I saw a bathroom be \"renovated into a vet tech office, I saw the janitor's closet renovated and made in to the \"rodent room.\"  Where cats once lived in cages along the halls of the ARL a new building next door, an old gas station was made into the \"Cat Adoption Center!\"  When you have staff that are still young and are going on 5-10 years + at the same shelter, (same place of employment for that matter) you know something about the place is right!  I volunteer easily 30 hours a week at the ARL, I get to see the good, the bad and the ugly, and I can tell you first hand that the good is in the staff, the Executive Director, Dan Rossi, and all of the work that goes on for the animals.  The staff knows EVERY one of the animals, they do all they can to care for them, and keep the doors WIDE open for both domestic and wild animals, even if that means a staff member or volunteer takes a cat or dog home!  The answer is never ever \"no\" to any animal.  I also volunteer for the Humane Society of the United States and travel around the countryside working on dogfighting raids, cruelty, hoarding, natural disasters, and the ARL has never said no to me when I ask to bring animals back from incredibly sad or inhumane situations.  Technically, by the numbers, it is a \"no-kill\" shelter, because it is open door people will often call it a \"kill shelter.\"  Yes, sometimes an animal does have to be euthanized.  The ARL is the Animal Control shelter for the city of Pittsburgh and with that can bring some very upsetting and disturbing signs of animal cruelty.  It can also mean it's the dog who just bit a kid that you just saw on the news.  The ARL has an obligation to society to not let dangerous dogs back on the street, to euthanize when a dog is very sick or is very aggressive to humans or other animals, and trust me, I have held many of those dogs as they are put to sleep and I always am so thankful that the vet staff we have are so compassionate and do the euthanasia in the most humane manner.  That's a tough job, it's heartbreaking, but in some cases it has to be done for the good of the animal and for the safety of society.  I admire the work and staff of the ARL and will continue to devote my time to them and thank them for the wonderful work they do on behalf of the city of Pittsburgh and all of the wild and domestic animals alike.

I hate to think of animals living in cages, but...\n\n!! At least two cats adopted from here in September have diagnosed with the herpes virus by the vet, and this is contagious to other cats. !!\n\nAKA, it is likely that the shelter staff is not washing hands between handling pets and they are not testing for a virus that can be fatal in kittens.\n\nI recently adopted a kitten from their shelter--I picked him up from their Pittsburgh Public Market adoption station.  I was told that he had been tested for common feline viruses and up-to-date on vaccinations.  These were both untrue statements.  The kitten has the herpes virus and was not vaccinated against this.  My roommate, who was with me, and I were warned about the upper respiratory infection (URI) that can occur because of this virus and others, but we were not told that he was neither tested nor vaccinated for the herpes virus.  They gave me a paper with his vaccinations, but it was in vet-speak, so I took their word for it. \n\nFurthermore, the shelter staff put my kitten in my roommate's name mistakenly (and claimed that if we just called in that they would fix this mistake, but then wouldn't), so when he got sick, no one from their clinic would return my calls--I'm guessing this was since I wasn't the owner according to their records.  I had to email them to get a response, which basically said sorry that we didn't return your calls but this is your problem now.  They never apologized for the kitten's health or asked if he was feeling better.  Where's the compassion for the animal?\n\nSo now I have a very sick kitten on my hands.  I took him to the Big Easy in Lawrenceville when he stopped eating, and Dr. Ruiz is the best.  She took care of him, but it cost $160 to treat the virus he picked up at the shelter.\n\nThe Animal Rescue League shelter/clinic said that it does not and will not cover expenses for this.  After I had already taken him elsewhere, the clinic staff said that they would have given me a discount if I had waited two days to go to their clinic, but who would wait two days while the kitten wouldn't eat??  And now this virus makes him ineligible for pet insurance.  It  will cost hundreds of extra dollars a year to keep him healthy. \n\nHad I not fallen in love with the little monster, I would have taken him back to another shelter.  That's what the person who adopted the other kitten with virus did.  Whenever he gets an outbreak, he will get another URI.  This means a lethargic cat who sneezes, gags, and coughs because he can't breathe and who won't eat because he's too congested to smell his food.  It's very sad--protect your cats with the herpes vaccination, please!\n\nOh, and in case you were wondering: just like in humans, cat herpes is fo' life.  Poor little guy.

It's also probably one of the more easy and humane ways to keep ties on your dog or cat just in case they were to run off one night.\n\nOnce we were registered, we waited at most for 15 minutes.  It's a very quick thing to have done.  Little Man E didn't even flinch.  He was more amused by his reflection in the table than that little pinch behind the shoulder blade.  I have to give huge kudos to the staff there.  They are so very friendly to not only you, but your pet.  It's like they talk their language.  I also have to thank them because while we were there, LME somehow ripped his one toenail and they were kind enough to clip as much of it off as they could (no extra charge either!).\n\nOnce done, we just walked outside to see what was up (E skipped the bath).

The small tables outside are a great place to spend the summer. \n\nTazza D'Oro brews Batdorf and Bronson beans (amazing), provides Enrico pastries (amazing) free wireless (amazing) and one of the most talented and friendly staffs I've ever met (amazing).

I talked about this with one of the barristas at TD'o and they were offended - \"we calibrate our machines the same, we use the same beans, the exact same blends and milks and everything, it can't be different.\" Sorry, Tazza D'oro, you are better. \n\nThe lines get long on weekend mornings, but they move quickly.

Tucked away in the middle of a charming old residential neighbourhood, you'll likely miss it the first drive by. Turning around is worth it.\n\nYes the staff tends to be the typical hipster, bike-riding sort that so commonly seems to staff indie coffee shops, but they're friendly and unpretentious, so don't hold it against them.  The patrons are almost exclusively college students (anyone else tends to drive by and take their coffee to go), though hipsters are actually in the minority here.  Anyone under the age of 25 will fit in perfectly, and no one 35 and under will feel uncomfortable.  \n\nThe noise level is perfect.  Most students are on their laptops with headphones, a few are chatting quietly, and the background (indie) music is just that.  You don't need headphones to concentrate here.\n\nDecor is decent without being great.  The ceiling is crossed by beautiful wooden beams, and the floor is a pleasantly bland creamy ceramic tile.  So is the wallpaper, though the original modern paintings tend to help make things interesting.  Where it loses points is in the furnishings: the mixture of wall lamps, hanging fixtures, and pot lights doesn't work well, the serving bar itself is an ugly cheap laminate, and the touches of plastic greenery dribbled around the place fails misserably.\n\nIced water is provided, which is decent (plastic cups are a minus), but inferior to the mineral water other places serve. We tried their richly brewed Ethiopian to rave reviews, with the party split on whether the thick ceramic mug was a plus (hefty and warming) or minus (hard to drink from). Truly fantastic coffee, but the lattes were rather disappointing: Beautifully steamed milk in every cup, but a rather bland espresso shot left the latte rather lacking in the nuanced flavour one finds in a 5 star establishment.  The medium latte (12oz, with 2 shots of espresso -- the steongest ratio they offer) should have been far better.\n\nThe food looked worth having, but we'd just eaten. Homemade pastries and fresh sandwiches looked tempting, and we certainly will come hungrier next time.\n\nA solid four stars, held back a bit by decor and a lot by espresso.", "business_id": "83_p9vIqOq1TUIf3_GD7bA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-09-05", "type": "review"}

You get 10 wings up front they will give more wings 5 at a time. The problem is that you get those wings in 30 minute intervals.  So the max you could eat is 55 wings. Did I mention that  the wings are really tiny and the sauce is tossed on like a Jackson Pollack painting.  They also charge extra for blue cheese or ranch.  The wings do not come with celery. This is a crime against humanity and the city of Buffalo.  \n\nI chose to detour from wings tonight and ordered a chicken sandwich. Apparently this was a bad choice.  It took a full hour to get my food. It was so long that the rest of the table ate their wings and ordered more and the waitress didn't think this was a problem. When my meal did arrive everything was cold. The sandwich was ok, but the fries were just tiny pieces that were limp and flavorless.\n\nI paid $16 for a beer and a sandwich that my friends had to wait for me to eat to leave.

But after owning a BMW for 3 years and having constant wheel alignment/tire issues (ie. when a tire warning signal lights up, it usually means my tire's about to blow out!!), I freaked out and frantically drove my Infiniti to the first 3 auto shops on Baum Blvd. I waited at the first stop for 5-10 minutes and the guy did not get off the phone.

After this review, I'm writing the president of AA and if action is not taken to correct the disservice at this location, I will never be a AAA member again. (been one since 1999) \n\nI recently moved from TN and needed to transfer my title and register my Dodge Ram in PA.  This process is costly regardless of where you go, but adding $36+ for every transaction makes AAA the most expensive.  I'm willing to pay for people to deal with this inconvenience for me, but AAA has made it worse than going to the DMV.  Each and every clerk at this location is incompetent, uneducated, and aloof. I should know, I've dealt with at LEAST a dozen. Go to the DMV.\n\nFor my very simple transaction, I've had to return to this location 7 (yes that is SEVEN!) times, and it still is not resolved. They've forgotten to request the title from my lien holder, issued the wrong plate for my vehicle, neglected to inform me of steps required by the state... I mean seriously, why would you pay $36 for EACH visit, just to get it wrong. Go to the DMV!\n\nWhy did you return there if you were so unhappy, you might ask.  Well once you begin the process at one branch, you cannot transfer to any other branch. (We went to Monroeville to transfer my wife's car and it took 30 minutes, ONCE.) Go to Monroeville, or cancel your AAA membership and go to the DMV!!\n\nOh, and 30 minutes? that's a dream... I'm waited between 45 minutes and 3.5 HOURS at the East Liberty AAA. Prepare to take the day of work... nay, the WEEK in order to complete any transaction at this facility. Go to the DMV!!!!\n\nIt has now been over 5 months since I started this process and it's still up in the air. they don't know what I still need to do, but they are happy to keep charging me to figure it out.  Save yourself hundreds of dollars and a weeks worth of lost wages and just GO TO THE DMV!!!!!!!! Yeah it might seem sterile and slow, but at least they aren't serial criminals. It'll be over with like waking up from a bad dream, instead of the reoccurring nightmare that is the East Liberty AAA.\n\nOh, and if you think this is a harsh review... Call their number, 412-365-7196. 9 times out of 10 it just rings and rings.. once I timed it for more than 30 minutes before I got an answer (with no apology).

I've substituted out a lot of wheat products like flour and instead use rice flour, regular milk for almond milk, things like that.\n\nMy favorite part of the store is there hot foods and salad bar. They make all their dishes in the store and sell them for $8.49lb. The hot dishes are amazingly good. The last time i went i had green beans with red peppers, cajun sweet potato wedges, sauteed mushrooms, curry tofu and purple cabbage. Man was it delicious!!!!

On the other hand, I also expected parking difficulties, even at stores with multi-story garages.\n\nThe Whole Foods Market in Pittsburgh is not much different from those in the DMV area. However, the parking is horrendous! Really, a medium-size private parking lot for the only Whole Foods Market in the Pittsburgh area right along a congested major road? Let me say that Whole Foods Markets in D.C. are also close to major roads, but they at least have underground or aboveground garages and fairly decent road infrastructure to accommodate for the influx and outflux of shoppers.

Most of the issues can be handled by slight changes in habit. For instance, park farther away instead of circling the GD parking lot for the closest spot!!!

(Sorry, for the tirade; that's a pet peeve of mine). \n\nThe produce is fantastic, always. And not just the organic stuff either. The regular pesticide-laden produce is great. The quality of the meat department is second to none. Now, the bakery is a little 'Eh' for me. The muffins and cookies and cakes always look De-Lish!, but they aren't. Usually to dry or dense or flavorless. It really doesn't matter because the star of the show is...\n\nThe HOT FOODS BAR. The quality and taste of most of the hot foods/prepared foods bar is unbeatable. I lovelvoelove the breakfast bar.

I may get creamed by a bus the second I leave, but I will die happy. \n\nSome of my other favorites are a Vegan General Tso's \"chicken\" that has the BEST real chicken texture. It's really good! The mozzarella pasta salad, Sicilian cauliflower and the egg rolls which are seasonal. Don't forget to check out the packaged hot foods across from the salad bar; same stuff but pre-packaged. \n\nAs a note though, the chicken fiesta soup is nooooot good. Bland with a capital B!

I first visited whole foods in February of this year.. In my opinion, it is a little overwhelming at first and here's why. Like most People in the US, I was brought up on all of the \"typical\" mainstream American food brands. So when I walked into this place and barely recognized any brands, it was slightly overwhelming. It took a little research and I still do some research on some products before making a trip. I recommend going online and checking their coupons before making a trip - I tried a bunch of new products that way. I have also googled \"best snacks at whole foods\" to get some more ideas of what to try. \n\nNow here's the sucky part- overall, whole foods is pretty overpriced. BUT I will say that it is not ENTIRELY their fault. They sell higher quality products than your average grocery store. Mostly all of their products are made with the best ingredients and are often organic and gmo free. They are vegan and vegetarian friendly and have tons of options for people with allergies. If companies are spending more money on better ingredients , they are going to have to sell their products for a higher price. \n\nHaving said that, tazo tea for $4 a box is not a sale. I went a couple weeks ago and saw the sale price advertised, did a quick google search and realized target sells their tazo tea for $3.50 NOT on sale. Needless to say I took the trip down the street and saved myself some money for the tea. I also recently wanted to purchase kale chips that I heard so much about (brand is called brad's raw and the flavor was vampire killer)... Until I realized they were $9 for 2 oz ! You can get fresh kale for less than half the cost! \n\nAlthough whole foods can be expensive they aren't ALWAYS that bad. My favorite yogurt, wallaby organic yogurt, is sold here. On a normal day, it cost $1 each. A couple days ago, they were 89 cents each- not bad for organic yogurt. They also have an amazing selection of uniquely flavored chocolates and they are pretty reasonably priced. Justin's organic peanut butter cups are incredible! \n\nThe customer service has  always been awesome in this particular location. I hear that whole foods is very willing to take back anything that you don't enjoy , as long as you have your receipt. \n\nas other yelpers have said- the parking sucks in this location, it's a nightmare.

I love the produce selection, the cheeses, and the meats. The hot bar is lovely and the bakery pretty good. When I moved to Pittsburgh, I was elated to finally have a Whole Foods I could shop at! \n\nBut the experience is just... unpleasant. Humans in BMW's/Audi's/beat up subarus have turned into vultures, circling... waiting... for the next spot to open up in the impossibly tiny lot. There are no words to describe the anguish of being stuck behind one of these vultures stalking a shopper with a full grocery cart, only to see a spot just ahead, that someone else pounces on while you helplessly look on. It sounds trivial and I get that this is a city, but is this what one really wants to deal with as they are trying to run errands on their day off when there are other, less stressful options near by? \n\nAnd, you know, I think the trauma of trying to find a parking spot remains with the shoppers long after parking their car because people the atmosphere is kind of stressful inside as well. The jockeying for the shortest line in the check out, the pushing people out of the way for the last organic horseradish root... it's about the same as any other urban grocery store but after the parking! Knowing the dangerous gauntlet I must run to get back to my car with my groceries! The prices! It's just not worth it. \n\nAnd I'd be willing to forgive all of this if it were an above average Whole Foods, but it's not. This brings me, at last, to the turkey. I called ahead in late October TWICE to make sure the turkey I ordered would be fresh for Thanksgiving. It was supposed to be fresh. It was labelled fresh. But it was frozen. If I'm going to pay 60 bucks for a bird, it really should come as labeled and advertised. I don't need the stress of hoping my bird will thaw before the big day (spoiler alert... it won't). Especially not after the parking lot.\n\nEDIT: Well, customer service was awesome and they refunded my frozen turkey.

For review #100, a 5 star review for a 5 star restaurant is definitely fitting.\n\nCasbah does brunch, lunch and dinner, but brunch is my favorite meal and also what they do best.  I ordered their prixe fixe brunch option which is a choice of an appetizer, brunch dish, and drink for $22.  I started off with smoked salmon and had the waitress recommended braised lamb and eggs as an entree and a mimosa to drink.  My companion ordered butternut squash & apple cider soup, wild mushroom omelet, and a glass of fresh orange juice.\n\nWhile waiting for our food, we munched on their complimentary pastry basket consisting of super moist mini-muffins, scones, and super rich and buttery biscuits with honey butter.\n\nThe smoked salmon came with capers, minced red onion, crumbled egg, a drizzle of aioli, and a beautiful fried potato cake.  There was just the perfect amount of everything on the dish; the potato cake was just big enough to balance out the saltiness of the smoked salmon and the capers of course paired beautifully with the smoked salmon.  I tried some of the butternut squash & apple cider soup and it had some a pretty complex flavor.\n\nMy entree reminded me of an eggs benedict with a twist: grilled  sourdough topped with spinach, braised lamb shoulder and two poached eggs.  I love braised meats because braising can do such wonders to tougher cuts.  The braised lamb shoulder was flavorful, tender, and super rich.  The best part about poached eggs is sopping up the extra yolk with bread and it just tasted better with the sauce of the lamb soaking into the sourdough to soften it up a bit.  This dish itself is enough to make me a regular.  I tried my companion's home fries which came with this slightly spicy ketchup (I think it's house-made) and also a piece of her omelet which was pretty good too.\n\nService was good, ambiance was good, portions were big, quality was excellent, AND they take reservations.

But I feel positively enough about my first meal there, that taking off a whole star seems harsh.  \n\nI got a free entree coupon for my birthday, for signing up for Big Burrito's mailing list, and decided to revisit Casbah.  The good: we got to enjoy the patio even though the weather was a little cool because it was heated.  My maccheretto, a pasta entree with white beans, sun-dried tomato, pesto and walnuts, was very good.  The pasta was al dente and the white beans were perfectly cooked (not mushy).  It was maybe a touch too salty (the fontina, maybe?), but I was happy with the choice.  \n\nNow, onto the weird.  After taking our orders, our waiter asked if we wanted bread with our big-calorie pasta dishes.  Checking if we want bread is fine--but, umm, he could have left out the comment about the pasta?  My friend and I are both twentysomething women.  Luckily, we're not that insecure about our bodies.  We like to eat.  Yes, bring the bread.\n\nWhen he brought our entrees, he sang \"Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you\" under his breath as he put my pasta in front of me.  I don't like people singing to me at restaurants, so I'm grateful it wasn't audible to everyone else on the patio--but a simple \"Happy birthday\" would have sufficed.  Then when he cleared our plates, he asked if my dish was \"everything [I] wanted, and more.\"  I appreciate the gestures, but it felt artificial.\n\nHe asked if we'd like to see the dessert menu--and added that he was supposed to ask that, that we shouldn't feel obligated.  Uh, what?  I think this and the bread/pasta comment bothered me the most.  \n\nTo redeem the birthday coupon, you have to show an ID.  I recently cut my hair, so it's different than my license photo.  When he returned my ID to me, our waiter said, \"I like the short hair.\"  If this had been the only unusual statement he had made during the meal, I would have taken it as a compliment.  I guess it is one.  But when considered with all the other weird things, it just felt like he was trying way too hard and my friend and I both felt awkward.\n\nThe food here is good and I feel that the service this time was unusual, and the more professional service I had on my first visit here is closer to the norm.

Their happy hour has some good deals - $6 cocktails and glasses of wine, and $1 of bottled beer.  It was a fun, trendy atmosphere and a nice place to go for a glass of sangria after a busy day.\n\nI came back for dinner a month or so later.  We had reservations (on a Monday night) and were seated immediately -even though the restaurant was surprisingly busy.  We sat in the covered area out front - sort of like sitting in a dim, Mediterranean garden.  And yes - the lights are low throughout the whole restaurant.  Even with my young eyes, I still needed a candle to read the menu.  But it is romantic and a peaceful place to eat.  A little uncomfortable, as they have metal chairs (sort of like upscale patio furniture), but not a big deal.  Sit inside at a booth if you need to sit on something soft.\n\nThe menu is pricey and we're all poor, so we just got entrees.  I actually had a cocktail to start - the Perfect Pear - with elderflower liqueur, vodka, sage, pear, and vermouth.  There was even a little sage leaf floating in the glass.  It was a wonderful drink, with all the flavors I love.  Still, for the price, I think the portion was a little stingy.  When I buy an $11 cocktail, I like it to really fill the glass.  We nibbled on warm bread while we waited, and all tried their pesto on top - I think it was an unusual homemade pesto, something like walnut-watercress?  It was a bit bland - I think regular basil pesto would've been a better choice.\n\nThings got better during the actual dinner.  I ordered the Heritage Farms Chicken which was juicy and fresh, and served with a tangy pasta.  Each little detail of the dish was well-chosen - honestly, even the grilled baby squash was outstanding.  It's just squash!  But somehow, it was heavenly.  My friend enjoyed her Cioppino, and my boyfriend liked his veal tortellini, complete with rich pieces of lobster.  I tried a little bit, and it was tasty - very herbal and really bursting with flavor.  The only dish that fell a little flat was the potato gnocchi - my friend's boyfriend ordered it.  Actually he liked most of it very much, but he couldn't get past the aggressive bitterness of the turnip greens.  I tasted them too, and I have to say - it was off-putting.  Perhaps that's just the way turnip greens are, but it really didn't work for us in the dish.  Fortunately, the waitress was incredibly kind and helpful, and brought him out a new plate sans greens, which he finished happily.\n\nWe also had a few desserts - vanilla bean creme brulee for us, flourless chocolate torte for them.  I didn't taste it, but apparently it was incredibly rich.  I enjoyed our creme brulee - because I enjoy all creme brulee - although the roasted quince on top didn't quite work for me.  \n\nOverall, the meal ranged between good and very good, but the great service from our waitress really pushed this to a 4 star rating.  I had hoped to be a little more wowed by the food.  But this experience was definitely positive enough to warrant a second visit for dinner.  I think it'd be a nice place to go for a special occasion, or if you feel like a little splurge on a flavorful meal.", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-11-29", "type": "review"}

We sat outside and atmosphere was cozy under the tent with the warm colors of the decor. Our waitress was incredibly friendly and presented us with the menus. I think it is great they have a prix fixe brunch - 1 alchy or nonalchy drink, an appetizer and an entree - but for $24. It looks like they have since raised the prices since Miles O. went. I felt it was just a tad steep and a lot of food but took the plunge anyway. I ordered the smoked salmon for the appetizer and the mushroom omlette for my entree, and had a hot coffee (they did not have ice coffee though offered to put ice with hot coffee if I wanted it). The waitress brought out some delicious mini baked treats before we got our dishes - poppy scone (on the crispier side but delicious), blueberry muffins and biscuits, which were all buttery goodness. After eating these I was getting a little full and then after my appetizer I realized I probably should not have gotten the prix fixe but could have would have should have.

If you have three people with you, forget about mingling!  \n\nAlso, the service was very iffy.  There was a bartender, and then a server for the bar area (or what it seemed like).  The bartender got us our drinks, but never told us a server would be with us.  I figured she was our server too.  But then some other woman came up to us all flustered.  She never introduced herself, just asked what we wanted and kept saying \"okay, okay, okay.\"  Just very odd.  It continued that way the entire time.\n\nI tried the prix fixed brunch for $24, which includes your choice of an alcoholic bevvie (Bloody Mary, Sangria or Mimosa), appetizer and main course.  I had the mimosa, that was the perfect mix (splash of OJ:), Polenta and Eggs Beni.  The cinnamon polenta, which was delish: light, fluffy and warm with dried fruit and almonds on top.

For my entree, I ordered the double cut pork chop and my husband ordered the cioppino. The huge pork chop arrived medium well, as requested, but was still tender and juicy, even better when dipped in the sage jus. In additiion, the bitterness of the braised kale paired well with the smooth, creamy parmesan and proscutto risotto. My husband was also a big fan of the cioppino. The mussels, clams, shrimp, halibut and scallops were cooked to perfection. I was equally impressed with the size of the scallops. We're talking the width of a coffee cup!

However,  1/2 way through dinner it seemed like they were seating those with reservations inside and walk ins outside. \n\nThe place is set up with what would be the patio, enclosed. There are big heaters on the ceilings that are directed straight at the tables. I will say that it was a little too warm and even though the host said he would turn them down, I don't think that was done. \n\nThe waitress came and told us about the menu, took our drink orders and brought us some bread with a yogurt spread and salted butter. I did ask her if the $10 off entr\u00e9e coupon could be used on the pasta entr\u00e9es and I think at that point she began to think that we were poor young kids. But back to that later. . . \n\nTo start we shared the crispy calamari ($11) with capers, lemons, chili and parsley which was probably some of the best calamari ever. It was not chewy and it had the best sauce ever! We also ordered the grilled chickpea flatbread appetizer ($9) which I expected to be a flatbread but actually came as grilled pita with three separate dips - baba ghanoush, hummus and red pepper muhummara. \n\nFor dinner, I ordered the short rib ravioli ($24) which came with swiss chard, oyster mushrooms, roasted shallots and gremolata. This was the more decadent dish ever! When it first came, it had about 6 raviolis and didn't appear to be enough but it was more than enough!\n\nMy husband ordered the Casbah Double Cut Pork Chop ($27) which came with braised kale, prosciutto & parmesan risotto, garlic cream and a sage jus. The pork was very moist and the risotto was cooked perfectly. There were no left overs!\n\nAfter this huge meal, we decided on taking a dessert to go. We both agreed upon the Dark Chocolate Rasberry Bread Pudding ($8). So I asked the waitress if it would travel well since we wanted to take it to go. At that time, she looked at me and asked if we had a toaster oven where we lived. . . Um yes lady we do, in fact we have an oven also AND we own our own home. Despite the comment, we took the dessert home and put it in the oven later that night and we were not disappointed. \n\nOverall the meal was delicious, we got to use two $10 off coupons and I would highly recommend it to anyone.

I was only able to taste a small piece of his since he ate it so quickly, but I agree it was excellent. The short rib was so tender and juicy. I was concerned it would be overly salty and it was not. It was the best ravioli I have eaten hands down! For dessert, we ordered a cheese tasting. It was the perfect way to end our meal-with the cheese tasting and a glass of wine.

I was with a large group and did not want to make a scene, so I mentioned it to the server who immediately took my plate away. The manager on duty came out to apologize, which I did appreciate. However, I was a little surprised because when they brought my plate out about 5 minutes later, I could tell that it was the same exact plate. \n\nFirst off, it was not even warm, so if they made my meal on the spot you would think it would be hot, or at the very least warm. I had also substituted bacon for the sausage that normally comes with the entree, and if the chef had made a new plate on the spot, he would probably have sent it out with the sausage (or with a side of bacon again), which he did not (they had served my bacon on the side when they brought it out initially).     Everything was in the exact same place on the plate. I wasn't going to cause a scene, so I pretended to enjoy it, but did not. I was quite repulsed.\n\nin my last review I had said that Casbah was my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. I had mentioned that the Cassericia dish was my favorite but that they had removed it from the menu the last time I tried to order it there for dinner. I received a response from someone at the restaurant that she was not sure why I would think that because it is still offered, and I explained that the waiter told me it was removed from the menu. \n\nI'm not really sure what happened here, but I can tell you this... I don't think that Casbah is my favorite anymore. In fact not only is it not my favorite, it has taken a plunge to the bottom of my list of places to eat. \n\nFor me, if you expect to eat at a top restaurant, the service should be top of the line, and it has just been too inconsistent for my taste.

We went here for a friend's birthday and Casbah was a festive environment. This place is fine dining but it's not stuffy. I tried to keep my fork and knife and the server made jokes about how that's not their style. In addition, the patio is a nice romantic backdrop with overhanging lights and white curtains.\n\nFirst let me talk about the drinks. My husband's moscow mule was a little stronger than most places would make it, but they do have the copper mugs. Some places cheap out on that but not Casbah. I had a delicious house Malbec but then switched over to a Grenache and Carignan blend. It was the first time I've had such a mix and I was so happy with my choice that I ended up ordering another glass. It was a wonderfully rich and bold (but not bitter) combination that was a superb pairing to our dinner entrees.\n\nFor starters I had the octopus, which was ok but not great. There was too much of a char flavor so it was almost burnt. The tuna however was an explosion of flavor. It was fresh and very flavorful.\n\nFor my main dish, I had the duck. I double checked with the waitress when I ordered to make sure the skin was crispy and it was indeed. The meat was perfectly tender and the sauce was sweet and savory.\n\nEveryone at the table thoroughly enjoyed their meals. The lamb shank is so large you need to get a takeaway bag. \n\nThe birthday boy's wife arranged for an ice cream before we got to dinner. The waitress seamlessly distracted us with dessert menus while she got the cake ready, so she really added to the birthday fun.\n\nAll in all, this place really impressed.

There are enough good options on the menu that a seasoned QS diner could guide a newbie past the landmines of total-miss dishes, in search of the greener pastures of the spicy peanut tofu wrap and other local faves. The scrambled tofu is a shining star. The kitchen often does remarkable things with potatoes. The salads go above and beyond to woo your heart, with way more toppings & stuff than any other salad I've eaten in Pittsburgh -- this includes salads served with French Fries! Nothing here is fried - even the \"fried\" foods are baked. Your arteries are grateful. The kitchen is unfortunately very inconsistent, and an attentive & caring cook is a very different experience here than the apathetic, distracted or exhausted cook. \n\nThis used to be The Place to Brunch, and I'm sure it's still busy on the weekend mornings, but I had to quit when all these SUV families started monopolizing my fave tables -- apparently the QS made it into some kind of \"VISIT PENNSYLVANIA\" travel guide as a great brunch spot. I hate to be that \"I liked their old stuff better\" kind of a person, but, well... \n\nDon't be caught unawares- in my cashless world, dinner at the QS means making a special ATM run. \n\nThe QS is super kid-friendly. Books, magazines, and children's toys accompany the wireless internet (which sometimes works, and sometimes doesnt, and no, the staff can't help you). The menu is kid-friendly, the staff is used to dealing with kids, and if you really hate children, you might not want to go there since their peals of laughter and joy might melt your wicked black heart. I wouldn't hesitate to take the 2 year olds or 12 year olds I know. \n\nThe drip coffee is good and bottomless- soy creamer is available. The espresso drinks are really really hit or miss. You may have the tastiest drink you could imagine, or you might be left choking down a $5 drink made by someone who has never drank a cup of coffee. No liquor license but you can BYOB for a nominal charge. \n\nThe service is sometimes swift, but more often lacking. I would never take a date here again --- getting the totally wrong order & waiting half an hour for it to be even acknowledged by the staff is an embarrassment when you tell your date the restaurant is one of your faves. Fortunately, if you are dating me, you probably aren't there for the dinner. \n\nIf you have plenty of time to kill & self-esteem strong enough to weather the whithering glances of the hipper set of pgh's east end, this could be your new fave spot too.

Surrounded by a desolate urban landscape, I never would've expected this colorful, creative coffee shop to have such impressive food.\n\nMy dinner here consisted of an apple panini and a \"shampoo\", a strange (but delicious!) cherry and almond cream soda. It very well might have taken me 20 minutes or more simply to decide on my beverage of choice - their list was not only long, but offered more innovative choices than I could have ever dreamt up. Among them, an impressive array of Italian sodas (lavender & lemon, mango & lime, white choc & mint, etc.), an enticing selection of lemonades (ginger lemonade, lavender lemonade), and some excellent-sounding tea combinations. To top it off, almost all flavors were available in the form of vegan milkshakes. How they concocted all of these culinary ideas is absolutely beyond me. (I apologize to the coffee drinkers. As a tea drinker myself, I hardly paid attention to that half of the menu.)\n\nThe apple panini I ordered came out quickly and was complemented with a side of tortilla chips and salsa. My panini included granny smith apples, apple butter, sharp cheddar, cream cheese, and seisage (vegetarian sausage) atop sun-dried tomato bread (though it seemed more like raisin to me). Never in a million years would I have come up with this strange combination of flavors, but it definitely worked. As described in the menu, indeed it was \"highly addictive\".\n\nTable service was great, nothing took too long and it seemed pleasant and casual. No overbearing waiters, no frills, etc.\n\nGiven the fact that I live about a mile away, I think they should be expecting yet another regular in the very near future.", "business_id": "PzG0XmAmtXFs6Fdnubf41g", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-10-29", "type": "review"}

My last experience was honestly two-star, but nostalgia and history don't allow me to give it less than a three.\n\nI'm sure all the changes over the years have been in the name of efficiency, but they've come at expense to the clientele.

My girlfriend is a veg-head aka vegetarian and had wanted to visit Quiet Storm for a while.  When we finally visited this week, I was pleasantly surprised.  There is definitely an old-time diner feel with a bit of arts and crafts mixed in.  If you're reading this, chances are that you have some notion of the crunchy/hipster/longhair reputation of this place and that perception is certainly accurate to a degree but I did not find the service pretentious or slow at all, as some have noted.  Our server was attentive, although there were only about seven folks in the place (it was off hours, about 4 PM on a Monday.)  I enjoyed the apple panini with seisage (a maiden voyage for me), apple butter, cream cheese and cheddar.  The apple butter, which seemed almost an add-on when I looked at the menu, was actually the star here and the sandwich comes on sundried tomato bread that really adds a lot of flavor to a very simple idea.  My only complaint is about the size of the sandwich.  It could have been larger.  My girlfriend ordered a burrito that was honestly huge and she found it tasty and worthy of a doggie bag.  I would definitely go back and would like to try their weekend brunch, which is supposedly quite good.\n\nAccording to the menu and reputation, Quiet Storm goes out of their way to use local products and makes quite a few of their products in-house.

I have returned now in 2011 for a veg brunch, and it was a pleasant, if not-so-good-value-for-money experience. I got the True Grits (yeah, Jeff Bridges, yeah), which was a HUGE bowl of grits (some shaved, grocery store-feeling cheddar on top), a pile of delicious, chopped lemony kale, some pretty blah scrambled eggs and a large glass of cranberry juice (very healthy!).

In that it does some things right, but none of the important things.  It has a decent sized shop with large windows and its bright, so that's good.  They have good music, but unfortunately we were seated right below one of what looked like two speakers in the place.  Its a large restaurant so in order to make it the right volume for people far away from the speaker it has to be too loud for the people close to the speaker.  I know the trade-offs of sound systems all too well.  If only there was a way to solve this problem like... just riffing here... more speakers at a lower volume?\n\nThey had a greatest hits of the thrift store type of decor and the standard shitty artists selling their paintings like at every coffee house you've ever been to.  They include coffee/tea/juice/whatever in the price of the brunch because, like everyone, I hate choices too and I definitely wanted at least one of those.  I'm looking at the menu and its a vegan/veggie place so we're never going to be good friends but I'd like to think that there's something that looks halfway decent but it all looks awful.  There are two Tex-Mex-Ranchero breakfast dishes... that's at least one too many; and there's only like eight choices which sounds like plenty as a number but I assure you it was not enough here.\n\nI go with the Egg Frittata as my least bad option and it ends up tasting mostly flavorless but with a distinct stale note.  It comes with a salad that is not bad, but who wants a salad for breakfast.  As we're leaving the waiter, who's been fine the whole time, asks us where we're from and my girlfriend answers \"D.C.\"  The waiter replies, \"Oh, I'm sorry about that.\"  Now, neither of us is actually born in the D.C. area, nor do I even particularly like living there.  So I'm not personally offended, but I'm not sure if someone from or living in Pittsburgh has solid footing to talk the business about Washington D.C. or almost any other large city.  Its not like property values in Pittsburgh are indicating that everyone's clammoring to live there, whereas in Washington D.C., they are.\n\nI was not enjoying the restaurant before that, but this kid actually threw me to straight up hating it.

As a seeker of good wings, let me tell you about my adventure with this place. \n\nEverything started fine with our order of 24 wings with three separate sauces for 3 eaters. The wings arrived exactly an hour later with the exact number of wings promised and a side of celery. Here's the catch...THERE WAS NO SAUCE! My party of three decided to just tough it out and eat the wings plain. They were, I kid you not, so bland that I wasn't sure what I was eating. They literally just threw the wings in the fryer and delivered it to us. So once we realized how unbearable the plain wings were, we called and complained about the sauce. About 40 minutes later, the sauce arrived. At this point, the wings got cold and our hunger turned into an unbearable rage. We tried BBQ, Garlic Parmesan and Spicy. The sauces were just average. The spicy sauce was so weak that I should've just settled with a bottle of sirracha. \n\nThe deliver guy gave us a cannoli as an apology....ONE CANNOLI....3 eaters! You get the point. But this gives me the chance to tell you how terrible the cannoli was. The outer shell was soggy and the filling made me gag a little. It looked nice, but didn't taste that great. \n\nSo after 1 hour and 40 minutes, 24 wings, 3 sauces and a cannoli... we have 3 very unhappy customers. The wings were the most mediocre wings I have ever tasted. I will NOT order here again for the wings NOR will I recommend it to the fellow wings connoisseurs out there.

Looots of V0, VB, V1, V2s... I think the hardest I saw was a V7. I don't boulder much more than a V2, and I found a lot of fun, challenging courses. It wore me out, but I felt like a superstar. (My local climbing gym is a lot harder.) That was great!\n- They offer to play your music! I always appreciate that in a gym. It's cool to hear other people's tastes, it's cool to let my tastes get some air, and indeed one tires of the alt 90s Pandora station.\n- That said, I did feel some Interpol-sounding pixie dust bewitch my ear drums. And I appreciate that. I always appreciate being able to rock out/feel cool while simultaneously lunging for the next hold.\n- $16 for a day pass and shoes was not terrible. It wasn't great, either, but it wasn't terrible. (And what's in between a pro and a con?)\n- Easy parking.\n\n\nCONS\n- A lot of the walls felt way too tall to be lacking a top rope. I'd guess some of the tallest walls were 10 ft. - and, dude, falling 10 feet on a (bouncy) floor is still super dangerous, especially if you fall in between a Tarzan lunge (and thus, awkwardly). They had a few mats which were \"strategically positioned\" and thus couldn't be moved, but even with those under me, I didn't feel so good. They felt little thicker than a down comforter. Dude, come on! I didn't break my neck, but my muscles were all a-trembly, my hands slick with sweat, and it was sheer terror that often kept me from lunging (Tarzan-style) to the next hold. I had to give up on a few climbs just because I didn't feel safe! And that is very lame. I would have felt a LOT safer if the 6+ ft. walls were just top rope-able, or if they bought some bigger, thicker mats and let people drag them around. A free helmet's not gonna help much if you land on your shoulder!\n- I saw a kid wandering around who looked adorable, pubescent and a little intimidated. It seemed like his first time. It broke my heart, 'cuz he seemed to have gotten frustrated after trying a few of the climbs and not being able to get very far. I think he left after not very long. Does the gym offer kids classes? Or one-on-one instruction, especially if the person's totally new and under 15 or something? It just seemed like such a shame; I'd hate to have a kid get sour on climbing just because they had an awkward first time! People need to be taught this stuff! (To an extent.)\n- $2 for the privilege of chalk.

We both ordered the soup of the day, a pumpkin bisque, my wife just ordered their Zhino side salad as her entree, and I chose a lamb burger (not Elysian Fields lamb, I asked).  Our waiter brought us a basket of what I suspect to be Portuguese bread.  It had a delicious sweetness. Our soups came out fairly quickly.  The bowls held a hearty serving of the delicious (and filling) cream soup.  After clearing our empty bowls our waiter bought out our entrees.  My wife's side salad was large, as side salads go.  She was quite pleased with it.  It had baby greens, tomato, olives, hearts & reduced red wine vinaigrette.  I had a taste and agreed with her assessment.  My lamb burger was huge!  It was at least an inch thick and was topped with feta and fruit chutney.  It came with a salad that filled any remaining space on the plate not taken up by the burger.  Note to self- do not order a salad if you're going to order the lamb burger!  I ordered the burger cooked medium-well, even though the waiter sort of tried to talk me into medium.  It came out just the way I wanted it, with just a hint of pink in the middle, and full of delicious juices.  My wife agreed that it was extremely yummy!  I cut the burger in half and managed to eat one of the halves along with about half the salad before I ran out of room.  My wife made it about halfway thru her salad by then, and she too gave up.  We asked for doggie bags and our waiter packed our meals up in containers and put them in a plastic bag for us.  It was a very nice meal and dining experience.  We noticed that the hostess greeted most people who came thru he door by name.  Obviously there are a large group of regulars who dine here often.\nPros: BYOB, tasty food, reasonable noise level, outdoor sidewalk dining is available seasonally, friendly and attentive service (if a bit unpolished).\nCons:  Ambience (it originally was a gas station) and there is nothing fancy about the funky decor, tables are packed every which way into the available interior space.", "business_id": "l_Wey2YC6NvVUIH8vTygGg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-10-06", "type": "review"}

Touring is only available for the first and second floors, however, you get to see the bedrooms, the kitchen, the library, and the calling room, in addition to the servants quarters. While Frick was an extensive art collector, most of his work is displayed in New York. The family home contains many paintings of the family though. The Frick Art Museum has some of his collection and typically has a rotating exhibit as well. The car and carriage museum is an interesting step back in time as well with items ranging from old Lincolns and Rolls Royces to a winter sleigh. Photos are allowed in this area. There is also a cafe, which I hear is quite nice, however, it is also quite hard to get into and reservations are a must.

To start they set the table with \"Holy Oil,\" which is banana pepper olive oil for dipping Italian bread in, a seasoned cecci bean and cheese gustoso and a goat cheese and olive spread. I wish they sold that banana pepper olive oil because I wanted to have it every day of my life! \n\nWe ordered the famous Meatball appetizer. This meatball is for serious! It's massive and stuffed with mozzarella cheese. Yep, I'm for realz. It was just oozing Italian sexiness, in a ball. As soon as I tasted the red sauce, it tasted like my Grandma's, which sparked fond memories and made me want to actually live in this place. \n\nWe also ordered the Trifolata, which is assorted mushrooms and currants in marsala cream. It was also incredible. The bad/good of it was that it wasn't really needed because they give you so much food, but it was delicious, so whatever!\n\nFor the Third course they serve you your choice of pasta either with their famous home made vodka sauce or fettucini. But here's the thing, the fettucini is made in front of you... in a cheese wheel. Yep, I'm for realz again! I know I'm crazy for not ordering it, but I really love me some vodka sauce and was incredibly happy with this amazing homemade sauce. My hubby got the fetticini and loved it. See, we're all happy here!\n\nFourth course is a salad with red vinagariette, roasted red peppers, candied walnuts, golden raisens and gargonzola cheese. It wasn't memorable amongst all the bangin' dishes but not too shabby at all.\n\nFor the Fifth course (and when I finally tapped out) I ordered the Cioppino with shrimp, mussels, clams, scallops and fish in a saffron and tomato broth with sambuca. It matched all the other dishes. Just incredible. Loved the broth, loved the succulent scallop (just one, but I can't complain, I was stuffed by that point!), the shrimp was jumbo and the fish was perfectly cooked. And the garlic bread was excellent.\n\nWhenever anyone says things are expensive, I usually think they're talking $30 a plate. But, this place is legit expensive. Think $50 (ish) a plate. But what I can tell you is it was 100% worth it! We had leftovers for two days! Talk about an Italian hospitality.

This is the framed \"art\" inside the women's restroom located on the 2nd floor. Odd. I nearly poked my eyes out with my mascara brush from staring. It's hypnotizing.\n\nNow that we got that out of the way, let's talk about  the restaurant!\n\nAfter months of whining, a group of 8 of us finally decided to nut up or shut up and finally made plans. (Thank you, Samantha B. for organizing!)\n\nGetting a reservation for 8 is not an easy task. The building is a three-story, traditional townhouse  that is very narrow leaving only so much space inside for the dining area, bar, and the kitchen. And, it is located in the middle of Allentown. Yes, Allentown. This fact could qualify as the baby elephant in the room but it seems to be the trend to operate fantastic restaurants in areas that would make your average xenophobe from suburbia go bat shit cray cray.  And, for the record, I'm not drinking Hatorade. I was equally \"scurred\"  during the drive up E. Warrington Avenue...and I live in the East End where hipsters and old school hippies are known to reside and give peace a chance. \n\nThe reality is what it is. It's a scary part of town but it did not matter a damn when we got out of the car. It was a Saturday night and we were greeted by an average Joe  valet who sincerely welcomed us to the restaurant  and told us to enjoy our dinner. The locals who walked by smiled and nodded as if they were giving us their approval. It's as if the restaurant was under a dome, protected by a force field that doesn't allow the stereotypical nonsense most would fear when entering Allentown at night. \n\nWe were greeted by our server who immediately took our drink orders. I didn't see a bar on the first floor so I almost hesitated to order my usual dirty martini and my sweetheart's Manhattan, thinking they were limited in their mixology. Orders were taken without pause and both drinks were most impressive. Our friends enjoyed vino rossos and biancos from their diverse wine list that is 100% Italia! \n\nTables are set with \"Holy Oil\" for dipping artisanal Italian breads, a seasoned cheese and cecci bean gustoso, and, my favorite, a fresh goat cheese olive spread.\n\nWe started with the artichoke appetizer special and shared the meatball appetizer with the rest of the table. Yes, shared. The meatball is bigger than Barry Bonds and Kanye West's egos combined. And, it was friggin' fantastic. The flavors, the marinara sauce, the mozzarella stuffed inside...If I could marry a meatball, this would be matrimonial bliss.\n\nMy sweetheart chose the highly recommended veal chop Milanese. This is yet another piece of meat listed on the menu not small in size. Because I am always the a-hole of the group, I asked if I could have Linguine and Clam sauce instead of the pasta prep on the menu. Again, no hesitation. Wow. But the groans from my our table makes me still an a-hole. I DON'T CARE! IT WAS MY CARB DAY DAMNIT! :-)\n\nOur entrees did not disappoint. TASTY!!!! The entrees minus the pasta came with salad and pasta side served family style. Lots of food to be shared.\n\nWe finished with the hand-spun espresso gelato. Others at the table went for other gelato flavors and the Tiramisu. We all had spoons to share. All were \"delish\".\n\nI was tempted to order the other highly recommended entree, the Cowboy Steak Diane. My friend Beth had the pleasure. The wild mushrooms on her dish looked just as big as the meatballs and she raved about the Worcestershire butter. She offered me a sample but I was too full and ready to birth my food baby.\n\nOh yeah. How could I forget! Franco Harris walked in. SHUT UP!!! Not entirely surprising after viewing the wall on the second floor covered with photos of VIPs posing with the chef/owner. \n\nIt's great to see a gem in Allentown that can shine a light on the other diamonds in the ruff in that area. But don't let  the neighborhood fool you. This restaurant is VERY high end in service, cuisine, price, and atmosphere.\n\nI really enjoyed my experience at Alla Familigia so maybe it wasn't such a coincidence they placed The Terminator's Mr. Universe pic in the restroom...because...

Alla Famiglia has been on my list of places to try for quite a long time and I was eagerly anticipating eating a dinner here.  We arrived shortly before our reservation time of 7:30 at about the same time as another couple from our party. We were almost immediately taken back to our table which was on the first floor in a back room.  I honestly didn't notice too much while we were walking back to our table but thought there was not much decoration in the room we were in.  Yes there was a fireplace but nothing else really sticks out besides the fact that the lights would dim a bit for about 5 seconds before eventually brightening back up every 10 minutes or so.\n\nSince none of our party had ever been to Alla Famiglia before our server took the time to go over the menu with us.  Whenever he got to the veal chop and explained it was their specialty, I immediately knew that was what I wanted.  So I ended up ordering that with the pizzaiolo option while my fiance went with the seafood diavolo.  My veal chop was described as a double cut natural chop braised with hot and sweet peppers, homemade Italian sausage, and plum tomatoes while my fiances seafood diavola had many different types of seafood in it including a lobster tail.  All entrees also come with a first course of salad and a second course of pasta with vodka sauce, both served family style.  While we were waiting for our first course to come out they served us some crusty Italian bread along with a couple of different dipping sauces of which I remember one that had a couple of different imported cheeses, one with goat cheese and then another which was olive oil based and called the holy oil(?) due to a trio of herbs of which one was basil.  That one was my favorite and when combined with some of the Parmesan cheese that they had on the table was awesome.  After a short while our salads came out, 2 family style bowls for the 6 of us along with a dish of Gorgonzola so that we could top our salads with it.  The salad ended up tasting decent, I only wish that I had more of it.  The six of us quickly finished it all and then were in for quite a bit of a wait before our pasta with vodka sauce arrived.  It was long enough for all of us to notice and wonder what was taking so long for pasta.  Whenever it arrived, once again 2 family style bowls for the 6 of us, I thought that it tasted pretty good.  It wasn't the best vodka sauce I have ever tasted but since I was still pretty hungry at this point I really enjoyed it especially after adding some of the chili oil that they brought to the table with it.  The chili oil gave the sauce that perfect bite for me.  Almost immediately after finishing our pasta our dinner entrees arrived.  My veal chop looked impressive and was big enough to make comments about how it could tip the car on the Flintstones.  Most of that was due to the size of the bone although there was a decent amount of meat on it.  The veal itself was cooked perfectly as it was moist and juicy and I  ended up enjoying it. The pizzaiolo sauce was just ok though as some of the sausage that I had seemed to be burnt while others were fine.  Whenever I had the non burnt pieces I liked it but the couple of burnt pieces really made the sauce inconsistent from bite to bite.  I was also lucky enough to try some of my wonderful fiances lobster tail and thought that it was very good.  It was cooked perfectly and was tender and tasty while not being overdone at all.  After all that we had eaten our whole table ended up passing on dessert and I left the restaurant full but not overly so.  I am still wondering about all of these reviews that tell you how much food they received which was also said by the valet on the way in.  It made me wonder do they normally serve a family style portion to two people instead of the three like they did at our table?  Should I feel cheated on this one?  Maybe I will find out on a future visit but then again maybe I will not.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I might come back here again in the future but I don't think that this would be my first choice.  Don't get me wrong, the food here was pretty good but whenever my food bill after tip is coming out to about $150, they had better either have impeccable service like the Capital Grille or Ruth Chris' or to die for food.  Sadly Alla Famiglia let me down on both accounts here as the food was good and the service average.", "business_id": "qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-10-02", "type": "review"}

We made reservations weeks in advance and I counted down the days. Finally, D day arrived. We arrived and quickly valeted the car. I would definitely suggest you valet. The neighborhood seemed a bit sketchy. Into the restaurant I happily galloped. What a cute little place. Open kitchen in the first room. We sat in the second room. Homey, old school Italian feel. The server explained the menu and took our drink order. Hubs and I split a bottle of wine. Nothing better than a good bottle of red wine with a hearty Italian meal. \n\nWe were ready to eat. I dug into the bread on the table and thoroughly enjoyed the holy oil dip. So much so that I didn't even bother with the other two spreads. The menu was very veal heavy. I guess that's their specialty but not what I was looking for. I chose the filet gorgonzola. Our first course was salad. Served family style this salad was savory and sweet with raisins and gorgonzola on the side. Then we waited, and waited and waited. They are definitely not in a rush here. The next course was pasta with vodka sauce. After reading the reviews, I was a little disappointed that we were not offered the alfredo cheese wheel as an option. The vodka sauce was lacking flavor for me. I added a little chili oil and it brightened up some. Again we waited and waited. Finally, our entrees arrived. My filet was cooked well and tender.

We were treated extremely well from the second we walked in the door.  They even had a menu printed with a \"Happy birthday Jennifer\" message on the top!  What a nice touch.\n\nWe were seated in the area near the door with a view of the kitchen.  There is also a small room (three tables) on the same floor.  The upper floor has a dining area and bar, but they are often booked for private events.\n\nWhen you arrive, there are three accompaniments for your fresh baked bread.  The \"holy oil\" that is an olive oil and banana pepper mix.  It lives up to its name because it was divine.  There was also a goat cheese spread that had red peppers and olives.  I'm a huge goat cheese fan, so I could have eaten this by the spoonful.  There was also a bean and cheese mixture with three types of cheese chopped up.  It was incredible as well.  You may be tempted to fill up on these delictible delights, but don't, becase as good as these items are, it only gets better from there.\n\nWe were having a hard time deciding whether to get the meatball appetizer or the hand pulled mozzarella.  The waitress steered us towards their meatball since it is one of their signature items.  It was a wise decision.  The meatball is the size of a fist and it was perfect.  I don't usually like meatballs or red sauce and I found myself devouring every last bit of both on this plate.  The meatball is stuffed and topped with an excellent mozzarella and then drenched with an amazing red sauce with bits of garlic.  If you order this, make sure you are sharing because it is huge. \n\nThe salad course was very tasty.  It as a mix of field greens, an olive oil dressing, gorgonzola and other incredibly tasty things.  I could have eaten the entire plate of it myself but wanted to save room for the pasta and my entree.\n\nThe pasta course is a house made spiral pasta in a vodka sauce.  It was extremely tasty.  So much so that my husband said he would have been happy if that alone had been his main course.  It had such incredible fresh taste.  \n\nFor our main courses, I got the veal chop prepared in the milanese style.  It was HUGE, pretty much the size of the plate.  A nice surprise considering how small portions tend to be at other fancy restaurants in the area.  It was served with a lemon butter sauce and had large chunks of crab on top.  It was tender and you could cut it with a fork.  I savored every bite (and have leftovers to enjoy at home).  My husband had the filet and loved his choice as well.  A lot of flavors and extremely tender.  It was served with a leek cream and I would love to know how they make it because I have leeks at home that I need to use for something.\n\nI swore I didn't have room left for even a single bite more, but when I learned that pumpkin gelato was the dessert, I had to try it.  It was so smooth, sweet and reminded me of the amazing gelato I had when I was in Italy.  A house made limoncello completed my incredibly amazing meal.\n\nYes, it is expensive, but it is worth it!  I don't know when we'll be back simply because of how expensive it is, but I do know we'll be back.", "business_id": "qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-10-30", "type": "review"}

It's been a few years, and we figured, the Saturday after Thanksgiving would be perfect for italian - a welcome break from turkey.\n\nUnexpected, and awful problem with our experience.\n\nOur party of nine was seated onetime for our 5 pm reservation.  Drink orders were taken, bread and assorted accoutrements of oil and such were brought to the table.  Waitress was pleasant, holiday tunes playing (over 6 separate speakers in the small upstairs bar/table area - quality sound, something I appreciate) and muted Penn State football game on the flat screen.  We were settled in for a good meal.  \n\nAppetizers arrived approximately an hour later.  They were quite good.  The 12 ounce meatball was fantastic.  It was covered in a great tomato sauce, and hit the spot.   We ordered the calamari, and even a second round of the prosciutto wrapped prawns.  Pasta arrived - it was good, but it should be at Ala Famiglia.  \n\nThe dinners arrived at 7:25.   Yes, it was a 5:00 reservation.  At least it gave our Brunello time to breath.   The portions were big.  Lots of veal dishes, rib eyes, and filets.   Non cooked too long, or too short.  \n\nSo why the mediocre review?  The long wait?  No.   We were in good company, and enjoyed being together.  The problem was the large number of fruit flies that were all over our table.  I first noticed them in one of the empty cocktail glasses.  They liked the remnants of the Manhattan - and the cherry left in the glass.   Three of them dead, two more flew away when I waived my hand.  \n\nThat caused me to look over at my wine glass holding the $140 per bottle Brunello......yep, one dead, and one alive.  What do you do?  I fished out the dead one, and covered my glass with a cocktail napkin.  This was pretty disgusting.  We mentioned it to the waitress, but she didn't respond or summon a manager.  Not looking for a free meal or anything, but as a business owner myself, I would think they would want to know about the problem, and get it rectified asap.  \n\nI like the food, but I won't likely be back.

The reason is simple, in reading the reviews below, I have to assume we hit Alla Famigilia on a bad night, at least I hope so.  The main reason for the low rating was the service.  We were seated on the third floor which is their bar area, at a high top table and the bar tender was our server.  She had to mix drinks for every table on the third floor, tend to the patrons at the bar and come around to wait on our table.  That was not fair to her and definitely not fair to us.  Her service and attentiveness lacked for obvious reasons but even when she was \"free\" she walked by our table without a glance and was apparently hard of hearing.  Furthermore, when ever one person got her attention for another drink or something, she said okay and left, without giving anyone else a chance to order.  The rest of the staff tried to pick up the slack a little but they were jammed as well.  Sounds weird, but I never felt so rushed in a 3 hour dinner.  The food took awhile, which is fine and expected on a busy Saturday night, just keep the drinks flowing and stop by once in a awhile so we don't notice.\n\nI also did not like that we were seated at a high top table.  I love the high tops for drinks and a few apps but for a 3 hour meal, these were uncomfortable, especially if your legs didn't hit the chair cross bars correctly (either too short or too tall).\n\nThe food was good, very good in some instances and disappointing in one.  I loved the pasta with Vodka sauce and the salad, both part of the entree which is unusual for a high end restaurant.  The meatball appetizer and the calamari and shrimp appetizer were the best things I ate all evening.  The biggest disappointment was the veal chop.  I love a good bone in veal chop but was leaning towards a seafood dish. I ended up changing my mind right before I ordered as I saw the veal chop brought out to another table and it looked amazing.  The disappointment was it was over-cooked.  It came out medium well at best (closer to well) and for $68, and for the amount they were serving that night, they should know how to cook them to perfection.  Not a spot of pink to be found.  No one even asked us during our meal if everything was okay or any issues.  When most of the chop remained on my plate and everyone else's entree was 90% eaten, not even a \"was everything okay\".  Just clear me out and get on with the next one.\n\nI hope to have the opportunity to go back and I will not be seated in the third floor bar area and I will not get my same waitress and give it another try.

Moving from LA recently where for some reason EVERYTHING is more expensive... except nail salons! Now, I am by no means, a spa rat but I do like to pamper the toes every now and again. So one afternoon when I had some spare time, I gave them a try. I was totally underwhelmed. From nail polish in the front with dust on it (how long have they been there?) To sitting in a spa chair with ripped upholstery I felt neither pampered nor impressed. I MIGHT have looked beyond such things because of the affordable price till I got home and realized that my nails hadn't been cut short as I had very clearly asked nor had she taking care of an ingrown toenail. A week later I had to cut my own toes and ruin my all right looking pedicure. This place doesn't feel clean or inviting. The decor was junkie and old and cluttered. I will say that everyone was very friendly and they did take me right away when I walked in. I was really pulling for you, Future Nails.

I've heard mixed reviews so I wanted to try it for myself. I tried to peruse the menu before ordering but I couldn't find it online anywhere which is disappointing because the hard copy they have available had at least 300 different options from apps, combos, sides, and entrees. \n\nI got their General Tso's Chicken (extra spicy) and because my order was a take-out over $12, they threw in two free egg rolls. #win \n\n(Other offers are Free 1 Small Fried Rice w/purchase of $16, Free General Tso's or Sesame Chicken w/purchase over $28)  \n\nI called on my way there and it took about 10-15 .... When I walked in, everything was ready to go. Large portion of chicken was served in plastic and rice was in standard paper folder container. They were not stingy about duck sauce, soy sauce, and fortune cookies. #win #win\n\nJust like the reviews below, the General Tso's was just so-so. It definitely wasn't extra spicy but it did have a mild kick to it. To me, the sauce tasted a bit like wing sauce from a dive bar. I would get it again because it was good but it didn't have an oriental flavor to it. When ordering from a strip mall Chinese food place, I always expect each piece of General Tso's to be a quarter chicken and the rest fatty breading to which I dissect and just eat the meat.  My expectations were met but I wasn't disappointed because the chicken was good. \nThe meal had a decent amount of broccoli in it which was cooked perfectly for my taste, a little firmer. \n\nThe egg rolls were OK. Super crispy and not much filling...plenty of oil. They were free and so I can't really complain.  \n\nI will definitely eat here again. I'll probably try Sha Cha chicken because it's spicier or Kung Po. This place is good if you want cheap food that will hit a Chinese take-out craving. \n\nEveryone that worked there was really nice - Even the chef in the back said hello. That alone goes a long way in my opinion. \n\nSide note - It's the day after and I'm not sick so I give my seal of health approval.", "business_id": "LltDzuzRbAJbSrqD4JH-3A", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-10-23", "type": "review"}

I have never had a bad experience here and the owner and staff are fabulous.  The North Side has struggled for years to try to gentrify and it's been a slow process. If more places like The Park House would open in the neighborhood the effect could be exponential.\n\nI've been a patron for just about a year on the dot.  I can honestly say that I drove by more than a few times and didn't stop (even though friends recommended it) because I didn't know what I would find.  Boy, I wish I had that time back!  \nI'll start with FREE... popcorn, peanuts in the shell, great people, and music - yes, live music for FREE.  And, it's all good. Now, to elaborate...\n\nI live in Lawrenceville and crossing a river to go to a place in Pittsburgh is nearly unheard of. But, the people here are so awesome, I can't stay away.  Young, old, hippies, hipsters, locals, and happen-uponers all converging to create an amazing atmosphere.  Last night, there was a woman and her family from Seattle in addition to the familiar faces I usually see.  As other reviewers mentioned, it is like CHEERS - it only takes a couple of visits before folks on both sides of the bar know your name and you!  \n\nOf course the free snacks are awesome, they're free - and you can just toss your peanut shells wherever you'd like (my mom would be horrified to watch me throw them on the floor :)  BUT, THE MENU... WOAH.  Zamir makes his own hummus, falafel, tabuouli, and golani.  OMG it's ALL FABULOUS!  Last week I tried the golani platter for the first time -- a golani patty, hummus, feta, and tomatoes, served with pita.  The golani made me smile - spinach, carrots, spices, cheese -- it makes you want to eat your veggies!  I really had to decide last night between the golani platter and the Peace in the Middle East (tabouli, hummus, falafel, pita).  I was really craving the \"falafel master\" delicacy, so Peace it was.\n\nBeer. Um, there is a lot of it... imports, crafts, and domestics.  If you can't find something to drink here then you must not be thirsty.  I think there are 20 taps... I've never actually counted, but a chalkboard boasts their fine selection (stop in and count them, and let me know).  I'm a micro dork and have always been completely overwhelmed by my choices during any given beer season.  Also, there is a \"worst beer\" (it's never bad) discounted selection and some \"last chance\" items that are usually around $4/bottle or glass. \n\nNow, music can be a tricky thing. But like everything else here, it's never steered me away.  Every Wednesday is a bluegrass jam in the rear of the establishment.  Mostly it's members of the Shelf Life String Band, but they are often joined by folks who just want to sit in and play.  You may hear some bluegrass versions of Radiohead, The Coasters, Gorillaz in addition to \"trad-grass\" favorites.  Every Friday night there is live music by local and touring musicians and, like the popcorn and peanuts, IT'S ALWAYS FREE!\n\nBring your appetite and your friends down for a night of great company and amazing atmosphere...

I thought about how well German potato salad would taste with that beer.  So I grabbed a seat at the bar and eagerly awaited the first taste of my beer.\n\nAnd I waited...and waited...and waited some more - for over 15 minutes before someone came around to take the order.  Actually that isn't quite accurate.  Two employees came around - one to the end of the bar, and one behind the bar directly opposite me.  Both of them stared at me.  Neither one greeted me or asked me what I would have like to order.  I stared back, incredulously, and even made a \"what's going on here\" palms-extended-upward-shoulder-shrug gesture.  Neither one took the hint.\n\nFinally a third employee came around the bar and took my order.  Great, I thought to myself, finally that beer.  She served the beer in a Mason jar.  WTF?!?  Who serves imported German lager at a German restaurant in a freaking Mason jar?  Max's does.  The beer was devoid of its head, likely the result of a bad beer pour and/or a less than perfectly clean glass (an endemic problem with Pittsburgh restaurants, in my observation).  I was sad.  I quaffed my beer quickly in an attempt to salve my irritation and opened the menu.\n\nMy first impression of the menu can be summed as follows: \"Uh-oh\".  The menu is huge with a number of \"slow-food\" stews and braises.  The restaurant is more than half-empty.  How can a restaurant prepare such a large number of menu items, including more than a few labor-intensive dishes, freshly every day and still stay in business when the place isn't even half-full?  Answer: They can't.  The food isn't fresh.\n\nI ordered the Wiener Schnitzel.  I love properly prepared Wiener Schnitzel.  Made with fresh butterflied veal breast, slightly pounded and seasoned, well-coated in fresh bread crumbs, and pan-fried in clarified butter until golden brown on the outside and juicy on the inside, Wiener Schnitzel is the ultimate comfort food.  \n\nSadly, Max's Wiener Schnitzel had nothing to do with properly prepared Schnitzel.  The veal was super-thin, had a texture that strongly suggested it had been mechanically processed, and tasted as if it was pre-breaded and frozen.  It wasn't pan fried either.  The breaded, frozen, puck was simply dropped into a fryolater - where the breading puffed out and fell off of the meat in places (which doesn't happen when the cutlet is resting against the cooking surface under its own weight as when the dish is properly pan-fried).  The edges of the sad Schnitzel had curled up and it looked a horrible mess on the plate.  Curly Schnitzel?!?  My stomach dropped.\n\nMy sides, German potato salad and braised red cabbage, were equally awful.  The German potato salad had an unnatural glossy sheen - the kind that typically comes from bottled sauces that contain high fructose corn syrup.  The \"bacon\" in the dressing was nothing more than tiny flecks of some sort of processed, possibly faux, \"meat\".  The potatoes were suspiciously uniform in thickness and roundness - exactly the homogeneity that is found in pre-peeled, pre-sliced, vacuum-sealed processed potatoes.  It was a gluey, sickly sweet, mess.  I didn't have more than a bite or two.  The braised red cabbage didn't taste fresh - it tasted like it had been sitting in a steam table for a day or two and my order was its last chance to be eaten.  \n\nMax's Allegheny Tavern bills itself on their web site as, \"The Best in German Fare.  The Best in Service\".\n\nThat's total bullshit.  It's awful - both for service and fare.\n\nIf you want good, authentic, German fare (in which the Schnitzel is properly pan-fried to order and delicious), join the Teutonia Mannerchor down the street.  \n\nI'll never return.", "business_id": "IxQ1ATP_Wg_QujO9nywzcQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2008-11-12", "type": "review"}

They were cozy, but the seats reminded me of old fashioned church pews. Our waitress soon brought us a little basket of four rolls with butter, sauerkraut relish, and apple butter. Though I liked the different varieties of bread, it was nothing special. The relish and apple butter were a nice touch though.\n\nOur waitress was busy with both waiting tables and tending the bar, but she managed to check on us pretty frequently. Our food also came out relatively promptly. I order the Wiener Schnitzel with Potato Pancakes and Spatzle on the side. The Wiener Schnitzel was amazing -- by far the best I've ever had! The veal was tender and the fried surface was perfectly crispy. However, the sides sadly did not match this main dish. The Potato Pancakes were oddly bitter, and I did not enjoy them with either the sour cream or applesauce. I only ate two or three bites and completely stopped eating them. (I must add that Hofbrauhaus's potato pancakes are delicious and something that I order every time that I go there.) I also did not enjoy the Spatzle, but I am accustomed to eating cheese Spatzle.... So I may be reviewing this harshly since I'm just not used to plain Spatzle, but in my opinion, it was terribly bland and watery.\n\nOverall, Max's Allegheny Tavern served one incredible item (Wiener Schnitzel), but everything else was merely mediocre. Because of this, I really don't plan on returning to the restaurant again any time soon. I'll be sticking with the fun environment and overall good food at Hofbrauhaus, actually.", "business_id": "IxQ1ATP_Wg_QujO9nywzcQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-11-04", "type": "review"}

My husband made the reservation with a special they were having for a dinner date night.  With the special, they give you a few Pittsburgh restaurants to choose from and you get a $50 voucher to that restaurant.  When my husband called the Priory, they said they would make the reservations and call us back on the time.  We never got a call about the reservation time which was annoying.  But the main issue was we checked in, talked to the girl at the front desk about having the shuttle take us to this reservation at Meat and Potatoes, and she set us up with the shuttle.  We go in the room, look around for the $50 voucher, and it's not in the room so we assumed (i know we should never assume) that it was taken care of with Meat and Potatoes when they  made our reservation.  We had a fabulous dinner at M&P, great food, great service, and the bill comes.  We asked the server about this Priory $50 voucher and he had never heard about it so the manager comes over and says they didn't give them anything but to have them call and ask for him and he'll work it out.  We called the Priory and told them this, the girl who answered gave us an attitude and said you should have asked for it.  Then refused to call M&P to talk to the manager.  She just said to pay the full bill and we can work it out when we get back to the hotel.  We gave the manager our phone and he was yelled at as well about this.  He took our word that the Priory would deliver it to him the next day and he deducted the $50 from our bill.  It was embarrassing and it wasn't the issue with the money, just the service with the priory.  This showed us two things: We won't be going back to the Priory due to the lack of service and lack of respect and we WILL be going back to M&P because their service was impeccable.", "business_id": "hBAcj7X5JHeX2hvmptwH-w", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-09-17", "type": "review"}

And...I was pretty underwhelmed. \n\nFor starters, a couple people definitely had problems ordering due to a poor connection or something like that. Fine. It happens. But then when our food eventually arrived the poor deliveryman told me that he had no idea how much my lunch cost. Fortunately, I'd gotten that info when I ordered.

I had ordered mozzarella sticks as an appetizer, but they did not impress me. The cheese was anything but gooey, and I ended up eating a couple sticks in one bite because the cheese simply wouldn't rip apart when I bit into it. The batter on the sticks also left a pretty bad aftertaste in my mouth, so much so that I chugged Coke after every bite to try to make up for it. \n\nAs for the sandwiches, my coworkers complained that their hoagies all came with too much mayo - one girl had even asked for her mayo to come on the side. No such luck: it came on her sandwich just like everyone else. As for me, the ranch I had asked to go with my buffalo chicken hoagie didn't even arrive. I used some from the company fridge. And the ranch was the only way I could eat the sandwich, which was drowning in buffalo sauce and could have been taken out of their toaster a lot sooner - entire sections of my sandwich's bread shouldn't break off when I bite into it, but that's what happens when you over toast something so badly...and is what happened here.\n\nI currently don't plan on ordering from this place again.

I know that sounds insane, but for reals, that Steak Burger blew my mind.  I never expected it to be so good.  I mean, I was just expecting your average burger.  Nope, once again Billy's impresses.  It's the perfect way to start a perfect night on the town.  \n\nThe service is always friendly and attentive, too, regardless of how busy they are.  And considering the quality of the meal and the great service, the prices are very reasonable.  With it's location not far from downtown but far enough away that you don't usually have to worry about a crowd, I'm surprised more people don't check it out before a show in the Cultural District.", "business_id": "6AnorAMPkTdSDbUkOoV1Rw", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-10-16", "type": "review"}

You enter though the bar and the dining room is on your right, this being a Sunday afternoon though, the dining room was not open. No biggie, I'll saddle up to the bar which seats about 12 people. The bartender was very nice, introduced herself and wanted to get to know me. \n\nThis seems like a mostly locals only bar, but they are very happy when people from outside the neighborhood stop in. One thing I heard several times while I was in there was \"Troy Hill is getting better, more people should come here and find out.\"\n\nI tried the soup of the day, chicken and corn chowder, and an order of their wings, $.60 during the Steelers games. Both were very good and made me want to come back to try more of the menu. The beer selection is a bit limited, they mostly stick with the big name domestics, but that being said, the beer is pretty darn cheap. Sam Adams Octoberfest was $2.50 a glass or $12 a pitcher! \n\nI'll certainly be back to Billy's and I think you should go too, turns out there are things on Troy Hill!", "business_id": "6AnorAMPkTdSDbUkOoV1Rw", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-10-14", "type": "review"}

That was cool. But on subsequent visits, the permanent galleries were equally impressive and even more pleasurable in their everyday arrangements. \n\nI might be mistaken, but I think that even everyday the paintings are hung above one another, not all in a straight line in a white box of a room, ala the Metropolitan's modern collection. \n\nI also think the furniture collection is pretty exciting and the Teenie Harris Collection and Project is fascinating. \n\nI will say, though, that in six years I was never once moved to go to any of the special exhibitions they hosted. \n\nI guess it's important to note, too, that the art and natural history museums are attached to one another (and located in Oakland), and one admission covers both. The fossilized dinosaur skeletons at the natural history museum are supposed to be amazing, but I OD-ed on dinosaurs somewhere around the second grade.

The years of renovation were worth it - the former dinosaur hall is completely transformed.  Remember how everything was in straight lines and the dinosaurs were up on their big pedestals?  Now the exhibit is sort of S-shaped, the walls are painted with colorful murals, the support columns are disguised as trees, there are plants around the dinosaurs and dead leaves underneath.  Underneath every dinosaur is a nameplate with a lot of information and a touchscreen with even MORE information, including a section on how the Carnegie Museum researchers contributed to the discovery or naming of this dinosaur.  There is a lot more natural light than I remember, and there are 2 balconies that overlook the exhibits for more photo opportunities.  There is also an extensive timeline of the Carnegie Museum's expeditions and contributions to paleontology, and a timelapse video of the renovations.\n\nThe cons: The rest of the history museum is pretty lame compared to this new and awesome exhibit.  The biggest examples are the 2nd floor Halls of African and North American Wildlife and the 3rd floor Birds hall.  Big cases of taxidermy in a wood-paneled room with dim lighting - hardly thrilling.  The 3rd floor Polar World is starting to look dated too.  Even the fonts used date the exhibits.\n\nAdmission is now $15 for adults, $11 for students (free for Pitt students!).  This does get you into the Carnegie Museum of Art also, but I'm usually tired after doing the whole history museum so I never get over to the art side.  I would recommend seeing the dinosaurs, then skipping the rest of the history museum if you've been there before.

I needed it to take a little break and I decided, what better way to get caught up on all the museums and cultural institutions in the 'Burgh?\n\nTo say that the Carnegie is THE Pittsburgh Cultural Institution is indeed an understatement and as I live in nearby Squirrel Hill, I am so happy to have it within walking distance.  Although the day I visited, I rode my bike and parked it all day.  (Note to Yelp'er Mike O. from Park Ridge, IL--I didn't wipe out this time!).\n\nI decided to spend the entire day at the Carnegie, and believe me it was worth it!  As Emily H. says, the Dinosaurs in their time was really worth it!  It went from being a stuffy, dull, \"stuffed and mounted\" exhibit to being a really neat walk-through one.  The murals really give the exhibit a sense of time and place.  The exhibit shows how the plants, mammals, fish, and insects that surrounded them continue to evolve and create the biological diversity that surrounds us today.\n\nA long-time favorite of mine is the Hillman Hall of Minerals and Gems.  I've always loved the bright colors of the gems and could stand there for hours in hushed awe of these beautiful stones.  The museum just added the Wertz Gallery of Gems and Jewelry to the Hillman Hall.  The gallery has an extensive collection of birthstones, giving the history of each and how birthstones came to be.  The current special exhibit is the watches and timepieces from H.J. Heinz, including a stunning music box and watch piece.\n\nBut as much as I enjoy natural science, I really love art.  The Carnegie Museum of Art includes  American art from the late nineteenth century, French Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings, and European and American decorative arts.   The Heinz Architectural is dedicated to the collection, study, and exhibition of architectural drawings and models.  I particularly enjoy Asian art and the Carnegie has an extensive collection of Japanese prints.  \n\nOne special exhibit that I really recommend will be there only until October 18, 2008 and it is \"Abstract Art before 1950: Watercolors, Drawings, Prints, and Photographs\".  It consists of avant-garde works by European, American, and Japanese artists.  \n\nSo while the admission fee is $15.00, it does include both the Natural History Museum and the Museum of Art.  To get your money's worth, plan on staying a whole day.

I was also impressed by the bird collection.  We were both a little disappointed at the botany display, which was only one smallish room.  I noticed that in a few of the displays, cards indicated that a certain number of artifacts were supposed to be on display, but some had been removed with no explanation or updating to the information.  Or maybe someone stole them and the museum hasn't noticed yet!!\n\nIn terms of natural history museums, I think we have been spoiled for all others by the Field Museum in Chicago.\n\nWe spent the afternoon on the art side, and only managed to get through a couple of the modern art displays before becoming overwhelmed.  There was one film about migration in the modern art room which we both really enjoyed.  I found the art involving the venetian blinds and various types of light bulbs to be fascinating.  We spent the last hour of our time upstairs in the Ancient Egypt exhibit.  Unfortunately, there seemed to be a corporate event happening that afternoon which involved a scavenger hunt; if you think that children's field trips and scavenger hunts are annoying, imagine a whole herd of businessmen and women on a scavenger hunt, and not using their indoor voices, either.\n\nOther than that, the museums were both quite pleasant and not too crowded.

The worst thing about this place is also Sam.\n\nWhat was great was that Sam made me feel at home and treated me like someone he had known for a long time. He took me to the back of his warehouse, gave me a free beer to drink, and engaged me in plenty of conversation. At one point, though, he said, \"You look oriental, but you also look American.\" I'm pretty sure he wasn't meaning for it to be offensive, and I just discounted it as his being an old man who didn't know it was no longer politically correct to say things like that.\n\nThis is not why I recommend against Caruso's, however. The reason why I'll never go there again is because Sam knowingly sold me expired beer.\n\nI was on my way back from the North Side to the East End where I live and after seeing these good reviews, I decided to stop by. I wanted a case of Yuengling, but Sam said, \"Why don't you try this instead,\" and popped open a fresh bottle of Castello, an Italian beer. He had me drink it, all the while espousing its comparative taste to Yuengling at a cheaper price point. It certainly tasted alright, and a case of it was a couple dollars less than what Yuengling was going for.\n\nSince the Castello tasted fine, I ended up buying a case of it on Sam's recommendation. A few days later when I opened the box and drank a couple of the beers, however, I noticed that they tasted funny. That's when I looked at the label and saw how each of the bottles had its \"sell by\" date marked out in black Sharpie. You could see the numbers underneath the Sharpie, and the dates were for well over two years ago. So basically, Sam had convinced me to buy something he hadn't been able to sell, knowing that I lived in the East End and probably wasn't going to visit again anyway.\n\nStale beer aside, there's another big reason not to go to Caruso's: Their prices are steep--$24 for a case of Yuengling. While Sam might be a more charming character than the young folks at my neighborhood distributor Pistella's, at least I know that Pistella's has significantly lower prices and actually has enough customers and product turnover that they won't purposely sell me something that's not fresh.", "business_id": "zq--BGVHu7_fb1VHEwg2ow", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-10-15", "type": "review"}

Nonetheless, all were quite tasty and better than I would have imagined a simple cheese platter would be.  \n\nI ordered fish tacos which were quite tasty and my husband ordered the pork tenderloin, the Novemberfest special, which was also tasty from the bite I acquired from him, as were the squash bites I \"stole\".  \n\nService:  Greeted immediately upon arrival and ushered to our table right away, despite being very early for our reservations.  Offered drinks as soon as we arrived at our table and our server was always there when needed but not pushy when we weren't in need.\n\nAmbience:  We sat in the small dining area next to the bar and near the stage.  Cozy, quaint, warm feel to it.  Nice venue to hear the jazz band while still being able to carry on a quiet conversation.\n\nEntertainment:  I've been trying to like jazz for awhile now and not all that successfully.

I had wanted to dine at Atria's for their Oktoberfest menu, and with Saturday night being the last of October, I made reservations for a friend and I at the PNC Park location.  Just to be sure, I called the restaurant and asked if the location was featuring the Oktoberfest menu.  The girl who answered assured me that they were. \n\nWhen we checked in, I again asked if they were doing the Oktoberfest menu, and again was assured they were although they did not give me the special menu which was sitting next to the regular menu at the host's podium.\n\nI didn't see any of the Oktoberfest specials listed on the menu, so I asked our server, a pleasant young man named Qwan about it.  He told me that the O specials were listed in a box on the lower left hand corner of the menu.  When I questioned the skimpy selection given there, he told me that they were not featuring the entire Oktoberfest menu on weekends at that location, but only a selection of appetizers and small plates.  He told me that all other locations were featuring the whole menu.   He seemed surprised and disinclined to believe me when I told him that that was not satisfactory, especially in light of the fact I had called to check and had been told that the special menu was being offered, and that we would be leaving. I got on Open Table and secured a reservation for dinner at their Wexford location, a half-hour's drive out of town. I didn't speak to anyone from the restaurant's management because we had to leave to make our reservation time at the Wexford location.\n\nIt is certainly any restaurant's right to serve whatever menu or part of a menu they wish, but they should also inform people when they call if they are not honoring the complete published special menu advertised.  \n\nThe food and service at the Wexford location were acceptable other than a spinach salad that arrived only after I had asked about it and without the warm sweet and sour dressing advertised on the menu.  They had also run out of the apple strudel that was on the menu, but that's always a chance you take on a popular menu item.", "business_id": "Z101WZaISochG6g7tI2ZVw", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-11-01", "type": "review"}

My all time fave is the Chiefs and my hometown team is the Bills but I'll always have a plecial space in hy meart for the Stittsburgh Peelers. They sure know how to get an orange ready to eat, you know? Or a potato.\n\nFirst-Hand Experience: I've seen the Steelers play both home and away, and they won every single time. I saw them at Three Rivers. I saw them at Heinz. I saw them play in Cinci. Every single time I see them live in person, they win. And they win Superbowls too, whenever I happen to be watching. If I'm not watching (cough cough Packers) they lose. So all in all, the Steelers and I are connected and I absolutely love them, just like I love the Bills, Chiefs and Patriots. Why are all the teams I love in the damn AFC?\n\nNow that I've seen every NFL team play live & been to every NFL stadium (current and former), time to review them on Yelp! I love stadiums! I've been to every cool stadium in the UK & North America, due to my obsession with travel & sport. I've toured America as a musician for 7 years. In that time, I've seen sports games at (or visited when empty, or both) almost every major stadium in US and Canada. I have pictures of most which I'll upload at some point.

Maybe I think they're sexy because Pittsburgh girls are sexy, and almost always wear black and gold. I've never seen so much of a city wearing the same team colors, it's awesome. Did I mention I love Pittsburgh girls.\n\nI love the University. I nearly went there but then got a free ride elsewhere. I love the Cathedral Of Learning. I love the city, it's incredible. I love the stadium.\n\nYou could do a little to be a little more friendly, but then I could say the same about NYC or Philly or even Buffalo. Oh and you have some amazeballs food here. And the view from the West End is just spectacular. You can see the stadium and everything, it's stunning. I love going up there, night or day. Amazing views all over the city. Cool glass castle. And so on.\n\nI love all the trick plays you guys would run on your amazing Superbowl runs.\n\nOK enough.\n\nIf you want good food in Pitt try these:\n\nMike and Tony's Gyro\nMorty's Steakhouse Burger from Burgatory and their shakes too\nTacos from outside Las Palmas on Brookline\nPizza from Fioris Pizzaria\nBluberry Pancakes from Pamela's P & G Diner\nAnything from Kelly O's\nChocolate Malt w/Caramel shake and Fresh Lemonade from Handel's\nCoconut shake from there too\n\nThat's all I can remember for now.\n\nBut if you ever go down a mine and there are insects, don't worry.

But the last time you went to the post season was in 1992,  and I remember it well.    I worked as a ticket taker at the old Three Rivers Stadium and I have such fond memories of working there.  I was 17 when you won your last divisional title and I don't think you've had a winning season in my entire adult life.\n\nDon't get me wrong, my Bucs!  I do love you so much.  In a way, I have to.  See, you're like the boy I knew in grammar school who was such a sweet kid, but he was constantly failing his classes--and he lived in a nice house!  \n\nLet's take a look at your records since 2000.  I warn you dear Pirates--it won't be pretty.  But it's something you have to come to terms with:\n\n2001:  62-100 (last pl)\n2002:  72-89 (4th Pl)\n2003:  75-87 (4th pl)\n2004:  72-89 (5th pl)\n2005:  67-95 (last)\n2006:  67-95 (5th pl)\n2007:  68-94 (last)\n2008:  67-95 (last)\n2009:  62-99 (last)\n2010:  56-101 (last)*     *As of 09-29-2010\n\nSo that's six seasons in last place, two 100 loss seasons, and this season has been the worst so far.\n\nYes, I'll still go to your games next season.  I'll still go with my husband, my co-workers, and my Girl Posse.  My dad and I will still have our father-daughter nights out here.

WTF man, weren't we in first place at the All-Star Break?  What happened?  I wasn't expecting a World Series Champ or even a Pennant winner.  But was a winning season too much to ask for?  This marks the 20th anniversary since the Pirates' last winning season.  That's right folks--it's been since 1992.  Let's take a look at the world of 1992.\n\nBASEBALL:  The Pirates' roster that year included Stan Belinda, Doug Drabek, Zane Smith, Denny Neagle, Jay Bell, Orlando Merced, Andy Van Slyke, and of course Barry Bonds.  All have since retired.  The only new ballparks were New Comiskey Park (now U.S. Cellular Field) and Camden Yards.  No stadiums had corporate names.  The Arizona Diamondbacks, the Colorado Rockies, the Miami Marlins, and the Tampa Bay (Devil) Rays didn't exist.  The Washington Nationals were the Montreal Expos.  The Milwaukee Brewers were in the AL.  Both the NL and the AL only had two divisions each.  The minor league Washington Wild Things didn't exist either and nor did their league.  KBL was the big cable sports channel.\n\nTV:  \"Saturday NIght Live's\" cast included Dana Carvey, Ellen Cleghorne, Chris Farley, Tim Meadows, Mike Myers, Kevin Nealon, Phil Hartman,  Chris Rock, Adam Sandler, Rob Schneider, and David Spade.  \"Seinfeld\" hadn't become a huge hit yet and no one knew Kramer's first name.  Monday nights on NBC included \"Murphy Brown\", \"Evening Shade\" and \" Northern Exposure\".\n\nMOVIES:  The top movies included \"Lethal Weapon 3\", \"Basic Instinct\", \"Hone Alone 2\", \"The Bodyguard\" and \"Aladdin\".  When you wanted to watch movies at home, you had to rent them from the video store and you watched them on VHS tapes or laserdiscs.  \n\nMUSIC:  Bruce Springsteen released \"Lucky Town\" and \"Human Touch\"  on the same day.  R.E.M. had \"Automatic for the People\".  Gin Blossoms released their first album \"New Miserable Experience\", which stayed on the charts for almost two years.  Bare Naked Ladies \"Gordon\" featured the cult classic \"If I Had a Million Dollars.\"  You either listened to albums on cassette or CD and you bought them at record stores like National Record Mart.  Doug Hopkins (Gin Blossoms), Kurt Cobain (Nirvana), Shannon Hoon (Bline Melon) and Jerry Garcia (Grateful Dead) were all alive.\n\nTECHNOLOGY:  Few people had internet access.  You also used pay phones because you didn't have a cell phone.  You watched movies on a VCR.  You met up with your friends without texting them.  You ordered merchandise by \"sending in\" or by calling an \"800\" number.  You had to buy tickets by waiting in line.  \n\nAnd OJ Simpson was still a football hero.\n\nSo that's it, Pittsburgh Pirates.  I feel like telling you I'm done with you guys.  I'm no fair weather fan, but 20+ years of losing is enough.", "business_id": "fB7XYJYrTtchlTmzSQVMbQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-10-02", "type": "review"}

Generally, even though they weren't busy, everyone seemed as though they'd rather be somewhere else. I asked whether their beef was USDA Choice, the butcher responded that it was angus beef. There was no sign that it was \"certified angus beef,\" which is only choice or prime grade, so I can only assume that was referring to the breed of cattle, and had ignored my request for the grade of beef being used.

My family and I tend to shop at Giant Eagle, partly because of the large size of their stores and partly because of their GetGo rewards. Kuhn's has somehow become the place we stop when we don't have time to drive to Giant Eagle. \n\nWhich is totally a shame, because whenever I DO stop in here I'm reminded about how nice the place actually is. Today a simple trip for milk turned into a fall-themed decoration shopping spree that went really well (yay super cute owl pillows!) and I ended up picking some breakfast and lunch items as well just because of how cheap they were. I know from past experience that the produce is fresh, and between the wonderful aroma and colorful display the bakery here is absolutely torturous to pass. There's also a ready-made dinner/lunch shelf with sandwiches, chicken wings, pizzas and a few dessert items if you want to grab those on your way out; I've actually gotten dinner here a few times on my way home from the city when I was too tired to cook. What's not to like about affordable and delicious food, right?\n\nHowever, there is at least one thing that does keep me from wanting to be a regular here and giving Kuhn's a 5 star review: the blasted parking lot you have to deal with to go here, which I've cursed in other reviews. This lot is the one that fills up super quickly, creates miniature traffic jams like no one's business, and is a time-stealing trap. Sigh. Suddenly I think I understand why my family always goes to Giant Eagle.\n\nSorry, Kuhn's. Your prices are wonderful, your set-up fantastic, and your options well varied and impressive.

Now if you take it home the cheese will melt,(by the way this is the best cold breakfast pizza you'll ever have!) but if you do like locals do, you'll eat it there and enjoy it the way it's supposed to be eaten. The bread fresh from the oven, cold, full fat mozzarella spread on top. Then when you order a slice or two, some very nice Beto pizza chef with a heavy hand will put at least a quarter pound of cheese on each slice. I must get to Beto's soon and have a slice or two and think back to childhood memories and dad.", "business_id": "93UCt9OgWYmypZCpXtUu8g", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-09-02", "type": "review"}

As they may be stunning to behold, from afar each one is pretty much the same thing. This shop is another place that tosses sauce and cheese on bread and serves it to their patrons. Ok, so they DO have a slightly different take, throwing the cold shredded cheese onto the pie as soon as the dough is out of the oven. This does not melt the cheese, and I do see how the pizza would be cold after heaping on the cheese.  Some customers may like it, me, not so much. I tried the Italian hoagie.  It was a good size and the meat was flavorful. But that's about it. They put oil on the sandwich, but no other dressing. I expected a nice tangy flavor to compliment the meat but was disappointed. My date ordered a hot sausage hoagie. I didn't sample it, he liked it, but it was way too messy. The bread got soggy and the darn thing fell apart. It looked more like tomato soup with sausage than a sandwich.  The staff did seem pretty nice, even trying to keep a smile while dealing with the stress of a busy crowded restaurant. The dining room is also a bit cramped. There are plenty of booths, but the tables are rather close together and hard to maneuver between. Hungry patrons also are constantly getting up to visit the soda fountain.

They should really have an illuminated sign that advises the customers.\n\n I'm sure you have gathered that this pizza is kind of presented exactly like frozen pizza from the store except the bread is cooked. I think the appeal to this place is that it is different - Some people go to restaurants where you can cook your own food because it's different but the fact of the matter is that when I go out to eat, I don't expect to cook it myself and I don't expect it to come half cooked. \n\nHad this pizza been cooked, I feel like it would be subpar. The crust was very crispy and the sauce was a standard tomato (no extra hints of basil or pepper). The peperoni reminded me of the peperoni that comes in Lunchables - actually the whole pizza reminded me of a Lunchable (except a pie made of 28 cuts is $35.28 with $.50 per topping a CUT!) To be fair, each cut is $1.30 and you only need 3-4 to really, really be full.  They really lay on the toppings - about an inch of cheese, 20 slices of peperoni and a handful of banana peppers for just two cuts with toppings\n. \nI feel that you really need to be in the mood for Betos before you go there. When I am in the mood for pizza, I am heading for the flowing, stringy cheese and the flavors melting together before it hits my mouth.

Now, while I've never left the shop empty handed and I LOVE browsing the fantastic and varied beer selection here, I have admittedly had trouble finding specific favorite beverages of mine, such as flavors of Magner or even varieties of Blue Moon. But I think this has more to do with my taste (remember, not the biggest beer person, more of a cider/wine person) than the shop itself - you can always at least find the basic ciders and beers here. And again, I've never left empty handed despite my snobby tastes: usually I leave with a whole case of Woodchuck, and most recently a whole case of Fall Woodchuck. Yum! Also, the men behind the desk are usually pretty good about asking if you need a hand taking things to your car. (Usually.)\n\nStill, the parking situation here keeps me from giving the place 4 stars. Getting into the lot here can be a little frightening as you hope the person behind you is paying attention and slowing down while you turn into the lot. The lot itself is pretty tiny so problems can arise if too many people stop in for beer at once. Finally, getting out is even more terrifying than pulling in, because no one slows down on Banksville, ever, to let you out. Be prepared to sit for a few minutes if traffic is heavy.\n\nHappy shopping, beer lovers!", "business_id": "cRv7pLvIe3eI0efndQBcLg", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-09-10", "type": "review"}

Every year their line-up changes and it always features an incredible variety of shows. I've seen a classics such as \"Antony and Cleopatra\" to the interesting (but potentially uncomfortable) \"In the Next Room (or The Vibrator Play).\" My outright favorite evening with PICT was during a premiere of a play named \"Our Class,\" which was an incredibly shocking but important play about, sadly, real events: a WWII mass murder of the Jewish community living in a town in Poland. No one wanted to speak during or after that show, and the actors handled the roles and portrayal of both inhumane actions and traumatic events incredibly and impressively well. Kudos to them and all of PICT for tackling such an imposing but important project.\n\nI have plans to see at least one more if not two more PICT performances this year; not once have they disappointed me, and their contributions to the theater scene in this city are always outstanding.

We browsed for a while and found a chandelier we liked, and my husband took a picture of it on his cell phone. The salesclerk told us that was not allowed. We were dumbfounded. We are renovating a house and need a number of light fixtures, plumbing fixtures, etc.-- the only way we can keep track of them all (and check if they actually might look good together) is to photograph everything we're seriously considering. We tried to explain this and the clerk said nope, not allowed. We asked why. She said, \"I don't know-- they just don't allow it.\" Well I bet I know-- they don't want you going online in search of better pricing. But hey, NEWSFLASH-- that's how things work in 2012. I'm not going to drop $1,200 on a chandelier without looking it up online. (For the record, I understand that local businesses aren't usually going to have the lowest price available. I don't mind paying a bit of a premium to support a small business in Pittsburgh that gave me great in-person service. But like hell am I going to spend that kind of money without making sure I'm not getting completely ripped off.)\n\nWe tried to press further, though-- what about matching finishes or colors to other fixtures? The salesclerk said, \"Oh, people just tell us what colors they have in their room and how big the room is and we tell them what works.\" I'm sorry, but unless you're omniscient, this is not acceptable. \n\nThe most insulting thing, though, is the clerk telling us \"I don't know\" about a policy that's so clearly the exception to the local norm.

What I heard was true after dining here- food is really good, service leaves a lot to be desired. Two of us were the first to arrive for a party of six. We waited a good 10 minutes at the \"please wait to be seated sign\". No one even acknowledged us standing there until two other members of our party finally arrived. They were semi busy but cleared out quickly since it was a 4:25 steelers game and several tables there looked like they were heading to the game. Anyways, a server came over about 5 minutes after we were sat. To get our drink order. She was pretty slow getting our drinks out to us. The other two members of our party arrived by then and when she came back she said the kitchen was running 30 minutes behind and we should order appetizers now if we wanted any. Ok so we ordered 6 old bay wings, 12 thai chili wings, and 2 orders of the cheese sticks. The cheese sticks were the best cheese sticks I have ever eaten! They are huge-3 to an order but these are so thick and gooey....and the marinara served with them is a sweeter marinara, it's very good. I didn't try the old bay wings but they were quickly devoured by the rest of the table. The Thai chili wings had a very nice sweeter flavor. And they were large wings too. Very tasty. She came to take our food order prior to our appetizers coming out. They did take awhile but she did warn us they were slow. Entrees came out quickly however. I had ordered the BBQ pulled pork sandwich. It had a horseradish BBQ sauce that sounded really interesting. The server came over halfway through the appetizers and said they ran out of the pulled pork. I was disappointed but I ordered a turkey Rachael with sweet potato waffle fries instead. The sandwich came on marble rye with coleslaw Swiss and thousand island. The fries weren't great and we're kind of soggy. The sandwich though was excellent. Real rotisserie turkey and lots of cold slaw which is how I like it. A steak and egg hoagie was ordered with chips-she said it was really good and it was huge portion wise. Another ordered the pastrami sandwich and another ordered the pastrami salmon blt. Both were said to be tasty. The quesadilla burger and the bacon and blue cheese burger were also ordered and were quickly eaten and said to be delicious . 4 of us took home half of our sandwiches - portions are huge! Our server didn't check on us and it was us who had to flag he down for drinks. This is a great place to watch a game, lots of beers on tap, good food.

In very large part, because *everything* on the menu is made fresh daily.  This includes the ham, which the restaurant roasts every morning, complete with their own glaze.  The ham is cut from the bone to order, absolutely succulent, with a hint of clove.  The ham alone is reason enough to visit this place, but that isn't even the best offering.\n\nFirst are the pancakes, which includes specialty pancakes like apple and cinnamon and pumpkin - all of which (including buttermilk pancakes) are among the very best pancakes I've ever eaten.  The batter is prepared fresh every morning.  They have a slightly crispy exterior (plenty of butter and sugar in the batter) and fluffy center.  The apple and cinnamon pancakes are so good that I don't even eat them with syrup lest I mask the subtle flavors of cinnamon, cream, vanilla, and apples in the batter - a dusting of powdered sugar and a smear of half-melted butter is all that's needed to elicit an involuntary eyes-rolling-into-the-back-of-the-head expression of pleasure.  Seriously, these pancakes are DAMN good!\n\nSecond, all the egg entrees are fabulous!  Try the eggs benedict - that juicy ham, fresh cut from the bone, piled high atop two thick slabs of toasted Italian bread, topped with sunny-side-up eggs, and freshly prepared hollandaise.  Fantastic.  The omelets are great, and the \"jumbot\" - an \"everything in the prep table\" hash of stuff and scrambled eggs will satisfy the heartiest of diners.\n\nThe food here is really top-notch.  I realize that it's just a diner, but when I see and taste food this good, and this lovingly prepared, I want to see *everything* as perfect as most of the food.  With that in mind, I'd really like to see the restaurant offer real maple syrup - not the imitation \"table syrup\" stuff that I've seen them pour from a milk-carton-type paper container into the syrup bottles!  I'd gladly even pay a $1 premium to have real syrup with those delectable pancakes.  Also, I'd beg them to consider making their own biscuits, and possible serving them with a sausage (or sausage and herb?) gravy.  I'd *crawl* to the Dor-Stop from my home to eat there!\n\nThis place is PACKED on the weekends - be prepared to wait unless you get there very early.  The wait, however, will be worth it.  I eat here at least once nearly every weekend for breakfast.", "business_id": "2Igiyhi82R8_QaaPplRmCw", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-11-12", "type": "review"}

Instead of going to our standby, the Original Pancake house, I suggested we try the Dor-Stop. We arrived at 12:30 and were soon joined by the 3rd person in our party. The hostess informed us that we were next on the list for a table and would be seated soon. I was surprised at how busy it was on a holiday. This small little diner was packed with people. Every table was full as well as every seat at the counter. About ten minutes later, a waitress came over and called two parties that arrived after us. My husband had to go talk to her and explain how we were waiting longer. She apologized for skipping us and was able to seat us right away. Once seated, I had a difficult time deciding what to order from the extensive menu. Wow! They have a huge selection. \n\nI finally decided on the special, Apple Harvest French toast with bacon. When I asked the waitress about the special, she had a difficult time describing it but I still wanted to give it a try. Once we ordered, it took well over 15 minutes for our food. I understand that they were very busy but that amount of time did seem a bit excessive for diner food. When my french toast arrived, it was not exactly what I was expecting per the description but, it was very tasty. The french toast had a nice crisp on it and the cream cheese sauce had a lot of flavor. However, for being APPLE harvest french toast, it was certainly lacking apples or apple flavoring. This french toast would have been perfect with slices of cooked apples on top instead of the small apple pieces that were mixed in with the cream cheese. The bacon also lacked a nice crispiness. \n\nI also had the opportunity to try my husband's banana chocolate chip pancakes. Although they looked delicious with the bananas and chocolate chips baked into the pancakes, they tasted rather salty. My husband agreed with my assessment. It seemed like the cook was a little heavy handed when adding salt to the batter.

It was several years ago that I first came upon The Dor-Stop, and since then my breakfast lifestyle has been forever changed.\n\nI know this will sound like blasphemy coming from a Dor-Stop convert, but I hate pancakes. I just don't understand them, they are odd and moist, and nowhere near as delicious as waffles. I came into The Dor-Stop the first time with this mindset, and am now forever changed. \n\nThe Dor-Stop's hotcakes are delicious and almost cake-like. They aren't thin crepes, or undercooked globs of batter, but instead sweet, fluffy treats that come in a plethora of flavors. I personally endorse oatmeal walnut, but others love the banana or pumpkin (when in season). I recommend ordering the \"Egg Combo\": 2 hot cakes, eggs, and bacon/sausage. Go all out, you deserve it. \n\nOn a recent visit, I also discovered the french toast menu, which has caused me to forsake my hot cake habit. The french toast is almost deep fried and covered in this raspberry yogurt. It is a can't miss item on the menu, rivaling that of the hot cake. When pumpkin french toast is a special on the menu, I suggest you run to The Dor-Stop and taste a little of heaven. \n\nI've also sampled various items from the lunch menu with no complaints. The Rachel and Ruben are especially tasty if you feel like bypassing the breakfast menu. \n\nThis place is truly heaven in Dor-Stop.

They use thick Texas toast and ham cut off the bone. I'm from MI and grew up on Honey Baked Ham so trust me when I say, dor stop has some good ham. \n\nIf you're having a sweet tooth kinda day you have to have the raspberry french toast.

Now, of course she would gladly take the chocolate (but me being mom say no with breakfast) they will not add bananas to the pancakes.

But hey, they definitely deserve it! In fact Dor-Stop is so good that I came here two days in a row a couple weekends ago - once for a sit-down meal, and once to get a meal to-go just so I could try a second item on the menu.\n\nI actually hadn't eaten at Dor-Stop in years until earlier this month - their hours and my schedule don't tend to mesh. But one afternoon I just happened to be using 1/2 a vacation day, so I came with a family member. Since it was the middle of the day on a Friday, the place was fairly empty, which I definitely didn't mind - this place is pretty cozy and so it gets cramped quickly during weekend dining rushes.\n\nBut on to the food, the important part of this review! My dining companion ordered a salad - complete with French fries, 'cause that's how we do salads in Pittsburgh - and I ordered their Feta Burger. Sure, their Raspberry stuffed french toast caught my eye...but Feta burger! How often do you see that on the menu? And I loved that burger, by the way - it was well cooked and the toppings blended perfectly (I snagged a few mushrooms from my companion's salad which made it even better), and definitely felt like good diner food. I left feeling super happy with my meal.\n\nBuuuuut...the next day I still couldn't get that french toast of my mind. I just couldn't. So I called in an order for pick-up - good thing I did, too, because there was nowhere to sit when I came in! Saturdays are definitely jam-packed here, understandably so. Well, I got my food, brought it home, and proceeded to devour it. Just, YUM! Seriously - that french toast is a MUST!\n\nIf I was going to complain about anything it would be that the seating really isn't the most comfortable on the planet, buuuuut...I can't hold it against them. I just can't. Not after that french toast. See you next time, Dor-Stop!", "business_id": "2Igiyhi82R8_QaaPplRmCw", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-11-24", "type": "review"}

So when my roomate wanted to go there, I was pretty excited. There were 4 of us. Two of us had burgers while the other two ordered wedding soup and shared potato skins. My burger was delicious. It was juicy and smothered in bleu cheese. \n\nWhile my food was really good, there were some issues with the other items ordered. Two of my guests cited that the wedding soup had a metalic taste to it while my other friend with the burger found a hair. Being a hairdresser and understanding that it does happen sometimes, she disregarded it and continued to eat her burger. Unfortunately, the hair did not stop there. Another guest found several hairs in their meal as well. We decided that we should let our waitress know. I stopped the waitress and explained how there was hair in two people's food. The waitress got upset and was very rude (it's not like we accused her of planting the hair herself). On top of this, she mistakenly took my burger and walked away with it, leaving the sullied food on the table. When she came back I told her that my burger was not one of the items with food on it and she instantly became defensive. At this point we asked for a manager (who never came) and insisted our meal get comped. Considering she threw out the only good food that we ordered, we didn't feel like that was asking too much. Luckily the waitress did not put up too much of a fight. \n\nI will never eat at Bado's again. A good cheese burger and a decent pie isn't enough when the staff can't even accept their own (human) mistakes. I have been places where there have been food issues before and I have also worked in a restaurant. I completely understand that mistakes happen. However, the reaction that we received was unacceptable.", "business_id": "qemCNgjeYGcFsRwxW9x4xw", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-09-26", "type": "review"}

I want around seven on a Monday night, also Columbus Day if that has any impact, and there was really no crowd.  My server, Barry, was very nice and was very good.\n\nRight off the bat, I'll explain why am taking two stars away. The service was a little bit too fast for me between my two courses as within maybe three minutes of my salad being taken away my pizza came right out. Normally I'm a fan of fast service but that was a little bit too fast for me. I'm also taking a star off, and whoever reads this review will probably think this is a stupid reason but this review is my opinion, because the salads with the exception of a few or overpriced compared to the other appetizers.\n\nI had the grilled portobello mushroom salad and the 4 cut margherita pizza. \n\nThe salad was huge but great, the house Italian dressing complemented the salad really well. The salad was a nice mix of mushroom and greens, though I'd have preferred a bigger helping of greens. Of course you're not going to like this salad if you don't like mushrooms. \n\nThe pizza was tasty and pretty well done. Oh my goodness was it tasty. You could really taste the tomatoes and basil playing off each other and neither was overpowered by the cheese. Secondly, the tomatoes tasted fresh, not like the canned, heavily processed kind or tomato paste but like the diced San Marzanno organic tomatoes you can buy at fancier grocery stores. That went a long way for me with the pizza. \n\nThe con for the pizza: I have to say it was weird to me that the crust was this weird mix of crispy and kind of hard to cut and then perfectly chewy. The actual bottom of the pizza was crispy, like it should be so the pizza doesn't fall apart, but it was a little too crispy for my tastes as there were a couple points where I had a hard time cutting the pizza into bite-size pieces. I also have to comment that two of my slices, the two that I ended up bringing home because I was stuffed, hadn't been fully cut apart and that was a little annoying. I can overlook it, but it's still something I want to comment on.\n\n\nThis isn't the kind of pizza that you can easily just pick up and eat with your hands because there is so much to it. It's a very dense pizza. \n\nI want to end this review by commenting on the slightly weird pricing for the pizzas. The pizza is priced based off of how many slices the pizza is cut into. And, I feel the pizza was a little bit pricey for the four slice pizza that I got, it was just under $13. \n\nThat all said though I had a fun time at Bado's and I'll go back.", "business_id": "qemCNgjeYGcFsRwxW9x4xw", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-10-12", "type": "review"}

While most people wouldn't complain I was little upset having to throw away what felt like a pound of meat because there's no way any human can handle that much in one sitting.

I came in July (2013) with a non standard proportion large photograph print. With the help of the staff I picked out what I thought was going to be a gorgeous job! For a beach photo we choose a sandy mat and a texturized frame that was mostly a tan with a lot of black and white and gold accents. It was up there price wise ($400), but I was so in love and I knew it wasn't going to be cheap in general! They told me it'd be done in two weeks and I was shocked. I got a call about two weeks later to come in because the frame we picked wasn't the same when it came in from the supplier :(. It was totally plain and not what we looked at! They knew immediately if they had put it together with that I would not be happy! They offered me to look at other frames and we spent a good hour or so looking at other frames and I still wasn't finding anything. We picked one and he said he was going to talk to the supplier to see if they'd give it to me at the same price. ALSO, on top of that they painted and texturized it many many times themselves. They called me in to check out a sample before they went ahead with the whole frame. They did tell me I should have no problem with it being done by Sept 19th, which I was having ankle surgery and wouldn't be able to after. I called a couple times checking in and they did explain to me that it took A LOT of painting, drying, and sandy to get it just right. Plus they were busy as well. It ended up being done towards the end of September (2013) and they held onto it no problem until mid October (2013) for me. They also helped me carry it to my car (I was still in a boot). They are very nice and pleasant, but not terribly social or energetic. All in all I got an AMAZING product for probably a fraction of the price! The time wasn't a huge deal for me, but anyone who is in a hurry might want to keep it in mind. I didn't have a problem waiting for a quality product.

Prices are SO reasonable, especially at a time when it's tough to find great food for a reasonable price in this city. The best feature of D's is their beer cave to the rear of the restaurant. While your dinner companions peruse the menu, make sure you stop and take a good walk through their beer selection. You can pick from hundreds of domestic and imported beers from around the world, including some rare gems you'd have to special order anywhere else. Chill your beer there in minutes, or get a discount walking in and bringing home a single or six pack. They always have interesting offerings on tap as well.

Regardless, I called over 5 times to discuss a payment plan with the office.  When I first emailed them, I was told I could choose the amount with which I wanted to pay to cover the amount owed.

It is a Regent Square staple, and the folks that come here seem to be staples as well. There is a Cheers vibe (early 80's sitcom\nabout a Boston bar where \"everyone knows your name\") and that seems to fare very well with the local residents.

I guess that may be a testament to the mediocre food.\n\nSo, if you are looking for a low key, mellow, old school (dark wood, framed pictures of landscapes a'la Rembrandt) place to check out, have a casual drink and appetizer, Dunnings is your spot.   I feel bad that the previous folks had crappy service, but if you come here with an open mind and the correct expectations, you will love this place as much as I do.\n\nAlso, it is Regent Theater adjacent, so it is also the perfect spot to have a quick drink/ appetizer before a film.", "business_id": "XQ7elqSFIRogvqpiTZz-Wg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-09-06", "type": "review"}

The kid at the counter was nice enough, so service was not an issue. The atmosphere inside pretty much sucks though...and you have to work pretty hard to make a cute little neighborhood coffee shop have zero atmosphere. \n\nThe first thing you see when you walk in a sign alerting you of the \"RULES\": to not use your cell phone at the counter, and that you must pay for something to sit inside, use the restrooms, or use the WiFi. Now, I understand the sentiment of these rules, they are common sense and fair. But it's a rather negative note to start off your experience being yelled at by a sign assuming you are there to steal their interwebz. It just doesn't feel warm or welcoming somehow. The front counter is poorly organized and rather unattractive. If it ever gets busy in there I'm willing to bet it gets rather chaotic.\n\nI ordered an iced vanilla latte, so I was quite surprised when the kid pulls out a pitcher from the fridge of what I can only guess was refrigerated espresso. That was rather disappointing; there's no reason an iced latte shouldn't be prepared with fresh espresso shots. Not surprisingly, it tasted bitter like...old espresso. Then I finished the drink to find the cup was 90% full of ice. I mean, come on. My lemon almond biscotti was delicious. The rest of the offerings in the pastry case appeared pretty underwhelming though; standard prepackaged muffins and cookies. With the number of excellent bakeries in this area, I don't see why they couldn't partner up with someone to provide some higher quality foods.\n\n\nI think this place could learn a lot from Square Cafe as far as decor and atmosphere go. It needs a little pep, a little warmth, SOMETHING. And they need to learn how to make iced lattes correctly. And they could also use an upgrade on their website...it's pretty amateurish and has a 1992 flair... Basically they just need to show a little effort.\n\nI love to support local businesses, but there should be more of a reason for me to return than the fact that it's the only coffee shop in town.", "business_id": "D9sHwmqlNkrVxmX-057i1g", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-11-19", "type": "review"}

After trying a battleship sub this weekend, I can say without reservation that the subs here are the best in PGH, without a doubt.  If you haven't tried one, you need to ASAP!\n\nGiven that I've been wanting to try a battleship for a long while, a friend and I decided to pick one up and have a picnic in nearby Frick Park.  We called in our order, and they gave us an estimate of about 45 min., which worked well given that we had other errands to run.  By the time we arrived at Triangle, our battleship was ready, so we were able to cut in line, pay ($14.75), and be off to have our picnic.\n\nUnwrapping the sub, it was immediately apparent that it encompassed 26\" of goodness.  Since it wasn't pre-cut, I tore it in half crosswise, which gave each of us 14\" to chow down on. The sub was generously filled with meats and cheeses, with a sufficient but not overwhelming amount of vegetables.  The bread was substantial and of good quality, and didn't tear or crumble as we ate our portions of the sub, as lesser quality bread does.  I ate half of my portion, and my friend was unable to finish his, despite intending to do so.  I ate the other half for lunch the next day, and it was almost just as good as it was upon receipt.\n\nBoth my friend and I were very impressed with the quality of the battleship, and it kept us full for a subsequent long-ish walk in the park.  I'd highly recommend it as an ideal picnic item.

I chose nothing fancy for the pedi (I cannot have hot stones or sugar rubs), just wanted to a nice trim up and beautiful polish to coordinate with the fingers - and Ashley recommended an OPI polish, Every Month is Oktoberfest.  OMG - can you fall in love with a nail color?  I had a simple black dress with silver and black jewelry - and that deep purple with a bit of a sparkle was just perfect.  Back to the pedi - she was so careful in trimming cuticles that the toes looked glorious and were so happy that they weren't over-cut. Heels were smooth and just lovely when she was done.  \n\nThen came the mani.  Here is where she absolutely shines. I have been getting gel/shellac for years.  And I am sitting here with two-week old gel that not only has not chipped but - and here is the biggie for me - is growing out neatly.  Seriously.  Have you ever had your nails done and as they grow out, you realize how sometimes the nail polish seems to shrink and the bottom and sides seem a little ragged and uneven?  And, especially with a dark polish, you can't go past two weeks because they look really bad?? Not these nails.  They are perfect along the edges.  I can honestly say I have never ever had that happen since I left the 'burgh.

Sooo... if you're a fan of Teppanyaki, this review may ring familiar. If you've not done Teppan style before... consider this a sort of \"what to look for\" primer.\n\nThere were five of us, sharing our table with a very nice young, near-newlywed couple; May 2010. Our table wait time, without a reservation, was about 35 minutes or so. (maybe they were waiting for a newlywed couple to join us?). And what lengthened the wait was the understaffed bar. We waited nearly 10 minutes to see a bar-server, and another 15 minutes to get our drink order. While everyone was friendly and apologetic, even apologies get old when they're used to salve away exceedingly slow service. Maybe the reason they appear to be busy, even on a Wednesday night.......? They had an abundance of tables celebrating \"Birthdays.\" I'd guess I listened to at least twelve renditions of \"Happy Birthday\", sung by the \"Greentree-Benihana-Bday Choir!\" (Oi vay...... next time I'm bringing earplugs!)   :-))\n\nMy impression? This is Pittsburgh; not my destination for \"great Japanese cuisine.\" So while this fine city certainly has some excellent eateries, when it comes to chain or franchised restaurants, you have to compare each location to the balance of their nation-wide organization. And having eaten at Teppan style restaurants for many years, and many Benihanas, I'd have to grade this particular location in the \"C\" range; very average.\n\nBefore we were seated, and while we were waiting in the bar, I spied the dining room. It appeared all the chefs were slow, seemingly ackward with their knives. And almost comically so. One Anglo chef, (no offense to Scandinavians that dream of becoming a Teppan-Guru), well, this guy looked like it was his first night, cutting off the shrimp tails...... almost one at a time, and still having a problem!? I think you get the idea. I've seen some Teppan-knife wielders, line up the shrimp and with one long swipe... de-tail-a-fy 30 with one stroke! Not here... some of the chefs may be on \"beginner knife-speed restriction?\"\n\nAs one reviewer mentioned; \"...it depends on which chef you get at your table.\" And with Teppanyaki style restaurants, and especially Benihanas, it's very true. It shouldn't be like that, but here in Greentree, and the evening we went, (Wednesday night around 630p), it was like going to a \"Barber College\" to get a free haircut, and trying to figure out how to judge the best out of a group of \"beginners.\" Our chef was possibly the best of the crowd, (sounds like... \"You have to go to my doctor, he's the best!\"), but if compared to all the Benihanas I've visited, he too would be a C to C- level; maybe a \"brown belt\" in marshall arts vernacular? He did the \"flip shrimp tail into the hat and pocket trick\"..... finally making it on the third try. But he did smile throughout the demo. (A good attitude is worth allot in my book.)\n\nThe food? Pretty good. Essentially, we ordered \"everything on the right side of the menu\"... mainly because I was treating my customer service staff... the greatest asset I have for my sales region. And because one of them had never Teppanyak-eed, I made sure we tried everything! Sushi, lobster, filet steak, scallops, shrimp, calamari, chicken..... well, you get the idea. What with the added rice and vegetables, it was a \"belly-busting-feast.\" And again, because of the great company, we had a wonderful time.\n\nSo overall, I gave this restaurant 3-stars. It was the total experience. The food was good, and more important, the company was great. But as you can see from my comments, I felt like this particular Benihanas location was struggling to meet the corporate concept; trying to do it with Pittsburgh locals who, from the hosts to the bartending staff, to the chef and server staff, just seemed like misfits. Had this been a \"Lone Star Steakhouse\", or a \"Fridays\", I'd have felt everything fitted just right.", "business_id": "1vQLTKwmcmZXtNzfKEvMmA", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-10-09", "type": "review"}

He had been some years back before, and this was my first time. Getting to the actual restaurant was a bit weird because of how you have to navigate the mountain (I don't know, is that considered a mountain, or is it a hill? Being from the south everything that makes me lift my legs/feet higher is a mountain). It was rather empty as it was only like 11.30AM, but that was ok with us as we're not a big fan of people (joke ... maybe). The interior is ridiculously awesome, especially the raised bar.\n\nOur chef walks up and it's a white man, which was a definite first for me at a Japanese steakhouse. And he seemed out of it. During the course of the meal, he did inform us that he was hungover ... it's Labor Day, what're gonna do? It didn't bother me too much, but I think he did annoy the hell out of my boyfriend lol. He told some good albeit corny jokes, did the usual tricks plus a few new ones - he was overall entertaining.\n\nThe food: oh man, was it yummy. I got the soba noodles and beef julienne. The noodles were cooked in some type of sauce that I couldn't describe, but they were the best soba noodles I have ever had. The beef julienne was also super delicious. The sauce on it was described as a teriyaki sauce, but it didn't taste like it at all to me, which was fine with me because I'm not a big teriyaki fan. \n\nAfter eating we hit the bar and had drink apiece. The bartender was really cool and the bar area had a great vibe and atmosphere. Sure, Japanese Steakhouses are pricey, but this is one of the few I've been to that is more than worth it.", "business_id": "1vQLTKwmcmZXtNzfKEvMmA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-09-11", "type": "review"}

Do not store c&s bagels underneath any of the following bagels: onion, poppy seed, sesame seed, everything, or any other bagel that has \"loose parts\". When the loose parts fall off  they stick to the c&s bagel. Biting into a sweet c&s bagel and getting a bite of onion (which I dislike) is AWFUL. \n2. either wipe off the counter or place a new sheet of wax paper on the counter after prepping one of the above mentioned bagels with loose parts. Again, when you place a c&s bagel on top of these loose parts, they stick to the bagel. \n3. when someone orders a tub of cream cheese to go with a c&s, please wrap the bagel. If not wrapped, the container becomes sticky and messy from coming into contact with the bagel.\nI was a \"regular\" at the Market Square location before changing jobs and never had any of the above issues.

Don't upcharge on the salami then hide it under the cheese so I can't see how may pieces you actually placed on the pizza. The pepperoni was about the size of breakfast sausage and tasted ok.

We had absolutely no issues from start to finish.\n\nCheck-in was effortless. Everything was clean and well stocked. There were no issues with billing. The price was competitive to the area. It was easy to reach, as it's directly off a highway exit. Each queen bed had 4 pillows: 2 \"firm\" and 2 \"soft\" which provided a nice ability to mix-and-match based on comfort. The beds were very comfortable overall, and everything looked to be organized and in order.\n\nThe room temperature was pretty much perfect from the get-go and did not need to be adjusted. There were plenty of in-room amenities and we did not need to call down to request anything that was missing. The amount of wall outlets were sufficient and scattered enough to charge our various electronics.\n\nThe wireless was fast enough and easy to sign into. One of my friends tried the pool and said it was very nice. The computers in the lobby were a nice touch for us to access some quick maps / tourist spots of the area, and you could use the printer for free.\n\nThe complimentary breakfast buffet was plentiful with TONS of options, and all of them were delicious. We had quite the feast that morning. However, the \"automated pancake machine\" is a novelty at best. It takes too long to produce the pancakes to be a worthwhile tool for busy breakfast hours. Guests were lining up and everything was just slowed to a crawl there. I liked the option of International Delight hazelnut coffee creamer, haha, as that is actually my go-to choice to add to my coffee at home.\n\nI would have preferred a later checkout (like Noon rather than 11) but other than that small nitpick, we faced no issues with our stay and would gladly choose Holiday Inn Express again in the future.", "business_id": "chDzLfj8CqvsJq4wzW1ZqQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-09-01", "type": "review"}

We needed to find a place not too far from Heinz Stadium for a reasonable price. We paid about $90 per night for this place, and the experience started poorly. We walked in and the two lobby TVs were tuned to Judge Judy (for the front desk employee's viewing pleasure). Employees watching reality TV during business hours really puts me off. It was hard to get the attention of the front desk staff because they were in the middle of a pizza order.  Two of the staff was working the front desk with a third suggesting toppings. It was pretty funny as one of clerks started to set up our room while another on the phone to the pizzeria kept interrupting the process with pizza questions. To the side the third clerk assisted with the pizza order. My wife pointed out her extreme cleavage, but I did not want to get lost there. We had a hard time understanding our clerk setting up the room. She tended to mumble, but did assert herself better when responding to pizza order questions. We finally got our room and headed up the very scary elevator to the 4th floor. In a way I felt as if we were at some sort of slum. I kept looking for gang tagging. The room was adequate (and I believe this was a renovated room), but a Motel 6 would be an upgrade. Whoever is doing the renovation has really poor taste and the quality of work is terrible. The swimming pool was a swamp (I am not kidding), but I am sure the frogs living in it were having a good time. The next morning we went down to the front desk again. This time the morning clerk was on a personal call and gave me an angry look because she felt that I was interrupting her call.  She did not even hang up; she just put the phone to her side, answered my question, and then continued her conversation. \n\nPersonally, I think this hotel would be great for a horror movie and Hollywood should contact this place. It needs to be knocked down, or management should tighten up the staff and improve construction quality. If construction is on track (and I suspect something is wrong), get staff that really is gracious to customers. There are people that need jobs out there and I assure you with proper management they will do a great job. Don't stay here for over $45 per night (the price is due to the breakfast offered). Personally I would not stay here until they fix the place, but for some reason I don't feel that it will ever happen. Something just feels wrong. Perhaps Clarion has stopped the remodel due to the economy.", "business_id": "Ml6Up5SH9GbJQ8oyIJsj_g", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-10-20", "type": "review"}

It begins with no signs saying where the hotel is at. And then it goes into their \"temporary lobby\" which is a room turned into an office. The whole place is under construction which wouldn't be so bad, but my gosh they have crap EVERYWHERE!!! That leads us to the elevator. Norman bates would even say it's too creepy for him. It's marked with two different hotel names on top of that, holiday inn and ramada. Then the room. Not the worst of the worst, the decor is nice, the bed is as hard as a rock and the shower isn't even properly installed. Really wish I would have looked at yelp before booking here. Buyer beware. Oh yea! AND I knew they were under construction before we booked in June, and we were promised that the construction would be done before hand.
