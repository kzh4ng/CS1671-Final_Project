But after we ordered, what really got me angry was that the food took a VERY long time to arrive. We had 2 kids with us and we ordered 2 kids meals, and had asked for those to be brought sooner. After about 25-30 minutes of nothing, I went to the servers (who were just NOT paying attention to us anyway - the main server's name for our table was Angel) and asked where our meals were. One checked with another, who then informed me that they were working on it. \nWhat made me even angrier is that they tried to downplay everything, telling me that it had only been 5 minutes. Then one of the servers (manager?) tells me that \"ok, may be it's been 10 minutes, but it's coming\". Then I hear some of the servers talking about our orders. The same gentleman then came to our table, sat down next to me and told me that it's only been 10 minutes and that they were working on our order, and tried to give me some explanation about why that's not really a long time at all. It was clearly almost half an hour or longer by that time. \nThe food finally arrived about 10 minutes after that. But the food came cold. \nWe were so HUNGRY by that point, we just ate whatever we could. Neither Angel nor anyone else came to top up our drinks even ONCE. I had to ask for mine, but by that point I was in no mood to take a sip even. \nI paid ($58.20) and I again got the same gentleman who tried (again!) to explain to me that it was just 10 minutes, and that \"given everything, we were within normal limits\". Wow. \nAfter about an hour and half at the restaurant, we all just shook our heads and left. \n\nI have written to them on their website, and will see if they follow up. \n\nWe have vowed NEVER to go to this restaurant again.

The whole point of going to McDonald's is indulging in some not-good-for-you food on the go in your busy life. In my case, I just wanted a small meal/snack that wouldn't cost me as much as the stuff in Kennywood would. I hadn't even eaten at a McDonald's in about eight years or so. And I quickly remembered why!\n\nForget the fact that McDonald's food isn't great. We all know it's not great. The problem here is that they added insult to injury by giving you the worst customer service ever in addition to not so good food. For starters, I quickly discovered that the drive-thru here is the ABSOLUTE slowest line on planet Earth. You certainly won't be getting any fast food here! Then, once I FINALLY placed my order, and finally got to the window to pay (because of course I spent a lot of time waiting for the people in front of me to even get their orders), a young woman took my card, swiped it...and didn't say another word. I waited thinking she was printing a receipt - nope! Eventually - after whipping out her phone and sending a text or two - she realized I was still there and told me to go to the next window for my food. Whatever, I figured, forget the receipt; by then I was pretty sure she had moved on to other orders and couldn't print my receipt anyway. On to the next window, where I was given my food and drink...and I proceeded to quickly discover they gave me no straw and for some reason, layered my Big Mac as such: bread, bread, patty, patty, bread. ...seriously, how does one even mess that up? I give one brownie point because the fries really were actually pretty good...but they were not worth the wait or trouble.\n\nI concur with the other reviewers: skip this place. Completely. Just keep driving.

It's one of my favorite weekday after-work places to visit and I come here often.\n\nThe restaurant has a real hardwood grill that is is located in full view of the main dining room and baths the neighborhood with the smokey sweet smell of grilled meats that makes you salivate and your stomach ache for food.  It's one of those things that makes you feel that this place is going to be great - you cannot wait to get inside and order.\n\nThe interior always has a great vibe.  High tin-covered ceilings, old-school wood bar, exposed red brick, and denim tablecloths cover tables that are closely-spaced and nearly always full with patrons happily eating and drinking.  Arrive at a peak time, any weekday or weekend evening, and you'll likely be getting a drink at that nice bar while you wait for a table.  That's OK - the bar is fully stocked, with local Penn Pilsner on tap (along with other good beers), and service is attentive and efficient.  Don't forget to take a look at the chalkboard on the wall to see today's specials.\n\nWhat to order:  You must try a burger here - I virtually guarantee that it will be one of the best you've ever had.  Tessaro's grinds their beef for their burgers fresh daily, and they rely on their own recipe for their ground beef that mixes different cuts of beef in a predetermined proportion to achieve a balance of taste and the right amount of succulent fat - both for taste and for the right amount of drippings onto that hardwood fire which flares and sears the outside of the burger with tasty good stuff.  The burger is nicely-sized, with a great selection of cheeses and toppings, and grilled to your desired level of doneness.  This is the only restaurant where I frequently order a burger without any trimmings - just so I can taste the beef in all of its smokey goodness.\n\nA wish:  I wish they made better side dishes to accompany their burgers.  They offer some good side dishes: potato salad, steamed fresh vegetables; and some side dishes that could be better, especially the home fries, which tend to be soggy, greasy, and/or burnt.  They don't offer french fries.  I think offering a proper french fry - made with freshly-cut potatoes, first par-fried at a lower temperature and then flash-fried at a very high temperature to order would go a very long way toward perfection.\n\nTheir soups are OK, and, strangely, a good portion of their menu is listed as \"Mexican\" fare.  They don't need it, and would be better off limiting that fantastic hardwood grill to burgers, steaks, and fish specials.\n\nIf you haven't visited yet, you will not be disappointed.  I highly recommend checking it out.", "business_id": "vgXE1I7c9ElcfYyZfQiN1Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-12-15", "type": "review"}

I have a feeling that the manager was not in.\n\nAll five of the employees that I saw were under 18 (which, as a 21 year old, is not entirely an ageist comment). Even though there were only five customers in the store, it took nearly 20 minutes to prepare all five orders, after they were already taken. The cashier also had a lot of trouble counting money--her goal was to give me back $7.02 in change, but took the $5 out, said \"Oh shit,\" out loud, thought for a second, and then I reminded her that I need $2.02 more.\n\nAll five orders had exactly one item missing from their trays, and all of them were things that the cashier was responsible for. She forgot my chips for my taco salad, the cheese for two other customers, an incorrect drink for another. My drink wound up having zero carbonation.\n\nI finally made my way to the condiment counter, which had ketchup smeared all over it, including on the stack of ketchup cups. There were literally zero napkins, so I had to go ask for some from behind the counter.\n\nMany of the tables had a stray napkin or straw wrapper. While eating at one of them, one of the employees was in the dining room, yelling towards the counter (from about 20 feet away), \"Can you please tell Gary to fucking change these garbage cans?\" about five times. The cashier responded that she doesn't want to \"yell\" at Gary again.\n\nAs I cleaned my tray, I discovered the reason the garbage cans so desperately needed changed--I tried all three in the restaurant, but all of them were so full that I could barely open up the swing door on them, let alone put anything inside. I finally settled for putting my full tray on top of the entire garbage receptacle, for I had no other option.\n\nNone of this is exaggeration.

I decided to give Matt's Chicago Dog a try because I've always noticed the crowds, I love hot dogs, and I love Chicago (I'm a sucker for marketing).  \n\nThe menu was a lot more extensive than I was expecting and I felt a bit overwhelmed, like being the new kid coming into a school halfway through the year.  Everyone walking in knew what they wanted and how to order.  I, on the other hand, felt like I had to go back to Ordering Food 101.  The guy behind the counter was very friendly and accommodating, though, and walked me through the process.  I still felt stupid, but at least I got to order.  \n\nFinding a place to sit was the biggest challenge.  The place fills up during lunch.  Luckily, hot dogs (and other similar items) are usually quick to eat, so people don't stay seated for very long.  The atmosphere doesn't pretend to be a place for \"hanging out\" and talking anyway, so you want to eat and go.  \n\nThe people working there definitely have a good process, but you still have to wait a little while for your food, as everything's freshly made.  And with the menu and the list of toppings being so extensive, no two things coming out are probably alike.  \n\nI got my polish sausage and fries in good time, though, and enjoyed them immensely.  I just wish we had someplace like Matt's near MY workplace, as I'd like to try a lot more on the cheaply priced menu!", "business_id": "gpCtDCSXIoQx70cq9itfNA", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-12-10", "type": "review"}

The waitress was practically all but ignoring us.  We only got offered one round of drinks, never asked if we wanted a second round.  We had to ask for our silverware/napkins after our food came, and did not get it until at least 10 minutes later about halfway through the meal. All the while watching the group of guys next to us get service repeatedly (when they asked her to get something, she would immediately come back to their table, not disappear for 10 minutes then have to be asked again when she did finally return). Aside from just being terrible, she was also unfriendly.  \n\nAs for the food, all my friends seemed to enjoy/appreciate their meals.  For about 8-10$, you get a huge sandwich/burger and a side of fries.  Except $8 for a basket of chip and cheese dip is ridiculously overpriced to me.\n\nAs a vegetarian, it was entirely another matter for me.  Not wanting a \"veggie\" burger, I ordered the buffalo blue cheese dip + potato wedges/chips + vegetables off the appetizer menu.  What was delivered was a basket of chips and cheese dip. When I asked the waitress if I was correct that the menu listed vegetables as well, she said \"yeah, it should come with it\" as if I was asking too much for the kitchen to produce what the menu says.  It wasn't actually until I explained the vegetable part was the reason I ordered this dish that she \"offered\" to get them for me.  She disappears. Ten minutes later, my friends halfway through their meal, no vegetables in sight, but at least we have silverware and napkins now.  Five minutes later, she hears us loudly complaining, and says shes told the kitchen twice now.. yeah right. Another ten minutes later, we're complaining real loud now, to ourselves because no staff member is in sight.  Soon the manager appears and says the vegetables will be out soon and apologizes.  My cheese dip and potato chips are not semi-warm, at best. He returns, and in a pretentiously apologetic manner sets done a plate and gets ready to scurry off before I can complain about: THREE 6-inch cuts of celery, and TWO 4-inch by 1-inch hunks of a carrot, completely RAW.  It took them 25 minutes to bring this out to me, and then act as if this would suffice without any compensation.  We immediately asked for a box and a discount. \n\nYes, he discounted us 10% of our final bill, which I think came out to deducting my cheese dip and chips, plus half of my beer.  The waitress brought it out as one check too, not asking if us 2 men and 2 women (obviously 2 couples), would have wanted the check split.\n\nThe kicker: the sidewalk sign outside their door read \"Charlotte's Finest\" ...

Plenty of knowledgable staff if you get stumped on your decision making!\n\nThey also offer classes, it's well worth getting on their email list, it's something fun to do.  Last night they just had their yearly Champagne tasting.  Much fun.  I do find that they have paid tastings and free tastings.  I prefer to go to the paid tastings, they are more generous with the wine when it is paid.\n\nMore people know Arthur's has a cafe, there is a reason.  Great soups and sandwiches.  A lot more healthier choices than eating in the food court.", "business_id": "nkNdTqpv1m5GBKx8xrpluw", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-12-10", "type": "review"}

I ordered a waffle, Bert's best chili and all the way homefries. Our waitress Jane was prompt with our drinks.

Sorry... the lamb did not look appetizing.  It look liked dried processed meat.  Reminds me of the movie \"Bridesmaids\", LOL.  I ordered the seafood platter and I knew it was fried but I didn't experience the sea-smell so I was quite confident that that the fish was not spoiled.  I believe the fish was flounder but it was quite thin - well, actually VERY thin.  At least they didn't overcook it.  And baby shrimp.  OK, I'll accept it.  But I would have been more impressed if the shrimp was larger.  Coleslaw was questionable... not sure how old it was... the mayo seemed kinda \"sticky\".  Husband ordered the tenderloin dinner.  We were advised that it was not beef but pork.  I recommend that they specify that on the menu.  It was \"ok\", but quite tasteless (not marinated).\n\nOverall, for a quick/convenient inexpensive meal, it \"filled the hole\".", "business_id": "hlME5-P2CudNDCUSIX2cxQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-02-13", "type": "review"}

Well, this is great. I got the salad with no steaks.. Was I surprised.. Not at all. He called to tell them about it and asked if I wanted him to go back for \"the steaks\".

Everyone was in the mood for burgers so it seemed like a good fit for a relatively inexpensive Friday night dinner.  Pulling in the parking lot I was surprised at the lack of business - that should have been my first clue.  We were seated promptly and our drink order was taken.  Then we waited.  And waited.  Finally our drinks arrived and our order was taken.  We ordered a small appetizer and bowl of soup with our meals.  Again, we waited.  Our appetizer finally arrived - but no soup.  It was mediocre, and sadly, the best food we would have that evening.\n\nOur entrees arrived shortly after.  It was then my husband asked if he could have his bowl of soup.  Soon after the waitress arrived with a half filled bowl.  It almost looked as though it had been full at one point, then dumped out.\n\nThe fries were cold on all our meals.  The burger I ordered well done, was extremely pink. I did not bother to ask for it to be corrected because at this point the whole experience was quite laughable.  More than halfway through our entrees, a gentlemen in what appeared to be a manager's uniform, came to the table with a bowl of soup asking if it was ours.  My husband laughed and told him, \"No, I already got this half full bowl.\"\n\nA few moments later I bit into something hard, like bone, in my burger.  At that point I was disgusted - and done.  I would have told the waitress that the food (and service) was awful, but we were never asked.  When she brought the bill she said she had taken the soup off the bill since it was only a 1/2 bowl.  So my husband's comment must have at least made it back to her, yet there was no apology for it, nor the fact that he had to ask for it and received it after his entr\u00e9e.\n\n$58.00 for 3 people, lackluster/slow service and terrible food?

It took a couple years because of the diversity and number of places on that street, but eventually he got to all of them. That sounded like a fun project to undertake, so I thought I'd do the same. Picking which street in Madison was kind of difficult, especially since you can stay driving on the same road and it'll change names like 4 or 5 times. I decided to pick one such road: Monona Dr which turns into Attwood Ave, which turns into Willy Street. There are so many great places on this road, some of which are already favorites, but others that I need to get around to visiting and reviewing. Now the journey begins....\n\nIt was a snowy December Sunday afternoon when I visited this Red Robin. The snow kept a lot of people away, but the place was still about a third filled. I was greeted and seated promptly. I've been to Red Robins before and I like to think of them as an easy place to go when my sister is in town visiting with her kids. Kids seem welcome here (they even can get a balloon) and since it's already a loud place, I don't mind when my niece and nephew act up (to say I'm not a kid person would be a great understatement). The burgers here are good with fun toppings. My go to is the A1 peppercorn burger which may rival Bob's Bad Breath Burger from the Weary Traveler when it comes to giving you bad breath afterwards. The onion bun along with the crispy onions on top definitely leaves you reaching for some gum after dinner. If you are feeling gluttonous, the never ending refills of steak fries can fill you up. When they are fresh and hot, they are pretty tasty, but if you are looking for crispy fries, this isn't the place for you. They had some boozy ice cream shakes on the menu that looked interesting, but I'm not in the mood for shakes in winter. Overall it's a decent place for burgers and fries if you don't mind that it's loud, there's tons of pop culture crap all over the walls, and that it's a chain.

We live in Monona so it's the closest and used to be dependably good food and service.\n\nStopped in before Christmas, snow coming in and they were not busy.  Lots of servers.  Sat down to order and our waitress took our drink order, came back with it and told her we needed a couple more minutes to decide on our order.  She never came back, I could see her behind the bar talking to the other servers, she wasn't busy.  After about a half hour another server who seemed to have quite a few tables stopped by and asked if we were ok, I said no, we didn't seem to have a server.  She took care of our table, seemed to try to talk to the manager about what was going on but he looked pretty disinterested.  After we ordered our food our original server showed up, apologized and told me she had gotten busy behind the bar, honestly, lying is not the best policy, telling me she forgot would have worked better with me.  At the end we tipped the server that actually helped us and did not leave a tip for the no-show server.\n\nCouple of other things, the bottomless fries are now a few fries in a little basket.  Talked to some other locals and one had food served with wrappers from food products in her food.  Other problems were mentioned, this location seems to be struggling.  This could just be the Monona location or maybe Red Robins in general?  We haven't checked out the East Towne location.  This is too bad they typically had good, reliable food, priced pretty well.\n\nI don't leave bad reviews for restaurants that are not great but this was a ridiculous experience considering there was no one in the restaurant.

I got a burger because that's what they're known for and it was delicious. Maybe being a little tipsy might have something to do with it.  My boyfriend hated the place. He hated the food and hated the server. She wasn't attentive at all. The wings were chewy,  which means they deep fried frozen wings. I tried to tell him he was being very critical.  \n     The next time I went there, I was there with a friend and sans boyfriend. After a bit of drinking I decided it was time to go home. Earlier I convinced my boyfriend to give them another chance in the food department and picked us up some food to-go, burgers because they were so good. I live within walking distance from the place and when I got home, i noticed the burgers were practically raw. I called the bar and told them what happened, and they ask me to come back so they could replace my food. My boyfriend wanted no part of that, and wanted a refund for his food. After the bartender assured me that my food will be cooked properly I came in and picked up my replacement food. He was also good enough to refund me a couple of my drinks from earlie which made up for the hassle. That burger he cooked himself and it was good. He also took the lady who made my burger off the grill.\n     Today I went there and picked up some food to go. The same lady who cooked my burger before, was working the grill. I didn't want to be a dick and ask for someone else to cook it and I decided to give her another chance. Before I left the bar, I checked my burger to make sure it was cooked all the way, and again it was raw. So I asked the server to have her cook it a little longer, and when I got home it was ok but then my fries were cold. All in all, it's a pain in the ass to try to get food cooked properly there.

Never saw it done like so, but I'm not a fan of soggy wings.  I always order on the side, but the bartender convinced me to go with \"the works\", and keep it as is.  I'm not a sucker for pretty bartenders, but how can I say no.....ooooh shucks sure!  I did not regret the decision - no foo, not the \"Lebron Decision\", I'm talking about the wings!  Okay let's stay focused.  The wings came with a perfect texture of crispiness with a jolt of sweet and spicy sauce.  Bam!  Best damn sauced wings I had!  Thanks for the recommendation!  I ordered a side of fries to keep that spicy to balance the spice.  \n\nAlong with your food you must order a few drinks here.  Not the largest selection in town, but if you need that go to the Yard House ya hippy!  My AA (Affordable Alcohol) group would love it here.  In my opinion the drinks are pretty cheap considered the prices of most places these days.  \n\nOverall, great bar to lay low if that's how you feel for the night.

Once you know how good it is, you'll be willing to park as far away as needed.  You walk up to the counter/window while perusing the menu on the walls.  I've never not had a super friendly person taking my order.  Sometimes it's even the owner. \n\nThey've got more of a food selection that you might think.  Hot dogs, burgers, sausages, turkey, chicken, roast beef, fish, veggie burgers, cheese steaks, wings, salads, fries, onion rings, shakes.  My friend knew he'd love the place as soon as he saw \"Frito Pie\" as an option.  You can check out their full menu at http://www.chicagohamburger.com. And yes, those are current prices. Less than $4 and you've got a nice meal.  For $5 a feast.\n\nAmazing hot dogs.  Standard burgers can take a few minutes because they are being freshly made - but SO worth the wait.  I haven't seen anyone not love what they got.\n\nI can not come here without getting sliders.  Won't happen.  Ever.  And why you may ask?  Because they are better than White Castle.  I know what you're thinking (Oh NO she Didn't!!!) but yes, yes it's true.  Their buns are amazing.  They manage to be light and fluffy, yet thick and dense.  I can't explain it - but I don't have to.  For less than a buck you can have your own w/ Cheese.  Good luck eating just one.  I'll get one - if I'm also getting a hot dog.  But most folks get at least 2 or 3.  I witnessed someone eat 6.  Well, 5 1/2 - but he did better than I had expected.\n\nWe normally get one fry and one onion ring because they are both SO yummy it's hard to pick.  Fries are cut thin and Rings are cut medium-thick.   Oh yea...\n\nFor anyone that has ever loved a shake - you must have one here.  I tried a friend's strawberry shake as we were headed out the door, and immediately turned around, got back in line and ordered my own.  Since then - we have come by to get sliders and shakes many times.  And we live 20 minutes away.

You'd think that dealing with Qwest would deserve a greater payback, but I'd been wanting to try this place since the Weekly Yelp that mentioned their peanut butter milkshakes. It turned out that I couldn't have asked for more.\n\n1st - I love the CHC for being honest. It's a straight-up, no frills, burger and hot dog stand. It totally reminded me of the roadside burger joints that my family stopped at as a kid, and 30 years later, their prices aren't even that far off. A 1/3 lb. charbroiled burger for under 4 bucks? that's a solid value!\n\n#2 - The sliders. Everybody seems to like the doubles, but I think that the single cheese burger slider is just the right slider-ific proportion of bread, meat, and cheese. They have some options to tart them up a bit, but I just went with the onions and a bit of ketchup. I wouldn't say that they are a one-for-one with the White Castle sliders, but pretty close, and quite possibly better. Order two for just over $2...\n\nC. - Chicago and hot dogs, a culinary dynasty. You can argue about which city has the best pizza, but those kids up near Lake Michigan have got the hot dog market covered. CHC has the all beef Vienna dogs, the poppy seed buns, and all the right fixins (scary green relish, sport peppers, tomatoes, and celery salt...) to throw down with a nearly perfect \"Chicago Dog\". Comes with Fries for $4... Eat one and smile while you think about enjoying the taste of Chicago without the January weather.\n\nLastly, I did make it around to one of those peanut butter milkshakes. It was great. Thick enough to stand a spoon in, and plenty of real peanut butter. It's not so sweet that one can't enjoy it as an accompaniment to to the sliders and dog, instead of dessert.\n\nIt's not too often that a place lives up to its own hype, but the Chicago Hamburger Co. was everything that I was craving and more.", "business_id": "iNvY0zAlaD_ye7Z6rHu-Ug", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-02-03", "type": "review"}

Both of these facts mean our eating out budget is, well, measly.  However, that doesn't mean that we don't eat out.  Instead we've been sharing meals and seeking out places that have good prices and don't suck.  \n\nI've lived in the neighborhood around CHC for over 10 years off and on and have never been in, until last night.  We needed a quick, yummy, cheap meal before a movie (that budget is dwindling as well) and T is from Illinois so he has a fondness for sliders.  Me, as a native Phoenician, not so much into the slider.  When I was traveling in the Midwest once, some friends took me to White Castle.  I don't know if there is anything more repulsive to me than steamed meat.  Just the phrase alone is like some sort of weird phrase that should have its own category like oxymoron, but instead of meaning opposites it means disgusting.  I digress...\n\nSo CHC is an order at the counter, plastic chairs, thin paper napkin kinda place.  And that totally works.  The abundance of Chicago sports memorabilia on the walls completely distracts you from the less than fine dining atmosphere.  There were a number of other customers in who seemed like regulars and the parking lot was packed.  We ordered six cheese sliders with just ketchup, a basket of fries and two medium root beers.  The sliders are like a buck each and come with the works including onions, pickles, ketchup, brown mustard and something else I'm probably forgetting.  I thought they were pretty good with just the ketchup, but the bf ordered another with the works and said that was the way to go.  Now, I don't know if they steam their burgers or they grill them but these were hot, flavorful and chewy.  The buns were fluffy and delicious.  The fries were crispy and salty as fries should be and I ate nearly the entire basket.  The medium soda is more like a large and I would order the small next time.  \n\nThere is one tv with sports and I would guess this would be a great place to watch a Chicago game.  Most importantly, we got out of there for about 20 bucks which is great for the wallet.  For a quick cheap meal that makes you feel less guilty than going to McDonald's, CHC is a solid choice.", "business_id": "iNvY0zAlaD_ye7Z6rHu-Ug", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-02-03", "type": "review"}

I will give them that the service was friendly and we had our food in about 10-15 minutes. They were pretty busy, but it came quick. \n\nI got two double meat cheese sliders.

There used to be this hot dog cart in this industrial area that had bomb Frito pies and I hadn't had one in about 7 years. Well, the chili was disgusting. In all my life I have never had chili like the Chicago Hamburger Co. It tasted like a bag of sugar accidentally got knocked over into the chili as they were making it and they just let it ride.

Since I'm unable to, whenever I bug my coworkers to go there I simply make up a new name for it.  For example:\n\n\"hey guys, we should go to old Mcdonalds house of Brass Railroad Tracks.\"\n\nor\n\n\"Hey, lets go to Brass Traintrack Rails at noon.\"\n\nSince most of my coworkers have not been afflicted with heavy drinking habits and/or retardation they know what I'm talking about.\n\nI sought this place out as a lunch time place during work hours since often I crave a simple beer for lunch instead of caloric \"food.\"  Usually my fellow workers and I will end up at the Dirty Drummer, since it's right across the street from our office building.  This was fine for a while until I realized that The Dirty Drummer is actually fucking gross, the atmosphere is depressing and the servers are visually annoying.  Thanks to my obsession with Yelp and alcohol, I was able to find this little gem, a simple and tasty dive bar that is literally four minutes from our office.  \n\nOld Brass Rail is large and not at all intrusive, it's not so local that everyone looks at you when you walk in and it's not so detached that they don't care that you're there.  Plus, they have those high top bar tables that are fun to sit at, especially when they're spread out and you don't have to hear other people's conversations.  They have a million flat screen TV's for when the conversation slows or when you dine with boys who are distracted by lights and moving objects around them.\n\nI've only been there twice, both times we had the same server, both times all my comrads ordered the amazingly reasonable and genius idea of a three dollar breakfast until 2 p.m.  Everyone loves breakfast, and to serve a cheap breakfast at a BAR until 2 p.m. is god damn fucking brilliant.  The server was super nice, sweet and friendly, remembered us, offered suggestions, was not put off by the fact that we are an unlikely group to be at bar in the middle of a weekday.  I can honestly say that both times I thoroughly enjoyed my Old Brass Railroad Tracks experience. \n\nI didn't order breakfast because I am not a \"breakfast food\" person.  I order lunch, even in the morning.  I ordered the chicken strips and a salad, I've also had the fries.  Everything was what you expect as far as bar food but genuinely not gross, with the added bonus that it was NOT, in fact, The Dirty Drummer.  Also, it's not over priced for what it is, 7 for an app, 7 for a burger, cheap beers, good specials, 4.50 pitchers, such a great find.  Also, 3.50 breakfast AT A BAR- GENIUS.  In addition to the totally acceptable food, pleasant service and good prices, you get the added bonus of checking out an old school cigarette vending machine on your way out.  I hope to return to Train Tracks of Brass Railroad Bar soon.", "business_id": "RIeWXLMHZQlYprYt1x2f1w", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-12-11", "type": "review"}

The reviews were mixed - some proclaiming excellence and others less than stellar but none of them regarding the karaoke. I wanted to see for myself.\n\nOne, the parking is dismal. But, if needed, the post office is only half a block away with a nice big lot and available for parking (which is where I parked the Saturday I went).\n\nTwo, the place is a dive bar - nothing more, nothing less. When I arrived, there were several people at the bar and several groups at the tables. Karaoke was in full swing and there were singers up. When sitting at the bar, I was immediately served by a male bartender with an easy smile.\n\nThree, beer. The selection is fairly standard, the commonplace brews you can find in most bars - Bud, lites, Mich, etc. I was happy to find Woodchuck served, and not just served but on tap. (This is the only place - bar or liquor store - I've found since moving from the Midwest that offers my favorite hard cidar. I'm sure there are more, just haven't found them yet.) The price was a little steeper for that Woodchuck though than I'm accustomed. But that could be since the company that makes it is a small brewery in the Midwest and do not commonly distribute this far west.\n\nFour, Karaoke DJ. A nice wooden dance floor was where the DJ made house for karaoke. Decent set up (one more like I'm used to with a lap top instead of cartridges like a few places I've seen since moving here), and a decent selection. I think he had books available, but he said it is often easier to simply write the song you want down and, if he has problems, he'd let you know. I was happy to see he had several bands/artists that are a little less known karaoke-wise that I enjoy to sing.\n\nThe DJ did sing, unlike some places where they refuse. But it wasn't an issue as the rotation wasn't overly long, and he was good about weaving new people into the existing line up. There were singers (like all places) with good voices and others without. It's not an overly young crowd. I'd say late twenties and up.\n\nThe only annoyance was the sound system was wonky. There was really only one or two good places to stand with the microphone to keep feedback out of the speakers. For someone like me who likes to sit in their seat, instead of standing on the dance floor, that was a drawback.\n\nI did not eat while at the establishment. But there were a lot of people who did. I checked out the prices which seemed VERY inexpensive and also checked out the portions others had which were VERY large. But I can't attest to the quality. Despite negative reviews (and possibly at my own peril) I will try the food in the future however. \n\nI was happy with my experience. The people were polite and friendly, the service was good and not intrusive, and the karaoke was fun and had a receptive crowd. While not going to be a regular haunt, I'll certainly come back in the future.", "business_id": "RIeWXLMHZQlYprYt1x2f1w", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-12-20", "type": "review"}

A sidenote, try the ranch dressing... really fresh and not too thick or heavy. Delicious.", "business_id": "lf42gtgq_2_jPvjfp_K1nQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-02-23", "type": "review"}

I figured this was so she didn't have to get management involved with the switch or what not, despite my eager suggestion. Needless to say, the evening continued. I eat one wing... literally one!

In other words, I traveled all the way from Tucson to Northern Phoenix to eat an all right burger.  Well, that's not true.  My friend and I traveled there to watch Avatar on the IMAX screen at Desert Ridge.  \n\nTo reiterate, the burgers at Islands are \"fine\" in the mildest possible term.  The ground beef was of decent to good quality, and therefore the taste was of average to good caliber.  It was the fixings that sort of dragged down the burger in the taste department.  I ordered the Kilauea, which is a jalapeno & black pepper crusted burger with pepper jack cheese, chipotle aioli, lettuce,\ntomato and Island Reds.  I'm not a cheese fan, so I opted to forgo the pepper jack.  I'm not sure if that would've saved the burger.  The seasoning lacked any pronounced or distinguished flavor.  Sadly, the end result was a rather bland burger.  \n\nHave mercy, the fries, on the other hand, were probably the best thing on my plate.  The fries at Islands were good and fresh, just like me with the ladies after a few drinks.  With all due respect to a review who said that the fries \"tasted a lot like In-N-Out's,\" I disagree.  In-N-Out fries are of the thin-cut variety, while Island's are more of a traditional style.  What I appreciated the most about the fries were that they were crispy and fresh.  \n\nThe service was fairly fast, efficient and friendly, especially considering this a California-based chain.  I hate to wait for refills on my drinks, and our server was always on the spot just prior to hitting bottom as to satiate our impending thirst.  By the way, if you order a Cherry Coke here, it comes with an actual maraschino cherry.  Well, the first one does at least.  The second and third ones lacked any cherry.  I guess once you pop that first cherry, you really don't get any more.  \n\nOn that note, I would consider paying Island's a visit again, but it's not high on my list.

Not just because I'm a freaking fast food junkie so it was going to happen one of these days anyhow - but because of today's experience.\n\nI've been to this one, well, let's just say more than several times.  The food is always.... uneventful.  It's not one of those specifically great or specifically bad ones.  It's just..... fine?  The only really good thing I got there once was their big breakfast.  It was only McDonald's good, but man it tasted good that day.\n\nAnyhow, so I was grabbing a breakfast burrito (that stupid healthy yogurt was not going to calm the grumbling monster that was my tummy that morning).  For breakfast, I'll normally either get my item solo, or as the meal w/ OJ.  But I remembered seeing last week that in a blind taste test, the McDonald's coffee actually scored higher on a taste test than Starbucks.  So I figured I'd give it a shot.  \n\nACKKKKKKK!!!!!!!!  PLECCCHHHHH!!!  Ick!  Ug!  Gross!  Spit, spit, spit....   I wanted to wipe my tongue down w/ the wood tasting napkin to scrape it all off.  \n\nThey had thrown in some sugar and cream.  I'll normally do a cream and a sugar for one this sized.  I initially tried it black. I thought maybe it was better w/ the stuff added.  This was a SMALL cup, and I added both creamers and all 6 sugars they gave me and I could barely taste any sweetness.  It was like the black hole of coffee condiments.  What is totally sad - I ended up drinking about 1/2-3/4 the cup just trying it after adding each condiment.  I really wanted it to be better.  Kept waiting for that magic ingredient.  It didn't come.  \n\nNasty, nasty, nasty.  Mediocre fast food, fine.

The little things like bringing extra drinks when they see you're getting low, and making sure that everything is satisfactory for you really shows that they care for the customer. I really enjoy getting the Kilauea which is a jalapeno and black pepper encrusted burger with pepper jack cheese and chipotle aioli, it is so tasty! If you're not in the mood for a burger, they also have salads, sandwiches, tacos, etc.. I also really enjoy the fries at this place, and they also have some really good desserts that are fairly large in portion. I remember after I ate my burger and fries I decided to ordered the Chocolate Lava for dessert which is a chocolate brownie topped with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, cherries, almonds and chocolate syrup, a fairly simple but delicious dessert. I thought the dessert would be around the size of my fist like some other restaurants do, but it was much larger which I think is awesome.", "business_id": "e0vubCKi8KD8zC2C6FdbuQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-12-14", "type": "review"}

From what I remember, it's more rich, much creamier than ice cream or frozen yogurt.  Since then, I've never been able to find anything that comes close to that creamy, custard-y frozen goodness.  Apparently it's not that common here on the west coast.\n\nLast I went back, because I had to have that smooth chocolate cone once more.  There was a wait, which wasn't uncommon, being summertime in the AridZone.  There wasn't a nice little old lady helping us; instead there were teenagers running about behind the counter.  The entire place, small as it was, felt kinda...sticky, I suppose.  The napkin counter was gross from melted messes and grinder condiments.  I tried to hide my slowly-growing disappointment until I could taste the frozen custard I once knew long ago.  Unfortunately, the custard itself was just not the same.\n\nIt tasted like plain ol' chocolate ice cream.  There wasn't anything custard-like about it.  :(\n\n**Upon searching for reviews on the Net, I found that the Neiesens had sold the shop to a different owner, which would explain the downfall of  my favorite dessert spot.  However, they've recently gained ownership once again, this of course after my unfortunate visit last year, but I have high hopes!

Well...this trip (our final one to visit our daughter who has now moved), we got here!\n\nUpon entering, we were surprised to find that in addition, to frozen custard, they also served meals (burgers, sandwiches, salads, etc.).  We were there strictly for the frozen custard.\n\nWe were greeted by a very friendly young lady who worked behind the counter.  She was patient with us as we perused the massive topping menu---so much choice!  In the end, I chose a small cup of vanilla with sprinkles and my husband had a small cup of unadorned chocolate custard.  After ordering, we were given a number to put on our table then the young lady brought out our order quickly.\n\nWe both agreed that the frozen custard had a nice, creamy consistency.  However, we found that it didn't have much flavor.  Neither the vanilla nor the chocolate had a strong enough flavor---and that was disappointing.

Even gave us one take home for later I ended up getting the cheese burger with grilled onions & my husband got the bacon cheese burger we both shared a thing of chili fries topped with cheese and grilled onions and shared large soft drink all for $20.10 maybe to some people that's over priced but keep in mind there big portioned!!! You get a lot for your money won't leave hungry...however I did notice there is a sign where if you pay using a debit card they charge you 60 cents idk what's up with the card thing so I payed cash after We both watched them make our order on cooktop nervously I must say this is big deal for me And love how you can watch your food being prepared as in most hamburger places you can't. The man was very friendly didn't mind us watching him make our food he was telling us how there meat is fresh to everything reassuring us this won't be like mcdonalds food he even brought our order to our table we sat in booth they have other 2 seater tables I looked around noticed everything was very clean and other workers where cleaning keeping busy not just standing around chatting or ignoring you on there phones we got our food began digging into are burgers they where moist & juicy not like one other reviewer stated and there huge also so come with appetite! Our plate of chili fries where big portioned we couldn't even finish them all I got up put our trash up and the man took my tray for me by then there was 10 people already standing in line ordering and getting food on our way out the door we over heard some kids praising there grilled cheese and breakfast.

This is the worse customer service I have ever received in a long time. And I am sympathetic when it comes to less than par customer service if there are special circumstances (busy day, understaffing, etc.) but there was no reason for this HORRIBLE customer service.", "business_id": "-GYx5GAx_-4XEsn7mFwdkA", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-01-14", "type": "review"}

They have been going through a lot of changes as the other reviewers have noted, and change here is not for the better.\n\nFirst off we always have to wait.  I understand waiting if there is a wait, but not when the place is half or more empty.   Every time they offer the same excuse.  A server called in sick.  Actually 4-5 would have to have called in, but I don't believe them regardless.  It's this way all the time.\n\nThey serve 'bottomless' fries, which is great for kids.  However, now you have to plan on the first batch and those that actually come with your sandwich being cold.   They'll say they are sorry and bring more in 15 minutes.\n\nThey have an elaborate allergy procedure, which is important to us, and the kitchen will mess up the first and maybe second time anyway.  Other than the time it's not so bad when you expect it.  \n\nRefills are hit or miss depending on the server but generally better than most places.  The food itself is still about as good as it always has been, it just takes a lot longer now.\n\nIf you complain to the manager (assuming there is a real issue) he will handle it well, say he's sorry, and usually comp the wrong meal.  He'll say they are better than this and ask for another chance.  Unfortunately there's only so many of those to be had.", "business_id": "-GYx5GAx_-4XEsn7mFwdkA", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-02-13", "type": "review"}

The place was busy but not packed. We had to wait a little in the front to be recognized,  but not too long to be annoyed. After being seating we were attentively greeted by our server. I ordered the whiskey river BBQ chicken wrap which comes with bottomless fries. I noticed they now had the choice for bottomless sweet potato fries and asked for those.  The food didn't take long to get. I immediately noticed that the wrap was extremely small for being $10, but figured I wouldn't eat it all anyways so I wouldn't fuss about it. After one bite I knew I couldn't eat the rest of it. The wrap was so small but they used a larger (perhaps burrito sized) tortilla and wrapped and folded and contorted it so my first bite was mostly chewy tortilla with a little filling. I looked through the rest of the wrap where I took that bite and saw that it was nothing but tortilla all the way down the side. All they had to do was fill up the space with lettuce for goodness sake! There was barely any lettuce. That's just being cheap. So, I flagged the server down and explained to her that I don't normally ask to switch my food but the wrap just too chewy and asked her to switch it for the whiskey river BBQ chicken sandwich.  She did and the sandwich came out shortly later. Much better. When we got the bill, we found out the sweet potato fries were an up charge of $1.50. I don't mind paying for better things but I wish the server would have advised me when I ordered them. Of course the chicken sandwich was more expensive by a few dollars too, but I kind of figured it would be. My server was very good and the replacement food was brought out by the manager I think. Thought he did not state so himself. I will come back to red Robin because they took care of the problem effectively,  but I will never get a wrap from them again.", "business_id": "-GYx5GAx_-4XEsn7mFwdkA", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-12-18", "type": "review"}

That's right the floor, so you can imagine this is not the most elegant place. \n\nEvery night has some drink specials and a decent selection of beers as a good bar should. The food is well executed bar style menu expect to see your cheese laden and fried foods. \n\nI brought a friend here who had a particularly bad week and day, I did not think anything could cheer her up.

Ray location would get 5 stars if only they could do a few more little things to make their service perfect, because their food already is! \n\nYesterday's visit with my hubby at 3:30 p.m. (on a Saturday) - we were one of only two tables occupied in the restaurant side. The bar side was hopping and noisy! We felt a little ignored because the wait staff was so focused on the bar side. When we were served, we immediately asked for tartar and BBQ sauces, and by the time we asked a second time (the first guy forgot us completely), our food was almost cold. But still great. They switched our plates - hubby got the well-done, I got the medium-well burger, and it was too late by the time we realized it to switch back (after the condiments were on). Ugh. \n\nIf we were served by the same person who waited on us, these mistakes wouldn't have happened - it's the result of having 2-3 people coming to our table. Plus they charge extra for tartar and BBQ - .50 each. Really? I've never had this happen at any other restaurant. \n\nBut this is still one of our very favorite local places!!!", "business_id": "7-4FxYXhNUS2lhpUb_q5-w", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-02-12", "type": "review"}

Since I am a vegetarian I highly recommend the ultimate grilled cheese sans bacon.  It's not the healthiest thing you could ever have, but it goes great with a Snake-Bite.  I also appreciate that any of their burgers can be ordered with a veggie patty so you can switch up from the grilled cheese every once in awhile.

The service, food, and ambiance varies greatly from day to day and also lunch to dinner.\n\nThe good:\n- This is where I come for wings. They have a great selection of flavors & sauces, and after having wings elsewhere, I came back to Teakwoods. Generally, the wings are big, juicy, and slathered with sauce.\n-Daily specials, always something new\n-Peanuts at your table while you wait\n-TV screens everywhere\n-Live music on the weekends\n-Occasionally they offer Groupon deals- $15 for $30 of food? Yes please!\n-Happy hour specials (though I've never once made it here during their selected times)\n\nThe bad:\n-Drinks. Both alcohol and nonalcoholic drinks here leave much to be desired.\n   * The bartender has a very weak pour on their daily specials, so what looks like a good deal at $3.50 a glass will end up taking you 2x as many drink orders as normal.\n  * I think they use tap water for their teas and drinking water. It taste so horrible, I've had to send drinks back several times and I just don't order them now. If you are thirsty, get a soda.\n-Food quality during lunch hour. You'll have better luck around dinnertime, but slower service. Lunches here have been disappointing about 50% of the time. \n-During sports games, you do NOT want to bring your family here, even if its right after church. It will be super crowded and don't be surprised if you are seated next to a boisterous, foulmouthed gang of disrespectful adults who scream their heads off every goal.\n-Prices jumped 15% after they got voted 'Best of Phoenix' for their wings.", "business_id": "7-4FxYXhNUS2lhpUb_q5-w", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-02-14", "type": "review"}

Our drinks would usually take about 15 minutes to make it to us and our food orders were wrong for 2 out of 3 people at our table.  I had to ask for a side of ranch 3 times before it finally showed up and by that time, about 15 minutes, my food was cold and the other 2 people that were seated with me had finished their food.  \n\nFinally we decided to leave and asked for our bills.  It took 4 tries before she got the bills correct.  Each time she would put someones food with another persons drinks and totals were off.  We kept repeating what each of us had ordered but she would just interrupt and say that she knew what it was and would fix it.  Four tries later she got it right.  Believe it or not, no exaggeration, it took us about 25 minutes to pay the bill because she kept making mistakes.  \n\nOn a good note the food is usually very good, I like the peanuts at the table, and it's a great place to watch the games.  I feel that the management in this place needs to pay more attention to what is going on. The prices I've noticed have gone up but the quality of service has definitely gone down.

The service is also unsurpassed.", "business_id": "JMOK_Sy6aSOZwd4qgkX7hg", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-01-10", "type": "review"}

Nothing fancy, no hughty attitudes, no faux ideals just really good food served by really friendly people plus some of the best music ever pressed in vinyl!\n\nSandwiches, salads, pizza and calzones along with wonderful wings and other things are really the entire menu. But the execution is flawless.\n\nWe have begun with Roasted Garlic Parmesan Bread and the Beer Battered Mozzerella Chees Triangles. Both are worth the trip. The bread is \"Flancer's Bread\" made fresh everyday right there. It is the same bread that all of Flancer's delightful sandwiches are served on and is so good that you won't leave any crusts behind. The cheese is a unique take on a bar food favorite and is served with a chipotle marinara sauce that was so good I wanted to poor it on everything.\n\nThe salads are all available in either small or large formats, but be warned; only the very hungry or an exhibishist eater is going to finish a large salad in one sitting. They are HUGE! We decided on small salads next time. But size is nothing without taste, and Flancer's salads are worth every penny. The \"Tenderloin is the Night\" salad is a wonderful creation with greens, marinaded roma tomatoes, crumbles of gorgonzola cheese, croutons and grilled beef tenderloin. Add in thier homemade gorgonzola dressing and you have art in a bowl.\n\nThe sandwiches are as varied as they are delicious,  the flagship is the Chile Verde Birdie, a turkey sandwich that knows no peer! Freshly roasted turkey breast sliced from the bone, provolone, lettuce, tomato and an out of this world New Mexican green chile mayo, on that awsomely tasty Flancer's Bread!\n\nMy personal favorite is the Parmesana Nirvana Chicken that is everything you would expect and then some. But here's a tip; ask you waiter to serve it with Flancer's chipotle marinara instaed of the regular marinara (which is wonderful, but I like the kick in the chipotle!) and you'll get a hot, cheesy, spicy delight of a sandwich. Extra napkins are highly recommended!\n\nIf you decide on fries you've made a wise choice as these seasoned crispy lovelys are on the list of best fries anyplace. Hot and tender with just a touch of spice, and unlike other sandwich shops they stay hot. (Or maybe we ate them so fast they didn't have time to get cold.) Either way they were great. Tip; ask for a side of Flancer's Gorgonzola Dressing to dip the fries in, I was surprised how much I enjoyed this!\n\nWe have not yet tried thier pizzas, but if the calzones are any indicator, (and they usually are), you'll never call Pizza Hut again! The calzone we had was the \"Nice to Meat You\" which is a carnivor's delight. Pepperoni, sausage, ham and ground beef with an extra helping of cheese! Serve with a side of marinara, (or even the chipotle marinara!) and you have enough food for 3 or 4 average people, or 2 really hungry ones! Wonderful!\n\nAlso found on the menu are a number of burgers, pasta dishes, soups and desserts. All of which we have not got to try yet, but we are patiently working through the menu and have found nothing to be disappointed in yet.\n\nTruely it is wonderful to be saying \"so long\" to the rubberstamped restaurant clones of America and discovering little gems like Flancer's Cafe! Chain restaurants may be fine, but in these troubled economic times I do not want to receive \"average\" for my hard earned money. Why settle for bland when for the same price you can have \"outstanding\"?!\n\n****************************************************************************\n\nJust after the beginning of 2009 the owner at Flancer's Cafe did something unprecedented in the land of small business, he LOWERED his prices!!! Even more oddly the portion sizes have not change one iota nor has the quality of the food changed, only his margin. \n\nWhat a terrific thing to do for us customers in these lean financial times!", "business_id": "JMOK_Sy6aSOZwd4qgkX7hg", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-01-14", "type": "review"}

I get ranch with them....mmmm.  If you go there and don't get them, or at least try 1 fry you are depriving yourself of pure ecstasy.  Honest.\n\nI always get their philly cheesesteak sandwich.  I could eat one everyday of my life probably.  Their fresh bread is amazing, crusty goodness.  I haven't tried any of the other sandwiches (I don't venture out much with my menu selections) but friends and family I've gone with never complain about their choices.  Their hot-wings are pretty dang good too.\n\nThe staff has always been super friendly and they are willing to do any special requests...food wise.

We ordered the mozz triangles to start because we were famished and then I got the bacon and gorgonzola burger.  The mozz triangles were really yummy with gooey cheese on the inside and surprisingly crispy outsides.  The fries with my burger were really quite good and seasoned well.  The burger is where things fell a little flat.  The meat tasted completely unseasoned and was very well done.  I much prefer medium, but there are certainly places where a well done burger can still be tasty and juicy.  This really wasn't one of them.

I wish I could eat here every single day.\n\nI've only been twice (sadly) but will be going here often now that I've discovered them.\n\nAbsolutely DELICIOUS.  YUMMY.  TASTY.  AWESOME.\n\nFirst time we went a little nuts and ordered a couple appetizers as well as sandwhiches.  Had the Goat Cheese Bruschetta as well as the Green Chili Mushroom Phyllos.  Both delish, but very different.  The bruschetta is for balsamic vinegar lovers.  The phyllos are for mushroom/cream cheese lovers.\n\nFor sandwiches we had the It's About Thyme Chicken and Still Crazy After All These Years Veggie (we split them, of course, I'm not that much of a pig!).  They were both HEAVENLY.  Can I use that word to describe sandwiches??  Well I am.  The chicken is full of mushroomy-cheesy goodness, and the veggie was so unique with the beer battered mozzarella!\n\nThe 2nd time we went, I ordered the Chile Verde Birdie Turkey and was mildly disappointed, I think because I was expecting it to be a hot sandwich and got a cold one instead (my bad for not reading the menu carefully enough).  If I had read the menu more carefully and knew what to expect I would have been much more pleased with it.  My fault, not theirs.\n\nOh, both times had the prickly pear lemonade (spiked of course) - very tasty.\n\nThe only knock I will give this place is the guy who might run the place (not sure, either that or he wishes he did).  Both times we've come we wanted to sit on the patio outside and he gave us trouble each time about it.  Really?  Then why have a patio??\n\nBut I am still giving this place 5 stars because I so LOVE, LOVE, LOVE their food.

I would be thrilled if I could write an 8 page diatribe that makes you drool because I describe the various tastes so well.  But I can't.\n\nWe hit this up on the recommendation of a friend on a Friday night.  Of course it's Friday in Gilbert, so we know it might be a little busy, but only one group was waiting when we got there. \n\nWe walk in and wait, and someone comes up to us and says \"2? It will be a few, what's your name\" and then walks off after putting our name on the list.  I grab 2 menus and we start to wait.\n\nThe food must be great here, because the place was packed!  We watched, stomachs growling as plate after loaded plate was set out for delivery to the dining masses. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, we decided to grab a seat outside, as we kept getting trampled by the staff (it's not a big place.)  We sit, and see that there are now quite a few people waiting, all but the one group having arrived well after we did.   And then the magic moment came, several groups had finished their meal and were on their way!\n\nThe group before us (about 5 or 6 people) were seated, and we continued to patiently wait.  At this point it had been 20 minutes, which in my mind exceeds the \"a few\" we were quoted upon arrival, but we were willing to be chill and wait it out.\n\nThen....(insert dramatic mood music here) a server came out and called a name on the list.....it was not my name, and no one in the line responded to it.  She called it a few more times, and someone who just walked in 5 minutes before stood up and said did you call Becky (name changed to protect the stranger) - not even close.  The server said \"No, but come on anyhow\" and allowed this person to jump the line.  At that point we had enough hunger and thirst and went elsewhere.\n\nI cut a LOT of slack to servers, especially when they are busy, but the attitude and the service we saw in the 20 plus minutes of simply waiting left us cold.

I had heard of multiple tap takeovers and other events so I was excited to see what beers they had on tap.  All that stuff must have been at the other Flancer's location, because this location didn't look like it even had taps or a bar.  My husband ordered an imperial IPA from New Belgium that he thought was pretty good (in a bottle) and I ordered the prickly pear spiked lemonade.  There was not much prickly pear flavor, but you could tell the lemonade itself was fresh squeezed.  \n\nThe sandwiches were the real highlight of our visit.  I got a sandwich with pork, arugula, tomato relish and onions.  It was amazing!  The bread was incredibly soft, but it still had a chewy outer coating so the sandwich didn't fall apart.  My husband got the Philly and he really liked it.  He is very hard to please when it comes to Philly sandwiches.  He was a huge fan of the bread.  I really liked the green chili mac and cheese too.  The jalape\u00f1o mashed potatoes were insanely hot, but if you're into that, they are right up your alley.

I got the salad when we could not get a wheat crust pizza larger than 10 inch for the hubbie and I to share.  He said the pizza was okay, but it didn't look appetizing to me.  The bread that came w/ my salad, loaded w/ parmesan cheese, was tasty, but for a carb watcher, too much.  Now that I think about it, I don't remember the taste of parmesan on the salad.\n\nMy biggest knock on the place:  the lager beer selection.  American lagers only.  I don't care for American lagers.  Bud Light makes me burp, a lot, and American lagers to me lack the flavor of a Stella, Phuket, Corona, Peroni, etc.  For a restaurant that offers beer pairings, they need to overhaul the lager selection for those of us not into ales.

Listening to \"looking out my back door\" by ccr was a plus one. \n\nOnto the main course: I had the prickly pear chicken sandwich with a side of green chili Mac and cheese. \n\nSammich: I will stop short of calling this the best sandwich ever created, but will say it is the sandwich that has everything you have ever needed. The chicken is slightly opaque and vibrantly pink in color (poached? Baked?) with a subtle sweet and sour flavor and a unique tang I can only think to be the flavor of prickly pear. This, coupled with a slightly spicy yet creamy green chili spread was the perfect balance of sweet, sour, heat, and salty. Topped with well shredded lettuce that was enough to play on cold and hot (and not too much that the sandwich imploded on it self like a collapsing star), made this sandwich second to none. \n\n*quick note in the baguette, hands down the best I have had. Most French baguettes used for sandwich are hard and crusty for an overbearing amount of flaky texture that it just feels like biting into a giangtic non sugary piece of captain crunch that destroys the roof of your mouth. This, however, is incredibly soft in the middle and lends itself well to the filling. With a crunchy and cheery crust that makes it incredible. \n\nMac and cheese: I am typically a purist for Mac and cheese and don't like any additional inherited (from the school of thought of \"stopped putting tomatoes, broccoli, or chicken on Mac and cheese, it isn't meant to be healthy\"). This however was perfectly cooked pasta, lightly dressed in a spicy green chili cheese sauce. Could eat this forever.   \n\nAs far as price, it isn't that expensive.

The boneless wings were pretty good in their own right but didn't really make us think of wings.  They were more like chicken nuggets albeit a class above fast food.  I personally didn't like the flavor of the steak in my quesadilla but I did like the cheese and the crispiness of the tortilla.  I would order a cheese quesadilla in the future.  \n\nThe restaurant.com deal we had was for $25 and we needed to spend $50+.  After the food and two beers each we were still only at $40 something so we also had J\u00e4germeister shots which put us over our minimum.  I thought their pour was very generous for the shots.\n\nWe just returned from our second time here.  This time we had the regular wings.  They have a mild and extreme sauce.  We asked if they could do something in the medium range and they were able to accommodate us.  We chose the blue cheese over the ranch option for sauce. We were happy with our wings.  They had a spicy tangy flavor without being too hot.  \n\nWe shared the Big Boy burger (Just like Bob used to make only better! One patty\nand our secret sauce).  We chose the double patty option and added cheddar. We also had the seasoned fries and onion rings.  The onion rings were pretty good. The fries were a bit bland so I asked for more of the blue cheese as I despise catsup.  That helped a lot.  The burger was tasty and it actually reminded me of a Bob's Big Boy even though it's been many years since I've had one.\n\nWhen I was in Bisbee a couple of weeks ago we met a couple who were drinking Moscow Mules which I've never even heard of.

It's about 1/4 of the height of an In-n-Out grilled cheese, the lettuce and tomato are on the sad wilty side, the bun was cold (if I hadn't been rushed through ordering I could have gotten it toasted apparently), and there was only 1 slice of cheese. Truly a sad little grilled cheese. Whattaburger has a decent green salad and the french fries are delicious. On another (late night) trip here I got the breakfast and liked it a lot more.

That said, Whataburger serves a quality (for fast food) burger. If you're complaining, with all the options Whataburger offers, you just didn't order it correctly. I always ask for grilled onions.\n\nBreakfast is served until 11:00 a.m. What distinguishes Whataburger from other fast food breakfasts is their limited use of the microwave oven. Order pancakes, and you will receive pancakes freshly prepared on the spot, not pulled out of a freezer and zapped. Since they operate more like an old style short order cook, they'll customize virtually anything for you. Want your bacon crisp? No problem. Want a side of scrambled eggs? No worries.\n\nThe people at this location are very nice. I used to take my mother here for breakfast 2-3 times a week when she was a snowbird. She loved the free senior coffee and we'd split a meal. Always out the door for $6-8, which is what a nice breakfast for two cost in 1973, the benchmark year to which she seems to compare prices. The staff would often help me with her wheelchair and engage her small talk, a big deal when you're disabled. I was surprised, well maybe not that surprised, to see one of the same nice servers still there on this recent visit. \n\nIt's also great that you can settle in and read... while waiting for your breakfast to be prepared. They deliver it hot to your table when ready. It may take a minute or two longer than the microwave competitors, but it's worth it. The dining room is also much more relaxing since they updated it and said goodbye to the Whataburger orange and blue!\n\nA five star Whataburger location.

The food is good, usually better tasting burgers then your average fast food. I go here often for the variety of options (burgers, chicken, salads, baked potatoes, chili, etc). The staff is nice and the location is clean. During lunch they are usually pretty busy, the store only has 2 cash registers and there is usually only one employee taking orders. Once I put my order in the food comes out really fast which partly makes up for the long order line. Not really a negative but something to make note of is that they have only one of those new touch screen coke soda machines. It's nice to have but people are idiots and take forever to figure out what they want / how to use it. Another thing that is that their parking lot is terrible! They have maybe a dozen spots, other wise you have to park across the street, which is always blocked by cars waiting to take a left turn.

Now that sentence does contain pretty many qualifiers; I do, of course, have to be craving hot dogs; and I wouldn't drive any great distance to feed that craving. \n\nNonetheless, Ted's is decent for many reasons. All hot dogs and hamburgers are charcoal grilled, the sides are served in large portions, and they have many different toppings. \n\nNow there is another very similar charcoal grill restaurant in Tempe that offers hot dogs and hamburgers -ach*chuckbox*oo- but their fare is more hamburger friendly. Ted's offers regular, foot long, and all beef franks, as well as Italian, Polish, and White Hot Sausages. Anything char-grilled is  good in my book, but the Italian sausage with peppers and onions is great. They also have the traditional toppings like ketchup, mustard, pickle, onion, tomato, etc. \n\nThe sides are dropped right when you order them, served in a basket wrapped in paper to hold it all together.  Both the fries and onion rings are good, but I prefer the fries because of the batter on the rings. While only having two side items is limited, they are a decent price.\n\nThere is one thing that I don't recommend ordering here, which is why I give them three stars instead of four. Coming from Cincinnati, one of the most important preparations of a hot dog is the chili cheese coney. I went here tonight in search of a coney similar to that of Skyline in Cincinnati: a fried dog served on a steamed bun with bean-less, finely ground chili and heaps of shredded cheese. No charcoal grilled hot dog should be covered in chili, the chili itself is pretty thick, the cheese was nacho cheese, and the hot sauce was more like salsa. I definitely will never order a chili cheese dog here again. \n\nThat being said I would point anybody in need of a grilled hot dog or sausage to Ted's.", "business_id": "jJhNOhuGpIsJX5SEUFFWYQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-12-27", "type": "review"}

For me it all started on a warm August day in the late eighties.  I was heading north from Tucson to start my undergrad career at ASU and the friend I was following drove straight to Ted's instead of Manzanita (Spanish for \"tall ugly dorm with many drunk kids\").  Thus began a love affair that only grows stronger to this day.  Footlong Chili Dogs got me through a lot of hangovers and somewhere along the way college came and went, grunge came and went and my mullet came and went.  Then after college it was the All Beef Jumbo that got me through the trials and tribulations of being young, single, and semi-gainfully employed -- a few less hangovers, but still plenty of nitrates.  Then as a slightly older family man the White Hot has emerged as the sausage of choice for weekend trips with the Toddlers.  I even purchased my most recent residence perhaps partially because Spiro (the owner and son of \"The Ted\") lives across the street (ok - so maybe not the best approach to real estate decisions, but clealy Hot Dog obsessions can't be blamed for the entire real estate bubble).  This place is one of the last old school ASU spots and I pray that Spiro has a succession plan in place if he ever decides to retire.\n\nUpdate: It just occured to me that this posting could be a bit more \"review-ish\" and a bit less autobiographical, so here goes.  All the aftermentioned dogs are awesome.  The condiments are perfect...the mustard and \"hot sauce\" are proprietary and worth purchasing in jars to take home (the white hot with mustard, hot sauce, onions, and a pickel is as good as it gets).  The Chili is ideally matched with cheese and onions on the regular, footlong, and all beef jumbo.  The onion rings are the best in town.  The only complaint I have is the liquid cheese, but I've come to accept and even appreciate it a bit over the years.  The milkshakes are good, but a bit small for the price.  There...hopefully that's enough superlatives.  Get there before noon to avoid the lines.", "business_id": "jJhNOhuGpIsJX5SEUFFWYQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-01-26", "type": "review"}

I always bookmark them because although I never know when I'll be in that part of the country, I do know those bookmarks will eventually become tourist destinations for me.  My yelp bud Tim S. knows his comfort foods.  When he raves about a pizza in New York, a cheesesteak in Philly, or a hot dog in Phoenix, I'm so there.  Wait a Hot Dog in Phoenix?  That can't be right.  This ain't Chicago or New York.  Or is it?  Ted's is a Buffalo, NY Hot Dog blooming right here in the middle of the desert, transplanted in 1983 from it's 1927 original wintery environment.  \n\nSometimes when you are a food tourist, it's ok to over order and try a few different things.  It's not ok for your waistline, but \"Hey you're on vacation!\"  At least that's what I tell myself.  And I got absolutely no judgement from Ted's when I ordered a Regular Hot Dog, a Jumbo All Beef dog, an Italian Sausage, and a Bratwurst.  Chased down with some Onion Rings and a Loganberry Milkshake.\n\nSo what makes Ted's so good, is the charcoal.  As I came in, they were adding a bunch of new charcoal to the grill.  It gives the dog a nice smokey flavor and a good snap.  Each of my 4 dogs/ sausages were excellent and it's tough to choose which one was best.  I actually think I preferred the basic hot dog, because of the soft grind of the wiener offset with the crunchy slightly charred casing.  It was texture heaven for sure, and I got this one dressed in classic Chicago style - chopped onions, relish, tomato, pickle, and yellow mustard.  I dressed the all beef with kraut and chopped onions - excellent dog although a little firmer in texture, as most beef dogs are.  \n\nThey have polish, bratwurst, italian, and a white hot under their sausage menu.  I read a couple of slightly negative reviews on the white hot, so while it sounded very interesting, I had no room to put one down on this visit.  Italian and Bratwurst it was for me and I got them dressed the same way with grilled onions and peppers.  I opted for the hot sauce on the side.  The hot sauce pairs perfectly with the Italian Sausage.  This is a nice and spicy Italian.  Adding the hot sauce seemed to just reinforce that same flavor, rather than cover it up.  Ted's has an interesting home made hot sauce.  If you made a salsa out of hot dog condiments, this is what you would get - relish, onions, in a ketchup vinegar base.  For the bratwurst I went straight up with some brown deli mustard.  Awesome!   Next visit, I'm trying a chili cheese dog for sure.\n\nThe onion rings taste like an onion loaf, but not super peppery.  They have a great batter here, but I like that you can still taste the onion and there isn't too much batter.  The Loganberry shake is a must order.  The perfect sweet creamy drink to offset the spicy Italian Sausage.  From what I understand loganberry is a Western NY flavor, because you don't see it around these here parts too much.  It's like a red blackberry.  I have no idea if it was loganberry flavored ice cream or vanilla ice cream with loganberry syrup.  Whatever it is, order it and you will be happy.  I can't wait until the next time I'm in Phoenix (or Buffalo) to get me a charcoal grilled dog at Ted's. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/teds-hot-dogs-tempe?select=HYh6Dv4htWxebTjRMwgh6g#OCLoB-p-pzUUNcCib8xK-Q", "business_id": "jJhNOhuGpIsJX5SEUFFWYQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-02-04", "type": "review"}

When walking into this establishment I immediately heard music from the 1950s and 60s. I could smell the meat cooking on the grill and I felt like I was in another world. I looked over Ted's menu and some of the signage and became aware that this place is tied to and related to a chain of \"Ted's Hot Dogs\" found in Buffalo New York. \n\nThe line was fairly considerable on my initial visit and after perusing the menu I settled on an all beef hot dog, onion rings and a soft drink. With the hot dog I decided to make it as close to a Chicago style hot dog as possible. So I asked for mustard, relish,, onions, tomato, and a pickle slice.  I took the dog to an open table and dug in. The taste of the sausage here is definitely different than the steamed Chicago style dogs I'm used to. One primary reason is that everything (well all the meats) at Ted's is char grilled. This gives a nice grilled flavor to it, the actual hot dog used had an unusual filler taste with a somewhat sweet flavor rather than spicy. All things considered it was a strange mix.\n\nThe onion rings weren't so great, these were very thin onion peels deep fried. While they were plentiful there was very little onion and just lots of batter. I'd say I was a bit disappointed with them.\n\nSince I've been in Arizona for quite a few days I did decide to return to Ted's and try things just a little differently. I went for a footlong dog which was only a little more expensive on my second visit. And rather than go for the toppings mentioned above I opted for Chili. The footlong dog was a great value and while the chilli was an extra 60 or so cents, I felt this was a much better dog than the one I ordered the first time and a lot of food for the money.\n\nI ALSO got a regular cheeseburger, this was fairly standard and tasted like most burgers that come off of a backyard grill. Not bad, but nothing worth writing home about.\n\nMy overall opinion of Ted's is that I love the ambiance and atmosphere, the food is pretty good and it's a good value if you go for the giant footlong hot dog. I am going to give Ted's Hot Dogs four stars and a recommendation if you happen to be in Tempe Arizona.", "business_id": "jJhNOhuGpIsJX5SEUFFWYQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-02-06", "type": "review"}

The bun was typical; nothing that went above and beyond the Wal-Mart buns-in-a-bag experience.\n\nI also had a jumbo burger. 1/3 pound. It was cooked okay; medium-rare in parts, medium in others. I suspect they were trying for medium. The toppings were acceptable and the bun was pretty good. The meat itself tasted unseasoned, but was fine. \n\nWe had a milkshake, too. Loganberry. Theoretically. It tasted like strawberry, and when I asked for confirmation that it was not strawberry, the staff offered to remake it. Okay, I thought this may be a gambit to save face--fine, let's let them remake the drink. I was told that they'd bring it out to us, so I sat down at the table. We were later \"greeted\" by an employee carrying our milkshake. She slammed it down on the table without comment (slopping some of it over the edge of the cup), and spun on her heel and returned to the service line. \n\nAll in all ... I really, really, really hope they had an \"off night.\" We won't be going back, which is sad--all I wanted was a tasty hot dog served by folks who were friendly. I don't care that I'm being fleeced for a hot dog; I'll pay $4 for one if it is good and comes with quality service and preparation. If our evening is any indication, Ted's Hot Dogs has a long way to go with staff training and quality of sides. I appreciate that QSRs are hard things to staff well, but just hiring folks that are somewhat friendly and want customers to come back may be a good start.", "business_id": "jJhNOhuGpIsJX5SEUFFWYQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-01-24", "type": "review"}

I really hate to do this because they are a small operation and I don't like to throw them under the bus. \n\nI had a kraut dog and a chili cheese dog. I thought they would be great considering they were charbroiled. Hot dogs are really best when grilled, right? Well, I would not prefer these over wienersnitzel. They didn't wow. \n\nThe service was meh. I was jazzed and told them I have lived in the valley for 17 years and have driven by and always thought  I should try that place someday...I announced that today was the day and what should I have. They acted as though I was an idiot. They may be right but humor me and recommend something or at least make me glad I decided to visit. They were just like shrug, shrug, meh. \nWhatever, they're fine. Nothing special. I will probably drive by for another 17 years.", "business_id": "jJhNOhuGpIsJX5SEUFFWYQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-02-04", "type": "review"}

I rarely award more than 3 stars.  My definition of 3 stars is a good, solid meal with good service.  It is a place that I recommend you try and a place I will likely return to.  \n\nThe food here was tasty and the value for what you pay is within reason.  The staff was friendly and attentive.  Both made for a positive dining experience.\n\nTonight I had a chili dog and onion rings.  The onion rings ROCK! Yum!\n\nTake a chance and eat here.  I think you will enjoy it.

So I tried the regular hot dog, cheese fries, and vanilla shake for my first time. The hot dog was just okay but felt that I could have made a better choice by picking something else. Cheese fries were decent and I did like how the cheese came in a separate container cup. The vanilla shake was one of the best shakes that I've had and I have gone through plenty of milkshakes over the years in my travels. I will definitely be coming back to get that again.\n\nThere's not too much of an atmosphere here as there is more emphasis on them serving customers and it can hard to find an available table when it's busy. However this seems like a great spot for take-out as the food is prepared rather quickly. This restaurant has been here for many years and it's easy to see why it has been around for so long.", "business_id": "jJhNOhuGpIsJX5SEUFFWYQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-02-22", "type": "review"}
