When we went on a friday night, there were only about 7 tables occupied, with my friend and I sitting alone at the sushi bar.\n\nWe came here because we wanted sushi and rolls.  None of the pittsburgh restaurants seem to specialize very much in rolls, and of the sushi restaurants near shadyside/oakland, this one seemed to offer the most number of rolls (please let me know if you know of other ones nearby that offer more!)  We got a 12 piece combination sushi platter, a kim's favorite roll (which actually seemed like two separate rolls totaling 16 pieces), and a spider roll.  While the sushi and rolls were of acceptable size, the fish was definitely not very fresh.  the spider roll was probably one of the most repulsive rolls i've tasted in a while.  the soft shell crab was fried beyond recognition, and it took too much effort to chew as the crunching resounded loudly within my head.\n\nMy friend and I also split a soon doo boo, which came with a bowl of rice and a few miniplates of banchan.  while the soon doo boo was acceptable, with a lot of tofu inside, the banchan was pretty underwhelming. broccoli, pretty weak kimchi, bean sprouts...\n\nand sadly our bill came out to be way too much for a regular sushi dinner. after tax and tip, my friend and i each paid ~35.  while the service was friendly, i will probably not be coming back here again.", "business_id": "dHDi4wCcjsOR6vcZ8oOIoA", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-11-13", "type": "review"}

At first I just thought the service is awful, and it takes a LONG time for the food to arrive. Eventually I realized that this place might actually be racist. If you are not asian/korean or if you come with people that are not asian/korean, you get served last. I have observed that Koreans that came in way later than we did were already served with their meals while we waited, waited, and waited some more. This observation really hit home when it was independently verified by a friend as he mentioned he observed the exact same thing. And he's half Korean. So there you go. If you are not Korean, expect crappy service and get your food after all the Koreans have been served, even if they came in way after you did.\n\nUpdate: We did an experiment the other night after playing tennis with a group of friends. We went there with majority of asian people (3 of us asian and one non-asian person, with one that can at least pronounce the food in Korean). And surprise! Prompt service.

We ordered what we always order at our favorite Korean place which is the Bulgogi, and mushroom tofu soup.  I figured these are very popular dishes, and easy measuring sticks to compare different places.\n\nThey give complimentary salad which includes iceberg lettuce... and teriyaki sauce.  No thanks.  \n\nBulgogi:  Really wasn't good at all.  It was too thick, the onions were 100% raw and there was no flavor beyond intense onion and poorly bbq'd beef.  It should be THIN, and TENDER, and FLAVORFUL.  Failed in all aspects\n\nTofu Soup:  Server asked how spicy we wanted it, and we said normal.  Apparently that means zero spicy or just adding 3 jalapeno slices into the soup.  That's authentic right?  They also use a very runny type of tofu, not the more firm stuff I have and like at my other spot.  It really had the texture of egg whites.  In fact, it had the exact texture of the egg white that was also in the soup.  So it was just watery flavorless broth, with textureless tofu and textureless egg b/c it wasn't hot enough to properly cook the egg.  Factor in the tough mushrooms that were obviously re-hydrated and you have a very poor dish.  \n\nThey stiffed us bowls or plates, unless they expected us to reuse the salad bowls so we had to wait around for a while to ask for something to eat on.  They also brought the dishes out at different times which is bad form.  \n\nThe best and worst parts were actually the sides.  What the hell are those shrimp, and why are they on my table?  They were dis-gus-ting.  Kimchi didn't taste fresh, bean things weren't that good, bean sprouts were too mature to be good and the cucumber thing probably sat around too long and got soggy like cucumbers like to do.  The daikon kimchi was the only solid side.    \n\nMy go to place is Cho Dang in Chandler for my Korean BBQ.  It blows this place away on all levels.  Their meat is of much higher quality, they actually include stone rice with their soup, serve amazing sides, and the atmosphere is a lot less cafeteria like.   To top it off it is about $5 less for the same exact order, but with larger portions of sides, rice, and meals.\n\nReally isn't a whole lot of good to say about this place.  I'd give it 1.5 stars, not quite bad enough to get a 1, but certainly not good enough to simply earn a \"meh\" rating.  I actually started this review by giving them 2 stars but as I started writing I realized there really wasn't anything positive I took away from the experience.  Couldn't even get an iced tea refill for the last 10+ minutes we were there.  Guess I'll still have to drive 15 minutes down to Chandler rather than 5 minutes to Mesa for Hodori.", "business_id": "PX3e3qtBx_5VC3vqq47jpQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-11-16", "type": "review"}

He's a big Korean food fan, and he's shown before that he makes some pretty good food choices. So I was pretty excited about the potential for this place, especially considering that I hadn't found a Korean restaurant here in Mesa just yet.\n\nWe were all sat quickly at lunchtime. Considering that there were about 12 of us, that's pretty good (and the place was mostly full). Our server was very attentive and came back regularly to make sure that we had everything we needed.\n\nThe menu is extensive. There are all sorts of choices, and there are a lot of choices that really piqued my curiosity. At some point, I'll try some of the more exotic items, but on this particular visit, I kept it rather basic and had #63 (Mae Un Dalk Bulgogi, which is Korean BBQ chicken marinated in a spicy sauce). To start, we had a few orders of #49A (Goon Mandu, which is pan-fried potstickers). And of course, there was kimchi and a variety of other sides that come with the meal.\n\nThe potstickers were tasty. A little crunchy on the outside, and with some of the sauce that comes with them, quite good. I normally don't eat many potstickers, but I had 3 of these.\n\nThe chicken comes served with white rice--nothing special about it. The chicken was nicely done. The marinade was excellent! The spice level was perfect, and the flavor was really good. I definitely enjoyed it.\n\nBut as I have often found with Korean food, the stars of the show for me were the sides. The marinated cucumbers, the kimchi, the seaweed--all excellent, all with really great flavors. Best of all are those potatoes. I don't know what they use to flavor the potatoes, but they are great! I could eat a whole plate of those potatoes, but unfortunately, they come as a small side. I'm sure that I could have asked for more, but with the size of the chicken platter (lunch portion, mind you) and the potstickers to boot, I was quite full.\n\nTo finish off the meal, there's a little dessert that I believe is a probiotic drink. It has an interesting and good, albeit a little medicine-y, taste to it. Always nice to encourage good digestion at the end of a big meal!\n\nI'll be back. And I'll try out some of the ox knee.", "business_id": "PX3e3qtBx_5VC3vqq47jpQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-11-03", "type": "review"}

As tasty as this fish was....and it was...this meal was almost impossible to eat because it was filled with hundreds of tiny bones. I don't think fish with this many bones should be on any menu anywhere. I do note the side dishes with kimchi, cucumbers and four other sides were tasty and mostly delicious. I thought they seemed above average. A better choice would have been the Black Cod with Radish but the price difference was just too much difference for lunch time. Mackerel was $13.99 and the black cod was something like $26.00. \n\nBack to service I wanted to ask questions about a few of the sides but nobody was able to check on us during the lunch.\n\nMy husband had the Kimchi Bokum Bap.(Ribeye in a hot stone pot with egg). We both thought the ribeye was tender and tasty but lacked any heat. I think some sort of hot Korean Sauce should have been given with this dish?\n\nThis is a place that I would re-visit but I do have some reservations about some of the dishes such as the mackerel and the lack of service. So for me that's three stars. Still a positive rating. \n\nI do note this was a holiday weekend and it's possible they might have been busier than expected and short on help.", "business_id": "PX3e3qtBx_5VC3vqq47jpQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-11-29", "type": "review"}

I don't care, because I love this place! I grew up eating here, and now I come here every single time I visit Scottsdale - AND I recommend it to everyone I know who visits as well. I've probably eaten twice my weight in Szechuan Stringbeans over the years, and triple my weight in Szechuan Eggplant + Tofu.\n\nHere's why I love it:\n\nIt's NOT OILY like most Chinese food places. It TASTES AMAZING (I highly recommend the Szechuan dishes). And they are willing to add or substitute items to your dish to FIT YOUR CRAVINGS. Beat that, Panda Suck-spress! And it's all MADE FRESH and FAST in a hot wok, right there in front of you!\n\nRecommendations: Get the loose-leaf hot tea, it's delicious and served in a fun mug. Get an order of the Szechuan Stringbeans (with your choice of protein, I recommend tofu), and an order of Szechaun Eggplant (also with your choice of protein), and douse everything in some healthy scoops of chili sauce to hike up the spice factor. You'll notice that the Szecuan sauce varies from dish-to-dish. The stringbeans are very sweet and savory with a thin sauce, while the eggplant's sauce is much thicker and more savory. Totally different, but equally delicious.\n\nHaving moved to LA, China Lite is like the \"one that got away\" - I measure every other Chinese food restaurant I try up to them, and everyone else can't help but pale in comparison.", "business_id": "aLZoFhOmDtonrWJzUzh8TA", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-10-23", "type": "review"}

I stumbled on it after a get together with some friends after our first semester of radiology school ended. It was my first KBBQ outside of California and after trying the others like Woo Ch\u00e9, Korean Garden and Kimchi Korean BBQ on the strip, Tofu Hut satisfies my palette and leaves me with a pleasurable stomach ache (from being soo full)! ;). Each and everytime I've come to this place, I'm with a huge group. Now, this place isn't super big but the staff, especially Rachel, is very accommodating and helpful. I'm not talking about groups of 6 or 8-- I mean groups of 12 and 15!  If you've been there already, you know what I mean.\n\nMost of the time, we visit this haven of BBQ late at night and go for the 13.99 special of AYCE. Aside from AYCE, they do have an ala cart\u00e8 menu as well. Their side dishes and salad are a bonus to the festive and colorful flavor of Korean cuisine.  My favorite is the pancake.  The pancake is a mix of vegetables fried with batter usually served warm.  The starchy texture brings more of a soft and chewy feel to the crunchy bunch of little appetizers they bring to you.  If you come a little earlier in the evening, you can order steamed egg that I like to mix my rice with! A twist for the Asian folks or anyone who likes fried rice. What can I say? I work with what I got to make it the best! Haha! And now for the meat:\n\nBrisket-- It's the most popular choice from the AYCE menu! The thin slices are easy and quick to cook and serve. They seem to burn really quick if you leave them on the grill for a minute longer as soon as they're browned.  Add a bit of soy sauce or lemon while it's on the grill for extra flavor! ;)\n\nRibeye (bulgogi) -- The meatier of the meats!  My personal favorite from the meat department.  The ribeye is very tender and takes a bit longer to cook. The flavor is exceptional and I suggest adding a bit more to the \nmajority of your choice of meat.  You can also order some garlic slices on the side that you can brown on the edges of grill! BOMB!\n\nMarinated Chicken-- My least favorite. It takes a while to cook and you can't eat chicken when it looks like a vampire bit into it's neck. Unlike the red mea of the meat family, the chicken isn't as flavorful but if you like chicken with a bit of a spice to it, take the patience to cook it off to the side and get back to it when you can because it does have kick!\n\nBeef tongue-- I was very skeptical about this one at first but after taking a chance to try it, it's really flavorful. It looks like the brisket so if you are only comfortable with having your own tongue in your mouth, ask your friends what's what before you start shoveling it into your face! ;). Burns quick, so pull it off the grill fast and enjoy!\n\nSquid-- you have to be with someone who knows how to cook this right. if you aren't and you decide to be Mr. Iron Chef, just know that if you over cook it, you'll feel like Fido at home chewing on rubber! Add some vinegar and hot sauce with some garlic chips and you're set!\n\nPork belly-- Looks like a big slab of bacon and it tastes pretty much the same. I like to cook this one extra crispy like I do my bacon! Add some sesame oil (the stuff in the tiny dish with salt in it) for extra MM MM flavor!\n\nNote: If you aren't a radish fan, don't eat the square vegetable in the reddish sauce, that's called daikon.

Tofu Hut. \n\nThis place most often comes to mind when finished drinking and partying on the strip, mainly XS, Tryst or Surrender nightclub, since it's right down the street. That being said, my most recent visits here have only been during these late night hours (open until 3am), so my review is based among these parameters. \n\nWith a name like Tofu Hut, you would imagine that this place would be a vegetarians' Shangri-la. Well, it used to be when it first opened about 5 or 6 years ago, serving mainly piping hot, Korean spicy tofu dishes. It seems now as their main focus has shifted towards catering towards the AYCE crowd, as 9 out of 10 times, diners are grilling meat on the table. This doesn't bother me much, as I'm an avid carnivore, but I understand how it can bother some. \n\nThe AYCE pricing during it's special hours is set at about $13.99 per person, but excludes certain items such as Kalbi and certain side dishes, which are available at an increased $16.99. The banchan (side dishes), are of your average bunch and are of average quality. The meats are also of average quality. My only gripe of this place is their kimchi is of the \"just-made\" type, as I prefer my kimchi aged and sour. They do still serve their full-menu at night, and the spicy tofu soups never fail, neither does the charred rice bowl at the end (Noo-roong-jee).\n\nThe service can be hit or miss sometimes, depending on when you go. Usually, if you're there after midnight, there is only one server working, so if there are several tables being serviced, it is a tad frustrating to wave them down if you're in need of something. \n\nRegardless, Tofu Hut is a good place to go if you're in the mood for some tofu soups, crave Korean at wee hours in the morning, or if you want to fill-up on Korean BBQ for a very reasonable price.", "business_id": "UKKz4HdQC0aH9j5lLi4u8Q", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-11-07", "type": "review"}

So what do I do when I get a text invite to do Tofu Hut AYCE at 11:30pm?\n\nIt was my first time there. I really didn't know about it. At $13.99, this place kills the $26 table-grilled item I ordered at Pho So 1 just a few nights ago. (Then again, you're probably supposed to share that one). For $13.99, you get to choose from everything but the last two items (short ribs and steamed egg); those are available at the $16.99 AYCE price, but we were happy with sticking to $13.99.\n\nWe started with Sliced Ribeye, Brisket, and Beef Tongue. The ribeye was the most flavorful, but I have a soft spot for beef tongue, nay, I freakin' heart beef tongue! The brisket was OK. We liked the ribeye so much, we ordered another plate. I also added Tripe Honeycomb to the mix. I love tripe too. It had a nice spice to it and charring it on the grill added nice flavor.\n\nOn our final round, we went with the Squid and Marinated Pork Belly. The squid was OK, but not a lot of flavor. The pork belly had good spice and went well with the steamed rice I had left (I wasn't eating much of it up to this point). Speaking of steamed rice, they bring out a plethora of side dishes to go with the meats - Kimchi, Pickled Cucumber, Pickled Radish, and other stuff I can't name. Everything that hit the table was delicious.\n\nOh yeah. My friend wanted to order OB, but they were out, so we settled for Hite. Not a bad beer, but nothing memorable.\n\nOverall, I have to give them four stars. Granted, it was my first time at any place that does that style of AYCE, but I fully enjoyed it. It was a fun time with some photographer friends that I hadn't seen in a while. Jason put it best when he said, \"I don't know if I needed the giant meat fest, but I sure enjoyed it.\" That's what she said?\n\nOne last thing: your clothes will definitely smell like food when you leave!", "business_id": "UKKz4HdQC0aH9j5lLi4u8Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-11-20", "type": "review"}

Pay a small price for a huge meal. OK so I know I am petite but I will devour a whole cow if the flavor is on point. And it felt like I did at my last visit at Tofu Hut. Alongside the Korean BBQ Short Ribs (Gal-Bi), I also had their soup and their steamed egg -- a MUST have.

(except for those vegetarians and vegans)...\n\nI am usually slightly picky on the ambiance and decor on the establishment (especially their restrooms) but you will overlook all of that once you grill the variety of meat and it will magically manifest into this heavenly, beefy aroma. It's like you're your own chef! As many Korean restaurants, they will also bring out the traditional little side dishes. You ought to try (and load up on) the salad as this is part of their side dishes too! Their dressing is a bit spicy but oh-so-flavorful. And going back on the decor, not that it was a dirty and ugly place, I would just recommend it to be more modern and more aesthetically pleasing to the eye since it is Vegas after all.

Ribeye\n2. Brisket\n3. Pork belly\n4. Short ribs*\n5. Steamed egg*\n\n*We only get these if we go before 11pm, since they charge you 16.99 instead of 13.99 if you get these items after 11pm.\n\nThe meats are almost always fresh, the brisket always has that bright red color, and of course it tastes great!\n\nOne thing that really made me a fan of this place was when we ate here one afternoon, the server actually taught us the correct order of cooking the meats. She said that you cook the non-marinated meats first before you cook the marinated ones. Being non-Korean, that was a very useful piece of information that she gave us, and it changed the way we ate KBBQ since then.\n\nThe thing I really don't like about this place is that it gets really packed during the weekends. They only have so many tables for AYCE BBQ, so the wait can be very long and gruesome (especially since you have to come hungry or else your dinner won't be worth the price). On our last visit here, they told us there was at least an hour wait, even though the two long tables were open, because they had a party of 20 coming in. We were starving, so we decided to get out of there and try out the neighboring KBBQ place. *Disappointed at Tofu Hut*\n\nAnother thing that I'm not a fan of is the service when it gets really busy. A few times, I had to practically hold my glass up in the air just so I could get a drink refill. They rarely ever come to check on you unless you signal them to do so, which makes it so hard to order the great meats and banchan that they offer.

Don't get me wrong, I love my AYCE, however, a tummy full of alcohol doesn't sit well with a tummy full of food that is mass produced such as buffet food usually is.\n\nOur cravings led us to tofu soup, and a Yelp search led us to Tofu Hut (in all honesty, we wanted to go to another place close by, but it's closed on Sundays).  Not going to lie, we were a bit weary of this place.  Knowing this place was an AYCE BBQ, we were a bit worried we'd come out smelling like BBQ, which would require more preparation for that night's festivities (a quick shower to wash away the BBQ smell).  Thankfully, they actually separate their BBQ side from the tofu side.  We were able to stay well away from the wafts of BBQ smells floating in the air.\n\nThe tofu soup was good, although, I should have probably not been so chicken and actually gotten at least medium instead of being a wuss and getting mild.  The spiciness would have definitely added more flavor and kick to the soup.  Not to say it wasn't good, it was.  I had the Beef and Seafood Soup, which made for a great blend of flavors.  It was also good know they didn't skimp on the fillings.  Had plenty of beef and seafood, as well as, of course, tofu.\n\nFour stars, because it was a hot day in Vegas that day, and I was downing my glass of water like a beast.

The food, for me, was always good. I actually never tried ayce korean bbq until recently--which I enjoyed very much. For $13.99 (lunch price) I got beef tongue and pork belly; and I also shared brisket and sliced bbq with my friend.  They came in huge servings, which made it difficult for two girls to finish all that meat haha. Banchan's were standard. I've always like fish cake, so that was my favorite out of the rest. Sundobu, or however you spell it, was also okay. Their customer service is so bipolar that sometimes, even though I will be craving to go back to this place from time to time, that I would just avoid Tofu Hut all together. I think ever since I've graduated from high school, I would only go here once a year. Which is sad since the food CAN be worth the trip. Bad service included: wait staff showing attitude; wait staff seems to be non existent for quite a while during our visit; complained about splitting the check; forgetting orders and kept reminding of order; had trouble asking for refills; and last, was that they kept giving my party dirty looks because we stayed there for hours (even though we'd still order some food).

The waiters will get everything for you. AYCE includes the typical side dishes you get at normal korean restaurants. Lately i havent been much of a marinated meats person, so if i go with my friend, our grill stays perfectly clean. All we order is brisket and beef tongue. Both not marinated, straight up sliced meat. Usually mainly the marinating sauces is what causes the burning and dirtying up of the grill. Rice and salad is included. \n\nThe al carte menu is not bad. I havent ordered anything other than the tofu soup or the tofu soup and bibimbap combo. Tofu soup is priced at i believe a little over $8 each. You get the normal side dishes, the tofu soup of your choice, and rice. The tofu soup and bibimbap combo, to me and a few friends, are a pretty good deal. The bibimbap is a typical korean dish with a lot of cut veggies and beef, served on top of rice, and given their gochujang? sauce (spicy sauce) for you to mix everything with. The tofu soup that it is combo'ed with is a mushroom tofu soup. Still good. Definitely fills you up. Price for the combination is i think only like $10. So not much more.

The type of tofu that is used in this particular soup is difficult to purchase non-commercially, so soups made at home will not be able to mimic this silky offering. The flavors are so delicious and indescribable. You can also choose the type of soup you want like Kimchee or Seafood, changing the overall flavor of the dish.

It comes with a bowl of rice and unlimited Pan Chan (side dishes).\n\nWhen I dine with certain people, I will also do the AYCE BBQ. It's not my favorite thing, but for $17, it's pretty awesome!

They give you the traditional sesame oil/salt mixture to dip your unseasoned meat in and a refreshing salad of cabbage and romaine lettuce. It's a modern twist on the traditional Korean dining method of wrapping the meat and rice in lettuce leaves called Sang Chu Ssam. I thought it was weird at first, but I've really grown to like it!

All the other sides didn't do anything for us. Our favorites were the marinated pork belly, short ribs, and marinated ribeye.  Forget about the other cuts of meat. They are bland and unseasoned. \nIm taking off one star for atmosphere..it could have been better ventilated. I came out smelling like korean bbq from grilling the meat. Also because of the wait staff.  They weren't the friendliest group.  Like...sorry I asked for more kimchee and meat! I dont need the smug attitude.

I mean really you cannot beat that price!! \n\nBut why 1 star?! Why am I updating my raving review about them?! Why am I probably never going to return to my once favorite KBBQ spot?! why you ask.. lemme tell you, it's because a little critter called a COCKROACH crawled its way across our chair we were seated at, and made it's way up against the glass window.. while we were still eating!!\n\nHad to get the attention of the servers that we had an unwelcome guest trying to join us.. and he quickly grabbed two menus to scoop up the critter to have it removed, and tossed it outside.. but I'm sorry my friend, where there is one seen.. there are always more to be found. There is NEVER just ONE COCKROACH.. and this one that was trying to join us was not full grown.. so somewhere are its mommy and daddy COCKROACH and siblings roaming around. \n\nThe server apologized.. and we could see the rest of the servers quietly talking about it among themselves at the register. To EXTREME disappointment, no management came to approach us to apologize for the incident that totally ruined our meal and appetite.. I was even about to order another round of brisket, but after that.. I could barely swallow what I was already chewing.. \n\nMy bf's dad, who works in hand with the health department and the USDA, was NOT HAPPY.. he asked to speak to the manager after they gave us the check.. which nothing was compensated for the horrific experience, and the server he was speaking to was playing dumb like she didn't understand what he was asking.. so he calmly said, \"Well, when you do speak to your manager, please let him know everything was really good. The food all tasted great and was good up until the COCKROACH.\" \n\nTo make this story even better.. is that this was my first time having dinner with my boyfriend's parents, it was their first time eating here at Tofu Hut, and it was their first time having KBBQ grill style, oh and it was me that recommended the place :/ I was SOOOOOO embarrassed because I had explained the concept of the restaurant and raved about how good it was, and the parents were even saying on the car ride there that they were excited to have AYCE meats.. \n\nMy boyfriend's dad was really upset and super disappointed that no type of management came out to apologize and talk to us, there was no sense of urgency, sincerity in the apology, or showing that there would be some kind of action taken. \n\nI originally gave this place 4 stars because I really did love eating here.. DID is key word. I had taken off 1 star for the decor being run down and old and menus being sticky, and the bathroom being nasty.. but after this experience yesterday on 10/07/15... that's something you never forget, and it really does make you sick to see COCKROACH running around while you're eating. And something needs to be done. And to physically see a cockroach run around with my own eyes, while I'm eating in a restaurant is something I would never wish on anyone to experience. I literally almost threw up right there. \n\nSo to end this review.. I'm sadden.. and disgusted to say that I will never be returning to Tofu Hut, no matter how good the meat is. It honestly saddens me to give this review and rating, but it's one thing to bitch and complain about terrible tasting food, or shitty service while dining.. but to be accompanied by a COCKROACH while eating raw meat that is being brought out to you is one a whole other kinda level. Oh, and my boyfriend's dad today did make a call to the Health Department.", "business_id": "UKKz4HdQC0aH9j5lLi4u8Q", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-10-08", "type": "review"}

This place is pretty cheap for how much food you get, and the little side dishes are cool. The reason why I'm giving two stars is because when my bf and I were eating, this lady was cleaning a table across from us. I kid you not, she took a napkin from that dirty table, dipped it into someone's water cup that was already on the table as well, and wiped the frame of the grill with it. I know it's just the frame, but that's still so unsanitary! I didn't even see her clean the grill itself, our grill was kinda oily and had burnt bits around the edges.

If you have, you are well aware that their service isn't all about smiles and chatting, but one of diligence and speed.  Some reviewers before me complained about the service being awful, but I assume they aren't used to the way things are run in places like this.  It may not be an excuse, but as long as I get my drink refills and food on time and they pass by and glance at our table to ensure that we are constantly well kept, I don't care if Chung Li smiles at me or not.  If they do their job well, I'm happy.\n\nWith that off my shoulders, let's get to the juicy review!  This is the sister restaurant of Maru in Summerlin, and I have to say that I prefer this place over Maru any day of the year.  We discovered this place on a whim after trying the restaurant below this one (it was horrid). We walked in and there's a faux well in the dining area and everything is clean and well kept.  That's always a good sign.  They seat you or you tell them where you want to be seated, you get the menu and begin the experience.\n\nThey have a variety of traditional Korean dishes, and with the Korean patrons eating there when we first arrived I knew this would be good.  We ordered our typical dishes--bulgogi and kalbi, shrimp tempura appetizer to start.  We asked that they cook it in the back, and they did.  Our tempura was out on our table within five minutes along with the usual side dishes.  I personally love the picked radish and croquette.  Their rokio is good, too, although not the typical white pearl onion version.\n\nOur food arrived promptly, and we waited no more than ten minutes (if that) for the food.  It was good.  I mean really, really good.  When the waitress brought out the salad and then--wait for it.....the radish beef soup,. i wanted to cry.\n\nLet me explain my need for this soup.\n\nWhen I was five years old my parents took me to a Korean BBQ restaurant back home.  They served this awesome clear broth soup with what I assumed was thinly sliced potatoes and maybe a touch or two of beef.  As simple as it sounds, it's a traditional soup appetizer to have with a Korean meal, and I've eaten it every time I had BBQ out at a restaurant.  For two and a half years we searched Korean BBQ places in Las Vegas for this appetizer, and for some reason none of them serve it.  Finally, after 2.5 years of searching, when the girl brought the soup out in its traditional low-rimmed bowl and I had to use the typical long-stemmed spoon to eat it, i teared up.  My childhood wafting in my face with the smells of radish and beef broth.  It was a great moment.  The soup is simple and contains nothing but clear brother flavored by the radish and beef, with thin slices of radish and one or two pieces of shredded beef in the bowl.  It's simply yummy.\n\nAfter eating two bowls of it along with the great BBQ and appetizer, I was stuffed and thoroughly happy. I craved the BBQ daily for a week and satisfied my craving for dinner that week.  I never get sick of bulgogi and kalbi.  \n\nWhen I finally cooked it at our table one night I decided that was the way to go from now on because I could burn my bulgogi a bit more than the cooks in the back would to get that sweeter flavor.  If you ever go to a Korean bbq place, cook it yourself.  It's fun and tasty!\n\nOverall, a great experience, and my only BBQ place where they serve my childhood soup.  I'm looking forward to more of their food again next week, and the week after, and the week after that.  I know that I sing high praises over the soup and the food, but it honestly is that good and is the only spot we will eat Korean food from now on.", "business_id": "v8TQwyxEj4or2Yng6y0S7A", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-09-21", "type": "review"}

And, I love her still.... as long as she does not become Mrs Piggy times 10... :)  call me Kermit (yes, the green lovable fella).\n\nBack to the review.  O.K.  This restaurant was a bit hard to find.  It is actually up on the second floor.  When you walk into the restaurant, it is very open, clean, and inviting.  It was a cool place.  I give Atmosphere a solid 4.\n\nService... well, let's say that our waitress started off strong.  Got us the water, the appetizers, and extras.  As the meal progressed, she kinda forgot about us.  We had to request more water, more food, and the check (we had to track her down).  I give this a 3.... should be lower, but she was sweet.\n\nNow, for the food.  Well, for $19.99, you had all you can eat.  However, they provided you with the variety tray.  After you finish the variety tray, you can add more of the one's you like.  Personally, I do not like this.  There are just some items that we do not like to eat... instead of wasting them, we ended eating anyways.   I rather CHOOSE the selection.  Most Korean restaurant provides you with a buffet cart to pick from.  I was a bit sad to not see Galbee ribs.  They had boneless instead.  Trust me, one of the great joys of eating a Galbee rib is sucking on the bone.  Yes, a bit disgusting. sounds a bit \"gay\".  hey, I am married, I can say that without thinking otherwise...LOL... and, by the way, like the Seinfeld episode... nothing wrong with being gay... they just have a different preference... okay... moving on... the veggies and appetizers were good/average.  This was a solid 3.\n\nOverall, the price was decent.  Food was very average.  And, Service was average.  As a result, a 3 sounds just about right!", "business_id": "v8TQwyxEj4or2Yng6y0S7A", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-10-13", "type": "review"}

I do not want to go into the sanitary and cleanliness of this restaurant due to Yelp rules but I will say that \"Dirty Dining\" should definitely investigate. \n\nHonestly not a big fan of Korean BBQ but family wanted to eat here. It's a All You Can Eat BBQ. You pick 1 out of the 3 menus they have which is of course 3 different prices. We went with the Vegas menu which was about $20 per person. You get to choose the meats that is on that menu. We went with Bulgogi, spicy pork, spicy chicken, and the family had cow intestines. Yes, INTESTINES! you already know I did not touch that at all. We also got an order of shrimp for the kids that is not included in the Vegas menu so it was an extra $25. They bring out little small plates, kind of like appetizers in the beginning. There was fish cakes, spicy broccoli, kim chi, jalape\u00f1os, mashed potatoes, horse radish, house salad, and soup. When the meats come out, There is a stove on the table and you actually cook it yourself. \n\nwe had a few different waitresses assigned to our table because we were a party of 14. One of them pulled the table without acknowledging my phone was on there and dropped it. Good thing it didn't break or else I would have went crazy on her. Our drinks came after we got the food which was pretty unacceptable. I was thirsty!

This is because the others are pretty thick and heavy or heavily marinated. They also just don't taste good. The brisket is thin, light, and full of flavor. If you need more flavor then use the sauces that they give you. \n\nThere are ladies who come around to help you cook and what not, but you honestly never need any of their help because come on.... if you're a man, you know how to grill, if you're a woman, you know how to cook.
