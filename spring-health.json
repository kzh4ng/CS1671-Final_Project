I initially made an appointment at another downtown office, but felt I needed a second opinion.

I'd hate for you to be turned away from such an awesome practice because of their rudeness and unhelpful attitude) by a referral of a friend/co-worker. \n\nI was in pretty bad shape for about a month, suffering really. Dr. Shaffer was simply amazing!  In the span of a week I went from being a 7-8 on pain scale of 1-10 having my husband helping me shower and dress to maybe a 5-6 which is a BIG relief of pain and being able to bend over and get my shoes on all by myself! He taught me proper movements, to alleviate some pain by less twisting and turning and how to elevate my lower half properly to take pressure off my spine.\n\nI could tell he was truly sympathetic to my case, and was detailed in explaining my diagnosis,  in a way I understood just fine...Im one who appreciates visual learning the most, he had models in order to explain his findings to me. I feel it's important that a Dr. explains his assessment and plan as one progresses through the appointment, and boy did he ever. I never once had a question about what a machine was or what he was doing next. A+! I was not uncomfortable at all, I felt well taken care of.  He has a great personality,  a great sense of humor, and very concerned about the wellbeing of his patients.  Truly an answer to my prayer to stop this pain! \n\nI noticed each morning I was there (although I was late SHAME ON ME!) I was in and out in a decent amount of time, and he was even answering his own phones and checking his own patients in and out. Absolutely seamlessly,  very efficient! I'm so impressed by everything in this office. \n\nI will NEVER go anywhere else.  Also-I forgot to mention that I am uninsured,  but his pricing was so affordable, seriously the only single time I was heaitant with this Dr. was after I asked how much it was going to cost and before he answered. Mostly because I had peviously shelled out my liver for the previous Dr. I'd seen who didnt help me at all. So if you are not insured, still do not hesitate to schedule with this Dr. it is affordable QUALITY,  COMPREHENSIVE care, your body will thank you. \n\n You'll also appreciate the folder he gives you at the close of your visit, you get in writing all of the steps he's taken and what you should expect in the days after you see him and before your next appointment. He stated that he also likes to pick a different educational article to give to all his patients every week, which I read and appreciated as well!\n\nA great review aside the best compliment I can give this Dr. is the referral of my friends, familes and co-workers.  You'll be happy you chose to rely on an online review and a referral to book an appointment with this Dr.! \n\nI guess the one negative thing I'd comment on is that he has short hours BUT that's no excuse, and not truly a negative.  If you need HIM to make your health care a priority than YOU need to make yours a priority as well, and take the appointment he or Erica gives you and make it work...afterall you are in a lot of pain, aren't you?", "business_id": "9b-YnpVt3P5Sk0_yUDaMGQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-05-31", "type": "review"}

That left me with the question of how short of an appointment did they schedule me for? Were they planning to do the X-Ray, consulting and cleaning in half an hour? I have been to many dentists around the country but never in my life I have had an exam, x-ray, new patient consultation and cleaning done in half an hour.

They also offer personal fitness training options (pay service) and they have a nice variety of free group classes that can be taken from open to close!  \n\nBecause this has more of an \"express gym\" feel to it, all of the cardio and weightlifting equipment is within close proximity.

In need of a prescription and not having much time to find a doctor,  I made an appointment with Dr. Stephens.  The woman I spoke to on the phone was Terry.  Terry's attitude through the entire phone call was snappy. She cut me off every time I started to speak.  I assumed she was just really busy and didn't let that sway my opinion.  \n\nAppointment day arrives.  I walked into the office and felt like I had entered into my early  90s doctor's office.  Awful old chairs,  the decor was terrible,  and the fluorescent lighting was so bright it hurt my eyes.  I signed in and was given the usual paperwork.  As I'm trying to listen to Terry to see what exactly I'm supposed to fill out,  there are a few people in the waiting area laughing and carrying on a conversation.  It made it extremely hard to hear what Terry was saying.  When I asked her if she could repeat herself she rolled her eyes and sighed.  Oh yeah,  god forbid you have to explain something twice.  \n\nI didn't have to wait too long for the nurse,  about 5 minutes.  I believe her name was Gail,  she was very nice... however, when I was trying to speak to her she also cut me off and spoke over me. The exam room I was in had posters taped to the wall,  it didn't appear dirty,  just kind of slapped together like a dorm room. \n\nEnter Dr. Stephens... she kind of spoke with me about my history,  and then launched into a lecture about me not having insurance. Excuse me,  no matter how well intentioned your speech may be,  it's inappropriate.  You do not know the specific circumstances surrounding my situation. It made me really uncomfortable.... now,  I've had some health problems before,  so having a vaginal exam is not only extremely uncomfortable,  but I'm always anxious during it.  Her lecturing me made me feel even more anxious.  As she started the exam it was VERY,  VERY uncomfortable, and I was trying to convey that to her and she said the standard, \"If you would just RELAX,  this wouldn't be so bad\" and then pushed my leg out of her way.  Thank you for totally disregarding the fact that I'm so anxious I'm drenched in sweat... and thanks for ignoring that I'm trying to voice my state of discomfort by just talking over me.  \n\nI was so glad it was over.

The staff people were obviously experienced in working with students and employees from the university, so they took care of my insurance paperwork without a problem.  The regular eye exam was performed in a quick and competent manner (less than 20 minutes).  If you don't have a preferred optometrist in the area, the office at Lenscrafters will do just fine for a prescription.   \n\nNext, I stopped by their shop to select new frames.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the attendants at Lenscrafters often seem overwhelmed by a mob of customers, so don't expect too much individual attention during the process of choosing frames.   \n\nI settled on a pair of everyday glasses and sunglasses.  I was told the sunglasses would be ready in 1 hour while they would have to order the parts for my everyday glasses.  The staff people  were very attentive and professional when fitting my sunglasses, making sure they sat on my face properly and even feeling the tightness of the metal behind my ear.  I walked out of Lenscrafters feeling fairly positive about the whole transaction...\n\n...Until today.  Almost 1 month has passed (exactly 25 days) and my everyday glasses are still being \"processed\" by their laboratory.   Each Monday, I've called the store to check the status of the glasses.  I'm always told that, \"Your order is still being processed\" or \"Your order will be shipping from our lab soon.\"  How is it that Lenscrafters requires 1 month to make a pair of glasses while every other optometrist in town advertises that they can have your glasses in a week or less?\n\nEach time I've called, none of their attendants attempt to explain the circumstances that are causing the delay.  Was there something weird about the lenses?  Did they stop manufacturing the type of frames I chose?  When I called again yesterday, the attendant who answered the phone told me that she would have to call the lab, and then call me back.  However, she NEVER returned my call (probably because she was buried under work orders from other customers). \n\nTo be fair, I think my case is a freak accident, and I am sure that there are dozens of happy customers who walk out of Lenscrafters everyday.  I feel that I can't deduct too many points from the store itself, because they do have capable employees and their manufacturer is probably more to blame for the missing glasses.  My biggest complaint is that this location obviously lacks sufficient staff to man the floor and adequately serve the number of people that come in.", "business_id": "R7oNZOg09xgqLzbqzVQxvg", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-04-14", "type": "review"}

Everyone in the waiting room was called before I was and I wasn't even seeing my actual Dr, I was assigned a PA instead.  I did the usual Urine sample, and they took my blood and vitals but the PA kept asking me questions I already answered to the nurse which made me notice she wasn't even looking at my file nor had it with her, she was just taking notes on the Patient info sheet I filled out.  She breezed through a low quality ultrasound and I had to ask her for pics which were blurry and barely even worth printing when I saw them.  She explained that I would be going to a different facility in 2 weeks for the ultrasound and then go back to their office for the check up which I wasn't happy about having to go to multiple places but understood.  When she finished I had to ask her about the results of the UA since I told her I felt like I may have a UTI, she told me everything looked fine but they would have to send it out to get those results (I've never heard of not getting UTI results the same day) and that she would just send a script for an antibiotic to my pharmacy which would be ready when I left there and that they would call in a couple days and tell me the results and I could stop taking them if they were negative.  I waited until the next day to go to the Pharm and no script was sent, I called the OBGYN and explained there was supposed to be a script for an antibiotic and they said they would send it over. the next day the pharm called to tell me my script for prenatal was ready but that was all that was sent. I didn't even ask for prenatals since they're over the counter!!!! called the DR AGAIN and had it sent over, still no call from the Dr regarding my results but I thought I would wait another day.  still a week later and 3 calls asking for my results and I had to call THEM to find out that the results had been in and are negative but the PA must have overlooked needing to call and let me know.  I have requested my file and am switching to Maricopa OBGYN, I'm very disappointed in my first prenatal Dr visit as this should be a happy time and your doctor should make you feel comfortable, I hope Maricopa can turn this around and make it a positive experience for me as it should be.", "business_id": "1acmBPmmFDovVSHHzMrJ9A", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-04-09", "type": "review"}

I had a bike crash on a Friday at lunch hour.  I rode my bike home, to ditch my computer and work files, and to make sure it was safe.  Took a taxi to Good Sam, and it took almost the entire taxi ride for my insurance to verify I was headed to an ER that is \"in Network.\"  Pretty stresful, but once I walked through the doors, most of that changed.\n\nSure, there was a lot of painful waiting around in a hallway in a wheelchair.  But, hey, it's an emergency room.  I found the system to be very organized and the employees to be helpful and compassionate.  There were a couple of fails on the doctor's part.  She offered me pain meds, and then forgot to order them.  I had to ask a nurse, and then they arrived quickly.  Doc also forgot to order antibiotics for my road rash, but I received a voice mail shortly after discharge that hooked me up with germ-fighters.\n \nWhen I was discharged, I indicated I intended to walk to Walgreens, since I live in the neighborhood.  I was referred to the hospital pharmacy, which I expected to soak me.  But it only cost me $14 for 2 kinds of pain meds and stool softener (yes, I said it and no, it hasn't worked yet).  Pharmacy gave me a beeper and I was able to peruse the lovely and overpriced gift shop.  If I was hospitalized, there were many items there that I would appreciate receiving.  Good gift shop.\n\nI was there for approximately 4.5 hours.  I had triage, xrays, and an EKG.  I was admitted immediately, no waiting.  I don't have much experience with ERs, so there you go.\n\nProps to the skinny blond \"tech\" guy, who entertained me by exchanging restaurant reviews while he irrigated my wound.", "business_id": "CAD0tKIttOTTgT7TMJa-lQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-05-28", "type": "review"}

In VERY bad motorcycle accident where I broke my left leg, pelvis and dislocated my toe. Also had very deep road rash.\n\n2. Two instances of painful kidney stones.\n\nFor # 1, I was transported via ambulence to the nearest hospital which meant by default, I HAD to go there as the accident happened on I-10 tunnel. I found the staff to be very gruff (in general) and the surgeon was even worse. Do not recall his last name, but his first name was \"Michael\". He basically told me to \"try harder\" when I would try to get up and stand by my bed. I kept telling him I was dizzy and felt like I had to faint. Turns out, I lost a lot of blood during the accident and was needing a transfusion. After I get 2 bags of blood, I'm good to go again! My point being, these asshole doctors really do need to LISTEN to their patients! I also had a horrid night RN come in and was a little rough and bossy to check my vitals during my week stay. How are you gonna feel if someone pokes your damn arm in the middle of deep rest in the night? No \"excuse me\" or anything! I remedied that be asking the Charge Nurse to never send her my way again.I also had my shoes stolen from my room. Not cool.\n\nAs for #2, I had to wait a LONG time to even be examined. I was literally in so much pain that I couldn't even sit down. For those of you who don't know how kidney stones feel, just imagine a damned cactus being shoved up your urethra. I'm not kidding. I was there pacing back and forth without any help. After pacing around and begging for something to kill the pain, the RN gave me something and had me pee through what looked like a vegetable strainer.

I was referred to Southwest Women's Care by a friend who was very impressed by the Ahwatukee office location and staff. This being my second pregnancy, I was prepared for the lengthy initial paperwork, long office waits, and moody receptionists; however, I was not at all prepared for complete and utter incompetence. I left my initial visit feeling ok with my OB selection, but in all honesty, I wasn't super impressed with the doctors or staff.  I rationalized the lackluster feelings as pregnancy hormones and made follow up appointments.  If my friend raved so much about them then how bad could they be? I went through my new patient information packet and realized the PA who examined me failed to provide me a due date. Wow! Completely unbelievable! Everyone knows it's one of the most important components of the initial visit. I was able to figure it out using a pregnancy calculator but I couldn't believe the miss. \n\nDuring my visit I also set the expectation I would need FMLA paperwork filled out by 5/29/13--I stressed the importance of the forms and deadlines. The person assisting me said that my deadline wouldn't be an issue and assured me she would personally complete the forms if needed. Well, when I called this morning (5/29/13) to see if the forms were completed the receptionist seemed uninterested in my situation and chose to inform me they had \"7- 10 business days to complete any and all medical forms . . .\" to which I responded \"that is not what I was told at my visit and I need those forms as soon as possible.\" She told me she would check into it and call me back. \n \nThe receptionist did provide a prompt follow up call to let me know that they would be making an exception for my forms. She set the expectation that I would be able to pick them up after the office lunch break and left it at that. I was pleased with the quick response and went to pick up my forms as soon as I could. When I got to the office the front desk could not locate my paperwork and the lengthy wait time left little time for me to double check the forms. Imagine my dismay when I got back to my office to discover the forms were filled out completely incorrect.  There were contradictories, wrong information, and misspellings galore.  There is absolutely no way a medical professional could have completed the documents. When I checked the back signature, sure enough, it was different from the rest of hand writing on the forms.  I am completely appalled that a doctor or physicians assistant would sign off on forms without insuring they were filled out appropriately. \n\nThere is no way I would let someone who can't even take the time to make sure basic documents are completed properly deliver my child.  An expectant mother needs someone who pays attention to details. If this is how they handle the little parts of pregnancy then I don't even want to think about how they handle the bigger parts.

The facility is clean. My annual exams usually went fine and I was in and out in a reasonable amount of time. \n\nI had an abnormal pap smear for my first time this year and had to come back in for a colposcopy and cervical biopsy. After a week of anxiously awaiting my results, I got a voicemail from the RNC I saw telling me \"I have your results, please call me back and tell them to track me down personally so I can speak with you.\" I called back and they told me she'd just gone into an exam room and that they'd have her call me right back in 10 minutes. An hour and a half passed and I was really starting to let the nerves get to me.. so I called back. Her assistant said she just went into another exam room and she'd call me back. So I waited. \n\nFour hours pass and no call. Finally, I call back a third time and was able to speak with Ms. Scrivner, the RNC who performed my colposcopy and left the message. What she told me was \"You have high-grade cervical cell changes so you DEFINITELY need to get in here for a LEEP procedure, I'll transfer you to scheduling\" Click. That was it. Scheduling picks up and had no idea what was going on--they even asked ME if I needed to schedule a consult or the actual procedure--excuse me, but isn't it the provider's job to know these things?\n\nAnyway, I got the consult scheduled. I knew absolutely nothing about my condition, all I had was the information of \"high grade cervical cell changes\" and how urgently I needed LEEP. The next day I left a message for the nurse triage explaining my situation and telling them I need more info about my results and to give me a call back. The nurse called back and was horribly rude and condescending. She snapped at me that \"these are precancerous cells that are going to turn into cancer unless you come in here and get the LEEP.\" Out of despair and worry I asked if there were any other options. She snapped back at me again, saying, \"These are cells that will turn into CANCER. You CANNOT sit around and do nothing and NO there is nothing else that can be done because the infected tissue will spread and infect more until you have full-blown cancer.\" That was the extent of information I got about my test results, and simply trying to get more information about my condition so I don't give myself an ulcer worrying about it. Of course I had the words \"these cells will turn into CANCER\" rolling around in my head for days, which was pretty emotionally crippling to be honest. \n\nI was so distraught with the way the triage nurse had spoken to me and how rude, condescending, and cold she was, I started looking into different OBGYNs. I called Southwest to request my records be released so I could bring them to my new doctor. I requested only the past 2 years of records, and they were able print them and give them to me in about fifteen minutes. I decided I wanted all of my records, so I went back in and they told me it'd be $15 and they'd call me when the records were ready for pick up. Fine, I understand. Nine days pass and no call. I call back and they tell me anything before 2009 is in storage and they'd have to physically get it, which \"takes time\". I sure wish someone would have told me that instead of letting me sit around for nine days wondering what's going on.. So I told her it's fine, just give me anything you have on hand. She agreed she'd print everything from 2010 on and call me within 2 days to pick them up. It's now been two weeks, Southwest has never called about my records. The only call I've received is them telling me I owe them more money, despite already being sent an invoice and paying for the colposcopy/biopsy that was performed. I asked why they didn't include all of the charges on the invoice they sent and they didn't have an answer.\n\nWhen the time came that I did have abnormal results, the staff and especially the triage nurse were exceptionally unhelpful and rude--they couldn't even provide me the most basic information about my condition. I took my two years of records to my new doctor, who is an MD by the way (never once saw an MD at Southwest) and she took one look at the biopsy, sat me down, and explained everything that was going on. I don't know why nobody at Southwest could do this for me. feel much more comfortable and confident in my new OBGYN's care. My new OBGYN informed me that I did have other options, I guess Southwest just didn't want to offer them to me. I'm upset I didn't make the switch earlier. Long story short, I think Southwest is more concerned with money and getting people in and out without actually giving a damn about the patients themselves.

I've seen supervisors go after staff members with clinical depression,  known people shunned by friends.  \n\nIf you have a non-average brain,  the first medical or counseling pro you meet may not be the correct one for you. I've been to 7 psychiatric MD's and one or two physicians until insurance,  the docs, and my comfort level settled me in. That's over 23 years in three states and six towns. I've also been in the offices of at least five counselors. \n\nSometimes the meds aren't right. Each of us is unique,  and different meds affect individual brains and bodies differently. At least a dozen have been prescribed for me over the years,  and I usualy feel normal on low doses of one or two prescriptions.  One Dr. joked I was on nearly homeopathic amounts of one prescription.  Dr. Hicks, helping me through my latest crash and burn told me the next lowest dosage was licking the pill. But I'm here, operational, and taking care of my responsibilities.  Life is good. \n\nI've found Northlight an important part of managing my health issues.  Performance hasn't been perfect by 100% of the staff, but that's minor. I appreciate the knowledge and skill of Dr. Hicks and will stay with him as long as he's in practice. \n\nCounseling and psychiatry are two legs on my stool of life. The third leg is faith. There's days when prayer and the words of The Ancients are the final piece keeping my tricycle running down the road of a productive life.", "business_id": "_4VapLIt_vHJ0iL_qnMzeQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-05-17", "type": "review"}

I have no complaints what so ever with that part of my visit. \n\nThe problems began after that. The woman who helped me  (she also picked out my gorgeous eyewear) on the day of my appointment advised that my insurance did not cover the \"professional component\" of my contact lens fitting. I was being charged $125 for that. The eyeglass exam was covered with a $10 copay. This seemed excessive. Really excessive. I asked this woman \"Doesn't my insurance cover both contacts and eyeglasses\"? She stated \"No\". \"One or the other AND that my eyeglass benefit was BETTER than the contact lens benefit\". In this moment, I knew something was wrong. I offered to check the benefit myself, but she insisted \"No, I can do that\". When it was all said and done, I paid half of my balance, which included the charge for $125.\n\nI eventually called my insurance carrier who confirmed that I did have  coverage for BOTH. That's right folks, I have a benefit for eyewear AND contacts. So, when I go to pick up my stuff, I ask to speak to someone about this.\n\nKarina very loudly doubted this, interrupted me and spoke over me, rolled her eyes  and then called my carrier for all to hear. Not at all discrete.  She then returns and confirms what I already knew and says \"Typically, no one has coverage for both....\" I do not know, for the life of me, why she was even arguing with me to begin with.  I am the customer and I was not irate. But I was put off by her behavior and it was written all over my face...which donned a perfect pair of glasses. \n\nThe biggest issue is that I asked the question initially and I was lied to. How could you know which benefit was better if you didn't bother to check.  Clearly, it would have been better to be ethical. Instead she opted to lie and then OVER CHARGE me. \n\nI believe that I got a good exam from the Dr.  I believe that he can charge whatever he wants for his services.

Honestly- I think of Yelp when we want food or fun- it really had not occurred to me that medical PROFESSIONALS would have scores of negative reviews on here.  It sure does now after my experience at TOCA.  As with many of my Yelp reviews- I have blogged my entire experience in full for anyone that is inclined to read more than the 5000 character limit that Yelp provides you can do that here:\nhttps://gerouxcrew.wordpress.com/2015/04/08/run-for-the-hills/\n\nPros: They took my insurance (Health Net PPO), they had an appointment within a few days (while others I called were booking weeks out) , I had two friends that saw a specific doctor at Toca for a similar ailment as mine and both of them had good experiences.\n\nCons: I could not get in with the Doc my friends experienced so settled for Dr Zoltan.  Had to go to Tempe where their office parking situation is a complete nightmare. An appointment is just a suggested time for when you will be seen- but if you are late they will cancel and bill you. (one thing I loathe about medical establishments)- in my case my appointment was later than it was supposed to be because an older gentleman came in without an appointment and they \"squeezed him in before me being taken back *RED FLAG!\n\nOffice staff: When calling to make my appointment they were ok- when I checked in one lady was super nice and when we left the appointment they were on top of wanting to \"help\" but it was far too late at that point.\n\nDoctor Zoltan: rude, rushed, condescending and disengaged.  We brought MRI images with us to my appointment (I had injured my knee a week prior while doing a fun run obstacle course event--Urgent care X-rays were clean but MRI done by Simon Med was showing that I had a completely torn ACL and  2nd degree MCL tear this is why I was seeking out an orthopedic doctor)  Doctor spent about 3 minutes in the exam room with us, manipulated my knee for a few seconds and then left to read the MRI and report.  When he came back he said he did not think my MCL was torn because I was not showing pain the way he felt I should be showing it a week out from the injury.  He then said my ACL is torn but not completely and is likely a tear I had long before this injury and was just unaware of it. (???really?? that is interesting) Doc wants to do \"aggressive therapy\" and check me in a few months but no surgery at this time- I had to pretty much beg him to stop from walking out the door so I could ask 2 quick questions both he replied with \"yup and sure\" as responses as he was walking away- he then did a little point of his finger and wink at my husband and was gone.  Total direct time with Doctor for this orthopedic consultation was less than five minutes.  PT came in and fitted me for a brace (which I had to request-that was one of my 2 questions) so at least I did get SOMETHING out of this appointment.  Nurse informed us Doc wanted to see me again in 4 weeks and I made it abundantly clear that we would not be returning.  Both the nurse and PT were totally not phased by my remarks or by my husband stating that we felt very poorly cared for at this visit and for the most part they just shrugged us off with forced sympathetic smiles and left the room. Total time from when the doctor walked in to the exam room to when we were leaving the building was 23 minutes which included him reviewing my MRI images, and me getting fitted for a brace.\n\nI will be seeking out another opinion (technically a 4th opinion at this point since both the MRI imaging Xray Tech and Urgent Care doctor read my images differently than Dr Zoltan- who didn't even take the time to explain what he did see or did not see in the MRI when he looked at it.\n\nAfter reading the other reviews on here about the lack of thorough patient care and attentiveness- everything I experienced seems to be pretty typical at this office.

She asked what my pain level was and i told her at least an 8! She said she couldn't give me any more demerol, and did I want her to get my husband. I told her no, my little boy is with him and I'm in too much pain. I asked what time it was and she said 10:10. She gave me a Vicodin and left.

I just wanted to have composite redone on one of my front teeth. I should say that the office is lovely, the staff is very gracious and the hygienist is great. I think Dr. Price is perhaps a great dentist but my personal experience was an absolute nightmare - and I'm still living it. . \n\nDuring my initial visit I was told that veneers on my two front teeth would look wonderful. The first flag was the expense - $1585 per veneer.  Keep in mind that this was Christmas time and before my son's wedding. They made it sound so wonderful and easy that I decided to go for it (despite the hefty expense).\n\nKeep in mind that having your teeth shaved is not fun, but the resulting temporaries looked very good. I was happy. The following month is when the veneers were applied - then the nightmare began. The first set of veneers were applied in January of 2013 and were not bad, but I couldn't floss between the teeth and they were a bit long. When this was corrected a portion of one of the teeth fell out so the veneers had to be redone.  \n\nSo I had to again have temporaries applied. Well, they fell out three times while I waiting weeks for the new veneers to come in. One time they fell out on a Saturday so I was toothless and couldn't leave the house until Monday morning.  Another time it was on a Thursday night when I was leaving on a airplane the next day. Luckily, Dr Grant was available to glue it back in. \n\nDuring this time the office double billed my debit card - $900 and it took several days to correct. Then the new veneers came in and they were still too long. And the shape never came out the same as the temporaries and the veneers are opaque unlike natural teeth so now my teeth don't match. Then, during this time, I needed a root canal and a crown and the office billed the full amount to my insurance (and I still don't have the crown) and I had to pay the other doctor for my root canal out of pocket because my insurance had been used up for the year.  \n\nI've always had nice teeth - and have always been known for my smile - and now I don't want to smile. Three other dentists have told me that I will need to have a minimum of 6 new (but probably 10) veneers to make my teeth blend and they all agree the teeth are bulky and opaque. My front teeth also protrude now - almost like I need braces and my front teeth are long and hang over my lowers (which wasn't the case before). By the way, if you met me today they probably don't look that bad but I know the difference and in pictures you can definitely see the difference.\n\nI met with Dr. Price to get my money back for the two veneers (I had also had spent 2k on other work which was done well) and she said that she had told me I would need to have more veneers from the start but that is not the case. I would NEVER have agreed to get the two front veneers done if I knew this - this would cost 10K or more! Now I am looking to going through the pain and expense of getting a full set of veneers PLUS pay to have the two front ones redone. I don't have the money or the time.\n\nIn a lot of ways I really like Dr. Grant - she is a great lady - but this is too much. As for the expense, I don't mind paying more for quality but I certainly didn't get what I paid for and now I will have to pay much more to get it fixed. I hope this doesn't happen to ANYONE else. It was the worst dental experience I've ever had and unfortunately it's not over yet.", "business_id": "PUcQO7PR44O7etkKxOauVw", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-04-25", "type": "review"}

My coworker overheard me attempting to schedule an appointment with another dentist office within our network of health insurance coverage, and could see how frustrated I was getting with the several months waiting list to get in. He told me he had recently gone to Artistic Dental (which happens to be just a couple blocks away from where I work) and he loved it, so I decided to give them a call. They were able to get me in THAT DAY! I was thrilled, since once I had committed to going in and starting routine check ups again I was ready to get it done right away. \n\n I don't think there are many people who absolutely love going to the dentist, but in terms of experience this place is the very best! The inside of the office is so cute and homey, it really makes you feel comfortable the moment you walk in. They have snacks available, the staff is super friendly, and I am amazed at how fast I was gotten in (virtually no waiting either time I went in!), and I loved the dental hygienist who took my x-rays and cleaned my teeth. They did find four surface cavities (big surprise for not having been into the dentist for years haha), and they were able to schedule me for Monday of this week to get them all filled. \n\nI was really nervous about getting the teeth filled since I, admittedly, don't have the highest pain tolerance, but WOW. They have a new state of the art laser that makes the process of getting cavities filled SO much easier than the first (and luckily only) other cavity I had filled years ago. It is quick, easy, and painless. I am so happy with the work that was done and so glad I had Dr. Dougherty and another awesome dental assistant there to talk me through everything.

Dr. Perkins was unprofessional in the manner in which he spoke to me during the surgery prep and during surgery.  I have had this same procedure done October 4, 2013 so I am familiar with the process and the experience.  After Dr. Perkins put the numbing drops in my eyes, the next step was to place a sponge like object on my eye.  Unlike the time before, it was extremely painful causing me to squint and twitch in pain.  I said, \"It burns.  Why does it burn?  I know I should not feel this, I am concerned that I do considering you will be putting a laser on my eye next and I feel pain.\"  He exclaimed, \"Oh my god, you are so dramatic!  I have done 15 of these today and no one has been as dramatic as you!\"  I said, \"I am sorry but this is uncomfortable unlike last time, shouldn't you be just as concerned?\"  He then threw himself back in his chair and said, \"Are you done yet?\"  I could not believe the way that not only a doctor but a person was speaking to me.  He then proceeded and was unusually rough in the manner he completed the rest of the procedure.  Once Dr. Perkins was done, I sat up and was escorted to the post-op room where I was crying and beside myself in the experience and pain with Dr. Perkins.  I explained what had happened to the technician and proceeded to check out.  I not only experienced a tremendous amount of pain in comparison to the first procedure done by him but tremendous pain after.  It is my belief that Dr. Perkins did not allow the numbing drops enough time to take effect before proceeding nor did he have the care and concern for the matter.  I am disgusted by his unprofessionalism and the pain he put me through.  It has been 5 weeks since the procedure and it appears that my vision was affected by his poor quality work as my vision is worse now than it was 5 weeks after my first procedure and prior to this second procedure.  I do not believe this doctor should be practicing on such a delicate sense and lacks any compassion and bedside manner.\n\nIt really is such a shame to have dealt with Dr. Perkins because I have had a great experience leading up to surgery.  Dr. Schiff is the pre and post op doctor that has been such a pleasure to deal with.  He is very warm and informative just like the rest of his administrative staff.  After my experience that night, I received a call from their branch manager wanting to address the issue.  She stated she would send me a gift card as some type of consolation.  Three weeks later, nothing.  I sent her an email to verify the address she had for me and after no response a week later, I called her and she said that she sent it to me after we first spoke.  Yeah, maybe it got lost with her response to my email.  Another week, she receives a return on the mailing and realizes that she had the wrong address.  I get the $20 gift card with a note stating, \"Here is another gift card.\"  I was very offended.  She would have gotten a return on the first one since she sent it to the same wrong address IF she in fact did send it the first time.  I was initially impressed by the way K.D. tried to mitigate but then offended in the result.  This is a $4,000 procedure and I suffered a great deal of pain for a $20 gift card that required my constant follow-up.\n\nPlease note, I do recommend Dr. Schiff to inform and prep you for the surgery and his administrative staff, just please ensure you do not get scheduled for surgery with Dr. Perkins.", "business_id": "4R8uKEIwTVzHGLa3Edub0Q", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-03-14", "type": "review"}

Sure, clinical, because they do the same thing every day. But how about professional? Professional would be nice. It was awful from the get-go.

I THINK I'LL KEEP THE ANESTHESIA. \n\nDo I look like the guy from A Million Little Pieces?\n\nThe doctor himself was very arrogant and Tom Cruise-esque in Cocktail, rolled up sleeves and all. He had the audacity to call my other doctor (Dr. Steen, great guy, very gentle) names because my recovery time was longer. \"Yeah, I'm really good at this, so it'll take ten minutes, tops. And you'll barely have any residual pain.\" Look where I am now, Dr. Day! At the same pain levels as when I was with Dr. Steen. Ass. \n\nDr. Day's little nurse techs strapped me down in the chair and started talking about another tech rather disparagingly, as if I wasn't there. Helloooo, I'm about 6 inches from your face and am not yet sedated. Could you hold off on the shop talk until I'm off in dreamy dream land?

Like they do, two started to rebel and had to go. I finally gave up just dealing with the pain and called around to a few dentists. \n\nI called one place, but from its website and description, it sounded really pricey, plus all the online reviews on it were shit. They were open late and weekends though.\n\nI call this place second. They aren't open late, but very early (7am), and one saturday a month. I called on a Saturday and someone actually answered and took my appointment for that Tuesday.\n\nI arrived early, its a small place with not very much parking, but very easy to find. The inside is pretty small too, but nice. Theres a couch with tv, and not crappy tv that just shows dental commercials. Theres a small area to get coffee, and a mini fridge with drinks right in the main area. Its not decorated or lit up like a normal dentist office either, its all regular comfy furniture and lamps instead of crap office furniture and florescent lighting. \n\nWhen I asked about my appointment there was some confusion, and it seemed like the nice person I spoke to on saturday had not actually made my appointment. They didn't tell me this, but it was easy to figure out since they had none of my info and no idea who I was. They were happy to still accommodate me though, and in a few minutes I was taken into one of the rooms, where a very nice assistant took my ex rays and prelim questions.\n\nI have been to the dentist enough to know that usually the first time you go you get a consultation, and the real work starts on the next visit. When the dentist came in and asked me about my teeth, had a poke around, and confirmed that both wisdom teeth on the right side had to go. I was shocked when he offered to take them out right then! Now, the may not seem exciting to anyone else, but I was in excruciating pain. And I'm not one of those people that needs to be put under to get teeth pulled. I have a high pain tolerance. He also said he could get me out of there and to work in a couple hours. \n\nThe work was what I consider pretty typical, the dentist and assistant were nice, kept me up to date on what was going on while they were working and making sure I was doing ok, numb enough, etc.\n\nI have terrible allergies and ended up getting dry socket from all my sneezing. I called the dentist the next week, and the couple times I've been in to have the dry socket dressing changed (which btw is disgusting, clove flavored crap), they always were able to get me in right away and super nice about it.

When I called to make an appointment, I asked how long it would take, since I was leaving the office. They told me 1-1.5 hours.   It all started off okay, the girl taking my X-rays yakked my ear off, which was a little annoying, but preferred over someone who doesn't say anything.  She had to move me into another room because the equipment was working, and then moved me back to the other room to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came in, looked at my X-rays, looked at my teeth and then explained that I needed a couple fillings replaced.  He was pretty brief, but thorough enough.  Next the hygienist was running behind, so I waited about 15 minutes in the lobby for her.  When she was ready, she took me into yet another room.  At this point I was a little annoyed with the musical chairs, and asked her how long she anticipated the cleaning would take.  She said it would \"depend\"!   Well that doesn't help me get back to work on time.  The cleaning was okay, it was little uncomfortable when she was scraping, but then my whole mouth was very sore for days.  When I went to check out and pick up my estimate for the fillings, I noticed immediately that he pricing was wrong. The office manager proceeded to patronize me and tell me that I was misinformed and the pricing was right.  Finally, since I had already been in the office for over 2 hours, I just asked her to verify the pricing with the insurance.  She said she would call and then call me later that afternoon.  I've still never received a follow-up from her.  I did however receive an estimate from my insurance in the mail yesterday... and sure enough I was right. She was almost $500 off (not in my favor).  I'm guessing that when she found out she was wrong, she decided she was going to let the insurance company notify me.  Unfortunately, the doctor was fine, but when you spend 90% of the time at the dentist with his support staff, you have to rate the office as a whole.

I have been here over the past few years and until today have had decent experiences.  I showed up to my appointment 10 minutes early and was required to fill out paperwork (is there a reason they don't keep a file for me?) but again, I was early so whatever.  I was done in 5 minutes but had to sit and listen to front desk staff discussing personal issues (babysitters' schedule, going to lunch, making fun of a poor lady who called for directions to the office two times, etc) until finally heading to the back around 9:20.  While waiting I couldn't help to notice that the place is dirty - trash on the floor,etc.\nI go to the first round of tests and Megan (I think that was her name) the tech was awesome.  Except when she had me remove my contacts in their bathroom --- to spare you I will just say that it was more of a mess than the waiting room.\nThe dr exam was also pleasant and quick.  My current contacts were discontinued so she recommended a new brand and even gave me a sample set to wear home with my new prescription.\nI went upfront to pay and was expecting my $20 co-pay as in years' past.  They charge me $60.  So of course I asked why and it was explained to me that this year they had given me a contact exam so that's why the additional charge.  What the?!  I've worn/renewed contacts for 4 years and have always gotten my exam from them.  In my opinion nothing has changed but I had no choice but to pay, obviously.  I called my insurance immediately to see if there was something that had changed with the plan and the agent said no and then asked if I order contacts through Nationwide or elsewhere.  I always do my exam at Nationwide where my exam is covered by medical insurance and order contacts/glasses at another place where my actual vision insurance is accepted.  Here's the kicker-- because there was no change, the insurance agent thinks Nationwide is charging more because I mentioned I wouldn't order though them.  Looking back, I'm not sure I was so honest in past years.  This makes me sick because I know I've been \"had\".\nI should've run away from how dirty the place was anyhow because now I keep thinking about whether or not they sanitize anything that touched my face... *shudder*\nOn the up-side, this place is next to Wildflower for a good muffin & good cup of coffee.", "business_id": "AJONCMi8dnGWAkD-86FK5A", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-03-08", "type": "review"}

I had a really really rough start and she never tried to work out what was wrong or help me in any way.

I called 3 times the next day- the first time I was told no message was passed on and to call back, when I called back she was various degrees of busy and would get back to me.

They may be the best pediatricians in the world, but we will never know because they are refusing to see our daughter.\n\nWhat crime did we commit to not be allowed the privilege of being their patient? We had a home birth, with a licensed nurse midwife. We are not insane anti vaxxers or anything like that. Our Licensed Nurse Midwife was in charge of the nurse midwife program for St Joe's for many years and keeps meticulous charts and yet apparently our baby is not appropriate to be seen by this office because she was born at home.\n\nI was half way through making the appointment for our daughter on the phone when the question was asked \"What hospital or birthing center was she born in?\" I responded \"we had a home birth.\" There was a pause and I was put on hold, and a few seconds later I was told \"We are not accepting new patients from home-births\". That was it, no explanation and she hung up.\n\nI am not sure if our dollars spend differently than people who choose to have hospital births, but apparently this office believes so. Without being offered a reasonable explanation I can only assume that this office enjoys a nice financial backslapping arrangement with the hospitals that refer the patient whom they are accepting.", "business_id": "lgyBsM93DBchuwU-_l0Sfg", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-03-02", "type": "review"}

My husband and I arrived there at 7:30 PM last evening. I was being seen to rule out the possibility of a blood clot in my leg or lung. They asked  me to do the usual registration and things of that nature which I completed in about ten minutes.\n\nWe then sat down and waited for an hour before we were called back to triage. The nurse that was there was friendly.My vitals were taken and I rated my pain about a six on a scale of one through ten. Next, she corrected some mistakes on my list of allergies which were entered incorrectly from my last visit. This is where things went downhill.\n\nShe placed us in another waiting room. At first glance, there were only about four people ahead of me. As such, I reclined my wheelchair and started doing various things on my phone. An hour went by an not a single person was called from the waiting room.  We just figured that they had a critical patient and things would start moving shortly. Unfortunately, we thought wrong! Yet another hour passed and not a single patient was called back to a bed.\n\nAt this point, it is now 10:30 PM and two of the patients (one of whom was having chest pain) decided to leave and seek other hospitals. I told my husband that if I was placed in an E.R. room by 11:00 PM, we were leaving as well. The triage nurse heard this an assured us that I would be the next person taken back.\n\nThirty one minutes later, I was taken back to a room. My husband turned on the TV and we waited for the doctor. A half hour later, the doctor comes in and says that by looking at me, she doesn't think I have a blood clot. I explain to her that just seven days ago my cardiologist told me I had a superficial blood clot in my left leg, and that I was advised to go to the ER if my pain increased or I  had any swelling or redness.\n\nI explained to her that my pain was worse, and I needed to make sure the clot had not moved to a deeper vein and become more serious. She hesitantly agreed to do an ultrasound of only my left leg. Keep in mind both legs are usually examined in order to compare. Furthermore, she stated that if it moved to my lung, I would need a CT Scan, and just because the leg ultrasound was benign does not mean it did not move.\n\nThey did my ultrasound at about 12AM. The doctor came back to my room about 1:15 AM and said the ultrasound was negative for a clot of any kind. Rather than moving on and checking my lungs, she said I was discharged. This frustrated me a lot because if for some reason the clot did move to my chest, it could be deadly.  My husband and myself explained this to her, but it fell on deaf ears.\n\nMy discharge instructions were plain and simple, elevate my leg to decrease the swelling and follow up with my doctor.  I will be doing that tomorrow after I get some rest. Did I mention that it took another half hour to get my actual discharge papers?\n\nIn the meantime, I'm praying to Jesus that there is nothing going on in my lungs! All in all, it was a six hour waste of time and my health insurance's money!! With that being said, I would not recommend anyone go to John C. Lincoln- North Mountain for any reason!!!!", "business_id": "Z9ogOCIkHasuKVELa8mQ_w", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-03-01", "type": "review"}

She called for patient transport after removing my IV, not gently either. Normally I have an hour before they kick me out of the room for my ride to get here. I barely even had time to change.

I'm a lil more laid back than the average woman about such matters but, after I met Dr. DeSanto, I really didn't see the need to go to a dozen different doctors and stress.  He's relaxing, knowledgeable and does things himself that other doctors pass off to technicians - like my ultrasound.  He did an excellent job explaining everything he was doing, getting great angles of my lil baby and even showing me the gender before others say they can tell.  It was the most amazing experience to see my lil guy flipping around!!  I'd heard other women say that their ultrasound tech didn't tell them much and actually had them worried by not talking and explaining things but, there was none of these issues with DeSanto.  I'm a fan of his calm demeanor and simple, easy-going approach to things.\n\n* Dr DeSanto is knowledgeable, calming and explains things well.  And Jamie was so helpful with many of my misc. questions and helping me get set-up!\n\n* They have their own lab and ultrasound machine in their clinic so you don't have to run around, wait, or make separate appts for lab work!\n\n* Everyone is friendly enough and it feels like a cozy, comfy environment.  \n\n* There is little waiting time before your appt starts and they must keep gaps in the day because you can get in to see the Dr. in a timely manner.\n\nSee ya there!", "business_id": "nEaJwY77drRqQkJqcd9LRg", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-03-04", "type": "review"}

Initially my experience was positive, as I worked with a doctor named Stephanie Nguyen who seemed caring and attentive, and even once personally called me to give me test results. \nUnfortunately however I am not reviewing her, but the office as a whole. After she left to go on maternity leave, things began to go downhill. \nUnder her care I was prescribed an ultrasound due to uterine pain. I was not notified of her departure, but simply got a phone call from a stranger saying I had hemorrhagic cysts and polyps and that I needed a follow up ultrasound within 10 days of the start of my next cycle.\n\n Following the new doctors instructions exactly, I called the front desk to schedule my ultrasound, explaining to the receptionist on the phone that I needed to schedule an ultrasound within 10 days per the doctors instructions. The woman on the phone scheduled me for an appointment with the doctor very quickly, and considering I knew they did not always have ultrasound techs on staff (they have outside techs come in from an office called Fetal & Women's Center of Arizona) I wanted to make sure we were on the same page. I verified with her multiple times the time and the location of the appointment, that there would be ultrasound equipment and technicians on duty, and explained that due to my narrow window of time (10 days from the start of menstruation) how important it was to get this appointment done right. The woman's tone was dismissive but confident, and I let it go.\n\n Surely enough however, when I showed up for my appointment four days later the nurse on staff said they could not do my ultrasound and  casually closed my chart saying there must have been a misunderstanding because they did not have any ultrasound techs on duty on Thursdays. I was upset and asked to speak to a doctor. In the end I was treated rudely, dismissed, and told to reschedule my own appointment. \n\nUnfortunately, due to their irresponsible staff, I will now have to walk around with hemorrhagic cysts and polyps for another month (until after next menstruation), with no questions answered. Needless to say, I will never be returning to this office.\n\nLong story short - the staff does not listen, the office has multiple locations and outside ultrasound services which they seem incompetent about keeping track off, I was treated poorly and expected to fix their scheduling mistakes, I drove down to an office location despite their not being the resources necessary to perform my procedure and no one resolved this issue, and I will now have to wait until my next menstruation to discover more information about my ovarian cysts and polyps due to their oversight.", "business_id": "nEaJwY77drRqQkJqcd9LRg", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-04-08", "type": "review"}

The front staff was so rude on the phone. The girl I spoke to treated me like I was an inconvenience and how dare I call in to book an appointment. I should have cancelled at this point but I was excited with this being my first pregnancy. \n\nOn the day of my appointment I had to wait over an hour for my appointment to start. Then once I was taken back I had to wait another 30 mins for someone to see me in my room. Tracy came and was the nurse practitioner. She was amazing but I hear she is not longer with them. \n\nNow to the tragic part. I informed them that I would be having my 8 yr old son come in for the ultra sound because we were trying to make him feel like his apart of the process. Dr. Nelson came in. Dr. Nelson has no bedside manner what so ever. He proceeded to tell me right in front of my son that I was going to miscarry. He drop the bomb with little to no bedside manner. He could have asked my son to step out and then tell me. Then he walked out with out explaining anything and basically just dipped out. \n\nObviously I was devastated. I came back two days later to give blood work . Again the front staff was rude and dismissive. The girl told me that they MIGHT call me back the next day and if not give them a call whenever. I don't feel this is satisfactory for someone who is terrified waiting to hear if there baby is not going to make it. \n\nI ended up going with another OBGYN to have my medically induced miscarriage. CWH with out a phone call to follow up with me proceeded to send me a $7000.00 bill for a pregnancy that they deemed was not viable in the first place. You would think it would have been written down somewhere that I was no longer going to need prenatal care after I told them I was going to go somewhere else, my new doctor's office called them, and they DIAGNOSED my miscarriage.\n\nOver all this place is extremely unprofessional and is not a good choice for a first time mom or any mom.

I was fed up with the questionable, indifferent, and invasive and yet incomplete treatment at my old gyn office. My friend told me so many great things about Camelback over the last couple of years, yet I still stuck with my old gyno thinking things would get better and that their methods were probably the same as every other facility's anyway. But three years and five invasive and useless colposcopies later, nothing had changed. \n\nWell, you know how they say that sometimes you don't realize how bad things truly were until you experience the difference? They're right. \n\nI saw Julie Bergdale, NP supreme and all the hype on Yelp about her is true. The most striking thing besides her kind, smart, funny and compassionate demeanor is that she actually listens, truly LISTENS to you and absorbs your info, even the subtle bits. She wanted to know all about my health history, my concerns, and habits. For the first time since I moved here from CA, I felt like I was going to be cared for properly by my gyno office! (I left my truly awesome gyno of 18 years, Dr., Gerardo Bustillo, back in CA and so regretted it. But now, I think I may have some hope of a great experience again.)\n\nI had to wait longer than at my old place, but that's no biggee because it's only due to Julie spending quality time with each patient. And for that, I'm HAPPY to wait! What good is efficiency without quality? For the first time in three years of living in AZ, I got ALL of my many questions answered. Not danced around or dismissed, but answered intelligently and thoroughly. I'm the kind of a patient who knows my body well and takes the time to read books and studies and asks questions, so I need an office that not only doesn't mind but that prefers well-informed patients. Julie decided to do a full metabolic panel, plus CRP, plus cholesterol (amazing) and a hormone panel to boot based on my family history. This should really help establish a nice baseline from where to work. Sensible.\n\nWhy this was never done at my old office, I do not know. The staff and doctor absolutely hated questions, and as she reminded me many a time, placed the weight of their decisions on predetermined, one-size-fits-all protocols. My last phone conversation with my doctor, (a full 3.5 weeks after a mysteriously painful and stressful biopsy episode that threw my period off by two weeks) was very sad indeed. The gist of it? Apparently everything is the patient's fault at her office, even when monsels solutions may be mixed wrong and cause reactions....Very disappointing, yet not surprising. Nothing had changed. That's when I knew I really had to leave.\n\nBut not to worry. They say many times out of adversity comes understanding and positive change. After coming to Camelback, I know now that my last bad experience served as a painful wake-up call to me about my health and being more proactive and engaged moving forward. For the first time in years, I have high hopes of great care for the future. If the NP is this good, I believe this bodes well for the doctors. \n\nOver all, excellent!", "business_id": "nEaJwY77drRqQkJqcd9LRg", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-05-25", "type": "review"}

This is the worst medical practice I have ever been to. I came into the office for the first time at 6 weeks pregnant with a subchorionic hemmorage, at the time Dr. Nelson seemed wonderful, but the longer I had to deal with this office the more I real\u00eezed that I had been wrong. \nI came in at 10  weeks for increased discharge with a bit of blood in it, Dr. Nelson seemed irritated that I had scheduled an appointment. during the exam he removes the dirty speculum and shoves it into my face to point out the lack of blood, really rude behavior  considering his office staff told me to come in. I shrugged this off as just an off day for him.\nA few weeks later when I  was around 13 weeks pregnant  I was sent by the office to Labor and Delivery for an exam because my blood pressure had spiked dangerously high, once I arrived  at the hospital my blood pressure had evened back out. Next thing I know Dr. Nelson shows up at the hospital and begins to berate me for coming in to the hospital (even though his office had sent me). In front of my mother in law he says that pregnancy is uncomfortable and that I shouldn't come into the office or hospital  just because I think something is wrong. I later found out from my nurse that  he never comes to labor and delivery unless   you are in laor, he came down just to scold me.\nAt 28 weeks  I called the office because I had some upper abdominal pain, I was told to go to the er, however due to my previous experience I scheduled an appointment instead, I ended up seeing WHNP Amber Swanson, who actually proceeds to yell and berate me for \"non compliance\", then proceeds to tell me that   I have sugar in my urine   and that I  am a terrible parent because Iwas developing gestational diabetes. \nI have a new Dr. now, and I have since found out that Dr. Nelson did not offer us our early  pregnancy testing and many of the   treatments I needed I did not receive, I finally am seeing a high risk specialist and after the treatment I   received I would recommend that pregnant women find a different office it will save you a lot of stress.", "business_id": "nEaJwY77drRqQkJqcd9LRg", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-03-19", "type": "review"}

About 7 months later I had an experience with them again and realized my initial suspicions about them were correct. \n\nLast year I was diagnosed with cancer in my neck & the surgeon who did my biopsy referred me to this place kind of out of nowhere. I had gone to see him on a Thursday for a follow-up (for what was most likely going to be the last time for awhile) & that Monday I was set to start chemotherapy. He thought it was a good idea to see an ENT thinking maybe they could add something to my diagnosis and/or treatment. I thought it was odd to do this so last minute (If I wasn't able to see the ENT the next day...which I was, I even asked my surgeon if he thought I should delay chemo until after I saw the ENT, but he didn't think that was necessary). He was pretty insistent that I go to THIS ENT office. My dad had just got done seeing an ENT for a throat condition, which he (and I) really liked, but my surgeon said he \"never heard of him\" and REALLY wanted me to go to this office (I looked up info on then ENT my dad saw and he has a very good reputation).\n\nI saw Dr. Bailey the following morning. Honestly, I thought he was a good doctor based on the initial exam I had with him. He was thorough & very personable. Since my appointment was scheduled so quickly he didn't have a whole lot of information going in and said he would consult my surgeon and get back to me. I never heard from his office again, but honestly, I didn't think much of it. I was starting chemo and was focused on that. Unless one of my doctors felt it was absolutely necessary to have an ENT involved with my treatment I was fine with never dealing with this office again (not because of Dr. Bailey, like I said, he seemed good) but I already had enough going on with chemo & eventually radiation. \n\nThat being said, I thought the manner in which I was scheduled to come into this office in the first place (and then never hearing from them again) was kind of tacky & it came across like they were just looking for any reason out there to bring in patients (I also understand that my surgeon also shares some responsibility here).\n\nWell, with chemo & radiation complete I recently had a follow-up with my oncologist and he asked about all the doctors I had seen throughout this whole ordeal. He brought up Dr. Bailey (along with my other doctors), and at first I couldn't even remember who that was since I had only seen him the one time. When I said I only saw him once and that was before I started chemo, my oncologist said since technically I DID see him the one time during this whole process he would fax him my latest report (along with all my other doctors). \n\nYesterday I get a phone call from Entegrity saying my oncologist wanted me to come into their office for a follow-up. I thought this was odd since he never mentioned this to me at my last visit (or called me afterwards to tell me this) so I told them I wanted to contact my oncologist's office before scheduling anything (and find out WHY he would want me to schedule something with an ENT). It turns out that he simply faxed them my report (like he said he was going to do), but never mentioned anything about coming back to them for a follow-up. My oncologist's assistant also seemed confused as to why this office wanted me to come back in after 7 months. If the ENT thought there was a reason to come back in based on my oncologist's report that's one thing, but to say my oncologist asked them to schedule me when he didn't is tacky.\n\nAll this just confirmed my initial thoughts that this office comes across desperate for patients. Like I said, I thought Dr. Bailey was good based on my brief encounter with him (which is why I'm willing to give this place a 2nd star).

After recently moving to the area, I was looking for an optometrist close by. This place had decent Yelp reviews so I went with it. Initial scheduling was a breeze but rescheduling was a nightmare. \n\nAfter I rescheduled (three weeks prior to the actual appointment date), I received three separate calls asking why I was coming in again. I clarified (all three times) that I hadn't been in yet and my upcoming appointment was taking the place of the initial appointment. With each call, I was asked to verify my insurance information. On the second call, I inquired \"why\" as I had already provided this information. \"It wasn't recorded,\" was their response. That happened three. times.\n\nOn the day of the appointment, I arrived fifteen minutes early. The receptionist asked for my insurance info again and I reiterated I had already provided it. She notified me that when she tried to call yesterday, the insurance office was closed because it was on the east coast. I informed her she had three weeks to verify this info and waiting until yesterday, causing inconvenience to me, was unacceptable. \n\nShe proceeded to call the office and loudly state my insurance information for everyone in the lobby to hear. What's up HIPAA? After the phone call she said I was not covered by vision insurance. I demanded she tried again as I've held the same insurance for years and have never had this issue. She repeated the process after asking me irrelevant questions (I do not know much about the specifics of insurance...only that I'm supposed to hand my card to medical professionals so they can gather what they need) and I grew increasingly frustrated. Alas, I was covered and just in time for my appointment.\n\nDr. Sorensen (sp) was fantastic, very informative and ended up prescribing exactly what I needed to see better. I chose my frames and was excited to pick them up (in \"just a few days\" according to a specialist). \n\nI called a week later after not hearing from the office. \"One pair is finished, the other will be done this afternoon. We'll call you.\" No call. The next day I called and inquired, \"One pair of lenses came in, the other has yet to ship. We'll put that pair together today and call you for pickup.\" Meaning I was lied to the day before. And again, no call. I waited two more days. \"One pair hasn't been put together yet, the other pair is still shipping. I'll call you this afternoon for pickup.\" Nothing. \n\nSo I called and confirmed that at least one pair was ready and alerted them I'd be in momentarily. I waited 20 minutes to pick up one pair and the technician asked if I'd like plastic lenses on the other pair. \"I paid for polycarbonate, so I'll wait for those,\" I answered. \n\nThe second pair came in a few days later...from initial appointment to final pickup, this whole process took about three weeks. Painful. Bummed, because they're so close. But I won't be going back.", "business_id": "7hmTTGJHKfAw82uT4kIxvQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-04-01", "type": "review"}

A friend referred me to Dr. Castro and I have been in the office 4 times and have still not seen her. Every time I go in it feels like the staff is herding cattle. I have had to wait more than an hour for three out of four visits. \n\nI found it very awkward how the front desk staff yelled out into the waiting room for people to leave their samples of urine. As a new patient there was no direction as to where I was supposed to go or the process they follow in this office. I asked a girl at the check out desk and she seemed extremely irritated that I didn't know the process. \n\nBy the time I was taken into the exam room they realized they scheduled me for the wrong visit. They decided to just do an annual, which I was not due for, because that is what they put on the schedule and I would have to come back another day for my actual appointment. You can imagine I was frustrated as I had already been waiting an hour an a half. \n\nAfter spending 30 minutes on the table with only a paper bib covering my chest and a paper sheet across my lap, I felt very exposed and emotionally exhausted about the confusion around my appointment needs. \n\nI agreed to the annual visit as it would accomplish something for this appointment. Another nurse came in the room and explained the person I was working was a student who would be doing the exam. After the student finished she explained she would re-do the exam to check for accuracy. It's bad enough having it done once - but twice! I'm just not a fan of having anyone in my business. I was never asked if I was okay with this process or if I was okay with having a student train on me... I still never saw my doctor and still didn't have the appointment I had actually scheduled and confirmed. \n\nThey left in a rush and left a disgusting amount of gel to clean up on me, the table and the floor. It was really gross. I called my husband and told him I would never recommend this practice and would not be using them next year. \n\nI had to go back in order to complete the reason for my first visit which was to change birth control methods. Now that this is done I am looking for a new doctor as we plan to have kids next year and I would like to know and trust the doctor who will help us through that journey.

Both excellent. So, thank you sincerely for those two items.\n\nAs for the care from Dr. Bartell and staff, very lacking. They overbook and generally are not interested in you as a patient unless you are of childbearing age (birth control + babies =$$$). God forbid you have a question, because you are supposed to just come in, be quiet, and then leave. I had the audacity one day to ask for copies of my Pap Smears (as their office manager had told me to do). I was willing to wait, no problem, and did so happily. All of a sudden, a staffer came out, motioned to me to come back with her, and I got taken into an empty office room, sat down, and she proceeded to lecture me in a very acidic tone. She told me that I couldn't just come in the office and ask for my test results because \"it is highly disturbing to the protocol of the office procedures.\" Wow. It was absolutely ridiculous, baffling, and yet infuriating behavior on her part. But that's par for the course at Cornerstone.\n\nBartell also loves to do colposcopies ($900 a pop), even when they would be considered overkill by the AMA guidelines. I had 5 of them in 2.5 years due to a mild cervical dysplasia....never yielding anything more concerning than that. On the last one, she made some mistake and it resulted in a major allergic-type response, swelling and pain, and a period that was two weeks late. She would never own up to what she had done and blamed it on my body. I asked for her help in figuring out what happened and what I could do to feel better, but she and her staff just \"circled the wagons\" as they say and I was left on my own. I actually got more help from an online doctor at \"Just Ask\" than from her. Sad. Thankfully, I recovered, but that was it for me. Even after all this, one of their staffers actually called me to tell me that Bartell wanted to do a LEEP procedure on me because she felt that \"there was more going on than the tests indicated.\" Good God. I knew I had to leave. \n\nOn the advice of a friend, I found a great gyno office and the doctor couldn't believe how many copols had been done. My labs have been perfect since the switch, zero dysplasia, zero anything, right down to thorough HPV typing (which Bartell's staff told me was not available). They also do a complete blood panel, hormone panel, vitamin D test, cholesterol test, and more. Finally, some great care.\n\nAll that physical and mental trauma for nothing. Just think if I had stayed, I would have had unnecessary LEEP surgery for NOTHING. Two of her better staff (there aren't many) approached me on my last visit there and said, \"You know, you can always refuse her tests...\" meaning that even they didn't believe what she was doing for me was right. Very telling. \n\nBottom line: I'd look elsewhere.", "business_id": "9xpYUYI4wbNA4XufvVfKzQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-05-25", "type": "review"}

The last time I went there was in summer of 2012. I have no issues with the Dr. Payne and the Hygienists, but I definitely have an issue with their communication on charges for something as simple as a filling. \n\nIn summer of 2012 I was told that I needed 2 fillings and that I would only have to pay $48 out of pocket, while my Insurance will cover the rest of it. The amount they quoted seemed reasonable (I also double-checked with a Dentist friend of mine who runs her own practice in NY). I get the work done, and a month later the real drill begins!\n\nI started getting letters from their collections department saying I owed them another $218. This is after I had already paid them $48 that they told me I owed when I got the treatment done. I paid that amount the day of my treatment and thought I was done! Magically, a month later, they realized they needed to charge me more! I called my Insurance company and was told that the Dentist is charging more than the normal amounts, and that the Insurance will only cover what's reasonable! \n\nMy issue is that a) Baseline Dental needs to charge competitive rates, charges that Insurance company won't refuse to pay, and b) If they get turned down by the Insurance company, stop harassing the patient who actually paid the amount they were asked to at the time of the treatment! \n\nOf course, I called numerous times in Fall of 2012 to get this charge off, wasted hours as I got transferred from one department to another. Baseline Dental wants to rip off their patients so bad (either thru the Insurance or directly harassing the patient), that last year they filed collection on my account for the $218. Luckily, my credit history is really good, and this hasn't impacted me much. However, I am severely disappointed at the greed a business can have, and how this greed and their practice of over-charging has turned a regular patient away! \n\nNote: I still live within a mile of this business, but refuse to go back there as a result of their unprofessional behavior.

I've never received any benefit from any Chriopractor I've ever seen. I hoped he however would be able to help me on account of his marvelous Yelp reviews, and his sureness he could help.\n\nI stopped seeing him a few months back after I didn't quite notice any improvement from one treatment to the next/any improment over the course of seeing him. \nEven though I didn't see any improvement, I kept coming back with hope that I would soon \"stick\" with my adjustments. \nThe reason I stopped seeing him wasn't even because I didn't see improement but instead because he insulted me to my face. \n\nDuring one session I asked him why I wasn't able to have a specific point on my back pop ever, by anyone. \nHe then told me I tend to lock up when I'm being adjusted, and proceeded to ask me if I was a control freak. As I said \"uhh\", before giving me a chance to even answer, he smiled and said \"you're a control freak\". \n\nThis really left an awful taste in my mouth. Rather than suggesting ways I could relax, or telling me to try something, he flat out called me a control freak, and pinned it as the reason I wasn't able to be fully adjusted. \nI have severe anxiety problems, and well, I was in pain... Naturally wouldn't one subconsciously lock up when a man twice your size is moving bits of your body around and it hurts? I wasn't knowingly doing this, it was entirely involutary. \n\nWhether or not I am a control freak is not what is in question here, it's the fact that rather than giving medical advice or offering help, he insulted me. Neither me or insurance, were paying him for his opinion on my personality type. We were paying him for his medical services, which after months I recieved zero benefit from. \n\nBut wait, there's more. \nI guess my insurance was barely paying him at all, and why's that?\nWhen I asked him whether or not my insurance plan was in network with him, he told me it was. And I trusted him. Why? Because why would anyone question it any further?\n\nToday I got a call from his office today notifying me that I had an outstanding balance. After asking why I was told because he wasn't actually in network for ME and that every plan was different.  \nHmm, well wouldn't that have been nice to know at the start of seeing him? Because honestly, had I known, I would have NEVER seen him in the first place. \nI am a student. I do not have the kind of money to spend on multiple Chiropractic appointments a week, that is unless my insurance company is covering me. \nThis bugs me, but what really bugs me is that fact that this could have been caught after the first appointmentm, if he was billing my appointments as they happened. He could have told me, after one visit, that he wasn't covered under my insurance's co-pay. \n\nInstead, over the course of seeing him, he insulted me, left me feeling no better, and also left me with a couple hundred dollar tab that wouldn't exist if he just checked if he was in network for me BEFORE my first visit. \n\nHe puts a whole new meaning to \"adding insult to injury\".", "business_id": "wNzNiCNab2FqXxcTlXYYEg", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-03-04", "type": "review"}

The first  time we (my 2 kids) tried this dentist/office...I did not get a good feeling at all.  You walk in and it's cold...uninviting.  Probably because instead of greeting you with a \"hello\" and a smile, they can't wait to tell you to go check-in at the computer that's behind you about 10 feet away. First time in the office....no one was there in waiting room or being worked on (strange).  Cleaning okay...dentist was nice.  But again, no other kids besides mine...many empty chairs.  Then when making an appointment 6 months out...they said they didn't have an appointment in the afternoon for two kids together, that the only way I could get 2 appointments together was to take the kids out of school.   \n\n I was going to look for another dentist...but forgot, and our appointment 6 months later was here.  So I thought, let's try it again.  THE SAME THING...no greeting as we walked in but to tell me to check-in at the computer.  Immediately that not-so-warm feeling came back!  As I am checking in...and it's NOT two clicks.  AFTER I confirm that we have Blue Cross and that my husband he is the primary and all the regular information, then it asks me who is bringing the kids in for their appointment.  I type in mom and phone number.  Then is asks me for my birthday, address and SS#!  So I tell them that I do not want to give my personal information that it is not needed for a cleaning that is covered...that we have 2 cleanings a year 100% paid!  She says \"NO, WE HAVE TO HAVE THE INFORMATION or we won't work on your kids.\"   So that was it...and we walked out!  Just lost two more patients and I will NOT recommend.  \n\nRecommendation to the owner: Get rid of your computer check-in (very cold and uninviting) and teach your staff how to interact with customers/patients with a warm and welcoming voice/attitude.  Not to mention you might want to rethink your mandatory policies...especially with Identity theft being more prevalent.", "business_id": "NK3S3U6TQtysH_-eqT3bBQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-05-13", "type": "review"}

One of their staff members even helped me pick out a couple frames I liked that I could save to my file - no sales pressure at all!\n\nWould definitely recommend this place.", "business_id": "MchacUpF1VWbYImddeLsWw", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-04-15", "type": "review"}

I went online to see the reviews and decided to book an appointment.  It was not during office hours so I booked online and got a response back the next day and my appointment was set.  I was able to fill out the patient forms online before my appointment saving a great deal of time.\n\nThe day of my appointment I was greeted promptly and taken back for the preliminary assessment by Armando who explained the machines and what he would be using them for.  He offered me a test that my insurance didn't cover and told me it would be optional if I wanted to utilize it.   I declined and didn't get any push back or any hard sell tactics.  I went to the exam room where Dr. Pratt performed my exam and explained all the findings and results.  \n\nIn the end I did not end up getting new glasses because my prescription had only changed slightly and didn't feel spending the money at that time was the best thing to do.  Again, I wasn't made to feel pressured that I should rather just an option.  They gave me my prescription and a 20% discount should I wish to come in and purchase at a later date.\n\nI will certainly come back and for me it was a good find because it is in my neighborhood and I love supporting my neighbors!

Originally I went due to close proximity and I saw a few commercials.  I seem to recall the first appointment I had was with Dr. Mark Page, who is the lead doctor there.  Since I have been getting checked out by Dr. Yamamoto.  \n\nTheir staff has been unconditionally nice and professional on every visit.  The doctors are friendly and seem to be very adept at what they do.  Their selection of frames have been more than satisfactory as far as I am concerned.  \n\nTheir optical mapping technique is very cool, though I wish it was covered by most insurance.  Since it's not, they charge 29.99 which, if you can afford it, is a very nice alternative to being dilated.  You have the option of dilation, which is included in the exam, but the mapping does not have the temporary though annoying side effects.  (I thought it was creepy but cool seeing what they saw though.)  \n\nI don't know how they compare cost wise to others in the valley, since I have not gone elsewhere, but I intend to stay with them as long as I can as they're the best eye doctors I've had in a while.  I'd totally recommend them to anyone in the valley, especially if  they're in the Tukee area.", "business_id": "eEv4wrcryRbKSCABicwk4Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-05-25", "type": "review"}

The office has the most state-of-the-art diagnostic equipment--it's actually a really interesting process now! I've seen both Drs. Page and Yamamoto and recommend them without reservation.\n\nMy only criticism is that I wish they carried  a wider variety of styles of knock-off/off brand frames (they actually do have many reasonably priced frames--but they're all pretty similar).  I've purchased several pairs at AV over the years that were $400-500 (just for the frames), but I'm on a much tighter budget now. I can get a complete pair of really stylish glasses for under $150 at Warby Parker (online), so I'm finding it increasingly difficult to justify paying such high markups elsewhere.", "business_id": "eEv4wrcryRbKSCABicwk4Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-04-21", "type": "review"}

My parents left with 2 pairs of glasses each and were beyond happy with their overall experience.
