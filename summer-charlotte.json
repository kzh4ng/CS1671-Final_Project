I went there in April after my 1 1/2 year old son and I were in an accident which totaled my car. The other driver's insurance would only pay for a rental for me for 1 week, so between working full time and taking care of my son, that did not leave much time to look for a car. The salesman (Tim) took advantage of my situation and sold me a BAD car. He knew I didn't have much time and was scared from the crash and I was really looking for the safest car possible and he led me to believe I was getting the deal of a lifetime on this Volvo XC90. It only had 80,000 miles on it and he kept bringing up how the car was owned by the Dean of some University and how well he took care of the car. Well the problems started right away, but I unfortunately ignored the first two, thinking that I got the deal of a lifetime...We had written into the contract that my car would come with a full tank of gas, but when I turned it on it was on empty and I had to stop at the very first gas station I saw. Also, when I got home we realized that the passenger side rear door lock did not function at all. Tim had brainwashed me to think that I received such a good deal that I just ignored those two things. However, one week ago my car started making all sorts of noises so I took it into two separate mechanics and the news is terrible!\n1. Two front brakes were completely non existent, to the point that the pads were cutting a hole into the rotors\n2. There is a leak in the power steering rack\n3. Both rear wheel bearings and hubs need to be replaced immediately\n\nWhat bothers me the most is that Tim said one of the reasons I was getting such a great deal is because they replaced the brakes after inspection, so I was getting brand new brakes. This salesman directly lied to my face and put my family in danger just to make a couple of bucks. Both mechanics agreed that I never could have gotten the brakes to this point in 4 months and that this car should never have been allowed to leave the lot. I am contacting Victory Chevrolet today to see how they will remedy this situation and will update my review accordingly.", "business_id": "CHbNr9OA_1o6PtmUlb7dDQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-08-30", "type": "review"}

It's a big deal and for those of us that have written hundreds of reviews, it's a place to talk about a business that has had an impact on our lives  Fairpoint Communications is such a business.  Fairpoint took over Verizon's local phone service in this area recently and this is a review of their ability to deliver.  In a nutshell, it has been a disaster.\n\nFairpoint took over my land line at home and billing was screwed up.  They got the new business when my office moved to Portsmouth.  One day the landlines stopped working and our customers got a message that the number was no longer in service.  When that was fixed, the lines didn't roll over properly.  The billing was never correct.  The internet connection required rebooting the DSL modem up to 15 times a day.  Calls about all of these issues rarely went well.  People were apologetic but problems remained.  Calling about the same problem twice usually resulted in two different answers.  Two different people in my office were reduced to tears.  Most people and companies I know with Fairpoint in New Hampshire and Maine are having similar troubles..\n\nMy company switched carriers recently.  Fairpoint managed to delay the switchover but it ultimately happened.  Someone from the new company was in our office for a few hours and since then, everything has worked perfectly.\n\nTo Fairpoint's management, I can only say that you bit off more than you could chew.  Whoever made this decision was either given bad information or they just didn't care.  I hope you are fined out of existence.\n\nTo New Hampshire's Public Utility Commission, I have to say that I have no idea what you do.  I should review you separately.\n\nI don't generally give out one-star reviews.  This is my 500th review and only my 12th one-star review.

All said \"ok\" and I had wondered if they just didn't know better or didn't want to complain.  One did complain.  She said that she didn't get the hot oil head treatment.  Oh that's sucky - because it is an add on service and costs a little bit.  But she really wanted it.  Well it's not missing it that pissed me off....it's what the lady told her.  She basically told my friend \"well I totally forgot and I don't have time....but what a shame cuz I do a really good treatment\".  Well if that isn't the biggest f-you ever?  She should have taken the time to DO it!\n\nThen we go to pay.  Well....now here is the part that totally had me trumped.  Like I said, I've been to spas on every single corner of this earth, and never before have I seen this done.  They basically add a 20% gratuity.  They PRE add it.  Then they say to you \"well, if you feel you want to give them less, we can change it\".  WOW WOW WOW!  So are you really suppose to feel like an jerk and say they deserve less?  \n\nSo first my friend - she told them to take off the charge for the service she didn't get, then said she did want to tip less since the girl made her feel bad.  They said to her \"well you know the tip get's shared by all of us\".  Oh my Lord.  \n\nMy turn.  I say to her, well I've never heard of this being done before and it's kinda odd to shove the gratuity down our throats.  We all would have paid it anyhow, but it's the fact that we are demanded to without knowing that leaves a bad taste in our mouths.  I paid and didn't fight.\n\nBut then...there was a local man standing in line waiting to pay too.  He said to the girl...\"what can I bitch about to try to get a discount?\".  WOW.  Is this really how these locals act?  He didn't know our situation.  He didn't know how we were treated.  So my friend who lives there turned around and said something to him - basically to mind his own business.  The girl behind the counter LAUGHED.\n\nOh no.  In the car, my friend called several times to speak to a manager.  They kept sending her to voicemail. She left two voicemails.  NO call back.\n\nYou can have the prettiest little southern spot and posh trimmings, but the meat is your treatments and your service.  In my booked you failed on both.", "business_id": "SVI6dJhJCdmp6c-smgQ2dQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-06-17", "type": "review"}

The TV in the room was set up to attach a PC/game system/DVD player. All you need is your device and the cable. Also, the WiFi is free! We were at this hotel for an extended stay (12 days) and I have to say that our room service was exceptional!! We weren't always up early and no matter what time we finally came out they managed to service our room and make everything fresh!! We have stayed other places that would skip our room if we came out late, but not here! The breakfast was great and there was something different most every day! The food service staff was very accommodating and friendly! ( We love the afternoon Otis Spunkmeyer cookies!) We didn't use the pool, but it looked clean and inviting! The patio area was charming and a great place for early morning coffee or late afternoon chats. I read some complaints about the parking, but we didn't find that to be much of a problem for us. We almost always found a spot around the back and used our room key to come in through the dining room area versus the lobby. No problem. AND the parking is free! There are several great restaurant choices within walking distance. During our 12 day stay went to Wolfgang Puck's Pizza Bar, The Palm, PF Changs, and Pinkberry for some frozen yogurt. Also, the movie theater was within walking distance. Also, there is a Whole Foods opening up right next door later in the summer!\nThe hotel was beautiful, well equipped, quiet, and a great value!

I enjoyed staying here though I wished I'd brought ear plugs since I could hear a lot of the street noise outside from our corner room. It was still nice to have our wedding here and then go right upstairs to our room- no driving! We left first thing in the morning for our honeymoon which was a snap since uptown is close to the airport.\n\nWEDDINGS: Also, for anyone considering having a wedding here... Modern Salon is in the Hearst Tower just a block away from the Dunhill. My bridesmaids and myself had our hair done here- they did a nice job and once again- no driving! Oh! AND Flowers Plus who I highly recommend is right down the street (in one of the Wachovia Buildings). They do the Dunhill's flowers and will work with you so the Dunhill's flowers will coordinate well with your wedding flowers. Joel was wonderful to work with.\n\nOUT-OF-TOWNIES: One of the things I appreciated most was the hotel's location. It's within walking distance of everything from the Mint Museum of Arts and Crafts to the Bank of America Stadium. The main library is diagonally across the street. It was really great for guests coming in from out of town who didn't know their way around the city which can sometimes be a bear to navigate for the newcomer. \n\nDINNER: There are many restaurants just outside the doors if you do not wish to eat at Monticello, the hotel's restaurant. But I would recommend staying for at least one meal. It's delicious! \n\nAFTERNOON TEA: As good as the restaurant is, I do not suggest having Afternoon Tea there. Unless they have drastically improved since last year, there's nothing good I can say about it. The service for the tea was subpar, to be kind. The sandwiches were on the stale side. The server didn't know that desserts were included and when we finally did get them they were only so-so. The whole thing left me feeling like I had been an inconvenience to the staff since they had no clue what they were to do for a tea.\n\nBACK TO DINNER: But dinner? That's a different story.

We really loved the amount of detail throughout the house. Original chandeliers, trim and moldings  windows, etc... The McNinch House currently serves double duty as both a premier find dining location and the primary residence of Ellen Davis (the current owner of the McNinch House).\n\nAfter a brief tour we were given our choice of seating... apparently we came on the slowest night of the week and only shared the evening with two other couples. We opted for the table with the most natural lighting hoping it would guarantee some good pics of all of the food... but by the time the food starting coming out it had started getting dark already.\n\nElla and I both started the night with a baby potato filled with a vanilla cream. The potato was tender and mixed nicely with the sweetness of the slightly melted cream. All this dish really needed was a dash of salt. Our first course started out with the Tomato Basil Soup, grilled white cheddar croutons, and extra virgin olive oil. Turns out the grilled white cheddar croutons were tiny grilled cheese sandwich squares and were pretty freaking delicious.\n\nThen we tried the Jumbo-Lump Crab Cakes with a Louisiana-Style Remoulade Sauce and garnished with roasted pepper jam, crispy prosciutto, and braised mustard seeds. The crispy prosciutto was by far the best part of this appetizer and I would have been happy with just a plate full of that, but the crab cakes were good too!\n\nAfter the apps we were served a corn muffin with butter that we thought was a little on the dry side. That was followed by a palate cleansing blackberry lime sorbet in a sugar rimmed glass. The sorbet was divine, but I have a hard time considering it a course.\n\nElla chose the Rosemary and Dijon Crusted Rack of New Zealand Lamb with chevre-arugala cous cous and glazed carrots for her entree. The lamb was cooked perfectly and had an awesome crunch thanks to the dijon and breadcrumb topping. I don't get the chance to eat a lot of cous cous, but after this dish I'm going to make it a point to. The cous cous itself was perfectly soft and tender which went great with the slight bite of the carrots and the creamy goat cheese. This might be one I have to try and recreate at our house.\n\nI got the Coffee-Rubbed Filet of Ribeye topped with a red onion-bacon jam, duchesse potato, whipped lima beans, and a veal demi-glace. I know this will probably shock most of you... but I HATE COFFEE. So my coffee-rubbed filet of ribeye came without the coffee part. The best part of the plate easily the slightly sweet and savory red onion-bacon jam. The worst... for me was the whipped lima beans, but that's probably because I don't like lima beans to begin with. The duchesse potato was pretty good but I would have easily traded its beautiful presentation for a larger quantity and the veal demi-glace paled in comparison to the red onion-bacon jam.\n\nWe started the dessert courses with the Carrot Cake with Cream Cheese Frosting, White Chocolate-Brown Sugar Mousse, Carrot-Olive Oil Puree, and Valencia Orange Gel\u00e9e.  The carrot cake flavor left a little to be desired, but the orange gel\u00e9e was awesome and I give the chef props for creativity. Beth's Pecan Pie with maple bacon ice cream, powdered sugar, and fresh whipped cream was hands down the better of the two desserts. The pie was both sticky and gooey... just as any good pecan pie should be. The maple bacon ice cream was also really good and added a bit of fun to a traditional dessert, but I hated the little rolled cookie.\n\nOverall.. I guess we would say we liked the McNinch House. I don't think they had the best food in Charlotte for our palate but they've been awarded 15th consecutive Four Diamond designation from AAA and are listed as one of the top \"extraordinary\" restaurants in America by Zagat's Dining Guide, which would make me think that obviously a lot of people enjoy the restaurant. We had a great dinner, thought the service was A+, and absolutely loved the history of the house... but I still think comparing just food to food, there might be a couple of other places better in the Queen City.", "business_id": "USdRzNk14UdjZWFgBJb0wA", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-07-05", "type": "review"}

I think it was overall a bit sweet, and perhaps a nice pungent feta topping would have broken that up a bit better.

The historic and charming homes are such a treat in a city where everything seems brand new. \n\nUpon entering this pub-like restaurant/bar we were seated and greeted promptly. \n\nI ordered a cider on tap (a favorite of mine), a side salad, and the \"What it is\" . The star oddly enough was the salad, she said all their dressings were homemade and it certainly tasted that way.  The \"What it is\" was just ok in my opinion. I have had my share of amazing pasta dishes but never have been much of a rotini fan. The dish has a lot of dried herbs and I just prefer fresh...the chicken seemed almost too rubbed in cajun spice for my taste. That being said, I would like to give it another shot and order something else besides pasta ..I really am a tough critic in the Italian department. \n\nMy biggest gripe of the night was the pace of service. I don't know if the server (or chef) had somewhere to be but she was going a mile a minute. I wanted to relax and enjoy my meal not be rushed in and out in less than 45minutes. My dinner came as half of my salad remained uneaten...and the salad was literally brought out in less than a minute after I ordered it.

Told me the recipe was the same but my tastebuds tell me a different story. Boo! That makes me so sad knowing I will never experience that wonderful flavor again. Sure wish someone could tell me what that spice was and I would try to duplicate it at home. And what was that wonderful honey mustard sauce brand?

YES.  Would you have known that by driving around this city? Not likely.  The Levine Museum of the New South is the antidote to an otherwise historically-deprived city.  The gorgeous facility on 6th St is worth a trip from visitors and residents alike. \n\nThey have a permanent exhibit called \"From Cotton Fields to Skyscrapers\" and some substantial moving displays.  The permanent exhibit traces the history of Charlotte from the Civil War to the present-day.  Not a history buff?  No problem.  They have interactive displays, like a sharecropper's shack, a Belk's Dept. Store from the 1940's, and a faux church sanctuary among other stations.  You won't be bored.  This museum has really changed how I view Charlotte.  Even as a native NC who grew up thinking Charlotte was fabled cosmopolitan city, I was surprised to see how recently Charlotte had a small-town culture.  The past two to three decades of growth have left few vestiges of the old South.   \n\nThe Levine Museum has a focus on social history.  Therefore, the exhibits give you a sense of culture, not mere facts and dates.  Unless you visit, you can't really wrap your head around ,the growth in the last part of the 20th and 21st century, understand what \"gentrification\" and development has done to the historical character of the city, and how newcomers have vastly changed the cultural landscape.  You'll understand that Charlotte is really rich in history, but that history hasn't been well-preserved.  Admission is a mere $6.  Some Sundays are free and Bank-of-America cardholders can go for free one weekend a month.

It focuses mainly on the post Civil War history of Charlotte all the way up until present day.  They keep the recent stuff pretty up to date too.  The permanent exhibit and main feature is called \"Cottonfields to Skyscrapers.\"  I've been through it a few times, but they always add on some new stuff to the end of it.  There is definitely some interesting history here.  I never new that Ford made cars over on Statesville Ave for example.  You'll also learn the the reason why downtown is called uptown (hint- locals called it \"uptown\" as far back as the 50s - before it was a trendy term).  You'll also learn why the streets change name every 2 miles.  This is where my current profile picture was taken.\n\nThe second floor features temporary exhibits, and right now they have brought back \"Courage: The Carolinas Story That Changed America.\"  The first lawsuit filed for degregation was filed in Clarendon County, SC.  This and four subsequent cases led up to \"Brown vs Board of Education.\"  \n\nThe museum isn't huge, but it's not tiny either.  I'd say it takes about 2.5 to 3 hours to get through it if you've never been.  Some kids may be bored as it's not too interactive.  If you haven't been here, go.

As a result, I found the information completely interesting and engaging. \n\nFirst, the main collection covers the history of Charlotte and the Southern United States from the reconstruction period following the Civil War to today. The entire exhibit is very interactive and built around various scenes that make the visitors feel like they are actually in each successive era. The historical content featured in this exhibit is informative in a manner that ensures that the info being covered provides individuals with enough information to gain a working perspective of the issues that truly mattered during these eras. In addition to the traditional museum content there are a large amount of audio, video, and additional interactive information that the guests can control that their own leisure. As an outsider, this museum allowed me to gain a more complete picture of life in the South and how the city of Charlotte has transformed itself into an economic and banking hub during the last 130 years. \n\nFor me, this should be a stop for most people visiting and or living in the area since it really provides a unique outlook at the history of the South while providing some basic information in an enjoyable manner that would allow individuals to be more understanding of the world around them.", "business_id": "udbtIhRXiehLRQoMFKvNXg", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-07-17", "type": "review"}

I realize that the bar bite dish consisted of 3 small pieces of filet - but if it is a challenge to cook medium rare on that particular dish they should have said so when I made the request. I have issues with steakhouse not coming close to the temperature I requested, worse when they didn't even bother to pretend they cared. Good thing it was $8.\n\nOverall the food was ok - the filet trio came with 3 different sauces and the blue cheese butter was the clear winner. The crab cake BLT was good as well. It is a good spot for a cheap bite at the bar.", "business_id": "Lt9o2RmacVY2L-IWLA8uTg", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-07-07", "type": "review"}

We waited for about 40 minutes for a table, and when we were finally \"seated\", we had to stand at a high top table because they had run out of chairs. The waiter was obviously busy and when he came over to get our drink order, we went ahead and gave him a standard order of 20 sandwiches for the table. He brought us our drinks and then left us to converse. Then we waited for our food.\n\n20 minutes\n\n40 minutes\n\nAN HOUR.\n\nWe started noticing that other patrons were receiving their food when they had sat down well after us. One of the guys at our table tracked down the manager because... oh yeah... we hadn't seen our server since we sat down. If anything we wanted another round of beers.\n\nThen the manager came over and gave us some less than thrilling news. The waiter NEVER PUT OUR ORDER IN. He simply forgot, and we had to listen to the manager ramble on incessantly about how crowded and busy they were and this should somehow make us understand. \n\nSide note: had the waiter written the order down, he wouldn't have forgotten! This is doubly important when the manager was falling over himself in a hungover stupor, pleading with us to see from their perspective that it's all okay because of how busy they were. \n\nOur food was rushed out and when we called for our checks, we expected the sandwiches to be taken off the bill (I mean it was $20 for 4 grown men) and he only took off 50%. That saved us each a whopping $2.50. Gee thanks grandma!\n\nThen the cherry on top was that the server (or was the manager handling our table now?) didn't come collect our credit cards, so we had to walk the bill up to the bar so we could get out of that godforsaken place.\n\nFinal note: This was the first occasion I have ever left zero tip for service at a restaurant, but it simply was that bad. I will never go back, and we are telling all of our friends about our horrible experience.\n\nHey Morton's! 1) Write down orders so you don't forget. 2) Don't complain to the customers about how busy your restaurant is when you are providing a deal that is going to fill your bar area to capacity! WE DON'T CARE! It's your job to provide the service.\n\nI wish I could leave a no star rating.", "business_id": "Lt9o2RmacVY2L-IWLA8uTg", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-08-14", "type": "review"}

They recognized the members of our group that had been there the previous day.  I ordered the two corn-dog combo; others in my group ordered the hot dog combo and the burger combo.  The fries were piping hot and perfectly seasoned.  Our corn-dogs were the perfect combination of golden batter and awesome dog, and the burger and regular dogs were gone before I could ask the others how they were :)  The ketchup on the table was a little low, but I think we were there just after the lunch rush, so that was understandable.\n\nBy the time I was ready for a refill on my diet coke before heading out, there was a small line at the register.  The cashier waved me to the front of the line when he saw my cup, so I didn't have to wait while others ordered -- I was highly surprised, and very thankful for his consideration.  I wish more restaurants did that.\n\nOne of the earlier reviewers mentioned confusion with picking up baskets right next to the utensil area -- when I visited, there was a young woman running food out (she called the number and waited for the correct person to raise their hands).

So I can't really complain about such trivialities as parking (parking sucks all around here, so while the complaints are valid, I couldn't care less) and the fact that it gets crowded and busy. More on that in a bit. But when you walk into a particular Starbucks and the baristas not only know what you favor every day - in my case, a grande Misto w/non-fat milk - but also have it ready before you reach the wait counter.\n\nThe great news about this location is the recent renovation, which sucked for me considering I was without a workday coffee fix for exactly 10 business days, and when you have to rely on that shitty-assed Keurig-brewed coffee I have to endure at home, or force yourself to walk from Gateway to N. Tryon on a spectacularly and stupidly hot afternoon, which, by the way, I'd rather suck on a wet and frayed towel than have to walk 6 city blocks in 95-degree weather just for a delicious cup of coffee...oh shit, where was I? The renovation, right. The biggest complaint was the lack of space at this location, and when folks were getting their fix between 8-10am and 2-4pm, you know this spot would get crazy crowded, and you really couldn't move around without accidently brushing someone's ass, and then have to wait for some slow poke to finish languidly stirring their mocha choca latta yay extra soy 5-pump coffee, it got pretty frustration. Thankfully, the renovation has not just created a better use of space - there's a nice and cozy sitting spot in the back - but it's even cheerful-looking, in a rustic sort of way. \n\nAnd then there's Sarah, the shift manager, a pint-sized, smart-ass (I love smart-asses) that runs a tight ship but makes everyone feel like they're the most important customer ever.

JWU is out for the summer, all of the suits were probably at Lake Norman tied to a boat and drunk, so there were just a few souls out and about at this end of Uptown.\n\nWe were within walking distance, heading back to the Gateway parking deck after our tour, and I was in need of something to drink ASAP.  I didn't really want coffee with cream in it so I asked the young man for some tea suggestions and he came up with a black tea lemonade.  A minute or so later the barista was hollering out my drink.

I now feel the need to find the closest Starbucks (there are two that I could throw a rock at from my patio) and get MORE of this tea.

I asked the server, why it was not a portabello patty, and the server told me it was because they had run out of portabello patties, and this was what they were using instead. Interesting. I told him I didn't want this, and wanted something else. He obliged, took my plate of sliced mushrooms, and went to place my new order. I called the manager over, to let them know the situation. When I explained my side of the story, he rebutted with something \"Well the server told you we were out of portabello mushroom patties, and said you agreed to sliced mushrooms\". WHAT?! I told him, no, that was incorrect, and that I was unware of them being out of portabello patties until I was brought a plate of sliced mushrooms on a bun; my wife agreed. The manager stood by his server. I firmly told him again, that I did not know/agree to having a sliced mushroom sandwich, and that the server conveyed no such message of running out of portabellow patties. I asked him how he could rectify the situation - free meal or something? No he would not, because I was aware of the situation (but I wasn't!), although he did comp me the original portabello mushroom burger...gee thanks.\n\nNow I'm not the type of guy who tries to find fault at every little thing to get a free meal.

Easy peasy! *I've also heard that they deliver dry cleaning in the Uptown area but haven't used that service myself. *\n\nIn more than three years only two garments have come back less than perfect and Rosa offered to fix them free of charge both times. They are quick, professional and downright sunny every time I walk in. Oh, and she's remembered my name since 2007 and often asks if I've been working out more.

I probably would have given it 4 or 5 stars on the food alone. I ordered the grilled bruschetta chicken. Juicy and flavorful - excellent with the tomato and mozzarella. My friends' dinners looked really good as well- I had a bite of the bacon, chicken mac and cheese and the country fried chicken. Excellent food all around. \n\nThe problem with this place was our waitress in particular. Korin. She started off really sweet and cool.... And then went B*TCH on our table of 6. A bunch of rude comments and all and all unpleasant experience. My friend had ordered the house root beer before and when she took a sip this time, the root beer was flat and watered down. When the waitress was told, she immediately got defensive and said \"it's our house root beer\" so excuse me, it is supposed to be watered down and flat? My friend then said she had the root beer before and it tasted different. The waitress decided to blame the soda machine and check and get her another. \n\nHer second mistake was when she came over to take our orders and said she would start with ladies first, the first lady she was talking about was chatting and the waitress said, \"um, can someone tap her...\"\n\nThe last and final mistake was that she mixed up all of checks or credit cards, I don't know what happened because when our cards were returned to us, we all had been charged the wrong bills! She didn't seem to know what to do, except suggest to run the cards again. But BLAMED US for the mix up and that we put our cards in the wrong bill. No! Rude rude rude!!!!\n\nOn our way out, I guess she had told the manager to cover her own behind. \n\nI would go back for the food and that's about all I was happy with.", "business_id": "ym9QwkmB5ZKTyj7q5huTDw", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-06-28", "type": "review"}

And I loved the Hot Mama....ohhhh that is pizza served with pesto and other wonderful fresh ingredients..so very good!  And...one of these days.... all restaurants will waive the fees to open a bottle of wine....and there will be no corking fee!!!

Personally though I have never eaten here this review goes over the hookah here which is awesome!\n\nYou can't smoke hookah outside so you'll usually be seated outside on the small patio, or upstairs on the 2nd floor. There's tons of flavors to choose from ranging from $10-15 which is a terrific value considering how long it lasts! The scenery around here isn't exactly the greatest even though it is downtown. Last time I was seated on the front patio and watching the cars go past and wondering how some people's eardrums weren't blown out by their bass we got pestered by the local homeless guy for some change. I think his name was Teddy, and he gave us a dance until the manager came outside and chased him off.\n\nI'd probably suggest eating somewhere else and just coming here for the hookah. The menu looks positively bland, but the hookah is top notch, and the waiters are super friendly and even give me water and refill it regularly. I like that, also you should get the honeydew hookah.

Yesterday my car was struck at 3:40 pm, and I was informed by my insurance to give Enterprise a call.  I called the S. Tryon St location and no answer after 20 rings. So I called 9th Street, with a similar outcome, but was put on hold for more than a half hour and called the 800 #. After speaking to a woman she said the Clanton St location had cars.  I said \"OK have them pick me up\", but that location would not (It was too close to closing time).  I wasn't going to walk to that location, this goes against their motto that they will pick you up.  They must have banker hours, because if you actually get through at 5:30 they won't pick you up.  I decided to call the 800 # again and make a reservation for the next day.  I get the confirmation email and I thought everything was set for 11:30 the next day.  11:45 rolls by, so I call and It was the wrong location, as I thought I told the CSR the day before and Old Statesville transfers my \"Reservation\" to Huntersville.  I call Huntersville and they have no cars, I call back Old Statesville and they have no cars. So I call the 800 # again and the CSR tells me my nearest  location is the Airport! I do not live close to the airport at all, and the CSR would not listen to me.  I call the \"Help Desk,\" and they weren't any help, I inferred \"Bend over and bite this stick.\" This Company is the a great example of The Seinfeld episode They Can take reservations, but they can't keep reservations.

You would think something with \"ember\" in its name would emit a bit of warmth in its ambiance. The menu seemed a little limited, and we were starving and I was getting cranky so we actually opted for the bar for appetizers while we decided what to do. I highly recommend the \"10\" sampler, which included small bites of rare ahi, goat cheese quesadilla, buffalo wings, hummus and smoked salmon. Great deal for $14. J got a delicious Kobe burger and we relaxed in the spacious bar, and soaked in the cocktail hour jazz piano. Room service was just okay.

Stayed 2 nights.  The biggest reason for selecting the hotel was the fact it is directly beside the convention center.  And upon arrival, it was clear this was the typical Westin experience.  \n\nThis is a really fine hotel.\n\nUpon arrival, the head bellman was actually better than some bellmen at other Westins I have stayed in, and the staff professionalism continued to the check-in staff.  So that was a little surprise. The Westins near ORD, SFO, and DFW are not quite as polished in my opinion (but still good).\n\nHad a room with a view of the city center.  Which was good, because this hotel sits just on the edge of downtown and just across the interstate in the other direction are strip clubs (so the quality of community drops of pretty quick).  But toward the city it is fairly close to good dining and nightlife.  No need to bother with a car unless you're headed out to get in a round of golf.\n\nParking fee was a bit steep, $25 per day for valet.  I think I recall $18 for self parking.  I actually ended up getting billed for both, but called and they took care of it.\n\nVery nice in hotel dining and bar, as would be expected.  The bar is quite open to the lobby lounge with high ceiling.  And the bar staff are very easy on the eyes.  Additionally, the property is fairly new, so art and architecture feel very modern.

For some, it might seem too 'far' from downtown (3 blocks), but for me it's in great location. Walk to everything, including the Stadium, Convention Center, Downtown, and the Epicenter. \n\nService is great - I would expect it! It's the Westin! From the time you get out of a scorching hot taxi (even with air conditioning on) up until the time you leave at 6 in the morning 3 days later. I haven't experience a single hiccup (except a spider in my bathtub that scared the hell out of me one night). \n\nAmenities are great:\n\nRoom - 4 stars. Last time I was here, I got a room with a great walking shower bathroom. This time, it was the regular small bathroom. Last time, my friend managed to get a room with a treadmill (yes, they exist!), this time they were all sold out. I got stuck on the 6th floor, she got stuck on the fourth floor. This was an upgrade for me, as last time I was on the 4th floor as well. Ok, enough bitching. The rooms are great. Beds are called heavenly for a reason and all the condiments and towels and sheets are so fresh you feel energized be mere being in the room. Air Conditioning is a bit loud so either turn if off for the night or bring ear plugs.\n\nGym - 5 stars. From the variety of the workout options to the gym facilities - everything screams class. Perfectomundo! Individual TV screens for every machine (bike, elliptical, treadmill) help time pass by while working out and watching \"True Blood\" on HBO. Hmmm. Plenty of channels to choose from, though. Sauna, showers, and the locker room are squeaky clean with plenty of extra shampoo, lotion and mouth wash.\n\nPool - 3 stars. Even though this is a great big lap pool, it's too shallow - only 3  1/2 feet deep. I understand that they don't want kids to drown there if unattended, but come on, waist-deep pool is not very appealing to me.\n\nEmber Grill - 4 stars. I have only been here for breakfast - I can't complain, except for the prices. $18 for breakfast is a little steep. However, you can eat all you want from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. and nobody will kick you out (not that I have done that, I swear!).\n\nBusiness Center - 1 star. Ok, what they call a business center is actually a 50 square foot room with 3 workstations, a printer and a fax machine. Internet is pay-per-minute, except to check in on your airline's website and print the boarding pass (which was actually all I needed from the Business Center). However, for travelers who actually need a business center - better bring the laptop and stay in your room with $12.95/day internet service.\n\nAirport Transportation - 5 stars. Checking out at 4 a.m.? Take advantage of the flat rate towncar that will take you directly to the airport. Air-conditioned bliss!\n\nOk, let's summarize: I would give this hotel a solid 4 stars and would definitely stay here again.

This still seems expensive, but it was a popular weekend so we didn't shop around much more.\n\nThe wait for the elevators was ridiculous! I guess that there's not much that can be done about such a thing, but waiting for 10 minutes at a time because every elevator that stops is FULL TO THE BRIM with people was annoying. At once point, my husband took the stairs back to our room WHICH WAS ON THE ELEVENTH FLOOR after visiting the Starbucks in the lobby. Oh, and it's not a full Starbucks so they didn't even have iced coffee...???\n\nThe room was nice- we were on the end of a hallway, which I had heard was good because of the views and tons of windows. There were a ton of windows, but they overlooked construction and highways. Meh. The shower/bathtub situation was pretty awesome, also with tons of windows (there were shades, if you wished to pull them down!). There seemed to be no fan in the bathroom, though, which surprised me. \n\nAlso, there was a burnt out bulb in the bathroom, right near the magnifying mirror; when we called down to the front desk to have it replaced they said it would take them a while...and it did. Also, this is a small thing, but they put lotion in the shower instead of shampoo (next to the conditioner). So I washed my hair with lotion. Yeah.\n\nWe visited the bar on Saturday night between 10 and 11 and it was insane. It took us 40 minutes to get a drink, which we expected, but people behind us were being served first! I guess that's our fault for not being savvy enough to know how to get served in bars? Also, one bartender with red curly hair was making drinks kind of ridiculously- packing more ice in when she ran out of something and choosing things at random to pour in the glasses. We were glad the the person who finally served us (our overpriced cocktails) seemed to be measuring a little more carefully.\n\nA few more details: Parking is $18 and they bill it to your room; pretty standard for a downtown Charlotte hotel, but not exactly a welcome charge on your bill. The pool is inside. Someone on Yelp said that there is a rooftop bar at the Westin, but they must have gotten rid of it because we were told there was no such thing when we asked.\n\nIn conclusion, I think I prefer the Courtyard Marriot a few blocks over, on Tryon.

Westin hotels are also known for their comfortable beds though I personally do not notice much of a difference compared to Marriotts.  The Westin in Downtown Charlotte definitely delivered on Westin's contemporary image and comfortable rooms.\n\nThe rooms are not incredibly modern, but they are contemporary and have a simple and good neutral color scheme.  The design is definitely a notch above a lot of Marriotts that often feature an unappealing color scheme and ugly carpets.  The bed at this Westin was comfortable--excellent linen too and a comfortable room temperature.  The bathroom had a great look and featured a rainfall showerhead.  While I do not have status with Starwood, I did like the nice touch of two complimentary bottles of water with each night (it seems every Starwood member, even non-elite members, enjoy this benefit).\n\nThis Westin also has a great location.  It is right on College, which leads to several Downtown Charlotte restaurants and even some of Charlotte's nightlife like a dance club and a dueling piano bar.  This Westin is also within walking distance to several key Charlotte attractions including a minor league baseball stadium, the Carolina Panthers (NFL) stadium, the Charlotte Bobcats (NBA) arena, and the NASCAR Hall of Fame.\n\nThe fitness center was big and had several machines.\n\nThe lobby was nice too.  It was spacious and there were several sitting areas if you are waiting for someone.\n\nI tried a little bit of their catering for a nightly event in their restaurant as well as in one of their banquet rooms for breakfast.  The food was definitely subpar for a Westin.  A lot of it was due to poor preparation and the effects of having buffet style food as the scrambled eggs were not that fluffy, the waffles were very soft and the flatbread was limp (it had definitely been sitting around for too long).\n\nService throughout the hotel was friendly though I felt that housekeeping was a tad slow to service my room on some days.\n\nPrices are high, but the hotel is nice and the location is very convenient.\n\nFor travelers looking to explore Downtown Charlotte, this Westin is a great option.  The rooms are nice and the location is near perfect.  Downtown Charlotte is not my favorite downtown city.  It is a tad sleepy though not as quiet as Phoenix or as small as San Jose.  However, if you need to be in Downtown Charlotte, this Westin is a good hotel for a short or long stay.\n\nPay valet and self parking are both offered by this Westin.  It is easy finding a spot with self parking.", "business_id": "4nFqPL-glgDm9v7bZptskQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-08-04", "type": "review"}

First off, I was staying here for a conference and had requested a higher floor room, but was given a 4th floor room - which is the lowest floor for rooms. I had also requested a King size bed since my wife was travelling with me, but we were given two double beds. In addition to not being able to sleep with my wife during the stay, I couldn't even fit comfortably on the bed (I'm 6' 4\" so I always get a King bed). But I usually don't make a fuss about these kind of things when I'm at conference because I'm not paying for it anyway. The room itself was just okay - nothing wrong with it, but perhaps the most underwhelming room I've ever had at a supposedly luxury hotel. The only positive is that the bed itself was comfortable - would have been nice to have that King bed though, of course. \n\nMany of the hotel staff seemed rude and inappropriate in situations - including the onsite Hertz staff. Obviously management is not training well for customer service at this location. Plus I had went to the front desk to get my key card \"keyed\" for use in the parking garage because I had rented a car there, but they couldn't even manage to get this right. I never could get the key card to work in the parking garage. \n\nConference rooms were poorly set-up, freezing cold, and loud! The walls were paper thin and it was at times very difficult to hear the presentations because sound from the other presentations next door would drift through - this was especially a problem in the back of the conference rooms. Attendees often were left standing at the back of the room because not enough chairs were set up.\n\nPerhaps for Charlotte this is a nice property, but for those of us who have traveled around a bit, this place falls very far short on the luxury scale. If you are in Charlotte for travel and have an option to choose where to stay, I'd recommend the much nicer looking Hilton down the street - that's a nice looking property and Hilton is always good. \n\nNot recommended.", "business_id": "4nFqPL-glgDm9v7bZptskQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-06-30", "type": "review"}

Since arriving here for the first time for a convention in 08', followed b subsequent conventions and business meetings, the Westin Charlotte has been a welcoming accommodation that continues to leave an impression after each visit.\n\nThe first impression easily was the Heavenly beds. I've never slept in a better bed in a hotel prior to this visit, nor since. This bed set the benchmark so high with me that I purchased a comparable model a couple of years later at a pretty penny. The rooms within the Westin Charlotte are standard Westin: a littler smaller than expected, with the bed dominating a good portion of the space. The standard amenities of the pool area, gym and so forth met expectations. The front desk staff is very, very good, in addition to the banquet staff when it comes to accommodating colleagues that are in for a convention. \n\nThe bar area across the floor from the front desk is one of my favorite places to network with professionals as much as I do drink. Known as \"The Lobby Bar\", the area is set up strictly as one to rendezvous with business associates and friends during events primarily after 5 PM. The menu is moderately reasonable for beer drafts, yet a little pricier for hors d' oeuvres and cocktails. If you can get your company to approve drinks and appetizers under T&E, it is highly advised. \n\nParking is so-so. While the convenience to park within the underground lot is appreciated, I really think that it should be marked better with regard to where the elevator is in relation to the section of where your car is. It took me nearly 20 minutes to find my car at one point!\n\nAltogether, the Westin Charlotte can be a place to really enjoy. A little pricey, yet worth it if you prefer a downtown (they call it uptown in Charlotte) location while either traveling or on business.", "business_id": "4nFqPL-glgDm9v7bZptskQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-07-05", "type": "review"}

The best thing about the room was that the clock-radio thing had a spot for your ipod, so you can listen to your music in the room (and it charges your ipod, too!). \n\nAmenities -- The pool on the roof is a uniform 3 1/2 feet in depth -- yeah, I know, exciting -- and not very big in terms of length and width, either.

I brought in 2 reams of multicolored neon documents that I had already printed and needed to be cut into 6 panels.  I dropped off the documents around noon and was promised the cuts to be completed by 4:30.  I arrived at 4:30 to find that 30% of the panels I needed cut out were ruined.  Completely cut through the printed area because the employee had mistakenly turned the first few sheets around the wrong direction so the rest of the ream was cut beyond correction.\n\nThey offered to reprint and use their own paper and claimed it was the same multi-color neon that I had purchased at office max for $30.  It turned out all of the colors were different and their prints all came out different sizes and were cropped horrible.  When I explained to the manager that the paper color was different from what I had purchased and the cuts were terrible, she blamed my printer for being inconsistent.\n\nGuess what, all of the prints they made and cut were equally, if not worse than the ones I printed.  Bottom line is poor excuses for terrible work.\n\nThe woman who did the original cuts and made the mistake when home in the middle of the debacle and turned over the corrections to a nice young worker who was 'in training' according to his badge.\n\nHe spent the next 2.5 hours while I waited trying to reprint and recut the pages to correct the mistake but unfortunately he was not able to get the size and cuts consistent.  I ended up asking him to just print full pages and I had to buy a paper cutter and manually cut all of them so in addition to wasting about 3 hours in their store, I now had to spend another 50 dollar and spend the evening cutting them manually.\n\nManagement refused to give me the badly cut and ruin documents free of charge and instead charged me 50% of the original price.  Shame on me for even accepting this as the service from the manager was horrible and the quality of product I received was even worse.  \n\nThe ONLY redeeming part of my terrible experience was the gentleman who tried to fix the botched job.  He was patient and really cared to try and fix the pathetic job by the other employee.  He reprinted and recut and reprinted and recut, but unfortunately I just don't think he had the necessary training to really handle the job, which is obviously another reflection on management as he was basically doing most of work alone there this evening.   I hope one day this guy get promoted to management and actually cares about making customers happy.  As for the others...i think its time to find another career that is not in service oriented company.\n\n\nGo here if you don't care about quality products where employees care about delivering the products they offer instead of just giving up and going home.\n\nThanks for nothing!", "business_id": "xSgactTrgrMqN6bO4_NitA", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-07-24", "type": "review"}

I also wish that I could provide them with ZERO STARS.  This company is the worst to deal with.  It started off with my order being processed twice due to an issue with their website.  So I chatted with an analyst to have it resolved.  She then had to call me because she said my credit card was being rejected.  After about 45 minutes she realized she was entering it incorrectly.  Then the day they should have been coming out to install I found out that they changed my street address in their computer when moving from the ordering system to the installation ordering system.  Therefore they installer never made it to my apartment.  When I noticed the change on the emails I received I called immediately (about 15 minutes after my scheduled install window).  The woman on the phone told me that she corrected it and contacted the driver who confirmed the new address and would still be coming.  After waiting another 2 hours with no contact I called back and the new person told me that it isn't possible to just update an address and that she had to put in a whole new order.  Oh and my specific apartment unit was not in there system so they would have to send someone out to survey before the installation so I couldn't set up another installation for almost 2 weeks.  (Mind you they had every other apartment in my building and when I originally placed the order they had no problem finding my address and signing me up)  The analyst also submitted an escalation about my issue so I could speak with a supervisor (after waiting for one for about a half an hour on the phone) within 24 hours.  Waited the whole day and no call back.  So I chatted online again and was told the escalation process takes 2-3 days not 24 hours.  I then said I just wanted to cancel any pending orders that I had in the system, to which I was told I had to call in to do.  Ok so I try to call after being hung up on by their system twice, hung up on once by a person, transferred and being on hold and trying to get through for almost a hour I finally get through to someone (nearly in tears to just end the process at this point) she asks if there is anything she can do to keep my business, I go through everything I have been through and she says \"I have gone ahead and cancelled your order\" nothing else.  So of course I am not surprised when I look at my credit card bill and they have charged me.  So here I go again...try chatting online and they tell me they can send a check, I say I want my credit card charged back, and they tell me I have to call a local office.  But I placed the order online, then I am on hold again.  Their response \"I can submit an escalation and you will hear back from someone in 2-3 days\".  I'm done I throw in the towel trying to deal with them.  I submitted a dispute through my credit card company and hope they can get through to them.  I am now using Clearwire.  Took me 2 minutes to place the order online, it was overnighted to me, 2 minutes to plug in and log on.  Why didn't I go with them first??  I WILL NEVER USE TIMEWARNER CABLE.

I couldn't help but listen as they were standing literally right in front of me and they were by no means hiding their remarks.

She clearly didn't realize we were together and when she noticed the book she grabbed it and exclaimed how much she hates it when people do that. I explained that he was coming back and the he would be purchasing this book to which she shoved a magazine subscription card in his place and explained they can't sell the books after they've been bent like that. Totally understand her point. 100%.

That said, Mert's delivered, not greasy food, but high-quality, delicious, heavy Southern food that will absorb anything left in your system, and leave some cholesterol as a gift with purchase. \n\nI got the Soul Rolls, essentially soulified egg rolls, with black eye peas, collard greens, rice, and a wee bit of diced chicken breast (though I didn't taste much of the chicken. Could have just been my particular rolls, tho). The others got varying dishes of fried chicken and beef ribs, with sides of fries, mac & cheese, collard greens, and the works. \n\n\"You know, if I worked here, they would find me in the back with my head in a bucket of this mac & cheese,\" Ard said.\n\nYep, basically. Some of the best mac & cheese I've ever had in a restaurant. \n\nService is great here, too. Everyone was so patient with the troops of drunk teenagers who wandered in to use the bathroom, despite the sign on the door that read, \"Bathrooms for paying customers only.\" Our server, Netta, made sure that I ordered first, as a fellow Netta.

The corn bread lives up to the hype, it had a nice crusty outside and soft inside, and came with soft butter with just a hint of sweetness.

As for the Southern sampler - the salmon cakes were flavorful, I liked them, though my hubby thought they were too soggy.  Nothing remarkable about the chicken wings or the fried green tomatoes.

It is super moist and crumbly on the inside, and it is served piping hot. There is a touch of crunchy crust on the outside; awesome.\n\nThe macaroni and cheese has some awesome gooey crust mixed in throughout the large scoop. The collards have onions and tomatoes for a fresh taste. The home fries are a bit different than hash browns: soft and heavily seasoned. The yams have a bit too much sauce; they were a bit too sticky, though nice and creamy.\n\nI also tried a sweet potato pancake. It was slightly bland, but I liked the fluffy texture and little bits of crispness along the ring.\n\nMert's is quite the institution in Charlotte, so I am sure that it is split between locals and tourists.

I love soul food, but sadly I have had better in Detroit Michigan.  I would rather go to Sloes BBQ on Michigan Ave.\n\nThe green beans were AWESOME, though as you would expect with soul food, cooked until mushy, though the flavor was just subtle and great.  \n\nWe were also plagued by fruit flys....when ever there was food on the table, there were fruit flies doing fly bys.....I started to hum, \"Highway to the Danger zone\" but no one seemed to get the reference.", "business_id": "mpDxBBGywUE6GRRKja3sBA", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-06-20", "type": "review"}

The manager offered to comp two beers for waiting two hours if we wanted to just  leave. How generous. Otherwise she offered to discount our meals and offered us what we thought was another round of beers. She did not even follow through on that promise. We were given one free beer each. Pathetic. Over 80% of the restaurant was filled with people from our convention. People who make it a point to dine here every time we come. \n\nThe server never apologized.

Our waitress gave us the specials but said them so fast and with such apparent disinterest that neither my wife nor I understood any of what she said.  We ended up ordering one of the specials after seeing them on a chalkboard, only to find out after some more confusing, disinterested interaction with our waitress that they had stopped the special just minutes before (9:30am).  Don't know what that meant; did they run out of spinach?  Strange. We ended up with two other omelettes, the garden and the shrimp creole.  We had to ask three different waitresses for our accompanying toast and biscuit, and once we had our food, our waitress interrupted our prayer to ask if we needed ketchup (understandable, but most servers notice bowed heads, even if it's kinda awkward).  We did need the ketchup, but it didn't come until the end of our meal, and my wife's home fries were already cold.  My regular cup of coffee was mediocre, my shrimp creole omelette had 2 small shrimp inside (super disappointing, as they were tasty), making my $8 omelette mostly egg and tomato sauce, and my wife's toast was hard as a rock.\n\nObviously a rough experience for us this morning, but Mert's gets the second star because my wife loved her omelette (the garden), my biscuit and grits were pretty good, and they let us choose our seating (with a young child, this can be pretty important).

I was in town earlier this month with my Mom and toddler while we visited my youngest brother who was working in nearby Kannapolis.  We were able to sit down right away and outdoors which was great.  However, we were highly disappointed by the food.  And, the experience is still memorable enough for me to write about now.\n\nFirst, they were out of the fried green tomatoes which we wanted to try and we were actually there relatively early to when they opened.  The eggroll-style appetizer that was recommended instead was good but definitely within the same criteria of what we were looking for.  99% of the menu has fried food which my brother was most disappointed about since we chose the restaurant without too much input on his part.  My Mom and I decided to share the Mert's Famous Salmon Cakes.  While the size was decent, the taste was lacking and I felt it might be slightly under-cooked.  For our sides, we chose greens and the red beans both of which were just ok.  And, I will actually say the greens were my favorite food out of what I had if forced to choose.  My brother ordered the Shrimp Creole which just tasted like tomatoes and the shrimp was not popcorn style as described on the menu.  If it had tasted better I think my brother could have been happy that he found something not fried on the menu even though he had decided if he was going to make a diet exception that he was looking forward to it being popcorn shrimp.  After our waitress checked on us she said as a person from New Orleans had we asked her she would have told us that the Shrimp Creole is not on her recommendation list.  However, because other customers have enjoyed it she does not deter people form ordering it...tough position to be in I guess.  My brother also ordered the potato salad which was very heavy on the mustard and vinegar.  I'm accustomed to this style of potato salad but like I said it just had too much mustard for my liking.  My daughter had the chicken tenders from the kids menu which I found to be on the salty side but she seemed to enjoy them.  She also liked the okra and tomato and yams sides that we ordered for her.  The server was nice and she took decent care of us.  She forgot more coffee like my Mom requested but we also noticed that she seemed to have several tables.  \n\nOverall I would say I'm not likely to give it another chance just because it seemed like we were in an area with a lot of choices which might have been a lot better.  I don't know if the chef was having off day or what but I just left very disappointed and felt bad that I was the primary person pushing to try Mert's during our brief trip to Charlotte.", "business_id": "mpDxBBGywUE6GRRKja3sBA", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-08-20", "type": "review"}

It's Thursday night and the wait for takeout was just as long for a table.  The advantage of being on the road and dining for one did mean I got seated much quicker than the people on the wait list.\n\nThis time I ordered the salmon cake with yam and slaw, which Yelpers were highly recommending.\n\nThe sweet yam was like a dessert in itself - and I love candied yam so that was big tick for me.  The slaw was finely chopped and creamy, also lived up to expectation.  The Salmon cake tho - slightly under salted.  Seeing that this is poached salmon with added flavoring after, I think maybe some of the salmon flavor got lost along the way.  Overall still tasty and solid but I would say their other items such as fried chicken and ribs were more to my liking.\n\nService was also  little chaotic - it was packed.  The waitress brought me my food with my cutlery, and then my ice tea never came (I forgot about it too but never saw my waitress coming by and too hungry to wait).

It took about 20 minutes before we even got our drinks. By the time she was ready to take our order, we decided to put our entire order in all at the same time so our entrees came well before our appetizers.

Let me preference that I'm from the South and grew up eating and cooking Soul/Southern food my entire life so I may be a little bias.\n\nAppetizers\nWe ordered the Soul Rolls which were amazing. Black eyed peas, collard greens, chicken and rice egg roll style. They are unique and very tasty.  They also give you complementary cornbread which is pretty good. I think they must use sour cream with the mix because it had a more tangy flavor.  \n\nEntrees\nMy boyfriend ordered Shrimp and Grits. He enjoyed the dish but definitely has had better. The Roux was very bland and the grits were a little overcooked.  I ordered the Fried catfish plate with macaroni & cheese and collard greens. My catfish was good but both my sides lacked flavor. The macaroni & cheese tasted like off brand cheese mixed with heavy butter.  My collard greens was way too salty. I've had better greens from a can of Glory.\n\nOverall - I think a must try is the Soul Rolls for sure. All the other food seems very commercial and lacks flavor.

This is not salmon from a can, instead fresh poached salmon that are extremely tasty! The Mac n Cheese was probably baked before serving, and without question the best I've had at a restaurant! The green beans were cooked, no doubt, in some kind of bacon grease presumably. We also had a combination plate of the bbq beef ribs with a fried chicken breast! I'm not a fan of beef ribs, but these were tender and not overpowered by the bbq sauce! The fried chicken was, well, southern fried chicken at its finest! We also tried the candied yams which were cooked perfectly without being too sweet from the brown sugar.

As far as I'm concerned, it's the only one I would truly ever need! I come from a family of Southerners who are absolute connoisseurs of cornbread. My parents agree that Mert's fresh, hot cornbread slathered with a pat of butter is the best they've ever tasted. (Sorry to my great-grandpa who owned a Southern diner outside Knoxville, TN, whose cornbread recipe has been passed down the generations of my family ever since - it's a close second.) Their Soul Rolls are divine, but with the cornbread and generous portions, an appetizer isn't really needed. I have had the fried chicken (excellent), the beef short ribs (delicious), and the fried catfish (fantastic), but the meal that in my mind has been handed down straight from heaven is the salmon cakes. Mert's Famous Salmon Cakes are served with their homemade remoulade sauce and give you a glimpse into heaven that you will want to savor slowly. My go-to side items are the collard greens, topped with tomato and onion, and the mac and cheese. I went to Mert's after the most recent half-marathon I completed, devoured my delicious meal and polished it off with a giant slice of their sweet potato cake. It sounded too interesting to pass up. And, when else could I have justified all those delicious calories? I have only had one \"hit or miss\" visit to Mert's, where the cornbread was a bit toastier than I prefer, but everything was still fantastic.

Mimosa is one of downtown Charlotte's original \"great\" restaurants, there long before all the big chain steakhouses decided to take up residence. This place is as safe as it gets, and doesn't break the bank doing it. The decor is very fashionable, and presents a really nice atmosphere without feeling too white tablecloth-like.\n\nI really like the \"upscale Southern\" idea, and not many places in the country can pull it off as well or as consistently as Mimosa does. They specialize in local produce and meats, doing a great job of supporting all the great foods natural to NC. Any time one of my favorite dishes in a restaurant is a beefsteak salad you know they focus on all the details, because it takes a LOT more than you would think to make a REALLY good salad.\n\nWhether you're a Charlotte native, or just visiting the city for business, Mimosa should definitely be on your list of places to try if you want a real taste of Charlotte. It may be easy to go with the big chains like Mortons, Capital Grill, and Ruth's Chris, but your money will be much better spent and go a lot further here!", "business_id": "NTfUFk8GyOLL1uPbEO-pVg", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-08-02", "type": "review"}

The atmosphere is beautiful - we ate outside, it was a gorgeous night. They have fountains right out front and large plants out on the terrace to create a nice relaxing feel. The restaurant has soft lighting and stone walls, and you could eat inside or out and it will be just as beautiful. \n\nFor an appetizer we got the mussels, which were in a garlic butter white wine broth - we were scouring the broth for escaped mussels by the end of it because it was so good we devoured it. Of course, even though I say I won't, I dunked the bread in the broth - delish. For the main course I had the horseradish-crusted salmon, which was very good. If you order this be aware that while the salmon is hot, it is served over cold vegetables - cucumbers and green beans. The dish wasn't as great as I thought it would be and I had immediate food-envy when my finacee's dish was placed in front of him - piping hot scallops, shrimp and lobster over grits and brown gravy - WOW!

The star of this party was the mesquite grilled filet, which was cooked to perfection atop a grit cake.  I could tell that my husband was incredibly envious, so I gave him half.

There is a good mix of appetizers, sandwiches, salads and entrees from which to choose.  There are also daily specials.  The only one I can ever remember is the Friday Fish and Chips because it's always the special I want and it's never Friday when I'm there!  \n\nI mostly land on the Caesar salad with grilled shrimp.

Hands down, Mimosa Grill. Bistro La Bon looks like amateur hour and they use to be one  of my favorites.\n\nI was beyond impressed with this incredible brunch. First, the spread was huge...Anson Mills Grits with a lump shrimp and sausage topping to  a juicy herb encrusted pork loin to a delicate homemade banana cupcake with walnuts, pineapple cream and  the most fabulous frosting I've ever tasted (so light and airy). \n\n Second, the food is fresh and hot...it's serve piping on skillets and it is rotated often. The green beans were crisp my friends, the do not cook food to oblivion (hallelujah buffet gods!)  If buffets are not your style (which trust me this one should be), they do offer a  made-to-order breakfast tapas menu that is included in the $20 price (it also includes drinks). \n\nThird, service is super friendly...our server was so on the ball she gave us the same level of attention as if we were at a seated meal. Never was a drink left half-empty or a stack of plates visible...and I did eat stacks haha. Also, be sure to park in Wells Fargo building 2 because they do validate at the restaurant (via token). \n\nMy personal favorites were the prime rib which was honestly so tender and flavorful I could cut it with a butter knife. I also drank the heck out of their Mimosa tea which is essentially an Arnold Palmer with a slight hint of orange (and it is very refreshing). I ate way too much and honestly wasn't hungry till 8pm that night, come hungry and you will not be disappointed! \n\nI will be returning soon!", "business_id": "NTfUFk8GyOLL1uPbEO-pVg", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-08-06", "type": "review"}

First of all, decor is classy, but the carpet near the windows is torn up and stained. A place that gets this much traffic *absolutely* should have the extra dough to spend on replacing the carpet. So, that gets a low mark in my book.\n\nAs for the brunch itself, it was very Charlotte. That is to say, what you'd expect Charlotte to do well, it did great. It failed in other categories. \n\nWhat was good: the grilled salmon was phenomenal. I think they used hickory. Just awesome. Eggs, green beans, mac and cheese were all above par. Another VERY UNUSUAL offering was smoked salmon with caviar garnishes (chopped eggs, red onion, capers). Is this a dish that is unique to Charlotte or the south? (I liked it, although I would have MUCH preferred to eat my caviar garnishes with caviar (including blini and sour cream).) For dessert, there were giant chocolate-dipped strawberries. \n\nAlso unique to this place is the all you can eat made-to-order tapas menu that comes with brunch. The walnut-crusted French toast with mixed berries was sublime. The classic eggs benedict was good, not great.\n\nWhat was bad: they had an appetizer selection of cheese and fruit that was unimaginative, unappealing and un-quality (yes I made that word up to get the point across). Generic cubed hard cheeses and melon and strawberries that were under-ripe and looked like they hadn't been vetted for quality. The shrimp and grits was absolutely awful: a soup of gravy, some overcooked tomatoes and you had to fish around for the damn shrimp. The prime rib was overcooked and dry. The cobbler dessert had mushy apples, as if somebody had just tossed them into a pot and left them out in the sun for three days. The brownies and lemon tarts looked generic and store-bought.\n\nThe service was very good - our server took care of business and was perfectly charming.\n\nSo, this looks like a three star review. Why two? Well, the price was $21. For a dollar more, I could go to the Omni and have a proper brunch with an omelet bar, *real cheese,* fresh fruit, free fresh-squeezed orange juice, farm-raised bacon and sausage, and fresh bread pudding with vanilla creme anglaise.

There were 3 of us dining. \nTo start we  ordered 3 appetizers.\nTomato Salad\nLobster Mac and Cheese\nHush Puppies Stuffed with Seafood\nAll three were very good. There was enough for the three of us to share. \nTomato salad was very fresh with raw peas and a yummy creamy sauce. There was a cored green tomato breaded and fried. Balsamic drizzle. realistically it could have been a bit larger. I mean how expensive are cherry tomatoes!  It was Yummy!\nLobster Mac and cheese was delicious and creamy. It had big chunks of juicy lobster. The cheese sauce was divine. It was served in a cast iron serving dish. Hot! The pasta was orecchiette which can stick together. Maybe they should have tossed it in the sauce a few more time. It was still very good.\nThe stuffed hush puppies had craw fish and shrimp in a tasty sauce.  Very good!\n\nFor entrees there was a Trigger Fish special which quickly disappeared. \nTwo of us had the fillet Mignon. \nI ordered medium rare and my husband ordered medium. Of course they mixed up the plates. There was a size difference in the steaks. He ended up with a very thick big fillet and mine was thinner and smaller in diameter by at least half. Odd to say the least. My smaller piece had a chewy hard section.  My husbands was wonderful and he ate it all. The steaks come with 2 standard sides. A cast iron rectangular dish with cheesy creamy mashed potatoes which they brown on top which for the most delicious crust!  The second side is grilled peppers onions and squash. Yummy\nI tried the signature margarita. $13 my advice skip it. \nThere is free valet parking. Of course please tip your valet. \nOur food server was a little odd.  Not much personality but maybe she was having a rough night it was a little warm to be running around outside. Humid! \nNow it is a little bit of a walk from the valet parking.

On Tuesday, July 15 after visiting Enso's in the Epicenter for a gathering, we decided to try Mimosa Grill for a late dinner. \n\nWe were seated immediately and sat near the windows overlooking the outdoor seating area and a courtyard. It started raining and the ambiance was perfect for an evening dinner.\n\nMy wife ordered crusted salmon with mashed potatoes and greens. I decided to try the lobster mac & cheese and roasted mushrooms. WOW! I'm glad I did. Our meals arrived quickly and the lobster mac & cheese was served piping hot. However, the other items were lukewarm. We informed our waitress and she immediately took our items back to the kitchen. Several minutes later, the food arrived and everything was nice and hot. My wife stated the salmon was excellent and my lobster mac & cheese and roasted mushrooms were to die for.\n\nThough our waitress suggested many dessert options, we were stuffed and decided against dessert.\n\nThe excellent customer service, great food and the late evening ambiance was a perfect way to close an evening.

(twice a year you can try some of Charlotte's best restaurants 3 courses for 30$) Mimosa prides themselves on being a Farm to Table restaurant. So thats why we chose Mimosa. If you like vodka and ginger beer you must try the Moscow Mule. It came served in a nice copper mug. This was sooo good, I could have easily drank 5 more. LOL. My meal started with the lobstah mac n cheese. This was loaded with big pieces of lobster and creamy cheesy mac. I felt like it might be a bit too buttery (yes buttery) as what I had left was huge pool of it in the bottom of my dish when i was done. My friend had a hummus plate and it was probably the best hummus I had ever had. That appetizer was a winner! I also had the Short Rib as my entree. This is very much like an updated version of beef and noodles (which is my go-to comfort food)The Ramen noodles tasted homemade and the broth with the veg was delish. The beef was very tender. For dessert I had the pecan pie. It was a small tart with a dollop on maple tasting icecream. Very refreshing. The only thing negative I would say that some people in my party ordered extra sides or apps and they came out at different times then us ordering just 3 courses. So therefore we had finished our entree and others had'nt even gotten theirs yet. Awkward service. Hence the reason I only gave this 4 stars.  Overall we would go back again as the food was fresh and yummy.", "business_id": "NTfUFk8GyOLL1uPbEO-pVg", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-07-28", "type": "review"}

The newer location in the Hearst Building and on South Blvd try to reach the heights the old one had, but they fall just a bit short in my opinion. For a long time this was my favorite pizza place in Charlotte (along with Wolfman), because they had that true NY style of thin slices with heaps of greasy meat piled on top. I will second the opinion given below that the single slices heated up are definitely not the way to go, if you are going to come here you have to get a fresh pie for the true experience.\n\nThe non-pizza items are also pretty good, especially the wings. If you like hot stuff as much as I do try them Inferno style, just have plenty of water or beer to cool your mouth down! The garlic knots are also dangerously addictive, and if you're not careful you can easily fill up quickly before your pizza is even ready.

Delicious food (the gnocchi was amazing), excellent wait staff, wonderful atmosphere.  If I was a \"playa\", I'd take my date here for the sure win in the restaurant category.\n\nWe were in town for the Charlotte Heroes Comic Con and stopped here for dinner.   When we walked in, I immediately felt under dressed.  Even though every other customer was in fully casual attire (more likely due to the nearby comic event), the restaurant immediately strikes you as an upscale, formal attire venue.  The decorating is simple, yet beautiful, with large white columns, soft romantic lighting and a big brass chandelier over the main dining area.   \n\nEvery single course was interesting, beautiful and delicious.  A bread basket with a variety of bread was brought with a small bowl of oil and cannelloni beans.  The bread as a bit on the hard side on the outside, but still very tasty and just filling enough to curb your appetite.  We ordered the calamari for an appetizer, which comes with fried calamari, topped with shredded and fried zucchini, with two different sauces for dipping.  We were both surprised by the shredded zucchini, but it was delicious and an excellent addition the crispy yet soft calamari.\n\nFor entrees I ordered the gnocchi, and my gf ordered the pesto.  They were both delicious.  The pesto had lots of flavor, with the pasta being soft and tender.  It was great.  Here's the thing though.  The gnocchi was so good, it almost ruined the pesto.   I've had a lot of Italian food, and tried gnocchi a few times.  Each time I've tried gnocchi, it's been prepared al-dente which imo has made it too much on the chewy side.  This gnocchi was soft.  Not mushy, but soft and the texture combined with the large chunks of fresh mozzarella  was wonderful.  The tomato based sauce it was in, was easily some of the best I'd ever had.  The flavor wasn't complex.  It was just the best of the flavors in tomato sauce, amplified.   It was not only the best gnocchi we'd ever had, it was one of the best Italian-style dishes I'd ever eaten.\n\nFor dessert we ordered the Semi-freddo.  It's a small sweet bit of ice cream with some sort of yummy nougat inside, with a few assorted fresh berries on the side.  It was tasty, and the flavors of the ice-cream and fresh berries mixed perfectly.\n\nThe restaurant isn't very large, but that only adds to charm and intimacy of the atmosphere.  The hostess was professional, and personable and sat us at a table out of the way.  Our waiter was polite and friendly (but not too friendly.  You know what I mean.).  It's important to note, that the entire wait staff was sharp, clean and well dressed.  None of that half-assed, \"I'm abiding by the dress code, but I really just rolled out of bed\" look.  I'm ok with that most times, but the wait staff of the night obviously put some effort into looking crisp, and it added to the high class feel of the place.  \n\nIn addition to looking and behaving posh and professional, the wait staff also managed to always be near enough to get you something if you needed it, but rarely so intrusive that they were a bother.  The small size of the restaurant and the number of staff hit the perfect balance of availability and perceived absence.  We never felt annoyed at their presence or lack thereof.\n\nAs for the price, well,  \"If you ain't got no 'monay, take yo broke ass home.\"  (or to another, more fiscally friendly venue, whichever)", "business_id": "z24h6ZYnZiWjlDTuLXG9jw", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-06-06", "type": "review"}

Their 3 course meal menu had a wide variety for the occasion. Upon walking in, it wasn't what I thought it would be. It was smaller than what I imagined, but that was expected after looking at where it was located. Under the Hearst Tower.\n\nNow, I imagine this place to be a local place to go to for office workers after a day at work and want to go to drink at a bar. For me, I think the only reason why I'm here is because its during restaurant week (and I thought the menu looked tasty, and I felt like eating italian.) On another note, the seats weren't extremely comfortable, but it was doable.\n\nFor appetizer, I ordered the fried calamari. It also had fried vegetables, except it was in a string form. My mother ordered the grilled octopus with capers sprinkled on top which I thought it was well cooked and tasty. My brother ordered a salad as an appetizer as well.\n\nFor the entree, I ordered the stuffed pork chop. I felt that even though there was sauce, it still tasted a little dry in my mouth. So to counteract I had to vigorously add sauce to my pork chop. Half way in was when I noticed stuffing because I tasted mushrooms and I was wondering where the hell is this from?! I thought it was a nice surprise. \n\nMy mother ordered the fish of the day which I thought was tasty. What made it was the lemon taste with the fish because of the olives as well as lemons themselves. \n\nMy father ordered off the restaurant week menu and got the Red Snapper. I thought it was very tasty. My brother thought it was very tender, mixed with the tomatoes it went well at the same time it kept with the Italian flavor. I and also my family enjoyed the hint of garlic on the fish.\n\nMy brother ordered the \"Osso Bucco\" which is veal. I thought it was delicious. The flavors of the veal as well as the sauce mixed really well. However, the risotto that came with it was mixed with cheese and we agreed that it wasn't cooked all the way through.\n\nLastly for dessert, I had the tiramisu and my mother had the vanilla custard. I felt as mine was tasty, but if I had to choose the dessert I think I would have gone with the custard. \n\nOverall, Luce did a wonderful job and it's a wonderful placed to eat for those special occasions.

I chose this hotel as part of a package on Travelocity.\n\nLocated uptown right near the Johnson and Wales campus, this hotel fit the bill.\n\nRoughly a mile from the center of Downtown and the Convention Center, the location is far enough to be out of the hustle and bustle but near enough to walk to the Convention Center and Downtown restaurants if you choose to do so.\n\nThe room on the second floor was smallish, but adequate. Safe in room, but other than that, no in room bling. Not a fan of the open shower at all. I like a nice shower with good water pressure. The shower in this room has a seat and a hand held shower head. It's not enclosed and there is no tub. To be fair, the shower head is on a mount that can be adjusted for height and direction, but the result is less than adequate water pressure. Any more and you would flood the bathroom.\n\nStaff is very friendly and helpful. Check in was uneventful and you can check out via the phone in your room. Final bill is shoved under your room door on the morning of your check out.\n\nBar/Restaurant is typical. Overpriced, but you have other choices. Dining options immediately around the hotel are limited. Subway, The Great Wok, Cedar Street Tavern are within short walking distance and are fine if you don't want or need to go downtown for better dining.\n\nThere is a CVS and a Harris Teeter also within short walking distance.\n\nParking is $13 a day in a structure next to the hotel. In room internet is $9.95 for 24 hours. I understand a parking charge, but it seems a bit steep. I simply do not understand any hotel charging for Wi-Fi access in room when it's free in the lobby and other public spaces of the hotel.\n\nMinor quibbles, but If I were attending a multi-day conference at the Convention Center, I'd look for a hotel closer.

Ever.  Definitely more a bar - though the business name here is \"tavern\", they have a sign that says \"deli\".  I'm not sure I'd call them a deli.  Not by a long shot.  They have food, and they even have subs, but a deli?  I don't think so.  You go to a deli, and you expect a fat greasy guy named Tony to slice some meat and slap it on a roll.  Not some coed to take all your money.\n\nNonetheless, we were there hanging out - with the kids, actually - after I gave blood prior to the Zombie Walk.  Decided to get a bite since we picked up a discount due to the blood drive.  There is a tiny little area for dining if you don't want the total bar vibe.  And when I say tiny, I mean tiny.

But it wasn't very good.  They were nice enough and all, but they were definitely not into serving a family of four food - they were wanting to get back to the bar (tavern, sorry) side and generate some better tips.\n\nDespite a proclamation on the menu that they had been rated \"uptown's best burgers\", I wasn't all that impressed.  Maybe I'm burgered out.  It wasn't bad, but like many places they let it cook too long.  Some of the rest of the family enjoyed it, but ultimately we decided that they liked the grease, not the juice (and there is a difference!).  The meat itself was dry - anyone can get greasy burgers.  It's more of a challenge to make it tasty and juicy.\n\nSweet Tea Report: Blech.  Possibly the worst in town.  I have had unsweetened tea at places that was sweeter than this stuff.

My waitress was friendly and attentive. My food came out fast and my beers were poured cold. That visit was good.\n\nIn previous visits we've had some major issues with our waitstaff not having even the most remote clue about craft beer.

My always amazing Yelp Mobile App zeroed me in on these folks.  Thanks Charlotte Yelpers!\n\nSo I walked in the door and scanned the modern d\u00e9cor.  I don't mind modern d\u00e9cor when it matches the food but to me, pizza and beer is a rustic kind of meal.  I know it's a personal preference but I would have liked a different atmosphere.\n\nNext came the beer list and the one word I would use to describe it is decent.  There was something for everybody here but nothing really exotic to excite the true beer aficionado. You can expect almost thirty drafts.   I was mildly annoyed that their list does not include ABVs.  They should add this sooner rather than later as it's become standard at good craft beer joints.\n\nNext I perused the pizza menu and choose the BRONX BOMBER for $10.95. It included spicy Italian sausage, prosciutto, gorgonzola cheese, tomato sauce and fresh oregano.  I ordered it because the carnivore in me was roaring and this is as close as I could get to a meat lovers pie.  They should consider adding one to the menu.  It was out quickly and I have to say I was impressed.  The amount of toppings was appropriate.  It was not greasy and that's a very good thing. For me, one thing that's true of a great pizza is that you can taste both the crust and the toppings.  That was true here and the delicious taste of a little char on the crust came through.  The size of the pie is worth noting.  It will definitely fill up one person but is probably a little small for two. Overall this was a very good pie.\n\nThroughout my meal customer service was just fine.

Don't come here unless you want the staff to lose your stuff and then insist to your face that you're confused and you've already picked it up while yelling that they wouldn't steal your clothes. \n\nI put in my brand new, $270 Club Monaco dress for cleaning last Thursday and flew out Thursday evening to New York. I came back on Monday to collect my clothes and the guy says someone has already picked up my clothes. I give him the receipt stub and he insists that I've already picked them up on Friday. He shows me the log where it says it was picked up on Friday and that must have been me. I patiently explain to him that I flew out of Charlotte on Thursday so there is no way I could have picked it up on Friday. \n\nHe insists that it was me and starts yelling things like \"You're confused okay! Go back and check\" and \"I'm asian, I wouldn't steal your clothes!\" and things like \"Do you think I would steal your dress? Do you think I want to wear your dress?\". I told him of course I don't think you would steal my dress, but I think you might have mixed it up with someone else's laundry, can you take a closer look for me?\" He shows me one other black dress that he has under \"Misa\" and says it's obviously not my name. He tells me he can't help me and literally shoos me out of the shop.\n\nI have never, in all my life, been subject to such disgustingly rude customer service. Do you realize you're an establishment that provides services to other people? Maybe you're too uneducated and stupid to realize that. Alright, can you at least be a decent human being? A functioning member of society? It's human nature to help others out when they see that they're distressed. Alright, let's say you are a barely functioning baboon that really should be locked up somewhere eating your own feces. Can you at least not insult me and yell at me? It's your fucking fault you lost my skirt and yet you are the one that's yelling at me while I am trying to explain the situation? You can't even check with the other Misa customer to see whether you've gotten your clothes mixed up? You lost my fucking dress and you can't even be bothered to do some basic investigation for me? Mere words cannot describe how poorly I think of that disgusting piece of slimed up mucus ball that's been ingested by a sow and excreted out the other side poor excuse of a man. \n\nI take down the number of this \"Misa\" girl from the tag on the dress and I call her and ask her to check her laundry. She says she actually got my dress by mistake now that she's taken a closer look at it and will return it tomorrow. \n\nSo, basically, they gave my dress to some other person WHO DID NOT HAVE MY STUB. I'm pretty sure that's illegal. That is a major lapse of security. Just imagine, if someone with a similar name as you asked for their laundry and got your expensive suit and did NOT give it back to you. \n\nThe next day I go to collect my dress. The guy is not apologetic at all. He's on the phone, hands me the dress and just motions with his hand that I should leave. WOW. All other dry cleaning companies would have been ashamed of themselves and have given the customers a coupon for a free launder or something to make up for the hassle. Not this guy. Not this sniveling pile of maggot meat here. I ask him, \"So you said I'm confused? I told you you mixed up the laundry.\" He says, \"Oh the name is similar.\" Similar MY ASS. The other girl's name is MISA my name is RENA. How the fuck is that similar. \n\nI understand that mix ups happen. People make mistakes, it's life. But not helping your customers when your mistake has cost them dearly? Insulting your customers? Not owning up to your mistakes? Not even trying to compensate for the time/ energy/ money lost? This really is a first. \n\nIt was really good luck that I was able to find my $270 dress from Club Monaco since the store clerk was less than useless. I will never be doing business with them again and I highly encourage anyone and everyone else to do the same. I work just above the dry cleaner's building so it's really convenient for me to dry clean there but it really just isn't worth the monetary loss and hassle. I was so upset all afternoon because I really liked that dress and I had just bought it a month ago for a whopping $270! Which I would have lost if I had not called Misa and resolved the problem by myself - they sure weren't any help!\n\nSUMMARY: (for TLDRs)\n1. They gave my laundry to someone else even though the other person did not have my ticket stub. \n2. When i asked them about it they insulted me to my face and refused to help me. \n3. I tracked down the girl who they mixed up my dry cleaning with and got my clothes back. \n4. I would have lost $270 dress if I hadn't called the girl myself\n5. When I confronted the guy the next day he wasn't apologetic at all and did not offer ANY FORM of compensation\n\n= NEVER EVER DO BUSINESS WITH THIS HORRIBLE ESTABLISHMENT!", "business_id": "QBS7wyalMkUmPFhIBm4MPg", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-07-28", "type": "review"}

We stayed here because of the location across the street from the Nascar Hall of Fame and it's proximity to the downtown area.  We were also right across from the Speed Street street fair, very nice.  The close proximity to the highways worked out well as we made it a point to visit South Carolina as well as other areas of North Carolina.

Overall the staff was very tentative to any need or concern. Mathew who seemed to be an all-round staff member assisted me several times and went way and beyond on. On one occasion he took quite a bit of time to explain and tour the best route and shortcuts to get from my car to hotel elevators and what garage floors to park on. Way to go Mathew.  The front desk was always helpful. We had an issue with room noise one night at 10 PM and it was handled in the best possible way with no hesitation either Lynn or Carolyn (not sure who was on duty that night) fully addressed this concern  to our 100% satisfaction the next day. The shuttle is really great the driver saw us in the lobby looking around and asking directions to local restaurants and  JB stepped right in with a very enthusiastic attitude and offered to take us wherever we needed. That impressed me because usually the guys working a shuttle would rather avoid having to take anyone any where. JB even gave us his card and instructed us to call him when we where ready to be picked up. The breakfast is offered in the lobby and is not free but worth the price. I would advise to get a package so its included with the cost of your room rate with parking. It works out to be less that way. At the breakfast buffet the cooks will prepare you several items all of them are really nice an attentive. Nelly, Lupe and Laura where great and Lupe is a gem, thank you for having a box with breakfast to go for my wife every morning.  This hotel offers room service from 5-10 PM and the selection was good as well as the food. My wife had the pork almost every night , it was that good. Overall this hotel is very clean and centrally located to down town. The parking is good and the views as well, but the great staff was the best feature by far.

It looked like there were enough \"suits\" in the place to write a check to clear the federal deficit, but I liked that. The decor had an old world feel blended with a wall street vigor. The hostess was gracious and we were seated immediately and noticed the restaurant was quite busy for a Wednesday night. \n\nAlissa explained the chef features for the night and we agreed to try it. We received complimentary champagne and I ordered the smoked salmon as an appetizer. It was a good portion and was served with aioli, capers, chopped onions, and crisp pita triangles. I enjoyed it immensely as smoked salmon is one of my favorites. The hubs ordered a salad, and we ordered the lobster mac-n-cheese and truffle fries for our son, the Gabe-meister (I kept theifing the lobster out of the mac-n-cheese it was soooo good) and the truffle fries were amazing, it had this parmasen flavor to it. I do not eat red meat regularly but wanted to try the feature 4 oz filet medallion at medium with a fennel based sauce. The hubs opted for the 12 oz. filet mignon at medium rare with crab (out of the shell) in butter sauce. Needless to say we enjoyed the meal and left completely satisfied and impressed with Capital Grille. The food was great but it was the service that really impressed, two managers came by and wished me a happy birthday and checked on us to see if everything was ok.

I definitely could have skipped the spinach salad, just because I already had so much food and we were staying in a hotel without a mini fridge.

Your dining room is very nice and your staff so very polite and accommodating as saints.\n\nI'll echo what Adam R. said and say that steakhouses are not usually my dining preference when choosing a place to eat at but I had really enjoyed the good eats at the Capital Grille Generous Pour event recently I decided to give it a shot. Warmly greeted at the door and reservations confirmed even though we had arrived a bit earlier than expected, their hospitality is as good as ever. The problem is I didn't exactly enjoy my meal as much as I would have hoped even though I still had a good time surrounded by friends and family.\n\nAppetizers came out in a very timely manner once menu choices were made. I chose clam chowder based on a recommendation. Well it wasn't amazing but it wasn't bad either, a well made clam chowder is one of my favorite things to eat so this was a bit of a let down. My entree a Kona crusted dry aged sirloin was perfectly cooked and served with a nice composite shallot butter how old school! The only problem is that they didn't cook all the steaks as well as mine. One person had ordered a medium steak and it came out well done and extremely charred (It was comped when she mentioned it and the waiter and manager were very sorry and concerned about this so I'll have to thumbs up them for handling a situation so graciously). The shallot butter though didn't really add anything to the dish for me and the steak wasn't so flavorful that it could stand on it's own. The best part of the meal? Dessert! But not my dessert, I was talked up on the ice cream and decided to order it instead of creme brulee. Well that was a major mistake on my part. My whole meal had been heavy and if I had went with sorbet I might have been able to finish it, but I decided on ice cream. Peanut butter, chocolate, and vanilla ice cream was just too much to handle for me and I called it quits after a spoonful of each. The creme brulee was still as addictive as ever from what I tried on someone's plate though!\n\nI would go back here just for the service alone. It's really nice to be treated like they really care about your visit.

Now that I am in Charlotte, I was able to try out another Capital Grille location and enjoyed a lovely lunch with my mom in uptown Charlotte. This outpost of The Capital Grille was bustling before noon on a Monday. Many business meetings and lunches are held here and the obviously enthusiastic staff kept things running smoothly and truly went above and beyond even with a close to full a house. At lunch parking is validated for the lot behind the Dunhill Hotel, making it a reasonable $2.\n\nThe Plates menu features choice of a soup or salad, an entree and a side dish for a set price of $18 at the Charlotte location. For the summer menu, a new entree of seared scallops with sweet and sour tomatoes is available. I love how the scallops are served with a grilled lemon wedge for a citrus taste that goes perfectly with the beautifully presented and cooked shellfish - delicious. The other new additions to the menu include a carrot ginger soup (hot) which I also really liked (the tasty classic New England clam chowder is still available as well) and a tomato and watermelon salad with feta cheese - a refreshing option for a side dish. The Wagyu beef burger with fried egg and crispy onions is back on the menu following multiple requests after it was featured last summer and then removed. My mom ordered this and LOVED it - and she is not usually a fan of burgers at all. The truffle fries go great with the burger, which is really a treat.", "business_id": "CChwRoYVXA3QZulS8a6xOQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-07-30", "type": "review"}

Reposting here...\n\nEvery once in a while, you have an experience at a restaurant that's so lovely, you know you'll remember it for years. The meal we ate at the Capital Grille this week doubtlessly falls into this category.\n\nI know that Capital Grille is a chain, and an expensive chain as well. I'm not usually super excited about corporate steakhouses (Ruth's Chris: meh), and I usually wouldn't have chosen one for a Restaurant Week outing. However, Capital Grille treated us so well during the Yelp Generous Pour event, we decided to return. I'm glad we did: the food and the service were both amazing.\n\nI'll talk about the food first. Their Restaurant Week menu is not very varied: they offer three steak entrees and one salmon dish. However, I don't see that as a downside, since if you're looking for something lighter and/or vegetarian, you're not going to go to a steakhouse, anyways. For my entree, I ordered the Kona-encrusted sirloin with shallot butter.. oh my. This was a good steak, folks: tremendous flavor and perfectly cooked. I've learned that this steak is on their regular menu as well. This could be bad for my credit card. The appetizer of clam chowder was good, if not exceptional. My dessert of creme brulee was delicious. Nevertheless, it was all overshadowed by that steak.\n\nOk, now let's talk about the service. Yes, my steak was amazing, but you can get an amazing steak at other venues. What really set this night apart was the level of service we received. Even though it was Restaurant week, and even though we had nibbled and sipped for free the weekend before, we were treated as well as they could have treated any bank executive or local politician. Our waiter, James, was unobtrusively attentive and poured us multiple glasses of wine on the house. The manager checked in on us and shook our hands on the way out. I've never been treated better in a restaurant, especially when eating a meal at such a considerable discount.\n\nIn case you can't tell from the above, we really had a fantastic evening. I suspect that we'll be back the next time we have an excuse to splurge.", "business_id": "CChwRoYVXA3QZulS8a6xOQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-08-01", "type": "review"}

It's rare I feel like I've been \"wowed\" when I go out, but The Captial Grille had that effect and they did so in a way that seemed effortless and second-nature.\n\nWe were lured in after the recent Elite event (and actually made our dinner reservations within an hour of the event). The ambiance is exquisite without being extravagant, with many formal-looking portraits, iron, and a wealth of masculine darkly-stained wood.\n\nThe kitchen was spot-on during our visit - not a single thing came to the table that wasn't outstanding. We both started with the bacon clam chowder - smokey and rich. My entree was the filet Mignon, a timeless classic (and a personal favorite). I ordered mine medium rare: my first experience in Charlotte where my steak was brought to me a true medium rare. It's a tender cut that the chefs worked wonders with. A had the dry-aged Kona crusted sirloin - his was equally amazing with explosive flavors. Dessert brought chocolate espresso flour-less cake. Exceptionally rich and decadent - the perfect end to the meal.\n\nAs an experienced oenophile, I am in heaven at The Capital Grille. The wine selection has no comparison in the area - many, many phenomenal producers represented from around the globe, a survey of the best-of-the-best in wine. We mentioned we had attended for the summer Generous Pour event earlier and paid for it again tonight. This time, though, the server turned it into a guessing game: we'd order one, he'd bring two, seeing if we could identify the mystery wine from the list he recommended with our food. \n\nSpeaking of the service, TCG is in a league of their own in the area. The staff, who had or reservation, greeted us by name at the door and at our table. The manager recognized us from the week before and made it a point to stop by and welcome us and to wish us well at the end of the evening. Down to the very smallest detail of folding your napkin if you need to leave the table during your meal, this team embodies every stellar trait of the service industry.\n\nWhile The Captial Grille is not in the budget for a regular meal (yet), they are now my first choice for a venue to celebrate and to show off everything Charlotte has to offer.", "business_id": "CChwRoYVXA3QZulS8a6xOQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-08-08", "type": "review"}

I thought is would be a very nice meal and someplace I had not taken them before.  Eating in the best restaurants in town and when we travel is not unusual.  The food was very hit-and-miss and so was the service.  \n\nLet's start with the food.  We ordered two appetizers for the table that were not part of restaurant week.  The Calamari and the Mozzarella wrapped cheese.  The calamari was excellent and cooked perfectly.  The Mozzarella was good but not the tastiest or smoothest mozzarella I have eaten.  Both were worthy.  For the first course, my oldest son had the clam chowder which he enjoyed.  The rest of us ordered the mixed field greens salad which was awful.  I have had a better side salad at Wendy's.  It was totally tasteless and un-inspired.  None of us even finished half the portion.  When the waiters helper asked if we were done, we told him to please take them away and how horrible they were.  The three men had the filet for our main course.  It was a very middle of the road filet.  I am not sure if they lowered their quality for restaurant week but it tasted no better than an Outback Steak.  Even my 15 year old recognized the poor quality of meat.  My wife had the Salmon which was better than the filet but nothing exciting.  She only ate half the portion and it was not worth packing up to take home.  The mashed potato side was amazing and the creamed spinach side was average.  The creme brulee and flourless chocolate cake for desert were both amazing.  I would recommend just hitting the bar for these late night after a show.  \n\nThe service was also only marginal.  A big let down compared to the service received at lunch.  The waiter reached across the table versus walking around, and he plated the food close but not just right so you had to re-arrange the positioning of every dish before eating it.  The atmosphere is beautiful.  I would return for a business lunch but don't waste your time or money on dinner or taking someone you want to impress.", "business_id": "CChwRoYVXA3QZulS8a6xOQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-07-29", "type": "review"}

Bone-In Kona Crusted Dry Aged Sirloin - with shallot butter, which was far more steak then I'd normally ever have in one sitting but wow! It was so good I couldn't even leave a bite left on my plate. Cooked to perfection the meat with sharper taste of the shallot butter just melted in my mouth. It cames with the Sam's Mashed Potatoes & Fresh Creamed Spinach.  The potatoes were really tasty but the spinach I could've done without. This is easily enough food for two!\n\nOrdered a Stoli Doli to go with my meal. It's the signature drink at Capital Grille and definitely worth having more than once. \n\nAnd the Flourless Chocolate Espresso Cake! Oh the cake... If people could live without sex by eating this cake, they'd be fat on flavor and taste of this amazing cake.

For the price I felt the food could have been better.  For starters we ordered mozzarella and tomato salad and the Caesar.  The salads were both chilled, crisp, and the vinegar and spice balance for the mozzarella was very good.\nFor the entrees we got the salmon and the special bleu cheese encrusted fillet with grilled shrimp.  The salmon was cooked perfectly, but lacking on seasoning.  Where they were short on flavor on the salmon they made up for on the shrimp.  They definitely weren't shy with the seasoning which left something to be desired for the surf of the turf.  The steak was cooked to perfection and was extremely tender.  The waiter had sold the bleu cheese as a cream base infused with pepper and garlic.  Unfortunately it was just a few morsels of blue cheese pressed into the top of the meat.

I had the chicken breast that  once i got to the bone it blood and under cook.  and to finish the even off they were out of the cheesecake, and some of the guest  got the flourless coco cake which had molded rasphberry on her plate. yikes . it almost went in her mouth.

It was warm, not hot when it came out but still very tender and nicely flavored.  We both ordered it medium rare and it was cooked perfectly.  Two sides came with our meal and I think they were supposed to be family style but they were really what you would see if they were served on an individual plate.  The mashed potatoes were sticky/gummy and lukewarm.  They were served in the smallest family style portion I have ever seen.  Unless it was a small family of ants, I would say we got screwed on the potatoes.  The string beans were cold and hard (undercooked) and inedible.  Didn't touch them.\n\nThe desserts were decent.  The flourless chocolate cake was so rich it was unbearable.  It was the dark bitter chocolate flavor that just wasn't very good.  The small bite of cheesecake was good though.  Just....small.\n\nOverall, I would say this experience was subpar, especially for the reputation of the restaurant.  Why does service and quality AND quantity have to suffer because it is restaurant week?  They did all seem overly busy so I understand that everything isn't going to be perfect but we didn't even see our waiter the rest of the evening until he flung our check at us.  I guess I would say it was just overall disappointing.  The steak saved the day.  That was some darn good steak.\n\nNot in a hurry to come back....other competitors have won my heart.", "business_id": "CChwRoYVXA3QZulS8a6xOQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-07-31", "type": "review"}

We chose to go out to eat here as we had only heard great things about Capital Grille. We will never return to this establishment for a meal again. \n\nOur waiter was very nice and the decor of the restaurant is beautiful as well. For starters I got the mozzarella basil tomato salad. It was pretty good so no complaints there. I chose the special of the night for my entree which was three small steaks prepared in three signature ways. I loved two of them the balsamic one was pretty bad but not inedible. Our water glasses were left empty several times which I thought was weird considering how much a meal like this costs. My husband ordered the porterhouse and he asked for it to be medium. Well it was bordering on the side of well-done and I tasted his and didn't like it at all. He thought it was very dry and it wasn't hot it seemed as though it had been sitting around before they brought it out to us. Honestly the steaks he grills from Teeter have more flavor than this dish. This was obviously very disappointing but we just thought ok not worth the money but we would possibly return for the specialty dishes at a future date. \n\nThe main reason I am giving a one star review is because I woke up in the middle of the night with awful stomach pains and have been sick for the past 10 hours. My husband was nauseas but not as sick as me.  We didn't sleep practically at all last night and because of this i would never ever return here. I would recommend grilling steaks on your own grill and not wasting a ton of money to get an underwhelming sickening experience.", "business_id": "CChwRoYVXA3QZulS8a6xOQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-08-03", "type": "review"}

My husband didn't complain, not one bit. That was part of the deal. I am pretty sure that he wasn't complaining, not because he wasn't allowed but because he really enjoyed the night! \nOne of the first things that came out to the table was these Delicious little corn bread rolls with kudzu flower butter. You know, kudzu, that shit vine you cannot kill even by setting your yard on fire? Yeah, that plant. Well apparently the flower is really sweet and some genius decided to flavor some butter with it. NCDOT, here is your sign. \n\nSo, rolls--check. Delish. \nThen, my drink came out. I guzzled my gin and tonic and became a wildly appropriately drunk. I mean, come on, it was my birthday--and the entire staff knew it. Dan ignored me during these first few intolerable moments, then he just gave up and enjoyed his dinner. \nI started off with this lobster puff pastry thing that was served with a side of saffron ice cream. Dan referred to it as the \"lobster ice cream thing.\" He eye humped my food until I gave him a taste. Then he just stole it. It was that good. \nDan had cold soup, which just that day, Michelle and I talked about how she wasn't a complete fan of cold soup, but to my surprise, Dan ate the whole bowl and wiped the bowl clean with the extra corn bread thing. We swapped plates because I wanted to have some too. I am sure the waiter was totally confused when he picked up the plates. He probably questioned himself the rest of the night wondering if he made a mistake in who was supposed to get what dish. I didn't tell or correct him. I let him wonder. I was drunk, please remember this was funny at the time. \nThen came my pork tenderloin with peach schnapps topping, collard greens and cornbread cakes. Wow. Not just good, fan-effing-tastic! \nDan had the fillet. Fresh garlic and mushrooms. I had some of his too. It was effing delish too! \nThen, we had the \"cleansing of the palate\" raspberry sorbet. What a treat. I love ice cream if you haven't figured that out. I ate mine in little increments to make it last. Dan ate the whole thing in one bite. \nThen came the best part. Krispy Kreme bread pudding with Maker's Mark glaze, and it came to the table on FIRE! No candles needed here! I think it was about 27 dough-nuts packed into a little bread pudding upside down dish. Probably about 10,000 calories. But all worth it. I nearly licked the plate..rememeber, I was intoxicated. (and the fire had gone out by that time.)\nDan had this chocolate banana puff pastry with rum ice cream. He didn't share with me. What a bastard. It looked good, and if it was any less than perfect he might have then shared it with me. So I guess his dessert was top notch. \nI would tell you how wonderful the bathrooms were or how pretty the soap was, or how clean the toilets were, however, I was wearing 6 inch heals that didn't really allow me to walk around that well, (again, insert intoxicated mentioning here...) \nI did however walk 7 blocks back to where we parked. Dan thought it would be nice to walk around after such a wonderful night. I would have let him carry me on his back, but my high cut dress would have shown off my goodies to everyone. And in my drunken state, I would have thought it was funny while Dan would be dying of shame in the corner. So I walked. \nSavannah Red was AWESOME!! Will most definitely return. I will use the valet service next time, and maybe get wildly INappropriate next time. Especially if I know that I don't have to walk far.", "business_id": "C9CF7p53Y0L5ErKRhhFhng", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-07-06", "type": "review"}

I was completely shocked and felt horrible for our server and busser since they had to actually be there! \n\nI will say the decor was nice Red, Red, and more Red! Comfy chairs and a nice ambiance....would've been better if there were others in the place!! \n\nOk so out came the corn bread which was One of my 3 favorite things that night Delicious!! Second best my Margarita(s) that our server made was Awesome!! Third the Sorbet Palate Cleanser it was Strawberry Cantaloupe Delish! The problem is none of this makes a meal :( \n\nThey sent out an Amuse Bouche which was Seared Tuna with a Vidalia Onion something....FISHY so over cooked tasted worse than Tuna Fish it was just bad! We split the Duck and Corn Fritters, Flavorless and barely any duck in them. I had the Watermelon Salad it was supposed to be served with a Frisee salad not a Spinach salad, along with some Duck Prosciutto that was also missing from the plate. My sister enjoyed her salad... \n\nFor my Entree I ordered the T-bone Lamb...Over cooked not Rare-Medium Rare so I sent it back. I don't get lamb enough so when I find it on a menu I order it! So now I'm just sad because its not how I had wanted it but more so because when they did give it back it was cooked good but the Roasted Cauliflower Puree it was sitting on was like glue! Gross! The Lamb was so hard to cut that I had to stop cutting and breathe because it was like a workout! In Retrospect I should've just picked it up and eat it off the bone like my sister told me to do, but i was being a lady! \n\nOur server was very nice and by no means was this disastrous evening in any shape or form her fault! She even had taken our Dessert off because of the lamb having to be sent back. We had the Peaches and something...not bad but not great \n\nAll in all this meal was just sad!

And although it's been around for several years, I'm shocked it hasn't received the acclaim it deserves. \n\nI've had the pleasure to dine here 3 times and although the menu has changed every time I'd like to think I have an excellent idea of the quality of this place. Savannah Red is not just a cleaver name...it is red...really red. But I like it and the flame decor, it's just my thing maybe. Service, excellent every time. There was one night where a friend of my date called in ahead of time and ordered a bottle of wine for our table as a surprise. She presented the wine flawlessly and presented a hand written note for her. \n\nAs for the food...like I said, the most unique, inventive, and delicious menus in Charlotte. You can't go wrong w/their signature dishes, that's a no-brainer. The \"New South\" Shrimp and Grits were incredible, the addition of the scallops was a nice plus. As for the Tasso Gravy...as a southern boy, I'm not proud to say I haven't had it before this meal. So I have no basis for comparison, but it was GOOD...real good the smokiness of the pork really shined!  Their pork tenderloin was amazing and cooked well and the Maker's gastrique was a great compliment. \n\nTake a look at the menu, stop, and think...this place raises the bar on 'southern food'. It's not on the menu currently but even the Fried Green Tomatoes were awesome! The head chef here takes traditional southern food and puts it on a marble pedestal. Common...Kudzu Jelly Butter for Corn Bread?!?!  No one outside of the south has probably even heard of Kudzu, let alone know it flowers and that flower is used to flavor this magnificent Jelly Butter.  I haven't tried the Lobster Cobbler yet, but that will be consumed on my next visit...FACT!\n\nWhat put this place on the map for me...the Krispy Kreme Bread Pudding!  This furthers the brilliance of whoever created this menu.  Krispy Kreme is a NC creation and to make a desert of this quality w/another southern institution, bourbon (Maker's Mark caramel bourbon) sauce, is genius!

I dare say she might have been the worst server I have ever experienced -and it actually blows my mind that she earns tips on a daily basis. \n\nShe \"greets\" our table after 15 minutes of waiting in the lobby followed by 15 minutes of sitting at our table ...was the place slammed? No. Her greeting consisted of throwing her arms over the backs of our chairs and asking us if we'll buy her a shot of tequila.... then, when she took our order and her pen didn't work she turned around and threw it at the bar...nice. \n\n She dropped two of our meals (a filet and salmon) and then came over and said \"you heard that crash, that was your meal\" ...I then politely told her that my rare steak looked more well and she then answered \" well that's three people that have to wait for their meals...rolled her eyes and stormed off\" ...nice.\n\nShe then brings out the salmon...gosh that poor friend who ordered salmon. The first time it was served raw. Then she had to send it back yet again- the third time it was served without sauce. They finally just brought her out her sides to eat while she waiting for her dish since this was going on a 2. 5 hour meal at this point....nice. \n\nEveryone paid the full cost of their meal which was fine for me as steak is over/under cooked quite frequently but there really was no excuse for the salmon at that point - 3 times you blew it.\n\n To make matters worse our server tacked on her 20% at the end - of course, that's why her service sucked (to be frank), she knew all along she would be tipped- why try? Oh and at the end she exclaimed that in 20 minutes she would be drinking tequila, I had only hoped she saved enough for me...lord knows I needed it at that point!\n\nI will say the only reason I gave it two stars instead of one was that the manager brought me a complimentary dessert and glass of sparkling wine, for she seemed to be the only professional who cared about her guests and how they were treated. I know that problems with the meals are often not the fault of a server, but to be friendly, helpful, and in general apologetic ...or even sympathetic to your guests, well that is the job of the server, and she failed miserably.\n\nDisappointed is an understatement .

I know that every review says amazing things about it, and the description on the menu made my mouth water, but as much as I like desserts, I didn't eat much of mine.  In fact, I went back to my hotel bar and ordered some strawberries with vanilla marscapone cream, and that was yummy!  \n\nStill, this was one of the best meals I've had in as long as I can remember.  First, they brought cornbread and strawberry cornbread with cheese and Kudzu butter.  I would have been satisfied with just that for dinner.  But then, they brought the diver scallops appetizer with the sliced figs.  They were tender.  They were gently seared.  They practically melted in my mouth.  I detected a hint of tamarind, but it could be my imagination.  \n\nThanks to fellow Yelper Zan F's recommendation, I passed up bison for the shrimp and grits and was glad I did.  The shrimp and scallops were almost an afterthought, as I wanted to ask the waitress for a bowl of grits to go for breakfast the next day.  The spicy smoky Tasso Gravy was a nice touch.  \n\nMy dinner companion 'allowed' me a taste of the guinea hen, and that was cooked to perfection too.  Crispy outside, fatty in some places, lean in others, but flavorful and supple all around.  I really liked the spicy black kale too!\n\nCompared to other restaurants of the same caliber, this isn't one of the pricier ones.

For my entree I ordered a special - Yellow Fin Tuna with a grain of some sort and asparagus - I had it cooked medium, and it was great. There was just enough seasoning, but not too much to over power. The grains were mild and complimented the tuna. I would order it again.

The sauce is VERY heavy on the bourbon-I could smell the alcohol in it when it arrived which worried me since I dont like liquor but the taste was amazing. \n\nFor an appetizer, I had a gazpacho that was filled with lump crab. The crab was very high quality and the gazpacho had a nice vinegary flavor but it was kind of thin. My entree was cobia with collard greens and polenta. The cobia was seasoned very well but it had an odd texture-a tad rubbery and tougher than I usually like my fish. To be fair, this was my first experience with cobia so I dont know if the texture was the fault of the restaurant or if it always tastes this way (one of the reasons that I decided to give the benefit of the doubt and go with the four star review). The collards and polenta were supurb thanks to the spicy, savory seasoning and they definitely enhanced the fish and helped make up for its shortcomings. The fish definitely tasted better when eaten with a mouthful of the side dishes. \n\nI went to Savanna Red during restaurant week to take advantage of the deals and I would like to go back and try it during a regular week because some of the most intriguing dishes werent on the restaurant week menu.

Distance wise, proximity - Charlotte to Atlanta is a hop skip and a jump from each other on 85!  I will get into that aspect another time.  The Carolina Panthers since inception have been a solid NFL franchise.  When I think of the Panthers from the start of its existence, I think of that solid defense in the 90s.  Going from there, it's Jake leading the helm and was very close to a superbowl victory.  It's a franchise on the rise though.  They have the weapons in place on offense to do some damage, the question is can they stay healthy and attack well on defense.

Guess I better take care of that, now that they've gone and upgraded the stadium and all.\n\nFirst off, those new ribbon boards - and the gigantic new video screens - are bright, especially at night. They could likely turn off the lights on the corners of the field and just light the place with the video screens they are so bright. Also love that the Duke Energy Tower works with the team to be all showy when the Panthers score. Definitely makes for a fun vibe.\n\nSpeaking of a fun vibe, the new music and drum line (Purrcussion - cute) works as well when the team enters the field. Now if they would just get rid of that lame cat roar every time the team gets a first down. I mean, really - once in a while, fine, but every. Single. Time? Are we all three?\n\nThe good news is that staff at the game has been amped up over the years - there are people galore all willing to help with a smile - as you get to your entrance, to the turnstiles, even as you approach the escalators, get to the bottom, the mid-point and the top, always making sure you are headed in the right direction. I was almost afraid to go into the bathroom because I was afraid how they would help.\n\nUnfortunately prices are still high for just about anything - a bottle of water will cost you $4 at a concession stand, or $5 if they bring it to you (yes, the tip is built-in). Of course, you can still tip, but that's up to you. The seats are on the small side for our large, American-sized rears, and can get uncomfortable after a few hours sitting in them, and the climb to to the top is a challenge - but there really isn't a bad seat in the house.", "business_id": "b0QFCPXbG7k_TBexxs9fCQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-08-18", "type": "review"}

Plus the fries are always hot and fresh made to order yummy!! \n\nFYI the BF is rather picky and can be snobby about restaurants but he loved this place too ;-) just saying!!", "business_id": "nkNdTqpv1m5GBKx8xrpluw", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-08-19", "type": "review"}

The live band that they had was very good, playing the usual popular classics (3am, Sweet Home Alabama, Play That Funky Music, Don't Stop Believing, etc). I think what impressed me the most this night was the upgrade in the music selection. They went way beyond the typical top 40 that they usually play when the live band isn't performing. The DJ kinda sucked though....he was mixing in other songs halfway through songs that just didn't blend in well, and he played some songs twice within a 30 minute time frame. There was some really good hip hop (some old Snoop, Luniz, etc) being played that night.

Out of the reviews that are on here it looks like most were geared toward the night life, which we didn't stick around for. We came solely to try the food. \n\nEverything on the menu sounded so good, and they had a decent range of dishes for you to choose from, with the countries that the dish is from written on the side of each choice. I think it would be hard to come here and have a hard time finding something that sounds good to you, even for the pickiest of eaters. \n\nOur waitress was very friendly and had our drinks out pretty quickly, and she was great at helping us choose which dishes to go with. For appetizer we had the crab con queso - you MUST get this!! I can't even tell you how good it was, you just need to go experience it yourself. It was a crab dip blended together with cheeses, (hence, the name), and it was amazing. They serve it with nachos, and the waitress made a joke about how she literally needed to pry it from our hands because our entrees were about ready to come out and she wanted to clear our table. We also got the Dim Sum as an app, which were basically shrimp dumplings, and they came with a thai peanut dipping sauce that was very tasty. \n\nThen our entrees came out - Oh my Wild Mushroom Ravioli! I have to admit that when it first came out I was doubtful, because it didn't look like much, but it was a deep dish and the raviolis were a decent size. The mushroom brown sauce that the ravs were buried in was out of control. SO good. My fiancee ordered the Tuna Filet Mignon, rare, and it was excellent (of course I saved room for a sample). The only thing that wasn't so good was the \"mashed potatoes\" surrounded the filet, and I put it in quotations because they were definitely questionable. They tasted totally artificial, and if you hadn't told me they were mashed potatoes I would be stuck wondering what it was. Looked like someone stuck microwaveable cauliflower mystery mix and stuffed it through a pastry gun to make it look pretty. I'd order the dish but skip the \"mash\". \n\nOur bill came and we were pretty stunned that we had drinks, 2 apps, and two entrees, and it was only around $60. Definitely not bad! We will be back for sure, for dinner and to stick around for the night scene. We also liked how it had a casual vibe, yet everyone was dressed really nice. Just as a side-note about uptown: I am finding that about a lot of the places we visit; everyone looks really good, the girls dress so cute, but it's not uptight.", "business_id": "e5J3s-xxs1S6PPHJhldBEA", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-08-02", "type": "review"}

First of all, quick note about the movie itself - believe the hype. It is that good. Now, onto the theatre...\n\nThis was our second attempt at going, our first being Sunday night, but unfortunately it was sold out then. They open 45 minutes before showtime, and we got there to find a long line of people who we thought were waiting to purchase tickets - turns out they had all purchased way earlier, the showing had been sold out for hours and they were just waiting to get in and claim their seats. Smart move. We followed suit yesterday. The one thing you want to make sure of when you are going here is that you get there early to ensure a seat in the middle. We were fortunate, and set right in the center of the theatre. \n\nI can't imagine people's experiences who sat in the not-so-good seating area, like the way front, or all the way up top or out to the sides. The first thing we said upon leaving was, \"Wow, we need to go back and see it on the regular screen.\" I was unaware until last night that apparently there is a difference between IMAX, and IMAX DOME, which this theatre is. I always remember IMAX as a huge screen that makes you feel like you are almost in the showing, traveling around with the characters. The Dome wraps the picture all the way around the theatre and onto the ceiling so you are looking up at it. This sounds awesome, but this made it very difficult to fully experience the film.  I'm sad to say that the fight scenes were completely lost on me - they move so fast that they make you dizzy in IMAX, and it's impossible to see everything because the screen spans so wide that you miss what's going on on the sides.  If you get dizzy easily, it'd probably be a wise decision to skip this. \n\nOverall, this was a great experience and I will definitely return to see the other great showings, like Pompeii, and Greece, but as for the movies like this, I'll take it to the original big screen.", "business_id": "ZBQWSsUXwixFmm3lpegMiA", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-08-06", "type": "review"}

For me, some of the highlights was the bed of nails, the tinfoil/duct tape construction projects, and the featured wildlife. However, I can honestly say that there wasn't much that I didn't find reasonably interesting. \n\nOverall, as an out of town visitor I found this place to be a very interesting way to spend an afternoon. Everyone in my group really enjoyed themselves and we were totally glad that we took the time to check it out.", "business_id": "ZBQWSsUXwixFmm3lpegMiA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-07-22", "type": "review"}

They have so many fun things to do, a fun water section, lots of things to experiment, lots of building activities, plenty of live animals....  But we really like the \"shows\" they do.  Theres one called sub zero right now where they show the effects of dry ice on things adn the kids get to play in the steam and watch rubber gloves get frozen and crack.... my kids are mesmerized.

I figured since I would most likely be coming many times in the next few weeks, I should consider a membership but I wasn't sure that they would like it but the front desk person informed me that I could just pay that days admission fee and if I decided to get a family membership, they would refund me and I could purchase it.  To make a long story short, we have been about 8 or more times already and though my kids have their favorite things, we try to discover something new every time.  My older two had a chance to go in and watch one of the 3D movies that's included in the admission price.  It's about 14 minutes long and one of two movies plays every half hour.  The iMax movie is an additional cost though.  So, to make a long story short, here are a few things you will get coming here:  Gift shop, building forts, towers, laying on a bed of nails, air lift, chair pulleys, make your own shoes, quiz games, rat basketball tournaments, bugs, microscopes, frogs, fish, puffer fish, turtles in the rainforest, snakes, spiders, jellyfish, an awesome room with so many great things to play and experiment with for children 7 and under, a caf\u00e9 and just way too much to list here.

Now when NY boys are out of state, we gotta represent to the fullest.  The nightlife in Charlotte was interesting to say the least but it had a ton of potential.  \n\nThe city's bars and clubs almost emulate Manhattan and it's a 50/50 type of feeling one gets.

Anyway, after checking out a few of the bars and clubs, we hit Dixie's Tavern. \n\nOf course, the thought of two \"brothas\" walking into a spot with that name may make you shudder with fear and anxiety.  The place was very laid back and popping with a really nice sized crowd.  I purposely wore my College of Saint Rose t-shirt to lure out the New Yorkers in the crowd and there were plenty.  Albany, NYC, Long Island...we probably met close to 15 of them.\n\nThe music was mixed and that was OK with us.  It bounced between old school hip hop, top 40, country and classic rock.  It's almost like VH1, BET and CMT got blended into an interesting recipe and the dish was plated as Dixie's Tavern. \n\n It was the typical NY vibe were we argued with NC people about the Yankees, the Giants, Biggie, Jay-Z, pizza, etc...all good and fun drunken joking with the locals.  It was almost like an old school New Paltz type of night.  We saw a couple of fights, some vomiting, slow bar-tending...typical NY college town stuff.  We also discovered that we were there the LAST NIGHT they were open.  I guess they've closed and I have no idea what's there now.

Well those were our thoughts exactly so on came the leg warmers and the tacky scrunchies and off we went to experience 1980 once again!\n\nThe venue was obviously trying to cash in on the Speed Street crowds as it charged us a whopping $10 to park our cars ....and then another $7 (for girls- more for guys) to get in! I can completely understand charging for parking if we weren't entering their bar to spend money- but they obviously weren't out to please customers. \n\nSo I walked in the door after spending $17 expecting at least maybe a break on the drinks -WRONG. This was definitely not the 80s as they accounted for inflation big time! This was more/as expensive than even some of the trendier clubs in Charlotte (and nothing can be said for quality by the way). I ordered a red bull and (well) vodka - $8!\n\n.... We excitedly exclaimed we were celebrating a special Bday night but the bartender did nothing to make it special or exciting and actually gave us really bad service! \n\nI have to say my breaking point was  when I attempted to get some water for myself and my friends to which I was rudely told they only had bottled water. I mean seriously?! How irresponsible is that to serve alcoholic drinks and then not have a glass of water available!\n\n Around 12:30 I wanted to close out my tab and literally waited (trust me I kept track) twenty minutes. I can understand if for whatever reason it is packed and there is only one bartender - but they had two bartenders and a bar back (who couldn't even bother to acknowledge my presence) and the place was fairly empty! I have worked in the service industry through college and trust  me when I say I can empathize in almost any situation but I had had enough. \n\nWhen the bartender went to another group who had just walked up to the bar instead - (thankfully they pointed out that I had been waiting long before them...even though I know he saw me) ...he was not a good bartender. \n\nThe ONLY redeeming quality (hence the two-stars) was the music and the theme of the venue itself. Unfortunately that wasn't enough to save them in my eyes, as I will NOT be returning.", "business_id": "Zw-sWBbL3Z9zyZ0ri9UT_g", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-06-01", "type": "review"}

Also so awesome is the fact they have all your favorite music videos on while they play the songs, so in case you don't really know quite how to Push it real good, you can cheat and look. \nYa, so they have a cover and parking fee (boo) but then you walk in and you are transported back in the 80s, and you have beer specials at $1, $2 and $3 and friends greeting each other. You have bright lights and posters of your favorite 80's actors, you have a humongo rubik's cube and Fast Times at Ridgemont High playing. The downstairs has sort of open booths where you can just chat and upstairs is the dance floor, with an additional top floor. \nThis is the place to come unwind and let go of your inhibitions because nobody cares - so what if you're too old, too young, too un-stylish, too dolled up, you have everyone from your mother, to the young break dancers to the John Cusack wannabe's to the born again Michael Jackson's at this joint. \n\nJust come here and let yourself go and test out those dance moves that you secretly practice in front of the mirror at home. I love the diversity, I love the fact that you can come and dance and not worry about what you look like. Although, if you are really concerned, there's a whole wall of mirrors for you to check yourself out, also useful if you want to perfect that Sprinkler move.  \n\nI love it and I will definitely be back. I guarantee, even if you're not an 80's aficionado you will find one song to love.

The club itself is kind of cool...a giant Rubik's cube hanging from the ceiling, neat hand chairs to sit in, and 80's movie posters everywhere. It has 3 levels, and you can really only sit and talk on the first level. The drinks were $8 for a tiny cup, so I didn't get anything, but my friends said they were good. They play only music from the 80's, which includes a lot of good stuff AND a lot of bad stuff. Michael Jackson and Bobby Brown just doesn't do it for me, but they did play good stuff too, like Duran Duran, New Order, the Cure, and Depeche Mode. My only gripe with this place is the parking. When we drove in, there was a sign that parking was $5, but my friend said parking was free, and the $5 was only for special events. So we didn't pay anything. When we come out, everyone had a parking ticket on their windshield! And it was for $25! My friend went to complain at the door, and they said to email the contact on the ticket and appeal it and you don't have to pay. What a pain.

I really don't. Because my alcohol tolerance is (now) that of a 65 year old, sometimes it's just better that I have a drink or two and get home by midnight.

The venue is incredibly unique, kitsch-ly decorated and BIG. A really great place to bring a bunch of guys or girls and celebrate a fun decade. \n\nThe cons: Some other guests can be overly drunk and, therefore, douchy. Drinks are expensive for what they are. I recall paying $8 for the tiniest of tiny rail vodka soda.

The pass costs $15. The hotel's gym is not what I have been accustomed to in four and five star hotels. It has a couple cardio machines and some free weights - if you want a full workout, you won't get it there. The Charlotte Athletic Club is a wonderful gym and is just as easily accessed as the hotel's own. It bothered me that I had to pay $15, however, to use the gym.

Luckily, it's 7:30pm, but somehow from the presence of the earplugs provided in my bedside drawer, I'm not sure that the party's going to end by the time I need to call it a night.\n\nThe same goes for inside the hotel - a couple nights ago there were some folks in the hall, obviously having come back from a good night at the bars - and I could hear every. single. thing. that they said to each other.  It was all in good fun, I wasn't anywhere close to calling it a night - but that doesn't mean that others with their Privacy Please signs weren't.\n\nOther than the noise pollution issue, though, the place is pretty nice.  Rooms are decent-sized, and provide the expected amenities - including flat-screen TVs (which shouldn't be a surprise in this day and age, but somehow can be).  Their Wi-Fi is charged at $10-$15 per night, based on bandwidth, unless you subscribe to their frequent guest program, which means they'll take it off at the end of your stay.\n\nThe lobby connects directly to the Epicenter or the BB&T building by walkways, and also opens up directly to the Bank of America Center, which makes it pretty much an awesome location for business travelers.  There's a Walgreens in the lower lobby, as well as a Starbucks, Chick-Fil-A, and several other quick-grub places.\n\nOverall, it's a nice place to stay with some minor issues - the location as a whole could use an update, but I've stayed at plenty worse places in my time as a business traveler.", "business_id": "QThlnQ7AvzZwXHKD5DjdCw", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-08-22", "type": "review"}

But I know how serious you all take your barbecue.  During my recent trip there, I had co-workers who took me to Mac's Speed Shop for what they told me was authentic Carolina barbecue.  I loved it.  I noticed that Mac's has 3 1/2 stars currently on Yelp, same as this place.  \n\nCharllotte Yelpers, how can you tell me that this place is anywhere near as good as Mac's?  \n\nYou see, I had one day to myself to get lunch.  I decided to trust the Yelp app to find me another barbecue place.  I saw this place was near me, and having never heard of it before being from Philadelphia, I assumed this would be another authentic place.  And even though it had less reviews, I thought since it had the same level of stars as Mac's, I'd get some good barbecue that was at least as close as what they serve there. \n\nIt was about 5 minutes into sitting down here when I realized that I was sitting in the south's version of Famous Dave's.  \n\nDon't get me wrong.  I enjoyed the combo that I had.  It wasn't bad at all.  But come on.  If you want authentic barbecue, you don't come here.  I felt slightly let down.  \n\nNow that I've had my \"What the hell are you thinking Charlotte\" rant, I'll say that for a chain restaurant, the food was pretty tasty, the service was very good, and I'd eat here again if I ever had the chance.

Some days are better than others for the fare, but the service has always been top notch.  Folks here have always been friendly and helpful.\n\nI recently discovered their Redneck Egg Rolls.  An egg roll stuffed with pork, slaw and cheese, served with a smoky ranch.  Yes, please. Delicious.  Seriously.  The egg roll is mostly meat, which hardly ever happens.  And MUCH better than the similar item that I had at a snootier hipster place in Charlotte.  The corn nuggets have a description that makes them sound a bit iffy, but I enjoy those as well - they're different and satisfy a salty sweet craving, if you have one.  \n\nThe garlic bread is good, and the corn bread is flavored well, though a bit crumbly and messy.  Mac and cheese is fine, green beans are flavored with pork (the way Jeebus intended them to be), fries are crinkle cut and standard, slaw is yummy.  I really haven't had any of the sides that I hated, but none are OHMYDOG delicious.\n\nAnd for the meat.. oh, the meat... all of us girls want good meat.  It's fine.

Maybe because it was beside the ice cream sundae stand.  They had Rip Roaring Rapids which was a little float going down a little river with water splashing everywhere.

Most of the rides only took about 15-20 minutes to board, with the exception of Nighthawk.\n\nThere are plenty of coasters to ride, but there's also a number of more sedate rides and kiddie rides as well to balance it out for those who are not into flying all over the place.  I didn't try the on-site water park this time around but that is on my list for next time.\n\nThis is another park that has cubbies to store your stuff when you go on the ride, and they didn't object to me carrying a Camelbak into the park, so I was able to just drink my water all day.  If you want to eat at the park, you have a variety of choices, including a few chain restaurants such as Chik-Fil-A and Panda Express, along with the usual pizza and burger joints.  There is also an all-you-can-eat lunch with a different menu each day of the week for about $15 a person.  However, if you want to save some cash, pack a lunch in the cooler and step out to your car to eat.\n\nThe one issue I do have with Carowinds is that there is only one real road to leave the park.  All traffic from all parking lots merge onto a two-lane road, so it can become a major headache when trying to leave towards the end of the day when everyone else is trying to leave.  I stayed at the park to watch their 4th of July fireworks and it took about 90 minutes before I could even leave the parking lot, and that was only after they opened up the employee access road to let people leave.  I hope this can be fixed in the future.\n\nThe roller coasters worth riding are Afterburn (a personal favorite), Carolina Cyclone, Thunder Road, and Nighthawk (if you're willing to wait).  Carolina Goldrusher is good for those who are not into high thrill coasters.  Vortex is also fun, but guys be warned, it is a stand-up coaster and the bottom part of the restraint is not so fun on the groin.  The Rugrats Runaway Reptar, Fairly Odd Coaster, and Ricochet are more for the kids.  If you're going to do Carolina Cobra, do it when the park opens because by design, there is only one car, so it will take longer than most other coasters that have 2-3 cars.", "business_id": "n9iK0s1dKxv5JLi3u1eTkQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-08-02", "type": "review"}

I grew up in Michigan, and thus was a regular at Cedar Point. And although I've lived in Charlotte for almost six years, last week was the first chance I got to really check out Carowinds. I was impressed; for a regional theme park, this place really has a lot going for it. \n\nMy family was in town, including my four-year-old nephew, so we decided to try and deplete some of his limitless energy at Carowinds. We went on a Monday in order to miss out on the crowds. Parking was easy and we were very close to the front gate. And if you buy your passes online or at the Harris Teeter, they are cheaper and let you bypass that portion of the line, so I highly recommend checking into that. \n\nThe rides were very good and the kid area was fabulous. Very shaded for the little ones and tons for them to do. I also like that the admission fee includes access to the water park. We spent a large portion of the day at the theme park and then hit up the water park before heading home. Food was good, but as expected, quite pricey. And all of the workers at the park were friendly and helpful. \n\nThe only recommendation that I would make would be to open up the picnic area for those who want to bring in their own food for lunch. We brought our lunch and ended up eating it in the (air-conditioned) car as you aren't allowed to bring food into the park.

The reason for this is that I am a Charlotte native (a rare breed), and Carowinds is the sort of institution that is just a part of the local fabric.  Growing up here, I have always gone to Carowinds; everyone has always gone to Carowinds; Carowinds has always been THERE.  This even goes back a generation: my parents were going to Carowinds when Thunder Road was the biggest ride in town.\n\nThat being said, I do believe Carowinds holds its own, especially as a regional theme park.  After all, with the introduction of the Intimidator, the park has the tallest, fastest coaster in the Southeast.  That's pretty cool.  The food is overpriced (as is to be expected), and with so much human traffic throughout the day, you're bound to run into the occasional spot of ick.  But on the whole, the park is fairly clean and the staff is about as polite as you can expect a bunch of teenaged summer employees to be.\n\nI suppose that's as objective as I am going to get.  Here are thoughts on some specific rides:\n\nIntimidator: tallest, fastest, etc.  Probably my favorite coaster.  Line can get long-ish, but it moves fairly quickly.  The first ascent to is a true \"wtf-why-am-I-doing-this-we're-all-gonna-die\" moment followed by \"WHEEEE!\"\n\nAfterburner: Formerly Top Gun.  Always Top Gun to me, actually.  My second favorite: it's still a lot of fun and since Intimidator opened, the line is usually very quick.\n\nNighthawk: Formerly the Borg.  You're suspended as though you were lying on your stomach, staring at the ground. I honestly can't decide if this one thrills me or terrifies me.  The line can be very long and slow, since the boarding process is fairly complicated.  I sometimes skip this one.\n\nVortex: Otherwise known as the ball-cruncher.  I am too tall for this one, fortunately.\n\nCarolina Cyclone: On the old side, but those corkscrew twists are still pretty cool. If you are tall, make sure you sent in the front, or you will have shattered shins.\n\nThunder Road: This old gal gets a bad rep for being bumpy, but I still find it pretty dang thrilling.  Perhaps because it is a wooden coaster, it *feels* incredibly fast and dangerous.  It's not as high as the Intimidator, but it feels subjectively faster to me, although I know it's not. Line is pretty short now that the shiny, metal coasters have eclipsed it in the public eye.\n\nHurler: Another older wooden ride.  Again, I think the (hopefully untrue) impression of rickety-ness from that method of construction adds to excitement.  The deeply-banked turns are fun.\n\nCobra: Short, lightning fast, but awesome.  A great \"whew, we're done--OMG NO WE'RE NOT\" moment.", "business_id": "n9iK0s1dKxv5JLi3u1eTkQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-07-01", "type": "review"}

Some friends from up there came down for the weekend and we decided to check out Carowinds. I know what to expect from these places...ridiculously high prices for a day of exhilarating thrill rides. Carowinds rides definitely deliver the thrills, but it falls victim to the same issues to plague most amusement parks.\n\nLike the other theme parks out there, it's expensive to visit the place. Admission will cost you $45 (as long as you buy on their website...otherwise its $55 at the gate) unless you are frugal like me and opt to enter the park after 4pm, when the price drops to $25 online/ $30 at the gate. Throw in the $12 parking fee and you're dropping some serious dough before even entering the park. Once inside expect the high prices to continue, as you will be spending a crudload of money on food, drinks and other junk. We decided to eat dinner there and spent $23 on a chicken sandwich, turkey burger, side salad and small drink. Not only is the price high itself, but the quality of the food and service do nothing to warrant the price. It's hard to plan a day at the park without purchasing at least one meal there, so it is a necessary evil. Unfortunately it is a tasteless, inconvenient, rude and expensive evil.\n\nNow on to the park. I will say that Carowinds is one of the cleaner parks I've been to, and the bathrooms tended to be pretty well-maintained as well. The ride operators were slightly more friendly than the other service employees, but I suppose that running a roller coaster is more fun than standing in a booth selling parking tickets. \n\nThere is a decent selection of rides, though I did find that there were more higher-end thrill rides than moderate rides. If you like roller coasters than this will be a divine experience for you, as their coaster selection is pretty top-notch. Vortex was the first \"standing\" coaster I've been on and it was quite a unique experience, and the Intimidator was one of the fastest coasters I've ever been on. Unfortunately the miss' cannot handle the coasters like she used to and there were less rides she could go on than what other similar parks will offer. \n\nWould I go back to Carowinds again? Probably, but definitely not with just my wife and I. If other friends or family came to town at some point and I knew they were into these kinds of rides I'd be willing to shell out the cash to visit again, but I am in no rush to return. The coasters are definitely a lot of fun but the price of admission will stop me from going back any time soon.", "business_id": "n9iK0s1dKxv5JLi3u1eTkQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-06-03", "type": "review"}

The last time I was at Carowinds she was 9 months old, and now, she's 23!\nLets go back in history for a moment. When Carowinds opened in 1973, It was owned and operated by Duke Power, which is now Duke Energy. All employees and family members got in for free. My Dad, being a Duke employee, I used to get into Carowinds for free. Thats right, free! I think parking was only $3.00 As Duke Power sold off it's share of the park, employees and family still got in for a greatly reduced rate. My wife and I spent many a Saturday date night here!\nFast forward to today. Now tickets are $45 online, $55 at the gate plus tax and $12 for parking! My daughter got a seasons pass in early May when they offered them at a discount, which includes unlimited entrance to the park , free parking and days where you can bring friends and they pay only $20 for a ticket, which is the best deal if you go there often. They also offer many other  pass and ticket options, which adds to the price, up to almost $180!\nOk, back to Father's Day- The park was crowded, but not what we expected. With partly cloudy skies, it was'nt to hot, and the water rides helped with that. Lines for rides were not bad. Most people seemed to have brought their manners with them as well. My Daughter got me on the new Windseeker and one extreme coaster plus many other rides. The 3D Sponge Bob motion ride was cool too, but I enjoyed the water rides the best.\n Food and drinks inside the park are uber expensive, so do what we and a lot of others did, pack a picnic, have you hand stamped and go to your car and tailgate. Just remember you can only have one re-admission during the day.\nThe park had really changed from my last visit-There was those carinval style games every where tryring to get even deeper into your wallet. Even after paying the high ticket and parking prices there is so much that cost extra you could easily drop another $100 or more inside the park depending on your family size.\nOver all, I had a great day with my Daughter, and if she invited me to go with her again, I would, but would my wife and I spend a $120 for two tickets, tax and parking to visit Carowinds??

It was incredibly crowded and they warn you on the website not to go on Saturdays but again we had no choice and wanted to take our two kids 13 and 15 year olds to do the coasters. I have some tips that we found that will hopefully make your trip more enjoyable. They do offer fast passes but they were $40 extra on that day(different prices at different days) so x4 that was not happening for us. one thing we found out that if you ask for a large cup of ice water (instead of the tiny tiny ones they first offer you) they will give you the larger ice water cups for free! Otherwise, if you prefer bottled water, then it is $10 for 4 bottles then you could fill those up at the water fountains near all of the bathrooms. We were craving a milkshake and went to the Jukebox diner and they said they were out of milkshakes! However, there was plenty of other food and snack places. I found the layout of the park very confusing and I am usually good at directions. There are not any directional signs so make sure you ask for a map. Another tip is to see if there are any coupon codes online. I bought our tickets in advance and found two specials that brought the cost down to $31/each. One of our favorite coasters was the Afterburn. It was worth the 40 min wait. The kids liked the southern star and there was no wait. They waited for the vortex and it was about 1 1/2 hour wait! And the two drinking water fountains in the line were broken. this is a 90 degree day in the summer. Also, How hard would it be for them to post a sign at the entrance to each coaster line that had an \"approximate wait time from this point.\"? I am not expecting Disney standards but they could easily improve the experience of each guest with minimal effort. We walked through the water park section and decided against it. it was crazy crowded. I recommend wearing a bathing suit under your clothes if you plan on trying out that part of the park. Even with all of my complaining All in all, I had a fun time going on 5 or so coasters/rides. If you enjoy rollercoasters, this place has amazing ones!

For example, going to Bojangles can get you $15 off.  Various schools and hospitals have various discounts ranging from 50% off to only $10 off. You'll never feel like you got a good deal.\n\nParking - Preferred parking is $25 while standard parking is $15.  Preferred parking is basically designed for families that want to eat outside of the park for lunch or dinner and I would recommend it if you plan on coming in and out of the park.\n\nWeather - It rained just an hour after we arrived here. There are no rain checks or refunds. Most of the rides shut down until a good 30 minutes after the sun started shining. It can really put a damper on your day.\n\nRides - There are some pretty good rides and some really, really bad rides.  The log-ride is literally one slope.  Literally one.  If you don't know this beforehand, you might wait an hour to experience about 15 seconds of ride.  Drop-zone (I forget its new name) is literally one free fall for a couple of seconds.  Do not waste your time on these two rides. Good rides include The Intimidator and After-Burn which are both quite impressive.  You can expect to wait quite a long time for each of them but I would recommend waiting for a front-seat on each of them.  It's really a great experience to see the entire park from the top of the coaster and you really do get a great sense of flying on After-Burn. \n\nOne thing that really bothered me about some of the rides is that no one cleans the restraints, especially the overhead bars, and as a result, it's stained with the odor, oils and dirt of thousands of riders before you. As a result, my experience on Night-Hawk was not quite as pleasant as I would have liked. In addition, somebody should tell the ride operators that there is no need to speak loudly into the microphones because most of the time they're painfully loud and the speakers are distorting.\n\nFood - $10 minimum for any main entr\u00e9e, $4 for drinks, everything will gouge you. They don't allow ANY outside food or drinks. Prepare your wallets.\n\nExtras - The dinosaur park is $2.50/person for groups of 4 and it was kinda nice, but you have to really like reading (there's a LOT to read) and learning to get the most out of it.  The 3D movie about dinosaurs is included but it's kind of depressing, and doesn't have the cool gimmicks like moving seats or mist that Star Tours or Honey I Shrunk The Audience had. \n\nIn conclusion, I actually had a great time at the theme park with my friends and wife, mostly because we luckily came to the park on a Sunday that apparently wasn't very popular and thus didn't have to wait very long on any lines.  Had we come on a \"normal\" day, I probably would have been a little bit less happy.", "business_id": "n9iK0s1dKxv5JLi3u1eTkQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-06-15", "type": "review"}

This past Saturday for the second time on a weekend and I would recommend avoiding the weekends if you want to get on any rides.\n \nThe man and I are season pass holders so we normally go after work on nice days during the week and will work shifted hours so we have a half day in the middle of the week as a grown up \"hookie day\". These are the times to go! Especially if you go early in the season before the kiddos are out of school. \n\nWe also opted for the meal plan so we have been scoping out all the dining establishments on site. Papa Luigi's is the best of the options for pizza and you can purchase overpriced alcohol here if you wish. Jukebox Diner has the best hamburger and a neat diner feel. Harmony Hall Marketplace has great AC, terrible hamburgers, okay pizza and BBQ but they do offer salad if you are looking for the healthy option. Every meal combo is $10.99 without a drink so keep that in mind when planning your day. They will give you a cup of water at every food station for free if you request it. \n\nI would avoid going during peak times if possible because then the majority of the day will be spent standing and waiting. The rides don't have wait estimations either so it is anyone's guess as to how long you will have to wait. When we were there last Saturday they were completely out of lockers too which meant we couldn't enjoy Boomerang Bang as much as we wanted. \n\nAll said it is an okay place to go for locals but I would not drive out of my way to go. We live close so it works out for us.", "business_id": "n9iK0s1dKxv5JLi3u1eTkQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-06-17", "type": "review"}

I grew up going to Busch Gardens Williamsburg and have been to many parks along the east coast- this is the worst one I have ever been to. \n\nCarowinds has horrible line management. As you wait hours in line, you have to watch coasters go by with as many as ten empty seats. This may be due to the fact that you can't pick your seat, on most rides a worker is waiting to tell you where you can sit. One of our line waits was spent watching EMTs tend to a young man who had his face bashed open on the ride somehow. \n\nOn top of that, my boyfriend and I encountered the rudest staff there. The second I walked in the gate, a teenager started yelling at me because I wasn't lifting my arms high enough for the security check- not a good way to start the day. While ordering lunch, there was a problem and the young girl sneered and rolled her eyes at us. When we spoke with the manager she told us point blank, \"I'm not saying you're a liar but I don't believe you.\" Long story short we paid for an item they didn't have in stock and they wouldn't refund our money! They just expected us to pick something else- it was mind boggling. \n\nOverall the rides are mediocre and you won't get to ride many because of extensive lines (we made it to 5 in 10 hours). The majority of the rides are identical to those at Kings Dominion in Virginia , which we've always had positive experiences at. Avoid this place if you have the option.", "business_id": "n9iK0s1dKxv5JLi3u1eTkQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-06-19", "type": "review"}

Robert at dippin dots was extremely nice and helpful to us and we weren't even purchasing anything from him. He supervisor at \"The Juke Box\" where we purchased a beer was not very polite at all. His name was Jordan. Maybe he was just having a bad day, idk. As a matter of fact, everyone at he park was nice except for The juke box employees. Maybe Jordan's negativity trickles down. There was one girl, Tykia, who worked the register at the juke box and she was incredibly nice.

I was sad to find out that after I got there they really did not have much else that was different from other parks except for Intimidator.   I must admit that Intimidator was an amazing ride with a lot of out of your seat airtime and Fury 325 was so high and so fast that it was one of the best coasters I have ever been on.  Other than those two rides all else was old and had been there for many years.  The Carolina Cyclone and Thunder Road were the worst coasters I have ever been on, they were far to bumpy and whipped your head.  They should be closed down for good and removed from the park.  Hurler, Nighthawk and Afterburn were good rides just way to short.  Not much else was there, the flat rides left a lot to be desired.  I was very surprised and taken back by the lack of, almost non existent theming in this park.  Boomerang Bay water park was a poor excuse for a water park.  In this area as well there was not a bit of theming at all making it and eyesore to look at.  \n\nWe purchased parking and single meal tickets online before going to the park only to find out that you basically saved nothing at all.  Parking on Line was $15 and parking at the gate was exactly the same.  Here is the shocker, we paid $13.99 for a single meal plan online + tax and saved exactly .50 cents!  Really Cedar Fair?  .50 cents?  That is all the discount you could provide if purchased online?  What is really bad is the food was horrible!  The first day we had lunch at Harmony Hall and we had what they called \"Steakburgers\" which was the worst hamburger I have ever eaten.  The second day we had lunch in Boomerang Bay which was a grilled chicken sandwich with fries.  This was the driest Chicken sandwich I have ever had and to top it all off the condiments, Ketchup, mustard, mayo, bbq sauce etc was left out in pump containers in the blazing hot sun, it was disgusting.  Save yourself the cost of expensive park food and go across the street to Cracker Barrel and get a real meal for under $9.  \n\nPurchased a tee shirt at one of the gift shops which was very reasonably priced at $12.99 + tax but the employees had not a clue.  Asked one employee if they had \"package pick up\" service and she said, \"what is that\" I explained and she told me to go ask guest services at the entrance.  Really, you don't know the answer to that simple question?  I asked another gift shop worker what the tax percentage was and he said and I quote \"I don't know\".  How in the heck would you not know the tax percentage and your working in a retail store? My rating for the tee shirt is 5 out of 5 stars because it was and excellent quality shirt for a good price. \n\nOverall we did have fun and it was worth the drive (10 hours) to ride Fury 325 and Intimidator but I will not go back to this park ever again and I would think twice before going back to a Cedar Fair property based on this park. \n\nThe Busch Gardens family of parks are a better quality of park, better theming and better rides.

Weather was perfect. \nCustomer Service: 3 stars- It really varied wildly.  Jessica was hands down the best ride attendant (5 stars for her).  I would say maybe 2 others from 10am- 10pm was at 4 stars and then the rest were dismal.  It was almost as if they were in a contest to see who could  ignore the kids the most and speak the least and mumble incoherently into the microphone.  The cleaning crews were terrible as well. Even if I pointed out a spill in a restaurant they would ignore it or go tell someone else to do it even if she/he was in the area anyway.  No one seemed to want to take responsibility.I will say that as far as directions go they were spot on and happy to help us find any place we wanted to get to.  And they were accurate.  5 stars for that!  I will do a separate food review for the park.\nHydration: 4 stars Online it clearly says $10.99 for a souvenir drink bottle but when you get there it's $14.99 unless you buy 3 or more. If you are a soda guzzler it's a good deal. If you go up to ANY food place they will give  you a tiny plastic cup of water for free because they are majorly short on water fountains.  This is a great service. We never were thirsty because it was a slow day and we did not have to wait in line as some of the places had a tray full of water ready for you.  Nice!  \nRides:4 stars  Hubby enjoyed the intense thrill of The Fury.  The line was only 45 minutes long so the kids and I watched a show while he rode it.  He gives it 5+ stars. Kids love all the rides in snoopy land.  Mama was bored with most of them but lines were short enough to ride their favorites twice.  I love the Peanuts characters that was a surprise bonus.  They even did a show at lunch in Harmony Hall.  \nThe show: 3 stars -It was a 60's tribute and I was surprised to see that they had the typical one black couple on stage and the rest were white kids sining glee style.  It was campy at best but my kids under 10 liked it enough to buy time for 45 minutes in an AC room.  The stage, seats, the building needs a major upgrade.  It still looked like it was from the 90s.  I was glad it was dark. I did not want to see how dirty it was. \n3 stars I was glad that the park had more mature trees finally.  I could find shade  here and there which was nice.  The grounds were really worn down though.  Everything really looked old and it's barely end of June.  Carowinds should invest in some sprucing up.  I will say that there were more trash bins in this place than I've ever seen anywhere.  Thumbs up for that.  And on our day they were properly emptied and never overflowing.  \nPark layout: 4 stars.  it's simply a circle.  Nicely laid out.  Easy to get to everything.  Nothing was too far away from where you were.  One advantage of a small park.  You can do it in one day if you skip the water park like we did.  Some even managed to do both from what they told me in casual conversation. From 10:30 am - 10:00 PM we rode every ride we wanted including big coasters, did Planet Snoopy rides 100% and returned there at night to ride with lights.\nSmoking: 1 star  WTF Carowinds?  it's 2015 and you are STILL allowing smoking?  REALLY?  There were smoking stations at the exits right where we got off rides so that you got a face full of smoke.  My kids were disgusted and I had to constantly move so I was not sitting near a smoker while I waited for my kids to exit.  Gross, unhealthy and gross! Allow vapes if you have to but say no to cigars and cigarettes please! And of course plenty of people smoked while walking around and in line regardless of the rules.  \nBathrooms: 4 stars\nPlenty around - some very up to date others like the ones at state fairs just clean enough to deposit and leave.  They stayed clean most of the day which is short of amazing.  Harmony Hall had the cleanest bathrooms.  Yay. \nPark patrons:\nNo rating as that is out of Carowinds control.  But I will let you know that in Summer a lot of the local teenagers use it as their hangout.  It's a cheap season's pass for most of them and they park at a gas station or wendy's and walk over and take over certain sections.  They were so obnoxious in line at one of the Planet snoopy rides all in a big group singing loudly and clapping in your ears and being you know rowdy teens.   Lots of PDA and scantily clad teens and adults all over the park.  People are still littering which shocks me.  Smokers in line.  But I also met some super nice people who were having fun with their families and I was glad to meet them and chat.

After 2 times going it pays for it's self.  Plus, discounts on everything you buy except games if the pass is shown as well as free parking.  If you go a lot, purchase the souvenir cup.  It's pretty big and you can get free refills all season long of water at no charge and if you want soda it's something like $2.00 a refill...costs $15.00 but so worth it for the summer, just don't forget it.  In October there's Scarowinds.  Water Park called Boomerang Bay is not an additional cost and is attached to the park.  Quite large with a lot of choices for all ages in the water park. A ton of parking especially now that the South entrance is finally open.  Most of all, my daughter loves it and at age 7, doesn't even notice or care about the negatives that as an adult, frustrate me enough to loathe going to Carowinds\nNow, the negatives...Boomerang Bay closes at 7:00pm...make is 9:00pm in summer months.  If you don't have season passes plan to spend a boat load of money.  Tickets are $50+ each, parking is $15.00 and food is ungodly expensive. Best bang for your buck is 2 slices of pizza and French fries for $12.00 over by the Superman ride, IMO.  Nothing is under $10.00 for any meal.  Carolina is HOT in the summer, be nice if they had a few mister tents around to walk through to cool off some.  The games are $3.00 a pop, did find one that was only $1.00 though.  The park was a nickelodeon theme park a few years ago and changed to The peanuts.  Kids now don't care or even know who Snoopy, Charlie Brown and the gang are, it was way better when it was Nickleodeon.  There is ONE exit line.

The park used to be owned by Paramount, but switched ownership several years ago. \n\nIt seems like in the recent years, Carowinds has been revitalized to a certain extent. It was always a fun place to go with a few good rides, but it definitely needed a fresh coat of paint and some new attractions. Two of these newer attractions are the Intimidator and the Fury 325. I had a chance to try both of these during my last visit, and thoroughly enjoyed them! The Fury is the fastest Giga coaster in the world, reaching a peak speed of around 95 miles per hour.

First of all, the price of some of the food items is completely ridiculous. You should expect to pay more for things at an amusement park, but $16 for a few chicken nuggets, fries, and a medium soda is completely outrageous. The amusement games are also very expensive, like you would expect them to be at a fair. The staff that work here are mostly younger, and they seem to not be the least bit interested in being there to help you sometimes.

Carowinds may not be one of the most well known amusement parks, but it is certainly one of the better ones (especially within the Southeast). Since Cedar Fair acquired Carowinds, the park continuously gets updated and improved! Most recently, they built 2 GREAT coasters - The Intimidator and Fury 325. These 2 coasters are some of the best I have ever been on and I've visited most of the top 10 parks in the country! Carowinds does have a show that plays several times a day, but honestly, the only reason we go see it is to get a break from the heat. There is a great children's area, with Snoopy/Charlie Brown being the theme that consists of character meet & greets, dining, shopping, and rides. For NO EXTRA COST, you can visit Boomerang Bay, a fun water park, which they recently announced will be expanding. Improvements all around.\n\nExcept for certain sections, the park is smoke free (YAY!) and now they're beginning to sell alcohol, within certain areas. Food options have increased and improved with fresher foods and a wider variety of choices. (Expect to pay tourist prices everywhere within the park.) Parking is not free, but I don't know how much it costs because it's free with an annual membership, which I have. Looking for something fun to do in Charlotte?

It also is much much less crowded than the Dowd or Uptown/Childress Klein YMCA, likely because it has no pool or gym.  This YMCA also has  great group exercise classes.

I keep going back to them, so that is sure to say something. I live very close to the Dowd Y and sometimes will run to this location or hop in my car to catch a class, even though I can walk to the Gateway location (which I do on some days when I don't have much time). \n\nPros: \n-Some people may consider this a con but I LIKE the fact that it is busy and very fast paced. As soon as I walk in the door, I can feel the buzz and excitement that everyone here is truly pumped to work out and better themselves. \n-The Dowd Y has a TON of classes and a varied schedule so you can choose the type of class for you at any time during the day whether it be before work, around lunch time or after work. I would suggest trying the Athletic Conditioning class if you like a challenge! The YMCA's of Great Charlotte posts their monthly exercise class schedule so you can prepare your workout routine in advance. I would like to say these classes are a great way to meet new people, but I am not one to chat while at the gym.. so that may be up to you to introduce yourself to fellow Y-goers. \n-This Y has a very young member base. I also like this. There are a few older members, who I would say are mainly men, that frequent here but not as many as the other Y's around the Charlotte area. \n-The staff is always friendly and most of them say Hello as you pass. I have never had a bad experience with any staff of any YMCA for that matter. They give off the vibe that they truly enjoy what they do! =) \n\nCons: \n-Parking is terrible at times. Mainly around lunch time and especially right after people get out of work from 5-7pm. But don't worry, you WILL find a space. You may just have to circle around the lot a time or two to find one. No biggie. \n-Around the same times, you may also have to wait for a cardio machine in the cardio area on the main level. This one can kind of be a pain in the ass, and probably isn't such a big issue at other Y's. When I show up around busy times and cannot get a treadmill or elliptical right away, I will usually wait a few minutes until someone gets off and offers me their equipment or I will lift weights first and come back to cardio later. Either one always works. So keep this in mind when you show up straight from work. There WILL be waiting times on certain pieces of equipment. \n-Layout: The set up of the Dowd Y is so strange, but considering it is in uptown I guess it makes sense. It is squished into a taller building, so a gym of this size covers several floors and it is confusing!! I still get lost and cannot find certain machines at times. I would suggest getting a tour from a staff member when you sign up, although they usually do that anyway. The cardio area on the main level (which is level 2) is really small and has a strangely low ceiling for a cardio area. It is the typical height of an office building ceiling so if you are not used to it, you may feel a little claustrophobic. I have always been used to gyms that are more spread out, spacious with higher ceilings, so frequenting this gym was an adjustment for me, but not one that I couldn't handle. \n\nIn conclusion, The cons are very minute compared to the pros of this Uptown gym. You could join the Sports and Fitness, which is only a block away from the Dowd Y, for half the price, but you would not be getting the size, variety of fitness classes and sense of community that you would receive at the Dowd YMCA. I pay $40 a month at the Dowd Y and can cancel whenever I need to. No contracts or sign up fee, and it is a monthly draft. This $40 a month also includes the use of the OTHER 2 YMCA's in the uptown area as well! I definitely think this is a much better deal than the close competitor Sports and Fitness. $40 for a monthly gym membership is very reasonable for downtown in a larger city.", "business_id": "b3u-GK6_xj2fJkinzLk_jQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-06-13", "type": "review"}

Now that I have been a member for awhile, I highly appreciate what it has to offer:\n1. No annoying kids/teens.  Sorry if I offend some people, but it is hard enough for me to drag myself to workout. I don't want to be babysitting and/or have to listen to some teenage drama.  The general demographic here is young professional.  They have a kids room for the very little ones when the parents are using the Y, but overall no kids running around like the other Ys in the suburb.  \n2. Towel service. They have small towels for wiping sweat as well as bath towels for locker room usage.  Excellent perk!\n3. Great hours.  It opens until 10pm weekdays. It opens early but it doesn't affect me, I am not a morning person :)\n4. Great facilities.  It has so much to offer, from great group classes (at all hours), to pool, basketball court, indoor running track, racquet ball courts and the equipments.  My personal fav is the steam room and sauna. \n\nYes, the parking can be challenging but after a while you can figure out when and where is the best.

I looked at Charlotte Athletic Club, Gold's and a few boxing spots. I use the gym for group classes and this place offers quite a bit. The classes offered run will into the evening (8pm), a must for those who have to run errands after work.  and the class instructors are great--they keep things interesting with new routines and music from week to week. The website is up to date with classes and instructors. The price is great for what you get --19 locations locally!\n\nThe staff is friendly and accommodating. They speak to you when you arrive/depart. They pick up the phone when you call and they have answers to questions! I mean, that alone is amazing. One of my cleats from my cycle shoe got stuck in the bike yesterday. The instructor took my info on what appeared to be scratch paper and said he would pass along my info. Sure, I thought.

I used to work out after 5pm and made alot of business & personal friends, yet I'm not in that world anymore. Overall the latest team (as of this email date!) is good.  In the past, you could fall over on the workout floors (& I have helped folks who have) and never a staff person around.  Now the staff is friendly, helpful & visible. I don't do classes, yet there are plenty of offerings. The womens locker room is clean when I arrive (vs a disaster area after the AM working crowd leaves :-) ).  The equipment is mostly good (need NEW rowers!!) and kept up by really great maintenance guys (ok, no girls, yet). The weight room downstairs is good, though more often than not crowded. Weight room staff please gently nudge people to get off their blasted phones (emailing, txting, changing their music whatever) & not letting people work in between sets. Also the music in the weight room is TOO LOUD (& terrible)..  I also wish the staff could walk through the 3rd & 4th floors every minutes and get the jerks off their phones who cannot read or don't care about the very respectful NO CELL PHONE signs. One guy weekday mornings (white hat, arrogant attitude) breaks the rule ALL THE TIME, staff has talked to him and he still does it (then others will start being as rude/arrogant about it). One bad guy yet people glare and he disrupts the zen of the morning (9-11 ' ish timeframe) workout adults, who respect people (other than white ball cap jerk).  I think the variety of equipment is great and there is something for everyone. \nFitCentral trainers are THE BEST (especially Janet & Jill) and worth the occasional if that's all - fee to train right for your body mind & soul.  (I cannot be comfortable the Y staff has beyond the basic training, and certainly not the time, to provide a good overall training workout).  \nThis is a busy, high-volume Y so lots of whining people who demand alot. I give them credit for trying to make people happy.

It definitely gets crowded at that time, so if you can make it here during off-hours, it is a decent gym. Very clean and nice locker rooms.  Plus, I once lost a necklace here, and the cleaning staff found it and gave it back to me, so props for that.\n\nI do have some serious issues with this gym, though. I am a group exerciser, so my main problem is with the group exercise facilities, which seem to have just been thrown together without much thought. Most of the classes are just randomly held in one part of the gym that is separated from the rest of the gym by sheer netting. As a result, when you're exercising the entire gym can (and usually does) stare at you. There also isn't a mirror anywhere for you to check your form. The YMCA actually has a proper group exercise room hidden away in another part of the building where a few classes are held, but it isn't clearly marked at all, plus you have get a special pass from the front desk to even get to it--very inconvenient.  The spin classes are held in the middle of the running track , so while you are spinning, joggers, often engaged in loud conversation, are constantly running by you, which is pretty annoying.  In general, the classes taught here tend to be different than at other YMCAs--the instructors are older and the classes are very Jane Fonda-esque.  I've been to a lot of them and have found the spin classes and the Body Pump (group weightlifting) classes to be the most challenging and have the best instruction. I've never been to the Athletic Conditioning class, but it seems pretty intense, too.  That said, in general, I don't think the classes are as hard as what you find at the Dowd or the Gateway (the Turbokick classes here are in no way as good as the ones at Gateway and the Dowd YMCAs).\n\nThis gym does have great pool going for it. Unfortunately, it tends to be packed with jerky triathlete types who either don't know how or don't care to properly share the lanes. Again, when it is off-hours, the pool is much better. \n\nWhile this Y does have parking in the basement of the building, but it is a little dicey to get around, and I believe parking is only free during off hours.", "business_id": "M89_KGMzLmdevtAlC_Ufsg", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-06-01", "type": "review"}

I think there are about 4 unassisted squat stands/bars, which is alot for this size gym. \n-Large offering of classes\n\nI usually go right at peak time and have never had to wait for a cardio machine.

Thanks for that! \n\nBlue was the only of my three Restaurant Week stops that was successful. Why, you ask? Well, one of the main reasons is because Blue offered a nice variety of their standard menu items on the Restaurant Week menu. No subtractions, no reduced portions no half-assed attempts at bringing back customers. Normal portions and great food. Four of my girlfriends and I made a reservation at Blue before heading to a show at the Stage Door theater. Here's how it went down.\n\nAmbiance: Blue is just pretty inside. They have a lovely bar, spacious tables and an overall upscale \"chill\" atmosphere. \n\nService: Our server was great. Dealing with a table of five women is probably not the easiest task of the night but he did well. He was friendly, polite and offered great suggestions. \n\nStrawberry Cheesecake Martini: Meh, I've had much better martinis from Blue. It was a little too strong and had bit of a burning aftertaste. This is all on me though, as I made the choice to order a martini with cream in it. Next time it's back to dirty. \n\nTega Hills Mixed Green Salad: Delicious. Organic mixed greens (according to our waiter grown in Tega Cay especially for Blue), chunks of goat cheese boursin, roasted tomatoes and a tasty vinaigrette. This was all topped with a pistachio tuile, which looked like a cookie and tasted like a crouton. \n\nAlaskan Halibut with a Lobster Succotash: I'm copying exactly what was in this dish straight from their menu \"pan-seared, potato-crusted halibut over lobster, corn, fava beans and tomatoes in a creamy lobster broth.\" It was delectable, friends. The halibut was moist, perfectly encrusted and perfectly balanced with the succotash. I would have loved a bit more lobster, but who wouldn't?\n\nSticky Toffee Pudding w/Salted Caramel Ice Cream: Our waiter mentioned to me that he hasn't seen anyone actually finish the \"cake\" part in this dessert. Now I know why. While the salted caramel ice cream was beautiful with the sticky toffee pudding, there just wasn't enough to go around and cut the sweetness of the cake part. The dessert was generous and tasty, but I needed more 'scream. And by the way, if they offered to sell this salted caramel ice cream, I would buy it in a heartbeat. \n\n*Note to Blue, your food was great but please don't tease us with a list of desserts on the Charlotte Restaurant Week website that you aren't going to serve. While the desserts were great, I and some of my fellow diners had our hearts set on a few of the desserts listed online but were not served that evening. Sad face.\n\nOverall, this was a very, very good meal and a great deal for Restaurant Week. Adding up all of the components, this meal (post tax, pre-tip) would have normally retailed for roughly $60 and I paid $41. Would I pay retail for this full menu, sure, I probably would. I just wouldn't order all three courses in one sitting. \n\nSee ya soon, Blue. I'll likely be the girl in the corner hoarding the chocolate martini and two desserts.", "business_id": "eaqJQP6bp7rQJQt5KqfvxQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-07-24", "type": "review"}

Ok, I'm lying.  I made one stop on the way home - Barnes and Noble -  to buy a dictionary so I could find the words to explain just how bad this place was for me.  If not for it being restaurant week, thus having reduced pricing, I might have 'made a scene.'\n\nSo I'll start with a service review since I can sum it up with one simple fact: 2 hours and 15 minutes into dinner (restaurant week I remind you - simplified menu, 3 courses) we were still waiting on stuff to be brought to the table.  The service was atrocious and incredibly slow.  At the 2 hour and 15 minute mark, we finally just flagged down the waitress, told her to box up the food, box up the desserts that hadn't arrived yet, just so we could finally get the heck out of there.  Initially I thought this was part of the \"Blue experience,\" but its not.  The waitress came by every 30 minutes, took the order for the next course, and it took an hour for each course to come out.  \nSo the food is boxed and i come home, nightmare over, right?  Wrong! they boxed up my friends food and gave it to me, boxed his up an gave it to the 3rd couple that was with us, etc, etc, etc.  So NOBODY went home with their own food.  I love my friends, but I'm not nibbling at their food scraps.  \n\nSo, food, how was the the food?  Not quite horrible, but not quite good either.  Edible is a better word for it.  I got the \"Grilled Niman Ranch Pork Rack Chop - with a Tuscan white gigante bean and kale ragout finished with a sweet Italian saba.\"  sounds fancy, eh?  Well, it was basically lukewarm vegetable soup, with a hint of chef boyardee, and a dinky pork chop dropped right in the middle.  It was so boring and bland, i question the chef's competence and would openly challenge him to a cook-off if this is as good as he could do.  I could walk into a grocery store blindfolded, randomly grab something, bring it home and microwave it for 3 minutes, and I would still like my chances.  Nobody at the table was impressed with anything they ordered.\n\nSo let's circle back for a second, and return to service.  The waitress was very nice and knowledgeable I have to say.  Maybe she was just over capacity?  I don't know.  But she recognized our frustration and had the manager bring our to-go boxes to us and apologize for the delays and long waits between courses (I think).  This is how that conversation went:\nManager: \"hey guys, sorry things took a little long, you know uh, restaurant week and the kitchen got backed up.  But how was everything?\"\nMe: \"Well, it was ok.  some things were pretty good i suppose, some better than others.\"\nManager: (blank stare)\nMe:  (awkward moment)\nManager; \"well sorry again, and uh i mean, you know ehhhh....\" (blank stare).\nMe: (still awkward so I'm just going to stand up now and leave).\nManager: (blank stare and walks away).\n\nneedless to say, I will never come back here again.  If it were free, I would probably still pass.  If asked what could they do to make it right, i would respond with a full refund of the entire dinner, plus compensation for the 2 hours and 30 minutes of my life that I'll never get back.", "business_id": "eaqJQP6bp7rQJQt5KqfvxQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-07-26", "type": "review"}

The beer list included some great options. The table started off Flavors of the Mediterranean - a hummus, baba ghanoush, olive tapenade, and white bean salad plate. There were also some stuffed grapeleaves (non-veggie) and a few goat-cheese stuffed peppadews served with pita bread - everything was delicious - very different flavors in each, amazing. I could have eaten the app as a meal. I think the olive tapenade was my favorite - just a very crisp and not over-salty flavor. I gave my grapeleaves away - but was told they were flavorful. The others ordered the Mussels with Chorizo and Piperade - and what a HUGE amount of mussels there were. I was told they were really good. They also served bread, a cranberry walnut and a cheese focaccia with an olive butter - this was also amazing. \n\nFor an entree I ordered the seasonal Alaskan Halibut. It was amazing. The fish was cooked perfectly (slight crisp to the outside, and tender inside) over crab, sweet fresh corn, red thumb potatoes, fava beans, and cherry tomatoes in a creamy corn broth - the flavors went very well together for an interesting dish. \n\nDessert was an amaretto dark chocolate cheesecake - it was good, not amazing.

The Hummus... Well I've had better. But the peppers with the goat cheese!!  Delicious!\n\nMain course: Pan Roasted Scottish Salmon with a Shrimp and Baby Artichoke Barigoule - with a stew of shrimp, artichokes, carrots, onions and bacon - I was more impressed with the broth the Salmon was cooked in then I was with the dish itself. \n\nHowever, desert was amazing!

Not bad, but compared to something like Hasaki Grill, they just cannot compete. Strike 3.\n\nNot horrible but given the Uptown choices (Room 112, Hasaki, Enzo, etc.) there are FAR better choices than Fujo.", "business_id": "hBscDTusN57Ai0SnkQK8Sg", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-08-07", "type": "review"}

I had the Godzilla roll, ikura (salmon roe) nigiri and saba (mackerel) nigiri.\n\nThe sushi rice for the nigiri is not correctly prepared, and the taste and texture are wrong.  For the ikura, the roe itself is fine and perfectly tasty, but the odd rice, and the fact that there is too much rice in proportion to the roe, makes this a chewy, imbalanced sushi.\n\nThe saba is acceptable, although a bit fishy as commercially-pickled mackerel tends to be.\n\nThe Godzilla roll is a travesty.  Utterly flavorless.  The cream cheese part of the filling seems to be mixed with spicy mayo, which still manages to taste like nothing.  The only flavor comes from the drizzle of teriyaki sauce and spicy mayo sauce (ick).  It's crunchy on the outside, yes, but even that has no flavor.  Uninspired.\n\nService was slow at 12:30 on a Monday afternoon, even though the place was not jammed.  Somewhat disappointing.  This place serves Chinese food also, and what I saw and smelled of that on other tables seemed appetizing, so perhaps this place is better for Chinese food.", "business_id": "hBscDTusN57Ai0SnkQK8Sg", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-07-06", "type": "review"}

My first recommendation to you is to stay away from the jerk chicken. While im sure its fine, their method is inauthentic, they just bake chicken and throw a jerk sauce on it, you can do this at home. A proper jerk chicken is actually \"jerked\" whereby its marinated and slow cooked, smoked and or bbqd. I opted for the oxtail instead, and boy was i impressed. To the largely whitey  audience on yelp, you need not be afraid by oxtail or its cousin curry goat, they are both delicious cuts of meat and mostly are raised locally (my friend in town farms goats). Oxtail was succulent, saucy, not too spicy, and braised just right. Beans and rice was perfect and even the collard greens were good.

My husband is uncomfortable with kids misbehaving in public and he was sure this was going to be a disaster.  The kids were riveted.  They goofed-off during the intermission, but didn't miss a minute of the play when the actors were on stage.  We were also amused with the sets and the adaptation.  \nThe second experience was an OnStage performance.  Students who participate in the School of Theater Training program (weekly classes from September to March) are eligible to participate in five weeks of intensive rehearsals, followed by a weekend of performances.  One of my daughters was cast into Urinetown, and I left the final performance thinking we were in on one of Charlotte's best kept secrets.  The talent of the kids was impressive - as was that of the directors, choreographers, and others who worked with the kids.  I had never seen this play before, but I am sure there was never a better performance.  Although rehearsals are held almost every weeknight during the five-week period, my daughter thrives on being part of this group - enough so that I don't mind driving from South Charlotte daily.  \nTake your kids to the plays.

Can't go wrong with cheese!\n\nSalads, I've had the house, ceasar, and spinach salads.  All good, but I think I prefer their caesar.  They do put some kind of garlic or some kind of seeds in their ceasar salads - something different, but good!\n\nMeats and Cooking - all have been good for the most part.  Although this last time, I didn't care for how their chicken was flavored, I enquired about it, and it actually had a hint of chocolate on it!

I thought that cooking appetizers, main course and dessert on a fondue was a very unique idea. The setting and lighting has a very romantic feel. On the other side, the prices are completely ridiculously high. You do not get a lot of food for the price. Our check was over $120 and that's a ridiculous price to pay for tiny portions of food.

After they checked me in they had me fill out a form saying I would accept responsibility for paying the bill myself and I told Dr. Cerwin several times that I could not afford even one session if I had to self pay so if that was even a possibility I should not be treated at all there. I explained that the only reason I came in was because they told me on the phone they could definitely bill the responsible party. Dr. Cerwin assured me that getting me better was his main focus, the staff assured me the document was just a formality, and Dr. Cerwin said \"let's just hope they do the right thing at the end and work on getting you better\". I agreed to see him for a while as long as he understood I could not afford to self pay, but he barely touched my back at all.

I've stopped by Mama Ricotta's many a time and, frankly, it's always been at least a good if not great meal. The service has always been friendly (especially in the bar for some reason) and even when things haven't gone perfectly, they have always offered to make it right. Big points here. \n\nSince I've been here so many times, here is a rundown of a few of my personal favorites:\n\nGoat cheese & marscapone dip: Exactly the nom-ness you would expect. Warm creamy dip topped with tasty tomato sauce and served with grilled crostini.\n\nPasta Primavera: Pretty basic, but a light and colorful veggie angel hair dish. I've only ordered this with the EVOO sauce but I'm always adding extra spice to give it a kick.  \n\nButternut squash ravioli: There is a fancier name to this in house, but you'll see what I mean. Delicious, tender butternut squash raviolis with an orange creame sauce, bits of proscuitto, walnuts and sage. It's ass  on a plate and it's amazing.\n\nIt's been a while since I've had dessert here, so I really can't comment on that. However, I have been here for brunch and it was asi asi...but really, Mama, you'll know I'll be coming back.

Not sure what made it taste so fantastic but it might have been the olive oil that it was sitting in.  Then, my mom and I split the family style dish \"Pollo Bianco\".  Again, this meal was very good.  5 chicken breasts smothered in a delicious sauce and mushrooms.  We got the garlic mashed potatoes as a side.  Yum!  I, also, ordered Mama's Mojito which is a bit pricey but delicious, nonetheless.  I would definitely go back.  And since they serve family style, I think this place would be great for big groups.

Then my bill would have been about the same or less, I would have gotten what I wanted, and I wouldn't have had to fight for a reservation at the most popular spots. Had I done that at  Mama Ricotta's, I would have ordered the Warm Goat Cheese and Marscapone Dip and Butternut Squash Ravioli or the Cannolicchi Pesto Di Pomodoro Secco.  My taste buds would have been doing the happy dance, because those are my \"go to\" dishes at Mama's, and they never disappoint.\n\nInstead, I had the Mozzarella and Tomatoes Salad, which was good and should have been, because that is a tough dish to turn into a hot mess. I also had Mama's Pesto Pasta, which was on the bland side at the restaurant, but the leftovers were much better the next day after overnight marination. My main course was Veal Milanese Primavera, which was just okay. Judge me if you want, but if veal is on a restaurant menu, I'll generally order it. Like lamb or venison, it is something I'm most likely not going to prepare at home, only because I wouldn't know what to do with it. However, I've sampled quite a bit of veal in restaurants, and this veal was nothing special.\n\nOne of my dinner companions actually did order off of the regular menu, and chose the Canneloni Al Forno. It pains me to say this, because I generally like Mama's, but it was not good. I didn't even know this was possible, but it was fairly flavorless except for the aftertaste, which to me was sour. My companion disagreed on the aftertaste, but felt that it was below average in general because it lacked flavor.\n\nOther companions had the Penne Alla Vodka and the Pollo Carciofi, which they enjoyed.\n\nThe Nutella Pie, though, was more than large enough to share, and was creamy and full of hazelnut and chocolate delectableness, and frankly was what drew me to restaurant week at Mama Ricotta's. As always, the bread was warm, garlicky carbohydrate joy. Service was amiable, if a bit slow on entr\u00e9e delivery and water refills. The half-price wine on Monday nights was also a plus. \n\nFour stars are being given to Mama Ricotta's for their usual fare. For Charlotte Restaurant Week's offerings, I wouldn't be that generous.", "business_id": "MQnNtW1lHS-eid3QNUoUIw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-07-21", "type": "review"}

A lot has changed over the past 15 years regarding what people in America are looking for in food, they've been able to stay relevant while not losing their credibility and identity.\n\nAs for value, it is in line with other quasi-casual Italian restaurants around Charlotte, which (IMHO) are all generally over priced, there are some more fairly priced options but you do have to look for them a bit more.\n\nAll in all you should not be upset with your experience at Mama's.", "business_id": "MQnNtW1lHS-eid3QNUoUIw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-08-28", "type": "review"}

I look through my other shrimps and they all still look very gray.  I ask others at the table and they agree.  When the waitress comes by to check on us I genuinely asked for her opinion as well and she too says it doesn't look cooked - it's raw shrimp! She takes it to be re-cooked and it comes back all well and good but now I'm not really feeling the shrimp so I avoid it.  The manager comes by and asks \"is the shrimp to your liking now?\" To my liking? I don't feel like this is like beef where I confused rare, medium, and well.  Shrimp is either cooked or it's not.  \n\nMy bill comes, and though I didn't ask for it I somewhat expected them to comp the $6 shrimp charge.  Nope.  It was still one there.  I looked up the possibilities of what could happen from eating raw shrimp and it stated that it would most likely cause food poisoning if anything.  Call me crazy though, but I would hope places I go to eat would help me avoid getting food poisoning from their food.

Even worse, it's getting harder and harder to find places to rent more unconventional indie films and older films that are rare on DVD or never even made it past VHS.  Luckily, Visart is there to save the day.\n\nThis place has an amazing selection.  They have everything separated into sections, which is both good and bad.  You can easily find your more traditional comedy or drama, but sometimes it takes a little searching to find movies from your favorite directors (because most likely they have their own section so you can find all their awesome movies together).  They also have a lot of foreign, indie, and classic films, as well as TV shows, anime, and even a lot of VHS.\n\nThe staff has been friendly and helpful each time we've been in.  You can see recommendations from staff on some of their \"best\" movies, especially if you're feeling adventurous with your selection.  Also, you have the option of searching for a movie you want online, and it will tell if they have it and which section.  Hurray for that!\n\nIs it a little more expensive than Redbox?  Well, sort of.  If you're renting for one day, then I suppose so.  However, most of their rentals are for multiple days, and you will find so many movies here that aren't found in a Redbox.\n\nThe only caveat is that you have to have a credit card to rent.  If you don't bring it back after 14 days and you don't call them, they'll bill your credit card directly.  It can't be a debit card, it must be an actual credit card.\n\nLuckily for me, they are close by my house.

They run an eco-business by using \"green\" machinery to reduce their carbon footprint and clean in-house instead of sending the clothes out to a third-party cleaning facility like so many dry cleaners like to do nowadays.  Furthermore, conventional dry-cleaning is far too polluting and I like to be prudent of the choices I make. \n\nThe couple that runs this business has always been very nice and courteous toward me.  I used to frequent V Cleaners & Alterations. In fact they used to be my go-to cleaners for all of my clothing needs and I even trusted them with my designer clothes. \n\nSadly, that ended the day I picked up my favorite Ruehl No. 925 dress shirt.  The buttons were destroyed and the shirt came out a bit tattered.  I was devastated!  For those unaware, the brand has been discontinued.  Although V Cleaners tried to correct the problem by replacing the buttons, the stitching was very poor, with uneven attachment and many floppy buttons, and a few buttons have since fallen off.  This was my first foray into their tailoring aspect, and I was thoroughly disappointed.  \n\nHowever the biggest problem is that they failed to tell me what happened during pick-up, and argued with me when I presented it to them. I found this to be highly unethical.  Since I have a keen eye I noticed the buttons as soon as the shirt and the other clothes were handed to me and immediately asked about it. There was an awkward moment, and after they stopped arguing that the shirt was given in that condition, they began to tell me that the heat from their machines had melted the buttons.  Don't give them anything with buttons, apparently, since their machines are like Pac-Man.\n\nHad they told me about the damage when I came in, and before I noticed, I would have been finer with it, as the problem should have been easy to correct. \"Should\" being the operative word as it was clearly too difficult for them.  So from that day forward, I started to patronize them less. I still send them my inexpensive new-to-me thrift finds (things without buttons) because they make them look like new, but I take the best stuff elsewhere.  If you use V Cleaners make sure to carefully inspect the clothes while you are in the store, and don't expect to find your clothes in the same condition you left them in.  \n\nI give it a two for old times' sake.", "business_id": "CtB6YHQPIHnuCN4I2dyyoA", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-06-11", "type": "review"}

Combining aspects of Malaysian, Japanese, Chinese, India, and Singaporean cuisine, if you and everyone that you are with are unable to find at least 10 irresistible menu items, then there are greater problems at play here.\n\nThe menu (which is actually a spiral bound BOOK) is filled with appetizing rice, noodles, curries, grilled meats, and sushi items. Depending on the extent of your culinary adventures, some items may be more familiar to you (teriyaki chicken, kung pao chicken, spring rolls) while others are likely to have your tongue twisted (Char Kway Teow, Nasi Nanas). However, regardless of its name, what ever you order will be delicious, plentiful, and addicting.  \n\nI've personally grown very fond of the Char Kway Teow, which is similar to Thai pad see eu (you know what I'm talking about with those wide chewy rice noodles). Unless I haven't eaten all day, one order of this will stuff me into a coma while have HALF left over for tomorrow. No joke. Portions are ridiculous for the price and sure to fill. \n\nI can also recommend for an appetizer the satay tofu, which are fried tofu triangles stuffed (yes, stuffed) with peanut butter, cucumber, and bean spouts. Their soups are also fantastic.\n\nAll the while, the servers providing you this abundant food are friendly, jovial, and even bordering on the down-right bad-ass. There is an older gentleman in particular (who usually drives for delivery) that reminds me of a really cool funny grandpa. He makes me want to order delivery just to hang out a little.\n\nIn all, my only complaint (if it can be called this) is that the portions are almost too big. I love sampling a lot of different things (particularly considering the range of options that they have), but this practice is simply not sustainable without a critical mass of mouths to share with.

I like you, but I would drop you in a heartbeat if a better Malaysian restaurant came to town. Why do I like you? Because you have a few of the important Malaysian standbys, like nasi lemak, char kway teow, white coffee, etc. The thing is, at Cuisine Malaya, these dishes are average at best and sub par at worst. \n\nLet's start with the basics: nasi lemak is fairly hard to screw up and, at Cuisine Malaya, it's fine. The coconut rice is too dry, so you don't get enough of that mild, creamy coconut flavor that sets Malaysian nasi dishes apart. The char kway teow tastes fine if you're not familiar with Malaysian / Singaporean cuisine. However, the texture of the meat is all wrong; white meat chicken without any browning. Yeah, I'll pass next time. The white coffee is clearly from a powder - you can go and get a pack of the same stuff (Old Town White Coffee) from Super G Mart and have it at home whenever you like.\n\nThe standout here is the roti canai - excellent crispy on the outside, soft and buttery on the inside texture. Outstanding sauce to go with it.\n\nImprovement needed on the beef curry laksa (too bland), roti telur (also bland), and the satay (not enough peanut flavor in the sauce).\n\nThat said, there are a lot of dishes I'd still like to try at Cuisine Malaya (pineapple rice, Hainan chicken, popiah), so I'll give them another shot and post another review after the fact.", "business_id": "MMNBgMQCdwyVoNaHg0h_QA", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-06-15", "type": "review"}

For the so called 2nd biggest comic book shop in the USA, I was not at all impressed.  The indie stuff that could be found was a) few and far between, and b) the stuff you wouldn't want to read anyway.  Extremely limited toy collection.  Almost no clothes.  Certain ongoing series were entirely missing.  There was a lot wrong with this place... (not to mention the guy pointed out to me that the checkout hadn't been updated to the modern standard.... but that was no big issue to me)\nWhat made me not give this place a 2 or even 1 star flop rating was the level of cleanliness and friendliness demonstrated in this place.  I would say that this is the most \"professional\" comic book shop I have ever been in; almost office like.  The charm of most comic shops consists of the fact that they are a bit grungy and cluttered; this place was pristine, and it worked.\nThe collection of trades was AMAZING.  That also saved this place.  I have never seen so many in any of the stores I've been in (including both comic shops and big name book stores.)\nThe parking/location weren't very accessible, and it felt out of place for a comic \"community\".... but it did feel somewhat.... appropriate.... inside of the store.

It was raw once before when I ordered and this time I specifically asked for it cooked well, but still raw dough, flavorless, and gross.  This is my first yelp review in life.

Yep, he's a big dork.  I couldn't decide what I wanted so I went with my standard veggie lo mein while the bf ventured out and had the Cherry Special Chicken.  We also got the standard egg rolls and crab rangoon.\n\nWell, the lo mein, first of all, was not lo mein at all.  It was actually chow mein and that did not really work for me since I prefer the wide, flat noodle usually found in lo mein dishes.  It was fairly bland and the veggies were scarce.   I mean, c'mon, it's veggie lo mein!  Give me something here!  The crab rangoon filling was nothing short of disgusting....it tasted like either ricotta cheese or curdled, mealy cream cheese.  Yuck!\n\nThe Cherry Special Chicken, however, was pretty darn tasty.  I ended up sharing with the bf because his food was way better than mine.  The sauce was a sweet/spicy combo and the chicken was tender and perfectly fried (i.e. not too greasy).  The only downside:  the cherries were of the marischino variety and tasted just like what you would expect: like they came from the bottom of a Shirley Temple.  Overly sweet and not so appetizing.  \n\nA mixed review all in all.....maybe if I branched out and tried something different, but I think next time, I will just go pick it up from somewhere else.", "business_id": "cibtubYc6gd8T6Y-nPPByw", "stars": 2, "date": "2008-08-12", "type": "review"}

He had the Chicken and Broccoli (He ALWAYS has the chicken and broccoli!) and seemed to enjoy. We split an order of crab rangoon and it was pretty decent too. It wasn't exactly complex in flavor, but it's tough to screw up crab and cream cheese deep fried in wontons. I had a General Tso's combination and I can best describe my impression as underwhelmed. The chicken was a little to crunchy/chewy for my taste and the sauce was not as spicy as a like my general tso's but I suppose these are both excusable if they happen to be your taste. \n\nWhat was not excusable, and really what is prompting me to write this review, was the egg roll. The only reason I was craving Chinese so badly was because I wanted an egg roll. You know how boiled cabbage can be kind of odiferous? Well imagine a wonton wrapper which contained nothing (no egg, no pork, no nothing) but cabbage that smelled, not mildly, of parade route (anyone who has ever marched behind mounted cavalry knows what I mean). I was very disappointed.\n\nIt should be said that the service was good and, as I said before, I have only eaten here once. You can pay your money and take your chances on the fact that I was there on an off night or that they will be more to your liking. I will be getting my Chinese food elsewhere.", "business_id": "cibtubYc6gd8T6Y-nPPByw", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-08-23", "type": "review"}
