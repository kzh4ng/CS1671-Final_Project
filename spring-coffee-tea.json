This, I must add, was in opposition to his mother's strong protests to the effect of, \"There's nothing *in* Pittsburgh, why would anyone go there?\" \n\nTazza D'oro is the answer to that question. Especially if you like coffee. This is easily one of the best coffee shops east of the Mississippi, and I've been to a lot of them. So, what's so good about it?\n\nLet's go in order of importance:\n\nCoffee - It is really, really good. They use Batdorf and Bronson beans, where an ex-gf of mine used to work in Olympia. Believe me when I tell you that B&B is good. It's not amazingly great, but it's very solid and they take roasting seriously. When I go to a new coffee place I suspect might be good I always get a latte. Why? This one has a high upside if done well and the lowest downside (lots of milk) if done poorly. I got a latte. They have a few sizes, 12oz was the first one I got. It was fantastic. They did a nice little rosetta in it too (look up latte art on google if you have no idea what this is). The baristo really knew what he was doing and pulled a some good shots with excellent crema. \n\nThe coffee was so good (coffee is supposed to taste bold, smooth and rich, which it almost never does and this place had it down) I had to go back for an 8oz, which is another level of trust. It has the same amount of coffee but less milk to hide poor coffee quality. It was always superior. \n\nThis is a coffee place that is truly top notch based on the coffee alone, but there was more. \n\nPastries - They all looked amazing. I had a plain donut while I waited in line. Normally I don't eat plain donuts, because life is too short for plain donuts, but it was really, very good. Everyone was commenting on how nice the pastries were.\n\nAtmosphere - This place has it exactly right. It's a mom & pop feel, nothing forced. Some tables, outdoor seating, maybe some local art, but not in a goofy sort of way. Very friendly employees. Just a complete home run. \n\nObviously I loved it. Behind me in line for my re-up, I heard a girl behind me in line complain, \"we could just go to Starbucks, it's cheaper!\" then proceeded to order with sugar free syrups and skim milk. That's fine. Everyone has to do what they like... and with the proliferation of bad coffee (Starbucks only being guilty of mediocre, though a little bit interesting coffee) over the past 10 years, I don't blame people for being set that way. But the beautiful thing about Tazza D'Oro (cup of gold in Italian) is that--if you let it--it will remind you that you don't need to make your coffee up like a drag queen on Halloween.\n\nTazza D'Oro stands as a reminder that coffee can be enjoyed in all its naked glory in an awesome setting on a beautiful street and give you a good f'ing reason to go to Pittsburgh.", "business_id": "83_p9vIqOq1TUIf3_GD7bA", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-05-26", "type": "review"}

It was delicious and filling, and at $8 for the enormous quesadilla and a small house salad, a pretty good deal. \n\nThe menu at Quiet Storm is large, with breakfast and lunch/dinner items as well as an array of cafe drinks and desserts. In spite of the prevalence of seitan and tofu, there are a number of dishes that I look forward to sampling upon return.\n\nAnd I do plan to return. As those of you who have read my other Yelp reviews know, the atmosphere of public places is very important to me, and the atmosphere at Quiet Storm does not disappoint. It's got a retro cool '50s diner vibe and a more modern but equally cool soundtrack that entices customers to stick around. The wait staff encourages this practice, giving diners plenty of space to hang out long after they've finished eating.\n\nThe one downside of Quiet Storm is its location, floating among gas stations and abandoned houses in Garfield, an area sandwiched between the more pedestrian friendly neighborhoods of Bloomfield and East Liberty, but not quickly accessible from either.

Hip, quirky, vegetarian/vegan. Lots of owls and kitschy deco. I eat meat occasionally, but had a vegetarian buddy here to visit, and thought this would be a great choice. What's not to love, right? \n\nWell, for starters, the service. Our server was really nice, and had lots of reviews, suggestions and alternate ideas for what we should order... but the service was mind-numbingly, ridiculously slow-- and the place was half empty. Plus, even after two requests for napkins (which were not provided to begin with, and not available from other empty tables around us) we never received any napkins at all. I'm not really a messy eater, but come on!\n\nMaybe part of the problem was expectations? We kicked things off with the \"firesticks\" appetizer-- some really tasty quesadilla-ish things. After that, our orders (I had the thai salad) were just kind of... boring? Strangely spiced? I feel like the bar was set high with the app, and then none of the entrees met the expectations of yummy veggie goodness, and my dining companions agreed. I also ordered a cup of the mac & cheese, and it was awful. You know how when you reheat elbow mac & cheese in the microwave, and the cheese gets all greasy/gloopy and the noodles stick together? Well, it was exactly THAT, with some powdered garlic sprinked on top. Really. I should have made my own leftover mac at home and not paid $4 for a cup of that. Learn from my mistake.\n\nWe had planned to order milkshakes, too, but our server spent so much time in a black hole or something that by the time she finally returned, we'd been completely finished with our meal for at least 15 minutes. For $4 (and probably a ridiculous wait) per milkshake, we decided to hit The Milkshake Factory on East Carson instead.", "business_id": "PzG0XmAmtXFs6Fdnubf41g", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-05-23", "type": "review"}

I got a plate with seisage, tofu scramble, and sundried tomato toast. My whole plate was entirely dry, chewy, and unpalatable.

I thought it'd be moister with a creamy consistency that might come from silken tofu, but it was hard, dry, and chewy. Hubby got a country burrito that was much better in comparison to my plate... But that might have been due to the fact that his whole plate was doused in gravy. Anything will taste better drenched in gravy. We think the gravy tastes like the powdered packet kind where you just add water. On top of all this service wasn't the greatest. I had to fish around for my own ketchup and they didn't even bother to ask me what kind of toast (3 options on the menu)I wanted when I ordered the toast option for my meal. Then they didn't bother to ask hubby if he wanted anything to drink after he had picked one of the $12 entrees that come with coffee or juice. We had to tell someone else to get it for us. Also they don't really wash their cups. There are 2 sink basins at the front where they just dunk the cups in one soapy basin then dunk the cups in a second water basin and then stack them next to the sink. It made me not want to drink my water even though I was thirsty. Good idea, but poorly executed food. I've had good vegan and vegetarian food before that's consisted of a lot of fresh greens, avocados, and more. For a vegetarian place, there was nothing green on our plates.

Folks working were vegan-hipster quirky, but friendly and helpful.  We ended up waiting about 30 minutes for our food, so we decided to partake in an afternoon coffee to pass the time.  I  had an iced Morroccan latt\u00e9 with cardamom and rose,  husband the Mandorla sweet almond milk latt\u00e9.

I wished there had been less rice and more dressing; the bowl was also screaming for more seasoning.  Husband opted for the Crunch Wrap Extreme: scrambled tofu tossed with celery, carrots, edamame, kale and spinach, dressed with vegan wasabi mayo.

Not surprising, as most of the employees I've encountered there (with the exception of the very nice older woman) seemed pretty put out when I asked for anything.\n\nIn any case, we have internet access at home now, and haven't been back to Katerbean since.

Let me start by saying I am a huge flavored coffee fan, with my two favorite places to buy coffee online being http://www.greenmountaincoffee.com and http://www.griggscoffeehouse.com/catalog/index.php\n\nI had previously only been to Fortune's coffee in the strip, and was also impressed with their flavor selection but not with the actual flavors of the coffee.  After telling people this I was told to try Prestogeorge's and that I would be amazed.  So, but trusting their judgements, I purchased 5 - 1/2lb flavors, of which I am finally trying the fifth.  The first 2 you couldnt barely tell that their was flavoring, which is insane for a flavored coffee (vanilla butter nut & pumpking spice ), the next 2 had some flavor, but I wouldnt call them amazing (creme brulee and rain forest crunch) and the last is Blueberry, which from Green mountain coffees is my all time favorite coffee.  I am drinking this while I write this morning and unfortunately there is no flavor here as well.  \n\nI am unsure why the coffees have no flavor, but IT could be that they are very old and have been sitting in the jars for long enough for the flavor to disperse.  Granted, the coffee itself still tastes fine, in fact if you were just going for plain coffee I may even recommend it.\n\nAnyway, my hopes were not to give Prestogeorge a bad rap, but to stop anyone from making the trip in hopes of getting excellent flavored coffee in Pittsburgh.  Just order from one of the two sites I listed above.", "business_id": "TASUnYvk_nvTUyKtroCJSA", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-04-17", "type": "review"}

Although I'm disappointed when I get there after the last special has been sold, this does not bug me...it simply lets me know that they don't keep anything around longer than a day!  Everything is very fresh in here.\n\nIf you feel like taking the path more traveled (God knows, its a well-worn path by yours truely), try the Loaded/Stuffed Hashbrown breakfast....you know how, when you get a loaded baked potato, all the sour cream, cheese, and bacon are gone in the first few bites and you still have 70% of a dry baked potato left on your plate, screaming for more accoutrement?

I guess I should always ask before I order to ensure that they have all of the ingredients.  In addition, it seems a little pricey for what they offer.

I assumed I would have to wait a long time for my food and it would be just okay. I was pleasantly surprised. Our food came relatively quickly, and my husband and I both enjoyed our sandwiches.  I had a CBLT which was excellent. The bread was perfect, and I loved fresh ingredients and the special mayo. My husband really liked the special of the day, which was  a tuna melt.  My bean and corn side salad was very fresh tasting, but could have used a tad more flavor. We also had a key lime coconut cookie that was AMAZING. I might have to go back next week just to get another one!!  The servers weren't overly friendly, but they definitely weren't UN-friendly.

The sandwich was good, and the price wasn't terrible for what I got (it also came with fresh fruit).  This is good, easy to prepare food, since they don't have a real big kitchen.  However, I would recommend stopping in one day for a light lunch, since everything I got was good.  Only downside was I waited a little bit for the sandwich, though they were very busy.", "business_id": "yzInxReAkf7r0aRbwj02Yw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-04-13", "type": "review"}

Hey that sounds good. The woman behind the counter, who was very nice, realized that we were newbies so she explained how things worked. Basically you can get any flavor you want in any drink you want. So I settled on a peppermint Italian Soda. The prices I noticed were very cheap for a coffee place.

Blue Saguaro is definitely a \"workers\" place - they are not open evenings and weekends and thus have no real neighborhood hangout crowd, but the atmosphere duplicates the neighborly feel admirably. Bright Mexican style painted walls take the edge off the otherwise generic mini-mall interior. A dozen or so 2 to 4 person tables are located inside and some plastic seating outside is usually ample enough to avoid waiting for a seat. \n\nThe menu is somewhat extensive for a small place like this but nothing fancy - sandwiches and a few salads; but there are some nice selections - turkey avocado, roast beef with horseradish, and a good veggies one too. And PB&J. haven't tried that yet - maybe next week. No grilled sandwiches. They have a selection of several bagged chips, and side orders of pasta or potato salad. Fountain drinks, bottled juices and waters, and Italian sodas with or without cream. Unfortunately the dessert selection is limited to a few sad-looking plastic-wrapped cookies and cake slices. They close at 2 or 3 PM - can't remember which. \n\nMornings they open at 6:00 and the coffee is almost always hot and ready. They do an assortment of coffee drinks. Breakfast fare includes bagels, bagel/egg sandwiches, and eggs with toast, although I've never had the eggs other than in the bagel sandwich. \n\nOverall I don't recommend making a special trip to seek out Blue Saguaro, but if you are in the 16th St. and Northern area and looking for a quick and tasty breakfast or lunch in a low key non-chain spot, you'll probably enjoy it.", "business_id": "3rJE7qliy8_ylKhY5FdlIw", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-05-01", "type": "review"}

Who knew you could hear amazing blues music for free -- in Sunnyslope of all places -- on the 2nd Saturday of each month!? I did, actually. The real question is why don't I go every month!?\n\nSo, now I'm hopped up on a dirty chai latte and I must share the details about this neighborhood gem. Truly, the Valley's BEST neighborhood coffee shop! For a number of reasons...\n\n1.) Grinders is a place where everyone feels welcome from high school kids to retirees taking advantage of the free wi-fi.\n\n2.) They roast their OWN beans. That's right. They wheel a roaster out onto the same concrete slab that becomes the stage for Valley blues legends like Ronnie Whitehead on 2nd Saturdays and roast the beans for themselves!! I find their coffees to be pretty earthy and smooth. \n\n3.) The fudgy pecan brownies are rich and chocolaty. The scones are biscuit-like and just the right amount of barely sweet. (I haven't tried the danish, but they look deadly!)\n\n4.) They are generous in sharing their own talents and promoting the talents of others, ensuring access to arts and culture. Each month, they allow a different local artist to show their work on the coffee shop walls. And while ordinarily they are not open past 6 p.m. on Saturday, an exception is made on the 2nd Saturday of each month when you can sit outside and listen to  live jazz and/or blues from 8 - 10 p.m.  And, by the way, Dennis, the owner, is a bad ass on the harmonica! \n\nWe really are so lucky to have such a great business, doing great things, in the community!", "business_id": "4eFIVmbeCvJGCrhzmd-VYA", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-03-14", "type": "review"}

It's about time I wrote a review, since I'm a regular. I can be found sitting on one of the giant chairs surfing on the wi-fi many mornings.\n\nI'm the one who brought the plants in. I used to water them a couple times a week but nowadays I'm lazy and they really need to be repotted. I should get on that ...\n\nThe music is always playing and everyone knows my regular drink ... they've continued to memorize it for me even as I started to slowly decrease the fat & calories of my regular order. Now it's an ice skim latte with sugar free vanilla. I used to get an Everything bagel with egg, cheese and potatoes most mornings. Now I get it on multigrain toast. Eh, it's the little things.\n\nThe coffee at Grinders is really really good. It's not bitter and sharp, it's smooth. They grind their beans outside many mornings per week. Sometimes it gets too warm inside during the winter so we prop the doors open, but if the grinder is going outside, it'll blow coffee bean fumes in the door.\n\nThere's some retired motorcycle cops who meet up every morning and sit around the big round table. They often park their motorcycles in front of the place together. They call themselves the Geezerados.\n\nThere's sometimes a few right-wingers having conversations mid-day. One time I listened to their meeting and heard them trying to come up with controversial topics to get people to come to church. They spent a long time trying to figure out who could get them proof that global warming isn't happening, so they could use that as their hook.\n\nA lot of moms come in with their kids. Seeing siblings piled up in one of the oversized chairs together is common. There are a few regulars who come in specifically to sit on the internet all day. I'm not there all day, but I'm there at all times of the day because I have a home office, and you never know when you suddenly need caffeine.\n\nEarly in the morning and after 3pm the place becomes flooded with Sunnyslope High School kids. They range from ROTC kids wearing pickle suits to trendy girls in neon to the alternative crowd. They often lay around the couch splayed across each other or gazing into each others' eyes. \n\nOrdinarily I'm a real talker and I can't usually keep my mouth shut, but Grinders is the one place that I go where I barely make a peep. I just eavesdrop on everyone's conversations and sometimes run into friends I know. I usually go before my brain is fully awake in the morning, that's part of it. For the record, a couple months ago one of the girls there said I was practically invisible and she hardly knew I was there, because I was so quiet.\n\nThere's nothing pretentious about Grinders at all, and it's also down to earth without being ghetto. It has character. Some months the art is better than other months. Hannah has been there for years (they call her Big Hannah now, only because there's another girl named Hannah who is tiny and they call her Little Hannah) and Hannah rocks and makes the best breakfast ever. \n\nI can ride my bike in the morning and be wearing my pajamas and not have anyone really bat an eye. That's the beauty of Grinders. I've seen other people come in wearing their pajamas, too. It's a little bit like the cafeteria in a college dorm, except the people are of all ages and we live down the street from each other instead of down the hall from each other.\n\nGrinders has a location inside the John C. Lincoln hospital across the street, too. It's common to see the hospital workers walk in wearing their scrubs. I think they're also opening one at Devry, or they just did. I was frustrated to hear that they tried to open a location at the Art Institute but they were one week too late, Stupid Starbucks had just gotten there.

They also use cream (sorry health nuts - not your drink) that gives it a bit of a silky buttery taste mixed in with the bittersweet chocolate.  I would class it a Bittersweet Nirvana!  Starbucks's new Cocoa Cappuccino does not even compare to it and all it does is make me crave the Bella Mocha even more.

Its a small place (as is the parking lot in front, spots are definitely at a premium, I wish you luck!), nice and quiet on the inside, with plenty of seating, and an area with computers (internet code comes with drink purchase should you desire to use it. So its not really \"free\" wi-fi, per se, but \"if you buy from us you can use our internet, till the code expires in a few hours, and you need to buy another drink from us to get a new, active code\" wi-fi). Outside, there's a scattering of tables, ashtrays, and lakefront seating. Lakefront seating you say? In Arizona? Well, you better believe it. Sitting on the corner of a man-made lake for an apartment and condo community, those who are so inclined can start the morning (or end their days) sitting by the lake, enjoying the ducks, and the view of the water, and whatever beverage you have purchased to wet your whistle.  Pretty calming if you ask me, but, hell, I grew up on LI, NY surrounded by water, so it might just be a bit of a bias, based on the fact that, well, I grew up on an island. Which means you should take my advice: sitting and listening to water flow and watching the lake is calming. \n\nBut what about the drinks, you say'? They are the reason you go to a coffee shop, so sure, I'll get on with the drinks. Get. The. Coffee. It's good. There isn't much other ways to say it. Get the coffee, its good, you won't be disappointed. You can fancy it up with milk and sugar, or drink it straight up black. Its just good coffee. If you down for the other drinks, The Frosts are pretty good as well (blended ice, mocha, flavored syrup of your choice, and espresso). They tend to be a bit on the pricier side (6$+/drink), but if you're willing to drop the dough, they are pretty tasty. Iced Tea wise, they have your standard regular unsweetened tea, which is good, a green tea, and I'm not sure, but I think they'll drop  bit of flavoring syrup into the tea should you desire. Unfortunately, the iced tea only comes in one size. It's pretty good tea, but I suck down the approx 16 oz cup way too quickly. If they'd serve it to you in the giant Frost cups, then all would be right with the world, but alas they wont, and you're forced to go back and pay for a refill sooner rather than later. \n\nAll in all, good coffee, good (albeit small sized) iced tea, semi-free wi-fi, and relaxing lake front setting.

One of my pet peeves here is that they have hardly any food!  It's the same crap every week, baklava and other really sugary things.  Wish they had sandwiches or some real food besides sweets. If you wanna enjoy the ducks and lake there is a good chance you will also be enjoying someone else's smoke.

It depends who you get.  Most of the staff is pretty cool and mellow, the owners on the other hand can sometimes be abrupt and some what rude.  They don't like you hanging around for too long.  As for the Wi-Fi, I went in once bought a latte and some cake thing and asked for a WI-Fi connection # (you need it to log into their network).  I sat down with my laptop and iphone and realized  I was going to need another Wi-Fi connection # cuz I was planning on updating my iphone while I was there and they make you get a # for each device.   I immediately went back to the line and asked the girl for another Wi-Fi connection # at which point she told me I would have to spend at least another $3 in order for her to give it to me since that was their policy.  I had just spent $7 for that coffee and stupid sweet thing  so as far as I could see I had met their policy.  A lady in line with her husband agreed with me since she remembered me being in line ahead of her and told the girl to just give me her # since she didn't think they were being reasonable either.\n\nThis place has a lot of potential and they would get a higher rating from me if they would address some of these issues.", "business_id": "l1MZjZK2tLxfFRB62lQmsg", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-05-22", "type": "review"}

I know its just a water tower but the history, being built in 1923, and the scale, 123 feet tall, it's quite a sight to stand underneath. With a 3 million dollar renovation and new park surrounding the tower, it's both modern and well, cool. \n\nHere is some good news if you're a fan of Joe's Real BBQ or Joe's Farm Grill; restaurateur Joe Johnston also owns Liberty Market. So you'll know right away that there will be high quality and tasty food at very affordable prices. This is also due to the fact that Chef David Traina and his wife Kiersten are pretty much running the show at Liberty. Both were so helpful that we felt like we were honored guests; as I'm sure most will feel when visiting. Chef David came from behind the open kitchen and greeted us personally. His gorgeous wife Kiersten was so helpful as she had many recommendations from the menu and drink list as we ordered. Its customer service like this that will not only make you a loyal guest, but you'll quickly share this experience with your friends.\n\nBuilt in 1935 the building has been lovingly restored into that retro-American-modern feel that the other restaurants have. On a side note, be sure to check out the bathrooms, there are several in which to chose and each has its own theme. To get things moving along at Liberty you stand in line and place your order at the counter, then they give you a number to place on the table and when your order is ready they bring it out to you. There are quite a few places to sit including a large patio, main indoor dining room and a long bar overlooking the wood-burning oven. This is the place to be if you love to see your dinner being made before your eyes, its up close and very personal.\n\nDepending on what time of day you go the menu has its bases covered. From the coffee bar to a fun and interesting breakfast menu as well as the main menu, you might be hard pressed to just order one thing. The main menu is comprised of sandwiches, pizza's, salads and cold case offerings such a fresh hummus and potato salad. You may also be happy to know that they serve beer and wine to compliment your dinner choices, priced so well that you may want to try more than one if you're not driving.  Be sure to take a look at the wall of kitschy gift items like bear shaped salt and peppershakers and Party Snaps. Who didn't play with those when they were a kid?\n\nBeing all about fresh and local we started with the Antipasto ($11), which was large enough to share between 4 big eaters. A large serving platter covered in Molinari and Sons cured meats, roasted Brussels sprouts, baby carrots, olives and slices of artisanal cheese were a delight. The grilled bread that came with the platter was a nice compliment to the deliciously salty cured meats. Instead of ordering the Caprese Salad ($8) we opted for the Caprese Sandwich ($7), which even came with a cold case side dish. The corn, tomato + bean side was a bounty of freshness from the crunchy corn to the smooth toothsome Navy beans. This was a real compliment to the wonderful flavors of the mozzarella, sliced tomato, fresh basil and balsamic on the sandwich. The Liberty Joe ($7) is a take on the classic Sloppy Joe enjoyed by millions of kids over the years. Tender ground beef in a rich and hearty tomato sauce a top a toasted bun, lots of love for this one. Mac and cheese was the only side that could have been chosen for this one, kid heaven!\n\nThe pizza's are all hand tossed and baked in a beautiful Renato wood-burning oven. The pizza crusts that come from this oven are lightly crisp, slightly charred and simply scrumptious! Starting with the White ($11) this one is not to be missed! If the combination of cream sauce and smoked mozzarella wasn't enough, wait till you taste the chopped bacon and tender pieces of chicken, oolala! Another sure fire hit was the Grilled Sausage ($10) covered in stringy mozzarella, roasted onions and tomato sauce. While the Molinari ($11) sounded great, the cooking of sliced cured meats makes them way to salty and intense for my taste, gamey.\n\nDesserts vary from day to day, so on our visit we had the pleasure of a slab of Red Velvet Cake ($5). If you've never had red velvet, please do. Moist chocolate cake covered in thick frosting of cream cheese delight. If you're in the mood for something a little different, order the Bread Pudding ($5). This was probably the lightest bread pudding I've ever had, which was more like French toast pillows swimming in a sea of creamy love.\n\nLoad up the car with friends and go ahead, make the trip to Gilbert and see what you had no idea existed.", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-03-06", "type": "review"}

There weren't nearly enough crackers or toasts or whatever you want to describe them as for the amount of salmon. The \"dressing\" on the greens was almost nonexistent even though it had a pretty good flavor. The salmon and capers were good, but I've had better.\nThe pancakes were just overpriced. I don't think I should have to add in an extra 2 dollars or whatever it was for blueberries. The TINY amount of syrup they give you is ample enough for one pancake, not three. \nAnd the quesadilla? I just don't get their \"homefries\" or \"potatoes\" or whatever they call them. It's more like an onion casserole. They shove them inside the quesadilla, which is filled with eggs and chicken and salsa. It's HUGE. I would split this if I go again.\nThe coffee is SUPERB, though. Great flavor. Rich, robust and not bitter. \nParking is ample - there are a lot of places to park around the neighborhood, and the revitalization efforts of this \"historic\" neighborhood are noticeable. \nThe little market where they sell things isn't anything great. You can go to the farmer's market on Power Rd. and get better prices. And AJs has most everything else at comparable prices. (Yes, AJs prices are comparable to Liberty Markets). I do like the idea though. If they could procure items that were \"hard to find\" then this concept would play out nicely. \nMy overall observation, however, is definitely the flow of the service lines. ?? I really wish there was some other way to herd the cats...without making it awkward and anxiety ridden. \nThe decor is awesome though. It's a great concept - and I was actually a purveyor of the original Liberty Market, so I enjoy the Owner's commitment to keep the integrity of the building.

The second thing was its stand-in-line order process.  I completely agree with Gabi M, as having to wait until you reach the cashier to ask questions regarding the menu is quite annoying for us, and for the patrons waiting behind us.\n\nMy wife was going to order the Rancher Salad, as it came with  grilled steak and caramelized onions.  Interesting note: the menu doesn't mention that the steak comes pre-grilled, served cold.  Good thing we asked.  Cold meat didn't sound that appetizing, so she deferred to the Liberty Bowl + Pasta.\n\nI was going to order the Salmon Plate but become enamored with the wood fired pizza oven, and went with a Margherita pie.  Good thing!  The salmon comes cured and served cold (the online menu didnt mention that, but the store menu did).  I also ordered a cup of caprese pasta salad.\n\nWhile we waited near a boisterous table, we noticed how loud it can get inside, as it echos.\n\nMy cavatappi pasta in my caprese pasta salad was fairly dry, although it did come with grape tomatoes and tiny balls of fresh Mozzarella cheese which were good.  I wouldn't order it again though.\n\nThe cavatappi pasta also made an appearance in my wife's Liberty Bowl entree.  I would have opted for a penne or spaghetti or linguine, but am sure its much easier on the kitchen to have to prepare one pasta type.  I liked the sauce, but found the meatball to be almost chalky, but definitely crumbly, with a taste reminiscent of Chef Boyardee meat nads.  My wife didn't want to eat them.  I smooshed one on my plate and photographed it for your viewing pleasure.\n\nThe saving grace was their wood fired pizza.  The crust was fantastic.  Thin but not cracker crisp.  It was crisp on the outside, but soft inside, with a great taste.  I highly recommend this menu item.  They used a fresh crushed tomato sauce, which was spot-on.  I commend them for this, as they could have opted for the easy way out, using the Liberty Bowl maranara sauce.\n\nTheir dessert case did not contain many appealing offerings.  Most of them just looked dry.  For example, refer to my photos of the brownies and cinnamon rolls.  I agree with my wife.  If you are going to display something in a case for all to see, make sure its fresh and remains visually appealing.  If you're unable to accomplish this, why have a dessert case?  Where's the allure?\n\nSorry Liberty Market.

If it weren't for the fact that I was on my way to join some friends at their house to watch the Super Bowl, I would've stayed here longer!  (My first, and so far only, visit lasted three hours.)  Liberty Market reminded me of Scottsdale's The Kitchen, but geared more towards the younger crowd- college, young upstarts, thirty-somethings (who here miss that show?), and the young-at-heart.  Loved the whimsically retro mini \"giftshop.\"  I would later on come to find that the restrooms here are reasons enough (five, to be more precise) for a visit!  Maybe it's just me, but it's the quirky touches such as these that make destinations like Liberty Market and brother company Joe's Farm Grill stand out from the pack.  (Although I must admit enjoying LM's restrooms MUCH better than JFG's (check out my review!).\n\nSo, what did I eat??  Only one of the tastiest white pizza and farmer's salad I've ever had.  The thin-crust pizza wasn't as crispy as I'd like (I'm very finicky), but this pizza was bursting w/ so many flavors!  With grilled chicken, crunchy and chopped thick-cut bacon, parmesan cream sauce, smoky mozzarella, peppery arugula, and pine nuts, how could it not?? Can you believe I ate the entire thing??  Well, OK- I did shave off half of the crust (the soggy center), but nary a chicken chunk, lean bacon (I trimmed off the fatty layers, which there weren't much to begin w/, as these chopped pieces were grilled crisp-to-perfection!), nor arugula leaf escaped my ever-vigilant fingers!  And what about the farmer's salad?  (BTW, you may find its recipe on the walls of one of the themed restrooms.)  It, too, was quite scrumptious, if a bit too salty, and contained lightly-roasted vegetables, mixed greens, heavy on the palatable sesame-crusted croutons, and a really great lemon vinaigrette.  I'd be hard-pressed not to order these again on my next visit, but I am determined to try other selections as they sound so appealing.\n\nLM's layout made it fun to look around and get a feel of the place and what it has to offer.

Liberty Market has flabbergasted me. What a place. It is so unassuming from the street, almost leaving you wondering if you're in the right place, but then you walk through those doors and feel like you've been transported to some magical dream world. Here's a word of warning, I will be gushing until the end of this review. \n      I asked my dear Kristen to find us a new restaurant last night for dinner, and she, through a very unorthodox way, found us Liberty Market. I asked her if she was sure it was a restaurant and not a market, she said yes, and we were off. While driving over to Gilbert she let me know that the owner of Liberty Market was also the owner of Joe's BBQ and Joe's Farm Grill, this excited me to no end because those two places are wonders themselves, masterfully put together and designed, if I may say so myself, and Liberty Market is no different. \n      Sitting next to a fun water park of sorts (a great place for photography), it is set in beautiful downtown Gilbert, and right when we walked in the door we were greeted by every employee under the sun, it seemed even the chefs ran out from the kitchen to say hello. Now, this was not because it was slow, there were quite a few people there, not quite busy, but hopping for sure, they simply are awesome employees. The atmosphere here is incredible and the interior has a wonderful modern design, there is even a \"market\" where you can purchase various drinks and old timey trinkets. The salad and bread chefs conversed with us and explained how the market worked, so we sat ourselves down, looked over a menu, and picked our delights for the night. \n      Kristen stuck with tea, while I had an Anchor Brewing \"Liberty Ale\" as we began our meal sharing the starter pizza, a delicious, light, grilled flat bread with olive oil, pecorino romano, rosemary and hummus to dip it in. We were already hooked with just the starter. The bread was so good, warm and airy, the cheese had a perfect bite and the hummus was a perfect topper, nothing too heavy and nothing too lite, simply a delicious starter, leaving us ready for the next tasty morsel. I ordered the flatiron steak with chimichurri sauce, garlic smashed potatoes, and fresh from the ground grilled vegetables. The steak... oh boy, the steak... it was so flavorful, cooked perfectly, not tough at all, I'm having a hard time finding words to describe the deliciousness, it was just so good. The chimichurri sauce added a wonderful dimension, it was light but flavorful, never overpowering. I thought the potatoes were awesome, a great blend of big delicious fresh chunks of potato and small hunks of garlic, and the vegetables (carrots and asparagus) had a wonderful grilled taste that brought out their natural goodness. A truly special and wonderful dish. Kristen ordered the liberty bowl with pasta (essentially spaghetti and meatballs) and loved it. The meatballs were big and filling, wonderfully seasoned and cooked. The marinara sauce was done really well, tangy and rich with an intoxicating aroma and the noodles were tender yet had a good bite to them. I am by no means a pasta man, and I thought it was terrific. With every bite, we each were just overwhelmed with our plates. The food at Liberty Market seems to have been very well planned out with careful seasoning and incredible ingredients. \n      We will be back to Liberty Market, many many times. You simply have to try it, you will see what I mean, see why it's so special. Also, don't leave without visiting the restrooms, all of them, peek inside each one. I love cool restaurant bathrooms, and these are some of the best.", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-05-18", "type": "review"}

It would be such a perfect place to drop by for brunch or lunch, but sadly, it's about 30 miles away for me. Sigh. \n\nDavid, the executive chef and co-owner of Liberty Market took care of us - what a cool guy. I just read his bio on Liberty Market's website and he's had quite a history. His collaboration with Joe (of Joe's Family Farm and Joe's BBQ) made some magic.\n\nI shared sandwiches with a friend, so I could try two. I had the Maiden Lane (turkey, brie, red cabbage slaw, cranberry, and a horseradish aioli). I really liked the combo of the cranberry with horseradish. It definitely has a kick to it. I also had half of The Farmer (roasted veggies, grilled sweet potato, and goat cheese). Loved all the veggies! Note: make sure you like goat cheese because there's a generous amount (Another friend got it sans cheese and liked it a lot). I also had the sweet potato salad on the side - delicious!\n\nWe couldn't leave without trying dessert. We shared carrot cake (it was very gingery which I love) and had delicious frosting. We also ordered a chocolate/peanut butter square which was a scrumptious tower of chocolate, peanut butter, and crackers sprinkled with sea salt.

Two of those six visits we experienced, what i consider to be, poor service.\n\nOverall the food here is wonderful, the prices are higher than average, at least the quality of food lives up to the prices.\n\nThe fact that there are no waitresses helps keep the overall cost down.\n\nHOWEVER, regarding the 5.00 piece of Red Velvet Cake:\n\nMy wife and I visited at night for a slice of cake and coffee, it was wonderful.\n\nSo wonderful on our next visit, we ordered another piece of Red Velvet cake to go. Later that evening, upon diving into the cake, we noticed it was dry. We assumed it was cut from the end, resulting in dryness from the one exposed side.\n\nOn the next visit, we ordered a piece of Red Velvet cake and I noticed it was pre-cut and sitting in \"to go\" containers. The whole cake was there, but the slice they gave us was pre-cut.\n\nI also noticed the bottom layer of the cake was a different shade of red than the other two layers. I notified the hostess, told her of our previous experience, to which she replied \"well, sometimes when people take the cake home and refrigerate it they confuse the coldness for dryness\". She proceeded to fetch us two forks to \"test\" the cake. She put the forks on our table and walked off...NEVER TO RETURN. \n\nFirst, I never said we refrigerated the previous piece of cake, because we did not. Secondly, we know our way around cake. Thirdly, when considering a FIVE DOLLAR SLICE OF CAKE, if I ask for a fresh cut piece, I better get one! NO QUESTIONS ASKED. \n\nWe spent $30 for two entrees, one drink and one slice of cake. That's a lot of \"cake\" in order to receive a slice of cake with less than grocery store freshness.\n\nOur other previous negative experience was similar, we asked to substitute macaroni salad for potato chips (due to food allergy issues), they refused, saying they could charge us the $2 for the single scoop of macaroni salad, we refused.\n\nTo their credit, Joe (the owner) was there, he came by and asked us how our meal was, we told him of our experience. He immediately jumped behind the counter and fetched the macaroni salad.\n\nMoral of the story...in my book Premium Prices dictate Premium Service...Liberty Market has the premium price part down, better than average on the premium food part...HOWEVER, on the premium service part...they fail, over and over again.", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-03-15", "type": "review"}

It was the original market in Gilbert and was renovated into a classy, urban restaurant and coffee bar. I have not had the opportunity to sample all of the fare on the menu, but everything I have tried has been no less than superb. \n\nFor breakfast I highly recommend the Breakfast Quesadilla or the Sicilian Scramble. The griddled bread pudding is a tasty treat, but be prepared to stuff yourself beyond belief (maybe make a stop at the Freestone Rec Center for a post gluttony workout).\n\nThe E61 espresso bar is separate from the main dining order line, but you can order food while sitting at the bar (I recommend this option). The espresso drinks are crafted very well and with a great attention to detail. In fact, I have had a barista re-make my drink (without my request) because he was not pleased with the crema on my americano. \n\nThe only downside is it can be noisy and crowded on the weekends, and parking is a bit of an issue. However there is ample parking behind the water tower park, its just not in close proximity. You might need the extra exercise though :)\n\nJoe Johnston has been a great ambassador to Gilbert and I am and always will be a huge fan of his business endeavors.

Truth is, Liberty Market can be a great spot.. IF you come at the right time and order the right thing. Sure their menu is small yet diverse, but if this is your first time here, focus on their best sellers and NOT what you usually order at other places.\n\nThe time to come is lunchtime or an early dinner. Breakfast is not suggested just because there aren't a lot of menu options (besides their ONE bfast special), though it is great if you just come in for a ready-made pastry and a latte. In terms of food, I really suggest to focus on the sandwiches and pizzas as these are definitely their best sellers. As a health nut, I ignored this and ordered the italian salad and really regretted it- it was pretty bland in flavor, lame in content and overflown in mostly iceberg lettuce. No good.\n\nThe picnic sandwich, on the other hand, was surprisingly delicious. At a hefty $9 it is composed of roasted turkey, caramelized pecans, green apple, blue cheese, and a red pepper mayo. Its basically everything I want in a salad, but between two pieces of bread. The blue cheese with the sweet pecans are an amazing combo that help the lame roasted turkey meat to kick it up a notch. It is also incredibly filling, so I was able to eat half for lunch and half for dinner. As an extra, the sandwich came with a roasted sweet potato salad (containing dry cranberries and a really thin glaze). \n\nAs an extra, I was incredibly surprised and disappointed at the \"roasted veggie side\". At $3 it basically came wit 2 half-Brussels sprouts and 2 miniature carrots. Are you kidding me? This ain't the freaking cordon blue, put more food on the freaking plate! Luckily, the veggies were ridiculously well made, but the portion size was definitely lacking.\n\nNot everything is wonderful though. The round tables outside are almost too small for a party of 2- if barely fits the plates and just makes it awkward to share. Waiting in line for 20mins to order isn't my favorite thing either, especially since a server brings our food out anyway. The prices are pretty steep for a \"pay at the counter\" sort of place but overall, its a nice place to be. Just don't order salad.", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-05-22", "type": "review"}

The size of it is bigger than my FACE, and it was so good that i probably could have finished it all if i didn't stop myself. I gave most of the cake away to our foreign guests from Argentina, who's never tried red velvet before.

After about 10 minutes I finally got the sangria which I was slightly disappointed in since moments before I saw a large jug being brought out from some back room that looked store bought. I was also hoping it would have more fruit but it had a small orange slice inside.\n\nBy the time the food had gotten to our table, I had finished my drink and it had been almost 30 minutes. The pizza wasn't bad considering the lack of creativity the pizza had. The size was great but as for topping go, there were large chucks of mushrooms, thinly sliced zucchini and large chunks or asparagus. The flavor was lacking something but I ended up eating all of the pizza.\n\nFor dessert, I chose the bread puddling for my friend and I to share because the woman at the register said it was 'super yummy' and after waiting for another 15, the dessert came and it was far from special. There was more whipped cream on the dish than anything else (probably to compensate from the watery consistency that was called pudding). We maybe both had 4 bites combined.

It has roasted turkey, caramelized pecans, green apple, blue cheese, greens, and roasted red pepper aioli.  Everything about it is perfect, but when you get your first bite of blue cheese and caramelized pecans you'll wonder why you don't eat that sandwich every single day of your life.\n\nAnother favorite is the Flatiron Steak with Mr. Pibb marinade.  I'm a fan of flatiron steak and anything that uses Mr. Pibb in it is good in my book.\n\nThe line to order can get pretty long at the standard meal times, especially on the weekends, but the employees do a really good job of getting you a number and assigning you a table while you're waiting.  I've never finished ordering and not had a place to go and sit down right away - no matter how busy it's been.\n\nThere is no waiter service at Liberty Market; you start by ordering your food at the register and then get your own drinks.  The food is delivered to you table by runners which is nice, but then drink refills are on your own throughout.  It's a good system that works well though.  The runners delivering the food to the table is a nice in between so you don't need to go back up to the counter after you've sat down.\n\nDessert is great too - we always get the Salt River Bar because chocolate and salt is a perfect combination.  They have lots of house made desserts and bakery items like red velvet cake, cinnamon rolls, scones, rice crispy treats, and cupcakes.  Definitely pick something up for dessert.\n\nI've only mentioned lunch and dinner in this review, but Liberty Market does do breakfast which is what we go in for most often.  I don't love their breakfast selections however.  You pretty much only have a choice of variations on eggs.  The breakfast menu is not extensive or particularly interesting, but, like I said, my family and I probably go to Liberty Market for breakfast more than we do for lunch or dinner so take that for what it's worth.\n\nLiberty Market is one of our absolute favorite restaurants in the downtown Gilbert area.

My only regret is not coming sooner. We visited on a wednesday night and were surprised to see that the restaurant was almost full. We ordered from the nice cashier and signed our ticket with one of their very cool \"spoon-fork\" pens. \n\nThe FOOD: \n\nI ordered the cobb salad with no egg. The salad was delicious, crisp greens, perfect combination of chicken, bacon, avocado and lots of blue cheese! They offer a choice of blue cheese dressing and balsamic. I like a mix of both and they were nice enough to accommodate yet another special request from me. \n\nMy daughter had their Best Chicken sandwich. Of course in my house I have a rule, I have to try everyones food so I can write a Yelp review that is accurate. So I had a couple of bites of her sandwich and it was delicious, perfect combination of all delicious juicy chicken breast with melted Monterrey jack cheese and that heavenly avocado spread, I almost didn't want to give her sandwich back.\n\nMy son had the burger special of the week: The Ruben Burger. Oh my, what deliciousness! This teenager of mine, who normally would just inhale a food he likes or refuse to eat it if it \"looks weird\" declared that he was going to eat this burger slowly, because  since it was a special, he wasn't sure he could have it next time we come here. \nI had to sneak a bite when he got up to refill his drink and then of course the other mandatory bite for the yelp review. \n\nTHE REST\n\nThe ambiance is great, the decor of the place is amazing, the bathrooms are cool, a little awkward if you are not used to co-ed bathrooms in a restaurant and all their employees were nice and friendly. \n\nI will make sure not a month goes by without making a second visit to them!", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-03-01", "type": "review"}

You're seated, you order, you pay, you go. However, at the Liberty Market Restaurant, they take a simple matter and turn it into dining hell.  \n\nI had wanted to try the Liberty Restaurant for a while as it was always busy.  So on 03/07/14, I decided to give it a try. \n\nFirst, off, parking was interesting as is often the case with gentrified or revitalized downtown areas. \n\nAt both entrances, there is a sign that states to \"Order Before Seating.\" I waited by one counter.  The server gave a perfunctory hello, and then proceeded to walk  by me twice while I stood there.  So I went to the other end of the restaurant and waited there.  She walked by me again, finally seating herself at the espresso bar to chat with the regulars.  I was completely ignored. \n\nAs a customer, I can say the service was horrible.  I didn't even stay to try the food, I ended up leaving and going to another restaurant. \n\nLater on, when I saw their prices, I'm glad I didn't eat there.  They are very overpriced, and if the service is any indication, you're better off eating somewhere else.  \n\nAt the Liberty Market Restaurant, it seems that if you're one of the cadre, you're welcome.  If you're a new customer, then  there is no place for you there.

Parking available on the street or a block down the road (covered parking on the left).  It's a pay at the counter type of place so grab a menu when you walk in.  While your waiting in line to order you will be given a number that will correspond to your table.  This is a genius way to prevent small parties from taking big tables!   We arrived for a late breakfast and were still able to get a table for 6.  You will then place your food and drink order (You would be doing yourself an injustice if your order excluded something from the Espresso Bar).\n\nWe ordered a breakfast quesadilla with chorizo and the American Standard with a side of biscuit an gravy.  For coffee we ordered a cortadito, 2 cappuccino's, and a Vietnamese coffee.\n\nWe found our seat right away and got ourselves some water which was in the middle of the dining area.  The coffee was served up promptly and we were surprised that the cortadito came in a pair of shot glasses.  Upon first sip, we knew we were in an amazing place.  The cortadito is pretty much the best coffee drink I've ever had in my mouth.  I would put it up against Monmouth coffee in London.  It was creamy but not too sweet and had a wonderfullly smooth roasted flavor.  You will want both shots for yourself (cortado) but it is a great way to share a coffee.  The cappuccino used Stumptown and it had a wonderful flavor to the espresso.  I added a touch of raw sugar to sweeten it and it really was excellent.  The Vietnamese coffee was a little too sweet but had a wonderful taste to it as well.  The E61BAR knows how to make espresso!!!  I don't think you can go wrong at the coffee bar.  The Cuban drinks use Mr Espresso French Roast (oak roasted beans from Oakland, CA) while the others use Stumptown (these are listed on the menu) beans from Portland, OR.  \n\nThe breakfast quesadilla looks quite unappealing on the plate as it's a folded tortilla with a side of salsa and nothing more.  The filling was a delicious blend of chorizo, eggs, cheese, and onions (the salsa really made it pop).  I feel like the tortilla got in the way and a scrambled version would be a better implementation.  Maybe if the made fresh tortillas it would boost this dish.\n\nThe All American Breakfast had a huge pile of eggs, but they were uninteresting and rather bland.  The fried potatoes were much more flavorful with onions bell peppers and red pepper flakes.  Dave is amazing at making fried potatoes and quite a nice guy.  The biscuit was moist and fluffy...highly recommended!  The gravy was good but not as good as homemade.  It had a touch of spice but lacked a sausage flavor.\n\nI'd be remiss not to mention the window enclosed kitchen on the way to the bathrooms where you can watch the food being prepared.  I watched Dave's potato magic and am ready to duplicate at home.  :)\n\nThe bathrooms are quite unique with each stall individually decorated with a different theme.  One of the themes are recipes but I cannot say they're used by the restaurant.\n\nI cannot wait to come back again.  The passion in the food really comes out and the wood fired pizza oven is begging me for a dinner visit!", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-03-16", "type": "review"}

The pizzas are really tasty, so much so that I never seem to have the self control to not order them and try something new.  If you're vegetarian or trying to eat more greens, try the veggie pizza -- made with local produce, whatever is freshly picked ends up as toppings!  Salads and sandwiches are also delicious.  And the dessert selection is always pretty great.  \n\nThe only negatives are that the place can get incredibly busy at peak hours, so come early or be prepared to wait.  Also, food (entree, drink, dessert, etc.) adds up quick and can get kinda pricey here.  Another bummer is that the waitstaff won't seat you if your whole party isn't present, which has been an issue/hassle in the past when a large table was needed for a birthday party or special event but all the guests had yet to arrive.

The property was a market store for many decades before closing down and renovating into this great local restaurant. The owners kept elements of the market around- look up towards the ceiling when you visit- you'll see some original shopping carts gliding along the walls. There's even a \"mini market\" near the entrance where you can purchase edibles and drinks.\n\nThe place is open, clean, and very inviting. The food is prepared in front of the patrons, no hiding. You order via counter service, find your table/booth and then the food is brought to you. The menu is great- fresh salads, sandwiches, flat bread pizzas, and soups. There's always a daily special posted near the order station so check that out before you make up your mind. Most dishes come with your choice of a cold case side item- potato salad, caprese pasta, sweet potato salad, hummus, etc. You can't really go wrong with your choice, so just follow your taste buds. All dishes I've tried are excellent. The meatball panini is great, as is the egg salad (order it with bacon). My suggestion is to visit with a group of friends, order a variety of dishes and share them. \n\nLiberty also offers drinks and excellent dessert items. As you wait in line to order you will be forced to pass through their dessert cases, and it will take plenty of will power to turn down something like their enormous cinnamon rolls, or cheesecake in a jar. Just try it. Many food dishes are paired with a local brew that is offered at Liberty, and they usually have great options for wine lovers as well. There's a very small patio, and if the weather is right, it's typically pretty tough to get a seat there.\n\nSituated in old town Gilbert, among many great new restaurants, Liberty Market is a spot you should check out.", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-03-30", "type": "review"}

Built out of an actual Market, there are still vintage shopping carts and other items adorning the decor. The size, feel, and layout make it nice for couples, families, or other large groups. Outdoor seating is nice but limited, and you may find yourself in the sun depending on where you sit.\n\nThe counter ordering process is novel, but more and more places are adopting this method. Often the lines can be long, especially for some dinners and Sunday brunch, but there are usually plenty of staff to keep the process moving. Even at it's longest I don't think I've waited more than 20 minutes or so to order and sit down. Plus the time passes pretty quickly because the line runs next to the open kitchen, allowing you to look at all the prep work going on and to admire the wood-fired pizza oven.\n\nAs for food, I have yet to be disappointed by my selections. I have mostly gone to Liberty Market for brunch. The seasonal pancake is always a nice option, with the most recent one being an orange pancake with a vanilla drizzle. It was light and not overly sweet, just good hints of orange with only as much vanilla syrup as you need (even though you might want more). I personally think the best  selection on the breakfast/brunch menu is the Smothered Breakfast Burrito. They have a grilled chicken or Schreiner's chorizo option for the protein and both are good (although I usually opt for the chorizo). Tomatillo or chile pequin salsas on top, yum yum! It's definitely a large item, so plan on being full or sharing with your dining companions. You can also order single glasses or large carafes of mimosas or sangria. Both are good ways to start a relaxing weekend.\n\nOn top of all of this they also have a very nice coffee bar that can be accessed separately from the food if you are just stopping in for your caffeine fix. The regular coffee is certainly good, but if you really want a good coffee experience go for the Cafe Au Lait or the \"Ca Phe\" which is a take on Vietnamese iced coffee. \n\nDowntown Gilbert is amassing a very nice selection of dining establishments, especially with the Upward Projects restaurants anchoring the scene. But for my money, I almost always find myself at Liberty Market when I'm in the area.", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-03-31", "type": "review"}

After all the hype on this place I was a little put off by the actuality.  Upon walking in for lunch we were told to wait in line for 30min  where someone would assign us a table and eventually take our order.  It was a beautiful day out, we couldn't walk around the streets waiting for a table, no.  My pregnant wife and I had to stand for 30min on concrete floors waiting to place our order for mostly pre-made food.\n\nMy wife order the \"Best Chicken Sandwich\" with an Asian Cucumber Salad (the special side of the day) and I got the \"Picnic\" with roasted sweet potato salad.  My wife ordered a latte and I had a bottled beer (nothing on tap) and an iced tea.  Since both sandwiches were labeled as gluten free (as were many of the sandwiches - why have that be the main bread option) and knowing that gluten-free bread isn't really bread we asked about other options.\n\nI was told they had other options but was only given the gluten-free bread, bun or wheat bread.  I chose the bun, my wife's sandwich came with the bun (which I suppose means that the bun is GF also).  \n\nAlthough the line was huge the tables were about half empty.  We were still wedged in a main walk area right next to another couple with many tables open that were more out of the way.\n\nThe iced tea was empty when I went to fill my glass, when it was finally filled it was very weak (which is ok with me).  My wife's coffee (she is a Starbucks regular) was bitter, overly strong, and didn't have enough milk.\n\nHer chicken sandwich had a nice grill flavor but the bun was untoasted and dry.  The Asian cucumber salad was bland.  My cold, roasted sweet potato salad tasted like cold, day old, browned sweet potato.  There were dried cranberries (I think) in the salad but they didn't add much IMO.  The sandwich was overstuffed in the center and fell to pieces immediately.  It wasn't served on the bun I requested, only the regular bread which had a stale texture and was untoasted.  The sandwich was impossible to eat without a knife and a fork (or going caveman).  The turkey was good, but IMO there was too much blue cheese and not enough green apple.  the sandwich was also poorly constructed with a giant wad of \"stuff\" in the middle that tapered to the edges pushing all everything out when gripped. The toasted pecans immediately fell out.  Is it really that hard to construct a sandwich?\n\nThe place reminds me a lot of Joe's Farm Grill.  A lot of ingredients that impress people when listed (arugula, brie, aioli, ect)  and promises of freshness that aren't delivered on, but still impress the customers.

I had soup and a sandwich - a classic BLT kicked up a couple notches on panini bread. It was fantastic!  I paired it with their fresh broccoli and cheddar soup, which was amazingly fresh and wonderful. My fianc\u00e9 had the Hot Cuban sandwich- which was ham, pecan smoked pork, provolone, red cabbage slaw, pickles, and spicy mustard aioli. She very much enjoyed it! We also had dessert, which was homemade oatmeal cr\u00e8me pie-  two oatmeal cookies with a cream cheese frosting in the middle, which was superb! The atmosphere here was very nice as we could hear ourselves talk while soothing music played in the background. I think the next time we come here I would like to come for dinner, as I couldn't justify a $33 price tag for lunch, which is my only complaint.

However, the reason for my bad review is because they were so unaccommodating and rude.  A dear friend of mine was just diagnosed with breast cancer, it has been a whirlwind of tests and procedures since her diagnosis.  We just found out she is going to start chemo this current week, so I thought it would be nice to have a get together with her friends and family and throw her a \"hat, wig, scarf get together\" to show our support for her.  Last week, I called Liberty Market and explained the situation to the manager on staff and she was very rude.  She just said they don't take reservations at all and that I would need to email the owner.  I apologized for the last minute notice but explained that everything has been happening so quickly, we were just notified chemo was starting early the following week.  I asked what the turn around time was to hear back from the owner because it was about 4 days prior to the event so I needed to get it organized, and she just said she didn't know.  I understand not being able to take reservations but she didn't have to be rude.  She could have help provided options we were bringing 20-30 people to the establishment.  As much as I like their food I will not be going there again.  After this rude interaction I called The Original Chop Shop in Chandler and they also do not take reservations, but were willing to help us out and make sure they had enough employees staffed and seats available to accommodate us.  I truly appreciated their help!  Liberty Market employees need to have sensitivity training!

Being a creature of habit, I probably have ordered the Liberty Pasta Bowl half the time I've ate there, but don't miss out on the pizza. I think it rivals Le Grande Orange pizza if you've ever had one there. I like the sausage, the wife likes the Margherita. \nThe thing that makes this place stand out among the myriad of dining choices in downtown Gilbert is the variety. All the other restaurants have a certain niche, whether tacos, chicken, pizza, burgers and soon to be mexican and breakfast. The Liberty does most of them and does them very well. When guests are in town, the Liberty Market is a perfect choice. When we want variety, the Liberty Market has no competition.

My turkey veggie the other day consisted of a completely brown slice of avocado hidden between a clump of your typical grocery store processed turkey.  After I peeled the aged avocado off of the bread, it was edible but it was so very typical and blah that it made me wonder why I paid almost $10 for half a sandwich and a bag of chips.  My past trips have yielded similar disappointing results, with most of my lunch remaining untouched on the table.  \n\nI wish I could say the coffee was amazing and made up for the lackluster food, but the lattes I've had have made me wonder why I keep coming back.  It's just too bad that a local coffee shop like this can't step up their game a bit and really blow the competition out of the water by being the complete package.

(I'll have to upload a photo.)\n\nBut.... then come Valentine's day and I scored again with a Groupon coupon for a Tiramisu. I surprised my sweetie with the cake, and we loved it! Again, tasted divine!\n\nThe staff has always been super friendly and helpful when I've been ordering the cakes. Very professional. I wouldn't hesitate to order here again!\n\nOh, and BTW I've seen their \"sweets\" available for purchase in some Phoenix Whole Foods Markets -- AND even in Tucson! (So you know they're good if Whole Foods is sellin' em!)", "business_id": "YgqexscIgNoMBAO__J97zA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-03-08", "type": "review"}

There are some poor reviews out there, but we decided to roll the dice and wow was I glad that we did. \n\nWe had nothing but great service from them - the phone service was a little sketchy like they were multi-tasking while talking to me, but really I can't fault them because I do the very same thing at work. What matters is that they nailed our cake. I actually came in with a sketch of how I wanted my cake to look, which is I think kind of a risky proposition versus going with a tried and true design. The sales lady checked with the cake designer and they said they could do my design, and best of all, with just buttercream frosting to support the design, which is great because fondant is nasty and $$$. So we tasted all the flavors and decided on lemon cake with raspberry mousse (yum) and chocolate cake with coconut cream (double yum). I actually changed the chocolate flavor to red velvet a few weeks before the wedding because unbeknownst to me a lot of people don't like coconut, and the red velvet was a total hit. \n\nSo how did the design turn out??? ( I will post a photo). AMAZING. I was so nervous as I arrived at the venue and we were taking pictures my thoughts kept drifting over to the cake. I was a little freaked out thinking how it would look, again, only because of the few negative reviews, not because of anything I experienced. So finally I grew some cajones and went to look at the cake. Holy cow it was awesome. It was better then I imagined. After a few friends posted pics on facebook tons of people commented on how cool the cake was. \n\nSo huge high five to Honey Moon Sweets. We did not have a cake with our package so we had a choice, and we are glad we chose you. The cake vendor is one you don't get to see or thank at your wedding, so I want to thank your staff and your cake designer for knocking this one out of the park!", "business_id": "YgqexscIgNoMBAO__J97zA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-05-09", "type": "review"}

My work is located down the street from this wonderful bakery. I stopped in just to see what they offered and ended up buying a few petite desserts. The desserts are amazing. I asked for a catering menu for the office and they sent me off with a giant almond coffee cake to share with my co-workers for free. What a wonderful bakery and amazing customer service. I was told by the staff that everything they make is all natural; they supply desserts for the major hotel chains as well as Whole Foods. Can't wait until the next family event so I can buy one of their yummy cakes or pies!", "business_id": "YgqexscIgNoMBAO__J97zA", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-03-22", "type": "review"}
